https://openalex.org/W2040654802,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is a severe viral disease in pigs, causing great economic losses worldwide each year. The causative agent of the disease, PRRS virus (PRRSV), is a member of the family Arteriviridae. Here we report our investigation of the unparalleled large-scale outbreaks of an originally unknown, but so-called ""high fever"" disease in China in 2006 with the essence of PRRS, which spread to more than 10 provinces (autonomous cities or regions) and affected over 2,000,000 pigs with about 400,000 fatal cases. Different from the typical PRRS, numerous adult sows were also infected by the ""high fever"" disease. This atypical PRRS pandemic was initially identified as a hog cholera-like disease manifesting neurological symptoms (e.g., shivering), high fever (40-42 degrees C), erythematous blanching rash, etc. Autopsies combined with immunological analyses clearly showed that multiple organs were infected by highly pathogenic PRRSVs with severe pathological changes observed. Whole-genome analysis of the isolated viruses revealed that these PRRSV isolates are grouped into Type II and are highly homologous to HB-1, a Chinese strain of PRRSV (96.5% nucleotide identity). More importantly, we observed a unique molecular hallmark in these viral isolates, namely a discontinuous deletion of 30 amino acids in nonstructural protein 2 (NSP2). Taken together, this is the first comprehensive report documenting the 2006 epidemic of atypical PRRS outbreak in China and identifying the 30 amino-acid deletion in NSP2, a novel determining factor for virulence which may be implicated in the high pathogenicity of PRRSV, and will stimulate further study by using the infectious cDNA clone technique."
https://openalex.org/W2093157637,"Activated fibroblasts are key contributors to the fibrotic extracellular matrix accumulation during liver fibrosis. The origin of such fibroblasts is still debated, although several studies point to stellate cells as the principal source. The role of adult hepatocytes as contributors to the accumulation of fibroblasts in the fibrotic liver is yet undetermined. Here, we provide evidence that the pro-fibrotic growth factor, TGF-β1, induces adult mouse hepatocytes to undergo phenotypic and functional changes typical of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). We perform lineage-tracing experiments using AlbCre. R26RstoplacZ double transgenic mice to demonstrate that hepatocytes which undergo EMT contribute substantially to the population of FSP1-positive fibroblasts in CCL4-induced liver fibrosis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that bone morphogenic protein-7 (BMP7), a member of the TGFβ superfamily, which is known to antagonize TGFβ signaling, significantly inhibits progression of liver fibrosis in these mice. BMP7 treatment abolishes EMT-derived fibroblasts, suggesting that the therapeutic effect of BMP7 was at least partially due to the inhibition of EMT. These results provide direct evidence for the functional involvement of adult hepatocytes in the accumulation of activated fibroblasts in the fibrotic liver. Furthermore, our findings suggest that EMT is a promising therapeutic target for the attenuation of liver fibrosis.

Liver cirrhosis is still the sixth most common cause of death among United States citizens from ages 25 to 64 (1Friedman S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2247-2250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1877) Google Scholar). Cirrhosis of the liver and its functional loss, which is caused by a progressive fibrosis, occurs due to a variety of insults, such as viral hepatitis, metabolic or autoimmune diseases, toxic injury, or congenital abnormalities (1Friedman S.L.

Fibrosis in the liver, as with fibrosis in other organs such as lung, kidney, heart, or skin, is described as excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM), 6The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; EMT, epithelial to mesenchymal transition; TGF, transforming growth factor; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunoassay; BMP, bone morphogenic protein; FSP1, fibroblast-specific protein-1; β-gal, β-galactosidase; αSMA, α-smooth muscle actin. 6The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; EMT, epithelial to mesenchymal transition; TGF, transforming growth factor; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunoassay; BMP, bone morphogenic protein; FSP1, fibroblast-specific protein-1; β-gal, β-galactosidase; αSMA, α-smooth muscle actin. which leads to the destruction of organ structure and impairment of organ function. Activated fibroblasts are key mediators of organ fibrosis. In the fibrotic liver, such activated fibroblasts are considered to derive via activation and proliferation of resident stellate cells and periportal fibroblasts (1Friedman S.L. J. Biol.

Because specific treatments to halt progressive fibrosis of the liver are not yet available, further understanding of the underlying pathogenic mechanisms involved in the accumulation of scar-forming fibroblasts is required.Evidence is evolving that fibroblasts are more heterogeneous than traditionally thought (10Kalluri R. Zeisberg M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 392-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (3149) Google Scholar) and recent studies reveal additional mechanisms such as recruitment of bone marrow-derived cells and conversion of resident epithelia as contributors to the accumulation of activated fibroblasts in fibrotic tissues (10Kalluri R. Zeisberg M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 392-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (3149) Google Scholar, 11Zeisberg M. Kalluri R. J. Mol. Med. 2004; 82: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). In this study, we attempted to gain further insights into the role of adult hepatocytes, the parenchymal epithelial cells of the liver, in the accumulation of fibroblasts in the inflamed liver. A direct contribution of hepatocytes to liver fibrosis is considered to be relatively minor, even though hepatocytes perform the majority of liver associated functions and constitute more than 80% of the liver cellular mass (1Friedman S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2247-2250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1877) Google Scholar, 12Martinez-Hernandez A. Amenta P.S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1401-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that hepatocytes could directly contribute to the accumulation of activated fibroblasts during liver fibrosis by actively engaging in cellular transition.Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is defined as a process in which epithelial cells loose their phenotypic characteristics and acquire typical features of mesenchymal cells such as fibroblasts (13Thiery J.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 442-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (5408) Google Scholar, 14Hay E.D. Zuk A. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1995; 26: 678-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) (15Savagner P. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 912-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Plasticity resulting in cells shifting between epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes is essential during embryonic development, as it permits anchored epithelial cells to re-orient their phenotypic characteristics in a developing organism (16Peifer M. McEwen D.G. Cell. 2002; 109: 271-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In adults, EMT involving resident epithelia is speculated to occur in response to injury, which protects them from cell death by serving as an additional source of fibroblasts, which are essential for the repair of injured tissue (11Zeisberg M. Kalluri R. J. Mol. Med. 2004; 82: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 17Iwano M. Plieth D. Danoff T.M. Xue C. Okada H. Neilson E.G. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar, 18Reichmann E. Schwarz H. Deiner E.M. Leitner I. Eilers M. Berger J. Busslinger M. Beug H. Cell. 1992; 71: 1103-1116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). During organ fibrosis, such as in the kidney or lung, conversion of epithelium into fibroblasts is considered detrimental, as it leads to the disruption of polarized epithelial layers and an increase in the fibrotic scar formation (17Iwano M. Plieth D. Danoff T.M. Xue C. Okada H. Neilson E.G. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar). In the adult liver, however, evidence for EMT involving hepatocytes is lacking. Recent studies suggest that EMT is a promising therapeutic target for inhibition or even reversal of fibrosis in the kidney (19Zeisberg M. Hanai J. Sugimoto H. Mammoto T. Charytan D. Strutz F. Kalluri R. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 964-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar, 20Yang J. Liu Y. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 96-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the fetal liver, hepatocytes are detected in various intermediate stages of EMT (defined as cells which co-express mesenchymal and also hepatocyte markers), further suggesting that at least during fetal development, hepatocytes can contribute to the emergence of cells with mesenchymal features (21Chagraoui J. Lepage-Noll A. Anjo A. Uzan G. Charbord P. Blood. 2003; 101: 2973-2982Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 22Pagan R. Martin I. Llobera M. Vilaro S. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 598-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).In the present study, we demonstrate that in addition to αSMA-positive myofibroblasts a second population of fibroblast-specific protein-1 (FSP1) positive fibroblasts contribute to the progression of liver fibrosis. We demonstrate for the first time that under the influence of TGF-β1 up to 45% of FSP1-positive fibroblasts derive from hepatocytes via EMT. We further demonstrate that administration of BMP7, a growth factor which is known to inhibit TGF-β1 action, inhibits progression of liver fibrosis and that such protection of the liver is partially mediated by prevention of EMT.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Recombinant human TGF-β1 and antibodies specific to mouse albumin were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Matrigel™, mouse type I collagen, and mouse type IV collagen were obtained from BD Biosciences (Bedford, MA). E-cadherin antibodies were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Alexa Fluor 488 and 568-labeled secondary antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes (West Grove, PA). FSP1 antibodies are a gift from Dr. Eric G. Neilson.Mice—C57BL/6 mice and CD1 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Cambridge, MA). Alb1Cre and R26RstoplacZ transgenes were described previously (23Postic C. Shiota M. Niswender K.D. Jetton T.L. Chen Y. Moates J.M. Shelton K.D. Lindner J. Cherrington A.D. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 305-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar, 24Mao X. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5037-5042Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In AlbCre and R26RstoplacZ double transgenic mice, the stop codon of the lacZ gene, which is ubiquitously expressed under the control of the Rosa promoter, is deleted upon expression of Cre recombinase. Because in AlbCre mice, the Cre recombinase is expressed in hepatocytes, the lacZ gene is irreversibly expressed in all cells of hepatocyte origin in livers of AlbCre; R26RstoplacZ double transgenic mice. To obtain Alb1Cre; R26stoplacZ mice matings were set up between AlbCre-positive and homozygous R26RstoplacZ mice. All mice were housed under standard conditions in the animal facility of the BIDMC. All experiments were conducted with the ethical approval of the institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.Administration of rhBMP7—rhBMP7 (300 μg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally to mice every other day, starting 1 day prior (prevention) or 2 weeks after the first injection of CCl4 (intervention) for the entire duration of the study (6 weeks). rhBMP7 was a research gift from Curis, Inc.Isolation of Primary Mouse Hepatocytes—We used a new method (modified) to isolate primary mouse hepatocytes with insignificant contamination with stellate cells (25Wang Y.J. Li M.D. Wang Y.M. Ding J. Nie Q.H. World J. Gastroenterol. 1998; 4: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Livers of C57BL/6 mice were perfused through the portal vein with HBSS buffer, which contained 10 units/ml heparin. The livers were removed from the mice and were perfused with HBSS buffer, containing 0.0025% type I collagenase and 0.075% CaCl2 for 30 min at 25 °C. Then they were triturated and digested for an additional 30 min at 25 °C in HBSS, containing type I collagenase. The liver suspension was filtered through an 80 micron sieve and the collected solution was sedimented for 20 min. To avoid contamination of hepatocytes with stellate cells, we used an additional purification step. The cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium and an equal volume of Nycodenz (18% w/v) was added. The suspension was then centrifuged for 30 min at 1,200 × g. The interface containing stellate cells was discarded, and the sedimented hepatocytes were washed three times in Ham F12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The hepatocytes were then added onto a Matrigel-coated dish in F12 medium, containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 μg/ml insulin. The purity of the hepatocytes was screened by morphology of viable cells and confirmed by albumin staining. Primary hepatocyte cultures utilized in the present study were 97% pure as determined by morphology and immunocytochemistry. To exclude potential contamination by significant numbers of stellate cells, the cells were double-stained for the expression of albumin and FSP1. About 97% of all cells were just positive for albumin expression.Induction of EMT in Vitro—Primary mouse hepatocytes (1 × 106/dish) were cultured for 48 h in F12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 μg/ml insulin until they had adhered. To induce EMT, the media was replaced with F12 media supplemented with 0.5% fetal bovine serum and 2 μg/ml insulin containing TGF-β1 for 48 h.Migration Assay—Migration assays using a Boyden chamber were performed as previously described (26Zeisberg M. Maeshima Y. Mosterman B. Kalluri R. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 160: 2001-2008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bottom wells of chamber were filled with F12 medium containing supplements according to the specific experimental protocol. 20,000 freshly isolated hepatocytes were added to each well in the upper chamber and the Boyden chamber was incubated at 37 °C for 6 h or 48 h, to allow possible migration of cells into the lower chamber. Membranes were stained with Hema3® stain according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (Biochemical Sciences, Inc., Swedesboro, NJ). Cells that migrated through the membrane were counted using a counting grid, which was fitted into an eyepiece of a phase contrast microscope. All experiments were repeated at least three times.Immunocytochemistry—EMT in primary mouse hepatocytes was visualized by immunofluorescent double staining with antibodies to albumin, FSP1, β-galactosidase and E-cadherin as described with minor modifications (27Zeisberg M. Bonner G. Maeshima Y. Colorado P. Muller G.A. Strutz F. Kalluri R. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 1313-1321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed with acetone at 4 °C and incubated for 1 h with the primary antibodies. For E-cadherin/FspI double staining experiments, the cells were fixed for 20 min in ice-cold acetone, and the slides were incubated with the primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight. Cells were then washed again and incubated for 45 min at room temperature with Alexa Fluor 488- and Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated secondary antibodies. The nuclei were counterstained using TOPRO3, and sections were covered using Vectashield mounting media (Vector, Burlingame, CA). Staining was analyzed using a confocal microscope.CCl4-induced Liver Fibrosis—Liver fibrosis was induced by CCl4 injection in mice as previously described (28Kovalovich K. DeAngelis R.A. Li W. Furth E.E. Ciliberto G. Taub R. Hepatology. 2000; 31: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Briefly, C57BL/6 mice were injected with CCl4 (250 μl of 20% v/v CCl4) intraperitoneally twice a week. Mice were sacrificed after 4 weeks and their livers were harvested. The tissue was fixed in 10% formalin for histopathology or snap-frozen in Tissue-Tek™ for immunohistochemistry. We started treatment with 300 μg/kg rhBMP7, which was determined as the optimum dose in several animal studies the day before the first CCl4 injection (prevention study) or 2 weeks after the first CCl4 injection (intervention trial) as previously reported (19Zeisberg M. Hanai J. Sugimoto H. Mammoto T. Charytan D. Strutz F. Kalluri R. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 964-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar, 29Zeisberg M. Bottiglio C. Kumar N. Maeshima Y. Strutz F. Muller G.A. Kalluri R. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285 (-F1067): F1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). RhBMP7 was administered by intraperitoneal injections every other day until week six (n = 6 mice per group), when the mice were sacrificed and livers and serum were obtained.Tissue Preparation and Histological Assessment of Liver Fibrosis—The livers were removed, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and cut in cross-sections of about 3 mm. Of each liver one piece of tissue was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and embedded in paraffin for morphometric analysis. The other piece was embedded in OCT and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen to perform immunohistochemistry. Paraffin embedded tissue was cut into 5-μm thick cross-sections, and sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and Masson’s trichrome. To quantify liver fibrosis, three independent Masson’s trichrome-stained sections were analyzed from each mouse, using a counting grid. The percent area of liver fibrosis was calculated as previously described (30Takemoto M. Egashira K. Tomita H. Usui M. Okamoto H. Kitabatake A. Shimokawa H. Sueishi K. Takeshita A. Hypertension. 1997; 30: 1621-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar).Immunofluorescence Staining—We performed immunofluorescence staining as previously described (29Zeisberg M. Bottiglio C. Kumar N. Maeshima Y. Strutz F. Muller G.A. Kalluri R. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285 (-F1067): F1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Frozen tissue was cut into 5-μm thick cross-sections which were fixed in 100% acetone at -20 °C for 10 min. We incubated the sections with primary antibodies FSP-1 (31Strutz F. Okada H. Lo C.W. Danoff T. Carone R.L. Tomaszewski J.E. Neilson E.G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar), LacZ (Alpha Diagnostics), Collagen III (Southern Biotechnology) or α-smooth muscle actin (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. After the sections were washed with Tris-buffered saline, they were subsequently stained with secondary antibodies. The nuclei were counter-stained with DAPI (Vectashield) for fluorescence microscopy or with TOPRO-3 (Molecular Probes) for confocal microscopy. FSP-1 antibody was a gift from E. G. Neilson (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN).Staining Analysis—Relative stained area was assessed using NIH ImageJ software as described in our previous publications (32Zeisberg M. Khurana M. Rao V.H. Cosgrove D. Rougier J.P. Werner M.C. Shield C.F. Werb Z. Kalluri R. PLoS Med. 2006; 3: e100Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). For quantification of FSP1-positive and FSP1/β-gal double-positive cells a total of 1000 cells were evaluated for each group.LacZ Staining—Liver tissue (∼1 mm3) were fixed in 4% PFA at 4 °C for 60 min, washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated at 37 °C in 1 mg/ml X-gal (Sigma), 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% sodium deoxycholate in phosphate-buffered saline for 72 h. Tissues were mounted in paraffin and counterstained with eosin.Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemistry of 10% formaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded liver sections was performed as described previously with minor modifications (33Zeisberg E.M. Ma Q. Juraszek A.L. Moses K. Schwartz R.J. Izumo S. Pu W.T. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 1522-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Briefly, sections were de-paraffinized and microwaved in Antigen Unmasking Solution (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Immunohistochemical staining was performed using primary antibodies to Alk2 (R&D systems), Alk3 (R&D Systems) and Alk-6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and the Vector Alkaline-phosphatase immunoassay kit (Vector Laboratories). Positive staining was visualized with the Vector Alkaline Phosphatase Substrate Kit I, and sections were counterstained with methylene-green.Albumin ELISA—Serum albumin was determined using an ELISA kit (Alpha Diagnostics, San Antonio, TX) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Briefly, serum samples were diluted 1:70,000 in sample diluent. The precoated ELISA plate was incubated with 20 μl of the diluted samples for 60 min at room temperature, followed by vigorous washing and incubation with a secondary antibody-horseradish peroxidase conjugate solution. After washing horseradish peroxidase-substrate solution was added, and color development was assessed by measurement of the absorbance at 450 nm using an ELISA reader. The serum albumin concentration was calculated by plotting the net absorbance values against appropriate albumin standard concentrations. The normal value for serum albumin in C57BL/6 mice, assessed by testing 25 different adult C57BL/6 mice sera samples, was 20.3 mg/ml.Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as means ± S.E. Multiple comparisons were performed by one-way analysis of variance. p values lower than 0.05 were considered significant.RESULTSAccumulation of FSP1-positive Fibroblasts in Liver Fibrosis—The key mediators of liver fibrosis are activated fibroblasts, which are traditionally detected by means of α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) expression (1Friedman S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2247-2250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1877) Google Scholar, 34Bissell D.M. J. Gastroenterol. 1998; 33: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, recent studies in the setting of fibrosis in kidney, solid tumors, lung, and skin reveal that the heterogeneity of activated fibroblasts is greater than commonly believed (35Kalluri R. Zeisberg M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 392-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (3468) Google Scholar). FSP1-positive fibroblasts (characterized by their expression of fibroblast specific protein 1, a member of the S100 family of calcium-binding proteins), is one class of fibroblasts present in many tissues (17Iwano M. Plieth D. Danoff T.M. Xue C. Okada H. Neilson E.G. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar, 36Okada H. Inoue T. Kanno Y. Kobayashi T. Ban S. Kalluri R. Suzuki H. Kidney Int. 2001; 60: 597-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To gain insights into the contribution of FSP1-positive fibroblasts to liver fibrosis, we established a disease progression curve by sacrificing cohorts of mice with CCl4-induced liver fibrosis at various time points after initial injection of CCl4 (2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, n = 6 in each group) (Fig. 1). In control livers, few FSP1-positive fibroblasts are noticed, predominantly surrounding central veins and within the periportal region (Fig. 1A). Immunofluorescence double-labeling experiments using antibodies specific to FSP1 and Collagen III revealed that FSP1-positive fibroblasts accumulate during fibrosis progression, predominantly in areas of collagen III deposition (Fig. 1, A-C). Experiments in which liver sections were double-labeled with antibodies to αSMA and FSP1 reveal that these two markers rarely co-localize (Fig. 1, D-I). In control livers, αSMA expression is restricted to vascular smooth muscle cells, distinct from the FSP1-positive cells (Fig. 1, D-G). During early stages of liver fibrosis (after 2 weeks of CCl4 administration), both αSMA-positive cells and FSP1-positive cells increase in numbers, but do not overlap (Fig. 1, E and H). During advanced stages of fibrosis (after 6 weeks of CCl4 administration), both αSMA-positive cells and FSP1-positive cells substantially accumulate in the areas of fibrotic septae (Fig. 1, F and I). However, only ∼10% of FSP1-positive cells are also positive for αSMA (Fig. 1I).TGF-β1 Induces EMT in Primary Mouse Hepatocytes—FSP1-positive fibroblasts have been well-characterized in fibrogenesis in kidney, lung, and solid tumors. As opposed to αSMA fibroblasts, which predominantly derive via activation of resident stellate cells and fibroblasts or via shedding from vascular smooth muscle cells, FSP1-positive fibroblasts have been shown to derive by a significant extend from resident epithelia via epithelial-mesenchymal transition. We hypothesized that hepatocytes could contribute to the pool of FSP1-positive fibroblasts in the setting of liver fibrosis. TGF-β1 is considered to be the principal mediator of liver fibrosis (37Bissell D.M. Roulot D. George J. Hepatology. 2001; 34: 859-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 38Canbay A. Higuchi H. Bronk S.F. Taniai M. Sebo T.J. Gores G.J. Gastroenterology. 2002; 123: 1323-1330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), and it is the most potent inducer of EMT in different organ systems (39Miettinen P.J. Ebner R. Lopez A.R. Derynck R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 2021-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar, 40Bhowmick N.A. Ghiassi M. Bakin A. Aakre M. Lundquist C.A. Engel M.E. Arteaga C.L. Moses H.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the capacity of TGF-β1 to induce EMT in primary cultures of adult mouse hepatocytes (41George J. Roulot D. Koteliansky V.E. Bissell D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12719-12724Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar).In the absence of growth factors, 97% of cells isolated from adult mouse livers were albumin-positive hepatocytes (see methods). FSP1 staining and αSMA staining was negligible (less than 3% of the cells) (Fig. 2A-C). After exposure of these primary mouse hepatocytes to 3 ng/ml of human TGF-β1 for 48 h (optimum stimulus for the induction of EMT in several different epithelial systems), the albumin-positive cells also uniformly express FSP1 (Fig. 2, D-F). The negligible number of albumin negative cells (< 3% of the cells) did not increase. After 96 h of TGF-β1 incubation, albumin staining was lost and the cells were uniformly spindle-shaped and positive for FSP1, typical of an EMT-derived fibroblast (Fig. 2, G-K). Gain of FSP1 expression upon exposure to TGF-β1 also coincided with decreased staining for the epithelial marker E-cadherin (Fig. 2, L-Q) The findings suggest that after 48 h of TGF-β1 incubation an intermediate phenotype (positive staining for both the hepatocyte marker and fibroblast marker) is observed, whereas after 96 h a more complete EMT occurs.FIGURE 2De novo FSP1 expression in albumin-positive hepatocytes. A-I, to demonstrate the induction of EMT, primary mouse hepatocytes were stimulated with TGF-β1(3 ng/ml) and double-labeled with antibodies specific for albumin (hepatocyte marker) and FSP1 (fibroblast marker) after 48 h and 96 h. Nuclei were visualized using TOPRO-3 staining. The pictures display representative photomicrographs, which were acquired by confocal microscopy at an original magnification of ×60. Whereas FSP1 staining was absent in control hepatocytes (A-C), hepatocytes were positive for both albumin and FSP1 after 48 h (F). After 96 h, albumin staining was neglible (G-I).

https://openalex.org/W2006444511,"Carcinoma progression is associated with the loss of epithelial features, and the acquisition of mesenchymal characteristics and invasive properties by tumour cells. The loss of cell–cell contacts may be the first step of the epithelium mesenchyme transition (EMT) and involves the functional inactivation of the cell–cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin. Repression of E-cadherin expression by the transcription factor Snail is a central event during the loss of epithelial phenotype. Akt kinase activation is frequent in human carcinomas, and Akt regulates various cellular mechanisms including EMT. Here, we show that Snail activation and consequent repression of E-cadherin may depend on AKT-mediated nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation, and that NF-κB induces Snail expression. Expression of the NF-κB subunit p65 is sufficient for EMT induction, validating this signalling module during EMT. NF-κB pathway activation is associated with tumour progression and metastasis of several human tumour types; E-cadherin acts as a metastasis suppressor protein. Thus, this signalling and transcriptional network linking AKT, NF-κB, Snail and E-cadherin during EMT is a potential target for antimetastatic therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2018423808,"Tau in Alzheimer disease brain is highly phosphorylated and aggregated into paired helical filaments comprising characteristic neurofibrillary tangles. Here we have analyzed insoluble Tau (PHF-tau) extracted from Alzheimer brain by mass spectrometry and identified 11 novel phosphorylation sites, 10 of which were assigned unambiguously to specific amino acid residues. This brings the number of directly identified sites in PHF-tau to 39, with an additional six sites indicated by reactivity with phosphospecific antibodies to Tau. We also identified five new phosphorylation sites in soluble Tau from control adult human brain, bringing the total number of reported sites to nine. To assess which kinases might be responsible for Tau phosphorylation, we used mass spectrometry to determine which sites were phosphorylated in vitro by several kinases. Casein kinase 1delta and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta were each found to phosphorylate numerous sites, and each kinase phosphorylated at least 15 sites that are also phosphorylated in PHF-tau from Alzheimer brain. A combination of casein kinase 1delta and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta activities could account for over three-quarters of the serine/threonine phosphorylation sites identified in PHF-tau, indicating that casein kinase 1delta may have a role, together with glycogen synthase kinase-3beta, in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease."
https://openalex.org/W2120250790,"Spider dragline (major ampullate) silk outperforms virtually all other natural and manmade materials in terms of tensile strength and toughness. For this reason, the mass-production of artificial spider silks through transgenic technologies has been a major goal of biomimetics research. Although all known arthropod silk proteins are extremely large (>200 kiloDaltons), recombinant spider silks have been designed from short and incomplete cDNAs, the only available sequences. Here we describe the first full-length spider silk gene sequences and their flanking regions. These genes encode the MaSp1 and MaSp2 proteins that compose the black widow's high-performance dragline silk. Each gene includes a single enormous exon (>9000 base pairs) that translates into a highly repetitive polypeptide. Patterns of variation among sequence repeats at the amino acid and nucleotide levels indicate that the interaction of selection, intergenic recombination, and intragenic recombination governs the evolution of these highly unusual, modular proteins. Phylogenetic footprinting revealed putative regulatory elements in non-coding flanking sequences. Conservation of both upstream and downstream flanking sequences was especially striking between the two paralogous black widow major ampullate silk genes. Because these genes are co-expressed within the same silk gland, there may have been selection for similarity in regulatory regions. Our new data provide complete templates for synthesis of recombinant silk proteins that significantly improve the degree to which artificial silks mimic natural spider dragline fibers."
https://openalex.org/W1977312265,"Background Chikungunya (CHIK) virus is a mosquito-transmitted alphavirus that causes in humans an acute infection characterised by fever, polyarthralgia, head-ache, and myalgia. Since 2005, the emergence of CHIK virus was associated with an unprecedented magnitude outbreak of CHIK disease in the Indian Ocean. Clinically, this outbreak was characterized by invalidating poly-arthralgia, with myalgia being reported in 97.7% of cases. Since the cellular targets of CHIK virus in humans are unknown, we studied the pathogenic events and targets of CHIK infection in skeletal muscle. Methodology/Principal Findings Immunohistology on muscle biopsies from two CHIK virus-infected patients with myositic syndrome showed that viral antigens were found exclusively inside skeletal muscle progenitor cells (designed as satelllite cells), and not in muscle fibers. To evaluate the ability of CHIK virus to replicate in human satellite cells, we assessed virus infection on primary human muscle cells; viral growth was observed in CHIK virus-infected satellite cells with a cytopathic effect, whereas myotubes were essentially refractory to infection. Conclusions/Significance This report provides new insights into CHIK virus pathogenesis, since it is the first to identify a cellular target of CHIK virus in humans and to report a selective infection of muscle satellite cells by a viral agent in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2159193896,"The mineral in bone is located primarily within the collagen fibril, and during mineralization the fibril is formed first and then water within the fibril is replaced with mineral. The collagen fibril therefore provides the aqueous compartment in which mineral grows. Although knowledge of the size of molecules that can diffuse into the fibril to affect crystal growth is critical to understanding the mechanism of bone mineralization, there have been as yet no studies on the size exclusion properties of the collagen fibril. To determine the size exclusion characteristics of collagen, we developed a gel filtration-like procedure that uses columns containing collagen from tendon and bone. The elution volumes of test molecules show the volume within the packed column that is accessible to the test molecules, and therefore reveal the size exclusion characteristics of the collagen within the column. These experiments show that molecules smaller than a 6-kDa protein diffuse into all of the water within the collagen fibril, whereas molecules larger than a 40-kDa protein are excluded from this water. These studies provide an insight into the mechanism of bone mineralization. Molecules and apatite crystals smaller than a 6-kDa protein can diffuse into all water within the fibril and so can directly impact mineralization. Although molecules larger than a 40-kDa protein are excluded from the fibril, they can initiate mineralization by forming small apatite crystal nuclei that diffuse into the fibril, or can favor fibril mineralization by inhibiting apatite growth everywhere but within the fibril."

Here, we have provided several lines of evidence to demonstrate that mitofusin-2 (Mfn-2; also called hyperplasia suppressor gene), a member of the mitofusin family, is a major determinant of oxidative stress-mediated cardiomyocyte apoptosis. First, oxidative stress with H2O2 led to concurrent increases in Mfn-2 expression and apoptosis in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Second, overexpression of Mfn-2 to a level similar to that induced by H2O2 was sufficient to trigger myocyte apoptosis, which is associated with profound inhibition of Akt activation without altering ERK1/2 signaling. Third, Mfn-2 silencing inhibited oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in H9C2 cells, a cardiac muscle cell line. Furthermore, Mfn-2-induced myocyte apoptosis was abrogated by inhibition of caspase-9 (but not caspase-8) and by overexpression of Bcl-xL or enhanced activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt, suggesting that inhibition of Akt signaling and activation of the mitochondrial death pathway are essentially involved in Mfn-2-induced heart muscle cell apoptosis. These results indicate that increased cardiac Mfn-2 expression is both necessary and sufficient for oxidative stress-induced heart muscle cell apoptosis, suggesting that Mfn-2 deregulation may be a crucial pathogenic element and a potential therapeutic target for heart failure.

An imbalance between cell survival and cell death signaling pathways triggers either proliferative or degenerative disorders, diseases in which apoptosis (or programmed cell death) can be either abnormally blocked or undesirably activated. In this regard, Ras plays a central role in the regulation of cell fate, including cell proliferation, differentiation, senescence, and survival or apoptosis. In particular, Ras-mediated activation of Akt has emerged as a focal point for signal transduction pathways promoting cell survival, whereas Ras-activated ERK1/2 4The abbreviations used are: ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; Mfn-2, mitofusin-2; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; FBS, fetal bovine serum; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling; Adv-GFP, adenovirus expressing green fluorescent protein; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; Adv-CA-PI3K, adenovirus expressing a constitutively active phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase mutant; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase. and Akt signaling cascades drive cell cycle progression (1Jun T.

Barbacid M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). Thus, dysfunction of Ras signaling pathways has been implicated in a multitude of degenerative and proliferative diseases. Originally, Ras was identified as a viral oncogene because of its causal relationship with various cancers (3Malumbres M. Barbacid M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). Over the past decade, increasing evidence has, however, placed Ras signaling at the center of pathways for diverse cardiovascular diseases such as congestive heart failure, hypertensive vascular proliferative growth, and endothelial dysfunction (4Chien K.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 2002; 110: 153-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We have recently identified a powerful endogenous Ras inhibitor, mitofusin-2 (Mfn-2), also named hyperplasia suppressor gene because of its anti-proliferative effects (5Chen K-H. Guo X. Ma D. Guo Y.

Although previous studies have shown that human Mfn-2 and its homologs localize to the mitochondrial outer membrane and play an essential role in mitochondrial fusion, thus regulating mitochondrial morphology and function (6Hales K.G.

In addition to its anti-proliferative effects, previous studies have shown that Mfn-2 associates with Bax, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family (12Green D.R.

In contrast, emerging evidence suggests a protective effect of Mfn-2 in mammalian cells. For instance, a dominant-active form of Mfn-2 (promoting mitochondrial fusion) protects against Bax-mediated cytochrome c release and reduces free radical-mediated mitochondrial injury (11Neuspiel M. Zunino R. Gangaraju S. Rippstein P. McBride H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25060-25070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), whereas a dominant-negative form of Mfn-2 (inhibiting mitochondrial fusion) causes loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and fragmentation of mitochondria (15Santel A. Frank S. Gaume B. Herrler M. Youle R.J. Fuller M.T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2763-2774Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of both Mfn-1 and Mfn-2 provides some protection against apoptotic stimuli (16Sugioka R. Shimizu S. Tsujimoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52726-52734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). This phenomenon has been interpreted to indicate that high levels of fused mitochondria might constitute a cell defense mechanism against the accumulation of oxidative lesions. It is also noteworthy that some pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, including Bax and Bak (17Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3373) Google Scholar), participate in mitochondrial fusion via their interaction with Mfn-2, indicating that Bax and Bak are required for normal morphogenesis of mitochondria (18Karbowski M. Norris K.L. Cleland M.M. Jeong S.Y. Youle R.J. Nature. 2006; 443: 658-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The functionally opposing roles of Bax and Bak in normal cells versus those in apoptotic cells suggest that Bax and Bak might undergo conformational change between anti- and pro-apoptotic conformations to regulate both mitochondrial morphology and apoptosis (18Karbowski M. Norris K.L. Cleland M.M. Jeong S.Y. Youle R.J. Nature. 2006; 443: 658-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it still remains highly controversial as to whether Mfn-2 promotes cell survival or apoptosis. Of all cell types and tissues, Mfn-2 is expressed predominantly in the heart (5Chen K-H. Guo X. Ma D. Guo Y. Li O. Yang D. Li P. Qiu X. Wen S. Xiao R.-P. Tang, J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 872-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), but its functional role in cardiac myocytes is poorly understood. Here, we sought to determine whether Mfn-2 plays an essential role in regulating the fate of heart muscle cells (survival or death) and, if so, to explore the underlying mechanism. Our results indicate that increased cardiac Mfn-2 expression is both necessary and sufficient for oxidative stress-induced heart muscle cell apoptosis, suggesting that Mfn-2 deregulation may be a crucial pathogenic element and a potential therapeutic target for heart failure. Isolation, Culture, and Adenoviral Infection of Cardiac Myocytes—Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes were isolated from 1-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats by the method described previously (19Chesley A.

Cardiac myocytes were plated at a density of 6.6 × 104 cells/cm2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in the presence of 0.1 mm 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine. The purity of these cultures was >98% cardiac myocytes as indexed by positive staining of smooth muscle α-actin. Adenovirus-mediated gene transfer was implemented after 24 h of quiescence in serum-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium following 48 h of culture in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% FBS. Real-time PCR—Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using the DNA Engine Opticon system (MJ Research) in combination with SYBR Green (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) as described previously (5Chen K-H.

Briefly, total RNA was extracted using TriReagent (Sigma). 1.5 μg of RNA was then reverse-transcribed to first-strand cDNA using oligo(dT) primer and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega Corp.) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The primers used were as follows: Mfn-2, 5′-CTCAGGAGCAGCGGGTTTATTGTCT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGTCGAGGGACCAGCATGTCTATCT-3′ (reverse), producing a 412-bp fragment; and 18 S RNA, 5′-GGAAGGGCACCACCAGGAGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGCAGCCCCGGACATCTAAG-3′ (reverse). The PCR profile was as follows: 95 °C for 30 s and 35 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The amount of SYBR Green was measured at the end of each cycle. The cycle number at which the emission intensity of the sample rose above the base line is referred to as the threshold cycle and was proportional to the target concentration. The data presented are the average of four independent experiments. Western Blotting—Western blotting to assess protein abundance of Mfn-2 was performed with an affinity-purified anti-chicken Mfn-2 primary antibody (GenWay Biotech, Inc., San Diego, California) as described previously (5Chen K-H.

In subset experiments, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt was measured with anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK Thr202/Tyr204 antibody or anti-phospho-Akt Ser473 antibody (Cell Signaling Biotechnology, Inc.) as described previously (19Chesley A.

MitoTracker Red Labeling and Confocal Imaging—Neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were infected with adenovirus expressing green fluorescent protein (Adv-GFP; a control virus) or Adv-Mfn-2 at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 100. After 24–48 h of infection, cells were incubated in serum-free medium containing 0.2 μm MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes) at 37 °C for 20 min and then washed twice. The intact (unfixed) cardiomyocytes were imaged with a Zeiss 510 inverted confocal microscope with a ×40 numerical aperture 1.3 oil immersion lens. DNA Laddering—Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.4% SDS, and 100 μg/ml protease K) after adenoviral infection for 48 h; incubated at 50 °C for 5 h with gentle agitation; and then extracted with phenol/CHCl3/isoamyl alcohol, followed by CHCl3/isoamyl alcohol. DNA fragmentation was detected by loading 10 μg of total DNA onto 2% agarose gel in Tris acetate/EDTA buffer and visualized by ethidium bromide staining as described previously (21Zhu W-Z. Zheng M.

H9C2 cells were transfected with Oligofectamine (Lifetech) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cytochrome c in Cytosolic and Mitochondrial Fractions—Release of cytochrome c was measured using a cytochrome c release Apoptosis Assay kit (Oncogene) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cells were lysed in cytosol extract buffer and homogenized 40 times. After centrifugation, the supernatant was collected as a cytosolic fraction, and the pellet was resuspended as a mitochondrial fraction (see Fig. 4A). Cytochrome c was detected by Western blotting with an anti-cytochrome c antibody. Materials—Unless indicated otherwise, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma. The caspase-9 inhibitor Z-LEHD-FMK and the caspase-8 inhibitor Z-IE(OMe)TD(OMe)-FMK were purchased from Calbiochem. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical comparisons used one-way analysis of variance, followed by Bonferroni’s procedure for multiple-group comparisons. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Oxidative Stress Elevates Endogenous Mfn-2 Gene Expression and Triggers Apoptosis in Cultured Cardiomyocytes—Mounting evidence has demonstrated that reactive oxygen species-mediated oxidative stress plays a major role in apoptotic cell death (23Jacobson M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 83-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar) and that reactive oxygen species formation is greatly increased in heart failure and initiates myocyte apoptosis, thus contributing to the development of heart failure (24Cesselli D.

Fig. 1A illustrates the time course of endogenous Mfn-2 gene expression (quantified by real-time PCR) in response to H2O2 (200 μm). The increase in Mfn-2 mRNA abundance occurred after 4 h of treatment, reached its maximum at 8 h, and then declined to a sustained 2-fold increase for at least 24 h. Fig. 1B shows a typical example and the average dose response of H2O2-induced augmentation of Mfn-2 protein abundance in cells after 24 h of treatment. It is noteworthy that H2O2 (200 μm) profoundly promoted myocyte apoptosis, as evidenced by a 6.2-fold increase in TUNEL staining-positive cells (Fig. 1C) and severe DNA fragmentation revealed by DNA laddering assay (Fig. 1D). The apoptotic nuclei appeared blue by TUNEL staining, with a varying degree of chromatin condensation and fragmentation (Fig. 1C). Similarly, serum starvation, hypoxia, or simulated ischemia also concurrently augmented Mfn-2 gene expression and myocyte apoptosis (data not shown). These results indicate that Mfn-2 expression is markedly induced by various death-inducing stimuli, particularly oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes, and that severe heart muscle cell apoptosis is accompanied by elevated Mfn-2 expression. Up-regulation of Mfn-2 Is Sufficient to Trigger Cardiac Myocyte Apoptosis—To determine whether up-regulation of Mfn-2 alone is sufficient to trigger heart muscle cell apoptotic death, we overexpressed Mfn-2 to a level (2.35 ± 0.47-fold over the base line; n = 4) similar to that induced by oxidative stress (Fig. 1B) in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes using adenoviral gene transfer (Fig. 2A). Infection of cardiomyocytes with Adv-Mfn-2 (m.o.i. = 100) displayed a time-dependent decrease in cell viability compared with uninfected cells or those infected with a control virus, Adv-GFP (m.o.i. = 100) (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, DNA fragmentation (assayed by DNA laddering) was detected in myocytes infected with Adv-Mfn-2, but not in uninfected or Adv-GFP-infected cells (Fig. 2C). The apoptotic effect of Mfn-2 was further manifested by Mfn-2-induced increases in chromatin condensation and fragmentation revealed by both Hoechst (Fig. 2D) and TUNEL staining (Fig. 2E). On average, the percentage of apoptotic cardiomyocytes was increased by 2–3-fold in cells infected with Adv-Mfn-2 relative to those infected with Adv-GFP (both at m.o.i. = 100 for 48 h) (Fig. 2, D and E). Similar results were observed in cultured adult rat cardiac myocytes, vascular smooth muscle cells, and several cancer cell lines (data not shown). Thus, excessive Mfn-2 expression is sufficient to trigger cell apoptosis. Mfn-2 Silencing Blocks Oxidative Stress-induced Apoptosis in a Cardiac Cell Line (H9C2 Cells)—Next, we sought to determine whether Mfn-2 is necessary for oxidative stress-induced apoptosis using siRNA-mediated silencing of Mfn-2 in H9C2 cells, a rat cardiac muscle cell line, because siRNA transfection efficiency is greater in H9C2 cells than in primary cultured rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. Fig. 3 (A and B) illustrates that Mfn-2 siRNA (siRNA+), but not the scrambled siRNA (siRNA-; used as a negative control), substantially reduced basal Mfn-2 protein abundance and prevented H2O2-induced up-regulation of Mfn-2. More important, Mfn-2 siRNA fully protected H9C2 cells against H2O2-induced apoptosis, as assayed by DNA laddering (Fig. 3C) and Hoechst staining (data not shown), indicating that Mfn-2 up-regulation is required for oxidative stress-induced heart muscle cell apoptosis. Mfn-2 Increases Mitochondrial Cytochrome c Release and Activates Caspase-9 and Caspase-3—As is the case for most cells, upstream apoptotic signaling is often classified into two general pathways: the death ligand receptor-mediated pathway involving activation of caspase-8 and its downstream executioner caspases and the mitochondrial pathway (or the intrinsic pathway) involving sequentially the release of cytochrome c, the recruitment of Apaf-1 (apoptotic protease-activating factor-1), and the activation of caspase-9 and downstream executioner caspases (27Wajant H. Science. 2002; 296: 1635-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 28Jiang X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 87-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). We sought to determine the signaling pathways involved in Mfn-2-mediated cardiomyocyte apoptosis. First, we found that cytosolic cytochrome c was markedly elevated in cells infected with Adv-Mfn-2 relative to cells infected with Adv-GFP (m.o.i. = 100 for 36 h for both groups) (Fig. 4, A and B). Moreover, we treated cardiomyocytes with either caspase-8 or caspase-9 inhibitor for 48 h to distinguish between the mitochondrion-dependent and -independent pathways. The caspase-9 inhibitor Z-LEHD-FMK effectively abrogated Mfn-2-induced DNA fragmentation (Fig. 4C) and the increase in Hoechst staining-positive cells (Fig. 4D), indicating that caspase-9 plays a crucial role in Mfn-2-evoked apoptotic signaling. In contrast, inhibition of caspase-8 with Z-IE(OMe)TD(OMe)-FMK had no detectable effect in either assay (Fig. 4, C and D). Furthermore, both caspase-9 and caspase-3 were overtly activated in cells overexpressing Mfn-2, as evidenced by increases in cleaved procaspase-9 and procaspase-3 (Fig. 4E). In addition, adenoviral gene transfer of a mitochondrial anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-xL (12Green D.R.

These results indicate that elevated Mfn-2 triggers myocyte apoptosis by the primary mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Overexpression of Mfn-2 Inhibits Activation of Akt (but Not ERK1/2) in Cardiomyocytes—Because our recent studies have shown that Mfn-2 binds to Ras and inhibits Ras-activated MAPK signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells and cancer cell lines (5Chen K-H. Guo X. Ma D. Guo Y. Li O. Yang D. Li P. Qiu X. Wen S. Xiao R.-P. Tang, J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 872-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), here we examined the potential effect of Mfn-2 on the Ras-ERK1/2 MAPK pathway in cultured cardiac myocytes. Surprisingly, overexpression of Mfn-2 had no detectable effect on either basal or 10% FBS-induced activation of ERK1/2 in cultured rat neonatal cardiac myocytes (Fig. 5A). Thus, Mfn-2-mediated cardiomyocyte apoptosis is unlikely attributable to inhibition of ERK1/2 MAPK signaling despite its essential role in Mfn-2-induced anti-proliferation in vascular smooth muscle cells (5Chen K-H. Guo X. Ma D. Guo Y. Li O. Yang D. Li P. Qiu X. Wen S. Xiao R.-P. Tang, J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 872-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Next, we examined the possibility that Mfn-2 triggers cell apoptosis by suppressing other Ras-dependent cell survival signals. To this end, we defined the possible effect of Mfn-2 on the Ras-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway, which is crucially involved in the regulation of cell survival as well as cell proliferation (31Chen W.S. Xu P.Z. Gottlob K. Chen M.L. Sokol K. Shiyanova T. Roninson I. Weng W. Suzuki R. Tobe K. Kadowaki T. Hay N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2203-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar, 32Brunet A. Datta S.R. Greenberg M.E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). Unlike ERK1/2, both basal and mitogenic stimulus-induced activation of Akt was markedly attenuated by overexpression of Mfn-2 in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Fig. 5B illustrates that Mfn-2 overexpression profoundly suppressed basal phosphorylation of Akt in a titer-dependent manner without altering total Akt protein abundance. Moreover, serum-mediated Akt phosphorylation was also largely abrogated in cells infected with Adv-Mfn-2 (m.o.i. = 100) (Fig. 5, C and D). Furthermore, coexpression of a constitutively active PI3K mutant (Adv-CA-PI3K) increased PI3K-mediated Akt activation (Fig. 5E) and abolished Mfn-2-induced DNA fragmentation in the co-infected cells (Fig. 5F). Used as a negative control, coexpression of a control gene, β-galactosidase, did not affect Mfn-2-mediated cardiomyocyte apoptosis (Fig. 5F). These results suggest that inhibition of the Ras-evoked PI3K-Akt cell survival signal constitutes a primary mechanism responsible for Mfn-2-mediated heart muscle cell apoptosis in the context of myocardial oxidative stress. Mfn-2 Apoptotic Effect Is Independent of Mfn-2-induced Alterations in Mitochondrial Morphology—To address whether Mfn-2-induced cell death is causally related to mitochondrial dynamics, we visualized living cell mitochondrial morphology under various experimental conditions by confocal microscopic imaging of cells incubated with 0.2 μm MitoTracker Red CMXRos at 37 °C for 20 min. Interestingly, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of Mfn-2 led to mitochondrial perinuclear clustering (24-h infection) and elongation and networks (36- and 48-h infections) (Fig. 6, B and C), instead of fragmentation, although under the same experimental conditions, overexpression of Mfn-2 triggered myocyte apoptosis (Figs. 2 and 4). To further determine whether the morphological changes in mitochondria contribute to Mfn-2-mediated apoptosis, Adv-Mfn-2-infected cells were compared with those treated with H2O2 or co-infecte"
https://openalex.org/W1986348233,"Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), a ligand of the endothelium-specific receptor Tie-2, inhibits permeability in the mature vasculature, but the mechanism remains unknown. Here we show that Ang-1 signals Rho family GTPases to organize the cytoskeleton into a junction-fortifying arrangement that enhances the permeability barrier function of the endothelium. Ang-1 phosphorylates Tie-2 and its downstream effector phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. This induces activation of one endogenous GTPase, Rac1, and inhibition of another, RhoA. Loss of either part of this dual effect abrogates the cytoskeletal and anti-permeability actions of Ang-1, suggesting that coordinated GTPase regulation is necessary for the vessel-sealing effects of Ang-1. p190 RhoGAP, a GTPase regulatory protein, provides this coordinating function as it is phosphorylated by Ang-1 treatment, requires Rac1 activation, and is necessary for RhoA inhibition. Ang-1 prevents the cytoskeletal and pro-permeability effects of endotoxin but requires p190 RhoGAP to do so. Treatment with p190 RhoGAP small interfering RNA completely abolishes the ability of Ang-1 to rescue endotoxemia-induced pulmonary vascular leak and inflammation in mice. We conclude that Ang-1 prevents vascular permeability by regulating the endothelial cytoskeleton through coordinated and opposite effects on the Rho GTPases Rac1 and RhoA. By linking Rac1 activation and RhoA inhibition, p190 RhoGAP is critical to the protective effects of Ang-1 against endotoxin. These results provide mechanistic evidence that targeting the endothelium through Tie-2 may offer specific therapeutic strategies in life-threatening endotoxemic conditions such as sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Although made by numerous cell types, the actions of Ang-1 are primarily mediated by a receptor tyrosine kinase, Tie-2, whose expression is largely restricted to endothelial cells (ECs). Critical roles for Ang-1 and Tie-2 have been described in the formation of the primitive cardiac tube and embryonic vasculature (3Sato T.N. Tozawa Y. Deutsch U. Wolburg-Buchholz K. Fujiwara Y. Gendron-Maguire M. Gridley T. Wolburg H. Risau W. Qin Y. Nature. 1995; 376: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar). Although necessary for developmental angiogenesis to occur, Ang-1 expression and Tie-2 phosphorylation persist into adulthood in organs not considered angiogenically active (4Wong A.L. Haroon Z.A. Werner S. Dewhirst M.W. Greenberg C.S. Peters K.G. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), suggesting a nonangiogenic role in the mature vasculature. In fact, Ang-1 has been shown to protect adult blood vessels against plasma leakage because of vascular endothelial growth factor or mustard oil (5Thurston G. Suri C. Smith K. McClain J. Sato T.N. Yancopoulos G.D. McDonald D.M. Science. 1999; 286: 2511-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar, 6Thurston G. Rudge J.S. Ioffe E. Zhou H. Ross L. Croll S.D. Glazer N. Holash J. McDonald D.M. Yancopoulos G.D. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 460-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which Ang-1 defends against vascular leakage in vivo has remained largely unknown. Permeability is a tightly regulated feature of all vascular beds. A systemic increase in permeability, leading to a degree of vascular leak that impairs organ function, is a hallmark of sepsis, a lethal syndrome of multiorgan dysfunction that arises as a result of disseminated infection. We have previously shown that Tie-2 inhibition induces changes in the endothelial cytoskeleton that are mediated by the small GTPase RhoA and lead to increased cell contraction and enhanced vascular permeability (7Parikh S.M. Mammoto T. Schultz A. Yuan H.T. Christiani D. Karumanchi S.A. Sukhatme V.P. Plos Med. 2006; 3 (–e60): e46Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). These experiments suggest that the anti-permeability effect of activated Tie-2 may depend on endothelial cytoskeletal forces and cell architecture. Activated Tie-2 signals through PI3K (8Cho C.H. Kammerer R.A. Lee H.J. Yasunaga K. Kim K.T. Choi H.H. Kim W. Kim S.H. Park S.K. Lee G.M. Koh G.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5553-5558Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In turn, PI3K targets numerous effectors, including Akt/PKB, phospholipases, and guanine-nucleotide exchange factors that activate Rho GTPases (9Welch H.C. Coadwell W.J. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 10Wymann M.P. Marone R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Two members of the Rho family, RhoA and Rac1, have opposite effects on cells, the former induces actomyosin filament contraction that promotes actin stress fibers that increase centripetal tension throughout the cytoskeleton, and the latter counterbalances this by maintaining adherens and tight junctions between neighboring endothelial cells (11Burridge K. Wennerberg K. Cell. 2004; 116: 167-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar). Rac1 and RhoA are known to mediate opposing changes in EC permeability (the former increasing barrier function and the latter reducing barrier function) induced by a number of ligands (12Wojciak-Stothard B. Potempa S. Eichholtz T. Ridley A.J. J. Cell. Sci. 2001; 114: 1343-1355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Endotoxin increases vascular permeability by activating RhoA (13Essler M. Staddon J.M. Weber P.C. Aepfelbacher M. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 6543-6549Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 14Thorlacius K. Slotta J.E. Laschke M.W. Wang Y. Menger M.D. Jeppsson B. Thorlacius H. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2006; 79: 923-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Rho activity is regulated, in part, by the inhibitory GTPase activating protein, p190 RhoGAP (15Settleman J. Albright C.F. Foster L.C. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 153-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Rac1 down-regulates RhoA activity through p190 RhoGAP in HeLa cells (16Nimnual A.S. Taylor L.J. Bar-Sagi D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 236-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Given the known pro-permeability effect of Rho family proteins, the well described antagonistic relationship between RhoA and Rac1 in the endothelium, and our earlier findings linking Ang-2 to RhoA activation, we hypothesized that Ang-1 may activate Rac1 to achieve its anti-permeability effect. We utilized in vitro assays to elucidate a novel signaling pathway connecting Ang-1 to Rac1 and RhoA, to characterize Ang-1-mediated endothelial cytoskeletal changes, and to test the role of Rho family proteins in the Ang-1-mediated anti-permeability effect against endotoxin. Finally, we used in vivo siRNA to assess the importance of p190 RhoGAP in the pulmonary permeability response to Ang-1 and endotoxin. Animals—FVB adult mice (20–25 g) were used in accordance with an IACUC-approved protocol. Chemicals—Human recombinant Ang-1, CD14, and LPS-binding protein were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). LY294002 is from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Cell Culture—Human microvascular endothelial cells from lung (HMVEC-L) (Cambrex BioScience Walkersville, Inc., Walkersville, MD) were cultured in EBM-2 (Cambrex) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and growth factors according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All stimulation experiments were performed after serum starvation with 0.25% FBS/EBM-2 for 24 h. For endotoxin signaling experiments, we used LPS O111:B4 (100 ng/ml), CD14 (100 ng/ml), and LBP (10 ng/ml). Western Blot Analysis—HMVEC-L were lysed in ice-cold RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors, 1 mmol/liter NaF, and 1 mmol/liter Na3VO4 and prepared for Western analysis as described before (7Parikh S.M. Mammoto T. Schultz A. Yuan H.T. Christiani D. Karumanchi S.A. Sukhatme V.P. Plos Med. 2006; 3 (–e60): e46Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were anti-phospho-Akt Ab (Ser-473), anti-Akt Ab, anti-phosphomyosin light chain 2 (Ser-19) Ab (Cell Signaling Technology), and anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase Ab (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) and SuperSignal West-Dura (Pierce) chemiluminescence substrates were used to detect primary Abs. All Western blots were performed in quadruplicate unless otherwise noted. Representative examples are shown. Densitometry (ImageJ, National Institutes of Health) was used to compare results with unpaired t test. Immunoprecipitation—200 μg of total protein from HMVEC-L lysed in Triton buffer were incubated with anti-Tie-2 Ab (clone Ab33, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) or p190 RhoGAP Ab (BD Transduction Laboratories) for 3 h, followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing the beads, proteins were eluted by heating in SDS sample buffer and detected by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine (clone 4G10, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-Tie-2 Ab, or anti-p190 RhoGAP Ab. PI3K Activity Assay—After signal starvation, HMVEC-L were treated with vehicle or Ang-1 (100 ng/ml) for 15 min. Total and phosphorylated p85 subunits of PI3K were quantified using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to the manufacturer’s instruction (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). Rac1 and Rho Activity Assay—These were performed and quantified using the commercially available kit according to the manufacturer’s instruction (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO). Briefly, lysates from cells treated with Ang-1 (100 ng/ml) or inhibitor were incubated for 60 min with a 40-μl slurry of a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein composed of Rac1 or RhoA effector proteins coupled to agarose beads. After washing with lysis buffer, samples were subjected to immunoblotting and detected with anti-Rac1 or anti-RhoA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Immunocytochemistry—This assay was conducted as previously described (7Parikh S.M. Mammoto T. Schultz A. Yuan H.T. Christiani D. Karumanchi S.A. Sukhatme V.P. Plos Med. 2006; 3 (–e60): e46Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) (see Supplemental Material, Methods). In Vitro Permeability by Fluorescein Isothiocyanate-Albumin Flux—This assay was conducted as previously described (7Parikh S.M. Mammoto T. Schultz A. Yuan H.T. Christiani D. Karumanchi S.A. Sukhatme V.P. Plos Med. 2006; 3 (–e60): e46Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) (see Supplemental Material, Methods). siRNA Transfection—Control small interfering RNA (siRNA) (Ambion, Austin, TX) or siRNA directed to human p190 RhoGAP (5′-GGAUUGUGUGGAAUGUAAG-3′ and 5′-CUUACAUUCCACACAAUCC-3′) was transfected using SilentFect Lipid reagent (BioRad) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The cells were used for each experiment 3 days after transfection. Transfection efficiency was 90–100%. Down-regulation of p190 RhoGAP was verified by immunoblotting. We tested two different siRNAs and obtained similar results. Lentivirus Construction and Induction—The dominant negative form of Rac1 (Rac1T17N) and the constitutively active form of RhoA (RhoAG14V) were constructed by PCR using pcDNA-Rac1T17N or -RhoAG14V (University of Missouri, Rolla, cDNA Resource Center) as a template and subcloned into the pHAGE lentiviral backbone vector at the NotI/BamHI sites. Generation of lentiviral vectors was accomplished by a five-plasmid transfection procedure (17Mostoslavsky G. Kotton D.N. Fabian A.J. Gray J.T. Lee J.S. Mulligan R.C. Mol. Ther. 2005; 11: 932-940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) (see Supplemental Material, Methods). In Vivo Permeability Assay—Mice (8–12 weeks old, female FVB strain) were pretreated with Ang-1 (10 μg, intraperitoneally). 8 h after the first Ang-1 injection, the second dose of Ang-1 (10 μg, intraperitoneally) and LPS (100 μg, intraperitoneally) were co-injected. Lung permeability was assessed 16 h after the second injection as described previously (7Parikh S.M. Mammoto T. Schultz A. Yuan H.T. Christiani D. Karumanchi S.A. Sukhatme V.P. Plos Med. 2006; 3 (–e60): e46Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) (see Supplemental Material, Methods). Histology—Lungs were harvested, fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. In Vivo Delivery of siRNA—Delivery of siRNA into mice was performed using TransIT® hydrodynamic delivery solution (Mirus, Madison, WI) per the manufacturer’s instructions. Mice were injected with either 10 μg of control siRNA or 10 μg of p190 RhoGAP siRNA in 2 ml of delivery solution injected into the tail vein over 7 s. The method of siRNA delivery is known to suppress 80–90% gene expression in multiple organs, including the lung (18Lewis D.L. Hagstrom J.E. Loomis A.G. Wolff J.A. Herweijer H. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 107-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). High pressure hydrodynamic delivery does not adversely affect serum chemistries or result in end-organ injury (19Liu F. Song Y. Liu D. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 1258-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (1486) Google Scholar). Animals were allowed to recover for 96 h prior to administration of Ang-1 or endotoxin. p190 RhoGAP knockdown at this time point was confirmed by lysing organs in RIPA buffer and performing Western analysis as outlined above. Statistical Analysis—Results are reported as mean ± S.E. Comparisons between continuous variables were performed using unpaired two-sided t test. Ang-1 Activates Rac1 and Inhibits RhoA—Using pulldown assays, we examined whether Ang-1 affects the activities of Rac1 and RhoA in HMVEC-L. Rac1 activity was increased 200% (p < 0.05) for 15 min and 250% (p < 0.05 versus control) for 30 min following treatment with Ang-1 (Fig. 1A, upper panel), whereas RhoA activity was decreased 50% (p < 0.05) for 30 min after Ang-1 addition (Fig. 1A, lower panel). After establishing that Ang-1 activates Tie-2, PI3K, and Akt in HMVEC-L (supplemental A–C), we found that the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (10 μm) blocked Ang-1-induced activation of Rac1 (p < 0.05, Fig. 1B). Ang-1 did not suppress RhoA activity when ECs were infected with a dominant negative form of Rac1 (Rac1T17N) using a lentiviral vector (Fig. 1C). Rac1T17N also reduced Ang-1-induced p190 RhoGAP activation by 60% (p < 0.05, Fig. 1D). Suppression of p190 RhoGAP by siRNA (Fig. 1E, panel a) did not affect Ang-1-induced Rac1 activation (Fig. 1E, panel b, upper panel), but it did abolish the inhibitory effect of Ang-1 on RhoA (Fig. 1E, panel b, lower panel); this response was analogous to the effect of Ang-1 on RhoA in the setting of dominant negative Rac1 (Fig. 1C). These results show that Ang-1 activates endothelial Rac1 and p190 RhoGAP to inhibit RhoA and that p190 RhoGAP acts downstream of activated Rac1. Enhancement of Endothelial Junctions by Ang-1 Requires PI3K and Rac1, Not p190 RhoGAP—Centripetal force exerted on the actin cytoskeleton can increase EC permeability. This is resisted by homologous binding between VE-cadherins, the transmembrane proteins that maintain adherens junctions between neighboring ECs. The cytoskeletal distribution of actin and myosin distinguishes these states: centralized fibers reflect centripetal force, whereas peripheral fibers indicate junctional preservation (20Dudek S.M.

These fibers arise from actin-myosin cross-bridges that are stimulated by myosin light chain phosphorylation (MLC-p) (20Dudek S.M. Garcia J.G. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 1487-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). RhoA regulates MLC-p through Rho-associated kinase (21Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B.

Ang-1 induces MLC-p, peaking at 0.5–1.0 h after stimulation (supplemental D). By immunofluorescence microscopy, we observed an increase in cortical actin, peripheral MLC-p, and junctional VE-cadherin compared with control confluent cells (Fig. 2A, panels a–h). As expected, LY294002 reversed these effects of Ang-1, leading to thick central stress fiber bundles containing actin and MLC-P and intercellular gaps with attenuated VE-cadherin staining (Fig. 2A, panels i–l). We next studied the effect of dominant negative Rac1 (T17N) and constitutively active RhoA (RhoAG14V) on endothelial architecture. Lentiviral delivery of Rac1T17N or RhoAG14V produced intercellular gaps (Fig. 2B, panels b and c) that were not present in control virus-infected cells (Fig. 2B, panel a). In the presence of control virus, Ang-1 retained the ability to augment junctional VE-cadherin staining (Fig. 2B, panel d). However, this effect of Ang-1 was markedly diminished in Rac1T17N- and RhoAG14V-treated cells, resulting in gap formation (Fig. 2B, panels e and f). These results show that inhibition of endogenous Rac1 or activation of RhoA is sufficient to prevent Ang-1-mediated junctional fortification. Knockdown of p190 RhoGAP siRNA did not attenuate junctional VE-cadherin staining nor did it promote intercellular gap formation (supplemental Fa). Moreover, Ang-1 retained its ability to increase junctional VE-cadherin staining despite p190 RhoGAP knockdown (supplemental Fb), suggesting that p190 RhoGAP is dispensable for Ang-1 induced structural effects in otherwise unstimulated cells. p190 RhoGAP Is Necessary for Ang-1 to Block Endotoxin-induced Structural Disruption—Endotoxin treatment (100 ng/ml) of ECs decreased Rac1 activity by 25% (p < 0.01) and induced RhoA activity by 30% (p < 0.01; Fig. 3A). Both of these effects were reversed by co-incubation with Ang-1 (p < 0.01; Fig. 3A). When endogenous p190 RhoGAP expression was blocked, Ang-1 could no longer suppress endotoxin-mediated RhoA activation (p < 0.05; Fig. 3B). Using immunofluorescence microscopy, we observed that 30 min of endotoxin exposure (100 ng/ml) scattered and attenuated junctional VE-cadherin staining and promoted gap formation compared with vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 3C, panels a and b). Ang-1 prevented these effects, and cell-cell junctions appeared normal (Fig. 3C, panel c). Rac1T17N (Fig. 3C, panel d) or p190 RhoGAP siRNA (Fig. 3C, panel e) greatly diminished the ability of Ang-1 to rescue endotoxin-treated cells. Control virus or control siRNA had no effect on the response to endotoxin or endotoxin plus Ang-1 (data not shown). These results show that Ang-1 requires p190 RhoGAP to augment junctions weakened by endotoxin-mediated RhoA activation. Ang-1 Blocks Endotoxin-induced Hyperpermeability through PI3K, Rac1, and p190 RhoGAP—We next tested the effects of Ang-1 and endotoxin on permeability using a standard in vitro assay to quantify the flux of fluorescently labeled albumin across a confluent EC monolayer. Ang-1 did not significantly affect basal permeability; endotoxin increased it by 20%, and the combination restored normal permeability (Fig. 4A). The protective effect of Ang-1 was lost when LY294002 was added (Fig. 4A). In the presence of Rac1T17N, basal permeability was increased, endotoxin did not further augment the trans-monolayer leak, and Ang-1 failed to reverse the hyperpermeability (Fig. 4B). In contrast, p190 RhoGAP siRNA had little effect on basal permeability but did prevent the protective effect of Ang-1 (Fig. 4C). Inhibition of p190 RhoGAP Abolishes the Protective Effect of Systemic Ang-1 against Endotoxemic Vascular Leak in Vivo—Because p190 RhoGAP is necessary for Ang-1 to inhibit several effects of endotoxin, including RhoA activation (Fig. 3B), intercellular gap formation (Fig. 3C), and in vitro permeability (Fig. 4C), we next addressed the importance of this pathway in vivo. Such validation is important because in vitro assays lack crucial elements such as unidirectional laminar flow, variable hydrostatic pressure, interacting cell types (e.g. neutrophils and vascular smooth muscle cells), basement membrane, and connective tissue found in whole vessels of living animals. Evans blue dye avidly binds to serum albumin and therefore can be used as a tracer for macromolecule flux across the microvasculature. In the lung, systemically administered endotoxin (100 μg, intraperitoneally) produced an 8-fold increase in dye extravasation compared with controls (Fig. 5A). The increased permeability was blocked by Ang-1 (Fig. 5A). Light photomicrographs of lung sections revealed that systemic endotoxin resulted in interstitial edema and leukocyte infiltration as compared with control lung sections and those taken from animals pretreated with Ang-1 (Fig. 5B). Delivery of p190 RhoGAP siRNA (10 μg, intravenously) effectively reduced p190 RhoGAP expression in the lung (Fig. 5C, panel a) and was sufficient to block the anti-permeability effect of Ang-1 (Fig. 5C, panel b). Moreover, histological sections confirmed that p190 RhoGAP knockdown abrogated the ability of Ang-1 to block endotoxin-mediated interstitial edema and leukocyte infiltration (Fig. 5D). These results validate our earlier in vitro findings in the context of the whole lung in healthy adult rodents and also establish the critical contribution of p190 RhoGAP to Ang-1-mediated protection against vascular leakage. The data presented here demonstrate that Ang-1 protects against endotoxin-mediated vascular leakage by preventing cytoskeletal rearrangements in the EC that are normally induced by this bacterial toxin. To achieve this, Ang-1 signals through PI3K to activate Rac1, phosphorylate p190 RhoGAP, and inhibit RhoA activity. Ang-1 is able to block the structural rearrangements and hyperpermeability induced by endotoxin but requires p190 RhoGAP to do so. To demonstrate its importance more conclusively, expression of p190 RhoGAP was inhibited in vivo using siRNA. A schematic summarizing the dichotomous actions of Ang-1 and endotoxin on the Rac1/RhoA balance is presented in Fig. 6. Inhibition of either Rac1 or p190 RhoGAP negates the structural and functional protective effects of Ang-1 against endotoxin. The ability of Rac1 to prevent permeability is well known, but the ability of p190 RhoGAP to attenuate pro-permeability signaling in vivo has not yet been described. Although p190 RhoGAP suppression does not alter baseline cytoskeletal structure or in vitro permeability (or in vivo permeability, data not shown), its expression and activation become crucial when RhoA is independently stimulated. Our results suggest that endotoxin-mediated activation of RhoA can be blocked by simultaneous activation of p190 RhoGAP by Ang-1. This is consistent with the regulatory role described for p190 RhoGAP in other cell types (23Arthur W.T. Burridge K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2711-2720Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Therefore, although p190 RhoGAP may be dispensable for the endothelium at base line, it is crucial for the endothelium to prevent the structural rearrangements induced by RhoA activators that can ultimately compromise barrier function. Our results show that endogenous Rac1 activity is necessary to maintain cell-cell adhesion and prevent excess permeability. Rac1 may affect intracellular VE-cadherin distribution by stabilizing it at cell junctions through post-translational modification (24Wojciak-Stothard B. Tsang L.Y. Haworth S.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288 (–L760): L749Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 25Seebach J. Madler H.J. Wojciak-Stothard B. Schnittler H.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2005; 94: 620-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Indeed, our experiments support this assertion as we observed clear attenuation of junctional VE-cadherin staining when Rac1 was inactivated (by chemical inhibition of PI3K or dominant negative Rac1) or when RhoA was activated (by LPS or constitutively active RhoA), yet the total level of VE-cadherin was unchanged across these conditions (data not shown). VE-cadherin may also activate Rac1 (26Lampugnani M.G. Zanetti A. Breviario F. Balconi G. Orsenigo F. Corada M. Spagnuolo R. Betson M. Braga V. Dejana E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1175-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) to promote p190 RhoGAP-mediated RhoA suppression, resulting in less centripetal tension and cell contraction (27Noren N.K. Niessen C.M. Gumbiner B.M. Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33305-33308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 28Holinstat M. Knezevic N. Broman M. Samarel A.M. Malik A.B. Mehta D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2296-2305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). If junctional proteins such as VE-cadherin activate Rac1 and Rac1 in turn promotes junctional localization of VE-cadherin, a positive feedback loop may exist to maintain basal barrier function, analogous to that observed in epithelial cell-cell adhesion (29Vasioukhin V. Bauer C. Yin M. Fuchs E. Cell. 2000; 100: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). Our results with dominant negative Rac1 clearly highlight the importance of one limb in this loop, and work by Dejana and co-workers (30Corada M. Mariotti M. Thurston G. Smith K. Kunkel R. Brockhaus M. Lampugnani M.G. Martin-Padura I. Stoppacciaro A. Ruco L. McDonald D.M. Ward P.A. Dejana E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9815-9820Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar) convincingly illustrates the importance of VE-cadherin, as well, for maintenance of barrier function. In addition to Ang-1 and endotoxin, several other extracellular signals also regulate endothelial permeability through RhoA and/or Rac1, such as thrombin, histamine (31van Nieuw Amerongen G.P. van Delft S. Vermeer M.A. Collard J.G. van Hinsbergh V.W. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 335-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), sphingosine 1-phosphate (32Garcia J.G. Liu F. Verin A.D. Birukova A. Dechert M.A. Gerthoffer W.T. Bamberg J.R. English D. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 689-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar), lysophosphatidic acid (33van Nieuw Amerongen G.P. Vermeer M.A. van Hinsbergh V.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20 (–E133): E127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), transforming growth factor-β (34Clements R.T. Minnear F.L. Singer H.A. Keller R.S. Vincent P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288 (–L306): L294Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and ligands of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 (35Laudanna C. Campbell J.J. Butcher E.C. Science. 1996; 271: 981-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 36Wojciak-Stothard B. Williams L. Ridley A.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1293-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Therefore, ample evidence suggests that competing Rho GTPases may provide a downstream conserved mechanism for regulation of vascular permeability by controlling EC shape and adhesion responses to diverse stimuli. Through its action on p190 RhoGAP, Ang-1 may be able to counteract other endothelial RhoA activators as well. Other endothelial PI3K activators may transduce a similar protective effect against permeability. Rho GTPases mediate other aspects of EC behavior that could contribute to the anti-permeability effect of Ang-1. These include redox signaling through NADPH oxidase (37Ushio-Fukai M. Tang Y. Fukai T. Dikalov S.I. Ma Y. Fujimoto M. Quinn M.T. Pagano P.J. Johnson C. Alexander R.W. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 1160-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), secretion of signaling molecules (38Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3861) Google Scholar), and adhesion of leukocytes (14Thorlacius K. Slotta J.E. Laschke M.W. Wang Y. Menger M.D. Jeppsson B. Thorlacius H. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2006; 79: 923-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Our in vivo results were notable for the ability of Ang-1 to block endotoxin-induced infiltration of leukocytes into the lung parenchyma. Ang-1 down-regulates expression of VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and E-selectin, thereby preventing initial leukocyte adhesion (39Gamble J.R. Drew J. Trezise L. Underwood A. Parsons M. Kasminkas L. Rudge J. Yancopoulos G. Vadas M.A. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 603-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 40Kim I. Moon S.O. Park S.K. Chae S.W. Koh G.Y. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 477-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Rolling leukocytes induce clustering of these adhesion proteins that leads to RhoA activation and results in formation of interendothelial gaps through which leukocytes cross the endothelium (41Millan J. Ridley A.J. Biochem. J. 2005; 385: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Therefore, the anti-inflammatory effect of Ang-1 may arise both due to decreased adhesion molecule expression in ECs and due to suppression of clustering-induced RhoA activation. This latter effect may further augment the anti-permeability action of Ang-1 in vivo, by preventing a leukocyte-induced secondary increase in permeability. To our knowledge, the results presented here are the first direct demonstration of vascular permeability regulation in vivo using siRNA (rather than a chemical inhibitor) for a Rho family protein. Because Ang-1 acts on Tie-2, an endothelium-restricted receptor, we infer that its anti-permeability effect is mediated through the EC. Therefore, the simplest hypothesis to account for the effect of p190 RhoGAP siRNA is that p190 RhoGAP expression within the pulmonary endothelium is the critical transducer of Ang-1 protection against vascular leak in the lung. Other possibilities are less likely but cannot be excluded (such as Ang-1 acting on non-EC types or p190 RhoGAP suppression in another cell type indirectly attenuating the protective effect of Ang-1). This works extends a prior study that showed Ang-1 overexpression protected mice from endotoxemic shock (42Witzenbichler B. Westermann D. Knueppel S. Schultheiss H.P. Tschope C. Circulation. 2005; 111: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Ang-2, considered a context and dose-dependent Tie-2 antagonist, appears to be required for the acute inflammatory response (43Fiedler U. Reiss Y. Scharpfenecker M. Grunow V. Koidl S. Thurston G. Gale N.W. Witzenrath M. Rosseau S. Suttorp N. Sobke A. Herrmann M. Preissner K.T. Vajkoczy P. Augustin H.G. Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar) and for hyperoxia-induced lung injury as has been recently shown with Ang-2 null mice and lung-targeted Ang-2 siRNA (44Bhandari V. Choo-Wing R. Lee C.G. Zhu Z. Nedrelow J.H. Chupp G.L. Zhang X. Matthay M.A. Ware L.B. Homer R.J. Lee P.J. Geick A. de Fougerolles A.R. Elias J.A. Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 1286-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In some settings, such as high doses administered in vivo, Ang-2 may actually activate Tie-2 and protect against permeability (45Daly C. Pasnikowski E. Burova E. Wong V. Aldrich T.H. Griffiths J. Ioffe E. Daly T.J. Fandl J.P. Papadopoulos N. McDonald D.M. Thurston G. Yancopoulos G.D. Rudge J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 15491-15496Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). When considered together, our current findings and these prior studies suggest that Tie-2 activation (by Ang-1 or perhaps high dose Ang-2) may be critical in the defense of the vascular permeability barrier. Several additional questions are raised by our findings. The critical effectors downstream of Rac1 regulating Ang-1-induced junctional stabilization and anti-permeability need to be enumerated. α-Catenin may bridge the signaling pathway connecting Rac1 to VE-cadherin (46Broman M.T. Kouklis P. Gao X. Ramchandran R. Neamu R.F. Minshall R.D. Malik A.B. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), but this has not been tested in the setting of Ang-1 stimulation. The ability of Ang-1 to suppress RhoA may depend on the ligand and pathway activating RhoA (47Pizurki L. Zhou Z. Glynos K. Roussos C. Papapetropoulos A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 139: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the endothelial role of Cdc42, the third major GTPase, remains to be clarified as one report suggests no effect on endothelial permeability (12Wojciak-Stothard B. Potempa S. Eichholtz T. Ridley A.J. J. Cell. Sci. 2001; 114: 1343-1355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas a more recent study suggests that Cdc42 stabilizes junctional proteins (46Broman M.T. Kouklis P. Gao X. Ramchandran R. Neamu R.F. Minshall R.D. Malik A.B. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Although our in vitro studies have focused on paracellular gap formation as the mechanism for permeability, the relative contribution of transcytotic (e.g. caveolae) pathways, particularly in vivo, remains to be defined in this system. However, recent data do suggest that the ability of Ang-1 to close paracellular gaps in vivo accounts for its anti-permeability action (48Baffert F. Le T. Thurston G. McDonald D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290 (–H118): H107Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Calcium influx induces permeability downstream of several ligands, most notably thrombin (49Lum H. Del Vecchio P.J. Schneider A.S. Goligorsky M.S. Malik A.B. J. Appl. Physiol. 1989; 66: 1471-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given recent evidence that Ang-1 blocks vascular endothelial growth factor-induced permeability in vitro by inhibiting calcium influx through TRPC-1 (50Jho D. Mehta D. Ahmmed G. Gao X.P. Tiruppathi C. Broman M. Malik A.B. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 1282-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), that Ang-1 also appears to activate protein kinase Cζ (51Li X. Hahn C.N. Parsons M. Drew J. Vadas M.A. Gamble J.R. Blood. 2004; 104: 1716-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and that key permeability effector proteins, such as myosin light chain kinase, are downstream of both the RhoA and calcium-calmodulin pathways (reviewed in Ref. 52Wojciak-Stothard B. Ridley A.J. Vascul. Pharmacol. 2002; 39: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), it is quite possible that Ang-1 utilizes multiple signaling pathways to control permeability. Finally, the regulation of p190 RhoGAP expression and activation within the endothelium merit further examination, particularly given a recent characterization of its anti-RhoA signaling downstream of another permeability effector, focal adhesion kinase (28Holinstat M. Knezevic N. Broman M. Samarel A.M. Malik A.B. Mehta D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2296-2305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Our results provide a novel mechanism for the anti-permeability effect of Ang-1 in the vascular system and describe, in detail, competing effects on endothelial cytoskeletal structure and cell-cell adhesion from two GTPase signaling pathways that regulate vascular permeability. These data suggest that activation of endothelial p190 RhoGAP is critical for Ang-1 to block endotoxin-induced vascular leak and inflammation in vivo. Finally, this report affirms the importance of the endothelium in the defense against endotoxemic injury. We thank S. Sinha for technical support and Sui Huang for helpful discussions.

CD and GVHD are suspected to be related with the dysfunction of Peyer's patches (PP) and isolated lymphoid follicles (LFs). Using a new mouse model invalidated for Card15/Nod2 (KO), we thus analysed the impact of the gene in these lymphoid formations together with the development of experimental colitis.At weeks 4, 12 and 52, the numbers of PPs and LFs were higher in KO mice while no difference was observed at birth. At weeks 4 and 12, the size and cellular composition of PPs were analysed by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. PPs of KO mice were larger with an increased proportion of M cells and CD4(+) T-cells. KO mice were also characterised by higher concentrations of TNFalpha, IFNgamma, IL12 and IL4 measured by ELISA. In contrast, little differences were found in the PP-free ileum and the spleen of KO mice. By using chamber experiments, we found that this PP phenotype is associated with an increased of both paracellular permeability and yeast/bacterial translocation. Finally, KO mice were more susceptible to the colitis induced by TNBS.Card15/Nod2 deficiency induces an abnormal development and function of the PPs characterised by an exaggerated immune response and an increased permeability. These observations provide a comprehensive link between the molecular defect and the Human CARD15/NOD2 associated disorders: CD and GVHD."

https://openalex.org/W2044436763,"Mammalian Mip/LIN-9 is a cell cycle regulatory protein that is negatively regulated by CDK4/cyclin D. It has been demonstrated that Mip/LIN-9 collaborates with B-Myb during S and G2/M in the induction of cyclins A and B, and CDK1. The ortholog of Mip/LIN-9 in D rosophila, Mip130, is part of a large multisubunit protein complex that includes RBF, repressor E2Fs and Myb, in what was termed the dREAM complex. A similar complex, although lacking B-Myb, was also described in Caenorhabditis elegans. Here, we demonstrate that unlike Drosophila, Mip/LIN-9 has mutually exclusive and cell cycle-phase-specific interactions with the mammalian orthologs of the dREAM complex. In G0/early G1, Mip/LIN-9 forms a complex with E2F4 and p107 or p130, while in late G1/S phase, it associates with B-Myb. The separation of Mip/LIN-9 from p107,p130/E2F4 is likely driven by phosphorylation of the pocket proteins by CDK4 since Mip/LIN-9 fails to interact with phosphorylated forms of p107,p130. Importantly, the repressor complex that Mip/LIN-9 forms with p107 takes functional precedence over the transcriptional activation linked to the Mip/LIN-9 and B-Myb interaction since expression of p107 blocks the activation of the cyclin B promoter triggered by B-Myb and Mip/LIN-9."
https://openalex.org/W2076042473,"Akt, a serine-threonine kinase, regulates multiple cellular processes in vascular cells. We have previously documented that Akt activates integrins and Akt1 deficiency results in matrix abnormalities in skin and blood vessels in vivo. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that Akt1 is necessary for integrin activation and matrix assembly by fibroblasts. In this study, using various cell systems, we show that Akt1 is essential for the inside-out activation of integrins in endothelial cells and fibroblasts, which in turn, mediates matrix assembly. Fibronectin is a major extracellular matrix component of the skin and the vascular basement membrane, which possesses binding sites for many integrins and extracellular matrix proteins. Akt1(-/-) fibroblasts and NIH fibroblasts expressing dominant negative Akt1 (K179M-Akt1) showed impaired fibronectin assembly compared with control fibroblasts. In contrast, expression of constitutively active Akt1 (myrAkt1) resulted in enhanced fibronectin assembly. Although increased fibronectin assembly by myrAkt1-expressing human foreskin fibroblasts was abolished by treatment with anti-integrin beta(1) blocking antibodies, treatment with beta(1)-stimulating antibodies rescued the impaired fibronectin assembly that was due to lack of Akt activity. Finally, expression of myrAkt1 corrected the phenotype of Akt1(-/-) fibroblasts thus showing that Akt1 regulates fibronectin assembly through activation of integrin alpha(5)beta(1)."
https://openalex.org/W2030590419,"Protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ) mediates apoptosis downstream of many apoptotic stimuli. Because of its ubiquitous expression, tight regulation of the proapoptotic function of PKCδ is critical for cell survival. Full-length PKCδ is found in all cells, whereas the catalytic fragment of PKCδ, generated by caspase cleavage, is only present in cells undergoing apoptosis. Here we show that full-length PKCδ transiently accumulates in the nucleus in response to etoposide and that nuclear translocation precedes caspase cleavage of PKCδ. Nuclear PKCδ is either cleaved by caspase 3, resulting in accumulation of the catalytic fragment in the nucleus, or rapidly exported by a Crm1-sensitive pathway, thereby assuring that sustained nuclear accumulation of PKCδ is coupled to caspase activation. Nuclear accumulation of PKCδ is necessary for caspase cleavage, as mutants of PKCδ that do not translocate to the nucleus are not cleaved. However, caspase cleavage of PKCδ per se is not required for apoptosis, as an uncleavable form of PKCδ induces apoptosis when retained in the nucleus by the addition of an SV-40 nuclear localization signal. Finally, we show that kinase negative full-length PKCδ does not translocate to the nucleus in apoptotic cells but instead inhibits apoptosis by blocking nuclear import of endogenous PKCδ. These studies demonstrate that generation of the PKCδ catalytic fragment is a critical step for commitment to apoptosis and that nuclear import and export of PKCδ plays a key role in regulating the survival/death pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1994638410,"Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) belongs to a family of latent cytoplasmic transcription factors important for cytokine signaling. Stat3 is constitutively activated in various tumors, and activated Stat3 itself also acts as an oncogene. Transcriptional activity of Stat3 is controlled by Tyr-phosphorylation, followed by dimerization and nuclear translocation. However, phosphorylation on Ser727 is indispensable for its maximal transcriptional activity with unclear mechanism. Here, we report that peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase 1 (Pin1), which specifically recognizes the pSer/Thr-Pro motifs on its target proteins, interacts with Stat3 upon cytokine/growth factor stimulation. Overexpression of Pin1 promotes Stat3 transcriptional activity and target gene expression, as well as recruitment of transcription coactivator, p300. These effects, however, were compromised in the Pin1-deficient cells, and were totally dependent on the Ser727 phosphorylation site. Finally, we showed that Pin1 enhances Stat3-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cells induced by oncostatin M. Our data reveal a novel, Ser727 phosphorylation-dependent, post-translational regulation mechanism for Stat3."
https://openalex.org/W2168847086,"Physiological studies on the Brittle1 maize mutant have provided circumstantial evidence that ZmBT1 (Zea mays Brittle1 protein) is involved in the ADP-Glc transport into maize endosperm plastids, but up to now, no direct ADP-Glc transport mediated by ZmBT1 has ever been shown. The heterologous synthesis of ZmBT1 in Escherichia coli cells leads to the functional integration of ZmBT1 into the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. ZmBT1 transports ADP-Glc in counterexchange with ADP with apparent affinities of about 850 and 465 μm, respectively. Recently, a complete ferredoxin/thioredoxin system has been identified in cereal amyloplasts and BT1 has been proposed as a potential Trx target protein (Balmer, Y., Vensel, W. H., Cai, N., Manieri, W., Schurmann, P., Hurkman, W. J., and Buchanan, B. B. (2006) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 103, 2988–2993). Interestingly, we revealed that the transport activity of ZmBT1 is reversibly regulated by redox reagents such as diamide and dithiothreitol. The expression of ZmBT1 is restricted to endosperm tissues during starch synthesis, whereas a recently identified BT1 maize homologue, the ZmBT1–2, exhibits a ubiquitous expression pattern in hetero- and autotrophic tissues indicating different physiological roles for both maize BT1 isoforms. BT1 homologues are present in both mono- and dicotyledonous plants. Phylogenetic analyses classify the BT1 family into two phylogenetically and biochemically distinct groups. The first group comprises BT1 orthologues restricted to cereals where they mediate the ADP-Glc transport into cereal endosperm storage plastids during starch synthesis. The second group occurs in mono- and dicotyledonous plants and is most probably involved in the export of adenine nucleotides synthesized inside plastids. Physiological studies on the Brittle1 maize mutant have provided circumstantial evidence that ZmBT1 (Zea mays Brittle1 protein) is involved in the ADP-Glc transport into maize endosperm plastids, but up to now, no direct ADP-Glc transport mediated by ZmBT1 has ever been shown. The heterologous synthesis of ZmBT1 in Escherichia coli cells leads to the functional integration of ZmBT1 into the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. ZmBT1 transports ADP-Glc in counterexchange with ADP with apparent affinities of about 850 and 465 μm, respectively. Recently, a complete ferredoxin/thioredoxin system has been identified in cereal amyloplasts and BT1 has been proposed as a potential Trx target protein (Balmer, Y., Vensel, W. H., Cai, N., Manieri, W., Schurmann, P., Hurkman, W. J., and Buchanan, B. B. (2006) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 103, 2988–2993). Interestingly, we revealed that the transport activity of ZmBT1 is reversibly regulated by redox reagents such as diamide and dithiothreitol. The expression of ZmBT1 is restricted to endosperm tissues during starch synthesis, whereas a recently identified BT1 maize homologue, the ZmBT1–2, exhibits a ubiquitous expression pattern in hetero- and autotrophic tissues indicating different physiological roles for both maize BT1 isoforms. BT1 homologues are present in both mono- and dicotyledonous plants. Phylogenetic analyses classify the BT1 family into two phylogenetically and biochemically distinct groups. The first group comprises BT1 orthologues restricted to cereals where they mediate the ADP-Glc transport into cereal endosperm storage plastids during starch synthesis. The second group occurs in mono- and dicotyledonous plants and is most probably involved in the export of adenine nucleotides synthesized inside plastids. Cereal crops accumulate starch in seed endosperm plastids as main energy reserve. The pathway of starch synthesis in cereal endosperms is unique and requires enzyme isoforms that are not present in other tissues or non-cereal plants. The ability of heterotrophic plastids to utilize cytosolic precursors to support their biosynthetic and catabolic pathways depends on the presence of specific transporters in the plastid envelope. In cereal endosperms, the ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase), 2The abbreviations used are: AGPase, ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase; RT, reverse transcriptase; IPTG, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; EF, elongation factor; Trx, thioredoxin; DTT, dithiothreitol. 2The abbreviations used are: AGPase, ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase; RT, reverse transcriptase; IPTG, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; EF, elongation factor; Trx, thioredoxin; DTT, dithiothreitol. which catalyzes the first committed and rate-limiting step in starch biosynthesis, is mainly localized in the cytosol with a total AGPase activity of about 85–95% (2James M.G. Denyer K. Myers A.M. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2003; 6: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Therefore, ADP-glucose (ADP-Glc) is synthesized in the cytosol of cereal endosperms as the main precursor for starch synthesis and has to be subsequently imported into the storage plastids. Several maize (Zea mays L.) endosperm mutants affected in starch quality or quantity were used to elucidate critical steps in amyloplast starch synthesis. The Waxy gene, which encodes a starch-granule-bound starch synthase involved in amylose synthesis (3Nelson O.E. Rines H.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1962; 9: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and the Shrunken-2 and Brittle-2 genes, which encode subunits of the AGPase (4Tsai C.Y. Nelson O.E. Science. 1966; 151: 341-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 5Preiss J. Danner S. Summers P.S. Morell M. Barton C.R. Yang L. Nieder M. Plant Physiol. 1990; 92: 881-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 6Bhave M.R. Lawrence S. Barton C. Hannah L.C. Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), were shown to be important for starch synthesis in maize. The Brittle-1 (BT1) maize mutant was identified in 1926 (7Mangelsdorf P.C. Conn. Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1926; 279: 509-614Google Scholar, 8Wentz J.B. J. Hered. 1926; 17: 327-329Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and corresponding endosperm is severely reduced in starch content, which results in kernels with a collapsed angular appearance at maturity. The BT1 protein from Z. mays (ZmBT1) belongs to the mitochondrial carrier family and is located in the amyloplast envelope membrane (9Cao H. Sullivan T.D. Boyer C.D. Shannon J.C. Physiol. Plant. 1995; 95: 176-186Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 10Sullivan T.D. Kaneko Y. Planta. 1995; 196: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The absence of ZmBT1 correlates with a 12-fold higher level of ADP-Glc in the cytosol of BT1 mutant endosperm than in wild-type endosperm (11Pien F-M. Shannon J.C. Plant Physiol. 1996; 111 (Suppl.): S100Google Scholar) and BT1 mutant kernels accumulate about 80% less starch than wild-type kernels (12Tobias R.B. Boyer C.B. Shannon J. Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The incorporation of externally applied ADP-Glc into starch in amyloplasts isolated from BT1 mutant endosperm was reduced to about 25% compared with wild-type amyloplasts (13Liu T-T. Y. Boyer C.D Shannon J.C. Plant Physiol. 1992; 99 (Suppl.): S39Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These results indicate that ZmBT1 is involved in the transport of ADP-Glc into maize endosperm plastids (14Shannon J.C. Pien F.M. Cao H. Liu K.C. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 1235-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), but up to now, no direct ADP-Glc transport mediated by ZmBT1 has been shown. Recently, a BT1 homologue from a non-cereal plant, namely potato (StBT1 from Solanum tuberosum), was functionally characterized as a plastidic adenine nucleotide uniporter expressed in sink and source tissues (15Leroch M. Kirchberger S. Haferkamp I. Wahl M. Neuhaus H.E. Tjaden J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17992-18000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The physiological role of StBT1 is most likely the export of purine nucleotides that are exclusively de novo synthesized in plastids of autotrophic and heterotrophic tissues (15Leroch M. Kirchberger S. Haferkamp I. Wahl M. Neuhaus H.E. Tjaden J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17992-18000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 16Zrenner R. Stitt M. Sonnewald U. Boldt R. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2006; 57: 805-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). These novel findings further urged for a comprehensive analysis of the biochemical transport features of the maize homologue ZmBT1. We present here direct transport properties of the heterologously expressed ZmBT1. For this we exploited an Escherichia coli expression system that was successfully used to analyze plastidic or mitochondrial carrier proteins (15Leroch M. Kirchberger S. Haferkamp I. Wahl M. Neuhaus H.E. Tjaden J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17992-18000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 17Tjaden J. Schwoöppe C. Moöhlmann T. Quick P.W. Neuhaus H.E. J. Biol.

Biochem. 2002; 269: 3172-3181Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We also reviewed the endosperm-specific expression of ZmBT1 and proved the occurrence and expression pattern of further ZmBT1 homologues in maize. Cultivation of Plants—Maize plants (Z. mays L.) were grown in a greenhouse at 22–26 °C and watered once a day. The ambient light period was extended to 16 h/day with Philips SontAgro lights (200 μmol quanta m–2 s–1). For RNA and genomic DNA isolation, maize tissues were collected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen until use. Southern Blot Analyses—Genomic DNA was isolated from 4 g of frozen leaf tissue as described by Dellaporta et al. (19Dellaporta S.T. Wood J. Hicks J.B. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1983; 4: 19-21Crossref Scopus (6250) Google Scholar). About 10 μg of genomic DNA were digested with high concentrated restriction enzymes (BamHI, HindIII, XbaI, and XhoI). DNA fragments were separated in 0.8% agarose gels, denatured, and neutralized according to standard procedures (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1989; (, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY)Google Scholar). After transfer to nylon membranes (Hybond-N membranes, Amersham Biosciences), DNA fragments were fixed to the nylon filters by optimal UV cross-link (254 nm, 120 millijoule cm–2) in a Spectrolinker. The membranes were prehybridized for 60 min at 68 °C in 6× SSPE buffer (20× SSPE contains 3.6 m NaCI, 0.2 m sodium phosphate, 0.02 m EDTA, pH 7.7) supplemented with 1% SDS, 100 μg/ml herring sperm DNA, and 5× Denhardt’s reagent. Hybridization was performed for 16 h at 68 °C in the same solution plus the complete ZmBT1-cDNA fragment labeled by the random primer method with [α-32P]dCTP using the Ready-To-Go prime kit (Amersham Biosciences). Afterward, the membranes were washed once at 37 °C for 15 min in 7× SSPE, 0.5% SDS and twice at 60 °C for 15 min in 0.1× SSPE, 1% SDS. Blots were visualized by a Cyclon PhosphorImager (Packard). Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR—Total RNA was prepared from various maize tissues using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). To remove any contaminating DNA, the samples were treated with deoxyribonuclease (RNase-free DNase Kit, Qiagen). Quantitative PCR was performed using MyIQ-Cycler (Bio-Rad) and IQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s instructions with the following cycler conditions: 20 min at 50 °C; 15 min at 95 °C; 55 cycles: 15 s at 95 °C, 25 s at 58 °C, and 40 s at 72 °C. The sequences of the gene-specific oligonucleotides used for real-time RT-PCR are the following: ZmBT1-sense, 5′-CAAGGCTATCGAGCATTTCACC-3′; ZmBT1-antisense, 5′-TCGTAGGCGTAG-AAGTTACAGG-3′; ZmBT1–2-sense, 5′-AACAGCATATTACCCGTGGA-3′; ZmBT1–2-antisense, 5′-CCTCAGGCACGT-ACTTCATA-3′; EF-1α-sense, 5′-GCTTC-ACGTCCCAGGTCATC-3′ and EF-1α-antisense, 5′-TAGGCTTGGTGGGTATCA-TC-3′. The housekeeping gene in Z. mays encoding the elongation factor EF-1α (AF136829) was used for quantitative normalization. The specificity of the obtained RT-PCR products was controlled on 2% agarose gels. Plasmid Construct for Heterologous Expression of ZmBT1 in E. coli—DNA manipulations were performed essentially as described by Sambrook et al. (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1989; (, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY)Google Scholar). The expression plasmid (pET 16b, Novagen, Heidelberg, Germany) encoding the recombinant ZmBT1 protein with an additional N-terminal tag of 10 histidine residues was constructed as follows: the cDNA coding the entire ZmBT1 was generated by PCR from first strand cDNA of maize endosperm tissue using Pfu DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). A sense primer including an NdeI restriction site and an antisense primer were used for the PCR (sense: 5′-GACTGAcatATGGCGGCGACAATG-3′; the lowercase letters indicate the introduced base exchange to create an NdeI restriction site; antisense: 5′-CTACCTTCTTGGCCAAGAACTTTG-3′). The obtained PCR product was purified (Nucleospin Extract II, Macherey & Nagel, Duören, Germany), subcloned into the EcoRV restriction site of the plasmid pBSK (Stratagene), and checked by sequencing on both strands by chain termination reaction (MWG-Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany). For the construction of the E. coli expression plasmid (encoding His10-ZmBT1), the NdeI/BamHI DNA insert of the pBSK-plasmid was introduced in-frame into the corresponding restriction sites of the isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible T7-RNA polymerase bacterial expression vector pET16b (Novagen, Heidelberg, Germany). Transformations of E. coli were carried out according to standard protocols. The nucleotide sequence of the ZmBT1 reported in this paper is available at the EMBL data base (www.ebi.ac.uk/embl/) under the accession number BT016796. Heterologous Expression of ZmBT1 in E. coli—The E. coli strain Rosetta(DE3) was used for heterologous expression. The cDNA sequence encoding ZmBT1 under control of the T7-promoter was transcribed after IPTG induction of the T7-RNA polymerase (21Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar). E. coli cells harboring the ZmBT1 expression plasmid (or control expression plasmid pET16b) were grown at 37 °C in TBAmp/Clm medium (TB: 2.5 g/liter KH2PO4, 12.5 g/liter K2HPO4, 12 g/liter peptone, 24 g/liter yeast extract, 0.4% glycerin, pH 7.0). An optical density (A600) of 0.5–0.6 was required for the initiation of T7-RNA polymerase expression by addition of IPTG (final concentration, 1 mm). Cells were grown for 1 h after induction and collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 4,000 × g (room temperature, Sorvall RC5B centrifuge, rotor type SS34; Sorvall-Du Pont, Dreieich, Germany). The pellet was resuspended to an A600 of 6 using potassium phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 7.0) (22Krause D.C. Winkler H.H. Wood D.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3015-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and promptly used for uptake experiments. Membrane integration of the recombinant full-length ZmBT1 in E. coli was confirmed by enrichment of the histidine-tagged protein and Western blot analysis using a ZmBT1 specific antibody (10Sullivan T.D. Kaneko Y. Planta. 1995; 196: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). E. coli cells (20 ml) harboring the ZmBT1 expression plasmid (or the pET16b control plasmid) were collected 1 h after IPTG induction (controls without IPTG) and transferred to liquid nitrogen to destroy cell intactness. After resuspension in a medium consisting of 10 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm Pefabloc, and 15% (v/v) glycerol, cells were further disrupted by ultrasonication (250 W, 3 × 30 s, 4 °C) and the suspension was centrifuged (10 min, 15,800 × g, 4 °C) to remove unbroken cells and inclusion bodies. Membranes extracted in the supernatant were sedimented for 45 min at 100,000 × g (TFT 80 rotor, Kontron Instruments, Munich, Germany), resuspended in binding buffer A consisting of 5 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm Na2HPO4 (pH 8.0, HCl), and 0.3% Triton X-100. After incubation on ice for 30 min, the not solubilized proteins were sedimented for 45 min at 100,000 × g. The solubilized histidine-tagged ZmBT1 in the supernatant was purified by nickel-chelating chromatography according to the supplier’s instructions (Qiagen). Histidine-tagged protein was eluted with 500 μm imidazole and desalted by Sephadex G50 centrifugation. For SDS-PAGE, a protein aliquot was added to concentrated SDS-PAGE sample buffer medium and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Finally, the preparation was applied to a polyacrylamide gel (3% stacking gel, 12% running gel) for electrophoresis in the presence of 0.1% SDS. Proteins were transferred to a nylon Hybond P membrane (Amersham Biosciences) in transfer buffer (39 mm glycine, 48 mm Tris base, 20% methanol, pH 8.3) for 1 h at 300 V. Western blot analysis was preformed utilizing a ZmBT1-specific antibody as primary antibody that was raised against 56 amino acids from the C terminus of the ZmBT1. An anti-rabbit IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate was used as secondary antibody. The immunoreactive bands were visualized by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium substrate. Transport Assays with E. coli—IPTG-induced E. coli cells (100 μl) harboring the ZmBT1 expression plasmid (or the given controls) were added to 100 μl of potassium phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 7.0) containing radioactively labeled ADP or ADP-Glc. [α-32P]ADP was enzymatically synthesized from [α-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as given in Tjaden et al. (17Tjaden J. Schwoöppe C. Moöhlmann T. Quick P.W. Neuhaus H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9630-9636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and used at specific activities between 50 and 500 μCi/μmol. [14C]ADP-Glc was used at specific activities between 20 and 250 μCi/μmol. Uptake of nucleotides was carried out at 30 °C in an Eppendorf reaction vessel incubator and terminated after the indicated time periods by transferring the cells to a 0.45-μm membrane filter (mixed cellulose ester, 25 mm diameter; Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany) under vacuum (23Winkler H.H. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 125: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Cells were further washed to remove unimported radioactivity by addition of 3 × 4-ml potassium phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 7.0). The filter was subsequently transferred into a 20-ml scintillation vessel and filled with either 10 ml of water or 10 ml of scintillation mixture (Quicksafe A; Zinsser Analytic, Frankfurt/Main, Germany). Radioactivity in the samples was quantified in a Canberra-Packard Tricarb 2500 scintillation counter (Canberra-Packard, Frankfurt/Main, Germany). For efflux assays, E. coli cells were incubated with potassium phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 7.0) containing 1 μm [14C]ADP-Glc as a transport substrate. After the indicated time periods, the uptake medium was diluted with several unlabeled nucleotides to a final concentration of 1 mm and the efflux of [14C]ADP-Glc was monitored at the given time points. Efflux was measured by membrane filtration as described above. To analyze the degree of metabolic conversion of imported [14C]ADP-Glc, we carried out a thin layer chromatography according to the method of Mangold (24Mangold H.K. Nucleic Acids and Nucleotides. 1967; (Stahl, E., ed) pp. , Springer, Heidelberg, Germany: 749-769Google Scholar). Sequence Analysis—Multiple alignments of amino acid sequences from known BT1 homologues available at the EMBL data base (www.ebi.ac.uk/embl/) were obtained using Clustal X (25Jeanmougin F. Thompson J.D. Gouy M. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 403-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2360) Google Scholar). The phylogenetic tree was created with PhyML (26Guindon S. Lethiec F. Duroux P. Gascuel O. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33 (–W559): W557Crossref PubMed Scopus (1193) Google Scholar) after aligning the sequences with Muscle (27Edgar R.C. BMC Bioinformatics. 2004; 5: 113Crossref PubMed Scopus (5614) Google Scholar). Sequence Analysis of ZmBT1—The ZmBT1 cDNA clone was isolated from the first strand cDNA of maize endosperm as given under “Experimental Procedures.” Six independent PCR products of ZmBT1 have been sequenced and found to exhibit 100% identity excluding failure of the Pfu polymerase. Compared with the open reading frame of the ZmBT1 sequence published by Sullivan et al. (28Sullivan T.D. Strelow L.I. Illingworth C.A. Phillips R.L. Nelson Jr., O.E. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 1337-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), our ZmBT1 cDNA sequence differs in the following positions: six additional nucleotides (G at bp position 246, 295, and 411, and GGA at bp position 1257–1259) and two nucleotide changes (GC instead of CG at bp position 338–339). The resultant triple frameshift modified the deduced amino acid sequence ahead of the first predicted transmembrane domain (amino acid position 83–137) and the additional amino acid residue at the C terminus (position 419) led to a substantial higher similarity to other BT1 isoforms (Fig. 1). Interestingly, the ZmBT1 cDNA sequence we determined was recently submitted by Lai et al. as well (2004, direct submission, accession number BT016796, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The deduced ZmBT1 protein sequence was aligned with putative BT1 homologues from wheat (Triticum aestivum), rice (Oryza sativa), barley (Hordeum vulgare), maize (Z. mays), barrel medic (Medicago truncatula), potato (S. tuberosum), and Arabidopsis thaliana (Fig. 1). The amino acid sequence of the BT1 homologues consists of three tandem repeats of ∼100 residues showing 6 putative transmembrane helices (15Leroch M. Kirchberger S. Haferkamp I. Wahl M. Neuhaus H.E. Tjaden J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17992-18000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). All BT1 homologues possess three conserved mitochondrial energy transfer signatures that are characteristic for membrane proteins belonging to the mitochondrial carrier family (29Saraste M. Walker J.E. FEBS Lett. 1982; 144: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 30Millar A.H. Heazlewood J.L. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analyses classify BT1 homologues as members of the mitochondrial carrier family forming a monophyletic cluster (31Tjaden J. Haferkamp I. Boxma B. Tielens A.G. Huynen M. Hackstein J.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1439-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A comparison of the BT1 isoforms revealed a high similarity of ZmBT1 to TaBT1 (66% identity, 75% similarity), OsBT1-1 (66% identity, 73% similarity), HvNST (65% identity, 74% similarity), and to a lower extent to OsBT1–3 (58% identity, 68% similarity), ZmBT1–2 (58% identity, 68% similarity), OsBT1–2 (48% identity, 60% similarity), MtBT1 (46% identity, 63% similarity), StBT1 (45% identity, 61% similarity), and AtBT1 (44% identity, 61% similarity). Phylogenetic analyses of the BT1 homologues indicate that the BT1 protein family can be divided into two subgroups. The first phylogenetic cluster comprises only BT1 homologues from monocotyledonous plants including ZmBT1 (Fig. 2). The second cluster includes BT1 homologues from both mono- and dicotyledonous plants indicating a putative distinct function compared with the monocotyledonous-specific group (Fig. 2). Several computer programs (i.e. ChloroP 1.1, PredSL, etc.) predict for all BT1 homologues a plastidic localization due to the N-terminal plastidic transit peptides (32Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. von Heigne G. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 978-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar, 33Petsalaki E.I. Bagos P.G. Litou Z.I. Hamodrakas S.J. Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics. 2006; 4: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). For ZmBT1, HvNST1, and StBT1, a plastidic localization was experimentally verified by immunological studies, green fluorescent protein fusion, and/or targeting experiments into isolated plastids (9Cao H. Sullivan T.D. Boyer C.D. Shannon J.C. Physiol. Plant. 1995; 95: 176-186Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 15Leroch M. Kirchberger S. Haferkamp I. Wahl M. Neuhaus H.E. Tjaden J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17992-18000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 34Patron N.J. Greber B. Fahy B.F. Laurie D.A. Parker M.L. Denyer K. Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 2088-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Southern Blot Analysis of ZmBT1 in Maize—In the light of the differences registered between BT1 gene copy numbers in mono- and dicotyledonous plants based on the rice and Arabidopsis genomes (35Toyota K. Tamura M. Ohdan T. Nakamura Y. Planta. 2006; 223: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 36Initiative The Arabidopsis Genome Nature. 2000; 408: 796-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (7006) Google Scholar), we assessed BT1 gene copy numbers in maize by Southern blot analyses. We chose restriction enzymes that do cut either ZmBT1 or the recently published ZmBT1–2 homologue (accession number BT016800). The digestion of the genomic maize DNA with the restriction enzymes (XbaI, XhoI, and HindIII) led to two distinct bands on the Southern blot (Fig. 3, lanes 1–3). Only digestion with BamHI showed three bands, which is most probably due to a restriction site inside an intron of one of the two BT1 homologues. These results clearly indicate that two BT1 homologues occur in maize, in contrast to one homologue in dicotyledonous plants (15Leroch M. Kirchberger S. Haferkamp I. Wahl M. Neuhaus H.E. Tjaden J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17992-18000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2) and three homologues in rice (35Toyota K. Tamura M. Ohdan T. Nakamura Y. Planta. 2006; 223: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Heterologous Expression of ZmBT1 in E. coli Cells—We showed previously that the heterologous synthesis of the plastidic StBT1 homologue in E. coli leads to the functional integration of StBT1 into the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane (15Leroch M. Kirchberger S. Haferkamp I. Wahl M. Neuhaus H.E. Tjaden J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17992-18000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Astonishingly, we identified StBT1 as a plastidic adenine nucleotide uniporter despite the attributed function to BT1 proteins to transport ADP-Glc in counterexchange with ADP and/or AMP (14Shannon J.C. Pien F.M. Cao H. Liu K.C. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 1235-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 34Patron N.J. Greber B. Fahy B.F. Laurie D.A. Parker M.L. Denyer K. Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 2088-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 37Moöhlmann T. Tjaden J. Henrichs G. Quick W.P. Haöusler R. Neuhaus H.E. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, a high degree of sequence similarity for homologues belonging to the same protein family cannot be taken as proof for the same function (see Ref. 38Haferkamp I. Schmitz-Esser S. Linka N. Urbany C. Collingro A. Wagner M. Horn M. Neuhaus H.E.

The kinetic properties as well as the substrate specificity should be identified for each putative homologue. The heterologous expression of ZmBT1 in different E. coli strains was analyzed using a peptide-specific antibody raised against a fusion protein including the 56 amino acid residues in the C-terminal sequence of ZmBT1. Substantial differences in the expression level of carrier proteins in E. coli have been reported (18Haferkamp I. Hackstein J.H. Voncken F.G. Schmit G. Tjaden J. Eur. J.

In fact, a screening of the ZmBT1 cDNA sequence revealed several codons rarely used in E. coli so that synthesized ZmBT1 protein in BL21, the most widely used expression host, was hard to detect (data not shown). In marked contrast, the use of E. coli Rosetta strains, which carry the pRARE plasmid and thus supply tRNAs for codons rarely used in E. coli, allows a high expression of ZmBT1. We confirmed the integration of the heterologously expressed ZmBT1 in the E. coli Rosetta cytoplasmic membrane by Western blotting by use of the above mentioned peptide-specific ZmBT1 antibody (Fig. 4). We tested ADP-Glc as a putative transport substrate for ZmBT1. Uptake of [14C]ADP-Glc into E. coli Rosetta cells harboring ZmBT1 in their membranes was linear with time for at least 15 min. The ADP-Glc uptake was strictly dependent on the membrane intactness and ZmBT1 protein synthesis (supplementary materials Fig. 1). Thus, we analyzed the affinity for ADP-Glc at different substrate concentrations. The results are given in Fig. 5A. Increased exogenous radioactively labeled ADP-Glc induced increased rates of ADP-Glc transport into E. coli cells harboring ZmBT1. Lineweaver-Burk analyses revealed an apparent Km value for ADP-Glc of 847.8 ± 39.6 μm and a Vmax of 191.5 ± 28.7 nmol of ADP-Glc/mg of protein–1 h–1 (Fig. 5A).

Differential composition of the p53 and p63 DNA-binding sites may contribute to distinct functions of these protein homologues. We used SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) methodology to identify nucleic acid ligands for p63. We found that p63 bound preferentially to DNA fragments conforming to the 20 bp sequence 5′-RRRC(A/G)(A/T)GYYYRRRC(A/T)(C/T)GYYY-3′. Relative to the p53 consensus, the p63 consensus DNA-binding site (DBS) was more degenerate, particularly at positions 10 and 11, and was enriched for A/G at position 5 and C/T at position 16 of the consensus. The differences in DNA-binding site preferences between p63 and p53 influenced their ability to activate transcription from select response elements (REs) in cells. A computer algorithm, p63MH, was developed to find candidate p63-binding motifs on input sequences. We identified genes responsive to p63 regulation that contain functional p63 REs. Our results suggest that the sequence composition of REs could be one contributing factor to target gene discrimination between p63 and p53."
https://openalex.org/W2054699746,"RASSF1A (RAS-association domain family 1, isoform A) is a newer tumor suppressor that binds to and stabilizes microtubules as well as induces M-phase cell cycle arrest. Several other proteins that interact with and stabilize microtubules also undergo mitotic phase phosphorylation to regulate microtubule dynamics and M-phase cell cycle progression. Currently, however, there is a paucity of information regarding the phosphorylation status of RASSF1A and its regulation during mitosis. In this study, for the first time, we demonstrate that Aurora-A is a RASSF1A kinase and, to the best of our knowledge, this is also the first study reporting the identification of a kinase for RASSF1A. We show that the mitotic kinase Aurora-A directly interacts with and phosphorylates RASSF1 and that RASSF1A is phosphorylated by Aurora-A during mitosis. These findings therefore link an important oncogenic mitotic kinase to regulate RASSF1A tumor suppressor. Aurora-A appears to phosphorylate RASSF1A at Threonine202 and/or Serine203 that reside within the known microtubule-binding domain of RASSF1A. Substitutions of these residues with glutamic acid at both positions, mimicking constitutive phosphorylation of RASSF1A, disrupt RASSF1A interactions with microtubules and abolish its ability to induce M-phase cell cycle arrest. Our results further demonstrate that Aurora-A overexpression also interferes with RASSF1A-mediated growth suppression. In view of our results, we propose that Aurora-A-mediated phosphorylation of RASSF1A is a novel mechanism that regulates the ability of this tumor suppressor to interact with microtubules and modulate M-phase cell cycle progression."

In eukaryotes, DNA is first transcribed to pre-mRNAs, which often contain introns. These introns need to be precisely removed by pre-mRNA splicing before mRNA can be exported from the nucleus and translated. Pre-mRNA splicing is carried out by the spliceosome, a large protein-RNA complex that contains five small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6) and numerous other protein factors (1Moore M.J. Query C.C. Sharp P.A. Gesteland R. Atkins J. The RNA World. 1993: 303-357Google Scholar, 2Hastings M.L. Krainer A.R. Curr. Opin.

The spliceosome assembles on pre-mRNA in a stepwise manner by forming the E, A, B, and C complexes. The E complex formation involves the recognition of the 5′ splice site, the branch point sequence, the polypyrimidine tract, and the 3′ splice site by the U1 snRNP, 2The abbreviations used are: snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoproteins; snRNA, small nuclear RNA; ds, double-stranded; nt, nucleotide; GST, glutathione S-transferase; AMPPNP, 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate; ATP-γ-S, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); h, human. SF1, U2AF65, and U2AF35, respectively. The U2 snRNP then base-pairs with the branch point sequence and forms the A complex in an ATP-dependent manner. The subsequent joining of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP signifies the formation of the B complex. After extensive rearrangements of protein-RNA and RNA-RNA interactions, the catalytically active C complex forms. Later evidence shows that the spliceosome containing all five snRNPs may preassemble before encountering any pre-mRNA substrates (4Stevens S.W. Ryan D.E. Ge H.Y. Moore R.E. Young M.K. Lee T.D.

Biol. 2003; 23: 3442-3455Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Interactions in the traditional stepwise assembly model are usually observed under stringent conditions, which may reflect a stepwise strengthening of particular interactions in the preassembled spliceosome (6Nilsen T.W. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 8-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar); therefore the traditional model continues to serve as a practical tool for understanding spliceosome assembly. With the exception of the formation of the E complex, all of the spliceosome assembly steps require ATP. Coinciding with this ATP dependence is the association of a number of DEXD/H-box proteins that are thought to facilitate various stages of the assembly process, possibly using the energy of ATP hydrolysis (7Staley J.P. Guthrie C. Cell. 1998; 92: 315-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). DEXD/H-box proteins belong to the superfamily 2 of the helicase superfamilies and contain 9–11 conserved helicase motifs (8Cordin O. Banroques J. Tanner N.K. Linder P. Gene (Amst.). 2006; 367: 17-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar, 9Sengoku T. Nureki O. Nakamura A. Kobayashi S. Yokoyama S. Cell. 2006; 125: 287-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). DEXD/H-box proteins are present in almost all cellular events that involve RNA. The sequence similarity between DEXD/H-box proteins and well characterized DNA helicases lead to the early hypothesis that DEXD/H-box proteins function in various cellular processes as RNA helicases. Many DEXD/H-box proteins have been shown to have ATPase activity, although the strength of their ATPase activity varies widely (kcat from 0.3/min to 600/min) (8Cordin O. Banroques J. Tanner N.K. Linder P. Gene (Amst.). 2006; 367: 17-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). A subset of the DEXD/H-box proteins have been shown to unwind dsRNA in vitro (9Sengoku T. Nureki O. Nakamura A. Kobayashi S. Yokoyama S. Cell. 2006; 125: 287-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 10Rogers Jr., G.W. Komar A.A. Merrick W.C. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol.

Increasing evidence shows that DEXD/H-box proteins can fulfill their cellular function using different approaches instead of being a helicase alone. On the one hand, eIF4A, a prototypic DEXD/H-box protein, unwinds dsRNA, and its helicase activity is likely to be important for its role in translation initiation (15Jaramillo M. Dever T.E. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5992-5997Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 16Sonenberg N. Gene Expr. 1993; 3: 317-323PubMed Google Scholar, 17Svitkin Y.V. Pause A. Haghighat A. Pyronnet S. Witherell G. Belsham G.J. Sonenberg N. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2001; 7: 382-394Google Scholar). On the other hand, the ATPase activity of eIF4AIII is inhibited in the exon junction complex, so it can hold the exon junction complex tightly on a single-stranded RNA (18Ballut L. Marchadier B. Baguet A. Tomasetto C. Seraphin B. Le Hir H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 861-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 19Bono F. Ebert J. Lorentzen E. Conti E.

Le Hir H. Andersen G.R. Science. 2006; 313: 1968-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In addition, several DEXD/H-box proteins are shown to be able to displace protein factors from single-stranded RNA without duplex unwinding (RNPase activity), which may serve as another way for DEXD/H-box protein to fulfill their cellular functions (21Fairman M.E. Maroney P.A. Wang W. Bowers H.A. Gollnick P. Nilsen T.W. Jankowsky E. Science. 2004; 304: 730-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Biochemical characterization of DEXD/H-box proteins’ enzymatic activity has often been the first step for understanding the function of these proteins in the cellular processes they involve. Our focus in this study is to characterize the biochemical properties of DEXD/H-box protein UAP56. UAP56 is an essential splicing factor first discovered through its interactions with U2AF65 (22Fleckner J. Zhang M. Valcarcel J. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1864-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). UAP56 is one of the two DEXD/H-box proteins, together with Prp5, required for the first ATP-dependent spliceosome assembly step (the binding of U2 snRNP to the branch point sequence). HeLa nuclear extract depleted of UAP56 cannot support the formation of A complex in vitro (22Fleckner J. Zhang M. Valcarcel J. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1864-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The mechanism of how UAP56 facilitates splicing is unknown. One possibility is that UAP56 acts as an RNA helicase and rearranges secondary structures in U2 snRNA that may be critical for the binding of U2 snRNP to branch point sequence. A similar role has been proposed for Prp5 (23O'Day C.L. Dalbadie-McFarland G. Abelson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33261-33267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, UAP56 has not been demonstrated to be able to unwind dsRNA in vitro, and it is not clear whether the helicase activity is required for the formation of the A complex. An alternative possibility is that UAP56 promotes the removal of U2AF65 from the 3′ splice site region, consequently facilitating the binding of U2 snRNP to the pre-mRNA (24Kistler A.L. Guthrie C. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Support for this hypothesis mainly comes from yeast genetic analyses, and there is not yet evidence whether UAP56 can remove U2AF65 from RNA in vitro. UAP56 has also been shown to be essential for mRNA export in several organisms (25Macmorris M. Brocker C. Blumenthal T. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2003; 9: 847-857Google Scholar, 26Herold A. Teixeira L. Izaurralde E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2472-2483Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 27Jensen T.H. Boulay J. Rosbash M. Libri D. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1711-1715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). mRNA export is thought to be mediated through a heterodimeric transport receptor (NXF1-p15), which binds the RNA cargo directly or indirectly and transports the cargo through the nuclear pore complex. mRNA export analyses in Drosophila indicates that UAP56 and NXF1-p15 acts in the same pathway and is responsible for the export of the majority of mRNAs (26Herold A. Teixeira L. Izaurralde E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2472-2483Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Knockdown of UAP56 in Caenorhabditis elegans leads to a drastic reduction of green fluorescent protein reporter gene expression due to accumulation of mRNA in the nucleus (25Macmorris M. Brocker C. Blumenthal T. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2003; 9: 847-857Google Scholar). Yra1, an essential export factor in yeast, interacts with Sub2 (the yeast UAP56 homolog) and Mex67-Mtr2 (the yeast NXF1-p15 homolog) and is thought to be the adaptor protein between Sub2 and Mex67-Mtr2 (28Strasser K. Hurt E. Nature. 2001; 413: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Aly, the Yra1 analog in higher eukaryotes, also interacts with UAP56, although Aly is not essential for mRNA export in higher eukaryotes (25Macmorris M. Brocker C. Blumenthal T. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2003; 9: 847-857Google Scholar, 29Gatfield D. Izaurralde E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), suggesting the existence of other adaptor proteins. In addition, both UAP56 and Aly are part of the Trex complex that is thought to couple transcription and mRNA export (30Strasser K. Masuda S. Mason P. Pfannstiel J. Oppizzi M. Rodriguez-Navarro S. Rondon A.G. Aguilera A. Struhl K. Reed R. Hurt E. Nature. 2002; 417: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). It is unknown whether UAP56’s ATPase or helicase activity is required for its function in mRNA export. Human UAP56 is 428 residues in length and has 35% sequence identity to eIF4A (395 residues), a prototypic DEXD/H-box protein involved in translation initiation. UAP56 and eIF4A both contain the minimal helicase core (∼400 amino acids) without any additional domains. The crystal structure of UAP56 shows that UAP56 is composed of an N-terminal and C-terminal domain connected with a flexible liner (31Zhao R. Shen J. Green M.R. MacMorris M. Blumenthal T. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 1373-1381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 32Shi H. Cordin O. Minder C.M. Linder P. Xu R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17628-17633Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Both domains have a typical RecA-like fold with seven parallel β-strands surrounded by α-helices on both sides. The N-terminal domain contains conserved helicase motifs Q, I, Ia, GG, Ib, II, and III, whereas the C-terminal domain contains helicase motifs IV, QXXR, V, and VI. The overall fold of each RecA-like domain is similar to that of eIF4A. The structure and sequence similarity suggest that UAP56 may have similar enzymatic properties as eIF4A, although there has not been much biochemical characterization of UAP56. We demonstrate in this study that UAP56 is an RNA-stimulated ATPase. UAP56 unwinds dsRNA in vitro in an ATP-dependent manner. The ATPase and helicase activities of UAP56 are weak and are not influenced by two protein factors (U2AF65 and Aly) that are known to interact with UAP56. We demonstrate that a number of UAP56 mutants in the conserved helicase motifs I, II, and III are defective in ATPase and/or helicase activity, providing tools for further study of the roles of these activities in UAP56's function in pre-mRNA splicing and mRNA export. Human UAP56 is subcloned in pGEX-KG as a GST fusion protein and expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). Bacteria were grown to A600 of 0.4–0.6 followed by the addition of 0.2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside to induce protein expression at room temperature overnight. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and lysed with sonication. GST-UAP56 was first purified by glutathione resin. GST was then cleaved off with thrombin, and UAP56 was further purified using a Superdex 200 (S200) gel filtration column. Human U2AF65 d63 (the N-terminal 62 residues deleted) was expressed and purified in a similar manner as UAP56 (see Fig. 1a). GST-Aly was also expressed and purified from E. coli and was a generous gift from B. Erickson and Dr. D. Bentley at the University of Colorado at Denver and Health Sciences Center (see Fig. 1a). All ATPase reactions were performed under the following conditions unless otherwise stated. The reaction mixture (20 μl) contains 2 μm UAP56 (wild type or mutants), trace amounts of [α-32P]ATP, 50 μm cold ATP, 50 μm U30 (30-nt poly(U)) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and stopped with 2 μl of 100 mm EDTA. 4 μl of the reaction mixture was spotted onto a TLC plate, which was developed in a buffer containing 2 m acetic acid and 0.5 m LiCl2 for 1.5 h to separate ADP and ATP. The amount of ATP hydrolyzed was quantified using a PhosphorImager. Error bars in all figures in this study represent standard deviations derived from independently repeated experiments. For kinetic analyses, 0.5 μm UAP56 was incubated with trace amounts of [α-32P]ATP, 20 μm U30, and 5–100 μm cold ATP in the aforementioned buffer at 37 °C. The reaction remains linear for at least 10 min, and the hydrolysis rate for 10 min was used as the initial hydrolysis rate for kinetic analyses. Initial hydrolysis rates were plotted against cold ATP concentrations and fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation using KaleidaGraph to obtain Vmax and Km values. Preparation of the dsRNA Substrates—All single-stranded RNAs used in this study were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies. One strand of the substrate was labeled at the 5′ end with [γ-32P]ATP (GE Healthcare) using polynucleotide kinase at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction mixture was boiled for 5 min to inactivate polynucleotide kinase. The complementary strand was added to reach a molar ratio of 1:1.2 between the labeled and the unlabeled complementary strand. The reaction mixture was boiled for 3 min and cooled to room temperature in 3 h. Labeled dsRNA was purified using a G-25 spin column (GE Healthcare) to remove excess [γ-32P]ATP. Helicase Reaction—All helicase reactions were performed under the following conditions unless otherwise stated. The reaction mixture (20 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 50 mm KCl, 65 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.4 units/μl ribonuclease inhibitor (Fisher), 3 mm ATP, 100 nm unlabeled complementary strand (“trap” RNA) (9Sengoku T. Nureki O. Nakamura A. Kobayashi S. Yokoyama S. Cell. 2006; 125: 287-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), 2.5 nm labeled dsRNA substrate, and 4 μm UAP56. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the reaction was terminated with 5 μl of stop solution (50% glycerol, 0.5% SDS, 100 mm EDTA, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol) followed by treatment with 0.7 μl of proteinase K (900 units/mol) at room temperature for 3 min. The unwound ssRNA was separated from the dsRNA substrate using native PAGE on a 16% polyacrylamide gel. The amount of dsRNA and ssRNA was quantified using a PhosphorImager. The percentage of unwinding was calculated using the following formula: % unwinding = counts for ssRNA/(counts for dsRNA + counts for ssRNA). Background unwinding in the absence of UAP56 (typically 5–10%) was subtracted from the actual percentage of unwinding. It is worth noting that the addition of trap RNA is not absolutely required for the helicase reaction. The maximum percentage of unwinding after 30 min incubation at 37 °C is only slightly lower (∼10%) without the trap RNA (data not shown). UAP56 Is an RNA-stimulated ATPase—We first examined UAP56’s ATPase activity. Human UAP56 was expressed as a GST fusion protein in E. coli. GST-UAP56 was first purified with glutathione resin. GST was then cleaved with thrombin, and the resultant UAP56 was further purified using gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 1a). Purified UAP56 was incubated at 37 °C with a trace amount of [α-32P]ATP and varied amounts of cold ATP. ADP and ATP were separated on a TLC plate, and the amount of ATP hydrolyzed was quantified on a PhosphorImager (Fig. 1b). We found that without RNA, UAP56 has very low ATP hydrolysis in 30 min (Fig. 1c). ATP hydrolysis is stimulated 20-fold in the presence of 50 μm U30 (30-nt poly(U)) (Fig. 1c). Shorter poly(U) (U25) and poly(C) (C30 and C25), as well as three RNAs with arbitrary sequences (RNA1, RNA2, and R13, see Table 1 for sequences), stimulate the ATPase activity to a similar degree (17–23-fold) (Fig. 1c). dsRNA also stimulate UAP56’s ATPase activity, although to a lesser extent (6–8-fold) (Fig. 1c).TABLE 1RNAs used in this studyNameLengthSequence (5′ to 3′)ntRNA125UUUAGUACUCUAGUCCCUUUUUAUARNA240AAUUCCCUUAUAAAAAGGGACUAGAGUACUAAAUGUUUCURNA330CCUUAUAAAAAGGGACUAGAGUACUAAAUGRNA3C30CAUUUAGUACUCUAGUCCCUUUUUAUAAGGR1313GCUUUACGGUGCUR13C13AGCACCGUAAAGCR23-5′23AAAACAAAAUAGCACCGUAAAGCaUnderline indicates the region that base pairs with R13R23-3′23GCUUUACGGUGCUUAAAACAAAAbUnderline indicates the region that base pairs with R13CR1414ACUCUAGUCCCUUUR14C14AAAGGGACUAGAGUR2020GCUUUACGGUGCUAUUUUGUR20C20ACAAAAUAGCACCGUAAAGCa Underline indicates the region that base pairs with R13b Underline indicates the region that base pairs with R13C Open table in a new tab The RNA stimulation of ATPase activity is common to DEXD/H-box proteins and has been observed in other DEXD/H-box proteins including those involved in pre-mRNA splicing. For example, eIF4A’s ATPase activity is stimulated 10–14-fold in the presence of poly(U), poly(A), or poly(C) (33Abramson R.D. Dever T.E. Lawson T.G. Ray B.K. Thach R.E. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3826-3832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Prp16’s ATPase activity is stimulated 8–9-fold by poly(A) and 4–5-fold by poly(U) (34Schwer B. Guthrie C. Nature. 1991; 349: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The initial rate of hydrolysis of Prp22 was stimulated 2.5–4-fold by various RNAs (12Wagner J.D. Jankowsky E. Company M. Pyle A.M. Abelson J.N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2926-2937Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 35Schwer B. Gross C.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2086-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Prp5’s ATPase activity is stimulated by RNAs in a sequence-dependent manner. Poly(U) was best able to stimulate Prp5’s ATPase activity, whereas poly(A) and poly(C) demonstrate little or no stimulation (23O'Day C.L. Dalbadie-McFarland G. Abelson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33261-33267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Furthermore, U2 snRNA better stimulates Prp5’s ATPase activity than other snRNAs and homopolymers, suggesting a mechanism for the specificity of Prp5’s function in the spliceosome assembly. We found that the ATPase activity of UAP56 is similarly stimulated by various RNAs (17–23-fold) without sequence specificity, similar to eIF4A, Prp16, and Prp22 but differing from Prp5. We performed steady state kinetic analysis of UAP56’s ATPase activity with 0.5 μm UAP56 in the presence of 20 μm U30 (Fig. 1d). Fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using KaleidaGraph generated a Vmax of 0.126 ± 0.003 μm/min and Km of 3.3 ± 0.5 μm. Since the kinetic analyses were performed with 0.5 μm UAP56, these data indicate that UAP56 has a kcat of 0.25 ± 0.01/min, similar to eIF4A (0.3/min) under similar conditions (36Abramson R.D. Dever T.E. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6016-6019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2643-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Lorsch and Herschlag (38Lorsch J.R. Herschlag D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2194-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) found that the kcat of eIF4A’s ATPase activity increased 10-fold (3/min) in the presence of large amounts of poly(U) (475 μm). In the case of UAP56, we did not observe significant increase in ATPase activity with poly(U) concentration higher than 20 μm (Fig. 1c). We further examined whether UAP56 can hydrolyze NTPs other than ATP. We performed the ATPase assay in the presence of increasing concentrations of cold ATP, GTP, CTP, and TTP (Fig. 1e). Cold ATP can be hydrolyzed and efficiently compete with the amount of [α-32P]ATP hydrolyzed, whereas cold GTP, CTP, and TTP cannot be hydrolyzed. UAP56 Unwinds dsRNA in Vitro—We first examined whether UAP56 can unwind dsRNA in vitro using a 13-nt blunt end RNA duplex with arbitrary sequence (designated R13/R13C, see Table 1 for sequences) (9Sengoku T. Nureki O. Nakamura A. Kobayashi S. Yokoyama S. Cell. 2006; 125: 287-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 39Rogers Jr., G.W. Lima W.F. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12598-12608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). UAP56 clearly unwinds this dsRNA in a protein concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2a). The helicase activity is weak, and a large amount of UAP56 (0.5 μm or higher) is needed to observe significant unwinding. The weak helicase activity is common to DEXD/H-box helicases, and large amounts of proteins are routinely used for helicase assay of DEXD/H-box proteins. For example, 0.8 μm protein was used for eIF4A’s helicase assay that produces a roughly 35% unwinding of dsRNA with the same substrate (39Rogers Jr., G.W. Lima W.F. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12598-12608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). 10 μm protein was used to demonstrate the helicase activity of the minimum helicase core of Vasa (9Sengoku T. Nureki O. Nakamura A. Kobayashi S. Yokoyama S. Cell. 2006; 125: 287-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). We performed time course analysis of UAP56’s helicase activity. Due to the large amount of UAP56 concentration needed to observe significant duplex unwinding (>>substrate concentration), we cannot perform steady state kinetic analyses to measure Km and kcat. However, it is clear that UAP56 unwinds an increasing amount of dsRNA with time (Fig. 2b). The amount of unwinding reaches saturation at 30 min (Fig. 2b). We further designed substrate R13/R23-5′ and R23-3′/R13C, which contains 13-nt base pairs and a 10-nt 5′ and 3′ overhang, respectively (Table 1). UAP56 unwinds both substrates with similar efficiencies as the R13/R13C substrate (Fig. 2b). UAP56 unwinds R20/R20C, which contains 20-nt base pairs (Table 1) with significantly less efficiency (roughly ¼ of what is unwound for R13/R13C, Fig. 2b). UAP56’s helicase activity does not have particular sequence specificity, and it unwinds R14/R14C, a 14-nt RNA duplex with completely different sequence than R13/R13C (Table 1). Due to the large amount of UAP56 protein used in the helicase assay, we want to ensure that the unwinding we observed is a genuine helicase activity instead of the trap of ssRNA (generated by dissociation from the dsRNA substrates) by the large amount of UAP56. We performed the helicase assay in the presence of non-hydrolyzable or slowly hydrolyzable ATP analogs (AMPPNP or ATP-γ-S), ADP, TTP, GTP, and CTP (Fig. 2c). ATP hydrolysis is clearly required for the unwinding. The non-hydrolyzable AMP-PNP does not support unwinding, and the slowly hydrolyzable ATP-γ-S demonstrates minimal unwinding (Fig. 2c). TTP, GTP, and CTP cannot be hydrolyzed by UAP56 (Fig. 1e) and do not support dsRNA unwinding either (Fig. 2c). Mutational Analyses of UAP56—Structural and biochemical analyses have suggested some general roles of the conserved helicase motifs in DEXD/H-box proteins. Structures of several DEXD/H-box proteins and other helicases in complex with ADP or ATP analogs show that Lys in motif I (GKT) interacts with the phosphate group of ATP and is important for ATP binding (9Sengoku T. Nureki O. Nakamura A. Kobayashi S. Yokoyama S. Cell. 2006; 125: 287-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 32Shi H. Cordin O. Minder C.M. Linder P. Xu R.M. Proc.

Biol. 2002; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). The Glu in motif II (DEXD) has been postulated to be the key catalytic residue that activates a water molecule to hydrolyze ATP in DEXD/H-box proteins and other helicases (8Cordin O. Banroques J. Tanner N.K. Linder P. Gene (Amst.). 2006; 367: 17-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar, 9Sengoku T. Nureki O. Nakamura A. Kobayashi S. Yokoyama S.

Biol. 2002; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). The last Asp residue in motif II and the Ser-Ala-Thr residues in motif III (SAT) do not interact with ATP or RNA but participate in interdomain interactions between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains upon ATP and RNA binding (9Sengoku T. Nureki O. Nakamura A. Kobayashi S. Yokoyama S. Cell. 2006; 125: 287-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). These residues were thought to be important for the unwinding activity of DEXD/H-box proteins. In eIF4A, a Lys to Asn mutant in motif I and an Glu to Gln mutant in motif II abolished ATPase activity (42Rozen F. Pelletier J. Trachsel H. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4061-4063Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 43Pause A. Methot N. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6789-6798Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). An Asp to His mutant in the last Asp in motif II (DEAD) and the SAT to AAA mutant in motif III of eIF4A demonstrated a 2–3-fold increase of kcat in ATPase activity but abolished helicase activity (37Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2643-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). We generated a number of UAP56 mutants in the conserved helicase motifs I, II, and III and tested their ATPase and helicase activity (Fig. 3a). We found that K95A, GKT/AAA, and E197A mutants of UAP56 completely abolished ATPase activity (Fig. 3b), consistent with the proposed key role of Lys-95 in ATP binding and Glu-197 in ATP hydrolysis. The loss of ATPase activity leads to the abolishment of helicase activity in these mutants (Fig. 3c). The D199A mutant demonstrates increased ATPase activity when compared with the wild type (Fig. 3b). The SAT/AAA mutant behaves somewhat differently from the same mutant in eIF4A and demonstrates significantly decreased ATPase activity (Fig. 3b). The amounts of ATP hydrolyzed by D199A and SAT/AAA are roughly 147% and 32% of the amounts hydrolyzed by wild type UAP56 (Fig. 3b). Both D199A and SAT/AAA mutants completely lost their helicase activity (Fig. 3c), consistent with the hypothesis that these residues are involved in interdomain interactions and are important for the unwinding activity of DEXD/H-box proteins. Potential Influence of UAP56’s ATPase and Helicase Activities by Other Proteins—UAP56 has a genuine but weak ATPase and helicase activity that is similar to eIF4A alone. In the case of eIF4A, the presence of eIF4B and eIF4H stimulates eIF4A’s ATPase (∼3-fold) and helicase activity (4–8-fold) (44Richter-Cook N.J. Dever T.E. Hensold J.O. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7579-7587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 45Rogers Jr., G.W. Richter N.J. Lima W.F. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30914-30922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). These stimulations likely contribute to the ability of eIF4A to efficiently unwind secondary structures in the 5′-untranslated region of the mRNA. On the other hand, the weak ATPase activity of eFI4AIII is inhibited by Magoh-Y14, so eIF4AIII can bind to the ssRNA tightly (18Ballut L. Marchadier B. Baguet A. Tomasetto C. Seraphin B. Le Hir H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 861-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). We evaluated here whether UAP56’s ATPase and helicase activity can be affected by protein factors known to interact with UAP56. The two best known protein partners of UAP56 are U2AF65 and Aly. U2AF65 is an essential pre-mRNA splicing factor that recognizes the PYT of an intron (46Zamore P.D. Patton J.G. Green M.R. Nature. 1992; 355: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). UAP56 was first identified through its interaction with U2AF65 using yeast two-hybrid assay, and this interaction was later confirmed using an in vitro pull down assay (22Fleckner J. Zhang M. Valcarcel J. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1864-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The region of U2AF65 that interacts with UAP56 has been mapped to the linker region of U2AF65 (residues 95–138) (22Fleckner J. Zhang M. Valcarcel J. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1864-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Aly is an export factor that has been shown to interact with UAP56 in vitro and is thought to serve as an adaptor between UAP56 and the heterodimeric transport receptor NXF1-p15 (47Luo M.L. Zhou Z. Magni K. Christoforides C. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Reed R. Nature. 2001; 413: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). We expressed and purified both the human U2AF65 d63 (the N-terminal 62 residues deleted) and GST-Aly from E. coli. U2AF65 d63 and GST-Aly alone do not show any ATPase and helicase activity (Fig. 4). The addition of U2AF65 and GST-Aly to UAP56 does not influence UAP56’s ATPase or helicase activity (Fig. 4). We demonstrated that UAP56 has an RNA-stimulated ATPase activity and that UAP56 can only hydrolyze ATP but not other NTPs. Even with the stimulation of RNA, UAP56's ATPase activity is weak (kcat = 0.25/min), comparable with the weak ATPase activity of eIF4A under similar conditions (kcat = 0.3/min) (36Abramson R.D. Dever T.E. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6016-6019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2643-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The RNA stimulation of UAP56's ATPase activity does not have a strong preference for the sequence and length of the RNA. However, ssRNA stimulates UAP56's ATPase activity much more strongly than dsRNA. dsRNA has been shown to have a weaker stimulatory effect than ssRNA for DEXD/H-box protein RhlE (48Bizebard T. Ferlenghi I. Iost I. Dreyfus M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7857-7866Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) but a much stronger stimulatory effect than ssRNA for DEXD/H-box protein p68 (49Huang Y. Liu Z.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12810-12815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The functional significance, if any, of the stronger stimulation of UAP56's ATPase activity by ssRNA remains to be determined. We also show that UAP56 can unwind short dsRNA (13-nt base pairs) with blunt ends, 5′ overhangs, or 3′ overhangs with similar efficiency and in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent manner. This result does not necessarily conflict with our observation that ssRNA stimulates UAP56’s ATPase activity more strongly than dsRNA. In our helicase assay (which is similar to a typical helicase assay used for other DEXD/H-box proteins such as Vasa (9Sengoku T. Nureki O. Nakamura A. Kobayashi S. Yokoyama S. Cell. 2006; 125: 287-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) and eIF4A (39Rogers Jr., G.W. Lima W.F. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12598-12608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar)), both the dsRNA substrate concentration (2.5 nm) and the single strand trap RNA (100 nm) are too low to have any significant stimulatory effect on UAP56’s ATPase activity. Other DEXD/H-box proteins such as eIF4A and Vasa have also been shown to efficiently unwind substrates with blunt ends (9Sengoku T. Nureki O. Nakamura A. Kobayashi S. Yokoyama S. Cell. 2006; 125: 287-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 39Rogers Jr., G.W. Lima W.F. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12598-12608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Recent structural and biochemical studies have suggested that DEXD/H-box proteins may directly load onto the duplex region and unwind the double strands (for example, by bending RNA), providing a plausible mechanism for the efficient unwinding of blunt end substrates by these DEXD/H-box proteins (9Sengoku T. Nureki O. Nakamura A. Kobayashi S. Yokoyama S. Cell. 2006; 125: 287-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 11Yang Q. Jankowsky E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 981-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The unwinding activity of UAP56 does not have sequence specificity and the efficiency of unwinding dramatically reduces with the increasing length of RNA duplexes. The weak ATPase and helicase activity of UAP56 raises the possibility that other protein factors may stimulate this activity and be involved in the in vivo function of UAP56. eIF4B and eIF4H stimulate eIF4A's weak ATPase and helicase activity and likely facilitate eIF4A's function in translation initiation (44Richter-Cook N.J. Dever T.E. Hensold J.O. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7579-7587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 45Rogers Jr., G.W. Richter N.J. Lima W.F. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30914-30922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). A recent report demonstrates that Gle1 stimulates the weak ATPase activity of the DEXD/H-box protein Dbp5, and this stimulation is important for Dbp5's function in mRNA export (50Weirich C.S. Erzberger J.P. Flick J.S. Berger J.M. Thorner J. Weis K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 668-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Inhibition of ATPase activity has also been observed as a possible mode of action for DEXD/H-box proteins (18Ballut L. Marchadier B. Baguet A. Tomasetto C. Seraphin B. Le Hir H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 861-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). We show that two of UAP56's interaction partners (U2AF65 and Aly) do not have any influence on UAP56's ATPase and helicase activity. GST-UAP56 pulldown assay brought down components of the Trex complex and several other proteins (hTho2, hHpr1, hTex1, Aly, fSAP79, fSAP35, fSAP24), suggesting direct or indirect interaction between these proteins and UAP56 (30Strasser K. Masuda S. Mason P. Pfannstiel J. Oppizzi M. Rodriguez-Navarro S. Rondon A.G. Aguilera A. Struhl K. Reed R. Hurt E. Nature. 2002; 417: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 51Masuda S. Das R. Cheng H. Hurt E. Dorman N. Reed R. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1512-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). It remains to be seen whether any of these proteins influence UAP56's weak ATPase and helicase activity. We have analyzed the ATPase and helicase activity of a number of UAP56 mutants in the conserved helicase motifs I to III. UAP56 mutants such as K95A, GKT/AAA, and E197A in motifs I and II completely abolish both the ATPase and the helicase activities. The D199A mutant in motif II uncouples ATPase and helicase activity, which retains high ATPase activity but completely loses helicase activity. These mutants will be valuable tools for deciphering whether the ATPase or helicase activity or both are important for UAP56's function. ATPase and helicase analyses of these mutants also confirm that the ATPase and helicase activity we observed for wild type UAP56 are genuine and do not come from potential E. coli contamination. Although UAP56 is clearly essential for both pre-mRNA splicing and mRNA export, the detailed mechanisms of how UAP56 facilitates splicing and export are unknown. Our biochemical and mutational analyses performed here lay a foundation for further unraveling the role of UAP56's ATPase and helicase activity in pre-mRNA splicing and mRNA export."
https://openalex.org/W2084525242,"Loss of inner ear sensory hair cells (HC) is a leading cause of human hearing loss and balance disorders. Unlike mammals, many lower vertebrates can regenerate these cells. We used cross-species microarrays to examine this process in the avian inner ear. Specifically, changes in expression of over 1700 transcription factor (TF) genes were investigated in hair cells of auditory and vestibular organs following treatment with two different damaging agents and regeneration in vitro. Multiple components of seven distinct known signaling pathways were clearly identifiable: TGFbeta, PAX, NOTCH, WNT, NFKappaB, INSULIN/IGF1 and AP1. Numerous components of apoptotic and cell cycle control pathways were differentially expressed, including p27(KIP) and TFs that regulate its expression. A comparison of expression trends across tissues and treatments revealed identical patterns of expression that occurred at identical times during regenerative proliferation. Network analysis of the patterns of gene expression in this large dataset also revealed the additional presence of many components (and possible network interactions) of estrogen receptor signaling, circadian rhythm genes and parts of the polycomb complex (among others). Equal numbers of differentially expressed genes were identified that have not yet been placed into any known pathway. Specific time points and tissues also exhibited interesting differences: For example, 45 zinc finger genes were specifically up-regulated at later stages of cochlear regeneration. These results are the first of their kind and should provide the starting point for more detailed investigations of the role of these many pathways in HC recovery, and for a description of their possible interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2048479510,"The mechanisms that are responsible for the restricted pattern of expression of the VE-cadherin gene in endothelial cells are not clearly understood. Regulation of expression is under the control of an approximately 140 bp proximal promoter that provides basal, non-endothelial specific expression. A larger region contained within the 2.5 kb genomic DNA sequence located ahead of the transcription start is involved in the specific expression of the gene in endothelial cells. We show here that the VE-cadherin promoter contains several putative hypoxia response elements (HRE) which are able to bind endothelial nuclear factors under normoxia. The VE-cadherin gene is not responsive to hypoxia but hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-2alpha specifically activates the promoter while HIF-1alpha does not. The HRE, that are involved in this activity have been identified. Further, we show that HIF-2alpha cooperates with the Ets-1 transcription factor for activation of the VE-cadherin promoter and that this synergy is dependent on the binding of Ets-1 to DNA. This cooperative action of HIF-2alpha with Ets-1 most probably participates to the transcriptional regulation of expression of the gene in endothelial cells. This mechanism may also be involved in the expression of the VE-cadherin gene by tumor cells in the process of vascular mimicry."
https://openalex.org/W2127272001,"Little is known about the molecular basis of somatosensory mechanotransduction in mammals. We screened a library of peptide toxins for effects on mechanically activated currents in cultured dorsal root ganglion neurons. One conopeptide analogue, termed NMB-1 for noxious mechanosensation blocker 1, selectively inhibits (IC50 1 µM) sustained mechanically activated currents in a subset of sensory neurons. Biotinylated NMB-1 retains activity and binds selectively to peripherin-positive nociceptive sensory neurons. The selectivity of NMB-1 was confirmed by the fact that it has no inhibitory effects on voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels, or ligand-gated channels such as acid-sensing ion channels or TRPA1 channels. Conversely, the tarantula toxin, GsMTx-4, which inhibits stretch-activated ion channels, had no effects on mechanically activated currents in sensory neurons. In behavioral assays, NMB-1 inhibits responses only to high intensity, painful mechanical stimulation and has no effects on low intensity mechanical stimulation or thermosensation. Unexpectedly, NMB-1 was found to also be an inhibitor of rapid FM1-43 loading (a measure of mechanotransduction) in cochlear hair cells. These data demonstrate that pharmacologically distinct channels respond to distinct types of mechanical stimuli and suggest that mechanically activated sustained currents underlie noxious mechanosensation. NMB-1 thus provides a novel diagnostic tool for the molecular definition of channels involved in hearing and pressure-evoked pain."
https://openalex.org/W1998429166,"The genus Vitis is represented by several coexisting species in Europe. Our study focuses on naturalised rootstocks that originate in viticulture. The consequences of their presence to the landscape and to native European species (Vitis vinifera ssp. silvestris) are evaluated. This study compares ecological traits (seven qualitative and quantitative descriptors) and the genetic diversity (10 SSR markers) of populations of naturalised rootstocks and native wild grapevines. 18 large naturalised rootstock populations were studied in the Rhône watershed. Wild European grapevines are present in four main habitats (screes, alluvial forests, hedges, and streamside hedges). In contrast, naturalised rootstock populations are mainly located in alluvial forests, but they clearly take advantage of alluvial system dynamics and connectivity at the landscape level. These latter populations appear to reproduce sexually, and show a higher genetic diversity than Vitis vinifera ssp. silvestris. The regrouping of naturalised rootstocks in interconnected populations tends to create active hybrid swarms of rootstocks. The rootstocks show characters of invasive plants. The spread of naturalised rootstocks in the environment, the acceleration of the decline of the European wild grapevine, and the propagation of genes of viticultural interest in natural populations are potential consequences that should be kept in mind when undertaking appropriate management measures."
https://openalex.org/W2101490130,"Although the actin cytoskeleton has been implicated in the control of NADPH oxidase in phagocytosis, very little is known about the cytoskeletal regulation of endothelial NADPH oxidase assembly and activation. Here, we report a role for cortactin and the tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin in hyperoxia-induced NADPH oxidase activation and ROS production in human pulmonary artery ECs (HPAECs). Exposure of HPAECs to hyperoxia for 3 h induced NADPH oxidase activation, as demonstrated by enhanced superoxide production. Hyperoxia also caused a thickening of the subcortical dense peripheral F-actin band and increased the localization of cortactin in the cortical regions and lamellipodia at cell-cell borders that protruded under neighboring cells. Pretreatment of HPAECs with the actin-stabilizing agent phallacidin attenuated hyperoxia-induced cortical actin thickening and ROS production, whereas cytochalasin D and latrunculin A enhanced basal and hyperoxia-induced ROS formation. In HPAECs, a 3-h hyperoxic exposure enhanced the tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin and interaction between cortactin and p47phox, a subcomponent of the EC NADPH oxidase, when compared with normoxic cells. Furthermore, transfection of HPAECs with cortactin small interfering RNA or myristoylated cortactin Src homology domain 3 blocking peptide attenuated ROS production and the hyperoxia-induced translocation of p47phox to the cell periphery. Similarly, down-regulation of Src with Src small interfering RNA attenuated the hyperoxia-mediated phosphorylation of cortactin tyrosines and blocked the association of cortactin with actin and p47phox. In addition, the hyperoxia-induced generation of ROS was significantly lower in ECs expressing a tyrosine-deficient mutant of cortactin than in vector control or wild-type cells. These data demonstrate a novel function for cortactin and actin in hyperoxia-induced activation of NADPH oxidase and ROS generation in human lung endothelial cells.

In HPAECs, a 3-h hyperoxic exposure enhanced the tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin and interaction between cortactin and p47phox, a subcomponent of the EC NADPH oxidase, when compared with normoxic cells. Furthermore, transfection of HPAECs with cortactin small interfering RNA or myristoylated cortactin Src homology domain 3 blocking peptide attenuated ROS production and the hyperoxia-induced translocation of p47phox to the cell periphery. Similarly, down-regulation of Src with Src small interfering RNA attenuated the hyperoxia-mediated phosphorylation of cortactin tyrosines and blocked the association of cortactin with actin and p47phox. In addition, the hyperoxia-induced generation of ROS was significantly lower in ECs expressing a tyrosine-deficient mutant of cortactin than in vector control or wild-type cells. These data demonstrate a novel function for cortactin and actin in hyperoxia-induced activation of NADPH oxidase and ROS generation in human lung endothelial cells. An emerging theme in vascular physiology and pathophysiology is the generation and involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS), 2The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; EC, endothelial cell; HPAEC, human pulmonary artery endothelial cell; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; siRNA, silencing RNA; Nox, NADPH oxidases; O2ċ¯ superoxide; SH3, Src homology 2; CBP, cortactin SH3 domain blocking peptide; EBM, endothelial cell basal medium; DCFDA, 6-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate; HO, hyperoxia; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TBST, Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PRR, proline-rich regions; FBS, fetal bovine serum; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; fMLP, formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine; EGM, endothelial cell growth medium. 2The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; EC, endothelial cell; HPAEC, human pulmonary artery endothelial cell; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; siRNA, silencing RNA; Nox, NADPH oxidases; O2ċ¯ superoxide; SH3, Src homology 2; CBP, cortactin SH3 domain blocking peptide; EBM, endothelial cell basal medium; DCFDA, 6-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate; HO, hyperoxia; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TBST, Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PRR, proline-rich regions; FBS, fetal bovine serum; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; fMLP, formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine; EGM, endothelial cell growth medium. such as superoxide anion ( O2ċ¯) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), as second messengers in altering key cellular responses (1Clempus R.E.

As one of many potential sources of ROS, vascular NADPH oxidase plays a significant role in basal as well as agonist-mediated ROS/O2ċ¯ generation (4Cave A.C. Brewer A.C. Narayanapanicker A. Ray R.

Activation of phagocytic NADPH oxidase requires the assembly of the cytosolic p47phox, p67phox, p40phox, and Rac2 with membrane-associated cytochrome b558 reductase, which consists of p22phox and gp91phox (Nox2) (7Nauseed W.M.

Vascular cells express most of the subcomponents of phagocytic NADPH oxidase subunits, including Rac1 (1Clempus R.E. Griendling K.K. Cardio.

We have recently demonstrated that exposure of human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAECs) to hyperoxia (95% O2) increases the ROS/O2ċ¯ production that is dependent on NADPH oxidase activation and independent of the mitochondrial electron transport or xanthine/xanthine oxidase systems (10Parinandi N.L. Kleinberg M.A. Usatyuk P.V. Cummings R.J. Pennathur A. Cardounel A.J. Zweier J.L. Garcia J.G.N. Natarajan V. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 284 (-L38): L26Google Scholar). The mechanisms of NADPH oxidase activation are complex. In phagocytes, activation of NADPH oxidase requires serine phosphorylation of the cytosolic p47phox, p67phox, and p40phox components, assembly of the phosphorylated subunits with Rac2, and translocation to the phagosomes for association with cytochrome b558. Here, one-electron reduction of molecular O2 to O2ċ¯ occurs with NADPH as the electron donor (7Nauseed W.M. Histochem. Cell. Biol. 2004; 122: 277-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). In leukocytes, formyl-Met-Leu-Phe-OH or phorbol ester stimulates phosphorylation of p47phox at multiple serine residues through reactions involving several protein kinases such as protein kinase C, protein kinase A, and mitogen-activated protein kinases (14El Benna J.

In HPAECs, tumor necrosis factor-α-mediated NADPH oxidase activation and generation of O2ċ¯ is regulated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (18Frey R.S. Gao X. Javaid K. Siddiqui S.S. Rahman A.

Rahman A. Kefer J.C. Minshall R.D. Malik A.B. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1012-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In neutrophils and macrophages, FcγR-mediated activation of NADPH oxidase and ROS production is regulated by the Vav guanine exchange factor and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent phosphorylation of p40phox (20Utomo A. Cullere X. Glogauer M. Swat W. Mayadas T.N. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 6388-6397Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Hyperoxia-dependent activation of lung endothelial cell (EC) NADPH oxidase is also partly regulated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 MAPK, suggesting the involvement of serine/threonine phosphorylation of the subcomponents of the enzyme in regulating ROS production (10Parinandi N.L. Kleinberg M.A. Usatyuk P.V. Cummings R.J. Pennathur A. Cardounel A.J. Zweier J.L. Garcia J.G.N. Natarajan V. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 284 (-L38): L26Google Scholar). Furthermore, in HPAECs, the activation of NADPH oxidase is regulated by Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of p47phox and the association of p47phox, but not p67phox, with Src (21Chowdhury A.K. Watkins T. Parinandi N.L. Saatian B. Kleinberg M.E. Usatyuk P.V. Natarajan V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20700-20711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, angiotensin II-mediated activation of Src in vascular smooth muscle cells results in serine phosphorylation of p47phox, translocation from the cytosol to the membrane, and increased ROS production (22Touyz R.M. Yao G. Schiffrin E.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 981-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Thus, serine or tyrosine phosphorylation of p47phox in response to a stimulus seems to be an important post-translational modification that regulates the assembly translocation and activation of NADPH oxidase in vascular cells (10Parinandi N.L. Kleinberg M.A. Usatyuk P.V. Cummings R.J. Pennathur A. Cardounel A.J. Zweier J.L. Garcia J.G.N. Natarajan V. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 284 (-L38): L26Google Scholar, 21Chowdhury A.K. Watkins T.

However, the mechanisms of assembly and translocation of p47phox with the membrane components of NADPH oxidase are yet to be completely defined. Actin cytoskeleton and other cytoskeletal proteins may play a role in phagocytic and non-phagocytic assembly and the activation of NADPH oxidase (23Yan S.R. Fumagalli L. Dusi S. Berton G. J.

In phorbol ester-stimulated neutrophils, oxidase activity has been shown to co-sediment with the heavy plasma membrane fraction that contains actin and fodrin; furthermore, the labile oxidase can be stabilized by chemical cross-linking and is not extractable by Triton X-100, suggesting that an interaction occurs between the NADPH oxidase complex and actin filaments (28May R.C. Machesky L.M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 144: 1061-1077Crossref Google Scholar, 29El Benna J. Ruedi J.M. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6729-6734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Actin has recently been shown to enhance the in vitro activation of neutrophil NADPH oxidase (30Morimatsu T. Kawagoshi A. Yoshida K. Tamura M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 31Tamura M. Kai T. Tsunawaki S. Lambeth J.D. Kameda K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 1186-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and actin seems to have a putative binding site for p47phox (32Tamura M. Itoh K. Akita H. Takano K. Oku S. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In vascular smooth muscle cells, the angiotensin II-mediated activation of NADPH oxidase and ROS generation is regulated in part by p47phox/actin interaction through cortactin; however, the mechanisms of this interaction remain unclear (33Touyz R.M. Yao G. Quinn M.T. Pagano P.J. Schiffrin E.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 512-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have evaluated the role of the actin cytoskeleton and the actin-binding protein cortactin in hyperoxia-induced translocation of p47phox to cell periphery, activation of NADPH oxidase, and generation of ROS/O2ċ¯. Our results demonstrate that (i) small interfering RNA (siRNA) for cortactin and an SH3 domain peptide directed against cortactin were able to block hyperoxia-mediated ROS/O2ċ¯ production; (ii) hyperoxia increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin and the interaction between cortactin, actin, and p47phox; (iii) knockdown of Src with siRNA decreased hyperoxia-induced phosphorylation of cortactin and the association between p47phox and cortactin; and (iv) cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation at Tyr421, Tyr466, and Tyr482 was essential for the hyperoxia-induced interaction between cortactin and p47phox and ROS/O2ċ¯ production. These results suggest that cortactin may function as a scaffold protein to link and organize the assembly of NADPH oxidase components with the actin cytoskeleton during the generation of ROS in response to hyperoxia in HPAECs.

Preparation of Cell Lysates, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting—HPAECs grown on 100-mm dishes (to ∼90% confluence) were serum-deprived for ∼16-18 h in EBM-2 containing 1% FBS; all subsequent incubations were carried out in serum-free minimal essential medium.

Present theory suggests that instead sexual conflict should be a widespread evolutionary force driving both intersexual coevolutionary arms races and speciation.We combined Bayesian phylogenetics, complete taxon sampling and a multi-gene approach to test the arms race scenario on a robust diving beetle phylogeny. As predicted, suction cups in males and modified dorsal surfaces in females showed a pronounced coevolutionary pattern. The female dorsal modifications impair the attachment ability of male suction cups, but each antagonistic novelty in females corresponds to counter-differentiation of suction cups in males.A recently diverged sibling species pair in Japan is possibly one consequence of this arms race and we suggest that future studies on hypoxia might reveal the key to the extraordinary selection for female counter-adaptations in diving beetles."
https://openalex.org/W2067735856,"Using cationic liposomes to mediate gene delivery by transfection has the advantages of improved safety and simplicity of use over viral gene therapy. Understanding the mechanism by which cationic liposome:DNA complexes are internalized and delivered to the nucleus should help identify which transport steps might be manipulated in order to improve transfection efficiencies. We therefore examined the endocytosis and trafficking of two cationic liposomes, DMRIE-C and Lipofectamine LTX, in CHO cells. We found that DMRIE-C-transfected DNA is internalized via caveolae, while LTX-transfected DNA is internalized by clathrin-mediated endocytosis, with both pathways converging at the late endosome or lysosome. Inhibition of microtubule-dependent transport with nocodazole revealed that DMRIE-C:DNA complexes cannot enter the cytosol directly from caveosomes. Lysosomal degradation of transfected DNA has been proposed to be a major reason for poor transfection efficiency. However, in our system dominant negatives of both Rab7 and its effector RILP inhibited late endosome to lysosome transport of DNA complexes and LDL, but did not affect DNA delivery to the nucleus. This suggests that DNA is able to escape from late endosomes without traversing lysosomes and that caveosome to late endosome transport does not require Rab7 function. Lysosomal inhibition with chloroquine likewise had no effect on transfection product titers. These data suggest that DMRIE-C and LTX transfection complexes are endocytosed by separate pathways that converge at the late endosome or lysosome, but that blocking lysosomal traffic does not improve transfection product yields, identifying late endosome/lysosome to nuclear delivery as a step for future study."
https://openalex.org/W2086039159,"The DSS1 protein interacts with the breast cancer susceptibility protein BRCA2 that plays an integral role in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). DSS1 has also been shown to interact with components of the 26S proteasome in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in human tumour cells. This raises the possibility of functional interplay between the DNA repair machinery and the proteasome. We show here that human DSS1 interacts with the RPN3 and RPN7 proteasome subunits and define regions of DSS1 important for the interactions with RPN3, RPN7 and BRCA2. We also show that BRCA2 interacts with RPN3 and RPN7 and that the BRCA2/RPN7 interaction is independent of DSS1. Finally, and most significantly, we demonstrate that the proteolytic activity of the proteasome is a determinant of the choice of DSB repair pathway; inhibition of proteasome proteolytic activity results in an increase in the utilization of potentially mutagenic single-strand annealing at the expense of a reduction in the level of error-free gene conversion. This confirms a functional link between DSB repair and proteasomal activity."
https://openalex.org/W2071521485,"The long neck of unconventional myosin V is composed of six tandem “IQ motifs,” which are fully occupied by calmodulin (CaM) in the absence of calcium. Calcium regulates the activity, the folded-to-extended conformational transition, and the processive run length of myosin V, and thus, it is important to understand how calcium affects CaM binding to the IQ motifs. Here we used electron cryomicroscopy together with computer-based docking of crystal structures into three-dimensional reconstructions of actin decorated with a motor domain-two IQ complex to provide an atomic model of myosin V in the presence of calcium. Calcium causes a major rearrangement of the bound CaMs, dissociation of CaM bound to IQ motif 2, and propagated changes in the motor domain. Tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy showed that calcium-CaM binds to IQ motifs 1, 3, and 5 in a different conformation than apoCaM. Proteolytic cleavage was consistent with CaM preferentially dissociating from the second IQ motif. The enzymatic and mechanical functions of myosin V can, therefore, be modulated both by calcium-dependent conformational changes of bound CaM as well as by CaM dissociation.

Myosin V is a double-headed, processive motor involved in transport of organelles, mRNA, and membrane trafficking (for review, see Ref. 1Reck-Peterson S.L. Provance Jr., D.W. Mooseker M.S.

The long neck region enables myosin V to take 36-nm steps on actin as it moves in a hand-over-hand fashion, with communication between the heads coordinated via a strain-dependent mechanism (for reviews, see Refs. 2Trybus K.M.

In addition to its mechanical role, the neck is also involved in regulating myosin V function. In the absence of calcium, all six of the IQ motifs of murine myosin V bind apoCaM (4Wang F. Chen L.

Low calcium concentrations or cargo binding in the absence of calcium unfold and activate the molecule, whereas higher calcium concentrations inhibit motility and processive movement by dissociating CaM from one or more of the IQ motifs (5Krementsov D.N.

It is important to know the structure of CaM bound to the IQ motifs in both the apo- and in the calcium-saturated states to fully understand how the neck functions. We have previously developed atomic models for a myosin V motor domain-two IQ complex bound to actin in the absence of calcium and in several nucleotide states that mimic the progression through the ATPase cycle (12Volkmann N. Liu H. Hazelwood L. Krementsova E.B. Lowey S. Trybus K.M. Hanein D. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The key results from that study were 1) ATP opens the long cleft dividing the motor domain, providing a mechanism by which the strong binding actomyosin interface is disrupted, 2) loop 2 at the actin interface is rearranged to act as a tether, when myosin is in the weak binding states, and 3) a pre-powerstroke transition state bound to actin was visualized for the first time through the use of nucleotide analogs and improved computational methods. The actin-bound MD-2IQ in the absence of calcium and nucleotide from our previous study (12Volkmann N. Liu H. Hazelwood L. Krementsova E.B. Lowey S. Trybus K.M. Hanein D. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) was used for comparison with the results presented here in the presence of calcium. A high resolution crystal structure of apoCaM bound to the first two IQ motifs of murine myosin V was also solved recently, which serves as a model for the entire neck of mammalian myosin V (13Houdusse A. Gaucher J.F. Krementsova E. Mui S. Trybus K.M. Cohen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 19326-19331Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It was unclear how apoCaM could bind an IQ motif, because unbound apoCaM exists with both the N-lobe and the C-lobe in a closed, non-gripping conformation. Calcium binding opens both lobes, allowing CaM to adopt a gripping conformation, which is the typical way that CaM binds to and activates a target peptide (14Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1992; 257: 1251-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 15Kuboniwa H. Tjandra N. Grzesiek S. Ren H. Klee C.B. Bax A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 768-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 16Zhang M. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 758-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). The crystal structure revealed that apoCaM adopts a new conformation when bound to the IQ motifs. The C-terminal lobe of each CaM adopts a semi-open conformation that grips the first part of the IQ motif (IQXXXR; X indicates any amino acid), whereas the N-terminal lobe adopts a closed conformation that interacts more weakly with the second part of the motif (GXXXR). A surprising finding was the pivotal role played by the non-consensus residues in the IQ motif, which determine the precise structure of the bound CaM. Each IQ motif is, thus, expected to display some unique interactions with apoCaM, although the overall lobe conformation (semi-open C-lobe, closed N-lobe) remains the same. There has been no structural information to show how calcium affects the binding of CaM to the IQ motifs of myosin V. Here we use electron cryomicroscopy to show that calcium causes the lever arm of actin-bound myosin V to adopt a conformation distinct from that observed when apoCaM is bound to the IQ motifs of myosin V as well as causing propagated changes in the motor domain. Results from fluorescence spectroscopy also show that calcium-CaM bound to an IQ motif peptide adopts a different conformation from bound apoCaM. Microscopy and solution studies implicate IQ motif 2 as the site from which CaM dissociates in the presence of calcium. Calcium, thus, exerts its effect on myosin V function both by changing the conformation of bound CaM as well as by causing CaM dissociation. Protein Preparation—The murine myosin V construct consisting of the motor domain and two CaM binding IQ motifs (MD-2IQ) was truncated at amino acid 820 followed by a C-terminal FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) for purification by affinity chromatography. A similar construct containing one IQ motif (MD-1IQ) was truncated at amino acid 795. This construct was used for image processing to get an independent boundary between the two IQ motifs. Three mutant MD-2IQ constructs were also produced. In each of these, the wild-type DNA sequence at the second IQ motif after the motor domain was replaced by the sequence from the first, fourth, or sixth IQ motif of the wild-type molecule. Protein expression in Sf9 cells and purification is described in Krementsov et al. (5Krementsov D.N. Krementsova E.B. Trybus K.M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Chicken skeletal muscle actin was prepared and stored as described (17Volkmann N. Hanein D. Ouyang G. Trybus K.M. DeRosier D.J. Lowey S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1147-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Adjacent pairs of IQ motifs derived by PCR from the heavy chain of murine myosin V were cloned into pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences), creating a fusion protein containing glutathione S-transferase (GST) at the N terminus followed by a thrombin cleavage site. The 1-2 IQ motif pair corresponds to amino acids 765-820 of the murine myosin V heavy chain, the 3-4 IQ pair to amino acids 813-867, and the 5-6 IQ pair to amino acids 861-908. CaM was cloned into a modified kanamycin-resistant vector (T7 RNA polymerase promoter, p15A origin of replication). The CaM-containing vector (kanamycin-resistant) and the IQ-containing pGEX-2T vector (ampicillin-resistant) were co-transformed into the Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) strain and grown on LB plates containing both antibiotics. Cultures were grown overnight at 37 °C in enriched media (20 g/liter Tryptone, 10 g/liter yeast extract, 5 g/liter NaCl, 2 ml/liter glycerol, and 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2). The cells were disrupted by sonication. The clarified supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B affinity matrix for 1 h at 4 °C. The resin-protein mixture was then poured into a column and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The GST fusion protein was eluted with glutathione (0.154 g of reduced glutathione dissolved in 50 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The GST was removed by thrombin cleavage (10 units/mg of IQ-CaM complex) followed by a second glutathione-Sepharose 4B affinity column to remove the liberated GST. Electron Microscopy of Actomyosin V Complexes—F-actin was diluted to 30-50 μg/ml with 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 3 mm NaN3 just before application to the glow-discharged 400-mesh copper grids coated with holey carbon film. After a 1-min incubation in a humid chamber, the grids were rinsed twice with 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm NaN3 (dilution buffer). The myosin sample was preincubated for 30 min on ice in dilution buffer. The myosin sample, diluted to ≈0.1 mg/ml in dilution buffer, was applied to the grid for 30 s and replaced by an additional drop of sample (30 s). Excess liquid was blotted off, and the grids were plunged into liquid ethane cooled by liquid N2. Low-dose images were recorded with a Tecnai G2 T12 electron microscope (FEI Electron Optics, The Netherlands) equipped with a LaB6 filament and a DH626 cryo-holder (Gatan, Pleasaton, CA) at a nominal magnification of 52,000× using 120 keV and a 1.5-μm defocus and with total electron dose of 10 e-/Å2. Micrographs were digitized with a SCAI scanner (Integraph, Phoenix, AZ) with a pixel size of 0.27 nm on the sample. Reconstruction Procedures—Helical reconstructions were obtained for all data sets with the Brandeis Helical Package (18Owen C.H. Morgan D.G. DeRosier D.J. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) as described (17Volkmann N. Hanein D. Ouyang G. Trybus K.M. DeRosier D.J. Lowey S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1147-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). All reconstructions included 23 layer lines that were trimmed to 2.1-nm resolution. Because this resolution is within the first zero of the contrast transfer function, no phase correction was necessary. The abrupt edge that was introduced by this procedure was smoothed to zero by using a Gaussian falloff. Only layer lines that were found to be statistically significant in at least one of the individual filaments were used and included orders 2, -11, 4, -9, 6, -7, 8, -5, -3, -1, -12, 3, 14, 1, 5, -8, -4, -2, 7, -6, 13, and the equator. Individual filaments were reconstructed separately, aligned in real space (17Volkmann N. Hanein D. Ouyang G. Trybus K.M. DeRosier D.J. Lowey S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1147-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 19Hanein D. Matsudaira P. DeRosier D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), normalized, and averaged. The independent far and near side maps were kept separate and used for cross-validation. The iterative helical real space refinement (IHRSR) method (20Egelman E.H. Ultramicroscopy. 2000; 85: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) is a hybrid approach that uses real-space, single-particle processing and imposition of helical symmetry in an iterative manner. Our implementation uses EMAN (21Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2102) Google Scholar) for the single-particle reconstruction portion and routines adapted from the CoAn suite (22Volkmann N. Hanein D. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 23Volkmann N. Hanein D. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 204-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) to determine and impose the helical symmetry. A box size of 80 × 80 pixels with a 0.54 nm pixel size was used. This corresponds to about 15 asymmetric units of the helix, a little more than one actin crossover. An overlap of 60 pixels was chosen, allowing every asymmetric unit to contribute to four different views of the helix. To generate independent IHRSR reconstructions for cross-validation, the data were split into two random halves which where independently reconstructed. Docking and Modeling—At least two independently derived maps were used to cross-validate all docking, modeling, and segmentation results. An atomic model for filamentous actin, based on rigid-body refinement against fiber diffraction data (24Holmes K.C. Angert I. Kull F.J. Jahn W. Schroder R.R. Nature. 2003; 425: 423-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) followed by refinement against constraints from electron microscopy and cross-linking studies (12Volkmann N. Liu H. Hazelwood L. Krementsova E.B. Lowey S. Trybus K.M. Hanein D. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), was docked into maps of undecorated actin. After real-space alignment (25Hanein D. DeRosier D. Ultramicroscopy. 1999; 76: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), the reconstruction of undecorated actin was subtracted from the respective myosin V-decorated maps. Single units of the actin-bound myosin V densities were isolated with the watershed transform segmentation program (26Volkmann N. J. Struct. Biol. 2002; 138: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The resulting densities, due only to myosin V, were further subsegmented to delineate the densities for the motor domain (MD) and the CaMs. This was done to ensure that the refined positions of the CaM models are confined to the respective density unit and that they are not biased toward the higher density in the neighboring density unit. The boundary between the two CaMs was independently cross-validated by difference mapping of the MD-2IQ reconstruction with a reconstruction of an construct that lacked the second IQ motif (MD-1IQ, data not shown). Statistics-based modular docking (22Volkmann N. Hanein D. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 23Volkmann N. Hanein D. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 204-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) was used throughout to build models of the actin-bound myosin V. The structure was divided into the motor domain and the two CaM regions (IQ1 and IQ2). For the MD docking the available structures were divided into three groups. The post-power-stroke conformation was represented by PDB codes 1mma, 1mmn, 1mmd, 1mmg, 2mys, 1kk7, 1fmv, 1fmw, and 1w7j. The pre-power-stroke conformation was represented by PDB codes 1br1, 1br2, 1br4, 1dfl, 1mnd, and 1vom. The third group contains the myosin V crystal structures with a similar lever-arm position as the post-stroke conformation but a more tightly closed actin binding cleft in the absence of nucleotide; PDB codes 1oe9, 1w8j (four asymmetric units), and 1w7i. There was no significant difference (p < 0.001) between the first and the third group, implying that we cannot pick up the cleft state by docking alone, but the fit of the second group was significantly worse than for the other two groups. Modeling was continued using the docked 1oe9 coordinates. The two bound CaMs were modeled using the CaM-like essential light chain (LC1-sa) taken from the myosin V crystal structure. Docking was done into discrepancy maps that had the MD portion removed. The resulting MD/CaM boundary was very similar to that determined by segmentation. The initial placement of the first CaM was extrapolated from the docked crystal structure and then refined using the refinement module from CoAn. After docking, the contribution of the first CaM model was removed from the map by discrepancy mapping, and then the second CaM model was docked into the remainder without constraints. The discrepancy boundary was again very similar to the one determined independently by difference mapping and segmentation. Regularization with REFMAC5 (27Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar) was performed for all atomic models to relieve distortions in stereochemistry. Discrepancy, Difference, and Structural Flexibility Mapping—For “discrepancy mapping,” density is first calculated from the docked atomic model using electronic scattering factors. Then image-formation and image-analysis artifacts present in the reconstruction are compensated for by matching the Fourier amplitude spectrum of the calculated density to that observed and by scaling the densities appropriately. Last, the modified density is subtracted voxel-wise from the observed reconstruction. The resulting discrepancy maps allow reliable localization of regions where the reconstruction has significantly more density than the model can explain. Through the use of multiple maps and crystal structures, an error estimate (S.D.) for each voxel in the discrepancy maps can be calculated. This feature allows assignment of statistical significance. Peaks were considered significant if their value was at least three times their S.D. The results were cross-validated between the helical reconstructions and the IHRSR maps. “Difference mapping” and error assessment were carried out using the real space averages and variances for helical reconstructions. Difference maps for the IHRSR maps were calculated without error assessment. Before subtracting, the helical reconstructions were aligned to each other using a hybrid real space reciprocal space alignment procedure that includes common features of the two maps in the alignment (19Hanein D. Matsudaira P. DeRosier D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar); alignment involving IHRSR maps was done using real-space correlation (22Volkmann N. Hanein D. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 23Volkmann N. Hanein D. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 204-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For difference maps between helical reconstructions, we tested the significance of each difference between corresponding pairs of real space voxels using a classic t test at a confidence level of 99.9% (p < 0.001). Difference maps between different IHRSR maps and between IHRSR maps and helical maps were used for cross-validation. Only differences that were consistently present (and significant at 99.9% were applicable) were used for interpretation. Absolute values of individual differences (AVID) was used to map intensity variations of individual actomyosin units within filaments (28Rost L.E. Hanein D. DeRosier D.J. Ultramicroscopy. 1998; 72: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These variations can either be caused by partial occupancy or by a mixture of conformations. Because the AVID procedure excludes the layer line data used for helical reconstruction, the resulting AVID map contains data that is independent of the data used for the three-dimensional reconstruction and difference mapping. Four AVID maps were generated of myosin V in the presence (two maps) and absence of calcium (two maps). Only peaks present in the two AVID maps of myosin V in the presence of calcium and not in the AVID maps of myosin V in the absence of calcium were considered for interpretation as effects of calcium addition. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Fluorescence measurements were performed on an ISS Inc. spectrofluorometer (Model ISS K2; Champaign, IL) equipped with a 300-watt xenon arc lamp as an excitation source and a temperature controlled cell-housing (20 °C). Tryptophan fluorescence of the CaM-IQ complexes was excited at 290 nm, and the emission spectra were collected from 300 to 400 nm with a 320-nm cutoff filter in the emission path. The spectral bandwidths were 8 nm for excitation and 8 nm for emission. Emission spectra were recorded in ratio mode. Buffers contained final concentrations of either 1 mm EGTA or 1 mm EGTA and 1.5 mm CaCl2. Acrylamide Quenching of Trp Fluorescence—Acrylamide quenching was used to determine the degree of exposure of the single tryptophan residue present in each IQ-CaM complex. The decrease in fluorescence intensity at the wavelength maximum was measured as a function of increasing acrylamide concentration. The fluorescence intensity in the absence of quencher (F0) divided by the fluorescence intensity in the presence of quencher (F) was used to quantify the change in fluorescence resulting from acrylamide quenching (F0/F). F0/F was plotted as a function of acrylamide concentration, [Q], and fit to the Stern-Volmer relationship taking into account both static (V) and dynamic quenching (KSV) constants: F0/F = (1 + KSV[Q])(exp V[Q]) (29Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 672-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). Buffers contained final concentrations of either 1 mm EGTA or 1 mm EGTA and 1.5 mm CaCl2. Thrombin Cleavage—CaM-IQ complexes (0.4 mg/ml in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm CaCl2) were cleaved with human α-thrombin at 10 units/mg of complex (Hematologic Technologies Inc.) for 5 h at 37 °C. The proteolytic products were analyzed on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel. The wild-type and mutant MD-2IQ complexes (0.5 mg/ml in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 37 °C with either 0.4 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA) were similarly cleaved with 10 units of thrombin/mg protein and analyzed on 6.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Atomic Model of Myosin V Bound to Actin in the Presence of Calcium—Electron cryomicroscopy and helical reconstruction techniques were used to generate three-dimensional maps for a myosin V motor domain-2IQ (MD-2IQ) construct bound to actin in the presence of calcium and in the absence of nucleotide (Fig. 1). The comparable experiments done without calcium have been previously described and are used for comparison with the results described here (12Volkmann N. Liu H. Hazelwood L. Krementsova E.B. Lowey S. Trybus K.M. Hanein D. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). MD-2IQ contains the motor domain and the two IQ motifs adjacent to it together with bound CaM. The CaM molecules are sequentially numbered with respect to their position relative to the MD, with the first CaM adjacent to the MD. The data sets were first processed using standard helical reconstruction techniques. In contrast to the well defined density of the second CaM in the calcium-free actomyosin three-dimensional maps (12Volkmann N. Liu H. Hazelwood L. Krementsova E.B. Lowey S. Trybus K.M. Hanein D. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the second CaM was difficult to resolve in the presence of calcium. Use of the iterative real space refinement method (20Egelman E.H. Ultramicroscopy. 2000; 85: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), a technique that includes classification procedures capable of sorting mixtures of actin-bound myosin conformations (12Volkmann N.

Cell. 2005; 19: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), was needed to resolve the second CaM. Even after sorting, the density for the second CaM is considerably less well defined than the one for the first CaM, but the definition is now good enough to model the CaM into the density (Fig. 1). An atomic model was generated using a quantitative fitting procedure, based on existing crystal structures (see “Materials and Methods”). The same approach was previously used to generate a model for actin-bound MD-2IQ in the absence of calcium (12Volkmann N. Liu H. Hazelwood L. Krementsova E.B. Lowey S. Trybus K.M. Hanein D. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). There are no significant differences in the docked orientation and position of the actin-bound motor domain when compared with the calcium-free state, but the CaMs do move substantially (see below). Calcium-dependent Changes in the Motor Domain—To analyze changes upon the addition of calcium, we calculated four types of maps in the motor-domain region (see also “Materials and Methods”); (i) discrepancy maps, obtained by subtracting the density calculated for the atomic model from the density of the three-dimensional reconstruction (magenta in Fig. 2; this approach identifies regions of higher density in the reconstruction that are not accounted for by the atomic models), (ii) difference maps subtracting the density of the maps in the absence of calcium from the density in its presence (yellow in Fig. 2; these maps indicate strengthening of density features when calcium is added), (iii) difference maps subtracting the density of the maps in the presence of calcium from the density in the absence of calcium (green in Fig. 2; these maps indicate weakening of density upon addition of calcium), (iv) AVID maps, indicating either partial occupancy or structural flexibility (blue peaks in Fig. 2; this type of map was calculated in the entire map, including the IQ region). Discrepancy mapping has been previously used to show whether the long cleft separating the upper and lower 50-kDa domains of the motor domain was closed or open in different nucleotide states in the actomyosin complex (12Volkmann N. Liu H. Hazelwood L. Krementsova E.B. Lowey S. Trybus K.M. Hanein D. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 17Volkmann N. Hanein D. Ouyang G.

In the absence of nucleotide, the long cleft of actin-bound MD-2IQ in the presence of calcium is closed to the same extent as was seen in the absence of calcium. Loop 2, the ends of which are colored blue (Fig. 2E) shows the only discrepancy peak (Fig. 2, A-C and E, magenta density). This discrepancy peak is interpreted as showing that this region is stabilized upon binding to actin. Stabilization of loop 2 upon actin binding was previously reported for myosin V in the presence or absence of various nucleotides (12Volkmann N. Liu H. Hazelwood L. Krementsova E.B. Lowey S. Trybus K.M. Hanein D. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) as well as for smooth muscle and skeletal muscle myosin II (17Volkmann N.

https://openalex.org/W1986030144,"Decoding of mRNAs is performed by aminoacyl tRNAs (aa-tRNAs). This process is highly accurate, however, at low frequencies (10(-3) - 10(-4)) the wrong aa-tRNA can be selected, leading to incorporation of aberrant amino acids. Although our understanding of what constitutes the correct or cognate aa-tRNA:mRNA interaction is well defined, a functional distinction between near-cognate or single mismatched, and unpaired or non-cognate interactions is lacking.Misreading of several synonymous codon substitutions at the catalytic site of firefly luciferase was assayed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Analysis of the results in the context of current kinetic and biophysical models of aa-tRNA selection suggests that the defining feature of near-cognate aa-tRNAs is their potential to form mini-helical structures with A-site codons, enabling stimulation of GTPase activity of eukaryotic Elongation Factor 1A (eEF1A). Paromomycin specifically stimulated misreading of near-cognate but not of non-cognate aa-tRNAs, providing a functional probe to distinguish between these two classes. Deletion of the accessory elongation factor eEF1Bgamma promoted increased misreading of near-cognate, but hyperaccurate reading of non-cognate codons, suggesting that this factor also has a role in tRNA discrimination. A mutant of eEF1Balpha, the nucleotide exchange factor for eEF1A, promoted a general increase in fidelity, suggesting that the decreased rates of elongation may provide more time for discrimination between aa-tRNAs. A mutant form of ribosomal protein L5 promoted hyperaccurate decoding of both types of codons, even though it is topologically distant from the decoding center.It is important to distinguish between near-cognate and non-cognate mRNA:tRNA interactions, because such a definition may be important for informing therapeutic strategies for suppressing these two different categories of mutations underlying many human diseases. This study suggests that the defining feature of near-cognate aa-tRNAs is their potential to form mini-helical structures with A-site codons in the ribosomal decoding center. An aminoglycoside and a ribosomal factor can be used to distinguish between near-cognate and non-cognate interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1973069555,"Due to its inherent asymmetry, competition for light is thought to cause loss of diversity from eutrophied systems. However, most of the work on this topic in grasslands has been phenomenological and has not measured light directly. We present the results of one of the few mechanistic experiments investigating the outcome of short-term competition using measurements of light interception from monocultures of five perennial grass species grown under fertilized and irrigated conditions. We found that the level of incident light intercepted by each species in monoculture, a direct measure of resource-reduction ability, was an excellent predictor of the relative competitive effect in pairwise mixtures. Competition for light was asymmetric in relation to differences in light intercepting ability. Our results are consistent with the idea that when light is a limiting resource, competition between species for this resource can be asymmetric, contributing to high dominance and low diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2078308178,"Activation of immune cells has to be tightly controlled to prevent detrimental hyperactivation. In this regulatory process molecules of the C-type lectin-like family play a central role. Here we describe a new member of this family, CLEC12B. The extracellular domain of CLEC12B shows considerable homology to the activating natural killer cell receptor NKG2D, but unlike NKG2D, CLEC12B contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif in its intracellular domain. Despite the homology, CLEC12B does not appear to bind NKG2D ligands and therefore does not represent the inhibitory counterpart of NKG2D. However, CLEC12B has the ability to counteract NKG2D-mediated signaling, and we show that this function is dependent on the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif and the recruitment of the phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2. Using monoclonal anti-CLEC12B antibodies we found de novo expression of this receptor on in vitro generated human macrophages and on the human myelo-monocytic cell line U937 upon phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate treatment, suggesting that this receptor plays a role in myeloid cell function.

Activation of the immune system has to be tightly regulated to prevent the attack of self-antigens and the development of autoimmunity (1Jabri B. Meresse B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2006; 298: 139-156PubMed Google Scholar). This is in part accomplished by a sophisticated system of various receptors that create a delicate balance of activating and inhibitory signals (2Lanier L.L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 326-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 3Taylor L.S. Paul S.P. McVicar D.W. Rev. Immunogenet. 2000; 2: 204-219PubMed Google Scholar). These receptors are present on different immune cells but play a major role for the innate immune system. Many receptors share common signaling motifs to transmit their signal into the cell. Activating receptors usually signal via the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif containing tyrosine residues that can be phosphorylated upon receptor engagement and can recruit Syk family kinases (4Humphrey M.B. Lanier L.L. Nakamura M.C. Immunol. Rev. 2005; 208: 50-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Inhibitory receptors often possess an Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Inhibition Motif (ITIM), 4The abbreviations used are: ITIM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif; NK, natural killer; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; mAb, monoclonal antibody. which can recruit phosphatases upon phosphorylation (5Moretta L. Moretta A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2004; 16: 626-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). These phosphatases, like SHP-1 or SHP-2, are able to de-phosphorylate and therefore inhibit intracellular factors that otherwise would promote cellular activation (6Stebbins C.C. Watzl C. Billadeau D.D. Leibson P.J. Burshtyn D.N. Long E.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6291-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Interestingly, many activating and inhibitory receptors come in pairs, with a strong homology of the extracellular domains and partially overlapping ligand specificity but opposite signaling capacities (2Lanier L.L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 326-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). One reason for the existence of these receptor pairs might be to avoid extreme immune reactions to minor threats. Examples for these paired receptors are killer cell Ig-like receptors on natural killer (NK) cells, which comprise inhibitory and activating receptors, both recognizing the same major histocompatibility complex class I ligand (5Moretta L. Moretta A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2004; 16: 626-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 7Stewart C.A. Laugier-Anfossi F. Vely F. Saulquin X. Riedmuller J. Tisserant A. Gauthier L. Romagne F. Ferracci G. Arosa F.A. Moretta A. Sun P.D. Ugolini S. Vivier E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13224-13229Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Also in the family of lectin-like receptors can be found antithetic pairs that are specific for the same ligand but transmit opposing signals (8Lopez-Botet M. Bellon T. Llano M. Navarro F. Garcia P. de Miguel M. Hum. Immunol. 2000; 61: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For example, the NKG2A-CD94 heterodimer transmits an inhibitory signal and NKG2C-CD94 signals in an activating fashion while both receptors recognize the same ligand, HLA-E. NKG2D is a C-type lectin-like receptor and plays an important role for the activation of natural killer cells (9Cerwenka A. Lanier L.L. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 1: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). NKG2D has no intracellular signaling domain but instead pairs with the adaptor molecules DAP10 and DAP12 to mediate an activating signal. So far, no inhibitory counterpart for NKG2D has been described. Therefore we conducted a data base search for molecules with a high homology to the NKG2D extracellular domain. With this approach we identified a novel cell surface receptor encoded within the same chromosomal region as NKG2D. Here we describe the molecular cloning, biochemical and initial functional characterization of CLEC12B, a new inhibitory receptor of the lectin-like family. Cells and Antibodies—Cell lines used in this study were human embryonic kidney 293T, Ba/F3 transduced with NKG2D ligands, P815, and NKL. Human monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells using anti-CD14-positive selection beads (Miltenyi) and used for the in vitro generation of macrophages as described (10Nedvetzki S. Sowinski S. Eagle R.A. Harris J. Vely F. Pende D. Trowsdale J. Vivier E. Gordon S. Davis D.M. Blood. 2007; 109: 3776-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Antibodies used were anti-histidine tag (Serotec, Oxford, UK), anti-SHP-1, anti-SHP-2 (BD Biosciences), anti-actin (Sigma), biotinylated anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10; Upstate, Charlottesville, VA), phycoerythrin-streptavidin, horseradish peroxidase-goat anti-mouse IgG, biotinylated goat anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA), horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin (Amersham Biosciences), MOPC-21 (Sigma), and anti-NKG2D (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Mouse monoclonal anti-CLEC12B antibodies were produced by immunizing mice with Ba/F3 cells transfected with CLEC12B and boosting with purified CLEC12B-Ig fusion protein as described previously (11Watzl C. Peterson M. Long E.O. Tissue Antigens. 2000; 56: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Antibodies were tested for their specificity for CLEC12B by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot and fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis. Reverse Transcription PCR, cDNA Constructs, and Retroviral Transduction—PCR analysis of CLEC12B cDNA was performed on Marathon-Ready cDNA libraries (Clontech) using the primer pair cac tca cat ttc agg att ctg ctg gag caa g and cac atc ctt tgg atc cat tga tct ggt caa g followed by a second round of PCR using the primer pair caa ctg ggc aac tcc aac aac ttg tcc atg and gaa cag agc cat ctt ccc aga acc aac ttc tg. Full-length CLEC12B cDNA was amplified using the primer pair atg tct gaa gaa gtg acc tac gcg aca ctc aca ttt c and cta atc caa atc ctc agt ctt cac tgg ggc agc. CLEC12B cDNA linked to a His tag sequence was cloned into the retroviral expression vector pBABE puro CMV+ containing a puromycin resistance gene. A tyrosine-to-phenylalanine mutation within the ITIM motif was generated using site-directed mutagenesis. Retroviral transduction was done using the packaging cell line Phoenix-ampho (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA). Transduced NKL and Ba/F3 were selected in puromycin, and NKL were subsequently subcloned to generate clones stably expressing CLEC12B. Expression was verified by flow cytometry. Ig Fusion Proteins—The extracellular part of CLEC12B was cloned in-frame with the Fc part of human IgG. Proteins were produced by transient transfection of 293T cells and subsequently purified via protein A-agarose. Differentiation of U937 Cells—U937 cells were plated in 6-well plates at 0.5 × 106 cells/well and stimulated with 10–8 m phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Cells were harvested at different time points. Adherend cells were scraped off the plates and stained for flow cytometry with an anti-CLEC12B antibody. Cytotoxicity Assay—P815 cells were grown to mid-log phase, and 5 × 105 cells were labeled in 100 μl of CTL medium (Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) with 100 μCi of (3.7 MBq) 51Cr for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with CTL medium and resuspended at 5 × 104 cells/ml in CTL medium. Effector cells were resuspended in CTL medium and preincubated with antibodies (0.5 μg/ml final concentration) for 15 min at 25 °C. After preincubation, effector cells were mixed with 5,000 labeled target cells/well in a V-bottom 96-well plate. Maximum release was determined by incubation of target cells in 1% Triton X-100 solution. For spontaneous release, targets were incubated without effectors in CTL medium alone. All samples were done in triplicates. After a 1-min centrifugation at 220 × g, plates were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Supernatant was harvested, and 51Cr release was measured in a γ-counter. Percent specific release was calculated as ([experimental release – spontaneous release]/[maximum release – spontaneous release]) × 100. The ratio between maximum and spontaneous release was at least 4 in all experiments. Transfection of 293T Cells—293T cells (0.5 × 106/well) were grown for 24 h in a 6-well plate and transfected by calcium phosphate with 3 μg/well of total DNA (12Eissmann P. Watzl C. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 3170-3177Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and treated either with pervanadate or phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were lysed in ice-cold Triton X-100 lysis buffer for 20 min on ice, and lysate was cleared by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 4 °C, 15 min). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—For immunoprecipitation, precleared lysates (13Eissmann P. Beauchamp L. Wooters J. Tilton J.C. Long E.O. Watzl C. Blood. 2005; 105: 4722-4729Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) were first incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 2 μg of control IgG1 followed by 2 μg of specific antibody, both coupled to recombinant protein G-agarose (Invitrogen). Beads were washed three times in ice-cold lysis buffer and boiled in 2.5× reducing (5% SDS, 25% glycerin, 12.5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.156 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.01% Bromphenol blue) or nonreducing (no 2-mercaptoethanol) sample buffer. For Western blotting, samples were separated on 10% NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany). The membrane was blocked in phosphate-buffered saline with 5% milk powder for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with the indicated antibody overnight at 4 °C. After washing, the membrane was incubated with the respective horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary reagent for 1 h at room temperature and developed using Super Signal West Pico (Pierce). FACS Staining—1 × 105 to 5 × 105 cells were resuspended in FACS buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 2% fetal calf serum) containing the appropriate antibody (10 μg/ml). After a 20-min incubation on ice, cells were washed in FACS buffer and stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated secondary antibody (1:200). Cells were subsequently washed and resuspended in FACS buffer containing 2% formaldehyde and analyzed using flow cytometry. Staining with Ig fusion proteins was conducted similarly. Cells were diluted in FACS buffer containing the respective Ig fusion protein (10 μg/ml). After incubating on ice, cells were washed and stained with biotinylated goat anti-human IgG antibody. Then cells were incubated with phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin and analyzed. In an attempt to identify NKG2D-related molecules, we identified a mouse cDNA clone (AK016908) coding for an unnamed C-type lectin protein product of 275 amino acids (BAB30491). Using this sequence as bait, we identified a related human sequence in the data base designated human macrophage antigen-H (AY358810). Comparing the sequences, we found that human macrophage antigen-H (232 amino acids) was missing exon 6, resulting in a premature stop codon and an incomplete C-type lectin domain. Searching the genomic DNA data base, we identified the missing exon 6, which showed homology to the murine sequence. Using primers spanning exons 1 to 6 we identified the complete cDNA coding for a 276-amino acid type II transmembrane protein (DQ368812) belonging to the C-type lectin family of receptors (14Sobanov Y. Bernreiter A. Derdak S. Mechtcheriakova D. Schweighofer B. Duchler M. Kalthoff F. Hofer E. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 3493-3503Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 15Robinson M.J. Sancho D. Slack E.C. Leibundgut-Landmann S. Sousa C.R. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 1258-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The extracellular domain of the putative protein showed highest homology to human NKG2D (36% similarity). However, unlike NKG2D it did not contain a charged amino acid in its transmembrane region but an ITIM sequence (VTYATL) in the cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 1A). The genetic locus of this receptor was mapped to human chromosome 12p13.2 and mouse chromosome 6qF3 in the vicinity of other C-type lectin-like receptors (Fig. 1B). Overall, the receptor showed a high similarity to CLEC12A (16Marshall A.S. Willment J.A. Lin H.H. Williams D.L. Gordon S. Brown G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14792-14802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 17Bakker A.B. van den Oudenrijn S. Bakker A.Q. Feller N. van Meijer M. Bia J.A.

Blood. 2004; 104: 2858-2866Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) (34% similarity), which was located on the same chromosomal locus. We therefore named this new receptor CLEC12B. Using reverse transcription PCR we found expression of CLEC12B in human cDNA libraries prepared from various tissues except brain (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, in mammary gland and ovary we only found a truncated splice variant lacking exon 4. As this exon encodes part of the C-type lectin-like domain, this alternative transcript would yield a non-functional protein. Because of its high similarity to the NKG2D extracellular domain we speculated that this receptor could be an inhibitory counterpart of NKG2D. Similar to NKG2D, surface expression of this receptor was independent of CD94 expression and the receptor formed disulfide-linked homodimers in transfected cells (data not shown). We produced an Ig fusion protein of the extracellular domain of human CLEC12B to test whether it might recognize the same ligands as NKG2D. Ba/F3 cells stably expressing the human NKG2D ligands MICA, MICB, ULBP1, ULBP2, or ULBP3 were stained at high levels with a NKG2D-Ig fusion protein. However, we detected no binding of the Ig fusion protein containing the extracellular domain of human CLEC12B (Fig. 2), demonstrating no apparent overlap in ligand specificity with NKG2D. To examine CLEC12B expression and biochemical properties, we produced mouse monoclonal antibodies against human CLEC12B. We selected three subclones that specifically recognized the receptor in transfected cells either in Western blot (clones 12 and 16, Fig. 3A and data not shown) or in flow cytometry (clones 30 and 16, Fig. 3B and data not shown). CLEC12B was detected as a double band in Western blot analysis of transfected cells, possibly due to differential glycosylation of the receptor. Using the antibody clone 30 in flow cytometry, we detected strong expression of CLEC12B on the human promyelocytic cell line U937 after PMA stimulation but not in nonstimulated cells (Fig. 4A). The induction of CLEC12B protein expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis using another anti-CLEC12B-specific mAb (clone 12) (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, the endogenous CLEC12B protein was detected as a single band as compared with the double band of the transfected protein. The reason for this difference is unknown so far. This indicates that CLEC12B can be expressed on monocytic cells after a cell differentiation-inducing stimulus. To further characterize this we purified CD14-positive monocytes from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Although we detected no surface expression on freshly isolated monocytes or any other leukocyte population (data not shown), we observed the surface expression of CLEC12B on in vitro differentiated human macrophages (Fig. 4C). This expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis using three independent anti-CLEC12B mAbs (Fig. 4D and data not shown).FIGURE 4Expression of CLEC12B. A, CLEC12B expression on U937 cells. U937 cells were stimulated with 10–8 m PMA for the indicated times, and cells were stained with an isotype control (filled gray histograms) or anti-CLEC12B mAb clone 30. Results are representative of three experiments. B, U937 cells stimulated as described in panel A were lysed and analyzed by Western blotting using the anti-CLEC12B mAb clone 12 (upper panel) followed by anti-actin blotting to control for equal loading (lower panel). C, in vitro differentiated macrophages were stained with an isotype control antibody (filled gray histogram) or an anti-CLEC12B mAb (bold line). D, freshly isolated CD14-positive monocytes (Mono) or in vitro differentiated macrophages (Mϕ) were analyzed by Western blotting for the expression of CLEC12B as described in panel B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To characterize receptor function, we generated a mutant of human CLEC12B by exchanging the ITIM tyrosine with phenylalanine. The His-tagged wild type and the mutant receptors were stably expressed in the NK cell line NKL (Fig. 5, A and B). Triggering the NKG2D receptor in NKL cells in a redirected lysis assay resulted in efficient NK cell cytotoxicity, which was inhibited by co-triggering the CLEC12B WT (Fig. 5C) but not the mutant receptor (Fig. 5D). This demonstrates that CLEC12B can effectively function as an inhibitory receptor and that this activity depends on the ITIM sequence. ITIM motifs usually couple to phosphatases to promote inhibitory signaling (19Long E.O. Barber D.F. Burshtyn D.N. Faure M. Peterson M. Rajagopalan S. Renard V. Sandusky M. Stebbins C.C. Wagtmann N. Watzl C. Immunol. Rev. 2001; 181: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We therefore transfected 293T cells with His-tagged WT or mutant human CLEC12B in combination with SHP-1 or SHP-2. Transfected cells were pervanadate-treated and CLEC12B was immunoprecipitated. Pervanadate treatment induced detectable tyrosine phosphorylation only in the WT receptor. Interestingly, the lower band of the transfected CLEC12B detected by Western blotting was preferentially phosphorylated (Fig. 6, A and B). Upon phosphorylation the WT, but not the mutant receptor, could recruit SHP-1 and SHP-2 as detected by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 6, A and B). This indicates that the inhibitory function of CLEC12B can be mediated by the recruitment of SHP-1 or SHP-2 to its ITIM upon receptor phosphorylation. The cDNA sequence for CLEC12B was found during a data base search for sequences with homology to NKG2D. Because of the high homology of CLEC12B's extracellular domain with NKG2D and its ITIM motif, this new lectin-like receptor appeared to be a potential inhibitory counterpart. Yet binding of CLEC12B Ig fusion proteins to NKG2D ligands could not be detected. Additionally we did not find any expression of CLEC12B on primary T cells, NK cells, or on NK cell lines. This makes it very improbable that CLEC12B is an inhibitory counterpart to NKG2D, at least with respect to expression and competitive binding to common NK cell ligands. Functional analysis of full-length CLEC12B revealed that this receptor is able to signal in an inhibiting fashion via recruitment of the phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2. Although CLEC12B triggering could inhibit NKG2D-mediated NK cell activation (Fig. 4), its inhibitory activity was not limited to NKG2D. Other activating NK cell receptors such as 2B4 (20Bhat R. Eissmann P. Endt J. Hoffmann S. Watzl C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2006; 79: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) were sensitive to the inhibitory effect of CLEC12B (data not shown), demonstrating that CLEC12B can inhibit a broad range of receptor-mediated activating signals. In preliminary experiments we also investigated the function of endogenous CLEC12B on PMA-stimulated U937 cells. Stimulating these cells with lipopolysaccharide induced the production of tumor necrosis factor α. However, engagement of CLEC12B by plate-bound anti-CLEC12B antibody did not significantly inhibit lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor α production (data not shown). Plate-bound antibodies only stimulate their respective receptor at the site of contact between the cell and the plastic dish. In contrast, lipopolysaccharide is a soluble mediator and can therefore exert its effect over the entire surface of the cell. It is therefore likely that the local inhibitory effect of CLEC12B engagement was not sufficient to counteract the more global lipopolysaccharide signal. This demonstrates that CLEC12B is only potent in blocking cellular activation when it is co-engaged with an activating receptor in a defined region of the plasma membrane of a cell. We found CLEC12B mRNA expression in almost all tissues tested. In mammary gland and ovary only a truncated variant of CLEC12B lacking exon 4 could be detected. As this exon encodes a part of the extracellular domain essential for formation of a functional C-type lectin-like domain, the resulting receptor will be nonfunctional. It will be interesting to investigate the regulation of this differential splicing of CLEC12B in different tissues. We found protein expression of CLEC12B on in vitro differentiated macrophages and on PMA-stimulated U937 cells. We did not detect CLEC12B expression on in vitro generated dendritic cells (generated from CD14+ cells with granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin 4 for 6 days) or on any freshly isolated peripheral blood leukocyte population (data not shown). The expression on macrophages could explain why we found CLEC12B expression in various tissues using reverse transcription PCR, as macrophages and related immune cells are spread throughout the body. CLEC12B may be involved in limiting the activity of monocyte-derived immune cells after cell differentiation and possibly during inflammatory diseases. It will therefore be interesting to investigate CLEC12B expression during various infectious or chronic diseases. Together with the identification of its ligand, this might give more insight into the biological function of this novel receptor.

However, the underlying mechanisms for this fragmentation process are so far unclear. Here we have investigated the role of the ADP-ribosylation factor-1 (ARF1) in this process to determine whether Golgi fragmentation in mitosis is mediated by vesicle budding. ARF1 is a small GTPase that is required for COPI vesicle formation from the Golgi membranes. Treatment of Golgi membranes with mitotic cytosol or with purified coatomer together with wild type ARF1 or its constitutive active form, but not the inactive mutant, converted the Golgi membranes into COPI vesicles. ARF1-depleted mitotic cytosol failed to fragment Golgi membranes. ARF1 is associated with Golgi vesicles generated in vitro and with vesicles in mitotic cells. In addition, microinjection of constitutive active ARF1 did not affect mitotic Golgi fragmentation or cell progression through mitosis. Our results show that ARF1 is active during mitosis and that this activity is required for mitotic Golgi fragmentation.

The Golgi apparatus is a membrane-bound organelle that serves as a central conduit for protein and lipid modification, processing, trafficking, and secretion in all eukaryotic cells. The central and unique feature of the Golgi is a stack of flattened cisternal membranes with dilated rims (1Ladinsky M.S. Mastronarde D.N. McIntosh J.R. Howell K.E. Staehelin L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1135-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The stack carries out post-translational processing of newly synthesized proteins as they pass through this organelle after assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 2The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ARF1, ADP-ribosylation factor-1; BFA, Brefeldin A; IC, interphase cytosol; MC, mitotic cytosol; plk, Polo-like kinase-1; PNS, postnuclear supernatant; WT, wild type; NRK, normal rat kidney; TGN, trans-Golgi network; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate.2The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ARF1, ADP-ribosylation factor-1; BFA, Brefeldin A; IC, interphase cytosol; MC, mitotic cytosol; plk, Polo-like kinase-1; PNS, postnuclear supernatant; WT, wild type; NRK, normal rat kidney; TGN, trans-Golgi network; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate.

Processing enzymes, which include those involved in modifying bound oligosaccharides, are arranged across the stack (in the cis to trans direction) in the order in which they function (3Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3772) Google Scholar). In animals, stacks are often interconnected to form a ribbon that is localized adjacent to the nucleus. Despite its complicated morphology and function, the Golgi apparatus is dynamic, capable of rapid disassembly and reassembly during mitosis (4Shorter J. Warren G. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 379-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) or upon drug treatment (5Misumi Y. Misumi Y. Miki K. Takatsuki A. Tamura G. Ikehara Y. J. Biol.

Cell. 1993; 73: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Mitotic fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus was first observed in the early 1900s. One particularly good example is the study by Ludford in 1924 (9Ludford R.J. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. 1924; 97: 50-60Google Scholar), in which the Golgi was described as forming “rodlets” that were scattered throughout the dividing cell and that, at a late stage in cell division, re-associated to form two separate Golgi complexes, one in each daughter cell. Studies using electron microscopy showed fragmentation of the characteristic stack-like organization of the Golgi at the onset of mitosis, and Golgi fragments were subsequently distributed to each daughter cell (10Maul G.G. Brinkley B.R. Cancer Res. 1970; 30: 2326-2335PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lucocq J.M. Berger E.G. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In the late 1990s, when green fluorescent proteins and live cell imaging techniques became available, it was shown that early in mitosis, during prophase, the Golgi undergoes extensive fragmentation along the cell cycle progression (12Shima D.T. Haldar K. Pepperkok R. Watson R. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1211-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 13Zaal K.J. Smith C.L. Polishchuk R.S. Altan N. Cole N.B. Ellenberg J.

Cell. 2006; 17: 990-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). During cytokinesis, the dispersed Golgi fragments are converted into larger Golgi fragments that finally re-form the pericentriolar ribbon structure. Several reasons have been presented to explain the biological significance of mitotic Golgi fragmentation. The first concerns the mechanism of Golgi partitioning between the two daughter cells during the cell cycle. The distribution of Golgi membranes over a larger space of the cell is expected to aid in the even distribution of this organelle into the daughter cells (4Shorter J. Warren G. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 379-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The second hypothesis concerns the release of “mitotic” components stored on the Golgi during interphase, which are important in the promotion of cytokinesis (16Colanzi A. Suetterlin C. Malhotra V. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 462-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 17Altan-Bonnet N. Phair R.D. Polishchuk R.S. Weigert R. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13314-13319Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For example, Nir2, a Golgi-associated protein in interphase cells, has been shown to move to the cleavage furrow and is essential for cytokinesis (18Litvak V. Argov R. Dahan N. Ramachandran S. Amarilio R. Shainskaya A. Lev S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 319-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to directly providing membranes for cleavage furrow invagination (19Gromley A. Yeaman C. Rosa J. Redick S. Chen C.T. Mirabelle S. Guha M. Sillibourne J. Doxsey S.J. Cell. 2005; 123: 75-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), it is likely that the Golgi mediates the coordinated release of proteins required for cytokinesis and other cytoplasmic events as the cell progresses through mitosis. The underlying mechanisms mediating Golgi disassembly during mitosis are so far unclear. One possibility is that disassembly is achieved through a similar mechanism as brefeldin A (BFA) treatment, a fungal metabolite known to redistribute the Golgi membranes, at least partially, into the ER. BFA exerts its effects by inactivating the ADP-ribosylation factor-1 (ARF1) recruitment to Golgi membranes. ARF1 is a small GTPase that is membrane-associated in its active GTP-bound form and recruits coatomer onto the membrane to form COPI vesicles. Inactivation of ARF1 in turn prevents recruitment of coatomer (and hence the formation of COPI vesicles) and leads to the redistribution of Golgi membranes to the ER (6Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1989; 56: 801-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). The central idea of this hypothesis is that mitosis phenocopies BFA treatment in terms of Golgi breakdown by inactivation of ARF1. Using live cell imaging, it has been shown that transiently overexpressed ARF1-GFP disappears from the Golgi region in the early stages of mitosis and that the expression of the constitutively active ARF1(Q71L) mutant blocks mitotic Golgi disassembly as well as cell progression through mitosis (15Altan-Bonnet N. Sougrat R. Liu W. Snapp E.L. Ward T. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 990-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 17Altan-Bonnet N. Phair R.D. Polishchuk R.S. Weigert R.

Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 364-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), suggesting that ARF1 needs to be inactivated in order to disassemble the Golgi. However, whether the endogenous ARF1 is inactivated during mitosis is so far unclear. Another explanation for the mitotic Golgi disassembly is the continuous budding of COPI vesicles. Isolated Golgi membranes, when treated with mitotic cytosol, undergo extensive fragmentation that mimics mitotic Golgi fragmentation seen in vivo. The fragmentation is mediated, in large part, by the continued budding of COPI vesicles (21Misteli T. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 269-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Budding requires ARF1, suggesting that ARF1 is active. Consistently, budding is also enhanced in the presence of GTPγS, which is known to activate ARF1. However, GTPγS also activates other GTPases (such as Rab proteins) and impairs cargo uptake in the early stage of COPI vesicle formation (22Nickel W. Malsam J. Gorgas K. Ravazzola M. Jenne N. Helms J.B. Wieland F.T. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3081-3090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). So far there is no direct evidence that ARF1 itself is involved in mitotic Golgi fragmentation. Here we have examined the role of ARF1 in mitotic Golgi fragmentation using a variety of techniques. Our results show that ARF1 is active during mitosis and that this activity is required for mitotic fragmentation of the Golgi. Reagents—All reagents were from Sigma, Roche Diagnostics, or Calbiochem, unless otherwise stated. The following antibodies were used: monoclonal antibodies against ARF1 (1D9, Abcam), GM130, and Gos28 (Transduction Laboratories), GRASP65 (F. Barr), β-COP (M3A5, T. Kreis), α-tubulin (K. Gull); polyclonal antibodies against ARF (D. Shields and D. Sheff), β-COP (EAGE, T. Kreis), GM130 (MLO7, M. Lowe), GRASP65 (23Wang Y. Seemann J. Pypaert M. Shorter J. Warren G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3279-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), α-mannosidase II (K. Moremen), Golgin-84 (A. Satoh), rat serum albumin (G. Warren), and TGN38 (24Taguchi T. Pypaert M. Warren G. Traffic. 2003; 4: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Secondary antibodies for immunofluorescence and for Western blotting were from Molecular Probes and Jackson ImmunoResearch, respectively. BFA was obtained from Invitrogen and Epicenter Biotechnologies and applied to the tissue culture medium at 5 μg/ml final concentration. Nocodazole (Sigma) was prepared as 0.2 mg/ml stock in Me2SO and used at 0.5 μg/ml in the medium. Hoechst 33342 was purchased from Invitrogen. ARF1 Mutagenesis, Expression, and Purification—cDNA constructs for wild type (WT) and the constitutively active mutant (Q71L) ARF1 were obtained from J. Rothman (25Serafini T. Orci L. Amherdt M. Brunner M. Kahn R.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1991; 67: 239-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 26Dascher C. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ARF1-inactive mutant (T31N) (26Dascher C. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was made by site-directed mutagenesis and confirmed by DNA sequencing. For preparation of myristoylated ARF1 proteins, BL21(DE3) Gold bacterial cells were co-transformed with a second plasmid encoding the yeast N-myristoyltransferase (27Kuai J. Boman A.L. Arnold R.S. Zhu X. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4022-4032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, ARF1 expression was induced in the presence of 50 μm myristic acid. Myristoylated ARF1 proteins were enriched by 35% saturation of ammonium sulfate followed by purification on a DEAE-Sepharose column as described previously (28Randazzo P.A. Weiss O. Kahn R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Fractions containing myristoylated ARF1 eluted between 50 and 150 mm NaCl were pooled, buffer exchanged, and concentrated on an AmiconUltra-10 filter device (Millipore) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μm GDP, to a concentration of 2–5 mg/ml, and aliquots were stored at -80 °C. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that ARF1 is purified to over 90% homogeneity (supplemental Fig. 1A). Western blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody against ARF1 confirmed this result. This antibody, however, has lower affinity to ARF1(Q71L) compared with wild type or the T31N mutant (supplemental Fig. 1B). In Vitro Budding Assay and Analysis—Golgi membranes were purified from rat liver (29Wang Y. Taguchi T. Warren G. Celis J. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 3rd Ed. Vol 1.2. Elsevier Science, Burlington, MA2006: 33-39Google Scholar). Interphase (IC) and mitotic (MC) cytosols were prepared from HeLa S3 cells (21Misteli T. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 269-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Cdc2 kinase (cdc2/cyclin B1) and plk kinase were expressed and purified as described, and kinase activity was measured (23Wang Y. Seemann J. Pypaert M. Shorter J. Warren G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3279-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Coatomer complex was purified from rabbit cytosol (30Pavel J. Harter C. Wieland F.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2140-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Golgi budding assay was performed as described previously (22Nickel W. Malsam J. Gorgas K. Ravazzola M. Jenne N. Helms J.B. Wieland F.T. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3081-3090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Malsam J. Satoh A. Pelletier L. Warren G. Science. 2005; 307: 1095-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Briefly, Golgi membranes (200 μg) were mixed with 10 mg of IC or MC or with purified coatomer (100 μg), recombinant myristoylated ARF1 (50 μg), 1 mm GTP, and an ATP-regenerating system (10 mm creatine phosphate, 1 mm ATP, 20 μg/ml creatine kinase, 20 ng/ml cytochalasin B), in assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2 m sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 15 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 1 mm GTP, 1 mm glutathione, and protease inhibitors), in a final volume of 1000 μl. After incubation for 20 min at 37 °C, 250 mm KCl in cold assay buffer was added to stop the reaction and to release the vesicles. In some experiments 50 μg/ml BFA (Invitrogen) was included. To separate the membranes from the soluble proteins, samples were centrifuged in a TLA55 rotor at 55,000 rpm for 60 min. To analyze the membranes by equilibrium gradients, reactions were directly loaded onto a step gradient comprised of 1.0 ml 0.5 m, 1.5 ml 0.8 m, 2 ml 1.2 m, 2 ml 1.4 m, and 2 ml 1.6 m sucrose in assay buffer containing 250 mm KCl. Membranes were centrifuged to equilibrium at 200,000 × g, 4 °C for 3 h in a near vertical rotor (NVT65, Beckman Instruments, 50,000 rpm). COPI-coated vesicles typically peaked at 1.2–1.3 m sucrose, whereas uncoated Golgi remnants peaked at about 0.8 m sucrose. Fractions were diluted 3-fold with a buffer without sucrose, and membranes in each fraction were pelleted by centrifugation in a Beckman TLA55 rotor at 55,000 rpm for 60 min followed by Western blotting analysis. Membrane samples were also fixed and processed for EM. Vesicles were defined as round profiles of ∼70 nm in diameter. The percentage of membranes in cisternae was determined by the intersection method (23Wang Y. Seemann J. Pypaert M. Shorter J. Warren G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3279-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The statistical significance of the quantitated results was accessed by Student's t test. ARF1 was depleted from mitotic cytosol on a DEAE-Sepharose column used for ARF1 purification following the method described previously (32Happe S. Weidman P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 511-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, mitotic cytosol was loaded onto the column, and three fractions were collected as follows: ARF-depleted pool 1 that did not bind to the column; ARF-enriched pool 2 that bound to the column but was eluted with a buffer containing 65 mm KCl; and ARF-depleted pool 3 that contained proteins eluted with a buffer containing 500 mm KCl. Pools 1 and 3 were mixed and concentrated by on a Centricon filter device to the original concentration as ARF1-depleted mitotic cytosol. Cell Culture, Synchronization, and Subcellular Fractionation—NRK cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 7.5% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). To enrich NRK cells in M phase, subconfluent cells (∼75% confluent) were washed by phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in growth medium supplemented with 0.5 μg/ml nocodazole for 15 h (Sigma). Mitotic cells were collected by shake-off (33Knehr M. Poppe M. Enulescu M. Eickelbaum W. Stoehr M. Schroeter D. Paweletz N. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 546-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 34Jesch S.A. Linstedt A.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 623-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Typically, the mitotic index was about 80% when examined under a fluorescent microscope according to the condensation of the chromosomes stained with Hoechst 33258. To avoid unspecific pharmacological effects of nocodazole on mitotic cells, NRK cells were treated for 14 h with 2.5 μg/ml aphidicolin (Calbiochem) to enrich cells in G1/S phase. Six to nine hours after removal of the drug, mitotic cells were collected by shake-off. Confluent interphase (nonsynchronized) cultures were cleaned by the shake-off method to remove mitotic cells, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and harvested using a cell scraper. Normally 8 × 15-cm dishes of NRK cells were used for mitotic cell collection and two dishes for interphase collection. The mitotic index of interphase cells was lower than 1%. For BFA treatment, mitotic cells were treated with 5 μg/ml BFA in growth medium at 37 °C for 10 min before the collection of the cells. Spinner HeLa cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 7.5% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cells grown in suspension were synchronized by incubation in growth medium with 0.5 μg/ml nocodazole for 20–22 h until the mitotic index reached 95% or higher. Synchronized and nonsynchronized HeLa cells were collected by centrifugation. 200 ml of HeLa cells in suspension culture were used for mitotic or interphase cell collection. NRK or spinner HeLa cells were washed with homogenization buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, and protease inhibitors) and resuspended in 800 μl of homogenization buffer by pipetting (4 times blue tip, 6 times syringe). Cells were cracked with a ball bearing homogenizer as monitored under a microscope by trypan blue exclusion to a breakage of 75–80%. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 × g, 4 °C. The postnuclear supernatant (PNS) was removed and subjected to ultracentrifugation in a TLA55 rotor at 120,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant (cytosol) was removed, and the membranes in the pellet were resuspended in homogenization buffer. Equal volume fractions of the PNS, cytosol, and membrane fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Protein bands were quantitated using the NIH ImageJ software. The PNS was also fractionated on a sucrose gradient as described above, and fractions were analyzed by Western blotting. Microinjection and Immunofluorescence Analysis—Capillary microinjection was performed with a semiautomatic system consisting of a Transjector 5246 and a Micromanipulator 5171 (Eppendorf). NRK cells grown on glass coverslips were treated for 14 h with 2.5 μg/ml aphidicolin (Calbiochem) to enrich cells in G1/S phase. Eight hours after removal of the drug, the cells were injected with 1.2 mg/ml ARF1(Q71L) together with 2 mg/ml mouse IgG (Sigma) as an injection marker. The cells were incubated for 60–90 min at 37 °C and fixed and permeabilized for 10 min in methanol at -20 °C. For brefeldin A treatments, the injected cells were incubated in growth medium for 30 min followed by a 5-min incubation in the presence of 5 μg/ml brefeldin A. The cells were then labeled with polyclonal antibodies against GM130 or β-COP followed by goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes). The co-injected mouse IgGs were stained with goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 594 antibodies (Molecular Probes). DNA was stained with Hoechst 33342, and the cells were mounted in Moviol 4-88 (Calbiochem). Fluorescence analysis was performed using a Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.4 DIC objective (Zeiss) and an Axiovert 200 M microscope (Zeiss). Images were captured with an Orca-285 camera (Hamamatsu) and the software package Openlab 4.02 (Improvision). Golgi Fragmentation Requires ARF1 Activity—To test whether mitotic Golgi fragmentation requires ARF1 activity, we used a well characterized system for COPI-vesicle formation in vitro. The incubation of highly enriched rat liver Golgi membranes with coatomer and myristoylated ARF1 leads to budding of COPI vesicles (22Nickel W. Malsam J. Gorgas K. Ravazzola M. Jenne N. Helms J.B.

Three forms of myristoylated ARF1, the wild type (WT), the constitutively active ARF1(Q71L), or the inactivated mutant ARF1(T31N) (26Dascher C. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were expressed in bacteria and purified following the established methods (28Randazzo P.A. Weiss O. Kahn R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We first examined whether treatment of Golgi membranes with these purified ARF1 proteins, in the presence of purified coatomer, could lead to Golgi fragmentation. As shown in Fig. 1, treatment of Golgi membranes with purified WT ARF1 and coatomer led to extensive fragmentation of Golgi membranes (Fig. 1A). Quantitation of the results showed that about 43% of membranes were vesiculated in the presence of WT ARF1, a significant increase compared with treatment with coatomer alone (Fig. 1I). A similar result was obtained with the constitutively active form ARF1(Q71L) (Fig. 1B), a mutant restricted to the GTP-bound form, with 41% of membranes in vesicles (Fig. 1B). In contrast, no fragmentation was observed when the Golgi membranes were treated with the inactive form ARF1(T31N) (Fig. 1C), a mutant that has a preferential affinity for GDP compared with the wild type protein (26Dascher C. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Only about 13% of membrane in vesicles was observed, similar to untreated membranes (12%) (Fig. 1I). Detailed examination of EM images at higher magnification indicated that most of the vesicles were coated in the presence of WT ARF1 or ARF1(Q71L) (data not shown). Incubation of purified Golgi membranes with purified coatomer did not significantly fragment the membranes (Fig. 1E), with about 12% of membrane in vesicles (Fig. 1I), suggesting that ARF1 activity is required for the vesiculation. This effect is because of the ARF1 protein added, because analysis of purified Golgi membranes by Western blotting showed that essentially no endogenous ARF1 proteins were associated with the membrane under the experimental conditions (data not shown). To mimic mitotic conditions, we added purified mitotic kinases cdc2 (in complex with cyclin B1) and polo-like kinase (plk). These kinases mimic mitotic cytosol to phosphorylate most of the Golgi proteins known to be mitotically phosphorylated, such as GRASP65 and GM130 (23Wang Y. Seemann J. Pypaert M. Shorter J. Warren G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3279-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 36Lin C.Y. Madsen M.L. Yarm F.R. Jang Y.J. Liu X. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the presence of mitotic kinases, fragmentation of the Golgi by WT (Fig. 1F) and active ARF1(Q71L) (Fig. 1G) was significantly enhanced. The number of vesicles increased about 2-fold compared with ARF1 and coatomer, resulting in 80% of the total membranes fragmented into COPI vesicles (Fig. 1I). In contrast, the inactive ARF1(T31N) did not fragment Golgi membranes even in the presence of mitotic kinases (Fig. 1I), suggesting that ARF1 is not inactivated under mitotic conditions, at least not in this cell-free assay. Active ARF1 Associates with Fragmented Golgi Membranes—It has been shown that the active GTP-bound form of ARF1 associates with membranes, recruits coatomer, and promotes vesicle budding. Upon GTP hydrolysis, ARF1 is inactivated and disassociates from the membrane (26Dascher C. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38D'Souza-Schorey C. Chavrier P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). To test whether ARF1 is associated with the membranes after mitotic fragmentation of the Golgi membranes, we pelleted the membranes, including the Golgi remnants and vesicles, by high speed centrifugation followed by analysis of ARF1 by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 2A, total membranes were pelleted efficiently, as indicated by GRASP65 and Gos28, two Golgi-associated membrane proteins. Significant amounts of WT ARF1 and ARF1(Q71L) were found in the membrane pellets that contained COPI vesicles indicated by the β-COP subunit, whereas no signal was detected in the pellet with the inactive ARF1(T31N). Because recruitment of ARF1-GTP to the membrane is essential for COPI vesicle budding, this strongly suggests that ARF1 is active under mitotic conditions; without ARF1 activity, no vesicles were generated. Coatomer was also recruited onto the membrane by WT ARF1 or ARF1(Q71L), but not the inactive ARF1(T31N) (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 6 versus 9), which is consistent with the ARF1 results. As β-COP was largely found in the pellet fraction with active ARF1 (Fig. 2), it indicates that most of the vesicles are coated, which further suggests that ARF1 is maintained in the GTP-bound form. The pattern of ARF1 association with membranes was not changed in the presence of mitotic kinases cdc2 and plk (Fig. 2B), with ARF1(WT) and ARF1(Q71L) largely associated with membranes, and with no ARF1(T31N) in the membrane fraction. This result shows that ARF1 remains active in the presence of these mitotic kinases. The membrane binding property of ARF1 was then tested in the presence of BFA, a chemical compound that is known to inactivate ARF1 (39Donaldson J.G. Finazzi D. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1992; 360: 350-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). BFA abolished the membrane binding property of wild type ARF1 but not the Q71L mutant (Fig. 2C, lane 6). This result confirms that only active ARF1 is associated with Golgi membranes under the experimental conditions. To determine whether the ARF1-associated Golgi fragments are COPI vesicles, we separated the Golgi membranes treated with ARF1, coatomer, and mitotic kinases on a 0.5–1.6 m sucrose gradient.

IEs that adhere to CSA express var2csa-type genes, which encode specific variants of the IE surface antigen P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1). We report direct binding of native PfEMP1, isolated from IEs and encoded by var2csa, to immobilized CSA. Binding of PfEMP1 was dependent on 4-O-sulfated disaccharides and glucuronic acid rather than iduronic acid, consistent with the specificity of intact IEs. Using immobilized CS oligosaccharides as neoglycolipid probes, the minimum chain length for direct binding of PfEMP1 was eight monosaccharide units. Similarly for IE adhesion to placental tissue there was a requirement for 4-O-sulfated GalNAc and glucuronic acid mixed with non-sulfated disaccharides; 6-O-sulfation interfered with the interaction between placental CSA and IEs. The minimum chain length for maximal inhibition of adhesion was 10 monosaccharide residues. Partially 4-O-sulfated CS oligosaccharides (45–55% sulfation) were highly effective inhibitors of placental adhesion (IC50, 0.15 μg/ml) and may have potential for therapeutic development. We used defined P. falciparum isolates expressing different variants of var2csa in adhesion assays and found that there were isolate-specific differences in the preferred structural motifs for adhesion to CSA that correlated with polymorphisms in PfEMP1 encoded by var2csa-type genes. This may influence sites of IE sequestration or parasite virulence.

Sequestration of IEs is thought to contribute to the survival of parasites by aiding replication and evasion of splenic clearance and can lead to severe consequences when large numbers of IEs accumulate in vital organs.

P. falciparum isolates from the placenta typically adhere to CSA, and IEs can adhere to ex vivo placental tissue in a CSA-dependent manner in vitro (10Fried M. Duffy P.E.

Mol. Med. 1997; 3: 508-518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IEs can also bind via CSA side chains to the proteoglycan thrombomodulin (15Rogerson S.J. Novakovic S. Cooke B.M. Brown G.V. Exp.

However, binding of full-length or native PfEMP1 to CSA or inhibition of IE adhesion by antibodies to var2csa domains has not been demonstrated to confirm a direct role of var2csa in adhesion.

These polymorphisms can substantially influence the binding and adhesion-inhibitory activity of acquired antibodies suggesting that they have evolved to facilitate immune evasion (34Beeson J.G.

CS comprises repeating disaccharide units of hexuronic acid (HexUA) β1–3 linked to GalNAc, i.e. -(4HexUAβ1–3GalNAc1)n-. Typically GalNAc is mono-O-sulfated at either the 4- or the 6-O position and this differentiates the principal CSA and CSC disaccharide units, respectively. CSB (or dermatan sulfate) is similar in sulfation to CSA but has iduronic acid (IdoUA) rather than glucuronic acid (GlcUA) as the predominant uronic acid. Other variations in sulfation pattern also frequently occur. CS chains show heterogeneity in sulfation patterns and uronic acid compositions, and these features determine their biological properties. Several studies have demonstrated the importance of 4-O-sulfation for IE binding to CS (6Rogerson S.J. Chaiyaroj S.C. Ng K. Reeder J.C. Brown G.V. J. Exp.

Cell-associated placental CSPGs present in detergent extracts have a higher level of sulfation with ∼30% 4-O- and 13–15% 6-O-sulfation (17Achur R.N. Valiyaveettil M. Alkhalil A. Ockenhouse C.F.

Thrombomodulin, which is widely expressed in the vasculature, is typically composed of ∼87% 4-O-sulfated disaccharides balanced with non-sulfated disaccharides (39Muthusamy A. Achur R.N. Valiyaveettil M. Gowda D.C. Exp. Parasitol. 2004; 107: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and CSPGs from Saimiri brain endothelial cells were composed predominantly of 4-O-sulfated disaccharides with ∼37% nonsulfated disaccharides (18Fusai T.

GAGs play essential roles in a range of biological functions and have been increasingly recognized as important molecules for attachment, adhesion, and invasion of infectious pathogens (44Rostand K. Esko J. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interactions between CS and other microbes, such as human immunodeficiency virus (45Bobardt M.D. Salmon P. Wang L. Esko J.D. Gabuzda D. Fiala M. Trono D. Van der Schueren B. David G. Gallay P.A. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 6567-6584Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), have been reported, and P. falciparum also interacts with heparan sulfate during invasion of hepatocytes (46Frevert U. Sinnis P. Cerami C. Shreffler W. Takacs B. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Despite its widespread distribution and expression on many cell surfaces there is relatively little known about the structure-function relationship of CS. Furthermore it is not known how polymorphisms, which are common among antigens of microbial pathogens, influence the specificity and function of interactions with GAGs, which may influence the clinical manifestations of infection. In this study, we aimed to further define the molecular basis of the interactions among IEs, CSA, and placental tissue and to identify key features common to different CSA-binding variants. To date, the structural requirements of CS for interactions with P. falciparum have been defined only by inhibition of IE adhesion rather than through direct PfEMP1 binding studies and have predominantly used purified immobilized CSA preparations for adhesion. Here we examined direct binding of native PfEMP1 to oligosaccharides and polysaccharides, as neoglycolipid (NGL) (47Chai W. Stoll M.S. Galustian C. Lawson A.M. Feizi T. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 362: 160-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and biotin probes, respectively; adhesion of IEs from different P. falciparum isolates to polysaccharides with different degrees of sulfation; and inhibition of IE adhesion to CSA and placental tissue using various types of defined oligo- and polysaccharides. Additionally we hypothesized that the requirement for P. falciparum to interact with diverse CS structures in the vasculature will have favored the evolution of CS-binding PfEMP1 variants with differing fine specificities for CS structural motifs. More broadly, we used PfEMP1 as a model to investigate strain-specific differences in microbial interactions with GAGs and whether polymorphisms in GAG-binding proteins may alter the fine specificity of interactions with structural motifs. Preparation of Desulfated and Biotinylated CS Polysaccharides—CSA (from bovine trachea), CSB (from porcine intestinal mucosa), and CSC (from shark cartilage) were obtained from Sigma. Chondroitinase ABC (EC 4.2.2.20, from Proteus vulgaris; Sigma) digestion and strong anion-exchange HPLC disaccharide composition analysis (38Chai W. Beeson J.G. Lawson A.M. J. Biol.

They all contained three disaccharide units: ΔUA-GalNAc (0S), ΔUA-GalNAc4S (4S), and ΔUA-GalNAc6S (6S). CSA contained 4.9% 0S, 55.3% 4S, and 39.8% 6S; CSB contained 0.5% 0S, 85.6% 4S, and 4.8% 6S; and CSC contained 0.8% 0S, 15.5% 4S, and 76.7% 6S (38Chai W. Beeson J.G. Lawson A.M. J. Biol.

Selective de-6-O-sulfation of CS poly- and oligosaccharides and partial de-4-O-sulfation of CSB were performed as described previously (38Chai W. Beeson J.G. Lawson A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22438-22446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). De-6-O-sulfation involved conversion of poly- and oligosaccharides to pyridinium salts and desulfation in a mixture of anhydrous pyridine and N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide. CSB polysaccharide was converted to pyridinium salt, dissolved with 90% Me2SO in H2O, and heated to 80 °C. The reaction was stopped at 70- and 100-min intervals by cooling and neutralization with NaOH. The desulfation products were confirmed by strong anion-exchange HPLC disaccharide composition analysis as described previously (38Chai W. Beeson J.G. Lawson A.M. J. Biol.

Results indicated that all 6-O-sulfate groups were selectively removed from CSA and CSC poly- and oligosaccharides, and 30 and 46% of sulfates were removed from the two partially de-4-O-sulfated (de4S) CSB preparations, CSB-de4S-1 and CSB-de4S-2, respectively (Table 1).TABLE 1Disaccharide compositions and inhibitory activities of CS polysaccharides and oligosaccharidesCompositiona2S, ΔUA(2S)1-3GalNAc; 2,6DiS, ΔUA(2S)1-3GalNAc(6S); 4,6DiS, ΔUA1-3GalNAc(4,6S); 2,4DiS, ΔUA(2S)1-3GalNAc(4S).

In brief, 50 mg of CSA or CSC polysaccharide were dissolved in 10 ml of 0.1 m MES buffer (pH 5.5) before addition of 109 μl of 25 mm biotin-LC-hydrazide (Pierce, Perbio Science, Tattenhall, UK) solution in Me2SO and 130 μl of 25 mg/ml 1-ethyl-2-(2-dimethylamino-propyl)carbodiimide solution in 0.1 m MES buffer. The reaction mixtures were stirred at room temperature for 24 h and then dialyzed extensively against deionized water. A short Sephadex G-10 column (1.6 × 30 cm) was used to remove remaining biotin and other reagents.

The 12-mer and 14-mer fractions isolated from partially digested CSA-de6S were each further fractionated by strong anion-exchange HPLC into six subfractions. All six 12-mer subfractions (containing zero to six 4-O-sulfates, designated as subfractions CSA-12-0S to -6S, respectively) and two 14-mer subfractions containing five and seven sulfates (designated as CSA-14D and CSA-14F, respectively) were used in inhibition assays after quantitation by carbazole assay.

A post-translational modification identified here, truncation at the N terminus, was found to act along with previously described ERK- and GSK3-induced phosphorylation events to regulate the turnover of the MCL1 protein and thus its availability for antiapoptotic effects. Although both N-terminally truncated and full-length MCL1 contain sequences enriched in proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine and were susceptible to proteasomal degradation, the truncated form decayed less rapidly and was maintained for an extended period in the presence of ERK activation. This was associated with extended cell survival because the truncated form of MCL1 (unlike those of BCL2 and BCLX) retained antiapoptotic activity. N-terminal truncation slightly increased the electrophoretic mobility of MCL1 and differed from the phosphorylation/band shift to decreased mobility, which occurs in the G2/M phase and was not found to affect MCL1 turnover. The N-terminally truncated form of MCL1 was expressed to varying extents in normal lymphoid tissues and was the predominant form present in lymphomas from transgenic mice and human tumor lines of B-lymphoid origin. The degradation versus stabilized expression of antiapoptotic MCL1 is thus controlled by N-terminal truncation as well as by ERK- and GSK3 (but not G2/M)-induced phosphorylation. These modifications may contribute to dysregulated MCL1 expression in cancer and represent targets for promoting its degradation to enhance tumor cell death.

MCL1 has since been found to be induced in cells at various stages in differentiation, in response to specific growth, differentiation, and survival factors. Induction of MCL1 expression serves to promote viability in cells undergoing changes in proliferation or differentiation or responding to stress, infection, or other signals. Thus, when MCL1 is conditionally knocked out, hematopoietic stem cells do not survive, and early stage B- or T-lymphocytes die instead of continuing their differentiation (2Opferman J.T. Iwasaki H.

Overall, in response to changing signals, increases and decreases in MCL1 expression regulate cell viability, maintaining cells and lineages that are needed while eliminating those that are no longer needed or are damaged or overabundant (1Craig R.W.

For example, whereas differentiating plasma cells express MCL1 at distinct stages and in response to survival signals, multiple myeloma cells frequently exhibit constitutive, growth factor-independent expression (8Zhang B.

The level of expression in these cells is in the range of, or greater than, that seen transiently upon TPA stimulation of ML-1 cells.

The rapid transcriptional up-regulation seen in TPA-treated ML-1 cells is induced through an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-mediated early response gene mechanism, whereas other signaling pathways operate in other cell types (AKT, STAT (27Townsend K.J.

Down-regulation can occur rapidly because the t½ of the mRNA as well as the protein is generally in the range of several hours (29Yang T. Kozopas K.M. Craig R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 30Yang T. Kozopas K.M. Craig R.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 523-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The MCL1 mRNA is also subject to alternative splicing to much smaller BH3-only variants (∼34–35-kDa), which are prorather than antiapoptotic (4Marriot H.M. Bingle C.D. Read R.C. Braley K.E.

The multiple mechanisms that regulate MCL1 allow it to carry out its function as a rapid response viability mediator and aid its role in the maintenance of homeostatic tissue differentiation. These mechanisms also keep in check its potential for contributing to tumorigenesis.The post-translational mechanisms that regulate MCL1 are beginning to be elucidated. Although the carboxyl half of the protein (residues 177–350) contains the BCL2 homology (BH) domains, the upstream half is replete with PEST and poor PEST sequences; these may contribute to the ability of the protein to undergo rapid turnover (32Aartsma-Rus A. Janson A.A.M. Kaman W.E. Bremmer-Bout M. van Ommen G.J. den Dunnen J.T. van Deutekom J.C.T. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2004; 74: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Turnover has recently been found to be modulated by phosphorylation at a motif at the end of the PEST region (e.g. at Thr163 and Ser159). Phosphorylations at this motif determine whether the MCL1 protein undergoes rapid degradation to terminate its actions or, alternatively, is stabilized to promote/prolong its expression and antiapoptotic effects. An early clue that the antiapoptotic actions of MCL1 can be regulated by modulation of its turnover came from studies of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; this growth factor was found to promote MCL1 stabilization and neutrophil survival, acting through ERK and AKT (25Derouet M. Thomas L. Cross A. Moots R.J. Edwards S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26915-26921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). ERK activation (e.g. induced by TPA) results in phosphorylation at Thr163 and stabilization of the MCL1 protein (33Domina A.M. Vrana J.A. Gregory M.A. Hann S.R. Craig R.W. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 5301-5315Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Conversely, GSK3 activation (e.g. induced upon IL-3 deprivation and ensuing AKT inhibition) stimulates phosphorylation upstream at Ser159; this targets MCL1 for proteasomal degradation and enhances cell death (26Maurer U. Charvet C. Wagman A.S. Dejardin E. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 749-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). When the latter phosphorylation is blocked, MCL1 turnover is slowed (∼2-fold (34Ding Q. He X. Hsu J.M. Xia W. Chen C.T. Li L.Y. Lee D.F. Liu J.C. Zhong Q. Wang X. Hung M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 4006-4017Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar)), and cell viability is enhanced. Loss of GSK3-induced degradation has been shown recently to contribute to tumorigenesis in rodent systems and also appears to be important in human cancer (34Ding Q. He X. Hsu J.M. Xia W. Chen C.T.

Control of the effects of MCL1 through modulation of its degradation is reminiscent of certain cell cycle and DNA damage-response proteins, an example being cyclin E where phosphorylation-stimulated turnover is part of the normal cycle and is altered in tumors (36Ma Y. Fiering S. Black C. Liu X. Yuan Z. Memoli V.A. Robbins D.J. Bentley H.A. Tsongalis G.J. Demidenko E. Freemantle S.J. Dmitrovsky E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition to proteasomal degradation, MCL1 is subject to caspase cleavage to pro-apoptotic forms (at Asp127 or Asp157, yielding ∼28- and 23-kDa bands, respectively (38Michels J. O'Neill J.W. Dallman C.L. Mouzakiti A. Habens F. Brimmell M. Zhang K.Y.J. Craig R.W. Marcusson E.G. Johnson P.W.M. Packham G. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4818-4827Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar)).In previous studies, MCL1 was seen to undergo other post-translational modifications in addition to those above. On large format gels, MCL1 was found to consist of a closely spaced doublet (29Yang T. Kozopas K.M. Craig R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 39Vrana J.A. Bieszczad C.K. Cleaveland E.S. Yan M. Park J.P. Mohandas T.K. Craig R.W. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 892-900PubMed Google Scholar); this did not represent phosphorylation, because the doublet was not affected by treatment with phosphatase (33Domina A.M. Vrana J.A. Gregory M.A. Hann S.R. Craig R.W. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 5301-5315Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 40Domina A.M. Smith J.H. Craig R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21688-21694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition, MCL1 was subject to phosphorylation through another pathway induced in G2/M phase, which resulted in a band shift of the MCL1 protein to slightly reduced electrophoretic mobility (31Bingle C.D. Craig R.W. Hanks B.M. Eaton V. Zhou P. Whyte M.K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22136-22146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 38Michels J. O'Neill J.W. Dallman C.L.

Craig R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21688-21694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).In the present studies, MCL1 was found to be synthesized as a 42-kDa protein and to undergo a transition to a 40-kDa form, resulting in the formation of the doublet. As shown by mutational and mass spectrometry analysis, this is because of truncation at the N terminus, which occurs in a mildly hydrophobic segment (residues 9–27) that terminates in a stretch of small residues (e.g. Gly, Ala). The truncated form of MCL1 was found to turn over less rapidly than the full-length form and to be maintained for an extended period in the presence of ERK activation. This was associated with an extension of cell survival because the truncated form of MCL1 (unlike those of BCL2 and BCLX (41Kirsch D.G. Doseff A. Chau B.N. Lim D.S. de Souza-Pinto N.C. Hansford R. Kastan M.B. Lazebnik Y.A. Hardwick J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21155-21156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar)) retained antiapoptotic activity. In contrast to the N-terminal truncation, the phosphorylation/band shift, which involved Ser64 and Ser121, did not affect MCL1 turnover, confirming other studies (42Inoshita S. Takeda K. Hatai T. Terada Y. Sano M. Hata J. Umezawa A. Ichijo H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43730-43734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 43Kobayashi S. Lee S.H. Meng X.W. Mott J.L.

N-terminally truncated MCL1 was differentially expressed in normal lymphoid tissues and was the predominant form present in B-lymphoid tumor cells. Overall, rapid degradation versus extended expression of antiapoptotic MCL1 is controlled by N-terminal truncation as well as by ERK- and GSK3 (but not G2/M)-induced phosphorylation. The identification of modifications that affect MCL1 turnover suggests approaches that could be exploited to enhance the degradation of this pro-survival protein and sensitize cancer cells to apoptosis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Transfection—Cell lines were maintained as described, as were primary cells from MCL1 transgenic mice and age- and sex-matched nontransgenic controls (using an approved IACUC protocol) (9Vrana J.A.

Transfection was by electroporation for FDC-P1 cells and with Effectene (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) for CHO and COS-1 cells.Cell viability was assessed by hemocytometer using trypan blue dye exclusion (44Zhou P. Qian L. Kozopas K.M. Craig R.W. Blood. 1997; 89: 630-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or by scoring apoptotic morphology (9Vrana J.A. Cleaveland E.S. Eastman A. Craig R.W. Apoptosis. 2006; 11: 1275-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In some cases, the percentage of adherent cells was assessed by counting (Coulter Counter; Opa Locka, FL) nonadherent cells and adherent cells obtained by trypsinization.Pharmacologic Agents and Antibodies—Carbobenzoxy-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-leucinal (MG132), clasto-lactacystin β-lactone (lactacystin), calpain inhibitors I and II, and calpeptin were from Calbiochem. N-Benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp (O-methyl)fluoromethyl ketone (Z-VAD-fmk) was from Bio-Rad or Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). TPA was from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego) or Sigma, and etoposide was from Sigma.The antibodies used included a rabbit polyclonal (29Yang T. Kozopas K.M. Craig R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) and mouse monoclonal antibody (24Zhou P. Xie H. Qian L. Lee C.Y. Gascoyne R.D. Levy N.B. Craig R.W.

These antibodies detect human but not mouse MCL1 under standard conditions. Immunization of New Zealand White rabbits with a peptide representing the MCL1 N-terminal 12 (MAP peptide) or 16 residues (keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated) was carried out by, respectively, Hazelton Research Products, Inc. (Denver, PA; 2 rabbits), and Sigma Genosys (The Woodlands, TX; 2 rabbits).In Vitro Transcription/Translation, Western Blotting, and Assay of [35S]Met and 32P Incorporation—In vitro transcription/translation was carried out with the p3.2 construct containing the MCL1 cDNA (29Yang T. Kozopas K.M. Craig R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), using the TnTT7 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega; control DNA provided).Western blotting and densitometric scanning were carried out as described (9Vrana J.A.

Kozopas K.M. Craig R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), using Met- or phosphate-free RPMI 1640 medium and dialyzed serum. With [32P]orthophosphate, cells were preincubated in this medium for 1.5 h. Pulsechase experiments were carried out essentially as described previously (29Yang T. Kozopas K.M. Craig R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), with 15 mg/ml nonradioactive methionine being present in the chase medium. MCL1 protein remaining was calculated relative to the initial (zero time) value, after normalization for tubulin expression.Generation of Mutant Constructs—Mutations were prepared using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene Cloning Systems, La Jolla, CA; primers shown in Table 1) and confirmed by sequencing.

After centrifugation (12,000 rpm for 5 min), MCL1 was immunoprecipitated from the lysate using an anti-MCL1 antibody (S-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) conjugated to Dynabeads (M-280; Dynal, Norway). Immunoprecipitation was carried out overnight at 4 °C. The Dynabeads were prepared as follows: (i) washing and suspension in 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 142.5 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EGTA; (ii) conjugation to the anti-MCL1 antibody by incubation at 4 °C for 3 h with gentle rocking; and (iii) washing the conjugated Dynabeads with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. After centrifugation (13,000 rpm), the immunoprecipitates were suspended in SDS loading buffer, heated at 90 °C for 15 min with vortexing every 5 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. After staining using enhanced Coomassie Blue dye, the portion of the gel containing the MCL1 doublet was excised. This was submitted to the Harvard University Microchemistry and Proteomics Analysis Facility, Cambridge, MA. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used because attempts to isolate sufficient MCL1 Edman degradation were unsuccessful.For experiment 1, the MCL1 sample was reduced and alkylated using dithiothreitol and iodoacetamide, followed by digestion with trypsin and chymotrypsin together. Nano-capillary reversed phase HPLC was carried out using a 75-μm inner diameter glass capillary column with a 15-μm spray tip (New Objective Inc., Woburn, MA) packed with 10 cm of YMC C18 media. A Surveyor HPLC (Thermo Finnigan) was connected to a three-way tee where flow was split ∼300:1, with ∼350 nl/min flow directed to the analytical column. Sample loading was via a manual pressure bomb at 400 p.s.i. HPLC solvents were 0.29% acetic acid in water (A buffer) and acetonitrile (B buffer) with a linear gradient from 1% B to 51% B over 50 min, followed by a 95% B column wash and column re-equilibration. Mass spectrometry was preformed on a Thermo Finnigan Deca XP+ ion trap operating in data-dependent mode (with the most intense four ions selected for MS/MS fragmentation from each full MS scan) with dynamic exclusion enabled (120-s exclusion duration for each MS/MS spectra acquired), as well as a selected ion monitoring mode targeting the N-terminal peptides of interest. Collected spectra were identified using the Sequest algorithm and manually verified for fidelity to MCL1.For experiment 2, the sample was reduced and alkylated as described and digested with endoproteinase Glu-C. The nanocapillary reversed phase HPLC was performed using a similar arrangement as above, but using a Hewlett-Packard 1100 HPLC system equipped with a FAMOS (LC Packings) autosampler. Data analysis was also as described previously; however, no further selected ion monitoring experiments were performed.Experiment 3 was conducted in a similar fashion, with the sample reduced and alkylated, followed by separate digestions of endoproteinase Glu-C and chymotrypsin. The HPLC system used was a Waters Nano-Acquity UPLC, which enabled the use of a trapping column and direct flow chromatography at 300 nl/min flow rates using 0.1% formic acid buffers (both A and B) and a similar gradient. In this case, 100-μm inner diameter IntegraFrit columns (New Objective Inc.) packed with 2 cm of Magic C18-AQ (Microm Bioresources Inc.) 5-μm beads were used for the trapping column (trapping a 5-μl injection for 5 min at 5 μl/min in 100% A buffer), with 15 cm of Magic C18-AQ 3-μm beads used in the 75-μm inner diameter analytical column. The sample was analyzed using an LTQ-Orbitrap hybrid linear ion trap/Orbitrap instrument (Thermo Finnigan), which acquired full MS scans in the Orbitrap at high resolution (60,000 resolution (full peak width at half-maximum height)) and low parts per million mass accuracy, whereas the linear ion trap concurrently acquired MS/MS spectra of the four most abundant ions per full MS scan, with dynamic exclusion duration of 30 s per ion as described previously. The use of this instrument led to a dramatic increase in protein coverage and overall confidence of results, with the obtained"

Rapid weight loss brought about by administration of leptin or dietary restriction increases biliary cholesterol excretion. We hypothesized that the reduction in biliary cholesterol in mice harboring defects in the leptin axis is associated with a reduction in G5G8 transporters and that levels of the transporter would increase with leptin administration and dietary restriction. We examined mRNA and protein levels for G5 and G8 in db/db and ob/ob mice. In both models G5 and G8 protein levels were reduced. In ob/ob mice, both leptin administration and dietary restriction increased G5 and G8 protein and biliary cholesterol concentrations. Finally, we examined the effects of tauroursodeoxycholate, which has been shown to increase biliary cholesterol excretion and function as a molecular chaperone. Tauroursodeoxycholate increased G5 and G8 protein and biliary cholesterol concentrations in both wild-type and db/db mice.

Conversely, expression of a human transgene in mice results in a 6–8-fold increase in biliary cholesterol concentration and supersaturation of bile (7Yu L. Li-Hawkins J. Hammer R.E. Berge K.E. Horton J.D. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). In the absence of dietary or pharmacological perturbations, biliary cholesterol concentrations correlate with Abcg5/Abcg8 genocopy (9Yu L. Gupta S. Xu F. Liverman A.D. Moschetta A. Mangelsdorf D.J.

Activation of the liver X receptor (LXRα, NR1H3) by cholesterol feeding or administration of an agonist increases G5 and G8 mRNA as well as biliary cholesterol concentrations (10Repa J.J. Berge K.E.

In addition, these effects are absent in mice lacking LXR α/β, suggesting that LXR is the principal regulator of G5 and G8 expression in response to dietary cholesterol (11Yu L.

Although biliary cholesterol excretion generally correlates with expression levels of G5 and G8 mRNAs, exceptions include increases in biliary cholesterol excretion after treatment with diosgenin or tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDCA) and in liver transplant patients after surgery (12Kosters A.

The uncoupling of biliary cholesterol excretion from G5 and G8 expression levels suggests that other pathways may contribute to biliary cholesterol excretion. However, it should be noted that the effects of both diosgenin and TUDCA were dependent on the presence of G5 and G8 (14Plosch T. van der Veen J.N. Havinga R. Huijkman N.C. Bloks V.W. Kuipers F. Am.

Given the role of the G5G8 sterol transporter in biliary cholesterol excretion, perhaps it is not surprising that quantitative trait locus mapping studies have identified Abcg5/Abcg8 as a lithogenic locus (16Wittenburg H.

However, the Abcg5/Abcg8 locus is only one of more than 20 quantitative trait loci associated with increased or decreased cholesterol gallstone susceptibility, indicating that many genetic factors are involved in lithogenesis (for review, see Ref. 19Lyons M.A. Wittenburg H. Gastroenterology. 2006; 131: 1943-1970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Furthermore, G5G8 transgenic mice do not develop cholesterol gallstones despite supersaturation of bile (7Yu L. Li-Hawkins J. Hammer R.E. Berge K.E. Horton J.D. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). In humans, obesity is considered a major risk factor for cholesterol gallstone formation (20Attili A.F. Capocaccia R.

Surprisingly, two mouse models of obesity, Leprdb (db/db) and Lepob (ob/ob), are protected from cholesterol gallstone formation when fed lithogenic diets that contain cholesterol and cholic acid (24Bouchard G. Johnson D. Carver T. Paigen B. Carey M.C. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1105-1113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Indeed, db/db and ob/ob mice have lower levels of biliary cholesterol than their wild-type counterparts (24Bouchard G. Johnson D. Carver T. Paigen B. Carey M.C. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1105-1113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 25Tran K.Q. Graewin S.J. Swartz-Basile D.A. Nakeeb A. Svatek C.L. Pitt H.A. Surgery. 2003; 134: 372-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Replacement of leptin results in rapid weight loss, reductions in apolipoprotein B (apoB)-containing lipoproteins, increases in biliary cholesterol concentrations, and restoration of cholesterol gallstone susceptibility (26Hyogo H.

Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1232-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Although the effects on weight loss, biliary cholesterol, and plasma cholesterol are also observed in mice that are pair-fed to match caloric intake, the control mice are still resistant to cholesterol gallstone formation, indicating that the 2–3-fold increases in biliary cholesterol concentrations are insufficient to promote gallstone formation. The precise mechanisms responsible for leptin-dependent cholesterol gallstone formation are not clear but appear to include alterations in phospholipid excretion, gallbladder motility, and bile acid hydrophobicity among others (26Hyogo H.

The metabolic consequences of leptin deficiency that include dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, steatosis, inflammation, and others compromise liver function and may be responsible for reduced biliary cholesterol excretion. Within the liver evidence of ER stress has been reported in both diet-induced obesity and in ob/ob mice (30Ozcan U. Cao Q. Yilmaz E. Lee A.H. Iwakoshi N.N. Ozdelen E. Tuncman G. Gorgun C. Glimcher L.H. Hotamisligil G.S. Science. 2004; 306: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (2908) Google Scholar). Furthermore, alleviation of ER stress by administration of chemical chaperones restores insulin sensitivity in ob/ob mice (31Ozcan U. Yilmaz E. Ozcan L. Furuhashi M. Vaillancourt E. Smith R.O. Gorgun C.Z. Hotamisligil G.S. Science. 2006; 313: 1137-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1947) Google Scholar). The assembly of the G5G8 sterol transporter occurs in the ER and is an inefficient process whereby most of the G5 and G8 monomers fail to find their respective partners and are rapidly degraded (6Graf G.A. Li W.P. Gerard R.D. Gelissen I. White A. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 659-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the overwhelming majority of disease-causing mutations in either G5 or G8 that result in sitosterolemia are due to failures in the assembly and trafficking of the G5G8 sterol transporter (32Graf G.A. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24881-24888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The assembly of the complex is dependent upon N-linked glycans that interact with the ER chaperone calnexin (32Graf G.A. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24881-24888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Under conditions of ER stress, it is plausible that the assembly of the G5G8 sterol transporter is compromised. We hypothesized that the reduction in biliary cholesterol in mice harboring defects in the leptin axis is associated with a reduction in G5G8 transporters. We examined mRNA and protein levels for each half-transporter in db/db and ob/ob mice. We also examined the effects of leptin administration, dietary restriction, and administration of the chemical chaperone TUDCA. Our findings indicate that G5 and G8 protein levels are reduced in db/db and ob/db mice compared with controls in the absence of changes in mRNA levels. In addition, both calorie restriction and TUDCA restore G5G8 protein levels and biliary cholesterol concentrations. Our results indicate that the mechanism for reduced biliary cholesterol excretion in db/db and ob/ob mice involves destabilization of the G5G8 transporter and suggests this effect may occur at the level of G5G8 heterodimer assembly within the ER. Reagents and Buffers—General chemical reagents were obtained from Sigma. Recombinant murine leptin was obtained from Biomyx Technology (San Diego, CA). Protein sample buffer was 30 mm Tris base, 10 mm EDTA, pH 6.8, 3% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.00625% bromphenol blue. Membrane buffer was 250 mm sucrose, 2 mm MgCl2, 20 mm, pH 7.5. Buffer A was 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20, 5% milk. Buffer B was 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20. Calnexin and GRP78 were purchased from Nventa (San Diego, CA). Secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents were purchased from Pierce. Rabbit anti-ABCG5 and mouse anti-ABCG8 antibodies have been previously reported (7Yu L. Li-Hawkins J.

Animals and Treatments—In the first experiment male and female db/db mice on the C57BLKS (000642) background were used at 16 weeks of age. In all subsequent experiments, db/db (000697) and ob/ob (000632) mice on the C57BL/6J background were used between 8 and 12 weeks of age. All mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Animals were housed in a temperature-controlled room with 12:12 light:dark cycle (6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.). Upon arrival mice were allowed to adapt to the environment for 1 week. All mice were maintained on standard rodent chow (Harlan Teklad 2014S). Analysis of the data from the first experiment indicated no differential effects due to sex. In all subsequent experiments male mice were used. Tissues from type I diabetic mice were generously provided by Dr. Ming Gong (University of Kentucky). STZ treatment was conducted as previously described (33Cockfield S.M. Ramassar V. Urmson J. Halloran P.F. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 1120-1128PubMed Google Scholar). ob/ob mice were injected once daily with equal volumes of saline or leptin (10 μg/g body weight, intraperitoneally) for 7 days as previously described (27Hyogo H. Roy S. Cohen D.E. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1232-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To achieve isocaloric intake, mice treated with saline were pair-fed with mice treated with leptin (27Hyogo H. Roy S. Cohen D.E. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1232-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Mice treated with TUDCA received twice-daily injections (intraperitoneally, 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m.) of 250 mg/kg (500 mg/kg/day) as previously described (31Ozcan U. Yilmaz E. Ozcan L. Furuhashi M. Vaillancourt E. Smith R.O. Gorgun C.Z. Hotamisligil G.S. Science. 2006; 313: 1137-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1947) Google Scholar). Blood glucose levels were measured using a standard glucometer from a drop of blood obtained by tail-vein prick. Control and streptozotocin (STZ) mice were killed by exsanguination under ketamine xylazine anesthesia. All others were euthanized with CO2 after a 4-h fast beginning shortly after “lights on.” Blood was collected from the right ventricle with a 1-cc syringe fitted with a 20-gauge hypodermic needle. Gall bladder bile was collected with an insulin syringe fitted with a 26-gauge needle. Bile samples were stored at –20 °C until analysis. Serum was separated by centrifugation and stored at 4 °C for fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) fractionation. Livers and other tissues were excised, rinsed with PBS to remove blood, and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissue samples were stored at –80 °C until analyses. Lipid Analyses—Serum was fractionated by FPLC using Superose 6 HR10/30 column to separate lipoprotein fractions. Serum cholesterol concentrations and cholesterol content in FPLC fractions were determined by colorimetric-enzymatic assays (Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA). The concentration of cholesterol in gallbladder bile was measured as previously described by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (34Turley S.D. Daggy B.P. Dietschy J.M. Metabolism. 1991; 40: 1063-1073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Preparation of Membrane Proteins—A total of 100–200 mg of liver or intestine (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum) was homogenized by a Polytron homogenizer in 1.2 ml of membrane buffer containing protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics). The crude preparation was centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The membrane pellet was suspended in protein sample buffer. Protein concentrations were determined by BCA assay (Pierce). SDS-PAGE and Immunoblot Analysis—Protein sample buffer was added to samples to achieve uniform concentrations, β-mercaptoethanol was added to a final concentration of 1.2% (v/v), and samples were heated to 95 °C for 5 min. Proteins were size-fractionated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were incubated in buffer A for 30 min at 22 °C. Primary antibodies were diluted in buffer A and incubated with membranes for 60 min at 22 °C. Membranes were washed 3 times for 5 min in buffer B. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and goat anti-mouse IgG (Pierce) were diluted (1:20,000) and incubated with membranes for 30 min at 22 °C. Membranes were washed 3 times for 5 min in buffer B and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Protein loading was assessed by visual inspection of Ponceau S-stained membranes and by reblotting with GRP78 and calnexin. Expression levels were semiquantified by densitometry. Radiography films were scanned as .tiff images, and sum intensities were quantified using Eastman Kodak Co. Molecular Imaging software (Version 4.0). Film background was subtracted from all bands of interest. Expression levels for G5 and G8 were normalized to signals for GRP-78 obtained by re-blotting of stripped membranes. Quantitative Real-time PCR—Total RNA was extracted from tissues using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Samples of total RNA (1.0 μg) from mouse livers were transcribed using SuperScript™ First Strand Synthesis system (Invitrogen) using random hexamers in a final total reaction volume 20 μl. Primers (Table 1) have been previously described (35Liang G. Yang J. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9520-9528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) but were validated to ensure amplification of single transcripts and covariance of amplification efficiencies with the invariant control (cyclophilin) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Applied Biosystems, Guide and User Bulletin 2). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed on an Applied Biosystems 7700 sequence detection system. Standard reaction volume was 30 μl containing 1× SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems), 1 μl of cDNA template, and 150 nm concentrations of each oligonucleotide. Initial steps of RT-PCR were 10 min at 95 °C. Cycles (n = 40) consisted of a 15-s melt at 95 °C followed by a 1-min annealing/extension at 60 °C. All reactions were performed in triplicate. Means of the differences in threshold cycle (CT) values from cyclophilin and their S.D. were calculated for each treatment group (ΔCT). The relative abundance of each transcript within treatment groups was determined by subtracting the control group mean difference from the remaining treatment groups (ΔΔCT) and calculated according to the expression 2–ΔΔCT. The S.D. of the difference between control and each treatment group was calculated as the square root of the sums of squares for the S.D. of the ΔCT means.TABLE 1Oligonucleotides used for quantitative RT-PCRTargetForwardReverseABCG5TGGATCCAACACCTCTATGCTAAAGGCAGGTTTTCTCGATGAACTGABCG8TGCCCACCTTCCACATGTCATGAAGCCGGCAGTAAGGTAGALXRαTCTGGAGACGTCACGGAGGTACCCGGTTGTAACTGAAGTCCTTSREBP-1CGGAGCCATGGATTGCACATTGGCCCGGGAAGTCACTGTCyp7A1AGCAACTAAACAACCTGCCAGTACTAGTCCGGATATTCAAGGATGCA Open table in a new tab Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed by two-way, oneway, and repeated measures of one-way analysis of variance as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” Differences due to main effects and their interactions were determined by F tests. Post hoc analyses were conducted using Bonferroni or Dunnett’s multiple comparison tests where appropriate. Steady-state levels of immunoreactive G5 and G8 were evaluated in livers of male and female db/db mice and their heterozygous controls (Fig. 1). db/db mice were significantly heavier (48 ± 5 versus 28 ± 3 g) and had elevated fasting glucose levels (185 ± 18 versus >475 mg/dl; four had values in excess of 500 mg/dl, the limit of the glucometer). Membrane proteins were prepared from livers of obese and control male and female mice (n = 10 per genotype, 5 per sex) and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis using antibodies directed against G5 and G8. For the purpose of presentation, equal amounts of membrane protein from each animal were pooled (Fig. 1A). Two bands are routinely observed for both G5 and G8. The higher molecular weight, diffuse bands correspond to the post-Golgi forms of each protein, whereas the lower molecular weight bands correspond to the reticular forms that have yet to heterodimerize and traffic to the cell surface. It should be noted that for G5, the lower molecular weight band contains both specific and nonspecific signals since it is also observed in G5G8-deficient mice (3Yu L. Hammer R.E. Li-Hawkins J. Von Bergmann K. Lutjohann D. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16237-16242Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). We evaluated the expression GRP78 (Bip) to verify equal loading of proteins among lanes. We also evaluated the expression of calnexin and calreticulin since previous reports indicate both ER lectins may be involved in the dimerization and folding of G5G8 (S1). Although no differences were observed for calreticulin, there appeared to be a modest reduction in the abundance of calnexin. We also evaluated the expression of two additional ABC transporters, ABCG2 (G2) and ABCA1 (A1). ABCG2 is the most closely related member of the G-subfamily to G5 and G8. Like G5 and G8, it is a glycoprotein that forms a dimer within the ER before the transport of the functional complex to the apical surface where it mediates excretion of dietary compounds into the biliary space (36Jonker J.W. Buitelaar M. Wagenaar E. Van Der Valk M.A. Scheffer G.L. Scheper R.J. Plosch T Kuipers F Elferink R.P. Rosing H Beijnen J.H. Schinkel A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The expression of G2 appears to be greater in male control mice than in the remaining three groups, but there were no differences between female control and db/db mice, indicating that unlike reductions in G5G8, differences in G2 could not be independently attributed to the presence of the db mutation. Like G5 and G8, ABCA1 (A1) expression is regulated by LXR. We evaluated the expression of A1 by immunoblotting (S1). In both male and female mice, A1 levels were reduced when compared with lean controls. Densitometric analysis of signal intensities for G5 and G8 was conducted for each mouse as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data are expressed as the ratio of signal intensities for G5 and G8 to Bip (Fig. 1B). The effect of genotype was significant for both G5 and G8 (p < 0.01). However, there was no effect of sex or a genotype by sex interaction. In both male and female mice, levels of G5 and G8 were reduced between 50 and 60% in db/db mice compared with controls. G5 and G8 protein levels were also determined in three segments of the small intestine. Although there was a tendency for reduced protein levels in each segment, none reached statistical significance (not shown). To determine whether the reduction in G5 and G8 protein was associated with a reduction in their respective mRNAs, total RNA was isolated and analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 1C). The analysis indicates that there was no change in G5 or G8 message levels. By way of control, we also evaluated mRNA levels for genes"
https://openalex.org/W1976151711,"Signaling through the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is hyperactivated in many human tumors, including hamartomas associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Several small molecules such as LY294002 inhibit mTOR kinase activity, but they also inhibit phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) at similar concentrations. Compound 401 is a synthetic inhibitor of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) that also targets mTOR but not PI3K in vitro (Griffin, R. J., Fontana, G., Golding, B. T., Guiard, S., Hardcastle, I. R., Leahy, J. J., Martin, N., Richardson, C., Rigoreau, L., Stockley, M., and Smith, G. C. (2005) J. Med. Chem. 48, 569-585). We used 401 to test the cellular effect of mTOR inhibition without the complicating side effects on PI3K. Treatment of cells with 401 blocked the phosphorylation of sites modified by mTOR-Raptor and mTOR-Rictor complexes (ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 Thr389 and Akt Ser473, respectively). By contrast, there was no direct inhibition of Akt Thr308 phosphorylation, which is dependent on PI3K. Similar effects were also observed in cells that lack DNA-PK. The proliferation of TSC1-/- fibroblasts was inhibited in the presence of 401, but TSC1+/+ cells were resistant. In contrast to rapamycin, long-term treatment of TSC1-/- cells with 401 did not up-regulate phospho-Akt Ser473. Because increased Akt activity promotes survival, this may explain why the level of apoptosis was increased in the presence of 401 but not rapamycin. These results suggest that mTOR kinase inhibitors might be more effective than rapamycins in controlling the growth of TSC hamartomas and other tumors that depend on elevated mTOR activity.

By contrast, there was no direct inhibition of Akt Thr308 phosphorylation, which is dependent on PI3K. Similar effects were also observed in cells that lack DNA-PK. The proliferation of TSC1-/- fibroblasts was inhibited in the presence of 401, but TSC1+/+ cells were resistant. In contrast to rapamycin, long-term treatment of TSC1-/- cells with 401 did not up-regulate phospho-Akt Ser473. Because increased Akt activity promotes survival, this may explain why the level of apoptosis was increased in the presence of 401 but not rapamycin. These results suggest that mTOR kinase inhibitors might be more effective than rapamycins in controlling the growth of TSC hamartomas and other tumors that depend on elevated mTOR activity.

This signaling network integrates growth factor-activated signals with permissive signals in the presence of sufficient amino acids and energy to result in mTOR activation. Many genetic defects found in human cancers lead to hyperactivation of mTOR signaling (1Guertin D.A. Sabatini D.M. Trends Mol. Med. 2005; 11: 353-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). It is believed that certain tumor cells become dependent on this pathway because it provides a growth or survival advantage. Therefore, drugs that inhibit mTOR have great therapeutic potential for the treatment of cancer. Rapamycin, a macrocyclic antibiotic produced by the bacterium Streptomyces hygroscopicus, binds to its intracellular receptor FKBP12 to form a complex that inhibits mTOR function. Rapamycin and its analogs are under clinical development as anti-cancer agents, but these drugs have two disadvantages: they block only some of the functions of mTOR, and they can activate the protein kinase Akt that promotes cell survival. By contrast, a small molecule designed to compete with ATP in the catalytic site of mTOR would be expected to inhibit all of the kinase-dependent signaling functions of the enzyme without enhancing the survival pathway. The mTOR kinase domain is most closely related to the one found in phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinases (PI3Ks) (2Crespo J.L. Hall M.N. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 579-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). However, unlike PI3Ks, mTOR phosphorylates proteins, not lipids. The unusual mTOR kinase domain defines the PIKK (PI3K-related kinase) family of protein serine/threonine kinases, which includes ATM (ataxia telangiectasia-mutated), ATR (ATM and Rad3-related), and DNA-PK (DNA-dependent protein kinase) (3Abraham R.T. DNA Repair (Amst). 2004; 3: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Until recently, rapamycin sensitivity was the major criterion used in mammalian systems to identify mTOR-controlled events. However, it is now known that mTOR binds to different regulatory subunits to produce multiprotein complexes with distinct signaling functions and rapamycin sensitivity (4Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 596-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). Complexes containing mTOR and Raptor (mTORC1) phosphorylate ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and are rapamycin-sensitive (5Hara K. Maruki Y. Long X. Yoshino K. Oshiro N. Hidayat S. Tokunaga C. Avruch J. Yonezawa K. Cell. 2002; 110: 177-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar). Complexes that contain mTOR and Rictor (mTORC2) phosphorylate Akt and are insensitive to the drug (6Sarbassov D.D. Guertin D.A. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M. Science. 2005; 307: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (5076) Google Scholar). Because mTOR has rapamycin-insensitive functions, it is thought that direct inhibitors of mTOR kinase activity will display broader anti-tumor activity than rapamycins. Most kinase inhibitors that have been developed for clinical applications work by competing with ATP in the catalytic site. LY294002 (Fig. 1) is a synthetic morpholino compound that was designed as a PI3K inhibitor (7Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetic studies showed that this compound behaves as a competitive inhibitor with ATP (7Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and x-ray crystallographic stuctures have revealed how LY294002 fits into the active site of the p110γ isoform of PI3K (8Walker E.H. Pacold M.E. Perisic O. Stephens L. Hawkins P.T. Wymann M.P. Williams R.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 909-919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, considering the structural similarity between the PI3K and mTOR catalytic domains, the concentration of LY294002 that gives 50% inhibition (IC50) of mTOR (IC50 ∼ 5 μm) is almost the same as for PI3K (IC50 ∼ 3 μm) (9Brunn G.J. Williams J. Sabers C. Wiederrecht G. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5256-5267Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). This compound also blocks the activity of DNA-PK (10Griffin R.J. Fontana G. Golding B.T. Guiard S. Hardcastle I.R. Leahy J.J. Martin N. Richardson C. Rigoreau L. Stockley M. Smith G.C. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 569-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). PI3Ks regulate a wide range of cellular functions including growth, metabolism and motility, and PIKKs regulate processes such as cell cycle progression and genome maintenance. Therefore, use of LY294002 as a non-selective mTOR inhibitor might have undesirable toxic side effects. Recently, Griffin et al. (10Griffin R.J. Fontana G. Golding B.T. Guiard S. Hardcastle I.R.

In this study, we tested the ability of compound 401 to inhibit mTOR signaling in vivo and evaluated its effect on proliferation and apoptosis in cells with hyperactivated mTOR signaling. Our results support the idea that inhibitors of mTOR kinase activity might be more effective than rapamycins in treating some proliferative disorders. Materials—Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) A/B, phenylephrine, and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) were from Sigma. Rapamycin, AMA37, Akt inhibitor VIII and LY294002 were from Calbiochem. Phosphospecific antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Antibodies to Akt1/2, S6K1, and Erk2 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Raptor antibody was from Bethyl Laboratories (Montgomery, TX) and AU1 antibody was from Covance (Berkeley, CA). 2-(Morpholin-1-yl)pyrimido[2,1-α]isoquinolin-4-one (compound 401) was synthesized as described earlier (10Griffin R.J. Fontana G. Golding B.T. Guiard S. Hardcastle I.R. Leahy J.J. Martin N. Richardson C. Rigoreau L. Stockley M. Smith G.C. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 569-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Its identity and purity were confirmed by 1H NMR. Akt T308D-myc-His and Akt S473D-myc-His were described earlier (11Ballou L.M. Lin H.Y. Fan G. Jiang Y.P. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23472-23479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Purification of the p110α/p85α complex from insect cells was previously described (11Ballou L.M.

The cDNA for the human p110β PI3K catalytic subunit was purchased from Invitrogen. It was found to contain a mutation (C at 2772 was changed to A) that rendered the enzyme catalytically inactive. The mutation was repaired by PCR and the coding region was subcloned into pBlueBacHis2B (Invitrogen). A baculovirus was produced using the Bac-N-Blue kit (Invitrogen). A baculovirus expressing the p85α regulatory subunit of PI3K was purchased from Orbigen (San Diego, CA). The p110β/p85α PI3K complex was purified from infected insect cells as described for p110α/p85α (11Ballou L.M. Lin H.Y. Fan G. Jiang Y.P. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23472-23479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—FreeStyle 293-F cells (Invitrogen) were grown in FreeStyle 293 Expression Medium. Rat-1 fibroblasts stably transfected with the human α1A-adrenergic receptor (12Kenny B.A. Miller A.M. Williamson I.J. O'Connell J. Chalmers D.H. Naylor A.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), COS7 cells and mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) expressing or lacking the tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) gene (a gift from Dr. D. Kwiatkowski, Harvard University) were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Sigma) containing antibiotics and 10% fetal bovine serum. M059J human glioma cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were kept in complete growth medium (a 1:1 mixture of DMEM and Ham’s F12 medium plus supplements) according to the vendor’s instructions. mTOR Assays—FreeStyle 293-F cells were transfected with cDNA for AU1-mTOR (a gift from Dr. R. T. Abraham, The Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA) using 293fectin (Invitrogen). Two days later, the cells were lysed and mTOR immunoprecipitates were prepared as described (13Chiang G.G. Abraham R.T. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 281: 125-141PubMed Google Scholar) using AU1 antibody. Alternatively, the mTORC1 complex was immunoprecipitated from untransfected cells using Raptor antibody under conditions described earlier (14Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. Kim D.H. Guertin D.A. Latek R.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Sabatini D.M. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1296-1302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2089) Google Scholar). Kinase activity in the immunoprecipitates was assayed in the presence of vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide) or compound as described (13Chiang G.G. Abraham R.T. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 281: 125-141PubMed Google Scholar) using bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase (GST)-4E-BP1 (15Jiang Y.P. Ballou L.M. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10943-10951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) as a substrate. Kinase reactions were stopped by boiling in SDS sample buffer and the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated 4E-BP1 was detected by autoradiography. Radioactivity in the bands was quantified by scintillation counting. PI3K Assays—Vehicle (dimethylformamide) or compound was added to assay tubes and the solvent was evaporated under vacuum. 35 μl of PI3K assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm EGTA) was added to each tube, and they were placed on a shaker for 10 min at 25 °C to dissolve the compounds. Then 5 μl of enzyme was added, and the mixtures were incubated for 10 min at 25 °C. Kinase assays were started by adding 5 μl of 10 mg/ml L-α-PI (Sigma) sonicated in assay buffer and 5 μl of reaction mix containing 400 μm ATP, 0.25 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) per assay, and 100 mm MgCl2 in assay buffer. Tubes were heated at 25 °C for 20 min with shaking. The reactions were stopped with 120 μl of CHCl3:CH3OH:HCl (10:20:0.2), and the tubes were put on a shaker for 10 min. After centrifuging for 5 min, 15 μl of the lower phase was spotted onto a silica gel thin layer plate and the reaction product was separated by chromatography for 1.5 h in CHCl3:CH3OH:NH4OH:H2O (86:76:10:14). Radioactive spots containing PI 3-phosphate were visualized by autoradiography, cut out of the plate and quantified by scintillation counting. For PI3K autophosphorylation, 20 μl of autophosphorylation buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 100 mm NaCl) was added to tubes containing dried vehicle or compound and they were placed on a shaker for 10 min at 25 °C. Then 5 μl of p110α/p85α PI3K was added, and the mixtures were incubated for 10 min at 25 °C. Reactions were started by adding 5 μl of autophosphorylation buffer containing 60 μm ATP, 0.25 μl of [γ-32P]ATP per assay, and 60 mm MnCl2. Tubes were heated at 25 °C for 20 min. The reactions were stopped by boiling in SDS sample buffer, and the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated p85α was detected by autoradiography. Western Blots—After treatments, cells were rinsed on ice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and a mixture of protease inhibitors. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g, equal quantities of supernatant protein were subjected to SDS gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. Signals were detected using horseradish peroxidase-linked second antibodies (GE Healthcare) and chemiluminescence reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Protein was determined by a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Apoptosis—After treatments, cells were lysed and nucleosomes in the cytoplasmic fraction were assayed using the Cell Death Detection ELISAPLUS kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim). The nucleosome level was calculated as (A405 nm - A490 nm) according to the kit instructions. Effect of 401 on Kinase Activities in Vitro—Several small molecules have been reported to inhibit mTOR kinase activity at low micromolar concentrations or better, but they show unfavorable selectivity between mTOR and PI3K (9Brunn G.J.

Weiss W.A. Williams R.L. Shokat K.M. Cell. 2006; 125: 733-747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). By contrast, compound 401 shows activity against mTOR (IC50 = 5.3 μm) but not p110α/p85α PI3K (IC50 > 100 μm, Ref. 10Griffin R.J. Fontana G. Golding B.T. Guiard S. Hardcastle I.R. Leahy J.J. Martin N. Richardson C. Rigoreau L. Stockley M. Smith G.C. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 569-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We speculated that 401 might be a useful tool to probe mTOR signaling without the complicating side effect of PI3K inhibition. First, we performed in vitro kinase assays to confirm that 401 selectively inhibits mTOR over PI3K. In agreement with the results of Griffin et al. (10Griffin R.J. Fontana G. Golding B.T. Guiard S. Hardcastle I.R. Leahy J.J. Martin N. Richardson C. Rigoreau L. Stockley M. Smith G.C. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 569-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), we found that 401 inhibited immunoprecipitated epitope-tagged mTOR or endogenous mTOR in Raptor immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2A). In both cases, inhibition of 67% or 78% was obtained at 5 μm or 10 μm 401, respectively. By contrast, dose response curves showed that the p110α/p85α or p110β/p85α PI3K complexes were poorly inhibited by 401 at these concentrations (Fig. 2B). LY294002 was much more potent than 401 at inhibiting both PI3Ks (Fig. 2B). We also tested if 401 inhibits the protein kinase activity of p110α by examining autophosphorylation of p85α in the PI3K complex. Compound 401 at 25 μm had no effect on this reaction, whereas inhibition was seen with 5 μm LY294002 (Fig. 2C). Together, these results confirm that compound 401 has increased selectivity for mTOR over PI3K. The sensitivity of 40 different protein kinases to 5 μm 401 was also determined. Most of these enzymes were inhibited less than 20% by 401 at this concentration (Table 1).TABLE 1Inhibition of protein kinases by 401Protein kinase% InhibitionProtein kinase% InhibitionABL1−5LCK−3AKT1 (PKBα)5MAP2K1 (MEK1)−8BTK9MAP4K4 (HGK)3CDK1/cyclin B3MAPK14 (p38α)17CHEK1 (CHK1)−9MAPK3 (ERK1)−3CSNK1G2 (CK1γ2)2MAPKAPK240CSNK2A1 (CK2α1)3MET (cMet)19DYRK35NTRK1 (TRKA)−17EGFR (ErbB1)−3PDGFRB (PDGFRβ)−4EPHA2−13PHKG2−6ERBB2 (HER2)3PIM144FGFR10PRKACA (PKA)−11FLT336PRKCB1 (PKCβ1)8GSK3β (GSK3β)0RET−4IGF1R−8ROCK113INSR−3RPS6KA3 (RSK2)7IRAK4−5SRC−14JAK32STK6 (Aurora A)44KDR (VEGFR2)0SYK14KIT13TEK (Tie2)12 Open table in a new tab Effect of 401 on mTOR Signaling—S6K1 and Akt are two of the best-studied effectors of mTOR signaling. Both kinases possess highly conserved phosphorylation sites in the T loop of the kinase catalytic domain and in a C-terminal hydrophobic motif. Thr389 in the hydrophobic motif of S6K1 is phosphorylated by mTORC1 (5Hara K. Maruki Y. Long X. Yoshino K. Oshiro N. Hidayat S. Tokunaga C. Avruch J. Yonezawa K. Cell. 2002; 110: 177-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar, 18Burnett P.E. Barrow R.K. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1432-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Thr389 allows 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) to phosphorylate Thr229 in the T loop to activate the enzyme (19Pullen N. Dennis P.B. Andjelkovic M. Dufner A. Kozma S.C. Hemmings B.A. Thomas G. Science. 1998; 279: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Similarly, mTORC2 phosphorylates Akt at Ser473 in the hydrophobic motif and facilitates PDK1 phosphorylation of Thr308 in the T loop (6Sarbassov D.D. Guertin D.A. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M. Science. 2005; 307: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (5076) Google Scholar). Examination of the phosphorylation state of S6K1 Thr389 and Akt Ser473 is a convenient way to assess intracellular mTORC1 and mTORC2 activity, respectively. We expected that treatment of cells with an mTOR kinase inhibitor such as 401 would block phosphorylation of both sites, unlike rapamycin, which only affects S6K1. To test the effect of 401 on growth factor-activated mTOR signaling, serum-starved Rat-1 fibroblasts were pretreated with inhibitors and then stimulated with PDGF. The phosphorylation of S6K1 and Akt was analyzed on Western blots probed with antibodies that recognize S6K1 phospho-Thr389 or Akt phospho-Ser473. As expected for an mTOR kinase inhibitor, 401 decreased the phosphorylation of both sites (Fig. 3A). Inhibition was nearly complete at a concentration of 401 (10 μm) that has little effect on PI3K activity (see Fig. 2B). Consistent with its ability to target mTOR, LY294002 also reduced the phosphorylation of both sites (Fig. 3A). By contrast, rapamycin affected only the mTORC1 site (S6K1 Thr389, Fig. 3A). Compound 401 did not inhibit the phosphorylation of Erk induced by PDGF (Fig. 3A), indicating that it does not block all PDGF receptor-induced responses. The blots were reprobed with general antibodies to S6K1, Akt, or Erk2 to show that similar amounts of each protein were present in each lane (Fig. 3A). These results are consistent with 401 acting as an mTOR kinase inhibitor in vivo. Treatment of these Rat-1 cells with phenylephrine to stimulate the α1A adrenergic receptor also induced S6K1 Thr389 phosphorylation that was inhibited in the presence of 401 or LY294002 (Fig. 3B). Because phenylephrine activation of S6K1 occurs without an increase in PI3K activity (20Ballou L.M. Cross M.E. Huang S. McReynolds E.M. Zhang B.X. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4803-4809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), it is likely that the inhibitory effect of 401 is due to inhibition of mTOR and not PI3K. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 blocked the phosphorylation of Akt Thr308 (Fig. 3A), which was expected because PI 3-phosphates promote the colocalization of Akt and PDK1 at the plasma membrane (21Anderson K.E. Coadwell J. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 684-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, Akt Thr308 phosphorylation was also inhibited in the presence of 401 (Fig. 3A). Two possible explanations for this observation are that 401 inhibits PDK1 or that Thr308 phosphorylation depends on prior phosphorylation of Ser473, as has been reported by others (22Scheid M.P. Marignani P.A. Woodgett J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6247-6260Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). To examine these possibilities, COS7 cells were transfected with Akt mutants that contain the acidic amino acid Asp at either Thr308 or Ser473 to mimic phosphorylation. Cells were then treated with insulin to induce phosphorylation of the intact site. Phosphorylation of Ser473 was inhibited in the presence of 401, but phosphorylation of Thr308 was not affected (Fig. 4). These results indicate that 401 does not inhibit PDK1, and suggest that decreased Akt Thr308 phosphorylation is an indirect effect due to inhibition of mTOR-catalyzed Ser473 phosphorylation. Because 401 is a potent inhibitor of DNA-PK (IC50 = 0.28 μm, Ref. 10Griffin R.J. Fontana G. Golding B.T. Guiard S. Hardcastle I.R. Leahy J.J. Martin N. Richardson C. Rigoreau L. Stockley M. Smith G.C. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 569-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), the possibility exists that its effects on Akt and S6K1 phosphorylation might be due either directly or indirectly to inhibition of DNA-PK. This possibility was tested in M059J glioma cells, which lack DNA-PK (23Lees-Miller S.P. Godbout R. Chan D.W. Weinfeld M. Day R.S. Barron 3rd, G.M. Allalunis-Turner J. Science. 1995; 267: 1183-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Treatment of M059J cells with 401 decreased the phosphorylation of Akt Ser473 and S6K1 Thr389 at the same doses that were effective in Rat-1 cells (Fig. 5). Thus, the inhibitory effect of 401 on phosphorylation of these mTOR sites is not due to DNA-PK inhibition. Effect of 401 on Growth and Survival of TSC1-/- MEFs—Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a disease characterized by the development of benign tumor-like growths called hamartomas in multiple tissues. This disorder is caused by mutations in the tsc1 or tsc2 tumor suppressor genes. The TSC1 and TSC2 proteins form a complex that suppresses mTOR activity. Loss of either protein leads to constitutive elevation of mTOR signaling (reviewed in Ref. 24Crino P.B. Nathanson K.L. Henske E.P. N. Engl. J. Med. 2006; 355: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that Akt activity in TSC1-/- or TSC2-/- MEFs is abnormally low as compared with control MEFs due to feedback inhibition from the hyperactivated mTORC1/S6K1 pathway (25Shah O.J. Wang Z. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1650-1656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 26Yang Q. Inoki K. Kim E. Guan K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Long term treatment of these cells with rapamycin turns off the negative feedback program and up-regulates Akt, which can provide a survival signal (25Shah O.J. Wang Z. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1650-1656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). To determine if rapamycin and 401 have different effects on Akt, TSC1-/- MEFs were incubated with drugs for increasing times for up to 24 h. Cells cultured in the presence of rapamycin exhibited an increase in Akt Ser473 phosphorylation, whereas Akt phosphorylation remained low in cells cultured with 401 (Fig. 6A). Both drugs completely blocked S6K1 Thr389 phosphorylation (Fig. 6A). Several breast cancer cell lines (BT-474, MCF-7, and ZR-754) that up-regulated phospho-Akt Ser473 after 24 h in the presence of rapamycin also maintained low Akt phosphorylation levels in the presence of 401 (Ref. 27O'Reilly K.E. Rojo F. She Q.B. Solit D. Mills G.B. Smith D. Lane H. Hofmann F. Hicklin D.J. Ludwig D.L. Baselga J. Rosen N. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1500-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2121) Google Scholar and data not shown). Next, we determined if rapamycin and 401 differentially affect the proliferation of TSC1-/- cells. Rapamycin treatment for 1 day did not cause a significant decrease in cell number as compared with the control cells, but after 2 days a significant decrease (57%) was evident (Fig. 6B). By contrast, proliferation was strongly inhibited in cells exposed to 401 for 1 day (54%) or 2 days (84%) (Fig. 6B). Growth inhibition by 401 was dose-dependent, with a half-maximal effect at roughly 2 μm (Fig. 6C). The growth inhibitory effect of 401 is not due to general toxicity, as TSC1+/+ MEFs cultured for 2 days in the presence of the drug did not show a significant decrease in cell number (Fig. 6B). The effect of 401 on cell growth is also probably not due to DNA-PK inhibition, because TSC1-/- MEFS were resistant to AMA37 (Fig. 6D), a compound that inhibits DNA-PK (IC50 = 0.27 μm) but not mTOR (IC50 > 100 μm) (28Knight Z.A. Chiang G.G. Alaimo P.J. Kenski D.M. Ho C.B. Coan K. Abraham R.T. Shokat K.M. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2004; 12: 4749-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To determine if the 401-induced decrease in cell number in the proliferation experiments above might be due in part to apoptosis, we measured the level of nucleosom"
https://openalex.org/W1989714022,"We explored the effect of copper availability on the synthesis and trafficking of peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM), an essential cuproenzyme whose catalytic domains function in the lumen of peptide-containing secretory granules. Corticotrope tumor cell lines expressing integral membrane and soluble forms of PAM were depleted of copper using bathocuproinedisulfonic acid or loaded with copper by incubation with CuCl2. Depleting cellular copper stimulates basal secretion of soluble enzyme produced by endoproteolytic cleavage of PAM in secretory granules and transit of membrane PAM though the endocytic pathway and back into secretory granules. Unlike many cuproenzymes, lack of copper does not lead to instability of PAM. Copper loading decreases cleavage of PAM in secretory granules, secretion of soluble enzyme, and the return of internalized PAM to secretory granules. The trafficking and stability of the soluble, luminal domain of PAM and truncated membrane PAM lacking a cytosolic domain are not affected by copper availability. Taken together, our data demonstrate a role for copper-sensitive cytosolic machinery in directing endocytosed membrane PAM back to secretory granules or to a degradative pathway. The response of PAM to lack of copper suggests that it facilitates copper homeostasis.

The response of PAM to lack of copper suggests that it facilitates copper homeostasis. Copper plays an essential role in cellular respiration, free-radical defense, connective tissue biosynthesis, iron metabolism, peptide amidation, and the synthesis of catecholamines (1Madsen E. Gitlin J.D. Curr. Opin. Gastroenterol. 2007; 23: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). An adequate supply of copper must be distributed to copper-requiring enzymes in various subcellular compartments without allowing free cuprous ions to react with hydrogen peroxide and generate hydroxyl radical (2Linder M.C. Hazegh-Azam M. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1996; 63 (S): 797S-811PubMed Google Scholar). Cuproproteins can be divided into two groups, those that are involved in the uptake and delivery of copper and those that require copper for catalytic activity. Plasma membrane copper transporters like Ctr1 and copper-transporting P type ATPases like ATP7A and ATP7B, along with various copper chaperones, fall into the first group (3Camakaris J. Voskoboinik I. Mercer J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 4Harris E.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 291-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Enzymes like tyrosinase, cytochrome c oxidase, Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD), 2The abbreviations used are: SOD, superoxide dismutase; BCS, bathocuproine disulfonic acid; PHM, peptidylglycine α-hydroxylating monooxygenase; PAL, peptidyl-α-hydroxyglycine α-amidating monooxygenase; TGN, trans-Golgi network; CSFM, complete serum-free medium; JP, joining peptide; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; PAM, peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase; PALm, membrane PAL. and peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM) fall into the second group. Many proteins playing important roles in copper homoeostasis have been identified. Copper enters the cell via the high affinity uptake protein, CTR1 (5Zhou B. Gitschier J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7481-7486Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Specific copper chaperones are involved in the distribution of copper to cytosolic SOD, mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase and the secretory pathway (6Culotta V.C. Klomp L.W. Strain J. Casareno R.L.

ATP7A and ATP7B deliver copper to the lumen of the secretory pathway, a transport step that is essential both for metallation of secretory pathway enzymes and for removal of excess copper from the cell (9Voskoboinik I. Camakaris J. Mercer J.F. Adv. Protein Chem. 2002; 60: 123-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As might be expected, expression and localization of the proteins essential for copper uptake and delivery are sensitive to copper levels (3Camakaris J. Voskoboinik I. Mercer J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 10Puig S. Thiele D.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 11Rees E.M. Thiele D.J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2004; 7: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The stability of several cuproenzymes is sensitive to copper levels. Both ceruloplasmin and hephaestin are normally loaded with copper in or immediately after they pass through the trans-Golgi network (12Hellman N.E. Kono S. Manchini G.M. Hoogeboom A.J. De Jong G.J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 25696-25702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Ceruloplasmin synthesized in the absence of copper is secreted normally, but is rapidly degraded in plasma (14Sato M. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5128-5134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When synthesized in the absence of copper, hephaestin, an integral membrane protein is rapidly degraded by the proteasome pathway (13Nittis T. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25696-25702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). SOD3, tyrosinase, and lysyl oxidase also receive copper in the secretory pathway (15Qin Z. Itoh S. Jeney V. Ushio-Fukai M. Fukai T. FASEB J. 2005; 20: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 16Wang N. Herbert D.N. Pigment Cell Res. 2006; 19: 3-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 17Li S. Kagan H.M. Matrix Biol. 1997; 16: 387-398Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). ATP7A binds directly to SOD3, presumably facilitating the incorporation of copper (15Qin Z. Itoh S. Jeney V. Ushio-Fukai M. Fukai T. FASEB J. 2005; 20: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Tyrosinase requires the incorporation of two copper ions into the apoenzyme during synthesis (16Wang N. Herbert D.N. Pigment Cell Res. 2006; 19: 3-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Two cuproenzymes, PAM and dopamine β-monooxygenase, are localized to the secretory granules that store bioactive peptides (18Milgram S.L. Johnson R.C. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 717-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 19Klinman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3013-3016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Little is known about the effects of copper on their stability. PAM catalyzes the C-terminal amidation of glycine-extended peptide precursors, a modification essential for the bioactivity of numerous neuropeptides (20Prigge S.T. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Amzel L.M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1236-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The amidation reaction is catalyzed by two enzymes: peptidylglycine-α-hydroxylating monooxygenase (PHM; EC 1.14.17.3) and peptidyl-α-hydroxyglycine-α-amidating lyase (PAL; EC 4.3.2.5). PHM, an ascorbate-dependent monooxygenase, contains two essential copper ions that cycle between Cu+ and Cu2+ during each reaction cycle (20Prigge S.T. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Amzel L.M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1236-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Both copper atoms are easily removed with chelators and purified PHM must be loaded with exogenous copper to have full activity (20Prigge S.T. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Amzel L.M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1236-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). PAM occurs naturally in both integral membrane and soluble forms, providing a unique opportunity to compare the effects of copper availability on membrane and soluble forms of the same enzyme. En route through the secretory pathway, inactive propeptides are activated through the sequential actions of several peptide processing enzymes and PAM (21Steiner D.F. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 22Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Brain Res. 1999; 848: 45-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). PAM and these other processing enzymes are targeted together with their prohormone substrates to the regulated secretory pathway (23Hutton J.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 1131-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 24Halban P.A. Irminger J.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). PAM is active in the TGN and immature secretory granules (25Milgram S.L. Kho S.T. Martin G.V. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 695-706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The biologically active peptides produced are stored in secretory granules, ready to undergo regulated release in response to external stimuli. Upon exocytosis, soluble PAM is secreted along with the bioactive peptides and membrane PAM appears on the plasma membrane and is retrieved by endocytosis (26Milgram S.L. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The signals essential for the entry of membrane PAM into secretory granules and for its endocytic trafficking are contained within its cytosolic domain and include phosphorylation and dephosphorylation at multiple sites. The small amount of PAM on the plasma membrane at steady state undergoes rapid internalization and may be packaged into new granules or undergo lysosomal degradation (27Steveson T.C. Keutmann H.T. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21128-21138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 28Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We used corticotrope tumor cell lines expressing integral membrane and soluble forms of PAM to assess the effects of copper availability on PAM biosynthesis and trafficking. While the trafficking of soluble PHM was unaffected by copper availability, depleting cellular copper facilitated the return of internalized membrane PAM to secretory granules. Elevated copper levels increased the degradation of internalized PAM. The cytosolic domain of PAM is essential to its ability to respond to copper availability. Cell Culture—PAM proteins are numbered according to GenBank™ NM_013000. Wild-type AtT-20 cells and stable lines expressing PAM-1 (PAM-(1–976)) (18Milgram S.L. Johnson R.C. Mains R.E. J.

Cells were loaded with copper by preincubation for 2 h in growth medium containing 10 or 20 μm CuCl2. Cells were depleted of copper by overnight (16 h) incubation in growth medium containing 50 μm bathocuproine disulfonic acid (BCS). Subsequent biosynthetic, biotinylation, and antibody internalization experiments continued the initial copper depletion or copper loading treatments. All cell culture materials were from Mediatech Inc. (Herndon, VA). Sera were from Fisher, Hampton, NH. PAM Enzymatic Assays—Peptidylglycine α-hydroxylating monooxygenase assays were performed using acetyl-Tyr-Val-Gly (31Ciccotosto G.D. Schiller M.R. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Recombinant PHMcc was purified as described (30Kolhekar A.S. Keutmann H.T. Mains R.E. Quon A.S.W. Eipper B.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10901-10909Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Western Blot—Samples fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking with 5% nonfat dried milk in Tris-Tween Buffered Saline (TTBS: 50 mm TrisHCl, 0.05% Tween-20, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5), primary antibody was applied in TTBS for 2 h at room temperature. Exon A was visualized using rabbit polyclonal antibody JH629 (rPAM-1-(394–498), 1:1000) (32Yun H-Y. Milgram S.L Keutmann H.T Eipper B.A. J. Biol.

PHM was visualized using rabbit polyclonal antibody JH1761 (rPAM-1-(37–382), 1:1000)) (31Ciccotosto G.D. Schiller M.R. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). TGN-38 was visualized using a rabbit polyclonal antibody to the luminal domain (1:1000) (33Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17526-17535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Bound antibody was visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and Super Signal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). When quantification was performed, non-saturated signals were acquired with a GeneGnome work station using Gene-Tools software (Syngene, Frederick, MD). The effect of copper status on phosphorylation of PAM-1/Ser937 and PAM-1/Ser949 was evaluated using phosphospecific antisera to analyze cell extracts prepared using SDS lysis buffer (27Steveson T.C.

Localization by Immunofluorescence—PAM-1 AtT-20 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (50 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) for 30 min, permeabilized with 0.075% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min, and blocked with 2 mg/ml BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature (18Milgram S.L. Johnson R.C. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 717-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Fixed cells were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Following extensive rinsing with PBS, cells were incubated in the appropriate FITC- or Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. After rinsing, slides were mounted with glass coverslips using Permafluor mounting medium (Immunotech, Marseilles, France). Cells were observed using a Nikon TE300 fluorescence microscope and images were acquired with a Hamamatsu digital CCD camera C4742-95-2ERG connected to an Orca-ER camera controller using OpenLab software (Improvision, Lexington, MA). Measurement of Immunoactive ACTH and JP-amide—For radioimmunoassays, cells were extracted in 5 n acetic acid with protease inhibitors and then diluted 3-fold with water. Samples were divided into two aliquots: BSA (2 mg/ml) was added to one aliquot, and all samples were lyophilized. Samples were dissolved in radioimmunoassay buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100) with protease inhibitors. Samples lacking BSA were assayed for protein content using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Samples containing BSA were used for radioimmunoassay. ACTH radioimmunoassay used antibody Kathy (1:15,000), 125I-labeled ACTH-(1–39) (NEN Life Science Products) and synthetic ACTH-(1–39) (Peninsula) as the standard; this antibody only recognizes POMC products in which the C-terminal end of ACTH-(1–39) is exposed (31Ciccotosto G.D. Schiller M.R. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Amidated Joining Peptide radioimmunoassay used antibody Jamie (1:5000), 125I-labeled Tyr-Joining Peptide(12–18)NH2 and amidated Joining Peptide(12–18)NH2 (PNPSPAN-NH2) as the standard (Vega Biotechnologies); this antibody does not cross-react significantly with Joining Peptide-Gly, ACTH biosynthetic intermediate or POMC but does recognizes N-terminally extended peptides (34Eipper B.A. Park L. Keutmann H.T. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8686-8694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies Jamie and JH93, which is specific for the N-terminal region of ACTH (35Zhou A. Bloomquist B.T. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1763-1769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were used for immunostaining. Endocytic Trafficking of PAM-1—To assess endocytic trafficking, PAM-1 AtT-20 cells were incubated in complete serum-free medium (CSFM) (with 1 mg/ml BSA added) containing a 1:50 dilution of rabbit polyclonal antiserum JH629 for 10 min at 37 °C and then rinsed and either fixed immediately (Pulse; a measure of antibody uptake) or incubated in antibody-free medium for 30 min at 37 °C (Chase; a measure of antibody retention) before fixation. Internalized antibody was visualized using Cy3-tagged second antibody. Total PAM protein was visualized using a monoclonal antibody to the cytosolic domain of PAM and FITC-tagged second antibody. Non-saturated images were acquired under identical conditions and analyzed using Simple PCI software (Compix, Cranberry, PA). As shown previously (26Milgram S.L. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), monovalent PAM antibody is internalized in a similar manner. A quantitative assessment of endocytic trafficking was made using peroxidase-tagged antibody. Affinity-purified Exon A antibody (0.3 mg) was linked to EZlink Activated HRP (1 mg) (31496; Pierce) and purified by binding to protein A-agarose (Repligen Corp., Waltham, MA). Based on a solid phase ELISA using recombinant Exon A (50 ng/well), recovery of purified HRP conjugate was 99%. PAM-1 AtT-20 cells plated into a 96-well plate were incubated with HRP-Exon A antibody (8 μg/ml) for 10 min, rinsed, and either harvested immediately (Pulse; a measure of antibody uptake) or chased for 5, 15, 30, or 60 min in complete serum free medium before harvest; duplicate samples were analyzed. Chase media were centrifuged to remove debris and transferred to empty wells of the 96-well plate. Cells were washed three times and extracted into TMT (20 mm NaTES, 10 mm mannitol, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) by incubation at 4 °C for 30 min followed by freeze/thawing. Peroxidase levels were assessed by adding 100 μl of TMB substrate solution (Pierce) to each well. Pure HRP (0.001–2.5 ng) (Pierce) was assayed at the same time, providing a standard curve. The reaction was stopped after 30 min by adding 2 m H2SO4 (100 μl) and A450 was recorded using a Wallac Spectrophotometer (450-nm absorbance filter, 20-nm bandwidth). Transferrin Internalization—PAM-1 AtT-20 cells were incubated in CSFM (lacking transferrin) containing 1 mg/ml BSA and 0.1 mg/ml AlexaFluor546 Transferrin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 10 min at 37 °C, rinsed and either fixed immediately or chased in CSFM for 30 min at 37 °C before fixation. PAM was visualized using antibody to Exon A and FITC-tagged second antibody; AlexaFluor546 Transferrin was visualized directly. Biosynthetic Labeling—Cell lines plated into 4-well dishes were allowed to reach 70–80% confluency. Following a 5-min incubation in medium lacking Met, cells were incubated in Met-minus CSFM-air containing [35S]Met (1 mCi/ml; PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA or GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) for 20 min and harvested immediately or chased for different times in CSFM-air. Cells were harvested in TMT; chase medium was centrifuged to remove cell debris. PAM was immunoprecipitated using antibody to PHM (JH1761) or Exon A (JH629). Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and newly synthesized proteins were visualized by fluorography following impregnation of the gel with Enhance. Surface Biotinylation—PAM-1 AtT-20 cells were plated in triplicate in 12-well dishes. On the day of the experiment, cells were equilibrated in CSFM-air supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, insulin/transferrin/selenium for 20 min at 37 °C. Before addition of the biotin derivative, cells were rinsed three times with pre-warmed 15 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 4 mm KCl, 25 mm glucose. Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (1.25 mm) (Pierce) dissolved in the same buffer was allowed to react for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction was quenched by incubating the cells with CSFM-air supplemented with 2 mg/ml BSA. Cells were either extracted immediately (Pulse) or incubated for 30 min (Chase). Following extraction into TMT supplemented with protease inhibitors (30 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml α2-macroglobulin, and 16 μg/ml benzamidine), clarified lysates and media were incubated with neutravidin beads (40 μl slurry) (Pierce) for 60 min at 4 °C. Beads were rinsed twice with TMT containing protease inhibitors and bound proteins were eluted into Laemmli sample buffer by heating for 5 min at 95 °C. Co-immunoprecipitation—Membranes prepared by centrifugation (430,00 × g for 15 min) of PAM-1 AtT-20 cells extracted into 10 mm NaTES, 20 mm mannitol, pH 7.4 were solubilized by tumbling in TMT for 30 min at 4 °C. Solubilized membranes were incubated with antibody to ATP7A (5 μl CT77) (36Steveson T.C. Ciccotosto G.D. Ma X.M. Mueller G.P. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) or PAM cytosolic domain (PAM-(898–976)) (5 μl 6E6) (25Milgram S.L. Kho S.T. Martin G.V. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 695-706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for 2 h at 4 °C. Antibody/antigen complexes were isolated using protein A/G-agarose beads (Pierce) (1 h, 4 °C). Beads were rinsed twice with TMT; proteins eluted into Laemmli sample buffer (5 min, 95 °C) were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Efficient immunoprecipitation of ATP7A and PAM-1 was verified by comparison to input samples. Copper Slows the Processing of PAM and Secretion of PHM—Overnight incubation of cells with bathocuproinedisulfonate is frequently used to reduce the availability of copper (12Hellman N.E. Kono S.

Pharmacol. 1996; 119: 533-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The ability of BCS to limit copper availability in AtT-20 cells was verified by monitoring peptide amidation, a reaction that is dependent upon the binding of copper to PAM (36Steveson T.C. Ciccotosto G.D. Ma X.M. Mueller G.P. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Proopiomelanocortin normally yields two amidated peptides, Joining Peptide and αMSH (34Eipper B.A. Park L. Keutmann H.T. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8686-8694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Levels of Joining Peptide amide were reduced at least 5-fold following overnight BCS treatment while levels of ACTH were unaltered (supplemental Fig. S1). The medium used to maintain AtT-20 cells nominally contains 5 nm CuCl2; to load the system with copper, 10 or 20 μm CuCl2 was added to the medium for 2 h. Although higher copper levels are frequently utilized, concentrations above 20 μm had an inhibitory effect on protein synthesis in AtT-20 cells. To determine whether copper levels affect the synthesis and secretion of PAM, AtT-20 cells stably expressing PAM-1 were either depleted of copper by overnight incubation with BCS, kept in normal medium (Control) or exposed to medium containing elevated levels of CuCl2 (Copper). Newly synthesized proteins were labeled by incubating cells in [35S]Met/Cys-containing medium of varying copper content and either harvested immediately (Pulse, P) or chased for 3 h before harvest (Chase, C) (Fig. 1). Based on precipitation of total protein with trichloroacetic acid, the copper content of the medium did not affect total protein synthesis (data not shown). PAM was immunoprecipitated from cell extracts and spent media, and newly synthesized PAM was visualized by fluorography (Fig. 1A). During the 3-h chase, the newly synthesized 120-kDa PAM protein present after the pulse incubation moves through the Golgi complex, enters immature secretory granules and begins to undergo cleavage (28Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Endoproteolytic cleavage within Exon A yields soluble PHM (45 kDa) and membrane PAL (70 kDa, PALm). Soluble PHM can be stored or secreted, while intact PAM-1 and PALm undergo endocytosis following fusion of granules with the plasma membrane (28Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Analysis of short chase times (30 and 60 min) failed to reveal any effect of BCS treatment on the time at which newly synthesized PAM first undergoes endoproteolytic cleavage (supplemental Fig. S2). Because the stability of many cuproenzymes is decreased when copper is not available (13Nittis T. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25696-25702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 16Wang N. Herbert D.N. Pigment Cell Res. 2006; 19: 3-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 38Sato S.M. Mains R.E. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 773-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we quantified the recovery of PAM proteins after the chase. Setting the amount of labeled 120-kDa PAM recovered after the pulse to 100%, it is clear that neither lack of copper nor excess copper significantly alters the recovery of PAM proteins (Fig. 1A; p for BCS versus Con or BCS versus Cu > 0.05). A significant amount of the newly synthesized PAM-1 and PALm reaches the plasma membrane and undergoes endocytosis during the 3-h chase period. Determinants in its cytosolic domain govern whether endocytosed PAM re-enters secretory granules, where it is again subject to endoproteolytic cleavage to 45-kDa PHM plus 70-kDa PALm, or undergoes degradation. We next asked whether cleavage of 120-kDa PAM to 45-kDa PHM were altered by copper levels. BCS pretreatment increased the amount of 120 kDa PAM cleaved to produce 45 kDa PHM (Fig. 1B). Soluble PHM can be stored or secreted. After the 3-h chase, almost 55% of the total radiolabeled PAM protein recovered is soluble PHM in the medium (Fig. 1C). The presence of 20 μm CuCl2 decreased secretion of 45-kDa PHM. Whereas lack of copper produces catalytically inactive enzyme (39Eipper B.A. Stoffers D.A. Mains R.E. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1992; 15: 57-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar), PAM turnover is not increased when copper levels are low. High levels of copper diminish PAM processing and secretion. The effect of CuCl2 on secretion is not due to blockage of Ca+2 entry, which is required for secretion, because similar levels of other divalent metals had no effect on secretion (Zn2+, Ni2+, Cd2+, Mn2+, Mg2+). Copper Decreases the Rate at Which Antibody Internalized by PAM-1 Leaves the Endocytic Pathway—Exocytosis of secretory granules containing membrane PAM and soluble PHM along with stored peptide hormone leads to the appearance of PAM-1 on the plasma membrane and to the secretion of PHM. To assess the effect of copper levels on the en"

There are two mouse and human p66 paralogs, p66alpha and p66beta. The functions of these genes are not clear, in part because there are no mutants available, except in invertebrate model systems.We made loss of function mutants in the mouse p66alpha gene (mp66alpha, official name Gatad2a, MGI:2384585). We found that mp66alpha is essential for development, as mutant embryos die around day 10 of embryogenesis. The gene is not required for normal blastocyst development or for implantation. The phenotype of mutant embryos and the pattern of gene expression in mutants are consistent with a role of mp66alpha in gene silencing.mp66alpha is an essential gene, required for early mouse development. The lethal phenotype supports a role in execution of methylated DNA silencing."

One cDNA contained a premature termination codon, two contained splice variants, and four contained full-length open reading frames punctuated by eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The SNPs encoded amino acid variants located within the serpin scaffold but not the reactive site loop (RSL). Although the mouse orthologue, Serpinb11, could inhibit trypsin-like peptidases, SERPINB11 showed no inhibitory activity. To determine whether the human RSL targeted a different class of peptidases or the serpin scaffold was unable to support inhibitory activity, we synthesized chimeric human and mouse proteins, in which the RSLs had been swapped. The human RSL served as a trypsin inhibitor when supported by mouse scaffold sequences. Conversely, the mouse RSL on the human scaffold showed no inhibitory activity. These findings suggested that variant residues in the SERPINB11 scaffold impaired serpin function. SDS-PAGE analysis supported this notion as RSL-cleaved SERPINB11 was unable to undergo the stressed-to-relaxed transition typical of inhibitory type serpins. Mutagenesis studies supported this hypothesis, since the reversion of amino acid sequences in helices D and I to those conserved in other clade B serpins partially restored the ability of SERPINB11 to form covalent complexes with trypsin. Taken together, these findings suggested that SERPINB11 SNPs encoded amino acids in the scaffold that impaired RSL mobility, and HapMap data showed that the majority of genomes in different human populations harbored these noninhibitory SERPINB11 alleles.

The majority of serpins are plasma proteins that serve as critical regulators of important physiological processes, such as blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, and inflammation. In contrast, clade B serpins exist predominantly, but not exclusively, as intracellular proteins with a cytoplasmic or nucleocytoplasmic distribution (9Uemura Y. Pak S.C. Luke C. Cataltepe S. Tsu C.

Other distinct features of clade B serpins include the absence of both cleavable N-terminal signal peptides and terminal extensions (N- or C-) relative to the prototypical serpin, α1-antitrypsin (SERPINA1) (reviewed in Refs. 4Silverman G.A.

The clade B cluster at 13A3.2 is greatly expanded (n = 15) relative to that of the human locus at 6p25 (17Kaiserman D. Knaggs S. Scarff K.L. Gillard A. Mirza G. Cadman M. McKeone R. Denny P.

Except for the SCCA locus, which contains SERPINB3 and -B4 in humans and Serpinb3a, -b, -c, and -d in mice, the remaining eight clade B serpins mapping to human 18q21 and mouse 1D1 show 1:1 orthology and are highly conserved in terms of gene structure, gene order, and amino acid sequence (18Askew D.J. Askew Y.S. Kato Y. Turner R.F. Dewar K. Lehoczky J. Silverman G.A. Genomics. 2004; 84: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These correlations suggest that the functional activity of the clade B serpins has been retained throughout mammalian evolution and that knowledge gained about any one of these genes should help define the overall activity of each orthologous pair. Amino acid analysis of the human and mouse RSLs confirms that these orthologous pairs are likely to demonstrate identical inhibitory profiles (18Askew D.J. Askew Y.S. Kato Y. Turner R.F. Dewar K. Lehoczky J. Silverman G.A. Genomics. 2004; 84: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Of this set of eight orthologous clade B serpins, only human SERPINB11 and mouse Serpinb11 have yet to be characterized. The goal of this study was to use recombinant human and mouse proteins to define the biochemical activity of this pair of clade B serpins. Although Serpinb11 inhibited trypsin-like peptidases, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human gene generated several different amino acid variants within the serpin scaffold that precluded proper inhibitory function in vitro. Based on current haplotype data, the majority of SERPINB11 alleles encoded proteins that lack detectable inhibitory activity. Identification of SERPINB11 and Its Mouse Orthologue—SERPINB11 (per the nomenclature guidelines, human genes (italicized) and gene products (not italicized) are uppercase, and mouse gene and gene products are lowercase after the first letter) was identified by electronic hybridization using the BLAST2 algorithm. Serpinb11 was identified using the SERPINB11 cDNA sequence and BLAST programs to query the mouse genomic and EST data bases as reported (18Askew D.J. Askew Y.S. Kato Y. Turner R.F. Dewar K. Lehoczky J. Silverman G.A. Genomics. 2004; 84: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). cDNA Isolation and DNA Sequencing—The SERPINB11 cDNA was amplified from prostate and lung first-strand cDNAs (Clontech) using specific primers (forward 1, 5′-ATGGGTTCTCTCAGCACAGCTAAC-3′; reverse 1, 5′-GAGGTGTGAACAGCTTTTTGG-3′) as described (19Cataltepe S.

A heminested PCR was performed using the cDNA templates from first-round PCR with forward 1 and reverse 2 primers (reverse 2, 5′-CATCTGCAACTCTGAGCCTTG-3′). The resulting PCR fragments were ligated into pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) or pCR®2.1-TOPO® (Invitrogen) and sequenced. Sequences were analyzed using MacVector 6.0 (Accelrys Inc., Princeton, NJ). Serpinb11 was amplified and cloned from a mouse lung cDNA library (Clontech) as described (18Askew D.J. Askew Y.S. Kato Y.

Site-directed Mutagenesis—SERPINB11 cDNA sequences were mutated using the QuikChange kit per the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing, as described (21Luke C. Schick C. Tsu C. Whisstock J.C. Irving J.A. Bromme D. Juliano L. Shi G.P. Chapman H.A. Silverman G.A.

Production of Recombinant Proteins—SERPINB11 coding sequences were excised from pBluescript or pCR®2.1-TOPO® by BamHI/XhoI digestion. The Serpinb11 coding sequence was excised from pBluescript by EcoRI/XhoI digestion. The cDNAs were subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences). GST fusion proteins were batch-purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) as described (22Schick C. Kamachi Y. Bartuski A.J. Cataltepe S. Schechter N.M. Pemberton P.A.

RSL Swap Mutations—The RSL of Serpinb11 was flanked by PstI sites located 5′ in the proximal hinge region and 3′ in the pGEX-6P-1 backbone. To generate a PstI site in the identical position within the proximal hinge region of SERPINB11d, an A1014T transversion was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. To facilitate the RSL swap, a second PstI site located in the proximal portion of SERPINB11d (site not present in the mouse sequence) was eliminated also by a site-directed transversion (A153T). The PstI RSL fragments of SERPINB11d and Serpinb11 were isolated after restriction endonuclease digestion and agarose gel electrophoresis. The fragments were ligated into PstI-digested Serpinb11-pGEX-6P-1 and SERPNB11d-pGEX-6P-1, respectively. Correct insertions of the human and mouse RSLs into the mouse and human serpin scaffolds, respectively, were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis.

Cathepsin reaction buffer (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA) was used with cathepsins K, L, and V.

The concentrations of recombinant serpins were determined by using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit II (Bio-Rad). Screening Assays for Enzyme Inhibition—The inhibitory activities of Serpinb11 and SERPINB11 were determined initially by mixing the inhibitor with various peptidases in appropriate buffer, incubating for 30 min at 25 °C, and measuring residual enzyme activity as described (22Schick C.

Residual enzyme activity was determined by adding the appropriate substrate and measuring hydrolysis over time (velocity) using either a THERMOmax (in the case of UV-visible substrates) or fmax (in the case of fluorescent substrates) microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).

Open table in a new tab Stoichiometry of Inhibition (SI)—Assays were performed in a final volume of 100 μl in a 96-well microtiter plate (Costar, Cambridge, MA). Varying amounts of inhibitor were incubated with enzyme for 30 min at 25 °C. Substrate, at a final concentration of 1 mm VLK-pNA for plasmin and 0.2 mm H-Glu-Gly-Arg-pNA for trypsin, was added to each well, and the velocity of substrate hydrolysis was determined by measuring the A405 using the THERMOmax microplate reader. Enzyme Kinetics—The apparent second order rate constants for the interaction of trypsin or plasmin with serpin were determined by the progress curve method under pseudo-first order conditions (26Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 201-301PubMed Google Scholar). A constant amount of enzyme (2.0 nm trypsin or 10 nm plasmin) and substrate (final concentration 2.0 mm AAPR-pNA or 0.5 mm VLK-pNA, respectively) were mixed with different concentrations of inhibitor (0–1000 nm), and product formation was measured over time. Since the inhibition of trypsin or plasmin is assumed to be irreversible, the course of the reaction can be fit via nonlinear regression, where product formation (P) proceeds at an initial velocity (vz) and is inhibited over time (t) at a rate (kobs). P=(vz/kobs)×[1−e(−kobst)]Eq. 1 For each combination of enzyme and inhibitor, a kobs was calculated by nonlinear regression analysis using Equation 1. A second order rate constant (k′) was determined by plotting a series of kobs versus the respective inhibitor concentration and measuring the slope of the line (k′=Δkobs/Δ[I]). Since the inhibitor was in competition with the substrate, the second order rate constant (k′) was corrected (ka) for the substrate concentration and the Km of the enzyme for the substrate. ka=k′×(1+[S]/Km)Eq. 2 The Km of human trypsin for AAPR-pNA in PBS was 50 μm, and that of plasmin for VLK-pNA in PBS was 230 μm. All kinetic studies were repeated 2–4 times. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Proteins were mixed with 2–4× gel loading buffer (4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 120 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 2% β-mercaptoethanol), heated to 95 °C for 3–5 min, and separated by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide; 19% T, 1% C) according to the method of Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar). The running buffer (pH 8.3) was 25 mm Tris-base, 250 mm glycine, and 0.1% SDS. Protein bands were visualized after staining in a solution of 0.25% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, 45% methanol, and 10% acetic acid. For immunodetection, proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were electroblotted at 100 V for 1 h at 4 °C onto reinforced nitrocellulose (NitroPure, Osmonics Inc., Westborough, MA) as described (22Schick C. Kamachi Y. Bartuski A.J. Cataltepe S. Schechter N.M. Pemberton P.A. Silverman G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1849-1855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The transfer buffer was 25 mm Tris-base, pH 8.0, and 190 mm glycine, pH 8.3. Recombinant serpin was detected using a monoclonal goat anti-GST antibody (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1:1000 as the primary antibody and a horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-goat antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) diluted 1:10,000 as the secondary antibody. Immunoblots were visualized using the ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Complex Formation—Recombinant serpin (20 ng/μl PBS, pH 7.4) in the presence or absence of trypsin (20:1 molar ratio) was incubated at 25 °C. At 1, 5, and 20 min, 20-μl aliquots were removed, mixed with 4× Laemmli loading buffer, boiled for 3 min, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Partial Digestion of Serpin Proteins—Clostripain was diluted to 0.15 units/ml in 3.3 mm dithiothreitol and 0.5× PBS, pH 7.4, and activated by incubation for 2 h at 25 °C. For partial digestion, 5 μg of recombinant serpin in 51 μl of PBS, pH 7.4, was incubated 20 min at 25 °C with 51 μl of activated clostripain in 10 mm dithiothreitol. The amount of clostripain in each reaction varied with the serpin and was adjusted to cleave ∼50% of the RSL substrates: 0.00024 units for Serpinb3b, 0.00006 units for Serpinb11 and Serpinb11-hRSL, and 0.00003 units for SERPINB11d and SERPINB11d-(E90L,S91F,P303S). Digestion was terminated by the addition of EDTA pH 8.0 to a final concentration of 25 mm. Thermostability Assays—Assays were performed as described (21Luke C. Schick C. Tsu C. Whisstock J.C. Irving J.A. Bromme D. Juliano L. Shi G.P. Chapman H.A. Silverman G.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7081-7091Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, aliquots containing 1 μg of undigested or partially digested recombinant serpin were incubated at temperatures ranging from 37 to 95 °C, transferred to ice for 10 min, and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Mass Spectroscopy (MALDI-MS)—Human trypsin (0.2 μg) or plasmin (0.6 μg) was mixed with Serpinb11 (4.4 μg) in 20 μl of PBS. Following either a 3- or 30-min incubation at 25 °C, the protein mixtures were frozen and stored at −80 °C. The mixture components were separated by MALDI-MS at the Wistar Protein Microchemistry Facility (Philadelphia, PA). Tissue Expression Survey—First-strand cDNA samples from human adult tissues (multiple tissue cDNA panels; Clontech) were assayed by PCR for SERPINB11 transcripts using specific primers (forward 2 (5′-AAGCAGCTGAATTCGGGGACG-3′) and reverse 2 (see above)) that amplified a 490-bp product (19Cataltepe S. Gornstein E.R. Schick C. Kamachi Y. Chatson K. Fries J. Silverman G.A. Upton M.P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2000; 48: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To control for template integrity, cDNA samples were assayed for a 616-bp β-actin fragment (forward primer, 5′-CCTCGCCTTTGCCGATCC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GGATCTTCATGAGGTAGTCAGTC-3′). Similarly, first-strand cDNA samples from adult mouse tissues and mouse embryos were screened for Serpinb11 transcripts by PCR using specific primers (forward 1, 5′-GGGTAAAAGTGCAGTTGTGAATATG-3′; reverse 1, 5′-GGAGAAGCAAACTTGCCAGC-3′) (18Askew D.J.

Silverman G.A. Genomics. 2004; 84: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These primers amplified a 554-bp product. As a control for template integrity, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers (Clontech) were used to amplify a 983-bp product. Statistical Analysis—The Student's t test was used to compare the differences between the means of second order rate constants. Identification of a Novel Human Clade B Serpin and Its Mouse Orthologue—To identify novel clade B genomic sequences, we used the BLAST2 algorithm and exon 8 of SERPINB4 to query the human genomic DNA sequence deposited in GenBank™ (25Askew Y.S. Pak S.C. Luke C.J. Askew D.J. Cataltepe S. Mills D.R. Kato H. Lehoczky J. Dewar K. Birren B. Silverman G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49320-49330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This exon was chosen, since it contained the highly conserved hinge region of the RSL (28Hopkins P.C. Carrell R.W. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7650-7657Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and the PROSITE serpin signature motif. A significant match was detected in the DNA sequence from the human 18q21 contig clone RP11-69807 (GenBank™ accession number AP001583). Using a combination of gene prediction programs, a novel serpin gene was identified that had the typical features of clade B serpins, including eight exons and the absence of an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence (4Silverman G.A. Whisstock J.C. Askew D.J. Pak S.C. Luke C. Cataltepe S. Irving J.A. Bird P.I. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 301-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The gene was designated SERPINB11 by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee. The genomic sequence of SERPINB11, however, contained an early termination codon in exon 4. Since this mutation would lead to either a truncated and dysfunctional peptide of 89 residues or an mRNA targeted for decay (29Maquat L.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar, 30Maquat L.E. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1773-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether the reference SERPINB11 in GenBank™ was a pseudogene or a simple sequence variant with a nonsense mutation. We designed oligonucleotide primers encompassing the putative start and stop codons of SERPINB11, and used these reagents to amplify DNA fragments (full-length open reading frame ∼1200 bp) from both lung and prostate first-strand cDNAs. DNA fragments were subcloned into pBluescript or pCR®2.1-TOPO® and analyzed by DNA sequencing. Seven different transcripts were identified; four contained full-length coding sequences that could be distinguished by different combinations of eight different SNPs (designated SERPINB11a, -b, -c, and -d; Fig. 1, A and B), two were splice variants (designated SERPINB11e and -g; Fig. 1B), and one contained a nonse"
https://openalex.org/W2043468024,"Aberrant regulation in the adhesive ability of cancer cells is closely associated with their metastatic activity. In this study, we examine the role of ErbB-2 in regulating the adhesive ability of androgen receptor (AR)-positive human prostate cancer (PCa) cells, the major cell population of PCa. Utilizing different LNCaP and MDA PCa2b cells as model systems, we found that ErbB-2 activity was correlated with PYK2 activity and adhesive ability in those cells. Increased ErbB-2 expression or activity in LNCaP C-33 cells enhanced PYK2 activation and cell adhesion, while the high PYK2 activity and the rapid adhesion of LNCaP C-81 cells were decreased by diminishing ErbB-2 expression or activity. Knockdown studies revealed the predominant role of ErbB-2 in regulating LNCaP C-81 cell adhesion. Coimmunoprecipitation showed that C-81 cells had increased interaction between ErbB-2 and PYK2. Elevated ErbB-2 activity in LNCaP cells correlated with increased ERK/MAPK activity and enhanced adhesive ability, which were abolished by the expression of K457A-PYK2 mutant or the treatment of PD98059, a MEK inhibitor. In summary, our data suggested that ErbB-2, via PYK2-ERK/MAPK, upregulates the adhesive ability of AR-positive human PCa cells."
https://openalex.org/W2086921479,"The Rho family of GTPases has been implicated in the regulation of intracellular vesicle trafficking. Here, we investigated the mechanism underlying the negative regulation of clathrin-mediated endocytosis of cell surface receptors mediated by the Rho family protein Rac1. Contrary to previous reports, only the activated mutant of Rac1, but not other Rho family members including RhoA and Cdc42, suppressed internalization of the transferrin receptor. On the other hand, down-regulation of Rac1 expression by RNA interference resulted in enhanced receptor internalization, suggesting that endogenous Rac1 in fact functions as a negative regulator. We identified a guanine nucleotide exchange factor splice variant designated Ost-III, which contains a unique C-terminal region including an Src homology 3 domain, as a regulator of Rac1 involved in the inhibition of receptor endocytosis. In contrast, other splice variants Ost-I and Ost-II exerted virtually no effect on receptor endocytosis. We also examined subcellular localization of synaptojanin 2, a putative Rac1 effector implicated in negative regulation of receptor endocytosis. Each Ost splice variant induced distinct subcellular localization of synaptojanin 2, depending on Rac1 activation. Furthermore, we isolated γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor-associated protein (GABARAP) as a protein that binds to the C-terminal region of Ost-III. When ectopically expressed, GABARAP was co-localized with Ost-III and potently suppressed the Ost-III-dependent Rac1 activation and the inhibition of receptor endocytosis. Lipid modification of GABARAP was necessary for the suppression of Ost-III. These results are discussed in terms of subcellular region-specific regulation of the Rac1-dependent signaling pathway that negatively regulates clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

Lipid modification of GABARAP was necessary for the suppression of Ost-III. These results are discussed in terms of subcellular region-specific regulation of the Rac1-dependent signaling pathway that negatively regulates clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In eukaryotic cells the continuous uptake of essential nutrients such as iron-laden transferrin and the cholesterol-laden low density lipoprotein is carried out through clathrin-mediated endocytosis of their respective receptors. Additionally, clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the main pathway for internalization of various growth factor receptors. It mediates rapid clearance and down-regulation of activated receptors, thereby regulating the levels of cell surface receptors. The receptor-ligand complex is internalized into a clathrin-coated pit that is formed through the action of the adaptor protein complex AP-2 and a variety of accessory proteins, including AP180, Eps15, amphiphysin, and epsin. Subsequently, clathrin-coated pits pinch off to form clathrin-coated vesicles that are encapsulated by a polygonal clathrin coat and carry concentrated receptor-ligand complexes into the cell. Clathrin-coated vesicle fission is driven by the GTPase dynamin. The coat of clathrin-coated vesicles is removed shortly after the vesicle forms, generating an early endosome. This endosome fuses with a late endosome, where the low pH causes the dissociation of the receptor-ligand complex. A receptor-rich region buds off to form a separate vesicle that recycles the receptor to the plasma membrane (for reviews, see Refs. 1Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. Nature. 2003; 422: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (2977) Google Scholar and 2Marsh M. McMahon H.T. Science. 1999; 285: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Many components of the endocytic machinery, including AP-2, AP180, amphiphysin, epsin, endophilin, and dynamin, have phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI4,5P2) 2The abbreviations used are: PI4,5P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; HA, hemagglutinin; GABARAP, γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor-associated protein; EGF, epidermal growth factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MBP, maltose-binding protein; RNAi, RNA interference; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; WT, wild type. 2The abbreviations used are: PI4,5P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; HA, hemagglutinin; GABARAP, γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor-associated protein; EGF, epidermal growth factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MBP, maltose-binding protein; RNAi, RNA interference; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; WT, wild type. binding domains. The interaction with PI4,5P2 is essential for many aspects of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, including coated pit assembly, clathrin-coated vesicle formation, and their uncoating (3Cremona O. De Camilli P. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1041-1052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphatase synaptojanin 1, which interacts with several clathrin-associated proteins, has an important role in adjusting the inositol lipid composition of membranes. By reducing the PI4,5P2 level, synaptojanin 1 negatively regulates membrane recruitment of dynamin and adaptor proteins, such as AP-2 and AP180, leading to clathrin uncoating. Disruption of the synaptojanin 1 gene resulted in neurological defects and early postnatal death, presumably due to synaptic vesicle recycling disorder (accumulation of clathrin-coated vesicles) in neurons with increased PI4,5P2 levels (4Cremona O. Di Paolo G. Wenk M.R. Luthi A. Kim W.T. Takei K. Daniell L. Nemoto Y. Shears S.B. Flavell R.A. McCormick D.A. De Camilli P. Cell. 1999; 99: 179-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Synaptojanin 2, an isoform of synaptojanin 1, is ubiquitously expressed in contrast to synaptojanin 1, which is highly enriched in the nerve terminus (5Nemoto Y. Arribas M. Haffner C. DeCamilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30817-30821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Possessing a Rac binding domain at its C-terminal portion, synaptojanin 2 has been reported to serve as a specific effector of Rac1 that regulates clathrin-mediated endocytosis (6Malecz N.

Murakami T. Ringstad N. Yamada H. Takei K. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41133-41142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For this function, phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphatase activity seems to be required (6Malecz N. McCabe P.C. Spaargaren C. Qiu R. Chuang Y. Symons M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1383-1386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The GDP/GTP cycle of Rho family GTPases is regulated by Dbl family guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which enhance release of GDP from the protein-GDP complex. The catalytic Dbl homology domain that precedes the adjacent regulatory pleckstrin homology domain is conserved in all 69 Dbl family GEFs. Rho family GTPases are implicated in the regulation of actin cytoskeletal rearrangements and subsequent cellular responses, including cell movement and cell division (8Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3768) Google Scholar). They also regulate gene expression and the production of superoxide (8Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3768) Google Scholar). Considering such diverse physiological functions, Rho family GTPases must be strictly regulated in a subcellular region-specific manner. Activities of Rho family proteins including RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 are indeed spatially coordinated for dynamic regulation of cell adhesion and migration (9Raftopoulou M. Hall A. Dev. Biol. 2004; 265: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). Various Rho family members are also involved in the regulation of intracellular membrane trafficking in eukaryotic cells (10Symons M. Rusk N. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 409-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In particular, roles of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 in endocytic pathways have been well documented. RhoA is reported to be an essential component of a constitutive, presumably clathrin-independent, endocytic pathway in Xenopus oocytes (11Schmalzing G. Richter H.P. Hansen A. Schwarz W. Just I. Aktories K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1319-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Similarly, activated Rac1 causes production of membrane ruffles and associated pinocytic vesicle formation (12Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3041) Google Scholar). In macrophages, Rac1 and Cdc42 mediate immunoglobulin receptor-dependent phagocytosis, whereas RhoA mediates complement receptor-dependent phagocytosis (13Caron E. Hall A. Science. 1998; 28: 1717-1721Crossref Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Cdc42 regulates endocytic transport to the basolateral plasma membrane in polarized epithelial cells (14Kroschewski R. Hall A. Mellman I. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). With regard to clathrin-mediated endocytosis, activated mutants of RhoA and Rac1 were reported to potently inhibit transferrin receptor-mediated endocytosis (15Lamaze C. Chuang T.H. Terlecky L.J. Bokoch G.M. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1996; 382: 177-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). In polarized cells, activated RhoA stimulates the rate of both apical and basolateral endocytosis (16Leung S.M. Rojas R. Maples C. Flynn C. Ruiz W.G. Jou T.S. Apodaca G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4369-4384Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), whereas activated Rac1 inhibits this process (17Jou T.S. Leung S.M. Fung L.M. Ruiz W.G. Nelson W.J. Apodaca G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 287-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). TCL, a Cdc42-related GTPase, on the other side, regulates the entry of endocytosed receptors into early/sorting endosomes (18de Toledo M. Senic-Matuglia F. Salamero J. Uze G. Comunale F. Fort P. Blangy A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4846-4856Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Although the effect of overexpressed active mutants was previously reported, it remains unclear whether endogenous Rac1 indeed acts as a regulator of intracellular membrane trafficking. Moreover, the mechanism whereby upstream signals regulate Rac1 remains totally unknown. As a step toward understanding these issues, we herein examined the effect of down-regulation of Rac1 expression on clathrin-mediated receptor endocytosis. Furthermore, we characterized a GEF and its associating protein as regulators of Rac1 that inhibits receptor endocytosis.

Plasmids were introduced into HeLa cells using the SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Transferrin Incorporation—HeLa cells transfected with expression plasmids were starved in serum-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium for 7 h before transferrin treatment. Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated transferrin (50 μg/ml) was then added to serum-starved HeLa cells. After incubation for the indicated periods of time, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 3.7% (w/v) formaldehyde. Incorporation of transferrin into cells was assessed under confocal laser scanning microscopy as described below. RNA Interference (RNAi)—The small interfering RNA (siRNA) designed from the human Rac1 cDNA sequence (5′-UGGAGAAUAUAUCCCUACUGUCUUU-3′) (RAC1 Validated Stealth RNAi, Invitrogen) was used for down-regulation of Rac1. The control siRNA (catalog number 1022076) was purchased from Qiagen. Cells were transfected with siRNAs (100 nm) using the RNAiFect or TransMessenger transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. pFLAG-CMV2-EGFP, as a transfection marker, was co-introduced with the Rac1 siRNA in some experiments. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Immunofluorescence staining was performed as described (23Ueda S. Kataoka T. Satoh T. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 899-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Images were obtained using a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM510 META, Carl Zeiss) and processed by the Zeiss LSM Image Browser version 3.5. Color conversion was applied in some images to allocate a single color to each epitope. Fluorescence intensity was quantified by NIH ImageJ (Version 1.36). In Situ Detection of Rac1·GTP—HA-tagged Rac1(WT) was expressed in HeLa cells (or HeLa cells transfected with pCMV5-Myc-Ost-III) by the use of an adenoviral expression system (catalog number 6173, Takara Bio, Japan).

Role of Rac1 in Transferrin Receptor Endocytosis—Lamaze et al. (15Lamaze C. Chuang T.H. Terlecky L.J. Bokoch G.M. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1996; 382: 177-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) has shown that the ectopic overexpression of activated forms of RhoA and Rac1 inhibited clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the transferrin receptor. As a first step to understanding the role of Rho family GTPases in clathrin-mediated receptor endocytosis, we also examined the effect of the activated mutants on transferrin receptor endocytosis by detecting the incorporation of fluorescent transferrin (24Sunaguchi M. Nishi M. Mizobe T. Kawata M. Brain Res. 2003; 984: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The activated mutant of Rac1, but not Cdc42, potently inhibited endocytosis of the transferrin receptor (Fig. 1A) as Lamaze et al. (15Lamaze C. Chuang T.H. Terlecky L.J. Bokoch G.M. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1996; 382: 177-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) reported. However, we did not observe any reduction in transferrin receptor endocytosis when activated RhoA was expressed (Fig. 1A). Currently, we do not know the reason for this discrepancy, but our RhoA construct was indeed effective in stress fiber formation in various types of cells (data not shown). Fluorescence intensity per μm2 was quantified, and relative transferrin incorporation compared with vector-transfected cells was illustrated in Fig. 1B. We also observed an inhibitory effect of activated Rac1 but neither RhoA nor Cdc42 on endocytosis of the EGF receptor (data not shown). In addition, we estimated the expression level of the transferrin receptor by immunoblotting, detecting no significant difference among cells harboring Rho family GTPases (data not shown). We then asked whether physiological activation of Rac1 exerts a negative effect like mutationally activated Rac1. EGF is known to induce Rac1 activation in various cell types including HeLa cells (25Yamaguchi K. Hata K. Wada T. Moriya S. Miyagi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 346: 484-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 26Ray R.M. Vaidya R.J. Johnson L.R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2007; 64: 143-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and thus, we examined the effect of EGF pretreatment on transferrin receptor endocytosis. Transferrin receptor endocytosis was in fact inhibited by 30-min pretreatment with EGF (Fig. 1, C and D). Upon EGF treatment, Rac1 activation occurred in both the plasma membrane and the perinuclear region as demonstrated by in situ detection of Rac1·GTP (Fig. 1E). To further confirm the involvement of Rac1, the expression of endogenous Rac1 was abrogated by RNAi, and its effect on EGF-dependent negative regulation of transferrin receptor endocytosis was examined. Rac1 knock-down indeed canceled the effect of EGF, implicating Rac1 as a downstream component (Fig. 1, C and D). Although EGF is a possible extracellular factor that regulates receptor endocytosis via Rac1 as described above, it remains unclear whether Rac1 is indeed responsible for a negative regulation when transferrin receptor endocytosis occurs in response to transferrin stimulation alone. Therefore, we next simply compared transferrin receptor endocytosis after the stimulation with transferrin in control and Rac1 knock-down cells. Incorporation of siRNA was monitored by the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP), and transferrin incorporation in GFP-positive cells was quantified. In Rac1 knock-down cells, transferrin receptor incorporation was significantly enhanced (Fig. 2), suggesting that Rac1-dependent negative regulation also operates downstream of the transferrin receptor itself. Transferrin incorporation upon EGF pretreatment in Rac1 knock-down cells was comparable with that in untreated wild-type cells (Fig. 1D) in contrast to transferrin incorporation in Rac1 knock-down cells without EGF pretreatment, which was increased over twice (Fig. 2B). This difference is presumably due to different assay conditions; fluorescence intensity of transferrin incorporated into GFP-positive cells was quantified in Fig. 2B, whereas in Fig. 1D fluorescence intensity of transferrin in all siRNA-transfected cells was quantified. Nevertheless, it remains possible that EGF suppression of transferrin receptor endocytosis is mediated also by Rac1-independent mechanisms. Characterization of a GEF Responsible for the Activation of Rac1 That Negatively Modulates Receptor Endocytosis—It is believed that signal-transducing GTPases including Rac1 are regulated by GEFs specific to each function in a subcellular region-specific manner. In fact, we previously reported that splice variants of the GEF Ost activate Cdc42 in different subcellular regions, leading to different types of cytoskeletal rearrangements (23Ueda S. Kataoka T. Satoh T. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 899-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown specific coupling of Ost splice variants to receptor-mediated upstream signals (23Ueda S. Kataoka T. Satoh T. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 899-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, to gain insights into the mechanism by which Rac1 is activated to modulate receptor endocytosis, Ost splice variants were compared for their ability to suppress transferrin receptor endocytosis. Ost-II contains the N-terminal SEC14-like domain, whereas Ost-I lacks this domain as previously described (Ref. 23Ueda S. Kataoka T. Satoh T. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 899-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar and Fig. 3A). Another splice variant Ost-III, which has a unique C-terminal sequence containing an Src homology 3 domain, is identical to Ost-γ (Ref. 27Lorenzi M.V. Castagnino P. Chen Q. Hori Y. Miki T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4742-4755Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar and Fig. 3A). When transiently expressed in HeLa cells, Ost-III inhibited transferrin receptor endocytosis-like activated Rac1, whereas the other splice variants Ost-I and Ost-II exhibited virtually no significant effects (Fig. 3, B and C). We also observed Ost-III-specific suppression of EGF receptor endocytosis similarly to the transferrin receptor (data not shown). The C-terminal portion of Ost-III (amino acids 944-1097), which contains the Src homology 3 domain but not Dbl homology and pleckstrin homology domains, was ineffective in suppressing transferrin receptor endocytosis (Fig. 3C). Time course experiments revealed that the rate of transferrin receptor internalization was reduced, but the internalization ultimately reached a maximum after 90 min in Ost-III-expressing cells (Fig. 3D). Most of incorporated transferrin was distributed to the perinuclear region after 120 min in all of Ost-I-, Ost-II-, and Ost-III-expressing cells (data not shown). As a step to clarify the mechanism underlying Ost-III-dependent suppression of receptor endocytosis, subcellular regions wh"
https://openalex.org/W2049705497,"Background At the Manipal College of Medical Sciences, Pokhara, Nepal, Pharmacology is taught during the first four semesters of the undergraduate medical course. Personal or P-drug selection is an important exercise. The present study was carried out to obtain student opinion about the P-drug learning sessions, the assessment examinations, and on the small group dynamics. Method The practical sessions on P-drug selection are carried out in small groups. Student feedback about the session was obtained using focus group discussions. The focus groups were selected to represent both genders and the three main nationalities, Nepalese, Indians, and Sri Lankans. There were four Nepalese, five Indians, and three Sri Lankans. Within each nationality and gender category the students were randomly selected. The respondents were explained the objectives of the study and were invited to participate. Written informed consent was obtained. The discussion lasted around two hours and was conducted in the afternoon in two groups of six students each. The first author (PRS) acted as a facilitator. The responses were recorded and analyzed qualitatively. Results The overall student opinion was positive. Around 25% (3 respondents) of respondents were confused about whether P-drugs were for a disease or a patient. Group consensus was commonly used to give numerical values for the different criteria. The large number of brands created problems in calculating cost. The students wanted more time for the exercise in the examination. Formative assessment during the learning sessions may be considered. The group members usually got along well. Absenteeism was a problem and not all members put in their full effort. The physical working environment should be improved. Conclusions Based on what the students say, the sessions on P-drugs should be continued and strengthened. Modifications in the sessions are required. Sessions during the clinical years and internship training can be considered."
https://openalex.org/W2075420700,"Alternative splicing plays an important role in generating molecular and functional diversity in multi-cellular organisms. RNA binding proteins play crucial roles in modulating splice site choice. The majority of known binding sites for regulatory proteins are short, degenerate consensus sequences that occur frequently throughout the genome. This poses an important challenge to distinguish between functionally relevant sequences and a vast array of those occurring by chance.Here we have used a computational approach that combines a series of biological constraints to identify uridine-rich sequence motifs that are present within relevant biological contexts and thus are potential targets of the Drosophila master sex-switch protein Sex-lethal (SXL). This strategy led to the identification of one novel target. Moreover, our systematic analysis provides a starting point for the molecular and functional characterization of an additional target, which is dependent on SXL activity, either directly or indirectly, for regulation in a germline-specific manner.This approach has successfully identified previously known, new, and potential SXL targets. Our analysis suggests that only a subset of potential SXL sites are regulated by SXL. Finally, this approach should be directly relevant to the large majority of splicing regulatory proteins for which bonafide targets are unknown."
https://openalex.org/W2036712925,"We examined the functional implication of nucleolin in the mouse first molar development. Both the nucleolin mRNA and protein expressions were demonstrated in the odontogenic epithelial cells in the early stage and in the inner enamel epithelial layer in the late stage. The expression pattern of nucleolin corresponded to the proliferating cells in the tooth germ, thus showing that nucleolin could possibly be related to cell proliferation. No in situ signal of nucleolin was found in the primary enamel knot (PEK). Furthermore, nucleolin protein was demonstrated in the PEK by immunohistochemistry. The existence of nucleolin protein in the PEK may possibly be related to the apoptosis in the PEK cells. An inhibition assay using the hemagglutinating virus of Japan-liposome containing nucleolin antisense phosphorothioated oligonucleotide (AS S-ODN) in cultured mouse mandibles at embryonic day (E) 11.0 showed a marked growth inhibition of tooth germ. Moreover, no developmental arrest was found in the cultured tooth germ at E15.0 treated with nucleolin AS S-ODN. Real time PCR was performed to examine the mRNA expression of nucleolin-related genes, and a significant reduction in the midkine mRNA expression was thus observed in the mouse mandible after being treated with nucleolin AS S-ODN. This inhibition assay indicated that nucleolin could thus be involved in the early stage of tooth germ initiation and morphogenesis, possibly by regulating the midkine expression.

Nucleolin is a major nucleolar phosphoprotein that belongs to a large family of RNA-binding proteins (7Bugler B. Bourbon H. Lapeyre B. Wallace M.O. Chang J.H. Amalric F. Olson M.O. J. Biol.

In addition to the many known functions of nucleolin, it may also function as a low affinity receptor of extracellular growth factor on the cell surface (25Said E.A. Krust B. Nisole S. Svab J.

Here we examined the detailed in situ and immunohistochemical expression patterns of nucleolin in developing tooth germ. To further analyze the functional role of nucleolin, mandibles at E11.0 and tooth germs at E15.0 were cultured with nucleolin antisense phosphorothioated oligonucleotide (AS S-ODN) by using the hemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ)-liposome transfection method. We performed a histological analysis and real time PCR to estimate the effect of the nucleolin AS S-ODN on the formation of tooth germ and the mRNA expression of nucleolin-related gene in nucleolin AS S-ODN-treated tissue specimens, respectively. Nucleolin may be involved in the early stage of tooth germ initiation and morphogenesis, possibly by regulating the MK expression. Animals—Embryos of BALB/c mice at 10.5, 11.0, 12.0, 14.0, 15.0, 16.0, 17.0, and 18.0 days after gestation were used in this study. Adult BALB/c mice were obtained from Charles River Japan Inc. (Yokohama, Japan). All mice were bred in an air-conditioned clean room with a 12:12-h light-dark cycle and were provided standard laboratory food and water ab libitum. All manipulations of mice were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Animal Center of Kyushu University. Female BALB/c mice (10–30 weeks) were caged together with male mice. After 3 h, successful insemination was determined based on the presence of a post-copulatory plug in the vagina, and the embryonic day was defined as E0 after such a plug was recognized. In Situ Hybridization—The details of the section preparation, the probe labeling, the specificity of the digoxigenin-labeled in situ RNA probes, and in situ hybridization methods have been shown in our previous studies (4Yamaza H. Matsuo K. Kobayashi I. Wada H. Kiyoshima T. Akhtar M. Ishibashi Y. Sakai T. Akamine A. Sakai H. Histochem. J. 2001; 33: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 5Wada H. Kobayashi I.

Yamaza H. Wada H. Honda J.Y. Ming X. Sakai H. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 124: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Three embryos at each embryonic day were removed from the pregnant mice under ether anesthesia. The removed embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) for 12 h at 4 °C and embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT (Miles Inc., Elkhart, IN). Serial cryosections were cut at a thickness of 8 μm and then were mounted on silane-coated glass slides for in situ hybridization. Murine nucleolin cDNA (GenBank™ accession number AK031606, nucleotides 536–1281) was subcloned into pGEM-3Z vector (Promega, Madison, WI) to synthesize both of the antisense and sense probes. Nucleolin sense probe was also applied to the tissue specimens as a control; however, no hybridization signal was detected (data not shown). Immunohistochemistry and Antibody—For immunohistochemistry, the preparation of serial cryosections was processed in the same way as for in situ hybridization. After the cryosections were dried at room temperature for 1 h, the sections were rinsed with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. To block nonspecific immunoreaction, the sections were incubated with 5% chicken serum (Cosmo Bio Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and 5% donkey serum (Cosmo Bio) in PBS for 30 min, respectively. Next the sections were incubated with the primary antibody against nucleolin (goat polyclonal C23, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), diluted 1:200 in PBS. The sections were washed four times with PBS for 10 min each and incubated with Alexa 568-labeled donkey anti-goat IgG (Invitrogen), diluted 1:2000 in PBS, for 2 h at room temperature. After rinsing with PBS five times in PBS, the sections were incubated with 4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 0.5 μg/ml) (Wako, Osaka, Japan) for 15 min at room temperature. For the negative control, the application of the primary antibody was omitted from the above described procedure. These sections were examined under a fluorescence microscopy Olympus IX71 (OLYMPUS, Tokyo, Japan), and immunofluorescent images were acquired using an Olympus DP70 camera. Double Staining for Nucleolin Immunohistochemistry and TUNEL—The tissue sections were prepared in the same method as mentioned above and double-stained by immunohistochemistry for nucleolin and the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nickend labeling method (TUNEL) for apoptosis using the in situ apoptosis detection kit (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan). Briefly, the sections were treated with the permeabilization buffer for 5 min at 4 °C. To block nonspecific immunoreaction, the sections were preincubated with 5% chicken serum and 5% donkey serum (Cosmo Bio) in PBS for 30 min, respectively, and then incubated with the C23 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, diluted 1:200) for 90 min at room temperature. After washing in PBS, the sections were incubated with the mixture of reaction solution containing the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase and Alexa 568-labeled anti-goat IgG (Invitrogen) for 90 min at 37 °C. The sections were counterstained with DAPI. In a negative control incubated without the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase, no fluorescent products were observed. Quantitative Real Time PCR—Total RNA was isolated from the mandibles removed from E10.5 and E12.0 mouse embryos and 6-day cultured mandible explants using the SV total RNA isolation system (Promega). The cDNA was prepared by a reverse transcription reaction using the SuperScript III first strand synthesis system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Real time PCR was performed in 10 μl of mixture consisting of 5 μl of SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara Bio Inc.) containing TaqDNA polymerase, oligonucleotide primers (0.2 μm each), and 1 μl of template cDNA. The amplification consisted of a two-step procedure as follows: denaturation at 95 °C for 10 s, and 40 cycles with denaturation at 95 °C for 5 s, and then annealing/elongation at 60 °C for 31 s by using ABI PRISM® 7000 sequence detection systems (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene was used as an endogenous control. The primer sequences were designed using the Primer Express software version 1.0 (Applied Biosystems). The gene-specific forward (fw) and reverse (rv) primers for nucleolin and GAPDH were as follows: nucleolin fw, 5′-AAG CAG CAC CTG GAA AAC G-3′, and nucleolin rv, 5′-TCT GAG CCT TCT ACT TTC TGT TTC TTG-3′; GAPDH fw, 5′-GAA CAT CAT CCC TGC ATC CA-3′, and GAPDH rv, 5′-CCA GTG AGC TTC CCG TTC A-3′. Western Blot Analysis—A Western blot analysis for the nucleolin level was performed from the cytosolic fraction of the homogenate of E10.5 and E12.0 mandibles and 6-day cultured mandible explants. The tissue specimens were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS), supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (50 μm), lactacystin (20 μm), β-glycerophosphate (25 mm), and sodium orthovanadate (1 mm). Protein samples (20 μg) were separated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to Immun-Blot® polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was probed with antibody C23 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) against nucleolin for 1 h at room temperature, and incubated for 1 h with secondary rabbit anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Biosciences). Emitted light was detected using a cooled CCD camera (LAS-1000, Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). Preparation of S-ODN—The HVJ-liposomes were prepared as described elsewhere (26Saeki Y. Kaneda Y. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 1997; (Celis, J. E., ed) 2nd Ed., pp. , Academic Press, San Diego: 123-130Google Scholar, 27Kaneda Y. Uchida T. Kim J. Ishiura M. Okada Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 173: 56-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In brief, egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (Sigma), cholesterol (Sigma), and bovine brain phosphatidylserine (Sigma) were each dissolved in chloroform, mixed in a weight ratio of 1:2:4.8, and then dried with a rotary evaporator (Eyela, Tokyo, Japan). Purified HVJ (kindly donated by Professor Katsuo Sueishi, Kyushu University) adjusted to 15,000 hemagglutinating units/ml was inactivated by ultraviolet light. Thereafter, 10 mg of liposomes mixture was fused with 1 ml of HVJ and 20 nmol of S-ODNs in 6 ml of balanced salt solution (140 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). HVJ-liposome complex was collected by centrifugation for use. The concentration of S-ODNs was adjusted to 0.2 mm by measuring absorbance of HVJ-liposome containing S-ODNs (27Kaneda Y. Uchida T. Kim J. Ishiura M. Okada Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 173: 56-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Translation Arrest by Nucleolin AS S-ODN and Organ Culture—For the translation arrest of nucleolin, we designed AS S-ODN as 5′-CTC GGA AGA GCT CAG CGG AA-3′ corresponding to nucleotides 118–137 of murine nucleolin (GenBank™ accession number AK031606). The corresponding sense (SE) S-ODN (5′-TTC CGC TGA GCT CTT CCG AG-3′) and random sequence (RS) S-ODN (5′-AGT CGA CGC AAG TGC GCG AA-3′) were used for the control experiments. The protocol for the organ culture of the tooth germs was almost identical to that used in our previous studies (28Kobayashi I. Kiyoshima T. Wada H. Matsuo K. Nonaka K. Honda J.Y. Koyano K. Sakai H. Bone (NY). 2006; 38: 836-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, the mandibles and tooth germs of the lower first molar were dissected out from E11.0 and E15.0 embryos, respectively. These explants were supported by a filter (0.8 μm pore size, Millipore, MA) mounted on metal mesh, and then were incubated in the Fitton-Jackson’s modified BGJb medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Filtron, Brooklyn, Australia), 100 μg/ml ascorbic acid (Invitrogen), and 100 unit/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C (29Slavkin H. Nuckolls G. Shum L. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 136: 45-54PubMed Google Scholar). The final concentration used in the culture medium included 1.25 μm for each ODN, 2.4 mg/ml for the HVJ-liposome complex, and 1 mm CaCl2. The culture media containing HVJ-liposome S-ODNs were changed every 24 h. Tissue Preparation and Histological Analysis of Cultured Explants—The cultured mandibles and tooth germs were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 12 h at 4 °C at the 2nd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 10th day after cultivation. At least three (up to 14) mandibles and tooth germs explants were used on each culture day for histological analysis. Five-μm-thick sections were cut in an antero-posterior direction, and hematoxylin and eosin double staining was then performed, and the sections were examined under light microscopy. Measurement of Nucleolin Suppression and Statistical Analysis—The effect of the AS S-ODNs on blocking the translation of nucleolin was confirmed by real time PCR and Western blot analysis. Each experiment was performed independently three times. The density for the blotting signals was measured using NIH Image software version 1.37. Unpaired Student’s t test was used to determine the significance of differences. Differences with a probability value of less than 0.05 were considered to be significant. Effects of Nucleolin Suppression on Gene Transcription—Real time PCR was performed to estimate the subsequent expression of selected genes after nucleolin transcription was arrested in 6-day cultured E11.0 mandibles. The following primers were used in the present study: MK fw, 5′-CTC TCC CAC AGG CCC AAG A-3′, and MK rv, 5′-AGG ACA GGC GTG ATT GAC AGA-3′; CKII fw, 5′-CAA TAT GAT GTC AGG GAT TTC TTC A-3′, and CKII rv, 5′-GTT GGC AGC GGC AAT CAC-3′; histone H1 fw, 5′-TGG GTG AGA ACG CCA ACT C-3′, and histone H1 rv, 5′-ACC CCT TTG GTT TGC TTG AGA-3′; nucleophosmin fw, 5′-GAA CAG GAG GCA GTT GTT TTC C-3′, amd nucleophosmin rv, 5′-GTC CAT ATC CAT CGA GTC TTC CA-3′; p53 fw, 5′-CAC TGC ATG GAC GAT CTG TTG-3′, and p53 rv, 5′-CAC TCG GAG GGC TTC ACT TG-3′; PP1 fw, 5′-GCT GGG AGT GAG CGT CTT CT-3′, and PP1 rv, 5′-TCC ACC ACG ATC TGA GTT ACG T-3′; c-Myb fw, 5′-ATG CCA AAT GGA GAA ATG TGT TC-3′, and c-Myb rv, 5′-TCT ATT GCC CCC TGA CAC AAG-3′. Quantitative real time PCR was also performed to estimate the expressions of amelogenin (AMGN), ameloblastin (AMBN), dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP), and dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP-1) after nucleolin transcription was arrested in 6-day cultured E11.0 mandibles. The following primers were used in this study: AMGN fw, CCC CTG TCC CCA TTC TT, and AMGN rv, ACT TCT TCC CGC TTG GTC TTG; AMBN fw, TGC AGG AAG GAG AGC TGA TAG C, and AMBN rv, CAG GTG TTG GTG GGT TTT CG; DSPP fw, TGG GCA TGA CAG TTA CGA GTT C, and DSPP rv, TTT CGT CAC TTC CGT TAG ATT CG; DMP1 fw, TGC TCT CCC AGT TGC CAG AT, and DMP1 rv, GGT GAC CCA GCC AAA TCA TC. Different Expression of Nucleolin between E10.5 and E12.0—Real time PCR and Western blotting analyses were performed to estimate the different expression of nucleolin between the mandibles at E10.5 and at E12.0. The expression of nucleolin was 2.6-fold higher for mRNA (p < 0.01) and 1.8-fold higher for protein (p < 0.01) in the mandible at E10.5 than in the mandible at E12.0, and the difference was confirmed to be significant (Fig. 1, A–C). Expression of Nucleolin mRNA and Protein during Odontogenesis—Membrane hybridization was carried out to confirm the specificity of the digoxigenin-labeled in situ RNA probes. The details of the assay have been described in our previous study (6Akhter M. Kobayashi I. Kiyoshima T. Matsuo K. Yamaza H. Wada H. Honda J.Y. Ming X. Sakai H. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 124: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The binding activity of antisense nucleolin probe to sense nucleolin probe was inhibited when an excessive unlabeled sense or antisense probe was added to the reaction mixture (data not shown). The expression of nucleolin mRNA and protein in the lower first molar were analyzed by in situ hybridization (Fig. 2A) and immunohistochemical method (Fig. 2B) from the initiation stage (E10.5) to the bell stage (E18.0) in a series of serial sections. Other special terms in the developmental stages of tooth germ have been referred to in previous studies (3Yamaza H. Matsuo K. Kiyoshima T. Shigemura N. Kobayashi I. Wada H. Akamime A. Sakai H. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2001; 45: 675-680PubMed Google Scholar, 4Yamaza H. Matsuo K. Kobayashi I. Wada H. Kiyoshima T. Akhtar M. Ishibashi Y. Sakai T. Akamine A. Sakai H. Histochem.

Cell Biol. 2005; 124: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). At the initiation stage of E10.5, the expression of nucleolin mRNA was observed in the oral epithelium and mesenchyme at the site where the presumptive molar tooth germ was estimated to be formed. At E12.0, both nucleolin in situ signal and immunofluorescence were detected in the thickening oral epithelium. At the bud stage of E14.0, the expression of nucleolin mRNA and protein was mainly detected in the epithelial cells of the tooth bud. The immunolocalization of nucleolin was demonstrated in the whole enamel organ at the cap stage of E15.0, but no in situ signal was found in the primary enamel knot (PEK). The immunofluorescence reaction of nucleolin protein was observed in the cytoplasm and nucleus as a dot-like appearance (Fig. 2C). At the early bell stage of E16.0, in situ signal and immunofluorescence staining patterns were presented in the inner enamel epithelium, cervical loop, and in part of the outer enamel epithelial cells. The in situ signal and staining patterns of immunofluorescence were restricted in the inner enamel epithelial cells at the subsequent E17.0 and E18.0 (Fig. 2, A and B). The expression of mRNA thus generally coincided with that of protein. In particular, both mRNA and protein were concomitantly expressed in the early bud stage of E12.0 and the bell stage at E16.0–E18.0 during tooth germ development. However, several differences were also detected in the expression patterns between mRNA and protein. At the bud stage of E14.0, the expression intensity of protein in the dental papilla appeared stronger than that of mRNA. The expression of mRNA was absent in the PEK in the tooth germ at E15.0; meanwhile, a strong expression of immunoreaction was found in this structure. Double staining for nucleolin protein and TUNEL showed that the fluorescence images of nucleolin and apoptosis were not merged (Fig. 2D). Arrest of Nucleolin Translation by AS S-ODN—Based on the in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry results for nucleolin, we examined the role of nucleolin in early tooth germ development and in tooth mineralization at the later stage using AS S-ODN in the cultured mandible at E11.0 and tooth germ at E15.0, respectively. Real time PCR was performed to examine the effect of nucleolin AS S-ODN on mouse E11.0 mandible explants cultured for 6 days by using HVJ-liposome transfection method. After performing a statistical analysis for the nucleolin expressions, more than 30% reduction of nucleolin mRNA expression (Fig. 3A) and 70% reduction of nucleolin protein (Fig. 3, C and D) were found in the nucleolin AS S-ODN-treated samples in comparison with control explants cultured with nucleolin SE or RS S-ODN (Fig. 3A). Regarding the toxicity assay, no significant difference of nucleolin mRNA expression was detected between control samples cultured without ODN and samples cultured with HVJ-liposome containing SE S-ODN, RS S-ODN, or HVJ-liposome only (Fig. 3B). Arrest of Tooth Germ Development by the Nucleolin AS S-ODN in E11.0 Mandible Culture—Preliminary experiments of organ culture for mandibles showed normal development of tooth germ to the cap stage by the 8th day of culture. However, no further development of the tooth germ was observed after the 8th day (supplemental Fig. 1A). The mandible explants removed from E11.0 mouse embryos were used and cultured with nucleolin SE S-ODN, RS S-ODN, or without ODNs as controls. After culturing for 8 days, the morphogenesis of the enamel organ could be detected, and most of enamel organs showed normal cap-like tooth germ (Fig. 4, A and B). However, no morphogenesis of the enamel organ was observed in the mandible treated with AS S-ODN (Fig. 4A). During the first 4 days of culture, the tooth germs in the E11.0 mandibles treated with AS S-ODN showed a normal bud-like structure as similar to the ODN-untreated tooth germs (Fig. 4A). At 4, 6, and 8 days of culture, the tooth germ in the ODN-untreated mandibles further developed (Fig. 4A), thus demonstrating features of the early and late cap stage. On the other hand, although the bud-like tooth germ treated with AS S-ODN had increased in size at day 6 (Fig. 4A), the epithelial buds were smaller than those treated without ODN (Fig. 4A). The epithelial bud at 8 days cultured and treated with AS S-ODN showed a similar size in comparison with 6 days of treatment with AS S-ODN and after 4 days without the ODN treatment (Fig. 4A). Almost all of the tooth germs in the mandible treated with AS S-ODN did not show differentiation into the early cap stage (p < 0.05; Table 1). However, some (15%) of the tooth bud developed an early cap stage similar to that in the control mandibles.TABLE 1The effects of AS S-ODN on the enamel organ development in cultured mandible Development of enamel organs at day 8 of culture was significantly inhibited.StagesUntreatedASaValues are p < 0.05SERSBudCapBudCapBudCapBudCapSample no.2 (14%)12 (86%)11 (85%)2 (15%)2 (25%)6 (75%)2 (33%)4 (67%)a Values are p < 0.05 Open table in a new tab No Effect of Nucleolin AS S-ODN on the Differentiation of Enamel Organ Cells in E15.0 Tooth Germ Culture—Tooth germs were removed micro-surgically from E"
https://openalex.org/W2034512155,"StarD10 is a dual specificity lipid transfer protein capable of shuttling phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine between membranes in vitro. We now provide evidence that, in vivo, StarD10 is phosphorylated on serine 284. This novel phosphorylation site was identified by tandem mass spectrometry of immunoaffinity-purified StarD10 from lysates of HEK293T cells transiently expressing the protein. In vitro kinase assays revealed that casein kinase II was capable of phosphorylating wild-type StarD10 but not a S284A mutant protein. Interestingly, hypotonic extracts prepared from HEK293T cells expressing the serine to alanine mutant exhibited increased lipid transfer activity compared with those from wild-type StarD10-expressing cells, suggesting that, in a cellular context, phosphorylation on serine 284 negatively regulates StarD10 activity. Because casein kinase II phosphorylation also inhibited lipid transfer activity of the purified recombinant StarD10 protein, inhibition is not dependent on any cellular cofactors. Instead, our data show that C-terminal StarD10 phosphorylation on serine 284 regulates its association with cellular membranes.

Lipids are essential for the structural and functional integrity of cells. As the predominant constituent of cellular membranes, lipids compartmentalize cellular functions, are critical for protein sorting, and are involved in various aspects of signal transduction. Lipids are differentially distributed both between and within membranes in the cell. This differential distribution of lipids is achieved in part by regulated transport of lipids (1Sprong H. van der Sluijs P. van Meer G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 504-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 2Holthuis J.C. Levine T.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Phospholipids are predominantly synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 3The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CKII, casein kinase II; StAR, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein; START, StAR-related lipid transfer; PC, phosphatidylcholine; Pctp, phosphatidylcholine transfer protein; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PITP, phosphatidylinositol transfer protein; StarD10, START-domain-containing 10; MLVs, multilamellar vesicles; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein. 3The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CKII, casein kinase II; StAR, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein; START, StAR-related lipid transfer; PC, phosphatidylcholine; Pctp, phosphatidylcholine transfer protein; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PITP, phosphatidylinositol transfer protein; StarD10, START-domain-containing 10; MLVs, multilamellar vesicles; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein. and subsequently transported to various destinations by vesicular transport. Lipids can also be delivered to specific cellular organelles by monomeric exchange. This non-vesicular lipid trafficking can be highly efficient and requires desorption of the lipid from the donor membrane, passage through the aqueous phase, and subsequent insertion into the acceptor membrane. Spontaneous release from the membrane into the aqueous phase is a rare event for phospholipids carrying two long acyl chains. Several cytosolic proteins with specific lipid binding domains capable of accelerating lipid exchange in vitro have been identified. These proteins include phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins (PITPs), sterol carrier protein 2, and members of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR)-related lipid transfer (START) domain family (3Wirtz K.W. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 5436-5441Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). START domains have been identified in 15 mammalian proteins, which have been assigned the formal names StarD1–15, and are also found in plants, worms, flies, fish, and bacteria (4Soccio R.E. Breslow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22183-22186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 5Alpy F. Tomasetto C. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2791-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). START domains are ∼210 amino acids in length and form a hydrophobic tunnel that accommodates a monomeric lipid. The founding member of the START family, StAR/StarD1, is essential for cholesterol transport to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone takes place (6Strauss J.F. II I Kishida T. Christenson L.K. Fujimoto T. Hiroi H. Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 2003; 202: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylcholine transfer protein (Pctp/StarD2), on the other hand, is known to bind and transfer phosphatidylcholine (PC) between membranes, but no other phospholipids or sterols. The StarD2 subfamily of START proteins further comprises CERT/StarD11, StarD10, and StarD7. CERT was identified to catalyze the non-vesicular transport of ceramide from the ER to the Golgi (7Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). To fulfill its ceramide carrier function CERT contains two membrane-targeting domains: one for ER and another for Golgi targeting (7Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 8Loewen C.J. Roy A. Levine T.P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2025-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The protein is thought to either shuttle between the two organelles or act directly between closely opposed donor and acceptor membranes at so-called membrane contact sites (9Voelker D.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 396-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 10Levine T. Loewen C. Curr. Opin.

Based on the enrichment of Pctp in liver and the observation that activity in vitro is stimulated by bile salts, it has been postulated that Pctp functions in the delivery of PC from its principal site of synthesis in the ER to hepatocyte canalicular membranes for secretion into bile. However, mice carrying a deletion in the gene encoding Pctp were phenotypically normal (11van Helvoort A. de Brouwer A. Ottenhoff R. Brouwers J.F. Wijnholds J. Beijnen J.H. Rijneveld A. van der P.T. van der Valk M.A. Majoor D. Voorhout W. Wirtz K.W. Elferink R.P. Borst P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11501-11506Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This may be due to functional redundancy with StarD10, which is also expressed in liver and possesses lipid transfer activity for PC and, to a lesser extent, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). We have previously shown by electron spin resonance measurement of spin-labeled lipids and using fluorescently labeled lipids analogs incorporated into liposomes that recombinant StarD10 interacts with phospholipids in solution and in membranes. Incubation of StarD10 with liposomes prepared with radiolabeled cellular lipids demonstrated that StarD10 also binds endogenous PC and PE. StarD10 was further shown to bind lipids in vivo by cross-linking of protein expressed in transfected HEK293T cells with photoactivable PC (12Olayioye M.A. Vehring S. Muller P. Herrmann A. Schiller J. Thiele C. Lindeman G.J. Visvader J.E. Pomorski T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27436-27442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms, however, that control StarD10 lipid binding and transfer activity are still unknown. Opposed to CERT, StarD10 lacks specific targeting motifs and potential donor and acceptor membranes within the cell still remain elusive. Here we present data that shed light onto the in vivo regulation of StarD10. StarD10 is phosphorylated by casein kinase II (CKII) on serine 284, whereby lipid transfer activity and membrane association are inhibited. C-terminal phosphorylation thus appears to represent an efficient means to regulate StarD10 activity. Reagents and Antibodies—Porcine brain lipids (total extract) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL), pyrene-labeled phospholipids 1-hexadecanoyl-1-(1-pyrenedecanoyl)-sn-glycero-3-PC and -PE were from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands), 2,4,6-trinitrophenyl-PE, kindly provided by P. Somerharju (University of Helsinki), was prepared as described (13Gordesky S.E. Marinetti G.V. Segel G.B. J. Membr. Biol. 1973; 14: 229-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Antibodies used were: mouse anti-FLAG and anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich) and mouse anti-transferrin receptor monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen). Affinity-purified StarD10 peptide antiserum has been described previously (14Olayioye M.A. Hoffmann P. Pomorski T. Armes J. Simpson R.J. Kemp B.E. Lindeman G.J. Visvader J.E. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3538-3544Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Peroxidase-labeled secondary anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG antibodies were from Amersham Biosciences; alkaline phosphatase-labeled secondary anti-mouse IgG antibody was from Sigma. Cell Culture, Expression Constructs, and Transfection—HEK293T cells were grown in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells were transfected using TransIT293 reagent (Mirus) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cloning of pEFrPGKpuro-FLAG-StarD10 has been described previously (14Olayioye M.A. Hoffmann P. Pomorski T. Armes J. Simpson R.J. Kemp B.E. Lindeman G.J. Visvader J.E. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3538-3544Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The full-length StarD10 cDNA was subcloned into the pEGFPC1 vector (Invitrogen). The cDNA encoding StarD10-Δ8 was generated by PCR amplification, and point mutants of StarD10 were generated by QuikChange site-directed PCR mutagenesis following the manufacturer’s instructions (Stratagene) and verified by sequencing. Immunoaffinity Purification of StarD10, Two-dimensional PAGE, and Mass Spectrometry—HEK293T cells transiently expressing FLAG-tagged StarD10 were lysed in NEB (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 20 mm β-glycerophosphate plus Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)), and lysates were clarified by centrifugation before passing over anti-FLAG M2 immunoaffinity resin (Sigma). The resin was washed with NEB, followed by washes with phosphate-buffered saline. FLAG-StarD10 was eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, and fractions were neutralized with 1/10 volume of 1 m Tris, pH 8. Fractions containing StarD10 as determined by Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibody were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration using Amicon Ultra-4 columns (10,000 NMWL, Millipore). The concentrated samples was subjected to two-dimensional SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Phast Blue as described (15Verhagen A.M. Ekert P.G. Pakusch M. Silke J. Connolly L.M. Reid G.E. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. Vaux D.L. Cell. 2000; 102: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1969) Google Scholar). For mass spectrometry analysis, the protein was subjected to one-dimensional SDS-PAGE and the band corresponding to StarD10 was excised from the gel and destained with 50 mm NH4HCO3/acetonitrile (1:1 by vol.). Cysteines were first reduced with 1,4-dithio-dl-threitol and then alkylated with iodoacetamide. The protein was in-gel-digested with modified porcine trypsin, the digest was stopped with formic acid, and peptides were extracted with 50 μl of 25 mm NH4HCO3 for 30 min in an ultrasonic bath. The supernatant was recovered, and extraction was repeated with 50 μl of acetonitrile, followed by 50 μl of 5% formic acid, and, finally, 50 μl of acetonitrile. All supernatants were combined, vacuum-dried, and resuspended in 10 μl of 5% formic acid. Phosphopeptides were enriched with the SwellGel® gallium-chelated disc (Phosphopeptide Isolation Kit, Pierce) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Eluates were vacuum-concentrated and resuspended in 10 μl of 5% formic acid. The sample was then desalted on a Zip Tip® μ-C18 (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and eluted stepwise into nanospray capillaries (MDS Proteomics, Odense, Denmark) with 20%, 40%, and 60% aqueous methanol containing 5% formic acid. A QSTAR Pulsar i quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystem, MDS Sciex, Toronto, Canada) equipped with a nano-electrospray ion source (MDS Proteomics) was used. Time-of-flight mass spectrometry spectra were collected in the “enhance all” modus, and charged ions of peptides were chosen manually for product ion analysis. Product ion spectra (tandem mass spectrometry) were acquired with collision energies optimized for each peptide to obtain an effective fragmentation pattern with 10% intensity of the residual precursor ion. Argon was used as the collision gas at a recorded pressure of 4.3 × 10–5 Torr. Data were searched by the tandem mass spectrum data base matching tool Mascot. The NCBInr and SwissProt databases were searched with the variable modifications deamidation, oxidation of methionine, cabarmidomethylation of cysteine and phosphorylation of serine and threonine. Recombinant Protein Production—cDNAs encoding StarD10 wild-type, StarD10-S284A, and StarD10-Δ8 were cloned into pGEX-6P (Amersham Biosciences) and transformed into BL21 bacteria to produce glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. Expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h at 30 °C. Bacteria were harvested and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 50 μg/ml lysozyme, Complete protease inhibitors, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, followed by sonication. GST-StarD10 was purified from clarified lysate with glutathione resin and cleaved with PreScission protease according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Amersham Biosciences). The purity of protein preparations was verified by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Cell Fractionation and Western Blotting—Cells were harvested in hypotonic buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing Complete protease inhibitors, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 5 mm sodium fluoride) and sheared by passage through a 25-gauge/16-mm needle. Nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 500 × g and the cytosol (S) and membrane fraction (P) were obtained by 100,000 × g centrifugation. 5% of the cytosol and 50% of the membrane fraction were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Roth). Immunodetection of StarD10 was performed by blocking membranes with 0.5% blocking reagent (Roche Applied Science) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, followed by incubation with FLAG-, transferrin receptor-, and tubulin-specific antibodies in blocking buffer. Proteins were visualized with peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Pierce). Immunoprecipitation and Kinase Assays—Cells were lysed in NEB (see above), and lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min. Equal amounts of protein were incubated with anti-FLAG antibody for 2 h on ice. Immune complexes were collected with protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare), washed three times with NEB, and twice with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl) before incubation with 5 units of calf intestinal phosphatase (Fermentas) for 45 min at 37 °C. Dephosphorylated immunoprecipitates were again washed with NEB, followed by two washes with kinase buffer before incubation with 10 ng of purified CKII (from B. Luöscher) in the presence of 25 μm cold ATP and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at 37 °C. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto membrane, and analyzed on a Phosphor-Imager (Amersham Biosciences), followed by Western blotting with StarD10-specific antibody. In the case of recombinant proteins used for lipid transfer assays, 40 μg of protein was incubated with 500 units of CKII (Calbiochem) in kinase buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl) in the presence of 200 μm ATP for 2 h at 30 °C. Lipid Transfer Assays—HEK293T cells transiently expressing GFP-tagged StarD10 variants were harvested in hypotonic buffer (see above). The cytosol fraction was obtained after 100,000 × g centrifugation for 1 h, and the amount of expressed protein was quantified by measuring GFP peak emission at 480–550 nm (excitation, 466 nm). Protein-mediated transfer of PC between small unilamellar vesicles was measured as described previously (12Olayioye M.A. Vehring S. Muller P. Herrmann A. Schiller J. Thiele C. Lindeman G.J. Visvader J.E. Pomorski T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27436-27442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The transfer assay mixture contained donor vesicles (1 μmol of lipid/ml) composed of porcine brain lipids (Avanti Polar Lipids), pyrene-labeled PC and 2,4,6-trinitrophenyl-PE (88.6:0.4:11 mol%), and a 10-fold excess of acceptor vesicles composed of porcine brain lipids. Fluorescence intensity was recorded at 395 nm (excitation, 345 nm; slit widths, 4 nm) before and after the addition of 90 μg of cytosol from HEK293T cells transiently expressing the individual proteins (see above). Fluorescence intensities were normalized to (i) the maximum intensity obtained after the addition of Triton X-100 (0.5% final concentration) and (ii) the maximum GFP fluorescence, to account for different protein expression levels. Membrane Flotation Assays—Multilamellar vesicles (MLVs, concentration = 1mm) were generated by resuspension of dried brain lipids in buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 5 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl). MLVs (100 μl) were incubated with 50 μl of recombinant StarD10 proteins (20 μg) for 10 min at 37 °C. The suspension was adjusted to 30% (w/v) sucrose by addition of 100 μl of 75% (w/v) sucrose, overlaid with 200 μl of 25% (w/v) sucrose in buffer, and 50 μl of sucrose-free buffer. Samples were centrifuged at 240,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C in a TLS-55 rotor. The bottom (250 μl) and top (100 μl) fractions were collected, and 5-μl aliquots were analyzed by immunoblotting. Phosphorylation of Human StarD10 on Serine 284—Phosphorylation of proteins is a common post-translational modification to regulate protein-protein interactions, protein localization, or enzymatic activity by inducing conformational changes. We originally identified StarD10 as a phosphoprotein based on its cross-reactivity with a phosphospecific antibody and mapped serine 259 to be phosphorylated and provide a specific antibody recognition site (14Olayioye M.A. Hoffmann P. Pomorski T. Armes J. Simpson R.J. Kemp B.E. Lindeman G.J. Visvader J.E. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3538-3544Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 16Hoffmann P. Olayioye M.A. Moritz R.L. Lindeman G.J. Visvader J.E. Simpson R.J. Kemp B.E. Electrophoresis. 2005; 26: 1029-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). When we further analyzed StarD10 by two-dimensional-PAGE in lysates from HEK293T cells transiently expressing the protein, we noted three StarD10-specific spots of different pI values (Fig. 1A). Such pI shifts are indicative of differential phosphorylation and suggested that at least one additional phosphorylation site existed in StarD10. To map potential phosphorylation sites in StarD10, we affinity-purified the protein and subjected it to analysis by tandem mass spectrometry. Specific enrichment of phosphopeptides was achieved by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography with gallium(III) ions. The molecular mass of the [M+2H]2+ ion shown in Fig. 1B corresponds to the singly phosphorylated, methionine-oxidized C-terminal tryptic peptide T38. The fragmentation pattern of the [M+2H]2+ ion showed y-ion series up to y7, ruling out phosphorylation of threonine 288, serine 289, and threonine 291. The fragmentation spectrum of the [M+2H]2+ ion obtained a high score in a Mascot search, and the loss of 49 Da from the [M+2H]2+ ion further suggested that serine 284 was phosphorylated. CKII Phosphorylates StarD10 on Serine 284—Serine 284 is located within an amino acid stretch containing several negatively charged residues, motifs that are typically recognized by CKII, the minimal consensus sequence being (S/T)XX(D/E) (see Fig. 3A). To investigate whether CKII was capable of phosphorylating StarD10 we first performed an in vitro kinase assay with recombinant StarD10 protein from Escherichia coli that is not phosphorylated as determined by mass spectrometry (data not shown). Indeed, addition of purified CKII to the kinase reaction resulted in robust phosphorylation of StarD10 that was not seen in the absence of CKII (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4). To analyze whether this phosphorylation occurred on serine 284, the wild-type protein and a serine-to-alanine exchange mutant were transiently expressed in HEK293T cells and immunoprecipitated from cell lysates. Incubation with CKII in the presence of radiolabeled ATP led to incorporation phosphate in the case of the wild-type protein but was not seen for the mutant (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2). This provides evidence that CKII is capable of phosphorylating StarD10 on a single residue, namely serine 284. The fact that CKII phosphorylation of StarD10 immunoprecipitated from cell lysates required prior protein dephosphorylation with alkaline phosphatase indicates a high stoichiometry of phosphorylation on serine 284.FIGURE 2In vitro phosphorylation of StarD10 by CKII. Ectopically expressed FLAG-tagged wild-type and S284A StarD10 were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody from HEK293T cell lysates and treated with alkaline phosphatase (lanes 1 and 2). Dephosphorylated immunoprecipitates and, in lanes 3 and 4, recombinant StarD10 were subjected to an in vitro kinase assay with purified CKII and radiolabeled [γ-32P]ATP, followed by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to membrane and analyzed by PhosphorImager, and then immunoblotted with a StarD10-specific antibody to verify equal loading. WB, Western blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Serine 284 Phosphorylation Regulates StarD10 Lipid Transfer Activity—StarD10 functions as a lipid transfer protein specific for PC and PE. We therefore investigated whether StarD10 phosphorylation on serine 284 affected its phospholipid transfer activity. To this end, GFP fusions of StarD10 wild-type and the S284A mutant were transiently expressed in HEK239T cells, and the cytosol fraction was analyzed for PC-specific lipid transfer activity using a fluorescence resonance energy-based assay. Small unilamellar vesicles were prepared containing pyrene-labeled PC as a fluorescent donor and quenching amounts of head group-labeled 2,4,6-trinitrophenyl-PE (12Olayioye M.A. Vehring S. Muller P. Herrmann A. Schiller J. Thiele C. Lindeman G.J. Visvader J.E. Pomorski T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27436-27442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 17Somerharju P.J. Kasurinen J. Wirtz K.W. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). When these donor liposomes were mixed with an excess of unlabeled acceptor liposomes, the increase in pyrene fluorescence was negligible, indicating minimal spontaneous transfer (data not shown). Upon addition of StarD10-containing cytosol, a steady increase in fluorescence was noted compared with control cytosol of vector-transfected cells (Fig. 3B). Compared with the wild-type protein, cytosol containing StarD10-S284A promoted a more rapid increase in pyrene fluorescence. Interestingly, a truncated variant of StarD10 at residue 283, lacking the last 8 C-terminal amino acids (StarD10-Δ8, Fig. 3A), displayed even higher lipid transfer activity. Similar results were obtained with pyrene-labeled PE as a fluorescence donor (data not shown). Estimation of initial transfer rates revealed that the phosphorylation-defective mutant was 2-fold, and the truncated protein 3.5-fold more active than the wild-type protein (Fig. 3C). These data suggest that StarD10 phosphorylation on serine 284 and the C terminus in general inhibits StarD10 lipid transfer activity. Regulation of Lipid Transfer by Serine 284 Phosphorylation Does Not Require Cellular Cofactors—Serine/threonine phosphorylation often generates recognition sites for proteins containing specific phosphoserine-/threonine-binding domains and may thus be involved in protein complex formation. To address the question whether inhibition of StarD10 lipid transfer activity in response to CKII phosphorylation may be dependent upon cellular cofactors, we made use of recombinant StarD10 purified from E. coli, which is not post-translationally modified. Recombinant StarD10 was incubated in kinase buffer containing ATP in the presence and absence of CKII. Phosphorylation of the protein on serine 284 was found to be highly efficient, as the unphosphorylated tryptic peptide was no longer detected by mass spectrometry (data not shown). When in vitro PC transfer of the phosphorylated protein was assessed, its activity was found to be diminished 2-fold compared with that of the unphosphorylated protein (Fig. 4, A and B). CKII incubation of recombinant StarD10 in which serine 284 was exchanged to an alanine did not alter lipid transfer activity (Fig. 4B), proving that inhibition of lipid transfer was indeed due to phosphorylation on this site. In accordance with the data obtained with StarD10 variants expressed in mammalian cells, the recombinant StarD10-Δ8 protein also displayed greater transfer activity. Taken together, these data provide evidence for a protein-intrinsic effect of phosphorylation on StarD10 activity. StarD10 C Terminus Regulates Membrane Association—Enhanced lipid transfer activity of StarD10 variants lacking negative charge, either due to dephosphorylation or deletion of C-terminal acidic residues, could perhaps affect their affinity for membranes, facilitating lipid uptake from donor and release into acceptor membranes. To analyze whether the C terminus of StarD10 is involved in membrane association, we generated multilamellar vesicles composed of porcine brain lipids and incubated these with recombinant StarD10 wild-type and StarD10-Δ8 protein. MLV-associated protein was separated from unbound protein by sucrose gradient centrifugation and analyzed by immunoblotting. Compared with wild-type StarD10, relatively more StarD10-Δ8 protein was recovered in the top MLV-containing fraction, suggesting increased affinity for membranes (Fig. 5A). This finding was confirmed by fractionation of HEK293T transiently expressing StarD10 wild-type, StarD10-S284A, and StarD10-Δ8 variants (Fig. 5B). Only a small proportion of the wild-type protein was recovered in the pellet fraction, whereas S284A and especially the truncated protein were enriched in this fraction. The purity of the individual fractions was confirmed by detection of the transferrin receptor in the membrane and tubulin in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 5B). Association with cellular membranes was further quantified by measuring GFP peak emission before and after 100,000 × g centrifugation of cell lysates transiently expressing GFP fusions of StarD10 variants (Fig. 5C). Thus, phosphorylation of StarD10 on serine 284 and the acidic C terminus of StarD10 in general provide a mechanism by which membrane association is regulated. Post-translational modification by phosphorylation is a common mechanism by which the activity of proteins can be regulated in a dynamic manner. Here we have mapped by mass spectrometry a novel in vivo phosphorylation site on serine 284 in StarD10 and provide evidence that phosphorylation on this site inhibits lipid transfer activity. Phosphorylation increases the local negative charge, eliciting conformational changes or influencing interaction with protein partners, or as shown here, with membranes. Simple exchange of serine 284 with glutamic acid, however, did not appear to mimic the phosphorylated state (data not shown). The C terminus of StarD10 further comprises several acidic residues that apparently contribute to inhibition of membrane association. This is shown by deletion of the last eight C-terminal amino acids, which significantly increased membrane binding in vitro, association with cellular membranes in intact cells, and, finally, in vitro lipid transfer activity. It is conceivable that increased partitioning of StarD10 to membranes allows for fast and efficient lipid transfer by increasing the residence time of the protein at the membrane, thereby increasing the probability of lipid entry into (or exit from) the binding pocket. On the other hand, stable association with membranes could also inhibit lipid transfer, at least in vitro. In vivo, however, lipid transfer is thought to occur at membrane contact sites, at which membranes of two organelles come into close apposition (10Levine T. Loewen C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Here, dissociation of the protein may not be a prerequisite for efficient lipid transfer. We previously mapped serine 259 in StarD10 to be phosphorylated by a yet unknown kinase (16Hoffmann P. Olayioye M.A. Moritz R.L. Lindeman G.J. Visvader J.E. Simpson R.J. Kemp B.E. Electrophoresis. 2005; 26: 1029-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Based on results with a serine to alanine exchange mutant, phosphorylation on this site does not affect StarD10 lipid transfer activity (data not shown) but may rather determine protein stability, because a StarD10-S259A mutant was repeatedly found to be expressed at lower levels. Of note, both phosphorylation sites operate independently from one another, because the StarD10-S284A mutant was still phosphorylated on serine 259 as determined by a phosphospecific antibody (data not shown). Several members of the START family are known to be regulated by phosphorylation, either with regard to their activity or subcellular localization. In StAR, phosphorylation of serine 195 increases its steroidogenic activity in vivo as demonstrated by a phosphorylation site mutant (18Arakane F. King S.R. Du Y. Kallen C.B. Walsh L.P. Watari H. Stocco D.M. Strauss J.F. II I J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32656-32662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), whereas phosphorylation of Pctp regulates its relocation to mitochondria (19de Brouwer A.P. Westerman J. Kleinnijenhuis A. Bevers L.E. Roelofsen B. Wirtz K.W. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 274: 100-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Inhibition of lipid transfer activity due to phosphorylation has been demonstrated for the ceramide transfer protein CERT. Phosphorylation by protein kinase D on serine 132 adjacent to the pleckstrin homology domain negatively regulates CERT interaction with phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and inhibits ceramide transfer activity (20Fugmann T. Hausser A. Schoeffler P. Schmid S. Pfizenmaier K. Olayioye M.A. J. Cell Biol. 2007; (, in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Although the cellular target membranes have yet to be identified, StarD10 transiently expressed in COS7 cells was found to be mainly cytosolic, and it accumulated in a perinuclear region that may represent Golgi and ER membranes (data not shown). Correct localization likely involves association with protein partners and therefore attempts are being made to identify candidate proteins by yeast two hybrid screening. Studies using truncation mutants and synthetic peptides have provided evidence that the C terminus of Pctp may function as a membrane interaction domain involving an amphipathic α-helix. Removal of the last five residues of Pctp decreased its lipid transfer activity by 50%, whereas deletion of the last 10 residues completely abolished activity and markedly decreased the level of membrane binding (21Feng L. Chan W.W. Roderick S.L. Cohen D.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15399-15409Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Compared with Pctp, StarD10 has a 65-amino acid C-terminal extension, thus, deletion of the last 8 residues leaves its START domain structurally intact and is not expected to impact on ligand binding. In line with this, lipid transfer activity of the StarD10-Δ8 mutant was found to be enhanced rather than abolished and was independent of cellular cofactors (Fig. 4). The C-terminal tail thus serves as an intrinsic regulator of StarD10 activity. It appears that most of the StarD10 protein transiently expressed in HEK293T cells is phosphorylated on serine 284, because in vitro CKII phosphorylation required prior dephosphorylation of the protein. Similarly, protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation of PITPβ isolated from brain could only be observed after dephosphorylation, indicating a high degree of phosphorylation (22Snoek G.T. van Tiel C.M. Egmond M.R. Biochimie (Paris). 2004; 86: 857-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In agreement with serine 284 phosphorylation inhibiting StarD10 membrane association, StarD10 expressed in cells was found to be mainly cytosolic (Fig. 5, B and C), and its lipid transfer activity was suppressed under normal growth conditions (Fig. 3). The challenge remains to identify those conditions that promote dephosphorylation of serine 284, either due to low CKII activity or activation of the phosphatase that dephosphorylates StarD10 on this site. CKII is a ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine kinase with roles in proliferation, cell survival, differentiation, and transformation. CKII is a tetramer composed of two catalytic (α or α′) and two regulatory β subunits. Initially thought to be constitutively active, it is now believed that different cellular CKII pools exist that are regulated locally by differential subunit assembly, phosphorylation, and association with scaffolding proteins (23Olsten M.E. Litchfield D.W. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 681-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 24Ahmed K. Gerber D.A. Cochet C. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 226-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). High CKII levels are found in many proliferating tumors and in transgenic mice targeted expression of CKIIα in T cells and in the mammary gland induced lymphomagenesis and mammary tumorigenesis, respectively (25Landesman-Bollag E.

Science. 1995; 267: 894-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The potentiation of NF-κB and Wnt signaling pathways has been suggested to contribute to the oncogenic potential of CKII (25Landesman-Bollag E. Romieu-Mourez R. Song D.H. Sonenshein G.E. Cardiff R.D. Seldin D.C. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3247-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 26Seldin D.C. Leder P. Science. 1995; 267: 894-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). In addition, phosphorylation of proteins such as Bid and Max by CKII protects them from caspase-mediated cleavage, suggesting that CKII further enhances cancer cell survival by inhibiting the action of proteins involved in apoptosis (27Krippner-Heidenreich A.

StarD10 was found to be overexpressed in Neu/ErbB2-induced mammary tumors in transgenic mice, in several human breast carcinoma cell lines, and in 35% of primary human breast cancers (14Olayioye M.A. Hoffmann P. Pomorski T. Armes J. Simpson R.J. Kemp B.E. Lindeman G.J. Visvader J.E. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3538-3544Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In fibroblasts, StarD10 coexpression with the epidermal growth factor receptor/ErbB1 augmented growth in soft agar, indicating that the presence of StarD10 may confer a growth advantage and contribute to cellular transformation (14Olayioye M.A. Hoffmann P. Pomorski T. Armes J. Simpson R.J. Kemp B.E. Lindeman G.J. Visvader J.E. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3538-3544Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Whether this is linked to its lipid transfer activity or may be due to an additional function is not known. Due to high CKII levels and/or activity in breast cancer cells, we assume that StarD10 is phosphorylated on serine 284 in these cells, down-regulating membrane interaction and lipid transfer activity. In future studies it would thus be of interest to correlate the phosphorylation status of StarD10 with CKII activity in tumor cells. We are grateful to Pentti Somerharju for generously providing lipids, Bernhard Luöscher for a gift of purified CKII, and Anne Verhagen and Hitto Kaufmann for help with two-dimensional PAGE."
