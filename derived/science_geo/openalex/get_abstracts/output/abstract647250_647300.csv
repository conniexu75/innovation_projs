https://openalex.org/W3004480399,"Somatic mutations in cancer genomes are caused by multiple mutational processes, each of which generates a characteristic mutational signature1. Here, as part of the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium2 of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we characterized mutational signatures using 84,729,690 somatic mutations from 4,645 whole-genome and 19,184 exome sequences that encompass most types of cancer. We identified 49 single-base-substitution, 11 doublet-base-substitution, 4 clustered-base-substitution and 17 small insertion-and-deletion signatures. The substantial size of our dataset, compared with previous analyses3-15, enabled the discovery of new signatures, the separation of overlapping signatures and the decomposition of signatures into components that may represent associated-but distinct-DNA damage, repair and/or replication mechanisms. By estimating the contribution of each signature to the mutational catalogues of individual cancer genomes, we revealed associations of signatures to exogenous or endogenous exposures, as well as to defective DNA-maintenance processes. However, many signatures are of unknown cause. This analysis provides a systematic perspective on the repertoire of mutational processes that contribute to the development of human cancer."

Sequencing data from a single biopsy represent a snapshot of this process that can reveal the timing of specific genomic aberrations and the changing influence of mutational processes3. Here, by whole-genome sequencing analysis of 2,658 cancers as part of the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)4, we reconstruct the life history and evolution of mutational processes and driver mutation sequences of 38 types of cancer. Early oncogenesis is characterized by mutations in a constrained set of driver genes, and specific copy number gains, such as trisomy 7 in glioblastoma and isochromosome 17q in medulloblastoma. The mutational spectrum changes significantly throughout tumour evolution in 40% of samples. A nearly fourfold diversification of driver genes and increased genomic instability are features of later stages. Copy number alterations often occur in mitotic crises, and lead to simultaneous gains of chromosomal segments. Timing analyses suggest that driver mutations often precede diagnosis by many years, if not decades. Together, these results determine the evolutionary trajectories of cancer, and highlight opportunities for early cancer detection."
https://openalex.org/W3005252823,"Synucleinopathies are neurodegenerative diseases that are associated with the misfolding and aggregation of α-synuclein, including Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy1. Clinically, it is challenging to differentiate Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy, especially at the early stages of disease2. Aggregates of α-synuclein in distinct synucleinopathies have been proposed to represent different conformational strains of α-synuclein that can self-propagate and spread from cell to cell3-6. Protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) is a technique that has previously been used to detect α-synuclein aggregates in samples of cerebrospinal fluid with high sensitivity and specificity7,8. Here we show that the α-synuclein-PMCA assay can discriminate between samples of cerebrospinal fluid from patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and samples from patients with multiple system atrophy, with an overall sensitivity of 95.4%. We used a combination of biochemical, biophysical and biological methods to analyse the product of α-synuclein-PMCA, and found that the characteristics of the α-synuclein aggregates in the cerebrospinal fluid could be used to readily distinguish between Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy. We also found that the properties of aggregates that were amplified from the cerebrospinal fluid were similar to those of aggregates that were amplified from the brain. These findings suggest that α-synuclein aggregates that are associated with Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy correspond to different conformational strains of α-synuclein, which can be amplified and detected by α-synuclein-PMCA. Our results may help to improve our understanding of the mechanism of α-synuclein misfolding and the structures of the aggregates that are implicated in different synucleinopathies, and may also enable the development of a biochemical assay to discriminate between Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy."
https://openalex.org/W3004859565,"Abstract The discovery of drivers of cancer has traditionally focused on protein-coding genes 1–4 . Here we present analyses of driver point mutations and structural variants in non-coding regions across 2,658 genomes from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium 5 of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). For point mutations, we developed a statistically rigorous strategy for combining significance levels from multiple methods of driver discovery that overcomes the limitations of individual methods. For structural variants, we present two methods of driver discovery, and identify regions that are significantly affected by recurrent breakpoints and recurrent somatic juxtapositions. Our analyses confirm previously reported drivers 6,7 , raise doubts about others and identify novel candidates, including point mutations in the 5′ region of TP53 , in the 3′ untranslated regions of NFKBIZ and TOB1 , focal deletions in BRD4 and rearrangements in the loci of AKR1C genes. We show that although point mutations and structural variants that drive cancer are less frequent in non-coding genes and regulatory sequences than in protein-coding genes, additional examples of these drivers will be found as more cancer genomes become available."

https://openalex.org/W3005295643,"The discovery of superconductivity at 200 kelvin in the hydrogen sulfide system at high pressures1 demonstrated the potential of hydrogen-rich materials as high-temperature superconductors. Recent theoretical predictions of rare-earth hydrides with hydrogen cages2,3 and the subsequent synthesis of LaH10 with a superconducting critical temperature (Tc) of 250 kelvin4,5 have placed these materials on the verge of achieving the long-standing goal of room-temperature superconductivity. Electrical and X-ray diffraction measurements have revealed a weakly pressure-dependent Tc for LaH10 between 137 and 218 gigapascals in a structure that has a face-centred cubic arrangement of lanthanum atoms5. Here we show that quantum atomic fluctuations stabilize a highly symmetrical $${Fm}\overline{3}{m}$$ crystal structure over this pressure range. The structure is consistent with experimental findings and has a very large electron–phonon coupling constant of 3.5. Although ab initio classical calculations predict that this $${Fm}\overline{3}{m}$$ structure undergoes distortion at pressures below 230 gigapascals2,3, yielding a complex energy landscape, the inclusion of quantum effects suggests that it is the true ground-state structure. The agreement between the calculated and experimental Tc values further indicates that this phase is responsible for the superconductivity observed at 250 kelvin. The relevance of quantum fluctuations calls into question many of the crystal structure predictions that have been made for hydrides within a classical approach and that currently guide the experimental quest for room-temperature superconductivity6–8. Furthermore, we find that quantum effects are crucial for the stabilization of solids with high electron–phonon coupling constants that could otherwise be destabilized by the large electron–phonon interaction9, thus reducing the pressures required for their synthesis. Quantum atomic fluctuations have a crucial role in stabilizing the crystal structure of the high-pressure superconducting phase of lanthanum hydride."

https://openalex.org/W3004904380,"Neural control of the function of visceral organs is essential for homeostasis and health. Intestinal peristalsis is critical for digestive physiology and host defence, and is often dysregulated in gastrointestinal disorders1. Luminal factors, such as diet and microbiota, regulate neurogenic programs of gut motility2-5, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here we show that the transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) functions as a biosensor in intestinal neural circuits, linking their functional output to the microbial environment of the gut lumen. Using nuclear RNA sequencing of mouse enteric neurons that represent distinct intestinal segments and microbiota states, we demonstrate that the intrinsic neural networks of the colon exhibit unique transcriptional profiles that are controlled by the combined effects of host genetic programs and microbial colonization. Microbiota-induced expression of AHR in neurons of the distal gastrointestinal tract enables these neurons to respond to the luminal environment and to induce expression of neuron-specific effector mechanisms. Neuron-specific deletion of Ahr, or constitutive overexpression of its negative feedback regulator CYP1A1, results in reduced peristaltic activity of the colon, similar to that observed in microbiota-depleted mice. Finally, expression of Ahr in the enteric neurons of mice treated with antibiotics partially restores intestinal motility. Together, our experiments identify AHR signalling in enteric neurons as a regulatory node that integrates the luminal environment with the physiological output of intestinal neural circuits to maintain gut homeostasis and health."
https://openalex.org/W3004951630,"The biology of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) has predominantly been studied under transplantation conditions1,2. It has been particularly challenging to study dynamic HSC behaviour, given that the visualization of HSCs in the native niche in live animals has not, to our knowledge, been achieved. Here we describe a dual genetic strategy in mice that restricts reporter labelling to a subset of the most quiescent long-term HSCs (LT-HSCs) and that is compatible with current intravital imaging approaches in the calvarial bone marrow3-5. We show that this subset of LT-HSCs resides close to both sinusoidal blood vessels and the endosteal surface. By contrast, multipotent progenitor cells (MPPs) show greater variation in distance from the endosteum and are more likely to be associated with transition zone vessels. LT-HSCs are not found in bone marrow niches with the deepest hypoxia and instead are found in hypoxic environments similar to those of MPPs. In vivo time-lapse imaging revealed that LT-HSCs at steady-state show limited motility. Activated LT-HSCs show heterogeneous responses, with some cells becoming highly motile and a fraction of HSCs expanding clonally within spatially restricted domains. These domains have defined characteristics, as HSC expansion is found almost exclusively in a subset of bone marrow cavities with bone-remodelling activity. By contrast, cavities with low bone-resorbing activity do not harbour expanding HSCs. These findings point to previously unknown heterogeneity within the bone marrow microenvironment, imposed by the stages of bone turnover. Our approach enables the direct visualization of HSC behaviours and dissection of heterogeneity in HSC niches."
https://openalex.org/W3005467454,"Xist represents a paradigm for the function of long non-coding RNA in epigenetic regulation, although how it mediates X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) remains largely unexplained. Several proteins that bind to Xist RNA have recently been identified, including the transcriptional repressor SPEN1-3, the loss of which has been associated with deficient XCI at multiple loci2-6. Here we show in mice that SPEN is a key orchestrator of XCI in vivo and we elucidate its mechanism of action. We show that SPEN is essential for initiating gene silencing on the X chromosome in preimplantation mouse embryos and in embryonic stem cells. SPEN is dispensable for maintenance of XCI in neural progenitors, although it significantly decreases the expression of genes that escape XCI. We show that SPEN is immediately recruited to the X chromosome upon the upregulation of Xist, and is targeted to enhancers and promoters of active genes. SPEN rapidly disengages from chromatin upon gene silencing, suggesting that active transcription is required to tether SPEN to chromatin. We define the SPOC domain as a major effector of the gene-silencing function of SPEN, and show that tethering SPOC to Xist RNA is sufficient to mediate gene silencing. We identify the protein partners of SPOC, including NCoR/SMRT, the m6A RNA methylation machinery, the NuRD complex, RNA polymerase II and factors involved in the regulation of transcription initiation and elongation. We propose that SPEN acts as a molecular integrator for the initiation of XCI, bridging Xist RNA with the transcription machinery-as well as with nucleosome remodellers and histone deacetylases-at active enhancers and promoters."
https://openalex.org/W3005314662,"Shear stress on arteries produced by blood flow is important for vascular development and homeostasis but can also initiate atherosclerosis1. Endothelial cells that line the vasculature use molecular mechanosensors to directly detect shear stress profiles that will ultimately lead to atheroprotective or atherogenic responses2. Plexins are key cell-surface receptors of the semaphorin family of cell-guidance signalling proteins and can regulate cellular patterning by modulating the cytoskeleton and focal adhesion structures3-5. However, a role for plexin proteins in mechanotransduction has not been examined. Here we show that plexin D1 (PLXND1) has a role in mechanosensation and mechanically induced disease pathogenesis. PLXND1 is required for the response of endothelial cells to shear stress in vitro and in vivo and regulates the site-specific distribution of atherosclerotic lesions. In endothelial cells, PLXND1 is a direct force sensor and forms a mechanocomplex with neuropilin-1 and VEGFR2 that is necessary and sufficient for conferring mechanosensitivity upstream of the junctional complex and integrins. PLXND1 achieves its binary functions as either a ligand or a force receptor by adopting two distinct molecular conformations. Our results establish a previously undescribed mechanosensor in endothelial cells that regulates cardiovascular pathophysiology, and provide a mechanism by which a single receptor can exhibit a binary biochemical nature."
https://openalex.org/W3005464218,"LGR5 marks resident adult epithelial stem cells at the gland base in the mouse pyloric stomach1, but the identity of the equivalent human stem cell population remains unknown owing to a lack of surface markers that facilitate its prospective isolation and validation. In mouse models of intestinal cancer, LGR5+ intestinal stem cells are major sources of cancer following hyperactivation of the WNT pathway2. However, the contribution of pyloric LGR5+ stem cells to gastric cancer following dysregulation of the WNT pathway—a frequent event in gastric cancer in humans3—is unknown. Here we use comparative profiling of LGR5+ stem cell populations along the mouse gastrointestinal tract to identify, and then functionally validate, the membrane protein AQP5 as a marker that enriches for mouse and human adult pyloric stem cells. We show that stem cells within the AQP5+ compartment are a source of WNT-driven, invasive gastric cancer in vivo, using newly generated Aqp5-creERT2 mouse models. Additionally, tumour-resident AQP5+ cells can selectively initiate organoid growth in vitro, which indicates that this population contains potential cancer stem cells. In humans, AQP5 is frequently expressed in primary intestinal and diffuse subtypes of gastric cancer (and in metastases of these subtypes), and often displays altered cellular localization compared with healthy tissue. These newly identified markers and mouse models will be an invaluable resource for deciphering the early formation of gastric cancer, and for isolating and characterizing human-stomach stem cells as a prerequisite for harnessing the regenerative-medicine potential of these cells in the clinic. AQP5 is identified as a marker for pyloric stem cells in humans and mice, and stem cells in the AQP5+ compartment are shown to be a source of invasive gastric cancer in mouse models."
https://openalex.org/W3004797639,"Thyroglobulin (TG) is the protein precursor of thyroid hormones, which are essential for growth, development and the control of metabolism in vertebrates1,2. Hormone synthesis from TG occurs in the thyroid gland via the iodination and coupling of pairs of tyrosines, and is completed by TG proteolysis3. Tyrosine proximity within TG is thought to enable the coupling reaction but hormonogenic tyrosines have not been clearly identified, and the lack of a three-dimensional structure of TG has prevented mechanistic understanding4. Here we present the structure of full-length human thyroglobulin at a resolution of approximately 3.5 Å, determined by cryo-electron microscopy. We identified all of the hormonogenic tyrosine pairs in the structure, and verified them using site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro hormone-production assays using human TG expressed in HEK293T cells. Our analysis revealed that the proximity, flexibility and solvent exposure of the tyrosines are the key characteristics of hormonogenic sites. We transferred the reaction sites from TG to an engineered tyrosine donor-acceptor pair in the unrelated bacterial maltose-binding protein (MBP), which yielded hormone production with an efficiency comparable to that of TG. Our study provides a framework to further understand the production and regulation of thyroid hormones."
https://openalex.org/W3004750425,"Despite substantial investments in public health campaigns, misunderstanding of health-related scientific information is pervasive. This is especially true in the case of tobacco use, where smokers have been found to systematically misperceive scientific information about the negative health effects of smoking, in some cases leading smokers to increase their pro-smoking bias. Here, we extend recent work on ‘networked collective intelligence’ by testing the hypothesis that allowing smokers and nonsmokers to collaboratively evaluate anti-smoking advertisements in online social networks can improve their ability to accurately assess the negative health effects of tobacco use. Using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, we conducted an online experiment where smokers and nonsmokers (N = 1600) were exposed to anti-smoking advertisements and asked to estimate the negative health effects of tobacco use, either on their own or in the presence of peer influence in a social network. Contrary to popular predictions, we find that both smokers and nonsmokers were surprisingly inaccurate at interpreting anti-smoking messages, and their errors persisted if they continued to interpret these messages on their own. However, smokers and nonsmokers significantly improved in their ability to accurately interpret anti-smoking messages by sharing their opinions in structured online social networks. Specifically, subjects in social networks reduced the error of their risk estimates by over 10 times more than subjects who revised solely based on individual reflection (p < 0.001, 10 experimental trials in total). These results suggest that social media networks may be used to activate social learning that improves the public’s ability to accurately interpret vital public health information."
https://openalex.org/W3004968944,"Smoke exposure is known to decrease total pulmonary surfactant and alter its composition, but the role of surfactant in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains unknown. We aimed to analyze the compositional changes in the surfactant lipidome in COPD and identify specific lipids associated with pulmonary function decline. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was obtained from 12 former smokers with COPD and 5 non-smoking, non-asthmatic healthy control volunteers. Lipids were extracted and analyzed by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Pulmonary function data were obtained by spirometry, and correlations of lung function with lipid species were determined. Wild-type C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 6 months of second-hand smoke in a full-body chamber. Surfactant lipids were decreased by 60% in subjects with COPD. All phospholipid classes were dramatically decreased, including ether phospholipids, which have not been studied in pulmonary surfactant. Availability of phospholipid, cholesterol, and sphingomyelin in BAL strongly correlated with pulmonary function and this was attributable to specific lipid species of phosphatidylcholine with surface tension reducing properties, and of phosphatidylglycerol with antimicrobial roles, as well as to other less studied lipid species. Mice exposed to smoke for six months recapitulated surfactant lipidomic changes observed in human subjects with COPD. In summary, we show that the surfactant lipidome is substantially altered in subjects with COPD, and decreased availability of phospholipids correlated with decreased pulmonary function. Further investigation of surfactant alterations in COPD would improve our understanding of its physiopathology and reveal new potential therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W3005501277,"Social media is increasingly utilized as a resource in healthcare. We sought to identify perceptions of using social media as an educational tool among healthcare practitioners. An electronic survey was distributed to healthcare administrators, nurses, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, physicians, and physician assistants f hospital systems and affiliated health science schools in Georgia, Maryland, South Carolina, and Wisconsin. Survey questions evaluated respondents' use and views of social media for educational purposes and workplace accessibility using a Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree). Nurses (75%), pharmacists (11%), and administrators (7%) were the most frequent respondents. Facebook® (27%), Pinterest® (17%), and Instagram® (17%) were the most frequently accessed social media platforms. Nearly 85% agreed or strongly agreed that social media can be an effective tool for educational purposes. Among those who had social media platforms, 43.0% use them for educational purposes. Pinterest® (30%), Facebook® (22%), LinkedIn® (16%), and Twitter® (14%) were most frequently used for education. About 50% of respondents had limited or no access to social media at work. Administrators, those with unlimited and limited work access, and respondents aged 20-29 and 30-39 years were more likely to agree that social media is an educational tool (OR: 3.41 (95% CI 1.31 to 8.84), 4.18 (95% CI 2.30 to 7.60), 1.66 (95% CI 1.22 to 2.25), 4.40 (95% CI 2.80 to 6.92), 2.14 (95% CI 1.53 to 3.01) respectively). Residents, physicians, and those with unlimited access were less likely to agree with allowing social media access at work for educational purposes only. Healthcare practitioners frequently utilize social media, and many believe it can be an effective educational tool in healthcare."
https://openalex.org/W3005398414,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a major health problem of global concern. The control of this disease requires appropriate preventive measures, including vaccines. In TB, T helper (Th)1 cytokines provide protection whereas Th2 and T regulatory (Treg) cytokines contribute to the pathogenesis and Th17 cytokines play a role in both protection and pathogenesis. Previous studies with Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific proteins have identified seven low molecular weight proteins, PE35, ESXA, ESXB, Rv2346c, Rv2347c, Rv3619c, and Rv3620c, as immunodominant antigens inducing Th1-cell responses in humans following natural infection with M. tuberculosis. The aim of this study was to characterize the cytokine responses induced in mice immunized with these proteins, using various adjuvants and delivery systems, i.e. chemical adjuvants (Alum and IFA), non-pathogenic mycobacteria (M. smegmatis and M. vaccae) and a DNA vaccine plasmid (pUMVC6). The immune responses were monitored by quantifying the marker cytokines secreted by Th1 (IFN-ɣ), Th2 (IL-5), Treg (IL-10), and Th17 (IL-17A) cells. DNA corresponding to pe35, esxa, esxb, rv2346c, rv2347c, rv3619c, and rv3620c genes were cloned into the expression vectors pGES-TH-1, pDE22 and pUMVC6 for expression in Escherichia coli, mycobacteria and eukaryotic cells, respectively. Mice were immunized with the recombinants using different adjuvants and delivery systems, and spleen cells were stimulated in vitro with peptides of immunizing proteins to investigate antigen-specific secretion of Th1 (IFN-ɣ), Th2 (IL-5), Treg (IL-10), and Th17 (IL-17A) cytokines. The results showed that spleen cells, from mice immunized with all antigens, secreted the protective Th1 cytokine IFN-ɣ, except ESXB, with one or more adjuvants and delivery systems. However, only Rv3619c consistently induced Th1-biased responses, without the secretion of significant concentrations of Th2, Th17 and Treg cytokines, with all adjuvants and delivery systems. Rv3619c also induced antigen-specific IgG antibodies in immunized mice."
https://openalex.org/W3005041074,"Congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) is a significant cause of hypoglycaemia in neonates and infants with the potential for permanent neurologic injury. Accurate calculations of the incidence of rare diseases such as CHI are important as they inform health care planning and can aid interpretation of genetic testing results when assessing the frequency of variants in large-scale, unselected sequencing databases. Whilst minimal incidence rates have been calculated for four European countries, the incidence of CHI in the UK is not known. In this study we have used referral rates to a central laboratory for genetic testing and annual birth rates from census data to calculate the minimal incidence of CHI within the UK from 2007 to 2016. CHI was diagnosed in 278 individuals based on inappropriately detectable insulin and/or C-peptide measurements at the time of hypoglycaemia which persisted beyond 6 months of age. From these data, we have calculated a minimum incidence of 1 in 28,389 live births for CHI in the UK. This is comparable to estimates from other outbred populations and provides an accurate estimate that will aid both health care provision and interpretation of genetic results, which will help advance our understanding of CHI."
https://openalex.org/W3005189577,"Giardia duodenalis is one of the main enteric pathogens associated with diarrheal disease. In developing countries, giardiasis is a major public health concern, particularly in children under five years of age. This study aimed to evaluate the occurrence and genetic diversity of G. duodenalis causing human infections in Shushtar County, Southwestern Iran. Individual faecal specimens were collected from 1,163 individuals (male/female ratio: 0.9; age range 2-75 years) with (n = 258) and without (n = 905) gastrointestinal symptoms living in rural and urban settings during the period 2017-2018. Conventional (sucrose flotation and microscopy) methods were used for the initial detection of G. duodenalis cysts in faecal specimens. Microscopy-positive samples were confirmed by PCR amplification and sequencing of the small subunit rRNA (ssu rRNA) gene of the parasite. A multilocus genotyping (MLG) scheme targeting the triose phosphate isomerase (tpi), the glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh), and the beta-giardin (bg) genes was used for genotyping purposes. Giardia duodenalis cysts were detected in 7.7% (90/1,163) of samples by microscopy, of which 82 were confirmed by ssu-PCR. Successful amplification and sequencing results were obtained for 23.2% (19/82), 9.8% (8/82), and 8.5% (7/82) of the confirmed samples at the tpi, gdh, and bg loci, respectively. MLG data for the three loci were available for two samples only. Out of the 24 samples genotyped at any loci, 50% (12/24) were identified as assemblage A and the remaining half as assemblage B. Overall, AII was the most prevalent sub-assemblage detected (41.7%, 10/24), followed by BIII (25.0%, 6/24), discordant BIII/BIV (5/24) or AII/AIII (2/24) sequences, and BIV (1/24). No significant correlation was demonstrated between a given assemblage/sub-assemblage and the occurrence of clinical symptoms. No genotypes adapted to animal hosts other than humans (e.g. assemblages C-F) were found circulating in the investigated human population, suggesting that transmission of human giardiasis in this Iranian region is primarily of anthroponotic nature. Further molecular-based studies are needed to confirm and expand these results, and to ascertain the presence and public health relevance of the parasite in environmental (e.g. drinking water) samples."

The results show that the degree of autocorrelation of the observations, the number of participants, the effect size, the overlap of possible start moments of the intervention between participants, the ratio of the number of measurements in the baseline- and intervention phase, a gradually emerging effect, and the number of measurements had strong main effects on the power. The two-way interactions between number of participants and effect size, and between the number of measurements and the number of start moments of the intervention also had a large effect. An online tool was developed to calculate the power of a multiple baseline design given several design characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W3005043475,"Herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) can cause severe ocular infection and blindness. We have previously shown that the HSV-1 VC2 vaccine strain is protective in mice and guinea pigs against genital herpes infection following vaginal challenge with HSV-1 or HSV-2. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of VC2 intramuscular vaccination in mice against herpetic keratitis following ocular challenge with lethal human clinical strain HSV-1(McKrae). VC2 vaccination in mice produced superior protection and morbidity control in comparison to its parental strain HSV-1(F). Specifically, after HSV-1(McKrae) ocular challenge, all VC2 vaccinated- mice survived, while 30% of the HSV-1(F)- vaccinated and 100% of the mock-vaccinated mice died post challenge. VC2-vaccinated mice did not exhibit any symptoms of ocular infection and completely recovered from initial conjunctivitis. In contrast, HSV-1(F)-vaccinated mice developed time-dependent progressive keratitis characterized by corneal opacification, while mock-vaccinated animals exhibited more severe stromal keratitis characterized by immune cell infiltration and neovascularization in corneal stroma with corneal opacification. Cornea in VC2-immunized mice exhibited significantly increased infiltration of CD3+ T lymphocytes and decreased infiltration of Iba1+ macrophages in comparison to mock- or HSV-1(F)-vaccinated groups. VC2 immunization produced higher virus neutralization titers than HSV-1(F) post challenge. Furthermore, VC-vaccination significantly increased the CD4 T central memory (TCM) subsets and CD8 T effector memory (TEM) subsets in the draining lymph nodes following ocular HSV-1 (McKrae) challenge, then mock- or HSV-1(F)-vaccination. These results indicate that VC2 vaccination produces a protective immune response at the site of challenge to protect against HSV-1-induced ocular pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3005044579,"Damage or degeneration of inner ear spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) causes hearing impairment. Previous in vitro studies indicate that cochlear glial cells can be reprogrammed into SGNs, however, it remains unknown whether this can occur in vivo. Here, we show that neonatal glial cells can be converted, in vivo, into SGNs (defined as new SGNs) by simultaneous induction of Neurog1 (Ngn1) and Neurod1. New SGNs express SGN markers, Tuj1, Map2, Prox1, Mafb and Gata3, and reduce glial cell marker Sox10 and Scn7a. The heterogeneity within new SGNs is illustrated by immunostaining and transcriptomic assays. Transcriptomes analysis indicates that well reprogrammed SGNs are similar to type I SGNs. In addition, reprogramming efficiency is positively correlated with the dosage of Ngn1 and Neurod1, but declined with aging. Taken together, our in vivo data demonstrates the plasticity of cochlear neonatal glial cells and the capacity of Ngn1 and Neurod1 to reprogram glial cells into SGNs. Looking ahead, we expect that combination of Neurog1 and Neurod1 along with other factors will further boost the percentage of fully converted (Mafb+/Gata3+) new SGNs."
https://openalex.org/W3004828674,"Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) is capable of inducing regression of solid tumors. However, TNF released in response to Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the key mediator of cytokine storm and septic shock that can cause severe tissue damage limiting anticancer applications of this cytokine. In our previous studies, we demonstrated that activation of another Toll-like receptor, TLR5, could protect from tissue damage caused by a variety of stresses including radiation, chemotherapy, Fas-activating antibody and ischemia-reperfusion. In this study, we tested whether entolimod could counteract TNF-induced toxicity in mouse models. We found that entolimod pretreatment effectively protects livers and lungs from LPS- and TNF-induced toxicity and prevents mortality caused by combining either of these agents with the sensitizer, D-galactosamine. While LPS and TNF induced significant activation of apoptotic caspase 3/7, lipid tissue peroxidation and serum ALT accumulation in mice without entolimod treatment, these indicators of toxicity were reduced by entolimod pretreatment to the levels of untreated control mice. Entolimod was effective when injected 0.5–48 hours prior to, but not when injected simultaneously or after LPS or TNF. Using chimeric mice with hematopoiesis differing in its TLR5 status from the rest of tissues, we showed that this protective activity was dependent on TLR5 expression by non-hematopoietic cells. Gene expression analysis identified multiple genes upregulated by entolimod in the liver and cultured hepatocytes as possible mediators of its protective activity. Entolimod did not interfere with the antitumor activity of TNF in mouse hepatocellular and colorectal tumor models. These results support further development of TLR5 agonists to increase tissue resistance to cytotoxic cytokines, reduce the risk of septic shock and enable safe systemic application of TNF as an anticancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3004902213,"The dentate gyrus of the hippocampus is one of two brain areas generating throughout life new neurons, which contribute to the formation of episodic/associative memories. During aging, the production of new neurons decreases and a cognitive decline occurs. Dietary factors influence neuronal function and synaptic plasticity; among them the phenolic compound hydroxytyrosol (HTyr), present in olive oil, displays neuroprotective effects. As age impacts primarily on the hippocampus-dependent cognitive processes, we wondered whether HTyr could stimulate hippocampal neurogenesis in vivo in adult and aged wild-type mice as well as in the B-cell translocation 1 gene (Btg1) knockout mouse model of accelerated neural aging. We found that treatment with HTyr activates neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of adult, aged, and Btg1-null mice, by increasing survival of new neurons and decreasing apoptosis. Notably, however, in the aged and Btg1-null dentate gyrus, HTyr treatment also stimulates the proliferation of stem and progenitor cells, whereas in the adult dentate gyrus HTyr lacks any proliferative effect. Moreover, the new neurons generated in aged mice after HTyr treatment are recruited to existing circuits, as shown by the increase of BrdU+ /c-fos+ neurons. Finally, HTyr treatment also reduces the markers of aging lipofuscin and Iba1. Overall, our findings indicate that HTyr treatment counteracts neurogenesis decline during aging."
https://openalex.org/W3004908287,"Camellia oleifera Abel. (C. oleifera), as an important woody tree species producing edible oils in China, has attracted enormous attention due to its abundant unsaturated fatty acids and their associated benefits to human health. To reveal novel insights into the characters during the maturation period of this plant as well as the molecular basis of fatty acid biosynthesis and degradation, we conducted a conjoint analysis of the transcriptome and proteome of C. oleifera seeds from Hainan Island. Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology and shotgun proteomic method, 59,391 transcripts and 40,500 unigenes were obtained by TIGR Gene Indices Clustering Tools (TGICL), while 1691 protein species were identified from Mass Spectrometry (MS). Subsequently, all genes and proteins were employed in euKaryotic Orthologous Groups (KOG) classification, Gene Ontology (GO) annotation, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis to investigate their essential functions. The results indicated that the most abundant pathways were biological metabolic processes. There were 946 unigenes associated with lipid metabolism at the transcriptome level, with 116 proteins at the proteome level; among these, 38 specific proteins were involved in protein-protein interactions, with the majority being related to fatty acid catabolic process. The expression levels of 21 candidate unigenes encoding target proteins were further detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Finally, Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) was carried out to determine the fatty acid composition of C. oleifera oil. These findings not only deepened our understanding about the molecular mechanisms of fatty acid metabolism but also offered new evidence concerning the roles of relevant proteins in oil-bearing crops. Furthermore, the lipid-associated proteins recognized in this research might be helpful in providing a reference for the synthetic regulation of C. oleifera oil quality by genetic engineering techniques, thus resulting in potential application in agriculture."
https://openalex.org/W3004622005,"Background The gastrointestinal microbiome plays an important role in host health and there is increasing concern regarding the deleterious effects of pharmaceuticals on the fecal microbiome. The effect of anthelmintic therapy on the fecal microbiome in dogs has not yet been evaluated. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of anthelmintic administration on the fecal microbiome of dogs with and without subclinical Giardia species and Cryptosporidium canis infections. Methodology/Principal findings Part 1: 6 healthy adult research beagles with subclinical giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis were administered a commercially available preparation of febantel combined with pyrantel and praziquantel (FPP) orally daily for three days. Part 2: 19 healthy staff-owned dogs without giardiasis or cryptosporidiosis were divided into a treatment group (n = 9) that was administered fenbendazole orally daily for five days and an untreated control group (n = 10). For both parts of the study, feces were collected at multiple time points before and after anthelmintic (FPP or fenbendazole) administration. Fecal DNA was extracted for Illumina sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and qPCR assays. Neither FPP nor fenbendazole treatment caused a significant change in alpha or beta diversity or the relative abundance of bacterial species. Upon univariate statistical analysis neither FPP or fenbendazole caused minimal changes in the fecal microbiota. Conclusion FPP administration was associated with minimal alterations of the fecal microbiome of healthy research beagles with subclinical giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis. Fenbendazole administration was associated with minimal alterations of the fecal microbiome of healthy staff owned dogs."
https://openalex.org/W3005407308,"Sexual debut, or first intercourse, predicts problem behaviors such as substance use. This association could reflect a direct effect of debut itself, general developmental trends, or the fact that some youth are more predisposed to a wide array of problem behaviors (e.g., risky sex, substance use). Understanding the association between sexual debut and substance use thus requires methods that can distinguish between these various accounts. In this study the association between sexual debut and substance use was investigated in a longitudinal sample of Mexican-origin youth (N = 674) assessed annually from 5th (Mage = 10.86 years, SD = 0.51) through 12th grade (Mage = 17.69 years, SD = 0.48). The longitudinal aspect of the data allowed the direct effect of sexual debut on substance use to be tested while accounting for long-term trends in substance use, and stable individual differences in those trends based on early risk and debut timing. Substance use increased over time, and early risk and debut were consistently associated with more substance use. Sexual debut also modestly predicted an increase in substance use after accounting for these effects, however. Taken together, results provide some evidence consistent with each of the potential explanations for the association between sexual debut and substance use across adolescence."
https://openalex.org/W3004550467,"Peatlands play outsized roles in the global carbon cycle. Despite occupying a rather small fraction of the terrestrial biosphere (~3%), these ecosystems account for roughly one third of the global soil carbon pool. This carbon is largely comprised of undecomposed deposits of plant material (peat) that may be meters thick. The fate of this deep carbon stockpile with ongoing and future climate change is thus of great interest and has large potential to induce positive feedback to climate warming. Recent in situ warming of an ombrotrophic peatland indicated that the deep peat microbial communities and decomposition rates were resistant to elevated temperatures. In this experiment, we sought to understand how nutrient and pH limitations may interact with temperature to limit microbial activity and community composition. Anaerobic microcosms of peat collected from 1.5 to 2 meters in depth were incubated at 6°C and 15°C with elevated pH, nitrogen (NH4Cl), and/or phosphorus (KH2PO4) in a full factorial design. The production of CO2 and CH4 was significantly greater in microcosms incubated at 15°C, although the structure of the microbial community did not differ between the two temperatures. Increasing the pH from ~3.5 to ~5.5 altered microbial community structure, however increases in CH4 production were non-significant. Contrary to expectations, N and P additions did not increase CO2 and CH4 production, indicating that nutrient availability was not a primary constraint in microbial decomposition of deep peat. Our findings indicate that temperature is a key factor limiting the decomposition of deep peat, however other factors such as the availability of O2 or alternative electron donors and high concentrations of phenolic compounds, may also exert constraints. Continued experimental peat warming studies will be necessary to assess if the deep peat carbon bank is susceptible to increased temperatures over the longer time scales."
https://openalex.org/W3005524690,"Inter-pregnancy interval is an important determinant of both maternal and child health. Suboptimal inter-pregnancy interval has been associated with adverse maternal outcomes -including postpartum hemorrhage and hypertensive disorders, direct causes of maternal mortality. Both overall maternal mortality and the contribution of postpartum hemorrhage on maternal mortality have increased in Tanzania. If we are to achieve sustainable development goal (SDG) number 3.1 to reduce the global maternal mortality ration to less than 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030, it is highly important that such contributors are dealt with. This study aimed to determine the distribution and trends of inter-pregnancy interval and to deduce its association with adverse maternal outcomes among women who delivered at Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre (2000–2015).A retrospective cohort study was designed using Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre medical birth registry data for women who delivered from 2000 to 2015. Women with at least two births recorded in the registry were included. A total of 7,995 births from 6,612 mothers were analyzed. Anemia during pregnancy, post-partum hemorrhage and pre-eclampsia were adverse maternal outcomes of interest. Data analysis was performed using multivariable logistic regression models allowing for robust standard errors. Crude and adjusted odds ratio with their respective 95% confidence intervals were estimated. More than half (51.7%) of non-first births were born within sub-optimal IPI. The median IPI was 34 months (IQR: 33.5 months). The median IPI increased from 11 months in 2002 to 35 months in 2006 and plateaued until 2014, but it rose to 41.6 months in 2015. Median IPI was shorter in young women <20 years and in birth order seven and above (16 vs. 27 months, respectively). Short IPI was associated with lower risk of pre-eclampsia [aOR: 0.71, 95%CI: 0.52, 0.97] while long IPI was associated with lower risk of post-partum hemorrhage [aOR: 0.70, 95%CI: 0.52, 0.94]. This study found an association between long and short IPI with adverse maternal outcomes. Even though these results should be interpreted with caution based on the fact that the data was sampled from a referral hospital and hence there could be overrepresentation of women with maternal complications, our findings still warrant the importance of supporting modern family planning methods as a measure to improve IPI and thereby improve maternal outcomes as well."
https://openalex.org/W3004643466,"Obesity is a multifactorial disease caused by complex interactions between genes and dietary factors. Salt-rich diet is related to the development and progression of several chronic diseases including obesity. However, the molecular basis of how salt sensitivity genes (SSG) contribute to adiposity in obesity patients remains unexplored. In this study, we used the microarray expression data of visceral adipose tissue samples and constructed a complex protein-interaction network of salt sensitivity genes and their co-expressed genes to trace the molecular pathways connected to obesity. The Salt Sensitivity Protein Interaction Network (SSPIN) of 2691 differentially expressed genes and their 15474 interactions has shown that adipose tissues are enriched with the expression of 23 SSGs, 16 hubs and 84 bottlenecks (p = 2.52 x 10–16) involved in diverse molecular pathways connected to adiposity. Fifteen of these 23 SSGs along with 8 other SSGs showed a co-expression with enriched obesity-related genes (r ≥ 0.8). These SSGs and their co-expression partners are involved in diverse metabolic pathways including adipogenesis, adipocytokine signaling pathway, renin-angiotensin system, etc. This study concludes that SSGs could act as molecular signatures for tracing the basis of adipogenesis among obese patients. Integrated network centered methods may accelerate the identification of new molecular targets from the complex obesity genomics data."
https://openalex.org/W3004781153,"Postpartum care is a critical element for ensuring survival and health of mothers and newborns but is often inadequate in low- and middle-income countries due to barriers to access and resource constraints. Newly delivered mothers and their families often rely on traditional forms of postnatal care rooted in social and cultural customs or may blend modern and traditional forms of care. This ethnographic study sought to explore use of biomedical and traditional forms of postnatal care. Data were collected through unstructured observation and in-depth interviews with 15 mothers. Participants reported embracing traditional understandings of health and illness in the post-partum period centered on heating the body through diet, steaming, and other applications of heat, yet also seeking injections from private health care providers. Thematic analysis explored concepts related to transitioning forms of postnatal care, valuing of care through different lenses, and diverse sources of advice on postnatal care. Mothers also described concurrent use of both traditional medicine and biomedical postnatal care, and the importance of adhering to cultural traditions of postnatal care for future health. Maternal and newborn health are closely associated with postnatal care, so ensuring culturally appropriate and high-quality care must be an important priority for stakeholders including understand health practices that are evolving to include injections."
https://openalex.org/W3004872968,"Computational studies of the influence of different network parameters on the dynamic and topological network effects of brain stimulation can enhance our understanding of different outcomes between individuals. In this study, a brain stimulation session along with the subsequent post-stimulation brain activity is simulated for a period of one day using a network of modified Wilson-Cowan oscillators coupled according to diffusion imaging based structural connectivity. We use this computational model to examine how differences in the inter-region connectivity and the excitability of stimulated regions at the time of stimulation can affect post-stimulation behaviours. Our findings indicate that the initial inter-region connectivity can heavily affect the changes that stimulation induces in the connectivity of the network. Moreover, differences in the excitability of the stimulated regions seem to lead to different post-stimulation connectivity changes across the model network, including on the internal connectivity of non-stimulated regions."
https://openalex.org/W3005160222,"Approximately 94% of the land area of the Northern Tibetan Plateau is covered by grasslands, which comprise one of five key livestock producing regions in China. In contrast to most other regions worldwide, these alpine grasslands are much more sensitive to global climate change, thus they are under intense study. The differences in species diversity, plant biomass, and soil properties of five representative's alpine grassland types in the Northern Tibetan Plateau were investigated in this research. The results revealed that 11 community types were identified according to the importance of dominant species and constructive species. There were significant differences in the Margalef index (H), Simpson diversity index (D), Shannon-wiener diversity index (H'), and Pielou evenness index (J) indices between these five alpine grasslands. Further, the above-ground biomass (AGB), below-ground biomass (BGB), total biomass (TB), root:shoot (R/S) ratio, and coverage showed significant differences in 5 alpine grasslands. There were also considerable variations in the pH, total nitrogen concentration (TN), total phosphorus concentration (TP), soil organic carbon (SOC) and C-to-N ratio (C:N) among the five alpine grasslands. The highest value of biomass and soil characteristics was always in the alpine steppe (AS), or AM, while the lowest of that was in the alpine desert steppe (ADS), or alpine desert (AD). Moreover, there were significant differences in the soil particle size fractions between the five alpine grasslands. In the AM and AS, the dominant soil particle was clay, while in the alpine meadow-steppe (AMS), ADS, and AD it was fine and medium sand. Substantial correlations were found between the biomass and species diversity indices H, D or H' and soil TN, TP, or SOC. Moreover, silt had a significantly positive correlation with soil C:N, BGB, TB, and R/S, while medium sand and coarse sand was significant negatively correlated. With regard to these grassland types, it is proposed that the AM or AS may be an actively changing grassland types in the Northern Tibetan Plateau."
https://openalex.org/W3005408512,"Background Cytochrome P450 1b1 (Cyp1b1) deletion and dietary retinol deficiency during pregnancy (GVAD) affect perinatal liver functions regulated by Srebp. Cyp1b1 is not expressed in perinatal liver but appears in the E9.5 embryo, close to sites of retinoic acid (RA) signaling. Hypothesis Parallel effects of Cyp1b1 and retinol on postnatal Srebp derive from effects in the developing liver or systemic signaling. Approach Cluster postnatal increases in hepatic genes in relation to effects of GVAD or Cyp1b1 deletion. Sort expression changes in relation to genes regulated by Srebp1 and Srebp2.Test these treatments on embryos at E9.5, examining changes at the site of liver initiation. Use in situ hybridization to resolve effects on mRNA distributions of Aldh1a2 and Cyp26a1 (RA homeostasis); Hoxb1 and Pax6 (RA targets). Assess mice lacking Lrat and Rbp4 (DKO mice) that severely limits retinol supply to embryos. Results At birth, GVAD and Cyp1b1 deletion stimulate gene markers of hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation but also suppress Hamp. These treatments then selectively prevent the postnatal onset of genes that synthesize cholesterol (Hmgcr, Sqle) and fatty acids (Fasn, Scd1), but also direct cholesterol transport (Ldlr, Pcsk9, Stard4) and retinoid synthesis (Aldh1a1, Rdh11). Extensive support by Cyp1b1 is implicated, but with distinct GVAD interventions for Srebp1 and Srebp2. At E9.5, Cyp1b1 is expressed in the septum transversum mesenchyme (STM) with β-carotene oxygenase (Bco1) that generates retinaldehyde. STM provides progenitors for the HSC and supports liver expansion. GVAD and Cyp1b1-/- do not affect RA-dependent Hoxb1 and Pax6. In DKO embryos, RA-dependent Cyp26a1 is lost but Hoxb1 is sustained with Cyp1b1 at multiple sites. Conclusion Cyp1b1-/- suppresses genes supported by Srebp. GVAD effects distinguish Srebp1 and Srebp2 mediation. Srebp regulation overlaps appreciably in cholesterol and retinoid homeostasis. Bco1/Cyp1b1 partnership in the STM may contribute to this later liver regulation."
https://openalex.org/W3005361332,"Questions about the evolution of material culture are widespread in the humanities and social sciences. Statistical modeling of long-term changes in material culture is less common due to a lack of appropriate frameworks. Our goal is to close this gap and provide robust statistical methods for examining changes in the diversity of material culture. We provide an open-source and quantitative workflow for estimating rates of origination, extinction, and preservation, as well as identifying key shift points in the diversification histories of material culture. We demonstrate our approach using two distinct kinds of data: age ranges for the production of American car models, and radiocarbon dates associated with archaeological cultures of the European Neolithic. Our approach improves on existing frameworks by disentangling the relative contributions of origination and extinction to diversification. Our method also permits rigorous statistical testing of competing hypotheses to explain changes in diversity. Finally, we stress the value of a flexible approach that can be applied to data in various forms; this flexibility allows scholars to explore commonalities between forms of material culture and ask questions about the general properties of cultural change."
https://openalex.org/W3004858623,"Background Poor quality use of medicines (QUM) has adverse outcomes. Governments’ implementation of essential medicines (EM) policies is often suboptimal and there is limited information on which policies are most effective. Methods We analysed data on policy implementation from World Health Organisation (WHO) surveys in 2007 and 2011, and QUM data from surveys during 2006–2012 in developing and transitional countries. We compared QUM scores in countries that did or did not implement specific policies and regressed QUM composite scores on the numbers of policies implemented. We compared the ranking of policies in this and two previous studies, one from the same WHO databases (2003–2007) the other from data obtained during country visits in South-East Asia (2010–2015). The rankings of a common set of 17 policies were correlated and we identified those that were consistently highly ranked. Findings Fifty-three countries had data on both QUM and policy implementation. Forty policies were associated with effect sizes ranging from +13% to -5%. There was positive correlation between the composite QUM indicator and the number of policies reported implemented: (r) = 0.437 (95% CI 0.188 to 0.632). Comparison of policy rankings between the present and previous studies showed positive correlation with the WHO 2003–7 study: Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient 0.498 (95% CI 0.022 to 0.789). Across the three studies, five policies were in the top five ranked positions 11 out of a possible 15 times: drugs available free at the point of care; a government QUM unit; undergraduate training of prescribers in standard treatment guidelines, antibiotics not available without prescription and generic substitution in the public sector. Interpretation Certain EM policies are associated with better QUM and impact increases with co-implementation. Analysis across three datasets provides a policy short-list as a minimum investment by countries trying to improve QUM and reduce antimicrobial drug misuse."

With rapidly changing technology, music collections have become overwhelmingly digital ushering in changes in listening habits, especially when it comes to listening on personal devices. By using interactive visualizations, descriptive analysis and thematic analysis, this project aims to explore why people download and listen to music and which aspects of the music listening experience are prioritized when people talk about tracks on their device. Using a newly developed data collection method, Shuffled Play, 397 participants answered open-ended and closed research questions through a short online questionnaire after shuffling their music library and playing two pieces as prompts for reflections. The findings of this study highlight that when talking about tracks on their personal devices, people prioritise characterizing them using sound and musical features and associating them with the informational context around them (artist, album, and genre) over their emotional responses to them. The results also highlight that people listen to and download music because they like it–a straightforward but important observation that is sometimes glossed over in previous research. These findings have implications for future work in understanding music, its uses and its functions in peoples’ everyday lives."
https://openalex.org/W3005451512,"By reading the H3K9Me3 mark through their N-terminal chromodomain (CD), HP1 proteins play a significant role in cancer-associated processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, chromosomal stability, and DNA repair. Here, we used a combination of bioinformatics-based methodologies, as well as experimentally-derived datasets, that reveal the existence of a novel short HP1γ (CBX3) isoform, named here sHP1γ, generated by alternative splicing of the CBX3 locus. The sHP1γ mRNA encodes a protein composed of 101 residues and lacks the C-terminal chromoshadow domain (CSD) that is required for dimerization and heterodimerization in the previously described 183 a. a HP1γ protein. Fold recognition, order-to-disorder calculations, threading, homology-based molecular modeling, docking, and molecular dynamic simulations show that the sHP1γ is comprised of a CD flanked by intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) with an IDR-CD-IDR domain organization and likely retains the ability to bind to the H3K9Me3. Both qPCR analyses and mRNA-seq data derived from large-scale studies confirmed that sHP1γ mRNA is expressed in the majority of human tissues at approximately constant ratios with the chromoshadow domain containing isoform. However, sHP1γ mRNA levels appear to be dysregulated in different cancer types. Thus, our data supports the notion that, due to the existence of functionally different isoforms, the regulation of HP1γ-mediated functions is more complex than previously anticipated."
https://openalex.org/W3005520503,"Introduction Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is an important tool for analyzing gene expression. However, before analyzing the expression of target genes, it is crucial to normalize the reference genes, in order to find the most stable gene to be used as an endogenous control. A gene that remains stable in all samples under different treatments is considered a suitable normalizer. In this sense, we aimed to identify stable reference genes for normalization of target genes in the heart and liver tissues from two genetically divergent groups of chickens (Cobb 500® commercial line and Peloco backyard chickens) under comfort and acute heat stress environmental conditions. Eight reference genes (ACTB, HPRT1, RPL5, EEF1, MRPS27, MRPS30, TFRC and LDHA) were analyzed for expression stability. The samples were obtained from 24 chickens, 12 from the backyard Peloco and 12 from the Cobb 500® line, exposed to two environmental conditions (comfort and heat stress). Comfort temperature was 23°C and heat stress temperature was 39.5°C for one hour. Subsequently, the animals were euthanized, and heart and liver tissue fragments were collected for RNA extraction and amplification. To determine the stability rate of gene expression, three different statistical algorithms were applied: BestKeeper, geNorm and NormFinder, and to obtain an aggregated stability list, the RankAgregg package of R software was used. Results The most stable genes using BestKeeper tool, including the two factors (genetic group and environmental condition), were LDHA, RPL5 and MRPS27 for heart tissue, and TFRC, RPL5 and EEF1 for liver tissue. Applying geNorm algorithm, the best reference genes were RPL5, EEF1 and MRPS30 for heart tissue and LDHA, EEF1 and RPL5 for liver. Using the NormFinder algorithm, the best normalizer genes were EEF1, RPL5 and LDHA in heart, and EEF1, RPL5 and ACTB in liver tissue. In the overall ranking obtained by RankAggreg package, considering the three algorithms, the RPL5, EEF1 and LDHA genes were the most stable for heart tissue, whereas RPL5, EEF1 and ACTB were the most stable for liver tissue. Conclusion According to the RankAggreg tool classification based on the three different algorithms (BestKeeper, geNorm and NormFinder), the most stable genes were RPL5, EEF1 and LDHA for heart tissue and RPL5, EEF1 and ACTB for liver tissue of chickens subjected to comfort and acute heat stress environmental conditions. However, the best reference genes may vary depending on the experimental conditions of each study, such as different breeds, environmental stressors, and tissues analyzed. Therefore, the need to perform priori studies to assay the best reference genes at the outset of each study is emphasized."

It is a variation of the One-to-one Pickup and Delivery Problem (OPDP), which is common in daily life, such as the Passenger Train Operation Plans (PTOP) and partial Taxi-sharing Problem. Unlike the classical OPDP, in the OPDPSTRP, (1) each demand must be transported along the shortest path according to passengers/shippers requirements, and (2) each vehicle should travel along a real-life path. First, six route structure rules are proposed for the OPDPSTRP, and a kind of Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) models is formulated for it. Second, A Variable Neighborhood Descent (VND), a Variable Neighborhood Research (VNS), a Multi-Start VND (MS_VND) and a Multi-Start VNS (MS_VNS) with five neighborhood operators has been developed to solve the problem. Finally, The Gurobi solver, the VND, the VNS, the MS_VND and the MS_VNS have been compared with each other by 84 random instances partitioned in small size connected graphs, medium size connected graphs and large size connected graphs. From the test results we found that solutions generated by these approaches are often comparable with those found by the Gurobi solver, and the solutions found by these approaches are better than the solutions found by the Gurobi solver when solving instances with larger numbers of demands. In almost all instances, the MS_VND significantly outperforms the VND and the VNS in terms of solution quality, and outperforms the MS_VNS both in terms of solution quality and CPU time. In the instances with large numbers of demands, the MS_VND is still able to generate good feasible solutions in a reasonable CPU time, which is of vital practical significance for real-life instances."
https://openalex.org/W3004902264,"Intestinal barrier dysfunction is a major complication of total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Our preliminary study revealed that intestinal P-glycoprotein (P-gp) was significantly downregulated under TPN treatment followed by disruption of barrier function, and thus the significance of early downregulation of P-gp needs to be addressed. Herein, we report a pivotal role of P-gp in the development of intestinal barrier dysfunction under TPN. Functional suppression of P-gp may facilitate bacterial attachment to intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and thereby induce degradation of tight junctions to trigger barrier dysfunction. By using a rat model of TPN, we found early downregulation of P-gp function in ileum after 3-day TPN, followed by disruption of barrier function after 7-day TPN. By using Escherichia coli (E. coli) k88 and DH5α as type strains, we found significantly increased bacterial attachment to IECs in TPN group compared to sham. By using Caco-2 cells as an IEC model in vitro, we found that functional suppression of P-gp remarkably facilitated bacterial attachment to Caco-2 cells, leading to subsequent disruption of intestinal barrier function. Of note, Occludin was significantly downregulated by bacterial attachment when P-gp was functionally suppressed. Mechanistically, changes on Occludin were attributed to enhanced protein degradation instead of suppressed protein translation. Despite the half-life of Occludin protein being unchanged by DH5α treatment alone, it was decreased by about 40% when P-gp was simultaneously suppressed. Taken together, our findings revealed that early downregulation of intestinal P-gp under TPN may be a potential therapeutic target to prevent the development of barrier dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W3004928520,"In tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling, phosphorylation and activation of receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) by upstream kinases is an essential checkpoint in the suppression of TNF-induced cell death. Thus, discovery of pharmacological agents targeting RIPK1 may provide new strategies for improving the therapeutic efficacy of TNF. In this study, we found that 3-O-acetylrubianol C (3AR-C), an arborinane triterpenoid isolated from Rubia philippinesis, promoted TNF-induced apoptotic and necroptotic cell death. To identify the molecular mechanism, we found that in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, 3AR-C drastically upregulated RIPK1 kinase activity by selectively inhibiting IKKβ. Notably, 3AR-C did not interfere with IKKα or affect the formation of the TNF receptor1 (TNFR1) complex-I. Moreover, in human cancer cells, 3AR-C was only sufficient to sensitize TNF-induced cell death when c-FLIPL expression was downregulated to facilitate the formation of TNFR1 complex-II and necrosome. Taken together, our study identified a novel arborinane triterpenoid 3AR-C as a potent activator of TNF-induced cell death via inhibition of IKKβ phosphorylation and promotion of the cytotoxic potential of RIPK1, thus providing a rationale for further development of 3AR-C as a selective IKKβ inhibitor to overcome TNF resistance in cancer therpay."

This study examined the effects of four display curvature radii (2300R, 4000R, 6000R, and flat), two viewing distances (2.3 m and 4 m), and five lateral viewing positions (P1-P5; 0, 35, 70, 105, and 140 cm off-center) on seven TV watching experience elements (spatial presence, engagement, ecological validity, negative effects, visual comfort, image quality, and user satisfaction). Fifty-six individuals (14 per display curvature radius) were seated in pairs to watch videos, each time at a different viewing position (2 viewing distances × 5 paired lateral viewing positions). The spatial presence and engagement increased when display curvature radius approached a viewing distance and lateral viewing position approached P1, with 4000R-4m-P1 (display curvature radius-viewing distance-lateral viewing position) providing the best results. Lateral viewing position alone significantly affected five TV watching experience elements; the spatial presence and engagement decreased at P3-P5, and ecological validity, image quality, and user satisfaction decreased at P4-P5. However, display curvature radius alone did not appreciably affect TV watching experience, and viewing distance alone significantly affected visual comfort only, with a 4-m viewing distance increasing visual comfort. This study demonstrated that effective display curvature radii for watching TV are viewing distance-dependent, and less off-center lateral viewing positions (P1-P2) are recommended for TV watching experience. Finally, among the TV watching experience elements, engagement explained user satisfaction to the greatest degree."
https://openalex.org/W3004547649,"Targeted gene therapy using recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors is a potential therapeutic strategy for treating cancer, and tissue-specific promoters may help with tissue targeting. Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a disease of the calcitonin secreting thyroid C cells, and calcitonin is highly expressed in MTC tumors compared to other cells. To target MTC cells, we evaluated an rAAV serotype 2 vector (rAAV2-pM+104-GFP) containing a modified calcitonin/calcitonin gene related peptide promoter (pM+104) and a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene. In vitro transduction experiments comparing the MTC TT cell line with non-MTC cell lines demonstrated that rAAV2-pM+104-GFP infection yielded significantly (p < 0.05) higher GFP expression in TT cells than in non-MTC cell lines (HEK293 and HeLa), and significantly higher expression than in TT cells infected with the positive control rAAV2-pCBA-GFP vector. The rAAV2-pCBA-GFP control vector included a well-characterized, ubiquitously expresses control promoter, the chicken beta actin promoter with a cytomegalovirus enhancer (pCBA). In vivo experiments using a TT cell xenograft tumor mouse model showed that tumors directly injected with 2 x 1010 vg of rAAV2-pM+104-GFP vector resulted in GFP expression detected in 21.7% of cells, 48 hours after the injection. Furthermore, GFP expression was significantly higher for rAAV-pM+104-GFP treatments with a longer vector treatment duration and higher vector dose, with up to 52.6% (q < 0.05) GFP cells detected 72 hours after injecting 1x 1011 vg/tumor. These data show that we have developed an rAAV vector with improved selectivity for MTC."
https://openalex.org/W3004654354,"The population of the globally endangered hog deer (Axis porcinus) has declined severely across its geographic range. Intensive monitoring of its demographic and genetic status is necessary. We examined the demographic and genetic structure of a small hog deer population in Keibul Lamjao National Park (KLNP), located on the western fringe of the Indo-Burma biodiversity hotspot for conservation planning. The distribution pattern of hog deer in the Park was derived based on the presence/absence of faecal pellets in 1 km × 1 km grids. We used double-observer distance sampling method to derive the hog deer abundance and population structure and compared with previous data to derive the population trend. We determined the genetic diversity of the population through microsatellite screening and bottleneck detection. The overall pellet density was 0.34 ± 0.02 pellets km-2 restricted to only 22.34 ± 0.20 km2 area of the park. The estimated density of the deer in the park was 1.82–4.32 individuals km-2. The population showed a declining trend from 2006–08 (p < 0.05, R2 = 0.916) with 8% annum-1 and an increasing trend from 2003–2018 (p < 0.05, R2 = 0.9304) with 10% annum-1. The adult male-to-female ratio and fawn-to-doe ratio were 36.2 ± 1.9 males per 100 females and 16.5 ± 0.4 fawns per 100 females, respectively. The molecular examination suggested that the mean number of alleles at 23 loci was 2.70 ± 0.18, the observed heterozygosity (Ho) ranged from 0.26 to 0.63 (mean 0.42 ± 0.02), the expected heterozygosity (He) ranged from 0.23 to 0.73 (χ = 0.51 ± 0.03), and the polymorphic information content (PIC) ranged from 0.2 to 0.67 (χ = 0.43 ± 0.03) indicating a moderate level of genetic diversity. Although no bottleneck in the population was observed, the loss of genetic diversity may affect the evolutionary potential of the species at the site by limiting the selection flexibility. Conservation planning coupled with scientific management regime will help in the long term persistence of the population in the region."
https://openalex.org/W3005440908,"We previously developed an in vivo site-specific transfection method using a suction device in mice; namely, a tissue suction-mediated transfection method (tissue suction method). The aim of this study was to apply the tissue suction method for cardiac gene transfer. Naked plasmid DNA (pDNA) was intravenously injected in mice, followed by direct suction on the beating heart by using a suction device made of polydimethylsiloxane. We first examined the effects of suction conditions on transgene expression and toxicity. Subsequently, we analyzed transgene-expressing cells and the transfected region of the heart. We found that heart suction induced transgene expression, and that -75 kPa and -90 kPa of suction achieved high transgene expression. In addition, the inner diameter of the suction device was correlated with transgene expression, but the pressure hold time did not change transgene expression. Although the tissue suction method at -75 kPa induced a transient increase in the serum cardiac toxicity markers at 6 h after transfection, these markers returned to normal at 24 h. The cardiac damage was also analyzed through the measurement of hypertrophic gene expression, but no significant differences were found. In addition, the cardiac function monitored by echocardiography remained normal at 11 days after transfection. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that CD31-positive endothelial cells co-expressed the ZsGreen1-N1 reporter gene. In conclusion, the tissue suction method can achieve an efficient and safe gene transfer to the beating heart in mice."
https://openalex.org/W3004873758,"Adverse drug reactions have been linked with HLA alleles in different studies. These HLA proteins play an essential role in the adaptive immune response for the presentation of self and non-self peptides. Anti-thyroid drugs methimazole and propylthiouracil have been associated with drug induced agranulocytosis (severe lower white blood cell count) in patients with B*27:05, B*38:02 and DRB1*08:03 alleles in different populations: Taiwanese, Vietnamese, Han Chinese and Caucasian.In this study, informatics methods were used to investigate if any sequence or structural similarities exist between the two associated HLA-B alleles, compared with a set of ""control"" alleles assumed not be associated, which could help explain the molecular basis of the adverse drug reaction. We demonstrated using MHC Motif Viewer and MHCcluster that the two alleles do not have a propensity to bind similar peptides, and thus at a gross level the structure of the antigen presentation region of the two alleles are not similar. We also performed multiple sequence alignment to identify polymorphisms shared by the risk but not by the control alleles and molecular docking to compare the predicted binding poses of the drug-allele combinations.Two residues, Cys67 and Thr80, were identified from the multiple sequence alignments to be unique to these risk alleles alone. The molecular docking showed the poses of the risk alleles to favour the F-pocket of the peptide binding groove, close to the Thr80 residue, with the control alleles generally favouring a different pocket. The data are thus suggestive that Thr80 may be a critical residue in HLA-mediated anti-thyroid drug induced agranulocytosis, and thus can guide future research and risk assessment."
https://openalex.org/W3004939105,"We develop a dynamic matched sample estimation algorithm to distinguish peer influence and homophily effects on item adoption decisions in dynamic networks, with numerous items diffusing simultaneously. We infer preferences using a machine learning algorithm applied to previous adoption decisions, and we match agents using those inferred preferences. We show that ignoring previous adoption decisions leads to significantly overestimating the role of peer influence in the diffusion of information, mistakenly confounding influence-based contagion with diffusion driven by common preferences. Our matching-on-preferences algorithm with machine learning reduces the relative effect of peer influence on item adoption decisions in this network significantly more than matching on earlier adoption decisions, as well other observable characteristics. We also show significant and intuitive heterogeneity in the relative effect of peer influence."
https://openalex.org/W3005469290,"The service quality and system dependability of real-time communication networks strongly depends on the analysis of monitored data, to identify concrete problems and their causes. Many of these can be described by either their structural or temporal properties, or a combination of both. As current research is short of approaches sufficiently addressing both properties simultaneously, we propose a new feature space specifically suited for this task, which we analyze for its theoretical properties and its practical relevance. We evaluate its classification performance when used on real-world data sets of structural-temporal mobile communication data, and compare it to the performance achieved of feature representations used in related work. For this purpose we propose a system which allows the automatic detection and prediction of classes of pre-defined sequence behavior, greatly reducing costs caused by the otherwise required manual analysis. With our proposed feature spaces this system achieves a precision of more than 93% at recall values of 100%, with an up to 6.7% higher effective recall than otherwise similarly performing alternatives, notably outperforming alternative deep learning, kernel learning and ensemble learning approaches of related work. Furthermore the supported system calibration allows separating reliable from unreliable predictions more effectively, which is highly relevant for any practical application."
