https://openalex.org/W2029004784,"We have cloned the platelet collagen receptor glycoprotein (GP) VI from a human bone marrow cDNA library using rapid amplification of cDNA ends with platelet mRNA to complete the 5′ end sequence. GPVI was isolated from platelets using affinity chromatography on the snake C-type lectin, convulxin, as a critical step. Internal peptide sequences were obtained, and degenerate primers were designed to amplify a fragment of the GPVI cDNA, which was then used as a probe to screen the library. Purified GPVI, as well as Fab fragments of polyclonal antibodies made against the receptor, inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation. The GPVI receptor cDNA has an open reading frame of 1017 base pairs coding for a protein of 339 amino acids including a putative 23-amino acid signal sequence and a 19-amino acid transmembrane domain between residues 247 and 265. GPVI belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily, and its sequence is closely related to FcαR and to the natural killer receptors. Its extracellular chain has two Ig-C2-like domains formed by disulfide bridges. An arginine residue is found in position 3 of the transmembrane portion, which should permit association with Fcγ and its immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif via a salt bridge. With 51 amino acids, the cytoplasmic tail is relatively long and shows little homology to the C-terminal part of the other family members. The ability of the cloned GPVI cDNA to code for a functional platelet collagen receptor was demonstrated in the megakaryocytic cell line Dami. Dami cells transfected with GPVI cDNA mobilized intracellular Ca2+ in response to collagen, unlike the nontransfected or mock transfected Dami cells, which do not respond to collagen.

Collagen is one of the major components of the vessel wall responsible for platelet activation. Many types of collagen exist, and seven of these are found in the subendothelial layers. Several different receptors for collagen have been identified on platelets including CD36 (1Matsuno K. Diaz-Ricart M. Montgomery R.R. Aster R.H. Jamieson G.A. Tandon N.N. Br. J. Haematol. 1996; 92: 960-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and a p65 collagen type I specific receptor (2Chiang T.M. Rinaldy A. Kang A.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 514-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), but the major ones are now considered to be the integrin α2β1and the nonintegrin glycoprotein (GP)1 IV. Although α2β1 is well characterized and both subunits were cloned and sequenced several years ago (3Argraves W.S. Suzuki S. Arai H. Thompson K. Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1183-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 4Takada Y. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), the structure of GPVI has remained elusive; however, several features have been identified. It was determined about 20 years ago that GPVI is a major platelet glycoprotein with a molecular mass in the 60–65-kDa range and an acid pI (5Clemetson K.J. McGregor J.L. James E. Dechavanne M. Luscher E.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1982; 70: 304-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Its role as a putative collagen receptor was established following the identification of a patient in Japan with a mild bleeding disorder whose platelets had a specific defect in response to collagen and lacked this receptor (6Moroi M. Jung S.M. Okuma M. Shinmyozu K. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1440-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). This patient had also developed autoantibodies to the deficient receptor, and these were used to characterize the molecule further (7Sugiyama T. Okuma M. Ushikubi F. Sensaki S. Kanaji K. Uchino H. Blood. 1987; 69: 1712-1720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently it was established that GPVI is associated noncovalently with the common Fcγ subunit, which acts as the signaling part of the complex (8Gibbins J.M. Okuma M. Farndale R. Barnes M. Watson S.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 9Tsuji M. Ezumi Y. Arai M. Takayama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23528-23531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). It was also demonstrated that the recognition sequence on collagen for GPVI is a repeated Gly-Pro-Hyp triplet within the collagen triple helical structure and that synthetic peptides based on this structure could be used as specific GPVI-directed agonists (10Morton L.F. McCulloch I.Y. Barnes M.J. Thromb. Res. 1993; 72: 367-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The GPVI-Fcγ complex was shown to signal to the platelet interior by an immune receptor-like mechanism, involving activation of p72SYK and leading by a cascade of kinase-phosphatase-adaptor protein interactions to activation of PLCγ2 and hence to release of granule contents and to platelet aggregation (11Asselin J. Gibbins J.M. Achison M. Lee Y.H. Morton L.F. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. Watson S.P. Blood. 1997; 89: 1235-1242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A further step in characterization of this molecule was the demonstration that the snake C-type lectin, convulxin, from the tropical rattlesnake, Crotalus durissus terrificuswas able to activate platelets by clustering GPVI through a multimeric interaction (12Polgar J. Clemetson J.M. Kehrel B.E. Wiedemann M. Magnenat E.M. Wells T.N.C. Clemetson K.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 27035-27041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Convulxin was shown to bind specifically to GPVI, providing a tool for purification of this receptor in conjunction with established approaches. Using this method we have now purified amounts of GPVI adequate for preliminary characterization and for peptide sequencing. The sequences were used to design primers for PCR to identify a positive sequence in a cDNA library. This DNA sequence was then used as a probe to isolate an almost complete cDNA sequence from the library, and the missing 5′-sequence was obtained using a RACE method on platelet RNA. Protein A-Sepharose, peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies, bovine serum albumin, C. durissus terrificus venom, wheat germ agglutinin,N-hydroxysuccinimidyl chloroformate-activated cross-linked 4% beaded agarose, Triton X-114, puromycin, and fura 2-AM were from Sigma. Octyl-N-methylglucamide and nonanoyl-N-methylglucamide were from Oxyl Chemie (Bobingen, Germany). Convulxin was isolated from C. durissus terrificusvenom as described previously (12Polgar J. Clemetson J.M. Kehrel B.E. Wiedemann M. Magnenat E.M. Wells T.N.C. Clemetson K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13576-13583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The human megakaryocytic leukemic cell line Dami was kindly provided by Dr. S. M. Greenberg. Methylated collagen Type I was a kind gift from Dr. B. Kehrel. Membrane glycoproteins were isolated from platelets by a variant of a previously described method (14Wicki A.N. Clemetson J.M. Steiner B. Schnippering W. Clemetson K.J. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 215: 276-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, platelets (from 40 buffy coats) were washed and lysed in 2% Triton X-114 in the presence of protease inhibitors. The Triton X-114 and aqueous phases were separated, and the detergent phase was loaded on a column of wheat germ agglutinin coupled to Sepharose 4B. The platelet glycoproteins were eluted with 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 30 mm NaCl, 0.2% octyl-N-methylglucamide, and 2%N-acetylglucosamine. After dialysis and concentration, the solution of glycoproteins was loaded on a column of convulxin bound toN-hydroxylsuccinamidyl-p-nitrophenyl chloroformate activated cross-linked 4% beaded agarose (1 mg/ml). The column was washed with 4 volumes of 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 30 mm NaCl, 0.2% nonanoyl-N-methylglucamide and then with 4 volumes of 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 30 mm NaCl, and 2% nonanoyl-N-methylglucamide. GPVI was eluted with 0.08% SDS in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4. The solution was concentrated and loaded on a preparative gel of 8.5% polyacrylamide using the model 491 Prep Cell (Bio-Rad). The preparative electrophoresis was performed under nonreduced conditions following the manufacturer's instructions. GPVI eluted as a single band at 65 kDa. The fractions were pooled, concentrated on Centricon-30 (Amicon, Beverly, MA) and resuspended in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.1% octyl-N-methylglucamide. GPVI was digested with the endoproteinases LysC and AspN (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The 10 peptides generated were separated by reverse-phase HPLC and sequenced on an Applied Biosystem model 477A pulsed liquid phase protein sequencer with a model 120A on-line phenylthiohydantoin amino acid analyzer. A sample (1010plaque-forming units) from a human bone marrow library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was amplified using two combinations of four degenerate primers. The final primer concentrations were 2 μm, the dNTP concentration was 200 μm and 2 units/100-μl reaction AmpliTaq Gold (Perkin-Elmer) were used. The PCR conditions were 5 cycles at 37 °C followed by 30 cycles at 44 °C. The sense 19-mer 5′-TYATHCCNGCNATGAARMG-3′ and the antisense 20-mer 5′-TTRTANARNGCRAAYTGRTC-3′ amplified a 221-bp fragment that was subcloned in Bluescript KS+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and sequenced using the T7 Sequenase kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The 221-bp fragment was cut from the plasmid, cleaned, and labeled with [α-32P]ATP (Hartmann Analytik, Braunschweig, Germany) using the High Prime Labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The human bone marrow library was screened following the supplier's instructions. Positive phages were grown, and their DNA were isolated and subcloned in Bluescript using eitherEcoRI or SalI sites and sequenced on an ABI Prism automated sequencer. Platelet poly(A) RNA was prepared as described previously (15Power C.A. Clemetson J.M. Clemetson K.J. Wells T.N. Cytokine. 1995; 7: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription (30 μl) was performed using 5 μg of poly(A) RNA with the primer 5′-TGAATGAGACGGTCAGTTCAGC-3′ (20 μm), dNTP (1 mm), RNAsin (40 U), 1× avian myeloblastosis virus buffer, and 20 units avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 20 min at 45 °C followed by 20 min at 52 °C. The reaction mixture was treated with 2 μl of 6 n NaOH at 65 °C for 30 min, neutralized with 2 μl of 6 n acetic acid, and concentrated in a Microcon 30 (Amicon, Beverly, MA). An anchor was ligated to the first strand DNA following the protocol of Aptes and Siebert (16Aptes A.N. Siebert P.D. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 890-893PubMed Google Scholar). Nested PCR was performed using a primer complementary to the anchor and the primer 5′-TTGTACAGAGCAAATTGGTC-3′ (35 cycles at 55 °C) and followed by the primer 5′-GACCAGAGGCTTCCGTTCTG-3′ (30 cycles at 53 °C). The highest band (350 bp) was separated by agarose electrophoresis from the lower ones, subcloned into Bluescript, and sequenced. Polyclonal antibodies against human GPVI were prepared in rabbits. IgG was purified from rabbit anti-GPVI antiserum by (NH4)2SO4 precipitation. Digestion of IgG with immobilized papain (Pierce) to generate Fab fragments was performed according to the standard protocol of the supplier. Fab fragments were separated from undigested IgG and Fc fragments using an immobilized protein A column. The flow-through was transferred to a dialysis tube, concentrated using solid polyethylene glycol 20,000, intensively dialyzed against 140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and stored at 4 °C until used. F(ab′)2 fragments were prepared by digestion of IgG with pepsin, 1:50 enzyme to substrate ratio (w/w), in 0.5 m acetate buffer, pH 4.0, at 37 °C for 18 h. The pH was corrected to 7.4 with diluted NaOH, and the sample was dialyzed against 20 mm phosphate, pH 7.4. F(ab′)2 fragments were separated from undigested IgG and Fc fragments using protein A chromatography. The flow-through was transferred to a dialysis tube, concentrated using solid polyethylene glycol 20,000, intensively dialyzed against 140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and stored in aliquots at −20 °C. The λ DNA coding for GPVI was cloned into Bluescript as a SalI insert. The plasmid was cut with BamHI and SstI, and the band corresponding to 1700 bp was isolated from an agarose gel and cleaned. A 350-bp fragment amplified by RACE with the sense 5′-TTCGGATCCCAGGGCTGAGGAACCATGTC-3′ and the antisense 5′-AAACTCCCGTGGCAACGAGC-3′ primers was cut with SstI and isolated in the same way. The DNA pieces were ligated, and the product of ligation was subcloned in Bluescript and sequenced. The cDNA for GPVI was introduced into the expression vector SRαpuro (provided by Dr. F. Arenzana-Seisdedos, Pasteur Institute, Paris, France) (17Roos R.S. Loetscher M. Legler D.F. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17251-17254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) as aBamHI fragment. For the murine 300-19 cells, 20 μg of linearized vector was transfected by electroporation, and transfectants were grown in the presence of 1.5 μg/ml puromycin and screened by flow cytometry with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled convulxin. The cells were tested with agonists for elevation of intracellular Ca2+, using fura-2 fluorescence. The SRαpuroGPVI construct described above was used for transfection into Dami cells. In addition, the GPVI cDNA was introduced in the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands). Transfection was performed with Effectene reagent (Quiagen AG, Basle, Switzerland). Dami cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Biological Industries, Kibbutz Beit Haemek, Israel) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. 1 day before transfection, the cells in suspension were centrifuged and resuspended at 105 cells/ml in a new bottle. 1 h before transfection, the cells were seeded at 1.5 × 106 cells/ml in 5.4 ml of RPMI medium, without serum in Petri dishes. pcDNA3/GPVI DNA (2 μg), SRαpuro/GPVI DNA (2 μg), or empty vectors, transfection reagents, and RPMI without serum were mixed and added to the cells following the supplier's instructions. After 36 h, the cells were harvested and tested for their response to agonists. Nontransfected and transfected Dami cells were harvested 36 h after transfection and washed with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 4.8 mm KCl, 136 mm NaCl, 5 mm glucose, and 4 mmCaCl2, and 107 cells were resuspended in 400 μl of the same buffer and incubated with 2.5 μmfura-2AM for 30 min at 37 °C. Agonist was added to 2.5 × 106 cells, and fura-2 fluorescence was measured. Washed platelets were lysed in Triton X-114, and phase separation was performed on the soluble material before isolating the membrane glycoproteins associated with the Triton X-114 phase by affinity chromatography on wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose 4B as described previously (14Wicki A.N. Clemetson J.M. Steiner B. Schnippering W. Clemetson K.J. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 215: 276-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Because GPVI represents a very small fraction of the platelet membrane glycoprotein pool, the specificity of the snake C-type lectin convulxin was used for isolation of this receptor. Affinity chromatography on convulxin coupled to agarose yielded as major components 65- and 60-kDa proteins corresponding respectively to intact GPVI and its proteolytic fragment (Fig.1, A and B). Minor amounts of uncharacterized material of higher molecular mass, which co-eluted with GPVI, could not be removed by extensive washing of the column. Therefore, preparative gel electrophoresis on 8.5% polyacrylamide was used as a final step of purification. Fractions containing the 65-kDa band of GPVI were pooled and gave a single band on reanalysis (Fig. 1 C). Purified GPVI was tested for its ability to block platelet aggregation by collagen. The GPVI was dissolved in 10 mm Tris/HCl containing 0.1% octyl-N-methylglucamide, which is a very mild detergent and did not affect either the ability of collagen to activate platelets (data not shown) or platelets to be activated by agonists. A slight inhibitory effect was observed when aliquots (0.5 μg) of GPVI solution were added to the platelet suspension before adding collagen (1 μg) (Fig. 2). However, when GPVI was preincubated with collagen before adding the mixture to the platelet suspension, aggregation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. These platelets still aggregated when fresh collagen was added (not shown), indicating that the GPVI had bound to the first collagen. The purified GPVI was used to prepare in rabbits polyclonal antibodies that recognized a single band in blots from whole platelet lysate at 65 kDa (Fig. 1 B). Fab fragments of these antibodies inhibited collagen aggregation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.2).Figure 2Platelet aggregation by collagen in the presence of anti-GPVI Fab fragment or GPVI. Tracing a, collagen control (1 μg); tracing b, 40 μg anti-GPVI Fab;tracing c, 60 μg of anti-GPVI Fab; tracing d, GPVI (0.5 μg) was added to the platelet suspension 1 min before collagen (1 μg); tracing e, GPVI (0.5 μg) was preincubated with collagen (1 μg) for 1 min before addition to the platelet suspension.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Under nonreducing conditions, the isolated protein has a molecular mass of 62 kDa with a shift toward a slightly higher molecular mass (65 kDa) under reducing conditions. Because the intact protein did not give a sequence on Edman digestion, it was assumed that the N terminus of GPVI was blocked. Therefore, the protein was digested with the endoproteases LysC and LysC/AspN producing 4 and 6 peptides, respectively, from which sequence was obtained. The peptides were separated by reverse phase HPLC on a C4 column and sequenced by the Edman method. Two sequences of 7 amino acids showing the least degeneracy in the genetic code were selected for the synthesis of DNA primers to amplify part of the GPVI cDNA by PCR. Because the positions of both peptides in the protein were totally unknown, for each of them, two degenerate primers, one sense and one antisense, were prepared. These primers were used to amplify a human bone marrow library. The combination of the sense 5′-TYATHCCNGCNATGAARMG-3′ primer coding for the sequence PAMKRSL with the antisense 5′-TTRTANARNGCRAAYTGRTC-3′ one corresponding to DQFALYK amplified a DNA fragment of 221 bp. In addition to the selected peptides, the amplified DNA coded for the LysC/AspN peptide DQLELVATGVFAKPSLSAQPGPAVSS, clearly linking the sequence to the cDNA for GPVI. Screening 600,000 plaque-forming units from a bone marrow library with this 221-bp DNA fragment produced four positive plaques. Three had inserts of 1350 bp when cut by the restriction enzymes SalI or EcoRI and belonged to the IgG superfamily. The fourth one had a 4.6-kb insert by SalI digestion and gave two fragments of 2300 and 1300 bp, respectively when treated by EcoRI. Its DNA encoded protein sequence including the sequences of the 10 peptides derived from amino acid sequencing of GPVI but stopped short of the N terminus. No starting methionine or leader sequence could be found, but more than 2000 bp of previously sequenced (on data base) nonreading frame DNA, terminating in an Alu sequence, were present. The 5′ end RACE experiment was completed on platelet poly(A) RNA with primers located in a part of the GPVI sequence, which had been corroborated by that of the peptides. A fragment of 348 bp including 58 bp new on the sequence of the fourth clone at bp 1987 corresponding to 14 amino acids including the first methionine were found before falling back on the established GPVI sequence. The SalI DNA insert was isolated from the fourth clone. A 1700-bp fragment was generated bySstI and ligated with the DNA amplified by RACE. Thus, a cDNA containing a total of 2001 bp together with the complete 3′-untranslated region and with an open reading frame of 1017 bp coding for a protein including leader sequence with 339 amino acids could be sequenced. All the amino acid sequences from the peptides were present and are shaded in the translated cDNA sequence (Figs.3 and 4). In a first approach, the cloned GPVI collagen receptor was expressed in the murine pre-B cell line 300-19. Stable transfectants, which expressed GPVI on their surface, were obtained. However, neither elevation of cytoplasmic Ca2+ nor the activation of a kinase cascade could be detected when the cells were treated with collagen or convulxin. Then Dami cells were chosen because they synthesized a very small amount of mRNA for GPVI, which was detectable using reverse transcription PCR with GPVI-specific primers. Flow cytometry using the rabbit polyclonal anti-GPVI antibodies or fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled convulxin revealed traces of the glycoprotein on the cell surface. Furthermore, a weak increase of [Ca2+]i was observed when the cells were treated with convulxin but was never detected with collagen as agonist. Transfection was performed with both vectors pcDNA3/GPVIDNA and SRαpuro/GPVIDNA. As expected, in relation to the strength of the promoter, the cells transfected with SRαpuro gave a stronger signal than those transfected with pcDNA3. The [Ca2+]i elevation induced by thrombin was used as a standard reference between transfected, mock transfected and nontransfected cells. As shown in Fig. 5the transfected Dami cells responded to collagen (Fig. 5 A), whereas the mock transfected cells, like the nontransfected cells did not (Fig. 5 B). The [Ca2+]i elevation elicited by convulxin (0.1 μg/ml) in the transfected cells was more than twice that in the nontransfected ones and comparable with the signal induced by 1 unit of thrombin. Addition of saturating amounts of anti-GPVI IgG to the transfected cells before collagen totally inhibited the increase of cytoplasmic Ca2+ by this agonist. The results shown here are typical of those with cells from three transfection experiments with this amount of DNA.Figure 4Alignment of the GPVI amino acid sequence with the most similar molecules from the SwissProt data bank.

A, cells were transfected with SRαpuro/GPVIDNA loaded with fura-2 and activated with different agonists. The conditions were as follows: control, 1 unit thrombin; 5 μg of collagen; 0.1 μg of convulxin. Dami cells were incubated with a saturating amount of anti-GPVI IgG before addition of 5 μg of collagen. B, Dami cells were mock transfected with SRαpuro and activated with the same agonists.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A method was developed for the isolation of the platelet GPVI collagen receptor from platelets by affinity chromatography and preparative gel electrophoresis. The isolated protein was used to produce polyclonal antibodies and was also tested for its effects on collagen-induced platelet aggregation. When GPVI was added to a platelet suspension followed by collagen it had only a minor effect on the rate of aggregation. However, when GPVI was incubated together with collagen and the mixture was then added to platelets, there was a dose-dependent reduction in the platelet response compared with that induced by collagen incubated with buffer. This demonstrates that the soluble GPVI binds to and blocks the GPVI-binding sites on collagen preventing the collagen from interacting with GPVI on platelets and thereby activating them. The IgG from polyclonal antibodies to GPVI as well as F(ab′)2 fragments strongly activated platelets, as previously reported for human alloantibodies to GPVI (7Sugiyama T. Okuma M. Ushikubi F. Sensaki S. Kanaji K. Uchino H. Blood. 1987; 69: 1712-1720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fab fragments of these antibodies were capable of inhibiting collagen-induced platelet aggregation when they were preincubated with the platelets, again demonstrating that GPVI collagen interactions are necessary for platelet aggregation by collagen (Fig. 2). A cDNA coding for platelet GPVI was cloned and sequenced from a human bone marrow cDNA library using RACE with platelet mRNA to supply missing 5′ sequence. The cDNA contains an open reading frame of 1017 bp encoding 339 amino acids and an untranslated 3′ region. Hydrophobicity analysis of the amino acid sequence revealed the presence of two putative hydrophobic domains, a putative 23-amino acid signal sequence and a 19-amino acid transmembrane domain between residues 247 and 265 of the mature protein. The sequence and its amino acid translation are shown in Fig. 3. A comparison with the amino acid sequence of the most similar molecules found in a search of SwissProt is shown in Fig. 4. GPVI clearly belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily, and the extracellular domain contains two Ig C2-domain loops formed by two disulfide bridges. It is a transmembrane class one molecule with the N terminus at the exterior and traverses the membrane once. The most closely related molecules in the SwissProt data base are the Fcα receptor, a mouse mast cell receptor, and both inhibitory and activatory members of the natural killer (NK) receptor class. GPVI clearly belongs to the activatory subclass not only through its function but also because unlike the inhibitory class it has no immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs in its cytoplasmic domain. Nor does it contain any tyrosine residues that could be phosphorylated. There are some threonine and serine residues in this C-terminal region, but they do not match any kinase consensus sequences. Like the Fcα receptor and some of the NK activatory class of receptors, GPVI contains a charged amino acid in the transmembrane domain. An arginine residue in position 3 of the transmembrane domain is postulated to form a salt bridge to an aspartic acid residue in the transmembrane domain of the Fcγ subunit, which, expressing immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs, initiates signal transduction upon phosphorylation. The cytoplasmic tail comprises 51 amino acids, showing only minor similarities (in the region just below the membrane) to the cytoplasmic domains of other members of this family. This suggests that this region in GPVI may associate with different types of cytoplasmic molecules than the other family members. GPVI contains only a single putative N-glycosylation site at Asn69. However, there is a short sequence just above the membrane, before the β pleated sheets of the Ig domain finish, that contains a mucin-like region rich in threonine and serine residues. These could provide O-glycosylation sites such as are found in GPIbα and GPV. The main function of thisO-glycosylation in the other receptors seems to be to extend the receptor structures out from the platelet surface to facilitate the interactions with their bulky ligands and to protect against proteolysis. Because GPVI was earlier established to be a sialoglycoprotein, the difference in molecular mass between the theoretical amino acid mass (37 kDa) and the mass determined by gel electrophoresis (65 kDa reduced) must be due to this glycosylation. GPVI is therefore the third platelet receptor with no direct immune function belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily together with ICAM-2 (CD102) and PECAM (CD31). To provide the evidence that the cloned GPVI is really the collagen receptor expressed on platelets, the cDNA was transfected into cell lines. Surface expression might be expected to modify the collagen binding properties of the transfected cell. However, to be functional and transduce a signal after binding collagen not only does GPVI have to be present but also the necessary signal transducing molecules, including Fcγ, which is needed to link GPVI to several pathways (8Gibbins J.M.

As a first trial we used a mouse pre-B cell line that has been widely described in expression and Ca2+ mobilization studies and that should contain many of the signaling molecules required. Although this cell line when transfected with GPVI cDNA expressed this receptor as detected by anti-GPVI antibodies, no Ca2+ signal was measured after activation with collagen or convulxin. As an alternative we therefore selected the Dami cell line, which is a well differentiated megakaryocyte-like line that responds to several platelet agonists. In particular Dami has been shown to express α2β1 but does not show a Ca2+transient in response to collagen, suggesting that collagen receptors or signaling molecules are deficient (18Strouse R.J. Daniel J.L. Thromb. Res. 1996; 82: 485-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Several authors found that Dami adheres to collagen, indicating that the problem might lie with GPVI (18Strouse R.J. Daniel J.L. Thromb. Res. 1996; 82: 485-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 19Zutter M.M. Painter A.A. Staatz W.D. Tsung Y.L. Blood. 1995; 86: 3006-3014Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, we found that Dami responded weakly to convulxin. In addition, traces of GPVI mRNA were detected by reverse transcription PCR. When transfected with GPVI cDNA, the Dami line showed a marked increase in response to convulxin and now gave a clear response to collagen, indicating that the signaling machinery was present and capable of transducing signals from the transfected GPVI. Presumably the traces of GPVI present in the untransfected cells were not enough for a detectable response from collagen, which is a weaker agonist for GPVI than convulxin. Although the GPVI-Fcγ complex resembles immune cell receptors and their signaling pathways have much in common, not all the molecules involved have been identified. Therefore it is possible that nonmegakaryocytic cells lack critical components. Signaling by the transfected Dami cells in response to collagen was completely blocked by antibodies to GPVI, again demonstrating that, as in platelets (7Sugiyama T. Okuma M. Ushikubi F. Sensaki S. Kanaji K. Uchino H. Blood. 1987; 69: 1712-1720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Coller B.S. Beer J.H. Scudder L.E. Steinberg M.H. Blood. 1989; 74: 182-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), blocking one receptor is sufficient to prevent collagen-induced activation. The structure of NK receptors of the two domain type has been established by x-ray crystallographic studies (21Fan Q.R. Mosyak L. Winter C.C. Wagtmann N. Long E.O. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1997; 389: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and the two Ig-like domains were shown to form an angle with the receptor site for the peptide-carrying HLA antigens lying on the outside of the elbow. A comparison of the structure of the HLA peptide-binding site with that of collagen immediately suggests that these receptors have a common origin because the multiple α-helical structures of the HLA-binding site and the peptide it contains strongly resemble the triple helical structure of collagen. The sites recognized by the NK receptor include the parts of the HLA structure binding the peptide. The NK receptors are postulated to work by a dimerization mechanism with two receptors recognizing two separate HLA sites on the cell with which the NK cell interacts. Possibly this dimerization is part of the activation or deactivation mechanism, depending on the class of receptor. In the case of GPVI, cross-linking of two or more molecules by collagen may also be the critical mechanism. All of the signaling subunits of these types of receptors whether Fcγ, ζ, or the activating NK receptor subunit DAP12 are dimers, suggesting that they may be associated with two ligand-binding subunits, although the stoichiometry is not known. Thus, there may also be the possibility for two GPVI molecules to associate with one Fcγ, because each monomer of the Fcγ dimer has a recognition sequence. Based upon the structure of collagens, collagen-like peptides that act via GPVI, and convulxin, it seems likely that the strength of the signal is related to the number of GPVI-Fcγ complexes that are clustered together. Recent research has emphasized that polymorphisms in platelet collagen receptor α2β1 that cause differences in the level of expression of this receptor may have an important role in susceptibility to cardiovascular problems (22Moshfegh K. Wuillemin W.A. Redondo M. Lammle B. Beer J.H. Liechti-Gallati S. Meyer B.J. Lancet. 1999; 353: 351-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 23Santoso S. Kunicki T.J. Kroll H. Haberbosch W. Gardemann A. Blood. 1999; 93: 2449-2453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was earlier shown that platelets lacking GPVI do not adhere to collagen, although they express α2β1 normally (6Moroi M. Jung S.M. Okuma M. Shinmyozu K. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1440-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). While much remains to be learned about the mechanisms involved, this suggests that synergy between these receptors is critical for the platelet response to this agonist. Thus, not only α2β1 but also GPVI should be considered an attractive target for controlling platelet reactivity as an alternative strategy to GPIIb-IIIa inhibitors. The cloning and sequencing of GPVI should provide the basis for a detailed analysis of its role in platelet response to various types of collagen as well as the molecular mechanism of its interaction with collagen. In addition, the purification of GPVI and the possibility of preparing the recombinant molecule should activate the search for pharmacologically effective inhibitors as an approach to the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disorders.

The MMP family includes collagenases, gelatinases, stromelysins, membrane-type metalloproteinases, matrilysin, and metalloelastase. A hallmark of invasive tumors is their ability to degrade the surrounding extracellular matrix, resulting in a compromised matrix organization and disruption of tissue boundaries. A number of in vitroand in vivo studies have documented a direct correlation between high levels of expression of MMP and an increased invasive capacity of tumor cell lines (1Stetler-Stevenson W.G.

Cancer Lett. 1996; 103: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A number of strategies have been utilized to modulate MMP-2 expression/activity, then assess subsequent changes in invasive potential. The MMP-2 proenzyme is activated by cell surface-associated membrane-type metalloproteinases (21Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2373) Google Scholar, 22Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). Transfection of U251.3 glioma cells with membrane-type metalloproteinases-1 leads to activation of the MMP-2 proenzyme and enhanced invasion as assessed by Matrigel assay (23Deryugina E.I. Luo G.-X. Reisfeld R.A. Bourdon M.A. Strongin A. Anticancer Res. 1997; 17: 3201-3210PubMed Google Scholar), as well as remodeling of the extracellular matrix in vitro (24Deryugina E. Bourdon M. Reisfeld R. Strongin A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3743-3750PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that two cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ, inhibit MMP-2 expression in glioma cells, which results in decreased invasiveness of these cells (15Qin H. Moellinger J.D. Wells A. Windsor L.J. Sun Y. Benveniste E.N. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6664-6673PubMed Google Scholar). Collectively, these results highlight the important role of MMP-2 in the invasive potential of astroglioma cells. The activity of MMP-2 is regulated by several mechanisms, including gene expression, proenzyme activation by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 and membrane-type metalloproteinases, and inhibition of enzyme activity by naturally occurring tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (for review, see Refs. 25Mauviel A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 53: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 26Ries C. Petrides P.E. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1995; 376: 345-355PubMed Google Scholar, 27Yu A.E. Hewitt R.E. Kleiner D.E. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 823-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Historically, the MMP-2 gene has been considered refractory to modulation, either inhibition or enhancement, due to a lack of well characterized regulatory elements in the MMP-2 promoter (for review, see Ref. 25Mauviel A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 53: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). However, sequence analysis of the MMP-2 promoter has revealed a number of potential cis-acting regulatory elements including p53, AP-1, Ets-1, C/EBP, CREB, PEA3, Sp1, and AP-2 that could be involved in regulation of MMP-2 expression (see Fig. 2). The human MMP-2 promoter lacks a typical TATA box but has a relatively GC-rich region in the proximal region. Limited functional analysis of the MMP-2 promoter has been performed. An enhancer sequence of 42 bp located at −1635 bp relative to the transcription initiation start site in the human MMP-2 promoter has been identified in HT1080 cells (human fibrosarcoma line) (28Frisch S.M. Morisaki J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6524-6532Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This enhancer region-2 (r2) was identified as an AP-2 binding sequence, allowing for several mismatches and gaps (28Frisch S.M. Morisaki J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6524-6532Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that AP-2 is an important transcription factor for activation of the MMP-2 promoter, and that adenovirus EIA represses MMP-2 gene expression by targeting AP-2 (29Somasundaram K. Jayaraman G. Williams T. Moran E. Frisch S. Thimmapaya B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3088-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A silencer sequence at −1629 bp has also been functionally documented (28Frisch S.M. Morisaki J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6524-6532Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Recently, a p53-binding site at −1649 to −1630 bp (20 bp) has been identified which specifically binds the p53 protein and plays an important role in constitutive MMP-2 gene expression in human sarcoma cell lines (30Bian J. Sun Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6330-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the p53-binding site is localized within the enhancer region-2 (r2); however, Bian and Sun (30Bian J. Sun Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6330-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) did not detect AP-2 binding in this region, only that of p53. No information is available regarding any other potential functional cis-acting elements in the MMP-2 promoter. The constitutive expression and regulation of the MMP-2 gene is cell- and stimulus-specific (15Qin H. Moellinger J.D. Wells A. Windsor L.J. Sun Y. Benveniste E.N. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6664-6673PubMed Google Scholar, 30Bian J. Sun Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6330-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 31Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Mertens P.R. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18786-18796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus far, the molecular basis of MMP-2 gene expression in human astroglioma cells has not been addressed. In order to determine the sequence requirements for MMP-2 gene transcription, we utilized 5′-deletional MMP-2 reporter constructs in transcriptional activation studies. This approach, in conjunction with site-directed mutagenesis of the human MMP-2 promoter region, demonstrated that a Sp1 site spanning −91 to −84 bp and an AP-2 element at −61 to −53 bp are critical for constitutive expression of the MMP-2 gene in astroglioma cells. The p53/r2 elements identified as important for MMP-2 promoter activity in other cells are non-functional in astroglioma cells. We further defined DNA-protein complexes involved in MMP-2 transcription by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). The transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3 both bind to the Sp1 element, while AP-2 binds to the AP-2 element. Furthermore, co-transfection experiments into mammalian cells lacking AP-2 and insect cells that lack Sp factors demonstrate that Sp1, Sp3, and AP-2 are all functionally important for constitutive expression of the MMP-2 gene.

Schneider Drosophilia 2 (SL2) cells were grown in Schneider's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% FBS at 25 °C. Polyclonal antisera against Sp1, Sp3, and AP-2 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Gelatin was purchased from Sigma. Mouse anti-human MMP-2 monoclonal antibody was the generous gift of Dr. J. Engler, The University of Alabama at Birmingham. The secondary peroxidase-conjugated antibodies and ECL reagents were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Zymography was performed as described previously (15Qin H. Moellinger J.D. Wells A. Windsor L.J. Sun Y. Benveniste E.N. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6664-6673PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, astroglioma cell lines cells were incubated until ∼80% confluent, then the medium was aspirated and fresh serum-free medium added to the dish. Supernatants were collected after a 48-h incubation and concentrated. Concentrated supernatants (750 μl) were mixed with SDS sample buffer without reducing agent, and proteins subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 8% polyacrylamide gels that were copolymerized with 1 mg/ml gelatin. After electrophoresis, the gels were washed several times in 2.5% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature to remove the SDS, and then incubated for 24–48 h at 37 °C in buffer containing 5 mm CaCl2 and 1 μmZnCl2. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue (0.25%) for 30 min, then destained for 1 h in a solution of acetic acid and methanol. The proteolytic activity was evidenced as clear bands (zones of gelatin degradation) against the blue background of stained gelatin. The same supernatants were used in immunoblot analysis for MMP-2 protein. Proteins were detected using anti-MMP-2 antibody (5 μg/ml) as described previously (15Qin H. Moellinger J.D. Wells A. Windsor L.J. Sun Y. Benveniste E.N. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6664-6673PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were washed four times in TBS with 0.01% Tween 20, and subsequently incubated in sheep anti-mouse peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1:3000) in antibody dilution buffer. ECL reagents were used for development. Total RNA was isolated from confluent monolayers of astroglioma cell lines that had been incubated in serum-free medium for 24 h (15Qin H. Moellinger J.D. Wells A. Windsor L.J. Sun Y. Benveniste E.N. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6664-6673PubMed Google Scholar). Human MMP-2 cDNA (gift of Dr. W. G. Stetler-Stevenson, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD) was digested with SacI/PstI, and a 324-bp fragment corresponding to 1500–1824 nucleotides was subcloned into the SacI/PstI polylinker site of the pGEM4Z vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The construct was linearized byEcoRI and used to generate a radiolabeled antisense RNA probe of 354 nucleotides with T7 RNA polymerase. A pAMP-1 vector containing a fragment of the human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA (corresponding to 43–531 nucleotides) was linearized with NcoI, and used to generate a radiolabeled antisense RNA probe of 290 nucleotides with T7 polymerase. Fifteen μg of total RNA was hybridized with MMP-2 (50 × 103 cpm) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (25 × 103 cpm) riboprobes at 42 °C overnight. The hybridized mixture was then treated with RNase A/T1 (1:200) at room temperature for 1 h, analyzed by 5% denaturing (8 m urea) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the gels were exposed to x-ray film. The protected fragments of the MMP-2 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase riboprobes are 324 and 230 bp in length. A luciferase reporter plasmid driven by 1659 bp of the human MMP-2 promoter was used in this study, and is referred to as wild type (WT) (30Bian J. Sun Y. Mol. Cell.

Serial deletion mutants were synthesized using polymerase chain reaction byPfu DNA polymerase to delete out potential regulatory elements in the MMP-2 promoter, including one p53 site, two silencers, one AP-1 element, four PEA3 elements, two Sp1 elements, and one AP-2 site (see Fig. 2). They are named as follows: D1, which lacks the p53 site; D2, lacking the first silencer element (S1); D3, lacking both silencer elements (S1 and S2); D4, which lacks the AP-1 element; D5, lacking the Ets-1 and c-Myc/c-Myb sites; D6, lacking one PEA3 site and the C/EBP element; D7, lacking the second PEA3 site; D8, which lacks the third PEA3 site, the CREB site, and GCN-His region; D9, lacking the fourth PEA3 site; D10, lacking the first Sp1 element; D11, lacking both Sp1 elements; and D12, which lacks the AP-2 site (see Fig. 3,A and B). The polymerase chain reaction amplification protocol consisted of an initial 1-min melting step at 94 °C, followed by 30 cycles with 40 s melting at 92 °C, 40 s annealing at 60 °C, and 1 min 30 s extension at 75 °C, except for the last cycle which contained a 5-min extension step. The restriction enzyme EcoRI was used to check positive clones and AvaI to verify the correct orientation. The deletion mutants were inserted into the pGL2-Basic vector, which contains the gene for luciferase as reporter, using theKpnI/XhoI restriction site. Site-directed mutagenesis was utilized to mutate potential transcription elements in the proximal sequence (−139 to −7) of the human MMP-2 promoter. 15-bp lengths of DNA in the D3 and D9 reporter constructs were serially mutated to the EcoRV andXbaI restriction enzyme sequence by polymerase chain reaction using QuickChangeTM Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (see Fig. 4). The introduction of mutations was verified by the restriction enzymes EcoRV andXbaI and DNA sequencing. After 18 cycles of polymerase chain reaction by Pfu polymerase at 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 20 min, DpnI was used to digest the parental supercoiled double-stranded DNA. Transformations were performed in Escherichia coli supercompetent cells using DpnI-treated DNA. A total of three site-directed mutants were generated using the D3 and D9 promoter constructs as templates (Fig. 4), and were confirmed by sequencing. They are mSp1A, mSp1B, and mAP-2. As well, constructs containing mutations in both the Sp1A and AP-2 elements were created. Ten μg of the MMP-2 promoter constructs (both MMP-2 deletion and mutation constructs) were co-transfected into human astroglioma cells with 1 μg of the pCMV-β-galactosidase construct into 3 × 106 cells by electroporation with a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser set at 250 V, 960 microfarads, as described previously (15Qin H. Moellinger J.D. Wells A. Windsor L.J. Sun Y. Benveniste E.N. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6664-6673PubMed Google Scholar). After transfection, cells were allowed to recover for 18 h and cultured in 1% FBS/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 medium for 24 h. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 180 μl of lysis buffer containing 25 mm trisphosphate (pH 7.8), 2 mm DTT, 2 mm diaminocyclohexane tetraacetic acid, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100. Extracts were assayed in triplicate for luciferase activity in a volume of 130 μl containing 30 μl of cell extract, 20 mm Tricine, 0.1 mmEDTA, 1 mm magnesium carbonate, 2.67 MgSO4, 33.3 mm DTT, 0.27 mm coenzyme A, 0.47 mm luciferin, and 0.53 mm ATP, and light intensity was measured using a luminometer (Promega, Madison, WI). Luciferase activity was integrated over a 10-s time period. Extracts were also assayed in triplicate for β-galactosidase enzyme activity as described previously (15Qin H. Moellinger J.D. Wells A. Windsor L.J. Sun Y. Benveniste E.N. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6664-6673PubMed Google Scholar). The luciferase activity of each sample was normalized to β-galactosidase activity to calculate relative luciferase activity (RLA) before calculating the fold activation value. For transfection with HepG2 cells, 3 × 106 cells were electroporated with 10 μg of the indicated MMP-2 luciferase promoter constructs, 1 μg of the pCMV-β-galactosidase construct, and 1.0 μg of either the pSX-AP-2 expression vector or pSX control vector (34Wang D. Shin T.H. Kudlow J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14244-14250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). After transfection, cells were allowed to recover for 18 h, changed to serum-free medium for 24 h, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities assayed as described above. For transfection of SL2 cells, 1 day prior to transfection, cells were plated onto 60-mm2 dishes at a density of 4 × 106 cells/plate. Cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method as described previously (35Hagen G. Dennig J. Preiß A. Beato M. Suske G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24989-24994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Each plate received up to 20 μg of DNA including 10 μg of the indicated MMP-2 promoter constructs, and variable amounts of the expression plasmids pPacSp1 and/or pPacUSp3 (36Dennig J. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5659-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Variable amounts of the expression plasmids were adjusted with the control plasmid pPac. The medium was changed 24 h after addition of DNA, and 24 h later the cells were harvested for luciferase activity. Luciferase values were normalized against total protein concentrations determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (37Panek R.B. Lee Y.-J. Lindstrom-Itoh Y. Ting J.P.-Y. Benveniste E.N. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4555-4564PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in 100-mm dishes, allowed to adhere overnight, and then were incubated in serum-free medium for 24 h. Cells were then washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested by scraping, and pelleted. Cells were resuspended in 1 ml of buffer A (10 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.4 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4), incubated on ice for 10 min, and pelleted at 1000 × g for 10 min. Pellets were resuspended in 0.5 ml of buffer A plus 0.1% Nonidet P-40, incubated on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of buffer B (10 mm HEPES, 400 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 15% glycerol, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mmNa3VO4) and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with constant gentle mixing. Nuclei were then pelleted at 40,000 × g for 30 min, and extracts were dialyzed for 2 h at 4 °C against 1 liter of buffer C (20 mm HEPES, 200 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.4 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 15% glycerol, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4). Extracts were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay. EMSA was performed using the following oligonucleotides as probes and/or competitors: the oligonucleotide Sp1A has the sequence 5′-CAGAGAGGGGCGGGCCCGAGTG-3′, corresponding to the human MMP-2 promoter sequence −98 to −76, and the AP-2 oligonucleotide has the sequence 5′-CCCCAGCCCCGCTCTGCCAGCT-3′, and corresponds to the human MMP-2 promoter sequence −66 to −44. The mutant Sp1 oligonucleotide (mSp1A) has the sequence 5′-CAGAtAtctagatGatatcGTG-3′, and the mutant AP-2 oligonucleotide (mAP-2) is 5′-CCgatatCatctagaatCAGCT-3′. Mutations are indicated by lowercase letters. 0.2 ng of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide (20,000 cpm) were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 10 μg of nuclear extract in a volume of 20 μl containing 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2,1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 1 μg of salmon sperm DNA, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). For supershift analysis, 1 μl of antibody was incubated with the nuclear extracts at 4 °C for 30 min in binding buffer, followed by an additional incubation for 30 min at room temperature with labeled oligonucleotide. For competitions, unlabeled DNA was incubated with the nuclear extracts at 4 °C for 20 min before addition of labeled probe. Bound and free DNA were resolved by electrophoresis through a 6% polyacrylamide gel at 250 V in 0.25 × TBE (50 mm Tris-Cl, 2 mm EDTA). Dried gels were exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film at −70 °C with intensifying screens. Four different preparations of nuclear extracts were tested by EMSA. Levels of significance for comparisons between samples were determined using Student's t test distribution. High levels of MMP-2 expression correlate with malignant progression of astrogliomasin vivo (11Nakano A. Tani E. Miyazaki K. Yamamoto Y. Furuyama J.-I. J.

We have recently determined that a variety of human astroglioma cell lines constitutively express high levels of MMP-2, which correlates with the in vitroinvasive capacity of these cells (15Qin H. Moellinger J.D. Wells A. Windsor L.J. Sun Y. Benveniste E.N. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6664-6673PubMed Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1965802230,"Thromboxane A2 is a positive feedback lipid mediator produced following platelet activation. The Gq-coupled thromboxane A2 receptor subtype, TPα, and Gi-coupled TPβ subtype have been shown in human platelets. ADP-induced platelet aggregation requires concomitant signaling from two P2 receptor subtypes, P2Y1 and P2TAC, coupled to Gq and Gi, respectively. We investigated whether the stable thromboxane A2 mimetic, (15S)-hydroxy-9,11-epoxymethanoprosta-5Z,13E-dienoic acid (U46619), also causes platelet aggregation by concomitant signaling through Gq and Gi, through co-activation of TPα and TPβ receptor subtypes. Here we report that secretion blockade with Ro 31-8220, a protein kinase C inhibitor, completely inhibited U46619-induced, but not ADP- or thrombin-induced, platelet aggregation. Ro 31-8220 had no effect on U46619-induced intracellular calcium mobilization or platelet shape change. Furthermore, U46619-induced intracellular calcium mobilization and shape change were unaffected by A3P5P, a P2Y1 receptor-selective antagonist, and/or cyproheptadine, a 5-hydroxytryptamine subtype 2A receptor antagonist. Either Ro 31-8220 or AR-C66096, a P2TACreceptor selective antagonist, abolished U46619-induced inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. In addition, AR-C66096 drastically inhibited U46619-mediated platelet aggregation, which was further inhibited by yohimbine, an α2A-adrenergic receptor antagonist. Furthermore, inhibition of U46619-induced platelet aggregation by Ro 31-8220 was relieved by activation of the Gi pathway by selective activation of either the P2TAC receptor or the α2A-adrenergic receptor. We conclude that whereas thromboxane A2 causes intracellular calcium mobilization and shape change independently, thromboxane A2-induced inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and platelet aggregation depends exclusively upon secretion of other agonists that stimulate Gi-coupled receptors.

Goldyne M. Granstrom E. Hamberg M. Hammarstrom S. Malmsten C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 997-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). The released thromboxane A2 acts as a positive feedback mediator in the activation and recruitment of more platelets to the primary hemostatic plug (2Hourani S.M. Cusack N.J. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 243-298PubMed Google Scholar). Thromboxane A2 exerts its actions via specific G protein-coupled receptors and has been described as either a potent platelet agonist (2Hourani S.M. Cusack N.J. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 243-298PubMed Google Scholar, 3Shen R.F. Tai H.H. J. Biomed.

Cardiol. 1991; 68: 11B-15BAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Pharmacological studies indicate the presence of two potential thromboxane A2 receptor (TP receptor)1 subtypes on human platelets (5Dorn G.W.D. J. Clin.

The TP receptor gene has been cloned and encodes two subtypes of the TP receptor that result from alternative splicing of the primary transcript (7Narumiya S. Hirata N. Namba T. Hayashi Y. Ushikubi F. Sugimoto Y. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. J. Lipid Mediators. 1993; 6: 155-161PubMed Google Scholar). The subtypes share the identical first 293 amino acids but possess different carboxyl-terminal domains. A complete cDNA of the 343 amino acid TPα isoform was isolated from both a placental cDNA library and human megakaryocytic leukemia cells (8Hirata M. Hayashi Y. Ushikubi F. Yokota Y. Kageyama R.

Both the TPα and TPβ subtypes mediate the stimulation of phospholipase C and an increase in intracellular concentrations of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and diacylglycerol. The formation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate induces an increase in the cytosolic concentration of Ca2+, whereas the release of diacylglycerol activates PKC (13Brass L.F. Shaller C.C. Belmonte E.J.

In transfected cell lines the two subtypes were shown to oppositely regulate levels of cAMP. The TPα receptor stimulated cAMP formation in contrast to the TPβ receptor that inhibited the level of intracellular cAMP (15Hirata T. Ushikubi F. Kakizuka A. Okuma M. Narumiya S. J. Clin.

Pertussis toxin was shown to block TPβ receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase; however, its effect on phospholipase C activation was not determined (15Hirata T. Ushikubi F. Kakizuka A.

ADP-induced platelet aggregation results from concomitant signaling through the P2Y1 and P2TAC receptors that couple to Gq and Gi, respectively (18Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. 1995; 309: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Contrary to previous studies, we have demonstrated that epinephrine and serotonin activating only Gi or Gq pathways, respectively, are not true platelet-aggregating agents (18Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8070-8074Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Offermanns et al.(24Offermanns S. Laugwitz K.L. Spicher K. Schultz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 504-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) have provided evidence showing that U46619 couples to Gq. Since thromboxane A2 couples to two TP receptor subtypes and TPβ has been shown to inhibit adenylyl cyclase, we investigated whether U46619 (a stable thromboxane A2analog) also causes platelet aggregation by co-activation of TPα and TPβ receptor subtypes coupled to Gq and Gi, respectively. We report here that U46619 causes intracellular calcium mobilization and shape change in human platelets independently of secretion. However, TxA2-induced platelet aggregation depends upon secretion of other platelet agonists capable of coupling to Gi pathways. In the absence of Gi signaling by other agonists, U46619 cannot cause inhibition of adenylyl cyclase or platelet aggregation. We provide evidence for the involvement of the P2TAC and α2A-adrenergic receptors as well as other Gi-coupled receptors in U46619-induced platelet aggregation. Adenosine-3′-phosphate-5′-phosphate (A3P5P), epinephrine, apyrase (type V), ADP, fibrinogen (type I), and bovine serum albumin (fraction V) were from Sigma. The acetoxymethyl ester of Fura PE-3 was from Teflabs (Austin, TX). The stable thromboxane/prostaglandin endoperoxide analogue 9,11-dideoxy-9,11-epoxymethanoprostaglandin F2α (U46619) and Ro 31-8220 (bisindolylmaleimide IX) were from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Imipramine was purchased from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). Bovine thrombin was from Parke-Davis. SC-57101 was a gift from Searle and Co. AR-C66096 (previously known as ARL 66096) was a gift from Astra Research Laboratories-Charnwood, Loughborough, UK (formerly Fisons). Yohimbine and cyproheptadine were purchased from Research Biologicals International (Natick, MA). All other chemicals were reagent grade, and deionized water was used throughout. Human blood was collected from a pool of informed healthy volunteers all of whom are students or staff at Temple University School of Medicine. The donated blood was collected into a one-sixth volume of ACD (2.5 g of sodium citrate, 1.5 g of citric acid, and 2.0 g of glucose in 100 ml of deionized H2O). Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was isolated by centrifugation of citrated blood at 180 × g for 15 min at room temperature. PRP was incubated with 1 mmacetylsalicylic acid (aspirin treated) for 1 h at 37 °C followed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min at room temperature. The platelet pellet was resuspended in HEPES-buffered Tyrode's solution (138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 3.0 mmNaH2PO4, 5 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4) supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.05 units/ml apyrase. The platelet count was adjusted to 2 × 108 cells/ml. All experiments were repeated at least three times using platelets from different donors. Agonist-induced platelet aggregation was determined by measuring the transmission of light through a 0.5-ml sample of aspirin-treated washed platelets (2 × 108 cells/ml) with stirring (900 rpm) in a lumi-aggregometer at 37 °C (Chrono-Log, Havertown, PA). The recorder output speed was set to 0.2 mm/s. The base line was set using 0.5 ml of HEPES-buffered Tyrode's solution as a blank. Aggregation of washed platelets required the addition of fibrinogen (1 mg/ml) prior to the addition of an agonist. Platelet shape change was observed by the addition of 1 μmSC-57101 before agonist stimulation. SC-57101 is a known inhibitor of platelet aggregation through blocking fibrinogen binding to its receptor (25Zablocki J.A. Miyano M. Garland R.B. Pireh D. Schretzman L. Rao S.N. Lindmark R.J.

All experiments were performed in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2 which was added first before either fibrinogen or SC-57101. All experiments were repeated at least three times using platelets from different donors. Platelet secretion was determined by measuring the release of [14C]5-HT and expressed as the percentage of the total [14C]5-HT content. The activation of labeled [14C]5-HT platelets was performed in the lumi-aggregometer at 37 °C with stirring (900 rpm) and was stopped after 2 min with the addition of formaldehyde/EDTA according to the method of Costa and Murphy (26Costa J.L. Murphy D.L. Nature. 1975; 255: 407-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Imipramine was added to the HEPES-buffered Tyrode's solution at a final concentration of 1 μm in order to prevent re-uptake of secreted [14C]5-HT. Samples were collected and centrifuged at 5000 × g for 1 min, and the radioactivity of the supernatant was measured using an LKB (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) liquid scintillation counter. Platelet-rich plasma was incubated at 37 °C with 3 μm Fura PE-3 acetoxymethyl ester and 1 mm acetylsalicylic acid for 45 min followed by 15 min at room temperature. The platelet-rich plasma was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at room temperature. The platelet pellet was resuspended in HEPES-buffered Tyrode's solution supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.05 units/ml apyrase. The platelet count was adjusted to 2 × 108 cells/ml. Aliquots (1.0 ml) of the platelet suspension were stirred (900 rpm) in a water-jacketed cuvette maintained at 37 °C during activation. Fluorescence was constantly measured using a Perkin-Elmer LS-5 spectrofluorimeter with settings of 340 (excitation) and 510 nm (emission). Fura PE-3 fluorescence signals were calibrated as described previously (27Smith J.B. Dangelmaier C. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 187: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). F min was determined by the addition of 2 mm EGTA, 20 mm Tris base, and 40 μm digitonin. F max was determined by addition of a saturating concentration of CaCl2 to the lysed cells. All experiments were performed in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2 and repeated at least three times using platelets from different donors. Calibration curves for experiments that included Ro 31-8220 were performed in the presence of Ro 31-8220 due to its slight quenching of the fluorescent signal. PRP was incubated with 2 μCi/ml [3H]adenine and aspirin (1 mm) for 1 h at 37 °C. Platelets were isolated from PRP by centrifugation as described above and resuspended in HEPES-buffered Tyrode's solution. Reactions were stopped with 1 m HCl, and 4,000 dpm of [14C]cAMP was added as the recovery standard. The level of cAMP was determined as described previously (28Daniel J.L. Dangelmaier C. Jin J. Ashby B. Smith J.B. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2024-2029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) and measured as a fraction of total [3H]adenine nucleotides. Results are normalized to the level of forskolin (20 μm)-stimulated cAMP and expressed as a percentage. Platelets respond to increasing concentrations of ADP by first undergoing shape change and then, at a higher concentrations, aggregation (29Born G.V.R. Nature. 1962; 194: 927-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (3750) Google Scholar). This is because ADP-induced platelet shape change results from activation of the high affinity P2Y1 receptor (19Jin J. Daniel J.L. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2030-2034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), and higher concentrations of ADP are needed for co-stimulation of both the high affinity P2Y1 receptor and a low affinity P2TAC receptor to induce aggregation (19Jin J. Daniel J.L. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2030-2034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). In order to determine if concomitant higher affinity Gq-coupled signaling and lower affinity Gi-coupled signaling also occurs in response to U46619 and to determine whether aggregation requires lower concentration of U46619 than secretion, we exposed platelets to different concentrations of the agonist. Similar to the response observed for ADP, the platelets first responded to lower concentrations of U46619 (100 nm) by changing shape. Aggregation occurred at significantly higher concentrations (300 nm) (Fig. 1 A). Secretion did not occur at concentrations of U46619 below 300 nm (Fig. 1 B); furthermore, the onset of aggregation appears to correlate with the initiation of secretion. PKC has been shown to play an important role in the induction of platelet secretion, and secretion can be blocked using the cell-permeable inhibitor of PKC, Ro 31-8220 (30Rotondo S. Evangelista V. Manarini S. de Gaetano G. Cerletti C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 919-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 31Sloan D.C. Haslam R.J. Biochem.

We investigated the role of secretion in platelet aggregation in response to ADP, thrombin, and U46619. Secretion in response to U46619 is totally abolished by 10 μm Ro 31-8220 (Fig. 1 B). In the presence of Ro 31-8220, U46619 caused shape change but did not induce aggregation (Fig. 2). Platelet aggregation induced by thrombin was slightly slowed down indicating the participation of secreted agonists, whereas aggregation in response to ADP was unaffected (Fig. 2).Figure 2Effect of 10 μm Ro 31-8220 on agonist-induced platelet aggregation. Platelet aggregation was measured as described. Aspirin-treated platelets were previously treated with either vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide) and are labeled controlor with 10 μm Ro 31-8220 as indicated.

J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2024-2029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Stimulation of the TP receptor with 30–100 nm U46619 leads to platelet shape change resembling selective stimulation of the Gq-coupled P2Y1 receptor. In order to assess the possible effects of secretion on Gq-mediated signaling, both platelet shape change and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization were measured in the presence and absence of Ro 31-8220, a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor. Platelet shape change in response to U46619 was not affected by Ro 31-8220 (Fig. 3 A) indicating that these signaling pathways are not dependent upon either secretion or PKC activity. Furthermore, the U46619-induced increase in cytosolic Ca2+ was unaffected by the presence of Ro 31-8220 (Fig.3 B) indicating that Gq-coupled signaling initiated by TP receptor stimulation is independent of released granule contents. Platelet secretion releases ADP and serotonin at the site of injury in order to activate and recruit more platelets into the forming primary hemostatic plug (2Hourani S.M. Cusack N.J. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 243-298PubMed Google Scholar). By using receptor-selective antagonists, we investigated the contribution of these agonists to U46619-induced Gq-coupled responses. The compound A3P5P is an antagonist of the Gq-coupled P2Y1 receptor (33Boyer J.L. Romero-Avila T. Schachter J.B. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1323-1329PubMed Google Scholar). Cyproheptadine is an antagonist at the 5-HT2A receptor (34de Clerck F. David J.L. Janssen P.A. Agents Actions. 1982; 12: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 35Glusa E. Markwardt F.

Neurol. 1991; 238 Suppl. 1: 45-52Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Aggregation was not affected by the presence of either compound (data not shown). U46619-induced platelet shape change was not affected by the presence of A3P5P (Fig. 4 A) or cyproheptadine (not shown) indicating the lack of any contribution by the P2Y1 or serotonin receptors to this event. The possible contribution of both the P2Y1 and 5-HT2A receptors in the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ was investigated. Intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in response to U46619 was not affected by A3P5P and/or cyproheptadine (Fig. 4 B). Previous studies have shown that U46619 causes a decrease in the intracellular concentration of cAMP in platelets (38Avdonin P.V. Svitina-Ulitina I.V. Leytin V.L. Tkachuk V.A. Thromb. Res. 1985; 40: 101-112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 39Sage S.O. Heemskerk J.W. FEBS Lett. 1992; 298: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether TP receptors can couple to Gi-signaling pathways, we utilized two approaches. The first was to block secretion using Ro 31-8220. In the absence of Ro 31-8220, U46619 inhibited forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase (Fig. 5). In the presence of Ro 31-8220, U46619 failed to inhibit adenylyl cyclase. The second approach utilized receptor-selective antagonists to the P2TAC and α2A-adrenergic receptors. AR-C66096 is an antagonist at the Gi-coupled P2TAC receptor (28Daniel J.L. Dangelmaier C. Jin J. Ashby B. Smith J.B. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2024-2029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), and yohimbine is an antagonist at the Gi-coupled α2-adrenergic receptor (40Periyasamy S.M. Somani P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1985; 116: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 41Berlin I. Crespo-Laumonnier B. Cournot A. Landault C. Aubin F. Legrand J.C. Puech A.J. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 49: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Platelet dense granules contain both ADP and epinephrine which cause the inhibition of cAMP following activation at their respective receptors (2Hourani S.M. Cusack N.J. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 243-298PubMed Google Scholar). The level of cAMP was measured following stimulation of platelets in the absence and presence of the antagonists AR-C66096 and yohimbine. These antagonists effectively prevented the contribution of Gi-coupled signaling by either the P2TAC or the α2A-adrenergic receptor, respectively. As shown in Fig.5, U46619-induced adenylyl cyclase inhibition was also blocked by these receptor antagonists, suggesting that U46619-induced Gistimulation depends on secreted ADP and epinephrine. We (18Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8070-8074Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) and others (20Savi P. Beauverger P. Labouret C. Delfaud M. Salel V. Kaghad M. Herbert J.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 21Jantzen H.M. Gousset L. Bhaskar V. Vincent D. Tai A. Reynolds E.E. Conley P.B. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 81: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) have provided evidence that concomitant signaling through both Gi-coupled and Gq-coupled receptors is required for platelet aggregation. Since the TP receptor does not couple to Gi, independently of secreted ADP and epinephrine (Fig. 5), we utilized receptor-selective antagonists to elucidate the role of these Gi-coupled receptors in U46619-induced platelet aggregation. AR-C66096 dramatically inhibited ADP-induced platelet aggregation (18Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8070-8074Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 28Daniel J.L. Dangelmaier C. Jin J. Ashby B. Smith J.B. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2024-2029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The rate and extent of U46619-induced aggregation were diminished in the presence of AR-C66096 (Fig. 6). In the presence of AR-C66096, yohimbine further inhibited U46619-induced platelet aggregation (Fig. 6). However, yohimbine alone was without any significant effect (not shown). These results indicated that the P2TAC receptor is essential for U46619-induced platelet aggregation. In order to verify that signaling through a Gi-coupled receptor only occurs following U46619-induced secretion, we investigated the effects of selective activation of Gi-coupled receptor stimulation in the presence of Ro 31-8220. Control experiments were performed to ensure that platelets respond normally to ADP and thrombin in the presence of Ro 31-8220 or vehicle (not shown). The P2TAC receptor was selectively activated by ADP in the presence of A3P5P. As shown in Fig. 7, selective activation of the P2TAC receptor reversed the effects of secretion blockade on U46619-induced aggregation. AR-C66096 blocked this reversal, providing further evidence that ADP is selectively activating the Gi-coupled P2TAC receptor (Fig. 7). Epinephrine also reversed the inhibitory effects of Ro 31-8220 on U46619-induced aggregation. Addition of ADP and epinephrine together potentiated this reversal. Thus platelet aggregation in response to U46619 is mediated by concomitant signaling through the Gq-coupled TP receptor and the Gi-coupled P2TAC and α2A receptors. The molecular mechanisms leading to aggregation following platelet exposure to thromboxane A2 have yet to be clearly elucidated. Four explanations for the stimulatory action caused by U46619 or other thromboxane A2 mimetics are possible. First, U46619 may activate Gq and Gi through the TPα and TPβ receptors, respectively. Second, it is conceivable that U46619 only activates the Gq pathway and that secreted ADP activates the Gi pathway. Although unlikely, a third explanation is that U46619 activates Gi or Gothrough TPβ leading to the activation of phospholipase C and the inhibition of cyclase. Following secretion, released ADP would activate the Gq pathway. Finally, U46619 may activate an unidentified G protein-coupled pathway that results in secretion of ADP which activates both Gq and Gi through the P2Y1 and the P2TAC receptors, respectively. We used three complementary approaches to identify the molecular mechanisms of U46619-induced platelet activation as follows: 1) determination of the minimum concentration required for platelet aggregation and secretion by U46619, 2) blockade of secretion, and 3) receptor subtype-selective antagonists in order to eliminate the positive feedback from granule contents. Here we report that although thromboxane A2causes intracellular calcium mobilization and shape change independently, thromboxane A2-induced inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and platelet aggregation depend exclusively on ADP and other released granule contents. Evidence exists for a dissociation of platelet activation responses following stimulation of the TP receptor. First, the EC50values of the TP receptor agonists, U46619 (42Morinelli T.A. Niewiarowski S. Daniel J.L. Smith J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: H1035-H1043PubMed Google Scholar) and STA2(43Kawahara Y. Fukuzaki H. Kaibuchi K. Tsuda T. Hoshijima M. Takai Y. Thromb. Res. 1986; 41: 811-818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), for an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ and platelet shape change are lower than the EC50 values for secretion and aggregation. Our data indicate that platelet aggregation correlates with the occurrence of secretion. We observed that platelet shape change occurs at lower concentrations of U46619 and that aggregation occurs at higher concentrations (Fig. 1 A). Furthermore, the same concentration of U46619 that leads to the initiation of aggregation also initiates secretion (Fig. 1 B). However, from this evidence it is not clear if platelet aggregation results in part from P2 receptor stimulation. Substantial evidence exists that PKC activation is required for platelet secretion (31Sloan D.C. Haslam R.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In platelets activated by U46619 in the presence of Ro 31-8220, it was reported that P47 phosphorylation, fibrinogen binding, and serotonin release were all inhibited (32Pulcinelli F.M. Ashby B. Gazzaniga P.P. Daniel J.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In agreement with previous studies, our results show that Ro 31-8220 prevented U46619-induced platelet aggregation (Fig. 2). We observed that Ro 31-8220 inhibited U46619-induced secretion in platelets loaded with [14C]serotonin in the presence of 2 mmCa2+ (Fig. 1 B) and that Ro 31-8220 did not inhibit the increase in cytosolic Ca2+ induced by U46619 (Fig. 3 B). Ro 31-8220 failed to inhibit ADP- or thrombin-induced platelet aggregation (Fig. 3) suggesting that the Ro 31-8220 inhibitable PKC isoforms do not directly contribute to fibrinogen receptor activation. Ro 31-8220 has been shown to block PKC isoforms α, β, γ, and ε (44Wilkinson S.E. Parker P.J. Nixon J.S. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 335-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Hence these PKC isoforms do not contribute to the inside-out signaling leading to fibrinogen receptor activation by either ADP or thrombin. Considering that secretion and aggregation both occur at the same concentration of U46619 (Fig. 1) and that blocking secretion prevents aggregation (Fig. 2), it is reasonable to suggest that thromboxane A2-induced aggregation is dependent upon secretion. The role of ADP in thromboxane A2-induced platelet aggregation has been investigated using enzymes that deplete released ADP. This work suggested that the aggregation response is mediated by the secretion of platelet ADP (45Bressler N.M. Broekman M.J. Marcus A.J. Blood. 1979; 53: 167-178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Claesson H.E. Malmsten C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 76: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 47Malmsten C. Hamberg M. Svensson J.

It was concluded that U46619-induced platelet aggregation depends on the release of stored ADP. The use of apyrase could have enhanced the generation of adenosine from AMP. Adenosine binds to the Gs-coupled A2receptor resulting in an increase in the intracellular concentration of cAMP and inhibits platelet activation (50Edwards R.J. MacDermot J. Wilkins A.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1987; 90: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 51Haslam R.J. Rosson G.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1975; 11: 528-544PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, these studies did not clearly determine how ADP and the other components of the dense and α-granules contribute to TxA2-induced platelet aggregation. The use of creatine phosphate/creatine phosphokinase converts ADP to ATP, an antagonist at the platelet ADP receptors (2Hourani S.M. Cusack N.J. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 243-298PubMed Google Scholar). ATP can also potentially stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity resulting in inhibition of platelet activation (52Soslau G. Brodsky I. Parker J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1177: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 53Soslau G. Youngprapakorn D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1355: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Our experiments make use of the receptor subtype-selective antagonists AR-C66096 and yohimbine, which block stimulation of Gi signaling. Evidence exists to support the presence of the TPα and TPβ receptor subtypes in platelets (8Hirata M. Hayashi Y. Ushikubi F. Yokota Y. Kageyama R. Nakanishi S. Narumiya S. Nature. 1991; 349: 617-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 17Habib A. FitzGerald G.A. Maclouf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2645-2651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar); these isoforms, when expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, have been shown to couple to Gs and Gi pathways, respectively. However, in the presence of Ro 31-8220, high concentrations of U46619 did not alter the level of cAMP, indicating that TP receptor subtypes do not couple to adenylyl cyclase in platelets. Our observation also is supported by two studies. By using platelet membranes, U46619 was found to have no effect upon levels of cAMP (54Brass L.F. Woolkalis M.J. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5348-5355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Klages et al.(55Klages B. Brandt U. Simon M.I. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) have shown that U46619 does not stimulate Gi proteins in mouse platelets. G protein coupling may be affected by levels of heterologous receptor expression; futhermore, high levels of receptor expression can lead to promiscuous coupling to multiple G proteins. U46619-induced aggregation requires concomitant stimulation of both a Gq-coupled receptor and a Gi-coupled receptor. Granule contents appear to mediate the stimulation of Gi-coupled signaling as is evident by the lack of cyclase inhibition when U46619-induced platelet secretion is prevented (Fig.5). The fact that signaling through the Gq-coupled TP receptor is unaffected under such conditions is apparent by both the robust shape change response (Fig.3 A) and the normal level of cytosolic Ca2+mobilization (Fig. 3 B). An alternative explanation for the effect of Ro 31-8220 on U46619-induced platelet aggregation is that U46619 causes platelet aggregation involving activation of a PKC isoform through a mechanism different from that of ADP. Hence, Ro 31-8220 would inhibit U46619-induced aggregation by inhibiting this PKC isoform in addition to blocking secretion. This possibility was ruled out using receptor-selective antagonists. Through the use of receptor-selective antagonists, we were able to identify clearly the contribution of receptors mediating aggregation following U46619-induced secretion. Antagonists at Gq-coupled receptors such as cyproheptadine and A3P5P had no effect on aggregation, shape change, or the increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. In contrast, both of the Gi-coupled P2TAC and α2A-adrenergic receptors were found to mediate aggregation and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, following U46619-induced secretion (Fig.6). The compound AR-C66096 had the greatest inhibitory effect indicating the large contribution to Gi-coupled signaling by the P2TAC receptor. In the absence of AR-C66096, yohimbine failed to affect U46619-induced aggregation, indicating that Gi stimulation could be compensated by P2TAC receptor stimulation. The amount of epinephrine found in platelets is extremely small (1.1–3.8 pmol/1 × 108 platelets) (56Barthel W. Markwardt F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1975; 24: 1903-1904Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar); however, the initial concentration of this secreted amount in the microenvironment of the platelet could be much greater. As observed, the secreted epinephrine makes a significant contribution as revealed by the inhibition of aggregation by yohimbine only in the absence of P2TAC receptor stimulation (Fig. 6). This suggests that secretion of the Gi-coupled receptor stimulating agonists (ADP and epinephrine) are required for full aggregation following activation of Gq-coupled signaling by thromboxane A2. When U46619-induced secretion was blocked by Ro 31-8220 aggregation was prevented. Under these conditions the selective activation of either the Gi-coupled P2TAC receptor or the α2A-adrenergic receptor restored aggregation (Fig.7). Further evidence for the important role of the P2TAC receptor in mediating the platelet response to TxA2 is provided by reports of patients with congenital ADP receptor defects (57Nurden P. Savi P. Heilmann E. Bihour C. Herbert J.M. Maffrand J.P. Nurden A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1612-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 58Cattaneo M. Lecchi A. Randi A.M. McGregor J.L.

Haemostasis. 1998; 80: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In these cases the shape change and cytosolic Ca2+mobilization responses to ADP are present indicating function of the P2Y1 receptor, whereas ADP-induced aggregation and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase are absent. Such findings suggest that the defect involves the P2TAC receptor. The lack of signaling due to a defective P2TAC receptor affects the response of these platelets to thromboxane A2 mimetics. In both cases, U46619-induced activation of the integrin αIIbβ3 was inhibited (58Cattaneo M. Lecchi A. Randi A.M. McGregor J.L. Mannucci P.M. Blood. 1992; 80: 2787-2796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 59Levy-Toledano S. Maclouf J. Rosa J.P. Gallet C. Valles G. Nurden P. Nurden A.T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 80: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by epinephrine in platelets from both patients was normal, suggesting that the residual fibrinogen receptor activation could be due to activation of α2A-adrenergic receptors by secreted epinephrine. On the other hand, we predict that in the case of a hypothetical P2Y1 receptor defect, platelet aggregation in response to U46619 would appear normal as Gi stimulation, although the P2TAC receptor and the α2-adrenergic receptor would be intact. Even in the presence of both AR-C66096 and yohimbine we still observed some residual aggregation (Fig. 6). We propose that this residual aggregation results from Gi signaling by other components of the granules. This prediction is supported by the fact that secretion blockade completely eliminates U46619-induced platelet aggregation. Based on previous and recent reports describing the mechanism of action by thrombospondin, a major constituent of the α granules, in platelet activation and aggregation (60Frazier W.A. Gao A.G.

Chem. 1997; 272: 1323-1330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we suggest that it too may be mediating TxA2 mimetic-induced aggregation. A recent study has demonstrated that thrombospondin can stimulate the Gi-signaling pathways (60Frazier W.A. Gao A.G. Dimitry J. Chung J. Brown E.J. Lindberg F.P. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8554-8560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In conclusion, as outlined in Fig. 8, our results show that U46619 causes platelet shape change and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization independently of secreted granule contents. However, U46619-induced platelet aggregation depends exclusively on Gi stimulation by ADP and other released granule contents. The P2TAC receptor appears to be the predominant stimulator of the Gi pathway. These results further support the hypothesis that platelet fibrinogen receptor activation requires concomitant signaling from the Gq- and Gi-signaling pathways. We thank Drs. James L.

We recently identified the early endosomal autoantigen EEA1 as an effector of Rab5 in endocytic membrane fusion. Here we demonstrate that EEA1 interacts directly and specifically with syntaxin-6, a SNARE implicated in trans-Golgi network to early endosome trafficking. The binding site for syntaxin-6 overlaps with that of Rab5-GTP at the C terminus of EEA1. Syntaxin-6 and EEA1 were found to colocalize extensively on early endosomes, although syntaxin-6 is present in the trans-Golgi network as well. Our results indicate that SNAREs can interact directly with Rab effectors, and suggest that EEA1 may participate intrans-Golgi network to endosome as well as in endocytic membrane traffic.

The SNARE1 and Rab protein families have been assigned a special role in vesicle targeting (1Pfeffer S.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E17-E22Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). SNARE proteins on vesicles form tight complexes with their complementary SNARE proteins on target membranes. This docks the vesicle to the target membrane, and membrane fusion ensues (2Weber T.

Sato K. Wickner W. Nature. 1998; 396: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Although a large number of SNARE molecules have been detected and localized to distinct intracellular membranes, SNARE pairing does not confer sufficient specificity to vesicle delivery because SNAREs interact rather promiscuously with each other (4Yang B. Gonzalez Jr., L. Prekeris R. Steegmaier M. Advani R.J. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5649-5653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Small GTPases of the Rab family appear to add an additional layer of specificity. Like SNAREs, distinct Rab GTPases are localized to distinct membranes and control distinct membrane trafficking routes (5Olkkonen V.M. Stenmark H. Int. Rev.

One of their main functions appears to be the recruitment of proteins that function as tethers prior to SNARE complex formation (1Pfeffer S.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E17-E22Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism that couples Rab-mediated tethering to SNARE complex formation is not known. Homotypic fusion between early endosomes can be readily reconstitutedin vitro and provides a convenient system to examine the role of Rab and SNARE proteins (7Mayorga L.S. Diaz R. Stahl P.D.

The findings that EEA1 contains two spatially separate Rab5 binding sites, forms rod-shaped coiled-coil dimers, and is required prior to endosomal SNARE function have suggested that it may act as a tethering factor (11Simonsen A.

Syntaxin-7 was PCR-amplified from a Marathon-Ready human brain cDNA (CLONTECH). cDNAs encoding rat syntaxin-3, rat syntaxin-4, and rat syntaxin-5 were provided by Vesa Olkkonen (National Public Health Institute, Helsinki, Finland), syntaxin-11 by Paul Roche (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), rat syntaxin-6 by Richard Scheller (Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA), and human syntaxin-13 by Rohan Teasdale (Monash University Medical School, Melbourne, Australia). Syntaxin-16 constructs were based on syntaxin-16A (14Simonsen A. Bremnes B. Rønning E. Aasland R. Stenmark H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 75: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Yeast two-hybrid bait and prey constructs were obtained by cloning the relevant cDNAs into the polylinker sites of pLexA/pBTM116 (15Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1658) Google Scholar) and pGAD GH (CLONTECH), respectively. For expression of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, pGEX syntaxin-7ΔC and pGEX-syntaxin-16ΔC were obtained by subcloning the respective cDNAs into the polylinker sites of pGEX-5X-3. pGEX-3X-syntaxin-6ΔC was provided by Robert C. Piper (University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA). (Syntaxin-6ΔC, syntaxin-7ΔC, and syntaxin-16ΔC encode amino acids 1–234, 1–217, and 1–279 of the respective proteins.) Myc epitope-tagged constructs were obtained by cloning the respective cDNAs behind the myc epitope of pGEM-myc3 or pGEM-myc4 (14Simonsen A. Bremnes B. Rønning E. Aasland R. Stenmark H. Eur. J.

Mouse monoclonal anti-Myc epitope antibody was from the 9E10 hybridoma (17Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar). A mouse monoclonal anti-syntaxin-6 antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antibodies against human, mouse, and rabbit IgG, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat antibodies against human IgG, and lissamine-rhodamine-labeled goat antibodies against mouse IgG were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch. The yeast reporter strain L40 (15Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1658) Google Scholar) was co-transformed with the indicated pLexA and pGAD plasmids, and β-galactosidase activities of the transformants were determined as described previously (18Stenmark H. Vitale G. Ullrich O. Zerial M. Cell. 1995; 83: 423-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). For transient overexpression studies, BHK-21 cells were infected for 1 h with T7 RNA polymerase recombinant vaccinia virus (vT7) and then transfected at 37 °C with pGEM-1 plasmids containing the cDNA of interest, using DOTAP (Boehringer, Mannheim), as described previously (19Stenmark H. Bucci C. Zerial M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The cells were analyzed 6 h post-transfection. Cells on coverslips were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.05% Saponin (Sigma) and stained with primary antibodies followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate or lissamine-rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies, as described (14Simonsen A. Bremnes B. Rønning E. Aasland R. Stenmark H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 75: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The coverslips were examined with a Leica TCS NT confocal microscope equipped with a Kr/Ar laser. GST and MBP fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL-21(DE3) cells (12Callaghan J. Simonsen A. Gaullier J.-M. Toh B.-H. Stenmark H. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), whereas recombinant, His6-tagged EEA1 was expressed in insect cells (11Simonsen A. Lippé R. Christoforidis S. Gaullier J.-M. Brech A. Callaghan J. Toh B.-H. Murphy C. Zerial M. Stenmark H. Nature. 1998; 394: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). HeLa cells grown in 15-cm dishes were washed in ice-cold PBS, scraped, and homogenized in 400 μl of homogenization buffer (HB) (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2), 1 mm DTT by passage through a 22 gauge needle six times. A post-nuclear supernatant was obtained by centrifugation for 5 min at 6000 rpm. The post-nuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 60,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C in a Beckman TLA 100.2 rotor to obtain a cytosolic and a membrane fraction. The membrane fraction was solubilized in HB-1 mm DTT, 1% Triton X-100 (TX-100) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors without EDTA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 45 min on ice before centrifugation at 60,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C in a Beckman TLA 100.2 rotor. The cytosol and the soluble membrane fraction were then incubated with 5 μg of recombinant GST, GST-syntaxin-6, GST-syntaxin-7, or GST-syntaxin-16 proteins prebound to glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were subsequently washed four times with ice-cold HB, 0.5% TX-100. EEA1 associated with the beads was detected by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), followed by immunoblotting, using a rabbit anti-EEA1 serum and the SuperSignal chemiluminescence kit from Pierce. Aliquots (25 μl) of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were washed three times with HB before incubation with 0.1 nmol of GST or GST-syntaxin-6 for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were then washed three times with HB, 0.5% TX-100 before incubation with 1 μg of recombinant EEA1 proteins (His6-EEA1, MBP-EEA11–209, MBP-EEA11257–1411, and MBP-EEA11257–1411C1405S) in HB, 0.5% TX-100 containing 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 4 °C. Finally, the beads were washed four times with HB, 0.5% TX-100. Recombinant EEA1 proteins associated with the beads were detected by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with a human anti-EEA1 serum and the SuperSignal chemiluminescence kit from Pierce. In some cases, MBP-EEA11257–1411 was incubated with Rab5-GDP or Rab5-GTPγS prior to addition to the beads. His6-Rab5 (2 mm) (20Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lütcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar) was preincubated with 10 mm GDP or GTPγS in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 100 mmK-acetate, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA and 1 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at 25 °C. The MgCl2 was then adjusted to 15 mm, MBP-EEA11257–1411 (50 nm) was added, and the incubation was continued for 30 min at 25 °C. The mixture was then added to glutathione-Sepharose beads containing 0.1 nmol of GST or GST-syntaxin-6 and left at 4 °C for 60 min. Finally, the beads were washed three times with the same buffer containing 15 mmMgCl2 and 0.05% TX-100, and protein associated with the beads was detected by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-MBP antibodies (11Simonsen A. Lippé R. Christoforidis S. Gaullier J.-M. Brech A. Callaghan J. Toh B.-H. Murphy C. Zerial M. Stenmark H. Nature. 1998; 394: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). BHK-21 cells grown in 10-cm dishes were transfected as described above. 6 h post transfection, the cells were washes three time with ice-cold PBS and lysed in HB, 1% TX-100 containing a mixture of protease inhibitors without EDTA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 20 min on ice. The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was incubated with a human anti-EEA1 serum, with normal human serum, or with 20 μl of anti-Myc-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C for 15 h. Twenty μl of protein G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added to the lysate in the former cases, and incubation was continued for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times with HB, 1% TX-100 and once with PBS. Precipitated proteins were detected by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with anti-EEA1 serum or anti-Myc antibody. Because Rab GTPases appear to act upstream of SNARE proteins in membrane docking/fusion, we investigated the possibility that EEA1 may bind to a SNARE molecule as well as to Rab5-GTP. For this purpose, we cloned EEA1 into a yeast two-hybrid “bait” vector and the cytoplasmic domains of various endosomal/trans-Golgi network (TGN) syntaxins (SNAREs) into a “prey” vector. The bait and prey plasmids were cotransformed into a two-hybrid reporter yeast strain, which was subsequently assayed for activation of the reporter gene, lacZ. As shown in TableI, neither syntaxin-7, which is thought to regulate trafficking between endosomes and lysosomes (21Wang H. Frelin L. Pevsner J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1997; 199: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 22Wong S.H. Xu Y. Zhang T. Hong W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 375-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), syntaxin-11, which is thought to regulate trafficking between late endosomes and the TGN (23Valdez A.C. Cabaniols J.P. Brown M.J. Roche P.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 845-854PubMed Google Scholar), nor syntaxin-16, which is found in the TGN region (14Simonsen A. Bremnes B. Rønning E. Aasland R. Stenmark H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 75: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), were found to interact with EEA1 in the two-hybrid system. In contrast, syntaxin-6, which has been implicated in TGN-endosome trafficking (24Davanger S. Bock J.B. Klumperman J. Scheller R.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), was found to interact strongly with EEA1, as indicated by the high β-galactosidase activity associated with the yeast transformants. The specific interaction between EEA1 and syntaxin-6 could also be demonstrated when EEA1 was cloned into the prey vector and the syntaxins were cloned into the bait vector, although these bait constructs resulted in some reporter gene activation by themselves (data not shown). We detected no interaction between syntaxin-6 and the GTPase-deficient Rab5 mutant, Rab5Q79L, or with another Rab5 effector, Rabaptin-5 (18Stenmark H. Vitale G. Ullrich O. Zerial M. Cell. 1995; 83: 423-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar,20Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lütcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). Altogether, these results indicate that EEA1 and syntaxin-6 interact specifically with each other.Table ISpecific interaction of syntaxin-6 with EEA1 in the yeast two-hybrid systempLexA constructpGAD constructReporter valueEEA1Syntaxin6ΔC1.93 ± 0.22EEA1Syntaxin7ΔC0.09 ± 0.09EEA1Syntaxin110.06 ± 0.02EEA1Syntaxin16ΔC0.06 ± 0.01Rab5Q79LSyntaxin6ΔC0.03 ± 0.01Rabaptin-5Syntaxin6ΔC0.16 ± 0.01EEA11–209Syntaxin6ΔC0.09 ± 0.01EEA11257–1411Syntaxin6ΔC2.55 ± 0.12EEA11257–1411C1405SSyntaxin6ΔC0.08 ± 0.01EEA11277–1411Syntaxin6ΔC0.21 ± 0.01EEA11307–1411Syntaxin6ΔC0.11 ± 0.02EEA11325–1411Syntaxin6ΔC0.05 ± 0.00EEA11277–1348Syntaxin6ΔC0.07 ± 0.01EEA11277–1348Rab5Q79L2.28 ± 0.07EEA11325–1411Rab5Q79L0.04 ± 0.02L40 reporter yeast cells were transformed with bait constructs in pLexA and prey constructs in pGAD.

To identify the syntaxin-6 interacting domain of EEA1, we tested deletion mutants of EEA1 against syntaxin-6 in the two-hybrid system. While the N terminus of EEA1 showed no interaction, the C terminus (residues 1257–1411) was found to interact with syntaxin-6 (Table I). We have previously identified residues 1277–1411 as the minimal endosomal binding domain of EEA1 (25Stenmark H. Aasland R. Toh B.H. D'Arrigo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24048-24054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), but this region showed no significant interaction with syntaxin-6, suggesting that the syntaxin-6 binding region is slightly larger than the minimal endosome binding region. Residues 1277–1348 constitute a minimal Rab5-binding domain that interacts with Rab5Q79L (Table I) (11Simonsen A. Lippé R. Christoforidis S. Gaullier J.-M. Brech A. Callaghan J. Toh B.-H. Murphy C. Zerial M. Stenmark H. Nature. 1998; 394: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar), whereas the very C terminus of EEA1 (residues 1325–1411) comprises a phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns-(3)P) binding FYVE finger (11Simonsen A. Lippé R. Christoforidis S. Gaullier J.-M. Brech A. Callaghan J. Toh B.-H. Murphy C. Zerial M. Stenmark H. Nature. 1998; 394: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar,12Callaghan J.

Nature. 1998; 394: 432-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Neither the minimal Rab5 binding region nor the FYVE finger alone interacted with syntaxin-6 (Table I). Interestingly, a mutation (C1405S) that abolishes PtdIns (3Ungermann C. Sato K. Wickner W. Nature. 1998; 396: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar)P and endosome binding (25Stenmark H. Aasland R. Toh B.H. D'Arrigo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24048-24054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 26Gaullier J.-M. Simonsen A. D'Arrigo A. Bremnes B. Aasland R. Stenmark H. Nature. 1998; 394: 432-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) led to a loss of syntaxin-6 binding as well. Taken together, these results suggest that the syntaxin-6 binding region of EEA1 encompasses both the Rab5 binding region and the FYVE finger. To study whether the interaction between EEA1 and syntaxin-6 can be detected biochemically, we prepared fusion proteins between GST and the cytoplasmic domains of syntaxin-6, syntaxin-7, and syntaxin-16. GST alone or the fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads, which were incubated with cytosol and membrane extract from HeLa cells. After washing the beads, we analyzed the bound material by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-EEA1 antibodies. As shown in Fig.1 a, a significant portion of cytosolic and membrane-associated EEA1 bound to GST-syntaxin-6, whereas EEA1 did not associate with GST alone, GST-syntaxin-7, and GST-syntaxin-16. We also detected no interaction with GST-syntaxin13 (not shown). To test if the interaction between EEA1 and syntaxin-6 is direct, we performed a similar GST pull-down experiment using recombinant EEA1 instead of cytosol. Like cytosolic EEA1, the recombinant full-length EEA1 was found to bind specifically to GST-syntaxin-6 (Fig. 1 b). Likewise, the recombinant C terminus of EEA1 (as a fusion with maltose binding protein, MBP) was found to interact with syntaxin-6, whereas the C1405S mutant and the N terminus showed no interaction. These experiments support the data from the two-hybrid system and indicate that the C terminus of EEA1 interacts directly and specifically with syntaxin-6. To investigate if EEA1 and syntaxin-6 can interact in vivo, we subjected cell lysates to immunoprecipitation with anti-EEA1 antibodies and studied by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting if syntaxin-6 was coimmunoprecipitated. As shown in Fig. 1 c, in cells coexpressing Myc-epitope-tagged (17Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar) syntaxin-6 and EEA1, Myc-syntaxin-6 was coimmunoprecipitated with anti-EEA1 (lane 1) but not with a control serum (lane 2). Similarly, when the inverse immunoprecipitation was performed, EEA1 was found to coimmunoprecipitate with anti-Myc from a cell lysate from Myc-syntaxin-6-transfected cells (lane 3) but not from untransfected cells (lane 4). These results indicate that EEA1 interacts with syntaxin-6 in vivo as well as in vitro. The assignment of binding sites for both Rab5 and syntaxin-6 to the C terminus of EEA1 led us to investigate if Rab5 and syntaxin-6 bind competitively to EEA1. For this purpose, we immobilized GST-syntaxin-6 on glutathione-Sepharose beads and studied the binding of MBP-EEA11257–1411 in the presence of Rab5 complexed with either GDP or the slowly hydrolyzable GTP analogue, GTPγS (Fig.1 d). Under the experimental conditions used, we detected some unspecific binding of the EEA1 construct to GST alone (lanes 4), but the binding to GST-syntaxin-6 (lanes 1) was significantly higher. Interestingly, binding was reduced to background level in the presence of Rab5-GTPγS (lanes 2) but remained unaltered in the presence of Rab5-GDP (lanes 3). This indicates that the binding sites for Rab5-GTP and syntaxin-6 at the C terminus of EEA1 physically overlap. To study if EEA1 and syntaxin-6 colocalize in the cell, we double-stained BHK cells with antibodies recognizing the endogenous proteins. As found previously (16Mu F.T. Callaghan J.M. Steele-Mortimer O. Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Campbell P.L. McCluskey J. Yeo J.P. Tock E.P. Toh B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13503-13511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar), EEA1 was detected on vesicular structures, representing early endosomes (Fig.2 a). Syntaxin-6, on the other hand, was abundant in a juxtanuclear region (Fig. 2 b). However, syntaxin-6 was also detected on small vesicles, and it colocalized extensively with EEA1 on early endosomes (Fig.2 c, yellow). This localization is consistent with a previous electron microscopic study that showed syntaxin-6 present on TGN vesicles and endosomes as well as in the TGN (24Davanger S. Bock J.B. Klumperman J. Scheller R.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). When the GTPase-deficient Q79L mutant of Rab5 is expressed, early endosomes expand because of increased fusion activity (20Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lütcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). To investigate if syntaxin-6 is recruited onto these enlarged endosomes, we transfected cells with Rab5Q79L and stained them with anti-EEA1 and anti-syntaxin-6 antibodies. The large endosomes clearly contained EEA1 (Fig. 2 d) as well as syntaxin-6 (Fig. 2 e), and the two proteins colocalized on these structures (Fig. 2 f). When a panel of epitope-tagged syntaxins were coexpressed with Rab5Q79L, only syntaxin-6, syntaxin-7, and syntaxin-13 were found to be recruited on the enlarged early endosomes, whereas syntaxin-2, syntaxin-4, syntaxin-5, syntaxin-11, and syntaxin-16 were not (data not shown). These results indicate that endogenous syntaxin-6 colocalizes with EEA1 on endosomes, and that syntaxin-6 represents a minority of syntaxins that can be found on these organelles. The colocalization between syntaxin-6 and EEA1 is consistent with the idea that these two proteins may functionally interact to regulate TGN-endosome trafficking. This paper provides the first evidence for a direct interaction between a Rab effector and a SNARE molecule. Previously, a direct interaction between the Rab GTPase Ypt1p and the SNARE Sed5p has been detected in yeast. However, this interaction has so far not been demonstrated to be GTP-dependent (27Lupashin V.V. Waters M.G. Science. 1997; 276: 1255-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Another yeast protein, Vac1p, has recently been shown to interact directly with the Rab5 homologue Vps21p as well as with Vps45p, a member of the Sec1p family of putative SNARE regulators (28Peterson M.R. Burd C.G. Emr S.D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 159-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 29Tall G.G. Hama H. DeWald D.B. Horazdovsky B.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1873-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Vac1p and Vps45p have previously been found in a complex with Pep12p (30Burd C.G. Peterson M. Cowles C.R. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1089-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), a possible yeast homologue of syntaxin-6 (31Bock J.B. Lin R.C. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17961-17965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Vac1p has been implicated in the docking of post-Golgi vesicles with early endosomes (28Peterson M.R.

Garlow S.J. Wesp A. Riezman H. Jones E.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 871-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and it shares regions of sequence similarity with EEA1, including a phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate binding FYVE finger (25Stenmark H. Aasland R. Toh B.H. D'Arrigo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24048-24054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). This raises the possibilities that Vac1p may represent an EEA1 homologue in yeast (34Wurmser A.E. Gary J.D. Emr S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9129-9132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and that Vac1p/Pep12p and EEA1/syntaxin-6 may regulate equivalent trafficking steps. The fact that syntaxin-6 interacts with a mammalian homologue of Vps45p (35Tellam J.T. James D.E. Stevens T.H. Piper R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6187-6193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) is consistent with this view. We propose that Rab5 and EEA1, like their putative yeast homologues, Vps21p and Vac1p, may play a role in TGN to early endosome trafficking in addition to regulating endocytic membrane fusion. The interaction between syntaxin-6 and EEA1 could thus mediate the tethering of a post-Golgi vesicle to an early endosome. Our finding that Rab5-GTP and syntaxin-6 bind competitively to the membrane-proximal C terminus of EEA1 further suggests that syntaxin-6 binding may cause a dissociation between EEA1 and Rab5. We speculate that another (unknown) SNARE present on the endosome may then pair with syntaxin-6 to form a tight pre-fusion complex. It will now be interesting to study if Rab5 and EEA1 may regulate, for instance, the routing of lysosomal enzymes from the TGN to endosomes. Likewise, it will be important to study if syntaxin-6 may regulate homotypic early endosome fusion. The existence of multiple endosomal SNAREs raises the possibility that EEA1 may interact with other SNAREs to regulate this process.

Spillantini M.G. Davies S.W. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1998; 8: 619-632Crossref Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In vitro, recombinant α-synuclein is induced to form amyloid-like fibrils under certain conditions, such as long time lag and high temperature, providing a model system that α-synuclein by its full-length molecule acts as an amyloidogenic protein (11Hashimoto M. Hsu L.J. Sisk A. Xia Y. Takeda A. Sundsmo M. Masliah E. Brain Res. 1998; 799: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In this respect, it was recently reported that the mutant α-synucleins (A53T and A30P) associated with rare form of familial PD tend to be more easily aggregated than wild type α-synuclein (12Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury P.T. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1318-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar,13El-Agnaf O. Jakes R. Curran M.D. Middleton D. Ingenito R. Bianchi E. Pessi A. Neill D. Wallace A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was shown in vitro that aggregates of both wild type and mutant α-synucleins induce apoptotic cell death in a human neuroblastoma cell line (14El-Agnaf O. Jakes R. Curran M.D. Wallace A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). These findings support the contention that aggregation of α-synuclein might be centrally involved in the pathogenesis of LBD. However, since the great majority of cases are not associated with mutations within this molecule, then other factors might contribute to α-synuclein aggregation in sporadic forms of the disease. Indeed, it has been shown that the in vitro aggregation of α-synuclein is modulated by various factors, such as Aβ (15Yoshimoto M. Iwai A. Kang D. Otero D. Xia Y. Saitoh T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar), although none of them are likely to explain the mechanism by which α-synuclein is preferentially aggregated in the PD brain.More recently, we have shown that α-synuclein was significantly aggregated by the iron-catalyzed oxidative reaction in vitro(20Hashimoto M. Hsu L.J. Xia Y. Takeda A. Sundsmo M. Masliah E. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 717-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). These aggregates displayed Thioflavine-S/Congo red-positive filamentous structures, reminiscent of amyloid-like fibrils found in LBs of PD brain (20Hashimoto M. Hsu L.J. Xia Y. Takeda A. Sundsmo M. Masliah E. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 717-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In this regard, it has been well documented that free radical formation derived from the auto-oxidation of dopamine into neuromelanine may be related to the selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the PD brain (21Adams J. Odunze I.N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 10: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Moreover, iron is known to exist abundantly in the substantia nigra and its increase in the PD brain has been consistently reported (22Youdim M.B. Ben-Schachar D. Riederer P. Acta Neurol. Scand. 1989; 126: 47-54Crossref Scopus (263) Google Scholar).In this context, we hypothesize that cytochrome c, a heme protein, could be a source of iron and oxidative stress (22Youdim M.B. Ben-Schachar D. Riederer P. Acta Neurol. Scand. 1989; 126: 47-54Crossref Scopus (263) Google Scholar) that might trigger the pathological aggregation of α-synuclein. Since cytochromec functions as an essential component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (23Shigenaga M.K. Hagen T.M. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10771-10778Crossref PubMed Scopus (1812) Google Scholar), dysfunction of this molecule may trigger the generation of superoxide in mitochondria, resulting in enhanced oxidative stress conditions. In addition, since cytochrome cacts as a mediator of apoptotic cell death signals (24Green D.R. Cell. 1988; 94: 695-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1092) Google Scholar), it might be involved in an as yet uncharacterized mechanism which may link apoptosis to amyloidogenesis and neurodegeneration. These notions prompted us to extend our earlier work to the current investigation to determine whether cytochrome c is involved in the aggregation of α-synuclein in PD and related disorders.DISCUSSIONThe present study investigated the potential role of cytochromec in the aggregation of α-synuclein. This study showed that cytochrome c was induced to be aggregated by H2O2treatment. Because the aggregates of cytochrome c seems to be different from amyloid-like fibrils, it is currently unknown whether or not these aggregates in and of themselves exert cytotoxicity. The importance of cytochromec may be augmented by its stimulatory effects on the aggregation of α-synuclein. In support of this hypothesis, this study showed that aggregation of α-synuclein was not induced by either cytochrome c or H2O2 alone, but rather was significantly stimulated in the presence of both. The cytochrome c/H2O2-induced aggregation of α-synuclein was partially inhibited by an antioxidantN-acetyl-l-cysteine and both cytochromec/H2O2- and hemin/H2O2-induced aggregation of α-synuclein was significantly inhibited by treatment with a specific iron chelator, deferoxisamine, indicating that iron-catalyzed oxidative reactions (fenton reaction) may be attributed to the aggregation of α-synuclein. Thus, these results indicate that oxidation of cytochrome c is critical for the stimulation of α-synuclein aggregation. Similarly, previous studies have shown that hemin cross-links proteins such as apolipoprotein B, myosin, and erythrocyte cytoskeletal proteins (26Miller Y.I. Felikman Y. Shaklai N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 326: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 27Solar I. Dulitzky J. Shaklai N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 1283: 81-89Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 28Hanan T. Shaklai N. Free Radic. Res. 1995; 22: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 29Bodaness R.S. Leclair M. Zigler Jr., J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 231: 461-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In addition, hemin has been shown to cross-link Aβ (30Dyrks T. Dyrks E. Hartmann T. Masters C. Beyreuther K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18210-18217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together these studies support the contention that oxidative stress might lead to neurodegeneration by promoting cross-linking and aggregation of amyloidogenic molecules (31Markesbery W.R. Carney J.M. Brain Pathol. 1999; 9: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar).Further supporting the possibility that cytochrome c and α-synuclein interact in vivo in LB formation, double immunolabeling studies showed that approximately half of the α-synuclein-positive LBs were also cytochrome c-positive. A recent study showed that LBs in substantia nigra were more intensively stained with α-synuclein than ubiquitin, although quantitative evaluation was not described (7Spillantini M.G. Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Hasegawa M. Goedert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6469-6473Crossref PubMed Scopus (2346) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin had been previously regarded as a major sensitive marker of detecting LBs (32Kuzuhara S. Mori H. Izumiyama N. Yoshimura M. Ihara Y. Acta Neuropathol. 1988; 75: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), and disorder of the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway may be in some way attributed to the aggregation of α-synuclein (33Mezey E. Dehejia A. Harta G. Papp M. Polymeropoulos M. Brownstein M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 755-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Therefore, high frequency of cytochrome c-positive LBs in the substantia nigra suggests that it may play a crucial role in the aggregation of α-synuclein. Of considerable interest is that there seemed to be no specific difference of frequencies among various types of LBD, including sporadic PD, DLBD, and LBV, and that neo-cortical LBs and other pathological lesions, such as senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in LBV, were cytochrome c-negative. Such substantia nigra-specific staining of LBs by of cytochromec may be accounted for by severe mitochondrial dysfunction due to oxidation and/or some region-specific factors in this area. Alternatively, an epitope for the cytochrome c antibody might be altered by unknown mechanism in cortical LBs and other pathological lesions.Cytochrome c is known to have two well defined physiological functions: regulation of the electron transfer in mitochondria and mediation of apoptosis (34Cai J. Yang J. Jones D.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar), and we suppose that both of these physiological functions of cytochrome c are closely related to its pathological action as a stimulator of α-synuclein aggregation. Since cytochrome c has a specific function in transfer of electrons between complex III (ubiquinol:cytochrome oxidoreductase) and complex IV (cytochrome oxidase), a dysfunction of this molecule may trigger production of reactive oxidant species in mitochondria, which would deteriorate the intracellular oxidative stress conditions (23Shigenaga M.K. Hagen T.M. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10771-10778Crossref PubMed Scopus (1812) Google Scholar). In addition, cytochrome c is known to act as an essential component of the complex that activates apoptotic cell death signal pathway. Once cytochrome c is released by cell death signals from the intramembrane of mitochondria to cytoplasm, it can trigger the activation of caspase-3, hence activating the downstream of apoptotic cell death pathway (24Green D.R. Cell. 1988; 94: 695-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1092) Google Scholar). However, a recent study using microinjection experiment strongly suggests that release of cytochrome c is not enough to cause cell death in primary cultured rat dorsal neurons (35Deshmukh M. Johnson J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 695-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), indicating that some postmitotic neurons have a capacity to be resistant to cytochromec-induced apoptosis. If this indeed is the case with dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, it is possible that the extended period of time in which cytochrome c remains in the cytoplasm might lead to an interaction with α-synuclein and its aggregation under oxidative stress conditions. It is also interesting to determine whether structural change of cytochrome ccaused by oxidation may affect the activity of apoptotic signal pathway.In conclusion, our in vitro and in vivo data suggest that cytochrome c, a well known electron transfer in mitochondria as well as an apoptotic cell death mediator, may be involved in the stimulation of α-synuclein aggregation under pathological conditions. Further investigation of the precise role of cytochrome c in the aggregation of α-synuclein may clarify the fundamental mechanism of the amyloidogenesis and neuronal cell death in PD and related α-synucleinopathies.

These aggregates displayed Thioflavine-S/Congo red-positive filamentous structures, reminiscent of amyloid-like fibrils found in LBs of PD brain (20Hashimoto M. Hsu L.J. Xia Y. Takeda A. Sundsmo M. Masliah E. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 717-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In this regard, it has been well documented that free radical formation derived from the auto-oxidation of dopamine into neuromelanine may be related to the selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the PD brain (21Adams J. Odunze I.N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 10: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Moreover, iron is known to exist abundantly in the substantia nigra and its increase in the PD brain has been consistently reported (22Youdim M.B. Ben-Schachar D. Riederer P. Acta Neurol. Scand. 1989; 126: 47-54Crossref Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In this context, we hypothesize that cytochrome c, a heme protein, could be a source of iron and oxidative stress (22Youdim M.B. Ben-Schachar D. Riederer P. Acta Neurol. Scand. 1989; 126: 47-54Crossref Scopus (263) Google Scholar) that might trigger the pathological aggregation of α-synuclein. Since cytochromec functions as an essential component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (23Shigenaga M.K. Hagen T.M. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10771-10778Crossref PubMed Scopus (1812) Google Scholar), dysfunction of this molecule may trigger the generation of superoxide in mitochondria, resulting in enhanced oxidative stress conditions. In addition, since cytochrome cacts as a mediator of apoptotic cell death signals (24Green D.R. Cell. 1988; 94: 695-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1092) Google Scholar), it might be involved in an as yet uncharacterized mechanism which may link apoptosis to amyloidogenesis and neurodegeneration. These notions prompted us to extend our earlier work to the current investigation to determine whether cytochrome c is involved in the aggregation of α-synuclein in PD and related disorders. DISCUSSIONThe present study investigated the potential role of cytochromec in the aggregation of α-synuclein. This study showed that cytochrome c was induced to be aggregated by H2O2treatment. Because the aggregates of cytochrome c seems to be different from amyloid-like fibrils, it is currently unknown whether or not these aggregates in and of themselves exert cytotoxicity. The importance of cytochromec may be augmented by its stimulatory effects on the aggregation of α-synuclein. In support of this hypothesis, this study showed that aggregation of α-synuclein was not induced by either cytochrome c or H2O2 alone, but rather was significantly stimulated in the presence of both. The cytochrome c/H2O2-induced aggregation of α-synuclein was partially inhibited by an antioxidantN-acetyl-l-cysteine and both cytochromec/H2O2- and hemin/H2O2-induced aggregation of α-synuclein was significantly inhibited by treatment with a specific iron chelator, deferoxisamine, indicating that iron-catalyzed oxidative reactions (fenton reaction) may be attributed to the aggregation of α-synuclein. Thus, these results indicate that oxidation of cytochrome c is critical for the stimulation of α-synuclein aggregation. Similarly, previous studies have shown that hemin cross-links proteins such as apolipoprotein B, myosin, and erythrocyte cytoskeletal proteins (26Miller Y.I. Felikman Y. Shaklai N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 326: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 27Solar I. Dulitzky J. Shaklai N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 1283: 81-89Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 28Hanan T. Shaklai N. Free Radic. Res. 1995; 22: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 29Bodaness R.S. Leclair M. Zigler Jr., J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 231: 461-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In addition, hemin has been shown to cross-link Aβ (30Dyrks T. Dyrks E. Hartmann T. Masters C. Beyreuther K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18210-18217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together these studies support the contention that oxidative stress might lead to neurodegeneration by promoting cross-linking and aggregation of amyloidogenic molecules (31Markesbery W.R. Carney J.M. Brain Pathol. 1999; 9: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar).Further supporting the possibility that cytochrome c and α-synuclein interact in vivo in LB formation, double immunolabeling studies showed that approximately half of the α-synuclein-positive LBs were also cytochrome c-positive. A recent study showed that LBs in substantia nigra were more intensively stained with α-synuclein than ubiquitin, although quantitative evaluation was not described (7Spillantini M.G. Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Hasegawa M. Goedert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6469-6473Crossref PubMed Scopus (2346) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin had been previously regarded as a major sensitive marker of detecting LBs (32Kuzuhara S. Mori H. Izumiyama N. Yoshimura M. Ihara Y. Acta Neuropathol. 1988; 75: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), and disorder of the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway may be in some way attributed to the aggregation of α-synuclein (33Mezey E. Dehejia A. Harta G. Papp M. Polymeropoulos M. Brownstein M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 755-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Therefore, high frequency of cytochrome c-positive LBs in the substantia nigra suggests that it may play a crucial role in the aggregation of α-synuclein. Of considerable interest is that there seemed to be no specific difference of frequencies among various types of LBD, including sporadic PD, DLBD, and LBV, and that neo-cortical LBs and other pathological lesions, such as senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in LBV, were cytochrome c-negative. Such substantia nigra-specific staining of LBs by of cytochromec may be accounted for by severe mitochondrial dysfunction due to oxidation and/or some region-specific factors in this area. Alternatively, an epitope for the cytochrome c antibody might be altered by unknown mechanism in cortical LBs and other pathological lesions.Cytochrome c is known to have two well defined physiological functions: regulation of the electron transfer in mitochondria and mediation of apoptosis (34Cai J. Yang J. Jones D.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar), and we suppose that both of these physiological functions of cytochrome c are closely related to its pathological action as a stimulator of α-synuclein aggregation. Since cytochrome c has a specific function in transfer of electrons between complex III (ubiquinol:cytochrome oxidoreductase) and complex IV (cytochrome oxidase), a dysfunction of this molecule may trigger production of reactive oxidant species in mitochondria, which would deteriorate the intracellular oxidative stress conditions (23Shigenaga M.K. Hagen T.M. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10771-10778Crossref PubMed Scopus (1812) Google Scholar). In addition, cytochrome c is known to act as an essential component of the complex that activates apoptotic cell death signal pathway. Once cytochrome c is released by cell death signals from the intramembrane of mitochondria to cytoplasm, it can trigger the activation of caspase-3, hence activating the downstream of apoptotic cell death pathway (24Green D.R. Cell. 1988; 94: 695-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1092) Google Scholar). However, a recent study using microinjection experiment strongly suggests that release of cytochrome c is not enough to cause cell death in primary cultured rat dorsal neurons (35Deshmukh M. Johnson J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 695-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), indicating that some postmitotic neurons have a capacity to be resistant to cytochromec-induced apoptosis. If this indeed is the case with dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, it is possible that the extended period of time in which cytochrome c remains in the cytoplasm might lead to an interaction with α-synuclein and its aggregation under oxidative stress conditions. It is also interesting to determine whether structural change of cytochrome ccaused by oxidation may affect the activity of apoptotic signal pathway.In conclusion, our in vitro and in vivo data suggest that cytochrome c, a well known electron transfer in mitochondria as well as an apoptotic cell death mediator, may be involved in the stimulation of α-synuclein aggregation under pathological conditions. Further investigation of the precise role of cytochrome c in the aggregation of α-synuclein may clarify the fundamental mechanism of the amyloidogenesis and neuronal cell death in PD and related α-synucleinopathies.

These are plasma membrane microdomains enriched in glycosphingolipids and cholesterol and are suggested to be platforms for cell signaling. Concomitant with the synthesis of myelin glycosphingolipids, maturing oligodendrocytes progressively associate GPI-anchored proteins, including the adhesion molecules NCAM 120 and F3, in rafts. Here we show that these microdomains include Fyn and Lyn kinases. Both kinases are maximally active in myelin prepared from young animals, correlating with early stages of myelination. In the rafts, Fyn kinase is tightly associated with NCAM 120 and F3. In contrast, in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells lacking rafts or in raft-free membrane domains of more mature cells, F3 does not associate with Fyn. The addition of anti-F3 antibodies to oligodendrocytes results in stimulation of Fyn kinase specifically in rafts. Compartmentation of oligodendrocyte GPI-anchored proteins in rafts is thus a prerequisite for association with Fyn, permitting kinase activation. Interaction of oligodendrocyte F3 with axonal ligands such as L1 and ensuing kinase activation may play a crucial role in initiating myelination.

Remahl S. Persson H. Bjartmar C. Prog. Neurobiol. 1993; 40: 319-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Myelination in the central nervous system involves sequential stages of interaction between the myelinating glial cell, the oligodendrocyte, and the neuronal process, the axon. Initial recognition and adhesion results in wrapping of the glial process around the axon (ensheathment) followed by the laying down of the multilamellar sheath. Although progenitor cells have the intrinsic potential to differentiate into oligodendrocytes in vitro in the absence of axons (2Raff M.C. Miller R.H. Noble M.

Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 191-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar), myelination in vivodemonstrates a high degree of specificity and requires axonal signals. For example, oligodendrocytes do not normally myelinate dendrites (5Lubetzki C. Demerens C. Anglade P. Villarroya H. Frankfurter A. Lee V.M.Y. Zalc B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell adhesion molecules expressed by both axons and glial cells are known to play a crucial role in the establishment of axon-glial contact and subsequent signaling to the oligodendrocyte, driving the process of myelination (7Doyle J.P. Colman D.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 8Notterpek L.M. Rome L.H. Neuron. 1994; 13: 473-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In turn, the myelinating glial cell triggers an axonal reaction, culminating in an increased phosphorylation of neurofilaments and regulation of the axonal diameter (9de Waegh S.M. Lee V.M.Y.

Neurosci. 1994; 14: 6392-6401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Members of the cadherin and the Ig superfamily such as L1, NCAM,1 and especially MAG are candidate molecules mediating axon-glial interactions (7Doyle J.P. Colman D.R. Curr. Opin.

The formation of morphologically normal myelin sheaths in MAG knockout and even in MAG/NCAM double knockout mice suggests that either these molecules are not involved in myelin formation or additional molecules participate in the early events of myelination (12Li C.

Cell Tissue Res. 1997; 287: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Our knowledge about the signals exchanged between axons and oligodendrocytes during myelination is also incomplete. A role for oligodendroglial Fyn kinase (a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase of the Src family) has been proposed as Fyn phosphorylates MAG after co-transfection in COS cells and Fyn knockout mice are hypomyelinated (15Umemori H. Sato S. Yagi T. Aizawa S. Yamamoto T. Nature. 1994; 367: 572-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The integrity of the axon-glial unit requires continual bidirectional signaling between the oligodendrocyte and the axon. GPI-anchored proteins expressed by oligodendrocytes and their precursor cells are candidates for recognition molecules dictating the initial interactions between axon and oligodendrocyte and acting as receptors mediating axon-glial signal transduction. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells express a distinct pattern of GPI-anchored molecules, which is retained as the cells mature and is present in preparations of adult myelin. Although both oligodendrocyte precursor cells and mature oligodendrocytes express a similar pattern of GPI-anchored proteins, in oligodendrocytes and myelin, but not in precursor cells, these proteins are associated with the major myelin lipids galactocerebroside, sulfatide, and cholesterol in membrane domains. These domains can be isolated as detergent-insoluble glycosphingolipid-rich microdomains (DIGs) by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (16Krämer E.-M. Koch T. Niehaus A. Trotter J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8937-8945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). DIGs can be isolated from several cell types and are thought to represent raft-like microdomains within the plasma membrane, resulting from the lateral assembly of sphingolipids and cholesterol in the exoplasmic leaflet of the lipid bilayer due to weak interactions between their polar headgroups (17Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8092) Google Scholar, 18Harder T. Simons K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). In polarized epithelial cells, where rafts emerge in the trans-Golgi network, they are thought to be responsible for the apical sorting of glycosphingolipids, GPI-anchored proteins, and other apical marker molecules (17Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8092) Google Scholar, 18Harder T. Simons K. Curr. Opin.

We postulated that in oligodendrocytes, as in epithelial cells, DIGs represent raftlike membrane domains in which oligodendrocyte GPI-anchored proteins together with the major myelin lipids are sorted into the forming myelin sheath (16Krämer E.-M. Koch T. Niehaus A. Trotter J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8937-8945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Mice in which the enzyme UDP-galactose:ceramide galactosyl transferase catalyzing the synthesis of the myelin lipids galactocerebroside and sulfatide has been knocked out exhibit tremors and hind limb paralysis and die prematurely (20Bosio A.

Cell. 1996; 86: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). They show deficits in nerve conduction despite the formation of compact myelin. However, the nodal/paranodal structure in these mice is severely perturbed (22Dupree J.L. Coetzee T. Blight A. Susuki K. Popko B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1642-1649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Coetzee T. Susuki K. Popko B. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 126-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Whether these defects result from a loss of functional properties of these lipids such as insulation or from the loss of lipid-associated targeting of specific proteins including signaling molecules to areas of the forming myelin sheath is unelucidated. As was first shown for T-lymphocytes, in many cell types DIG microdomains include nonreceptor tyrosine kinases of the Src family (24Robinson P.J. Immunology Today. 1991; 12: 35-41Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 25Brown D.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1993; 5: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In this paper, we investigated the association of such kinases with GPI-anchored proteins in oligodendrocytes and myelin, since they could be involved in signal transduction between the wrapping glial cell process and the axon. Our results show that the two major oligodendroglial GPI-anchored proteins, the 120-kDa isoform of NCAM (26Bhat S. Silberberg D.H. J.

The activity of both kinases within the DIGs is developmentally regulated, being most active at the beginning of myelination. Fyn but not Lyn kinase activity is stably associated with both NCAM 120 and F3. Furthermore, antibody-mediated cross-linking of F3 results in stimulation of the Fyn kinase activity localized to oligodendrocyte DIGs. The association of NCAM 120 and F3 with Fyn kinase to a functional signaling complex within raftlike glycosphingolipid-rich microdomains during oligodendrocyte maturation may be critical for signal transduction between axon and glial cell in the early phases of myelination.

The amino-terminal peptide of F3 (KGFGPIFEEQPINT) was synthesized by Dr. R. Frank (ZMBH, University of Heidelberg, Germany). The following rabbit polyclonal antibodies were used: antibodies recognizing NCAM (27Trotter J. Bitter-Suermann D. Schachner M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1989; 22: 369-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), F3 (Ig fraction of a serum raised against the N-terminal F3 peptide; Ref. 29Koch T. Brugger T. Bach A. Gennarini G. Trotter J.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4948-4961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Fyn, and Lyn (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Heidelberg). The following monoclonal antibodies were used: murine monoclonal antibody 27-11-111 (mAb F11 No. 8) made against chick F11 (32Brümmendorf T. Hubert M. Treubert U. Leuschner R. Tarnok A. Rathjen F.G. Neuron. 1993; 10: 711-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), which cross-reacts with mouse F3 (56Koch T. Untersuchungen zu Oligodendroglialen Glykosylphosphatidylinositol-Verankerken Molekülen, mit Besonderem Angenmerk auf die Expression von F3. Ph.D. thesis. University of Heidelberg, 1998Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. F. Rathjen (Berlin, Germany); rat monoclonal antibody AN2, which recognizes a surface epitope of a 330-kDa glycoprotein expressed by the cell line Oli-neu and primary oligodendrocyte progenitors (31Niehaus A. Stegmüller J. Diers-Fenger M. Trotter J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4948-4961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); murine monoclonal antibody 4G10 against phosphotyrosine from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY); and mouse monoclonal antibody against Fyn (Pharmingen/Transduction Laboratories). Secondary antibodies were from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany). Primary cultures of oligodendrocytes were prepared from embryonic day 14–16 mice as described (27Trotter J. Bitter-Suermann D. Schachner M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1989; 22: 369-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 33Sontheimer H. Trotter J. Schachner M. Kettenmann H. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1135-1145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Oligodendrocytes growing on top of astrocyte monolayers were shaken off and plated in modified Sato medium (27Trotter J. Bitter-Suermann D. Schachner M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1989; 22: 369-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) containing 1% horse serum on poly-l-lysine-coated dishes. To increase the proportion of precursor cells as well as to promote survival, 10 ng/ml human recombinant platelet-derived growth factor (AA), and 5 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor were added immediately after the shake and after 24 h in vitro. Oligodendrocytes were kept for 5 days in vitro without further growth factor additions before they were harvested. The resulting population, which was used for all experiments with primary cultures, is enriched for differentiated oligodendrocytes but contains a fraction of progenitor cells (27Trotter J. Bitter-Suermann D. Schachner M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1989; 22: 369-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The cell line Oli-neu(34Jung M. Krämer E.M. Grzenkowski M. Tang K. Blakemore W. Aguzzi A. Khazaie K. Chlichlia K. von Blankenfeld G. Kettenmann H. Trotter J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 1245-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) was cultured in Sato medium containing 1% horse serum. To induce differentiation of the precursor-like Oli-neu cells, cultures were treated with 1 mm dbcAMP for 3–4 days (daily additions to the culture medium). For metabolic labeling primary oligodendrocytes and Oli-neucells were starved for 1 h in SO4/Met/Cys-free DMEM and incubated for 4 h with 100 μCi/mll-[35S]Met/Cys labeling mix. Myelin was isolated from the brains of young postnatal (postnatal days (P)9/10, P12, P16, P20, P30, or P45) and adult NMRI mice of both sexes according to standard procedures (35Smith M.E. J. Neurochem. 1969; 16: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar,36Norton W.T. Poduslo S.E. J. Neurochem. 1973; 21: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). Initially, brains were homogenized in ice-cold 10.5% sucrose using the Ultra-Turrax T25 (IKA, Staufen, Germany). Myelin was removed from the interface between 10.5 and 30% sucrose step gradients and subjected to two rounds of hypoosmotic shock by resuspension in a large volume of ice-cold water and reisolation on the step gradient; this separates myelin membranes from axolemma. Purified myelin was collected from the final sucrose interface, washed twice with cold water, resuspended in a small volume of water, and immediately used or frozen in small aliquots at −80 °C. The protein content of the myelin preparations was determined by using the Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin as a protein standard. Detergent extracts were prepared as described (19Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2609) Google Scholar,37Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). In brief, primary oligodendrocytes (2–3 × 107) or sonicated myelin (300 μg of total protein) were solubilized at 4 °C in 1 ml of extraction buffer containing 10 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2% Triton X-100 (TNE/Triton X-100). The extracts were shaken for 30 min at 4 °C. Detergent extracts were adjusted to 40% sucrose by adding equal volumes of 80% sucrose in TNE without Triton X-100 and placed into an ultracentrifuge tube. A linear gradient from 5 to 30% sucrose (in TNE without Triton X-100) was layered over the lysate. Gradients were centrifuged for 12 h at 35,000 rpm at 4 °C in a Beckmann SW 40 TI rotor (218,000 × g). 1-ml fractions were harvested, and the density was determined by measurement of the refractive index. Proteins in each fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot. Light gradient fractions containing floating GPI-anchored proteins, glycosphingolipids, and cholesterol (DIGs) were collected, diluted with double distilled H2O, and pelleted for 1 h at 218,000 × g and 4 °C. Isolated DIGs were subjected to an in vitro kinase assay and immunoprecipitation. The protein concentration of the DIGs was evaluated with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit using bovine serum albumin as a protein standard. Proteins blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane were detected by incubation with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The blots were incubated with a second anti-species antibody conjugated with HRP for 30–60 min at room temperature. The blots were developed with ECL reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions. Membranes were stripped with 100 mm glycine, pH 2, for 30 min, blocked, and reprobed with antibodies. Isolated DIGs were resuspended in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Nonidet P-40), incubated with antibodies and Protein A-Sepharose and washed under stringent conditions in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmdithioerythritol, 100 μm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF) and once in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 100 μm Na3VO4, 10 mmNaF. The immunoprecipitate was subjected to a [γ-32P]ATP in vitro kinase assay. To identify associated kinases, some samples were subjected to a second round of immunoprecipitation; immune complexes were denatured and dissociated by two sequential incubations in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5% SDS, and 1% β-mercaptoethanol for 10 min at 95 °C followed by centrifugation. Supernatants eluted from the Sepharose beads were diluted in 500 μl of lysis buffer and incubated with Fyn antibodies and Protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at room temperature. All samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and radioactive protein bands were detected with a phosphoimager or autoradiography. DIGs that had been subjected to a [γ-32P]ATP kinase assay were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against Fyn and Lyn according to the same procedure, but SDS-PAGE analysis was performed directly after the precipitation. For immunoprecipitation from bottom fractions of the gradients, 250 μl of the fraction was diluted with an equal volume of lysis buffer and processed similarly to the DIG fractions above. Immune complexes were resuspended in 20 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 100 μm Na3VO4) and incubated with 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 20 min at room temperature. The samples were washed and subjected either to SDS-PAGE or a second round of immunoprecipitation to identify associated kinases. DIGs were isolated from sucrose density gradients, resuspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer, and incubated with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 20 min at room temperature. Kinase assays were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography or subjected to immunoprecipitation. Optical densities from linear exposures of autoradiograms and Western blots developed using ECL were measured using the UltraScan XL Laser Densitometer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the GelScan XL software. Kinase activities were expressed as a function of tyrosine phosphorylation in relation to the total amount of the kinase. Oli-neu cells (1–2 × 107) were induced to differentiate by incubation with 1 mm dbcAMP for 3–4 days (34Jung M. Krämer E.M. Grzenkowski M. Tang K. Blakemore W. Aguzzi A. Khazaie K. Chlichlia K. von Blankenfeld G. Kettenmann H. Trotter J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 1245-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The cells were washed twice with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with the monoclonal antibody 27-11-111, which reacts with F3 (32Brümmendorf T. Hubert M. Treubert U. Leuschner R. Tarnok A. Rathjen F.G. Neuron. 1993; 10: 711-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The cells were washed three times with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline and incubated with rabbit anti-mouse IgG for 30 min at 4 °C. In control samples, cells were incubated with the monoclonal AN2 antibody (31Niehaus A. Stegmüller J. Diers-Fenger M. Trotter J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4948-4961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), followed by rabbit anti-rat IgG, or with primary or secondary antibodies alone. Subsequently, the dishes were transferred to 37 °C for 0, 3, 5, and 10 min (controls were left for 5 min at 37 °C). Following incubation at 37 °C, the cells were immediately lysed in 1.5 ml of extraction buffer, and the extracts were subjected to sucrose density gradient centrifugation as described above. DIGs were isolated from sucrose density gradients, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting for tyrosine-phosphorylated Fyn and total Fyn protein with specific antibodies. To examine the localization of GPI-anchored proteins in DIGs during myelination, primary oligodendrocytes or myelin prepared from mice at defined developmental stages between postnatal day 9 (P9) and adult were analyzed by detergent extraction and sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Equal amounts of total myelin protein from each age examined were applied to the gradients. Western blot analysis of the gradient fractions with antibodies recognizing NCAM or F3 showed that a fraction of both GPI-anchored NCAM 120 and F3 float at low densities in the gradient (Fig. 1 A). Transmembrane isoforms of NCAM (NCAM 140 and 180) localize exclusively at the bottom of the gradient in high density fractions. Lipid analysis showed that the low density fractions are enriched in the typical myelin glycosphingolipids galactocerebroside and sulfatide as well as cholesterol (16Krämer E.-M. Koch T. Niehaus A. Trotter J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8937-8945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Flotation of GPI-anchored proteins in the gradient shows their specific association with DIGs. DIGs from cultured oligodendrocytes and myelin of P9/10 and P12 mice are distributed in gradient fractions between 18 and 25% sucrose (fractions 4–9). With increasing age of the animals and thus progressing myelination, the myelin DIGs focus at a density of 17–18% sucrose (fractions 8 and 9). The GPI-anchored proteins are enriched in DIGs and in myelin from P45, and they are localized exclusively in DIGs. Western blot analysis of the gradient fractions with antibodies against the Src family tyrosine kinases Fyn (p59) and Lyn (p53/56) showed that both kinases co-localize with NCAM 120 and F3 in DIG fractions (Fig.1 B). In gradients from cultured primary oligodendrocytes and myelin from P9/10 and P12 animals both kinases were found in bottom gradient fractions as well as in DIG fractions, in a distribution similar to that of the GPI-anchored proteins. The expression of Lyn kinase in myelin declined after P12, whereas Fyn was still expressed in adult myelin. With progressing myelination, Fyn kinase became progressively associated with DIG fractions, and in myelin from P30 up to adult it localized exclusively to DIGs, in a similar fashion to the shift in localization of the GPI-anchored proteins. Immunoprecipitation of phosphoproteins from the [γ-32P]ATP kinase assays of DIGs with antibodies directed against the Src family kinases Fyn and Lyn showed that both participate in the kinase reactions and are phosphorylated. The phosphorylation of both these kinases in DIGs is down-regulated with ongoing myelination (Fig.2 A). The strongest signal for32P-phosphorylated Fyn was obtained in precipitates of Fyn from oligodendrocyte DIGs. The 32P phosphorylation of Fyn in DIGs from myelin continuously declined between P9/10 and P30 and was virtually absent in DIGs from myelin of P45 and adult mice. High amounts of 32P-phosphorylated Lyn were precipitated from DIGs from oligodendrocytes, whereas only very weak 32P signals were obtained from DIGs of myelin from P9/10 and P12 mice. To investigate whether the reduction in phosphorylation of the kinases is due to a reduction in expression of the respective proteins, the samples were analyzed by Western blotting. Significant levels of Fyn kinase were present in myelin DIGs throughout development until adult (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, expression of Lyn kinase was observed in myelin DIGs up to P12 and was thereafter absent. The phosphorylation of Src family kinases is in most cases due to autophosphorylation and can be taken as a measure of the enzymatic activity (38Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar). We measured the optical densities of the autoradiograms showing the 32P phosphorylation as well as the optical densities of the signals from the Western blots showing the total amount of the kinases and expressed the activity of each kinase as relative phosphorylation per unit of protein (Fig. 2 C). The kinase activity of Fyn is highest in DIGs from oligodendrocytes and in DIGs from myelin of P9/10 mice, at a time point where in vivo myelination is commencing. With ongoing myelination, the Fyn activity localized in DIGs is rapidly down-regulated. Lyn kinase activity is maximal in DIGs from cultured oligodendrocytes and weak in DIGs from myelin of P9/10 and P12 mice. We next asked whether the co-localization of the GPI-anchored adhesion receptors and the Src kinases on sucrose density gradients reflects an association between these molecules. We isolated DIGs from oligodendrocyte extracts, used them as a source for immunoprecipitation of NCAM or F3, and performed a [γ-32P]-ATP in vitro kinase assay on the immunoprecipitate. The bottom fractions of the gradient were also isolated and similarly subjected to immunoprecipitation and kinase assay. Phosphorylated proteins associated with the immunoprecipitate were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. In contrast to the multiple signals seen when the entire DIG proteins were subjected to a kinase assay (data not shown), a dominant phosphorylated protein of 59 kDa was associated with the immunoprecipitated NCAM 120 and F3 in DIGs (Fig.3 A, lane 5, and Fig. 3 B, lane 5). In both cases, this 59-kDa phosphoprotein was identified as Fyn kinase by reprecipitation with specific antibodies (Fig. 3, A,lane 6, and B, lane 6). No association with Lyn kinase was observed (data not shown). Additional signals of higher molecular weight were observed in the autoradiograph of the kinase assay on the NCAM 120 immunoprecipitate, but these were weak in comparison with the 59-kDa Fyn signal. In the case of the kinase assay on the F3 immunoprecipitate, additional signa"

Nuclear run-off assays indicate that this induction is at least partly due to increased transcription. Activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway due to the enhanced transforming growth factor α (TGFα) expression plays an important role in the induction of COX-2 by IFN-γ. This is supported by the ability of TGFα to rapidly induce COX-2 and the inhibition of the IFN-γ-mediated COX-2 mRNA induction by an EGFR antibody and EGFR-selective kinase inhibitors. Deletion and mutation analysis indicates the importance of the proximal cAMP-response element/ATF site in the transcriptional control of this gene by TGFα. The increase in COX-2 mRNA by TGFα requires activation of both the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Inhibition of p38 MAPK decreases the stability of COX-2 mRNA, while inhibition of MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) does not. These results suggest that the p38 MAPK signaling pathway controls COX-2 at the level of mRNA stability, while the ERK signaling pathway regulates COX-2 at the level of transcription. In contrast to NHEK, IFN-γ and TGFα are not very effective in inducing TGFα or COX-2 expression in several squamous carcinoma cell lines, indicating alterations in both IFN-γ and TGFα response pathways.

Sites of inflammation contain elevated levels of IFN-γ and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), which plays a pivotal role in the adhesion and migration of leukocytes at sites of inflammation, and ICAM-1 is dramatically induced by IFN-γ in epidermal keratinocytes (26Fierlbeck G. Rasner G. Muler G. Arch. Dermatol. 1990; 126: 315-355Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Recent studies showed that targeted expression of IFN-γ to the suprabasal layers of the epidermis of transgenic mice induces increased proliferation, a thickened epidermis, perturbed differentiation, and eczema resembling contact dermatitis (27Carroll J.M.

Cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2) catalyze the first, rate-limiting step in the conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins and thromboxanes.

The tumor promoter 12-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-myristate, epidermal growth factor, and UV irradiation have been shown to induce COX-2 in epidermal keratinocytes and in the epidermis (44Buckman S.Y.

In addition to sites of inflammation, elevated COX-2 expression has also been found in many tumors, including skin (47Kutchera W. Jones D.A. Matsunami N. Groden J. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A.

Carcinogenesis. 1989; 10: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and COX-2 null mice developed 75% fewer chemically induced skin papillomas than control mice (51Tiano H. Chulada P. Spalding J. Lee C. Loftin C. Mahler J. Morham S. Langenbach R. Proc. Natl. Assn. Cancer Res. 1997; 38: 1727Google Scholar). These observations suggest that COX-2 has an important role in inflammation and carcinogenesis in the epidermis.Although many inflammatory skin diseases are associated with increased levels of IFN-γ and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), the relationship between IFN-γ, prostaglandin synthesis, and inflammation in the epidermis is not well understood. In this study, we demonstrate that IFN-γ induces COX-2 expression and increases PGE2 production in normal human epidermal keratinocyte (NHEK) cells. We provide evidence indicating that this induction is mediated at least in part through activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; c-ErbB1) and is related to increased expression of growth factors such as TGFα. This induction of COX-2 is regulated in part at the transcriptional level and involves the CRE/ATF site in the proximal COX-2 promoter region. In addition, we demonstrate the importance of the activation of both the ERK and p38 MAPK signaling pathways in COX-2 induction. The stimulation of TGFα synthesis and possibly other cytokines by IFN-γ and the subsequent increase in PGE2 production are likely to be important signals involved in triggering the hyperproliferative transformation associated with many inflammatory diseases in the skin.DISCUSSIONIFN-γ has been reported to regulate the expression of COX-2 in several cell systems. In human bronchial epithelial cells and macrophages (42Asano K. Nakamura H. Lilly C.M. Klagsbrun M. Drazen J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1057-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 62Riese J. Hoff T. Nordhoff A. DeWitt D.L. Resch K. Kaever V. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 55: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), IFN-γ induces COX-2, while it has no effect in osteoblast and smooth muscle cells (41Pang L. Knox A.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 121: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and inhibits COX-2 expression in microglial cells (63Minghetti L. Polazzi E. Nicolini A. Creminon C. Levi G. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1963-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that in NHEK IFN-γ, treatment causes a dramatic induction in the expression of COX-2, while COX-1 expression is inhibited. The increase in the level of COX-2 protein by IFN-γ is probably responsible for the observed increase in PGE2 synthesis. We show that the induction of COX-2 by IFN-γ in NHEK is at least in part mediated through activation of the EGFR signaling pathway due to observed increased expression of TGFα and possibly other growth factors by IFN-γ. A similar mechanism has recently been reported for human bronchial epithelial cells (42Asano K. Nakamura H. Lilly C.M. Klagsbrun M. Drazen J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1057-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The rapid increase in COX-2 expression by TGFα in NHEK (Fig. 7 C) as well as other cell types (40Mestre J.R. Subbaramaiah K.

A. 1997; 94: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) and the temporal correlation between the induction of TGFα and COX are in agreement with such a mechanism. Observations showing that anti-EGFR antibodies and EGFR-selective kinase inhibitors almost totally block induction of COX-2 and PGE2 by IFN-γ suggest that activation of EGFR is a major signaling pathway involved in the up-regulation of COX-2 by IFN-γ. These findings are highly relevant to understanding the role that IFN-γ plays in inflammatory skin disease. Inflammatory processes in the skin, including psoriasis and dermatitis, are characterized by hyperplasia and the presence of high levels of IFN-γ as well as of TGFα and PGE2 (13Matue H. Cruz P.D.

Our findings provide a mechanism that links these three different effects in the skin and suggest that the induction of TGFα by IFN-γ and the resulting increase in the expression of COX-2 and production of PGE2 are an important part of hyperproliferative responses observed during inflammation in the skin and probably in other tissues as well.Previous studies have demonstrated that COX-2 expression can be regulated by transcriptional (40Mestre J.R.

Our results obtained by transient transfection assays using several reporter constructs, in which the reporter is under the control of various lengths of the COX-2 regulatory region, support the conclusion that TGFα regulates COX-2 gene expression at least in part at the transcriptional level. Deletion analysis of the −1432 bp regulatory region indicated that the −124 proximal promoter region containing the CRE/ATF/E-box element plays an important role in the transcriptional control by TGFα.

The results from the present investigation were used to establish a family of amino acid transporters associated with type II membrane glycoproteins. related to b0,+ amino acid transporter 4F2 heavy chain kilobase pair(s) phosphate-buffered saline Two type II membrane glycoproteins with single transmembrane domains have been implicated in amino acid transport via the plasma membrane (1Palacin M. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 123-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first is rBAT1 (related to b0,+ amino acid transporter), which is also known as D2 or NBAT (2Wells R.G. Hediger M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5596-5600Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 3Bertran J. Werner A. Moore M.L. Stange G. Markovich D. Biber J. Testar X. Zorzano A. Palacin M. Murer H. Proc.

A. 1992; 89: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). It induces the Na+-independent transport of cystine as well as basic and neutral amino acids with the properties of system b0,+ when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. rBAT was found to be related to the genetic disease cystinuria, in which defects in amino acid reabsorption in the renal proximal tubules lead to urinary loss of cystine and basic amino acids (5Palacin M. Estevez R. Bertran J. Zorzano A. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 969-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Because rBAT is not typical of transporters with multiple transmembrane structures, it was proposed that rBAT itself is not a transporter but is associated with unidentified amino acid transporters to activate them (1Palacin M. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 123-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second one is 4F2hc (the heavy chain of the 4F2 antigen), which was originally identified as a cell surface antigen that is up-regulated upon lymphocyte activation (6Haynes B.F. Hemler M.E. Mann D.L. Eisenbarth G.S. Shelhamer J. Mostowski H.S. Thomas C.A. Strominger J.L. Fauci A.S. J. Immunol. 1981; 126: 1409-1414PubMed Google Scholar, 7Hemler M.E. Strominger J.L. J. Immunol. 1982; 129: 623-628PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the amino acid sequence similarity between rBAT and 4F2hc, experiments were performed in which 4F2hc is expressed in Xenopus oocytes to show that 4F2hc also induces amino acid transport (8Wells R.G.

Zorzano A. Kuhn L.C. Palacin M. Murer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5606-5610Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The 4F2 antigen is a heterodimeric complex composed of two subunits, a heavy chain and a light chain that are linked via a disulfide bond (6Haynes B.F. Hemler M.E. Mann D.L. Eisenbarth G.S.

It is structurally related to 4F2hc-associated transporters, thereby establishing a family of amino acid transporters associated with type II membrane glycoproteins. The cDNA for a mouse expressed sequence tag (GenBankTM/EBI/DDBJ accession number AA162896) showing nucleotide sequence similarity to rat LAT1 was obtained from the integrated and molecular analysis of genomes and their expression. The ∼0.8-kb EcoRI fragment was excised from the cDNA (IMAGE cDNA clone number 578502) and labeled with [32P]dCTP (T7Quick Prime, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for use as a probe for screening a cDNA library prepared from rat kidney poly(A)+ RNA using Superscript Choice System (Life Technologies, Inc.)

FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Screening of the cDNA library and isolation of positive plaques were performed as described (19Utsunomiya-Tate N. Endou H.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The cDNA was sequenced in both directions by the dye terminator cycle sequencing method (Perkin-Elmer and Applied Biosystems). Transmembrane regions of proteins were predicted based on SOSUI algorithm (15Segawa H. Fukasawa Y. Miyamoto K. Takeda E. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol.

Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 378-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (1560) Google Scholar). High stringency Northern blot analysis of rat poly(A)+ RNA (3 μg/lane) was performed as described previously (10Kanai Y. Segawa H. Miyamoto K. Uchino H. Takeda E. Endou H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23629-23632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar, 22Kanai Y. Stelzner M.G. Lee W.-S. Wells R.G. Brown D. Hediger M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F1087-F1092PubMed Google Scholar). The EcoRI fragment of BAT1 cDNA corresponding to 1–793 base pairs was labeled with 32P using T7Quick Prime kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Oligopeptides (QMLMEVVPPEKDPEC) corresponding to amino acid residues 474–487 of BAT1 and (SDVDTHAVSLEKGEC) to amino acid residues 629–642 of rat rBAT (2Wells R.G. Hediger M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5596-5600Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) were synthesized. The C-terminal cysteine residues were introduced for conjugation with keyhole limpet hemocyanine. Anti-peptide antibodies were produced as described elsewhere (23Altman A. Carderas J.M. Houghten R.A. Dixon F.J. Argyrios N. Theofilopoulos A.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2176-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For immunohistochemical analysis, antisera were affinity-purified as described previously (24Hisano S. Haga H. Miyamoto K. Takeda E. Fukui Y. Brain Res. 1996; 710: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Kidney membranes were prepared as described elsewhere (25Thorens B. Sarkar H.K. Kaback H.R. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1988; 55: 281-290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Protein samples were heated at 100 °C for 5 min in sample buffer in either the presence or absence of 5% 2-mercaptoethanol and subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (26Taketani Y. Segawa H. Chikamori M. Morita K. Tanaka K. Kido S. Yamamoto H. Iemori Y. Tatsumi S. Tsugawa N. Okano T. Kobayashi T. Miyamoto K. Takeda E. J. Biol.

The separated proteins were transferred electrophoretically to a Hybond-P polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membrane was treated with diluted anti-rBAT antiserum (1:40,000) or anti-BAT1 antiserum (1:4,000), and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG as the secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) (26Taketani Y. Segawa H. Chikamori M. Morita K. Tanaka K. Kido S. Yamamoto H. Iemori Y. Tatsumi S. Tsugawa N. Okano T. Kobayashi T. Miyamoto K. Takeda E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14575-14581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The signal was detected by an ECL plus system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To verify the specificity of immunoreactions by absorption experiments, the membranes were treated with primary antibodies in the presence of antigen peptides (50 μg/ml). Immunohistochemical analysis of rat kidney was performed as described elsewhere (24Hisano S. Haga H. Miyamoto K. Takeda E. Fukui Y. Brain Res. 1996; 710: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. For immunostaining, serial sections (3 μm) were incubated with affinity-purified anti-rBAT (1:5,000) or anti-BAT1 (1:5,000) antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Thereafter, they were treated with Envision (+) rabbit peroxidase (Dako) for 30 min. To detect immunoreactivity, the sections were treated with diaminobenzidine (0.8 mm) (27Tojo A. Sekine T. Nakajima N. Hosoyamada M. Kanai Y. Kimura K. Endou H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 464-471PubMed Google Scholar). cDNAs for BAT1, rBAT, and 4F2hc were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). These plasmids were transfected solely or cotransfected to COS-7 cells by electroporation. For the electroporation, a cell suspension (800 μl, 1.25 × 107 cells/ml) was mixed with plasmids (10 μg for each). The mixture was electroporated at 200 V, 960 microfarads in a 0.4-cm cuvette using a Gene Pulsar (Bio-Rad). Cells were seeded on 24-well culture plates (5 × 105cells/well) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. For amino acid uptake measurements, cells were used three days after plating (90∼100% confluence) on 24-well plates. Dulbecco's modified phosphate-buffered saline (Dulbecco's PBS) containing14C-amino acids was added after preincubation of the cells in Dulbecco's PBS for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by removing the uptake medium followed by washing three times with ice-cold Dulbecco's PBS. Then, the cells were solubilized with 0.1n NaOH, and radioactivity was counted. Because [14C]cystine (100 μm) uptake was linearly dependent on the incubation time up to 5 min, for all the experiments, uptakes were measured for 2 min, and the values were expressed as picomoles/milligram protein/minute. K m andV max of amino acid substrates were determined using the Eadie-Hofstee equation based on the BAT1-mediated amino acid uptakes measured at 3, 10, 30, 100, 300, and 1,000 μm. The BAT1-mediated amino acid uptakes were calculated as differences between the means of uptakes of the COS-7 cells transfected with cDNAs and those of the mock-transfected controls. For the measurements of the uptake of radiolabeled amino acids in the present study, four wells were used for each data point. Each data point in the figures represents the mean ± S.E. of uptake values (n = 4). To confirm the reproducibility of the results, three separate experiments were performed for each measurement using different batches of COS-7 cell transfectants except forK m and V max determination. The results from representative experiments are shown in the figures. A cDNA clone with a 1,746-base pair insert was isolated from rat kidney cDNA library. It contained an open reading frame from nucleotides 170 to 1,630 encoding a 487-amino acid protein designated BAT1 (b0,+-type amino acid transporter 1). The amino acid sequence of BAT1 exhibited remarkable homology to those of rat system L transporters LAT1 (43% identity) (10Kanai Y. Segawa H. Miyamoto K. Uchino H. Takeda E. Endou H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23629-23632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar) and LAT2 (43%) (15Segawa H. Fukasawa Y. Miyamoto K. Takeda E. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 11455-11458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of BAT1 also exhibited significant homology to those of system y+ transporters CAT1∼4 (∼30%) from mice and humans (5Palacin M. Estevez R. Bertran J. Zorzano A. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 969-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, 12 transmembrane regions were predicted from the amino acid sequence. There is a conserved cysteine residue (BAT1 amino acid residue 144) in the putative extracellular loop between predicted transmembrane domains 3 and 4 (28Pfeiffer R. Spindler B. Loffing J. Skelly P.J. Shoemaker C.B. Verrey F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In Northern blot analysis, a 1.9-kb message was expressed in kidney, jejunum, and ileum for BAT1 (Fig.2 A). In the immunohistochemical analysis of rat kidney tissue, BAT1 immunoreactivity was detected in the apical membrane of the proximal tubules (Fig. 2 B, left panel). It was stronger in the proximal convoluted tubules than in the proximal straight tubules, with faint but significant immunostaining detected in the proximal straight tubules (Fig. 2 B, left panel:arrow). rBAT immunoreactivity was also detected in the apical membrane of the proximal tubules (Fig. 2 B,right panel). The expression of rBAT was strongest in the proximal straight tubules. The expression of rBAT was still detected in the convoluted portion of the proximal tubules (Fig. 2 B,right panel: arrowhead), although it was weak compared with that in the straight portion (Fig. 2 B,right panel: arrow). Colocalization of BAT1 and rBAT proteins was demonstrated in the apical membrane, in particular, in the convoluted portion of the proximal tubules (Fig.2 B, right and left panels: arrowhead). Western blot analyses were performed on the membrane fraction prepared from rat kidney in the presence or the absence of 2-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 3 A). For BAT1, 251-, 125-, and 38-kDa bands were detected in the absence of 2-mercaptoethanol (nonreducing condition). In the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol (reducing condition), the 251- and 125-kDa bands disappeared, and a 41-kDa band was detected instead. The 38-kDa band seemed to be nonspecific, because it was not affected by the presence of antigen peptides in the absorption experiments, whereas the 251-, 125-, and 41-kDa bands disappeared (Fig. 3 A). For rBAT, 231-, 125-, 86-, and 62-kDa bands were detected under the nonreducing condition. Under the reducing condition, the 231- and 125-kDa bands disappeared, and a 90-kDa band was detected instead. The 86- and 62-kDa bands seemed to be nonspecific because they were not affected by the presence of antigen peptides in the absorption experiments (Fig.3 A). BecauseXenopus oocytes are not suitable for the functional expression of BAT1 due to the abundant expression of endogenous transporters associated with rBAT (2Wells R.G. Hediger M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5596-5600Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 3Bertran J. Werner A. Moore M.L. Stange G. Markovich D. Biber J. Testar X. Zorzano A. Palacin M. Murer H. Proc.

A. 1992; 89: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), the functional properties of BAT1 were determined by transient expression in COS-7 cells. When BAT1, rBAT, or 4F2hc was solely expressed in COS-7 cells, significant [14C]l-cystine uptake was not detected compared with mock-transfected controls. Large [14C]l-cystine uptake was, however, detected when BAT1 was coexpressed with rBAT but not with 4F2hc, indicating that BAT1 requires rBAT, not 4F2hc, for its functional expression (Fig.3 B). Thus, in subsequent experiments to determine the functional characteristics of BAT1, BAT1 was coexpressed with rBAT in COS-7 cells. BAT1-mediated [14C]l-cystine uptake was dependent on neither Na+ nor Cl− (data not shown). The uptake was saturable and followed the Michaelis-Menten kinetics (see below for K m values). Results from uptake measurements of 14C-labeled amino acids indicated that BAT1 transported l-cystine, l-lysine,l-arginine, l-ornithine, l-leucine,l-phenylalanine, and l-tyrosine at high levels and other neutral amino acids at low levels (Fig.4). The uptake values for glycine and proline were particularly low. Acidic amino acids were not transported by BAT1. The K m/V max values of BAT1 for l-cystine, l-lysine,l-arginine, l-ornithine, l-leucine, and l-phenylalanine were 305 ± 43.4 μm/1,970 ± 380 pmol/mg of protein/min (mean ± S.E. of three separate experiments), 463 μm/2,990 pmol/mg of protein/min, 203 μm/2,570 pmol/mg of protein/min, 387 μm/2,530 pmol/mg of protein/min, 269 μm/1,330 pmol/mg of protein/min, and 190 μm/1,730 pmol/mg of protein/min, respectively. Consistent with the radiolabeled amino acid uptakes, [14C]l-cystine uptake was inhibited byl-isomers of cystine as well as basic and neutral amino acids in the experiments in which [14C]l-cystine uptake (50 μm) was measured in the presence of nonlabeled amino acids (5 mm) (data not shown). System A-selective inhibitor α-(aminomethyl)isobutyric acid and system L-selective inhibitor 2-aminobicyclo-(2, 2, 1)-heptane-2-carboxylic acid had no or weak inhibitory effect on [14C]l-cystine uptake, consistent with the properties of system b0,+. In the present study, we have identified a novel protein (BAT1) that is structurally related to amino acid transporters for system L, system y+L and system x−C (10Kanai Y. Segawa H. Miyamoto K.

Although these transporters require 4F2hc for their functional expression, we found that BAT1 is associated with rBAT and not with 4F2hc to express its function. In the Western blot analyses for BAT1 and rBAT, we showed that two corresponding bands (125 and 251 kDa/231 kDa) were detected under the nonreducing condition, whereas under the reducing condition, the bands shifted to smaller sizes, 41 kDa for BAT1 and 90 kDa for rBAT, which corresponded to the sizes of BAT1 and rBAT proteins (2Wells R.G. Hediger M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5596-5600Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 3Bertran J. Werner A. Moore M.L. Stange G. Markovich D. Biber J. Testar X. Zorzano A.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 389-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), respectively (Fig. 3 A). This suggests that BAT1 and rBAT are linked via disulfide bonds. The 125-kDa band seems to correspond to the heterodimeric complex, whereas the larger bands probably represent multimerized proteins. For transporters that are associated with 4F2hc, it is proposed that a conserved cysteine residue in the extracellular loop between putative transmembrane domains 3 and 4 is responsible for the disulfide bond formation between 4F2hc and transporters (28Pfeiffer R. Spindler B. Loffing J. Skelly P.J. Shoemaker C.B. Verrey F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The corresponding cysteine residue is also conserved for BAT1 (Cys-144). Because rBAT supports the functional expression of BAT1, whereas 4F2hc does not (Fig. 3 B), it is interesting to know what structural feature is responsible for the recognition of partner molecules. BAT1 is expressed predominantly in kidney and small intestine (Fig.2 A). The pattern of expression of BAT1 correlates well with that of rBAT (2Wells R.G. Hediger M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5596-5600Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 3Bertran J. Werner A. Moore M.L. Stange G. Markovich D. Biber J. Testar X. Zorzano A. Palacin M. Murer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

We were able to demonstrate the colocalization of two proteins in the renal proximal tubules (Fig. 2 B). BAT1, as well as rBAT, exists in the apical membrane of the proximal tubules, not in the basolateral membrane where 4F2hc localizes (13Nakamura E. Sato M. Yang H. Miyagawa F. Harasaki M. Tomita K.

The expression of rBAT is the highest in straight convoluted tubules where the expression of BAT1 is fairly low (Fig. 2 B) (22Kanai Y. Stelzner M.G. Lee W.-S. Wells R.G. Brown D. Hediger M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F1087-F1092PubMed Google Scholar, 30Furriols M. Chillaron J. Mora C. Castello A. Bertran J. Camps M. Testar X. Vilaro S. Zorzano A. Palacin M. J. Biol.

When coexpressed with rBAT in COS-7 cells, BAT1 mediates the Na+-independent transport of cystine as well as basic and neutral amino acids with the properties of system b0,+(32von Winkle L.J. Campione A.L. Gorman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3150-3163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The substrate selectivity of BAT1 expressed with rBAT in COS-7 cells is basically consistent with that observed when rBAT is solely expressed in Xenopus oocytes where rBAT is assumed to associate with unidentified oocyte endogenous transporters to activate them (2Wells R.G. Hediger M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5596-5600Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 3Bertran J. Werner A. Moore M.L. Stange G. Markovich D. Biber J. Testar X. Zorzano A.

The K m values for cystine, lysine, arginine, ornithine, leucine, and phenylalanine lie between ∼200 and ∼500 μm. Although these values are higher than those measured in Xenopus oocytes expressed solely with rBAT, they are still regarded as high affinity transports (2Wells R.G. Hediger M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

It has been proposed that the genetic defects of cystine transporters in the renal proximal tubules are responsible for cystinuria (5Palacin M. Estevez R. Bertran J. Zorzano A. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 969-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). The mutation of the rBAT gene was found to be related to autosomal recessive type I cystinuria, whereas type II and type III cystinuria were proposed to be due to mutations of the genes for rBAT-associated transporters (5Palacin M. Estevez R. Bertran J. Zorzano A. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 969-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). It is, therefore, necessary to determine the implications of BAT1 in cystinuria. In conclusion, we have identified the first rBAT-associated transporter BAT1, which is, surprisingly, structurally related to 4F2hc-associated transporters, thereby establishing a family of amino acid transporters associated with type II membrane glycoproteins. This finding will facilitate the understanding of the mechanisms of molecular association between transporters and their partner type II membrane glycoproteins. The results from the present investigation also suggest the presence of still unidentified transporters that are associated with rBAT.

In this study, we have utilized a LAT-deficient mutant of the Jurkat T cell line, J.CaM2, to explore various requirements for LAT function.

The earliest of the signal transduction processes that occur following TCR stimulation include the activation of Src (Lck, Fyn) and Syk (ZAP-70, Syk) families of tyrosine kinases. These kinases subsequently phosphorylate downstream substrates allowing for a continuation of the signaling cascade. Phosphorylation of substrates by Src and Syk kinases can mediate the induction of enzymatic activity, for example with Vav and phospholipase Cγ-1 (PLCγ-1) (3Secrist J.P. Karnitz L. Abraham R.T. J.

One molecule that becomes heavily tyrosine phosphorylated in response to TCR engagement is LAT (Linker for Activation of T Cells), a transmembrane protein whose expression is limited to T, NK, and mast cells. Although LAT lacks intrinsic enzymatic activity, tyrosine phosphorylation at multiple tyrosine residues within LAT facilitates its association with a number of signaling molecules that may contribute to T cell activation, including Grb2, GADs, the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, PLCγ-1, Vav, SLP-76, and Cbl (13Gilliland L.K.

An essential role for LAT in T cell activation has been revealed through the characterization of J.CaM2, a LAT-deficient derivative of the Jurkat T cell line (19Finco T.S. Kadlecek T. Zhang W. Samelson L. Weiss A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 617-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). J.CaM2 cells fail to produce many of the TCR-derived signaling events required for T cell activation, including activation of the Ras pathway, elevation in intracellular Ca2+, and induction of the transcription factor NF-AT. Importantly, re-expression of wild-type LAT in J.CaM2 restores all of these processes (19Finco T.S. Kadlecek T. Zhang W. Samelson L. Weiss A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 617-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). More recently, the analysis of mice that lack LAT expression has also revealed a necessary role for this molecule in T cell development (20Zhang W. Sommers C.L. Burshtyn D.N. Stebbins C.C. DeJarnette J.B. Trible R.P. Grinberg A. Tsay H.C. Jacobs H.M. Kessler C.M. Long E.O. Love P.E. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1999; 10: 323-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). LAT contains a very short extracellular region, a transmembrane domain, and a tyrosine-rich cytoplasmic tail. Consistent with these structural features, LAT is found predominantly in the plasma membrane of T cells (14Buday L. Egan S.E. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Cantrell D.A. Downward J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9019-9023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sieh M. Batzer A. Schlessinger J. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4435-4442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). Furthermore, LAT is palmitoylated on two conserved cysteines (amino acids 26 and 29), and this modification localizes LAT to glycolipid-enriched microdomains (GEMs) within the plasma membrane (21Zhang W. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). GEMs, sometimes referred to as detergent-insoluble lipid rafts, have been proposed to function as platforms for the formation of multi-component signaling complexes (22Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8041) Google Scholar). Interestingly, other molecules in addition to LAT, including Lck, Vav, Grb2, PLCγ-1, and Ras, are also either constitutively associated with GEMs or redistribute into GEMs following TCR engagement (21Zhang W. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar, 23Brdiacka T. Cernay J. Hoarejasai V. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

However, it remains unclear whether the localization of specific molecules to GEMs is actually necessary for their function in T cell signaling. In this report, we demonstrate that LAT must be present in GEMs for the activation of the Ras pathway, an increase in intracellular Ca+2, and the stimulation of NF-AT-dependent transcriptional activity in response to TCR engagement. Also, we show that the extracellular and transmembrane domains of LAT are not required for these processes once LAT has localized to GEMs. The LAT-deficient Jurkat T cell derivative J.CaM2 (26Goldsmith M.A. Dazin P.F. Weiss A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cells were stimulated with C305, an anti-Jurkat Ti β chain mAb (27Weiss A. Stobo J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1284-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar).

For use in transfections, a myc-tagged form of LAT was excised from pBluescript withEcoRI and XbaI and inserted into the expression vector, pcdef3. C26/29S-LAT, also in pcdef3, was created with the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The Lck-LAT chimera was made by digesting pcdef3-LAT with EcoRI andApaLI to remove the extracellular and transmembrane domains of LAT and replacing this region, in frame, with an oligo encoding the N terminus 10 amino acids of Lck. Erk2 and CD8 were expressed from pEF-BOS. The NF-AT-luciferase reporter plasmid has been previously described (29Shapiro V.S. Mollenauer M.N. Greene W.C. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1663-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). 2 × 107J.CaM2 cells were transfected and 20 h later were lysed on ice in 1 ml of 0.5% Triton X-100 in TNE buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) with a combination of protease and phosphatase inhibitors. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Lysates were mixed with 80% sucrose in TNE, transferred to centrifuge tubes, and overlaid with 2 ml of 30% sucrose in TNE and then 1 ml of 5% sucrose in TNE. Samples were centrifuged for 20–22 h at 45,000 rpm in a Beckman SW55Ti at 4 °C, and twelve 400-μl fractions were collected from the top of each gradient. For transient transfections, 2 × 107 J.CaM2 cells in 400 μl of RPMI 1640 were electroporated at 250 V, 960 microfarads with 30–50 μg of DNA total. Unless otherwise noted, 2.5–10 μg of the various LAT vectors were used to obtain equal protein expression. TCR stimulation for analysis of LAT and ERK2 phosphorylation involved incubating PBS-washed cells (8 × 107cells/ml) at 37 °C for 15 min followed by addition of anti-TCR mAb (1:500) or PBS as a control for 2 min. Cells were immediately pelleted and lysed. For TCR stimulation in luciferase assays, cells were either left untreated or were incubated with immobilized anti-TCR mAb or PMA (25 ng/ml) and ionomycin (1 μm) for 6 h. Cells were then harvested, lysed, and assayed for luciferase activity (29Shapiro V.S. Mollenauer M.N. Greene W.C. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1663-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed at 107 cells/150 μl in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mm EDTA, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors). After a 10-min incubation on ice, samples were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. For immunoprecipitations, lysates were incubated with primary antibody for at least 1 h and then protein G-Sepharose beads for 1 h. Beads were then washed three times in 500 μl of lysis buffer. Samples were resuspended in reducing SDS sample buffer, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and separated by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore) for analysis by Western blotting. Membranes were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin, incubated with the indicated primary antibodies followed by the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Reactive proteins were subsequently visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). J.CaM2 cells were transfected with the various LAT constructs and 20 μg of vector encoding CD8. 20 h after transfection, cells were incubated with anti-CD8 mAb conjugated to phycoerythrin (Becton Dickinson), then washed and incubated with the Ca2+ indicator Fluo-3-AM (Molecular Probes) at a final concentration of 2.5 μm. After a 30-min incubation, samples were again washed, resuspended in 1 ml, and subsequently warmed to 37 °C for 5 min prior to analysis by FACScan (Becton Dickinson). Although palmitoylation of LAT on cysteines 26 and 29 is not necessary for LAT localization to the plasma membrane, it is essential for its distribution into GEMs (21Zhang W. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). To determine whether the presence of LAT within GEMs is required for coupling TCR engagement to downstream signaling events, an expression vector was created encoding a form of LAT containing serines instead of cysteines at these palmitoylation sites (C26/29S-LAT). Although C26/29S-LAT was expressed at levels similar to wild-type LAT (WT-LAT) following transfection of vectors encoding either protein into LAT-deficient J.CaM2 T cells (Fig.1 A), C26/29S-LAT was completely absent in GEM fractions and, instead, was found exclusively in the Triton-soluble fraction (Fig. 1 B). Conversely, a majority of transfected WT-LAT was found in GEMs with little detected in the Triton-soluble fraction (Fig. 1 B). To ensure that our method of GEM isolation yielded fractions devoid of cross-contamination, we also assayed for the presence of markers that specifically localize to GEM and Triton-soluble fractions, namely the ganglioside GM1 (using cholera toxin) and ZAP-70, respectively. Consistent with other studies (21Zhang W. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar, 25Xavier R. Brennan T. Li Q. McCormack C. Seed B. Immunity. 1998; 8: 723-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar), we detected the ganglioside GM1 only in the GEM fraction and ZAP-70 only in the Triton-soluble fraction of unstimulated cells (data not shown). Following TCR engagement, LAT becomes heavily tyrosine phosphorylated. To determine whether LAT localization to GEMs is required for its inducible tyrosine phosphorylation, J.CaM2 cells were transfected with vectors encoding either WT-LAT or C26/29S-LAT and subsequently stimulated through the TCR followed by the analysis of LAT phosphorylation. Surprisingly, C26/29S-LAT was constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in the basal state (Fig.2). However, consistent with previous results (21Zhang W. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar), the inability of LAT to localize to GEMs correlated in its lack of inducible tyrosine phosphorylation following TCR stimulation (Fig. 2). As expected, tyrosine phosphorylation of transfected WT-LAT was not appreciable in the basal state but increased dramatically following TCR engagement (Fig. 2). Thus, mutation of cysteines 26 and 29 to serines in LAT abrogated its localization to GEMs and resulted in its constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation. In addition, C26/29S-LAT also failed to display enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation following TCR engagement. In contrast to the response seen in wild-type Jurkat T cells following TCR engagement, LAT-deficient J.CaM2 cells fail to display an activation of the Ras signaling pathway, an increase in intracellular Ca2+, or an induction of the transcription factor NF-AT. Importantly, re-expression of wild type LAT in J.CaM2 restores all of these processes (19Finco T.S. Kadlecek T. Zhang W. Samelson L. Weiss A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 617-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Because C26/29S-LAT exhibited a significant constitutive level of tyrosine phosphorylation in J.CaM2, it was conceivable that it may be able to function in TCR-mediated signaling despite its inability to associate with GEMs or display inducible tyrosine phosphorylation. To examine this possibility, C26/29S-LAT was transfected into J.CaM2 and cells were subsequently stimulated through the TCR receptor followed by analysis for Ras activation, intracellular Ca2+ increases, and NF-AT induction. Control experiments were performed in tandem by transfecting J.CaM2 with either empty vector or a vector encoding WT-LAT. To examine the Ras signaling pathway, we focused on the phosphorylation of Erk2, which occurs as a consequence of Ras activation in T cells following TCR engagement (30Izquierdo M. Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J. Cantrell D. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1199-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous results (19Finco T.S. Kadlecek T. Zhang W. Samelson L. Weiss A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 617-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), J.CaM2 cells receiving WT-LAT, but not empty vector, demonstrated Erk2 phosphorylation following TCR engagement (Fig.3 A). Interestingly, cells expressing C26/29S-LAT failed to exhibit Erk2 phosphorylation in response to TCR stimulation (Fig. 3 B). A similar pattern of results was seen when the levels of intracellular Ca2+ and induction of NF-AT were analyzed; cells receiving WT-LAT but not C26/29S-LAT restored intracellular Ca2+ mobilization (Fig.3 B) and activation of NF-AT (Fig.4) in response to TCR engagement. Together these results indicate that LAT localization to GEMs is required for coupling TCR stimulation with downstream signaling events.Figure 4TCR-mediated NF-AT activity in the presence of various LAT variants. J.CaM2 cells were transfected with 10–40 ng of the various Myc-tagged LAT vectors (to obtain equal protein expression) and 15 μg of the NF-AT-luciferase reporter construct. 19 h later, equal numbers of cells were either left untreated or stimulated with immobilized anti-TCR mAb for 6 h and then lysed, and the level of luciferase activity was measured. Shown is the average and standard error in relative light units of three independent experiments. wt LAT, wild-type LAT.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As an initial step toward identifying regions of LAT required for function, we focused on its extracellular and transmembrane domains. Because our results suggested that LAT must localize to GEMs to facilitate activation of downstream signaling pathways, we studied the role of these domains in the context of GEMs. A vector was created that encoded a form of LAT where the extracellular and transmembrane domains were replaced with the first 10 amino acids from the N terminus of Lck (Lck-LAT). This Lck motif provides the necessary signals for myristoylation and palmitoylation and when attached to a heterologous protein can target it to GEMs (31Zlatkine P. Mehul B. Magee A.I. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 673-679PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, Lck-LAT should localize to GEMs but will lack both the extracellular and transmembrane domains of LAT. As shown in Fig. 1, A andB, respectively, Lck-LAT was expressed at levels comparable with WT-LAT and localized primarily to the GEM fraction of cell lysates. We next analyzed Lck-LAT phosphorylation, and in a manner similar to WT-LAT, Lck-LAT became heavily tyrosine phosphorylated after engagement of the TCR (Fig. 2). Furthermore, cells expressing Lck-LAT demonstrated TCR-mediated activation of the Ras signaling pathway (Fig.3 A), mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ (Fig.3 B), and induction of NF-AT (Fig. 4). Taken together, the results obtained with Lck-LAT demonstrated that once LAT localizes to GEMs, both its extracellular and transmembrane domains were dispensable for coupling TCR engagement to the activation of downstream signaling pathways. Glycolipid-enriched microdomains (GEMs) have increasingly been implicated as critical components of intracellular signaling cascades. In T cells for instance, a number of important signaling molecules have been shown to localize to GEMs, either constitutively or following TCR stimulation. In addition, treatment of T cells with various agents that disrupt GEM structure can inhibit effective TCR signaling (25Xavier R. Brennan T. Li Q. McCormack C. Seed B. Immunity. 1998; 8: 723-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Thus, the formation of GEM-dependent, higher order signaling complexes may play a central role in T cell activation. The contribution of LAT to T cell activation likely derives from its TCR-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation, a process which facilitates LAT association with multiple signaling proteins, including Grb2, GADs, SLP-76, Vav, PLCγ-1, Cbl, and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The interaction of these molecules with LAT may result in their activation and/or may promote protein-protein interactions that are crucial for downstream signaling events. Here we demonstrate that a form of the adaptor molecule LAT (C26/29S-LAT) that fails to localize to GEMs cannot support TCR-mediated signal transduction. These results are consistent with other studies that have suggested that GEMs play an important role in T cell activation. More importantly however, our results strongly suggest that LAT function may depend on its ability to recruit multiple signaling proteins to GEMs, where proper protein interactions can form and/or where essential substrates may be located. Relevant to this idea is the observation that C26/29S-LAT displayed a high level of basal tyrosine phosphorylation yet could not support productive TCR signaling. One conceivable explanation for this result is that, although C26/29S-LAT binds critical signaling molecules, it is unable to couple TCR engagement to downstream signaling processes because of its failure to localize into GEMs. Alternatively, because LAT contains nine sites of potential tyrosine phosphorylation, it is possible that the constitutive sites of tyrosine phosphorylation in C26/29S-LAT are not those that mediate the recruitment of appropriate signaling molecules. Of note, previous analysis of a GEM-excluded LAT variant containing alanines in place of cysteines at residues 26 and 29 did not reveal a high constitutive level of LAT tyrosine phosphorylation (21Zhang W. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Although an explanation for this discrepancy is presently lacking, variations in results may reflect the different cell types utilized (Jurkat versus J.CaM2) or experimental approaches employed (transient versus stable transfection of LAT variants). In this study we also addressed which domains of LAT are critical for function once the protein has localized to GEMs. In particular, we focused on the potential role of the extracellular and transmembrane domains. A comparison of LAT protein sequences from mouse, human, and rat revealed the presence of a conserved, α-helix disrupting proline within the transmembrane domain, which could potentially destabilize LAT insertion into lipid bilayers (17Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar, 18Weber J.R. Orstavik S. Torgersen K.M. Danbolt N.C. Berg S.F. Ryan J.C. Tasken K. Imboden J.B. Vaage J.T. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Often, proteins which contain such atypical amino acids within the transmembrane region are stabilized through the interaction of this domain with other molecules. It was therefore possible that LAT interacted with another protein via its transmembrane domain and that this interaction may be critical for LAT function. It was also possible that the extracellular and transmembrane domains were required for LAT function by some other mechanism. However, our results clearly show that both the extracellular and transmembrane domains are dispensable in coupling TCR engagement to the activation of the Ras signaling pathway, intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, and NF-AT activation. It is possible that these domains are required for other functions of LAT. For example, the transmembrane region may initially localize LAT to the plasma membrane, permitting palmitoylation of LAT on cysteine residues 26 and 29 and thereby resulting in subsequent LAT insertion into GEMs. Alternatively, the extracellular and transmembrane domains may be required for coupling TCR engagement to downstream pathways that were not examined in the present study or that are required for functions independent of signaling. Future studies will hopefully address these alternative possibilities."

In this study, we have characterized the expression patterns of skeletal (alpha(1S)) and cardiac (alpha(1C)) L-type VDCCs during cardiogenic differentiation in H9C2 cells that derived from embryonic rat heart. We report that chronic treatment of H9C2 cells with 10 nM all-trans-retinoic acid (all-trans-RA) enhanced cardiac Ca(2+) channel expression, as demonstrated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting, and indirect immunofluorescence studies, as well as patch-clamp experiments. In addition, RA treatment prevented expression of functional skeletal L-type VDCCs, which were restricted to myotubes that spontaneously appear in control H9C2 cultures undergoing myogenic transdifferentiation. The use of specific skeletal and cardiac markers indicated that RA, by preventing myogenic transdifferentiation, preserves cardiac differentiation of this cell line. Altogether, we provide evidence that cardiac and skeletal subtype-specific L-type Ca(2+) channels are relevant functional markers of differentiated cardiac and skeletal myocytes, respectively. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that in vitro RA stimulates cardiac (alpha(1C)) L-type Ca(2+) channel expression, therefore supporting the hypothesis that the RA pathway might be involved in the tissue specific expression of Ca(2+) channels in mature cardiac cells."

Some of these peptides are stored in intracellular compartments and their release allows for an immediate response when infections occur.

Linear peptide antibiotics, such as magainins and cecropins, are thought to express their biological activity by related mechanisms (17Segrest J.P. De L. Dohlman J.G. Brouillette C.G. Anantharamaiah G.M. Proteins. 1990; 8: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Although they show no primary sequence homology, they are all positively charged and form amphipathic α-helices in the presence of lipid membranes. Experimental evidence suggests that direct peptide-lipid interactions are important for the expression of antibiotic activity of these substances (18Wade D. Boman A. Wahlin B. Drain C.M. Andreu D. Boman H.G. Merrifield R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4761-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar), rather than specific association with a chiral receptor. In particular, the first recognition and membrane association is strongly governed by electrostatic interactions with the negative surface charges of the bacterial cell wall and/or the plasma membrane (19Matsuzaki K. Harada M. Funakoshi S. Fujii N. Miyajima K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1063: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 20Wenk M.R. Seelig J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3909-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). There is good agreement that this class of polypeptides exerts its antibiotic activity by permeabilizing the membranes of sensitive cells, which results in decoupling of the transmembrane ionic gradients and consecutively cell death (21Juretic D. Hendler R.W. Kamp F. Caughey W.S. Zasloff M. Westerhoff H.V. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4562-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 22Westerhoff H.V. Juretic D. Hendler R.W. Zasloff M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6597-6601Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of membrane permeabilization are, however, unknown and several models have been proposed to explain the interaction of polypeptides with lipid bilayers (23Bechinger B. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 156: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Electrophysiological single channel recordings are difficult to perform because amphipathic peptide antibiotics exhibit a strong propensity to destabilize lipid bilayers. In a few cases, however, stepwise fluctuations in conductivity have been observed, the step-size ranging over 3 orders of magnitude (24Cruciani R.A. Barker J.L. Durell S.R. Raghunathan G. Guy H.R. Zasloff M. Stanley E.F. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 226: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 25Duclohier H. Molle G. Spach G. Biophys. J. 1989; 56: 1017-1021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Based on these observations a transmembrane helical bundle, with a water-filled pore lined by basic and polar residues, has been suggested to be the active configuration (26Sansom M.S. Eur. Biophys. J. 1993; 22: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The formation of a similar peptide aggregate has been suggested to explain the pores formed by the dodecamer alamethicin (27Boheim G. J. Membr. Biol. 1974; 19: 277-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 28Rizzo V. Stankowski S. Schwarz G. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2751-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). These latter polypeptides lack the high charge density and the electrophysiological properties are defined much more reproducibly when compared with amphipathic peptides. The observed small cation specificity of the channels formed by positively charged peptides resulted in an extension of this first model, in which the basic transmembrane peptides together with negatively charged lipids form the pore (23Bechinger B. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 156: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Structural studies indicate that the large majority of charged amphipathic peptides are oriented along the bilayer surface at physiological peptide-to-lipid ratios (29Bechinger B. Zasloff M. Opella S.J. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 2077-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In addition, association of several peptides in transmembrane helical bundles with many basic lysine residues accumulating in the pore lumen seems energetically unfavorable (23Bechinger B. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 156: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The possibility of a detergent-like membrane disruption that is based on the bilayer destabilizing properties of amphipathic peptides has, therefore, also been taken into consideration (23Bechinger B. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 156: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Our present understanding of the energies involved in peptide-lipid and peptide-peptide interactions is insufficient to safely test for all possible macromolecular aggregation states that could be involved in pore formation by a merely theoretical analysis. Experiments are, therefore, required that allow one to test the validity of the suggested models. In order to gain further insight into the mechanisms of antibiotic activity and channel formation we designed synthetic model peptides and investigated their functional and biophysical properties (30Bechinger B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 768-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). One of them, LAH41 with the sequence KKALLALALHHLAHLALHLALALKKA-NH2, forms an amphipathic α-helix (Fig. 1). Whereas four terminal lysines serve as membrane anchors and improve the solubility of the peptide, four histidines in the central part of the peptide allow one to alter the charge of the peptide in a pH-dependent manner without altering its chemical composition. The presence of an amidated carboxyl group is a modification also found in nature and ensures that the COOH terminus is uncharged. Alanines and leucines were chosen to form a hydrophobic surface as they show a high propensity to form α-helical structures. Oriented solid-state NMR and ATR-FTIR spectroscopies indicate that the topology of LAH4 depends on the pH of the external medium (30Bechinger B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 768-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 44Bechinger B. Ruysschaert J.M. Goormaghtigh E. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 552-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The protonation states of the histidines are pH-dependent, and, as a result LAH4 switches reversibly from a transmembrane alignment at neutral pH into an orientation along the bilayer surface when the surrounding medium is acidified. The midpoint of the transition between the two states is governed mainly by hydrophobic, electrostatic, and polar interactions. In case of models in which transmembrane helical aggregates form the active configuration one would, therefore, expect that this peptide is by 2 to 3 orders less active in functional assays at acidic pH when compared with neutral proton activity. We will show that this designed sequence exhibits antibiotic activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria in a similar concentration range, as do naturally occurring polypeptides. Under the same experimental conditions, however, this family of antibiotic peptides does not induce release of hemoglobin from red blood cells. The characterization of this peptide is, therefore, not only interesting because of its potential pharmaceutical use, but the analysis of its structural and functional properties as a function of pH also allows one to obtain a more general knowledge of the mechanisms of channel formation and antibiotic activity of amphipathic peptides. The release of the fluorescent dye calcein from POPC and POPG large unilamellar vesicles is used to quantitatively characterize the pore forming activities of LAH4 in well defined model systems. We will show that the LAH4-induced release of fluorescent dye exhibits considerable quantitative and qualitative differences when added to zwitterionic or acidic model membranes. Phospholipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL), calcein and fluorescein labeled dextran (M r 3,000 and 10,000) from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). The peptides LAH4(M r 2,777) and LAH4-Trp12 (M r 2,849) with the sequence KKALLALALHHLAHLALHLALALKKA-NH2 and KKALLALALHHWAHLALHLALALKKA-NH2, respectively, were synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis on a Millipore 9060 automatic peptide synthesizer using Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl) chemistry. The synthetic product was purified using reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography. The identity and purity was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Escherichia coli andBacillus subtilis with catalogue numbers DSM-3948 and DSM-675, respectively, were from the Deutsche Sammlung für Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH (Braunschweig, Germany). A bacterial pre-culture in Luria broth was started from a single colony and grown overnight at 37 °C. 100 μl of this culture was used to inoculate 10 ml and grown to mid-logarithmic phase. The cells were diluted with LB to OD600 = 0.05 (approximately 4 × 107cells/ml). 30 μl of 2-fold peptide dilutions in LB medium were added to 200-μl aliquots of the bacterial suspension. This mixture was grown at 37 °C until the controls reached an OD600 of 5 (approximately 4 h). 4 ml of fresh human blood, collected in tubes containing 6 mg of EDTA, was washed three times with a buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.3, and resuspended in the same buffer to obtain a 2% suspension. 30 μl of a peptide solution, prepared as 2-fold dilutions, was added to 200 μl of the red blood cell suspension. After incubation at 37 °C for 4 h the solutions were centrifuged. The OD550 in the supernatant provides a reliable indicator of the release of hemoglobin from red blood cells. CD spectra were recorded on an auto-dichrograph mark IV (Jibon-Yvon) in the range 190–260 nm using quartz cuvettes with a path length of 0.2 mm. 10 scans were averaged and corrected for the contributions of vesicles and buffer. Small unilamellar vesicles were prepared by sonication to reduce the influence of scattering at low wavelength. The peptide/lipid ratio was 1/150 (mol/mol) at a peptide concentration of 0.23 mg/ml. The molar ellipticity was calculated usingd 10-camphorsulfonic acid (Θ290.5 = 7783 deg cm2 dmol−1, OD285 = 34.5m−1 cm−1) as in Ref. 31Chen G.C. Yang J.T. Anal. Lett. 1977; 10: 1195-1207Crossref Scopus (397) Google Scholar. For quantitative studies of peptide membrane association the tryptophan analogue of LAH4 was investigated. The tryptophan in this peptide is located at position 12 (LAH4-Trp12), therefore, it resides on the hydrophobic face approximately in the middle of the amphipatic helix (Fig. 1). Tryptophan fluorescence emission spectra were recorded in the range 290–400 nm with an excitation wavelength of 280 nm using a Perkin-Elmer 50b spectrofluorometer. Phospholipid small unilamellar vesicles, prepared by extrusion through 50-nm filters, were injected into a solution of 6 μm LAH4-Trp12 at 37 °C. The measured intensities were corrected for the contribution of light scattering in the presence of vesicles. A membrane insertion model was used to analyze the experimental data, which results in the following sigmoidal function, I=LKd+L(Imax−Io)+IoEquation 1 where I 0 and I are the fluorescent intensities at 330 nm before and after injection of the lipid vesicles, respectively, I max is the maximum intensity, L the lipid concentration, andK d the dissociation constant. Least square line fit analysis was used to extract the dissociation constants from experimental measurements of the fluorescence intensity. Dried films of phospholipids (30 μmol) were hydrated with 1 ml of a solution containing 60 mm calcein or 10 mmfluorescein-labeled dextrans, respectively, 10 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 50 mm buffer. The buffers used were: ethanolamine, pH 8.5; Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; and acetate, pH 5.5 or pH 4.5. The suspensions were exposed to 10 freeze-thaw cycles and extruded through 200-nm filters (LipoFast, Avestin, Inc., Ottawa, Canada) (32MacDonald R.C. MacDonald R.I. Menco B. Takeshita K. Subbarao N.K. Hu L.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1061: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). Fluorescent dye not enclosed within the vesicles was removed by gel filtration (Sephacryl-S300HR, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The final concentration of phospholipid was determined by phosphorus analysis (33Rouser G. Fleischer S. Yamamoto A. Lipids. 1970; 5: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2880) Google Scholar). The release of calcein from vesicles was followed with fluorescence spectroscopy using an emission wavelength of 517 nm. The excitation wavelength was chosen in the range 430–490 nm to obtain a quantum yield well within the optimal work range of the photo detector. When entrapped within lipid vesicles, calcein self-quenches to approximately 80% at concentrations >20 mm. Under our experimental conditions at the highest lipid concentration (30 μm) the calcein concentration in the cuvette after addition of Triton X-100 is 5 μm, which is well within the lower linear region. The release of fluorescent dye was initiated by injecting 10 μl of peptide solution into 800 μl of buffer containing the appropriate amount of large unilamellar vesicles (≤30 μm) loaded with fluorescent dye. The release of fluorescent dye was calculated according to, Rf=(Ft−F0)/(FT−F0)Equation 2 where R f is the fraction of dye released,F 0, F t, andF T are the fluorescence intensities at timest = 0, t, or after addition of 10 μl 10% reduced Triton X-100, respectively. The ratioF 0/F T ranged from 0.1 to 0.3 and is a function of the pH and the vesicular phospholipid composition. In the absence of peptide or detergent, POPC and POPG large unilamellar vesicles retained the enclosed dye for a time period of several weeks. The experiments were performed at 37 °C, well above the phase transition temperatures of POPC and POPG (both at −2 °C). Control experiments using proton-decoupled 31P solid-state NMR spectroscopy (50Bechinger B. Kinder R. Helmle M. Vogt T.C. Harzer U. Schinzel S. Biopolymers. 1999; 51Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) show no evidence for major changes in the macroscopic phase properties of these phospholipid membranes due to the presence of LAH4. In order to test for the antibiotic activity of LAH4the growth of bacterial cells was determined as a function of peptide concentration (Fig. 2). At pH 5.5 and in the presence of ≥0.1 mg/ml (∼36 μm) LAH4or magainin 2 the growth rate of the Gram-negative bacterium E. coli is considerably reduced when compared with peptide-free media. At pH 7.5, however, the same LAH4 concentration barely influences the growth of E. coli cells. At this pH the histidines of LAH4 are uncharged and growth inhibition is only observed at much higher peptide concentrations (1 mg/ml). The antibiotic activity of magainin 2 is also shown in Fig. 2 and independent of pH. The minimal concentration at which magainin 2 inhibits growth of E. coli is found to be 42 μg/ml (17 μm) in agreement with previously published results (34Matsuzaki K. Sugishita K. Harada M. Fujii N. Miyajima K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1327: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). To determine whether LAH4 is bacteriotoxic or bacteriostatic the number of surviving cells at the lowest peptide concentration at which full growth inhibition is observed (28 μg/ml (10 μm) at pH 5.5) was measured by counting the number of surviving cells in a dilution series on agar plates. Out of a starting density of 4 × 107 cells/ml only 103cells/ml survived. A similar result was obtained in the presence of 50 μm magainin 2. Together with the observation that the optical density at 600 nm decreases immediately after the addition of peptide, these results indicate that LAH4 is bacteriotoxic. The antibiotic activity of LAH4 is even more pronounced when added to cultures of the Gram-positive B. subtilis. Full growth inhibition is observed even at the lowest concentrations tested (0.2 μm at pH 7.5 and pH 5.5). The lowest concentration at which full growth inhibition is observed for magainin under the same experimental conditions is 26 μm. As a test for the cytotoxic activity of LAH4 against eukaryotic organisms we studied the release of hemoglobin from human red blood cells. The open symbols in Fig. 2 show the absence of hemolysis at concentrations where LAH4 or magainin exhibit antibiotic activities. The secondary structure of LAH4 was investigated under the experimental conditions that are applied during the studies presented in this paper using circular dichroism. Fig.3 A shows CD spectra of 100 μm LAH4 as a function of pH and in the absence of membranes. At acidic pH, when the histidines are charged, the peptide exhibits random coil structures. At basic pH the increased ellipticity at 222 nm indicates that helical conformations are induced. The helical content at pH 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 7.5, and 8.5 was calculated from the ellipticity at 222 nm (35Wu C.S. Ikeda K. Yang J.T. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 566-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) to be 13, 26, 30, 39, and 43%, respectively. The peptide LAH4 was designed to form amphipathic or hydrophobic α-helical structures in the presence of membranes at high or low proton activity. CD spectroscopy indicates that addition of phospholipid membranes (Fig. 3 B) induces helical conformations in LAH4. The apparent helix content of LAH4 at pH 5.5 increases from 26% in the absence of membranes to 55% and 70% in the presence of POPC or POPG, respectively. This observation is also in accordance with previous results obtained by solution NMR spectroscopy in the presence of detergent micelles (30Bechinger B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 768-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). At pH 5.5 the formation of helical conformations is more pronounced in the presence of the negatively charged phospholipid POPG when compared with the zwitterionic POPC (Fig. 3 B). The formation of helical structures due to association with membrane interfaces and/or peptide aggregation has also been observed for magainins (36Matsuzaki K. Murase O. Tokuda H. Funakoshi S. Fujii N. Miyajima K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3342-3349Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), melittin (37Bello J. Bello H.R. Granados E. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 461-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and other amphipathic polypeptides (38Sansom M.S.P. Progr. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1991; 55: 139-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The association of LAH4 was quantitatively studied with the help of a tryptophan-labeled analogue and fluorescence spectroscopy. Fig. 4 indicates that the addition of phospholipid model membranes to a solution of LAH4-Trp12 results in a blue shift of the emission maximum wavelength (from 350 to 330 nm) and a concomitant increase in intensity at 330 nm. This result suggests that the tryptophan residue is located in the hydrophobic interior of the phospholipid membrane. Association of LAH4-Trp12 reaches equilibrium within 30 s after injection of the vesicle dispersion into the peptide solution. The spectral changes were used to determine the amount of bound peptide as a function of lipid concentration as well as the apparent dissociation constant of LAH4-Trp12 (TableI). The positively charged peptide exhibits a 2 orders of magnitude lower apparent dissociation constant in the presence of negatively charged POPG when compared with the zwitterionic phospholipid POPC. Dissociation constants with liquid crystalline phospholipid membranes in the 10−6m range are also observed for other amphipathic peptides such as magainin (39Matsuzaki K. Harada M. Handa T. Funakoshi S. Fujii N. Yajima H. Miyajima K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 981: 130-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), melittin (40Beschiaschvili G. Seelig J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), or synthetic model polypeptides (41Polozov I.V. Polozova A.I. Mishra V.K. Anantharamaiah G.M. Segrest J.P. Epand R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1368: 343-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The POPC dissociation constant of LAH4 at pH 7.5 has been determined to be 239 μm, and corresponds to an association energy of −20 to −30 kJ/mol. The higher dissociation constant (356 μm) observed at acidic pH can be explained by the increased positive charge density of LAH4 due to histidines which augments the peptide solubility in aqueous environments.Table IDissociation (Kd) and activity constants (KA) as well as the relative activity of LAH4-Trp12 at pH 5.5 and 7.5, respectivelypH 5.5pH 7.5K dK ARelative activityK dK ARelative activityPOPC356 × 10−6310 × 10−68578239 × 10−6100 × 10−61857POPG4.7 × 10−618 × 10−663.9 × 10−63.3 × 10−61The dissociation constants were determined experimentally in the presence of 6 μm peptide, the activity constants in the presence of 0.14 μm LAH4-Trp12.K d and K A are used to calculate the relative activities of membrane-associated peptide (normalized to the value obtained in the presence of POPG at pH 7.5).

Open table in a new tab The dissociation constants were determined experimentally in the presence of 6 μm peptide, the activity constants in the presence of 0.14 μm LAH4-Trp12.K d and K A are used to calculate the relative activities of membrane-associated peptide (normalized to the value obtained in the presence of POPG at pH 7.5). The estimated errors from two to four experiments are within 10%. Whereas association of LAH4 with zwitterionic membranes is well described by models where the peptide is in exchange between the aqueous and the membrane phase, such a mechanistic model is insufficient when its association to POPG membranes is analyzed. The enhanced association of this basic peptide with this negatively charged membrane can, however, be accounted for by its accumulation within the Helmholtz double layer along the bilayer surface due to electrostatic attraction and subsequent intercalation into the membrane. It is noteworthy that in the absence of lipid the fluorescence maximum of 6 μm LAH4 solutions shifts to a lower wavelength when the pH values of the LAH4 solutions are increased. At the same time the fluorescence intensity measured at 330 nm is 3-fold higher at pH 7.5 as compared with pH 5.5 (Fig. 4). This shift of the fluorescence maximum is also present when the peptide is diluted 10-fold. In the presence of phospholipids the maximal fluorescence intensity and the fluorescence emission maximum are independent of the pH value. These observations suggest that at basic pH small peptide aggregates form in which the hydrophobic residues are buried. This result is in accordance with the pH-dependent increase in helicity observed during CD measurements (Fig. 3 A). The reversible pH and salt-dependent formation of aggregates (probably tetramers) has also been observed for melittin in aqueous environments (37Bello J. Bello H.R. Granados E. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 461-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). To characterize the functional mechanisms of membrane permeabilization in quantitative detail, the release of calcein from model membrane vesicles was investigated. Fig.5 A shows a recording of the fluorescence intensity of large unilamellar vesicles loaded with calcein. At the beginning of the recording the calcein fluorescence is significantly reduced due to self-quenching of the concentrated fluorophore (60 mm). A significant increase in fluorescence"

Recently, we isolated cDNA of the galactosyltransferase I (XGalT-1) (Okajima, T., Yoshida, K., Kondo, T., and Furukawa, K. (1999) J. Biol. Chem.274, 22915–22918). Therefore, we analyzed mutations in this gene of a patient with progeroid type E-D syndrome by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing. Two changes of G and T to A and C at 186 and 206, respectively, were detected. Then, we determined the genomic DNA sequences encompassing the A186D and L206P mutations, revealing that the unaffected parents and two siblings were heterozygous for either one of the two different mutations and normal, while the patient had both of two different mutant genes. Enzymatic functions of cDNA clones of XGalT-1 containing the individual mutations were examined, elucidating that L206P clone completely lost the activity, while A186D retained ∼50% or 10% of the activity when analyzed with extracts from cDNA transfectant cells or recombinant soluble enzymes, respectively. Moreover, L206P enzyme showed diffuse staining in the cytoplasm of transfectant cells, while the wild type or A186D clones showed Golgi pattern. These results indicated that the mutations in XGalT-1 were at least one of main molecular basis for progeroid type E-D syndrome.

Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1980: 267-371Crossref Google Scholar). GAG synthesis is initiated by the transfer of xylose onto serine residues in core proteins. Sequential addition of two galactoses, and a glucuronic acid forms a common linkage structure detected in major proteoglycans. Alternative addition of GlcNAc or GalNAc residues to the common linkage structure leads to the formation of heparin/heparan sulfate or that of chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate, respectively. Defects in the pathway of GAG synthesis should, therefore, cause serious abnormalities in a wide variety of tissues and organs, since proteoglycans are ubiquitously present and are thought to be involved in the regulation of cell proliferation/differentiation, tissue development and organogenesis (2Wight T.N. Kinsella M.G. Qwarnstrom E.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 793-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), and infections (3Rostand K.S. Esko J.D. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Progeroid type Ehlers-Danlos (E-D) syndrome (OMIM 130070) was reported to be caused by defects in a glycosyltransferase, i.e.galactosyltransferase I (4Quentin E. Gladen A. Rodén L. Kresse H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1342-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) (EC 2.4.1.133), which is involved in the synthesis of common linkage regions of proteoglycans. Recently, we have isolated a cDNA of the galactosyltransferase I gene (XGalT-1) (5Okajima T. Yoshida K. Kondo T. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22915-22918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) from a cDNA library of a human melanoma cell line based on the search of expressed sequence tag data base. This gene showed high homology (38%) to Caenorhabditis elegans sqv-3 gene (6Herman T. Horvitz H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 974-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and its product showed specific activity of galactosyltransferase uponp-nitrophenyl-β-d-xylopyranoside with β1,4 linkage. Moreover, expression of the cDNA in the mutant CHO cells deficient of heparan sulfate expression resulted in the restoration of the expression of both heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, indicating that the gene codes XGalT-1. Thus, availability of this gene enabled us to elucidate the molecular basis of progeroid type E-D syndrome. In the present study, we report two different missense mutations in theXGalT-1 gene of a patient with progeroid type E-D syndrome, both of which were derived from his parents. We confirmed the functional defects of those cDNAs harboring individual mutations by introducing into XGalT-1 deficient mutant CHO cells. Moreover, we analyzed the alteration in the intracellular localization of the mutant enzymes. These results have clearly elucidated molecular basis for the defects in the GAG synthesis, and indicated the mechanisms for the pathogenesis of progeroid type E-D syndrome. The clinical symptoms and signs of the patient with progeroid E-D syndrome were by Kresse et al. (7Kresse H. Rosthoj S. Quentin E. Hollmann J. Glossl J. Okada S. Tonnesen T. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1987; 41: 436-453PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the patient exhibited an aged appearance, developmental delay, dwarfism, craniofacial dysproportion, generalized osteopenia, defective wound healing, hypermobile joints, hypotonic muscles, and loose but elastic skin. Enzyme assay of galactosyltransferase I revealed a marked reduction in galactosyltransferase I activity in the patient's fibroblasts (less than 120 of normal), and a moderate decrease in the parents (∼½ of normal) (4Quentin E. Gladen A. Rodén L. Kresse H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1342-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar).

Established skin fibroblasts from the patient and his family were used as a source of RNA and DNA for mutation analysis. The entire coding region ofXGalT-1 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of cDNA prepared from total RNA as described previously (5Okajima T. Yoshida K. Kondo T. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22915-22918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). PCR was performed with primers XGT-20 (5′-ATGCGCCGCCGCCTCTCCGCA-3′) and XGT3GSP1 (5′-GCCACTCCACATCCTGTCAG-3′). The products were subcloned and sequenced by the dideoxy termination method using an ABI PRISM® 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). To perform pedigree analysis, DNA segments encompassing the A186D and L206P mutations were amplified from genomic DNAs by PCR using the primers XGTF460 (5′-AACAGCACGGACTACATTGCC-3′) and XGTR622 (5′-CAGCCGGTAGTGCTGCTT-3′). The amplified products were directly sequenced using primer XGTF460 as described above. Truncated form of XGalT-1 lacking 53 amino acids from the N terminus, was prepared by PCR using a 5′ primer containing an EcoRI site, 5′-CAGCTCGAATTCTCTGGGGACGTGGCCCGG-3′, and a 3′ primer containing a XhoI site, 5′-TGTCCACTCGAGTCAGCTGAATGTGCACCA-3′ (nucleotides 1007–1024), and subcloned into EcoRI and XhoI sites of pCD-SA vector (kindly provided by Dr. Tsuji) as described (5Okajima T. Yoshida K. Kondo T. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22915-22918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Full-length coding region of the cDNA was inserted at the down stream of a Myc epitope tag, which had been previously inserted into a mammalian expression vector pCDNA3 (Invitrogen). XGalT-1-deficient mutant CHO line pgsB-761 was transfected with wild type (WT), A186D and L206P cDNAs in pMIKneo expression vector (kindly presented by Dr. K. Maruyama at Tokyo Medical and Dental University) with LipofectAMINETM (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instruction. CHO mutant pgsB-761 transfected with WT and mutant XGalT-1 cDNAs were served to flow cytometric analysis. Two days after transfection, cells were trypsinized and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), then served for flow cytometric analysis using anti-heparan sulfate mAb HepSS-1 (Seikagaku Corp, Tokyo, Japan) and FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgM antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) on FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson). PgsB-761 cells transfected with 10 μg each of Myc-tagged XGalT-1 and mutants were lysed in 100 mm MES buffer (pH 6.0) containing 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and total cell lysate (50 μg) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immuno-blotted with mouse anti-Myc tag antibody and biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG. The antibody binding was revealed with ABC-PO (Vector) and HRP-1000 (Konica, Tokyo) according to the manufacturer's instruction. L cells (10-cm dish) were transfected with pCDSA-XGalT-1 (4 μg) by the DEAE-dextran method, and soluble forms of XGalT-1 were obtained as described previously (9Yamashiro S. Haraguchi M. Furukawa K.

The galactosyltransferase activity was determined according to Lugemwa et al. (10Lugemwa F.N. Sarkar A.K. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19159-19165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) with modification. The assay mixture contained 2 μl of Me2SO, 15 mm MnCl2, 50 mm KCl, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm MES buffer (pH 6.0), 0.6 mm UDP-Gal, 5,000 dpm/μl UDP-[14C]Gal (NEN Life Science Products), the enzyme solution, and p-nitrophenyl-β-d-xylopyranoside (2 mm) in total volume of 50 μl. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the reaction mixture was applied onto a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters), and the product was eluted with 5 ml of methanol. The radioactivity in the eluates was measured in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman). To analyze the subcellular localization of WT and mutated XGalT-1 enzymes, constructs for Myc tag enzyme expression were transiently transfected into pgsB-761 cells. Cells transfected with WT or mutant cDNAs were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 5 min, then permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. They were immunostained with mouse anti-Myc tag antibody and FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, then observed under MRC-1024 confocal imaging system (Bio-Rad). The entire coding region of XGalT-1 was amplified by reverse transcription PCR and sequenced. Just two changes of G and T to A and C at 186 and 206, respectively, were detected (Fig.1). To perform pedigree analysis, we determined the genomic DNA sequences encompassing the A186D and L206P mutations. Consequently, comparison of the genomic and cDNA sequences indicated that two mutations are present in the same exon (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 1, the unaffected parents and two siblings were heterozygous for either one of the two different mutations and normal, while the patient had both of two different mutant genes.Figure 2Location of the A186D and L206P mutations among the β1,4-galactosyltransferase family.

XGalT-1-deficient mutant CHO line pgsB-761 (8Esko J.D. Weinke J.L. Taylor W.H. Ekborg G. Rodén L. Anantharamaiah G. Gawish A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12189-12195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was transfected with WT, A186D and L206P cDNAs to examine the restoration of the expression of proteoglycans. A186D could restore fairly well and similarly to WT, while L206P could not at all (Fig.3 A). The enzyme activities in the total cell lysate of these transfectant cells were examined, resulting in the following patterns of activities: A186D showed ∼50% activity of WT, and L206P was almost null (Fig. 3 B,left), despite the expression levels of those products being almost equivalent (Fig. 3 C). Furthermore, soluble enzymes fused to protein A were expressed in L cells and were concentrated 100-fold and served for enzyme assay. Again, A186D showed low activity and L206P showed no activity (Fig.3 B, right). Intracellular localization of the mutant enzymes derived from the defined mutant cDNAs was analyzed using Myc-tagged constructs. WT and A186D enzymes showed a similar Golgi pattern. In contrast, L206P was detected in the cytoplasm with a diffuse pattern (Fig. 4). Although the disruption of Golgi targeting of L206P enzyme is an interesting finding, it seems not direct mechanisms for the functional defects as a galactosyltransferase, because the soluble L206P enzyme also completely lost the enzyme activity. As shown in Fig. 2, the mutated A186D and L206P lie in the conserved region of the catalytic domain of XGalT-1 protein. In particular, L206 was strictly conserved in all mammalian β1,4-galactosyltransferases cloned to date and C. elegans sqv-3 (6Herman T. Horvitz H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 974-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The function of Leu206 is unknown, but it may be involved in an essential step of the enzyme action. Moreover, replacement by proline, which has been shown to disrupt α-helices, would probably result in a significant conformational change, loss of activity, and a change in intracellular trafficking. Thus, this study has shown that mutations in XGalT-1 gene, which catalyzes the second glycosyl transfer step in the biosynthesis of GAGs, is the primary genetic defect in the progeroid variant of E-D syndrome and that it is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner based on identification of the gene mutations and characterization of the gene products. The incidence of the progeroid variant of E-D syndrome is too low to sufficiently analyze various types of mutations in XGalT-1 gene. However, results reported here clearly indicate the importance of the intact synthesis of GAGs on proteoglycans in the development of the wide variety of tissues. In particular, GAGs seem to be involved in the process of senescence, and the availability of XGalT-1 gene might provide a useful probe to substantially elucidate the molecular mechanisms.

Metallothionein III, Biological Roles and Medical Implications. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1993: 315-328Google Scholar).The functions of metallothionein are still not fully understood. It appears to play a fundamental role in the metabolism of copper and zinc ions under various physiological conditions (11Richards M.P. J. Nutr. 1989; 119: 1062-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 12Karin M. Cell. 1985; 41: 9-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), including its ability to donate metal ions to apo-Zn2+ enzymes (13Li T.Y. Kraker A.J. Shaw III, C.F. Petering D.H.

Biometals. 1996; 9: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), Au+ (16Saito S. Kurasaki M. Res. Commun. Mol. Pathol. Pharmacol. 1996; 93: 101-107PubMed Google Scholar, 17Shaw III, C.F.

Biochem. 1986; 55: 913-951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Metallothionein also appears to play a role in radical scavenging, stress response, and the pharmacology of metallodrugs and alkylating agents (12Karin M.

The seven metal ions are present in clusters of four and three metals bound to bridging and terminal cysteine thiolate ligands, with metal-to-thiolate ratios of M4S11 and M3S9 for the α- and β-domains, respectively (23Robbins A.H. McRee D.E. Williamson M. Collett S.A. Xuong N.H. Furey W.F. Wang B.C. Stout C.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 1269-1293PubMed Google Scholar). When both Zn2+ and Cd2+ are present, Cd2+ binds preferentially to the α-domain, whereas Zn2+ is found preferentially in the β-domain (23Robbins A.H. McRee D.E. Williamson M. Collett S.A. Xuong N.H.

Collett S.A. Xuong N.H. Furey W.F. Wang B.C. Stout C.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 1269-1293PubMed Google Scholar). The α-domain binds Cd2+ ions cooperatively (29Boulanger Y. Armitage I.M. Milklossy K.A. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13717-13719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All 20-cysteine residues participate in metal binding, and each of the seven Zn2+ or Cd2+ ions is tetrahedrally coordinated to four cysteine thiolate sulfur atoms (30Vašák M. Kägi J.H.R. Sigel H. Metal Ions in Biological Systems. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1983: 213-273Google Scholar, 31Vašák M. Kägi J.H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6709-6713Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).Bismuth is known to induce the synthesis of renal metallothionein (32Disilvestro R.A. Liu J. Klaassen C.D. Res. Commun. Mol. Pathol. Pharmacol. 1996; 93: 163-170PubMed Google Scholar), and it has been shown that pretreatment with bismuth complexes can prevent the toxic side effects of the anti-cancer drug cisplatin without compromising its anti-tumor activity (33Naganuma A. Satoh M. Imura N. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 983-987PubMed Google Scholar, 34Satoh M. Naganuma A. Imura N. Toxicology. 1988; 53: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 35Boogaard P.J.

Pharmacol. 1997; 40: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The protection probably involves platinum binding to Bi-induced metallothionein. However, there are few chemical studies of the reaction of Bi3+ with metallothionein (37Bernhard W. Good M. Vašák M. Kägi J.H.R. Inorg. Chim. Acta. 1983; 79: 154-155Crossref Google Scholar, 38Nielson K.B. Atkin C.L. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5342-5350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such interactions could also play a crucial role in the pharmacology of widely used bismuth anti-ulcer drugs including colloidal bismuth subcitrate (De-Nol®) and ranitidine bismuth citrate (Pylorid® and Tritec®) (39Baxter G.F. Pharm. J. 1989; 243: 805-810Google Scholar, 40Baxter G.F. Chem. Brit. 1992; 28: 445-448Google Scholar, 41Sun H. Li H. Sadler P.J. Chem. Ber./Recueil. 1997; 130: 669-681Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Here we report investigations of reactions of EDTA and citrate complexes of Bi3+ with metallothionein studied by UV, NMR, and x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS).DISCUSSIONMetallothionein appears to play an important role in human health and disease as well as in the mechanism of action of therapeutic agents. Its synthesis is induced in biological systems by a variety of metal ions including Zn2+, Cd2+, Cu+, and Bi3+, and this induction may provide protection from toxicity by allowing sequestration of the metal (2Nordberg M. Kojima Y. Kägi J.H.R. Nordberg M. Metallothionein. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1979: 41-116Google Scholar). Metallothionein may also play a role in cellular resistance to Pt anti-cancer drugs (18Pattanaik A. Bachowski G. Laib J. Lemkuil D. Shaw III, C.F. Petering D.H. Hitchcock A. Saryan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16121-16128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lemkuil D.C. Nettesheim D. Shaw III, C.F. Petering D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24792-24797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Administration of bismuth can induce the synthesis of metallothionein in kidney but not in tumor tissue. This reduces the renal toxicity of cisplatin without compromising its chemotherapeutic activity (33Naganuma A. Satoh M. Imura N. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 983-987PubMed Google Scholar, 36Satoh M. Aoki Y. Tohyama C. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1997; 40: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Therefore it has been suggested that bismuth compounds are ideal for clinical application as adjuncts in chemotherapy with cisplatin. Bismuth compounds have been used in medicine for centuries, mainly for the treatment of peptic ulcers and gastric disorders. Therefore, MT may play an important role in the pharmacological activity of bismuth anti-ulcer drugs.Metal ions have been reported to bind to MT with a variety of stoichoimetries, ranging from 7, 10, to 12 and even up to 20 metal ions per protein molecule and with different geometries (from tetrahedral, square-planar, to linear). These include monovalent metal ions such as Au+ (16Saito S. Kurasaki M. Res. Commun. Mol. Pathol. Pharmacol. 1996; 93: 101-107PubMed Google Scholar) and Cu+ (54Anthony P. Fowle D.A. Stillman M.J. J. Chem. Soc. Dalton Trans. 1997; : 977-984Google Scholar, 55Rupp H. Weser U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 533: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), divalent metal ions such as Zn2+, Cd2+, Co2+, and Hg2+, trivalent metal ions such as In3+ and Sb3+ (38Nielson K.B. Atkin C.L. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5342-5350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and TcO3+ (56Morelock M.M. Cormier T.A. Tolman G.L. Inorg.

In the present studies we determined the stoichiometry of Bi3+ binding to MT as 7:1 using both UV titration and ICP-AES to measure the metal and sulfur contents. This result is in agreement with previous brief reports (37Bernhard W. Good M. Vašák M. Kägi J.H.R. Inorg. Chim. Acta. 1983; 79: 154-155Crossref Google Scholar, 38Nielson K.B. Atkin C.L. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5342-5350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on bismuth metallothionein. X-ray and NMR studies of ZnxCd7-xMTs have shown that the metals are distributed in two clusters as M4S11 (α) and M3S9 (β) with the metals coordinated tetrahedrally (30Vašák M. Kägi J.H.R. Sigel H. Metal Ions in Biological Systems. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1983: 213-273Google Scholar). Previously reported structural data are summarized in Table III. Surprisingly, our EXAFS data suggest that Bi3+ (ionic radius 1.03 Å) coordinates strongly to only three cysteine sulfurs with an average Bi–S bond length of 2.55 Å. This bond length is almost identical to that found in x-ray structures of low M r Bi(III) thiolate complexes (Bi–S 2.5 to 2.6 Å) (49Farrugia L.J. Lawlor F.J. Norman N.C. J. Chem. Soc. Dalton Trans. 1995; : 1163-1171Crossref Google Scholar, 58Atwood D.A. Cowley A.H. Hernandez R.D. Jones R.A. Rand L.L. Bott S.G. Atwood J.L. Inorg. Chem. 1993; 32: 2972-2974Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The fit for the EXAFS data for Bi7MT suggests the presence of additional sulfur scattering at ∼3.1 Å. To retain the metal clusters a much distorted tetrahedral geometry is required with three Bi–S bond distances of 2.55 Å and a longer Bi–S contact of ca. 3.1 Å. Although the 3.1 Å distance is well defined, the associated coordination number is not, and the required coordination number for distorted tetrahedral geometry is well within the error range. In the crystal structure of [Bi(SC6F5)3], Bi3+coordinates to three sulfurs with Bi–S bond lengths of 2.53–2.58 Å, and an additional long Bi–S bond of 3.32 Å (49Farrugia L.J. Lawlor F.J. Norman N.C. J. Chem. Soc. Dalton Trans. 1995; : 1163-1171Crossref Google Scholar). Molecular modeling of Hg7MT (59Fowle D.A. Stillman M.J. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1997; 14: 393-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) suggests that the geometry of Hg2+ is distorted away from tetrahedral due to extensive interactions with solvent water. The recent EXAFS studies on Hg7MT have shown that the nearest coordination number for Hg2+ is 2, with Hg–S bond lengths of 2.33 Å and two less well defined long bonds of ∼3.4 Å (60Jiang D.T. Heald S.M. Sham T.K. Stillman M.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 11004-11013Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It has been thought that the binding site cage of MT is too small to accommodate the volume of tetrahedral HgS4 units. However, Cd2+, which has a similar ionic radius (0.92 Å) and the same charge, coordinates tetrahedrally to sulfurs of Cys residues. The coordination geometry is therefore largely dependent on the metal ion, e.g.Ag+, digonal (CN, 2); Cu+, trigonal (CN, 3) (61Gui Z. Green A.R. Kasrai M. Bancroft G.M. Stillman M.J. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 35: 6520-6529Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar); and TcO3+, square pyramidal (CN, 5) (57Jones W.B. Elgren T.E. Morelock M.M. Elder R.C. Wilcox D.E. Inorg.

Alkoxide donors from Ser or Thr are attractive to consider because Bi–OR (alkoxide) bonds are known to be short and strong in several bismuth citrate adducts (41Sun H. Li H. Sadler P.J. Chem. Ber./Recueil. 1997; 130: 669-681Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). No Ser or Thr side chains are particularly close to the metal clusters in zinc and cadmium metallothioneins with known structures, although Ser32 and Ser35 are less than 7 Å away from the M4S11 cluster in the α domain, and Ser2, Ser18, and Ser28 are less than 7 Å from the M3S9 cluster in the β domain (23Robbins A.H. McRee D.E. Williamson M. Collett S.A. Xuong N.H. Furey W.F. Wang B.C. Stout C.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 1269-1293PubMed Google Scholar, 24Arseniev A. Schultze P. Wörgötter E. Braun W. Wagner G.

J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 251-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Alkoxide coordination to Bi3+ often gives rise to lone-pair effects and distorted coordination spheres for Bi3+ (41Sun H. Li H. Sadler P.J. Chem. Ber./Recueil. 1997; 130: 669-681Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). At biological pH, ZnxCdyMT(II) (x + y= 7) is negatively charged (−2), whereas Bi7MT(II) would have an overall positive charge (+5). Thus the additional oxygen ligands may serve to neutralize the excess charge.Previously we have shown (62Sadler P.J. Sun H. Li H. Chem. Eur. J. 1996; 2: 701-708Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar) that Bi3+ binds to the Cys residue of glutathione and induces large low field shifts of the1H NMR resonances of β CH2 protons (∼1.4 ppm). Free and bismuth-bound glutathione exchange at an intermediate rate on the NMR time scale at biological pH (∼1500 s−1). The NMR data were also consistent with sulfur-only binding, in agreement with the EXAFS data. The overall broadening of the1H NMR spectrum of Bi7MT and the disappearance of the two-dimensional TOCSY cross-peaks for β CH2 of Cys residues (Fig. 6) suggest a facile exchange of Bi3+ between different sites, even though binding is thermodynamically very strong. Other cross-peaks, notably those for Lys and Thr, residues that are wide spread throughout the protein, remain unchanged in comparison with Zn7MT, indicating that Bi7MT probably has a folded conformation although the overall three-dimensional structure may be different. Our gel filtration chromatography studies show that Bi7MT migrates in a similar manner to Zn7MT, suggesting that their molecular masses and shapes are similar,i.e. Bi3+ has not induced MT polymerization. The disappearance of the β CH31H NMR resonance of Ala23 (1.16 ppm) suggests that the structure of Bi7MT in this region may be more flexible, and involved in dynamic exchange between different conformations. Previous molecular modeling studies have shown that Cys26 in the β domain is more solvent accessible and can be displaced from Zn2+binding by the thiolate sulfur of glutathione (63Brouwer M. Brouwer T.H. Cashon R.E. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).Bi–S bonds in MT(II) appear to be remarkably stable even down to pH values near 1.0, in contrast to Zn2+ and Cd2+, which are 50% dissociated at pH 4.6 and 3.05, respectively (55Rupp H. Weser U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 533: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), but similar in strength to Cu+-MT (pH 12 0.44) (55Rupp H. Weser U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 533: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The affinity of Bi3+ for MT(II) is therefore higher than that of Zn2+ and Cd2+.The kinetics of reactions between bismuth complexes and MT(II) were elucidated in two ways: by observing the absorbance changes at 350 nm due to the formation of Bi–S bonds and the appearance of new1H NMR peaks resulting from the formation of either zinc or cadmium EDTA complexes after displacement of EDTA from Bi3+. 1H NMR also allowed the kinetics of Zn2+ and Cd2+ displacement by Bi3+to be monitored separately. Biphasic processes were observed for both [Bi(cit)]− and [Bi(EDTA)]−. In the fast step, the displacement of Zn2+ from Zn7MT by [Bi(cit)]− occurred four times faster than that by [Bi(EDTA)]−, while the second step was very similar for both of these bismuth complexes. This is probably due to differences in structure:bismuth citrate contains dimeric units [Bi2(cit)2]2− (48Barrie P.J. Djuran M.I. Mazid M.A. McPartlin M. Sadler P.J. Scowen I.J. Sun H. J. Chem. Soc. Dalton Trans. 1996; : 2417-2422Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar) in which the Bi3+ ion has apparent vacant coordination sites (perhaps occupied by the 6 s2 lone pair of electrons) and therefore may be able to attack Cys sulfur of MT more readily than [Bi(EDTA)]− in which the EDTA ligand is wrapped around Bi3+ (42Summers S.P. Abboud K.A. Farrah S.R. Palenik G.J. Inorg. Chem. 1994; 33: 88-92Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). By comparing the kinetics of reaction of [Bi(EDTA)]− with Zn7MT and with Zn2Cd5MT (with Zn2+ in the β-domain), we have shown that metal ions in β-domain of the MT can be replaced preferentially, and cooperatively and rapidly (within minutes) by Bi3+, and there is little difference between the reactivity of Zn3 and Zn2Cd β-domains. The first step maybe involve displacement of metal ions in the β-domain by Bi3+ and one metal ion in the α domain, as judged from NMR data, and the second step may involve displacement of the other metal ions in the α-domain. There have been several previous studies of metal and ligand displacement from Zn7MT and Cd7MT (18Pattanaik A. Bachowski G. Laib J. Lemkuil D. Shaw III, C.F. Petering D.H. Hitchcock A. Saryan L. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 24792-24797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and multiphase processes have always been observed. Biphasic kinetics have usually been explained on the basis of formation and breakdown of intermediates (18Pattanaik A. Bachowski G. Laib J. Lemkuil D. Shaw III, C.F. Petering D.H. Hitchcock A. Saryan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16121-16128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lemkuil D.C. Nettesheim D. Shaw III, C.F. Petering D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24792-24797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However only a single kinetic step for metal displacement has been observed for reaction of EDTA with Cd2+ in the β-domain of Cd7MT, and also one Cd2+ in the α domain can be extracted by EDTA more readily than the other Cd2+ ions (64Gan T. Munoz A. Shaw III, C.F. Petering D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5339-5345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Our NMR data indicated the rapid removal of a small amount of Ca2+ from the protein (0.5 Ca2+ per MTII) during reaction with [Bi(EDTA)]−. We assume that this is surface bound Ca2+ which has little effect on the cluster structures. Its presence has been observed previously (50Higham D.P. Nicholson J.K. Overnell J. Sadler P.J. Environ. Health Perspect. 1986; 65: 157-165PubMed Google Scholar).The high stability of bismuth metallothionein suggests that it could play a significant role in the mechanism of action of bismuth-based drugs both in bacteria and in man. It may be an important species for bismuth transport from the liver to the kidney and be involved in bismuth storage in the kidney. In addition, the neurotoxicity of bismuth drugs (encephalopathy) could be related to the binding of Bi3+ to the brain-specific metallothionein(III), since the distribution of Bi3+ in mouse brain is very similar to that of Cu+ and Ag+ (27Ross J.F. Switzer R.C. Poston M.R. Lawhorn G.T. Brain Res. 1996; 725: 137-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).CONCLUSIONSWe have established that Bi3+ originating from bismuth citrate anti-ulcer compounds and from [Bi(EDTA)]− binds very strongly to MT(II) and readily displaces Zn2+ and Cd2+. Despite its higher charge, Bi3+ also forms a 7:1 complex (Bi7-MT), the same stoichiometry for binding as zinc and cadmium. EXAFS data show that on average each Bi3+ is coordinated strongly to only 3 cysteine sulfurs (at 2.55 Å) in contrast to Zn2+ and Cd2+, which have clusters based on M(Cys)4 centers. The presence of less well defined longer Bi–S contacts of 3.1 Å for some Bi3+ ions suggests that Bi7-MT does contain clusters, although Bi-Bi contacts were not detectable. For at least some of the Bi3+ ions in Bi7-MT, there is additional oxygen coordination as short Bi–O bonds of 2.2 Å. These could arise from bismuth-alkoxide linkages to Ser or Thr side chains or perhaps from oxide coordination. Remarkably, Bi3+ is still bound to MT, even at low pH values (e.g. pH 1), again in contrast to Zn2+ and Cd2+. Displacement of Zn2+ and Cd2+ from the β-domain (M3S9) by Bi3+ was much faster than from the α-domain. These differences between the structure and reactivity of bismuth metallothionein compared with zinc metallothionein are likely to have implications for its biological properties. Since bismuth citrate complexes are widely used as anti-ulcer drugs, and pretreatment with bismuth compounds can protect against some of the toxic side effects of the anti-cancer drug cisplatin, further studies of bismuth metallothionein are warranted. Metallothionein (MT)1 is an intriguing, low molecular mass (∼7 kDa), cysteine- and metal-rich protein. It was first isolated from equine renal cortex 40 years ago (1Margoshes M. Vallee B.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1957; 79: 4813-4814Crossref Scopus (1083) Google Scholar) and contains 61 amino acids, of which 20 are cysteine residues. Since then, similar proteins have been isolated from the kidney, liver, and intestines of a variety of animal species (2Nordberg M. Kojima Y. Kägi J.H.R. Nordberg M. Metallothionein.

Parathyroid hormone (through activation of protein kinase A) has also been shown to stimulate ubiquitin/proteasome activity in osteoblasts. Since the osteoblast-specific transcription factor Osf2/Cbfa1 is important for differentiation of osteoblastic cells, we examined the roles of the cAMP and ubiquitin/proteasome pathways in regulation of Cbfa1. In the osteoblastic cell line, MC3T3-E1, continuous treatment with cAMP elevating agents inhibited both osteoblastic differentiation based on alkaline phosphatase assay and DNA binding ability of Cbfa1 based on a gel retardation assay. Cbfa1 inhibition was paralleled by an inhibitory effect of forskolin on Cbfa1-regulated genes. Northern and Western blot analyses suggested that the inhibition of Cbfa1 by forskolin was mainly at the protein level. Pretreatment with proteasome inhibitors prior to forskolin treatment reversed the effect of forskolin. Furthermore, addition of proteasome inhibitors to forskolin-pretreated samples resulted in recovery of Cbfa1 protein levels and accumulation of polyubiquitinated forms of Cbfa1, indicating a role for the proteasome pathway in the degradation of Cbfa1. These results suggest that suppression of osteoblastic function by the cAMP pathway is through proteolytic degradation of Cbfa1 involving a ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent mechanism.

Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 1384-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Although sequences conferring cAMP responsiveness have been found in the promoters of osteocalcin (8Towler D. Rodan G. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1089-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and bone sialoprotein (16Yang R. Gerstenfeld L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29839-29846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), it remains largely unknown which transcription factors mediate the cAMP response in these and other osteoblastic differentiation gene promoters. The 26 S proteasome, a multicatalytic protease complex, is a site of regulatory degradation for most proteins (17Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar, 18Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). It is an ATP-dependent extralysosomal protease that is necessary for viability and essential for regulation of proliferation and differentiation of eukaryotic cells (18Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). It is ubiquitously distributed throughout the cell, in the nucleus, cytosol, endoplasmic reticulum, and even associated with the cytoskeleton (18Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). It catalyzes degradation of rate-limiting enzymes (e.g. ornithine decarboxylase), transcriptional regulators (e.g. IκB), cell-cycle proteins (e.g. cyclins), abnormal proteins, and turnover of membrane proteins (18Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). Substrate proteins are tagged with multiple copies of ubiquitin for recognition by the proteasome complex. In osteoblasts, PTH, through the cAMP pathway, has been shown to stimulate 26 S proteasomes (19Murray E. Bentley G. Grisanti M. Murray S. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 460-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which account for 90% of the neutral regulatory proteolysis in eukaryotic cells (20Rivett A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). In yeast, the involvement of proteasomes in protein turnover has been studied using various mutants of the proteasome complex. In mammalian cells, which lack such mutants, its role has been studied mainly using peptide inhibitors (17Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar, 18Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). Although many aspects of the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway have been elucidated, the endogenous substrates it regulates in osteoblastic cells remain largely unknown. Since it has been shown that cAMP regulates osteoblastic differentiation, and that Cbfa1 is essential for osteoblastic differentiation, we hypothesized that cAMP regulation of osteoblastic differentiation occurs through Cbfa1 activity. In addition, since cAMP also stimulates ubiquitin/proteasome activity in osteoblasts, we examined the role of the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway in regulation of Cbfa1 by cAMP. In the present study, we tested the effect of cAMP elevating agents on Cbfa1 expression and function in MC3T3-E1, a non-transformed osteoblastic cell line established from newborn mouse calvaria which has a capacity to undergo osteoblastic differentiation and mineralization in vitro. Results showed that continuous treatment of cAMP agonists inhibited Cbfa1 by proteolytic degradation involving the ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent mechanism. Forskolin, dibutyryl cAMP, dibutyryl cGMP, proteasome inhibitor I (PSI), MG-132 (carbobenzoxy-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-leucinal), and MG-101 (N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO) were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA).

Oligonucleotides for primers and probes were custom-ordered from Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). MC3T3-E1, a mouse preosteoblast cell line was obtained from Riken Cell Bank (Japan). MC3T3-E1 cells were grown in α-minimal essential medium (Irvine Scientific) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, sodium pyruvate (1 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 units/ml). One day after plating, subconfluent cells were treated with vehicle alone (Me2SO) or 25 μm forskolin in differentiation media (α-minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 5 mm β-glycerol phosphate, and 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid). The medium was changed every 3–4 days, and fresh agents (e.g. forskolin) were added, as applicable, at that time. The oligonucleotide sequences used as probes or as competitors are as follows: mouse OSE2 wild-type 5′-AGCTGCAATCACCAACCACAGCA-3′ (5Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar); mouse OSE2 mut-4 5′-AGCTGCAATCACCAGACACAGCA-3′ (5Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were annealed and gel purified on 20% native polyacrylamide gels. Purified double-stranded probes were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (23Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). 3–5 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated with binding buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (5Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar) for 15 min, after which labeled probe was added and incubated for additional 15–20 min. The samples were subjected to electrophoresis at room temperature on a chilled 5% polyacrylamide gel in Mini-PROTEAN II apparatus (Bio-Rad) in 0.5% TBE at 400 V for 14 min. For experiments using anti-Cbfa1 antibody, the antibody was added to the reaction mixture for 30 min prior to addition of labeled probe. The samples were subjected to electrophoresis at room temperature on 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.25% TBE at 160 V for 40 min. In competition experiments, competitor oligos were incubated with nuclear extracts during the first 15 min prior to addition of the labeled probe. Autoradiographs were scanned with AGFA ARCUS II scanner and semi-quantitated with NIH Image software, version 1.49, a public domain program. Cells were seeded in 24-well plates and treated at subconfluence with vehicle alone (Me2SO) or forskolin for the indicated number of days and alkaline phosphatase activity was assayed as described previously (24Parhami F. Morrow A.D. Balucan J. Leitinger N. Watson A.D. Tintut Y. Berliner J.A. Demer L.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). The alkaline phosphatase activity was normalized to total protein concentration determined using the Bradford (Bio-Rad) assay. The data were from a representative of two experiments, and shown as the mean ± S.D. of quadruplicate wells. Ca45 incorporation and von Kossa staining to detect mineralization were performed as described previously (24Parhami F. Morrow A.D. Balucan J. Leitinger N. Watson A.D. Tintut Y. Berliner J.A. Demer L.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). The data for 45Ca incorporation were from a representative of two experiments and shown as the mean ± S.D. of six wells. Cells, grown in duplicate 60-mm dishes, were treated at subconfluence with vehicle alone or 25 μm forskolin for the indicated period, and total RNA was isolated using an RNA isolation kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Total RNA (10 μg) from duplicate samples was run on 1% agarose/formaldehyde gels and Northern analyses for osteopontin, 28 S rRNA were performed as described previously (25Tintut Y. Parhami F. Boström K. Jackson S.M. Demer L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7547-7553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The total RNA (3 μg) isolated as described above was reversed-transcribed and amplified by PCR as described previously (25Tintut Y. Parhami F. Boström K. Jackson S.M. Demer L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7547-7553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). For semiquantitative RT-PCR, the linear range was first established and amplification cycles were chosen to be within this range. Primers used for PCR amplification are as follows: 1) murine BSP 5′-CTCGGGTGTAACAGCTAGCTAC-3′ and 5′-CGTTCAGAAGGACAGCTGTCTG-3′; 2) murine ALP 5′-CTTGCTGGTGGAAGGAGGCAGG-3′ and 5′-CACGTCTTCTCCACCGTGGGTC-3′; 3) murine OC 5′-CTCTGTCTCTCTGACCTCACAG-3′ and 5′-GGAGCTGCTGTGACATCCATAC-3′; 4) murine Cbfa1 (5Ducy P.

Nuclear extracts (5 μg) were run on 12% Tris glycine gel (Novex, San Diego, CA) and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane overnight at 4 °C. The blots were probed with anti-Cbfa1 antibody at 1:500 dilution for 2 h at room temperature. The cbfa1 protein was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence according to manufacturer's recommendations (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 15 μg of nuclear extracts were diluted to 300 μl in a dilution buffer (10 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.025% sodium azide, 0.1% bovine serum albumin), and immunoprecipitated with 4–6 μl of anti-Cbfa1 antibody for 4–5 h at 4 °C. After which time, 50 μl of Protein A-Sepharose (CL-4B) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The protein A-antibody-antigen complexes were pelleted and washed twice with the dilution buffer, once with buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.025% sodium azide), and once with buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8). The immunoprecipitated proteins were boiled for 5 min in a sample buffer and separated on a 12% Tris glycine gel. The ubiquitinated Cbfa1 was probed with mouse monoclonal anti-ubiquitin antibody at 1:200 dilution for 2 h at room temperature, and visualized by ECL. The data were from a representative of two separate experiments. To examine the effect of forskolin on osteoblastic differentiation and mineralization, MC3T3-E1 cells were treated continuously with forskolin and alkaline phosphatase activity, as well as matrix mineralization, were measured over a period of 3, 7, 14, and 21 days. The results showed that alkaline phosphatase activity increased as cells progressed through differentiation in control cells, however, this increase was blocked by forskolin treatment (Fig.1 A). Matrix mineralization, as measured by incorporation of 45Ca, was also inhibited by forskolin (Fig. 1B). Von Kossa cytochemical stain also showed that forskolin treatment completely inhibited mineralization (data not shown). Since Cbfa1 has been shown to be an important regulator of osteoblastic differentiation, we examined the effect of the cAMP pathway on Cbfa1 DNA binding via gel retardation assay. Nuclear extracts of MC3T3-E1 cells, treated with 25 μm forskolin, 1 mm dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP), or 0.5 μm PTH, were incubated with probe containing the Cbfa1 DNA-binding site (5Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). Results showed that forskolin, Bt2-cAMP, and PTH reduced Cbfa1 DNA binding (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, treatment of cells with 1 mm dibutyryl cGMP (Bt2-cGMP) or 500 ng/ml epidermal growth factor produced little or no effect (Fig. 2 A). The specificity of Cbfa1 binding to DNA probe was examined using anti-Cbfa1 antibody (22Thirunavukkarasu K. Mahajan M. McLarren K.W. Stifani S. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4197-4208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of anti-Cbfa1 antibody resulted in a supershifted band and a decrease in the faster migrating complex (lanes 1–2 versus lanes 3–4, 1 μl of antibody and 5–6, 3 μl of antibody; Fig. 2 B). The supershifted band was apparently specific to anti-Cbfa1 since an irrelevant antibody (anti-NFκB antibody) had no effect (lanes 7–8, Fig. 2 B). Cbfa1 DNA binding was also competed by excess unlabeled wild-type probe but not by probe containing mutation in the Cbfa1-binding site (5Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar) (data not shown). To examine whether forskolin induced changes in Cbfa1 DNA binding correlated with changes in expression of downstream Cbfa1-regulated genes, we determined the effect of forskolin on expression of alkaline phosphatase, bone sialoprotein, osteopontin, and osteocalcin genes. Total RNA was isolated from control and forskolin-treated samples; osteopontin expression was determined by Northern analysis; alkaline phosphatase, bone sialoprotein, and osteocalcin expression were determined by RT-PCR. RNA isolated from 7-day cultured cells was used for analyses of alkaline phosphatase, bone sialoprotein, and osteopontin expression, whereas RNA isolated from 21-day cultured cells was used for analysis of osteocalcin expression. Results showed that forskolin also inhibited the expression of alkaline phosphatase, bone sialoprotein, osteopontin, and osteocalcin genes (Fig. 2 C). To determine whether the inhibition of Cbfa1 DNA binding by forskolin was due to reduced Cbfa1 protein level, nuclear extracts were prepared from cells treated with forskolin for 7 or 14 days and Cbfa1 protein level was determined by Western blot analysis. Results showed that the level of Cbfa1 in control samples, detected as two immunoreactive species of ∼60- and 65-kDa sizes (6Banerjee C. McCabe L.R. Choi J.Y. Hiebert S.W. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 66: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), was reduced in both time points of forskolin-treated samples (Fig. 3 A). To determine the earliest time required for this effect, Western analysis was repeated with nuclear extracts from cells treated with forskolin for 2–48 h. Results showed that in control samples, Cbfa1 levels increased over this time (compare lanes 1, 3, 5, and7; Fig. 3 A), whereas the Cbfa1 level was reduced in samples treated with forskolin for 48 h (lanes 7 versus 8; Fig. 3 A). However, the reduction in Cbfa1 level was not observed prior to 32-h treatment with forskolin (Fig. 3 A), indicating that degradation requires a lag time. We next examined the inhibition of Cbfa1 by forskolin at the mRNA level. Cells were treated with forskolin for the indicated time, total RNA was isolated, and Cbfa1 transcript level was analyzed by Northern analysis using Cbfa1-specific probe (5Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). Results showed only minor variations in Cbfa1 expression levels with forskolin treatment, except in the samples treated for 7 days, in which the transcript level of Cbfa1 was moderately reduced (Fig.3 B). Nevertheless, these changes do not appear to account for the more dramatic change in Cbfa1 protein level. To determine whether the reduction in Cbfa1 protein level in the nucleus was due to its translocation to the cytoplasm, Western analysis was performed using both cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts. Results showed no increase in cytoplasmic Cbfa1 levels with forskolin treatment (data not shown). Since it has been previously shown that PKA activation in osteoblastic cells stimulates ubiquitination of substrate proteins and proteolytic activity of proteasomes (19Murray E. Bentley G. Grisanti M. Murray S. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 460-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), a predominant mechanism of regulatory proteolysis (20Rivett A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), we examined the involvement of the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway in the forskolin-induced reduction of Cbfa1 protein level. Proteasome inhibitors (MG-101, MG-132, or PSI) were added to MC3T3-E1 cells, which had been pretreated with forskolin for 3 days. Nuclear extracts, prepared 6 h after addition of inhibitors, were probed with anti-Cbfa1 antibody. Results showed that, in the absence of inhibitors, forskolin reduced the Cbfa1 level as shown above (lane 2 versus 1; Fig.4 A). However, in the presence of proteasome inhibitors, Cbfa1 was retained at 42–65% of the control level (Fig. 4 A), indicating that proteasome inhibitors prevented the forskolin-induced proteolysis of Cbfa1. Similar treatment with proteasome inhibitors for 2 h did not result in the recovery of Cbfa1 (data not shown). To examine whether inhibition of proteasome prevents forskolin-induced degradation of Cbfa1, cells were pretreated with PSI for 2 h, followed by forskolin treatment for 2 days. Nuclear extracts were probed with anti-Cbfa1 antibody. Results showed that forskolin failed to reduce Cbfa1 levels in the samples pretreated with PSI (compare lanes 2 and 4; Fig. 4 B), suggesting a role of proteasomes in proteolytic degradation of Cbfa1 by cAMP. It has been shown that addition of proteasome inhibitors also results in accumulation of the ubiquitinated form of substrate proteins (19Murray E. Bentley G. Grisanti M. Murray S. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 460-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar,26Orford K. Crockett C. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Byers S.W. J. Biol.

Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1578-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Therefore to examine whether Cbfa1 is ubiquitinated in forskolin-treated cells prior to proteasomal degradation, we immunoprecipitated Cbfa1 from the samples that had been treated as inpanel A (pretreatment with forskolin for 3 days and subsequently treatment with proteasome inhibitors for 6 h). The immunoprecipitates were separated on a gel and probed with anti-ubiquitin antibody which is reactive to both ubiquitin and ubiquitinated substrate proteins. Results showed an accumulation of the polyubiquitinated Cbfa1 in forskolin-treated cells in the presence of proteasome inhibitors compared with the control samples (no forskolin and no inhibitor) or the samples treated only with forskolin (Fig.4 C). These results suggest that proteasome inhibition leads to accumulation of polyubiquitinated Cbfa1. These findings indicate that continuous long-term exposure of osteoblastic cells to cAMP elevating agents inhibits DNA binding of the osteoblast-specific transcription factor, Cbfa1, and that this inhibition is through proteolytic degradation involving ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent mechanism. The decreased Cbfa1 DNA binding correlated with inhibition of several downstream Cbfa1-regulated genes including alkaline phosphatase, bone sialoprotein, osteopontin, and osteocalcin (5Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar, 28Harada H. Tagashira S. Fujiwara M. Ogawa S. Katsumata T.

Forskolin also decreased von Kossa staining and radiolabeled calcium incorporation into the matrix, presumably due to inhibition of alkaline phosphatase and other extracellular matrix synthesis. Regulation of Cbfa1 has been reported at a variety of levels including transcriptional and post-transcriptional. Ducy et al. (5Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar) showed that 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibitsCbfa1 mRNA levels, whereas bone morphogenetic protein 4/7 increases the mRNA level of Cbfa1 (5Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar, 29Tsuji K. Ito Y. Noda M. Bone. 1998; 22: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In contrast, PTH regulates the collagenase-3 promoter through cooperative interaction of two transcription factors, AP-1 and Cbfa1, without directly affecting their individual binding affinities (30Selvamurugan N. Chou W.-Y. Pearman A.T. Pulumati M.R. Partridge N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10647-10657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Our results showed that forskolin regulated Cbfa1 more at the post-transcriptional level than transcriptional level. Similar regulation of Cbfa1 at the protein level has been reported with glucocorticoid treatment in primary osteoblast-enriched cultures (31Chang D.J. Ji C. Kim K.K. Casinghino S. McCarthy T.L. Centrella M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4892-4896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The induction of proteases has been reported in response to PTH stimulation in MC3T3-E1. Murray and colleagues (19Murray E. Bentley G. Grisanti M. Murray S. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 460-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 32Murray E.J. Grisanti M.S. Bentley G.V. Murray S.S. Metabol. Clin. Exp. 1997; 46: 1090-1094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) previously showed that PTH, through the cAMP pathway, stimulates both calpains (calcium activated papain-like proteases I and II) and 26 S proteasome activities in osteoblasts, and that membrane-permeable protease inhibitors have been shown to attenuate the effects of PTH. They also noted that the 26 S proteasomal pathway, which accounts for more than 90% of the regulatory proteolysis, is 100- to 1000-fold higher than calpain activities (19Murray E. Bentley G. Grisanti M. Murray S. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 460-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This proteolytic mechanism also appears to account for our observed decrease in Cbfa1 activity with forskolin treatment. The results showed that after 3 days of continuous forskolin treatment (4 days in culture), a 6-h incubation with proteasome inhibitors is sufficient to restore Cbfa1 to ∼50% of the control level. This recovery time may appear rapid relative to the time required for degradation. However this difference may be explained by 2 considerations. First, the data indicate that Cbfa1 levels increase over this time period in control cells, suggesting that baseline turnover may be different between onset of degradation (32–48 h)versus the time of treatment with proteasome inhibitors (96 h). Second, the data also suggest that a lag time (at least 32 h) is required prior to induction of proteasomal dependent Cbfa1 degradation induced by forskolin. A similar lag time for proteolytic degradation has been reported with the transcription factor YY1, another substrate of the proteasome pathway (33Walowitz J.L. Bradley M.E. Chen S. Lee T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6656-6661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for this lag time is de novo synthesis of one or more enzymes involved in the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway: in T lymphocytes, induction of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, hUBC9 mRNA, which targets the transcription factor ATF2 for ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, requires a 24–48-h lag time after stimulation (34Firestein R. Feuerstein N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5892-5902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, this lag time for onset of Cbfa1 degradation (presumably required for enzyme synthesis) together with the increasing control levels of Cbfa1 over time may account for this rapid recovery in the presence of proteasome inhibitors. Preceding degradation, there appears to be a small increase in Cbfa1 protein levels at 24–32 h in cells treated with forskolin. This transient increase may be due to a stimulatory effect of forskolin on Cbfa1 protein levels during the 32-h lag time prior to onset of degradation by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. This is in agreement with reports by other investigators that catabolic versusanabolic effects of PTH/cAMP on osteoblastic differentiation depend on exposure time (8Towler D. Rodan G. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1089-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 9Yohay D. Zhang J. Thrailkill K. Arthur J. Quarles L.D. J. Cell.

Invest. 1997; 99: 2961-2970Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Finally, our data indicate that Cbfa1 is a novel endogenous substrate for the proteasome in osteoblastic cells, in this case one that is induced by the cAMP pathway. These results provide new insight into the mechanistic basis of osteoblast inhibition by hormones such as PTH, through the cAMP pathway, namely proteasome-dependent degradation of Cbfa1, the master regulator of osteoblastic differentiation.

We have previously demonstrated that each V-ATPase complex contains three copies each of the A and B subunits, six copies of the 17-kDa subunits (c, c′), and single copies of the C, D, E, a, d, and c” subunits (10Arai H. Terres G. Pink S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8796-8802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The number of copies of subunits F, G, and H per complex has not been reliably determined. The V-ATPases are known to be structurally and evolutionarily related to the ATP synthases (or F-ATPases) of mitochondria, chloroplasts and bacteria (11Weber J. Senior A. Biochim. Biophys.

The structure of the peripheral F1 domain of the mitochondrial F-ATPase has been determined by x-ray crystallography and shown to consist of a hexamer of alternating α and β subunits surrounding a central cavity containing the highly α-helical γ subunit (18Abrahams J.P.

F1appears to be attached to the F0 domain via both a central stalk (believed to include both the γ and ε subunits) and a peripheral stalk (composed of the δ subunit and the soluble portions of subunit b) (20Wilkens S.

While the V-ATPase complex is thought to resemble the F-ATPases, electron micrographs have revealed significant differences (24Dschida W.J. Bowman B.J. J. Biol.

In the current study, we have employed covalent cross-linking and Western blot analysis to identify subunit contacts within the V-ATPase. In addition, we have reevaluated the effects of treatment of the enzyme with cystine or potassium iodide on dissociation of specific subunits from the complex. Finally, we have determined the stoichiometry of subunits F, G, and H by quantitative amino acid analysis. These studies have allowed us to construct a new model for the structure of the V-ATPases. Calf brains were obtained fresh from a local slaughterhouse. Disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG), 1-ethyl-3-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), andN-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (NHS) were from Pierce. SDS, nitrocellulose membranes (0.2-μm pore size), Tween 20, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG were from Bio-Rad. l-1-Tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, 4-(N-maleimido)benzophenone (MBP), and most common chemicals were obtained from Sigma. The chemiluminescence substrate for horseradish peroxidase was from KPL Laboratories and prestained SDS-PAGE marker proteins were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The bovine cDNAs encoding the full-length forms of subunits C, D, and E were cloned into the pET-21d(+) expression vector and expressed in BL-21 cells. Expression of the His-tagged proteins was induced by incubation in 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and disruption of cells was carried out using lysozyme and Triton X-100 as described previously (26Peng S.B.

The recombinant proteins were recovered from inclusion bodies by sedimentation and solubilized with 8m urea followed by dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline. The His-tagged proteins were then isolated by nickel-affinity chromatography and sent to Covance Inc. for production of polyclonal antibodies in rabbits. For subunits B, F, and H, the following synthetic peptides were prepared: subunit B, CPTSGPLAGSREQAL; subunit F, CPSEKHPYDAAKDSILRR; subunit H, CHKSEKFNRENPARLNEKN. The peptides were conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin via the cysteine residues at the amino termini and were also sent to Covance, Inc. for production of polyclonal antibodies in rabbits. Antibodies were isolated from rabbit antisera using protein A-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Clathrin-coated vesicles were prepared from calf brain as described previously (27Arai H. Berne M.

Vesicles were stripped of their clathrin coat using 0.5 m Tris (pH 7.0), 2 mm EDTA and the V-ATPase was solubilized with C12E9 and purified by glycerol density gradient centrifugation as described (27Arai H.

Stripped vesicles (1.0 mg of protein/ml) were treated first with 0.2 m KI for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by sedimentation for 1 h at 100,000 × g and resuspension in 0.36 m KI and 2.5 mm MgATP, incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, and sedimentation. The supernatant was dialyzed overnight versus two changes of 100 volumes of solubilization buffer (50 mm NaCl, 30 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 0.2 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol) to allow reassembly of the V1(-subunit C) subcomplex (referred to as the V1 subcomplex). The V1 subcomplex was then isolated by sedimentation for 16 h at 175,000 × g on 15–30% glycerol density gradients as described previously (28Puopolo K. Sczekan M. Magner R. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5171-5176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For DSG, the purified V-ATPase or V1 subcomplex were concentrated to approximately 50 μg of protein/ml using a Centricon-30 microconcentrator and incubated with 0.2 mm DSG for 30 min at 23 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 50 mm ammonium acetate (pH 8.0). For EDC, the purified V-ATPase or V1 subcomplex (50 μg of protein/ml) was incubated with 5 mm EDC together with 5 mm NHS for 20 min at 23 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8). For MBP, the reagent dissolved in dimethylformamide at 100 mm was added to the purified V-ATPase or V1 subcomplex at a final concentration of 1 mm, followed by incubation in the dark for 30 min at 23 °C. The unreacted MBP was quenched by addition of 10 mm dithiothreitol. The samples were dialyzed against two changes of 200 volumes of solubilization buffer for a total of 4 h, followed by irradiation with a long wavelength ultraviolet lamp for 20 min at 4 °C. Where indicated, the purified V-ATPase was concentrated to 50 μg of protein/ml and treated with 1 μg of trypsin/ml for 2 h at 23 °C. Proteolysis was stopped by addition of 5-fold (w/w) soybean trypsin inhibitor. For analysis of cross-linked products, SDS-PAGE was performed using 8% or 15% acrylamide gels according to the method of Laemmli (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the samples were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for 16 h at 100 mA. The blots were then cut into strips, which were used in Western blot analysis as described previously (30Leng X-H. Manolson M. Liu Q. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22487-22493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Protein A-Sepharose-purified antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:1000, and blots were developed using a chemiluminescent detection method from Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories. The stoichiometry of subunits F, G, and H and the 45-kDa glycoprotein were determined by quantitative amino acid analysis as described previously (10Arai H. Terres G. Pink S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8796-8802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified V-ATPase (10–50 μg of protein) was concentrated using a Centricon-30 microconcentrator and DEAE-Sepharose chromatography followed by dialysis against 0.02% C12E9 and lyophilization. The lyophilized enzyme was then dissolved in 100 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. For subunit H and the 45-kDa glycoprotein, samples were applied to a 10% polyacrylamide gel and separated by the method of Laemmli (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). For subunits F and G, samples were applied to a 16.5%/10% discontinuous acrylamide gel prepared and run according to the method of Schägger and von Jagow (31Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10470) Google Scholar). This Schägger gel system was employed for subunits F and G because it provided greater resolution of lower molecular weight polypeptides. Following electrophoresis, proteins were electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon for 4.5 h at 380 mA, followed by staining with Coomassie Blue and destaining of the membrane as described previously (10Arai H. Terres G. Pink S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8796-8802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Quantitation of subunit H and the 45-kDa glycoprotein was done relative to subunit A, which we previously showed was present in three copies per complex, while quantitation of subunits F and G was done relative to the 40-kDa C subunit, which is present in one copy per complex (10Arai H. Terres G. Pink S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8796-8802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In all cases, the bands were excised and subjected to quantitative amino acid analysis using a Waters Pico-tag work station and high performance liquid chromatography. Transfer efficiency was determined by quantitation of the amount of residual protein remaining in the acrylamide gel for each subunit relative to known standards, and agreed well with the values obtained using125I-Bolton-Hunter-labeled protein described previously (10Arai H. Terres G. Pink S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8796-8802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (32Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATP-dependent proton transport was measured by fluorescence quenching using 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine as described previously (33Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5817-5822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To facilitate identification of products following covalent cross-linking of the purified V-ATPase, polyclonal antibodies were prepared in rabbits against either full-length recombinant proteins expressed inEscherichia coli (subunits C, D, and E) or 15–19-amino acid synthetic peptides conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (subunits B, F, G, and H). Antibodies were purified by protein A-Sepharose chromatography and tested for specificity by Western blot analysis against the purified coated vesicle V-ATPase. As can be seen from Fig.1, all antibodies showed specific recognition of the corresponding subunit by Western blot with the exception of the antisera raised against subunit G, which did not show significant reaction (data not shown). The antisera against subunit H recognized two bands of molecular mass 50–57 kDa, consistent with previous reports on the existence of two isoforms of subunit H in the coated vesicle enzyme (34Zhou Z. Peng S-B Crider B.P. Slaaughter C. Xie X.S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5878-5884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The first cross-linking reagent employed was DSG, a bifunctional amino-reactive reagent containing a 7.7-Å linker arm. Cross-linking by DSG was tested in both the intact V1V0 complex and the free V1 domain isolated by glycerol density gradient sedimentation following dissociation with potassium iodide and MgATP (28Puopolo K. Sczekan M. Magner R. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5171-5176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 2, a cross-linked product of molecular mass 50 kDa showed cross-reaction with antibodies against both subunits D and F and was observed in both the intact V1V0 complex and the free V1 domain. The migration of this product agrees well with the predicted molecular mass of a complex containing one copy each of subunits D and F (48 kDa). While a band at 50 kDa could also be observed in the V1 lane (and more faintly in the V1V0 lane) with antibodies against subunit E, experiments described below suggest that this band does not represent cross-linking of subunits E and F. However, a 46-kDa cross-linked product that reacted with the anti-E subunit antibody but did not react with the anti-F subunit antibody was also observed in both V1V0 and V1, and likely represents cross-linking of subunits E and G (predicted molecular mass 46 kDa). In addition to the above complexes, cross-linking by DSG gave rise to a 90-kDa product in V1 that reacted with antibodies against subunits H and E (predicted molecular mass 87–90 kDa) and a 75-kDa product in V1V0 that was recognized by antibodies against subunits C and E (predicted molecular mass 73 kDa). Finally, a doublet around 70 kDa was observed in the V1lane with both the anti-H and anti-F antibodies (predicted molecular mass 68–71 kDa). It should be noted that treatment with DSG appears to cause some internal cross-linking of subunit E, such that a second (or even a third) band appears with slightly lower mobility. This may account for the additional band observed at 50 kDa with the anti-E subunit antibody. To further test the identity of the observed cross-linked products, the V1V0 complex was first treated with trypsin prior to cross-linking with DSG. Under these conditions, subunits D, F, and H were largely digested. As can be seen in Fig.3, the product at 75 kDa recognized by the antibodies against subunits C and E and the product at 46 kDa recognized by the anti-E subunit antibody were unaffected, confirming that these products do not include subunits D, F, or H. The second cross-linking reagent employed was EDC, which, following treatment with NHS, results in cross-linking of amino and carboxyl groups. As can be seen in Fig. 4, treatment of the V1V0 complex with EDC/NHS gave rise to a pair of products around 75 kDa that reacted with both the anti-C and anti-E subunit antibodies (similar to that observed for DSG) and a new product of molecular mass 67 kDa that was recognized by both the anti-D and anti-E subunit antibodies. The predicted molecular mass of a complex between subunits D and E is 67 kDa. The final cross-linking reagent tested was MBP, which is a photoactivatible maleimide that has a linker arm of 10 Å (Fig.5). Reaction with MBP in the dark followed by irradiation with ultraviolet light gave rise to a 135-kDa product that was recognized by the antibody against subunit E. The size of this complex is consistent with cross-linking of subunit E and subunit a of the V0 domain. We have recently shown that subunit a contains a large soluble domain at the amino terminus, which is exposed on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and is therefore situated to interact with the V1 domain (35Leng X.H. Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14655-14661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that treatment of clathrin-coated vesicles with potassium iodide and MgATP results in the release of the V1 subunits from the membrane (36Adachi I. Puopolo K. Marquez-Sterling N. Arai H. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 967-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Puopolo K. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14836-14841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, by Western blot analysis, the A subunit is released nearly quantitatively (38Arai H. Pink S. Forgac M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3075-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). An important question, however, is whether all of the V1 subunits are equally well released from the membrane. To address this question, Western blot analysis was carried out on stripped coated vesicles either before or after treatment with potassium iodide and MgATP using the antibodies against subunits B, C, D, E, F, and H described above. As can be seen in Fig.6, treatment with KI and MgATP results in nearly complete release of subunits B and H (as was previously observed for subunit A; Ref. 38Arai H. Pink S. Forgac M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3075-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), whereas significant amounts of subunits C, D, E, and F remain attached to the membrane. While it is likely that a larger fraction of subunits C, D, and E were removed at the lower protein concentration previously employed in the preparation of V0-containing membranes (28Puopolo K. Sczekan M. Magner R. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5171-5176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these results indicate that it is possible to dissociate subunits A, B, and H while leaving behind substantial amounts of subunits C, D, E, and F. We have previously observed that treatment of the V-ATPase with cystine results in the release of the 50-kDa subunit of the AP2 adaptin complex that is associated with the enzyme and causes loss of V-ATPase activity (39Liu Q. Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31592-31597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has subsequently been reported that an active V-ATPase completely lacking the AP50 polypeptide could be isolated, but that removal of subunit H by urea treatment resulted in loss of ATPase activity (34Zhou Z. Peng S-B Crider B.P. Slaaughter C. Xie X.S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5878-5884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We therefore wished to determine whether cystine treatment of the V-ATPase also led to loss of subunit H, which on SDS-PAGE has a molecular mass similar to AP50. Stripped vesicles were treated with 1 mm cystine at 4 °C as described previously and the V-ATPase then solubilized with C12E9, purified by density gradient sedimentation and subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 10% acrylamide gel and Western blot analysis using the anti-subunit H antiserum as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 7, cystine treatment results in almost complete loss of the lower cross-reactive band as well as some loss of the upper cross-reactive band. Under the conditions employed, cystine treatment led to loss of approximately 93% of V-ATPase activity. Thus, cystine treatment of the V-ATPase leads to loss of at least one of the two isoforms of subunit H. We previously demonstrated using quantitative amino acid analysis that the V-ATPase complex contains three copies each of the A and B subunits, six copies of subunit c, and single copies of subunits C, D, E, a, d, and c“ (10Arai H. Terres G. Pink S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8796-8802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At the time, subunits F, G, and H had not been identified. We therefore wished to determine the copy number of these additional V-ATPase subunits. To avoid interference from the 50-kDa subunit of the AP2 adaptin complex, the V-ATPase was isolated from coated vesicles that had been stripped of their clathrin using 0.5 m Tris (pH 7.0), under which conditions the V-ATPase can be purified free of the AP50 polypeptide (data not shown). To measure the stoichiometry of subunit H, the purified V-ATPase was separated on a 10% acrylamide gel according to the method of Laemmli (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar), while, for measurement of the copy number of subunits F and G, the purified enzyme was separated on a 16.5/10% Schägger gel (31Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10470) Google Scholar), which provides greater resolution of lower molecular mass polypeptides. Following gel electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to Immobilon for quantitative amino acid analysis, with the efficiency of transfer measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The copy number of subunit H is expressed relative to subunit A (which had previously been shown to be present in three copies per complex; Ref. 10Arai H. Terres G. Pink S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8796-8802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while subunits F"

The homeodomain transcription factors brain-4, pax-6, and cdx-2 have been shown to bind to these sites and to transactivate glucagon gene expression. In the present study, we investigated the interaction of cdx-2 and pax-6 with p300, a co-activator coupled to the basal transcription machinery. In transient transfection-expression experiments, we found that the transactivating effects of cdx-2 and pax-6 on the glucagon gene were greatly enhanced by the additional expression of p300.

The cell-specific expression of the proglucagon gene is best studied in the pancreatic α-cells, in which expression is conferred by the proximal G1 promoter element (1Habener J.F. Fehmann H.C. Goeke B. The Insulinotropic Gut Hormone Glucagon-like Peptide-I. Karger, Basel, Switzerland1996Google Scholar). The G1 element contains two AT-rich motifs that are binding sites for homeodomain transcription factors. Recently, the transcription factors cdx-2, pax-6, and brain-4 have been shown to bind the AT-rich elements and transactivate glucagon gene expression (2Laser B. Meda P. Constant I. Philippe J. J.

Nuclear proteins of glucagon-producing cell lines form three main protein complexes with the G1 promoter element (5Philippe J. Drucker D.J. Knepel W. Jepeal L. Misulovin Z. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell.

Habener J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7186-7194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of the two other complexes, the lower molecular weight complex has been reported to contain the paired-domain factor pax-6 as monomer, whereas the higher molecular weight form contains pax-6 in a heterodimer with the caudal-related factor cdx-2 (6Andersen F.

Of these transcription factors, brain-4 is expressed specifically in pancreatic α-cells (4Hussain M.A. Lee J. Miller C.P. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell.

Both CBP and p300 serve as adapter proteins linking DNA binding transcription factors with the basal transcriptional machinery. Furthermore, CBP and p300 are proposed to both activate histone acetyltransferase and displace nucleosomes, as well as recruit RNA polymerase II to the transcription complex (15Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatni Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar).In an attempt to understand the mechanisms underlying the tissue-specific transcription of the proglucagon gene, we have examined the mediation of the transactivating properties of pax-6 and cdx-2. We report here that the transactivating effects of both pax-6 and cdx-2 are mediated through their interaction with the transcriptional co-activator p300. Furthermore, our results suggest that the binding of pax-6 to p300 is weak and that the presence of cdx-2 enhances the physical interaction of pax-6 with p300. Whereas the transcriptional activity of pax-6 is dependent on its binding to its DNA recognition site within the G1 promoter element, binding of cdx-2 to the promoter is not absolutely required since pax-6 tethers cdx-2 to form a complex with cdx-2 and p300.DISCUSSIONThis study provides evidence that both homeodomain proteins pax-6 and cdx-2 interact with co-activator p300 in the transcription of the proglucagon gene. Transcriptional activation of pax-6 and cdx-2 is increased by overexpression of p300 in the heterologous system of BHK-21 fibroblasts. Furthermore, our studies confirm the observation that pax-6 and cdx-2 interact synergistically on the proximal G1 promoter element of the glucagon gene (6Andersen F. Heller R. Petersen H. Jensen J.

Three major protein-DNA complexes are formed between α-cell line nuclear extracts and the G1 element (Fig. 1 A; Refs. 6Andersen F. Heller R. Petersen H. Jensen J. Madsen O. Serup P.

The formation of this complex in EMSA is dependent on the presence of both AT-rich sites present in the G1 promoter element (Fig. 1 B). The protein-DNA complex B contains the homeodomain protein brain-4 (Fig. 1 A; Ref. 4Hussain M.A. Lee J. Miller C.P. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7186-7194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and complex C contains pax-6 homodimer (6Andersen F. Heller R. Petersen H. Jensen J. Madsen O. Serup P.

The protein complex B cannot be accounted for binding by brain-4 alone, since nuclear extracts of BHK-21 cells overexpressing brain-4 form a protein-DNA complex, which is smaller in size than complex B (data not shown). In addition, a combination of brain-4 and pax-6 or cdx-2 incubated with the G1 element fail to form complex B in EMSA experiments (data not shown). Therefore, a protein in addition to brain-4 must be assumed to be involved in the formation of complex B (4Hussain M.A. Lee J. Miller C.P. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell.

Further studies are required to elucidate the identity of this additional factor.It must be assumed that CBP/p300 would be present in all cells, and further addition of p300 would not result in any substantial change in transcription. However, CBP/p300 is shown to be a co-activator present in limiting amounts such that different transcription factors compete for the interaction with this co-activator (21Ron D. Habener J.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that overexpression of p300 can lead to enhanced transactivating effects as shown in the present study. However, the synergistic effect of pax-6 and cdx-2 together with p300 on the transcription of the proglucagon reporter gene at submaximal doses of pax-6 and cdx-2 argues against the notion that CBP analogues may be limiting in BHK-21 cells. The results of the present study rather support the concept that pax-6 and cdx-2 facilitate or stabilize each other's interaction with the co-activator p300 (Fig.9). To this end, in vitrobinding studies show that both GST-pax-6 and GST-cdx-2 can pull downin vitro labeled p300. However, the recovery of p300 through GST-pax-6 was relatively low. By adding unlabeled in vitrotranslated cdx-2 to the GST-pax-6-p300 pull-down assay, the recovery of p300 increased. Although the data do not absolutely prove this idea, they suggest, together with the results of the transient transfection experiments that the interaction of pax-6 and p300 is relatively weak and may be enhanced by the presence of cdx-2 (Fig. 2).In addition, the facilitated interaction of pax-6 with p300 by cdx-2 does not absolutely require binding of cdx-2 to the proximal AT-rich site of the proglucagon gene promoter. The transient transfection data support the notion that, even in the absence of a cdx-2 DNA binding site (Fig. 2, B and C), cdx-2 participates in the transcriptional regulation of the proglucagon gene. Taken together with the data that pax-6 binds cdx-2 in vitro and in vivo, it is likely that pax-6 tethers cdx-2 to the complex formed together with p300. On the other hand, in the presence of cdx-2, overexpression of pax-6 shows a tendency (although not significant) to further stimulate transcription even when its recognition site is mutated (Fig. 2 B). However, in Fig. 2 C, this property of pax-6 is not further recapitulated, suggesting that the DNA binding site for pax-6 is necessary for pax-6 to fully participate in the transcription of the glucagon gene through interaction with the G1 element. Another important observation is that mutation of the 3′ AT-rich site (cdx-2 binding site) significantly reduces the transactivation capacity of pax-6 in the experiment with added p300 (Fig. 2 C). It may be speculated that, even in the absence of cdx-2, an optimal interaction of pax-6 with p300 requires a certain optimal DNA sequence, which is no longer present when the 3′ AT-rich site is mutated. Alternatively, a cryptic pax-6 binding site within the 3′ AT-rich site could be suspected, of which mutation leads to a reduction of pax-6 transactivation. However, the EMSA experiments (Fig.1 B) do not suggest that pax-6 binds to the 3′ AT-rich site.The information derived from Fig. 8 suggests that both pax-6 and cdx-2 interact with the same region (C/H1 domain) of p300. However, from the result of transient transfection data, it cannot be assumed that the interaction site with p300 would be absolutely identical, since it pax-6 and cdx-2 do not appear to compete with the binding to p300, but act synergistically at the functional level. Furthermore, the in vitro observations indicate that cdx-2 may enhance binding of pax-6 to p300, possibly by further stabilizing the interaction of these proteins (Fig. 5). One possible explanation for our findings would be that cdx-2 forms a bridge between pax-6 and p300, no longer requiring a direct p300-pax-6 interaction, whereas in the absence of cdx-2, pax-6 has the capacity of interacting directly with p300. Alternatively, the stronger functional and physical interaction of pax-6 with p300 in the presence of cdx-2 may be due to a change in conformation of the participating proteins when interacting with each other and thus altering their capacity to associate with other proteins. Indeed, altered conformation of interacting homeodomain transcription factors has been described previously (22Passner J.M. Ryoo H.D. Shen L. Mann R.S. Aggarwal A.K. Nature. 1999; 397: 714-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar).Taking all the above considerations into account, it appears that although pax-6, cdx-2, and p300 can interact separately with each other even in the absence of DNA, the optimal functional interaction of these proteins requires an intact proximal G1 element of the proglucagon gene (Fig. 2 C). This notion is further supported by the EMSA results, which demonstrate that both AT-rich sites of the G1 element need be intact for the formation of a protein-DNA containing both pax-6 and cdx-2 (Fig. 1 B). It is important to note at this point that the mutations in the promoter region may also alter the geometric association of the transcription factors, co-activator, and the basal transcription machinery to such an extent that some of the results generated by these methods may not only be accounted for just by the presence or lack of DNA binding sites for transcription factors but also by altered geometry in the region immediately upstream of the transcriptional start site.pax-6 has been shown to bind not only to the G1 element but also to the upstream G3 enhancer element (8Sander M. Neubüser A. Kalamaras J. Ee H.C. Martin G.R. German M.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1662-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Whether pax-6 bound to the G3 element also interacts with cdx-2 and/or p300 cannot be addressed with the present data.cdx-2 has previously been reported to reduce the proliferation rate of intestinal epithelial cells (10Suh E. Chen L. Taylor J. Traber P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7340-7351Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). In other systems, the inhibition of progression through the cell cycle is reported to be mediated by CBP/p300. Thus, the function of cdx-2 in pancreatic α-cells may not only be the expression of the glucagon gene but also inhibition of α-cell proliferation. Little information is available on the pancreatic phenotype in cdx-2 knock-out mice. pax-6, on the other hand, has been implicated in pancreatic islet cell development and phenotype determination (8Sander M. Neubüser A. Kalamaras J. Ee H.C. Martin G.R. German M.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1662-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 9St.-Onge L. Sosa-Pineda B. Nature. 1997; 387: 406-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). pax-6 mutant and knock-out mice have reduced pancreatic endocrine cell mass, with markedly reduced glucagon-producing cells (8Sander M. Neubüser A. Kalamaras J. Ee H.C. Martin G.R. German M.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1662-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 9St.-Onge L. Sosa-Pineda B. Nature. 1997; 387: 406-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). The present results, together with previous reports, further support the notion that the transcription factors implicated in islet cell development are also involved in gene expression of terminally differentiated cells (8Sander M. Neubüser A. Kalamaras J. Ee H.C. Martin G.R. German M.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1662-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 9St.-Onge L. Sosa-Pineda B. Nature. 1997; 387: 406-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 23Sosa-Pineda B. Chowdhury K. Torres M. Oliver G. Gruss P. Nature. 1997; 386: 399-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar).The in vivo relevance of our findings with regard to glucagon gene expression needs to be addressed by further studies. While the present studies show the importance of the interaction of the transcription factors pax-6 and cdx-2 with the α-cell-specific G1 element of the glucagon gene promoter and with the co-activator p300, it should be stated that expression of neither pax-6 nor cdx-2 is restricted to pancreatic α-cells. Of the transcription factors known to be expressed in pancreatic α-cells, brain-4 appears to be restricted to the glucagon-producing cells (4Hussain M.A. Lee J. Miller C.P. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7186-7194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is conceivable that the interaction of cell-specific with non-cell-specific transcription factors leads to an optimal expression of a certain cell-type restricted gene. To this end, in preliminary studies, we have found that overexpression in transgenic mice of brain-4 in the context of other transcription factors required of pancreatic endocrine cell phenotype can lead to ectopic expression of the glucagon gene. 2M. A. Hussain and J. F. Habener, manuscript in preparation. In conclusion, the present studies demonstrate that pax-6 and cdx-2 both interact with p300 at the protein-protein level. Further, the interaction of pax-6 with p300 is enhanced by the presence of cdx-2. Since cdx-2 participates in the transactivation of the proglucagon gene even in absence of its DNA binding site in the G1 promoter element, it is likely that pax-6 tethers cdx-2 to the complex formed by pax-6, cdx-2, and the transcriptional co-activator p300. Both pax-6 and cdx-2 stimulate proglucagon gene expression in pancreatic α-cells through interaction with the cell-specific G1 element. Thus, pax-6, cdx-2, and p300 form a functional complex in the α-cell-specific expression of the proglucagon gene. However, it should be mentioned, as noted above, that additional protein complexes also bind to the G1 element of the proglucagon gene promoter, which confers α-cell-specific expression of the glucagon gene. The elucidation of these additional transcription factors will lead to a better understanding of the complex nature of the tissue-specific expression of the glucagon gene. The glucagon gene is expressed in the pancreatic endocrine α-cells of the pancreatic islets, the L cells of the intestine, and specific areas of the brain (1Habener J.F. Fehmann H.C. Goeke B. The Insulinotropic Gut Hormone Glucagon-like Peptide-I. Karger, Basel, Switzerland1996Google Scholar). The cell-specific expression of the proglucagon gene is best studied in the pancreatic α-cells, in which expression is conferred by the proximal G1 promoter element (1Habener J.F. Fehmann H.C. Goeke B. The Insulinotropic Gut Hormone Glucagon-like Peptide-I. Karger, Basel, Switzerland1996Google Scholar). The G1 element contains two AT-rich motifs that are binding sites for homeodomain transcription factors. Recently, the transcription factors cdx-2, pax-6, and brain-4 have been shown to bind the AT-rich elements and transactivate glucagon gene expression (2Laser B. Meda P. Constant I. Philippe J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28984-28994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 3Jin T. Trinh D.K.Y. Wang F. Drucker D.J. Mol.

Nuclear proteins of glucagon-producing cell lines form three main protein complexes with the G1 promoter element (5Philippe J. Drucker D.J. Knepel W. Jepeal L. Misulovin Z. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4877-4888Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). One of these protein complexes contains the POU domain transcription factor brain-4 (4Hussain M.A. Lee J. Miller C.P. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7186-7194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of the two other complexes, the lower molecular weight complex has been reported to contain the paired-domain factor pax-6 as monomer, whereas the higher molecular weight form contains pax-6 in a heterodimer with the caudal-related factor cdx-2 (6Andersen F. Heller R. Petersen H. Jensen J. Madsen O. Serup P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 306-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 7Ritz-Laser B. Estreicher A. Klages N. Saule S. Philippe J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4124-4132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Of these transcription factors, brain-4 is expressed specifically in pancreatic α-cells (4Hussain M.A. Lee J. Miller C.P. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7186-7194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and pax-6 is expressed in all pancreatic endocrine cells implicated in islet cell development, predominantly the pancreatic α-cells (8Sander M. Neubüser A. Kalamaras J. Ee H.C. Martin G.R. German M.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1662-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 9St.-Onge L. Sosa-Pineda B. Nature. 1997; 387: 406-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). pax-6 also binds to the G3 element of the proglucagon gene enhancer at a site that confers insulin inhibition of proglucagon gene expression (8Sander M. Neubüser A. Kalamaras J. Ee H.C. Martin G.R. German M.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1662-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). cdx-2 is found in both pancreatic α- and β-cell lines (3Jin T. Trinh D.K.Y. Wang F. Drucker D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), as well as in intestinal epithelial cells (3Jin T. Trinh D.K.Y. Wang F. Drucker D.J.

Recently, pax-6 and cdx-2 have been shown to directly bind to each other and to synergistically transactivate the proglucagon gene via interaction with the G1 element of the proglucagon gene promoter (6Andersen F. Heller R. Petersen H. Jensen J. Madsen O. Serup P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 306-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar,7Ritz-Laser B. Estreicher A. Klages N. Saule S. Philippe J. J. Biol.

Both CBP and p300 serve as adapter proteins linking DNA binding transcription factors with the basal transcriptional machinery. Furthermore, CBP and p300 are proposed to both activate histone acetyltransferase and displace nucleosomes, as well as recruit RNA polymerase II to the transcription complex (15Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatni Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar). In an attempt to understand the mechanisms underlying the tissue-specific transcription of the proglucagon gene, we have examined the mediation of the transactivating properties of pax-6 and cdx-2. We report here that the transactivating effects of both pax-6 and cdx-2 are mediated through their interaction with the transcriptional co-activator p300. Furthermore, our results suggest that the binding of pax-6 to p300 is weak and that the presence of cdx-2 enhances the physical interaction of pax-6 with p300. Whereas the transcriptional activity of pax-6 is dependent on its binding to its DNA recognition site within the G1 promoter element, binding of cdx-2 to the promoter is not absolutely required since pax-6 tethers cdx-2 to form a complex with cdx-2 and p300. DISCUSSIONThis study provides evidence that both homeodomain proteins pax-6 and cdx-2 interact with co-activator p300 in the transcription of the proglucagon gene.

However, the mechanisms responsible for the formation of SNO-Hb and those underlying the release of NO and subsequent biological activity have yet to be elucidated. In the present study, a number of nitrosated oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) derivatives have been synthesized and characterized. HbO2can be nitrosated at up to three distinct residues, one in the α-globin chain and two in the β-chain. A β-chain mononitrosated species (designated “SNO-Hb”), generated by the reaction of HbO2 and S-nitrosoglutathione, released NO via a thiol-dependent mechanism involving nucleophilic attack at the nitrosated thiol functionality of SNO-Hb; in the case of glutathione, this process was associated with the formation of a mixed disulfide. In contrast, multinitrosated hemoglobin species released NO and relaxed vascular smooth muscle by a thiol-independent mechanism. HbO2 scavenged potently NO released from SNO-Hb and inhibited its vasorelaxant properties. These data show that the predominant vasoactive species released from SNO-Hb is NO, with HNO a putative intermediate; the presence of a low molecular weight thiol is a prerequisite for this process. Such observations have important implications for the generation, metabolic fate, and biological activity of S-nitrosothiols.

Ignarro L.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 134-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The best characterized target sites for NO are proteins possessing transition metal ion prosthetic groups; this is exemplified by the interaction of NO with the heme moiety of soluble guanylyl cyclase resulting in the formation of the intracellular second messenger cyclic guanosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cGMP) (2Hobbs A.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 484-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Recently, it has become apparent that modification of proteins by NO at cysteine or tyrosine residues may also play an important role in regulating function (3Beckman J.S. Ischiropoulos H. Zhu L. van der Woerd M. Smith C. Chen J. Harrison J. Martin J. Tsai M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 438-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar, 4Keefer L.K. Williams D.L. Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. Wiley & Sons, Ltd., New York1996: 509-519Google Scholar). Nitration of tyrosine may have important pathological consequences in conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other neurodegenerative disorders (5Ischiropoulos H. Zhu L. Chen J. Tsai M. Martin J. Smith C. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar). In contrast, nitrosation of cysteine residues in proteins, to yield S-nitrosothiols, may represent a physiological regulatory mechanism. This phenomenon is illustrated by nitrosation of the cardiac ryanodine receptor which results in a marked increase in Ca2+ flux (6Xu L. Eu J.P. Meissner G. Stamler J.S. Science. 1998; 279: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar) and by nitrosation of p21ras which acts as a molecular switch to regulate signal transduction (7Lander H.M. Hajjar D.P.

It has also been suggested thatS-nitrosothiol formation may be a mechanism by which NO is transported to targets distant from its point of synthesis.S-Nitrosothiols are considerably more stable than NO itself (8Kowaluk E.A. Fung H.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 255: 1256-1264PubMed Google Scholar) and reproduce the biological actions of NO (9Stamler J.S. Simon D.I. Osborne J.A. Mullins M.E. Jaraki O. Michel T. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). As such, incorporation of NO into a S-nitrosothiol may serve to preserve the biological activity of NO. A significant physiological role has been proposed for a nitrosated derivative of hemoglobin, S-nitrosohemoglobin (SNO-Hb) (10Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar,11Stamler J.S. Jia L. Eu J.P. McMahon T.J. Demchenko I.T. Bonaventura J. Gernert K. Piantadosi C.A. Science. 1997; 276: 2034-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). SNO-Hb can be formed via a transnitrosation reaction between oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) and low molecular weightS-nitrosothiols (e.g. S-nitrosocysteine, CysNO, orS-nitrosoglutathione, GSNO). This process has been suggested to result in the transfer of an NO moiety to Cys93 on the β-globin chain (10Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar). SNO-Hb is found in the systemic circulation, at concentrations approximately 10 times higher in the arterial (∼300 nm) than the venous (∼30 nm) blood. This arterial-venous difference has led to the suggestion that SNO-Hb might act as an NO donor in the systemic circulation. It has also been proposed that the rate of release of NO from SNO-Hb is inversely related to the ambient oxygen tension and that the allosteric changes in Hb (shifts between the relaxed (R) and tense (T) states), which facilitate the delivery of oxygen to tissues, might also promote the release of NO. Such a system would preferentially deliver oxygen to tissues in which oxygen utilization was high and would dilate the vessels supplying such tissues to ensure adequate delivery of oxygenated blood. The mechanism(s) by which SNO-Hb might be formed endogenously and the pathway by which the NO moiety of SNO-Hb exerts its biological activity have not been explained. Due to the potentially significant biological role of SNO-Hb, the biochemical and pharmacological characteristics of this compound have been investigated. CysNO and GSNO were prepared by reaction of the appropriate thiol (l-isomer) with sodium nitrite at pH 2 (8Kowaluk E.A. Fung H.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 255: 1256-1264PubMed Google Scholar). HbO2 was prepared by reacting commercially available hemoglobin (human) with a molar excess of sodium dithionite at 20 °C with subsequent purification through Sephadex G-25 columns. Nitrosated Hb derivatives were prepared by incubating HbO2 with a 10-fold molar excess of CysNO, GSNO, or DEA-NO for 45 min at room temperature and protected from light, with subsequent purification through Sephadex G-25 columns. The concentration of HbO2and SNO-Hb in the column eluate was determined by UV-Vis spectroscopy (λmax = 415 nm; ε = 125 mm). The concentrations of SNO-Hb (and other nitrosated hemoglobin derivatives) stated in the text are expressed on the basis of heme content and not the concentration of nitrosated subunits. Male Harlan-Sprague Dawley rats (200–250 g) were killed by stunning and cervical dislocation. The thoracic aorta was dissected and cleared of connective tissue and blood products. Intact rings, 2–3 mm in width, were mounted in 25-ml glass organ baths containing Krebs bicarbonate buffer (composition mm: NaCl, 118.1; KCl, 4.7; MgSO4, 1.0; KH2PO4, 1.0; CaCl2, 2.5; NaHCO3, 25.0; glucose, 11.1) which was maintained at 37 °C. Tissues were gassed continuously with 95% O2, 5% CO2, unless otherwise stated. A resting tension of 1 g was applied to each tissue and changes in tension recorded with a Grass FT03 force displacement transducer attached to a Rikadenki (R-64) chart recorder. Where indicated, the endothelium was removed from the tissues by gently rubbing the lumenal surface with forceps. The rings were allowed to equilibrate for 1 h prior to experimentation. Vessels that generated an active tone of less than 1 g in response to a submaximal concentration of phenylephrine (1 μm) were discarded. To test the functional integrity of the endothelium, phenylephrine-precontracted vessels which showed >50% relaxation to 1 μm carbamylcholine were deemed endothelium intact, those exhibiting <15% relaxation were regarded as endothelium denuded; vessels not satisfying either criterion were discarded. In experiments investigating the vasorelaxant potency of SNO-Hb in the presence and absence of thiols, time-matched tissues were split into two groups. Concentration-response curves to SNO-Hb were constructed in the presence or absence of GSH, cysteine, or bovine serum albumin (added 15 min prior to the SNO-Hb). An identical protocol was followed to examine the effect of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate on SNO-Hb-induced relaxations. In certain experiments a fixed concentration of SNO-Hb was added to control and test tissues and a concentration-response curve to cumulative additions of thiol (either GSH or cysteine) established in the test tissue. Studies examining theS-nitrosothiol-dependent component of relaxations to SNO-Hb involved incubation of nitrosated Hb preparations with HgCl2 (degrades S-NO bonds; 10 μm; 15 min) prior to addition to the organ baths. In all cases, responses are expressed as a percentage of phenylephrine-induced tone. The vasorelaxant actions of SNO-Hb were also studied in tissues exposed to different oxygen concentrations in order to alter the globin allosteric conformation. This was achieved by gassing the organ baths with the following gas mixtures: 21% O2, 4% CO2 in N2, 10% O2, 4% CO2 in N2 and 5% O2, 4% CO2 in N2; these gas combinations resulted in calculated oxygen tensions (pO2) in the baths of approximately 160, 76, and 38 mm Hg, respectively. S-Nitrosothiol concentrations were measured according to the method of Saville (12Saville B. Analyst. 1958; 83: 670-672Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were mixed with 0.1% ammonium sulfamate in 0.4 n HCl for 1 min (to remove NO2−) and then mixed with a solution of 3% sulfanilamide and 0.25% HgCl2 in 0.4 n HCl, followed immediately by 0.1%N-(1-naphthyl)ethylendiamine dihydrochloride in 0.4n HCl and incubated for 10 min. Absorbance was read at 540 nm and S-nitrosothiol concentration calculated by comparison with a standard curve constructed with 1–500 μmNaNO2. In certain experiments, low molecular weight thiols (M r < 30,000) were separated from the hemoglobin molecules by centrifuging the reaction mixture in a Centricon-30 spin column (Sartorius, Goettingen, Germany) and theS-nitrosothiol content of each fraction measured as described above. GSNO formation was also quantified by HPLC. Aliquots from reaction mixtures containing SNO-Hb (0.5 mm) and GSH (5 mm) were injected at various time points into a Hewlett-Packard Series II 1090 HPLC system running a RP-18 Lithosorb 12.5-cm column using 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 2.5 (88%), + methanol (12%) as eluent (1 ml/min). GSNO and GSSG formation were quantified by comparison to a standard curve constructed by injecting known concentrations of each compound into the same system under identical conditions. Furthermore, reaction samples were spiked with GSNO and GSSG to confirm the identity of the observed peaks. Retention times for GSNO and GSSG were found to be 2.7 and 1.7 min, respectively. The globin chains were separated by reverse phase-HPLC using a modification of the procedure outlined in Ferrantiet al. (13Ferranti P. Malorni A. Mamone G. Sannolo N. Marino G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and based on the method of Shelton et al. (14Shelton J.B. Shelton F.R. Schroeder W.A. J. Liquid Chromatogr. 1984; 7: 1969-1977Crossref Scopus (409) Google Scholar). A 250 × 4.6-mm Macrosphere 300 C4 (Alltech, Deerfield, IL) column was equilibrated with a 50:50 mixture of buffer A (80:20, water:acetonitrile; 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and buffer B (40:60, water:acetonitrile; 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. 20 μl of each sample was loaded and eluted with a 2-min hold at 50% B, followed by a linear gradient to 66% B over 18 min. The column effluent was split 4:1 with 800 μl/min flow into a UV spectrophotometer monitored at 280 nm and 200 μl/min into the ES/MS source. ES/MS analysis was performed on a Quattro LC mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, United Kingdom) fitted with a linear inlet probe. The source temperature was 130 °C, with N2 drying gas flow of 850l/h. The capillary voltage was set at 3.5 kV and cone voltage set at 30 V. The spectrum was scanned continuously from 700 to 1500 m/z with a scan time of 3 s for the entire duration of the HPLC elution. Mass scale calibration was carried out using human hemoglobin as the reference compound. Infusion analysis of this standard human hemoglobin sample (20 pmol/μl in 50:50 water:acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; 10 μl/min; source temperature 65 °C) gave the α-globin mass as 15,129 Da and β-globin mass as 15,870 Da. A Clark-type NO electrode (World Precision Instruments, Saratoga, FL) was used to study the pattern of free NO release from various S-nitrosothiols. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C and the change in voltage output (pA) in response to compound administration was recorded. Quantification of NO release was achieved by reference to a standard curve constructed by addition of increasing concentrations of NaNO2 under reducing conditions (acidified KI) to yield known concentrations of NO. All reagents used were from Sigma (Poole, United Kingdom) except for DEA-NO (diethylamine-NONOate) and SPER-NO (spermine-NONOate; Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI). All statistical analyses were performed using the Statistica software package (release 4.5, StatSoft, Tulsa, OK). Concentration-response curves from organ bath studies were analyzed with a sigmoid maximal response model (E max) and the computer program Origin (Release 4.0, Microcal Software, Northampton, MA). All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. A probability (p) value of <0.05 was taken as an appropriate level of significance. Incubation of 0.5 mm HbO2 (based upon heme content) with a 10-fold molar excess of GSNO or CysNO at room temperature (light protected) for 45 min resulted in the formation of 127.4 ± 14.4 μm (25.5% conversion; n = 5) and 292.2 ± 13.7 μm (58.4% conversion;n = 5) nitrosated Hb products, respectively. Higher concentration of S-nitrosothiol (10 mm), increasing the incubation time (up to 2 h), or increasing the incubation temperature (37 °C) did not increase the proportion of nitrosated products formed. Reaction of CysNO and HbO2 at a ratio of 1:1 also resulted in the formation of a small quantity of nitrosated Hb (86.36 ± 10.2 μm; 17.0% conversion;n = 3). In all cases, significantly less nitrosation occurred if the reaction mixture was exposed to light during the 45-min incubation period (data not shown). Incubation of HbO2 (0.5 mm) with a 10-fold molar excess of the NO donor DEA-NO also resulted in the formation of a nitrosated Hb derivative (246.5 ± 89.2 μm; 49.3% conversion; n = 4). Mass spectrometric analysis revealed that incubation of HbO2 (0.5 mm) with a 10-fold molar excess of CysNO resulted in the formation of three new species. 51% of the β-globin chains were nitrosated at a single residue as indicated by an increase in M r of + 29; 43% of the β-chains became nitrosated at two residues (ΔM r + 58). Additionally, a small fraction (17%) of α-globin chains were nitrosated at one residue (ΔM r + 29). Addition of GSH (10 mm) to this Hb preparation resulted in the loss of all nitrosated products detectable by MS (TableI). At a HbO2:CysNO ratio of 1:1 (each 0.5 mm), 35% of the β-chains became nitrosated at a single residue.Table IMass spectrometric analysis of nitrosated Hb preparations under various experimental conditionsHb-globin chainS-Nitrosothiol:HbO2 ratioNativeM rΔM r + 29 (+NO)ΔM r + 58 (+2NO)ΔM r + 305 (+GS)AlphaControl (M r = 15129)100%CysNO (1:1)100%CysNO (10:1)83%17%CysNO (10:1) + GSH (10 mm)100%GSNO (1:1)100%GSNO (10:1)100%BetaControl (M r = 15870)100%CysNO (1:1)65%35%CysNO (10:1)5%51%43%CysNO (10:1) + GSH (10 mm)100%GSNO (1:1)100%GSNO (10:1)29%43%28%GSNO (10:1) + GSH (10 mm)69%31%GSNO (10:1) + DTT (10 mm)100%Following incubation of either CysNO or GSNO with HbO2 at the ratios given in column 2 (including any subsequent additions), products formed are shown in columns 3–6.

ΔM r = 29 indicates the addition of one NO equivalent; ΔM r = 58 addition of two NO equivalents; ΔM r = 305 addition of GS. The results are representative of three similar experiments. Incubation of HbO2 (0.5 mm) with a 10-fold molar excess of GSNO yielded markedly different products to those described above. 43% of the β-globin chains were nitrosated at a single residue (ΔM r + 29) but, in addition, 28% had an increase in mass of +305, indicative of the formation of a mixed disulfide between GSH and Hb. Addition of GSH (10 mm) to this nitrosated Hb preparation had little effect on the disulfide component (31%) but completely removed the bound NO. However, dithiothreitol (10 mm) was able to remove the NO group and disulfide bond such that all the Hb returned to a native molecular mass. Incubation of HbO2 and GSNO at a ratio of 1:1 (each 0.5 mm) did not result in the formation of any detectable nitrosated products. The above observations are in close agreement with the biochemical analysis (Saville assay (12Saville B. Analyst. 1958; 83: 670-672Crossref Google Scholar)). Synthesis of a nitrosated Hb preparation from a 10-fold molar excess of CysNO resulted in the formation of products possessing 1 to 3 NO moieties, representing (on average) 50% nitrosation based upon heme. Using a 1:1 ratio of HbO2:CysNO, a small quantity of mononitrosated Hb was formed (35% of β-chains ≡ 17.5% on the basis of heme). Likewise, SNO-Hb formed from GSNO exhibited nitrosation at ∼50% of its β-globin chains, equivalent to ∼25% of displaceable NO per Hb tetramer. Therefore, since the Hb preparation obtained by incubating HbO2 with GSNO resulted in a mononitrosated (β-chain) derivative, and that GSNO represents the most physiologically relevantS-nitrosothiol within erythrocytes (15Liu Z. Rudd M.A. Freedman J.E. Loscalzo J.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 284: 526-534PubMed Google Scholar), the compound synthesized by this method was termed S-nitrosohemoglobin (SNO-Hb); subsequent experimentation focused on this reagent. Incubation of SNO-Hb for 60 min at 25 or 37 °C in phosphate-buffered saline did not result in a significant decrease of the SNO content of the preparation (data not shown). However, in the presence of GSH (100 μm-10 mm), a time- and concentration-dependent loss of SNO-Hb was observed. The nitroso content of the SNO-Hb preparation, expressed as a percentage of the initial concentration, was 92.2 ± 4.1, 66.5 ± 5.0, and 58.2 ± 4.9% (mean ± S.E.; n > 5) in the presence of 100 μm, 1 mm, and 10 mm GSH, respectively (see also Fig.1). GSNO alone did not significantly decompose over a 60-min incubation period at 25 or 37 °C (data not shown). However, in the presence of GSH (10 mm), decomposition of GSNO occurred in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1). Following the 60-min incubation period, separation of low molecular weight thiols (M r < 30,000) from the hemoglobin derivatives revealed that low molecular weightS-nitrosothiols accounted for 5.2 ± 0.8% (n = 4) of the nitroso content loss from SNO-Hb. HPLC analysis of the reaction between SNO-Hb (0.5 mm) and a 10-fold molar excess of GSH revealed that GSNO formation peaked within 1 min (29.8 ± 2 μm; n = 3) and then declined in a linear fashion such that levels were not significantly above background after 90 min. Concomitantly, a rise in the level of glutathione disulfide was observed (GSSG; data not shown). SNO-Hb (100 nm) did not release NO under control conditions. However, in the presence of a low molecular weight thiol (GSH orl-cysteine), an increase in NO release from SNO-Hb was observed (Fig. 2). The pattern of release of NO from SNO-Hb was specific for each low molecular weight thiol studied, although both evoked release of NO immediately upon addition. In the presence of cysteine, NO release peaked sharply and returned to baseline within 10 min. In the presence of GSH, however, a slow long-lasting release of NO was observed (Fig. 2). The presence of HbO2 significantly affected the detectable levels of NO released from SNO-Hb as measured by the NO electrode. The detectable NO release from a mixture of SNO-Hb (100 nm) and GSH (100 μm) was reduced, in a concentration-dependent manner, by HbO2 (0.1–10 μm; Fig. 2) In endothelium-intact vessels, addition of SNO-Hb to pre-contracted aortic rings resulted in a further contraction, which was not observed in denuded vessels (data not shown). To avoid this confounding effect on tone (presumably due to scavenging of NO released basally from the endothelium), subsequent studies were conducted in denuded rings. SNO-Hb did not relax rat aortic rings unless a low molecular weight thiol was also present (Fig.3) and the vasorelaxant potency of SNO-Hb could be enhanced by increasing the concentration of thiol (Fig.4). The biological activity of authentic SNO-Hb synthesized from GSNO differed markedly from the nitrosated Hb preparations synthesized with CysNO or DEA-NO. The derivative prepared by incubating HbO2 with CysNO caused a concentration-dependent relaxation of pre-contracted rat aortic rings that was not affected by the presence of GSH (Fig. 3); an almost identical pattern of vasorelaxant activity was observed with a nitrosated Hb preparation synthesized from DEA-NO (data not shown). Interestingly, the potency of SNO-Hb was some 10 times less than the nitrosated Hb derivative synthesized with CysNO (Fig. 3). These observations are consistent with the LC-MS data which indicate that CysNO and DEA-NO are capable of nitrosating multiple thiol- (and possibly non-thiol-) sites within HbO2, whereas GSNO appears to transnitrosate a specific cysteine residue (presumably Cysβ93). This thesis was supported by experiments in which the different nitrosated Hb preparations were incubated with HgCl2 (10 μm; 15 min) prior to administration to the organ bath. In this case, SNO-Hb (0.3 μm) lost all vasorelaxant activity (control relaxation: 64.1 ± 5.0%, relaxation following HgCl2 treatment: 2.1 ± 2.1%; mean ± S.E.; n = 3; p < 0.05) whereas the nitrosated product prepared from CysNO (0.1 μm) was still able to elicit ∼80% of its control response (control relaxation: 77.4 ± 7.2%, relaxation following HgCl2 treatment: 60.8 ± 5.1%; mean ± S.E.;n = 3). The product of the reaction between HbO2 and GSNO at a ratio of 1:1, which lacked any detectable nitrosated residues (by Saville assay and LC-MS), had no pharmacological activity (data not shown).Figure 4Effect of different concentrations of glutathione (1–100 μm) on the concentration-response curve to SNO-Hb in endothelium-denuded rings of rat aorta.

Furthermore, only low molecular weight thiols could facilitate SNO-Hb-induced relaxations since no response was observed in the presence of bovine serum albumin (up to 1 mm; data not shown). SNO-Hb was also able to elicit vascular smooth muscle relaxation in the presence of cysteine; this effect was not stereoselective since d-cysteine was at least as potent asl-cysteine (Fig. 5). Concentration-response curves to SNO-Hb (30 nm-30 μm; in the presence of 100 μm GSH), were significantly shifted to the right in the presence of increasing concentrations of HbO2 (0.1–30 μm; Fig. 6). At the highest concentration of HbO2, the vasorelaxant effect of SNO-Hb was virtually abolished. Concentration-response curves to SNO-Hb (0.1–30 μm; in the presence of 100 μm GSH) were conducted at various oxygen tensions by exposing the tissues to different gas mixtures 1 h prior to and during experimentation. A gas mixture containing 21 or 10% oxygen did not significantly affect the vasorelaxant activity of SNO-Hb. A gas mixture containing 5% oxygen caused a significant increase in potency of SNO-Hb, but also decreased the phenylephrine-induced tone by 22 ± 9% (n = 5). However, when the concentration of phenylephrine was increased to give an equivalent tone to that observed under control conditions (i.e. 95% O2, 5% CO2), no significant difference in the potency of SNO-Hb was detected (Fig. 7). Thus, a greater degree of relaxation at low pO2, by virtue of the starting contraction being of a lesser magnitude, can be easily misinterpreted as an apparent increase in potency of SNO-Hb due to functional antagonism. In control experiments, an almost identical leftward shift was observed for the concentration-response curves to the NO donor, SPER-NO, when tissues were gassed with 5% oxygen; again, this effect was absent in tissues in which the phenylephrine concentration was increased to elicit a contraction equivalent to that observed in control tissues (data not shown). In endothelium-intact aortae, following exposure to 5% O2 it was not possible to elicit a contraction equivalent to that in control tissues even at millimolar concentrations of phenylephrine. As a consequence, the potency of SNO-Hb always appeared enhanced in these tissues. In the presence of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (100 μm), which facilitates the allosteric transformation of hemoglobin from the T to R state, the vasorelaxant potency of SNO-Hb was unaffected at any of the oxygen tensions studied (Fig. 8).Figure 8Effect of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (100 μm; closed circles) on the concentration-response curve to SNO-Hb (open circles) in the presence of 100 μm GSH in endothelium-denuded rings of rat aorta at 5% O2 (with phenylephrine precontraction adjusted to an equivalent tone of carbogen conditions).

It has been suggested previously that SNO-Hb, formed by the nitrosation of HbO2, may function as an O2-sensitive endogenous NO donor (10Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S.

However, the mechanism by which SNO-Hb is formed endogenously and the route by which the NO moiety may be surrendered is not known. The current investigation has attempted to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these processes. The present study demonstrates that HbO2 can be nitrosated by incubation with low molecular weight S-nitrosothiols, such as GSNO and CysNO; however, the characteristics of this process are particular to the nitrosating agent employed. In the case of GSNO, the product formed is nitrosated solely at a free -SH group present in the β-glo"

The JNK pathway can be activated by a variety of extracellular stimuli such as growth factors, cytokines, tumor promoters, protein synthesis inhibitors, ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, and oncoproteins (1Karin M.

However, its function in many physiological processes is still poorly understood. Specific chemical inhibitors and constitutively active kinase mutants have successfully been used in exploring the physiological functions of the ERK and p38 MAP kinase pathways (31Cowley S.

Such inhibitors and constitutively active mutants, however, have yet to be reported for the JNK pathway. A great deal of effort has been made to generate constitutively active kinase mutants for the JNK pathway but with no success. At the level of MAP kinase kinase kinase, a truncated form of MEKK1, MEKKΔ, has very high activity and can preferentially activate the JNK pathway when expressed at a low level (16Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). However, it still stimulates the ERK and p38 pathways in transfected cells, even though to a lesser extent (39Xu S. Robbins D.J. Christerson L.B. English J.M. Vanderbilt C.A. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5291-5295Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In addition, MEKKΔ also activates the IκB kinase complex, which plays a critical role in NF-κB activation (40Lee F.S. Peters R.T. Dang L.C. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It has been reported that MEKK4 is a more specific activator for the JNK pathway (20Gerwins P. Blank J.L. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8288-8295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), but its human homologue MTK1 also activates p38 (18Takekawa M. Posas F. Saito H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4973-4982Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). It is known that activation of MAP kinase kinases depends on phosphorylation of two conserved Ser/Thr residues between the subkinase domains VII and VIII in the activation-loop (44Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). Replacement of these Ser/Thr residues with acidic amino acids, such as glutamic acid (Glu) or aspartic acid (Asp), has resulted in several constitutively active MAP kinase kinase mutants, including MEK1(ED) (31Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marchall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1850) Google Scholar, 32Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Wound G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar) and MKK6b(EE) (34Huang S. Jiang Y. Li Z. Nishida E. Mathias P. Lin S. Ulevitch R.J. Nemerow G.R. Han J. Immunity. 1997; 6: 739-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Because these Ser/Thr residues are also conserved in JNKK1 and JNKK2, it was thought that the same strategy might be used to yield a constitutively active JNKK. Surprisingly, the corresponding JNKK mutants, JNKK1(2E) and JNKK2(3E), are catalytically inactive. 2C. Zheng and A. Lin, unpublished results. 2C. Zheng and A. Lin, unpublished results. This suggests that the activation of JNKK may be more complicated than previously thought. To generate constitutively active kinase components for the JNK pathway, we used the approach of enzyme-substrate fusion. The rate of an enzymatic reaction is greatly influenced by the proximity between the enzyme and its substrate. We reasoned that JNK might become constitutively activated if it is physically linked to its upstream activator JNKK. Unlike JNKK1 that activates both JNK and p38 (5Derijard B. Raingeaud J.

Su B. Gene ( Amst. ). 1998; 212: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In addition, JNKK2 has considerable basal enzymatic activity when overexpressed in cells (6Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H. Claret F.X. Lange-Carter C. Mercurio F. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1995; 268: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Thus, we fused JNK1 to JNKK2 via a short peptide linker and created the JNKK2-JNK1 fusion protein. The JNKK2-JNK1 fusion protein showed profound JNK activity and was able to stimulate c-Jun transcriptional activity in the absence of any stimulus. The constitutively active JNKK2-JNK1 fusion protein will provide a powerful tool for investigating the physiological functions of the JNK pathway. HeLa and human embryonic kidney 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml of streptomycin. To construct the JNKK2-JNK1 fusion construct, pSRα3HA-JNKK2 was first digested with NotI andBglII to release the C-terminal part of JNKK2-(796–1206). A PCR-generated NotI-NcoI fragment encoding the C-terminal part of JNKK2 with a (Gly-Glu)5 linker at its 3′-end and an NcoI-BglII fragment encoding JNK1 were inserted into the NotI-BglII-digested pSRα3HA-JNKK2. A ChameleonTM mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to replace lysine (Lys) 149 with methionine (Met) to create the hemagglutinin (HA)-JNKK2(K149M)-JNK1 fusion protein. To construct pSRα3HA-JNKK2-JNK1 (APY) construct, the JNK1 part in the JNKK2-JNK1 fusion construct was replaced by anNcoI-BglII fragment encoding JNK1 (APY) (9Lu X. Nemoto S. Lin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24751-24754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The constructs were confirmed by DNA dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Expression vectors of HA-tagged JNKK2, Flag (M2)-tagged JNK1, MEKKΔ, Rac1 V12, Cdc42Hs V12, HA-MEK1(ΔNED), HA-ERK2, HA-MKK6b(EE), M2-p38, GAL4-c-Jun, and GAL4-c-Jun (AA63/73), have been described previously (6Lin A.

The reporter gene 5× GAL4-Luc, in which the GAL4 DNA-binding domain was fused to the luciferase gene, has also been described previously (6Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H. Claret F.X. Lange-Carter C. Mercurio F. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1995; 268: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). GST-c-Jun-(1–79) and GST-ATF2, GST-JNK1, and GST-p38 were purified on glutathione-agarose, as described (6Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H. Claret F.X. Lange-Carter C. Mercurio F. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1995; 268: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 9Lu X. Nemoto S. Lin A. J. Biol.

Histidine-tagged ERK2 was purified on a nickel-chelate column, according to the manufacturer's procedure (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). HeLa or 293 cells were transiently transfected with various expression vectors using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc., NY), according to the manufacturer's procedure. After 40 h, the cells were treated with different stimuli or left untreated, as indicated in the figure legends. The cells were harvested and the lysates were prepared, as described previously (6Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H. Claret F.X. Lange-Carter C. Mercurio F. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1995; 268: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). HA-tagged or M2-tagged protein kinases were immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies for 3 h at 4 °C. The activity of the immune complex was assayed at 30 °C for 30 min in 30 μl of kinase buffer (6Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H. Claret F.X. Lange-Carter C. Mercurio F. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1995; 268: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar) in the presence of 10 μm ATP/10 μCi [γ-32P]ATP (10 Ci/mmol) with appropriate substrates, as indicated in the figure legends. The reactions were terminated with 4× Laemmli sample buffers. The proteins were resolved by 13% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by autoradiography. The phosphorylated proteins were quantitated by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics Inc.). For immunoblotting analysis, proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 13% gels, blotted onto Immobilon P membranes (Millipore), and subjected to immunoblotting analysis using anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma), or anti-phospho-JNK (on both Thr183 and Tyr185) polyclonal antibody (New England Biolabs Inc.), as indicated in the figure legends. The antibody-antigen complexes were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), according to the manufacturer's procedure. Immunofluorescence analysis was performed as described previously (45Lin A. Frost J. Deng T. Smeal T. Al-Alawi N. Kikkaw U. Hunter T. Brenner D. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 777-789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells were plated onto coverslips and transfected with various expression vectors. After 36 h, the cells were fixed with ice-cold methanol for 7 min and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) three times. The coverslips were incubated with anti-HA antibody (1:50) in PBS at 37 °C for 30 min and then washed with PBS. Immune complexes were detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibody (1:400, Jackson ImmunoResearch, Inc.) in PBS at room temperature for 1 h. The nuclei were stained with H33258 (1:500) in PBS for 2 min. The coverslips were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Inc.). Fluorescence microscopy was performed with a Zeiss Axioplan microscope. Because the approach of site-directed mutagenesis failed to produce a constitutively active JNKK,2 we explored the possibility of generating a constitutively active JNK through enzyme-substrate fusion. JNK1 was fused in frame with its specific activator JNKK2 (Fig.1 A). A decapeptide linker (Gly-Glu)5, was inserted between the coding sequences of JNKK2 and JNK1 to facilitate the folding (46Robinson M.J. Stippec S.A. Goldsmith E. White M.A. Cobb M.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1141-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell-free translation ofin vitro generated JNKK2-JNK1 transcripts produced a single polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 86 kDa, as expected (Fig. 1 B). Using the same strategy, we also constructed JNKK2(KM)-JNK1, in which the lysine (Lys) 149 in the ATP binding domain of the JNKK2 moiety was replaced by methionine (Met), and JNKK2-JNK1 (APY), in which the Tyr185 residue in the JNK1 moiety was replaced by a nonphosphorylatable alanine (Ala). We tested whether the JNKK2-JNK1 fusion protein has Jun kinase activity and, if so, whether it is a more active Jun kinase than JNK1 stimulated by cotransfection with JNKK2. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors encoding HA-JNKK2-JNK1, HA-JNKK2(K149M)-JNK1, HA-JNKK2-JNK1 (APY), M2-JNK1 with or without HA-JNKK2, or empty expression vector. After 40 h, the cells were harvested and the transfected kinases were isolated by immunoprecipitation. The kinase activity was measured by immunocomplex kinase assays with GST-c-Jun-(1–79) as a substrate (6Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H. Claret F.X. Lange-Carter C. Mercurio F. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1995; 268: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). As reported previously (9Lu X. Nemoto S. Lin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24751-24754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), coexpression of JNKK2 activated JNK1 modestly (Fig. 2, lanes 2–4). In contrast, the JNKK2-JNK1 fusion protein itself was 30-fold more active than the nonstimulated JNK1 (Fig. 2, lanes 5–7). This activity was not a result of differences in the expression between HA-JNKK2-JNK1 and M2-JNK1/HA-JNKK2, as demonstrated by immunoblotting analysis (Fig. 2). Under the same conditions, the JNKK2(K149M)-JNK1 fusion protein had no detectable Jun kinase activity (Fig. 2,lane 8) nor did the JNKK2-JNK1 (APY) fusion protein (data not shown). These results indicate that the JNKK2-JNK1 fusion protein has profound Jun kinase activity, which likely results from activation of JNK1 by JNKK2 in the fusion protein. Activation of JNK1 requires its phosphorylation on both Thr183 and Tyr185 residues (3Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barret T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2953) Google Scholar). Because the JNKK2-JNK1 functions as an activated Jun kinase, we examined whether JNK1 is phosphorylated by JNKK2 in the fusion protein. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors encoding HA-JNKK2-JNK1, HA-JNKK2(KM)-JNK1, or empty vector. The cells were treated with anisomycin (which is a strong stimulus of JNK) for 15 min or left untreated. The cells were harvested and the extracts were fractionated by SDS-gel electrophoresis, followed by immunoblotting with the anti-JNK antibody (Pharmingen) or the specific anti-phospho-JNK antibody (New England Biolabs, Inc.), which only recognizes the dual-phosphorylated JNK (on both Thr183 and Tyr185). As expected, the anti-phospho-JNK antibody only recognized anisomycin-stimulated, but not nonstimulated, endogenous JNK1 and JNK2 (Fig. 3, left panel,lanes 1 and 2). The anti-phospho-JNK antibody also recognized the transfected HA-JNKK2-JNK1 fusion protein (Fig. 3,left panel, lane 3). Under the same conditions, it failed to detect the inactive HA-JNKK2(KM)-JNK1 mutant (Fig. 3,left panel, lane 4). This was not a result of differences in protein expression, as demonstrated by immunoblotting analysis with anti-JNK antibody (Fig. 3, right panel). Thus, activation of JNK1 in the fusion protein may result from its phosphorylation by JNKK2 on Thr183 and Tyr185residues. To determine whether the JNKK2-JNK1 fusion protein is a constitutively active Jun kinase, we compared its activity with that of JNK1 stimulated by various activators and extracellular stimuli. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors encoding HA-JNKK2-JNK1, HA-JNK1 with or without the active forms of MEKK1, Rac1, Cdc42, or empty expression vector. After 40 h, the cells were treated with EGF, TNF-α, anisomycin, UV, or left untreated, as indicated. The activity of HA-JNKK2-JNK1 was equivalent or comparable with that of HA-JNK1 activated by the above activators and stimuli, as measured by immunocomplex kinase assays with GST-c-Jun (1–79) as a substrate (Fig.4 A). Consistently, active forms of Rac1 and Cdc42 did not further stimulate the activity of HA-JNKK2-JNK1 (Fig. 4 B, lanes 4 and5), nor did EGF or TNF-α (Fig. 4 B, lanes 6 and 7). The active form of MEKK1, anisomycin, and UV, on the other hand, slightly stimulated the JNKK2-JNK1 fusion protein (Fig. 4 B, lanes 3, 8, and 9). These results suggest that the JNKK2-JNK1 fusion protein is likely a constitutively active Jun kinase. JNKK2 is a highly specific JNK activator that does not activate p38 or ERK2 (8Tournier C.

To ensure that the JNKK2-JNK1 fusion protein still maintained this high specificity, we determined its effect on the activity of JNK1, p38, and ERK2. In HeLa cells, coexpression of HA-JNKK2-JNK1, but not HA-JNKK2(K149M)-JNK1, stimulated M2-JNK1 activity significantly (Fig.5, lanes 3 and 4). Under the same conditions, the H"

We have previously shown that mouse Sertoli cells respond to TNF-α by increasing interleukin-6 production and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression (1Riccioli A. Filippini A. De Cesaris P. Barbacci E. Stefanini M. Starace G. Ziparo E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5808-5812Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In this cell type TNF-α activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways p42/p44 MAPK, JNK/SAPK, and p38, the last of which is responsible for interleukin-6 production (2De Cesaris P. Starace D. Riccioli A. Padula F. Filippini A. Ziparo E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7566-7571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To determine which MAPK signaling pathway is required for TNF-α induction of ICAM-1 expression, we have utilized the protein kinase inhibitor dimethylaminopurine, demonstrating that treatment of Sertoli cells with such compound significantly reduced ICAM-1 expression and JNK/SAPK activation. Moreover, dimethylaminopurine treatment increased the expression of MAPK phosphatase-2, providing a possible mechanism of action of this compound. By using agonist antibodies to p55 and to p75 TNF-α receptors and both human and mouse TNF-α, we demonstrate that both TNF receptors are expressed and that only the p55 receptor is involved in ICAM-1 expression. The p55 receptor activates all of the three pathways, whereas p75 failed to activate any of the MAPKs. Altogether our results demonstrate that TNF-α up-regulates ICAM-1 expression through the activation of the JNK/SAPK transduction pathway mediated by the p55 receptor. Tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) is a cytokine implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous chronic and acute inflammatory conditions. We have previously shown that mouse Sertoli cells respond to TNF-α by increasing interleukin-6 production and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression (1Riccioli A. Filippini A. De Cesaris P. Barbacci E. Stefanini M. Starace G. Ziparo E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5808-5812Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In this cell type TNF-α activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways p42/p44 MAPK, JNK/SAPK, and p38, the last of which is responsible for interleukin-6 production (2De Cesaris P. Starace D. Riccioli A. Padula F. Filippini A. Ziparo E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7566-7571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To determine which MAPK signaling pathway is required for TNF-α induction of ICAM-1 expression, we have utilized the protein kinase inhibitor dimethylaminopurine, demonstrating that treatment of Sertoli cells with such compound significantly reduced ICAM-1 expression and JNK/SAPK activation. Moreover, dimethylaminopurine treatment increased the expression of MAPK phosphatase-2, providing a possible mechanism of action of this compound. By using agonist antibodies to p55 and to p75 TNF-α receptors and both human and mouse TNF-α, we demonstrate that both TNF receptors are expressed and that only the p55 receptor is involved in ICAM-1 expression. The p55 receptor activates all of the three pathways, whereas p75 failed to activate any of the MAPKs. Altogether our results demonstrate that TNF-α up-regulates ICAM-1 expression through the activation of the JNK/SAPK transduction pathway mediated by the p55 receptor. tumor necrosis factor α intercellular adhesion molecule-1 vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 interleukin c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase/stress-activated protein kinase mitogen activated protein kinase dimethylaminopurine Mammalian cells respond to a broad variety of extracellular stimuli by activating protein kinase “cascades” that are involved in the amplification of the signal allowing a diverse array of cellular responses to take place.

The two receptors are coexpressed on the surface of most cell types. The receptors are activated by the clustering induced upon binding of their respective oligomeric ligands. Surface-associated p75 is postulated to enhance p55-dependent responses by recruiting TNF-α to the cell membrane and passing the ligand to p55 according to the ligand-passing model (20Tartaglia L.A. Pennica D. Goeddel D.V. J. Biol Chem. 1993; 268: 18542-18548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it has recently been demonstrated that ligand-passing is not the only mechanism for the enhancement of specific p55 responses by p75 but that partially overlapping intracellular signaling events are also triggered by both p55 and p75 (21Weiss T. Grell M. Hessabi B. Bourteele S. Muller G. Scheurich P. Wajant H. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2398-2404PubMed Google Scholar).The lack of an intrinsic kinase activity implies the interaction of TNF-R with accessory proteins that couple the receptor to signaling pathways. In mammalian cells three distinct and parallel so called mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades have been discovered: p42/p44 MAPKs (22Sturgill T.W. Wu J. Biochim. Biophys.

Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). The large number of these enzymes and their overlapping specificities in vitro has made it extremely difficult to identify the physiological roles and the substrates of individual members. This problem is particularly relevant in the case of MAPKs and JNK/SAPK because they are activated by the same extracellular agonists and because they all phosphorylate serine and threonine residues that are followed by proline (31Clark-Lewis I.

In the testis TNF-α is known to be produced by germ cells (round spermatids) (34De S.K. Chen H.L. Pace J.L. Hunt J.S. Terranova P.F. Enders G.C. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 389-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and to affect Sertoli cell activity (35Mauduit C. Jaspar J.M. Poncelet E. Charlet C. Revol A. Franchimont P. Benahmed M. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that cultured Sertoli cells treated with TNF-α increase surface expression of adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and VCAM-1) and IL-6 production (1Riccioli A. Filippini A. De Cesaris P. Barbacci E. Stefanini M. Starace G. Ziparo E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Starace D. Riccioli A. Padula F. Filippini A. Ziparo E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7566-7571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) that in mouse Sertoli cells TNF-α rapidly (within minutes) induces the phosphorylation and hence the activation of the p38 kinase and of activating transcription factor-2. Moreover, it activates the p42/p44 MAPK pathway, as demonstrated by the increased phosphorylation of its substrate Elk-1 and JNK/SAPK as revealed by the phosphorylation of c-Jun. These data indicate that TNF-α activates all of the three parallel MAPK cascades. By using small cell-permeant compounds SB203580 (24Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S.

We could in fact ascertain that, in Sertoli cells, the biological responses to TNF-α are subject to a dual control; the activation of p38 leads to IL-6 production, whereas neither p38 nor p42/p44 MAPKs regulate the induction of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 (2De Cesaris P.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7566-7571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).In this study, by using the protein kinase inhibitor dimethylaminopurine (DMAP) (39Schlegel R. Belinky J.S. Harris M.O. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 1: 171-178Google Scholar, 40Neant I. Guerrier P. Exp. Cell. Res. 1988; 176: 68-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), we present evidence that further dissects the signal transduction pathway of TNF-α leading to ICAM-1 induction on Sertoli cells. Recently DMAP was identified as an useful reagent for the characterization of TNF signaling in endothelial cells. In these cells, in fact, TNF activates JNK/SAPK and ceramide-activated protein kinases and augments Jun-b expression. DMAP abrogates or attenuates these events without affecting TNF binding, suggesting that its effects result from action at post receptor sites (41Marino M.W. Dunbar J.D. Wu L. Ngaiza J.R. Han H.

The ability of DMAP to affect signaling induced by TNF, but not by histamine, demonstrated that the effects of DMAP on the responses to TNF are specific (41Marino M.W. Dunbar J.D. Wu L. Ngaiza J.R. Han H. Guo D. Matsushita M. Nairn A. Zhang Y. Kolesnick R. Jaffe E.A. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28624-28629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Here, we report in mouse Sertoli cells that DMAP inhibits the TNF-α up-regulation of ICAM-1 and the activation of JNK/SAPK, thereby providing strong evidence for the essential role of the JNK/SAPK pathway in the induction of ICAM-1 by TNF-α in these cells.The DMAP pretreatment, followed by TNF-α exposure, significantly increased the expression of MKP-2, which is a dual specificity phosphatase that recognizes the homologous tripeptide phosphorylation sites required for activation of JNK/SAPK (42Denu J.M.

Finally we demonstrate that the effect of DMAP is specific because IFN-γ up-regulation of ICAM-1 is not affected by DMAP treatment.Furthermore, by using agonist antibodies to the p55 and to the p75 TNF-α receptors, we demonstrate the involvement of only the p55 receptor in ICAM-1 up-regulation. These results are in agreement with data previously described, indicating that p55 is the primary signaling receptor through which the majority of inflammatory responses classically ascribed to TNF-α occur (44Barbara J.A. Smith W.B. Gamble J.R. Van Ostade X. Vandenabeele P. Tavernier J. Fiers W. Vadas M.A. Lopez A.F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 45Rothe J. Lesslauer W.

Recent studies using molecular cloning with a yeast two-hybrid system have identified “adapter proteins” that associate with TNF receptors and are directly or indirectly involved in coupling receptors to different responses (16Vandenabeele P. Declercq W. Beyaert R. Fiers W. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 392-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 53Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V.

Specifically p55 receptor interacts with a protein called TNF receptor-associated death domain and with the receptor interacting protein, both receptors interacting with the TNF receptor-associated factor 1 and 2. The dissection of the different signal transduction pathways triggered by TNF-α is crucial to understand the regulation of the pleiotropic effects induced by this cytokine.We have previously demonstrated that TNF-α induces IL-6 production and ICAM-1 expression by distinct transduction pathways. We have in fact shown that brief exposure (10–30 min) of Sertoli cells to TNF-α activates the three MAPK families: p42/p44 MAPKs, JNK/SAPK, and p38. Moreover, the biological responses of Sertoli cells to TNF-α are under a dual control; the activation of p38 leads to IL-6 production, whereas neither p38 nor p42/p44 MAPKs regulate the induction of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 (2De Cesaris P. Starace D. Riccioli A. Padula F. Filippini A. Ziparo E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7566-7571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).In the present study we have further characterized the signaling of TNF-α in Sertoli cells by demonstrating the involvement of the JNK/SAPK cascade in the up-regulation of ICAM-1. Recently the protein kinase inhibitor DMAP has been identified as an useful reagent for the characterization of TNF-α signaling in endothelial cells where it has been demonstrated that the effects of DMAP on responses to TNF-α are specific (41Marino M.W. Dunbar J.D. Wu L. Ngaiza J.R. Han H. Guo D. Matsushita M. Nairn A. Zhang Y. Kolesnick R. Jaffe E.A. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28624-28629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). By using DMAP we have significantly reduced ICAM-1 induction by TNF-α but not ICAM-1 induction by IFN-γ. DMAP pretreatment completely abolished the TNF-α-induced phosphorylation of JNK/SAPK and of c-Jun, which is one of the targets of activated JNK/SAPK. DMAP treatment also negatively affected the phosphorylation of p38. However, the involvement of p38 in ICAM-1 induction can be ruled out because our previous results demonstrated that treatment with the p38-specific inhibitor SB203580 does not affect ICAM-1 expression (2De Cesaris P. Starace D. Riccioli A. Padula F. Filippini A. Ziparo E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7566-7571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Moreover, DMAP pretreatment increased the expression of the dual specificity phosphatase MKP-2. These data could indicate a mechanism by which DMAP inhibits TNF-α -induced JNK/SAPK phosphorylation. Because MKP-2 is constitutively expressed in unstimulated Sertoli cells, it could be hypothesized that DMAP interferes with the degrading pathway of MKP-2, thereby allowing the accumulation of the phosphatase that we in fact observe starting from 4 h with a peak at 24 h from the beginning of the treatment.TNF-α induces ICAM-1 up-regulation by activation of the p55 receptor. In fact by using the differential binding characteristics of human and mouse TNF-α to the mouse TNF receptors and by using agonist antibodies to the p55 and to the p75 receptors, we demonstrated the involvement of the p55 receptor in ICAM-1 induction. These data are in agreement with other groups (10Hou J. Baichwal V. Cao Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11641-11645Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 52Tartaglia L.A.

Pober J.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 1724-1730PubMed Google Scholar) showing that the majority of TNF-α effects are mediated by the p55 receptor.In conclusion we have defined a TNF-α signaling pathway involving the p55 receptor and JNK/SAPK leading to ICAM-1 induction. This is the first evidence of the involvement of the JNK/SAPK cascade in the modulation of the adhesion properties of a cell type under the control of the inflammatory cytokine TNF-α. An understanding of the signal transduction pathway triggered by inflammatory mediators may provide new targets for the modulation of the inflammatory process. In fact new antinflammatory therapies, based on the selective inhibition of a specific step among the multiple signaling transduction pathways activated by TNF-α could be designed to target the function of adhesion molecules in the extravasation process. Mammalian cells respond to a broad variety of extracellular stimuli by activating protein kinase “cascades” that are involved in the amplification of the signal allowing a diverse array of cellular responses to take place.

TNF-α initiates its pleiotropic action by binding to either of two receptors that do not contain an intrinsic protein kinase activity. The two receptors are coexpressed on the surface of most cell types. The receptors are activated by the clustering induced upon binding of their respective oligomeric ligands. Surface-associated p75 is postulated to enhance p55-dependent responses by recruiting TNF-α to the cell membrane and passing the ligand to p55 according to the ligand-passing model (20Tartaglia L.A. Pennica D. Goeddel D.V. J. Biol Chem. 1993; 268: 18542-18548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it has recently been demonstrated that ligand-passing is not the only mechanism for the enhancement of specific p55 responses by p75 but that partially overlapping intracellular signaling events are also triggered by both p55 and p75 (21Weiss T. Grell M. Hessabi B. Bourteele S. Muller G. Scheurich P. Wajant H. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2398-2404PubMed Google Scholar). The lack of an intrinsic kinase activity implies the interaction of TNF-R with accessory proteins that couple the receptor to signaling pathways. In mammalian cells three distinct and parallel so called mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades have been discovered: p42/p44 MAPKs (22Sturgill T.W. Wu J. Biochim. Biophys.

Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). The large number of these enzymes and their overlapping specificities in vitro has made it extremely difficult to identify the physiological roles and the substrates of individual members. This problem is particularly relevant in the case of MAPKs and JNK/SAPK because they are activated by the same extracellular agonists and because they all phosphorylate serine and threonine residues that are followed by proline (31Clark-Lewis I.

Sertoli cells, also known as “nurse cells” are responsible for the maintenance of the microenvironment in which postmeiotic development takes place and are the target for the hormones regulating spermatogenesis. In the testis TNF-α is known to be produced by germ cells (round spermatids) (34De S.K. Chen H.L. Pace J.L. Hunt J.S. Terranova P.F. Enders G.C. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 389-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and to affect Sertoli cell activity (35Mauduit C. Jaspar J.M. Poncelet E. Charlet C. Revol A. Franchimont P. Benahmed M. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that cultured Sertoli cells treated with TNF-α increase surface expression of adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and VCAM-1) and IL-6 production (1Riccioli A. Filippini A. De Cesaris P. Barbacci E. Stefanini M. Starace G. Ziparo E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5808-5812Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). More recently we have analyzed the intracellular signaling pathways that bring about these responses. We demonstrated (2De Cesaris P. Starace D. Riccioli A. Padula F. Filippini A. Ziparo E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7566-7571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) that in mouse Sertoli cells TNF-α rapidly (within minutes) induces the phosphorylation and hence the activation of the p38 kinase and of activating transcription factor-2. Moreover, it activates the p42/p44 MAPK pathway, as demonstrated by the increased phosphorylation of its substrate Elk-1 and JNK/SAPK as revealed by the phosphorylation of c-Jun. These data indicate that TNF-α activates all of the three parallel MAPK cascades. By using small cell-permeant compounds SB203580 (24Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S.

We could in fact ascertain that, in Sertoli cells, the biological responses to TNF-α are subject to a dual control; the activation of p38 leads to IL-6 production, whereas neither p38 nor p42/p44 MAPKs regulate the induction of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 (2De Cesaris P.

In this study, by using the protein kinase inhibitor dimethylaminopurine (DMAP) (39Schlegel R. Belinky J.S. Harris M.O. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 1: 171-178Google Scholar, 40Neant I. Guerrier P. Exp. Cell. Res. 1988; 176: 68-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), we present evidence that further dissects the signal transduction pathway of TNF-α leading to ICAM-1 induction on Sertoli cells. Recently DMAP was identified as an useful reagent for the characterization of TNF signaling in endothelial cells. In these cells, in fact, TNF activates JNK/SAPK and ceramide-activated protein kinases and augments Jun-b expression. DMAP abrogates or attenuates these events without affecting TNF binding, suggesting that its effects result from action at post receptor sites (41Marino M.W. Dunbar J.D. Wu L. Ngaiza J.R. Han H.

The ability of DMAP to affect signaling induced by TNF, but not by histamine, demonstrated that the effects of DMAP on the responses to TNF are specific (41Marino M.W. Dunbar J.D. Wu L. Ngaiza J.R. Han H. Guo D. Matsushita M. Nairn A. Zhang Y. Kolesnick R. Jaffe E.A. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28624-28629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Here, we report in mouse Sertoli cells that DMAP inhibits the TNF-α up-regulation of ICAM-1 and the activation of JNK/SAPK, thereby providing strong evidence for the essential role of the JNK/SAPK pathway in the induction of ICAM-1 by TNF-α in these cells. The DMAP pretreatment, followed by TNF-α exposure, significantly increased the expression of MKP-2, which is a dual specificity phosphatase that recognizes the homologous tripeptide phosphorylation sites required for activation of JNK/SAPK (42Denu J.M.

Biol Chem. 1997; 272: 4568-4575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Finally we demonstrate that the effect of DMAP is specific because IFN-γ up-regulation of ICAM-1 is not affected by DMAP treatment. Furthermore, by using agonist antibodies to the p55 and to the p75 TNF-α receptors, we demonstrate the involvement of only the p55 receptor in ICAM-1 up-regulation. These results are in agreement with data previously described, indicating that p55 is the primary signaling receptor through which the majority of inflammatory responses classically ascribed to TNF-α occur (44Barbara J.A. Smith W.B. Gamble J.R. Van Ostade X. Vandenabeele P. Tavernier J. Fiers W. Vadas M.A. Lopez A.F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 45Rothe J. Lesslauer W.

DISCUSSIONDelineating the molecular events underlying the signal transduction pathways that link TNF-α receptors to down stream gene activation has become a major focus for research efforts in the biology of TNF-α. Recent studies using molecular cloning with a yeast two-hybrid system have identified “adapter proteins” that associate with TNF receptors and are directly or indirectly involved in coupling receptors to different responses (16Vandenabeele P. Declercq W. Beyaert R. Fiers W. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 392-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 53Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V.

Specifically p55 receptor interacts with a protein called TNF receptor-associated death domain and with the receptor interacting protein, both receptors interacting with the TNF receptor-associated factor 1 and 2. The dissection of the different signal transduction pathways triggered by TNF-α is crucial to understand the regulation of the pleiotropic effects induced by this cytokine.We have previously demonstrated that TNF-α induces IL-6 production and ICAM-1 expression by distinct transduction pathways. We have in fact shown that brief exposure (10–30 min) of Sertoli cells to TNF-α activates the three MAPK families: p42/p44 MAPKs, JNK/SAPK, and p38. Moreover, the biological responses of Sertoli cells to TNF-α are under a dual control; the activation of p38 leads to IL-6 production, whereas neither p38 nor p42/p44 MAPKs regulate the induction of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 (2De Cesaris P.

Recently the protein kinase inhibitor DMAP has been identified as an useful reagent for the characterization of TNF-α signaling in endothelial cells where it has been demonstrated that the effects of DMAP on responses to TNF-α are specific (41Marino M.W.

By using DMAP we have significantly reduced ICAM-1 induction by TNF-α but not ICAM-1 induction by IFN-γ. DMAP pretreatment completely abolished the TNF-α-induced phosphorylation of JNK/SAPK and of c-Jun, which is one of the targets of activated JNK/SAPK. DMAP treatment also negatively affected the phosphorylation of p38. However, the involvement of p38 in ICAM-1 induction can be ruled out because our previous results demonstrated that treatment with the p38-specific inhibitor SB203580 does not affect ICAM-1 expression (2De Cesaris P.

Moreover, DMAP pretreatment increased the expression of the dual specificity phosphatase MKP-2. These data could indicate a mechanism by which DMAP inhibits TNF-α -induced JNK/SAPK phosphorylation. Because MKP-2 is constitutively expressed in unstimulated Sertoli cells, it could be hypothesized that DMAP interferes with the degrading pathway of MKP-2, thereby allowing the accumulation of the phosphatase that we in fact observe starting from 4 h with a peak at 24 h from the beginning of the treatment.TNF-α induces ICAM-1 up-regulation by activation of the p55 receptor. In fact by using the differential binding characteristics of human and mouse TNF-α to the mouse TNF receptors and by using agonist antibodies to the p55 and to the p75 receptors, we demonstrated the involvement of the p55 receptor in ICAM-1 induction. These data are in agreement with other groups (10Hou J. Baichwal V. Cao Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11641-11645Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 52Tartaglia L.A.

This is the first evidence of the involvement of the JNK/SAPK cascade in the modulation of the adhesion properties of a cell type under the control of the inflammatory cytokine TNF-α. An understanding of the signal transduction pathway triggered by inflammatory mediators may provide new targets for the modulation of the inflammatory process. In fact new antinflammatory therapies, based on the selective inhibition of a specific step among the multiple signaling transduction pathways activated by TNF-α could be designed to target the function of adhesion molecules in the extravasation process.

The Rho proteins are molecular switches in intracellular signaling. In the GDP-bound form they are switched off, and in the GTP-bound form they are switched on. The on-off state is tightly governed by regulatory proteins. The activation is catalyzed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs),1 which promote the exchange with GTP. In the active GTP state, the Rho protein couples to effector proteins, e.g. Ser/Thr kinases such as Rho kinase or PAK for downstream signaling. The active state is terminated by the GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which supply an arginine finger to increase the GTPase activity, resulting in the formation of inactive GDP-bound Rho (10Rittinger K. Walker P.A. Eccleston J.F. Smerdon S.J. Gamblin S.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The cycling between the two nucleotide-bound states is accompanied by cycling between the cytosolic fraction and the membranes (11Adamson P. Paterson H.F. Hall A. J.

The guanidine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) are involved in this subcellular cycling. GDIs are unique for the Rho and Rab subfamilies but not found in the other subfamilies of the Ras superfamily. The GDIs bind to posttranslationally modified (isoprenylated) Rho proteins, keep them in the GDP-bound form in the cytosolic fraction, and inhibit nucleotide exchange (5Van Aelst L.

There are several reports that phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) liberates Rho from the GDI complex but the physiological significance of this finding is still unclear (27Bourmeyster N.

Chem. 1993; 268: 26206-26211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the ezrin, moesin, and radixin (ERM) proteins have been reported to release Rho from the GDI complex. The ERM proteins are composed of a N-terminal membrane anchorage domain (binding to CD44 or ICAM) and a C-terminal F-actin binding domain allowing them to link the cytoskeleton to the membrane (29Bretscher A. Reczek D. Berryman M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 3011-3018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Tsukita S. Oishi K. Sato N. Sagara J. Kawai A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). The ERMs are inactive in the cytosol through head to tail interaction (31Tsukita S. Yonemura S. Trends Biochem Sci. 1997; 22: 53-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). A so far unidentified signal induces opening of the ERMs allowing the N-terminal part to bind to GDI-1. ERM-GDI interaction results in the release of Rho, which subsequently interacts with the cognate GEF to be activated for downstream signaling (15Takaishi K. Sasaki T. Kameyama T. Tsukita S. Takai Y.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). GDI-1 is exclusively localized in the cytosol and interacts with Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 (12Isomura M. Kikuchi A. Ohga N. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 119-124PubMed Google Scholar, 18Fukumoto Y. Kaibuchi K. Hori Y. Fujioka H. Araki S. Ueda T. Kikuchi A. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1321-1328PubMed Google Scholar). Ly-GDI (D4-GDI) exhibits the same properties but is preferentially expressed in hematopoietic cell lines (34Scherle P. Behrens T. Staudt L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7568-7572Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In addition to the cytosolic GDIs, GDIγ and GDI-3 are membrane-bound through a N-terminal extension. The latter GDIs are expressed in a more tissue-specific manner, and they show more selective interaction with Rho subfamily proteins (21Zalcman G. Closson V. Camonis J. Honoré N.

The Rho subfamily proteins are cellular targets of various bacterial toxins to be covalently modified. CNF1 catalyzes deamidation of glutamine 63 of Rho to generate constitutively active GTPase (35Flatau G. Lemichez E. Gauthier M. Chardin P. Paris S. Fiorentini C. Boquet P.

FEBS Lett. 1989; 243: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).Clostridium difficile toxins A and B, which are cytotoxins to cause disaggregation of the actin filament system, catalyze monoglucosylation of Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, thereby inactivating the GTPases (39Just I.

Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13932-13936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The modification occurs at threonine 37 (Rho) and threonine 35 (Rac, Cdc42), which is located in the effector loop. Glucosylation does not significantly alter binding of GDP and GTP but decreases the intrinsic GTPase activity by a factor of 5 and completely blocks the GAP-stimulated GTPase activity. Binding to the effector protein (PKN) for downstream signaling is completely inhibited (41Sehr P. Joseph G. Genth H. Just I. Pick E. Aktories K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5296-5304Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Blockade of effector coupling fully explains how glucosylation renders Rho inactive. However, it does not explain the dominant negative activity of glucosylated Rho when microinjected into cell monolayers (39Just I. Selzer J. Wilm M. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1995; 375: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). Therefore, we studied the subcellular localization of glucosylated Rho and its interaction with the regulatory protein GDI-1. RhoA and Rac1 were expressed inSpodoptera frugiperda cells (Sf9 cells) and purified from a Triton X-100-soluble fraction of cells as glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein. GDI-1 was purified as glutathione S-transferase fusion protein fromEscherichia coli. The glutathione fusion proteins were isolated by affinity purification with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The glutathione S-transferase carrier was cleaved from RhoA, Rac1, and GDI-1 by thrombin (100 μg/ml for 30 min at 22 °C). Thrombin was removed by precipitation with benzamidine-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). C. difficile toxin B (42Just I. Selzer J. Hofmann F. Aktories K. Aktories K.

Immun. 1987; 55: 1461-1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the chimeric C3 toxin (ADP-ribosyltransferase C3 is fused to the catalytically deficient C. botulinum C2 toxin) (44Barth H. Hofmann F. Olenik C. Just I. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1364-1369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were purified as described. UDP-[14C]glucose was purchased from Bio Trend (Cologne, Germany). NIH3T3 fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 4 mmglutamine/penicillin/streptomycin. Cell cultures of 10-cm dishes were treated with C. difficile toxin B (0.1 μg/ml),C. botulinum C2 toxin (400 ng/ml C2II plus 200 ng/ml C2I) or the chimeric C3 toxin (400 ng/ml C2II plus 200 ng/ml C2I-C3) for different times as noted in the legends. The cells were rinsed with 5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped off in 300 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 40 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 80 μg/ml benzamidine) per dish. The cells were disrupted mechanically by sonification (five times on ice), followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 1,000 × g to remove the nuclear fraction and intact cells. The supernatant (1 mg/ml protein) was used as cell lysate. Lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to prepare cytosolic and total particulate fractions. The high speed pellet, which consists of the heavy and the light membrane fractions, was washed with lysis buffer and resuspended in the original volume of lysis buffer. Lysates from NIH3T3 fibroblasts (1 mg/ml) were subjected to ADP-ribosylation by C3 toxin (0.1 μg/ml) in the presence of 10 μm NAD and 10 mmthymidine for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was determined by addition of Laemmli sample buffer. Lysates from NIH3T3 fibroblasts (1 mg/ml) were incubated with toxin B (1 μg/ml) in the presence of 30 μm UDP-[14C]glucose and 1 mmMnCl2 at 37 °C for 1 h. Recombinant RhoA (2 μg) dissolved in glucosylation buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 0.2 mm GDP, 1 mm dithiothreitol) was incubated with toxin B (1 μg/ml) and UDP-[14C]glucose (30 μm) at 37 °C for 30 min. Cytosols from NIH3T3 fibroblasts (0.8 mg/ml) were incubated with 0.2 mg/ml PIP2or 50 μg/ml GDI-1 at 37 °C for 30 min followed by the [14C]glucosylation reaction. The reaction was determined by addition of Laemmli sample buffer. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed with 12.5% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were analyzed by PhosphorImager SI from Molecular Dynamics. Proteins were separated on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose for 2 h at 250 mA, followed by blocking with 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk for 1 h. Blots were incubated for 2 h with the appropriate primary antibody (diluted 1:3.000) in buffer B (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.05% (w/v) Tween 20) and then for 45 min with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Isoprenylated RhoA and Rac1 were incubated in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2) in the presence of 100 μm GTPγS or 100 μm GDP on ice for 1 h. 100 μl of reaction mixture were layered onto 200 μl of sucrose (20% (w/v) sucrose supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide) using microcentrifugation tips and centrifuged at 4 °C (1 h at 30,000 × g). The supernatant was precipitated and resolved in 30 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. The pellet was dissolved in the same volume of sample buffer. RhoA was [14C]glucosylated and loaded with GTPγS as described above. Complete glucosylation was checked by [32P]ADP-ribosylation (data not shown). All steps were carried out at 4 °C. Washed NIH3T3 membranes (0.35 mg/ml) were incubated in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 μm GTPγS, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with [14C]glucosylated RhoA as indicated for 30 min on ice. The mixture was fractionated by sucrose density centrifugation (as described above), and the pellet was counted for radioactivity. The amount found in the tips in the absence of membranes was set blank (about 0.1%). RhoA (200 μg/ml) was glucosylated in the presence of 100 μm non-radioactive UDP-glucose as described above, followed by nucleotide exchange with 100 μm GDP or GTPγS on ice for 1 h. Complete glucosylation was checked by [32P]ADP-ribosylation (data not shown). After transfer of NIH3T3 membranes, the nitrocellulose was blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk, followed by renaturation of proteins in buffer B overnight at 4 °C. Binding was performed at 24 °C for 2 h with 2 μg/ml glucosylated or unmodified RhoA (loaded either with GTPγS or GDP) dissolved in buffer B supplemented with 2.5 mm MgCl2. After washing four times with buffer B for 10 min, the membranes were probed for RhoA as described above. Cytosol was prepared as described above. 0.5 mg of protein dissolved in 500 μl of separation buffer was loaded onto a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) previously equilibrated with separation buffer (10 mm imidazole, pH 6.8, 400 mm NaCl, 250 mm sucrose). The flow rate was 0.2 ml/min, and the fraction size was 500 μl. The fractions were precipitated with chloroform/methanol and resolved in 30 μl of Laemmli buffer. Fractions were analyzed by immunoblot for RhoA. Calibration of the column was performed with bovine serum albumin (66 kDa, fractions 4 and 5), chicken albumin (45 kDa, fractions 7 and 8), and chymotrypsin (25 kDa, fractions 10 and 11). Cytosols (250 μg of protein dissolved in 500 μl of separation buffer) were applied onto a 30-kDa cut-off membrane (Microcon 30, Amicon, Beverly, MA) at 7,000 ×g for 30 min at room temperature. Supernatant and filtrate were brought to the same protein concentration, followed by immunoblot analysis. The majority of RhoA (>90%) was localized in the cytosolic fraction when lysates from NIH3T3 cells were fractionated by ultracentrifugation (Fig. 1 A). After treatment of NIH3T3 cells with toxin B, the subcellular distribution changed and about 50% of RhoA was localized to the membranous fraction (Fig. 1 A). To exclude that this redistribution was merely based on disaggregation of the actin cytoskeleton, C. botulinum C2 toxin was applied which directly ADP-ribosylates monomeric actin thereby turning it incapable of polymerization. As shown in Fig. 1 A, disruption of the actin filaments did not induce translocation of Rho to the membranes. Furthermore, neither toxin B nor C2 toxin treatment of the cells led to a change in GDI-1 localization (Fig. 1 A). To prove whether translocation of Rho to the membranes was due to the bound glucose moiety, membrane binding of Rho ADP-ribosylated by C3 toxin was studied. In contrast to toxin B, C3 selectively modifies Rho but not Rac and Cdc42. ADP-ribosylated Rho was found in the cytosol (Fig.1 A) but not at the membranes, indicating that redistribution of Rho was based on the glucose moiety and not on mere changes in structure by posttranslational modification. The translocation to the membranes was a time-dependent process proceeding with the increase in Rho glucosylation (Fig.1 B). Glucosylation induced a shift of the majority of Rho to the membranes, but a fraction (about 40%) remained in the cytosol. Under these conditions, all cellular Rho was glucosylated in vivo as was shown by a second [14C]glucosylation of the lysates (Fig. 1 C). That only a fraction of the completely glucosylated cellular Rho bound to the membranes may be an indication for limited binding capacity of the membranes. The effect of glucosylation on the translocation of Rho was not only observed in intact cells; but also when Rho was glucosylated in cell lysates (Fig.2 A). The failure of ADP-ribosylated Rho to bind to membranes was also found in the in vitro system. This finding indicated that the machinery of the intact cell was not needed for translocation but merely the modification with glucose. To prove this hypothesis binding of [14C]glucosylated RhoA in the GTPγS form to membranes from NIH3T3 cells freed from endogenous Rho was performed. Bound Rho was separated from non-bound by sucrose density centrifugation. Fig. 2 B shows that glucosylated RhoA-GTPγS bound in a saturable manner to the membranes. Maximal binding was about 2.5 μg of Rho/mg of membranes. Binding of glucosylated RhoA was competed by unmodified RhoA-GTPγS (Fig.2 C) but not by RhoA-GDP (data not shown), suggesting comparable affinities to the membrane binding site. Glucosylated Rho bound to GDP also showed binding but less compared with the GTPγS bound Fig. 2 D. Saturable binding of glucosylated and unmodified Rho indicated that the binding was not merely mediated through lipid-lipid interaction by the geranyl-geranyl moiety but rather through a protein-protein interaction. To obtain more information on the binding site, we performed an overlay assay. Membranous fractions from NIH3T3 cells were electroblotted and then overlaid with unmodified and glucosylated RhoA either bound to GDP or GTPγS. Bound RhoA was detected with anti-RhoA. Fig. 2 D shows that unmodified RhoA bound when loaded with GTPγS, whereas in the GDP-bound form there was only a very faint binding. The membrane protein to which RhoA bound exhibited an apparent molecular mass of about 70 kDa (p70). Glucosylated RhoA bound to the same protein; however, it bound in an almost nucleotide-independent manner. Addition of RhoA-GTPγS to the overlay with glucosylated RhoA-GTPγS clearly decreased the binding of glucosylated RhoA (data not shown), corroborating the results of binding to native membranes and indicating competition at the same binding site. The majority of Rho is localized in the cytosol, and this cytosolic Rho is not monomeric but bound to GDI-1 in a high affinity complex. The cytosolic Rho-GDI complex is reported to be cleaved by PIP2 (27Bourmeyster N. Stasia M.-J. Garin J. Gagnon J. Boquet P. Vignais P.V. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12863-12869Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 28Chuang T.-H. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26206-26211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of intact cells as well as cell lysates with toxin B resulted in complete glucosylation of cellular Rho (Fig. 1 C). This observation implicated that also Rho from the GDI complex was modified. Therefore, we tested the influence of GDI-1 on the glucosylation of Rho. Toxin B-catalyzed glucosylation of Rho/Rac/Cdc42 from cytosolic fractions was increased after addition of PIP2; conversely, addition of recombinant GDI-1 to the cytosol completely abolished glucosylation, an effect that was completely reversed by PIP2 (Fig. 3 A). These data indicated that the Rho GTPases complexed with GDI-1 were not substrates for toxin B. To test this assumption directly, we studied glucosylation with recombinant proteins, using isoprenylated RhoA and Rac1 from Sf9 cells because only isoprenylated Rho is capable of binding to GDI-1. RhoA as well as Rac1 bound to GDI-1 were not glucosylated by toxin B. However, addition of PIP2turned RhoA and Rac1, respectively, glucosylatable (Fig.3 B). To exclude that PIP2 had no direct stimulating effect on the enzyme reaction, increasing concentrations of PIP2 were added to the glucosylation reaction of RhoA. As shown in Fig. 3 C, the phosphoinositide did not change the glucosylation of recombinant RhoA, indicating that the effect of PIP2 on the glucosylation of cellular Rho/Rac/Cdc42 was indeed due to the cleavage of the Rho-GDI complex. The finding that cellular Rho was completely glucosylated in intact cells and cell lysates was apparently inconsistent with the observation that the Rho-GDI complex was resistant to glucosylation. To solve this contradiction, we tested whether membranes contained factors that released Rho from the GDI complex. To this end cytosolic fractions were incubated with increasing concentrations of membranes, followed by toxin B-catalyzed glucosylation (Fig. 3 D). The very low glucosylation rate in the cytosol was enhanced by membranes that stimulated glucosylation comparable to the addition of PIP2. Thus, membranes contained a factor or factors that make Rho available for glucosylation. PIP2 or the ERM proteins both have been reported to be releasing factors for Rho (8Sasaki T. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar,32Takahashi K. Sasaki T. Mammoto A. Takaishi K. Kameyama T. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23371-23375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). In intact cells and also in cell lysates, Rho cycles between the GDI-bound and the membrane-bound form; the intermediary free,i.e. monomeric Rho, became substrate for glucosylation. To test whether glucosylated RhoA was capable of binding to GDI-1, coprecipitation experiments with GST-GDI-1 immobilized to Sepharose were performed. As shown in Fig. 3 E, RhoA-GDP binding to GDI-1 was superior to binding of RhoA-GTPγS corroborating reported data (25Sasaki T. Kato M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23959-23963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glucosylated RhoA, however, showed no binding to GDI-1 independently of the nucleotide bound. The same results were found for Rac1 with the exception that also Rac1-GTPγS bound to GDI-1. Thus, glucosylation inhibited binding to GDI-1 or significantly decreases the affinity to GDI-1. From the finding that glucosylation prevented binding to GDI-1, it can be deduced that glucosylated Rho, in contrast to nonmodified Rho, should be monomeric in the cytosol from toxin B-treated cells. Indeed, gel permeation chromatography of cytosol prepared from control and toxin B-treated cells revealed that Rho from control cells was eluted with an apparent molecular mass of about 50 kDa (22 kDa of Rho plus 23 kDa of GDI-1) and that glucosylated Rho was eluted with a mass of 22 kDa consistent with the monomeric property of modified Rho (Fig. 4 A). The same results were obtained when monomeric Rho was separated from the Rho-GDI complex by filtration through a membrane filter with a 30 kDa cut-off (Fig. 4 B). One property of GDI-1 is to extract Rho bound to membranes. Because glucosylated Rho lost its property to bind to GDI-1, GDI-1 should not be able to extract modified RhoA from membranes. Membranes from control and toxin B-intoxicated cells were loaded with GDP, followed by extraction with GDI-1 or buffer as control. Thereafter, the membranes were separated from the soluble fraction by sucrose density centrifugation, and Rho was detected by immunoblot. GDI-1 completely extracted unmodified Rho from the membranes but was incapable of releasing glucosylated Rho (Fig.5). Thus, glucosylation of Rho led to trapping of modified Rho at the Rho binding site of the membranes. The Rho subfamily proteins Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 are monoglucosylated at effector domain amino acid threonine 37 (Rho) and threonine 35 (Rac/Cdc42) by C. difficile toxins A and B. The glucose moiety located at switch I loop of Rho alters the GTPase cycle: Activation of Rho by GEFs is reduced but not completely inhibited when the properties of glucosylated Ras are transferred to that of glucosylated Rho (45Herrmann C. Ahmadian M.R. Hofmann F. Just I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16134-16139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The intrinsic GTPase activity of Rho is reduced but the GAP-stimulated activity is completely inhibited (41Sehr P. Joseph G. Genth H. Just I. Pick E. Aktories K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5296-5304Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The pivotal step for signaling, the effector coupling, is completely blocked (41Sehr P. Joseph G. Genth H. Just I. Pick E. Aktories K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5296-5304Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). From these biochemical data, it can be concluded that glucosylated Rho should be trapped in the GTP-bound state but is incapable of downstream signaling. In contrast to the Ras subfamily, the Rho subfamily proteins are additionally regulated by GDIs, which keep the Rho proteins in the GDP-bound form. The high affinity Rho-GDI complex reflects the cytosolic pool of inactive Rho. Furthermore, GDI-1 extracts membrane-bound Rho and delivers it to the cytosolic pool. Thus, GDI-1 is the key player of the cytosol-membrane cycling, which in conjunction with GTP binding is important for downstream signaling (8Sasaki T. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar,46Bokoch G.M. Der C.J. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 750-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). GDI-1 consists of a well structured C-terminal part with a pocket to bind the isoprenyl moiety of the Rho proteins (47Keep N.H. Barnes M. Barsukov I. Badii R. Lian L.Y. Segal A.W. Moody P.C.E. Roberts G.C.K. Structure. 1997; 5: 623-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The N-terminal part is very flexible and is proposed to interact with the effector loop of the Rho proteins (47Keep N.H. Barnes M. Barsukov I. Badii R. Lian L.Y. Segal A.W. Moody P.C.E. Roberts G.C.K. Structure. 1997; 5: 623-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Rho in the GDI-1 complex is not substrate for toxin B. This may be due to the inaccessibility of the toxin recognition site on the Rho surface and/or the inaccessibility of the acceptor amino acid threonine 37. The fact that glucosylated Rho does not form a complex with GDI-1 strongly argues for the proposed interaction of GDI-1 with the effector loop of Rho GTPases. In intact cells and cell lysates, cellular Rho is completely glucosylated and no unmodified is left. This finding is surprising because the majority of Rho is bound in the GDI-1 complex in which Rho is not substrate for the toxins. The Rho-GDI complex, the recombinant or cytosolic one, is cleaved by PIP2. Whether PIP2 is the physiological release factor is unclear but PIP2 is involved in the displacement of Rho from the GDI complex by the ERM proteins (48Hirao M. Sato N. Kondo T. Yonemura S. Monden M. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). These proteins mediate the membrane association of the actin filaments (30Tsukita S. Oishi K. Sato N. Sagara J. Kawai A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 31Tsukita S. Yonemura S.

Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 187-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), and they displace Rho from the Rho-GDI complex initiating the activation of Rho (32Takahashi K.

We showed that membranes contain displacement activity to release Rho from the GDI complex; released, monomeric Rho is then glucosylated by toxin B. This finding explains why the complete quantity of cellular Rho is glucosylated in intact cells as well as in lysates. The incapability of glucosylated Rho to bind to GDI-1, shown by gel filtration of intoxicated cytosol as well as by coprecipitation assay using recombinant Rho and GDI-1, has a functional implication. It is generally accepted that Rho is translocated to the membranes during the activation process and that inactive Rho is extracted by GDI-1 to allow new Rho to translocate. Glucosylated Rho accumulates at the membranes for two reasons. (i) Rho is kept in the GTP-bound form. (ii) Rho cannot be extracted by GDI-1 thereby inhibiting the translocation of unmodified Rho to the membrane. The inhibition of the cytosol-membrane cycling of Rho contributes to its functional inactivation. It is very surprising that Rho with a glucose moiety at threonine 37 shows increased binding to the membranes. The binding of glucosylated Rho to membranes is saturable and competable by unmodified Rho, as shown in the membrane binding assay. The subfractionation experiments showed that the majority of cellular Rho but not the complete amount of glucosylated Rho translocated to the membranes. This finding also argues for the existence of limited binding sites at the cytosolic face of the membranes. These binding sites may be also shared with Rac, an additional reason for the partial membrane binding of glucosylated Rho. Furthermore, the binding takes place at a membrane protein with a molecular mass of 70 kDa as shown in the overlay experiments. The binding to p70 is also competed by unmodified Rho. Finally, the native structure of glucosylated Rho is essential because denaturation by removal of the Mg2+ ion completely abolishes membrane interaction. These data argue for a specific binding to a membrane protein, which is mediated rather by a protein-protein interaction than by a nonspecific lipid-lipid interaction through the isoprenyl moiety. Glucosylated Rho is unresponsive to GAP and should therefore be trapped in the GTP-bound form, and GTP-bound glucosylated Rho should bind to membranes as unmodified does. However, the experimental data,i.e. the membrane binding and the overlay assay, clearly show that the binding of modified Rho is almost independent of the nucleotide-bound state. Thus, it is conceivable that glucosylated Rho does bind through a mechanism involving the glucose moiety to p70, a mechanism that is different from the binding of unmodified Rho. Because recombinant glucosylated RhoA in its native form binds to p70, the glucose seems to change properties of RhoA. A direct involvement of the glucose moiety at threonine 37 in binding is very unlikely. The effector loop seems not to be involved in membrane binding because membrane-bound Rho interacts with its effector proteins without being released from the membranes. The membranous p70 is not a selective binding site for toxin-modified Rho. Normal cellular Rho in its GTP-bound form also binds to p70. However, p70 seems to be not an effector protein for Rho because glucosylated Rho does bind. Recently, saturable high affinity binding of GTP-bound Rho to membrane preparations from erythrocytes has been reported (50Boukharov A.A. Cohen C.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1391-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that the reported saturable binding is mediated through p70. p70 may be a membranous platform that binds Rho GTPases and displays them to effector or GAP proteins for interaction. Alternatively, p70 may be a multifunctional adapter protein. The acceptor amino acid of glucosylation, threonine 37, resides in the effector domain. However, it becomes more and more clear that there are several domains that participate in the communication with the effector proteins. Recently, it has been reported that Rho possesses accessory domains that determine the effector specificity of Rho (51Fujisawa K. Madaule P. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Bito H. Saito Y. Hall A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 4551-4560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). One class (citron) solely interacts with the classical effector domain covering amino acids 23–40, whereas the class of ROCK (Rho-associated coiled-coiled-containing protein kinase) and the class of rhophilin bind to two distinct regions, amino acids 23–40 (switch I) and amino acids 75–92. Switch I seems to be indispensable for Rho effector coupling, and therefore glucosylation at Thr-37 blocks communication with every Rho effector. Based on the data of the present study, we present a refined model on the functional consequences of glucosylation of the Rho GTPases byC. difficile toxins A and B (Fig.6). Glucosylation at threonine 37/35 slows down activation by GEFs but completely inhibits downstream signaling of GTP-bound Rho. Glucosylated Rho binds to a membranous binding site but cannot be released from the membranes by GDI-1 as unmodified Rho is, because of failure to interact with GAP and to bind to GDI-1. Glucosylated Rho then accumulates at the membranes and prevents translocation of unmodified Rho to the membranes for signaling. Thus, glucosylation results in two functional consequences, inhibition of effector coupling and of the cycling of the Rho GTPases from cytosol to membranes and vice versa. The inhibition of the subcellular cycling may explain why glucosylated Rho is dominant negative in intact cells (39Just I. Selzer J. Wilm M. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1995; 375: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). Glucosylated Rho occupies the membrane binding sites and inhibits membrane translocation of unmodified cellular Rho.

Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar), whereas substrates to be exported from the nucleus harbor nuclear export signals (NESs) (2Gerace L.

Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 290-293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The signals are recognized by soluble, mobile transporters that mediate transport through the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) embedded in the nuclear envelope (4Görlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar, 5Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). These transporters are collectively termed karyopherins (kaps), but specific members of the family have different names (see below). The first kaps to be identified were shown to be responsible for importing basic (1Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem.

In this case, the cNLS is recognized in the cytoplasm by a heterodimer of kap α (6Radu A. Blobel G. Moore M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It is proposed that a series of docking and release steps facilitates movement of the β/α/NLS-cargo from the cytoplasmic filaments through the NPC (13Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Other macromolecules transported through the NPC follow a similar fate but are specifically recognized by different kap family members. TheSaccharomyces cerevisiae genome sequence suggests that the yeast kap family may contain as many as 14 members, identified by their predicted primary structural similarity to yeast kap β, Kap95p (5Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar,14Wozniak R.W. Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D.

The first kap β-related proteins shown to be transport factors were a mammalian protein termed karyopherin β2 or transportin (kap β2/Trn) (16Pollard V.W. Michael W.M. Nakielny S. Siomi M.C. Wang F.

Science. 1996; 274: 624-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Both proteins import mRNA-binding proteins into the nucleus. Kap β2/Trn recognizes a 38-amino acid residue sequence termed M9 within hnRNP A1 and mediates its nuclear import (16Pollard V.W. Michael W.M. Nakielny S. Siomi M.C. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1996; 86: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Similarly, Kap104p transports the nuclear RNA-binding proteins Nab2p and Nab4p/Hrp1p (18Aitchison J.D. Blobel G. Rout M.P. Science. 1996; 274: 624-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Nab4p/Hrp1p is the yeast protein most similar in sequence to mammalian hnRNP A1 (19Henry M. Borland C.Z. Bossie M. Silver P.A. Genetics. 1996; 142: 103-115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the kaps, the small GTPase Ran and its interacting protein, p10/NTF2, play a critical role in providing directionality to the import and export processes (20Moore M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22857-22860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 21Cole C.N. Hammell C.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R368-R372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the nucleus, Ran is believed to be maintained in its GTP-bound state by the nuclear-restricted GTP exchange factor RCC1 (22Seki T. Hayashi N. Nishimoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In contrast, the localization of the Ran GTPase-activating protein to the cytoplasm and the cytoplasmic filaments of the NPC (23Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F. Cell. 1997; 88: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar, 24Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar) is thought to ensure that cytoplasmic Ran is maintained in its GDP-bound form. This separation of the two pools of Ran is thought to play a role in vectorial transport across the NPC, acting as a molecular switch in the binding and release steps that occur during transport through the NPC (4Görlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar, 20Moore M.S. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 8: R368-R372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the formation of an import complex containing kaps β/α and the cNLS is stable in the presence of Ran-GDP, but Ran-GTP triggers its disassembly (13Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 25Percipalle P. Clarkson W.D. Kent H.M. Rhodes D. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 722-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In contrast, the formation of an export complex, for example, between an NES-containing protein and its export factor, Crm1/Exportin 1, is stabilized by Ran-GTP in a trimeric complex (26Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar). Presumably, as this complex reaches the cytoplasm and GTP hydrolysis on Ran is catalyzed by Ran-GTPase-activating protein, the complex disassembles. This mechanism is thought to ensure that cargoes are loaded and released from their appropriate carriers in the correct locations. Exactly how energy is utilized to drive translocation is not clearly understood, but because GTP hydrolysis on Ran is not required for (at least) a single round of either import or export (27Ribbeck K. Kutay U. Paraskeva E. Görlich D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 47-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 28Richards S.A. Carey K.L. Macara I.G.

Although the mechanisms of mRNA export are yet to be elucidated, it is likely that proteins bound to the mRNA act as adaptors for export factors. The human immunodeficiency virus protein, Rev is an excellent example of such an adaptor. It binds specifically to incompletely spliced viral transcripts (31Chang D.D. Sharp P.A.

We provide evidence for a simple cycle in which, upon import, the Nabs are released from Kap104p by the concerted action of Ran-GTP and newly transcribed RNA. We suggest the Nabs are then exported with the mRNA, at which point, Kap104p rebinds to RNA-binding domains of Nab2p and Nab4p/Hrp1p, facilitating their release from the mRNA. Yeast strains were derived from DF5 (Mat a/Mat α ura3–52/ura3–52 his3Δ200/his3Δ200 trp1–1/trp1–1 leu2–3, 112/leu2–3, 112 lys2–801/lys2–801) or W303 (Mat a/Mat α ade2–1/ade2–1 ura3–1/ura3–1 his3–11, 15/his3–11, 15 trp1–1/trp1–1 leu2–3, 112/leu2–3, 112 can1–100/can1–100) (44Aitchison J.D.

KAP104 strains are derivatives of DF5 cells and have been described (18Aitchison J.D. Blobel G. Rout M.P. Science. 1996; 274: 624-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). KAP104 and NAB2 open reading frames were amplified from yeast genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction, cloned into the BamHI site of pGEX-2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and termed Nab2-pGEX2TK. Likewise, NAB4/HRP1 was cloned into the BamHI site of pGEX-4T1 and termed Nab4-pGEX4T1. Kap95p-GST (13Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) was a gift from M. Rexach, Stanford University. Full-length Nab2p tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) was a gift from C. Guthrie (University of California at San Francisco, CA). Nab2p deletion constructs Δ8–188, Δ200–264, and Δ306–499 were constructed by polymerase chain reaction. Oligonucleotides containing SacI restriction sites were designed to amplify NAB2 and pGEX2TK while omitting the desired site of insertion. The fragments were purified, digested withSacI, and ligated. Recombinant plasmids were sequenced to confirm deletions. Nab4p fragments encoding amino acid residues 492–534, 392–534, and 241–400 were amplified from yeast genomic DNA (Promega, Madison, WI) using polymerase chain reaction and oligonucleotides containing restriction sites for cloning as described below. Fragments were cloned into the BamHI andEcoRI sites in pGEX-2TK or into the HindIII andEcoRI sites of NES-GFP2-NLS (pKW430) or p12-GFP2-NLS (pKW431) (36Stade K. Ford C.S. Guthrie C. Weis K. Cell. 1997; 90: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). PKW431 was a gift from K. Weis (University of California at San Francisco, CA). In each case, the cNLS was removed and replaced with NAB2 or NAB4/HRP1 coding sequence upstream of, and in-frame with, a mutant (p12; nes) or wild type NES followed by two GFP coding sequences (2×GFP). The carboxyl-terminal deletion of Nab4p was constructed by digesting full-length Nab4-pGEX4T1 withNdeI and SmaI. T4 DNA polymerase was then used to create blunt ends, and the sample was ligated. GST fusion proteins were expressed separately inEscherichia coli (BL21 DE3 pLYS-S) (Novagen, Madison, WI). Overnight cultures were diluted and grown for 3–4 h at 37 °C. Expression of the chimeras was induced by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 2 mm, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for an additional 2 h. Cells were harvested and washed with water, and pellets were rapidly frozen with dry ice ethanol. Pellets were then resuspended in 30 ml of transport buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 110 mm KOAc, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 μm CaCl2, 1 μm ZnCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 300 μl of solution P (0.4 mg/ml pepstatin A, 18 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (18Aitchison J.D. Blobel G. Rout M.P. Science. 1996; 274: 624-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar)) and immediately lysed by sonication. The resulting lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 2500 × g for 15 min and then 17,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The lysates were frozen with dry ice ethanol and stored at −80 °C. Yeast Ran (Gsp1) (45Floer M. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5313-5316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) was a gift from M. Floer and G. Blobel (The Rockefeller University, New York, NY). Ran was loaded with three forms of guanine nucleotide, GTP, GTPγS (guanylyl imidodiphosphate, nonhydrolyzable form of GTP), and GDP as described (13Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). A reaction mixture containing 30 mm EDTA, 4 mmdithiothreitol, 1.2 mm guanine nucleotide in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 6.8, 2 mmMgOAc2, 150 mm KOAc) was incubated with equal volume of Ran (0.8 μg/μl) at room temperature for 90 min. Magnesium acetate was added to a final concentration of 30 mm, and samples were incubated at 4 °C for 15 min and stored at −80 °C. Protein lysates were thawed in ice water and incubated with 20 μl of glutathione (GT) resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) preequilibrated in transport buffer for 1 h at 4 °C on a platform rocker. Beads were pelleted for 5 s and washed with transport buffer four times. To remove proteins from the resin, the GST chimeras were cleaved with 0.3 National Institutes of Health units of thrombin (Sigma) and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Thrombin was deactivated after the incubation time by the addition of 1 unit of hirudin (Sigma). Cleaved proteins were collected by removing GT-bound GST-containing proteins by centrifugation as above. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and cleared of residual GST-containing proteins by addition of 10 μl of fresh resin, followed by a 30-min incubation at 4 °C and centrifugation. For assays involving interactions between two or more proteins, the initial binding steps were done as above, and cleaved proteins were incubated with GST fusions, prebound to the GT resin, for 1 h at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged, and the supernatant precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. The bound fractions were washed three times prior to cleavage from the resin as described above and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Recombinant proteins were purified and cleaved as above. ssDNA-cellulose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions and stored at 4 °C. Before use, 100 μl of slurry was washed twice with transport buffer. ∼7.5 μg of cleaved proteins was incubated in 500 μl with ssDNA (35 μl of 50% slurry) for 1 h at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged briefly and washed three times with transport buffer. Aliquots of the ssDNA-protein complex were made and incubated with additional protein samples prepared as described above for 1 h at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged, and the unbound fractions were collected and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. Bound fractions were boiled with SDS sample buffer, and samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Protein complexes were formed as above and separated into aliquots. Three μg of Ran-GTPγS, Ran-GTP, Ran-GDP, or buffer alone was added, and samples were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were centrifuged for 3 s, and unbound fractions were collected. The beads were washed, and bound proteins were cleaved from the resin with thrombin. Bound and unbound fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Wild type or mutant cells containing GFP-tagged proteins were grown in selective media, and cells were visualized directly by fluorescent microscopy using a Zeiss Axioskop 2. Images were captured using a Spot camera (Diagnostic Instruments Inc., Sterling Heights, MI). In the case of temperature-sensitive cells, cultures were grown overnight at 23 °C, shifted to 37 °C for the indicated time, and examined for GFP distribution. Sample temperatures were maintained on the microscope using a heated stage (Minitube, Minitube Canada, Woodstock, ON, Canada). The shuttling assay was performed as described by (36Stade K. Ford C.S. Guthrie C. Weis K. Cell. 1997; 90: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar, 46Lee M.S. Henry M. Silver P.A. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1233-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: kap104–16 cells containing Nab2p-GFP were grown at 23 °C overnight and then shifted to 37 °C or left at 23 °C in the presence or absence of 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide for 4.5 h. Nab2p-GFP was visualized by fluorescent microscopy. Kap104p-GST was expressed and purified in E. coli as described above. Immobilized Kap104p-GST was incubated for 1 h with recombinant Nab4p/Hrp1p at 4 °C. Complexes were then incubated with 3 μg of Ran-GTP, 10 μg of total yeast RNA, or 3 μg of Ran-GTP + 10 μg of total yeast RNA for 30 min at room temperature. Unbound fractions were collected, and bound fractions were washed and cleaved with thrombin. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Immunopurification studies showed that Kap104p isolated from the yeast cytoplasm copurified with its two import substrates, Nab2p and Nab4p/Hrp1p (18Aitchison J.D. Blobel G. Rout M.P. Science. 1996; 274: 624-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear from these results whether this represented a trimeric complex or a pair of two member complexes containing Kap104p and Nab2p or Nab4p/Hrp1p. To examine this, GST chimeras of Kap104p, Nab2p, and Nab4p/Hrp1p were expressed in E. coli. Nab2p-GST and Nab4p/Hrp1p-GST were immobilized on GT-Sepharose and incubated with recombinant Kap104p. In both cases, Kap104p bound directly to the fusion proteins in vitro (Fig. 1 A). The relative amounts of protein, as detected by Coomassie Blue staining, suggests that under these conditions, Kap104p binds to Nab2p and Nab4p/Hrp1p with similar capacity. Under the same conditions, we were unable to detect the formation of a trimeric complex (data not shown). Thus, the cytoplasmic interactions previously observed were likely two independent, cytoplasmic, Kap104p-substrate import complexes. To identify the NLS recognized by Kap104p, we first examined the protein sequence of Nab2p. Nab2p contains two distinct functional RNA-binding motifs: amino acid residues 200–249 are rich in glycine and arginine residues and contain a sequence that fits the consensus RGG box sequence, and amino acid residues 249–474 contain a CCCH zinc finger domain. Nab2p also contains a Gln-rich region between amino acid residues 101 and 172 (38Dreyfuss G. Matunis M.J. Pinol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 289-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar, 43Anderson J.T. Wilson S.M. Datar K.V. Swanson M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2730-2741Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 47Kiledjian M. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2655-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). We expressed GST chimeras harboring deletions of these regions in E. coli and tested their ability to bind Kap104p using in vitro binding assays (Fig.1 B). Nab2p lacking the Gln-rich region (Δ8–188; Fig.1 B) or the CCCH zinc finger domain (Δ306–499; Fig.1 B) maintained their ability to bind Kap104p. In contrast, Nab2p lacking the RGG box, within amino acid residues 201–264, failed to bind Kap104p (Δ201–264; Fig. 1 B), suggesting that the RGG motif of Nab2p is necessary for Kap104p binding. To test whether this domain is sufficient for binding Kap104p, the RGG motif (amino acid residues 200–249) fused to GST was assayed for binding to Kap104p. As shown in Fig. 1 B (200–249) the RGG box alone was able to bind directly to Kap104p. These results are consistent with recent studies mapping the Nab2p NLS. Both studies used two hybrid analysis to map Kap104p-interacting domain to amino acid residues 198–252 (48Siomi M.C. Fromont M. Rain J.C. Wan L. Wang F. Legrain P. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4141-4148Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and 181–251 (49Truant R. Fridell R.A. Benson R.E. Bogerd H. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1449-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), respectively. Our results map the Kap104p-interacting domain of Nab2p to amino acid residues 200–249, supporting these findings and extending them to show direct binding of this domain to Kap104p. Similarly, we assayed Nab4p/Hrp1p to identify the region responsible for binding to Kap104p. Nab4p/Hrp1p contains two RNA recognition motifs between amino acid residues 161 and 291 and an RG-rich carboxyl terminus (19Henry M. Borland C.Z. Bossie M. Silver P.A.

Deletion of the carboxyl terminus (Δ321–534; Fig. 1 B) of Nab4p/Hrp1p abolished its ability to interact with Kap104p. Amino acid residues 241–400 of Nab4p/Hrp1p fused to GST, containing a highly basic region (pI 10.01) between amino acid residues 281–350, and a short stretch (amino acid residues 329–350; pI 12.1) rich in Gly, Arg, and Asn residues, failed to bind to Kap104p in the solution binding assay (data not shown). In contrast, the carboxyl-terminal fragments consisting of amino acid residues 392–534 (pI 9.11) or amino acid residues 492–534 (pI 11.44) of Nab4p/Hrp1p fused to GST were sufficient to support Kap104p binding in the solution binding assay (Fig. 1 B). The extreme carboxyl terminus (amino acid residues 506–534) is similar to the RGG box of Nab2p but does not fit the RGG box RNA binding consensus sequence (38Dreyfuss G. Matunis M.J. Pinol-Roma S.

Nature. 1998; 395: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), confirm the close structural and functional similarity between the ligand-binding domain of iGluRs and polar amino acid-binding proteins. In contrast to the other domains of iGluR subunits, very little is known about the structural and functional role of the N-terminal ∼400-residue segment (referred to here as “X domain”), which may be distantly related to bacterial LIVBP and homologous extracellular solute binding proteins (7O'Hara P.J. Sheppard P.O. Thogersen H. Venezia D. Haldeman B.A. McGrane V. Houamed K.M. Thomsen C. Gilbert T.L. Mulvihill E.R.

Exchange of the X domains between AMPA-selective GluRC (GluR3) and the glycine-binding NR1 subunit of theN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor had no effect on agonist affinities of the parent subunits (8Stern-Bach Y.

Neuron. 1994; 13: 1345-1357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), excluding direct participation in agonist binding. Recently, however, a role for the N-terminal segment in the modulation of glycine-independent desensitization of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor has been suggested (22Krupp J.J. Vissel B.

In the present study, we have characterized the properties of extracellular domains of the GluRD AMPA receptor, expressed in insect cells either as separate domains or as an XS1S2 ectodomain. We provide evidence that the presence of the X domain does not significantly affect the ligand-binding properties but it does contribute to dimerization of the ectodomain. DNA constructs for the expression of epitope-tagged rat GluRD and fragments of GluRD were generated using the polymerase chain reaction. Briefly, synthetic oligonucleotides incorporating appropriate restriction sites for further cloning served as primers to amplify GluRD fragments. A pBluescript plasmid encoding full-length GluRD cDNA was used as the template. The amplified fragments were cloned in a derivative of pFASTBAC1 (Life Technologies, Inc.) engineered to encode a signal peptide followed by an N-terminal FLAG epitope (15Kuusinen A. Arvola M. Keinänen K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6327-6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The correctness of all polymerase chain reaction-derived sequences in the final construction was verified by DNA sequencing. For design of the expression constructs, see Fig.1. The 13-residue peptide STEGEVNAEEEGF was used as a linker between the S1 and S2 segments as described previously (15Kuusinen A. Arvola M. Keinänen K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6327-6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The recombinant baculoviruses were generated by using the Bac-to-Bac system (Life Technologies, Inc.), and Spodoptera frugiperda Sf21 insect cells (Invitrogen) were transfected with resulting recombinant bacmids by lipofection (Insectin, Invitrogen) as described before (18Lampinen M. Pentikäinen O. Johnson M.S. Keinänen K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4704-4711Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). High-titer virus stocks were prepared from the recombinant viruses in Sf21 insect cells growing in SF-900 II medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), and subsequently used to infect suspension cultures of High Five cells (Invitrogen) in SF-900 II medium. At 3–4 days post-infection, the culture media was harvested by centrifugation and assayed by immunoblotting for expression of FLAG-tagged proteins. The media were then subjected directly to the purification procedure or frozen for later processing. The culture supernatant was cleared by centrifugation (15,000 ×g, 60 min), adjusted to 1 m NaCl and 2.5 mm CaCl2, and passed as 2-liter batches through a NiCl2-charged chelating Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (30 ml) at a flow rate of 1–2 ml/min. The column was washed with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and the bound proteins were eluted using a stepwise imidazole gradient prepared in the Hepes buffer. Eluates from 200 to 500 mm imidazole fractions were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol. Protein concentration was determined by UV absorption at 280 nm or by using Pierce BCA (bicinchoninic acid) method according to manufacturer's instructions. Purified and dialyzed samples were assayed for AMPA and l-glutamate binding by incubating samples (up to 10 μg of protein) with [3H]AMPA (5 nm; 40.0 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products Inc.) as described before (15Kuusinen A. Arvola M. Keinänen K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6327-6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 18Lampinen M. Pentikäinen O. Johnson M.S. Keinänen K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4704-4711Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) or withl-[3H]glutamate (20 nm; 49.5 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products Inc.) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, for 1 h on ice, followed by rapid filtration through (0.3%) polyethyleneimine-treated Whatman GF/B filters. The filters were solubilized in liquid scintillation fluid (Optiphase HighSafe, Wallac) and counted for 3H radioactivity. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 mml-glutamate. For saturation binding, 3 μg of purified protein was incubated with 1–300 nm [3H]AMPA (diluted with unlabeledRS-AMPA to 8 Ci/mmol) in the presence or absence of 1 mml-glutamate. The binding data were analyzed using nonlinear curve-fitting (GraphPad Prism) to yield the dissociation constant (K d) and the specific binding activity (B max). For ligand competition assays, the samples were incubated in the presence of 5 nm [3H]AMPA and increasing concentrations of unlabeled ligands. Kainate, l-glutamate, and 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione were obtained from RBI. The binding data were analyzed by nonlinear curve fitting using a model for one-site binding to yield IC50 values. All radioligand binding experiments were performed in triplicate and at least three times with essentially identical values. All fluorescence titrations were measured with an SLM 8000 spectrofluorimeter (SLM Instruments) at 5 °C with an excitation wavelength of 280 nm and band pass of 4 nm. All measurements were determined relative to a reference cuvette filled with rhodamine. The fluorescence change was followed at 336 nm. Aliquots of concentrated glutamate were added to a quartz cuvette containing 3 ml of protein (0.03–0.10 μm) in 10 mm NaPi, pH 7.3, under continuous mixing with a magnetic stirrer. For each ligand concentration 20 to 25 data points (each data point was a mean of 3 s) were averaged. The results were corrected for the dilution of the sample with ligand. The results were fitted by the equation, FiF0=1+ΔFmaxF0×(E0+L+Kd)−(E0+L+Kd)2−4×E0×L2×E0Equation 1 where F I is the fluorescence observed after the ith addition of ligand and F 0 the fluorescence of the free protein. E 0 is the protein concentration, L the added ligand concentration,K d the dissociation constant, and ΔF max is the maximum fluorescence change in going from unbound to completely bound protein. Rapid kinetic measurements were performed at 5 °C in 10 mm NaPi, pH 7.3, using an SF-61 stopped-flow fluorimeter (Hi-Tech Scientific) with an excitation wavelength of 280 nm. The fluorescence decrease was detected with a WG-320 filter (nominal cutoff 320 nm). The protein concentration was 50 nm and the glutamate concentration was at least 5-fold higher, so that pseudo-first order conditions were satisfied. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio, 5 to 7 individual traces were averaged for each ligand concentration. The ligand binding reactions were rapid and monophasic, and the time courses were therefore fit using a single exponential. The resulting rate constants exhibited a linear dependence on ligand concentration, which is consistent with a one-step binding reaction, E+L⇄koffkonELEquation 2 where E and L are the protein and ligand and k on and k offrepresent the association and dissociation rate constants, respectively. A least squares linear fit was performed of the observed pseudo-first order rate constants as a function of ligand concentration; k on andk off are given by the slope and the intercept, respectively. Five micrograms of purified protein was incubated with 5 μg of Fab21 2L. Jespersen, A. Kuusinen, A. Orellana, K. Keinänen, and J. Engberg, submitted for publication. for 1 h at +4 °C with end-over-end mixing. Thirty μl of GammaBind G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added and the incubation was continued for another hour. The gel particles were separated by low speed centrifugation, washed three times in TBST (TBS, 0.05% Tween 20), and finally resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer. A Sephacryl S-300 HR 16/60 (120-ml bed volume) column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol. Standard proteins (50–500 μg of protein in 0.5 ml; HMW and LMW gel filtration kits, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and GluRD fragments (250–500 μg of protein in 0.5 ml) were run at 0.5 ml/min in a Pharmacia FPLC chromatography system operating at room temperature. Elution was monitored by UV absorbance (280 nm). Fractions (0.5–1 ml) were analyzed by immunoblotting and radioligand binding. At least three gel filtration experiments with essentially identical results were carried out for all fragments using independent purified preparations. Intact FLAG/His-tagged GluRD was purified from Sf21 insect cells as a Triton X-100 complex as described previously (24Kuusinen A. Arvola M. Oker-Blom C. Keinänen K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 720-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For gel filtration experiments, a 1.5 × 100-cm column of Sephacryl S-300 HR, equilibrated in TBS (10 mm Tris, 150 mmNaCl), pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, was used. Purified receptor (100 μg in 1.0 ml of equilibration buffer) and standard proteins (100–500 μg in 1.0 ml) were run using a flow-rate of 0.45 ml/min. As the high UV absorbance of Triton X-100 precluded UV detection, all fractions (0.9 ml) were subjected to dot immunoblotting and to radioligand binding assay. Standard proteins were run in the same buffer and detected by protein assay. Sedimentation analysis of GluRD fragments was performed in linear 5–20% (w/v) sucrose gradients (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol) run in Beckman SW 41 Ti rotor for 41 h at 180,000 ×g (38,000 rpm) at 4 °C. Chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), aldolase (159 kDa), and catalase (232 kDa) from the HMW gel filtration kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used as reference proteins. Fractions (0.5 ml) of the gradients were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For cross-linked XS1S2, a 10–30% (w/v) sucrose gradient was used with the above mentioned parameters except for the run time which was 24 h. Native molecular weights (M) were obtained from the Svedberg equation, M=sRTD(1−νρ)Equation 3 where s is the sedimentation coefficient obtained from sucrose density gradient centrifugation experiments, Ris the gas constant (8.314 J K−1 mol−1),T is temperature (293 K), D is the diffusion coefficient obtained from gel filtration experiments, ν̄ is partial specific volume estimated from the amino acid sequence, and ρ is the density of solvent (for water ρ = 0.9982 g cm−3). Three-hundred-microliter samples of GluRD fragments from the sucrose density gradient (100–200 μg/ml) were incubated with the covalent cross-linker glutaraldehyde (0–12 mm; EM Sciences) for 60 min at room temperature. Aliquots were removed from the reaction mixture at the time points indicated under “Results,” quenched with an excess of Tris, pH 8.0 (166 mm final concentration), and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (7%). Protein samples were denatured by heat treatment (95 °C, 5 min) in dithiothreitol-containing Laemmli sample buffer, and resolved by electrophoresis in a 7 or 10% gel. Gels were stained with silver nitrate or transferred to nitrocellulose, followed by immunostaining. Anti-FLAG M1 (10 μg/ml, Sigma), alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad), and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium color substrates were used for the detection. Recombinant GluRD fragments expressed in High Five insect cells were secreted as soluble proteins as demonstrated by an anti-FLAG immunoblot of the culture supernatants (Fig.2 A). The observed sizes of the immunoreactive bands correspond closely to the values expected from the sequence and from the likely presence of N-glycans (approximate contribution of 1.5 kDa per N-glycan): the XS1S2 fragment migrates as a 92-kDa band (lane 2; calculated size 82 kDa + maximally 6 N-glycans), the XS1 fragment migrates as a 67-kDa band (lane 3; 62 kDa + 6N-glycans), the X fragment as a 50-kDa band (lane 4; 46 kDa + 4 N-glycans), and the S1S2 fragment as a 42-kDa band (lane 5; 38 kDa + 2 N-glycans). For comparison, intact GluRD (subunit size 110 kDa), solubilized from insect cells is shown in lane 1. The fragments were purified from culture supernatants using metal chelation chromatography (Fig. 2 B). Purification yields were 100–400 μg of XS1S2, XS1, and X fragments, and 1–2 mg of S1S2 from 1 liter of culture supernatant. Initially, no signs of proteolytic degradation products were observed in the culture supernatants (see Fig. 2 A), but proteolytic products started to appear, in particular with XS1 (60- and 42-kDa bands, lane 2, Fig.2 B) and XS1S2 (66-kDa band, lane 2, Fig. 4) after purification and storage for several weeks. The purified proteins were examined for specific [3H]AMPA (Fig. 2 C) andl-[3H]glutamate binding (Fig. 2 D). The two fragments which contain the ligand-binding domain (XS1S2 and S1S2) bound both radioligands at levels exceeding the nonspecific background binding (in the presence of 1 mm unlabeled glutamate) by a factor of 10 (for l-glutamate) to 50 (AMPA). The other fragments (XS1 and X) and control proteins (bovine serum albumin and an antibody fragment) did not show any specific binding with either radioligand. In a saturation binding assay, purified XS1S2 bound [3H]AMPA with a high affinity (K d 42 nm) and capacity (B max 1 nmol/mg of protein) (TableI). In a ligand displacement assay, no significant differences in the relative affinities forl-glutamate, kainate, and 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione were observed between XS1S2, S1S2, and the intact receptor (TableI).Table ILigand binding characteristics of GluRD fragmentsK dIC50L-glutamateKainateDNQXaDNQX, 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione.nmμmXS1S241 ± 110.28 ± 0.052.1 ± 0.20.23 ± 0.07S1S233 ± 10.29 ± 0.022.3 ± 0.60.46 ± 0.17GluRD58 ± 150.45 ± 0.173.1 ± 1.10.58 ± 0.15Values for binding affinity (K d) and IC50are mean (± S.D.) of three independent experiments.

Abele, K. Keinänen, and D. R. Madden, manuscript in preparation. Since there are no tryptophan residues located within the immediate vicinity of the ligand-binding site (20Armstrong N. Sun Y. Chen G.Q. Gouaux E. Nature. 1998; 395: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), the fluorescence decrease presumably reflects conformational changes undergone following ligand binding and thus acts as a reporter for the ligand-binding mechanism of the S1S2 domain. Fluorescence titration measurements of glutamate binding to both S1S2 and XS1S2 (Table II,K d values) confirm that their affinities for glutamate are comparable.Table IIRate constants and affinities of S1S2 and XS1S2 for glutamatek onk offk off/k onK d× 10+6 (M−1s−1)s−1× 10−6 (M−1)S1S216.0 ± 0.97.6 ± 0.80.47 ± 0.060.55 ± 0.03XS1S214.7 ± 1.05.9 ± 0.90.40 ± 0.070.49 ± 0.02The dissociation rate constants k off and association rate constants k on were determined from the linear fits shown in Fig. 3.

The equilibrium dissociation constantsK d were determined by fluorescence titration measurements. The ratio ofk off/k on is shown for comparison with K d. Finally, using stopped-flow rapid-mixing techniques, the time course of glutamate binding to both S1S2 and XS1S2 was followed. Both constructs exhibited monophasic binding (e.g. Fig.3 A). Under pseudo-first order conditions, the observed rate constant exhibits a linear dependence on glutamate concentration, consistent with a one-step binding mechanism (Fig. 3 B). The association and dissociation rate constants obtained for glutamate binding to S1S2 and XS1S2 again show no significant difference (Table II). The K d values forl-glutamate binding calculated from the association and dissociation rate constants are in very good agreement with the values obtained from the fluorescence titration measurements, and only slightly higher (0.4–0.5 μm versus 0.3 μm) than the values obtained from radioligand displacement assays (Table I). In the absence of any conventional assay to verify the structural integrity of the expressed and purified X domain, we used a recently described2 monoclonal antibody, designated as Fab21, which recognizes an epitope in the X domain of GluRD. Binding of Fab21 to GluRD is sensitive to acidic and alkaline treatments and to SDS, suggesting that the antibody is conformation-specific. All three soluble fragments which contain the X domain (XS1S2, XS1, and X) were immunoprecipitated by Fab21, whereas S1S2 was not (Fig.4). Furthermore, X domain briefly heated to 65 °C was not immunoprecipitated, consistent with the conformation-specific nature of Fab21. Proteolytic degradation products of XS1S2, and especially of XS1 are also present in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4). In size exclusion chromatography on Sephacryl S-300, X and S1S2 fragments both eluted as single, relatively symmetric peaks corresponding to sizes of 87 and 59 kDa, respectively (assuming similar relation between V e and molecular size as for the globular protein standards) (Fig. 5, B and C; Table III). In contrast, the elution pattern of the XS1S2 fragment appeared less uniform, displaying a major peak corresponding to a size of 276 kDa and a minor shoulder at 137 kDa, (Fig. 5A; Table III). Subsequent immunoblotting and radioligand binding assays showed that FLAG immunoreactivity and AMPA binding activity (XS1S2 and S1S2 fragments) were associated with the peak fractions of the UV absorbance and that both the main peak and the shoulder of XS1S2 samples consist of intact XS1S2 (results not shown). The XS1 fragment tended to aggregate during gel filtration as indicated by a remarkable loss of protein in the column and elution of the rest of the protein in the void volume (not shown), and therefore XS1 fragment was not analyzed further. We also studied whether the X and S1S2 domains would associate in vitro into a larger complex by mixing the two fragments in equivalent molar amounts (both at 0.5 mg/ml), and subjecting the mixture to gel filtration. No formation of bigger complexes was, however, observed (results not shown).Table IIIHydrodynamic analysis of GluRD fragmentsV elutionMolecular mass (GF)DsNative molecular massCalculated sizemlkDa×107cm2 s−1×10−13 skDaS1S268.759 ± 36.853.04138X64.887 ± 75.655.38646XS1S253.9276 ± 233.616.716982Elution volume and molecular size (average ± S.D.) are determined from three to five independent gel filtration (GF) experiments.D is the diffusion coefficient derived from gel filtration calibration curve, s is the sedimentation coefficient obtained from density gradient centrifugation.

Native molecular weight is calculated from Svedberg equation. Calculated sizes were obtained from the predicted sequences of the mature polypeptides. For comparison, the intact purified GluRD was analyzed by gel filtration in the presence of Triton X-100. Based on dot immunoblotting and radioligand-binding assays (Fig. 5 E), GluRD eluted as a sharp ∼500-kDa peak between ferritin (440 kDa) and thyroglobulin (669 kDa). Taking into account uncertainties in the amount of bound detergent and the contribution of molecular shape, this size estimate is consistent with 4–5 subunits per molecule. The hydrodynamic properties of purified GluRD fragments were further analyzed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (Fig.6). S1S2 fragment sedimented with a rate close to that of ovalbumin (s = 3.0 S). The X fragment sedimented faster with a sedimentation coefficient of 5.3 S. In comparison to protein standards and to the S1S2 and X fragments, the XS1S2 fragment sedimented as less uniform population with as value of 6.7 S. From these values and the diffusion coefficients obtained from gel filtration calibration curve, the native molecular weights were calculated by using the Svedberg equation. The following molecular masses were obtained: 41 kDa for S1S2, 86 kDa for X, and 169 kDa for the XS1S2 fragment (Table III). These values are consistent with X and XS1S2 being dimers and S1S2 being a monomer. To further analyze the oligomerization of the XS1S2 fragment, we carried out covalent cross-linking experiments with the purified fragments. Treatment with dimethyl suberimidate, dimethyl-3,3-dithiobis(propionimidate), or 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide did not result in formation of any high molecular mass complexes under the conditions used, whereas glutaraldehyde treatment gradually converted the XS1S2 fragment into a 160–200-kDa species with concomitant disappearance of the 92-kDa species (Fig. 7 A,upper panel). Under the same conditions, S1S2 did not form higher molecular weight complexes (Fig. 7 A, lower panel). Somewhat unexpectedly X fragment produced only a very weak 100-kDa band upon treatment with glutaraldehyde (Fig. 7 A,middle panel). Incubation with glutaraldehyde caused a diffuse appearance of the bands, most notably with XS1S2 and S1S2, presumably due to the effects of extensive (and nonuniform) intramolecular cross-links. Considered together with the hydrodynamic behavior of the fragments, these findings suggest that S1S2 exists predominantly in a monomeric state. To resolve the cross-linking products of XS1S2 better, the cross-linked fragment was subjected to sucrose density gradient centrifugation followed by SDS-PAGE in a low percentage gel. Much like untreated XS1S2, the cross-linked XS1S2 sedimented as a heterogeneous broad population indicating that glutaraldehyde cross-linking does not induce an oligomerized or aggregated state which is not present in the original preparation (not shown). SDS-PAGE analysis of the fractions revealed that the slow sedimenting cross-linked species correspond largely to monomers whereas the peak fractions represent the dimer with an apparent size of 160–200 kDa (Fig. 7 B). The cross-linked species present in the fast sedimenting fractions was not able to penetrate into the running gel (7% acrylamide concentration) representing larger aggregates. This experiment was also carried out in a reverse order, i.e. XS1S2 was first run in a sucrose gradient and fractions from the peak and before the peak were cross-linked. The XS1S2 dimer was produced from the peak fractions but not from the slowly sedimenting fractions of sucrose density gradient centrifugation (results not shown). This study shows that the N-terminal LIVBP-like region, X domain, of iGluR subunits can be expressed in a soluble form allowing biochemical characterization of some of its properties. Separately expressed X domain did not show any measurable binding ofl-glutamate or AMPA in a radioligand binding assay, whereas the XS1S2 fragment, which represents the entire extracellular region of GluRD subunit, bound both radioligands with properties indistinguishable from the soluble S1S2 ligand-binding domain and from the intact GluRD. Both S1S2 and XS1S2 showed similar fluorescence changes upon ligand binding and similar association and dissociation rates constants, consistent with a minimal or negliglible contribution of the N-terminal domain to ligand binding. These findings are in agreement with earlier domain swap experiments, which showed that engrafting the N-terminal domain of NR1 on GluRC (GluR3) does not modify the agonist pharmacology of GluRC (8Stern-Bach Y. Bettler B. Hartley M. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P.J. Heinemann S.F. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1345-1357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The ligand-binding S1S2 domain of GluRD behaves as a monomer in solution in agreement with the behavior of a similar fragment of GluRB (25Chen G.-Q. Gouaux E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13431-13436Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Also, small-angle x-ray scattering studies indicate that S1S2 of GluRD is a monomer even at protein concentrations as high as 20 mg/ml (26Abele R. Svergun D. Keinänen K. Koch M.H.J. Madden D.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10949-10957Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Interestingly, insect cell-expressed S1S2 fragment of the NR1 subunit of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor was reported to exist largely as multimers (27Ivanovic A. Reilander H. Laube B. Kuhse J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19933-19937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The specific ligand binding activity of that preparation was, however, extremely low making it difficult to assess the significance of the difference. Calculation of native molecular mass yielded a size of 86 and 169 kDa for the separately expressed X and XS1S2 domains, respectively, consistent with a dimeric structure. For some reason, however, glutaraldehyde was able to cross-link only a minority of X fragments. The purified XS1S2 preparations contained clearly at least two differently sized species. In gel filtration, the XS1S2 fragment eluted as a major 276-kDa and a minor 137-kDa peak. Based on cross-linking results, these are likely to correspond to dimers and monomers, respectively, of the ectodomain. What is the relevance of our findings to subunit interactions in native AMPA receptors? Several facts support the view that the soluble recombinant XS1S2 and X fragments represent native-like protein domains. First, presence of a correctly folded ligand-binding domain in XS1S2 is indicated by the highly similar ligand-binding pharmacology and kinetics of XS1S2 and S1S2. In the absence of any functional signature for the X domain, we used binding to a monoclonal antibody which recognizes a conformational epitope present in the N terminus of native receptor as an alternative. The antibody was able to immunoprecipitate the X domain-containing fragments, demonstrating the presence of at least some structural characteristics of the native (but not denatured) receptor in the purified XS1S2 and X fragments. Furthermore, the secretion of the fragments as soluble proteins is consistent with a folded structure. Under similar conditions, several shorter versions of the X domain are not secreted at all, but accumulate in the cells as partly insoluble protein. 4A. Kuusinen and K. Keinänen, unpublished data. Despite the above discussed “native-like” properties of the soluble ectodomain, we found that the XS1S2 ectodomain is a dimer with no convincing evidence for the formation of specific higher oligomers, in particular, tetramers and pentamers. Some large molecular weight material was evident in the cross-linked XS1S2 preparations but this represented only a small fraction of the total and was not able to enter the 7% polyacrylamide separation gel at all. Our gel filtration experiments with intact GluRD suggest that the molecule forms tetramers or pentamers, consistent with observations of others (2Laube B. Kuhse J. Betz H. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2954-2961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Rosenmund C. Stern-Bach Y. Stevens C.F. Science. 1998; 280: 1596-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 4Mano I. Teichberg V.I.

The absence of tetramers or pentamers from the GluRD ectodomain thus suggests that important determinants for oligomerization are either lacking (most notably transmembrane domains) or require a membrane environment to be fully manifested. Identification of the structures involved in XS1S2 dimerization, and analysis of their role in AMPA receptor assembly should help to resolve this issue. It is possible that the XS1S2 dimers may, however, represent a transient state present during the assembly of the receptor. For example, the assembly of the pentameric nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is guided by extracellular domain interactions and involves intermediates with a lower subunit number (28Blount P. Smith M.M. Merlie J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2601-2611Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 29Wang Z.Z. Hardy S.F. Hall Z.W. J.

Interestingly, while the current manuscript was under revision, Leuschner and Hoch (32Leuschner W.D. Hoch W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16907-16916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) reported that a membrane-anchored N-terminal fragment (X domain) of GluRB is able to associate with GluRA in transfected COS cells. This finding is consistent with our present results indicating that the X domain mediates dimerization of the ectodomain.

The HSV-1 immediate early (IE) protein IE63 (ICP27) is the only regulatory gene with a homologue in every mammalian and avian herpesvirus sequenced so far. IE63 is a multifunctional protein affecting transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes, and it can shuttle from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. To identify interacting cellular proteins, a HeLa cDNA library was screened in the yeast two-hybrid system using IE63 as bait. Several interacting proteins were identified including heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K), a multifunctional protein like IE63, and the β subunit of casein kinase 2 (CK2), a protein kinase, and interacting regions were mapped. Confirmation of interactions was provided by fusion protein binding assays, co-immunoprecipitation from infected cells, and CK2 activity assays. hnRNP K co-immunoprecipitated from infected cells with anti-IE63 serum was a more rapidly migrating subfraction than hnRNP K immunoprecipitated by anti-hnRNP K serum. Using anti-IE63 serum, both IE63 and hnRNP K were phosphorylated in vitro by CK2, while in immunoprecipitates using anti-hnRNP K serum, IE63 but not hnRNP K was phosphorylated by CK2. These data provide important new insights into how this key viral regulatory protein exerts its functions.

Several interacting proteins were identified including heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K), a multifunctional protein like IE63, and the β subunit of casein kinase 2 (CK2), a protein kinase, and interacting regions were mapped. Confirmation of interactions was provided by fusion protein binding assays, co-immunoprecipitation from infected cells, and CK2 activity assays. hnRNP K co-immunoprecipitated from infected cells with anti-IE63 serum was a more rapidly migrating subfraction than hnRNP K immunoprecipitated by anti-hnRNP K serum. Using anti-IE63 serum, both IE63 and hnRNP K were phosphorylated in vitro by CK2, while in immunoprecipitates using anti-hnRNP K serum, IE63 but not hnRNP K was phosphorylated by CK2. These data provide important new insights into how this key viral regulatory protein exerts its functions. herpes simplex virus type 1 immediate early CK2, casein kinase 2 glutathioneS-transferase maltose-binding protein 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis amino acids wild type phosphate-buffered saline DNA-binding domain activation domain The involvement of herpesviruses in a range of prominent medical or veterinary diseases makes them one of the most important virus families. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1),1 a common and effective human pathogen, is capable of establishing both lytic and latent infectious life cycles, and up to 80% of adults in the developed world are seropositive for this virus. HSV-1 is a nuclear replicating virus with a large double-stranded DNA genome that encodes some 80 gene products (1McGeoch D.J. Schaffer P.A. O'Brien S.J. Genetic Maps. 6th Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 147-156Google Scholar). During lytic infection, virus genes are expressed in a temporal cascade and are categorized as immediate early (IE, α), early (β), or late (γ) based on the time postinfection of their expression (2Honess R.W. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 1276-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The five IE gene products, which do not require prior viral protein synthesis for their expression, regulate early and late gene expression and subvert the host cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response (3Clements J.B. Watson R.J. Wilkie N.M. Cell. 1977; 12: 275-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 4Ploegh H. Johnson D. Nature. 1995; 375: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). A key IE protein is the 63-kDa IE phosphoprotein IE63 also called ICP27 (5Ackermann M. Braun D.K. Pereira L. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1984; 52: 108-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IE63 is one of two HSV IE proteins essential for lytic virus replication (6Sacks W.R. Green C.C. Ascaan D.P. Schaffer P.H. J. Virol. 1985; 55: 796-805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is the only regulatory gene with a homologue in every herpesvirus of mammals and birds sequenced so far (7McGeoch D.J. Davison A.J. Domingo E. Webster R.G. Holland J.J. Origin and Evolution of Viruses. Academic Press, Inc., New York1999: 441-465Crossref Google Scholar), suggesting that aspects of its regulatory role are maintained throughout the herpesvirus family. Studies of IE63 have shown that its expression is required for the switch from early to late virus gene expression (8McCarthy A.M. McMahon L. Schaffer P.H. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 18-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and have highlighted the multifunctional nature of this protein that acts both at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (reviewed in Ref. 9Phelan A. Clements J.B. Semin. Virol. 1998; 8: 309-318Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Acting post-transcriptionally, IE63 binds RNA in vivo with a reported specificity for intronless viral transcripts (10Sandri-Goldin R.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 868-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), enhances pre-mRNA 3′ processing (11McGregor F. Phelan A. Dunlop J. Clements J.B. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1931-1940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), inhibits splicing of viral and cellular transcripts (12Hardy W.R. Sandri-Goldin R.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7790-7799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), causes the nuclear retention of intron-containing viral transcripts (13Phelan A. Dunlop J. Clements J.B. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5255-5265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and co-localizes with nuclear antigens such as small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (14Phelan A. Carmo-Fonseca M. McLauchlan J. Lamond A. Clements J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9056-9060Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). IE63 is capable of shuttling from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (15Soliman T.M. Sandri-Goldin R.M. Silverstein S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9188-9197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Phelan A. Clements J.B. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 3327-3331Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and may facilitate the nuclear export of intronless RNAs, which form the vast majority of viral transcripts (10Sandri-Goldin R.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 868-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). IE63 and the other essential HSV-1 IE protein, IE175, a transcriptional transactivator of early and late virus genes, colocalize within HSV-1 replication compartments (17Zhong L. Hayward G.S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3146-3160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and IE63 affects the post-translational modification (18Xia K. DeLuca N.A. Knipe D.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 108-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Xia K. Knipe D.M. DeLuca N.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1050-1060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in vitro function of IE175 (20Pangiotidis C.A. Lium E.K. Silverstein S.J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1547-1557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), supporting an involvement in transcription. Domains within IE63 (Fig. 1) include an N-terminal acidic region essential for lytic replication (21Rice S.A. Lam V. Knipe D.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1778-1787Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an N-terminal nuclear/nucleolar localization signal (22Mears W.E. Lam V. Rice S.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 935-947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a methylated internal RGG box required for RNA binding (23Mears W.E. Rice S.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7445-7453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), C-terminal transactivator and transrepressor regions required for IE63 co-immunoprecipitation with anti-Sm serum (24Sandri-Goldin R.W. Hibbard M.C. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 108-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a zinc finger-like region located toward the extreme C terminus (25Vaughan P.J. Thibault K.I. Hardwicke M.A. Sandri-Goldin R.M. Virology. 1992; 189: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). IE63 has an N-terminal leucine-rich region, homologous to regions of other proteins known to shuttle from the nucleus such as Rev (26Kalland K-H. Szilvay A.M. Brokstad K.A. Saetrevik W. Haukenes G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7436-7444Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), which promotes its export to the cytoplasm (10Sandri-Goldin R.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 868-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Infection with a virus containing a mutation at the IE63 C terminus also prevents the protein from shuttling (27Mears W.E. Rice S.A. Virology. 1998; 242: 128-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Using the yeast two-hybrid system and in vitro binding assays, we have shown that IE63 interacts with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) and with the casein kinase 2 (CK2) β subunit and have mapped regions of these proteins responsible for their interaction. Confirmation of the interaction between IE63, hnRNP K, and CK2 in infected cell extracts was obtained by immune precipitation using either anti-IE63 serum or anti-hnRNP K serum and by detection of CK2 activity in these immunoprecipitates. Interestingly, the form of hnRNP K immunoprecipitated with anti-IE63 serum was a subfraction of cellular hnRNP K, and, unlike the hnRNP K precipitated with anti-hnRNP K serum, this fraction and the co-immunoprecipitated IE63 were phosphorylated in vitro by CK2 activity present in the immunoprecipitate. Like IE63, hnRNP K is a multifunctional protein (reviewed in Refs. 28Bomsztyk K. Van Seuningen I. Suzuki H. Denisenko O. Ostrowski J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 113-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholarand 29Ostareck-Lederer A. Ostareck D.H. Hentze M.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 409-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) capable of shuttling from the nucleus to the cytoplasm with a possible role in the processing and transport of pre-mRNA (30Matunis M.J. Michael W.M. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). hnRNP K has both RNA-binding and DNA-binding properties, interacts with proteins of cellular and viral origin, acts as a transcription regulator, and affects translation. CK2 is a ubiquitous serine/threonine eukaryotic kinase known to phosphorylate, and in some cases to interact with, several proteins to regulate their activity (reviewed in Ref. 31Issinger O-G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 59: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal anti-IE63 H1113 (5Ackermann M. Braun D.K. Pereira L. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1984; 52: 108-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was supplied by the Goodwin Institute for Cancer Research. Anti-hnRNP K serum was a rabbit antibody (32Van Seuningen I. Ostrowski J. Bomsztyk K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5644-5650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) generously supplied by Dr. Karol Bomsztyk (University of Washington) raised against a synthetic peptide representing the C-terminal aa 452–464, conserved in the murine and human hnRNP K (33Ostrowski J.

Virol. 1996; 70: 7445-7453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was generously supplied by Dr. Steve Rice. The plasmid pGST-RNPK, encoding GST fused to full-length hnRNP K (34Michelotti E.F. Michelotti G.A. Aronsohn A.I. Levens D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2350-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), was a kind gift from Dr. David Levens (National Institutes of Health). GST-CK2α and maltose-binding protein (MBP)-CK2β constructs have been described previously (35Heriche J.K. Lebrin F. Rabilloud T. Leroy D. Chambaz E.M. Goldberg Y. Science. 1997; 276: 952-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 36Leroy D. Filhol O. Quintaine N. Sarrouilhe D. Loue-Mackenbach P. Chambaz E.M. Cochet C. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 191: 43-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GST-CK2β fusion constructs were made from CK2β DNA (aa 1–150) obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification of pSG5β provided by Dr. Eric Nigg (Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research), and the truncations (aa 1–55; aa 51–150) were generated using appropriate primers and sequenced to confirm their structures. The CK2 peptide substrate was supplied by Calbiochem. Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were from Sigma. Baby hamster kidney (BHK C13) cells were grown in BHK 21 medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.01% streptomycin, 10% newborn calf serum, and 10% tryptose phosphate broth. Stocks of wild type (WT) HSV-1 strain 17+and of the IE63 insertion mutant HSV-1 27-LacZ (37Smith I.L. Hardwicke M.A. Sandri-Goldin R.W. Virology. 1992; 186: 74-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) were grown as described previously (11McGregor F. Phelan A. Dunlop J. Clements J.B. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1931-1940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 90% confluent BHK cell monolayers (4 × 107 cells) were then infected with HSV-1 WT or 27-LacZ virus (multiplicity of 10) or no virus (mock-infected). After 1 h of absorption at 37 °C, cells were labeled with [35S]methionine (30 μCi/ml) for 16 h in Eagle's medium containing 20% of the normal methionine level and 2% newborn calf serum. Unlabeled cell extracts were similarly prepared. For preparation of extracts, monolayers were washed with PBS, and cells were lysed by suspension in 1 ml of cell extract buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet (Nonidet P-40) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Extracts were sonicated on ice, cell debris was pelleted, and the protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Procedures for the GST-IE63 (23Mears W.E. Rice S.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7445-7453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), GST-CK2α, MBP-CK2β, and GST-CK2β fusion proteins (35Heriche J.K. Lebrin F. Rabilloud T. Leroy D. Chambaz E.M. Goldberg Y. Science. 1997; 276: 952-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 36Leroy D. Filhol O. Quintaine N. Sarrouilhe D. Loue-Mackenbach P. Chambaz E.M. Cochet C. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 191: 43-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were as described previously. For preparation of the GST-hnRNP K protein, E. coli BL21 cells, transformed with fusion vectors, were grown in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin, to an OD of 0.5; cells were induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h at 37 °C, suspended in 5 ml of lysis buffer (PBS, 1% Triton X-100), and sonicated on ice. Fusion proteins were purified by mixing with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) beads (5 ml of lysate/400 μl of beads) for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, 1% Triton X-100 (PBST) and with PBS, beads with the bound fusion proteins were mixed with cell extract (100 μg/protein) for 1 h at 4 °C in binding buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals); equal amounts of fusion protein were used as judged by Coomassie Blue staining. Beads were washed in binding buffer, and bound proteins eluted with 50 mm HEPES, 1m NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 with protease inhibitor at 4 °C overnight were separated by electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and analyzed by Western blotting. Appropriate radioactivity was visualized using a PhosphorImager system (Molecular Dynamics Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Beads for immunoprecipitation were prepared by mixing protein A-Sepharose beads with anti-hnRNP K serum or preimmune serum in binding buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40) at 4 °C for 1 h (1 μl of serum/10 μl of beads) as described (38Van Seuningen I. Ostrowski J. Bomsztyk K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5644-5650Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Beads then were mixed with WT-infected, 27-LacZ-infected or mock-infected cell extracts (200 μg/protein) for 2 h in binding buffer at 4 °C. After pelleting and multiple washes, 30 μl of loading buffer was added, and the beads were boiled to remove bound proteins. Using anti-IE63 serum, cell extracts (100 μg/protein) were mixed with 5 μl of serum or preimmune serum in binding buffer (100 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mmEDTA, 1% Triton X-100) for 3 h at 4 °C; 75 μl of protein A-Sepharose was then added, and mixing was for 1 h. After pelleting the beads and multiple washes, the bound proteins were eluted and analyzed. Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked using PBS with 5% (w/v) dried milk and then washed in PBST. Primary antibody was added at dilutions of 1:2000 (anti-IE63) or 1:10000 (anti-hnRNP K) in PBST for 1 h at 20 °C. After washing, secondary antibody (either anti-mouse-horseradish peroxidase conjugate or protein A-horseradish peroxidase conjugate) was added (diluted 1:1000) in PBST for 1 h at 20 °C. Membranes were washed and developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoprecipitates were suspended in 30 μl of CK2 reaction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.2, 20 mm MgCl2) containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP per reaction, either with or without 0.1 mm peptide substrate (Arg-Arg-Arg-Glu-Glu-Glu-Thr-Glu-Glu-Glu) (39Kuenzel E.A. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Reactions were for 30 min at 25 °C. After brief centrifugation, the supernatant was applied to a SpinZyme column (Pierce), which was washed three times with 75 mm phosphoric acid, and phosphorylated peptide bound to the column was detected by direct scintillation counting. Immunocomplexes were washed with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and then suspended in 20 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4; and to this, 5 μl radioactive solution (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 10 μm ATP, 2.5 μCi of γ-[32P]ATP) was added. The reactions were for 15 min at 25 °C either in the presence or absence of 50 μm5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB), an inhibitor of CK2 activity that acts in vitro and in vivo (40Zandomeni R.O. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 469-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 41Blaydes J.P. Hupp T.R. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1045-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for Western blot analysis or PhosphorImager analysis. The IE63 bait constructs 502CBD (aa 10–512), 440CBD (aa 72–512), 346CBD (aa 166–512), 270CBD (aa 242–512), and N397BD (aa 10–397) were made by polymerase chain reaction amplification and fused in frame to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (DNA-BD) in the cloning vector pAS2–1, which encodes and the TRP1 gene (CLONTECH); structures of the truncations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The target constructs consisted of a human HeLa cDNA library (CLONTECH) fused in frame to the GAL4 activation domain (AD) sequences of the cloning vector pGADGH, which encodes theLEU2 gene (CLONTECH). The yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) strains used were Y187 and CG1945 (CLONTECH). The yeast strain CG1945, which has a trp −, leu −,his − phenotype and contains the two reporter genes his3 and lacZ was simultaneously transformed with the IE63 bait plasmid 502CBD and the target plasmids encoding the HeLa cDNA library (CLONTECH) fused to the AD using a basic lithium acetate protocol (42Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiest R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2887) Google Scholar). Colonies that had a trp +, leu +,his + phenotype were selected and assayed for β-galactosidase activity as described in the Matchmaker System 2 manual (CLONTECH). Candidate colonies with thehis +, lacZ + phenotype were treated with cycloheximide (1.0 μg/ml) to eliminate the IE63 bait plasmid while retaining the target library AD plasmid and then mated with strain Y187 transformed with either the bait or a series of control plasmids as described for Matchmaker System 2. The resulting diploids were tested for histidine expression and β-galactosidase activity to determine the specificity of the interaction. The candidate library plasmids were isolated from yeast and transformed by calcium chloride/heat shock into E. coli DH5α cells. Plasmid DNA was isolated using alkaline lysis/PEG precipitation, and DNA inserts of around 500 bp were sequenced using a 17-mer primer (CLONTECH) by cycle sequencing using the ABI Prism BigDye Terminator Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (Applied Biosystems) with an ABI Prism automated sequencer. The EMBL/GenBankTMdata base was searched with the sequences generated using GCG FastA (43Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9378) Google Scholar). The hnRNP K clone identified in the library screen was transformed into CG1945 and mated with strain Y187 transformed with the various IE63 bait plasmids 502CBD, 440CBD, 346CBD, 270CBD, and N397BD fused to the DNA-BD. The resulting diploids were tested and scored for reporter gene activity relative to the activity of the positive control plasmids pVA3–1 and pTD-1, which express the interacting proteins murine p53 and SV40 large T antigen fused to the GAL4 DNA-BD and AD, respectively, and the negative controls, pTD-1 and pLAM5′-1, which express human lamin C protein fused to the DNA-BD and do not interact with the SV40 large T antigen expressed by pTD-1. The regions of hnRNP K required for interaction with IE63 were mapped using the truncations described for mapping sites of interaction with the hepatitis C virus core protein (44Tsieh T-Y. Matsumoto M. Chou H-C. Schneider R. Hwang S.B. Lee A.S. Lai M.M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17651-17659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Strain CG1945 was transformed with plasmids encoding the hnRNP K truncations pGAD424-hnRNP K (aa 327–463), pGAD424-hnRNP K (aa 1–327), pGAD424-hnRNP K (aa 250–463), pGAD424-hnRNP K (aa 276–463), and pGAD424-hnRNP K (aa 1–276) and was mated with strain Y187 transformed with the plasmid encoding 502CBD fused to the DNA-BD. The resulting diploids were tested and scored for reporter gene activity. To map the regions of IE63 required for interaction with the CK2β subunit, a full-length CK2β clone identified in the library screen was transformed into CG1945 and mated with Y187 transformed with the IE63 bait plasmids 502CBD, 440CBD, 246CBD, 270CBD, and N397BD fused to the DNA-BD. The resulting diploids were tested and scored for reporter gene activity. The strength of interaction between the AD fusion constructs and the DNA-BD fusion constructs is depicted in a semiquantitative manner. In all experiments, control negative (pTD-1/pLAM5′1) and positive (pVA3–1/pTD-1) plasmid combinations (CLONTECH) were included to indicate the β-galactosidase activity in cells containing expressed proteins that do not interact or are known to give a strong interaction. The time taken for the positive cells to turn blue varied between experiments, depending on factors such as colony size, which precludes precise quantitative comparisons. However, the relative activities of different plasmid combinations were reproducible, which allowed a semiquantitative comparison at the 3-h time point as follows: ++, equivalent to the positive control; +, less than the positive control; −, equivalent to the negative control. The domain structure of IE63 is represented in Fig. 1 together with details of the truncations used to identify the regions required for interaction of IE63 with itself and other proteins. Initially, we tested the ability of IE63 itself to activate gene expression in the yeast two-hybrid assay. When full-length IE63 fused to the GAL4 DNA-BD was used as bait, the inclusion of amino acids (aa) 1–9 caused IE63 alone to transactivate the his3 and lacZ reporter genes. Thereafter, IE63 502CBD (aa 10–512) or its truncations were used as bait. None of these derivatives alone when linked to GAL4 DNA-BD activated gene expression in yeast. To examine the ability of IE63 to interact with itself, IE63 502CBD was screened against the IE63 truncations fused to the GAL4 AD. The activation of his3 andlacZ reporter genes relative to the respective positive (pVA3–1/pTD-1) and negative (pTD-1/pLAM5′1) controls are shown in Fig.1 A. The results show that sequences within aa 397–512, which contains the C-terminal putative zinc finger, were required for IE63 to interact with itself and that sequences within aa 10–72 aided this interaction; there is a report showing that the zinc finger like region is required for IE63 self-interaction (45Zhi Y. Sciabica K.S. Sandri-Goldin R.M. Virology. 1999; 257: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The ability of IE63 to interact with itself was further studied using a GST-IE63 fusion protein bound to glutathione beads. A GST pull-down experiment followed by Western blotting (Fig.1 B) showed that IE63 from infected cells interacted with GST-IE63 but not with GST alone. To identify cellular proteins capable of interacting with IE63 in the yeast two-hybrid assay, we screened a HeLa cDNA library fused to the GAL4 AD expressed in pGADGH, and 82 clones fulfilled the criteria for interaction of the gene products from a total of 2.3 × 106 transformants screened. These were sequenced and checked against the EMBL/GenBankTM data base. A single clone contained a 1.3-kilobase pair insert that precisely corresponded to aa 215–464 and the 3′-untranslated region of human hnRNP K, and 51 clones had inserts corresponding to the CK2 β subunit. The interactions involving hnRNP K and CK2β with IE63 are described here and to our knowledge represent the first description of interactions involving IE63 with these cellular proteins. Interactions involving other cellular proteins identified in the yeast two-hybrid screen will be described elsewhere. To map the regions of IE63 required for interaction with hnRNP K, the series of IE63 truncations, expressed as hybrids with the GAL4 DNA-BD, was mated into cells transformed with the hnRNP K clone identified from the library screen. The results (Fig.2 A) show that sequences within aa 242–397 were sufficient for the interaction and indicate that sequences within aa 166–242 also contribute to the interaction. To map the regions of hnRNP K required for interaction with IE63, a series of hnRNP K truncations (44Tsieh T-Y. Matsumoto M. Chou H-C. Schneider R. Hwang S.B. Lee A.S. Lai M.M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17651-17659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) was expressed as hybrids with the GAL4 AD. These were mated into cells transformed with IE63 aa 10–512 fused to the GAL4 DNA-BD. The results (Fig. 2 B) indicate that sequences within hnRNP K aa 250–276 and aa 327–463 are required for the interaction. The interaction of IE63 and hnRNP K was confirmed by in vitro binding assays using a GST-hnRNP K fusion protein bound to glutathione beads. A GST pull-down experiment followed by Western blotting (Fig. 3 B), showed that IE63 interacted with GST-K (lane 4) but not with GST alone (lane 3). Fig.3 C, lane 2, shows the35S-labeling pattern of proteins from WT-infected BHK cells that bound to GST-hnRNP K and reveals labeled bands of appropriate size for IE63 and hnRNP K, present due to its ability to interact with itself, together with other labeled bands that are under investigation. Extracts of BHK cells infected with HSV-1 WT, the IE63 mutant 27-LacZ, or mock-infected were subjected to immunoprecipitation by anti-IE63 or anti-hnRNP K sera. The immunoprecipitated proteins, separated by SDS-PAGE, were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and analyzed by Western blotting using antisera directed against hnRNP K or IE63. Anti-hnRNP K antibodies precipitated hnRNP K from all three extracts (Fig.4 A, lanes 1–3) and IE63 from the WT-infected extract only (Fig.4 B, lane 1); the preimmune serum did not immunoprecipitate hnRNP K or IE63 (Fig. 4, A,lane 4, and B, lane 4). The broad (50-kDa) contaminating bands are due to the heavy chain of the antibody used to immunoprecipitate. The addition of RNase A to immunoprecipitates had no effect on co-immunoprecipitation of IE63 and hnRNP K (data not shown). The predominant form of hnRNP K that was co-immunoprecipitated with IE63 by anti-IE63 serum consistently migrated slightly more rapidly in SDS-PAGE than the hnRNP K precipitated by anti-hnRNP K serum (Fig.4 C, compare lanes 1 and 4). Strikingly, this effect also was reflected in the [35S]methionine labeling pattern (Fig. 4 D) of the Western blot shown in Fig.4 C, where radiolabeled IE63 and hnRNP K bands with identical sizes to those detected on the Western blot with anti-IE63 or anti-hnRNP K sera were detected (Fig.4 D, compare lane 1 withlane 4). Thus, the different mobility forms detected were not caused by differing antibody affinities. When immunoprecipitates obtained with anti-hnRNP K serum were treated with calf intestinal phosphatase, hnRNP K had a similar electrophoretic mobility to the untreated hnRNP K fraction obtained with anti-IE63 serum (data not shown); thus the two hnRNP K fractions may differ in the extent of their phosphorylation. When IE63 502CBD (aa 10–512) was used as bait in the yeast two-hybrid assay, 51 of the 82 positive clones contained inserts with DNA sequences identical to the human"
https://openalex.org/W2076461232,"Sustained activation of most G protein-coupled receptors causes a time-dependent reduction of receptor density in intact cells. This phenomenon, known as down-regulation, is believed to depend on a ligand-promoted change of receptor sorting from the default endosome-plasma membrane recycling pathway to the endosome-lysosome degradation pathway. This model is based on previous studies of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor degradation and implies that receptors need to be endocytosed to be down-regulated.In stable clones of L cells expressing β2-adrenergic receptors (β2ARs), sustained agonist treatment caused a time-dependant decrease in both β2AR binding sites and immuno-detectable receptor. Blocking β2AR endocytosis with chemical treatments or by expressing a dominant negative mutant of dynamin could not prevent this phenomenon. Specific blockers of the two main intracellular degradation pathways, lysosomal and proteasome-associated, were ineffective in preventing β2AR down-regulation. Further evidence for an endocytosis-independent pathway of β2AR down-regulation was provided by studies in A431 cells, a cell line expressing both endogenous β2AR and EGF receptors. In these cells, inhibition of endocytosis and inactivation of the lysosomal degradation pathway did not block β2AR down-regulation, whereas EGF degradation was inhibited. These data indicate that, contrary to what is currently postulated, receptor endocytosis is not a necessary prerequisite for β2AR down-regulation and that the inactivation of β2ARs, leading to a reduction in binding sites, may occur at the plasma membrane.

This phenomenon of hormonal tolerance, also known as desensitization, reflects multiple molecular mechanisms of receptor regulation. For most receptors, the predominant mechanism of desensitization is the phosphorylation-dependent uncoupling from G proteins (1Benovic J.L. Bouvier M. Caron M. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 405-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). For some receptors, such as the m3-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, desensitization is the consequence of receptor endocytosis, which decreases the number of surface receptors that may be activated by the hormone (2Yang J. Williams J.A. Yule D.I. Logsdon C.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 477-485PubMed Google Scholar). Desensitization may also be caused by down-regulation, the ligand-dependent reduction of total receptor number, as in the case of thrombin receptors. Thrombin proteolytic activity cleaves the amino terminus of the receptor, unmasking a new amino-terminal peptide (3Chen J. Ishii M. Wang L. Ishii K. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16041-16045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); this peptide activates the receptor irreversibly, promoting its endocytosis and its subsequent degradation in lysosomes (4Hein L. Ishii K. Coughlin S.R. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27719-27726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Desensitization of β2-adrenergic receptors (β2ARs)1 is mostly dependent on rapid phosphorylation by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase and G protein-coupled receptor kinases (5Benovic J.L. Pike L.J.

Nature. 1988; 333: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). However, although the β2AR is less rapidly affected by down-regulation than the thrombin receptor, long term agonist-promoted β2AR down-regulation significantly contributes to the desensitization and is additive to rapid inactivation resulting from receptor uncoupling (8Nantel F. Bouvier M. Strosberg A.D. Marullo S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 114: 1045-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Supporting the physio-pathological significance of β2AR down-regulation are studies demonstrating that the development of heart failure may be associated with β2AR down-regulation (9Ungerer M. Bohm M. Elce J.S. Erdmann E. Lohse M.J. Circulation. 1993; 87: 454-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). In addition, studies on β2AR polymorphism showed that alleles, which display accelerated ligand-dependent down-regulation in vitro (10Green S.A. Turki J. Innis M. Liggett S.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9414-9419Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar), are associated with altered desensitization to β-adrenergic bronchodilators in asthmatic patients (11Tan S. Hall I.P. Dewar J. Dow E. Lipworth B. Lancet. 1997; 350: 995-999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). β2AR down-regulation involves at least two pathways. The first is the reduction in receptor mRNA steady-state level resulting from destabilization of the transcript (12Hadcock J.R. Malbon C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5021-5025Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 13Bouvier M. Collins S. O'Dowd B.F. Campbell P.T. de Biasi A. Kobilka B.K. MacGregor C. Irons G.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 3223-3229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The consequences of such a phenomenon, however, become apparent only after many hours of sustained activation once the number of pre-existing β2ARs has decreased. The second pathway of β2AR down-regulation is detectable as early as 1 h following receptor activation (15Nantel F. Marullo S. Krief S. Strosberg A.D. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13148-13155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); it consists in the loss of pre-existing ligand binding sites. Based on the observation that, upon removal of agonist, the recovery of β2ARs to control levels requires neosynthesis, it was postulated that the loss of binding sites was the consequence of receptor degradation (16Doss R.C. Perkins J.P. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12281-12286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Morishima I. Thompson W.S. Robison G.A. Strada S.J. Mol.

However, there are no reports in the literature showing that the loss of binding sites is associated with receptor proteolysis. In addition, the processes leading to the accelerated rate of receptor degradation and its topology within the cell have not been established unambiguously. The currently accepted model postulates that β2ARs are degraded following the same mechanism described for EGF and its receptor (19Dunn W.A. Hubbard A.L. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 2148-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 20Renfrew C.A. Hubbard A.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 30340-30346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Upon activation by the agonist, the β2AR cycles between the plasma membrane and endosomes, where receptors are dephosphorylated (22von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3530-3538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Yu S.S. Lefkowitz R.J. Hausdorff W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 337-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Pippig S. Andexinger S. Lohse M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 666-676PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of sustained stimulation by the agonist, β2ARs would not be recycled to the plasma membrane but sorted instead to lysosomes and degraded by lysosomal proteases (25Perkins J.P. Hausdorff W.P. Lefkowitz R.J. Perkins J.P. The β-Adrenergic Receptor. Humana Press Inc., Clifton, NJ1991: 73-124Google Scholar). A key feature of this model is that receptor endocytosis would necessarily constitute an early step in the down-regulation pathway. Consistent with this paradigm, is the observation by Gagnon et al. (26Gagnon A.W. Kallal L. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6976-6981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) that endocytosis and down-regulation of β2ARs may both be inhibited in HEK293 cells by the K44A dominant negative mutant of dynamin, a mutant known to block the “pinching off” of endocytic vesicles. However, the inhibitory effect of dynamin K44A on β2AR down-regulation was not evident in other cell lines (26Gagnon A.W. Kallal L. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6976-6981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In addition, the observation that a cluster of point mutations in the carboxyl-terminal tail of the β2AR almost completely blocks receptor endocytosis without impeding down-regulation challenges the model of receptor down-regulation described above (27Hausdorff W.P. Campbell P.T. Ostrowski J., Yu, S.S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2979-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In the present study we have investigated mechanisms involved in the loss of β2AR binding sites upon sustained activation with the agonist. We show that receptor down-regulation is fully maintained when endocytosis is impeded or when lysosomal or proteasomal functions are blocked. A novel model of receptor down-regulation emerges where the primary inactivation step may occur at the plasma membrane. 125I-CYP was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. (−)-Isoproterenol, (−)-alprenolol,dl-propranolol, bovine serum albumin, E-64, ALLN, ALLM, cycloheximide, concanavalin A, leupeptin, soybean trypsin inhibitor and benzamidine were from Sigma. MG132, concanamycin B, and lactacystin were obtained from Calbiochem. DMEM, RPMI, fetal bovine serum, PBS, trypsin-EDTA, Geneticin (G418), penicillin, and streptomycin were from Life Technologies, Inc. To obtain clonal cell lines expressing the human β2AR, the pBC-HAβ2 plasmid, encoding the hemagglutinin antigen-tagged human β2AR (22von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3530-3538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or the pBC-β2AR, encoding the wild type receptor, were transfected in murine L cells as described previously (28Nantel F. Bonin H. Emorine L.J. Zilberfarb V. Strosberg A.D. Bouvier M. Marullo S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 548-555PubMed Google Scholar). Neomycin-resistant cells were selected in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 4.5 g/liter glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 1 mmglutamine and geneticin at a concentration of 400 mg/liter. Individual clones were screened for β2AR expression by radioligand binding assay using 125I-CYP as the ligand. A fusion β2AR-green fluorescent protein (GFP) cDNA was also constructed by subcloning the β2AR-coding region within the multicloning site located 5′ to the GFP-coding region in the Cytogem Topaze (pGFPtpz-N1) vector (Packard, Meriden, CT). Wild type and K44A dynamin cDNAs subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pCDNA3 were generously provided by Dr. van der Bliek (San Diego, CA). Transient transfections were performed using the DEAE-dextran method. Transfection efficiency was 30–40% as monitored by co-transfecting a GFP-encoding plasmid. For fluorescence studies (see below), L cells were seeded in a 6-well dish containing glass covers 12 h before transfection. A431 cells were grown in RPMI supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1 mm glutamine in a 10% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were placed on ice, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and detached mechanically in ice-cold buffer 1 (5 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, 5 mg/liter soybean trypsin inhibitor, 5 mg/liter leupeptin, and 10 mg/liter benzamidine). Cell suspensions were homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer (Janke & Kunkel Ultra-Turrax T25) three times for 5 s at the maximal setting. The lysate was centrifuged at 450 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 43000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The final pellet was washed twice in buffer 1 and resuspended in 75 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 12.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA with protease inhibitors (as above) and immediately used for radioligand binding experiments or submitted to SDS-PAGE. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford with the Bio-Rad protein assay system using bovine serum albumin as standard. Nearly confluent cells grown as monolayers were washed with PBS, incubated for 5 min with 2% trypsin, EDTA at 37 °C, and resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. The cells were then centrifuged at 450 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Binding assays were carried out using 0.1 ml of cell suspension in PBS. 125I-CYP at 200 pm was used as the radioligand. Specific binding was defined as binding displaced by 10 μmd/l-propranolol. Assays were carried out for 90 min at 25 °C and terminated by rapid filtration through Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters previously soaked in PBS containing 0.3% polyethyleneimine (to reduce nonspecific binding). Protein concentrations were determined on broken cell preparations as above. Endocytosis was determined as reported previously (29Lohse M.J. Benovic J.L. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3202-3209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Jockers R. Da Silva A. Strosberg A.D. Bouvier M. Marullo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9355-9362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) by differential centrifugation and separation of a light vesicle fraction from plasma membranes using a 35% sucrose cushion. A recent study has confirmed that endocytotic vesicle containing internalized β2ARs can efficiently be separated from the plasma membrane fraction using this approach (31Marullo S. Faundez V. Kelly R.B. Recept. Channels. 1999; 6: 255-269PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the endosomal compartment was found to sediment at around 26% sucrose, whereas plasma membrane was found at 35–40% sucrose. The amount of receptor present in each membrane fraction was determined by radioligand binding assay using 125I-CYP as the radioligand. The assay was as described above but using membrane preparations instead of cell suspensions. Chemical inhibition of endocytosis in stable clones expressing β2ARs was performed by potassium depletion (32Larkin J.M. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1983; 33: 273-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), by incubating the cells in hypertonic medium (33Daukas G. Zigmond S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1673-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), by acidification of the cytosol (34Sandvig K. Olsnes S. Petersen O.W. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 679-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), or by incubating cells with concanavalin A (35Lohse M.J. Benovic J.L. Codina J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1547-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in 75-cm2 flasks to 90% confluence. In all cases, protein synthesis was inhibited by the addition of cycloheximide (CHX) to eliminate the contribution of β2AR mRNA regulation to the down-regulation phenomenon. For potassium depletion, cells were washed once with depletion buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.14 m NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 4.5 g/literd-glucose). Subsequently, cells were incubated for 5 min in depletion buffer/H2O (1:1). Next, cells were incubated for 150 min in depletion buffer supplemented with CHX (5 μg/ml). During the last 120 min isoproterenol (10 μm final concentration) was added or not. Control cells were incubated under the same conditions but with 10 mm KCl added to the buffer. Inhibition of endocytosis by hypertonic shock was performed in maintaining cells in hypertonic medium (DMEM, 4.5 g/literd-glucose, 10% fetal calf serum, and 0.5 msucrose). Cells were washed once in hypertonic medium and incubated for 150 min in this medium supplemented with CHX (5 μg/ml). During the last 120 min, isoproterenol (10 μm final concentration) was added or not. For inhibition of endocytosis by cytosol acidification, cells were incubated for 150 min in DMEM, pH 5.0, 4.5 g/liter d-glucose, 10% fetal calf serum, 10 mmacetic acid, and CHX (5 μg/ml). During the last 120 min isoproterenol (10 μm final concentration) was added or not. Control cells were incubated under the same conditions but without acetic acid. Incubation in the presence of concanavalin A (0.25 mg/ml) was carried out for 150 min in DMEM, pH 5.0, 4.5 g/liter d-glucose, 10% fetal calf serum, and CHX (5 μg/ml). During the last 120 min isoproterenol (10 μm final concentration) was added or not. Inhibition of endocytosis was also measured in cells transiently co-transfected with plasmids encoding HAβ2AR and K44A dynamin 48–72 h after transfection. Wild type dynamin was used instead of the K44A mutant in control experiments. Three days after transfection with the β2AR-GFP construct, cells were subjected to various treatments aimed to inhibit receptor internalization. Inhibition of endocytosis by hypertonic shock, by potassium depletion, or by the incubation with concanavalin A was carried out as described above. After treatment, cells were washed in ice-cold PBS and fixed for 20 min at room temperature in a fresh solution of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Coverslips were then mounted on microscope slide. Fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Zeiss Axioskop equipped with a mercury 100-watt lamp (AttoArc HBO 100). Pictures were taken using a CCD camera (Zeiss). Agonist-induced redistribution of HA-epitope-tagged β2ARs (HA-β2AR) was determined using fluorescence-assisted cell sorting (FACS). Briefly, L cells were seeded in a 6-well plate the day before the experiment. After appropriate treatments, plates were kept on ice and washed twice with PBS. Cells were then incubated with a 1/100 dilution of the anti-HA 3F10 antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 45 min, followed by an incubation with an anti-rat IgG coupled to Oregon green (dilution 1/500, Molecular Probes). Cells were detached with 5 mm EDTA, fixed with paraformaldehyde, and analyzed by FACS. Various compounds interfering with the lysosomal pathway and/or the proteasome degradation pathway were added to the cell culture medium 1 h before the incubation with isoproterenol and maintained in the medium throughout the experiment: concanamycin B (100 nm), NH4Cl (10 mm), E-64 (1 mm), leupeptin (1 mm), chloroquine (0.1 mm), MG132 (50 μm), ALLN (100 μm), ALLM (100 μm), lactacystin (10 μm). Membranes prepared from cells expressing the HA-β2AR were denatured in 62.5 mm Tris/HCl (pH 6.8), 5% SDS, 3% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue for 3 h at 37 °C. Seventy μg of proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Immunoblot analysis was carried out with the monoclonal HA-specific 3F10 antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, 250 ng/ml). As a control for the inhibition of the proteasome-dependent degradation pathway (36Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar), β-catenin immunoreactivity was measured on whole cell extract using rabbit polyclonal antibodies to β-catenin (Sigma) after SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose. Immunoreactivity was revealed using appropriate secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase and the ECL chemiluminescent reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Autoradiograms were digitalized using a CCD camera, and the densitometric analysis of the images were carried out with the NIH Image 1.6 software. The EGF degradation assay was performed as described previously (37Futter C.E. Pearse A. Hewlett L.J. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1011-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. A431 cells were plated in 12-well culture dishes and serum-starved in RPMI supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin 24 before the experiments. Cells were then incubated with 0.5 nm125I-EGF for 1 h at 15 °C in RPMI containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin with or without the appropriate inhibitors. Leupeptin was added 24 h before the experiments. For K+-depletion experiments, the depletion buffer described above replaced RPMI. After the incubation, plates were chilled on ice, and cells were washed three times with ice-cold buffer. Plates were then shifted to 37 °C for various periods of time. Supernatants were collected, mixed with the same volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid in RPMI, and incubated on ice for 2 h. Cells were lysed by a 2-h incubation in 1 m NaOH. After centrifugation of trichloroacetic acid precipitates, pellets, supernatants, and cell lysates were counted separately. The fraction of degraded125I-EGF was determined by calculating the ratio between the radioactivity remaining in the supernatant after trichloroacetic acid precipitation and total radioactive load (sum of radioactivity values in supernatant, pellet, and cell lysate). To investigate the molecular basis of β2AR down-regulation, stable clones of L cells expressing physiological levels (100–200 fmol) of receptor were studied in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor CHX. The decay of receptor number was assessed in cells treated or not with the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol. Because new protein synthesis is inhibited in both control and isoproterenol-treated cells, any effect of agonist treatment on whole cell receptor density has to be attributed to down-regulation of pre-existing receptor and not to mRNA regulation. Treatment of cells with CHX induced a time-dependent decrease in the number of β2ARs detected in whole cell binding assay using the membrane-permeable radioligand 125I-CYP (Fig.1). This decay was biphasic with a rapid component between 0 and 6 h and a much slower component between 6 and 24 h. The occurrence of the second slow phase might result from the progressive disappearance of a short-lived process implicated in the degradation of the receptor as a result of protein synthesis inhibition. Treatment with isoproterenol considerably steepened the first component of the β2AR decay curve, consistent with previous studies (15Nantel F. Marullo S. Krief S. Strosberg A.D. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13148-13155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and with the model in which sustained agonist treatment increases the β2AR degradation rate. Although indirect evidence that the decay of β2AR number upon sustained agonist activation is the consequence of receptor degradation exists (16Doss R.C. Perkins J.P. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12281-12286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Morishima I. Thompson W.S. Robison G.A. Strada S.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1980; 18: 370-378PubMed Google Scholar, 18Waldo G.L. Doss R.C. Perkins J.P. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 26: 424-429PubMed Google Scholar), this phenomenon has not been directly documented so far, mostly because high affinity and low background anti-β2AR antibodies were not available. We have used anti-HA epitope antibodies to quantify the HA-epitope-tagged receptor (HA-β2AR) expressed in L cells by immunoblot on membranes prepared from cells incubated for various periods of time with isoproterenol (Fig. 2). The 3F10 anti-HA-epitope monoclonal antibody recognized tagged receptors specifically, as shown by the absence of background on membranes prepared from L cells expressing nontagged wild type receptors (Fig.2 A). A decrease of immunoreactive material was evident in cells treated for various periods of time with isoproterenol (Fig.2 B), consistent with agonist-induced receptor proteolysis. We could not visualize any low molecular weight fragment of the receptor containing the HA epitope that could correspond to a specific proteolytic fragment. Possible explanations are that the amino-terminal portion of the receptor was cleaved and released from the rest of the molecule or that the complete proteolysis of the receptor is achieved with a very fast kinetics. Despite a general parallelism between the loss of binding sites and of receptor immunoreactivity, the decay of immunoreactive material appeared to be slightly slower than the loss of binding sites. We thus analyzed this decay in more detail during the first 6 h of exposure to isoproterenol and measured the loss of 125I-CYP binding sites in the same preparations (Fig. 2 C). These experiments confirmed that the loss of binding sites was faster than that of immunoreactive material during the first 2 h of agonist stimulation. A plausible explanation for this discrepancy could be that some immunoreactive receptors do not bind to the radioligand, thus slowing down the detection of the receptor protein decay. To confirm this hypothesis, total membranes were prepared from unstimulated cells and separated in plasma and light membrane fractions by centrifugation on a sucrose cushion (Fig. 2 D). For each fraction, the ratio between bound 125I-CYP and immunoreactivity was calculated. This ratio was four times higher in the plasma membrane fraction than in the light membrane fraction, indicating the existence of a pool of apparently mature and glycosylated intracellular receptors unable to bind the ligand. This pool of receptors may be responsible for the apparent discrepancy between the loss of binding and that of immunoreactivity. The observation that the proportions of down-regulated receptors measured with the 2 approaches coincided after 4 h of isoproterenol stimulation suggests that these intracellular receptors may be exported to the plasma membrane and become competent for ligand binding. Taken together, our results are consistent with the current hypothesis that β2AR down-regulation is accompanied by a loss of receptor protein resulting from a proteolytic degradation of the receptor. According to the current model of receptor regulation, endocytosis is viewed as an early and necessary step in the down-regulation of β2ARs. If this model is true, one would expect that down-regulation does not occur when receptor endocytosis is blocked. Various treatments such as potassium depletion, cytosol acidification, and incubation with high sucrose concentrations (24Pippig S. Andexinger S. Lohse M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 666-676PubMed Google Scholar, 38Raposo G. Dunia I. Delavier-Klutchko C. Kaveri S. Strosberg A.D. Benedetti L. Eur J. Cell Biol. 1989; 50: 340-352PubMed Google Scholar) are known to block β2AR endocytosis, probably by interfering with the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles (39Hansen S.H. Sandvig K. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Incubation with lectins that bind to the sugar moiety of the β2AR, such as concanavalin A, also block receptor internalization (24Pippig S. Andexinger S. Lohse M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 666-676PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether blocking endocytosis would also affect β2AR down-regulation, both phenomena were studied in untreated control cells and cells treated with endocytosis blockers mentioned above. Endocytosis was determined by measuring the proportion of receptors translocated from the plasma membrane to light density endocytic compartment (see “Experimental Procedures”), whereas the decay of total 125I-CYP binding sites was used to monitor β2AR down-regulation. All experiments were carried out in the presence of CHX,"

The conserved helix 2/helix 7 microdomain was identified because the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor appears to have interchanged the Asp2.50 and Asn7.49 residues which are conserved in transmembrane helices 2 and 7 of rhodopsin-like GPCRs. We now demonstrate that different side chains of this microdomain contribute specifically to receptor expression, heterotrimeric G protein-, and small G protein-mediated signaling.

Most GPCRs require an Asp side chain at either the helix 2 or helix 7 locus of the microdomain for coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins, but the GnRH receptor has transferred the requirement for an acidic residue from helix 2 to 7. However, the presence of Asp at the helix 7 locus precludes small G protein-dependent coupling to phospholipase D.

This family includes the light-sensitive opsins, protease-activated receptors, and receptors for neurotransmitters, peptides, and glycoproteins. High resolution structural data have not yet been obtained for any GPCR. However, projection maps of rhodopsin, amino acid sequence alignment, and computational modeling indicate that GPCRs have 7 membrane-spanning α-helices (2Baldwin J.M.

There is a high degree of homology within the transmembrane helices and certain amino acids are highly conserved throughout the family (2Baldwin J.M.

This diverse family shares the common function of propagating a signal across lipid membranes and the amino acid side chains which are conserved among the GPCRs are likely to constitute key structural motifs which subserve this universal GPCR function. Several models of GPCRs, including the GnRH receptor (4Ballesteros J. Kitanovic S. Guarnieri F. Davies P. Fromme B.J. Konvicka K. Chi L. Millar R.P. Davidson J.S. Weinstein H. Sealfon S.C. J. Biol.

Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 165-170PubMed Google Scholar), have been constructed as aids for investigating receptor structure-function relations. Molecular models of GPCRs can be used to integrate experimental observations and generate structural hypotheses. However, the complexity of these structures and the limited number of experimentally determined constraints can lead to inconsistent behavior of the models (4Ballesteros J. Kitanovic S. Guarnieri F. Davies P. Fromme B.J. Konvicka K. Chi L. Millar R.P. Davidson J.S. Weinstein H. Sealfon S.C. J. Biol.

Methods Neurosci. 1995; 25: 366-428Crossref Scopus (2504) Google Scholar). To overcome these limitations, we have pursued the approach of identifying discrete structural motifs within receptor models, which might constitute functional microdomains. The microdomains are characterized in detail and subsequently incorporated into whole receptor models. In the GnRH receptor, for example, this approach has recently been used to propose that the motion of the conserved Arg3.50(139) side chain is restricted by interaction with the conserved Asp3.49(138) and the presence of a β-branched, hydrophobic residue, Ile3.54(143) (see “Experimental Procedures” for a description of the amino acid numbering scheme). Incorporation of this microdomain into the whole receptor model suggests that receptor activation is accompanied by repositioning of the Arg3.50(139) side chain, allowing it to interact with the Asp7.49(318) side chain in transmembrane helix 7 (H7) in the activated receptor conformation (4Ballesteros J. Kitanovic S. Guarnieri F. Davies P. Fromme B.J. Konvicka K. Chi L. Millar R.P. Davidson J.S. Weinstein H. Sealfon S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10445-10453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). A related GPCR structural motif consists of this H7 side chain (usually Asn7.49) and the conserved 2.50 residue (usually Asp) in H2. The H2/H7 microdomain was originally identified from the apparent interchange of these side chains in the GnRH receptor and its functional importance was supported by reciprocal mutagenesis studies (8Zhou W. Flanagan C. Ballesteros J.A. Konvicka K. Davidson J.S. Weinstein H. Millar R.P. Sealfon S.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 165-170PubMed Google Scholar).

Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 783-789PubMed Google Scholar). The initial study of this microdomain in the GnRH receptor reported that the presence of an Asp residue in both loci eliminated detectable binding. This result raised the possibility that charge repulsion was responsible for the observed phenotype. However, the presence of Asp at both positions in wild-type non-mammalian GnRH receptors (15Blomenrohr M. Bogerd J. Leurs R. Schulz R.W. Tensen C.P. Zandbergen M.A. Goos H.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

For a specific receptor, the side chains of the H2/H7 microdomain may contribute to receptor expression and receptor activation and coupling to intracellular signal transduction. The molecular events that underlie receptor activation are a key question in understanding receptor function. Studies of many receptors have implicated the H2/H7 microdomain as a key component of this process (9Sealfon S.C. Chi L. Ebersole B.J. Rodic V. Zhang D. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16683-16688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 10Perlman J.H. Colson A.-O. Wang W. Bence K. Osman R. Gershengorn M.C. J. Biol.

J. 1998; 75: 601-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The involvement of this domain in multiple distinct receptor functions may account for the different results observed in the various receptors studied. The side chain at the 7.49 locus has also recently been implicated in specifying small G protein-dependent coupling to PLD (19Mitchell R. McCulloch D. Lutz E. Johnson M. MacKenzie C. Fennell M. Fink G. Zhou W. Sealfon S. Nature. 1998; 392: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In order to elucidate the role of this microdomain in the GnRH receptor, we have investigated the functional requirements of each locus in receptor expression, coupling to heterotrimeric G protein-dependent signal transduction, and coupling to the small G protein, ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF). To allow comparison of equivalent residues in different GPCRs, amino acids in the transmembrane segments of the GnRH receptor are numbered relative to the most conserved residue of the rhodopsin-like GPCRs, as described previously (7Ballesteros J. Weinstein W. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 25: 366-428Crossref Scopus (2504) Google Scholar). Thus, Asn87, which is located in the position of the most conserved residue in H2, is designated Asn2.50(87), while Asp318, which is adjacent to the most conserved residue in H7 (Pro7.50(319)), is designated Asp7.49(318). The mutations N2.50(87)D, N2.50(87)Q, N2.50(87)A, D7.49(318)N, D7.49(318)E, and D7.49(318)A were introduced into the mouse GnRH receptor as described previously (8Zhou W. Flanagan C. Ballesteros J.A. Konvicka K. Davidson J.S. Weinstein H. Millar R.P. Sealfon S.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 165-170PubMed Google Scholar) using the Altered Sites Mutagenesis System (Promega, Madison, WI), while the mutations N1.50(53)A, N1.50(53)D, N1.50(53)L, and D7.49(318)L were generated using QuikChange (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Two epitope tags were applied to the GnRH receptor to allow detection of the receptor by Western blotting. An amino-terminal HA-tag (YPYDVPDYA) was inserted after the initial Met residue of the wild-type GnRH receptor by polymerase chain reaction. Since the mouse GnRH receptor does not have a cytosolic carboxyl-terminal domain, a carboxyl-terminal domain derived from a putative human type II GnRH receptor (20Millar R. Conklin D. Lofton-Day C. Hutchinson E. Troskie B. Illing N. Sealfon S.C. Hapgood J. J. Endocrinol. 1999; 162: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) was appended to allow addition of a carboxyl-terminal hexahistidine tag using a combination of polymerase chain reaction and multifragment subcloning into the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The carboxyl-terminal seven amino acids of the carboxyl-terminal domain were substituted with six histidine residues to generate a hexahistidine tag. All DNA constructs were sequenced to confirm the presence of mutations and epitope tags. COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and transfected as described previously, using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) (21Zhou W. Rodic V. Kitanovic S. Flanagan C.A. Chi L. Weinstein H. Maayani S. Millar R.P. Sealfon S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18853-18857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Cells to be used for intact cell functional assays were seeded into 12- or 24-well plates the day after transfection. [d-Ala6,Pro9-NHEt]GnRH (GnRH-A, Bachem, Torrance, CA), was radioiodinated using IODO-GEN (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL) following published protocols (22Laws S.C. Beggs M.J. Webster J.C. Miller W.L. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Whole cell binding assays were performed as described (23Sealfon S. Zhou W. Almaula N. Rodic V. Methods Neurosci. 1996; 29: 143-196Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected cells, in 24-well plates, were incubated for at least 2 h at 4 °C with 125I-GnRH-A (60,000 cpm/well) and varying concentrations of unlabeled GnRH-A or GnRH (Bachem, Torrance, CA) in a total volume of 0.4 ml/well. The incubation was terminated by removal of the medium and bound radioactivity was collected in 1m NaOH. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10−7m unlabeled GnRH-A. Membrane binding assays were performed as described previously (24Millar R.P. Davidson J. Flanagan C.A. Wakefield I. Methods in Neurosciences, Receptor Molecular Biology. Academic Press, San Diego1995: 145-162Google Scholar) on some low-expressing constructs because this method makes it possible to increase receptor concentration in the assay by varying the amount of membrane added to incubation tubes. Cell membranes were resuspended in protein-free binding buffer (1 mm EDTA, 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.5) and incubated for 90 min on ice with125I-GnRH-A (200,000 cpm), 0.1% bovine serum albumin and varying concentrations of GnRH-A. The reaction was terminated by filtration through GF/C filters (Brandel Inc., Gaithersberg, MD) which were presoaked in binding buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin, and washed twice with binding buffer. Transfected cells (9-cm dishes) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline prior to harvesting and homogenization in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 500 ×g and 4 °C and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The membrane pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (30 μl/3 × 106 transfected cells) and solubilized by gentle shaking for 15 min on ice in the presence of CHAPS at a final concentration of 15 mm. The solubilization mixture was centrifuged for 30 min at 35,000 × g and 4 °C to remove particulate material, and the resulting supernatant was incubated withN-glycosidase F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN, 0.2 units per 20 μl of supernatant) for 30 min at 37 °C. Samples were electrophoresed under reducing conditions on NuPAGE polyacrylamide gels (Novex, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond C Pure, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the presence of 0.04% SDS. Blots were blocked for at least 1 h in blot buffer (5% non-fat dry milk, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) before incubation overnight in Tetra-His antibody (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, 0.2 μg/ml in blot buffer). Bound antibody was detected using the ECL Western blotting kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Accumulation of inositol phosphates (IP) in the presence of Li+ was determined according to published protocols (25Berg K.A. Clarke W.P. Sailstad C. Saltzman A. Maayani S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 477-484PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected cells were labeled for 16 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol (NEN Life Science Products, North Billerica, MA). After washing with serum-free medium the cells were incubated for 45 min at 37 °C with varying concentrations of GnRH in the presence of 20 mm LiCl. The incubation was terminated by removal of the medium and addition of 10 mm formic acid. [3H]IP was separated from the formic acid extracts on Dowex-1 ion-exchange columns and eluted with 1m ammonium formate and 0.1 m formic acid. Activation of PLD was determined by a transphosphatidylation assay as described previously (26Mitchell R. Wolbers W.B. Sim P. Fennell M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 208SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected cells in 12-well plates were labeled overnight with [3H]palmitate in serum-free minimum essential medium. After washing with minimal essential medium containing HEPES (25 mm, pH 7.5) and 1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, cells were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C with various concentrations of brefeldin A (BFA) in HEPES-buffered minimal essential medium with 0.5% bovine serum albumin, before addition of butan-1-ol (30 mm) and GnRH (1 μm) and incubation for a further 30 min. Reactions were terminated by removal of the medium and addition of 0.5 ml of cold methanol to each well. Phospholipids were extracted and separated on Whatman LK5D thin layer chromatography plates as described (26Mitchell R. Wolbers W.B. Sim P. Fennell M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 208SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). K d andB max values for binding of GnRH-A were determined using the LIGAND computer program (27Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar). Protein levels were determined by the Lowry method. IC50 (concentration required for 50% inhibition of 125I-GnRH-A binding) values for GnRH were estimated using nonlinear curve fitting (KaleidaGraph, Synergy Software, Reading, PA). EC50 (agonist concentration required for half-maximal response) values for IP production were calculated using KaleidaGraph. IP data were fitted to the equationE = E max/(1 + EC50/D), where the E maxis the maximum IP accumulation and D is the concentration of the agonist. Transient transfection of the wild-type GnRH receptor into COS-1 cells leads to expression of an appreciable level of “spare receptors” which results in an EC50 for IP accumulation that is significantly lower than the K d for GnRH binding to the receptor (21Zhou W. Rodic V. Kitanovic S. Flanagan C.A. Chi L. Weinstein H. Maayani S. Millar R.P. Sealfon S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18853-18857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Because of the receptor reserve in the wild-type receptor and the varied expression levels of the mutant receptors, simple comparison of maximal IP accumulation does not yield an accurate measure of how well a particular receptor is activated. To facilitate comparison of mutant receptor activation, we have utilized a previously derived expression of receptor coupling efficiency,Q, which is defined as: Q = 0.5 × [(K d + EC50)/EC50] × (E max/B max) (4Ballesteros J.

The effects of amino acid substitutions at each locus of the H2/H7 microdomain were studied. The substitutions introduced for Asn2.50(87) (Gln, Asp, and Ala) were designed to test the effects of altered size, charge, and polarity on receptor function. None of the single H2 mutant constructs studied exhibited detectable ligand binding activity, IP accumulation, or ARF-dependent accumulation of phosphatidyl butanol (PtdBut) (Table I).Table ISummary of ligand binding, immunoblot, IP accumulation, and PtdBut accumulation assays in mutant GnRH receptorsConstructLigand bindingImmunoblotIP accumulationPtdBut, maximum BFA-inhibitableB maxK d, GnRH-AIC50, GnRHIP maxEC50, GnRHCoupling efficiencyfmol/mg proteinnmnmrelative intensity% wtnm% wt-fold basalWild-type582 ± 1351.2 ± 0.620 ± 15++++1000.85 ± 0.46100−1.6 ± 1.5N2.50(87)DUndaConstructs in which total binding was too low to estimate B max are reported as undetectable.+−−1.5 ± 0.70.4 ± 0.5N2.50(87)QUnd+−2.2 ± 0.7−0.4 ± 0.4N2.50(87)AUnd+−0.1 ± 0.50.1 ± 0.4N2.50(87)D/D7.49(318)N170 ± 461.3 ± 0.7732 ± 20+++11.7 ± 4.530 ± 183.33.2 ± 0.6D7.49(318)N386 ± 420.97 ± 0.2327 ± 18+++38.9 ± 11.745 ± 293.84.7 ± 0.6D7.49(318)E30 ± 32.3 ± 1.433 ± 7++36.6 ± 6.520 ± 1076.70.3 ± 1.0D7.49(318)A610 ± 1560.71 ± 0.2222 ± 14+++12.0 ± 0.142 ± 180.70.1 ± 0.7 D7.49(318)LUnd++3.6 ± 0.2N1.50(53)DUnd+−4.3 ± 3.3N1.50(53)AUnd+−4.3 ± 4.1N1.50(53)LUnd+−8.5 ± 1.6N1.50(53)D/D7.49(318)NUnd1.6bn = 1.Ligand binding parameters were determined from competition binding assays using 125I-GnRH-A as tracer.

To determine whether the lack of ligand binding by the H2 mutants resulted from altered receptor expression, we utilized an immunoblot assay of epitope-tagged receptor constructs. The parent epitope-tagged construct had an amino-terminal HA-tag and a carboxyl-terminal domain with a hexahistidine tag (see “Experimental Procedures”). The effects of epitope tagging on receptor function were evaluated. All H2 and H7 mutant constructs were epitope-tagged and tested in ligand binding and IP accumulation assays. The tagged wild-type and mutant receptors mediated IP accumulation with EC50 values which were comparable to those of corresponding untagged receptors. For all constructs with measurable ligand binding, K d values were unchanged and B max values elevated with epitope tagging. As was observed for the untagged receptors, ligand binding was not detectable in the epitope-tagged N2.50(87)D and N2.50(87)A constructs (Table II). The epitope-tagged N2.50(87)Q construct exhibited low, but measurable ligand binding (Table II). This tagged construct also mediated a low level of GnRH-stimulated IP accumulation (not shown). The relative receptor expression, as measured by ligand binding, and the function of the tagged receptors closely paralleled that of the untagged receptors, thus validating the use of the tagged receptors in protein expression assays.Table IILigand binding of epitope-tagged GnRH receptors with mutations in H2ConstructMaximum specific bindingIC50, GnRH-Afmol/mg proteinnmWild type86.5 ± 10.90.91 ± 0.05Tagged wild type226.3 ± 27.31.06 ± 0.09Tagged N2.50(87)D1.78 ± 0.08Tagged N2.50(87)Q9.3 ± 2.21.23 ± 0.03Tagged N2.50(87)A0.05 ± 0.25pcDNA30.38 ± 0.44Membranes prepared from COS-1 cells transfected with wild-type and epitope-tagged wild-type and mutant GnRH receptors were incubated with125I-GnRH-A (200,000 cpm) and increasing concentrations of unlabeled GnRH-A.

https://openalex.org/W1991787267,"The chemical mechanism by which ATP synthases catalyze the synthesis of ATP remains unknown despite the recent elucidation of the three-dimensional structures of two forms of the F(1) catalytic sector (subunit stoichiometry, alpha(3)beta(3)gammadeltaepsilon). Lacking is critical information about the chemical events taking place at the catalytic site of each beta-subunit in the transition state. In an earlier report (Ko, Y. H., Bianchet, M. A., Amzel, L.M., and Pedersen, P. L. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 18875-18881), we provided evidence for transition state formation in the presence of Mg(2+), ADP, and orthovanadate (V(i)), a photoreactive phosphate analog with a trigonal bipyramidal geometry resembling that of the gamma-P of ATP in the transition state of enzymes like myosin. In the presence of ultraviolet light and O(2,) the MgADP.V(i)-F(1) complex was cleaved within the P-loop (GGAGVGKT) of a single beta-subunit at alanine 158, implicating this residue as within contact distance of the gamma-P of ATP in the transition state. Here, we report that ADP, although facilitating transition state formation, is not essential. In the presence of Mg(2+) and V(i) alone the catalytic activity of the resultant MgV(i)-F(1) complex is inhibited to nearly the same extent as that observed for the MgADP. V(i)-F(1) complex. Inhibition is not observed with ADP, Mg(2+), or V(i) alone. Significantly, in the presence of ultraviolet light and O(2,) the MgV(i)-F(1) complex is cleaved also within the P-loop of a single beta-subunit at alanine 158 as confirmed by Western blot analyses with two different antibodies, by N-terminal sequence analyses, and by quantification of the amount of unreacted beta-subunits. These novel findings indicate that Mg(2+) plays a pivotal role in transition state formation during ATP synthesis catalyzed by ATP synthases, a role that involves both its preferential coordination with P(i) and the repositioning of the P-loop to bring the nonpolar alanine 158 into the catalytic pocket. A reaction scheme for ATP synthases depicting a role for Mg(2+) in transition state formation is proposed here for the first time."
https://openalex.org/W2045471846,"Amino acid starvation markedly stimulates the activity of system A, a widely distributed transport route for neutral amino acids. The involvement of MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathways in this adaptive increase of transport activity was studied in cultured human fibroblasts. In these cells, a 3-fold stimulation of system A transport activity required a 6-h amino acid-free incubation. However, a rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK (extracellular regulated kinase) 1 and 2, and JNK (Jun N-terminal kinase) 1, but not of p38, was observed after the substitution of complete medium with amino acid-free saline solution. ERK1/2 activity was 4-fold enhanced after a 15-min amino acid-free incubation and maintained at stimulated values thereafter. A transient, less evident stimulation of JNK1 activity was also detected, while the activity of p38 was not affected by amino acid deprivation. PD98059, an inhibitor of ERK1/2 activation, completely suppressed the adaptive increase of system A transport activity that, conversely, was unaffected by inhibitors of other transduction pathways, such as rapamycin and wortmannin, as well as by chronic treatment with phorbol esters. In the presence of either L-proline or 2-(methylaminoisobutyric) acid, two substrates of system A, the transport increase was prevented and no sustained stimulation of ERK1/2 was observed. To identify the stimulus that maintains MAPK activation, cell volume was monitored during amino acid-free incubation. It was found that amino acid deprivation caused a progressive cell shrinkage (30% after a 6-h starvation). If proline was added to amino acid-starved, shrunken cells, normal values of cell volume were rapidly restored. However, proline-dependent volume rescue was hampered if cells were pretreated with PD98059. It is concluded that (a) the triggering of adaptive increase of system A activity requires a prolonged activation of ERK1 and 2 and that (b) cell volume changes, caused by the depletion of intracellular amino acid pool, may underlie the activation of MAPKs."

This is particularly true when the response involves activating one of the many protein kinases, such as a member of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)1 family. The PKAs usually exist as inactive tetramers containing a regulatory (R) subunit dimer and two catalytic subunits, and genes encoding four R subunits and three catalytic subunits have been identified (1Takio K.

The type I (RI) α and type II (RII) α subunits are distributed ubiquitously, whereas RIβ and RIIβ are present mainly in brain. Many hormones and other signals act through receptors to generate cAMP that binds to the R subunits of PKA, thereby releasing and activating the catalytic subunits to phosphorylate proteins. The way cells produce a localized response to cAMP has been determined for some PKAs. They are tethered through their RII dimer to protein kinase A anchoring proteins (AKAPs) that place them in close proximity to specific organelles or cytoskeletal components (5Scott J.D. Stofko R.E.

The 10–14 residues comprising RII anchoring domains of AKAPs vary substantially in primary sequence, but secondary structure predictions indicate they are likely to form an amphipathic helix (7Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D. Bishop S.M. Acott T.S. Brennan R.G. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14188-14192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Carr D.W. Hausken Z.E. Fraser I.D.

Analysis of the domain on AKAP75 by Ala-scanning mutagenesis suggested that hydrophobic amino acids with a long aliphatic side chain (e.g. Val, Leu, or Ile) participate in the binding to RII (9Glantz S.B.

NMR studies of the RIIα dimerization/docking domain suggested that a hydrophobic surface associates with the amphipathic helix on AKAP Ht31 (10Newlon M.G. Roy M. Morikis D. Hausken Z.E. Coghlan V.

Overlay assays failed to detect binding by other PKA subunits to AKAPs, but indirect evidence suggested that RIα could bind to AKAPs. Comparison of the dimerization/docking domains of RIα and RII indicated striking similarities (14Newlon M.G. Roy M. Hausken Z.E. Scott J.D. Jennings P.A. J. Biol.

The first direct evidence of RI binding to an AKAP was found in recent studies that identified RIα-specific and RIα/RIIα dual specificity PKA anchoring domains on FSC1/AKAP82 (24Miki K. Eddy E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34384-34390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Deletion mutagenesis and yeast two-hybrid assays were used to map the RIα-specific domain to a 10-amino acid sequence likely to form an amphipathic helix. It has little significant sequence homology to RII anchoring domains and a low content of hydrophobic amino acids with a long aliphatic side chain. The binding of RIα was not affected by substitution of Ser for Val339, the only hydrophobic amino acid with a long aliphatic side chain in the RIα-specific domain. The sequences flanking the 10 amino acids of this domain were not essential for RIα binding in the yeast two-hybrid system, strongly suggesting that the domain contains all of the information necessary to confer RIα-specific binding (24Miki K. Eddy E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34384-34390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The RIα/RIIα dual specificity domain mapped to a 14-amino acid sequence that contains 5 hydrophobic amino acids with a long aliphatic side chain, residues which frequently appear in RII anchoring domains (24Miki K. Eddy E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34384-34390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The demonstration that RIα could tether PKA to RIα-specific or RIα/RIIα dual specificity domains raised important questions about the primary and secondary structural features that determine the nature and specificity of PKA anchoring domains on AKAPs. The present studies used scanning mutagenesis of the RIα-specific domain of FSC1/AKAP82 (domain B) and the putative RII-specific domain of Ht31 to demonstrate that single amino acid residues in these domains determine RI and RII binding specificity. Furthermore, point mutations introduced into the RIα/RIIα dual specificity domain of FSC1/AKAP82 (domain A) converted it into an RI or RII preferential binding domain. These results lead us to propose that the degree and specificity of PKA binding to anchoring domains on AKAPs are determined by the size of the aliphatic side chain at a consensus position within the amphipathic helix. The Ht31(GenBankTM accession number, M90360) fragment (residues 418–540) containing the RII anchoring domain was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using a 5′-primer containing aBamHI site (CCGGGATCCATGGGTGACGCTGAGGAAGCCCA), a 3′-primer containing a SalI site (CCGGTCGACTCTCTAGTCCTTTAGTGAGAGGAC), and the HT31 cDNA cloned in pET 11d (gift of Dr. Daniel W. Carr, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Portland, OR) as a template (24Miki K. Eddy E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34384-34390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The reaction products were digested withBamHI and SalI, ligated into plasmid pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) digested with BamHI andSalI, and then transformed in Escherichia coliDH5α-competent cells (Life Technologies, Inc.). This plasmid and pGEX plasmids containing FSC1 coding sequence residues 202–334 or 237–361 (24Miki K. Eddy E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34384-34390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) were used as templates to introduce point mutations using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Numbering of the amino acid sequence of FSC1 was that of Fulcheret al. (25Fulcher K.D. Mori C. Welch J.E. O'Brien D.A. Klapper D.G. Eddy E.M. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 52: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Sequencing of the targeted sites was carried out using a dRhodamine Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (PE Biosystems) to verify that the correct mutations occurred. The pull-down experiments using glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the glutathione S-transferase (GST) expression tag system were performed as described previously (24Miki K. Eddy E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34384-34390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) with the following minor changes. Testis crude extracts corresponding to 1.5 mg of protein were used for incubation with GST-FSC1 or GST-Ht31 fusion proteins immobilized on resin. Each lane of the gels received 0.5 mg of protein from the testis extracts that bound to GST-FSC1 or GST-Ht31, whereas control lanes received 5 μg of total testis extract protein. Regulatory subunits of PKA were detected by Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody against mouse RIα (1:250 dilution; Transduction Laboratories, catalog number P19920) or a rabbit antiserum to mouse RIIα (1:1000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number sc-909). Secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antiserum to mouse IgG (1:30000 dilution; Sigma) or goat antiserum to rabbit IgG (1:30000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). All other procedures for Western blotting and chemiluminescence were performed as described previously (24Miki K. Eddy E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34384-34390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The Ht31 fragment (residue 418–540) containing the RII anchoring domain was amplified as described above except the 5′-primer contained an EcoRI site (CCGGAATTCATGGGTGACGCTGAGGAAGCCCAAAT) instead of a BamHI site. The reaction products were digested with EcoRI andSalI, ligated into plasmid pAS2-1 (CLONTECH) digested with EcoRI andSalI, and then transformed in E. coliDH5α-competent cells (Life Technologies, Inc.). The yeast two-hybrid system was used for analysis of interactions between an Ht31 fragment containing the RII anchoring domain and a full-length RIα sequence (FC9) cloned into pGAD10 (CLONTECH) as described before (24Miki K. Eddy E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34384-34390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Transactivation of his3 and lacZ was used for the detection of protein-protein interaction. RII binding is believed to occur by forming hydrophobic interactions (15León D.A. Herberg F.W. Banky P. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28431-28437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and domain B of FSC1/AKAP82 has similarities to RII binding domains of other AKAPs. However, the only hydrophobic amino acid present with a long aliphatic side chain (Val339) is not necessary for RIα binding (24Miki K. Eddy E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34384-34390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that other hydrophobic amino acids in domain B (Ala, Tyr, and Met) are used to form the amphipathic helix and are involved in RIα binding. This was tested using in vitro pull-down assays in conjunction with Val-scanning and Ala-scanning mutagenesis. These substitutions were made for each hydrophobic amino acid in domain B except Met344, where Ile was introduced. GST-FSC1 fusion proteins (residues 237–361) containing each mutation were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose resin and incubated with crude extracts of testis to determine if they bound RIα or RIIα. RIα binding to domain B was lost or reduced with Y335V, A336V, and A340V mutations but retained with M343V/M344I double mutations (Fig.1 a). Alanine-scanning mutagenesis done in parallel resulted in loss of RIα binding with Y335A and M344A mutations but not with V339A or M343A mutations. In addition, it was found that the A340V mutation resulted in RIIα binding (Fig. 1 a). These results have three significant implications. First, the same amino acid sequence can allow both RIα and RIIα binding. Second, one of the four hydrophobic amino acids important for RIα binding (Ala340) determines the specificity for RIα binding. Third, the size of the hydrophobic side chains is a key factor affecting the binding and specificity of RIα and RIIα subunits of PKA. The RII anchoring domain of Ht31 (residues 494–507) contains six amino acids with a long aliphatic side chain. We supposed that some of these amino acids function in RIIα-specific binding as do those of AKAP75 (9Glantz S.B. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12796-12804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We used Ala-scanning mutagenesis and in vitro pull-down assays to determine which of these residues are essential for RII binding and if any mutations result in RI binding (Fig. 1 b). The I502A, V503A, and I507A mutations abolished RIIα binding. Val-scanning mutagenesis demonstrated that Ala499 also is important for RIIα binding. In addition, the V503A mutation resulted in RIα binding, whereas binding was detected with the L494A, A498V, and V506A mutants after longer exposure to x-ray film (data not shown). RIα binding to the intact Ht31 domain (Fig.2 b) was verified using a yeast two-hybrid assay (data not shown). These results indicate that significant differences occur between the amino acids required for isoform-specific binding on domain B and Ht31. However, replacement of Ala340 with Val resulted in RIIα binding to domain B, and conversely the replacement of Val503 with Ala resulted in RIα binding to Ht31, indicating the importance of individual residues in determining isoform-specific binding. The next set of studies examined the basis for differences between the amino acids required for isoform-specific binding on domain B and Ht31. Point mutagenesis andin vitro pull-down assays were used to determine if other amino acids could be substituted at the sites critical for isoform-specific binding. The binding of RIα to domain B was reduced and RIIα binding initiated when Ala340 was replaced with Val or Ile (Fig. 2 a). The substitution of Leu resulted in loss of binding of RIα and slight RIIα binding. The replacement of Ala with Phe, a hydrophobic amino acid containing an aromatic side chain, or with Lys, a hydrophilic amino acid with a bulky side chain, abolished RIα binding and did not lead to RIIα binding. These results indicate that RIIα binding to domain B occurs when hydrophobic amino acids with a long aliphatic side chain (e.g. Val, Ile, or Leu) are positioned at the critical location in the amphipathic helix. Amino acid substitution was also used to analyze the critical site (Val503) for RII binding specificity on Ht31 (Fig.2 b). The only substitution for this amino acid that increased RIα binding was Ala (V503A), whereas substitution of Ser (V503S) abolished both RIIα binding and the weaker RIα binding. This suggests that RIα binding is determined by a hydrophobic amino acid with a small side chain (e.g. Ala) at this site. Substitution of Ile (V503I) did not have a major effect on RIα or RIIα binding, but substitution of Leu (V503L) substantially reduced RIIα binding. These findings and the results of mutagenesis studies on Ala340 of domain B indicate that RIIα binding occurs best when Val and Ile are present in the critical sites. These results lead us to hypothesize that binding specificity is determined by the size of the aliphatic side chain at the critical amino acid, with a small side chain specifying RIα binding and a large side chain specifying RIIα binding. These results allowed us to determine the consensus amino acid sequence (Fig. 3 a) and predicted secondary structure (Fig. 3 b) of the domain B and Ht31-anchoring sites for RIα and RIIα. The consensus primary sequence (Fig. 3 a) was determined by aligning Ala340 of domain B and Val503 of Ht31 at position 6 (shown by circles). This resulted in positions 2 and 10 containing two of the three hydrophobic amino acid residues (shown by squares) important for RIα or RIIα binding on domain B or Ht31. Both anchoring domains contain Ala at position 2, whereas position 10 contains a hydrophobic amino acid with a bulk side chain (Met or Ile). The predicted secondary structure was determined using a computer software program (DNASISTM). A helical wheel projection of the amino acids at positions 1–10 on domain B and Ht31 was used to display their relative positions within an amphipathic helix (Fig.3 b). For an α-helix viewed from the amino end, residue positions 2, 6, and 10 are seen to form a cluster. Alanine at position 2 and the hydrophobic amino acid with a bulk side chain at position 10 embrace the key residue at position 6 that determines isoform-specific binding. An additional hydrophobic amino acid with a bulk side chain is located peripherally, at position 1 for domain B and position 5 for Ht31. This suggests that positions 2, 6, and 10 on the amphipathic helix form the core of the common RIα and RIIα binding domain, whereas the additional hydrophobic amino acids with a bulk side chain at variable peripheral positions also are required for regulatory subunit binding to each AKAP domain. Domain A of FSC1/AKAP82 binds both RIα and RIIα (24Miki K. Eddy E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34384-34390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar,26Visconti P.E. Johnson L.R. Oyaski M. Fornes M. Moss S.B. Gerton G.L. Kopf G.S. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This domain was analyzed next to determine the features responsible for the RIα/RIIα dual binding capabilities and to relate them to the features of RIα-specific domain B and the RIIα-specific Ht31 domain. A fragment of FSC1/AKAP82 (residues 202–334) containing domain A was analyzed by a combination of point mutagenesis and in vitro pull-down assays to identify the key amino acids that participate in the dual binding ability (Fig.4). Domain A contains an Ala, but it is located at the C terminus of the putative RII binding domain (26Visconti P.E. Johnson L.R. Oyaski M. Fornes M. Moss S.B. Gerton G.L. Kopf G.S. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and seems unlikely to determine binding specificity (Fig. 3 a). Therefore Ala-scanning mutagenesis was used to modify other selected hydrophobic amino acid residues in domain A. As shown in Fig.4 a, the I229A mutation abolished RIIα binding and did not lead to an increase but rather a slight decrease in RIα binding (Fig.4 a). However, substitution of Ala for Val221 (V221A) dramatically increased both RIα and RIIα binding, whereas the Y220A and L227A mutations slightly increased binding by RIIα or both subunits, respectively. Substitution of Ser for Val221(V221S) produced a moderate increase in both RIα and RIIα binding (Fig. 4 b). These results indicate that when residue 221 is a hydrophobic amino acid with a small side chain, it enables binding of RI and RII subunits to domain A. This information was used to compare domain A with the binding sequences determined for domain B and Ht31 (Fig. 3 a). Val221 was placed at position 2 on the amphipathic helix (shown by a triangle), the position of the residue critical for RIα binding to domain B and RIIα binding to Ht31. This alignment placed Ile229 at position 10 (shown by asquare), where our results indicate that a hydrophobic amino acid with a bulk side chain is required for strong RI binding to domain B or RII binding to Ht31. The alignment also placed Ser225at position 6 (shown by a diamond, Fig. 3, a andb) where a hydrophobic amino acid (Ala, Val, Ile, or Leu) was required for isoform-specific binding to domain B or Ht31. Substitutions for Ser225 verified that this position is involved in determining isoform-specific binding (Fig. 4 b). Replacement of Ser225 with Ala (S225A) did not increase RIα binding, whereas replacement with Val (S225V) resulted in some RIIα binding. We replaced Val221 with Ala (V221A) in domain A to enhance RIα and RIIα binding prior to further analyzing isoform specificity. A double mutation that included substitution of Ala for Ser225 (V221A/S225A) reduced RIIα binding, but RIα binding was little changed compared with the V221A mutation (Fig.4 b). However, substitution of Val for Ser225(V221A/S225V) dramatically enhanced RIIα binding and abolished RIα binding induced by the V221A mutation. These results indicate that Ser225 is the key position for determining isoform-specific binding to domain A. They also demonstrate that replacement of Ser225 with Ala or Val converts the anchoring domain from one of dual specificity to an RIα- or RIIα-preferential anchoring domain, respectively. The AKAPs had been shown only to anchor PKAs by RII subunit dimers until an RIα-specific and a dual binding domain for RI and RII were identified recently (21Huang L.J. Durick K. Weiner J.A. Chun J. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8057-8064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 23Huang L.J. Durick K. Weiner J.A. Chun J. Taylor S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This added a new dimension to the role of AKAPs in the localization and function of different PKAs at specific subcellular sites. It also raised the question of the basis for the specificity of binding of different PKA isozymes. A prominent difference between the RI and RII anchoring domains is that the RI domain has a lower content of amino acids with a long aliphatic side chain (Val, Leu, or Ile). This led us in the present study to analyze isoform-specific binding by Val- and Ala-scanning mutagenesis. We found the following: (i) hydrophobic amino acids in the anchoring domains are essential for isoform-specific binding; (ii) two amino acids required for binding are located at consensus positions 2 and 10 of an amphipathic helix, and an amino acid required for isoform-specific binding is located at consensus position 6; (iii) the amino acid at position 2 has a small side chain, and the amino acid at position 10 has a hydrophobic amino acid with a bulk side chain; and (iv) binding specificity is determined by the size of the hydrophobic side chain at position 6, with amino acids bearing a small side chain necessary for RIα binding and those with a long aliphatic side chain necessary for RIIα binding (Fig.5). In addition, each of the AKAP anchoring domains analyzed required distinctive hydrophobic amino acids at other positions for PKA binding. The specific requirements at positions 2, 6, and 10 indicate that these three amino acids form the basis of regulatory subunit binding. We refer to this arrangement as the three amino acid rule. However, this arrangement is necessary but not sufficient for PKA binding, and additional hydrophobic amino acids located at other position(s) are required for subunit anchoring. The three amino acid rule is applicable to other AKAPs. RII anchoring was eliminated by substitution of Ala for Ile405 on AKAP75 and Ala for Ile248 on AKAPCE (9Glantz S.B. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12796-12804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Angelo R. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14633-14643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). An alignment that places these residues at position 10 locates Ala at position 2 for both AKAPs. Furthermore, AKAP75 has a Val at position 6 as does Ht31, and AKAPCE has a Ser at position 6 as occurs in domain A. Vijayaraghavan et al. (28Vijayaraghavan S. Liberty G.A. Mohan J. Winfrey V.P. Olson G.E. Carr D.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 705-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) aligned AKAP110 with 14 other AKAPs and identified a consensus sequence that is consistent with the three amino acid rule. However, there are a few exceptions, including the presence of Val, a hydrophobic amino acid with a long aliphatic side chain at position 2 of domain A. Substitution of Ala at this position (V221A) dramatically increased RIα and RIIα binding to domain A (Fig. 4), as predicted by the three amino acid rule. Ht31 was considered to be an RII-specific AKAP (29Rosenmund C. Carr D.W. Bergeson S.E. Nilaver G. Scott J.D. Westbrook G.L. Nature. 1994; 368: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), but we found that Ht31 binds RIIα preferentially and RIα weakly. We have also observed that AKAP79 binds RIα as well as RIIα. 2K. Miki and E. M. Eddy, unpublished results. This suggests that if an anchoring domain has a hydrophobic amino acid with a long aliphatic side chain at position 6, it has RII-preferential, dual-specific binding (RII > RI). However, RIα and RIIα showed comparable binding to domain A. We refer to this type of dual-specific binding as “neutral specificity” (RI ≈ RII). RII-preferential, dual-specific binding may occur with D-AKAP1 and D-AKAP2, as occurs with Ht31. The neutral specificity of domain A appears to be due to the presence of Ser at position 6 instead of an Ala, Val, Ile, or Leu residue present at this position in other AKAPs. The structural features of the binding site on RI and RII dimers that associate with AKAPs have been examined recently by NMR and x-ray crystallography. RIα and RIIα have limited sequence homology, but both possess an α-helical region at the N terminus that is responsible for regulatory subunit dimer formation and for docking the dimer to AKAPs (14Newlon M.G. Roy M. Hausken Z.E. Scott J.D. Jennings P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23637-23644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 15León D.A. Herberg F.W. Banky P. Taylor S.S. J.

An NMR study of the N-terminal region of RIIα (residues 1–44) indicated that a four-helix bundle dimerization motif with an extended hydrophobic face defined the AKAP-binding site (10Newlon M.G. Roy M. Morikis D. Hausken Z.E. Coghlan V. Scott J.D. Jennings P.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 222-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Studies using point mutagenesis of the dimerization/docking domain of RIα, RIIα, and RIIβ have indicated that hydrophobic amino acids with bulk side chains are required for binding to AKAPs without abolishing dimerization (11Hausken Z.E.

Chem. 1998; 273: 35048-35055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These results are in agreement with our data indicating that hydrophobic interactions are a crucial factor for association between AKAPs and PKA regulatory subunits. However, Newlon et al.(10Newlon M.G. Roy M. Morikis D. Hausken Z.E. Coghlan V. Scott J.D. Jennings P.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 222-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) observed NMR chemical shift changes not only for hydrophobic but also for hydrophilic amino acid residues corresponding to the dimerization/docking domain of RIIα upon addition of a peptide containing the Ht31 anchoring domain. Although the chemical shift changes could result from structural changes upon binding of the Ht31 peptide, we cannot exclude the possibility that hydrophilic amino acids of AKAP anchoring domains have direct contact with regulatory subunits and modulate binding affinity and/or specificity. Protein-protein binding depends upon different molecular interactions, including ionic, hydrophilic, and hydrophobic interactions. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis is widely used to evaluate the function of intermolecular and intramolecular hydrophobic interactions (9Glantz S.B. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12796-12804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Sattler M. Liang H. Nettesheim D. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Eberstadt M. Yoon H.S. Shuker S.B. Chang B.S. Minn A.J.

Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3343-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). When protein interactions are disturbed by an Ala substitution, they are likely due to hydrophobic interactions. An unexpected finding of the present study was that Val-scanning mutagenesis revealed indispensable functions of Ala residues other than forming hydrophobic bonds. These results indicated that (i) protein interactions can be defined by the nature of the hydrophobic face, (ii) binding specificity can be determined by a single amino acid based on the size of the side chain, (iii) and Val-scanning mutagenesis is useful for identifying the function of a small hydrophobic side chain on an amphipathic helix. Hydrophobic protein interactions also occur between leucine zipper motifs, with the hydrophobic amino acids arrayed in an α-helix that forms a line of long aliphatic groups (32Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2544) Google Scholar). An amphipathic helix has a similar secondary structure but bears a hydrophobic face rather than a hydrophobic line. It appears that an advantage of the amphipathic helix is that it provides the opportunity for a variety of protein interactions to occur with different affinities and specificities. The isoform-specific binding of AKAPs leads us to hypothesize that the selection of a binding partner to an amphipathic helix is due to modulation of the binding surface by a change in the combination of hydrophobic amino acids with differently sized residues. Although more than 20 AKAPs have been reported in different tissues and species, there are still many questions about their roles in cells. In most cases the target proteins of the PKAs anchored by AKAPs are unknown, other proteins associated with AKAPs have not been identified, isoform-specific functions for RI and RII have not been determined, and the reasons for specific binding of RI or RII to AKAPs remain to be determined. The information gained in the current study should be useful for addressing some of these questions. The three amino acid rule forms the basis for testing the role of anchoring domains in other AKAPs. It will be informative to determine if the introduction of point mutations to abolish binding or to modify binding specificity of particular AKAPs in vivo causes physiological changes or different response to hormones and growth factors. This approach in conjunction with NMR and x-ray crystallography can be expected to give insight into the nature and role of interactions between AKAPs and PKA regulatory subunits at specific times and locations within cells and organisms.

Subsequent studies have revealed that the gene coding for rBAT is defective in some patients with cystinuria (3Gitomer W.L. Pak C.Y. J.

Interestingly rBAT is not very hydrophobic, a characteristic rather unusual for a transport protein. The prevailing hypothesis is that rBAT does not constitute the transport system per se, but may be an essential subunit associated with the transport system (12Palacin M. Estevez R. Bertran J. Zorzano A. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 969-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). The molecular identity of the other subunits(s) that interact(s) with rBAT to form the transport system remains unknown. The fact that defects in the rBATgene account for some but not all cystinuria cases indicates that other genes, hitherto unidentified, are also involved in this disease. Biochemical evidence suggests that cystinuria is comprised of three genetically distinct diseases (13Rosenberg L.E. Downing S. Durant J.L. Segal S. J. Clin. Invest. 1966; 45: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Mutational analyses have shown that defects in the rBAT gene are exclusively associated with type I cystinuria. However, there are cases of type I cystinuria with no detectable defects in the rBAT gene, and the identity of the gene responsible for these cases is not known. Similarly, the genes associated with type II and type III cystinuria have also not yet been identified. rBAT exhibits significant homology to 4F2hc, the heavy chain of the cell surface antigen 4F2 (7Wells R.G. Hediger M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5596-5600Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 8Bertran J. Werner A. Moore M.L. Strange G. Markovich D. Biber J. Testar X. Zorzano A.

Here we report the cloning of a protein from the rabbit small intestine, which, when coexpressed with 4F2hc in mammalian cells, induces a Na+-independent amino acid transport activity specific for neutral and cationic amino acids and cystine. Even though this transport activity is similar to the activity associated with rBAT, the newly cloned protein does not interact with rBAT. This protein is the sixth member of the 4F2 light chain family to be identified that interacts with the 4F2 heavy chain to constitute an amino acid transport system. Accordingly, we have named this protein 4F2-lc6. The other five are 4F2-lc1 (LAT1), 4F2-lc2 (y+LAT1), 4F2-lc3 (y+LAT2), 4F2-lc4 (xCT), and 4F2-lc5 (LAT2). Based on the functional characteristics of the transport system induced by the 4F2hc/4F2-lc6 complex, we hypothesize that 4F2-lc6 may represent a new candidate gene for cystinuria. These studies provide the first evidence for the existence of a b0,+-like amino acid transport activity independent of rBAT. Radiolabeled amino acids and nucleotides were purchased from NEN Life Science Products, American Radiolabeled Chemicals, or Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Unlabeled amino acids were from Sigma.

The cDNAs were transfected into HRPE cells grown in 24-well tissue culture plates using Lipofectin, and the functional expression of the cDNA was analyzed 12 h later by measuring radiolabeled amino acid uptake. One microgram of the plasmid carrying the specific cDNA (4F2-lc6, 4F21hc, or rBAT) was used per well. Sister wells transfected identically with vector alone served as control. The transport buffer was composed of 25 mm Hepes/Tris (pH 7.5), supplemented with 140 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, and 5 mm glucose. When the effect of Na+ on amino acid uptake was studied, the NaCl in the buffer was replaced withN-methyl-d-glucamine chloride. The incubation time for the transport measurements was 15 min in most cases, following which the uptake medium containing the radioactive substrate was aspirated off and the cells were washed with 2 × 2 ml of ice-cold transport buffer. The cells were then solubilized in 0.5% SDS in 0.2n NaOH, transferred to vials, and radioactivity associated with the cells quantitated by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The experiments were repeated two to three times with independent transfections, each done in duplicate or triplicate. Data are presented as means ± S.E. of these replicate measurements. Isolation of mature oocytes from X. laevis, cRNA synthesis, and microinjection of cRNA into oocytes have been described previously (16Fei Y.J. Prasad P.D. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V.

Uptake of radiolabeled amino acids into oocytes was measured for 60 min in the uptake buffer, composed of 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm CaCl2, buffered with 3 mmHepes/Tris, pH 7.5. Poly(A)+ RNA, isolated from different rabbit tissues (small intestine, kidney, heart, lung, liver, and skeletal muscle), was used for Northern blot analysis. The membrane filter containing the size-fractionated RNA (5 μg/lane) was probed sequentially, first with the 4F2-lc6 cDNA and then, following stripping, with cyclophilin cDNA. Poly(A)+ RNA samples prepared from rabbit tissues were used for RT-PCR. The upstream primer was 5′-CCGCCTACCTCTTCTCCT-3′, and the downstream primer was 5′-CGCTGGGTTAGTGATGAC-3′. These primers correspond to nucleotide positions 405–422 and 1367–1384 of the rabbit intestinal 4F2-lc6 cDNA. The RT-PCR products were subcloned into pGEM-T vector and the inserts were analyzed for restriction pattern and nucleotide sequence. The rabbit intestinal 4F2-lc6 cDNA is 1858 bp long, with an open reading frame consisting of 1464 bp (including the termination codon). The cDNA codes for a protein of 487 amino acids (Fig. 1 A). The open reading frame is flanked by a 82-bp 5′-noncoding sequence and a 312-bp 3′-noncoding sequence (GenBank accession no. AF155119). The predicted molecular mass of the protein is 53.6 kDa. Hydrophobicity analysis of the amino acid sequence suggests the presence of 12 putative transmembrane domains. When modeled similar to most of the transporter proteins with both the N terminus and C terminus facing the cytoplasmic surface of the lipid bilayer, there is one potential site for N-linked glycosylation (Asn-271) in the extracellular loop between transmembrane domains 7 and 8 (Fig. 1 B). The protein contains three potential sites for protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation (Ser-169, Ser-345, and Thr-399) and one potential site for cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation (Thr-350) in putative intracellular domains. At the level of amino acid sequence, the rabbit 4F2-lc6 exhibits significant homology to the other known members of the 4F2 light chain family, namely 4F2-lc1 (LAT1), 4F2-lc2 (y+LAT1), 4F2–1c3 (y+LAT2), 4F2-lc4 (xCT), and 4F2-lc5 (LAT2). The amino acid sequence identity is 43–44%, and similarity is 63–65%. The structural similarity of 4F2-lc6 to the known light chains associated with 4F2hc suggested that 4F2-lc6 may be a protein which works with 4F2hc to form a new heterodimeric amino acid transport system. To establish the functional identity of 4F2-lc6, we expressed 4F2-lc6 cDNA either alone or together with human 4F2hc cDNA in HRPE cells using the vaccinia virus expression system and studied the transport of a neutral amino acid (alanine) in the presence or absence of Na+(Fig. 2 A and B). In the presence of Na+, neither 4F2-lc6 nor 4F2hc mediated alanine transport. The transport activity in either case was not different from the transport activity in control cells transfected with vector alone. Similarly, the transport activity remained essentially the same even when 4F2-lc6 was coexpressed with 4F2hc. In contrast to the results obtained in the presence of Na+, an increase in alanine transport was seen in cells coexpressing the two proteins when the transport was measured in the absence of Na+. Expression of either 4F2-lc6 or 4F2hc alone did not show any increase in alanine transport under similar conditions. These data demonstrate that the 4F2hc/4F2-lc6 heterodimeric complex mediates Na+-independent transport of the neutral amino acid alanine. Na+-independent alanine transport activity was also demonstrable with the heterodimeric complex consisting of 4F2-lc6 and rat 4F2hc (data not shown). It is of some interest that the heterodimer-mediated alanine transport could not be detected when measured in the presence of Na+. A Na+-independent transport process is expected to be detectable both in the presence and absence of Na+. It is possible that the high endogenous alanine transport activity seen in the presence of Na+ masks the transport activity associated with the 4F2hc/4F2-lc6 complex in this experimental system. We then tested whether 4F2-lc6 is capable of working with rBAT instead of 4F2hc to induce the Na+-independent alanine transport activity (Fig. 2 C). Human rBAT cDNA and 4F2-lc6 cDNA were expressed either independently or together in HRPE cells and alanine transport was measured in the absence of Na+. These were the same experimental conditions in which the alanine transport activity of the 4F2hc/4F2-lc6 complex was demonstrable. The data given in Fig. 2 C show that there was no alanine transport activity associated with rBAT and 4F2-lc6 when expressed either independently or together. Fig. 2 D shows the time course of alanine transport, measured in the absence of Na+, in cells transfected with pSPORT vector and in cells coexpressing 4F2hc and 4F2-lc6. The transport activity was 2–3-fold higher in cells coexpressing the two proteins than in vector-transfected cells at all time periods tested. When the transport activity specific for the 4F2hc/4F2-lc6 complex alone was considered, the transport was linear (r = 0.98) at least up to 20 min. Table I describes the specificity of the transport system mediated by the 4F2hc/4F2-lc6 complex, as evidenced from direct measurements of the transport of radiolabeled amino acids and comparison of the transport activities between control cells transfected with pSPORT vector alone and cells coexpressing 4F2hc and 4F2-lc6. The 4F2hc/4F2-lc6-mediated transport was demonstrable for the neutral amino acids alanine, glutamine, cysteine, cystine, leucine, histidine, and phenylalanine and for the cationic amino acid arginine. The transport of the anionic amino acid glutamate and the transport of the system A-specific substrate MeAIB were not different between the control cells and the cells expressing the 4F2hc/4F2-lc6 complex. These results show that the 4F2hc/4F2-lc6 complex mediates Na+-independent transport of most of the neutral amino acids as well as the cationic amino acids.Table I4F2hc/4F2-lc6 complex-mediated transport of amino acidsAmino acidTransportpSPORT4F2hc/4F2-lc6pmol/106/cells/30 minAlanine33.8 ± 1.589.8 ± 2.5 (266)aStatistically significant (p < 0.05).Glutamine16.2 ± 0.769.2 ± 10.3 (428)aStatistically significant (p < 0.05).Cysteine22.1 ± 0.832.8 ± 0.5 (148)aStatistically significant (p < 0.05).Leucine102.6 ± 9.5136.3 ± 18.6 (133)aStatistically significant (p < 0.05).Histidine114.5 ± 4.5145.1 ± 10.9 (127)aStatistically significant (p < 0.05).Phenylalanine109.1 ± 0.3125.5 ± 0.7 (115)aStatistically significant (p < 0.05).Arginine231.7 ± 12.4294.5 ± 23.4 (127)aStatistically significant (p < 0.05).Cystine100.0 ± 0.4118.9 ± 1.0 (119)aStatistically significant (p < 0.05).Glutamate18.8 ± 1.419.1 ± 1.9 (102)MeAIB44.0 ± 4.046.0 ± 2.0 (105)HRPE cells were transfected with either empty pSPORT vector or h4F2hc cDNA plus rabbit intestinal 4F2-lc6 cDNA.

Table II describes the substrate specificity of the 4F2hc/4F2-lc6 complex as evidenced from competition studies. Na+-independent transport of radiolabeled alanine was measured in control cells transfected with vector alone and in cells coexpressing 4F2hc and 4F2-lc6, and the ability of various unlabeled amino acids to inhibit the transport of radiolabeled alanine was assessed. The 4F2hc/4F2-lc6 complex-specific transport of [3H]alanine was almost completely inhibited by neutral amino acids (leucine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, methionine, alanine, serine, cysteine, threonine, glutamine, asparagine, and glycine) as well as by cationic amino acids (lysine and arginine). The inhibition was also almost complete with cystine and 2-aminobicyclo(2,2,1)heptane-2-carboxylic acid (an amino acid considered to be specific for system L). The imino acid proline, the system A-specific amino acid MeAIB and the anionic amino acids aspartate and glutamate showed little or no inhibition. Taken collectively, these data demonstrate that the 4F2hc/4F2-lc6 complex interacts with neutral amino acids, cationic amino acids, and cystine in a Na+-independent manner. This substrate specificity is similar to that of the amino acid transport system b0,+. Previous studies have shown that rBAT associates with an hitherto unidentified light chain to form the amino acid transport system b0,+ (2Palacin M. Chillaron J. Mora C. Biochem. Soc.

We then studied the potency of the neutral amino acids alanine and leucine, the cationic amino acid lysine, and cystine to inhibit the Na+-independent transport of [3H]alanine in control cells transfected with vector alone and in cells coexpressing 4F2hc and 4F2-lc6. Fig. 3 describes the results with respect to the endogenous [3H]alanine transport activity and the [3H]alanine transport activity that is specific to the heterologously expressed 4F2hc/4F2-lc6 complex. The latter was determined by subtracting the endogenous activity from the activity measured in cells transfected with 4F2hc cDNA plus 4F2-lc6 cDNA. The endogenous [3H]alanine transport activity was inhibited by alanine and leucine but not by lysine (Fig.3 A). Cystine showed a small, but significant, inhibition of the endogenous activity. In contrast, the 4F2hc/4F2-lc6 complex-specific [3H]alanine transport was completely inhibitable by alanine, leucine, lysine, and cystine (Fig.3 B). The IC50 values (i.e. the concentrations of unlabeled amino acids needed to cause 50% inhibition of [3H]alanine transport) for these four amino acids were 25 ± 2, 9 ± 1, 12 ± 3, and 27 ± 3 μm, respectively. Thus, the transport activity specific to the 4F2hc/4F2-lc6 complex exhibits high affinity toward neutral amino acids, cationic amino acids, and cystine. The IC50values for alanine and leucine to inhibit the endogenous [3H]alanine transport were 28 ± 3 and 10 ± 2 μm, respectively. Fig. 4 describes the saturation kinetics of Na+-independent alanine transport in control cells transfected with vector alone and in cells coexpressing 4F2hc and 4F2-lc6. The transport was saturable over an alanine concentration range of 5–75 μm in both cases. The Michaelis-Menten constant (Kt) for the 4F2hc/4F2-lc6 complex-specific transport activity was 41 ± 6 μm. This value was similar to the IC50 value (25 ± 2 μm) determined from the dose-response relationship for the inhibition of [3H]alanine transport by unlabeled alanine. The tissue distribution of the expression of 4F2-lc6 in the rabbit was studied by Northern blot analysis (Fig.5). The 4F2-lc6-specific mRNA (2.0 kilobases in size) was detectable only in the small intestine and the kidney. The other tissues tested (heart, lung, liver, and skeletal muscle) were negative. To confirm that the northern hybridization signal obtained with the kidney mRNA represents the 4F2-lc6-specific message, we performed RT-PCR and analyzed the product. With a pair of primers specific for the rabbit intestinal 4F2-lc6, mRNA samples from the rabbit intestine (positive control) and the rabbit kidney yielded RT-PCR products of expected size (980 bp) (data not shown). These products were subcloned and analyzed for their restriction pattern with three different restriction enzymes (BamHI, EcoRI, and StyI). Both products exhibited an identical restriction pattern, indicating that both products were identical. This was confirmed by sequence analysis of the products. These results show unequivocally that the small intestine and the kidney express 4F2-lc6 mRNA. Interestingly, the data from the sensitive RT-PCR technique showed that the 4F2-lc6 mRNA is also expressed in other tissues, although to a much lesser extent than in the intestine and kidney. Since the ability of the 4F2hc/4F2-lc6 complex to mediate the transport of cystine is directly relevant to the genetic disorder cystinuria, we used the X. laevis oocyte expression system to confirm the 4F2hc/4F2-lc6-mediated cystine transport (Fig.6 A). 4F2hc and 4F2-lc6 were expressed in the oocytes either independently or together by microinjection of corresponding cRNAs, and the uptake of cystine in these oocytes was then studied. Expression of 4F2hc alone increased cystine uptake to a small extent, but expression of 4F2-lc6 alone did not. However, when both proteins were co-expressed, cystine uptake increased severalfold compared with water-injected oocytes or oocytes expressing the two proteins independently. We have also used the oocyte expression system to demonstrate that the human rBAT clone used in the present study is functionally active. As shown in Fig. 6 B, the b0,+-like transport function of rBAT is evident from the increased uptake of cystine, leucine, and arginine in rBAT-expressing oocytes compared with uptake in water-injected oocytes. This is the first report of the molecular identification of a transporter that is associated with a b0,+-like amino acid transport activity independent of rBAT. This transporter, designated 4F2-lc6, was cloned from the rabbit intestine. 4F2-lc6 interacts with the heavy chain of the cell surface antigen 4F2 to induce a b0,+-like amino acid transport activity. Thus, 4F2-lc6 represents the first light chain subunit to be identified at the molecular level that is associated with a b0,+-like amino acid transport activity. This is also the first report showing the involvement of the 4F2 heavy chain in a b0,+-like transport activity. Previous studies have shown that the 4F2 heavy chain is involved in the amino acid transport activities identified as systems L1, L2, y+L1, y+L2, and xc− (18Kanai Y. Segawa H. Miyamoto K. Uchino H.

To date, the only protein that has been shown to be involved in a b0,+-like amino acid transport activity is rBAT (7Wells R.G. Hediger M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5596-5600Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 8Bertran J. Werner A. Moore M.L. Strange G. Markovich D. Biber J. Testar X. Zorzano A. Palacin M. Murer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5601-5605Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). This protein shows a significant homology to the 4F2 heavy chain and is believed to constitute one of the subunits of the b0,+-like transport system (2Palacin M. Chillaron J. Mora C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 856-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 11Palacin M. Mora C. Chillaron J. Calonge M.J. Estevez R. Torrents D. Testar X. Zorzano A. Nunes V. Purroy J. Estevill X.

Rev. 1998; 78: 969-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). However, the other putative subunit that associates with rBAT has not been identified. The 4F2-lc6 reported in this paper is a subunit of a b0,+-like transport system, but does not interact with rBAT. The transport activity mediated by the 4F2hc/4F2-lc6 complex shows high affinity for neutral amino acids, cationic amino acids, and cystine. The 4F2-lc6-specific message is expressed predominantly in the intestine and the kidney in the rabbit. The transport characteristics and the tissue distribution pattern suggest that 4F2-lc6 is a candidate gene for cystinuria. Available evidence indicates that, in addition to the rBAT gene, there are other genes hitherto unidentified that are associated with this disease (12Palacin M. Estevez R. Bertran J. Zorzano A. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 969-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). This evidence includes the following: (a) mutations in the rBATgene are responsible for some but not all cystinuria patients, (b) the genetic locus of the putative subunit that interacts with the rBAT gene has not been identified, (c) the rBAT-specific mRNA is detectable only in the proximal straight tubule of the nephron while the absorption of cystine and cationic amino acids occurs in the proximal convoluted tubule as well as in the proximal straight tubule and the proteins responsible for the absorption in the proximal convoluted tubule have not been identified, (d) cystinuria presents as different, phenotypically distinguishable, genetic variants, and (e) multiple genetic loci have been definitively identified that are associated with the disease. We suggest that 4F2-lc6 is a candidate gene for cystinuria. Based on the present studies, there are at least two distinct b0,+-like amino acid transport activities. One of them consists of rBAT and a hitherto unidentified subunit, whereas the other consists of the 4F2 heavy chain and the newly cloned 4F2-lc6. The rBAT-associated b0,+-like transport process has been shown to be an obligatory amino acid exchanger (12Palacin M. Estevez R. Bertran J. Zorzano A. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 969-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). However, preliminary studies with the 4F2hc/4F2-lc6 complex-associated b0,+-like transport process in mammalian cells have indicated that the transport process induced by the complex is not an obligatory amino acid exchanger. Neither the influx nor the efflux of arginine or glutamine in 4F2hc/4F2-lc6-expressing cells was influenced by other 4F2hc/4F2-lc6-specific substrates on thetrans-side. 2D. P. Rajan, R. Kekuda, W. Huang, H. Wang, L. D. Devoe, F. H. Leibach, P. D. Prasad, and V. Ganapathy, unpublished data. Thus, there may be significant functional differences between the b0,+-like transport activities associated with rBAT and 4F2hc/4F2-lc6 complex. The ability of the 4F2hc/4F2-lc6 heterodimeric complex to induce a b0,+-like amino acid transport activity implies that mutations not only in the 4F2-lc6 gene but also in the 4F2hc gene may be associated with cystinuria. To date, there have been no reports of mutational analysis of the4F2hc gene in patients with cystinuria. However, it must be noted that mutations in the 4F2hc gene are likely to affect not only the b0,+-like transport activity but also the transport activities identified as L1, L2, y+L1, y+L2, and xc− since 4F2hc is a common subunit of these transport systems. On the other hand, mutations in the 4F2-lc6 gene are likely to affect only the b0,+-like transport activity. We thank Ida O. Walker for expert secretarial assistance."

In culture cells, the toxins induce actin polymerization and inhibit cytokinesis resulting in formation of multinucleated cells (18Falzano L. Fiorentini C. Donelli G. Michel E. Kocks C. Cossart P.

Recently it has been reported that CNF and DNT act on Rho GTPases by deamidation of glutamine 63 of RhoA, thereby inhibiting the GTPase activity of Rho. Because Gln63 is essential for GTP hydrolysis, deamidation causes persistent activation of the GTPase resulting in strong formation of stress fibers of CNF- or DNT-treated cells. In addition to their deamidase activity, both toxins possessin vitro transglutaminase activity to attach primary amines onto Rho GTPases. Substrates of CNF and DNT are Rho subfamily members including Rac and Cdc42. In the present communication the substrate recognition of Rho GTPases by CNF1 and DNT was studied. Using GTPase chimeras of RhoA and Ha-Ras which is not a substrate of the toxins, we identified the switch II region of Rho as being sufficient for recognition by CNF1. Accordingly, a peptide consisting of amino acid residues Asp59 through Asp78 of RhoA was deamidated and/or transglutaminated by CNF1. By contrast, the structural requirements for substrate recognition by DNT are more stringent. For protein purification, E. coli strains carrying pGEX plasmids with the coding sequence for the respective GTPases, GTPase chimera, CNF1 (either as full-length or as the catalytic C-terminal part (ΔCNF1, amino acid residues 709–1014), or DNT (the catalytic C-terminal part (ΔDNT, amino acid residues 1136–1451) were grown in LB medium and induced with 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at OD 0.5. The cells were harvested after 3–6 h and the glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were purified by means of glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Unstable proteins were kept as GST fusion proteins (Rho115Ras, Ras59Rho115Ras, ΔDNT, and full-length CNF1); otherwise, the proteins were subjected to thrombin cleavage to remove GST. The GTPase chimeras were constructed using the splicing by overlap extension method described previously (21Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2641) Google Scholar). In brief, two polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were performed, each amplifying the sequences to be fused. The products of the two first PCRs were pooled and cycled in a third PCR, in which the overhanging sequences act as primers. We used pGEX2T-RhoA (wild-type, WT) and pGEX2TGL-Ha-Ras (wild-type) as templates with the different primers listed in Table I and pGEX primers either annealing 5′ or 3′ of the multiple cloning site of pGEX (Table I). The product of the second PCR was subjected toBamHI and EcoRI cleavage and subcloned into a pGEX2TGL vector. The sites of splicing are numbered by Rho nomenclature. The “sandwich” chimeras Ras55Rho70Ras and Ras59Rho70Ras were constructed with splicing by overlay extension by using the primers for Ras55Rho and Ras59Rho, respectively, with Rho70Ras serving as template. Ras59Rho115Ras was constructed by using the primers for Ras59Rho with Rho115Ras as a template.

The cells were microinjected with 0.5 μg/μl GST-Ras55Rho or buffer by means of a microinjector 5242 (Eppendorf) and subsequently treated for 48 h with full-length GST-CNF1 (300 ng/ml). GTPase or chimeric protein (3–6 μg) was incubated with or without CNF1 or DNT in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEDTA, and 50 mm monodansylcadaverine for 15 min at 37 °C. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and the transglutaminated proteins were detected under UV light (206 nm). Subsequently, the gel was Coomassie-stained to check the amount of proteins in each lane. RhoA, Ha-Ras, RhoA mutants, or Rho/Ras chimeras (each 0.5 μm) were incubated at 37 °C in a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm triethanolamine (pH 7.5). After addition of 2 μm2′(3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-GDP which was synthesized as described (22Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 496-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), the increase in light emission at 444 nm, due to the higher intensity of bound 2′(3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-nucleotide excited at 357 nm, was monitored in a Perkin-Elmer LS 50B luminescence spectrometer. To determine the release of ammonia from the GTPases during incubation with CNF1, we utilized a coupled enzymatic reaction. In the presence of glutamate dehydrogenase and NADH, ammonia reacts with α-ketoglutarate to forml-glutamate, thereby oxidating the NADH. The amount of NADH oxidized in the reaction is stoichiometric to the amount of ammonia produced. RhoA, Ha-Ras, or Rho/Ras chimeras (each 10 μm) were incubated in a buffer containing 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA and the components of the coupled enzyme reaction system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Ammonia Test Combination for Food Analysis): 140 μm NADH, 7 mm α-ketoglutarate, and 10 units of glutamate dehydrogenase. The samples were equilibrated at 37 °C prior to addition of CNF1 as indicated in the figure legends. The decrease in NADH concentration was measured fluorimetrically (excitation at 340 nm, emission at 460 nm) in a Perkin-Elmer LS 50B luminescence spectrometer. RhoA was incubated in a glucosylation buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mmMnCl2) in the presence or absence of C. difficile toxin B (6 ng/μl) or in an ADP-ribosylation buffer (40 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 200 μm NAD, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 μm GDP, and 2 mmMgCl2) in the presence or absence of C. botulinum C3 toxin (1 ng/μl) at 37 °C for 30 min. RhoA switch II peptide (1 mm) was incubated for 3 h at 37 °C with or without CNF1 (1 μm) in the presence of 20 mm ethylenediamine in a buffer containing 25 mm triethanolamine (pH 7.5), 75 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EDTA. To obtain a concentration of the RhoA switch II peptide of 10 μm, the reaction mixture was diluted with TA (acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 1:1). A saturated matrix solution of recrystallized 4-hydroxy-α-cyanocinnamic acid (Aldrich) in TA was freshly prepared and marker peptides (ACTH 18–39 clip, human, and angiotensin II, human) were added for internal calibration. Matrix and peptide solution were mixed in equal amounts. Using the dried-drop method of matrix crystallization, 1 μl of the sample matrix solution was placed on the MALDI stainless steel target and allowed to air-dry several minutes at room temperature. MALDI/TOF-MS was performed on a Bruker Biflex mass spectrometer equipped with a nitrogen laser (λ = 337). Mass spectra were recorded in the reflector positive mode in combination with delayed extraction. It has been shown that Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 are deamidated by CNF1 (23Lerm M. Selzer J. Hoffmeyer A. Rapp U.R. Aktories K. Schmidt G. Infect. Immun. 1998; 67: 496-503Crossref Google Scholar). To test whether Ha-Ras is a substrate for CNF1, the release of ammonia occurring concomitantly with deamidation was determined in a coupled enzyme assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 1shows that addition of the active fragment of CNF1 (ΔCNF1) caused release of ammonia in the presence of RhoA but not in the presence of Ras indicating that the latter GTPase is not modified by CNF1. Because Rho and Ha-Ras differ in the amino acid residues flanking the site of modification in Rho (Fig. 2), we tested a Ha-Ras mutant with an aspartic acid residue instead of glutamic acid at position 63 of Ha-Ras. Like wild-type Ha-Ras, the mutant E63D Ras was not deamidated by ΔCNF1 (not shown).Figure 2Alignment of amino acids of RhoA, Cdc42, Rac1, and Ha-Ras that cover the switch II region of the GTPases.Gln63 (bold letter, Rho nomenclature) is the target for deamidation or transglutamination by CNF and DNT.

The chimeras were tested in a transglutaminase assay with monodansylcadaverine as a co-substrate. This primary amine contains a naphthalene group, which is excitable by UV light at 206 nm. Fig.3 shows the proteins analyzed by SDS-PAGE and photographed under UV light. As observed for wild-type Rho, the Ras55Rho chimera was transglutaminated by ΔCNF. Also the Rho115Ras chimera was substrate for ΔCNF. This chimera was less stable than Ras55Rho. Therefore, we studied Rho115Ras as a GST fusion protein and compared it with GST fusion proteins of wild-type RhoA and Ha-Ras. Hall and co-workers reported that amino acid residues 23 through 46 of Ras are sufficient to elicit Ras-dependent transformation in NIH3T3 cells (24Self A.J. Paterson H.F. Hall A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 655-661PubMed Google Scholar). Constitutively active Ras is known to induce neurite formation in PC12 cells (25Guerrero I. Wong H. Pellicer A. Burstein D.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1986; 129: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether CNF1 was able to induce neurite formation in PC12 cells microinjected with Ras55Rho prior to toxin treatment. PC12 cells were grown on plastic dishes, microinjected with 0.5 μg/μl GST-Ras55Rho, and treated with GST fusion protein of the CNF1 holotoxin (300 ng/ml) for 48 h. Whereas Ras55Rho-injected cells without CNF1 showed only small processes (Fig. 4 A), injected cells developed long neurite extensions after CNF1 treatment (Fig.4 B) indicating an activation of the Ras chimera by CNF1. Because experiments with the Ras55Rho and Rho115Ras chimeras suggested that neither the N terminus nor the C terminus of Rho are essential for substrate recognition by ΔCNF1, we studied whether sandwich (Ras/Rho/Ras) chimeras are modified by the toxin. The sandwich chimera, Ras59Rho115Ras, was substrate for deamidation by ΔCNF1 (not shown). Further reduction of the length of the RhoA insert in Ha-Ras resulted in the chimera Ras59Rho78Ras. We tested this chimera in the transglutamination assay at increasing concentrations of ΔCNF1. The chimera was a substrate for transglutamination, however, whereas wild-type Rho was significantly transglutaminated at 10 nmΔCNF1, higher concentrations of CNF1 (about 10-fold) were required for transglutamination of Ras59Rho78Ras (Fig.5). Chimeras containing very short Rho sequences of only 8 or 5 amino acid residues (Ras55Rho70Ras and Ras59Rho70Ras) did not serve as substrates of CNF1 (data not shown). To exclude that these results were due to incorrect protein folding, we tested the ability of the chimeras to bind nucleotide. Both chimeras (Ras55Rho70Ras and Ras59Rho70Ras) were able to bind 2′(3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-GDP indicating a proper folding of the proteins (not shown). The results obtained with the different chimeras are summarized in Fig.6.Figure 6Properties of Rho/Ras chimeras to serve as substrates for Δ CNF1 . Substrate properties were tested at least 3 times by the ammonia release and/or the transglutamination assay. ++, substrate properties similar as wild-type RhoA; +, lower rate of transglutamination than with wild-type RhoA; −, no substrate for ΔCNF1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Deduced from recent crystal structure analysis of Rho (26Wei Y. Zhang Y. Derewenda U. Liu X. Minor W. Nakamoto R.K. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. Derewenda Z.S. Nature Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and by means of the “Rasmol” program we identified four amino acids (Arg68, Leu72, Lys98, and His105) between residues 59 through 115 of Rho which are surface exposed and are identical in Rho, Rac, and Cdc42. These amino acids were changed to the corresponding Ras residues. All mutant proteins were capable of binding 2′,3′-O-N-methylanthraniloyl-GDP in the nucleotide binding assay (not shown) indicating a correct protein folding. We tested the deamidation of the mutant RhoA proteins by ΔCNF1 in the ammonia release assay. As shown in Fig.7, A and B, whereas the K98Q and the H105R mutants were deamidated by ΔCNF1, L72Q and R68A mutants did not serve as substrates or were only marginally modified by the toxin. The rate of the modification of the mutant K98Q varied between different experiments and was not consistently slower than the wild-type. To investigate whether arginine 68 and leucine 72 are sufficient for CNF1 substrate recognition, a Ha-Ras double mutant carrying an arginine residue at position 66 and a leucine residue at position 70 was constructed and tested for activity in the transglutaminase and ammonia release assay. However, this mutant was not modified by ΔCNF1 (not shown). A peptide of the sequence59DTAGQEDYDRLRPLSYPDTD78 which covers the switch II region of RhoA was tested for its ability to serve as substrate for CNF1 in the ammonia release assay. The switch II peptide was compared with RhoA (10 μm) at two different concentrations (10 and 100 μm) in the presence of 1 μm ΔCNF1. As shown in Fig.8, after addition of ΔCNF1, ammonia was released from the peptide, however, at a slower rate than with RhoA. The difference in the modification rates was calculated as a 110-fold decrease for the peptide in comparison with the recombinant protein (Sigma Plot). A shorter peptide with the sequence59DTAGQEDYDRLR70 did not release ammonia after addition of ΔCNF1 (not shown). To study whether the switch II peptide (Asp59-Asp78) was modified by transglutamination, the peptide was treated with CNF1 in the presence of ethylenediamine. Thereafter, the sample was analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. As shown in Fig. 9, after ΔCNF1 treatment a new peptide characterized by an increase in mass by 43 Da was detected indicating the attachment of ethylenediamine onto the switch II peptide.Figure 9MALDI-TOF-MS spectra of the transglutaminated RhoA peptide Asp59-Asp78. The RhoA peptide Asp59-Asp78 was treated in the presence of ethylenediamine (20 mm) without (upper line) or with ΔCNF1 (1 μm, lower line) for 3 h. Thereafter, the peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS. Shown is the Rho peptide Asp59-Asp78 (2326 Da) and a new peptide with a mass of 2369.1 Da caused by ΔCNF1-catalyzed attachment of ethylenediamine (43 Da) onto the Rho peptide. Note the increase in mass of 1 Da by deamidation was not detected, because the reaction was not complete.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next we compared ΔCNF with the related Bordetella deamidase DNT in respect to substrate specificity and substrate recognition. The active C-terminal part of Bordetella DNT (amino acids 1136–1451, ΔDNT) was applied as a GST fusion protein because GST-ΔDNT proved to be more stable than ΔDNT. For comparison of the two enzymes, ΔCNF1 was also used as a GST fusion protein. As observed for GST-ΔCNF1, GST-ΔDNT deamidated RhoA, Rac 1, and Cdc42 (not shown). To investigate whether DNT requires the same amino acid residues of Rho for substrate recognition as CNF1, the transglutaminase activities of both toxins were studied in the presence of monodansylcadaverine with the RhoA mutants (R68A, L72Q, K98Q, and H105R) mentioned above (Fig.10). Like ΔCNF1, ΔDNT did not modify the mutants R68A RhoA and L72Q RhoA with alterations in the switch II region. K98Q RhoA and H105R RhoA were transglutaminated by both toxins. We tested the Ras55Rho and Rho115Ras chimeras with GST-ΔCNF1 and GST-ΔDNT in the transglutamination assay. In contrast to GST-ΔCNF1, both chimeras were not modified by GST-ΔDNT (not shown). It has been reported that unlike CNF1, DNT modifies RhoA only in the GDP-bound form (27Horiguchi Y. Senda T. Sugimoto N. Katahira J. Matsuda M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3243-3251PubMed Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that GTP binding caused inhibition of modification by DNT, chimera Ras55R40 was loaded with GDP prior to toxin treatment. However, the Rho chimeras were not modified by DNT even after loading with GDP (not shown). The above findings suggested that the substrate recognition by DNT is more stringent than for CNF1. Because nucleotide binding causes major conformational changes in the switch I region of Rho, we studied the effects of glucosylation of RhoA at Thr37 by C. difficile toxin B on modification by DNT. As shown in Fig. 11, prior glucosylation of Rho by toxin B inhibited the transglutamination by DNT but not by CNF1. By contrast, ADP-ribosylation of Rho at Asn41 by exoenzyme C3, a modification that occurs downstream of the switch I region did not affect transglutamination by CNF1 or DNT. In contrast to various bacterial protein toxins inactivating small GTPases including large clostridial cytotoxins and exoenzyme C3 (28Schmidt G. Aktories K. Naturwissenschaften. 1998; 85: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the E. coli cytotoxic necrotizing factors CNF1 and CNF2 activate Rho GTPases. The latter toxins deamidate Rho GTPases at Gln63 of Rho (Gln61 of Rac and Cdc42) to inhibit the endogenous and GAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis thereby blocking the switch off reaction of the GTPase (29Schmidt G. Sehr P. Wilm M. Selzer J. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1997; 387: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 30Flatau G. Lemichez E. Gauthier M. Chardin P. Paris S. Fiorentini C. Boquet P. Nature. 1997; 387: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that CNF1 possesses in vitrotransglutaminase activity in addition to deamidase activity (31Schmidt G. Selzer J. Lerm M. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13669-13674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 32Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Here we attempted to identify the recognition site of Rho GTPases for CNF1. Rozengurt and co-workers (33Lacerda H.M. Pullinger G.D. Lax A.J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9587-9596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) reported that CNF1 does not activate the mitogen-activated protein kinases p42mapk or p44mapk in Swiss 3T3 cells, suggesting that Ras is not activated by the toxin. In line with this notion, we confirmed that recombinant Ras is not modified by CNF1. To get more information about the structural requirements for substrate recognition by CNF1, we constructed several chimeras consisting of Rho and Ras. The enzymatically active toxin fragment ΔCNF1 (amino acid residues 709–1014 of CNF1) deamidated and transglutaminated all chimeras consisting of Ras harboring the switch II region (Ala61 through Asp78) of Rho. These results indicate that the switch II region of Rho is sufficient for substrate recognition by CNF1 and neither the switch I region nor the insert region (Asp124 through Gln136) are required for interaction with CNF1. This notion was corroborated by the findings that the peptide Asp59 through Asp78covering the switch II region of RhoA was capable to serve as a substrate for the active fragment of CNF1. Similar as found for the chimera Ras59Rho78Ras, the peptide was a poorer substrate for CNF1 than wild-type RhoA, suggesting that additional residues, although not essential for modification by the toxin, increase the substrate properties of RhoA. With one exception (Asp76 of Rho, which is glutamine in Rac and Cdc42), all Rho proteins including Rac and Cdc42 possess highly conserved amino acid sequences in the switch II region. Thus, the substrate requirements observed in this study are in agreement with recent findings that Rac and Cdc42 are modified by CNF1 (23Lerm M. Selzer J. Hoffmeyer A. Rapp U.R. Aktories K. Schmidt G. Infect. Immun. 1998; 67: 496-503Crossref Google Scholar) and it seems likely that all Rho GTPases, including those not studied so far, are also substrates of the toxin. To identify amino acids which are possibly involved in interaction with CNF1, we selected surface-exposed amino acids (Arg68, Leu72, Lys98, and His105) for site-directed mutagenesis by using the crystal structure data of RhoA (26Wei Y. Zhang Y. Derewenda U. Liu X. Minor W. Nakamoto R.K. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. Derewenda Z.S. Nature Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Replacement of Arg68 or Leu72 of RhoA with the corresponding amino acid in Ha-Ras (R68A and L72Q) prevented modification of the mutant proteins. By contrast, replacement of His105 and Lys98, which are located outside the switch II region, with the corresponding residues of Ha-Ras did not alter the modification of RhoA, and the rate of ammonia release from H105R RhoA was greater than that from wild-type Rho. Although both Arg68 and Leu72 of RhoA are essential for recognition by CNF1, they are not sufficient for modification. This is concluded from the finding that replacement of the corresponding amino acids in Ras by arginine and leucine did not make it a substrate for CNF1. The observation that the switch I region of Rho is not important for substrate recognition by CNF1 in vitro was confirmed in intact cells. Microinjection of the Ras55Rho chimera into PC12 cells and subsequent treatment with the CNF1 holotoxin, which in contrast to ΔCNF1 (amino acids 709 through 1014) is able to enter cells, caused a typical Ras-like response, e.g. neurite outgrowth. Addition of CNF1 to buffer-injected cells did not lead to this phenotype (not shown). These results are explained by interaction of the Ras55Rho chimera with Ras effectors mediated by the intact switch I region of Ras and the deamidation of the chimera at Gln63 (Rho nomenclature) thereby preventing the inactivation of the chimeric GTPase. These findings are in agreement with the recent report by Hall and co-workers (24Self A.J. Paterson H.F. Hall A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 655-661PubMed Google Scholar) that a constitutively active Ras/Rho chimera, containing the switch I region of Ras caused the typical Ras effects such as cell transformation (24Self A.J. Paterson H.F. Hall A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 655-661PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover the observed neurite outgrowth is clearly a Ras phenotype, because in contrast to microinjection of dominant active Ras (G12V) the injection of dominant active RhoA (G14V) does not induce neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (not shown). The Bordetella dermonecrotizing toxin DNT is another toxin which activates Rho GTPases. This toxin shares significant similarity at its C terminus (amino acids 1136–1451) with the active region of CNF1 (17Walker K.E. Weiss A.A. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 3817-3828Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Lemichez E. Flatau G. Bruzzone M. Boquet P. Gauthier M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 1061-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Like CNF1, DNT catalyzes deamidation of Gln63 of Rho (35Horiguchi Y. Inoue N. Masuda M. Kashimoto T. Katahira J. Sugimoto N. Matsuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11623-11626Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Moreover, DNT possesses high transglutaminase activity (36Schmidt G. Goehring U.-M. Aktories K. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1999; 359: R60Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We compared the structural requirements for substrate recognition by ΔDNT and ΔCNF1. As with ΔCNF1, changes of Arg68 and Leu72 to the equivalent amino acids of Ras inhibited modification by ΔDNT. However, in contrast to ΔCNF1 (comparison between GST-ΔDNT and GST-ΔCNF1), ΔDNT did not accept any of the Rho/Ras chimeras as substrates for deamidation or transglutamination. Accordingly, the peptide representing the switch II region of RhoA (Asp59 through Asp78) was not modified by ΔDNT. Because neither the Ras55Rho nor the Rho115Ras chimera were modified by ΔDNT, it can be concluded that structural determinants located both N- and C-terminal to the switch II region are essential for substrate recognition by DNT. Thus, it is obvious that the structural requirements for substrate recognition by DNT are more stringent than for CNF1. In line with this notion are recent reports that modification of Rho by DNT, but not by CNF1, depends on the nucleotide bound to Rho (27Horiguchi Y. Senda T. Sugimoto N. Katahira J. Matsuda M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3243-3251PubMed Google Scholar). Using the active fragment ΔDNT, we confirmed that GDP, but not the GTPγS bound form of Rho is a substrate for toxin-catalyzed deamidation and transglutamination. These findings suggest that in addition to the switch II region, the switch I region, which undergoes major changes upon nucleotide binding, is involved in substrate recognition by DNT. A role of the switch I region in substrate recognition by DNT is also supported by the finding that prior glucosylation of Rho by C. difficile toxin B impaired DNT-induced deamidation or transglutamination. Toxin B glucosylates Rho at Thr37 which is located in the switch I region (13Just I. Selzer J. Wilm M. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1995; 375: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). ADP-ribosylation of Rho by C3 at Asn41, which is located outside the switch I region, did not alter DNT effects on Rho. By contrast, as substrate recognition by CNF1 depends almost exclusively on the sequence of the switch II region, it seems logical that nucleotide binding of Rho and glucosylation or ADP-ribosylation by toxins do not alter modification of the GTPase by CNF1. In summary, the switch II region of Rho was identified as the substrate recognition site for CNF1. Minimal structural requirements for substrate recognition by CNF1 are provided by a peptide covering amino acid residues Asp59 through Asp78 of Rho. By contrast, the substrate recognition by DNT is much more complex requiring, in addition to the switch II region, further sites including the switch I region of Rho.

Accordingly, enhanced apoptosis was reduced by blocking the TNF receptor-1. The opposite effects of interleukin-1 indicate that different mechanisms are involved in UV-induced apoptosis compared with CD95- and TRAIL-mediated apoptosis.

The death program can be either initiated by the cell itself when the time has come to die (programmed cell death) or by certain external stimuli activating death receptors on the cell surface (for review, see Ref. 1Cohen J.J. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 126-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar). Thus, apoptosis does not only play an important role in the development and maintenance of tissue homeostasis but also represents an effective mechanism by which harmful cells can be eliminated. Induction of apoptosis allows the organism to get rid of infected cells and also of tumor cells. Accordingly, resistance to apoptosis was identified as an important event in tumorigenesis. Apoptosis of tumor cells can be initiated by triggering cell death receptors, leading to activation of the intracellular apoptotic machinery (2Korsmeyer S.J. Greenberg P.D. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 543-544Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Chemotherapeutic drugs used in cancer treatment may exert their therapeutic effects by activating these pathways (3Friesen X. Herr I.

On the other hand, it is known that defects in the apoptotic pathways or activation of antiapoptotic machineries can confer resistance to chemotherapy (for review, see Refs. 6Haq R. Zanke B. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1998; 17: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar and 7Bold R.J. Termuhlen P.M. McConkey D.J. Surg Oncol. 1997; 6: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In addition, tumor cells can escape apoptotic elimination by down-regulation of apoptosis-related molecules on the cell surface (8Hughes S.J. Nambu Y. Soldes O.S. Hamstra D. Rehemtulla A.

Consequently, control of the balance between pro- and antiapoptotic processes within the cell has been recognized as an important target for therapeutic intervention. Thus, elucidation of the molecular mechanisms regulating these processes is of primary interest. Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL),1 also called APO-2 ligand, is a recently identified molecule belonging to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family that was characterized by its ability to induce apoptosis (10Wiley S.R. Schooley K. Smolak P.J. Din W.S. Huang C.P. Nicholl J.K. Sutherland G.R. Smith T.D. Rauch C. Smith C.A. Goodwin R.G.

Chem. 1996; 271: 12687-12690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar). Among the TNF family members, TRAIL displays highest homology to CD95-ligand (CD95L), which induces apoptosis by triggering the surface receptor CD95 (Fas/APO-1) (12Peter M.E. Krammer P.H. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). In contrast to CD95L, TRAIL was found to induce apoptosis in numerous transformed cell lines but to kill normal cells less effectively (10Wiley S.R. Schooley K. Smolak P.J. Din W.S. Huang C.P. Nicholl J.K. Sutherland G.R. Smith T.D. Rauch C. Smith C.A. Goodwin R.G. Immunity. 1995; 3: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2624) Google Scholar, 11Pitti R.M. Marsters S.C. Ruppert S. Donahue C.J. Moore A. Ashkenazi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12687-12690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar). Because of the unique ability to induce apoptosis preferentially in cancer but not in normal cells, TRAIL may be highly efficient in specifically eradicating tumor cells in vivo (13Walczak H. Miller R.E. Ariail K. Gliniak B. Griffith T.S. Kubin M. Chin W. Jones J. Woodward A. Le T. et al.Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 157163Crossref Scopus (2200) Google Scholar). Thus, TRAIL has prospects of becoming an effective anticancer drug of the future. Recently, we observed that preincubation with the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) renders transformed keratinocytes resistant to the apoptotic effect of TRAIL (14Kothny-Wilkes G. Kulms D. Pöppelmann B. Luger T.A. Kubin M. Schwarz T J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29247-29253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The protective effect of IL-1 against TRAIL-induced apoptosis seems to be mediated via activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NFκB). The observation that transformed cells become resistant to TRAIL upon exposure to IL-1 was the first demonstration of a pathway that allows tumor cells to escape the killing effect of TRAIL. Because IL-1 is secreted by a variety of tumor cells (15Luger T.A. Schwarz T. Mukhtar H. Pharmacology of the Skin. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 283-313Google Scholar) and is also released by inflammatory cells participating in the tumor-host immune response (16Durum S.K. Oppenheim J.J. Neta R. Oppenheim J.J. Shevach E.M. Immunophysiology. The Role of Cells and Cytokines in Immunity and Inflammation. Oxford University Press, New York, Oxford1990: 210-225Google Scholar), tumors under these conditions could become resistant to TRAILin vivo. Therefore, we were interested in expanding these observations by studying whether the antiapoptotic effect of IL-1 is restricted to TRAIL or whether other apoptotic stimuli are inhibited as well. Here, we show that IL-1 protects transformed keratinocytes from TRAIL- and CD95-mediated apoptosis. In contrast, apoptosis induced by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation was not only not prevented by IL-1 but was even further enhanced. This opposite effect of IL-1 was also observed when studying the expression of the antiapoptotic proteins c-IAP1 and c-IAP2. Thus, these data suggest that antiapoptotic activity of a stimulus does not only depend on its nature but also on the stimulus causing apoptosis.

Irradiation of cells with UV light was performed using a bank of 4 FS20 bulbs (Westinghouse Electric Corp., Pittsburgh, PA) which emit most of their energy within the UVB range (290–320 nm) with an emission peak at 313 nm as described (18Köck A.

Subconfluent cells were exposed through PBS to a dose of 300 J/m2, unless otherwise stated. Recombinant human TRAIL protein was provided from Immunex Corp., Seattle, WA. This is a leucine zipper form of TRAIL that requires no further cross-linking for induction of maximal apoptotic acitivity (19Walczak H. Degli-Esposti M.A. Johnson R.S. Smolak P.J. Waugh J.Y. Boiani N. Timour M.S. Gerhart M.J. Schooley K.A. Smith C.A. Goodwin R.G. Rauch C.T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5386-5397Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Recombinant CD95L and an agonistic antibody against CD95 (CD95-Ab) were obtained from Alexis and Immunotech, respectively. Antibodies directed against caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) were obtained from Dianova, Hamburg and Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany, respectively. Antibodies directed against c-IAP1, c-IAP2, and the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Recombinant human IL-1β was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. TNFα was measured by use of an ultrasensitive TNFα enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Diaclone, Besancon, France). Plasmids allowing overexpression of a mutated IκB variant were kindly provided by K. Schulze-Osthoff, Münster, Germany (20Traenckner E.B.-M. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2838-2876Crossref Scopus (927) Google Scholar). For the detection of DNA fragmentation, a cell death detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used. The enrichment of mono- and oligonucleosomes released into the cytoplasm is calculated using the formula: absorbance of sample cells/absorbance of control cells. Enrichment factor was used as a parameter of apoptosis and shown on they axis as mean ± S.D. of triplicates. Quantitation of apoptosis by annexin V binding was performed using a commercially available kit (Bender Corp., Vienna, Austria). Briefly, cells were washed and resuspended in annexin V binding buffer. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated annexin V was added, and the samples were analyzed by flow cytometry (Epics XL, Coulter, Miami, FL). Cells were harvested and lysed in RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate) for 15 min on ice. After centrifugation, supernatants were collected, and the protein content measured using a Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad). Protein samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated with antibodies of interest. To monitor equal loading, membranes were reprobed with an antibody directed against α-tubulin (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). Signals were detected with an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK). Cells (1.5 × 107) were washed once with PBS and resuspended in 600 μl of PBS, 1.25% Me2SO. Cells were electroporated with 20 μg of each plasmid DNA according to the method described by Melkonyan et al. (21Melkonyan H. Sorg C. Klempt M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4356-4357Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Transfection efficiency of cells cotransfected with a plasmid encoding β-galactosidase (pcDNA6/VS-His/lacZ; Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) was determined 24 h later by staining with X-gal (100 μg/ml) in 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, and 1 mmMgCl2 in PBS. Aliquots of cells (2 × 105) were harvested 16 h after stimulation, washed once with PBS, and fixed with 0.8% paraformaldehyde for 5 min on ice. After washing, cells were treated with 0.3% saponine for 5 min on ice. Following centrifugation cells were incubated with the antibodies directed against c-IAP1 or c-IAP2 in 0.3% saponine at 4 °C overnight. Purified goat IgG was used as an isotype control. None of the stimuli used (TRAIL, CD95-Ab, UV radiation, IL-1) changed the isotype controls. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated with the respective fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody in 0.3% saponine for 30 min. Cells were washed, resuspended in 0.03% saponine/PBS, and subsequently analyzed in a flow cytometer. Because we had recently observed that IL-1 protects cells from TRAIL-induced apoptosis (14Kothny-Wilkes G. Kulms D. Pöppelmann B. Luger T.A. Kubin M. Schwarz T J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29247-29253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) we were interested in studying whether this effect is specific for TRAIL or whether IL-1 also protects cells from other apoptotic stimuli. Therefore, KB cells were exposed to TRAIL or to an agonistic CD95-Ab, which induces apoptosis via activation of CD95 (12Peter M.E. Krammer P.H. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Both TRAIL and CD95-Ab induced apoptotic cell death of KB cells, as determined by a cell death detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Fig. 1). When KB cells were preincubated with IL-1 for 15 min, cells were almost completely protected from the apoptotic effect of both TRAIL and the CD95-Ab. Similar data were obtained with HaCaT cells or when annexin V staining was used as a read-out system for apoptosis (data not shown). Thus, these data indicate that IL-1 rescues cells from TRAIL-mediated as well as from CD95-mediated apoptosis. Similar observations were obtained when instead of the CD95-Ab recombinant CD95L was used as the apoptotic stimulus (data not shown). We next investigated whether IL-1 also protects KB cells from UV-mediated apoptosis. Therefore, KB cells were exposed to 300 J/m2 in the absence or presence of IL-1 and apoptosis determined 16 h later. In contrast to CD95- and TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, prestimulation of KB cells with IL-1 did not protect cells from UV-induced apoptosis and even caused pronounced enhancement of cell death (Fig. 1). To exclude that the failure of IL-1 to rescue cells from UV-induced apoptosis is simply due to the fact that the dose of 300 J/m2 represents a too severe insult to the cells, lower UV doses were tested. As shown in Fig.2, UV irradiation induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, and in all cases IL-1 enhanced the apoptotic response. Caspase-3 is a member of the family of interleukin-1β converting enzyme proteases that is involved in CD95-, TRAIL-, and UV-mediated cell killing (22Enari M. Hug H. Nagata S. Nature. 1995; 375: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar, 23Schlegel J. Peter I. Orrenius S. Miller D.K. Thornberry N.A. Yamin T.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1841-1844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 24Aragane Y. Kulms D. Metze D. Kothny G. Pöppelmann B. Luger T.A. Schwarz T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 25Mariani S.M. Matiba B. Armandola E.A. Krammer P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). For activation, caspase-3 must be cleaved from its 32-kDa proform into its 17-kDa active form (26Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. et al.Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3766) Google Scholar). Thus, caspase-3 cleavage can serve as an additional read-out system to evaluate apoptosis. Therefore, KB cells were exposed to TRAIL, CD95-Ab, or to UV light either in the absence or presence of IL-1. Cell lysates were prepared 16 h later for Western blot analysis using an antibody against caspase-3. Because this antibody is directed against the caspase-3 proform, it cannot recognize the processed 17-kDa form, and a loss of the immunoreactive band in samples in which caspase-3 is activated can be observed. Significant reduction of the caspase-3 proform was observed in protein extracts of KB cells that were treated either with TRAIL, CD95-Ab, or UV light (Fig.3). Preincubation of cells with IL-1 almost completely prevented TRAIL- and CD95-induced caspase-3 activation. In contrast, IL-1 enhanced UV-induced caspase-3 activation, which is shown by the complete disappearance of the immunoreactive band. Caspase-3 cleaves the death substrate PARP (27Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyer S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2328) Google Scholar). Accordingly, PARP was cleaved from its intact 116-kDa form into the inactive 85-kDa fragment in samples of TRAIL-, CD95-Ab-, and UV-exposed KB cells (Fig. 3). IL-1 pretreatment significantly reduced TRAIL- and CD95-Ab-induced PARP cleavage, whereas UV-mediated cleavage of PARP was again enhanced in the presence of IL-1. Taken together, these data clearly demonstrate that IL-1 rescues cells from CD95- and TRAIL-induced apoptosis, whereas UV-induced apoptosis is even enhanced by IL-1. We recently proposed that IL-1 might rescue cells from TRAIL-induced apoptosis via activation of NFκB, because IL-1 activated NFκB in KB cells. Furthermore, inhibition of NFκB activation by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 antagonized the protective effect of IL-1 (14Kothny-Wilkes G. Kulms D. Pöppelmann B. Luger T.A. Kubin M. Schwarz T J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29247-29253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Activation of NFκB is associated with degradation of the inhibitory protein IκB by the proteasome pathway. Upon triggering of the IL-1 receptor, IκB becomes phosphorylated at the serine residues 32 and 36, which acts as a signal for ubiquination and subsequent degradation of IκB by the 26 S proteasome (28Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1908) Google Scholar, 29Traenckner E.B.-M. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5433-544129Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Thus, IκB degradation and consequently NFκB activation can be blocked by proteasome inhibitors such as MG132 or lactacystin (29Traenckner E.B.-M. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5433-544129Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). However, the approach using proteasome inhibitors provides only indirect evidence that the protective effect of IL-1 is due to activation of NFκB, because one cannot exclude that the inhibitors like MG132 may affect other pathways as well. Thus, we addressed whether IL-1 protects KB cells from TRAIL- and CD95-mediated apoptosis via activation of NFκB by overexpressing a super-repressor form of IκB. In this mutant form, two point mutations (Ser-32 → Ala, Ser-36 → Ala) prevent phosphorylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation of IκB (20Traenckner E.B.-M. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2838-2876Crossref Scopus (927) Google Scholar). As a consequence, NFκB release, nuclear translocation, and functional DNA binding is prevented. Whereas KB cells transfected with the empty cytomegalovirus vector were still rescued by IL-1, the protective effect of IL-1 on TRAIL- and CD95-induced apoptosis was significantly reduced in cells transfected with the IκB super-repressor (Fig. 4). These results support the concept that IL-1-mediated protection from TRAIL- and CD95-induced apoptosis is dependent on NFκB activation. Because IL-1 protected KB cells from CD95- and TRAIL-induced apoptosis but enhanced UV-mediated cell death, we were interested in elucidating the mechanism underlying this heterogenous effect. It has recently been reported that NFκB may exert its antiapoptotic effect via induction of several proteins including the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP) c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 (30Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2552) Google Scholar). Therefore we investigated how IL-1 affects c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 expression in KB cells exposed to the different apoptotic stimuli. Intracellular protein expression evaluated by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis revealed that KB cells express c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 constitutively (Fig.5). Exposure of KB cells to either TRAIL, CD95-Ab, or UV light caused a down-regulation of both c-IAP proteins. IL-1 alone only marginally enhanced constitutive c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 expression (data not shown), but reversed CD95- and TRAIL-induced down-regulation of c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 partially (Fig. 5). The opposite effect was exerted by IL-1 when cells were exposed to UV light. In this case, IL-1 did not reverse reduced c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 protein levels, but even slightly further enhanced the down-regulation. Taken together, IL-1 appears to affect c-IAP levels differentially depending on the stimulus that induces apoptosis. The further reduction of c-IAP expression in UV-exposed cells by IL-1 might be an explanation why IL-1 enhances UV-induced apoptosis. TNFα can generate two types of signals, one that induces apoptosis (31Hale A.J. Smith C.A. Sutherland L.C. Stoenman V.E.A. Longthorne V.L. Culhane A.C. Williams G.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar) and one that activates NFκB (32Barinaga M. Science. 1996; 273: 735-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The overall result in a specific cell type under specific conditions appears to be dependent on the balance of the two signals (32Barinaga M. Science. 1996; 273: 735-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). When KB cells were treated with TNFα in addition to TRAIL, an enhancement of apoptosis was observed (data not shown), indicating that under these conditions the death signal caused by TNFα overrules activation of NFκB. Consequently, both stimuli induce apoptosis in an additive way. Because TNFα can be released by KB cells (18Köck A. Schwarz T. Kirnbauer R. Urbanski A. Perry P. Ansel J.C. Luger T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1609-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar) we looked into whether the enhancing effect of IL-1 on UV-induced apoptosis might be due to autocrine release of TNFα. To address this issue, KB and HaCaT cells, respectively, were exposed to TRAIL, CD95-Ab, or UV radiation in the absence or presence of IL-1. KB and HaCaT cells did not constitutively release TNFα. IL-1, TRAIL, or CD95-Ab alone or in any combination induced TNFα secretion only marginally. whereas UV irradiation induced moderate release of TNFα. In contrast, when cells were stimulated with UV light plus IL-1, dramatically enhanced TNFα release was observed (Table I). To substantiate that TNFα released under these conditions is involved in the enhanced induction of apoptosis, an antibody neutralizing the TNF receptor type 1 which mediates apoptosis (34Haridas V. Drany B.G. Natarajan K. Heller R. Aggarwal B.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3152-3162PubMed Google Scholar) was used. Preincubation with the antibody caused a complete loss of the enhancing effect of IL-1 on UV-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6). This indicates that increased apoptosis of UV-exposed KB and HaCaT cells in the presence of IL-1 is due to the autocrine release of TNFα, which then enhances apoptosis.Table IExposure of keratinocytes to IL-1 and UV radiation results in excessive release of TNFαTNFα releaseTreatmentaKB and HaCaT cells were left untreated (−) or exposed to TRAIL (32 ng/ml), CD95-Ab (1 μg/ml), or UV radiation (300 J/m2) in the absence or presence of IL-1β (10 ng/ml).KBHaCaTpg/ml−0.490.5IL-10.801.00TRAIL0.410.46IL-1 + TRAIL0.880.97CD95-Ab0.480.50IL-1 + CD95-Ab0.900.95UV1.0010.00IL-1 + UV55.0070.0016 h after stimulation, supernatants were collected and TNFα levels were measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.a KB and HaCaT cells were left untreated (−) or exposed to TRAIL (32 ng/ml), CD95-Ab (1 μg/ml), or UV radiation (300 J/m2) in the absence or presence of IL-1β (10 ng/ml). Open table in a new tab 16 h after stimulation, supernatants were collected and TNFα levels were measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Recently, IL-1 was shown to protect tumor cells from the apoptotic effect of TRAIL (14Kothny-Wilkes G. Kulms D. Pöppelmann B. Luger T.A. Kubin M. Schwarz T J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29247-29253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Because IL-1 can be released by a variety of tumor cells (15Luger T.A. Schwarz T. Mukhtar H. Pharmacology of the Skin. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 283-313Google Scholar) and is also released by inflammatory cells participating in the tumor-host immune response (16Durum S.K. Oppenheim J.J. Neta R. Oppenheim J.J. Shevach E.M. Immunophysiology. The Role of Cells and Cytokines in Immunity and Inflammation. Oxford University Press, New York, Oxford1990: 210-225Google Scholar), cancer cells under these conditions may escape the possible therapeutic effect of TRAIL. In this study, we demonstrate that IL-1 does not only protect transformed cells from TRAIL- but also from CD95-mediated apoptosis. This effect of IL-1 is clearly due to activation of NFκB, because inhibition of NFκB by overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of IκB prevented protection by IL-1. Protection from CD95-induced apoptosis by IL-1 might also affect the activity of those chemotherapeutic drugs that exert their cytotoxic effect via the CD95/CD95L system (3Friesen X. Herr I.

This assumption is also supported by the observation that activation of NFκB protects cells against apoptosis induced by the cytostatic drug daunorubicin (35Wang C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S.

Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2498) Google Scholar), and, as demonstrated in this study, from CD95-mediated cell death, NFκB appears to protect from apoptosis in general. Thus, it was quite surprising to observe that IL-1 did not protect but even enhanced apoptosis induced by UV radiation. Recently it was reported that CD95 is critically involved in UV-mediated apoptosis (24Aragane Y. Kulms D. Metze D. Kothny G. Pöppelmann B. Luger T.A. Schwarz T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 39Rehemtulla A. Hamilton C.A. Chinnaiyan A.M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

Cell Res. 1997; 232: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). UV radiation can directly activate the death receptor by inducing functional aggregation of CD95 (24Aragane Y. Kulms D. Metze D. Kothny G. Pöppelmann B. Luger T.A. Schwarz T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 39Rehemtulla A. Hamilton C.A. Chinnaiyan A.M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25783-25786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Inhibition of CD95 clustering following UV exposure reduces but does not completely block apoptosis (24Aragane Y. Kulms D. Metze D. Kothny G. Pöppelmann B. Luger T.A. Schwarz T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), implying that besides the CD95 pathway other mechanisms must be involved as well. This assumption is supported by the present findings: if UV-induced apoptosis was to be exclusively mediated by CD95, both CD95- and UV-induced apoptosis would be inhibitable by the same interventions. In this case, IL-1 should have protected KB and HaCaT cells not only from CD95- but also from UV-induced apoptosis. According to recent reports (30Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2552) Google Scholar, 33Stehlik C. de Martin R. Kumabashiri I. Schmid J.A. Binder B.R. Lipp J. J. Exp.

Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar, 42Wu M.X. Ao Z. Prasad K.V.S. Wu R. Schlossman S.F. Science. 1998; 281: 998-1001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), NFκB appears to exert its antiapoptotic effects via the induction of antiapoptotic proteins, including c-IAP1, c-IAP2, X-linked IAP, and IEX-1L. Therefore, we were interested in the effect IL-1 may exert on the expression of IAPs in cells exposed either to TRAIL, CD95-Ab, or UV light. Intracellular protein measurements revealed that all three apoptotic stimuli reduced levels of c-IAP1 and c-IAP2, although at different levels. c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 appear to exert their antiapoptotic activity by specifically binding to the terminal effector domains of caspase-3 and -7 (43Roy N. Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6914-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar). In contrast to the mode of action of these proteins, little is known about how c-IAPs are regulated, except that they are under control of NFκB and that c-IAP2 can exert a positive feedback control on NFκB via an IκB targeting mechanism (44Chu Z.L. McKinsey T.A. Liu L. Gentry J.J. Malim M.H. Ballard D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10057-10062Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). This study for the first time demonstrates negative regulation of c-IAP expression by apoptotic stimuli. Because this was assessed only by determining the protein expression, we do not as yet know whether this inhibition is transcriptionally regulated. Although the mechanisms by which c-IAPs are down-regulated remain to be determined, this phenomenon might be of relevance for the execution of apoptosis. CD95- and TRAIL-mediated down-regulation of both c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 was partially antagonized by IL-1. Thus, induction of c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 might be the mechanism by which IL-1 rescues cells from CD95- and TRAIL-induced apoptosis. In contrast, UV-mediated down-regulation of c-IAPs was not restored by IL-1 but even further enhanced slightly. Although we do not yet know the mechanism by which IL-1 affects c-IAP expression in such a different way, the present data indicate that whether a signal acts in an antiapoptotic way or not does not only depend on the signal itself but also on the stimulus causing apoptosis. The apoptotic effects of TNFα on most cells can only be observed when protein synthesis is blocked, suggesting that de novoprotein synthesis protects cells by induction of antiapoptotic genes (35Wang C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2498) Google Scholar). Keratinocytes are able to release TNFα (18Köck A. Schwarz T. Kirnbauer R. Urbanski A. Perry P. Ansel J.C. Luger T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1609-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), and we therefore hypothesized that enhancement of UV-induced apoptosis by IL-1 may be mediated by the autocrine release of TNFα. Because protective c-IAPs are down-regulated upon UV-exposure, under these conditions the apoptotic effect of TNFα could dominate the activation of NFκB. Indeed, the enhancing effect of IL-1 on UV-induced apoptosis was completely reversed when the experiment was performed in the presence of an antibody, which blocks the TNF-receptor type 1. Accordingly, excessively enhanced levels of TNFα were detected when cells were exposed to UV radiation in the presence of IL-1. Neither TRAIL nor CD95-Ab synergized with IL-1 to induce TNFα release from KB or HaCaT cells. Thus, this observation is compatible with our hypothesis that down-regulation of c-IAPs preconditions the cells for the killing effect of TNFα. Taken together, the present study demonstrates that IL-1 can exert diverse effects on apoptosis. TRAIL- and CD95-mediated apoptosis is significantly reduced by IL-1 via activation of NFκB, whereas UV-mediated apoptosis is remarkably enhanced via the autocrine release of TNFα. Thus, IL-1 cannot be regarded as an antiapoptotic cytokine in general. Furthermore, these findings suggest that whether a stimulus affects apoptosis in a positive or negative way does not exclusively depend on the nature of the stimulus itself but also on the signal that induces apoptosis. As demonstrated here, completely opposite effects can be obtained in different apoptosis systems. We thank J. Bückmann and P. Wissel for preparing the graphs and A.

RPA contains an evolutionarily conserved 4-cysteine-type zinc finger motif (X 3CX 2–4CX 12–15CX 2C) that has a potential role in regulation of DNA replication and repair (Dong, J., Park, J-S., and Lee, S-H. (1999) Biochem. J.337, 311–317 and Lin, Y.-L., Shivji, M. K. K., Chen, C., Kolodner, R., Wood, R. D., and Dutta, A. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 1453–1461), even though the zinc finger itself is not essential for its DNA binding activity (Kim, D. K., Stigger, E., and Lee, S.-H. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 15124–15129). Here, we show that RPA single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding activity is regulated by reduction-oxidation (redox) through its zinc finger domain. RPA-ssDNA interaction was stimulated 10-fold by the reducing agent, dithiothreitol (DTT), whereas treatment of RPA with oxidizing agent, diazene dicarboxylic acid bis[N,N-dimethylamide] (diamide), significantly reduced this interaction. The effect of diamide was reversed by the addition of excess DTT, suggesting that RPA ssDNA binding activity is regulated by redox. Redox regulation of RPA-ssDNA interaction was more effective in the presence of 0.2 m NaCl or higher. Cellular redox factor, thioredoxin, was able to replace DTT in stimulation of RPA DNA binding activity, suggesting that redox protein may be involved in RPA modulation in vivo. In contrast to wild-type RPA, zinc finger mutant (cysteine to alanine mutation at amino acid 486) did not require DTT for its ssDNA binding activity and is not affected by redox. Together, these results suggest a novel function for a putative zinc finger in the regulation of RPA DNA binding activity through cellular redox.

In simian virus 40 (SV40) replication, RPA mediates unwinding of replication origin in the presence of SV40 T-antigen and topoisomerase I/II. During replication, it interacts with SV40 T-antigen and DNA polymerase α-primase (pol α-primase) complex (6Dornreiter I. Erdile L.F. Gilbert I.U. von Winkler D. Kelly T.J. Fanning E.

RPA is also involved in the elongation phase of DNA replication, because it stimulates pol α, pol δ, and pol ε activity on a primed template DNA (10Kenny M.K. Lee S.-H. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

RPA stabilizes the XPA-damaged DNA complex through the interaction with XPA, which appears to be essential for DNA repair (14Li L. Lu X. Peterson C.A. Legerski R.J. Mol. Cell.

RPA is also involved in the later stage of nucleotide excision repair, gap-filling reaction, in collaboration with proliferating cell nuclear antigen, replication factor-C, and pol δ (or pol ε) (19Aboussekhra A. Biggerstaff M. Shivji M.K. Vilpo J.A. Moncollin V. Podust V.N. Protic M. Hubscher U. Egly J.M. Wood R.D. Cell. 1995; 80: 859-868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). In homologous recombination, RPA physically interacts with Rad51 and Rad52, which appears to be essential for initiation of recombination (20Park M.S. Ludwig D.L. Stigger E. Lee S.-H. J. Biol.

The large subunit of RPA, p70, has multiple functional domains, including pol α stimulation, ssDNA binding, and a conserved zinc finger domain with 4-cysteine type (3Kim D.-K. Stigger E. Lee S.-H. J.

Pfuetzner R.A. Edwards A.M. Frappier L. Nature. 1997; 385: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The DNA binding domain but not the polymerase stimulation domain is essential for the function of RPA in replication (27Kim D.-K. Stigger E. Lee S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15124-15129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Both yeast RPA and human RPA share a highly conserved putative metal binding domain of the 4-cysteine type (X 3CX 2–4CX 12–15CX 2C) toward the C terminus (amino acids 478–503) (28Erdile L.F.

Zinc finger domain in several DNA-binding proteins such as SP1 transcription factors and adenovirus DNA-binding protein plays a key role in the interaction with DNA (30Pan T. Coleman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2077-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 31Eagle P.A. Klessig D.F. Virology. 1992; 187: 777-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 32Narayan V.A.

Deletion analysis indicated that the zinc finger domain of RPA, unlike others, is not essential for its ssDNA binding activity (2Lin Y.-L. Shivji M.K.K. Chen C. Kolodner R. Wood R.D. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1453-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 4Gomes X.V. Henricksen L.A. Wold M.S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 15124-15129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, mutation at the zinc finger domain differentially affected its function in replication and nucleotide excision repair (1Dong J. Park J-S. Lee S-H. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 2Lin Y.-L. Shivji M.K.K. Chen C. Kolodner R. Wood R.D. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1453-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible role for zinc finger domain in regulation. In mammalian cells, DNA damage or heat shock induces inhibition of replication that can be efficiently reversed by the addition of human RPA (33Carty M.P. Zernik-Kobak M. McGrath S. Dixon K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2114-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 34Wang Y. Perrault A.R. Iliakis G. Radiat. Res. 1998; 149: 284-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for RPA in regulation of DNA replication in response to environmental stress. It is not clear how RPA is involved in stress-induced replication arrest; however, an observation with severe combined immunodeficient mice cells (35Fried L.M. Koumenis C. Peterson S.R. Green S.L. van Zijl P. Allalunis-Turner J. Chen D.J. Fishel R. Giaccia A.J. Brown J.M. Kirchgessner C.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13825-13830Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) argues that RPA phosphorylation by ionizing radiation correlates with its reduced ssDNA binding activity, suggesting a possible role of RPA phosphorylation in stress-induced replication arrest. In contrast, anin vitro experiment with hyperphosphorylated form of RPA demonstrated that DNA replication and repair activities were not affected by RPA p34 phosphorylation (36Pan Z.Q. Park C.H. Amin A.A. Hurwitz J. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4636-4640Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that RPA ssDNA binding activity is regulated through its zinc finger domain via reduction-oxidation (redox), one of the major regulatory mechanisms in response to environmental stress. A possible role for zinc finger domain in redox regulation is discussed below. Thioredoxin,N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), and diamide (diazene dicarboxylic acid bis[N,N-dimethylamide]) were obtained from Sigma, and DTT was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. RPA was prepared according to the procedure described previously (37Stigger E. Dean F.B. Hurwitz J. Lee S.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, lysates were prepared from insect cells (Sf-9) coinfected with recombinant baculoviruses encoding wild-type p11, wild-type p34, and either wild-type or mutant p70. After adjusting the salt concentration to 0.5 m NaCl, lysates were loaded onto a ssDNA cellulose column equilibrated with buffer A (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmDTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.2 μg/ml antipain) containing 0.5 m NaCl. The column was successively washed with 20 column volumes of the buffer A containing 0.5 m NaCl and 0.8 m NaCl. The proteins were eluted with buffer A containing 2.0 m NaCl, 40% ethylene glycol. The eluted fractions were diluted 5-fold with buffer A and loaded onto an Affi-Gel Blue (Bio-Rad) column that was equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.5 m NaCl. After washing the column with buffer A containing 0.5 m NaCl and 0.8 m NaCl, proteins were eluted with buffer containing 2.5 m NaCl, 40% ethylene glycol. The RPA-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against buffer A containing 50 mm NaCl and further purified on a Q-Sepharose column with a linear salt gradient (50 mmto 0.4 m NaCl). All purification procedures were carried out at 4 °C, and during purification, RPA was monitored by immunoblotting using anti-p70 and -p34 antibodies (37Stigger E. Dean F.B. Hurwitz J. Lee S.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The fractions with at least 90% purity by Coomassie staining were collected and stored at −80 °C until use. Oligo(dT)50 was 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (ICN) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) based on the manufacturer's instructions. The indicated amount of wild-type or mutant RPA was incubated with 100 fmol of 5′-32P-labeled oligo(dT)50 at room temperature for 15 min in the reaction mixtures (30 μl) containing 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.8), 10 mm MgCl2, poly(dI·dC) (0.2 μg), bovine serum albumin (0.2 μg/μl), and indicated amounts of DTT or NaCl. Protein-DNA complexes were analyzed using 5% polyacrylamide gels in 1 × Tris borate EDTA (acrylamide:bisacrylamide = 79:1). The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray films (Eastman Kodak Co). The bands of interest were excised from the gels and measured for radioactivity using a Beckman Scintillation Counter LS 6500. In an effort to understand the regulatory function of RPA, we examined whether RPA ssDNA binding activity is affected by redox. For this, RPA was preincubated with various amounts of DTT and examined for its interaction with oligo(dT)50 in the presence of 200 mm NaCl. RPA-DNA complex was analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay on polyacrylamide gel under equilibrium conditions (Fig. 1 a and data not shown). A very low RPA-DNA complex was formed in the absence of DTT, which was stimulated up to 10-fold by the addition of DTT (Fig. 1 a). To examine redox regulation further, RPA was treated with the oxidizing agent diamide in the presence of 0.4 mm DTT. The addition of increasing amounts of diamide gradually decreased the formation of RPA-DNA complex (Fig. 1 b). The inhibitory effect of diamide (3.2 mm) on RPA-DNA interaction was reversed by DTT only when added more than the stoichiometric amounts (Fig. 1 c;lanes 7–8). These results strongly suggest that RPA ssDNA binding activity is regulated by redox potential. We then examined how redox potential affects RPA DNA binding affinity. In the absence of DTT, RPA ssDNA binding activity was sensitive to NaCl, whereas under reducing conditions (1 mm DTT), RPA formed a stable complex with ssDNA even in the presence of 1.0 mNaCl (Fig. 2 a). This result suggests that redox affects RPA ssDNA binding affinity such that RPA-ssDNA interaction was significantly enhanced under reducing conditions. Thioredoxin and redox factor-1 (ref-1; also known as apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease) have previously been shown to mediate redox regulation of nuclear proteins such as transcription factor, activator protein-1, and glucocorticoid receptor (38Xanthoudakis S. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 39Grippo J.F. Holmgren A. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 93-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As part of an effort to identify a cellular factor(s) involved in redox regulation of RPA, we also examined whether RPA DNA binding activity can be modulated by thioredoxin, a ubiquitous redox enzyme involved in the formation of reversible disulfide bonds (40Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation of RPA with thioredoxin stimulated RPA-ssDNA complex under conditions where RPA itself or with the buffer (without thioredoxin) showed no DNA binding activity (Fig. 2 b), suggesting that RPA DNA binding activity may be regulated by a redox protein in vivo. Cellular redox plays a key role in modulating DNA binding activity of several transcription factors, such as Fos-Jun (41Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher III F.J. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar), CCAAT-binding factor (also known as NF-Y) (42Nakshatri H. Bhat-Nakshatri P. Currie R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28784-28791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), p53 (43Jayaraman L. Murthy K.G.K. Zhu C. Curran T. Xanthoudakis S. Curran T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 558-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), and Pax 8 (44Tell G. Scaloni A. Pellizzari L. Formisano S. Pucillo C. Damante G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25062-25072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of these proteins indicated that cysteine residues are involved in redox regulation (38Xanthoudakis S. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 42Nakshatri H. Bhat-Nakshatri P. Currie R.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 25062-25072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). RPA ssDNA binding activity was sensitive to diamide (Fig.1 b), a chemical that catalyzes the oxidation of free sulfhydryl groups (45Kosower N.S. Kosower E.M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible involvement of cysteine residues in the redox-dependent DNA binding activity of RPA. We therefore examined whether RPA ssDNA binding activity is sensitive to NEM, which alkylates the free sulfhydryl group (Fig.3). NEM treatment completely abolished RPA ssDNA binding activity (Fig. 3, lanes 5–7), whereas RPA DNA binding activity was not affected by NEM when added after DTT, suggesting that the effect of NEM on RPA DNA binding activity is due to the alkylation of sulfhydryl group (Fig. 3, lanes 8–10). The inhibitory effect of NEM on RPA ssDNA binding activity strongly indicates that cysteine residues are involved in the redox regulation of RPA DNA binding activity. RPA p70 contains an evolutionarily conserved 4-cysteine-type zinc finger domain at amino acids 478–503 (28Erdile L.F. Heyer W.-D. Kolodner R. Kelly T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12090-12098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Even though previous studies showed that the zinc finger domain is not essential for DNA binding activity of RPA (3Kim D.-K. Stigger E. Lee S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15124-15129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 4Gomes X.V. Henricksen L.A. Wold M.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5586-5595Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 5Lin Y.-L. Chen C. Keshav K.F. Winchester E. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 (-): 17190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), it is possible that RPA DNA binding domain is subjected to regulation by the zinc finger. We therefore examined whether the cysteine residues of the zinc finger domain are involved in redox regulation of its ssDNA binding activity. In contrast to wild-type RPA, zinc finger mutant-4 (ZFM-4; Cys to Ala mutation at amino acids 481, 486, 500, and 503) formed a stable complex with ssDNA even under nonreducing conditions, and the addition of DTT had no effect on its DNA binding activity (Fig.4 a). Two other zinc finger mutants, ZFM-1 (Cys to Ala at amino acid 486) and ZFM-2 (Cys to Ala mutation at 481 and 486), also formed a very stable complex with ssDNA in the absence of DTT, which was not affected by DTT (Fig.4 b). To further examine redox regulation of zinc finger domain, wild-type RPA and ZFM-4 were treated with the oxidizing agent, H2O2, in the presence of 0.4 mm DTT (Fig. 4 c). The addition of increasing amounts of H2O2 significantly reduced the RPA-DNA complex, whereas zinc finger mutant (ZFM-4) (1Dong J. Park J-S. Lee S-H. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) was much less affected by H2O2 treatment (Fig. 4 c). These results strongly suggest that the zinc finger is involved in the redox regulation of RPA ssDNA binding activity and that the cysteine residues of p70, in particular cysteine 486, are essential for this regulation. If RPA is a Zn(II) metalloprotein and Zn(II) is bound to the 4-cysteine complex, the presence of Zn(II) would be able to protect these cysteines from oxidation. To test this, we examined whether a strong divalent cation chelator, o-phenanthroline, affects RPA ssDNA binding activity in response to redox change. The addition ofo-phenanthroline abolished the stimulatory effect of DTT on RPA ssDNA binding activity (Fig.5 a), suggesting a positive role for Zn(II) in redox regulation of RPA. In contrast,p-phenanthroline, a nonchelating agent, had no effect on the stimulation of RPA ssDNA binding activity (data not shown). To investigate this further, we compared wt-RPA and zinc finger mutant (ZFM4; Cys to Ala mutations at 481, 486, 500, and 503) for their ssDNA binding activity in the presence of o-phenanthroline. The ssDNA binding activity of wt-RPA was sensitive too-phenanthroline in the presence of DTT, whereas ZFM4 was not affected at all by this chelating agent (Fig. 5 b). Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of o-phenanthroline on RPA ssDNA binding was reversed by the addition of Zn(II), indicating that the inhibitory effect of o-phenanthroline on RPA ssDNA binding is due to chelation of Zn(II) (Fig. 5 c). Together, these results strongly suggest that Zn(II) is involved in supporting the model for the role of zinc finger domain in redox regulation (Fig.6 b).Figure 6A proposed model for redox-mediated change in zinc finger structure and regulation of RPA DNA binding activity. a, zinc finger domain (X 3CX 2–4CX 12–15CX 2C) of eukaryotic RPA.

Berg J.M. Science. 1998; 282: 2018-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). A number of zinc finger proteins have been identified in which their DNA binding activity is regulated by redox, although the role of the zinc finger in this regulation is not clear (47Hutchison K.A. Matic G. Meshinchi S. Bresnick E.H. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10505-10509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Gowen L.C. Avrutskaya A.V. Latour A.M. Koller B.H. Leadon S.A.

Biol. 1996; 16: 1035-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that RPA ssDNA binding activity is regulated by redox through the cysteines in a putative zinc finger domain. The 4-cysteine type zinc finger is evolutionarily conserved among eukaryotic RPA and contains highly conserved hydrophobic and charged amino acids that may be important for the formation of zinc finger structure (Fig. 6 a). The 4-cysteine zinc finger contains Zn(II), which tetrahedrally coordinates four cysteine residues (50Luisi B.F. Xu W.X. Otwinowski Z. Freedman L.P. Yamamoto K.R. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1991; 352: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar). Under reducing conditions, the zinc finger structure is favorably formed, and Zn(II), buried in the interior, stabilizes the module by binding 4 cysteines (Fig. 6 b). This zinc finger structure protects cysteine 486 (and other cysteine residues) from being engaged in the formation of disulfide bond(s). Under nonreducing (or oxidized) conditions, however, oxidation of Zn(II)-thiolate bond induces the releases of Zn(II) from the zinc finger (51Casadevall M. Sarkar B. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1998; 71: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which promotes the formation of disulfide bonds between the cysteine 486 and other cysteine (Fig. 6 b). It is reasonable to assume that one disulfide bond is formed between cysteine 486 and the other cysteine, because the Cys to Ala mutation at amino acid 486 was sufficient enough to make it redox-insensitive (Fig. 6 b). In fact, our study on the reactivity of cysteine residues to 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) indicated that two zinc finger-derived cysteines are lost on oxidation (data not shown), supporting a model that a single disulfide bond is formed in the zinc finger domain. Disulfide bonds may be formed between cysteine 486 and the other cysteine in the zinc finger region, which induces a structural change that interferes with the DNA binding domain of p70 (Fig. 6 b). Alternatively, a disulfide bond may be formed between cysteine 486 and the other cysteine outside of the zinc finger, which leads to the alteration of protein conformation that affects RPA DNA binding activity. To understand the role of zinc finger further, a direct measurement of the actual release of Zn(II) from RPA upon oxidation by atomic absorption or by spectrophotometric measurement using 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol needs to be done once we have enough RPA. In T4 bacteriophage, removal of the intrinsic Zn(II) ion in its single-stranded DNA-binding protein (T4 gene 32) resulted in facile oxidation of the cysteine, which significantly decreased ssDNA binding activity (52Giedroc D.P. Qiu H. Khan R. King G.C. Chen K. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 765-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In T4 gene 32, models for the oxidized and metal-free protein are essentially inactive while reduced, and fully metal-bound forms are active in ssDNA binding (52Giedroc D.P. Qiu H. Khan R. King G.C. Chen K. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 765-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 53Qiu H. Kodadek T. Giedroc D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2773-2781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the substitutional mutation of metal binding cysteine to serine in T4 gene 32 was essentially inactive in ssDNA binding (52Giedroc D.P. Qiu H. Khan R. King G.C. Chen K. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 765-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), whereas a zinc finger mutation of human RPA (single-stranded DNA-binding protein) made it redox-insensitive without affecting its ssDNA binding activity (Fig.4). These results suggest that Zn(II) binding cysteine(s) of T4 gene 32 is an essential element for its ssDNA binding, but that of human RPA functions as a regulatory element. Redox regulation of RPA likely occurs in vivo because RPA is involved in replication arrest in response to environmental stress (33Carty M.P. Zernik-Kobak M. McGrath S. Dixon K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2114-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar,34Wang Y. Perrault A.R. Iliakis G. Radiat. Res. 1998; 149: 284-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). 2J-S. Park, M. Wang, and S-H. Lee, unpublished data. Even though the formation of disulfide bond is favorable under oxidized conditions, it is still possible that cysteine 486 exists another oxidized formin vivo. For example, involvement of the glutathione/glutathione disulfide redox pair, an important cellular defense against oxidative stress (55Thomas J.A. Poland B. Honzatko R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), is considered a possibility. Another example of oxidative signaling is S-nitrosylation of cysteine residues in p21ras oncogene by nitric oxide (56Lander H.M. Milbank A.J. Tauras J.M. Hajjar D.P. Hempastead B.L. Schwartz G.D. Kraemer R.T. Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Campbell B.S. Quilliam L.A. Nature. 1996; 381: 380-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), even though it is unclear whether this is a reversible intercellular-signaling scheme. Zinc finger proteins are one of the largest classes of DNA-binding proteins and are the major targets for redox regulation since they all contain cysteine residues as part of the metal binding finger structure, which are essential for DNA binding activity (46Clarke N.D. Berg J.M. Science. 1998; 282: 2018-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Cysteine residues have been identified in several non-zinc finger transcription factors as involved in redox regulation of their DNA binding activity (42Nakshatri H. Bhat-Nakshatri P. Currie R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28784-28791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 57Xanthoudakis S. Miao G. Wang F. Pan Y.C. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3323-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether the zinc finger itself is directly involved in redox regulation simply because the zinc finger is an essential DNA binding component and any mutation at a cysteine residue (of zinc finger) will irreversibly inactivate DNA binding activity. Unlike these zinc finger proteins, the RPA zinc finger is not a DNA binding component and has a little or no effect on its DNA binding activity (1Dong J. Park J-S. Lee S-H. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 3Kim D.-K. Stigger E. Lee S.-H. J. Biol.

We conclude from this study that the RPA zinc finger has a role in regulating its DNA binding activity through redox change, which may be involved in regulation of DNA metabolism in response to various environmental stress.

Rat livers were perfused, in the nonrecirculating mode, with 0.3 mm NH4Cl and either 2-15N- or 5-15N-labeled glutamine (1 mm). The isotopic enrichment of the two nitrogenous precursor pools (ammonia and aspartate) involved in urea synthesis as well as the production of [15N]urea isotopomers were determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. This information was used to examine the hypothesis that 5-N of glutamine is directly channeled to carbamyl phosphate (CP) synthesis. The results indicate that the predominant metabolic fate of [2-15N] and [5-15N]glutamine is incorporation into urea. Glucagon significantly stimulated the uptake of 15N-labeled glutamine and its metabolism via phosphate-dependent glutaminase (PDG) to form U m+1 andU m+2 (urea containing one or two atoms of15N). However, insulin had little effect compared with control. The [5-15N]glutamine primarily entered into urea via ammonia incorporation into CP, whereas the [2-15N]glutamine was predominantly incorporated via aspartate. This is evident from the relative enrichments of aspartate and of citrulline generated from each substrate. Furthermore, the data indicate that the 15NH3 that was generated in the mitochondria by either PDG (from 5-15N) or glutamate dehydrogenase (from 2-15N) enjoys the same partition between incorporation into CP or exit from the mitochondria. Thus, there is no evidence for preferential access for ammonia that arises by the action of PDG to carbamyl-phosphate synthetase. To the contrary, we provide strong evidence that such ammonia is metabolized without any such metabolic channeling. The glucagon-induced increase in [15N]urea synthesis was associated with a significant elevation in hepatic N-acetylglutamate concentration. Therefore, the hormonal regulation of [15N]urea isotopomer production depends upon the coordinate action of the mitochondrial PDG pathway and the synthesis ofN-acetylglutamate (an obligatory activator of CP). The current study may provide the theoretical and methodological foundations for in vivo investigations of the relationship between the hepatic urea cycle enzyme activities, the flux of15N-labeled glutamine into the urea cycle, and the production of urea isotopomers.

More recently, we developed a theoretical framework that described the incorporation of 15N from15NH4Cl into urea and that predicted the proportions of U m, U m+1, and U m+2 isotopomers of urea produced (containing no, one, or two atoms of 15N) as a function of the isotopic enrichment of the two nitrogenous precursor pools for urea. We experimentally validated this model in the isolated perfused rat liver (4Brosnan J.T. Brosnan M.E. Charron R. Nissim I. J. Biol.

We have also examined the incorporation of15N from [5-15N]glutamine into urea in isolated hepatocytes and examined effects of pH and hormones on this process (3Nissim I. Yudkoff M. Brosnan J.T. J.

These latter studies showed that our theoretical framework for prediction of the labeling patterns of urea was also valid in the hepatocyte model and that alkalosis and glucagon were powerful stimuli for increased flux through hepatic glutaminase and the urea cycle. They also showed important effects of hormones and of pH on the hepatocyte concentration of N-acetylglutamate (N-AG), the obligatory activator of carbamyl-phosphate synthetase-I (CPS-I) (5Hall L.M.

We used 2-15N- or 5-15N-labeled glutamine and GC-MS to address the following questions: (i) What is the relative incorporation of 15NH3, formed from 15N-labeled glutamine via the PDG (from 5-15N) and/or GDH (from 2-15N) pathway, into citrulline or aspartate, and thereby, [15N] urea isotopomers? (ii) Is the hepatic intramitochondrial pool of 15NH3 (formed via either PDG or GDH) in equilibrium with the perfusate NH3pool? (iii) Does production of [15N]urea isotopomers depend on the species of 15N-labeled glutamine,i.e. amino versus amido 15N? The results of these determinations were used to examine the hypothesis that the 5-N of glutamine is directly channeled to carbamyl phosphate synthesis (9Meijer A.J.

The data demonstrate that glucagon stimulated the flux through the PDG pathway and the formation of [15N]urea mass isotopomers from [2-15N]glutamine or [5-15N]glutamine. However, insulin has little effect on the flux through the PDG pathway and the formation of [15N]urea. The increased urea synthesis with glucagon was coupled with an increased hepatic level of N-AG. There was no evidence for a metabolic channeling between glutaminase and carbamyl-phosphate synthetase.DISCUSSIONIn the current study we used a series of liver perfusion experiments to examine the role of glucagon or insulin in the regulation of the 15N enrichment of the two nitrogenous precursor pools involved in urea synthesis as well as the production of mass isotopomers of [15N]urea from either 2-15N- or 5-15N-labeled glutamine.

Elucidation of the hormonal regulation of [15N]urea mass isotopomer production from15N-labeled glutamine is of special importance both in normal and catabolic states such as sepsis or after surgery, when the liver consumes large quantities of glutamine (12Brosnan J.T.

Res. 1992; 53: 298-305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).We employ the single-pass isolated perfused rat liver, because this model preserves the normal lobular microcirculation of the liver and avoids problems that may arise because of recycling of substrate (such as products of perivenous hepatocyte metabolism being recycled to periportal hepatocytes) that would occur in isolated hepatocytes or in a recirculating perfusion. The use of [2-15N]glutamine and of [5-15N]glutamine allows us to compare the metabolic fate of these two nitrogen atoms. The amide nitrogen of glutamine was primarily incorporated into urea via carbamyl phosphate, whereas the amino nitrogen was primarily incorporated via aspartate, as is evident from the relative enrichments of aspartate and of citrulline generated from each substrate.Glucagon stimulated flux through the PDG pathway (p < 0.05), as has been previously reported (3Nissim I. Yudkoff M. Brosnan J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31234-31242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 12Brosnan J.T. Ewart H.S. Squires S.A. Adv.

The activation of glutaminase is confirmed by the decrease in liver glutamine and the increase in glutamate. The fact that glutaminase is irreversible permits reliable estimates of glutaminase flux based on conversion of [5-15N]glutamine to labeled products. However, the enzymes subsequent to glutaminase, glutamate dehydrogenase, and the aminotransferases are reversible so that the incorporation of15N into ammonia and amino acids by these enzymes will reflect isotopic exchange as well as net flux. Our results supply clear evidence for the reversibility of these enzymes. For example, the labeling of glutamate, alanine, and aspartate in the experiments that utilized [5-15N]glutamine depends on the incorporation of ammonia into glutamate via glutamate dehydrogenase acting in the direction of reductive animation. The labeling of ammonia and of citrulline in the experiments that utilize [2-15N]glutamine rely on the deamination of glutamate via glutamate dehydrogenase.These differences of product enrichment in perfusions with the differently labeled glutamines are germane to the question of glutamate dehydrogenase equilibration. It is well established that the equilibrium of the GDH enzyme activity lies far to the glutamate side (28McGivan J.D. Chappell J.B. FEBS Lett. 1975; 52: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), but this holds true only for the purified enzyme in which the concentration of ammonia is in the high millimolar range, well beyond any expected in vivo concentration (28McGivan J.D. Chappell J.B. FEBS Lett. 1975; 52: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 29Charles A.S. Lieu B.S. Hsu B.Y.L. Alberto B.B. Greenberg C.R. Hopwood N.J. Perlman K. Rich B.H. Zammarchi E. Poncz M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 1352-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Indeed, recent investigation with the hyperammonemia, hyperinsulinemia syndrome, which is caused by a mutant GDH that is no longer subject to tight inhibition by GTP, suggests that the enzyme can function primarily for the purpose of glutamate oxidation, at least in liver and pancreas (29Charles A.S. Lieu B.S. Hsu B.Y.L. Alberto B.B. Greenberg C.R. Hopwood N.J. Perlman K. Rich B.H. Zammarchi E. Poncz M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 1352-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). The current data indicate that the glutamate dehydrogenase is reversible; the incorporation of 15N from [5-15N]glutamine into glutamate and from [2-15N]glutamine into ammonia occurs via the amination and deamination reactions, respectively, of glutamate dehydrogenase. However, the flux through the glutamate dehydrogenase is not so great, in comparison with the flux of other relevant pathways (1Nissim I. Cattano C. Nissim I. Yudkoff M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 393-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 2Nissim I. Cattano C. Zhiping L. Nissim I. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1993; 3: 1416-1427PubMed Google Scholar, 3Nissim I. Yudkoff M. Brosnan J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31234-31242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), that full 15N equilibration occurs. Glutaminase produces equal quantities of glutamate and ammonia. If the equilibrating effect of glutamate dehydrogenase were absolute, then glutamate and ammonia would become equally labeled within mitochondria regardless of whether [2-15N]glutamine or [5-15N]glutamine were substrates, and there would be no difference between these substrates in the labeling of other metabolites such as alanine, aspartate, or citrulline. There are, however, substantial differences in the labeling of these other metabolites, which is most likely explained by “metabolic competition,” i.e. that aspartate and alanine aminotransferases compete effectively with glutamate dehydrogenase for [15N]glutamate that arises from [2-15N]glutamine metabolism and carbamyl-phosphate synthetase competes effectively with glutamate dehydrogenase for15NH3 that arises from [5-15N]glutamine metabolism. Therefore, it is not necessary to invoke metabolic channeling, merely metabolic competition, to account for the different labeling patterns that are found when these two positional isotopomers of 15N glutamine are employed as substrates.The glutamate dehydrogenase reaction may have also a key role in the regulation of glutamine synthesis. It is possible that a significant portion of the endogenous glutamine production is mediated via de novo synthesis, in which a net flux of carbons into glutamine occurs. In this case α-ketoglutarate formed in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (from pyruvate and lactate added to the perfusate) would be converted to glutamate via the glutamate dehydrogenase reaction and then to glutamine. Our previous investigation with isolated hepatocytes and [3-13C]pyruvate indicated that approximately 15% of glutamate carbons were derived from [3-13C]pyruvate (3Nissim I. Yudkoff M. Brosnan J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31234-31242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, further study with 13C-labeled precursor would be required to determine whether a similar portion of glutamate carbon is derived during liver perfusion.Fig. 3 shows that the 15N enrichment of glutamine in the cellular pool is always lower than in the effluent perfusate and that the enrichment of the cellular pool is much higher when [2-15N]glutamine is the substrate. That the enrichment in the cellular pool is lower than in the perfusate means that some of the intracellular glutamine arises from unlabeled sources, i.e.via proteolysis, glutamine recycling, or de novo glutamine synthesis (as indicated above). We previously reported that glutamine production via proteolysis amounted to 7 nmol/min/g (4Brosnan J.T. Brosnan M.E. Charron R. Nissim I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16199-16207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), that is, approximately 3% of the endogenous glutamine production calculated in the current study. Therefore, proteolysis seems unlikely to be the major source for endogenous glutamine production, and thus the dilution of 15N enrichment in the perfusate glutamine must occur following production of glutamine from other unlabeled sources. In the case of [5-15N]glutamine, unlabeled glutamate and15NH3 will be produced via the PDG pathway. In the mitochondria, this 15NH3 can be metabolized to form [15N]glutamate via the GDH pathway. If15N-labeled ammonia and glutamate are used for glutamine synthesis, then glutamine would be labeled at 2-N and 5-N (4Brosnan J.T. Brosnan M.E. Charron R. Nissim I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16199-16207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, in the current study no doubly labeled glutamine was detected regardless of the experimental conditions, indicating that glutamine was formed from either unlabeled ammonia, unlabeled glutamate, or both. It is possible that the unlabeled mitochondrial glutamate (formed via the PDG pathway) is transported to the cytosol and then recycled to glutamine in the perivenous hepatocytes. Therefore, during perfusion with [5-15N]glutamine, mainly unlabeled glutamine is produced and simultaneously dilutes the [5-15N]glutamine enrichment in the liver (Fig. 3). However, in the case of perfusions with [2-15N]glutamine, [15N]glutamate (between 30–50 APE, depending upon the experimental condition) is formed so that the glutamine produced would be labeled, and thereby, the dilution of the intrahepatic [2-15N]glutamine would be less significant than in the case of perfusions with [5-15N]glutamine. Haüssinger et al. (24Haüssinger D. Gerok W. Sies H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 755: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) have shown that an intrahepatic glutamine cycle exists whereby there is simultaneous catabolism and synthesis of glutamine (in periportal and perivenous hepatocytes, respectively. Haüssinger (23Haüssinger D. Biochem. J. 1990; 267: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) has also shown an effective uptake mechanism for glutamate in the perivenous hepatocytes. We therefore envisage that some glutamate produced in periportal hepatocytes by glutaminase is taken up by the perivenous hepatocytes and converted to glutamine. In this case, the endogenous production of glutamine is mediated primarily via recycling of perfusate glutamine as indicated by Haüssinger et al.(23Haüssinger D. Biochem. J. 1990; 267: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 24Haüssinger D. Gerok W. Sies H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 755: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).The data in Fig. 7 are of considerable interest in the light of the suggestion that a metabolic channel exists between PDG and CPS-I such that ammonia that arises from 5-15N of glutamine enjoys preferential access to carbamyl-phosphate synthetase (9Meijer A.J. FEBS Lett. 1985; 191: 249-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Both [5-15N]glutamine and [2-15N]glutamine give rise to ammonia in the same compartment (the mitochondria of glutaminase-containing hepatocytes) but as a result of the action of two different enzymes. 15NH3 will be produced from [5-15N]glutamine by the PDG pathway. It will also be produced from [2-15N]glutamine by the GDH pathway, which acts on [15N]glutamate that arises via PDG. By comparing the metabolic fate of 15NH3 that is produced in the same compartment by these two different enzymes, we can determine whether ammonia that arises via the PDG pathway has preferential access to carbamyl-phosphate synthetase. Ammonia that arises in the mitochondria can have three immediate metabolic fates: (i) to be incorporated into carbamyl phosphate by CPS-I, (ii) to be incorporated into glutamate by glutamate dehydrogenase, and (iii) to leave the mitochondria. 15NH3 that is incorporated into carbamyl phosphate will be reflected in perfusate [15N]citrulline, whereas 15NH3that leaves the mitochondria will be reflected in perfusate NH3 (4Brosnan J.T. Brosnan M.E. Charron R. Nissim I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16199-16207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Fig. 7 shows the correlation between perfusate15NH3 and perfusate [15N]citrulline at all of the time points in all of the perfusions. An excellent correlation was found between the isotopic enrichment of perfusate ammonia and citrulline, and it is clear that the data from the perfusions with [2-15N]glutamine and [5-15N]glutamine fall on the same line. Thus,15NH3 molecules that arise within the mitochondria by the agency either of glutaminase or of glutamate dehydrogenase enjoy the same partition between incorporation into carbamyl phosphate by means of CPS-I or leaving the mitochondria. Thus, in these experiments, there is no evidence for preferential access for ammonia that arises by the action of glutaminase to carbamyl-phosphate synthetase. To the contrary, we provide strong evidence that such ammonia is metabolized without any such metabolic channel. Raijman and co-workers (31Cheung C.W. Cohen N.S. Raijman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4038-4044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown a channeling of urea cycle intermediates at each of the three cytoplasmic enzymes of the urea cycle. However, there are fundamental differences between the current investigation and that of Raijman and co-workers (31Cheung C.W. Cohen N.S. Raijman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4038-4044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). First, the current observation deals with the first mitochondrial reaction in the urea cycle (the channeling of ammonia derived via the PDG to CPS-I), whereas the observations of Raijman and co-workers deals with the cytoplasmic enzymes of the urea cycle. Second, in the current study we used 15N-labeled glutamine and liver perfusion system, whereas Raijman and co-workers (31Cheung C.W. Cohen N.S. Raijman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4038-4044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) used [14C]HCO3− and isolated hepatocytes.The production of the urea isotopomers requires comment. The time course for the three isotopomers (Fig. 8) shows that the pattern of their production varied throughout the perfusions, and even in the control perfusions, a steady state did not appear to be achieved until about 60–70 min. This is attributable to a slow increase in PDG activity that occurred during the perfusions (Fig. 2 A), except in the case of the glucagon-infused livers, where there was a large activation of glutaminase. But, even there, the activation is progressive, and a steady state is not achieved until about 60 min. Thus the progressive decrease in the proportion ofU m and increase in the proportion ofU m+1 and U m+2 throughout the perfusions are attributable to the increased provision of15N-labeled urea precursors with time. The comparison with experimental and predicted isotopomer production (Table I) showed very good agreement for the proportion of U m andU m+1. However, there was quite a difference between the predicted and experimental values ofU m+2, with the experimental value invariably being greater. We do not know precisely why this is so, but we can make one suggestion. A possible explanation is that the enzymes of the urea cycle and, presumably, ureagenesis occur throughout the liver acinus, except for the last few perivenous cells, which contain glutamine synthetase (24Haüssinger D. Gerok W. Sies H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 755: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, the glutaminase location does not exactly parallel that of the urea cycle in that it is expressed only in the early portion of the peri-portal region (24Haüssinger D. Gerok W. Sies H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 755: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In the experiments reported in this paper, urea synthesis will occur in the early part of the acinus from perfusate NH4Cl and 15N-labeled glutamine and in the later part of the acinus largely from NH4Cl. The urea isotopomers measured in the perfusate will be the sum of those produced in early"

CFTR channels become deactivated within ∼10 s after membrane patches are excised from cAMP-stimulated Chinese hamster ovary cells into bath solution containing ATP at 37 °C (2Tabcharani J.A. Chang X.-B. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Nature. 1991; 352: 628-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Similar results are obtained using Chinese hamster ovary and airway epithelial cell lines at 20 °C except the deactivation requires ∼100 s (3Becq F. Jensen T.J. Chang X.-B. Savoia A. Rommens J.M.

Channel rundown is caused by dephosphorylation of PKA sites, because it does not occur if the PKA catalytic subunit is present in the bath solution, and deactivated channels can be restimulated by exposure to PKA (2Tabcharani J.A. Chang X.-B. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Nature. 1991; 352: 628-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 4Berger H.A. Anderson M.P. Gregory R.J. Thompson S. Howard P.W. Maurer R.A. Mulligan R.

These results indicate that at least one of the phosphatases regulating CFTR is membrane-delimited.The phosphatases that control CFTR have not yet been identified definitively at the molecular level. CFTR is regulated by PKA phosphorylation on multiple serine residues (5Cheng S.H. Rich D.P. Marshall J. Gregory R.J. Welsh M.J. Smith A.E. Cell. 1991; 66: 1027-1036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 6Picciotto M.R. Cohn J.A. Bertuzzi G. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. J. Biol.

Serine/threonine protein phosphatases are classified according to their functional properties: Type 1 phosphatases (PP1) dephosphorylate the β subunit of phosphorylase kinase and are inhibited by thermostable protein inhibitors 1 and 2. Type 2 phosphatases (PP2) dephosphorylate the α subunit of phosphorylase kinase and are insensitive to protein inhibitors 1 and 2 (8Shenolikar S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 55-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Among the type 2 protein phosphatases, PP2A is distinguished by its sensitivity to okadaic acid and calyculin A, PP2B by its requirement for Ca2+ and calmodulin and sensitivity to inhibitors such as deltamethrin, and PP2C by its requirement for relatively high (mM) levels of Mg2+.Several phosphatases dephosphorylate full-length CFTR or recombinant R domain protein in vitro (3Becq F. Jensen T.J. Chang X.-B. Savoia A. Rommens J.M. Tsui L.-C. Buchwald M. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The specificity of protein phosphatases depends more on proximity than on the sequence of the target phosphoprotein, hence the importance of determining if CFTR is normally associated with a particular phosphatase.Functional studies implicate PP2C as a CFTR phosphatase in Chinese hamster ovary, baby hamster kidney (BHK), and airway epithelial cells. CFTR rundown is relatively insensitive to okadaic acid and does not require Ca2+ or calmodulin (2Tabcharani J.A. Chang X.-B. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Nature. 1991; 352: 628-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) but is inhibited by low Mg2+ (11Luo J. Pato M.D. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1397-C1410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PP2C is the most potent deactivator of CFTR channels among the exogenous phosphatases tested, and like the endogenous (i.e. membrane-associated) CFTR phosphatase in these cell types, exogenous PP2C inhibits the channel by decreasing the rate at which it enters open bursts. None of the purified phosphatases deactivate CFTR channels completely (11Luo J. Pato M.D. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1397-C1410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with the notion that CFTR is regulated by multiple phosphatases (12Hwang T.-C. Horie M. Gadsby D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 101: 629-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Indeed, 5–10% of the activity remains even when patches are exposed to both PP2C and PP2A simultaneously, suggesting they may not be the only players (11Luo J. Pato M.D. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1397-C1410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Rapid deactivation of CFTR channels in excised patches has led to speculation that CFTR and its phosphatase(s) may be physically associated within a regulatory complex (2Tabcharani J.A. Chang X.-B. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Nature. 1991; 352: 628-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 3Becq F. Jensen T.J. Chang X.-B. Savoia A. Rommens J.M. Tsui L.-C. Buchwald M.

Acta. 1996; 1286: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this study we test this possibility in unstimulated BHK cells using co-immunoprecipitations and chemical cross-linking. The results indicate that CFTR is closely associated with PP2C but not PP1, PP2A, or PP2B.DISCUSSIONThe present results demonstrate that PP2C is present in the membrane fraction of BHK cells and is closely associated with CFTR. We confirmed that phosphorylated CFTR is a good substrate for PP2C and found that the susceptibility of bacterially expressed GST-R domain fusion protein to different phosphatases is similar to that of full-length CFTR.Rapid rundown of CFTR channel activity in excised membrane patches results from dephosphorylation of PKA sites; it can be reversed by exposure to the PKA catalytic subunit and does not occur if patches are excised into bath solution containing PKA (2Tabcharani J.A. Chang X.-B. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Nature. 1991; 352: 628-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The association of CFTR with PP2C observed in the present work may be a widespread phenomenon because rundown with similar characteristics has been observed in many other cell types, including those from tissues affected in cystic fibrosis (e.g. pancreatic ducts (23Gray M.A. Greenwell J.R. Argent B.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1988; 105: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), human colon (17Tabcharani J.A. Low W. Elie D. Hanrahan J.W.

Deactivation of CFTR in excised patches is relatively insensitive to okadaic acid and calyculin A, independent of Ca2+ and calmodulin, and inhibited by lowering free magnesium concentration (2Tabcharani J.A. Chang X.-B. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Nature. 1991; 352: 628-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 3Becq F. Jensen T.J. Chang X.-B. Savoia A. Rommens J.M. Tsui L.-C. Buchwald M.

Physiol. 1998; 274: C1397-C1410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transepithelial studies are consistent with a predominant role of PP2C, because deactivation of the short-circuit current after removing forskolin or 8-(4-chlorophenylthio) adenosine 3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate is unaffected by the PP1 and PP2A inhibitors okadaic acid (10Travis S.M. Berger H.A. Welsh M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11055-11060Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) or calyculin A (11Luo J. Pato M.D. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1397-C1410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although co-expression of PP2Cα with CFTR in Fisher rat thyroid cells has little effect on the rate of chloride current deactivation after cAMP washout, it inhibits the cAMP-stimulated current by ∼70% (10Travis S.M. Berger H.A. Welsh M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11055-11060Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The isoform of PP2C that regulates CFTR remains to be established. The antibody used in this study would be expected to recognize α and known splice variants of the β isoform because of their homology but not the more distantly related γ isoform (25Travis S.M. Welsh M.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).PP2A regulates CFTR in some cell types, particularly cardiac and sweat ducts (12Hwang T.-C. Horie M. Gadsby D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 101: 629-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 26Reddy M.M. Quinton P.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C474-C480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we confirmed that PP2C and PP2A are both more effective in dephosphorylating full-length CFTR and recombinant R domain peptide compared with equimolar PP1 or PP2B. However PP2C was more abundant in the membrane fraction from BHK cells, and no association between CFTR and PP2A was detected by immunoprecipitation or chemical cross-linking. By contrast, a specific monoclonal antibody against CFTR (M3A7 (27Kartner N. Riordan J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 629-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar)) co-precipitated PP2C but did not bring down PP1 or PP2A. Polyclonal anti-PP2C antibody co-precipitated CFTR, whereas antibodies against PP1, PP2A, and PP2B did not. The association between PP2C and CFTR must be relatively strong, because immunoprecipitations were carried out in the presence of detergent (1% Triton X-100).After exposure of cell lysates to the cross-linker DTSSP and purification by nickel chelate chromatography, CFTRHis10appeared in high molecular mass complexes that also contained PP2C but not PP1, PP2A, or PP2B. Control experiments with untransfected BHK cells or cells expressing CFTR without a polyhistidine tail (data not shown) confirmed that PP2C binding to Ni2+-NTA-agarose requires CFTRHis10. The association between CFTR and PP2C does not require strong phosphorylation of CFTR, because all experiments were carried out using cells that had not been stimulated with cAMP.A stable complex that includes CFTR and PP2C would presumably increase the efficiency of CFTR dephosphorylation. Such targeting of PP2C to particular substrates has not been reported previously, although other protein phosphatases form stable complexes with their substrates. For example, PP2B is associated with a neuronal potassium channel (28Reinhart P.H. Levitan I.B. J. Neurosci. 1995; 1: 4572-4579Crossref Google Scholar) and PP2A is targeted to the microtubule-associated protein tau 32 (29Sontag E. Nunbhakdi-Craig V. Lee G. Bloom G.S. Mumby M.C. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1201-1207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar).The monoclonal anti-CFTR antibody M3A7 used to co-precipitate PP2C in this study has been extensively characterized (27Kartner N. Riordan J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 629-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and did not recognize proteins in control (untransfected) BHK lysates. The polyclonal antibody raised against PP2C was relatively specific but did recognize an unidentified 30-kDa protein, which may be another PP2C isoform.Adding a polyhistidine tag to CFTR did not grossly alter its structure because CFTRHis10 had normal Cl− channel activity when incorporated into planar bilayers. 2D. Dahan, unpublished observation. Also, specific association of PP2C was observed with both wild-type and histidine-tagged CFTR. Any alterations in structure would seem more likely to disrupt than create specific interactions between the proteins, although that possibility cannot be formally excluded. CFTR and PP2C-like phosphatase activities were both present in the membrane fraction, and the Mg2+ dependence of channel rundown in excised patches provides further independent evidence that PP2C and CFTR are normally co-localized at the plasma membrane (11Luo J. Pato M.D. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1397-C1410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus the selective co-precipitation and cross-linking were not artifacts of lysing the cells but likely reflect their co-localization under physiological conditions.Close association of CFTR with PP2C could help explain the robust down-regulation of its channel activity in vivo when PKA stimulation is removed. The phosphatase-regulating CFTR has been suggested as a target for pharmacotherapies aimed at increasing (i.e. restoring) CFTR activity in cystic fibrosis, therefore these observations may have relevance to the development of therapies for cystic fibrosis (3Becq F. Jensen T.J. Chang X.-B. Savoia A. Rommens J.M. Tsui L.-C. Buchwald M. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hanrahan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16171-16179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A phosphatase inhibitor might be useful for stimulating mutant channels that reach the plasma membrane when used alone or as an adjunct therapy to increase the efficacy of other treatments such as drugs that improve CFTR processing or gene therapies. Regardless, ion channel rundown is a common phenomenon in patches excised from neuronal, cardiac, and other cell types. It will be interesting to learn if PP2C also forms regulatory complexes with other ion channels besides CFTR and mediates their deactivation. CFTR1 is a tightly regulated chloride channel expressed in epithelial and other cell types (1Gadsby D.C. Nairn A.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79 (suppl.): 77-107Crossref Scopus (369) Google Scholar). CFTR channels become deactivated within ∼10 s after membrane patches are excised from cAMP-stimulated Chinese hamster ovary cells into bath solution containing ATP at 37 °C (2Tabcharani J.A. Chang X.-B. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Nature. 1991; 352: 628-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Similar results are obtained using Chinese hamster ovary and airway epithelial cell lines at 20 °C except the deactivation requires ∼100 s (3Becq F. Jensen T.J. Chang X.-B. Savoia A. Rommens J.M. Tsui L.-C. Buchwald M. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9160-9164Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Channel rundown is caused by dephosphorylation of PKA sites, because it does not occur if the PKA catalytic subunit is present in the bath solution, and deactivated channels can be restimulated by exposure to PKA (2Tabcharani J.A. Chang X.-B. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Nature. 1991; 352: 628-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 4Berger H.A. Anderson M.P. Gregory R.J. Thompson S. Howard P.W. Maurer R.A. Mulligan R. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1422-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). These results indicate that at least one of the phosphatases regulating CFTR is membrane-delimited. The phosphatases that control CFTR have not yet been identified definitively at the molecular level. CFTR is regulated by PKA phosphorylation on multiple serine residues (5Cheng S.H. Rich D.P. Marshall J. Gregory R.J. Welsh M.J. Smith A.E. Cell. 1991; 66: 1027-1036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 6Picciotto M.R. Cohn J.A. Bertuzzi G. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 11304-11311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Serine/threonine protein phosphatases are classified according to their functional properties: Type 1 phosphatases (PP1) dephosphorylate the β subunit of phosphorylase kinase and are inhibited by thermostable protein inhibitors 1 and 2. Type 2 phosphatases (PP2) dephosphorylate the α subunit of phosphorylase kinase and are insensitive to protein inhibitors 1 and 2 (8Shenolikar S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 55-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Among the type 2 protein phosphatases, PP2A is distinguished by its sensitivity to okadaic acid and calyculin A, PP2B by its requirement for Ca2+ and calmodulin and sensitivity to inhibitors such as deltamethrin, and PP2C by its requirement for relatively high (mM) levels of Mg2+. Several phosphatases dephosphorylate full-length CFTR or recombinant R domain protein in vitro (3Becq F. Jensen T.J. Chang X.-B. Savoia A. Rommens J.M. Tsui L.-C. Buchwald M. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9160-9164Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 9Berger H.A. Travis S.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol.

A. 1997; 94: 11055-11060Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), but this does not establish their physiological role because all are usually present in intact cells. The specificity of protein phosphatases depends more on proximity than on the sequence of the target phosphoprotein, hence the importance of determining if CFTR is normally associated with a particular phosphatase. Functional studies implicate PP2C as a CFTR phosphatase in Chinese hamster ovary, baby hamster kidney (BHK), and airway epithelial cells. CFTR rundown is relatively insensitive to okadaic acid and does not require Ca2+ or calmodulin (2Tabcharani J.A. Chang X.-B. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Nature. 1991; 352: 628-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) but is inhibited by low Mg2+ (11Luo J. Pato M.D. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1397-C1410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PP2C is the most potent deactivator of CFTR channels among the exogenous phosphatases tested, and like the endogenous (i.e. membrane-associated) CFTR phosphatase in these cell types, exogenous PP2C inhibits the channel by decreasing the rate at which it enters open bursts. None of the purified phosphatases deactivate CFTR channels completely (11Luo J. Pato M.D. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1397-C1410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with the notion that CFTR is regulated by multiple phosphatases (12Hwang T.-C. Horie M. Gadsby D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 101: 629-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Indeed, 5–10% of the activity remains even when patches are exposed to both PP2C and PP2A simultaneously, suggesting they may not be the only players (11Luo J. Pato M.D. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1397-C1410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rapid deactivation of CFTR channels in excised patches has led to speculation that CFTR and its phosphatase(s) may be physically associated within a regulatory complex (2Tabcharani J.A. Chang X.-B. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Nature. 1991; 352: 628-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 3Becq F. Jensen T.J. Chang X.-B. Savoia A. Rommens J.M. Tsui L.-C. Buchwald M. Riordan J.R.

Acta. 1996; 1286: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this study we test this possibility in unstimulated BHK cells using co-immunoprecipitations and chemical cross-linking. The results indicate that CFTR is closely associated with PP2C but not PP1, PP2A, or PP2B. DISCUSSIONThe present results demonstrate that PP2C is present in the membrane fraction of BHK cells and is closely associated with CFTR. We confirmed that phosphorylated CFTR is a good substrate for PP2C and found that the susceptibility of bacterially expressed GST-R domain fusion protein to different phosphatases is similar to that of full-length CFTR.Rapid rundown of CFTR channel activity in excised membrane patches results from dephosphorylation of PKA sites; it can be reversed by exposure to the PKA catalytic subunit and does not occur if patches are excised into bath solution containing PKA (2Tabcharani J.A. Chang X.-B. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Nature. 1991; 352: 628-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The association of CFTR with PP2C observed in the present work may be a widespread phenomenon because rundown with similar characteristics has been observed in many other cell types, including those from tissues affected in cystic fibrosis (e.g. pancreatic ducts (23Gray M.A. Greenwell J.R. Argent B.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1988; 105: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), human colon (17Tabcharani J.A. Low W. Elie D. Hanrahan J.W. FEBS Lett. 1990; 270: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and human airway cells (3Becq F. Jensen T.J. Chang X.-B. Savoia A. Rommens J.M. Tsui L.-C. Buchwald M. Riordan J.R.

Physiol. 1994; 266: L502-L512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Functional studies of excised patches indicate a major role for membrane-delimited PP2C but do not exclude regulation by PP2A and other phosphatases in situ. Deactivation of CFTR in excised patches is relatively insensitive to okadaic acid and calyculin A, independent of Ca2+ and calmodulin, and inhibited by lowering free magnesium concentration (2Tabcharani J.A. Chang X.-B. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Nature. 1991; 352: 628-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 3Becq F. Jensen T.J. Chang X.-B. Savoia A. Rommens J.M. Tsui L.-C. Buchwald M.

Physiol. 1998; 274: C1397-C1410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transepithelial studies are consistent with a predominant role of PP2C, because deactivation of the short-circuit current after removing forskolin or 8-(4-chlorophenylthio) adenosine 3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate is unaffected by the PP1 and PP2A inhibitors okadaic acid (10Travis S.M. Berger H.A. Welsh M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11055-11060Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) or calyculin A (11Luo J. Pato M.D. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1397-C1410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although co-expression of PP2Cα with CFTR in Fisher rat thyroid cells has little effect on the rate of chloride current deactivation after cAMP washout, it inhibits the cAMP-stimulated current by ∼70% (10Travis S.M. Berger H.A. Welsh M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11055-11060Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The isoform of PP2C that regulates CFTR remains to be established. The antibody used in this study would be expected to recognize α and known splice variants of the β isoform because of their homology but not the more distantly related γ isoform (25Travis S.M. Welsh M.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).PP2A regulates CFTR in some cell types, particularly cardiac and sweat ducts (12Hwang T.-C. Horie M. Gadsby D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 101: 629-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 26Reddy M.M. Quinton P.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C474-C480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we confirmed that PP2C and PP2A are both more effective in dephosphorylating full-length CFTR and recombinant R domain peptide compared with equimolar PP1 or PP2B. However PP2C was more abundant in the membrane fraction from BHK cells, and no association between CFTR and PP2A was detected by immunoprecipitation or chemical cross-linking. By contrast, a specific monoclonal antibody against CFTR (M3A7 (27Kartner N. Riordan J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 629-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar)) co-precipitated PP2C but did not bring down PP1 or PP2A. Polyclonal anti-PP2C antibody co-precipitated CFTR, whereas antibodies against PP1, PP2A, and PP2B did not. The association between PP2C and CFTR must be relatively strong, because immunoprecipitations were carried out in the presence of detergent (1% Triton X-100).After exposure of cell lysates to the cross-linker DTSSP and purification by nickel chelate chromatography, CFTRHis10appeared in high molecular mass complexes that also contained PP2C but not PP1, PP2A, or PP2B. Control experiments with untransfected BHK cells or cells expressing CFTR without a polyhistidine tail (data not shown) confirmed that PP2C binding to Ni2+-NTA-agarose requires CFTRHis10. The association between CFTR and PP2C does not require strong phosphorylation of CFTR, because all experiments were carried out using cells that had not been stimulated with cAMP.A stable complex that includes CFTR and PP2C would presumably increase the efficiency of CFTR dephosphorylation. Such targeting of PP2C to particular substrates has not been reported previously, although other protein phosphatases form stable complexes with their substrates. For example, PP2B is associated with a neuronal potassium channel (28Reinhart P.H. Levitan I.B. J. Neurosci. 1995; 1: 4572-4579Crossref Google Scholar) and PP2A is targeted to the microtubule-associated protein tau 32 (29Sontag E. Nunbhakdi-Craig V. Lee G. Bloom G.S. Mumby M.C.

A phosphatase inhibitor might be useful for stimulating mutant channels that reach the plasma membrane when used alone or as an adjunct therapy to increase the efficacy of other treatments such as drugs that improve CFTR processing or gene therapies. Regardless, ion channel rundown is a common phenomenon in patches excised from neuronal, cardiac, and other cell types. It will be interesting to learn if PP2C also forms regulatory complexes with other ion channels besides CFTR and mediates their deactivation."

Although multiple NHE isoforms (NHE1, NHE2, and NHE3) have been identified in salivary glands, little is known about their specific function(s) in resting and secreting acinar cells. Mice with targeted disruptions of the Nhe1, Nhe2, and Nhe3 genes were used to investigate the contribution of these proteins to the stimulation-induced up-regulation of NHE activity in mouse parotid acinar cells. The lack of NHE1, but not NHE2 or NHE3, prevented intracellular pH recovery from an acid load in resting acinar cells, in acini stimulated to secrete with the muscarinic agonist carbachol, and in acini shrunken by hypertonic addition of sucrose. In HCO3−-containing solution, the rate of intracellular pH recovery from a muscarinic agonist-stimulated acid load was significantly inhibited in acinar cells from mice lacking NHE1, but not in cells from NHE2- or NHE3-deficient mice. These data demonstrate that NHE1 is the major regulator of intracellular pH in both resting and muscarinic agonist-stimulated acinar cells and suggest that up-regulation of NHE1 activity has an important role in modulating saliva production in vivo.

It is clear that this intracellular acid load is buffered by an increase in Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE)1 activity, which by alkalinizing the cytosol, promotes both the secretion of HCO3− via the apical anion channel and the uptake of Cl− mediated by the basolateral Cl−/HCO3− exchanger (1Melvin J.E.

Thus, up-regulation of Na+/H+ exchanger activity plays a key role in the secretory process by enhancing HCO3−and transepithelial Cl− movement.The Na+/H+ exchanger gene family currently comprises six known isoforms.

NHE1 is ubiquitously expressed, and its main functions appear to be maintenance of intracellular pH and cell volume recovery (see Refs. 11Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. Pouysségur J. Physiol.

In contrast, NHE3 is primarily expressed in kidney and gastrointestinal epithelia, where it mediates NaCl reabsorption (18Brant S.R. Yun C.H. Donowitz M. Tse C.-M. Am. J.

Aronson P. Lorenz J.N. Shull G.E. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 282-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). NHE2 has a similar distribution to NHE3; however, disruption of this gene does not appear to affect NaCl reabsorption. Rather, it appears to be involved in regulating the long-term survivability of gastric parietal cells (20Schultheis P.J. Clarke L.L. Meneton P. Harline M. Boivin G.P. Stemmermann G. Duffy J.J.

NHE4 is found in stomach and kidney, where it may be involved in cell volume regulation (21Bookstein C. DePaoli A.M. Xie Y. Niu P. Musch M.W. Rao M.C. Chang E.B. J. Clin.

Physiol. 1999; 276: G470-G478PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to these uncertainties concerning isoform localization, very little is known about the specific functions of the individual NHE isoforms in acinar cells during resting conditions or when stimulated to secrete fluid. Available evidence suggests that the most highly expressed Na+/H+ exchanger in acinar cells is probably the NHE1 isoform (23Robertson M.A. Woodside M. Foskett J.K. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 287-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 24Lee M.G. Schultheis P.J. Yan M. Shull G.E. Bookstein C. Chang E. Tse M. Donowitz M. Park K. Muallem S. J.

Physiol. 1999; 276: G470-G478PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms involved in the up-regulation of Na+/H+ exchanger activity in salivary acinar cells are inconsistent with the known properties of expressed NHE1. Up-regulation in acinar cells is insensitive to protein kinase A activation and is maintained by the agonist-induced increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, independently of protein kinase C and calmodulin (26Manganel M.

To confirm the molecular identity of the Na+/H+exchanger activity in salivary gland acinar cells, we studied the functional consequences of disrupting the murine Nhe1,Nhe2, and Nhe3 genes on intracellular pH regulation in this cell type. Our results demonstrate that activation of the Na+/H+ exchanger isoform NHE1 is responsible for the up-regulation observed during muscarinic stimulation and thus is the major regulator of intracellular pH in both resting and secreting cells. Some aspects of this work have been previously reported in preliminary form (34Evans R.L. Watson G.E. Park K. Scott W.J. Bell S.M. Schultheis P.J. Shull G.E. Melvin J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9 (abstr.): 212aGoogle Scholar).DISCUSSIONMuscarinic stimulation produces copious amounts of parotid saliva, equivalent to ∼5% of the whole body water content/h in mice (41Marmary Y. Fox P.C. Baum B.J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1987; 88: 307-310Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This vigorous rate of secretion is associated with a dramatic up-regulation of Na+/H+ exchanger activity, which alkalinizes the cytoplasm of salivary gland acinar cells (1Melvin J.E. Moran A. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19564-19569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Lau K.R. Elliot A.C. Brown P.D. Am. J.

Physiol. 1989; 93: 285-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The NHE-induced intracellular alkalinization contributes to fluid secretion by promoting both Cl−/HCO3− exchanger-mediated Cl− uptake and HCO3−secretion via the apical anion channel (1Melvin J.E. Moran A. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19564-19569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Melvin J.E. Turner R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: G393-G398PubMed Google Scholar). Despite appreciation of the physiological significance of this important transport mechanism, the molecular identity of the NHE isoform(s) involved in regulating acinar cell intracellular pH was unknown. Thus, the major objective of this study was to directly test the functional significance of individual NHE proteins by studying the effects of gene disruption on intracellular pH regulation and muscarinic-induced up-regulation of Na+/H+ exchanger activity in mouse parotid acinar cells.Unstimulated acini from Nhe1 −/− null mutant animals were incapable of intracellular pH recovery after acid loading. Thus, in the absence of NHE1, other Na+/H+exchangers present in acinar cells fail to mediate a significant intracellular pH recovery toward original resting values. Consistent with this observation, acinar cells from Nhe2 andNhe3 null mutant mice recovered like acini fromNhe1 wild-type mice (Fig. 2). The dominance of NHE1 in regulating overall intracellular pH in unstimulated mouse parotid acini is consistent with its well documented “housekeeping” function (11Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. Pouysségur J. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 51-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar,16Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1995; 269: G1-G11Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the intracellular pH recovery rate observed in acini from Nhe1 heterozygous mice was comparable to that seen in Nhe1 wild-type mice, suggesting that the aberrant transcripts generated by disruption of the Nhe1 gene (35Bell S.M. Schreiner C.M. Schultheis P.J. Miller M.L. Evans R.L. Vorhees C. Shull G.E. Scott W.J. Am. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 29209-29216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), the current results demonstrate that both muscarinic stimulation and cell shrinkage increased the rate and magnitude of intracellular pH recovery in mouse parotid acinar cells, suggesting increased affinity for intracellular H+,i.e. an “alkaline shift.” Thus, this study directly establishes that NHE1 is the major Na+/H+exchanger isoform up-regulated in acinar cells by muscarinic agonists and by cell shrinkage (Figs. 4 and 5). Nevertheless, because NHE2 is localized to the apical membrane in rat submandibular acinar cells (22He X. Tse C.-M. Donowitz M. Alper S.L. Gabriel S.E. Baum B.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1997; 433: 260-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), NHE2 may play an important role in modulating the activity of the pH-sensitive apical anion channel, with activity decreasing as the intracellular pH drops (15Arreola J. Melvin J.E. Begenisich T. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 147: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).It is still unclear exactly how muscarinic stimulation up-regulates the exchanger activity of NHE1 in salivary gland acinar cells. Available evidence suggests that a combination of elevated [Ca2+]i, cell shrinkage, and/or Cl−loss plays a central role and that this increased activity is independent of protein kinase C, calmodulin, and phosphorylation of NHE1 (8Robertson M.A. Foskett J.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C146-C156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Robertson M.A. Woodside M. Foskett J.K. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol.

A null background affords, by expression of a mutated form of the Nhe1 gene, a unique opportunity to perform in vivo structure/function analysis to determine the exact mechanism for activation.In summary, this study provides the first directdocumentation that up-regulation of NHE1 is responsible for the enhanced Na+/H+ exchanger activity observed in salivary gland acinar cells during muscarinic stimulation. By maintaining the intracellular pH at a higher value (and hence a higher intracellular [HCO3−]), NHE1 promotes fluid secretion by enhancing the accumulation of intracellular Cl− via the basolateral Cl−/HCO3− exchanger (42Melvin J.E. Turner R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: G393-G398PubMed Google Scholar), thereby providing a greater driving force for Cl− and HCO3− exit (1Melvin J.E. Moran A. Turner R.J. J. Biol.

Melvin J.E. Begenisich T. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 147: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The initial response of salivary gland acinar cells to a fluid secretion stimulus is an acidification of the cytosol resulting from the efflux of HCO3− into the lumen and the generation of acid equivalents via metabolic pathways linked to increased membrane transporter activity (1Melvin J.E. Moran A. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19564-19569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Lau K.R. Elliot A.C. Brown P.D. Am. J.

It is clear that this intracellular acid load is buffered by an increase in Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE)1 activity, which by alkalinizing the cytosol, promotes both the secretion of HCO3− via the apical anion channel and the uptake of Cl− mediated by the basolateral Cl−/HCO3− exchanger (1Melvin J.E.

Thus, up-regulation of Na+/H+ exchanger activity plays a key role in the secretory process by enhancing HCO3−and transepithelial Cl− movement. The Na+/H+ exchanger gene family currently comprises six known isoforms. NHE1–NHE4 have been described in epithelial cells (10Orlowski J. Kandasamy R.A. Shull G.E. J. Biol.

NHE1 is ubiquitously expressed, and its main functions appear to be maintenance of intracellular pH and cell volume recovery (see Refs. 11Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. Pouysségur J. Physiol.

In contrast, NHE3 is primarily expressed in kidney and gastrointestinal epithelia, where it mediates NaCl reabsorption (18Brant S.R. Yun C.H. Donowitz M. Tse C.-M. Am. J.

Aronson P. Lorenz J.N. Shull G.E. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 282-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). NHE2 has a similar distribution to NHE3; however, disruption of this gene does not appear to affect NaCl reabsorption. Rather, it appears to be involved in regulating the long-term survivability of gastric parietal cells (20Schultheis P.J. Clarke L.L. Meneton P. Harline M. Boivin G.P. Stemmermann G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Miller M.L. Shull G.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). NHE4 is found in stomach and kidney, where it may be involved in cell volume regulation (21Bookstein C. DePaoli A.M. Xie Y. Niu P. Musch M.W. Rao M.C. Chang E.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 106-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Recently, a combination of immunocytochemical, pharmacological, and molecular biological studies have shown that rat parotid and submandibular acini express NHE1 in their basolateral membrane (22He X.

Physiol. 1999; 276: G470-G478PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the subcellular distribution of NHE2 and NHE3 appears to be species- and gland-specific (22He X. Tse C.-M. Donowitz M. Alper S.L. Gabriel S.E. Baum B.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1997; 433: 260-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 24Lee M.G. Schultheis P.J. Yan M. Shull G.E. Bookstein C. Chang E. Tse M.

Physiol. 1999; 276: G470-G478PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to these uncertainties concerning isoform localization, very little is known about the specific functions of the individual NHE isoforms in acinar cells during resting conditions or when stimulated to secrete fluid. Available evidence suggests that the most highly expressed Na+/H+ exchanger in acinar cells is probably the NHE1 isoform (23Robertson M.A. Woodside M. Foskett J.K. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 287-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 24Lee M.G. Schultheis P.J. Yan M. Shull G.E. Bookstein C. Chang E. Tse M. Donowitz M. Park K. Muallem S. J.

Physiol. 1999; 276: G470-G478PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms involved in the up-regulation of Na+/H+ exchanger activity in salivary acinar cells are inconsistent with the known properties of expressed NHE1. Up-regulation in acinar cells is insensitive to protein kinase A activation and is maintained by the agonist-induced increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, independently of protein kinase C and calmodulin (26Manganel M.

To confirm the molecular identity of the Na+/H+exchanger activity in salivary gland acinar cells, we studied the functional consequences of disrupting the murine Nhe1,Nhe2, and Nhe3 genes on intracellular pH regulation in this cell type. Our results demonstrate that activation of the Na+/H+ exchanger isoform NHE1 is responsible for the up-regulation observed during muscarinic stimulation and thus is the major regulator of intracellular pH in both resting and secreting cells. Some aspects of this work have been previously reported in preliminary form (34Evans R.L. Watson G.E. Park K. Scott W.J. Bell S.M. Schultheis P.J. Shull G.E. Melvin J.E. Mol. Biol.

Fox P.C. Baum B.J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1987; 88: 307-310Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This vigorous rate of secretion is associated with a dramatic up-regulation of Na+/H+ exchanger activity, which alkalinizes the cytoplasm of salivary gland acinar cells (1Melvin J.E. Moran A.

Physiol. 1989; 93: 285-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The NHE-induced intracellular alkalinization contributes to fluid secretion by promoting both Cl−/HCO3− exchanger-mediated Cl− uptake and HCO3−secretion via the apical anion channel (1Melvin J.E. Moran A. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19564-19569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Melvin J.E. Turner R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: G393-G398PubMed Google Scholar). Despite appreciation of the physiological significance of this important transport mechanism, the molecular identity of the NHE isoform(s) involved in regulating acinar cell intracellular pH was unknown. Thus, the major objective of this study was to directly test the functional significance of individual NHE proteins by studying the effects of gene disruption on intracellular pH regulation and muscarinic-induced up-regulation of Na+/H+ exchanger activity in mouse parotid acinar cells.Unstimulated acini from Nhe1 −/− null mutant animals were incapable of intracellular pH recovery after acid loading. Thus, in the absence of NHE1, other Na+/H+exchangers present in acinar cells fail to mediate a significant intracellular pH recovery toward original resting values. Consistent with this observation, acinar cells from Nhe2 andNhe3 null mutant mice recovered like acini fromNhe1 wild-type mice (Fig. 2). The dominance of NHE1 in regulating overall intracellular pH in unstimulated mouse parotid acini is consistent with its well documented “housekeeping” function (11Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M.

Furthermore, the intracellular pH recovery rate observed in acini from Nhe1 heterozygous mice was comparable to that seen in Nhe1 wild-type mice, suggesting that the aberrant transcripts generated by disruption of the Nhe1 gene (35Bell S.M.

Nevertheless, because NHE2 is localized to the apical membrane in rat submandibular acinar cells (22He X. Tse C.-M. Donowitz M. Alper S.L. Gabriel S.E. Baum B.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1997; 433: 260-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), NHE2 may play an important role in modulating the activity of the pH-sensitive apical anion channel, with activity decreasing as the intracellular pH drops (15Arreola J. Melvin J.E. Begenisich T. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 147: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).It is still unclear exactly how muscarinic stimulation up-regulates the exchanger activity of NHE1 in salivary gland acinar cells. Available evidence suggests that a combination of elevated [Ca2+]i, cell shrinkage, and/or Cl−loss plays a central role and that this increased activity is independent of protein kinase C, calmodulin, and phosphorylation of NHE1 (8Robertson M.A. Foskett J.K.

A null background affords, by expression of a mutated form of the Nhe1 gene, a unique opportunity to perform in vivo structure/function analysis to determine the exact mechanism for activation.In summary, this study provides the first directdocumentation that up-regulation of NHE1 is responsible for the enhanced Na+/H+ exchanger activity observed in salivary gland acinar cells during muscarinic stimulation. By maintaining the intracellular pH at a higher value (and hence a higher intracellular [HCO3−]), NHE1 promotes fluid secretion by enhancing the accumulation of intracellular Cl− via the basolateral Cl−/HCO3− exchanger (42Melvin J.E. Turner R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: G393-G398PubMed Google Scholar), thereby providing a greater driving force for Cl− and HCO3− exit (1Melvin J.E. Moran A. Turner R.J. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1997; 433: 260-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), NHE2 may play an important role in modulating the activity of the pH-sensitive apical anion channel, with activity decreasing as the intracellular pH drops (15Arreola J. Melvin J.E. Begenisich T. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 147: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It is still unclear exactly how muscarinic stimulation up-regulates the exchanger activity of NHE1 in salivary gland acinar cells. Available evidence suggests that a combination of elevated [Ca2+]i, cell shrinkage, and/or Cl−loss plays a central role and that this increased activity is independent of protein kinase C, calmodulin, and phosphorylation of NHE1 (8Robertson M.A. Foskett J.K.

A null background affords, by expression of a mutated form of the Nhe1 gene, a unique opportunity to perform in vivo structure/function analysis to determine the exact mechanism for activation. In summary, this study provides the first directdocumentation that up-regulation of NHE1 is responsible for the enhanced Na+/H+ exchanger activity observed in salivary gland acinar cells during muscarinic stimulation. By maintaining the intracellular pH at a higher value (and hence a higher intracellular [HCO3−]), NHE1 promotes fluid secretion by enhancing the accumulation of intracellular Cl− via the basolateral Cl−/HCO3− exchanger (42Melvin J.E. Turner R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: G393-G398PubMed Google Scholar), thereby providing a greater driving force for Cl− and HCO3− exit (1Melvin J.E. Moran A. Turner R.J. J. Biol.

KATP channels are weak inward rectifiers that are modulated by intracellular ATP/ADP ratios. The open state of the channel stabilizes the resting potential of the cell membrane near the potassium equilibrium potential. Inhibition of KATPchannels by high levels of intracellular ATP or pharmacological reagents such as sulfonylureas leads to membrane depolarization, which in turn induces insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells and contraction in vascular smooth muscle. These channels have been implicated in the etiology or treatment of several pathophysiological disorders including persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy, ischemia, and hypertension (for review, see Refs. 1Ashcroft F.M.

KATP is a heteromultimeric channel consisting of pore-forming subunits Kir 6.x, which are members of the inwardly rectifying potassium channel family, and regulatory subunits, the sulfonylurea receptors (SUR), which are members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family.

In light of the genetic and pharmacological importance of the SUR subunit, understanding the topological organization of the protein will assist in crucial structure-function and drug binding studies. Based on sequence analysis, SUR is a multispanning transmembrane protein. It has three hydrophobic domains, TM0, TM1, and TM2, each of which is followed by a hydrophilic region (Fig. 1 A) (13Tusnády G.E. Bakos E. Váradi A. Sarkadi B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Within the TM0, TM1, and TM2 domains are multiple hydrophobic segments, each of which could potentially span the membrane. Initial biochemical purification and amino-terminal microsequencing of SUR1 indicated a glycosylation site near the amino terminus (14Aguilar-Bryan L. Nichols C.G. Wechsler S.W. Clement J.P., IV Boyd III, A.E. González G. Herrera-Sosa H. Nguy K. Bryan J. Nelson D.A. Science. 1995; 268: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar, 15Nelson D.A. Bryan J. Wechsler S. Clement J.P., IV Aguilar-Bryan L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14793-14799Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent studies of the cloned receptor suggest that the glycosylated form of the SUR1 protein is physically associated with Kir 6.2 (16Clement J.P.I. Kunjilwar K. González G. Schwanstecher M. Panten U. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 827-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar), suggesting an extracellular localization for the amino terminus of the SUR1 subunit in the KATPchannel. The two nucleotide binding folds (NBFs) are found within the two hydrophilic domains following TM1 and TM2(Fig. 1 A). Mutational analysis and binding studies have determined that both NBFs are sensitive to changes in intracellular concentrations of Mg2+-ADP and Mg2+-ATP (8Gribble F.M. Tucker S.J. Ashcroft F.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1145-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar,17Nichols C.G. Shyng S.L. Nestorowicz A. Glaser B. Clement J.P., IV González G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Permutt M.A. Bryan J.

These data therefore suggest that the two NBFs are on the cytoplasmic face of the membrane; however, the topology of the rest of the protein has yet to be determined directly. To date, two topological models have been proposed in the literature based on hydrophobicity analysis and sequence alignment with other ABC proteins (Fig. 1, B and C). Tusnádyet al. proposed a total of 17 transmembrane segments grouped within the three hydrophobic modules TM0, TM1, and TM2 with a 5+6+6 arrangement, respectively (Fig.1 B) (2Babenko A.P. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 667-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 13Tusnády G.E. Bakos E. Váradi A. Sarkadi B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). An alternative model suggested 13 transmembrane segments (4+5+4) (Fig. 1 C) (14Aguilar-Bryan L. Nichols C.G. Wechsler S.W. Clement J.P., IV Boyd III, A.E. González G. Herrera-Sosa H. Nguy K. Bryan J. Nelson D.A. Science. 1995; 268: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). Tusnády et al. (13Tusnády G.E. Bakos E. Váradi A. Sarkadi B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) proposed that all ABC proteins possess the “core” TM1 and TM2 modules typified by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator and P-glycoprotein. A subset of the ABC proteins, however, has an additional hydrophobic amino-terminal TM0 domain. This subset includes SUR, multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP), MRP-related liver canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter, rabbit epithelial basolateral chloride conductance regulator, and yeast cadmium factor 1. It has been suggested that the topological organization of the ABC proteins may reveal common functional domains within the superfamily. Recently, it has been speculated that the unique TM0 region might influence drug binding affinities and/or transport properties because all of these proteins bind or transport drugs (13Tusnády G.E. Bakos E. Váradi A. Sarkadi B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 20Gao M. Yamazaki M. Loe D.W. Westlake C.J. Grant C.E. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10733-10740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We report here the membrane topology of the TM0 domain of SUR1. We chose to investigate the TM0 domain for several reasons. First, the membrane topology of the amino-terminal region often influences the folding of the rest of the protein (21Blobel G. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 67: 835-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (1833) Google Scholar, 22Skach W.R. Lingappa V.R. Loh Y.P. Mechanisms of Intracellular Trafficking and Processing of Proproteins.

Second, this domain is unique compared with that of most ABC proteins; and finally, the models proposed in the literature describing the topology of SUR differ in the number of hydrophobic regions specified in this domain (Fig. 1, B and C) (2Babenko A.P. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 667-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 13Tusnády G.E. Bakos E. Váradi A. Sarkadi B.

Nelson D.A. Science. 1995; 268: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that the TM0 region of SUR1 associated with Kir 6.2 consists of five transmembrane segments with the amino terminus localized to the extracellular side of the membrane and the hydrophilic region between TM0 and TM1 on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. The locations of membrane-spanning helicies in hamster SUR1 were predicted using hydrophobicity analysis (24Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17217) Google Scholar), hidden Markov methods HMMTOP (25Tusnády G.E. Simon I. J. Mol.

Hamster SUR1 cDNA (14Aguilar-Bryan L. Nichols C.G. Wechsler S.W. Clement J.P., IV Boyd III, A.E. González G. Herrera-Sosa H. Nguy K. Bryan J. Nelson D.A. Science. 1995; 268: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar) was subcloned into pcDNA3.1/HisC (Invitrogen) at the EcoRI site to create full-length SUR1 with an amino-terminal His tag. Full-length SUR1 with a carboxyl-terminal V5-fusion tag was created by replacement of the stop codon with an XhoI site and subcloning into the EcoRI-XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1/V5-HisA (Invitrogen). cDNAs coding for the amino-terminal region of SUR1 were fused to the soluble portion of bovine prolactin, resulting in SUR74PL, SUR102PL, SUR134PL, SUR168PL, SUR202PL, SUR248PL, and SUR285PL. Each fusion protein contained the amino terminus of SUR1 through the amino acid number indicated followed by a 1-amino acid Gly linker, then the carboxyl-terminal 142 amino acids of bovine prolactin, omitting the prolactin signal sequence. First, a cDNA (SUR296-pcDNA) coding for the first five hydrophobic segments of SUR1 was made by truncating SUR1 after amino acid 296 via digestion of SUR1-pcDNA3.1/HisC withBsmBI, treating with Klenow then with EcoRV, and ligating. SacII sites were introduced individually directly following the nucleotides encoding Arg74, Arg102, Arg134, Lys168, Arg202, Arg248, and Arg285 in SUR296-pcDNA, and just before Cys58 of bovine prolactin by site-directed mutagenesis (CLONTECH). The amino acid sequence at the fusion site was preserved with the exception of a Lys168 to Arg168 change in the SUR168PL construct. The cDNA encoding the carboxyl-terminal 142 amino acids of bovine prolactin was fused to SUR1 at the inserted SacII site and the vector XbaI site. All constructs were sequenced over the region of fusion (Sequenase 2.0, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Constructs lacking the amino-terminal His tag were then subcloned into the high expression vector pGEMHE at the EcoRI andXbaI sites. Thus, two sets of SUR-prolactin fusion proteins were generated: SURxxxPL and His-SURxxxPL, with the latter group containing an amino-terminal His tag. CandidateN-linked glycosylation sites at Asn10 and/or Asn1050 were mutated to create proteins lacking one (SUR-N10Q and SUR-N1050Q) or both (SUR-N10Q,N1050Q) putative glycosylation sites. Rat Kir 6.2 was cloned by polymerase chain reaction from a rat heart cDNA library 2F. Périer and C. A. Vandenberg, unpublished data. using primers for the nucleotide sequences 52–70 and 1463–1479 of mouse Kir 6.2 cDNA (6Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Clement J.P., IV Namba N. Inazawa J. González G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Seino S. Bryan J. Science. 1995; 270: 1166-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1618) Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction product ends were blunted, ligated into the SmaI site of Bluescript KS− (Stratagene), sequenced on both strands, then subcloned into theBamHI-EcoRI sites of pcDNA1/Amp (Invitrogen). COS-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. SUR1, SUR-N10Q, SUR-N1050Q, and SUR-N10Q,N1050Q (20–30 μg/100-mm plate) were cotransfected with Kir 6.2 (1–4 μg/100-mm plate) using pFx-2 (Invitrogen). 48 h after transfection, COS-1 cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lifted with 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were pelleted, homogenized in buffer A (0.25m sucrose, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm TCEP, 1 mm EDTA, 15 μg/ml DNase, 10 μg/ml RNase, 1 × CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)), and the nuclear fraction was pelleted at 80 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was saved, and the pellet was rehomogenized in buffer A and centrifuged as above. Supernatants were combined, and membranes were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and then resuspended in buffer A and stored at −80 °C. Membrane protein (5–20 μg) from COS-1 cells transfected with Kir 6.2 and SUR1 or in vitro translated SUR-prolactin fusion proteins (10 μl, see methods below) were treated with the glycosidase PNGase F. In brief, protein was denatured by boiling for 10 min in 0.5% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol. Sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, and Nonidet P-40 were added to a final concentration of 50 mm and 1%, respectively. Samples were incubated with 5 units (for membrane protein) or 2.5 units (for fusion protein) of PNGase F (New England Biolabs) at 37 °C for 1 h. Products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography or Western blot. Samples containing 5–20 μg of total membrane protein isolated from COS-1 cells cotransfected with Kir 6.2 and SUR1 were solubilized in TCEP-SDS sample buffer (15 mm Tris, pH 9.0, 2.5% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm TCEP) and boiled for 20 min. After separation by SDS-PAGE (2–12% gradient), proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (Hybond, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), analyzed by immunoblotting with V5 antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:1,000; Invitrogen), and visualized by chemiluminescence (Super SignalTMWest Dura; Pierce). SUR-prolactin fusion proteins were translated in vitro using a coupled transcription/translation system in the presence of [35S]Met and canine pancreatic microsomal membranes (4 equivalents/25 μl, Promega). 10-μl samples of in vitrotranslated fusion protein were treated with 10 μg/ml proteinase K (Stratagene) in the presence and absence of 1.2% Trition X-100 for 1 h on ice. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Microsomes were pelleted at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the membranes were resuspended in 1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Samples were incubated at 100 °C for 10 min, diluted to a final concentration of 0.1% SDS with buffer B (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and immunoprecipitated with anti-prolactin antibody. Positive control fusion protein samples were subjected to the same protocol omitting the proteinase K and Triton X-100 treatment. To assess the integrity of the microsomes, a parallel sample containingin vitro translated bovine prolactin was similarly subjected to proteinase K treatment as an additional control that was included in each experiment. The prolactin reporter, ± proteinase K treatment, was immunoprecipitated, separated by SDS-PAGE, and detected by autoradiography. In brief, polyclonal rabbit anti-sheep prolactin antibody (ICN) was preabsorbed to protein A or G agarose beads (Pierce) at room temperature for 2 h. The antibody-protein A/G complex was washed once in buffer B, mixed with solubilized protein for a final antibody dilution of 1:500, and incubated at room temperature for 1–2 h with constant agitation. The protein-antibody-protein A/G complex was washed twice with buffer B followed by a final wash with H2O. Protein was eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer for 5 min and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a reducing 13.5 or 15% gel followed by autoradiography. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of SUR1 using algorithms that identify putative transmembrane helices predicted several topologies for SUR1.

Science. 1995; 268: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar), produced a total of six models containing 13, 15, 16, 17, or 18 transmembrane helices, with none of the models identical. Of the three algorithms designed to predict helix orientation, all suggested that the amino terminus resided extracellularly. These predictions are consistent with the significant positive charge difference Δ(C-N) of residues surrounding the first hydrophobic segment of SUR1 which typify an extracellular amino terminus (23Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5786-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Many transmembrane helices were predicted consistently, whereas others were identified only by some of the algorithms. In the TM0region, between four and six transmembrane segments were predicted. The Tusnády et al. model suggested five transmembrane segments in this area (13Tusnády G.E. Bakos E. Váradi A. Sarkadi B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The third of these (HR3) was skipped in some models, and in one case an additional transmembrane segment was added following HR5. In contrast to the Tusnády et al.model, which predicted an intracellular orientation for the large hydrophilic loop between TM0 and TM1, the models with four and six transmembrane segments in the TM0region predicted an extracellular location for this loop. The TM1 region was predicted to have five to eight transmembrane segments (six in the Tusnády et al.model (13Tusnády G.E. Bakos E. Váradi A. Sarkadi B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar)), with HR8 most frequently skipped. The TM2region was predicted to have four to six transmembrane segments (six in the Tusnády et al. model (13Tusnády G.E. Bakos E. Váradi A. Sarkadi B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar)), with HR14 and HR17 most frequently skipped. Only three of the six models predicted an even number of transmembrane segments in the TM2 region, which resulted in placement of the nucleotide binding folds on the same side of the membrane for only half of the models. Overall, the topology predictions showed that although several features of the SUR1 topology can be predicted, there was no agreement on the transmembrane assignments or orientations by the modeling algorithms. To begin our study of the topology of SUR1 we investigated the endogenous sites ofN-linked glycosylation. Purification and microsequencing of the sulfonylurea receptor had suggested previously that the amino terminus of SUR1 is glycosylated, indicating an extracellular location (14Aguilar-Bryan L. Nichols C.G. Wechsler S.W. Clement J.P., IV Boyd III, A.E. González G. Herrera-Sosa H. Nguy K. Bryan J. Nelson D.A. Science. 1995; 268: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar, 15Nelson D.A. Bryan J. Wechsler S. Clement J.P., IV Aguilar-Bryan L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14793-14799Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To explore this possibility further we examined the glycosylation state of the consensus glycosylation acceptor sites (Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr) at Asn10 and Asn1050 in SUR1. In both topological models presented in the literature these two sites are predicted to reside on the extracellular side of the membrane (Fig.1, B and C). Immunoblot analysis of SUR1 using an epitope-specific V5 antibody detected the presence of two major bands of approximately equal intensities at apparent molecular masses of 187 and 164 kDa when SUR1 was coexpressed with Kir 6.2 (Fig.2, first lane), consistent with previous reports of mature “complex” glycosylation and immature “core” glycosylation forms of SUR (15Nelson D.A. Bryan J. Wechsler S. Clement J.P., IV Aguilar-Bryan L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14793-14799Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Upon treatment of SUR1 with the endoglycosidase PNGase F, which is specific forN-linked glycosylation, SUR1 migrated as a single band (Fig.2, second lane) at a relative mobility similar to the lower band in the untreated sample. The mobility of immature SUR1 was not easily differentiated from that of unglycosylated SUR1 in Fig. 2(first two lanes) because of the minor difference of ∼3 kDa in molecular mass between the two forms (15Nelson D.A. Bryan J. Wechsler S. Clement J.P., IV Aguilar-Bryan L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14793-14799Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). When SUR1 was expressed in the absence of Kir 6.2, the resulting band comigrated with the immature form of the protein (data not shown), consistent with reports that the highly glycosylated form of SUR1 is found when Kir 6.2 is coexpressed (16Clement J.P.I. Kunjilwar K. González G. Schwanstecher M. Panten U. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 827-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). To determine which residues were glycosylated, the predicted glycosylation acceptor sites Asn10 and Asn1050were mutated either individually (SUR-N10Q, and SUR-N1050Q) or together (SUR-N10Q,1050Q). Expression of SUR-N10Q (Fig. 2, third andfourth lanes) and SUR-N1050Q (Fig. 2, fifth andsixth lanes) demonstrated that elimination of either of the Asn10 or Asn1050 glycosylation consensus sites resulted in a significant decrease of mature glycosylated receptor compared with wild type SUR1. Furthermore, simultaneous removal of both the Asn10 and Asn1050 sites in SUR-N10Q,N1050Q resulted only in a band that comigrated with the unglycosylated form of the protein (Fig. 2, seventh and eighth lanes), indicating that both Asn10 and Asn1050 were glycosylated in wild type SUR1. A reduction in glycosylation on SUR-N10Q relative to wild type SUR1 is in agreement with previous studies suggesting that Asn10 on the SUR1 amino terminus is glycosylated (14Aguilar-Bryan L. Nichols C.G. Wechsler S.W. Clement J.P., IV Boyd III, A.E. González G. Herrera-Sosa H. Nguy K. Bryan J. Nelson D.A.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14793-14799Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These results place both the amino terminus and the hydrophilic region containing amino acid 1050 on the extracellular side of the membrane. Asn1050 is located in the TM2 domain and is predicted to reside extracellularly between the 12th and 13th putative transmembrane segments in the 5+6+6 model of Tusnády et al. (13Tusnády G.E. Bakos E. Váradi A. Sarkadi B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). We chose a classical protease protection approach to investigate which HRs span the membrane. Seven chimeric cDNAs were constructed which code for the amino terminus of SUR1 fused to the prolactin reporter. The prolactin reporter, consisting of the carboxyl-terminal soluble portion of prolactin, has been shown to have no effect on upstream signal and stop transfer sequences (30Rothman R.E. Andrews D.W.

Surprisingly, the K142A mutant MutY, but not the wild-type enzyme, could promote a β/δ-elimination on apurinic DNA. Our results suggest that Asp-138 acts as a general base to deprotonate either the ε-amine group of Lys-142 or to activate a water molecule and the resulting apurinic DNA then reacts with Lys-142 to form the Schiff base intermediate with DNA.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11140-11152Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Other supportive evidence for MutY AP lyase activity is that MutY can form a covalent Schiff base intermediate with its DNA substrates (33Gogos A. Cillo J. Clarke N.D. Lu A-L.

Thus, MutY represents a unique group of glycosylases because it does not have the conserved lysine but can form a Schiff base intermediate with its DNA substrates. In this paper, we have investigated the reaction mechanism of MutY. We show that Asp-138 can act as a general base to activate a nucleophile. The glycosylase and trapping activities were completely abolished in the D138N MutY protein but the DNA binding activity of this mutant protein was not drastically different from that of the wild-type enzyme. The N-terminal domains of MutY, residues 1–226 (M25) (33Gogos A. Cillo J. Clarke N.D. Lu A-L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16665-16671Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and residues 1–225 (p26) (43Manuel R.C. Lloyd R.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11140-11152Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 45Manuel R.C. Czerwinski E.W. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol.

We isolated the imino-covalent M25-DNA intermediate and identified several lysine residues (Lys-142, Lys-157, and Lys-158) of MutY in the proximity of the active site. Mutation of Lys-157 and Lys-158 both individually and combined, had no effect on MutY activities. Mutagenesis of Lys-142 to Ala confirmed that Lys-142 could form a Schiff base with DNA. However, K142A MutY mutant still had adenine glycosylase activity. Moreover, the K142A MutY mutant is different from the wild-type enzyme by its possession of a β/δ-elimination activity on DNA containing an AP/8-oxoG. Possible reaction mechanisms of MutY are discussed. The entire mutYgene in pJTW10–12 (24Tsai-Wu J.-J. Liu H.-F. Lu A-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8779-8783Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR with two primers: Chang 222 (5′-GCGACGCATATGCAAGCGTCGCAATTTTC-3′) and Chang 90 (5′-GCCGGAGGATCCCTAAACCGGCGCGCCAGTGC-3′). Similarly, the N-terminal domain of the mutY gene corresponding to Met-1 to Gln-226 (M25) was PCR-amplified from pJTW10–12 by primers Chang 222 and Chang 223 (5′-GCCGGAGGATCCCTACTGTTTCGGTTTTTTGCCCG-3′). The primer Chang 222 contains an NdeI site at 5′ ends of the coding sequences, and primers Chang 90 and Chang 223 contain aBamHI site after the stop codons. The PCR products were purified from agarose gels, cut with NdeI andBamHI, and cloned into anNdeI/BamHI-digested pET11a expression vector. The inserted MutY sequences in the resulting clones pMYW-1 for the entire mutY gene and pJ16–146-13 for Met-1–Gln-226 were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The mutY gene and its derivatives in the plasmid pET11a were under the control of the T7 promoter. The expression host of the mutY mutants, PR70 (Su-lacZ X74 galU galK Smr micA68::Tn10Kan obtained from M. S. Fox) harboring the λDE3 lysogen, was constructed according to the procedures described by Invitrogen. The QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene was utilized to mutate Asp-138 of the MutY gene to Asn. Two complementary oligonucleotides, Chang 224 (5′-GTAAGCACTTTCCGATTTTAAACGGTAACGTCAAAC-3′) and Chang 225 (5′-GTTTGACGTTACCGTTTAAAATCGGAAAGTGCTTAC-3′), were used to construct this mutation. Briefly, the oligonucleotides were phosphorylated by polynucleotide kinase and used in a PCR reaction with pMYW-1 (containing the wild-type mutY gene) as the template according to the Expand High Fidelity PCR procedure (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The resulting nicked circular DNA was then purified and digested with DpnI to remove the methylated and hemi-methylated DNA. The digested DNA was then self-ligated and transformed into XL-1 Blue cells (Stratagene). The mutant gene was first screened for the generation of a DraI restriction site, then further confirmed by DNA sequencing. The K158A mutant was constructed by the method of Kunkel et al. (48Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). The 1.3-kilobase BamHI-SphI fragment containing the mutY gene was excised from pMYW-1 and cloned into BamHI-SphI site of M13mp18 for mutagenesis. Oligonucleotide Chang 259 (5′-CTGGCCTGGGAAAGCTGAGGTCGAGAAT-3′) was used to construct the mutation. The K158A mutant was first screened for the generation of anAluI restriction site, then further confirmed by DNA sequencing. Mutants K157Q, K157A-K158A double mutant, and K142A were constructed by PCR splicing overlap extension method (49Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6850) Google Scholar). Two complementary oligonucleotides covering the mutation site were synthesized. The oligonucleotide pairs containing the antisense sequence and Chang 222 as well as the oligonucleotide pairs containing the sense sequence and Chang 90 were used as primers and pJTW10–12 was used as the template to amplify the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of mutY, respectively. Both purified PCR products were then mixed in a 1:1 ratio and used as templates for another PCR reaction containing Chang 222 and Chang 90 primers. The resulting PCR products were cloned into pET11a as described above. All the oligonucleotides used are listed in TableI. Mutants K157Q, K157A-K158A, and K142A were first screened for the generation of MscI,SalI, and XhoI restriction sites, respectively, then confirmed by DNA sequencing.Table IOligonucleotides usedNameSequencePurposeChang 2225′-GCGACGCATATGCAAGCGTCGCAATTTTC-3′NdeI/M1Chang 905′-GCCGGAGGATCCCTAAACCGGCGCGCCAGTGC-3′BamHI/V350Chang 2235′-GCCGGAGGATCCCTACTGTTTCGGTTTTTTGCCCG-3′BamHI/Q226Chang 2245′-GTAAGCACTTTCCGATTTTAAACGGTAACGTCAAAC-3′D138N senseChang 2255′-GTTTGACGTTACCGTTTAAAATCGGAAAGTGCTTAC-3′D138N antisenseChang 2595′-CTGGCCTGGGAAAGCTGAGGTCGAGAAT-3′K158AChang 2685′-GTAAGCGGCTGGCCTGGCCAAAAAGAGGTCGAG-3′K157Q senseChang 2695′-CTCGACCTCTTTTTGGCCAGGCCAGCCGCTTAC-3′K157Q antisenseChang 2795′-CTCGACGGTAACGTCGCTCGAGTGCTGGCGCGCTGC-3′K142A senseChang 2805′-GCAGCGCGCCAGCACTCGAGCGACGTTACCGTCGAG-3′K142A antisenseChang 2815′-TAAGCGGCTGGCCTGGTCGACGAGAGGTCGAGAATAAA-3′K157A/K158A senseChang 2825′-TTTATTCTCGACCTCTCGTCGACCAGGCCAGCCGCTTA-3′K157A/K158A antisense Open table in a new tab E. coli cells PR70/DE3 harboring the expression plasmid containing MutY, MutY mutants, or M25 were grown in LB broth containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 30 °C. The expression of MutY and its derivatives were induced at an A 590 of 0.6 by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm to the culture at 23 °C. The cells were harvested 16 h later. Mutant MutY proteins were quickly checked for activity in the crude cell extracts from 50-ml cultures. Cells were centrifuged in a SS34 rotor at 10,000 rpm for 15 min. The cell pellets were resuspended in 4 ml of 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol and sonicated for 6 cycles of 10 s, followed by 5 s of rest each cycle. After centrifuging at 10,000 rpm in a SS34 rotor for 40 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was quickly frozen in small aliquots at −80 °C. Alternatively, cell extracts from 1 liter of E. coli cells were prepared as described previously (50Lu A-L. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4639-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). M25 domain and MutY mutant proteins (D138N and K142A) were purified from approximately 40 g of E. coli PR70/DE3 cells harboring the respective overproduction plasmids, similar to the method used with wild-type enzyme (24Tsai-Wu J.-J. Liu H.-F. Lu A-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8779-8783Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Nicking of A/G-containing 20-mer DNA was assayed during the purification of the M25 domain. Binding of A/GO-containing 20-mer DNA was assayed during the purification of the MutY(D138N) and MutY(K142A) enzymes. As judged on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, all proteins were purified to >99% homogeneity (data not shown). The purification of homogeneous MutY protein from an overproducing E. coli JM109 strain, harboring pJTW10–12, has been described previously (24Tsai-Wu J.-J. Liu H.-F. Lu A-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8779-8783Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides of 19-mer containing base mismatches were labeled as described by Luet al. (14Lu A-L. Tsai-Wu J.-J. Cillo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23582-23588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). E. coli uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. DNA substrates containing U/G or U/GO (300 fmol) were fully converted to AP/G or AP/GO by treating with 1.5 units of UDG at 37 °C for 1 h in MutY buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 80 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 2.9% glycerol). The MutY activity assays with labeled oligonucleotide substrates were performed as described by Lu et al. (44Lu A-L. Yuen D.S. Cillo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24138-24143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) with some modifications. MutY enzyme was diluted with diluent (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 50% glycerol) before use. MutY binding and cleavage (glycosylase) buffer contains 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 80 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 2.9% glycerol. MutY trapping buffer contains 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 2.9% glycerol. For the glycosylase assays, unless specified in reactions, samples after reactions were lyophilized to dry, resuspended in 3 μl of formamide dye (90% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue), heated at 90 °C for 2 min, and loaded onto 14% 7 m urea sequencing gels. A covalent complex of M25 with A/G-containing 19-mer DNA was formed in a reaction containing 1.8 nmol of DNA and 1.8 nmol of M25 in 180 μl of cleavage reaction buffer in the presence of 0.1 mNaBH4. A NaBH4 stock solution was freshly prepared and was added immediately after M25 was added. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, 5× dye buffer (0.5 msucrose, 15% SDS, 312.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.9, 10 mm EDTA, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.0025% bromphenol blue) was added to the samples, which were heated at 90 °C for 2 min and separated on a 12% polyacrylamide gel in the presence of SDS (SDS-PAGE) according to Laemmli (51Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207479) Google Scholar). The SDS-polyacrylamide gel used was cast 1–3 days before use with 0.1 m thioglycolate present in the running buffer to scavenge reactive compounds left in the gel. Electrophoretic transfer to a PVDF membrane (Millipore) was performed using a Trans-Blot cell. The membrane was pre-wet in 100% methanol followed by transfer buffer (12.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 96 mm glycine, 10% methanol, and 0.001% SDS). Proteins were transferred overnight at 4 °C at 30 V. The PVDF membrane was washed and stained in 10% Ponceau S for 10 min and destained in water. Both DNA-bound and free protein bands were excised from the PVDF membrane and submitted to in situ digestion with trypsin (52Fernandez J. Andrews L. Mische S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 113-117Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar), substituting 0.1% Zwittergent 316 for Triton RTX-100 in the digestion buffer. The resulting peptides were separated by microbore high performance liquid chromatography using a Zorbax C18 1.0 mm by 150 mm reverse-phase column on a Hewlett-Packard 1090 HPLC/1040 diode array detector. Optimum fractions from the chromatograms were chosen based on differential UV absorbance at 205, 277, and 292 nm, and peak symmetry and resolution. Peaks were further screened for length and homogeneity by matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry on a Lasermat 2000 (Finnigan, Hemel, United Kingdom). Selected fractions were subjected to automated Edman degradation on a model 477A Sequencing System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Details of strategies for the selection of peptide fractions and their microsequencing have been previously described (53Lane W.S. Galat A. Harding M.W. Schreiber S.L. J. Prot. Chem. 1991; 10: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Alternatively, tryptic peptide sequences were determined by microcapillary HPLC/electrospray ionization/tandem mass spectrometry on a Finnigan LCQ quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer (San Jose, CA) as described by Nash et al. (27Nash H.M. Bruner S.D. Scharer O.D. Kawate T. Addona T.A. Spooner E. Lane W.S. Verdine G.L. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 968-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, purified MutY(D138N) mutant was inactive in the glycosylase assay with both A/G- and A/GO-containing 20-mer DNA even at an enzyme concentration of 25 nm with an enzyme/DNA molar ratio of 278. However, in the control reactions, wild-type MutY protein cleaved both A/G- and A/GO-containing DNA. The trapping assay of MutY (D138N) in the presence of sodium borohydride indicated that this mutant did not form any covalent-complexes with A/G- and A/GO-containing DNA (data not shown). Thus, these results confirmed that MutY(D138N) was defective in glycosylase activity. In initial studies with crude extracts, we observed that MutY(D138N) could bind A/G-and A/GO-containing DNA (data not shown). Thus,"

To further characterize the various domains, we constructed a series of point mutants with a critical active site Glu of duck CPD converted to Gln. The proteins were expressed in the baculovirus system, purified to homogeneity, and characterized. Point mutations within both the first and second domains eliminated enzyme activity, indicating that the third domain is inactive toward dansyl-Phe-Ala-Arg. CPD removed only the C-terminal Lys or Arg from peptides, with the first domain more efficient toward Arg and the second domain more efficient toward Lys. Peptides containing Pro in the penultimate position were poorly cleaved by either domain. Cleavage of a peptide with Ala in the penultimate position was most efficient, with the relative order Ala ≥ Met > Ser, Phe > Tyr > Trp > Thr ≥ Gln, Asp, Leu, Gly ≫ Pro for CPD with both domains active. There were only minor differences between the first and the second domains regarding the influence of the penultimate amino acid. The first domain was optimally active at pH 6.3–7.5, whereas the second domain was optimally active at pH 5.0–6.5. Thus, the first and second carboxypeptidase domains have complementary enzyme activities. Furthermore, the finding that CPD with both domains active shows a broad activity to a wide range of substrates is consistent with a role for this enzyme in the processing of many proteins that transit the secretory pathway.

CPD was recently discovered in a search for CPE-like enzymes that could contribute to peptide processing in theCpe fat /Cpe fat mouse (27Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25007-25013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). These mice lack active CPE due to a point mutation that converts a Ser into a Pro (28Naggert J.K. Fricker L.D. Varlamov O. Nishina P.M. Rouille Y. Steiner D.F. Carroll R.J. Paigen B.J. Leiter E.H. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). The mutant CPE is inactive and is rapidly degraded prior to transport into the Golgi (29Varlamov O. Leiter E.H. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13981-13986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Without active CPE, theCpe fat /Cpe fat mice have greatly elevated levels of peptide processing intermediates with C-terminal basic residues, and reduced levels of the fully processed peptides (28Naggert J.K. Fricker L.D. Varlamov O. Nishina P.M. Rouille Y. Steiner D.F. Carroll R.J. Paigen B.J. Leiter E.H. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar,30Rovere C. Viale A.

However, low levels of mature peptides are detected, indicating that another enzyme is able to partially compensate for the absence of CPE activity. A search for novel CPE-like enzymes led to the identification of CPD, carboxypeptidase Z, and proteins designated CPX-1 and CPX-2 (27Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25007-25013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 32Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol.

In addition, another group identified a protein designated AEBP1 as a novel member of the carboxypeptidase gene family (35He G.P. Muise A. Li A.W. Ro H.S. Nature. 1995; 378: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Of these proteins, only CPD and carboxypeptidase Z demonstrate activity toward standard CPE substrates (27Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25007-25013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 32Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol.

The cellular distribution of carboxypeptidase Z is restricted to specific cell types, such as the leptomeningeal cells in brain (36Xin X. Day R. Dong W. Lei Y. Fricker L.D. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In contrast, CPD has a broad tissue distribution and is present in many cell types in each tissue (37Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28884-28889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 38Xin X. Varlamov O. Day R. Dong W. Bridgett M.M. Leiter E.H. Fricker L.D.

Salafia C.M. Lage J.M. Fricker L.D. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 1359-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Also, CPD is present along with furin in the trans Golgi network and immature secretory vesicles (41Varlamov O. Fricker L.D. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 877-885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Varlamov O. Eng F.J. Novikova E.G. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14759-14767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Thus, CPD has the right cellular and subcellular distribution to participate to some extent in the processing of neuroendocrine peptides as well as playing a major role in the processing of proteins initially cleaved by furin. Human, rat, and duck CPD consists of three carboxypeptidase-like domains, a transmembrane domain, and then a short cytosolic tail (38Xin X. Varlamov O. Day R. Dong W. Bridgett M.M. Leiter E.H. Fricker L.D. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 897-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar,43Tan F. Rehli M. Krause S.W. Skidgel R.A. Biochem.

Chem. 1995; 270: 15022-15028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), whereas the Drosophila CPD homolog contains two (45Settle S.H.J. Green M.M. Burtis K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9470-9474Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and the Aplysia homolog contains four carboxypeptidase-like domains (46Fan X. Qian Y. Fricker L.D. Akalal D.B. Nagle G.T. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus, the general feature of multiple carboxypeptidase-like domains is highly conserved. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether the various domains perform complementary functions. A previous study investigated the activity of individual domains using a deletion approach and found that only the first two domains possessed enzymatic activity toward standard CPE substrates (47Eng F.J. Novikova E.G. Kuroki K. Ganem D. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8382-8388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, removal of hundreds of residues can potentially cause large changes in the structure of the protein. In the present study, we used a more selective mutagenesis approach and converted a single Glu residue in the first and/or second domains into a Gln (Fig. 1). This Glu, which corresponds to Glu270 in carboxypeptidase A and B and Glu300 in CPE, has been previously been shown to be essential for enzyme activity but not substrate binding (48Qian Y. Varlamov O. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11582-11586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus, this mutation would not be predicted to have a large impact on the structure of the protein. Using these point mutants, we confirmed that the third domain is devoid of enzyme activity toward the standard substrates. We also compared the enzymatic properties of the first and second domains using both standard substrates and a novel assay using a peptide mixture. The results of these analyses suggest that the two domains of CPD complement each other with regard to pH and specificity for C-terminal basic residues but show overlapping substrate specificities regarding the penultimate amino acid. The construction of gp170 and gp75 within the baculovirus expression vector pVL1392 (Pharmingen) were previously described (47Eng F.J. Novikova E.G. Kuroki K. Ganem D. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8382-8388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), resulting in vectors pVL170 and pVL75. For mutagenesis, portions of gp170 were first inserted into the vector pAlter (Promega). For mutation of the second domain (gp170(Q771)), a 1.2-kilobase pairStuI/SnaBI fragment was inserted into pAlter at its SmaI site. For mutation of the first domain (gp170(Q353)), a 750-base pairHindIII/SacI fragment was inserted into pAlter. Site-directed mutagenesis was then performed using the Quick-change mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). In each case, a GAG codon was converted to a CAG codon generating a new PvuII site. Following mutagenesis, a 670-base pair BamHI/DraIII fragment carrying the Gln771 mutation and a 750-base pairHindIII/SacI fragment carrying the Gln353 mutation were engineered back into the expression vectors pVL170 and pVL75. The plasmids were confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing of the regions used for mutagenesis and subcloning. Sf9 cells were co-transfected with 5 μg of baculovirus expression plasmid and 0.25 μg Baculo-Gold DNA (Pharminogen), and virus was amplified as described previously (32Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10543-10550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For purification of gp170, gp170(Q353), and gp170(Q771), 1 liter of medium from cells infected for 2–3 days was collected after centrifugation at 30,000 × gfor 30 min. The supernatant was adjusted to pH 5.5 with 0.1m sodium acetate and then applied to a 5-mlp-aminobenzoyl-Arg-Sepharose affinity resin. The column was washed with 100 mm NaAc buffer, pH 5.5, containing 1m NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100. Proteins were eluted with 50 ml of 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.01% Triton X-100, and 25 mm Arg. These eluates were concentrated to approximately 1 ml by filtration dialysis using a Centriplus 30 (Amicon). To decrease Arg concentration below 0.1 mm, the filtration was repeated two times with 15 ml of elute buffer lacking Arg. For studies using mass spectrometry, the Triton X-100 in the wash and elute buffers was replaced with 0.5 and 0.01% CHAPS, respectively. Enzyme activity was typically assayed with 0.2 mmdansyl-Phe-Ala-Arg in 100 mm, pH 6.4, Tris acetate buffer in a 250-μl final volume. After 30 min at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated with 100 μl of 0.5 m HCl, and then 2 ml of chloroform were added. After mixing and centrifugation for 2 min at 300 × g, the amount of product was determined by measuring the fluorescence in the chloroform phase (excitation 350 nm, emission 500 nm). The pH optimum of purified enzymes was determined with 0.2 mm dansyl-Phe-Ala-Arg in 0.1 m Tris acetate at the indicated pH. To examine the effect of site-directed inhibitors, purified enzymes were added to a mixture of buffer, substrate, and inhibitor to give a final concentration of 100 mm Tris acetate, pH 6.4, 100 μmdansyl-Phe-Ala-Arg, and 10-fold dilutions of inhibitor ranging from 100 μm to 1 nm. To examine the effect of general enzyme inhibitors and metals on gp170 and mutants, the compounds were preincubated with purified enzymes for 1 h at 4 °C and then assayed with 200 μm dansyl-Phe-Ala-Arg at pH 6.4. For kinetic analysis, purified enzyme was combined with substrate (final concentration 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 μm) and 100 mm Tris acetate pH 6.4, 0.01% Triton X-100 buffer in a final volume of 1 ml. After 30 min at 37 °C the reaction was terminated with the addition of 100 μl of 2 m HCl, and then 2 ml of chloroform was added. The amount of enzyme chosen was that which hydrolyzed a maximum of 20% of the peptide. The amount (nmol) of product was determined from standard curves for each peptide. The kinetic parameters were evaluated by fitting the data toy = (m 1 ×X)/(m 2 + X), using the KaleidaGraph program (where y represents velocity,X is substrate concentration, m 1 =V max, and m 2 =K m). Leucyl-enkephalin-Arg6(Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Leu-Arg) and leucyl-enkephalin-Lys6(Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Leu-Lys) were obtained from Sigma. Purified CPD in Tris acetate buffer, pH 6.4, was incubated with peptide (12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 μm) for 20 min at 37 °C in a final volume of 50 μl. The amount of enzyme used for the reaction was sufficient for 10–20% peptide hydrolysis over 20 min. Following the incubation, the reaction was quenched with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and frozen until analysis. Samples were analyzed by HPLC using a Hewlett Packard 1090 with a 5-μm 250 × 4.6-mm C18 column (Column Engineering, Ontario, CA) and a gradient from 20% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to 40% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 10 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Peptide was monitored at 280 nm. Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Leu-Arg eluted at 8.6 min, Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Leu-Lys eluted at 8.3 min, and Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Leu eluted at 10.8 min. Kinetic parameters were determined using KaleidaGraph, as described above. The mixed peptide Tyr-Glu-Pro-Gly-Ala-Pro-Ala-Ala-Gly-X-Arg, where Xrepresents Gly, Ala, Ser, Pro, Thr, Leu, Asp, Gln, Met, Phe, Tyr, or Trp, was synthesized by the Laboratory for Macromolecular Analysis, Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Purified enzymes were serially diluted 1:3 with 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.4, 0.01% acetylated bovine serum albumin and combined with 0.1 mmmixed substrate (calculated from the average molecular mass of the mixture) in a final volume of 30 μl. After 8 h at 37 °C, the reactions were frozen, lyophilized, and reconstituted in 50 μl of 50% acetonitrile, 50% H2O containing 1% acetic acid. Each sample was analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry on a Finnigan quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer. The sample solution (20 μl) was introduced with a syringe pump into the mass spectrometer ion source at a flow rate of 3 μl/min. The mass spectrometer performance was optimized with the autotuning feature on the instrument using the standard peptides des-Arg1-bradykinin ((M + 2H)2+ =m/z 452.5) and Arg insulin ((M + 4H)4+ = m/z 1492.5). Each spectrum represented an average of approximately 100 scans collected over 2 min, with a scan range of m/z 500–1400. The data were processed with Bioexplore software. The percentage of product formed for each dilution of enzyme was calculated by the formula (Hp + HpNa)/(Hp + HpNa +Hs) × 100 (where Hp is the peak height of the ion of the product, HpNa is the peak height of the ion of the product plus sodium, and Hs is the peak height of the ion of the substrate). Previous studies had established that duck CPD (gp180) lacking the C-terminal transmembrane domain was soluble and secreted from cells into the medium (47Eng F.J. Novikova E.G. Kuroki K. Ganem D. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8382-8388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The enzymatic properties of this 170-kDa form of duck CPD (termed gp170) were found to be identical to those of full-length gp180, so we chose to use the soluble form for further analysis of the individual domains. Wild type gp170 and the various point mutants were expressed at high levels in Sf9 cells using the baculovirus expression system (Fig.2 A). In addition to the gp170 constructs, we also prepared a point mutation of Glu353 to Gln within CPD containing only the first domain (termed gp75); this was a necessary control for the binding to the affinity column (described below). The domain 1-specific form containing the point mutation, gp75(Q353), was also expressed at high levels in the Sf9 cells using baculovirus (Fig. 2 A). All of the constructs were also found at high levels in the media from infected Sf9 cells (Fig. 2 A). Cells infected with the wild type gp170 expressing baculovirus and the medium from these cells show levels of carboxypeptidase activity greater than 100-fold above that of control virus (Table I). Media and cells infected with gp170(Q353) or gp170(Q771) also show considerable carboxypeptidase activity. In contrast, the medium and cells infected with the double mutant show only background levels of enzyme activity (Table I). This result suggests that the mutation of Glu353 or Glu771 eliminates the enzyme activity of each domain and that the third domain of CPD does not have appreciable enzyme activity (<0.5% of the wild type enzyme). As a control, the mutation of Glu353 to Gln in the construct containing only the first domain of CPD shows no appreciable enzyme activity (Table I).Table ICarboxypeptidase activity in baculovirus-infected cells and mediaBaculovirusCellsMediaWild type virus0.410.23gp1705962gp170(Q771)4644gp170(Q353)4759gp170(Q353/771)0.460.15gp75(Q353)0.330.22Activity is expressed in nmol/min/106 cells and was assayed with 0.2 mm dansyl-Phe-Ala-Arg with less than 4% variation between duplicate determinations. Open table in a new tab Activity is expressed in nmol/min/106 cells and was assayed with 0.2 mm dansyl-Phe-Ala-Arg with less than 4% variation between duplicate determinations. All mutants are able to bind to thep-aminobenzoyl-Arg-Sepharose substrate affinity column and are eluted with 25 mm Arg (Fig. 2 B). Following this purification, only a single band is detected for each construct on denaturing polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 2 B). Following the purification, carboxypeptidase activity above background levels was only detected for the wild type gp170, the gp170(Q353) mutant, and the gp170(Q771) mutant, consistent with the results from the crude media and cell extracts. The double mutant and the p75(Q353) mutant had no activity detectable above the background obtained after subjecting the medium from control virus-infected cells to the same purification procedure. The pH optimum of wild type gp170 is 5–7 (Fig.3, bottom), consistent with previous studies (47Eng F.J. Novikova E.G. Kuroki K. Ganem D. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8382-8388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In contrast, the pH optimum of the construct with only the active first domain is 6.3–7.5, and the construct with only the active second domain is 5.0–6.5 (Fig. 3, top). Thus, the pH optimum of the protein with both domains active is a combination of the two individual domains. The construct with mutations in both the first and second domains had no detectable enzyme activity at any of the pH values examined (Fig. 3, top). The enzymatic activities of the various constructs were examined in the presence of several different ions and enzyme inhibitors. In response to a 1 mm concentration of various ions, domains 1 and 2 showed differences in their activation or inhibition (TableII). Whereas both domains were strongly inhibited by the chelating agent 1,10-phenanthroline, other chelating agents (EDTA and EGTA) inhibited mainly domain 1 (Table II). The active site-directed inhibitor guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid inhibited cleavage of 100 μm dansyl-Phe-Ala-Arg with IC50 values of 81, 32, and 170 nm for gp170, gp170(Q771), and gp170(Q353), respectively. The active site inhibitor 2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidinoethylthiopropanoic acid showed IC50 values of 2.4, 0.54, and 2.9 μm for gp170, gp170(Q771), and gp170(Q353), respectively. The construct with only the first domain active was inhibited by low concentrations of the thiol-directed inhibitor p-chloromercuriphenyl sulfonate (IC50 = 77 μm). Comparable inhibition of either the wild type gp170 or the construct with only the second domain active required 40-fold more inhibitor. Domain 1 was also more sensitive to HgCl2 (IC50 2.8 μm) than domain 2 (380 μm).Table IIEffect of ions and inhibitors (1 mm) on carboxypeptidase activitygp170Active domain 1, gp170(Q771)Active domain 2, gp170(Q353)CoCl2188258125ZnCl2424366CdCl2799754EDTA44377EGTA437881,10-Phenanthroline<13<1Activity is expressed as percentage of control (i.e. enzyme in the absence of inhibitor or ion), measured with 0.2 mmdansyl-Phe-Ala-Arg, with less than 5% variation between triplicate determinations.

The kinetic parameters for dansyl-Phe-Ala-Arg hydrolysis were evaluated for wild type gp170 and the two active constructs (TableIII). The k catvalue for domain 2 was approximately twice that of domain 1, and the sum of the two k cat values were close to thek cat for wild type gp170. The substrates dansyl-Pro-Ala-Arg and dansyl-Phe-Gly-Arg also showed higherk cat values for domain 2 than domain 1, whereas dansyl-Phe-Phe-Arg had comparable k cat values for the two domains. K m values for the four dansyl peptide substrates ranged from 9 to 50 μm. To evaluate the kinetic parameters of cleavage of C-terminal Arg versusLys, two enkephalin precursors were tested, and the amount of product was determined using HPLC. Wild type gp170 cleaved the two enkephalin-related peptides with comparable k catvalues but with a lower K m for the Lys-containing peptide (Table III). The Arg-containing peptide was cleaved with a higher k cat and lower K m by the construct with only the first domain active, compared with the construct with the second domain active.

Chem. 1999; 274: 22668-22678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Here we address three questions concerning Cet1p. (i) Does the interaction of Cet1p with Ceg1p require a functional triphosphatase active site in Cet1p? By using zonal velocity sedimentation as an assay for Cet1p-Ceg1p complex formation, we found that the interaction of these proteins is unaffected by mutations in motifs A, B, or C that abrogate RNA triphosphatase activity. (ii) What structural features of the amino acid side chain are functionally relevant at essential residues Glu-305, Glu-307, Arg-454, Glu-492, Glu-494, and Glu-496? Studies of the effects of conservative side chain substitutions on Cet1p function revealed underlying structure-activity relationships that have implications for the catalytic mechanism. (iii) Are other amino acids within motifs A, B, or C essential for Cet1p function? Expansion of the alanine scan defined two other residues required for Cet1p function (Phe-310 and Lys-456), as well as three residues (Leu-306, Val-493, and Leu-495) at which side chain removal results in thermal instability of Cet1p in vivo and in vitro.In addition, we ask whether the presence of motifs A, B, and C in a gene product of unknown function has predictive value with respect to the biochemical properties of that gene product. We noted previously (2Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5189-5198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that the amino acid sequence of the 320-amino acid polypeptide encoded by the S. cerevisiae YMR180C open reading frame displays local similarity to the sequence of Cet1p. The region of sequence similarity spans Cet1p residues 302–532 (the C-terminal catalytic domain) and includes motifs A, B, and C (Fig. 1). The function of YMR180C is unknown. Here we show that the protein encoded by this yeast gene (renamed CTH1, cap triphosphatase homolog) possesses magnesium-dependent RNA triphosphatase and manganese- or cobalt-dependent NTPase activitiesin vitro. Cth1p is nonessential for yeast growth and, by itself, cannot replace Cet1p in vivo. Yet, we find that fusion of Cth1p to the guanylyltransferase domain of mammalian capping enzyme allows Cth1p to complement growth of yeast cells deleted forCET1. These findings bear on the question of how the capping apparatus is specifically targeted to pre-mRNAs in vivo.DISCUSSIONThe present study of the yeast RNA triphosphatase Cet1p consolidates the hypothesis that motifs A, B, and C participate directly in phosphohydrolase reaction chemistry and substrate binding. Structure-activity relationships at essential side chains suggest a plausible catalytic mechanism, and the results of alanine scanning of the motifs lead to predictions for the secondary structures of motifs A and C. The identification of Cth1p as a second RNA triphosphatase inS. cerevisiae highlights that the occurrence of motifs A, B, and C has predictive value for the function of proteins identified by genomic sequencing, a point underscored by the demonstration that the motif A glutamates are required for Cth1p triphosphatase activity.Insights from Mutagenesis into the Structure and Catalytic Mechanism of Cet1pThe striking feature of motifs A (IELEMKF) and C (EVELE) is that they consist of charged side chains at every other position interdigitated with alternating aliphatic/aromatic side chains. This arrangement, together with mutational data, suggests that motifs A and C are folded as β-strands so that the hydrophilic and hydrophobic functional groups are arrayed on opposite sides of the main chain. Alanine substitutions of Phe-310 in motif A result in loss of function; the fact that function is restored by introduction of a leucine argues that the hydrophobic character of the side chain is important. Alanine substitutions for three of the other alternating aliphatic side chains (Leu-306 in motif A, plus Val-493, and Leu-495 in motif C) elicit thermolability in vivo and vitro. This suggests to us that the “back” surface of the predicted β-strands engages in hydrophobic interactions with other structural elements of the protein core that stabilize the active conformation of the hydrophilic residues of the strands. We predict that the hydrophilic surfaces of motifs A and C, which contain 5 essential glutamates, comprise part of the triphosphatase-active site.We hypothesized previously that the glutamates in motifs A and C facilitate catalysis by coordinating the essential divalent cation(s) (7Ho C.K. Pei Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34151-34156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The expectation is that an acidic side chain should be critical for metal binding, in which case replacement of a metal-binding glutamate by glutamine should abrogate activity. The effects of conservative substitutions on Cet1p triphosphatase activity point toward Glu-305 and Glu-307 in motif A and Glu-494 and Glu-496 in motif C as prime candidates for the metal-binding site(s), because their replacement by glutamine inactivates Cet1p. Glu-492 is probably not involved in metal binding, insofar as there is substantial residual triphosphatase activity when a glutamine occupies this position. The loss of activity when Glu-492 is replaced by alanine suggests that side chain polarity, with the capacity to hydrogen-bond, is the key property of this position of Cet1p. Note that the poxvirus triphosphatases have only two glutamates in motif C (Fig. 1). Replacement of either glutamate of vaccinia D1 by alanine abolished triphosphatase activity (13Yu L. Martins A. Deng L. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9837-9843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, one or two glutamates in vaccinia motif C may suffice for metal binding, and the role played by the proximal glutamate in Cet1p may be fulfilled by the polar serine in the vaccinia protein (Fig.1).Motif B of Cet1p includes two important basic residues, Arg-454 and Lys-456. The surrounding sequence context is quite hydrophilic (SERTKDR), and we make no presumptions from the available data about the secondary structure of motif B. The mutational data implicate motif B in substrate binding. Changing Arg-454 to alanine or glutamine does not abolish ATP hydrolysis but does result in a 30-fold increase in theK m for ATP. Even a conservative lysine replacement increases the K m for ATP by a factor of 6. We suggest that the arginine side chain makes a bidentate contact with the 5′-triphosphate of the substrate. Arg-454 mutations appear to have a much greater impact on RNA triphosphatase activity than on ATP hydrolysis. Note, however, that the ATPase assays are performed at 1 mm ATP, a concentration 300-fold in excess of theK m for ATP (7Ho C.K. Pei Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34151-34156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), whereas the RNA triphosphatase assays are performed at 2 μm substrate, which is quite close to the K m value of 1 μm for triphosphate-terminated poly(A) (7Ho C.K. Pei Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34151-34156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We suspect that the very low specific RNA triphosphatase activity of the Cet1p mutants with low affinity for ATP can be attributed, at least in part, to similarly reduced affinity for RNA. (The yield of labeled RNA ends in the enzymatic synthesis of triphosphate-terminated poly(A) limits the substrate concentrations attainable in the RNA triphosphatase assay. It would be difficult in practice to conduct the assays at the higher substrate concentrations that are easily attained with ATP.)Replacing motif B Lys-456 by alanine or glutamine increasesK m for ATP by at least an order of magnitude. ATP binding is restored when arginine is introduced at this position. We speculate that Lys-456 makes a monovalent contact with the 5′-triphosphate of the substrate. The K456A and K456Q mutants have very low catalytic activity, even at 1 mm ATP. Thus, Lys-456 may also play a role in catalysis by Cet1p.A Second Yeast RNA Triphosphatase Cth1pWe have shown that yeast Cth1p is both an RNA 5′-triphosphatase and an NTPase. Similar findings were reported by Rodriguez et al. (18Rodriguez C.R. Takagi T. Cho E. Buratowski S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2181-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) while this manuscript was in preparation. We find that the NTPase of Cet1p is activated by manganese and cobalt. This is a property shared with the triphosphatase components of the yeast (Cet1p), vaccinia (D1), and baculovirus (LEF-4) capping enzymes (7Ho C.K. Pei Y. Shuman S. J. Biol.

The turnover number of the Cth1p in ATP hydrolysis (2 s−1) is lower than the values reported for Cet1p (25–33 s−1), baculovirus LEF-4 (30 s−1), and vaccinia virus D1 (10 s−1) (7Ho C.K. Pei Y.

The K m value of Cth1p for ATP (75 μm) is higher than that of either Cet1p (2.8 μm) or LEF-4 (43 μm) but lower than that of vaccinia capping enzyme (800 μm) (7Ho C.K. Pei Y. Shuman S. J. Biol.

The function of Cth1 in vivo is unknown; this enzyme may well catalyze phosphohydrolase reactions unrelated to mRNA capping. Indeed, it is not even clear that RNA 5′ ends are the relevant substrates for Cth1p action in vivo. Nonetheless, we have shown that Cth1p can act as an RNA triphosphatase in the cap synthetic pathway in vivo, provided that it is fused in cisto mammalian guanylyltransferase.Targeting Enzymes to Pre-mRNAs in VivoTargeting of the cellular capping apparatus to nascent RNA polymerase II transcripts is achieved via the binding of one or more components of the capping enzymes to the phosphorylated C-terminal domain (CTD) of elongating RNA polymerase II (20Yue Z.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3319-3326Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The CTD, consisting of tandem repeats of a heptapeptide of the consensus sequence YSPTSPS, is extensively phosphorylated in the context of the transcription elongation complex (24Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19009-19012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The guanylyltransferase domain of mammalian capping enzyme Mce1p binds specifically to the phosphorylated CTD, but not to unmodified CTD (15Ho C.K. Sriskanda V. McCracken S. Bentley D. Schwer B.

The triphosphatase domain of mammalian capping enzyme does not bind the CTD, but is normally brought along via its linkage incis to the guanylyltransferase. In yeast, the guanylyltransferase Ceg1p binds to CTD-PO4, whereas the triphosphatase Cet1p does not (5Cho E. Rodriguez C.R. Takagi T. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3482-3487Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 21McCracken S. Fong N. Rosonina E. Yankulov K. Brothers G. Siderovski D. Hessel A. Foster S. Shuman S. Bentley D.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3306-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Formation of a Cet1p-Ceg1p complex intrans allows the yeast guanylyltransferase to chaperone the triphosphatase to the transcription complex. We showed previously that mammalian guanylyltransferase can act as chaperone in cisfor a catalytic domain of yeast triphosphatase Cet1p that lacks the ability to bind to Ceg1p (6Lehman K. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Rouzankina I. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22668-22678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Now, we find that mammalian guanylyltransferase can target Cth1p, an RNA triphosphatase not normally involved in capping, and thereby convert it into a cap-forming enzyme in vivo. This result suggests that the mammalian guanylyltransferase can be used as a vehicle to transiently deliver heterologous proteins to the RNA polymerase II transcription elongation complex in vivo. Such a vehicle may prove useful in designing strategies to alter the structural or functional properties of the elongating polymerase or the nascent RNA and thereby modulate gene expression. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA 5′-triphosphatase Cet1p is an essential enzyme that catalyzes the first step of mRNA cap formation, the hydrolysis of the γ-phosphate of triphosphate-terminated pre-mRNA to form a diphosphate end that then serves as the substrate for capping by the yeast RNA guanylyltransferase Ceg1p (1Tsukamoto T.

Expansion of the alanine scan defined two other residues required for Cet1p function (Phe-310 and Lys-456), as well as three residues (Leu-306, Val-493, and Leu-495) at which side chain removal results in thermal instability of Cet1p in vivo and in vitro. In addition, we ask whether the presence of motifs A, B, and C in a gene product of unknown function has predictive value with respect to the biochemical properties of that gene product.

Here we report for the first time the presence of hemocyanins in the diplopod Myriapoda, demonstrating that these proteins are more widespread among the Arthropoda than previously thought. The hemocyanin ofSpirostreptus sp. (Diplopoda: Spirostreptidae) is composed of two immunologically distinct subunits in the 75-kDa range that are most likely arranged in a 36-mer (6 × 6) native molecule. It has a high oxygen affinity (P 50 = 4.7 torr) but low cooperativity (h = 1.3 ± 0.2).Spirostreptus hemocyanin is structurally similar to the single known hemocyanin from the myriapod taxon, Scutigera coleoptrata (Chilopoda), indicating a rather conservative architecture of the myriapod hemocyanins.

Biol. Bull. ( Woods Hole ). 1986; 171: 90-115Crossref Google Scholar,2van Holde K.E. Miller K.I. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 1-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The principal structure of a hexamer of six similar or identical subunits in the 75-kDa range is conserved within all arthropod hemocyanins, although in many cases these hexamers associate to quaternary structures containing up to 8 × 6 subunits (3Markl J. Decker H. Adv. Comp. Environ. Physiol. 1992; 13: 325-376Crossref Google Scholar). Each subunit carries one oxygen molecule by the virtue of two copper ions that are coordinated by six histidine residues (4Linzen B. Soeter N.M. Riggs A.F. Schneider H.J. Schartau W.

Hemocyanins are members of a functionally and structurally diverse protein superfamily that includes arthropod tyrosinases (prophenoloxidases), crustacean nonrespiratory pseudo-hemocyanins (cryptocyanins), insect hexamerins, and dipteran hexamerin receptors (5Beintema J.J.

Hemocyanins had long been unknown among the Myriapoda (classes: Chilopoda, Diplopoda, Symphyla, and Pauropoda), whereas these proteins have been studied in detail in many different chelicerate and crustacean species. Respiratory proteins were considered unnecessary in the Myriapoda because these animals possess, similar to the insects, a well developed tracheal system (11Brusca R.C. Brusca G.J. Invertebrates. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA1990Google Scholar). However, several years ago Mangumet al. (12Mangum C.P. Scott J.L. Black R.E.L. Miller K.I. van Holde K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3721-3725Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) demonstrated the existence of a true, 36-mer hemocyanin in the hemolymph of the common house centipedeScutigera coleoptrata. The exceptional presence of a hemocyanin in the scutigeramorph Chilopoda has been attributed to the high activity and peculiar tracheal system of these species rather than representing a general feature of the Myriapoda (13Mangum C.P. Godette G. Linzen B. Invertebrate Oxygen Carriers. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1986: 276-280Google Scholar). However, here we show that high amounts of hemocyanins are also present in the Diplopoda, indicating that these respiratory proteins are more widespread among the Myriapoda than previously thought. Living male and female specimens of three diplopod species from the family of Spirostreptidae (two different species of the genus Spirostreptus, named “A” and “B” here,Telodeinopus aoutii) were obtained from the Aquazoo in Düsseldorf (Germany). The hemolymph was withdrawn from the dorsal intersegmental regions with a syringe, immediately diluted in one volume of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g to remove hemocytes and tissue contamination. Purified hemolymph was stored at 4 °C or frozen at −20 °C. Protein concentrations were determined according to the method of Bradford (14Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). About 30 μl (∼1.5–2 mg of total protein) of freshly collected hemolymph ofSpirostreptus B were applied to a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mm CaCl2 at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Proteins were detected in a flow cell at 280 nm. The molecular masses of the fractions were estimated after calibration with native hemocyanin molecules with known sizes: Limulus polyphemus (48-mer, 3600 kDa), Eurypelma californicum (24-mer, 1800 kDa),Astacus leptodactylus (12-mer, 900 kDa), and Panulirus interruptus (6-mer, 450 kDa). Electron microscopic analysis of the hemolymph samples was performed by negative staining with uranyl-acetate (15Harris J.R. Agutter P.S. J. Ultrastruc. Res. 1970; 33: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). UV-visible spectra were recorded on a Hitachi U-3000 spectrometer. Oxygen-binding curves at pH 7.5 in 100 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mm CaCl2 were obtained using the polarographic-fluorometric method described by Loewe (16Loewe R. J. Comp. Physiol. B Biochem. Syst. Environ. Physiol. 1978; 128: 161-168Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). About 400 μg of purified Spirostreptus B hemocyanin were used to raise polyclonal antibodies in a guinea pig. Crossed immunoelectrophoresis was carried out according to Weeke (17Weeke B. Scand. J. Immunol. 1973; 2 Suppl. 1: 47-56Crossref Scopus (493) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE1 was performed on a 7.5% gel (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose at 0.8 mA/cm2. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 0.25% Tween 20). Incubation with different anti-hemocyanin antisera in 5% nonfat dry milk/TBST was carried out for 2 h at room temperature. The filters were washed three times for 20 min in TBST, incubated for 1 h with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase, and diluted in 5% nonfat dry milk/TBST. The membranes were washed as above and the detection was carried out using nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. The hemolymph of male and female adult specimens of three juliform Diplopoda from the family of Spirostreptidae (SpirostreptusA and B, T. aoutii) was investigated for the presence of hemocyanin-like proteins. In all species, prominent polypeptides with apparent molecular masses between 70 and 85 kDa were observed in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 A), which is in the expected range of arthropod hemocyanin subunits. In all three species, electron microscopic investigations of the hemolymph revealed the presence of protein particles that resemble the unique appearance of 6 × 6 S. coleoptrata hemocyanin (12Mangum C.P. Scott J.L. Black R.E.L. Miller K.I. van Holde K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3721-3725Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 19Boisset N. Taveau J.-C. Lamy J.-N. Biol. Cell. 1990; 86: 73-84Google Scholar). This was the first indication that hemocyanin-like proteins may be present in the Diplopoda. In Fig. 1 B, an electron micrograph of the hemolymph of Spirostreptus species B is displayed. This species was chosen for further investigations because of the large size of the adult animals (about a 10–15-cm body length, 1-cm diameter) and the high content of putative hemocyanin molecules in the hemolymph (about 40–50 mg/ml). Size-exclusion gel chromatography on a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column yields three peaks of about 2400, 1250, and 390 kDa (Fig.2 A). The first two peaks (P1 and P2) both contain two polypeptides of about 75 kDa, whereas the third peak consists of four other proteins between 85 and 200 kDa (Fig. 2 B). Electron-microscopic investigations show no differences between the proteins of peak one and two with particles resembling the putative hemocyanin observed in the raw hemolymph samples, but also particles that probably correspond to monohexamers (not shown). The third peak does not contain any hemocyanin-like structures. Assuming a mean molecular mass of about 75 kDa/subunit (as revealed by SDS-PAGE), the first peak indicates a protein consisting of more than 30 subunits. Because arthropod hemocyanins only elute as multimers of six subunits and considering the similarities to Scutigera hemocyanin, a 36-mer (6 × 6) molecule is the most probable structure of Spirostreptushemocyanin. This assumption is also consistent with the appearance of this molecule in the electron microscopic images. The estimated molecular mass of the second peak (P2) is about half of the first, suggesting a stable 18-mer dissociation product (3 × 6). Column-purified hemocyanin was used to raise specific antibodies in guinea pigs (Charles River, Germany). Then the hemocyanin was dissociated into subunits by dialysis against 0.13 mglycine/NaOH buffer for 2 days at pH 9.6 and applied to crossed immunoelectrophoresis (17Weeke B. Scand. J. Immunol. 1973; 2 Suppl. 1: 47-56Crossref Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Although the dissociation of the hemocyanin was incomplete even after prolonged incubation at a high pH, we observed several precipitation lines, indicating the presence of at least two immunologically distinct polypeptides in the hemocyanin sample (Fig. 2 C). In spectroscopic analysis, Spirostreptus hemocyanin shows a peak at 336 nm, which is typical for oxygenated hemocyanins and reflects the formation of the copper-oxygen complex (Fig.3 A). However, as already observed in the centipede S. coleoptrata, theA 340/A 280 ratio is much lower than in the other arthropod hemocyanins. This may be explained in part by its high extinction coefficient at 280 nm (1 mg/ml corresponds to 1.8–2 OD), which indicates a highly aromatic protein. The oxygen affinity of Spirostreptus hemocyanin was measured in Tris buffer at pH 7.4 according to Loewe (16Loewe R. J. Comp. Physiol. B Biochem. Syst. Environ. Physiol. 1978; 128: 161-168Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and yields aP 50 of 4.7 torr (Fig. 3 B). A low cooperativity (Hill coefficient, h = 1.3 ± 0.2) was detected. The hemolymph of Spirostreptus has an extraordinarily high protein content up to 100 mg/ml. We estimated that hemocyanin represents about 40–50% of the total hemolymph proteins (Figs. 1 and 2), indicating a hemocyanin content up to 50 mg/ml. Because every subunit of about 75 kDa can carry one oxygen molecule, an oxygen transport capacity of about 20 ml/liter hemolymph was calculated. This value is comparable with those of other Arthropoda. Several specific antibodies directed against hemocyanins of Crustacea and Chelicerata have been described in the literature; in this study, five different rabbit antibodies have been tested for cross-reaction with the Spirostreptushemocyanin by Western blotting (Fig. 4). Two of the antisera were raised against chelicerate hemocyanins (E. californicum and Androctonus australis), and three were raised against hemocyanins of malacostracan Crustacea (A. leptodactylus, Carcinus maenas, andHomarus americanus). About 2.5 μg of total hemolymph proteins from Spirostreptus species B were applied/lane; the different anti-hemocyanin antibodies were used in 1:5000 to 1:10,000 dilutions. Signals in the 75-kDa range were observed in all cases, although most of the antibodies cross-react differentially with the two hemocyanin polypeptides. This is consistent with the assumption that they correspond to immunologically distinct hemocyanin subunits (see also Fig. 2 C). None of the other proteins in theSpirostreptus hemolymph were detected by the anti-hemocyanin antibodies, demonstrating the specificity of the immunological relationship. The hemocyanins of Arthropoda have been the subject of detailed functional, structural, and evolutionary studies mainly in the Chelicerata and Crustacea (1Markl J. Biol. Bull. ( Woods Hole ). 1986; 171: 90-115Crossref Google Scholar, 2van Holde K.E. Miller K.I. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 1-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Markl J. Decker H. Adv. Comp. Environ.

Evol. 1994; 11: 493-503PubMed Google Scholar). This paper is the first report of the presence of hemocyanins in the diplopod Myriapoda. All three investigated species belong to the Spirostreptidae, a large family of mainly Afrotropical and Neotropical juliform Diplopoda. The hemocyanin of Spirostreptus sp. displays the typical arthropod hemocyanin features in terms of subunit size, structural appearance, and spectroscopic properties. Moreover, it shares similar antigenic determinants with crustacean and chelicerate hemocyanins. Therefore, the identity of the O2-binding protein ofSpirostreptus as a genuine hemocyanin should be considered as conclusive. The presence of a typical hemocyanin in the Diplopoda is rather surprising. This protein appears to be structurally very similar to the hemocyanin from the centipede, S. coleoptrata (12Mangum C.P. Scott J.L. Black R.E.L. Miller K.I. van Holde K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3721-3725Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 13Mangum C.P. Godette G. Linzen B. Invertebrate Oxygen Carriers. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1986: 276-280Google Scholar, 20Gebauer W. Markl J. Naturwissenschaften. 1999; (in press): 86Google Scholar). In this species, the presence of an oxygen-carrying hemocyanin was considered as an exception related to the peculiar blind-ending tracheal system in the Scutigeramorpha (13Mangum C.P. Godette G. Linzen B. Invertebrate Oxygen Carriers. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1986: 276-280Google Scholar). In contrast, although the tracheal system of the Spirostreptidae is normal and similar to those of the other Diplopoda, a high hemocyanin concentration was observed in most specimens. Therefore, the evolution of trachea is not necessarily accompanied by a loss of specific respiratory proteins. This suggests that hemocyanins may be found in other Myriapoda as well and that these proteins are more widespread among the Arthropoda than previously thought. Chilopod and diplopod Myriapoda probably diverged in the Devonian or an earlier period (21Shear W.A. Fortey R.A. Thomas R.H. Arthropod Relationships. Chapman and Hall, London1997: 211-219Google Scholar). However, whereas the subunit arrangement within the chelicerate and crustacean hemocyanins is variable, ranging from 1 × 6 to 8 × 6 subunits in the native molecule, the unique 6 × 6 organization of subunits appears to be a conservative feature of the Myriapoda that has been conserved for at least 400 million years. Nevertheless, the oxygen-binding properties of the hemocyanins from Scutigera and from Spirostreptusare strikingly different. Whereas Spirostreptus hemocyanin has a high oxygen affinity (P 50 = 4.7 torr at pH 7.5) and a low cooperativity (h = 1.3 ± 0.2), the situation is reversed in Scutigera hemocyanin, which has a low oxygen affinity (P 50 = 55 torr at pH 7.5) and high cooperativity (h = 8.9 at pH 7.5) (12Mangum C.P. Scott J.L. Black R.E.L. Miller K.I. van Holde K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3721-3725Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The high oxygen affinity of Spirostreptus hemocyanin may be related to the low oxygen conditions of the subterrestical environment, where these species remain most of the time during daylight hours. Recent molecular phylogenetic studies (22Turbeville J.M. Pfeifer D.M. Field K.G. Raff R.A. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1991; 8: 669-686PubMed Google Scholar, 23Friedrich M. Tautz D. Nature. 1995; 376: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) shed doubt on the monophyly of the taxon “Tracheata” or “Antennata,” which combines the Myriapoda with the Hexapoda (11Brusca R.C. Brusca G.J. Invertebrates. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA1990Google Scholar). Although there is increasing evidence for a sister group relationship of the Hexapoda and Crustacea (23Friedrich M. Tautz D. Nature. 1995; 376: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 24Boore J.L. Lavrov D.V. Brown W.M. Nature. 1998; 392: 667-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar), the actual systematic position of the Myriapoda became uncertain. Although we observed cross-reactivity of theSpirostreptus hemocyanin with antibodies that have been raised against either chelicerate or crustacean hemocyanins (Fig. 4), such data are not sufficient to determine the exact evolutionary relationships among the arthropods. However, at least some antigenic structures have been conserved among myriapod, crustacean, and chelicerate hemocyanins because of their divergence in the Cambrian period more than 520 million years ago. As already mentioned by Mangumet al. (12Mangum C.P. Scott J.L. Black R.E.L. Miller K.I. van Holde K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3721-3725Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the presence of hemocyanins (and related proteins, e.g. hexamerins) is an autapomorphic character of the Arthropoda, providing strong evidence in favor for a monophyletic origin of this phylum. These proteins have also been successfully used to investigate arthropod relationships (5Beintema J.J. Stam W.T. Hazes B. Smidt M.P. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1994; 11: 493-503PubMed Google Scholar, 6Burmester T. Scheller K. J. Mol. Evol. 1996; 42: 713-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 7Burmester T. Massey H.C. Zakharkin S.O. Benes H. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 47: 93-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Hence, the determination of the cDNA sequence of Spirostreptus hemocyanin will not only provide insights in a complete new class of hemocyanins but will probably also allow the elucidation of the phylogenetic affinities of the Myriapoda.

Soon after the discovery of the first member of the family (10Bamburg J.R. Harris H.E. Weeds A.G. FEBS Lett. 1980; 121: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), several authors suggested that depolymerization occurred through severing (9Nishida E. Maekawa S. Sakai H. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5307-5313Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 18Cooper J.A. Blum J.D. Williamson Jr., R.C. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 477-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence for a severing mechanism later came from videomicroscopy (19Maciver S.K. Zot H.G. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1611-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 20Hawkins M. Pope B. Maciver S.K. Weeds A.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9985-9993Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), but this was later challenged (6Carlier M.-F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry D. Xia G.-X. Hong Y. Chua N.-H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar) as it was shown (6Carlier M.-F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry D. Xia G.-X. Hong Y. Chua N.-H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 21Maciver S.K. Pope B.J. Whytock S. Weeds A.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) that cofilins increased the off-rate from the pointed end of the filament. However, the two opinions are not necessarily exclusive (22Theriot J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1165-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 23Maciver S.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 24Blanchoin L. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25106-25111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and a similar mechanism has been proposed for both events (23Maciver S.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We report the identification of a cofilin-actin interface that is compatible with the observation that cofilin increases the twist in the actin filament (25McGough A. Pope B. Chiu W. Weeds A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar) but does not fit the model presented by these authors. We propose that some of the density attributed to cofilin (25McGough A. Pope B. Chiu W. Weeds A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar) is actually the bulk of subdomain 2 of actin pushed forward by cofilin. Cofilin lies behind subdomain 2 of one monomer and in front of subdomain 1 of the longitudinally associated monomer, immediately toward the pointed end of the filament.Our model may also be applicable to the many other ABPs that contain regions homologous to cofilins that bind to actin (reviewed in Ref. 26Lappalainen P. Kessels M.M. Cope J.T.V. Drubin D.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1951-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and to the gelsolin-villin family of ABPs because the gelsolin fold (27McLaughlin P.J. Gooch J.T. Mannherz H.G. Weeds A.G. Nature. 1993; 364: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 28Burtnick L.D. Koepf E.K. Grimes J. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. McLaughlin P.J. Robinson R.C. Cell. 1997; 90: 661-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) is similar to that of the ADF-cofilin fold (29Hatanaka H. Ogura K. Moriyama K. Ichikawa S. Yahara I. Inagiki F. Cell. 1996; 85: 1047-1055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONADF-cofilins are remarkable in that they alter the filament twist of F-actin (25McGough A. Pope B. Chiu W. Weeds A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Nishida et al. (9Nishida E. Maekawa S. Sakai H. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5307-5313Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) had commented that the structure of cofilin-bound filaments was possibly different from that of F-actin alone and noted that the spectra of cofilin-decorated, pyrene-labeled F-actin was similar to that of G-actin. Our model (Fig.9) explains this. The presence of cofilin pushes the DNase 1 loop from one actin monomer away from the C terminus of the monomer below thus removing that environment afforded by the DNase 1 loop that causes the large change in pyrene fluorescence normally associated with actin polymerization (53Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). The model proposes that cofilin makes contact with two longitudinally associated actin monomers within the filament, through two sites on cofilin (site 1 and site 2). Site 1 is centered on the N terminus and Lys112and Lys114 (human ADF and cofilin) at the start of the third helix (α3) and makes contact with the lower part of actin's subdomain 1. Site 2 is centered on the last helix of cofilin (α4), which we propose makes contact with the 112–125 helix of actin identified as a cofilin binding site in this study. Whereas the region 112–125 is α-helical in the parent actin molecule (27McLaughlin P.J. Gooch J.T. Mannherz H.G. Weeds A.G. Nature. 1993; 364: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 52Kabsch W. Mannherz H.G. Suck D. Pai E.F. Holmes K.C. Nature. 1990; 347: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar), we have found that this peptide in solution is in a predominantly non-helical state (Fig. 5). It is known that the helical conformation can be selectively stabilized in the presence of TFE, and we have shown by this agent that 112–125 maintains a propensity to adopt an α-helical conformation in solution. Cofilin binds this peptide, but we do not know if in doing so cofilin stabilizes the α-helical state or induces the α-helical state prior to binding. However, in previous work we demonstrated that the binding of the unfolded peptide, thymosin β4, was enhanced in the presence of TFE (54Feinberg J. Heitz F. Benyamin Y. Roustan C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This model is quite different from that suggested by McGough et al. (25McGough A. Pope B. Chiu W. Weeds A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar), who placed cofilin “in front” of subdomain 2 of actin in the standard orientation. It is difficult to imagine how such an orientation could result in the change in twist of the actin filament observed, rather this orientation may be expected to alter the twist in the opposite direction. Our model, in which cofilin opens up the interface between the longitudinally associated actin subunits by intercalating between them (Fig. 9), produces the change in filament twist by increasing the angle of rotation between each longitudinally associated actin. The high degree of cooperation evident in the binding of ADF-cofilins to F-actin (20Hawkins M. Pope B. Maciver S.K. Weeds A.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9985-9993Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 21Maciver S.K. Pope B.J. Whytock S. Weeds A.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 25McGough A. Pope B. Chiu W. Weeds A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar) has been explained by the changed twist they induce in the filament (25McGough A. Pope B. Chiu W. Weeds A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). We propose that in opening up a space between two subunits at one side of the filament, this also places a strain on the opposite longitudinally associated pair of actin subunits across (and along) the filament, allowing another cofilin to bind along the axis of the filament. McGough et al. (25McGough A. Pope B. Chiu W. Weeds A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar) have suggested that histidines 40, 87, 88, and 101 on the actin surface may contribute to the pH sensitivity of the ADF-cofilins. Our model also suggests that these histidines are likely to be close to the interface between ADF-cofilin and the actin subunits. However, the actin structure in part of this region is disordered (27McLaughlin P.J. Gooch J.T. Mannherz H.G. Weeds A.G. Nature. 1993; 364: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar) or constricted (52Kabsch W. Mannherz H.G. Suck D. Pai E.F. Holmes K.C. Nature. 1990; 347: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar) in the available actin structures, making predictions premature.The cofilin-actin interface has been investigated by a number of methods including chemical cross-linking (19Maciver S.K.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5520-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The consensus of these studies is that subdomain 1 of actin is the principal actin-binding interface that binds the long helix of the ADF-cofilin. However, this remains a contentious area, especially on this second point.Chemical cross-linking studies indicate that the N and C termini of actin interact with depactin (55Sutoh K. Mabuchi I. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6757-6761Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and that the N terminus of depactin contains an actin binding site (56Sutoh K. Mabuchi I. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Subdomain 1 of actin was also implicated in the binding of Acanthamoeba actophorin to G-actin as actophorin competes for cross-linking (19Maciver S.K. Zot H.G. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1611-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and binding (24Blanchoin L. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25106-25111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) with profilin. Profilin is known to be cross-linked to glutamic acid 364 of actin (48Vanderkerckhove J.S. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Cofilin can be cross-linked to residues 1–12 on actin (58Giuliano K.A. Khatib F.A. Hayden S.M. Daoud E.W.R. Adams M.E. Amorese D.A. Bernstein B.W. Bamburg J.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8931-8938Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and ADF can be cross-linked to cysteine 374 on actin (58Giuliano K.A. Khatib F.A. Hayden S.M. Daoud E.W.R. Adams M.E. Amorese D.A. Bernstein B.W. Bamburg J.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8931-8938Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Also many have found that various fluorescent labels on cysteine 374 are quenched by ADF-cofilin binding (6Carlier M.-F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry D. Xia G.-X. Hong Y. Chua N.-H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 9Nishida E. Maekawa S. Sakai H.

Biochemistry. 1993; 290: 411-417Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar).The position of the actin binding site of ADF-cofilins on actin gained by competition with other ABPs and reagents has produced some contrary evidence. It is known that ADF-cofilin binding is inhibited by phalloidin (6Carlier M.-F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry D. Xia G.-X. Hong Y. Chua N.-H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 19Maciver S.K. Zot H.G. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1611-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 60Yonezawa N. Nishida E. Maekawa S. Sakai H. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Tropomyosin is known to compete with ADF for F-actin binding (9Nishida E. Maekawa S. Sakai H. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5307-5313Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 60Yonezawa N. Nishida E. Maekawa S. Sakai H. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate therefore that the tropomyosin and ADF binding sites overlap to some extent; however, it is known that the tropomyosin site is some distance from those of ADF-cofilins (reviewed in Ref. 67Sheterline P. Clayton J. Sparrow J. Prot. Profile. 1995; 2: 58-59Google Scholar). Tropomyosin increases the regularity of the helical twist in actin (68Stokes D.L. DeRosier D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1005-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) but does not vary it as ADF-cofilin does (25McGough A. Pope B. Chiu W. Weeds A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). It is likely that the twist induced by ADF is not compatible with binding by tropomyosin at its distant site, explaining the apparent competition for binding. The same explanation is very likely for phalloidin. Phalloidin binds F-actin extremely tightly, yet ADF-cofilin competes for binding (60Yonezawa N. Nishida E. Maekawa S. Sakai H. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Myosin, which binds to the subdomain 1, including fragment 96–132 on actin (50Labbe J.P. Boyer M. Méjean C. Roustan C. Benyamin Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), competes for actin binding with ADF-cofilin (9Nishida E. Maekawa S. Sakai H. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5307-5313Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), in agreement with our model. The so called “headpiece” of villin also competes with ADF for binding to actin (61Pope B. Way M. Matsudaira P.T. Weeds A.G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), but only partial and weak competition was evident between α-actinin and cofilin (60Yonezawa N. Nishida E. Maekawa S. Sakai H. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).The structures of three cofilins, ADF (29Hatanaka H. Ogura K. Moriyama K. Ichikawa S. Yahara I. Inagiki F. Cell. 1996; 85: 1047-1055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), yeast cofilin (69Fedorov A. Lappalainen P. Fedorov E.V. Drubin D.G. Almo S.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and actophorin (70Leonard S. Gittis A. Petrella E. Pollard T. Lattman E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), have been determined. Interestingly, cofilins have an overall fold similar to the gelsolin segment 1 (G1) (27McLaughlin P.J. Gooch J.T. Mannherz H.G. Weeds A.G. Nature. 1993; 364: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), leading some others (29Hatanaka H. Ogura K. Moriyama K. Ichikawa S. Yahara I. Inagiki F. Cell. 1996; 85: 1047-1055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 63Wriggers W. Tang J.X. Azuma T. Marks P.W. Janmey P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 921-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) to suggest that ADF-cofilin binds actin in a similar manner as G1. Gelsolin is a calcium-sensitive actin-binding, severing, and nucleating protein that is composed of six similar domains (G1–6) (71Weeds A. Maciver S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Although the six domains are similar in both sequence and structure (28Burtnick L.D. Koepf E.K. Grimes J. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. McLaughlin P.J. Robinson R.C. Cell. 1997; 90: 661-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), it is known that whereas G1 and G4 bind a similar site on actin (72Pope B. Way M. Weeds A.G. FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 73Pope B. Maciver S. Weeds A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1583-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), G2 binds F-actin alone. G2 is thought to bind actin in the region of the outer surfaces of subdomains 1 and 2 (62Van Troys M. Dewitte D. Verschelde J.-L. Goethals M. Vanderkerckhove J. Ampe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32750-32758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In support of this contention, G2–3 competes with cofilin for actin binding (62Van Troys M. Dewitte D. Verschelde J.-L. Goethals M. Vanderkerckhove J. Ampe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32750-32758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), however it is also known that G1 also competes with cofilin for actin binding (63Wriggers W. Tang J.X. Azuma T. Marks P.W. Janmey P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 921-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These apparently disparate findings are compatible with our model (Fig. 9). Stable F-actin binding can only take place at low pH values where cofilin binds actin monomers within the filament via site 1 and site 2. These sites are also shared by G1 and G2, respectively.A very comprehensive mutagenesis study (65Lappalainen P. Fedorov E.V. Fedorov A.A. Almo S.C Drubin D.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5520-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) in which the actin interface was systematically explored concluded that cofilin did not bind in a similar manner to G1 but that there were two actin binding sites. One site comprised Arg96 and Lys98, Asp123 and Glu126, and M1 to G5, whereas the other comprised Arg80 and Lys82 and Glu134 to Arg138. These authors suggested that one of these sites bound one actin monomer within a filament, whereas the second site bound a second actin monomer. Another mutagenic study (64Jiang C.-J. Weeds A.G. Khan S. Hussey P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9973-9978Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) suggests the importance of the “long helix” (α3) stability in binding F-actin, but not G-actin.The actin-cofilin interface will be further understood when structural data, either from NMR or more likely, because of the molecular sizes involved, crystallography, of a complex between cofilin and actin is available. This will not be an easy task, because the interaction between the two proteins is not very strong. Ultimately, of course, we would wish to have high-resolution structures for the actin filament with and without bound cofilin. Nevertheless, our present study has provided additional firm experimental evidence for the two-sited interaction between actin and cofilin, and it will be valuable for the interpretation of any further atomic structure of their complexes. Many motile processes in cells require cyclic polymerization and depolymerization of actin filaments. In cell locomotion for example, actin is polymerized at the leading edge of the cell and is recycled by depolymerizing toward the cell center. The rate constants of pure actin have been established (1Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2747-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar), and it is clear that a discrepancy exists between these known rates and those calculated from filament turnover in cells (2Theriot J.A. Mitchison T.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 219-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A host of actin-binding proteins are known that dramatically alter the behavior of actin in vitro, and of these, the cofilins have been suggested to have the correct properties to increase filament turnover in cells (3Maciver S.K. Weeds A.G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This view has been confirmed by studies with living Saccharomyces (4Lappalainen P. Drubin D.G. Nature. 1997; 388: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) andDictyostelium (5Aizawa H. Sutoh K. Yahara I. J.

In the marine mollusk Aplysia, persistent activation of the calcium-activated PKC Apl I occurs during long term facilitation. We have raised an antibody to a peptide from PKC Apl I phosphorylated at threonines 613 and 620 (sites homologous to threonines 634 and 641). This antibody recognizes PKC Apl I only when it is phosphorylated at threonine 613. Both phorbol esters and serotonin increase the percentage of kinase phosphorylated at threonine 613 inAplysia neurons. Furthermore, the pool of PKC that is phosphorylated at threonine 613 in neurons is resistant to both membrane translocation and down-regulation. Replacement of threonine 613 with alanine increased the affinity of PKC Apl I for calcium, suggesting that phosphorylation of this site may reduce the ability of PKC Apl I to translocate to membranes in the presence of calcium. We propose that phosphorylation of this site is important for removal of PKC from the membrane and may be a mechanism for negative feedback of PKC activation.

Classical isoforms of PKC are activated by a combination of two second messengers, calcium and diacylglycerol. Calcium increases the affinity of the enzyme for lipids through its interaction with the C2 domain, and diacylglycerol induces a high affinity interaction with the membrane that leads to enzyme activation (1Newton A.C.

Autophosphorylation at threonine 641 (PKC βII) is required for formation of active PKC (6Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr.

Interestingly, mutations at serine 660 also affect the affinity of the enzyme for calcium, suggesting that in the intact kinase interactions occur between the C2 domain and the carboxyl terminus (12Edwards A.S. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18382-18390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). A number of other autophosphorylation sites have been identified after activation of PKCs by phorbol esters (13Flint A.J. Paladini R.D. Koshland D.J. Science. 1990; 249: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), but these sites are not important for PKC activity (8Zhang J. Wang L. Schwartz J. Bond R.W. Bishop W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19578-19584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Zhang J. Wang L. Petrin J. Bishop W.R. Bond R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6130-6134Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, one of these sites, threonine 634 in PKC βII, is conserved over evolution. Furthermore, phosphorylation at threonine 634 and threonine 641 increases after long term potentiation or after associative learning in rodents (15Atkins C.M. Selcher J.C. Petraitis J.J. Trzaskos J.M. Sweatt J.D. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar, 16Sweatt J.D. Atkins C.M. Johnson J. English J.D. Roberson E.D. Chen S.J. Newton A. Klann E. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1075-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for phosphorylation at these sites in regulation of PKC in the nervous system. In the marine mollusk Aplysia californica, only two phorbol ester-activated isoforms of PKC exist, PKC Apl I and PKC Apl II (17Sossin W.S. Diaz-Arrista R. Schwartz J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5763-5768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKC Apl I is a classical PKC that contains a C2 domain that is regulated by calcium, while PKC Apl II contains an amino-terminal C2 domain that is homologous to those of PKCε and PKCη and not regulated by calcium (18Pepio A.M. Fan X. Sossin W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19040-19048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The major autophosphorylation sites in vertebrate PKCs are conserved in the Aplysia isoforms, as is the site at threonine 634 (Fig. 1). PKC is persistently activated during the formation of long term synaptic changes in both vertebrates and invertebrates (19Grunbaum L. Muller U. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4384-4392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Klann E. Chen S.J. Sweatt J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24253-24256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Sossin W.S.

In both model systems, an autonomous form of PKC is formed that may be important for the maintenance of synaptic changes at intermediate times (19Grunbaum L. Muller U. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4384-4392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Klann E. Chen S.J. Sweatt J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24253-24256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Sossin W.S. Learn. Mem. 1997; 3: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The autonomous form of PKC in vertebrates has been suggested to be due to phosphorylation of a classical isoform or the formation of protein kinase M from the atypical ζ form (25Klann E. Chen S.J. Sweatt J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8337-8341Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 26Sacktor T.C. Osten P. Valsamis H. Jiang X. Naik M.U. Sublette E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8342-8346Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In contrast, the autonomous PKC in Aplysia is generated by a modification in the regulatory domain of the novel PKC Apl II (24Sossin W.S. Learn. Mem. 1997; 3: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Translocation of PKC Apl I to the membrane and the amount of activable PKC Apl I in the membrane also increase at this time, demonstrating that PKC Apl I is persistently activated during this period although not constitutively active (21Sossin W.S. Sacktor T.C. Schwartz J.H. Learn. Mem. 1994; 1: 189-202PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if phosphorylation of PKC Apl I at the equivalent positions of threonine 634 and threonine 641 (threonine 613 and threonine 620) is involved in the persistent activation of PKC Apl I, we raised a phosphopeptide antibody to this site. This antibody only recognized PKC Apl I when phosphorylated at threonine 613. We found that this site is phosphorylated in neurons and that the percentage of kinase phosphorylated at this site increased after phorbol ester and serotonin treatment. Interestingly, PKC Apl I phosphorylated at this site was found in the cytoplasmic fraction to a greater extent, and was more resistant to down-regulation, than the bulk of PKC. These results suggest that phosphorylation of this site is involved in removing PKC from the membrane. A 17-amino acid carboxyl-terminal peptide, containing residues 606–623 ofAplysia PKC Apl I with threonine 613 and threonine 620 converted to phosphothreonine (pT), was synthesized (FDREFpTSEAPNVTpTPTD; Fig. 1) at the Baylor College of Medicine protein chemistry core facility, conjugated to maleimide-coupled bovine serum albumin (Pierce), and injected into rabbits using the adjuvant TitreMax Gold (Cedar Lane) three times at 4-week intervals. In order to reduce the fraction of antibody that might recognize the nonphosphorylated peptide, the serum from animals was passed three times over an affinity column of the nonphosphorylated form of the immunizing phosphopeptide (synthesized at Sheldon Biotechnology Center, McGill University) coupled to SulfoLink (Pierce). After each passage, specifically retained antibodies were eluted from the column. The final flow-through was then passed over an affinity column of the immunizing peptide coupled to SulfoLink, and retained antibodies were eluted and concentrated in a Centriplus-10 (Amicon). Western blots were performed as described (27Dyer J.R. Sossin W.S. Klein M. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 932-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) with the PKC Apl I-specific antibody at 0.2–1 μg/ml dilution (17Sossin W.S. Diaz-Arrista R. Schwartz J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5763-5768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the antibody to the phosphorylated peptide (anti-Apl I-P) at 0.5 μg/ml, and goat anti-rabbit, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at 1 μg/ml. For immunoblots with the phosphopeptide-specific antibody, nonphosphorylated peptide at 5 μg/μl was incubated with equal volumes of the primary antibody for 25 min prior to its centrifugation at 10,000 × gfor 5 min and its addition to the blot. Results were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Renaissance Plus, NEN Life Science Products). Immunoblots were scanned, and analysis was performed using the public domain NIH Image program (developed at the National Institutes of Health and available on the Internet). We calibrated our data with the uncalibrated OD feature of NIH Image, which transforms the data using the formula y = log10(255/(255 − x), where x is the pixel value (0–254). Control experiments demonstrated that after this calibration, values were linear with respect to the amount of protein over a wide range of values (28Nakhost A. Forscher P. Sossin W.S. J Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1221-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Single amino acid mutations were generated with a two-step mutagenic procedure using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). For the T613A mutation, first round PCR used the Apl I cDNA in BluescriptSK (Invitrogen) (29Sossin W.S. Fan X.T. Saberi F. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 10-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as a template and either the outside 5′ primer 5′-CCTATGGAGTGTTGCTGTACG and the inside 3′ primer 5′-TTCACTCGCGAACTCTCGGTCAAAG or the inside 5′ primer 5′-GTTCGCGAGTGAAGCTCCCAACGTG and 5′-GTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC (T7 primer) as the outside 3′ primer. The products from the first round synthesis were combined and used as the template for second round synthesis using the two outside primers. The resultant product was cut withAvrII and NdeI and inserted into the Apl I cDNA in the baculovirus transfer vector Bluebac4 (Invitrogen) (29Sossin W.S. Fan X.T. Saberi F. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 10-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) cut with the same enzymes. An Nru site was formed by the mutagenesis and was used to confirm the cloning. For the S639E mutation, an internal EcoRI site in PKC Apl I was used for a single PCR procedure using the 5′ primer 5′-GGAATTCGAAGGCTTCTCATATGTC and the T7 outside primer. The PCR product was cut withEcoRI and NotI and inserted into the Apl I cDNA in the baculovirus transfer vector Bluebac4 (29Sossin W.S. Fan X.T. Saberi F. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 10-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) cut with the same enzymes. A BstBI site was formed by the mutagenesis and was used to confirm the cloning. For the T634E mutation the same outside primers were used as for the T613A mutagenesis with the inside 3′ primer AAACGTTGAACCCACGGACAAC and inside 5′ primer GGGTTCAACGTTGGGAGCTTC. The resultant PCR product was then cut with EcoRI and AvaI and reinserted into the PKC Apl I S639E cut with the same enzymes. A Psp14601 site was formed by the mutagenesis and was used to confirm the cloning. The clone was sequenced over the entire amplified region to confirm no additional changes were made. Recombination of the transfer vectors into baculovirus and generation of high titer baculovirus stocks were performed as described (29Sossin W.S. Fan X.T. Saberi F. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 10-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation was initiated by the addition of purified kinases to the phosphorylation mix (50 nm TPA, 5 μg/ml PS, 500 mm CaCl2, 50 μm ATP (10 μm when incorporation of [γ-32P]ATP (1–3 μCi; NEN Life Science Products) was investigated), 45 mm MgCl2, 180 mmTris (pH, 7.5)). Nonphosphorylated controls were incubated in a control mix (phosphorylation mix without ATP). These reactions were allowed to proceed at 25 °C for 30 min and were stopped by the addition of 20 μl of Laemmli buffer and then loaded onto 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After transfer to nitrocellulose, membranes were immunoblotted with anti-Apl I-P followed by stripping of the membrane and reprobing with the anti-Apl I antibody. The amount of autophosphorylation was quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Kinases were purified after expression in SF9 as described (29Sossin W.S. Fan X.T. Saberi F. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 10-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Kinase assays of purified PKCs using mixed micelles or PS/TPA were done as described (29Sossin W.S. Fan X.T. Saberi F. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 10-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TheK 12 values and Hill coefficients were calculated as described (18Pepio A.M. Fan X. Sossin W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19040-19048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 30Newton A.C. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14909-14915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For kinase assays using extracts of SF9 cells, 5 ml of SF9 cells (2 × 106 cells/ml) were infected with baculovirus (a multiplicity of infection of 5) and incubated for 72 h. 1–1.5 ml of cells were then pelleted and resuspended in 0.8 ml of ice-cold homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 2.6 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 20 mg/ml aprotinin, 5 mmbenzamadine, and 0.1 mm leupeptin). All further steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells were sonicated for 3 × 10 s with a probe sonicator (Vibracel Sonics and Materials, Danbury, CT), and debris was pelleted by centrifugation in a TL-100 centrifuge (Beckman Instruments) at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. A fraction of the supernatant was used from immunoblotting, while the remaining supernatant was then diluted and used in PKC activity assays as described (29Sossin W.S. Fan X.T. Saberi F. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 10-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aplysia (50–250 g, Marine Specimens, Pacific Palisades, CA) were kept in an aquarium for at least 3 days before experimentation. The animals were first placed in a bath of isotonic MgCl2/artificial sea water (1:1, v/v) and then anesthetized by injection of isotonic MgCl2.Ganglia were isolated from the animal and pinned to silicone plastic in ice-cold dissecting medium containing high magnesium and low calcium (21Sossin W.S. Sacktor T.C. Schwartz J.H. Learn. Mem. 1994; 1: 189-202PubMed Google Scholar). The two pleural and pedal ganglia from each animal were dissected, desheathed, and rested for 1–3 h in resting media at 15 °C (21Sossin W.S. Sacktor T.C. Schwartz J.H. Learn. Mem. 1994; 1: 189-202PubMed Google Scholar) with 10 mm glutamine and 0.1% glucose added just before use. One ganglion from each animal was treated with vehicle (control ganglion) while the other ganglion received either 2 μm 4-β-PDBu (experimental ganglion) for 1 h or 20 μm 5-HT for 90 min at 15 °C. In experiments using 5-HT, both ganglia were then gently washed in resting medium three times and incubated in resting media for 30 min at 15 °C. At the end of the incubations, the resting medium was replaced with ice-cold homogenization media, and the ganglia were desheathed and transferred to homogenizing microtubes (Kontes) containing 125–150 μl of supplemented homogenization buffer (same as above in addition to 50 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate (pH 8.5), and 1 μm microcystin). The ganglia were homogenized on ice in the microtubes and centrifuged at 2500 × g at 4 °C for 3 min. Subsequently, these homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was taken, and the pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of supplemented homogenization buffer. A sample from each condition was removed for analysis of total protein, the remaining sample was boiled in Laemmli buffer, and equal amounts of protein from control and experimental homogenates were loaded onto 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After transfer to nitrocellulose, membranes were immunoblotted with anti-Apl I-P followed by stripping of the membrane and Western blotting with anti-Apl I. We generated antibody to a phosphopeptide from PKC Apl I phosphorylated at both threonine 613 (634 in PKC βII) and threonine 620 (641 in PKC βII) (Fig.1). We first removed all antibody that bound to the nonphosphorylated peptide using an affinity column generated from a nonphosphorylated version of the peptide. We then isolated antibody that bound to an affinity column made from the phosphorylated peptide. Similar antibodies were isolated from two rabbits, but all experiments in this report use antibody from rabbit 2018 (anti-Apl I-P). To ensure specificity to phosphorylated PKC, the purified antibody was also incubated with nonphosphorylated peptide prior to immunoblotting. Under these conditions, anti-Apl I-P did not recognize PKC Apl I expressed in SF9 cells using baculovirus (Fig.2 A). Stimulation of purified PKC Apl I with PKC activators and ATP led to the phosphorylation of Apl I and the appearance of immunoreactivity with anti-Apl I-P (Fig.2 A). These results suggest that immunoreactivity depended on the phosphorylation of threonine 613, since PKCs isolated from SF9 cells are likely to be phosphorylated at threonine 620 before activation (6Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 31Tsutakawa S.E. Medzihradszky K.F. Flint A.J. Burlingame A.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26807-26812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), but the isolated PKC is only recognized by anti-Apl I-P after stimulation with PKC activators and ATP in vitro. To confirm that the increase in immunoreactivity was not due toin vitro phosphorylation at threonine 620, we replaced both this threonine and the constitutively phosphorylated serine 639 with glutamic acid (PKC Apl I T620E,S639E). The kinase was purified from SF9 cells infected with a baculovirus expressing the construct. Similar to wild type PKC Apl I, this kinase was only detected by anti-Apl I-P after stimulation with PKC activators and ATP (Fig. 2 B). Thus, a negative charge at threonine 620 was not sufficient for immunoreactivity by itself but permitted immunoreactivity after phosphorylation of threonine 613 in vitro. Multiple bands were recognized by anti-Apl I-P in PKC Apl I T620E,S639E (Fig.2 B). These bands may still represent differentially phosphorylated forms of PKC Apl I, since preliminary phosphopeptide mapping of PKC Apl I suggests that additional autophosphorylation sites are present in PKC Apl I apart from threonine 613, threonine 620, and serine 639 (data not shown). To demonstrate conclusively that phosphorylation at threonine 613 was required for immunoreactivity, we examined phosphorylation of PKC Apl I after replacing threonine 613 with alanine (PKC Apl I T613A). This construct was not immunoreactive with anti-Apl I-P either before or after stimulation in vitro (Figs. 2 B and3 B), despite the high specific activity of this protein (Fig. 2 C) and its ability to autophosphorylate at other positions (Fig. 3 B). These results demonstrate that anti-Apl I-P recognizes PKC when it is phosphorylated at threonine 613. Evidence from vertebrate PKCs suggests that the enzyme is inactive unless phosphorylated at threonine 620 (8Zhang J. Wang L. Schwartz J. Bond R.W. Bishop W.R. J. Biol.

Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar,31Tsutakawa S.E. Medzihradszky K.F. Flint A.J. Burlingame A.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol.

Thus, we expect that most kinase phosphorylated at threonine 613 will also be phosphorylated at threonine 620. However, our results do not demonstrate whether anti-Apl I-P can recognize PKC phosphorylated at threonine 613 without a negative charge at threonine 620. Phosphorylation of purified PKC Apl I at threonine 613 is slow, increasing throughout a 60-min period of activation (Fig.3 A). This is similar to the bulk of PKC Apl I autophosphorylation measured by incorporation of ATP (Fig.3 A). Threonine 613 is not the only site phosphorylated under these conditions, since incorporation of ATP into PKC Apl I T613A was comparable with that of PKC Apl I (Fig. 3 B), despite the lack of threonine 613 phosphorylation in this kinase. To determine if threonine 613 is phosphorylated in neurons, we examined Aplysia nervous systems that were treated for 1 h with 2 μm 4-β-PDBu or 1 h with 2 μm of vehicle (0.02% dimethyl sulfoxide). As previously reported, PDBu treatment led to the translocation of PKC Apl I, followed by down-regulation (32Sossin W.S. Schwartz J.H. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 24: 210-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) (Fig.4 A). Different preparations show a differential amount of translocation and down-regulation due to the variability in the penetration of the phorbol esters into the ganglia (32Sossin W.S. Schwartz J.H. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 24: 210-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Two experiments are illustrated in Fig. 4 A; experiment 1 shows a large amount of translocation with little down-regulation, while in experiment 2 considerable down-regulation also occurred. Immunoblotting with anti-Apl I-P revealed several interesting features of the PKC phosphorylated at this position. First, even in unstimulated nervous systems, a pool of immunoreactive PKC Apl I was detected, suggesting that, in contrast to SF9 cells, some phosphorylation of threonine 613 occurs in neurons even before stimulation (Fig. 4 A). This is not due to cross-reaction with unphosphorylated PKC Apl I, since controls of purified PKC Apl I run on the same gel did not show immunoreactivity, although the amount of purified PKC Apl I exceeded the amount of kinase present in the ganglia (Fig. 4 A). Second, the PKC phosphorylated at threonine 613 was found mainly in the supernatant fraction, even after the majority of PKC Apl I had been translocated to the membrane with PDBu (Fig. 4 A; see experiment 1). This was surprising, since active PKC is usually found in the particulate fraction, and presumably PKC would have to be activated to stimulate the phosphorylation at threonine 613. Third, phorbol esters increased the percentage of PKC Apl I phosphorylated at threonine 613 by approximately 3-fold (Fig.4 B). This probably represents an increase in threonine 613-phosphorylated PKC together with a specific decrease in cytosolic PKC Apl I that is not phosphorylated at threonine 613, due to down-regulation. Consistent with this interpretation, the increase in the percentage of kinase phosphorylated at threonine 613 correlated with the amount of PKC Apl I down-regulated (Fig. 4 C). Thus, phosphorylation at threonine 613 may protect PKC Apl I from down-regulation. This protection could be due solely to the lack of translocation, since down-regulation may be stimulated by membrane binding (33Lu Z. Liu D. Hornia A. Devonish W. Pagano M. Foster D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 839-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 34Lee H.W. Smith L. Pettit G.R. Vinitsky A. Smith J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20973-20976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We also examined whether treatment with the physiological activator 5-HT led to an increase in PKC Apl I phosphorylation. A significant increase in the percentage of cytosolic PKC Apl I phosphorylated at threonine 613 was observed 30 min after a 90-min application of 20 μm 5-HT (Fig. 5). In this case, we did not observe down-regulation of cytosolic PKC Apl I (Fig.5). Thus, increased phosphorylation at threonine 613 occurs during the persistent activation of PKC in Aplysia ganglia, similar to results seen during persistent activation of PKC in vertebrate hippocampus (16Sweatt J.D. Atkins C.M. Johnson J. English J.D. Roberson E.D. Chen S.J. Newton A. Klann E. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1075-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), although in the vertebrate study increased phosphorylation at other sites or an increase in PKC expression may also have contributed to the signal (16Sweatt J.D. Atkins C.M. Johnson J. English J.D. Roberson E.D. Chen S.J. Newton A. Klann E. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1075-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To determine the importance of threonine 613 for activation and translocation of PKC, we examined the requirements for kinase activity of the PKC Apl I T613A mutant (Fig.6). PKC Apl I T613A had similar phospholipid requirements as wild type PKC in the absence of calcium. In contrast, PKC Apl I T613A required significantly less calcium at limiting PS levels for activation (Fig. 6). These results suggest that this site may regulate the binding of calcium to the C2 domain of PKC Apl I. Previously, it has been reported that phosphorylation of serine 660 is involved in the binding of calcium (12Edwards A.S. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18382-18390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), but this is the first evidence that phosphorylation at threonine 613 (threonine 634 in PKC βII) is also important for the interaction of calcium with the C2 domain. This observation suggests the possibility that autophosphorylated PKC has a lower affinity for calcium and therefore a lower affinity for the membrane. We have attempted to demonstrate this by phosphorylating PKC Apl I in vitro followed by translocation to the membrane. However, the requirements for phosphorylation in vitro lead to translocation to the membrane that is not reversible (data not shown). Threonine 634 (PKC βII) was identified initially as a major site of phosphorylation seen after activation of PKC (13Flint A.J. Paladini R.D. Koshland D.J. Science. 1990; 249: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar); little phosphorylation of this site was seen in native PKC expressed in COS cells or after expression in SF9 cells (6Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 31Tsutakawa S.E. Medzihradszky K.F. Flint A.J. Burlingame A.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26807-26812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, we see no phosphorylation of the homologous site in PKC Apl I, threonine 613, after expression in SF9 cells. However, we have observed basal phosphorylation of this site in Aplysia neurons. This may be due to a greater extent of PKC activation in the nervous system, as compared with SF9 or COS cells. Immunoreactivity with a similar antibody is also seen in rodent brains, even without stimulation, although in this case immunoreactivity may be partly due to phosphorylation of threonine 641 (16Sweatt J.D. Atkins C.M. Johnson J. English J.D. Roberson E.D. Chen S.J. Newton A. Klann E. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1075-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Threonine 613 is conserved in all classical PKCs and many novel PKCs (Fig. 1). Our results show that phosphorylation at this site identifies a pool of enzyme that is retained in the cytosol after treatment with phorbol esters and that appears resistant to down-regulation. Our results do not prove that phosphorylation at threonine 613 is sufficient for retention in the cytosol, since other sites may need to be phosphorylated in conjunction with threonine 613. Furthermore, since we do not know whether anti-PKC Apl I-P recognizes PKC phosphorylated at threonine 613 in the absence of phosphorylation at threonine 620, it is possible that there is a pool of PKC phosphorylated at 613, but not at position 620, that is found on the membrane. While experiments with the vertebrate PKC βII suggest that threonine 620 is constitutively phosphorylated (6Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 31Tsutakawa S.E. Medzihradszky K.F. Flint A.J. Burlingame A.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26807-26812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), this has not been shown for theAplysia isoforms or in the nervous system in vivo. Our results are consistent with reports that a heavily phosphorylated pool of PKC α in PC12 cells is not translocated to membranes by phorbol esters and is not down-regulated (35Gatti A. Robinson P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31718-31722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It is possible that this cytoplasmic pool of PKC α corresponds to kinase phosphorylated at the homologous amino acid (threonine 631) in PKC α (Fig. 1). In this study, the protective phosphorylation only occurred with activation by phorbol esters and not by calcium ions. However, we observed a similar phosphorylation of threonine 613 in PKC Apl I after stimulation by either PS and calcium or PS and TPA in vitro (data not shown). Our study is also in agreement with the recent work of Feng and Hannun (36Feng X. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26870-26874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), which demonstrated that PKC βII requires autophosphorylation to be removed from membranes. In this study, conversion of threonine 641 and serine 660 to alanine substantially reduced the ability of PKC to be removed from the membrane. However, this double alanine mutant was still significantly removed from the membrane compared with catalytically inactive PKC. These results are consistent with phosphorylation at threonine 634 (threonine 613 in Aplysia) being critical for removal from the membrane, since phosphorylation at threonine 641 and serine 660 may be important for the ability of PKC to autophosphorylate at this position (6Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). We observed an increase in phosphorylation of threonine 613 after 5-HT addition, corresponding to a time there is a persistent increase in PKC Apl I activity and autonomous PKC activity (21Sossin W.S. Sacktor T.C. Schwartz J.H. Learn. Mem. 1994; 1: 189-202PubMed Google Scholar). We do not believe that phosphorylation at threonine 613 is important for persistent activation of PKC Apl I or formation of the autonomous kinase, since all threonine 613-phosphorylated PKC is in the cytosol, and there is no increase in the amount of cytosolic activable PKC Apl I or in cytosolic autonomous activity at this time point (21Sossin W.S. Sacktor T.C. Schwartz J.H. Learn. Mem. 1994; 1: 189-202PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, no autonomous activity from the cytosol can be immunoprecipitated with the antibody to PKC Apl I (21Sossin W.S. Sacktor T.C. Schwartz J.H. Learn. Mem. 1994; 1: 189-202PubMed Google Scholar, 24Sossin W.S. Learn. Mem. 1997; 3: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We favor a model whereby increased phosphorylation at threonine 613 is a consequence of persistent activation of PKC but not a cause of persistent activation of PKC. A number of aspects of PKC regulation have been linked to the phosphorylation state of the enzyme, and these phosphorylation events all lead to an increase in PKC activity (6Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). In contrast, we suggest that phosphorylation at threonine 613 is not important for kinase activity and instead may lead to less PKC activity by preventing PKC from associating with the membrane. This lack of PKC translocation could be explained in multiple ways. The change could be due to a decrease in the affinity for lipids, although we have not been able to demonstrate a decrease in lipid bindingin vitro (data not shown). There may be a decrease in the affinity of the enzyme for calcium, and translocation of PKC Apl I by phorbol esters depends on calcium in vitro (37Kruger K.E. Sossin W.S. Sacktor T.C. Bergold P.J. Beushausen S. Schwartz J.H. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 2303-2313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since we cannot demonstrate the lack of translocation with in vitrophosphorylated PKC, additional proteins may be required to prevent PKC Apl I translocation in neurons. In particular, a cytosolic protein might specifically bind to PKC phosphorylated at threonine 613 and retain it in the cytoplasm. Whatever the mechanism for prevention of PKC translocation, the lack of translocation may lead to a decrease in activable PKC. We suggest therefore that phosphorylation of this residue is a mechanism for negative feedback regulation of PKC.

DNA polymerase DTT, dithiothreitol phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride Recent progress in genetic, biochemical, and structural studies of DNA polymerases (pol(s))1 has expanded our understanding of their structure and mechanism. Eight distinct DNA polymerases have been identified in eukaryotic cells, and they are all encoded by nuclear genes (1Burgers P.M. Chromosoma. 1998; 107: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 2Harris P.V. Mazina O.M. Leonhardt E.A. Case R.B. Boyd J.B. Burtis K.C. Mol. Cell.

Although all perform the same basic enzymatic reaction of nucleotide addition to the 3′-end of a primer, eukaryotic cells have evolved a varied set of DNA polymerases to carry out DNA synthesis on different substrates in replication, recombination, and repair. Seven of the eight DNA pols have been demonstrated to be nuclear enzymes involved in either nuclear DNA replication or DNA repair. In contrast, pol γ is the sole DNA polymerase implicated in the replication of animal mitochondrial DNA (5Clayton D.A. Cell. 1982; 28: 693-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar), and it may also carry out base excision repair because it contains a 5′-deoxyribose phosphate lyase activity in the catalytic subunit and participates in DNA repair at abasic sites in vitro (6Pinz K.G. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar,7Longley M.J. Prasad R. Srivastava D.K. Wilson S.H. Copeland W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12244-12248Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Although the subunit structure of DNA polymerases is generally conserved within a DNA polymerase class, that of mitochondrial DNA polymerase has been an unresovled issue. pol γ fromDrosophila is a heterodimer of 125- and 35-kDa subunits (8Wernette C.M. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14764-14770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in budding yeast it appears to be a single polypeptide encoded by the MIP1 gene (9Foury F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20552-20560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have identified human, mouse, and rat homologs of the small accessory subunit of Drosophilapol γ (10Wang Y. Farr C.L. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13640-13646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), but none has been identified in yeast or nematodes. The very low abundance of pol γ in animal cells, where it represents ∼1% of the total DNA polymerase activity (11Weissbach A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 198: 386-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), has limited studies of its structure and mechanism. Nonetheless, the discovery of both mitochondrial DNA diseases (12Wallace D.C. Science. 1999; 283: 1482-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2611) Google Scholar), and the severe inhibitory effects on pol γ of antiviral and antitumor drugs (13Lewis W. Dalakas M.C. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 14Singh G. Sharkey S.M. Moorehead R. Pharmacol. Ther. 1992; 54: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) emphasizes the critical need for these studies. The baculovirus expression system provides a eukaryotic environment for recombinant protein production. We have taken advantage of its features of high level expression and capacity for simultaneous expression of multiple genes to achieve the reconstitution, purification, and biochemical characterization of a recombinant form ofDrosophila pol γ from insect cells. Drosophila pol γ Fraction VI was prepared from embryonic mitochondria as described by Wernette and Kaguni (8Wernette C.M. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol.

Baculovirus transfer vector pVL1392/1393 and linearized wild type baculovirus AcMNPV DNA (BaculoGold) were purchased from PharMingen. Wild type baculovirus AcMNPV was the gift of Dr. Suzanne Thiem (Department of Entomology, Michigan State University). Synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides as indicated below were synthesized in an Applied Biosystems model 477 oligonucleotide synthesizer.

Baker Chemical Co. and the Peptide Institute (Minoh-Shi, Japan), respectively. Baculovirus transfer vectors containing either the complete or modified coding sequences of the α- and β-subunits of Drosophila pol γ were prepared by standard DNA manipulations. NdeI fragments containing the complete coding sequence of the α-subunit with or without its mitochondrial presequence were released from theEscherichia coli expression vector pET (16Lewis D.L.

A transfer plasmid containing the α-subunit with its mitochondrial presequence replaced at the N terminus with a hexa-histidine tag (pVL93αN-His) was obtained by replacing the XbaI fragment of pVL93α (representing the N-terminal portion of the coding sequence) with anXbaI fragment from an E. coli expression vector pET-28a containing the α-subunit lacking the mitochondrial presequence. An α-subunit transfer plasmid containing a C-terminal hexa-histidine tag (pVL93αC-His) was prepared by polymerase chain reaction-mediated site-directed mutagenesis to insert the tag between the terminal amino acid, Ser1145, and the stop codon in pVL93α. An XbaI-BamHI restriction fragment from the E. coli expression vector pET-11a containing the complete coding sequence of the β-subunit with its mitochondrial presequence (10Wang Y. Farr C.L.

DNA sequence analysis of the various plasmid constructs was performed to confirm their structure and sequence integrity. Linearized wild type baculovirus DNA (BaculoGold, 0.5 μg; PharMingen) and purified transfer plasmid DNAs encoding the α- or β-subunit ofDrosophila pol γ (2 μg) were co-transfected in transfection buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.1, 125 mm CaCl2, 140 mm NaCl) for 4 h at 27 °C following the manufacturer's recommendations. Recombinant viruses were plaque purified and amplified in Sf9 cells to titers of 5 × 107 to 1 × 108 plaque forming units/ml. The resulting recombinant viruses were designated as pVL93α, pVL93αNL, pVL93αN-His, pVL93αC-His, for viruses encoding full-length α-subunit with and without (NL) the mitochondrial presequence, or with N- or C-terminal hexa-histidine tags, respectively; β-subunit constructs were designated pVL92β, pVL92βT7, and pVL92βNL-T7 for full-length β-subunit or with a C-terminal T7 antigen tag (T7) with or without (NL) the mitochondrial presequence, respectively (see Fig. 1). For each recombinant virus, 10–12 independently isolated clones were amplified and tested for expression of recombinant protein. All of these produced recombinant α- or β-subunit polypeptides at similar levels. Sf9 cells were grown in TC-100 insect cell culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 27 °C and infected with recombinant viruses at a multiplicity of infection of 5. For protein analysis of whole cell lysates, cells were collected by centrifugation (1000 × g) at a density of ∼106/ml and lysed in Laemmli gel loading buffer (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206983) Google Scholar) or washed with phosphate-buffered saline buffer, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Cells collected from 50 ml of culture were homogenized in 10 ml of 15 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 280 mm sucrose, 1 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 10 mm sodium metabisulfite, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and mitochondria were purified as described by Wernette and Kaguni (8Wernette C.M. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14764-14770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mitochondrial pellet was thawed and extracted with 2% sodium cholate (w/v) in 25 mmHEPES, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 300 mmNaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 10 mmsodium metabisulfite, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin. The resulting cytoplasmic and mitochondrial fractions were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 3 °C to remove insoluble material. All operations were performed at 0–4 °C. Sf9 cells (500 ml) were grown as above, co-infected with recombinant baculoviruses encoding the α- and β-subunits ofDrosophila pol γ and harvested 48 h post infection. The cells were pelleted and washed with an equal volume of cold phosphate-buffered saline buffer. The cell pellet (∼1 × 109 cells) was resuspended in 10 ml of homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 280 mm sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 10 mm sodium bisulfite, 1 mm PMSF, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin) and lysed by 20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 7 min. The resulting pellet was twice resuspended in 2.5 ml of homogenization buffer and rehomogenized and centrifuged as above. The combined supernatant fractions were centrifuged at 8,000 × gfor 15 min to pellet the mitochondria, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min to obtain the cytoplasmic soluble fraction (Fraction I). Purification of recombinant pol γ holoenzyme was conducted as described by Wernette and Kaguni (8Wernette C.M. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14764-14770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Fraction I (70–90 mg protein) was adjusted to an ionic equivalent of 80 mm potassium phosphate and loaded onto a phosphocellulose column (15 ml) equilibrated with 80 mmpotassium phosphate buffer (80 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, 20% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 10 mm sodium metabisulfite, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin) at a flow rate of 12 ml/h. The column was washed with 3 volumes of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer at a flow rate of 30 ml/h. Proteins were eluted with a 3-volume linear gradient from 150 to 350 mm potassium phosphate buffer at a flow rate of 30 ml/h. The gradient was followed by a 2-volume high salt wash of 600 mm potassium phosphate buffer. Active fractions were pooled (Fraction II) and adjusted to a final concentration of 10% sucrose. After addition of solid ammonium sulfate (0.351 g/ml of Fraction II) and overnight incubation on ice, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 3 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 2.0 ml of 10 mmpotassium phosphate buffer containing 45% glycerol and stored at −20 °C (Fraction IIb). Fraction IIb was dialyzed in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer in a collodion bag (molecular mass cut-off, 25,000 kDa) until an ionic equivalent of 85 mm KCl was reached and loaded onto a single-stranded DNA-cellulose column (1.8 ml) equilibrated with 20 mmpotassium phosphate buffer at a flow rate of 1.3 ml/h. The column was washed with 2 volumes of potassium phosphate buffer containing 100 mm KCl at 2.7 ml/h followed by successive elutions at 4 ml/h with potassium phosphate buffer containing 250 mm KCl (8 ml), 600 mm KCl (6 ml), and 1 m KCl (4 ml). Active fractions were pooled (Fraction III), and solid ammonium sulfate (0.2 g/ml) was added to increase hydrophobic interactions. After stirring for 20 min on ice, the suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 rpm. The supernatant was loaded onto an octyl-Sepharose column (0.5 ml) equilibrated with 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/h. The octyl-Sepharose column was washed with 4 volumes of equilibration buffer at 2 ml/h and then eluted successively with 4 volumes of 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer containing 9% glycerol and 0.3, 1, and 2% Triton X-100. Active fractions were pooled (Fraction IV) and loaded onto two 12–30% glycerol gradients as described (8Wernette C.M. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14764-14770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Active fractions were pooled, stabilized by addition of glycerol to 45%, and stored at −20 °C or frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Fraction I was prepared from 500 ml of cell culture, chromatographed on phosphocellulose, and precipitated with ammonium sulfate as described above. The pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer containing 45% glycerol and stored at −20 °C (Fraction IIb). Fraction IIb (3–5 mg protein) was dialyzed in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer in a collodion bag (molecular mass cut-off, 25,000 kDa) until an ionic equivalent of 100 mm KCl was reached and mixed with 500 μl of precharged nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) equilibrated in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm KCl, 8% glycerol, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm PMSF, 10 mm sodium metabisulfite, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 mm imidazole. The suspension was incubated for 10 h on ice with gentle shaking. The beads were allowed to settle and then washed twice with 1 ml of equilibration buffer for 30 min with gentle shaking. The washed beads were packed into a column (0.5 ml), and protein retained on the beads was eluted successively with equilibration buffer containing 25 mm imidazole (0.5 ml), 250 mm imidazole (0.5 ml), and 500 mm imidazole (0.5 ml). Active fractions were pooled (Fraction III, 0.9 ml) and loaded onto two 12–30% glycerol gradients as described (8Wernette C.M. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14764-14770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Active fractions were pooled (Fraction IV, ∼8 μg of protein, 20,000–25,000 units/mg), stabilized by addition of glycerol to 45%, and stored at −20 °C or frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. DNA polymerase activity was assayed on DNase I-activated calf thymus DNA or singly primed M13 DNA as described by Wernette and Kaguni (8Wernette C.M. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14764-14770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Farr et al. (15Farr C.L. Wang Y. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol.

One unit of activity is the amount that catalyzes the incorporation of 1 nmol of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate into acid insoluble material in 60 min at 30 °C using DNase I-activated calf thymus DNA as the substrate. Substrates were prepared as described by Farr et al. (15Farr C.L. Wang Y. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14770-14785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (0.05 ml) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 4 mmMgCl2, 10 mm DTT, 0–180 mm KCl as indicated, 400 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 4 μm 5′-end labeled singly primed recombinant M13 DNA containing a 3′-terminal mispair, and 0.05 unit of Fraction V enzyme. mtSSB (0.4 μg) was added as indicated in the figure legends. Incubation was for 30 min at 30 °C. Samples were then made 1% in SDS and 10 mm in EDTA, heated for 10 min at 65 °C, and precipitated with ethanol in the presence of 1 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA as carrier. The ethanol precipitates were resuspended in 80% formamide and 90 mm Tris borate. Aliquots were denatured for 2 min at 100 °C, chilled on ice, and electrophoresed in an 18% polyacrylamide slab gel (13 × 23 × 0.075 cm) containing 7m urea in 90 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3 and 25 mm EDTA. After electrophoresis, the gel was washed in 15% glycerol for 20 min and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (Molecular Dynamics). The data were analyzed using the ImageQuant version 4.2a software. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (18Bradford M.M. Anal Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215560) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Gel electrophoresis and protein transfer and immunoblotting were performed as described by Wang et al. (10Wang Y. Farr C.L. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13640-13646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Baculoviruses were constructed as described under “Experimental Procedures” to encode the catalytic (α) and accessory (β) subunits ofDrosophila pol γ, with or without their mitochondrial presequences, and with or without a hexa-histidine or T7 antigen tag at the N or C terminus (Fig. 1). Protein analysis of whole cell extracts of infected Sf9 cells by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Blue staining shows that the expression levels of the recombinant α- and β-subunit polypeptides are similar to that of the viral polyhedron protein (Fig. 2 A). Cells infected with various α-subunit baculoviruses all produce a polypeptide of 125 kDa that is identified as the recombinant catalytic subunit by immunoblot analysis with subunit-specific rabbit antiserum (Fig. 2 B). Likewise, cells infected with various β-subunit baculoviruses produce a polypeptide of ∼35 kDa that reacts with accessory subunit-specific antibody. At the same time, extracts from uninfected Sf9 cells and cells infected with wild type virus do not exhibit any cross-reactive polypeptides. Production of total recombinant protein was calculated to be ∼2 μg/ml of cell culture. Proteolytic degradation was observed, and subcellular fractionation experiments indicated that only about 10–20% of the recombinant protein was recovered in the soluble fraction. Overexpression in other insect cell lines (Sf21 or High Five) neither improved solubility nor limited proteolysis; there was also no apparent effect of varying the multiplicity or time course of infection on these problems (data not shown). To evaluate the requirement for mitochondrial targeting sequences in import of the recombinant pol γ subunits, Sf9 cells were infected individually or in combination with baculoviruses encoding the recombinant subunits with or without their mitochondrial presequences, and subcellular fractions were prepared and examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting. Both the recombinant α- and β-subunit polypeptides were clearly detected in the soluble mitochondrial fraction derived from cells expressing both recombinant polypeptides containing their N-terminal presequences (Fig. 3). However, the targeting and/or import efficiency is low, with an estimated yield of only ∼40 ng of recombinant α and β polypeptides/ml of cell culture harvested 48 h post infection. This represents only ∼2% of the total recombinant protein. At the same time, the mitochondrial fraction contains predominantly full-length recombinant protein, indicating that the mature α- and β-subunit polypeptides are protected from proteolysis upon import. No recombinant protein was detected in mitochondrial extracts from cells expressing recombinant subunit polypeptides lacking mitochondrial presequences at their N termini; instead, the recombinant polypeptides remained in the insect cell cytoplasm. Thus, the mitochondrial presequences are necessary but insufficient for efficient mitochondrial import. To determine whether or not proper folding of the individual pol γ subunits and/or reconstitution of the heterodimeric holoenzyme is achieved in the baculovirus system, we fractionated soluble extracts of partially purified mitochondria by glycerol gradient sedimentation. We found that in coinfected Sf9 cells, the recombinant subunits cosediment at the same glycerol density as the nearly homogeneous pol γ from Drosophila embryonic mitochondria (Fig. 4). Similar results were obtained with cells harvested at 36, 42, or 48 h after coinfection (data not shown). Recombinant catalytic subunit expressed individually sedimented at lower glycerol density, consistent with its molecular mass. However, recombinant accessory subunit expressed individually was largely insoluble and failed to sediment as a discrete species (data not shown). Although the soluble form of the coexpressed subunits was present largely as reconstituted heterodimer, the limited mitochondrial import of the recombinant polypeptides rendered preparative scale purification of the mitochondrial form impractical. We then examined cytoplasmic soluble extracts by phosphocellulose chromatography followed by immunoblot analysis. Remarkably, we found that the full-length recombinant subunits are also assembled into heterodimer in the cytoplasm of Sf9 cells (Fig.5, lane 1). Interestingly, coexpression of recombinant α- and β-subunits as mature forms lacking their mitochondrial presequences does not yield a pol γ heterodimer (αNL/βNL; Fig. 5, lane 2). Indeed, removal of the mitochondrial presequence of the catalytic subunit alone in coexpression experiments is sufficient to disrupt holoenzyme assembly in the cytoplasm (αNL/β; Fig. 5, lane 3). Nonetheless, Fig. 5 shows that soluble α-subunit with or without its leader sequence can be purified by phosphocellulose chromatography, suggesting proper folding as for the mature catalytic subunit in the soluble mitochondrial fraction. Again, as with the mature mitochondrial polypeptide, the accessory subunit is predominantly insoluble in the cytoplasmic fraction and cannot be recovered upon phosphocellulose chromatography. We purified recombinant Drosophila pol γ to near homogeneity from the soluble cytoplasmic fraction of Sf9 cells that were coinfected with baculoviruses encoding the complete coding sequences of the α- and β-subunits. Sequential chromatography was performed on phosphocellulose, single-stranded DNA-cellulose, and octyl-Sepharose, followed by glycerol gradient sedimentation (see “Experimental Procedures”). A representative purification is shown in TableI. The enzyme was purified ∼180-fold with a yield of 2%. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and silver staining of the fraction V enzyme revealed two major polypeptides that had relative mobilities corresponding to those of native pol γ fromDrosophila embryos and that were identified as its two subunits by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 6). Immunoblot analyses also showed that the two polypeptides are tightly associated in the same apparent stoichiometry throughout the purification scheme (data not shown). The purification procedure yields ∼7.5 μg of nearly homogeneous recombinant pol γ from ∼109 cells, as compared with ∼10 μg from 200 g of Drosophila embryos. Although the yields are similar, the baculovirus system offers two advantages. First, the procedure is amenable to an ∼10-fold increase in scale, whereas enzyme production from Drosophila embryos is near its limit. Second, the baculovirus system can be used to produce mutant enzyme derivatives.Table IPurification of recombinant Drosophila pol γ from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cellsFractionVolumeProteinDNA pol activityaActivity was measured in the standard assay on DNase I-activated calf thymus DNA in the presence of 200 mm KCl.

Open table in a new tab The recombinant pol γ holoenzyme exhibits very similar biochemical properties as compared with native pol γ from Drosophila embryos (TableII). It is an active DNA polymerase with 3′-5′ exonuclease activity. Furthermore, the specific activity of the recombinant enzyme is 20,000 units/mg, which is similar to that of native pol γ. Its DNA polymerase activity is stimulated 8-fold by elevated salt (200 mm KCl) on DNase I-activated calf thymus DNA and 30-fold by mtSSB on singly primed M13 DNA. Its 3′- 5′ exonuclease activity is mispair-specific (Fig.7) and is also stimulated by salt and by mtSSB (Fig. 7 and Table II). Mispair specificity was observed at both low and elevated salt and in the presence or absence of mtSSB; under each condition, less than 10% of the paired termini generated by 3′-terminal mispair hydrolysis were hydrolyzed.Table IIBiochemical properties of native and recombinant Drosophila pol γNativeRecombinantDNA polymerase Specific activity (units/mg)aSpecific activity and KCl stimulation of DNA polymerase were measured in the standard assay on DNase I-activated calf thymus DNA.26,900–80,00020,000 Stimulation by KCl (200 vs. 30 mm; fold)209 Stimulation by mtSSB (30 mm KCl; fold)b3′-5′ exonuclease activity and mtSSB stimulation of DNA polymerase and 3′-5′ exonuclease were measured on singly primed M13 DNA.15–20223′-5′ exonuclease Stimulation by KCl (120 vs. 30 mm; fold)54 Stimulation by mtSSB (30 mm KCl; fold)75a Specific activity and KCl stimulation of DNA polymerase were measured in the standard assay on DNase I-activated calf thymus DNA.b 3′-5′ exonuclease activity and mtSSB stimulation of DNA polymerase and 3′-5′ exonuclease were measured on singly primed M13 DNA. Open table in a new tab We sought to compare the reconstituted holoenzyme with the individually expressed catalytic core to evaluate the biochemical role of the accessory subunit in pol γ function. Upon expression of the catalytic subunit alone, we found that its expression level, solubility, and chromatographic properties are very similar to the holoenzyme, suggesting its structural integrity (Fig. 5 and data not shown). Similarly, both the reconstituted holoenzyme and the catalytic core can be purified by an alternate scheme using a baculovirus encoding the catalytic subunit with a C-terminal hexa-histidine tag. Here the purification scheme involves phosphocellulose and metal chelation affinity chromatography followed by glycerol gradient sedimentation, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In either of the standard or affinity purification schemes, we obtained a similar purity and specific activity for the reconstituted holoenzyme (Fig. 6, TableI, and “Experimental Procedures”), but the specific activity of the purified catalytic core alone was greatly reduced, maximally 2% of that of the holoenzyme. This corroborates our previous dissociation studies of the native enzyme (19Olson M.W. Wang Y. Elder R.H. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28932-28937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and taken together these results indicate that the accessory subunit in Drosophila pol γ is required primarily for the catalytic efficiency of the holoenzyme. By comparison, the accessory subunit of bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase,E. coli thioredoxin, increases the catalytic activity of that heterodimer about 100-fold (20Tabor S. Huber H.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16212-16223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have established a reproducible method for recombinant production and reconstitution of Drosophila mitochondrial DNA polymerase using the baculovirus expression system. Although we have pursued a variety of approaches since we isolated cDNAs for its two subunits, we failed to achieve reconstitution of the heterodimeric holoenzyme by bacterial expression (10Wang Y. Farr C.L. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13640-13646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the baculovirus system, the recombinant subunits of pol γ are targeted and imported into mitochondria of Sf9 cells whether they are expressed individually or coordinately, suggesting that the cellular machinery for mitochondrial localization and processing is generally conserved between Drosophila and S. frugiperda.At the same time, the low yield of recombinant pol γ in Sf9 cell mitochondria likely results from the lytic nature of baculovirus infection. It is recognized that host protein synthesis is reduced greatly 24 h after infection, when viral late genes dominate mRNA transcription. Nonetheless, that the recombinant holoenzyme can be purified from the soluble cytoplasmic fraction, and shown to exhibit both nearly identical chromatographic behavior and the biochemical and physical properties of native Drosophila pol γ, argues strongly that proper folding and subunit assembly occurs in the cytoplasm of the cultured insect cells. In examining cytoplasmic reconstitution of mitochondrial DNA polymerase, we constructed recombinant baculoviruses encoding the mature forms of both subunits that lack their mitochondrial presequences. Although recombinant protein production was unaffected, holoenzyme reconstitution was eliminated when the catalytic and accessory subunit polypeptides were co-expressed without their presequences. Although the precise role of the presequence in promoting holoenzyme assembly is not clear, it seems plausible that the targeting of nascent recombinant protein to the mitochondrion itself brings the two subunits in close proximity, thus aiding heterodimer formation. In this regard then, the recombinant pol γ purified and characterized in this study is slightly different structurally from nativeDrosophila pol γ, because it contains the mitochondrial presequences in both subunits. However, the presequence in the catalytic subunit constitutes only 9 of its 1145 amino acid residues, and the predicted presequence in the accessory subunit is only 11 residues. We detected no significant alternations in the catalytic properties of our recombinant pol γ, including the form containing a C-terminal histidine-tag on the catalytic polypeptide, as compared with the native heterodimeric enzyme from Drosophila embryonic mitochondria. The human pol γ catalytic subunit has been purified from cultured HeLa cells and as recombinant enzyme from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells (21Longley M.J. Ropp P.A. Lim S.E. Copeland W.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10529-10539Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). These enzymes exhibit similar catalytic properties yet differ from native pol γ from a variety of sources because the DNA polymerase activity is salt-sensitive. Whether or not mtSSB stimulates either DNA polymerase or 3′-5′ exonuclease activity is not known. Our biochemical characterization of recombinantDrosophila pol γ shows clearly that both its DNA polymerase and 3′-5′ exonuclease activities are stimulated by elevated salt and by mtSSB. Whether the difference observed in our study reflects the functional significance of the accessory subunit remains to be determined. At the same time, our finding that the isolatedDrosophila catalytic core has a specific activity at least 20-fold lower than that of the reconstituted heterodimer demonstrates the critical role of the accessory subunit in Drosophila pol γ. In sum, we have established an effective eukaryotic expression system to produce recombinant mitochondrial DNA polymerase. To our knowledge, this work represents the first example of reconstitution of a multi-subunit mitochondrial enzyme using the baculovirus system. This now provides us with a powerful approach to study mutant forms of holoenzyme and to examine subunit interactions in Drosophilapol γ.

https://openalex.org/W2043557772,"In factor IX residues 199–204 encompass one of six surface loops bordering its substrate-binding groove. To investigate the contribution of this loop to human factor IX function, a series of chimeric factor IX variants was constructed, in which residues 199–204 were replaced by the corresponding sequence of factor VII, factor X, or prothrombin. The immunopurified and activated chimeras were indistinguishable from normal factor IXa in hydrolyzing a small synthetic substrate, indicating that this region is not involved in the interaction with substrate residues on the N-terminal side of the scissile bond. In contrast, replacement of loop 199–204 resulted in a 5–25-fold reduction in reactivity toward the macromolecular substrate factor X. This reduction was due to a combination of increased K m and reducedk cat. In the presence of factor VIIIa the impaired reactivity toward factor X was largely restored for all factor IXa variants, resulting in a more pronounced stimulation by factor VIIIa compared with normal factor IXa (3 to 5 × 104-fold versus 5 × 103-fold). Inhibition by antithrombin was only slightly affected for the factor IXa variant with the prothrombin loop sequence, whereas factor IXa variants containing the analogous residues of factor VII or factor X were virtually insensitive to antithrombin inhibition. In the presence of heparin, however, all chimeric factor IXa variants formed complexes with antithrombin. Thus the cofactors heparin and factor VIIIa have in common that they both alleviate the deleterious effects of mutations in the factor IX loop 199–204. Collectively, our data demonstrate that loop 199–204 plays an important role in the interaction of factor IXa with macromolecular substrates."

PDEs belong to a diverse superfamily of proteins that catalyze the hydrolysis of 3′:5′-cyclic nucleotides to the corresponding nucleoside 5′-monophosphates. The multiple PDEs differ in their tissue distributions, substrate specificities, sensitivities to inhibitors, and modes of regulation. The PDEs are multidomain chimeric proteins that possess both catalytic and regulatory domains (7Beavo J.A. Conti M. Heaslip R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 399-405PubMed Google Scholar). The cGMP-binding PDEs comprise a group of PDEs that contains allosteric cyclic nucleotide-binding sites; two homologous amino acid sequences within each PDE monomer encode these sites, referred to as sitea and site b. All of these allosteric cyclic nucleotide-binding sites that have been characterized are highly selective for cGMP. This group of PDEs consists of several families, including the cGMP-stimulated PDE (PDE2), the photoreceptor PDEs (PDE6s), and the cGMP-binding cGMP-specific PDE (PDE5). Recently, one more family (PDE10) whose amino acid sequence includes two regions that are homologous to the allosteric cyclic nucleotide-binding sites in cGMP-binding PDEs has been described (8Loughney K.

[8-3H]cGMP and [5,8-3H]cAMP were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. cGMP, cAMP, Crotalus atrox snake venom, and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine were obtained from Sigma. Hydroxyapatite was from Bio-Rad. The cGB-8/14 clone encodes a full-length bovine lung PDE5 (9Turko I.V. Haik T.L. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Burns F. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22240-22244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) has been used to make a D289N mutation in the cGB-8/14 clone in pBacPAK9 expression vector (CLONTECH) according to the protocol from Stratagene. The following pair of mutagenic oligonucleotides was used: 5′-ACA TTC ACT GAA AAA AAC GAA AAG GAC TTT-3′ and 5′-AAA GTC CTT TTC GTT TTT TTC AGT GAA TGT-3′. The altered bases are underlined. Escherichia coli XL1-blue cells were used for all transformations. DNA was purified from large scale vector preparations using a QIAGEN Plasmid Maxi kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (QIAGEN Inc.) and sequenced in its entirety to ensure the presence of the desired mutation. Sf9 cells were cotransfected with Bsu36I-digested BacPAK6 viral DNA (CLONTECH) and either wild-type or mutated cGB-8/14 clones in the pBacPAK9 expression vector by the lipofection method according to the protocol from CLONTECH. At 3 days postinfection, the transfection supernatant was collected, amplified twice in Sf9 cells, and then used directly as virus stock for expression without additional purification of recombinant viruses. High FiveTM cells (Invitrogen) grown at 27 °C in complete Grace's insect medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 μg/ml gentamycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) in T-185 flasks were infected by 5 ml of virus stock per flask. The culture medium was harvested at 96 h postinfection. 240–260 ml of the culture medium was fractionated by sequential ammonium sulfate precipitation at 4 °C. The fraction precipitated by 25–45% saturation was resuspended in 30 ml of 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and centrifuged at 48,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded onto a hydroxyapatite column (1.5 × 15 cm) equilibrated with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. The column was washed with 100 ml of 70 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and then eluted with 120 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, at a flow rate of 5 ml/h. The pool containing PDE5 activity was diluted with 6 volumes of ice-cold deionized water and concentrated to approximately 1 ml using an Amicon filtration cell equipped with a PM-30 membrane. All purification steps were performed at 4 °C. The final preparation (approximately 5% purity) was stored in 20% glycerol at −70 °C. The cGMP binding assay was conducted in the presence of 0.5–100 μm [3H]cGMP in a total volume of 60 μl in 50 mm Tris, 50 mm bis-Tris, 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.2–9.5. The buffer was supplemented with 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. The pH was adjusted with acetic acid. The ionic strength of this buffer system is constant over the pH range used in this study (17Ellis K.L. Morrison J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 405-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Direct [3H]cAMP binding in this buffer system was measured at a pH value of 5.2. Competition experiments were conducted in the presence of a wide range of [3H]cGMP and 100 μm cAMP as the competing ligand. The reaction was initiated by addition of an aliquot of enzyme. Under these conditions the amount of [3H]cGMP bound to PDE5 remained constant from 7 to 30 min on ice. A 30-min incubation was selected for all measurements. Following this incubation, the assay mixtures were filtered onto premoistened Millipore HAWP filters (pore size, 0.45 μm), which were then rinsed four times with a total of 4 ml of cold buffer (with appropriate pH) and then dried and counted. The data were corrected by subtraction of 2–4% nonspecific binding, which was defined as the [3H]cGMP or [3H]cAMP bound in the absence of PDE5. The data were subjected to nonlinear least squares analysis using the program MINSQ II (Micromath Scientific Software, Salt Lake City, UT) to obtain the dissociation constant (K d). PDE5 catalytic activity was measured using the procedure described previously (18Turko I.V. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6460-6466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). SDS electrophoresis in 10% polyacrylamide gels and Western blot analysis were done as described previously (16McAllister-Lucas L.M. Haik T.L. Colbran J.L. Sonnenburg W.K. Seger D. Turko I.V. Beavo J.A. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30671-30679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Total protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Saturation analyses were performed as described at different pH values over the range from 5.2 to 9.5 using a Tris/bis-Tris acetate buffer that maintains a constant ionic strength throughout the entire pH range used in these studies (17Ellis K.L. Morrison J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 405-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). The binding affinity for [3H]cGMP to the allosteric sites of PDE5 declined at lower pH values (Fig.1, −cAMP). TheK d for [3H]cGMP binding was 2.4 ± 0.3 μm at a pH value of 5.2, which was 16-fold lower affinity than the K d of 0.15 μmmeasured at a pH value of 9.5. To address possible denaturation of PDE5 at the more extreme pH values, the values for total [3H]cGMP binding were calculated and expressed as nanomoles of cGMP bound per mg of total protein used in the assay (Fig.1, inset). These values were essentially unaffected by alteration of pH. This indicated that the number of available binding sites does not depend on [H+] and that the decrease in affinity for cGMP could be because of protonation of a residue(s) within the binding sites. Because affinity for cAMP binding to the allosteric sites of PDE5 is considerably lower than that for cGMP, it is not practical to directly measure cAMP binding using Millipore filtration. Therefore, the pH dependence of cAMP binding was determined by assessing the efficacy with which unlabeled cAMP (100 μm) competes with [3H]cGMP binding to PDE5 (Fig. 1). At pH 5.2, theK d values for [3H]cGMP binding increased 13-fold in the presence of cAMP. The increased competition by cAMP at lower pH values suggested that protonation within the binding sites could create more favorable interactions for cAMP binding. We attempted to directly measure [3H]cAMP binding at pH 5.2 (Fig. 2). Despite the clear dependence on cAMP concentration, the [3H]cAMP binding level was very low and precluded an estimation of K d. Even at a very high concentration (100 μm), the binding of cAMP to the allosteric binding sites was still at least 20 times less than that for cGMP (Fig. 2). The affinity of cAMP was so low that it could not be ruled out that some of the bound cAMP was lost during Millipore filtration. Recently, studies of site-directed mutagenesis within the high affinity binding site a of PDE5, combined with modeling, suggested that Asp-289 forms a hydrogen bond with the proton of the N-1 endo-nitrogen of the guanine base of cGMP (9Turko I.V. Haik T.L. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Burns F. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22240-22244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Crystallographic analysis indicated that this type of interaction, which is very specific for the guanine ring, occurs in GTP-binding proteins such as transducin-α, EF-Tu, and Ha-Ras p21 (20Wittinghofer A. Cell. 1994; 76: 201-204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In contrast, an unfavorable electrostatic effect would be expected between the negatively charged side chain of Asp and the unshared pair of electrons in the sp 2 orbital at N-1 of the adenine ring of cAMP. If deprotonation (ionization) of Asp-289 fosters cGMP binding and discriminates against cAMP binding, then the cyclic nucleotide selectivity in this site should be sensitive to changes in pH. By this same reasoning, substitution of an Asn at this position would be predicted to render the cyclic nucleotide selectivity insensitive to changes in pH. Both Asp and Asn have the potential to provide a hydrogen bond to the proton of the N-1 position of cGMP, so it is expected that cGMP binding properties of wild-type and mutant PDE5 s could be similar. Also, this replacement of an acid with its corresponding amide should have the additional advantage of minimizing potential structural alterations within the recombinant protein. The D289N mutant was expressed in High FiveTM cells and partially purified from culture medium using ammonium sulfate precipitation and hydroxyapatite chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” There was no noticeable difference in binding to and subsequent elution of this protein from the hydroxyapatite column compared with that for the wild-type enzyme. The catalytic and cyclic nucleotide binding properties of the D289N mutant were recently described (21Turko I.V. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and they did not differ significantly from those of wild-type PDE5. When analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis this protein also migrated with essentially the same mobility as that of the wild-type enzyme (21Turko I.V. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These combined results indicated that the D289N mutant is expressed as a correctly folded, catalytically active, full-length protein. The pH dependence of [3H]cGMP binding to the D289N mutant in the presence or absence of 100 μm cAMP is shown in Fig. 3. As with the wild-type PDE5, the total [3H]cGMP binding was not appreciably altered over the pH range studied (Fig. 3, inset). This indicated that the number of available binding sites did not depend on hydrogen ion concentration. The K d for [3H]cGMP binding to the D289N mutant was 1.4 μm at pH 5.2, which was 7-fold lower than the K d of 0.2 μmmeasured at pH 9.5. The pH profiles for the D289N mutant showed small improvement in cAMP binding, and the K d value for [3H]cGMP binding in the presence of 100 μmcAMP at pH 5.2 increased 3-fold only compared with that in the absence of cAMP. To compare wild-type and mutant enzymes, the value ofK d+cAMP/K d−cAMPwas plotted versus pH (Fig.4). These plots show that substitution of asparagine for the aspartic acid residue in the high affinity site strongly reduces the pH-dependent improvement in cAMP binding that is observed for the wild-type enzyme.Figure 4pH-dependent cyclic nucleotide discrimination in the allosteric sites of wild-type and mutant PDE5s. The ratio of K ds in the presence (K d+cAMP) and in the absence (K d−cAMP) of cAMP was plotted versus pH values for wild-type (▪) and D289N (▵) enzymes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Results of pH titrations combined with those using site-directed mutagenesis indicated that ionization of Asp-289, which occurs at physiological pH, contributes importantly to the high affinity binding of cGMP and to the discrimination of this site against cAMP. Even though protonation significantly altered cyclic nucleotide selectivity, the effect was not absolute. Even at the lowest pH value tested, saturation was not achieved in direct [3H]cAMP binding experiments (Fig. 2). Although protonation/deprotonation of PDE5-binding sites is likely to contribute significantly to the affinity and selectivity for cyclic nucleotide binding, additional factors must also contribute. Results of this report indicate that the ionization state of Asp-289 in the high affinity allosteric binding site of PDE5 affects the apparent affinity for cGMP and that cGMP binds more tightly to the enzyme when this residue is in the unprotonated state. Asp-289 in the unprotonated state apparently plays an important role not only in high affinity cGMP binding but also in discrimination against cAMP. The proposed molecular mechanism of this discrimination is shown in Fig.5 and is based on the different chemical properties of the N-1 position of the corresponding guanine and adenine bases of cGMP and cAMP. In this model, a hydrogen bond can be formed between the carboxylate of aspartic acid and the N-1 hydrogen of cGMP at physiological pH. For cAMP at the same pH value, a repulsion would be predicted between the negatively charged side chain and the unshared pair of electrons in the sp 2 orbital at the N-1 position of adenine. Protonation of aspartic acid at lower pH values should reduce the strength of the interaction with cGMP, while eliminating the repulsive forces with cAMP. Results similar to those described in this report were obtained earlier for cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels, which also apparently utilize an aspartic acid residue for bonding with cGMP (4Varnum M.D. Black K.D. Zagotta W.N. Neuron. 1995; 15: 619-625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 22Gordon S.E. Oakley J.C. Varnum M.D. Zagotta W.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3994-4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Because other members of cGMP-binding PDEs, PDE2 and PDE6, possess the conserved aspartic acid residue in the position corresponding to Asp-289 of PDE5, the mechanism of discrimination against cAMP in these PDEs is likely to be similar to that in PDE5. Despite a very high degree of cyclic nucleotide discrimination in vitro (6Hebert M.C. Schwede F. Jastorff B. Cote R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5557-5565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 11Erneux C. Miot F. Van Haastert P.J.M. Jastorff B. J. Cyclic Nucleotide Protein Phosphor.

Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1992; 25: 45-53PubMed Google Scholar), could cAMP interaction with the allosteric sites of cGMP-binding PDEs occur in vivo? At least two points must be considered when addressing this issue. First, the apparent pKa values for ionizable groups within amino acids obtained from kinetic measurements may not represent the actual pKa values of these groups in intact proteins because protein folding can markedly shift the ionization state of these groups. For instance, in some proteins the carboxyl group of a buried Asp may be partially protonated even at pH 7.0 (23Haschenmeyer R.H. Haschenmeyer A.E.V. Proteins: A Guide to Study by Physical and Chemical Methods. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1974: 266-267Google Scholar). Second, the intracellular concentration of cAMP in many cells exceeds the intracellular concentration of cGMP by 10–100-fold. The combination of these factors may allow cAMP interaction with the allosteric sites of cGMP-binding PDEs in some cells. This assumption is also consistent with the observation that cAMP can allosterically modulate the activity of PDE2 in vitro (24Moss J. Manganiello V.C. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5211-5215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Yamamoto T. Manganiello V.C. Vaughan M. J. Biol.

In summary, the results of the present study provide initial insights pertaining to the molecular mechanism of cyclic nucleotide discrimination in the allosteric sites of PDE5. The important role of a conserved aspartic acid residue in this mechanism could represent a general phenomenon relevant to other cGMP-binding PDEs."

To elucidate the functional importance of these motifs and of conserved arginines and histidines, chemical modification and site-directed mutagenesis studies were performed. Chemical modification of arginines and histidines with phenylglyoxal and diethyl pyrocarbonate, respectively, renders the enzyme inactive in sulfurylase, kinase, and overall assays. Data base searches and sequence comparison of bifunctional ATP sulfurylase/APS kinase and monofunctional ATP sulfurylases shows a limited number of highly conserved arginines and histidines within the sulfurylase domain. Of these conserved residues, His-425, His-428, and Arg-421 are present within or near the HXXH motif whereas His-506, Arg-510, and Arg-522 residues are present in and around the PP-loop. The functional role of these conserved residues was further studied by site-directed mutagenesis. In the HXXH motif, none of the alanine mutants (H425A, H428A, and R421A) had sulfurylase or overall activity, whereas they all exhibited normal kinase activity. A slight improvement in reverse sulfurylase activity (<10% residual activity) and complete restoration of forward sulfurylase was observed with R421K. Mutants designed to probe the PP-loop requirements included H506A, R510A, R522A, R522K, and D523A. Of these, R510A exhibited normal sulfurylase and kinase activity, R522A and R522K showed no sulfurylase activity, and H506A had normal sulfurylase activity but produced an effect on kinase activity (<10% residual activity). The single aspartate, D523A, which is part of the highly conserved GRD sequence of the PP-loop, affected both sulfurylase and kinase activity. This mutational analysis indicates that the HXXH motif plays a role only in the sulfurylase activity, whereas the PP-loop is involved in both sulfurylase and kinase activities.

Continuing our elucidation of the important binding motifs and functional residues in the bifunctional enzyme, we have extended our analysis to the sulfurylase portion of the enzyme, where enzyme inactivation via chemical modification, in conjunction with sequence alignment, aided in identifying potentially important arginine and histidine residues (19Lyle S. The Sulfate Activation Pathway: A Bifunctional Enzyme Which Utilizes Intermediate Channeling. Ph.D. thesis. University of Chicago, Chicago, IL1993Google Scholar). Specific critical arginine and histidine residues were then determined through site-directed mutagenesis studies (3Deyrup A.T. Structural and Functional Analysis of Mammalian ATP Sulfurylase/APS Kinase. University of Chicago, Chicago, IL1997Google Scholar). Two conserved motifs present in the sulfurylase portion of the bifunctional enzyme are the PP-loop and an unnamed motif suggested to be involved in phosphodiester cleavage (20Bork P. Holm L.

Proteins. 1994; 20: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) through comparison of a series of ATP pyrophosphatase domains. A modified version of the PP-loop is found in the mouse SK1 ATP sulfurylase region from residues 514 to 532 in the form GANFYIVGRDPAGMPHPET (hhXhhhhGXDthhhtXt), where h is a hydrophobic residue and t is a turn residue.

The other motif, HXXH, is highly conserved among the monofunctional ATP sulfurylases and bifunctional PAPS synthetases, and through a sequence comparison with TagD-related nucleotidyltransferases, it is hypothesized that this motif is participating in the α-β phosphodiesterase activity (21Veitch D.P. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10743-10750Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The PP-loop and HXXH motifs contain several highly conserved arginines and histidines, both of which have functional side chains. Histidine is particularly interesting since its pK ais near physiological pH, allowing the residue to function as either a proton donor or a proton acceptor (24Miles E. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar, 25Veloso D. Cleland W. Porter J. Biochemistry. 1981; 26: 887-894Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 26Darnay B.G. Rodwell V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8429-8435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Histidines have been implicated in metal ion binding (27McGinnis K. Ku G.M. Van Dusen W.J. Fu J. Garsky V. Sterm A.M. Friedman P.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3957-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and electrostatic stabilization of intermediates (28Sideraki V. Wilson D.K. Kurz L.C. Quiocho F.A. Rufolph F.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15019-15028Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The catalytic importance of arginine has been shown in nucleotide substrate binding (29Moe O.A. Baker-Malcolm J.F. Wang W. Kang C. Fromm H.J. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9024-9033Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and it may form a catalytic triad with serine and asparagine (30Pickard R.T. Chiou X.G. Strifler B.A. DeFellippis M.R. Hyslop P.A. Tebbe A.L. Yee Y.K. Reynolds L.J. Dennis E.A. Kramer R.M. Sharp J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19225-19231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Arginine can also have structural importance, as demonstrated by its role in conformational changes in murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (31Chowdhury K. Kaushik N. Pandey V.N. Modak M.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16610-16620Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Evidence supporting a putative role for arginines and histidines in the ATP sulfurylase/APS kinase reaction mechanism comes from studies of both yeast and fungal ATP sulfurylases, which are inactivated by phenylglyoxal, which modifies arginines, and by diethylpyrocarbonate, which targets histidines (32Foster B.A. Thomas S.M. Mahr J.A. Renosto F. Patel H.C. Segel I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19777-19786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, in order to assess the putative roles of these motifs in MSK1, overall assays alone, as were recently reported for human SK1 (15Venkatachalam K.V. Fuda H. Koonin E.V. Strott C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2601-2604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), are necessary but not sufficient. Since PAPS synthetase is a bifunctional enzyme with at least two reactive centers and multiple binding sites, several factors could lead to loss of overall activity, including loss of kinase activity, loss of sulfurylase activity, or inefficient transfer of APS from sulfurylase to kinase. Furthermore, the possibility that a mutation in one functional portion of the protein can affect the other reaction, as we previously found for a P-loop mutation present in the kinase portion, which resulted in loss of sulfurylase activity (17Deyrup A.T. Krishnan S. Cockburn B.N. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9450-9456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), complicates interpretation. Thus, in order to more definitively assess the functionality of these motifs in the sulfurylase reaction, individual sulfurylase and kinase assays, as well as overall assays, were performed. Diethylpyrocarbonate, ATP, APS, phenylglyoxal, and ATP-agarose were purchased from Sigma, Ultrapure PAPS was from Dr. S. Singer, University of Dayton; BCA protein assay reagent was from Pierce. EasyTides® [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) used for radiolabeling, [α-35S]dATP used for DNA sequencing, and PAP35S (3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate) were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. [35S]APS was generated from [35S]PAPS as described (33Geller D.H. Henry J.G. Belch J. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7374-7382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs, unless otherwise indicated. T4 polynucleotide kinase was from Promega, AmpliTaq® was supplied by Perkin Elmer, and PfuDNA polymerase was obtained from Stratagene. All enzymes were used in the buffers recommended by the suppliers. Thrombin protease for removal of the histidine tag was purchased from Novagen, pET 15b bacterial expression vector was from Novagen, and the general cloning vector pBluescript was obtained from Stratagene. The PCR 2.1 vector for direct ligation of PCR products was a component of the Invitrogen TA Cloning® kit. The Sequenase Quick Denature kit used for dideoxynucleotide termination DNA sequencing was supplied by U. S. Biochemical Corp. DNA used for sequencing was prepared using the Promega Wizard (Plus) Minipreps kit. Plasmid DNA used for transformation was generated using the Qiagen Maxiprep kit. Radiolabeled probes were made with the Stratagene Prime-It II random hexamer kit. Invitrogen Original TA Cloning® kit was used for construction of some of the clones. Purification of DNA from agarose gels was performed with the Qiagen QIAquick kit. Metal chelate resin (His-bind®) for gravity purification of the expressed protein was purchased from Novagen. A similar resin (Poly-His) for high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. HPLC was performed on a Rainin Dynamax SD-200 system networked to a Macintosh IIci computer. The rat chondrosarcoma enzyme preparation used in all chemical and kinetic assays and modification studies was purified from rat chondrosarcoma as described through ammonium sulfate precipitation, and chromatography on S-300, hydroxylapatite, and ATP-affinity columns as described earlier (11Lyle S.

Stock DEP (diethylpyrocarbonate) solution (6.9m) was diluted in absolute ethanol under nitrogen to working concentrations and kept on ice. ATP-purified enzyme was diluted into 25 mmNa2HPO4-KH2PO4 buffer, pH 6.5, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA prior to modification. The amount of DEP/ethanol added to the enzyme preparation was kept to a minimum (usually at a ratio of 1:30 of final volume), in order to minimize degradation of enzyme activity or side reactions with DEP. The carbethoxylation reaction was carried out at 25 °C and monitored by loss of sulfurylase or kinase activity and by increasing absorbance at 242 nm. The UV absorbance profiles were measured by scanning from 320 nm to 210 nm in a Perkin-Elmer spectrophotometer. Phenylglyoxal was dissolved in deionized water to a stock concentration of 100 mm. The reaction with ATP-purified enzyme was performed at 25 °C, and inactivation was monitored by loss of sulfurylase or kinase activity compared with control. The enzyme was also covalently labeled with [14C]phenylglyoxal and examined by amino acid analysis. [14C]Phenylglyoxal (50 μCi) was dissolved in 0.5 ml of water, and 18 μCi was added to approximately 500 μg of ATP-purified enzyme preparation. The mixture was incubated for 90 min, dialyzed, and assayed after modification to determine the extent of inactivation compared with unmodified controls. The sample was electrophoresed in two lanes on a 10% SDS-gel with a third lane of unmodified enzyme; the gel was then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride for 70 min. The 56-kDa bands were excised and analyzed for amino acid composition.l-Arginine in water was modified with 2.0 μmol of unlabeled phenylglyoxal for 30 min at 25 °C, dried in a SpeedVac, and examined by amino acid analysis as a control. In order to create the appropriate site-directed mutants, a four-primer, two-reaction PCR protocol was used, as described (17Deyrup A.T. Krishnan S. Cockburn B.N. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9450-9456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, two overlapping PCR fragments were generated incorporating the codon for the new amino acid. A second PCR reaction generated the final 1.9-kilobase band which was ligated into the Pet15b expression vector. Following transformation into the host strain Top10F', positive clones were identified and the entire insert as well as junctions with the vector were sequenced to verify the mutagenesis and to ensure that no additional mutations had spontaneously arisen. This methodology was employed in the construction of all site-directed mutants (R421A, R421K, H425A, H428A, R468A, H506A, R510A, R522A, R522K, and D523A). All PCR reactions were performed in a Perkin-Elmer GeneAmp 2400 thermal cycler using either Taq polymerase from Perkin-Elmer or Pfu polymerase from Stratagene. Standard cycling parameters included a 1–5-min preincubation at 94 °C followed by 20 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. Following the cycling step, a 10-min extension step at 72 °C allowed completion of all unfinished transcripts. BLAST 2.0 and PSI-BLAST protein sequence similarity searches were performed via the National Center for Biotechnology Information web server (34Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59917) Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequence from each clone was assembled, and deduced amino acid sequence was generated and analyzed using the computer programs SEQED, LINEUP, TRANSLATE, GAP, COMPARE, and DOTPLOT of the Wisconsin (GCG) package. The Novagen pET15b system was used for bacterial expression of the cloned murine bifunctional enzyme. All DNA fragments to be expressed were ligated into the NdeI andXhoI sites of the plasmid, and all clones were sequenced in their entirety before transformation into JM109 DE3 cells by the CaCl2 method. Expressed protein was purified as described (17Deyrup A.T. Krishnan S. Cockburn B.N. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9450-9456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, overnight bacterial cultures were centrifuged and the resultant pellet sonicated in Tris buffer containing 5 mmimidazole (50 mm Tris, pH 7.9). Following removal of bacterial debris by ultracentrifugation, the supernatant was loaded onto a 1-ml affinity column of nitrilotriacetic acid resin charged with nickel, which binds to the imidazole moiety of histidine residues to capture the expressed protein. Columns were washed with 15 volumes of IMAC 20, 4 volumes of IMAC 30, and 4 volumes of IMAC 50. At this point, the protein was eluted with 4 column volumes of IMAC 200. The Pierce BCA protein assay reagent was used to determine the protein concentration for enzyme assays. The sulfurylase reaction was assayed in the physiologically reverse direction (10Lyle S. Geller D.H. Ng K. Westley J. Schwartz N.B. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Standard assays contained 50 mmNaH2PO4-K2HPO4 (pH 7.8), 12 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm NaF, 0.2 Na4P2O7 (containing 6.7 μCi of32P), 0.1 mm APS, and 50 μl of enzyme preparation. The reaction was initiated by addition of 50 μl of enzyme in IMAC 5 or buffer A (25 mmNaH2PO4-K2HPO4 (pH 7.8), 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), incubated at 37 °C and terminated by addition of ice-cold charcoal solution. The samples were pelleted, followed by three washes (0.05m sodium imidazole, pH 7.0, with 2.23 g of Na4P2O7/500 ml), extracted with 50% ethanol, 0.4% NH4OH, 0.1% Tween 80 and centrifuged. ATP-incorporated radioactivity in an aliquot of the supernatant was determined by scintillation counting and the specific activity calculated. The standard kinase assay contained 10 nm[35S]APS, 250 mm ATP (pH 7.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ammonium sulfate, and 12 μl of enzyme and was brought up to 25 μl with buffer A (9Lyle S. Geller D.H. Ng K. Stanzak J. Westley J. Schwartz N.B. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped with ice-cold ethanol, and PAPS (product) formation was measured by paper electrophoresis and scintillation counting. The coupled (overall) assay (10Lyle S. Geller D.H. Ng K. Westley J. Schwartz N.B. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) contained 0.4 nm[35S]H2SO4, 10 mmATP, 20 mm MgCl2, 22 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 10 μl of enzyme preparation in a total volume of 25 μl. The reaction was started by addition of the enzyme and terminated by addition of ice-cold ethanol and freezing. Product formation was measured as described for the kinase assay. The first reaction in the synthesis of PAPS is a substitution reaction catalyzed by ATP sulfurylase and involves conversion of ATP to APS by addition of SO4−2, followed by the release of the leaving group, pyrophosphate. Motifs previously implicated in the α-β phosphodiester cleavage reaction and binding/stabilization of ATP/PPi are present in the sulfurylase portion of the bifunctional enzyme, and sequence comparisons suggested that functionally important residues are located in these motifs. In order to determine whether arginines or histidines are catalytically important in the native bifunctional enzyme, residue-specific chemical modification studies were carried out (19Lyle S. The Sulfate Activation Pathway: A Bifunctional Enzyme Which Utilizes Intermediate Channeling. Ph.D. thesis. University of Chicago, Chicago, IL1993Google Scholar). Following modification, reverse ATP sulfurylase, APS kinase and overall activities were assayed. The reverse sulfurylase assay measures the synthesis of ATP and SO4 from APS and PPi, the APS kinase assay uses APS and ATP as substrates and measures the amount of PAPS formed, and the overall assay measures the amount of APS (forward sulfurylase) and PAPS formed starting from ATP and sulfate (8Lyle S.

Stanzak J. Westley J. Schwartz N.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 940-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). DEP reacts specifically and stoichiometrically with histidine and the extent of modification can be determined spectrophotometrically by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 242 nm (24Miles E. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). The difference spectra (Fig. 1 A) recorded at various time intervals during the modification of the enzyme preparation confirms that histidyl residues are being modified. Since there are no other changes in the spectral scans before and after treatment, DEP most likely reacts specifically with histidines. Concomitant with spectral changes, modification of histidines by DEP inactivated both the ATP sulfurylase and APS kinase functions (Fig.1 B). In addition, the decrease in activity was dependent on DEP concentration and incubation time (data not shown). These results suggest that the histidine(s) being modified by DEP are vital for both sulfurylase and kinase activity. Modification of proteins by phenylglyoxal is highly specific for arginyl residues (35Takahashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 6171-6179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phenylglyoxal inactivated both the ATP sulfurylase and APS kinase activities of the bifunctional enzyme in a time-dependent manner, which was similar in extent and rate (Fig. 1 C). In order to verify that arginyl residues were the target of modification, the enzyme was incubated with [14C]phenylglyoxal and subsequently examined by amino acid analysis. After a 60-min incubation, there was an 80% decrease in sulfurylase activity. The 14C-labeled residue co-chromatographed with the phenylglyoxal-modifiedl-arginine control upon amino acid analysis. A combination of MgATP and SO4−2 provided some protection to the sulfurylase activity from inactivation (data not shown), indicating that binding of ATP involves one or more arginyl residues. Since the chemical modification studies suggested arginine and histidine are important for sulfurylase activity, a strategy was devised for identifying which residues to target for mutagenesis analysis. Advanced BLAST and PSI-BLAST programs were used to search data bases for protein sequences having high similarity to MSK1; the 86 proteins identified using BLAST were mainly bifunctional ATP sulfurylase/APS kinases from higher organisms and monofunctional sulfurylases and kinases from lower organisms and plants. The first iteration step of PSI-BLAST identified the same set of 86, but in the second iteration step 381 protein sequences were retrieved. The second group (295) were mainly P-loop containing proteins. Relatively few sequences were reported with similarity to the sulfurylase portion of the bifunctional enzyme. Conservation of histidine and arginine positions was evaluated by comparing the number of sequences with conserved residues to the total number of sequences retrieved for that portion of the enzyme. Percentage of conservation for histidines and arginines in the sulfurylase portion of MSK1 is shown in Fig."

The downstream signal functioned without an RNA secondary structure formation, in which the signal was still active when separated from the upstream, hairpin-forming signal, and IMP incorporation enhanced its efficiency. The sequence from −15 to −1 was essential for the downstream, hairpin-independent termination (at −1). The results of SP6 transcription with heteroduplex templates and ribonucleotide analogs suggested that the downstream signal consists of two functionally different modules. The effects of iodo-CMP or IMP incorporation into RNA on termination efficiency were not sensitive to incorporation at −9 and upstream, but they were reactive to incorporation at −6 and −2, as reflected by strong iodo-rC:dG and weak rI:dC base pairing. Thus, the downstream module (from −8 ∼ −6 to −1) appears to facilitate the release of RNA. Mismatches in the templates at −6 to +1 allowed for efficient termination, unlike those upstream of the sequence. The upstream module (from −15 to −9 ∼ −7) functions as a duplex. Pausing of the SP6 elongation complex at the termination site was detected when RNA release was suppressed by the incorporation of 5-bromo-UMP, and it was dependent on the upstream module. Results of single-round SP6 transcriptions using 3′-deoxynucleotides and immobilized templates indicated that RNA was not released from the elongation complexes halted at the termination site on the template variants carrying mutations in the upstream or downstream module, whereas such complexes on the wild type template were dissociated.

Skorupa E.S. Kemper B. Protein Eng. 1986; 1: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar), its peculiar features, different from the usual bacterial factor-independent terminators, suggested an alternative mechanism to the termination event. The signal lacks an apparent stem-loop structure and encodes an interrupted run of six uridine residues. The nicked T7 RNA polymerase consisting of N-terminal 20-kDa and C-terminal 80-kDa fragments ignored this termination signal (2Macdonald L.E. Zhou Y. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 1030-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), even though still terminating at typical bacterial terminators (3Macdonald L.E. Rurbin R.K. Dunn J.J. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The terminator t1 of Escherichia coli rrnB operon was also reported to have an intrinsic ability to terminate the T7 RNA polymerase (4Christiansen J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7457-7476Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) through two different mechanisms (5Hartvig L. Christiansen J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4767-4774Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). T7 termination at two upstream sites required the formation of stable secondary structure in transcripts and did not need a non-template strand DNA (5Hartvig L. Christiansen J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4767-4774Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This phenomenon was also observed with E. coli RNA polymerase (6Uptain S.U. Chamberlin M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13548-13553Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). On the other hand, termination at the downstream site in therrnB t1 occurred even with the incorporation of IMP, which destabilizes secondary structures of transcript RNA, and required the non-template strand DNA (5Hartvig L. Christiansen J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4767-4774Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was proposed that the mechanism for the downstream termination would be different from the commonly known mechanism for the upstream, typical intrinsic termination (5Hartvig L. Christiansen J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4767-4774Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The rrnB t1 downstream termination signal shares a common sequence (ATCTGTT in the non-template strand) with the coding region of human PTH gene, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) DNA, and the concatemer junction (CJ) of the replicating T7 DNA (7Lyakhov D.L. He B. Zhang X. Studier F.W. Dunn J.J. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), which were reported to cause pausing or termination by T7 RNA polymerase without formation of RNA secondary structure. The PTH termination signal was also effective for T3 and SP6 RNA polymerases (8Lyakhov D.L. He B. Zhang X. Studier F.W. Dunn J.J. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 28-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, two different types of intrinsic termination signals have been observed to terminate transcription by the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase and its relatives. The two types are different in their requirement for the RNA hairpin structure formation and in their recognition of a nicked form of T7 RNA polymerase. In this study, we examined the termination of phage SP6 and T7 RNA polymerases at various mutants of the unusual downstream signal in theE. coli rrnB t1 terminator and defined the elements that are essential for this type of termination. Our results for SP6 transcription with heteroduplexes, ribonucleotide analogs, and immobilized templates provide some insights into this mechanism involving two functionally different structural modules. The bacteriophage SP6 and T7 RNA polymerases were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The nicked SP6 RNA polymerase was purified from JM109/pACS6R (9Jeong W. Kang C. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1997; 42: 711-716PubMed Google Scholar) by the method described previously (10Butler E.T. Chamberlin M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5772-5778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The SP6 polymerase was completely cleaved into two fragments during purification from the JM109 cell extract, just like the nicked T7 polymerase (11Grodberg J. Dunn J.J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1245-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). The template plasmids pT1-SP6 and pT1-T7 were constructed by inserting the 179-bp EcoRI fragment containing rrnB t1 terminator of pKK232-8 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) into pGEM4Z (Promega) at the EcoRI site in the direction of SP6 and T7 transcription, respectively. Template 1w1 was constructed by inserting an 89-bp HaeIII fragment of pKK232-8 into pGEM4Z at the HincII site. The 2w6 was constructed by inserting a synthetic oligomer of non-template strand NT (5′-CGTTTTATCTGTTGTTTG-3′) and its complementary oligomer, T, into theSmaI site of pGEM4Z. The 2w7 and 2f7 were constructed by inserting an NT/T duplex and a synthetic mutant, f, respectively, into pGEM4Z at the SmaI and filled-in SalI sites. The NT/T and synthetic mutants b, c, d, x, y, and z were inserted into pGEM4Z at the HincII site to construct templates 3w8, 3b8, 3c8, 3d8, 3x8, 3y8, and 3z8, respectively. The 4a9, 4c9, 4d9, 4e9, 4f9, 4m9, and 4y9 templates were constructed with the corresponding synthetic mutants (from a to y) inserted into theHincII site of pGEM3Z (Promega). A polymerase chain reaction product amplified from the 1w1 template using an M13 universal forward primer (5′-GTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC-3′) and the T primer was digested with EcoRI and inserted into theEcoRI/HincII site of pGEM4Z. The 1w4 and 1w5, having a deletion and insertion, respectively, of one G at theHincII junction were obtained instead of the expected one. Another polymerase chain reaction product made with the NT primer and an M13 universal reverse primer (5′-AGCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGGA-3′) using 1w1 as a template was inserted into the SmaI andHincII sites of pGEM4Z and the HincII site of pGEM3Z to construct 2w1, 3w1, and 4w1, respectively. Polymerase chain reaction-meditated site-directed mutagenesis (12Datta A.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4530-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) was performed on the 1w1 template to construct 1w2, 1w3, 1g1, 1g2, 1g3, 1h1, 1i1, 1i2, 1i3, 1j1, 5kl, 1p10, 5q10, 1r11, 1s11, and 1t11. T7 transcription templates were constructed by insertingXbaI-HindIII fragments of 1w1, 1w2, 1w3, 1g1, 1g2, 1g3, 1h1, 1i1, 1i2, 1i3, 1j1 1r11, 1s11, and 1t11 into pET3a (13Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar) at the XbaI/HindIII site located downstream from its T7 promoter. Template plasmids were linearized with various restriction enzymes to produce run-off transcripts. For experiments with heteroduplex templates, one linear template was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the M13 forward and 5′-biotinylated reverse primers, and the other template was amplified using the M13 reverse and 5′-biotinylated forward primers. After two corresponding templates were mixed, denatured, and reannealed, the mixtures were bound to streptavidin (Promega). The double-biotinylated heteroduplex was isolated from the other, non-biotinylated heteroduplex and single-biotinylated homoduplexes by differential band shift on a 1% agarose gel as described previously (14Ring B.Z. Yarnell W.S. Roberts J.W. Cell. 1996; 86: 485-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Transcription with standard and modified ribonucleotides (Sigma) except for 4-thio-UTP (United States Biochemical) was carried out in 10-μl reactions consisting of 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 6 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm spermidine-HCl, 0.5 mm rNTPs (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Ultrapure), 2 μCi of [α-32P]CTP or [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 4 units of RNasin (Promega), 0.5–1.0 pmol of template, and 10 units of phage RNA polymerase at 37 °C for 30 min. GMP (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 1 mm to initiate transcription in reactions with rITP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) instead of GTP (15Milligan J.F. Uhlenbeck O.C. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). For the reaction with 0.5 mm 4-thio-UTP in the place of UTP, 40 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.2) was used instead of Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) in the transcription buffer. Transcriptional sequencing reactions were carried out with chain-terminating 3′-deoxynucleotides (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in the range of 50–100 nm in addition to 0.3 mmrNTPs and 10 μCi of [α-32P]CTP or [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol). Transcription reactions were stopped by the addition of 10 μl of EDTA-formamide containing 0.025% xylene cyanol and 0.025% bromphenol blue and heated at 90 °C for 2 min. The products were analyzed by 8 m urea-12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were quantified by PhosphorImager analysis using a Storm 860 scanner (Molecular Dynamics). Termination efficiencies were calculated as the molar ratio between terminated transcript and the sum of terminated and read-through transcripts, and an average of three measurements was taken. A 40-μl mixture of 5 pmol of DNA templates, 0.5 mm GTP, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm UTP, 80 units of SP6 RNA polymerase, and 8 units of RNasin was preincubated in transcription buffer, as described above, at room temperature for 8 min. Another 40-μl mixture contained 500 μg/ml heparin, 0.5 mm CTP, and 80 μCi of [α-32P]CTP (3000 Ci/mmol). For the time course experiments for the detection of pausing, 1-μl aliquots of the two mixtures were mixed at room temperature and quickly quenched at various time points with the above transcription-stopping, gel-loading buffer. Products of three transcription reactions at each time point were pooled and analyzed by 8 m urea-12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Templates 1w1, 1g1, 4a9, and 4m9 were biotinylated at the 5′-end of the template strands only by polymerase chain reactions using appropriate biotinylated primers. Approximately 1 pmol of biotin-labeled templates were immobilized onto the streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Dynal) and washed three times with washing buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, and 6 mm MgCl2) to remove unbound templates. The beads in 5-μl volume were preincubated without rNTPs under the conditions for multi-round transcription, described above, at room temperature for 8 min. They were mixed with a 5-μl nucleotide mixture consisting of 40 μCi of [α-32P]CTP, 0.5 mm rNTPs each, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, and 6 mm MgCl2, and the reactions were carried out at room temperature for 10 min. For single-round transcription, the 5-μl nucleotide mixture additionally contained either 0.5 mm3′-dATP, 0.2 mm 3′-dCTP, 0.2 mm 3′-dGTP, or 0.1 mm 3′-dUTP. Heparin was added to a final concentration of 250 μg/ml 30 s after the mixing to prevent released RNA polymerases from recycling. Supernatants were separated from magnetic beads at 10 min and mixed with 10-μl gel-loading buffer. Beads were washed with the 10-μl washing buffer before mixed with gel loading buffer. Intrinsic termination of the SP6 RNA polymerase transcription occurred on the terminator t1 (Fig.1) at multiple sites (Fig.2 A, lane W). Termination sites were precisely determined by parallel transcription reactions with chain-terminating 3′-deoxynucleotides (Fig.2 A), as previously reported (16Axelrod V.D. Kramer F.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5716-5723Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The downstream termination occurring almost uniquely at the U residue (boxed in Fig. 1) was more efficient (73%) than the upstream termination at the other two U residues (22% together).Figure 2Transcription termination of SP6 RNA polymerase at the rrnB t1 terminator.Transcription of HindIII-digested pT1-SP6 was performed using regular rNTPs (panel A) or using ITP and GMP instead of GTP (panel B) with the intact (lane W) and nicked (lane N) SP6 RNA polymerases. Transcripts with regular rNMPs were labeled at the 5′-end by [γ-32P]GTP, but those with IMP were internally labeled by [α-32P]CTP. Sequencing RNA ladders produced from the same template by supplement of 3′-dNTP into transcription reactions of intact SP6 polymerase were labeled internally by [α-32P]CTP and run in parallel (lanes G, A, U, C, and W). Termination products (indicated byarrows) having rNMP migrated slightly slower than the same size ladders having 3′-dNMP at the 3′-ends in 8 m urea-15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (18Monforte J.A. Kahn J.D. Hearst J.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7882-7890Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When the SP6 transcription was carried out in the presence of ITP instead of GTP (Fig. 2 B), termination still occurred at the downstream site but not at the upstream sites. To confirm that the downstream termination is independent of the RNA hairpin-forming sequence located upstream, we constructed a deletion variant of the terminator t1. In the template 1w1, which lacked a part of the RNA-hairpin forming sequence, termination still occurred at the same site, although the efficiency (58%) was lower than that of an entire t1 terminator (73%). The “nicked” SP6 RNA polymerase almost completely read through the downstream termination signal (Fig. 2 A, lane N). On the other hand, the upstream termination increased and occurred at more sites. The nicked SP6 RNA polymerase did not produce any significant amount of termination products in the presence of ITP (Fig.2 B, lane N). To define the essential elements of the downstream termination signal, we constructed various mutants (Fig.3). The template variants from 1w2 to 3w8 all contained the rrnB t1 sequence from −19 to −2 (when the rrnB t1 downstream termination site for SP6 polymerase is designated −1), 5′-CGTTTTATCTGTTGTTTG-3′ (in the non-template strand) but were different in the flanking sequences. Termination of SP6 transcription occurred in all cases. On the other hand, when the sequence was deleted in templates 3–8 and 4–9, termination was totally abolished. This signal shares a “conserved” sequence ATCTGTT from −13 to −7 with PTH, VSV, and CJ (5Hartvig L. Christiansen J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4767-4774Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 7Lyakhov D.L. He B. Zhang X. Studier F.W. Dunn J.J. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A set of template mutants from 4a9 to 4f9 in Fig. 3 contained a deletion, a substitution, and insertions in the conserved sequence. All nine of these mutations abolished termination. The next set of mutants from 1g1 to 5k1 carried substitutions just upstream of the conserved sequence. When the Ts at −15 and −14 were both changed to Gs (from 1g1 to 1h1), termination was almost abolished (also in 1t11). When they were changed to Cs (from 1i1 to 1j1), however, termination still occurred. A more extensive substitutions in 5k1 did not abolish termination (the sequence from −19 to −7 was identical to the corresponding region of PTH terminator). Another common feature of the rrnB t1, PTH, and VSV signals is that all contain a stretch of 3 or more Ts in the region between the conserved sequence and termination site. Deletion of TTTG at −5 to −2 abolished termination (in 4m9). On the other hand, the mutant 1n1 carried G-to-C substitutions at −6 and −2, maintaining the 3 Ts in the region, and the termination efficiency (64%) was only marginally higher than that of 1w1 (57%). When the region was changed to contain more Ts (from 1p10 to 1s11), however, termination efficiency was increased (73–89%). The 1r11, 1s11, and 3z8 containing nine or four contiguous T residues in the region yielded slippage products rather than distinct termination products. Apparent termination transcripts were multiple and mostly longer than the expected products. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometric analysis of the 3z8 transcripts revealed that four transcripts were produced by the addition of U residues irrespective of the template sequence (Fig. 4). Also, more than eight mass peaks were shown at about a 306-Da interval with a 15,666-Da peak from the 1r11 transcripts (data not shown). Thus, slippage appeared to occur just before termination, and the slippage transcripts were included in calculation of termination efficiency. When the homopolymeric T-run was interrupted with one or two C residues (1n1, 1p10, and 5q10), slippage was not observed. The major termination site did not change in all of the above templates (boxed in Fig. 3), regardless of the terminating nucleotide species. Although an insertion of a T just upstream of the conserved sequence did not change the termination site (3x8), the same insertion just downstream of the conserved sequence caused an appearance of a 1-bp upstream shift of the termination site (3y8, 4y9, and 3z8). However, the apparent shift resulted in the same distance between the conserved sequence and the major termination site, suggesting that the termination should occur at a fixed distance from the conserved sequence. T7 RNA polymerase termination at the rrnB t1 downstream and PTH signals has previously been proposed to be mediated by the presence of both strands of duplex DNA (5Hartvig L. Christiansen J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4767-4774Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 17He B. Kukarin A. Temiakov D. Chin-Bow S.T. Lyakhov D.L. Rong M. Durbin R.K. McAllister W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18802-18811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To address this issue for SP6 polymerase termination, various heteroduplex templates were constructed, in which small internal loops and bulges could be formed in the essential region of the rrnB t1 downstream termination signal (Fig. 5). In the first two control heteroduplexes, formation of a 1-nt bulge upstream of the essential region was shown not to affect the termination. Termination efficiencies and sites of the heteroduplexes 3w8/3x8 and 3x8/3w8 (non-template strand/template strand) were the same as those of parent templates 3w8 and 3x8. The next set of six heteroduplexes in Fig. 5 contained either a 1-bp internal loop or a 1- or 2-nt bulge in the conserved region. They were formed with either strand of termination-proficient template 3w8 and the complementary strand of termination-deficient templates 3b8, 3c8, or 3d8. Termination efficiencies were 5% or less. Also, a 2-bp internal loop formed just upstream of the conserved sequence exerted some effects on termination. When strands of the termination-proficient templates 1w1 (57%) and 1i1 (50%) were hybridized to form heteroduplexes 1w1/1i1 and 1i1/1w1, efficiency of termination still occurring at the same site was reduced to 27 and 9%, respectively. The loop could have influenced the stability of duplex in the conserved region to a certain extent. The necessity of the duplex nature for efficient termination appeared to be limited to this upstream portion of the essential region. It is called the “upstream module” here, and the “downstream module” reaches down to the termination site. The last pair of heteroduplexes 1w1/1r11 and 1r11/1w1 carrying 3-bp mismatches at −6, −2, and +1 was still capable of terminating the polymerase at the same site (72 and 55%, respectively). The efficiencies appeared to depend more on the template strand sequence than on the non-template strand. Interestingly, slippage of the RNA polymerase observed with the 1r11 template occurred only with 1w1/1r11, suggesting that the template strand sequence determines the polymerase slippage also. To investigate the role of the RNA transcript in this type of termination, transcription reactions were carried out with a wild type template 1w1 using analog nucleotides that either strengthen or weaken base pairing interactions. The SP6 polymerase was capable of incorporating IMP, 5-bromo-UMP, 5-iodo-CMP, and 4-thio-UMP into transcripts (Fig.6). Incorporation of IMP, which destabilizes the RNA-DNA hybrid, stimulated termination (88%). Moreover, the major termination site was moved upstream by one residue, and a minor termination at the next downstream site appeared to increase by a small amount (Figs. 2 B and 6 A). Transcription with 5-bromo-UTP, stabilizing rU:dA base pairing, abolished termination and produced only run-off transcripts (Fig.6 B), indicating that instability of rU:dA is important for this type of termination. In contrast, incorporation of 5-iodo-CMP, stabilizing rC:dG, did not affect the efficiency (57%) or site of termination (Fig. 6 C). These differential effects of 5-bromo-UMP and 5-iodo-CMP led us to see whether the analog effects depend on the positions of incorporation, because the C residue is incorporated only at −11, whereas many U residues are incorporated in the essential region. Some of the variants were subjected to transcription with ITP and 5-iodo-CTP (Fig. 6 D). As IMP incorporation increased the termination efficiency of 1w1 by 30 percentage points, the increase in termination efficiency was about the same in the control 1i1 carrying T-to-C substitutions. The stimulating effect was almost abolished in 1n1 with G-to-C changes at −6 and −2 (in the downstream module). The ITP effect was most dramatic with 4m9 where the oligo(T) at −5 to −3 was omitted. Although 4m9 did not allow for termination with GTP, IMP incorporation evoked termination (64%). However, it did not evoke termination on 1g1 having two G residues at −14 and −15 (in the upstream module). Replacement of CMP by iodo-CMP reduced termination efficiency by 8 percentage points on 1n1, probably due to the presence of C residues at −6 and −2, but did not affect the termination on 1w1 and 1i1, which lacked Cs in the downstream module. Incidentally, substitution of another base pair destabilizing analog 4-thio-UTP for UTP reduced the amount of transcription products tremendously. Several faint bands were shown just upstream of the termination site (data not shown). Because those bands were also shown in all four sequencing lanes and because the intensities were as low as those of single-round reaction products were, the analog appears to arrest complexes just upstream of the termination site. To detect the pause of elongation complexes that leads to termination, time-course experiments were performed with 1w1, 1g1, and 4a9 under single-round transcription conditions. Instead of UTP, 5-bromo-UTP was used to inhibit RNA release. A pause complex was detected on 1w1 at the site of termination (Fig. 7). At the first 2-s point, 14% of the complexes paused, and 1–2% remained at 1 min. An estimate of the pause half-life was 0.8 s, and extrapolation of the data in an exponential curve yielded approximately 86% at zero point. Such pause complexes were not observed on 1g1 (Fig. 7) and 4a9 carrying mutations in the upstream module. On the other hand, a pause was also observed on the downstream module-missing 4m9, when usual, high concentrations of normal ribonucleotides were used (data not shown). However, the pause was not as prominent as in the above case, and the pause sites were multiple at a few bp downstream of the 1w1 termination site. To determine whether simple pausing is sufficient for termination, the elongation complexes were halted by sequence-specific incorporation of 3′-deoxynucleotides (18Monforte J.A. Kahn J.D. Hearst J.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7882-7890Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 19Tyagarajan K. Monforte J.A. Hearst J.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10920-10924Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 20Wilson K.S. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 36-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Single-round transcriptions were carried out to avoid recycling of released polymerases. Stable complexes on immobilized, biotin-labeled templates were separated from the released products using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. All of the complexes with the immobilized 1w1 remained attached to the beads (Fig.8 A) except for a few. Termination products (having ribonucleotides at the 3′-end) were found mostly in the supernatant portion, and RNA having a 3′-deoxynucleotide was mostly also released from the complexes halted at the termination site. On the other hand, no RNA was released from 4a9 defective in the upstream module (Fig. 8 B) and from 4m9 lacking the downstream module (Fig. 8 C). In the case of single-round sequencing transcription of 1w1 with the nicked polymerase, approximately 50% of the RNA was released on average throughout the bands (Fig. 8 D). Especially at the termination site, there was not any more RNA released in the case of nicked polymerase than in the intact polymerase. When pT1-T7 containing therrnB t1 was subjected to T7 transcription, both the upstream and downstream terminations appeared to occur at multiple sites (data not shown). Some of the templates in Fig. 3 (all containing upstream flanking sequence of the number 1 type) were transferred to a T7 promoter-containing plasmid, pET3a. The T7 polymerase terminated transcription in all of the templates except 1g1, 1g2, 1g3, 1h1, and 1t11, having G substitutions for T at −15 and −14, like the SP6 polymerase. Thus, the termination signal alone was effective for T7 polymerase also, although termination efficiencies were not quantitatively measured. The major termination site of the downstream signal and extent of slippage were different from SP6 transcription (data not shown). The 1r11 and 1s11 produced numerous slippage bands by T7 transcription, whereas the SP6 polymerase produced only about 13 discrete bands. When transcripts were labeled with [α-32P]UTP, radioactivity of large slippage products was much higher than when labeled with [α-32P]CTP, suggesting that UMP was incorporated during slippage. The termination-abolishing substitution of G for T at −15 and −14 also suppressed slippage. The phage SP6 RNA polymerase intrinsically stops transcription in the rrnB t1 terminator at two different signals, which are called here the upstream and downstream signals (Fig. 1). Usage of ITP instead of GTP abolished the upstream termination but not the downstream termination. Furthermore, termination was not lost when the downstream signal was isolated apart from the upstream, RNA hairpin-forming signal. Thus, the downstream termination does not involve formation of an RNA hairpin structure, unlike the upstream signal. The nicked SP6 RNA polymerase shows another distinct difference in that it disregards the downstream signal but not the upstream signal. The major upstream termination sites of SP6 and T7 transcription determined by parallel sequencing ladders of RNA (Fig. 2) are identical or similar to E. coli termination sites (21Schmidt M.C. Chamberlin M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 809-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The SP6 downstream termination occurred mostly at 6 bp downstream from the conserved sequence, regardless of terminating nucleotide species, whereas the major T7 termination site was 7 bp downstream from the conserved sequence. As most of the changes within the sequence from −15 to −2 abolish termination (Fig. 3), the region is essential for this type of termination. It was previously suggested that both template and non-template strands of the rrnB t1 downstream and PTH signals be required for T7 termination (5Hartvig L. Christiansen J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4767-4774Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 17He B. Kukarin A. Temiakov D. Chin-Bow S.T. Lyakhov D.L. Rong M. Durbin R.K. McAllister W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18802-18811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Our results for SP6 transcription with heteroduplexes (Fig. 5), however, indicate that the sequence from −6 to +1 need not be in perfect duplex for efficient termination. They suggested instead that only the 9-bp upstream module from −15 to −7, or a part of it, should be in duplex. Also the module includes the conserved sequence and thus apparently requires only a few specific sequences. On the other hand, the downstream module from −6 to −1 can be varied, but only to certain T-rich sequences, without losing termination proficiency. Our results with ITP and iodo-CTP indicated that the analog effects on termination efficiency were not sensitive to incorporation at −9 and upstream but were greatly affected by sequence changes at −6 and −2 (Fig. 6 D). Also, termination efficiency was always higher on the templates with −1 T (53–66%) than those with −1 G or −1 A (27–37%) among the templates from 1w1 to 3w8 listed in Fig. 3. Thus, the upstream module could be from −15 to −9 ∼ −7 and the downstream module from −8 ∼ −6 to −1, and the T residues at −7 and −8 could belong to either, neither, or both modules. Slippage observed in this study appears also to be caused by the two modules. Slippage occurred at four contiguous T residues from −5 to −2 on 3z8 (Fig. 4) but not at three Ts in the wild type downstream module. On the other hand, five contiguous T residues from −18 to −14 (3x8) and 4 Ts from −8 to −5 (1p10 and 5q10) did not cause slippage. Slippage occurred also on 1r11 and 1s11 but was suppressed on 1t11, even though the three templates all have nine contiguous Ts from −8 to +1. The T-to-G substitutions at −15 and −14 in 1t11 suppressed not only termination but also slippage. The downstream module appears to function through the instability of the DNA-RNA hybrid. The effects of ribonucleotide analogs on termination efficiency were sensitive only to the downstream module sequence. Also, the template strand of this module, dictating the RNA sequence, was more important for termination efficiency than the non-template strand of heteroduplex 1w1/1r11. Termination efficiency depended on the downstream module sequence, including the termination site, whereas mutations in the upstream module just abolished termination (except for silent mutations of T-to-C substitution at −15 and −14). The sequence in the downstream module might determine the efficiency of RNA release. The T-rich sequence could facilitate RNA release, because rU:dA is the weakest base pairing. Factors affecting RNA-DNA interaction in the module exerted effects on termination (and slippage) as expected from the altered strength of base pairing. In this respect, a contiguous T sequence in the downstream module may be most effective in RNA release but evokes slippage. Thus, the downstream module needs to be punctuated by the other base pairs to allow for distinct termination without slippage. It is evident in transcriptions with ITP that the site of termination depends on the downstream module, because it contains only G and T residues. Termination occurred at −2, −1, +3, or +4 in the presence of ITP, depending on the templates carrying mutations in the downstream module. For example, IMP incorporation moved the termination site 1 bp upstream in the sequence context TTGTTTGT, from −8 to −1, but did not move the site in the G-lacking context TTCTTTCT(the termination site with ITP is underlined). The upstream module functions as duplex DNA and appears to be necessary for the observed pausing of elongation complex. A pause complex was detected on 1w1 when RNA release was inhibited by incorporation of 5-bromo-UMP because of enhanced base pairing in the downstream module (Fig. 7). Mutations in the upstream module (of 1g1 and 4a9) suppressed this pausing under the same conditions. The conserved sequence (−13 to −7) constituting the upstream module is shared with the CJ pausing signal, and shortening of the T-run in the corresponding downstream module of the PTH termination signal previously converted the termination site to a pause site in T7 transcription (7Lyakhov D.L. He B. Zhang X. Studier F.W. Dunn J.J. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This pausing might also explain the slippage at the short T-runs observed here. Transcriptional slippage during elongation can occur at a homopolymeric run as short as three nucleotides on DNA in conjunction with a pause-inducing element, although it can occur at a homopolymeric run as long as 11 A or T residues without a pausing element (22Jacques J.-P. Kolakofsky D. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It might also explain that the elongation complex was arrested by incorporation of 4-thio-UMP at several sites just upstream of the termination site. Simple pausing does not appear to be sufficient for termination to occur even when the RNA release module is intact. RNA was released from the 1w1 complexes halted at the termination site by incorporation of a chain-terminating nucleotide but not from the complexes of upstream module-defective 4a9 (Fig. 8). Therefore, the complexes leading to termination should be in a different conformation from such halted complexes. Are the observed pause complexes in termination-prone conformation? A pause was detected on 1w1 at the termination site (−1). Complexes on the downstream module-missing 4m9 paused at four consecutive sites, +1 through +4. Although 4m9 did not allow for termination in the presence of normal nucleotides, termination occurred in the presence of ITP at +3 and +4 (Fig. 6 D). Thus, it is possible that the observed pause complexes would dissociate when RNA release becomes effective. Because such pausing does not occur at the same sites on 1w1 and 4m9, the downstream module appears to affect the upstream module-mediated pausing/conformation change. Alternatively, if the pathways to termination and to observed pause are different from each other, our data on pausing will be irrelevant to this type of termination. However, the rest of our data suggest that the upstream module cause such a conformation change leading to termination. It is especially so because termination was recovered on 4m9 by incorporation of IMP instead of GMP in the mutated downstream module. The termination site of transcription in the presence of ITP was observed to vary from −2 to +4. Thus, the necessary conformational change could occur upstream of −2 but potentially allow termination in a range of the downstream sites. The termination site would be determined by the effectiveness of the RNA release module. The upstream module may play such a role by specifically binding to the polymerase. One possibility for such interaction is to involve the “AT-rich recognition loop” conserved in the phage RNA polymerases. Recently, an N-terminal domain of the T7 RNA polymerase was shown in crystal structure to recognize an AT-rich sequence at −17 to −13 of the T7 promoter by inserting a flexible surface loop (residues 93–101) into the widened minor groove (23Cheetham G.M.T. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Although the upstream module sequence is different from the promoter sequences, hydrogen-bonding contexts of the widened minor grooves could be similar to each other. This interaction could be distorted or dislocated by the nick in the N-terminal domain that suppresses termination proficiency. If so, this could be analogous to the E. coli RNA polymerase pauses at +16/17 of phage λ late gene and at +25 of phage 82 late gene through interaction between the still-bound ς70 and the non-template strand of −10 hexamer-like sequences (24Ring B.Z.

https://openalex.org/W1965229650,"Interprotein electron transfer (ET) occurs between the tryptophan tryptophylquinone (TTQ) prosthetic group of aromatic amine dehydrogenase (AADH) and copper of azurin. The ET reactions from two chemically distinct reduced forms of TTQ were studied: an O-quinol form that was generated by reduction by dithionite, and an N-quinol form that was generated by reduction by substrate. It was previously shown that on reduction by substrate, an amino group displaces a carbonyl oxygen on TTQ, and that this significantly alters the rate of its oxidation by azurin (Hyun, Y-L., and Davidson V. L. (1995) Biochemistry 34, 12249–12254). To determine the basis for this change in reactivity, comparative kinetic and thermodynamic analyses of the ET reactions from the O-quinol and N-quinol forms of TTQ in AADH to the copper of azurin were performed. The reaction of theO-quinol exhibited values of electronic coupling (H AB) of 0.13 cm−1 and reorganizational energy (λ) of 1.6 eV, and predicted an ET distance of approximately 15 Å. These results are consistent with the ET event being the rate-determining step for the redox reaction. Analysis of the reaction of the N-quinol by Marcus theory yielded anH AB which exceeded the nonadiabatic limit and predicted a negative ET distance. These results are diagnostic of a gated ET reaction. Solvent deuterium kinetic isotope effects of 1.5 and 3.2 were obtained, respectively, for the ET reactions fromO-quinol and N-quinol AADH indicating that transfer of an exchangeable proton was involved in the rate-limiting reaction step which gates ET from the N-quinol, but not theO-quinol. These results are compared with those for the ET reactions from another TTQ enzyme, methylamine dehydrogenase, to amicyanin. The mechanism by which the ET reaction of theN-quinol is gated is also related to mechanisms of other gated interprotein ET reactions.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 816-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). AADH exhibits an α2β2 structure with subunit molecular weights of 39,000 and 18,000. Each small subunit contains a covalently bound tryptophan tryptophylquinone (TTQ) (3McIntire W.S. Wemmer D.E. Chistoserdov A.Y. Lidstrom M.E. Science. 1991; 252: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) prosthetic group, which is involved both in catalysis and in subsequent electron transfer (ET) to its physiologic electron acceptor. The physical, spectral, and structural properties of AADH are very similar to those of methylamine dehydrogenase (MADH) (4Davidson V.L. Davidson V.L. Principles and Applications of Quinoproteins. Marcel Dekker, New York1993: 73-95Google Scholar) which is the only other known TTQ-containing enzyme. No structural information is yet available for AADH, however, the crystal structures of MADH alone (5Chen L. Dol M. Durley R.C.E. Chistoserdov A.Y. Lidstrom M.E. Davidson V.L. Mathews F.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 131-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and in complex with its protein electron acceptor (6Chen L. Durley R. Poloks B.J. Hamada K. Chen Z. Mathews F.S. Davidson V.L.

Science. 1994; 264: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) have been determined. Each TTQ enzyme uses a type 1 copper protein as its physiologic electron acceptor: azurin for AADH (8Edwards S.L. Davidson V.L. Hyun Y.-L. Wingfield P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4293-4298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and amicyanin for MADH (4Davidson V.L. Davidson V.L. Principles and Applications of Quinoproteins.

However, azurin does not function as an effective electron acceptor for MADH, and amicyanin does not function as an effective electron acceptor for AADH (9Hyun Y-L. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12249-12254Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, despite the fact AADH-azurin and MADH-amicyanin are analogous sets of ET reaction partners, in that they use the same redox cofactors, there is a strong specificity for which copper protein serves as the electron acceptor for each TTQ enzyme. Transient kinetic studies yielded significantly different values for the limiting first-order rate constant for the oxidation of reduced AADH by azurin depending upon whether AADH had been reduced chemically with dithionite, or with the substrate tyramine (9Hyun Y-L. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12249-12254Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These data suggested that two chemically distinct reduced forms of TTQ in AADH could be formed, respectively, by dithionite or substrate (Fig. 1).15N-NMR studies proved that the substrate-derived amino group remains covalently bound to the TTQ prosthetic group of AADH, and is only released after oxidation (10Bishop G.R. Zhu Z. Whitehead T.L. Hicks R.T. Davidson V.L. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1159-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Thus, the incorporation of the substrate-derived amino group into the reduced TTQ of AADH significantly affects its reactivity with azurin. A similar phenomenon was observed for the ET reactions from different reduced forms of MADH to oxidized amicyanin. Significantly different reaction rate constants were obtained depending upon whether MADH was reduced chemically with dithionite, or with the substrate methylamine (11Bishop G.R. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12082-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 12Bishop G.R. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13586-13592Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thermodynamic analysis of these redox reactions indicated that the oxidation of dithionite-reduced quinol (O-quinol) TTQ by amicyanin was rate-limited by the ET event (13Brooks H.B. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5696-5701Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 14Brooks H.B. Davidson V.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 11201-11202Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar), but that the oxidation of the substrate-reduced aminoquinol (N-quinol) TTQ by amicyanin was a gated ET reaction (11Bishop G.R. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12082-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 12Bishop G.R. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13586-13592Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Furthermore, kinetic solvent isotope effect (KSIE) studies proved that proton transfer from the substrate-derived amino nitrogen on TTQ in MADH was the rate-limiting reaction step that gates ET in the latter reaction (11Bishop G.R. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12082-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 12Bishop G.R. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13586-13592Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We present comparative kinetic and thermodynamic analyses of the ET reactions from the O-quinol and N-quinol forms of TTQ in AADH to the copper in azurin (Fig.1). These results demonstrate that the covalent modification of the TTQ prosthetic group by substrate causes the ET from the reduced AADH to azurin to become gated by a proton transfer reaction step. The mechanism by which the ET reactions selectively of the N-quinol forms of TTQ enzymes are gated is compared and contrasted with the few other examples of well characterized gated interprotein ET reactions. The relevance of the significant difference in the reorganizational energies for the ET reactions from the O-quinol forms of TTQ to copper in the AADH-azurin and MADH-amicyanin systems is also discussed. Purifications of AADH (1Govindaraj S. Eisenstein E. Jones L.H. Chistoserdov A.Y. Davidson V.L. Edwards S.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2922-2929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and azurin (8Edwards S.L.

Chem. 1995; 270: 4293-4298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) from A. faecalis (IFO 14479) were as described previously, and protein concentrations were calculated from previously determined extinction coefficients (1Govindaraj S.

Biochem. 1981; 120: 339-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). D2O (99.9%) was obtained from C/D/N Isotopes. The chemicals that were used in this study were obtained from either Aldrich or Sigma. Transient kinetic experiments were performed using an On-Line Instrument Systems (OLIS, Bogart GA) RSM1000 rapid-scanning stopped-flow spectrophotometer. The experimental procedures for the rapid mixing experiments were as described previously (9Hyun Y-L. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12249-12254Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) for the reactions of the O-quinol AADH with azurin. For the reactions of the N-quinol, it was necessary to use anaerobic conditions. This is because the N-quinol AADH exhibited significant reactivity with O2, and during the incubation times before mixing some conversion of N-quinol toN-semiquinone occurred. Anaerobicity was achieved by deaerating buffers and including in the buffers a mixture of glucose oxidase (1 unit/ml), glucose (30 mm), and catalase (24 units/ml). Unless otherwise indicated, reactions were performed in 0.25m potassium phosphate, pH 7.5. N-Quinol AADH was prepared by the addition of 1 m equivalent of tyramine per TTQ. O-Quinol AADH was prepared by titration with sodium dithionite. Kinetic data collected in the rapid-scanning mode were reduced by factor analysis using Global Fit, the singular value decomposition algorithm (16Matheson I.B.C. Anal. Instrum. ( N.Y. ). 1987; 16: 345-373Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar) provided by OLIS. Singular value decomposition-reduced data were then globally fit by a robust version of the Levenberg and Marquardt (non-linear method of least squares using the fitting routines of the Global Fit software (17Matheson I.B.C. Comput. Chem. 1989; 13: 299-304Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 18Matheson I.B.C. Comput. Chem. 1990; 14: 49-57Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar)). In all experiments, the absorbance changes with time could be fit to the equation for a single exponential decay. As discussed previously (9Hyun Y-L. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12249-12254Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the data for the concentration dependence ofk obs were analyzed by the method of Stricklandet al. (19Strickland S. Palmer G. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4048-4052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) according to Equations 1 and 2. Nonlinear curve fitting of data, AADHred+azurinox⇌KdAADHred/azurinox⇌k4k3Equation 1 AADHsemi/azurinred kobs=k3[azurin][azurin]+Kd+k4Equation 2 was performed with OLIS software and the Sigma Plot (Jandel Scientific, San Raphael, CA) computer program. For KSIE experiments, reactions were performed in D2O in 0.25 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.5. All buffered D2O solution were prepared according to Schowen and Schowen (20Schowen K.B. Schowen R.L. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 551-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Buffers of specific pD were prepared using a standard pH meter soaked in D2O and correction was made for the effects of D2O on the electrode response. The value of pD was obtained by adding 0.40 to the observed pH in solutions in D2O (21Glasoe P.K. Long F.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1960; 64: 188-190Crossref Scopus (2149) Google Scholar). With solutions which contained protein samples, H2O was completely exchanged for D2O by repeated ultrafiltration using Centriprep (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA) concentrators. After solvent exchange, these protein solutions were incubated overnight in the buffered D2O at 10 °C to ensure the complete exchange of all solvent exposed titratable hydrogen ions for deuterium ions. The oxidation-reduction midpoint potential (E m) value of azurin was determined by spectrochemical titration as described previously for the determination of the E mvalue of amicyanin (22Zhu Z. Cunane L.M. Chen Z-W. Durley R.C.E. Mathews F.S. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17128-17136Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The concentration dependence of the rate of oxidation of reduced AADH forms by azurin was determined over a range of temperatures from 12 to 35 °C. In each case, the data were well fit by Equation 2 (Fig. 2) and yielded a limiting first-order rate constant (k 3) for the redox reaction. Rates varied with temperature from approximately 30–180 s−1 for the reactions of the N-quinol, and from approximately 2–5 s−1 for the reactions of theO-quinol. The temperature dependence ofk 3 for the reactions of each reduced AADH form with azurin was analyzed by both transition state theory and ET theory (23Marcus R.A. Sutin N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 811: 265-322Crossref Scopus (7752) Google Scholar). For analysis by transition state theory, data were fit to the Eyring equation (Equation 3), ln(k3h/kBT)=(−ΔH*/RT)+(ΔS*/R)Equation 3 which describes the temperature dependence of a reaction rate in which h is Planck's constant, R is the gas constant, T is temperature, k B is the Boltzmann constant, ΔH* is activation enthalpy, and ΔS* is activation entropy. Analysis of the temperature dependence of the k 3 for each reaction by Equation 3 yielded linear plots (Fig. 3). The fitted parameters are listed in TableI and compared with each other, and with the previously reported parameters from the analogous reactions of reduced forms of MADH with amicyanin.Table IThermodynamic and kinetic parameters for the reactions of reduced TTQ enzymes with copper proteinsParametersAADHMADHaValues were taken from Refs. 11-13.

In Equation 5,H AB is alternatively described in terms of the ET distance between redox centers (r is the center to center distance and r o is the close contact distance which is taken to be 3 Å), and the nature of the medium which separates the redox centers (β). The parameter k o is the characteristic frequency of the nuclei which is set at 10−13 s−1. Detailed discussions of the mathematical and physical meaning of H AB and λ may be found in several excellent reviews of ET theory (23Marcus R.A. Sutin N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 811: 265-322Crossref Scopus (7752) Google Scholar, 24McLendon G. Hake R. Chem. Rev. 1992; 92: 481-490Crossref Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 25Moser C.C. Keske J.M. Warncke K. Farid R.S.

The ΔG 0 used in Equations 4 and 5 was calculated from the difference of the E m values of the TTQ and copper redox centers. We measured the E mvalue of azurin to be +275 mV under our experimental conditions (data not shown). It should be noted that in the MADH-amicyanin system, theE m value of amicyanin changes on complex formation with MADH. This is because a histidine residue that provides one of the ligands for the copper of amicyanin undergoes a pH-dependent conformational change in the reduced state that removes it from the copper coordination sphere when protonated, and this “histidine flip” is sterically restricted when amicyanin is in complex with MADH (22Zhu Z. Cunane L.M. Chen Z-W. Durley R.C.E. Mathews F.S. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17128-17136Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). There is no evidence that azurin undergoes such a process under our experimental conditions, and so no correction for complex-dependent changes was made for theE m value of azurin. The E m value of the one-electron AADHred/AADHsemi couple cannot be measured directly, but a good approximation was inferred from previous redox studies of AADH and MADH (27Zhu Z. Davidson V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14254-14260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The two-electron AADHred/AADHox redox couple is 20 mV less positive than the MADHred/MADHox couple, and each exhibits exactly the same dependence on pH. The relativeE m values for the two one-electron couples of each enzyme also exhibit the same pH dependence (27Zhu Z. Davidson V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14254-14260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). TheE m value of the one-electron MADHred/MADHsemi couple, which could be determined, is +190 mV (14Brooks H.B. Davidson V.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 11201-11202Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As such, we used a 20 mV less positive value of +170 mV for the AADHred/AADHsemicouple in this analysis. This yields a ΔE m for the ET reaction from reduced AADH to oxidized azurin of +105 mV, which corresponds to a ΔG 0 of −10,131 J/mol. As discussed previously 2For example, if one assumes that ΔE m for the reaction of O-quinol AADH with azurin is 0 mV rather than +105 mV, fits of the temperature dependence of the rate to Equations 4 and 5 yield identical values ofH AB and r, and a value of λ of 1.4 eV rather than 1.6 eV. Alternatively, if one assumes that thisE m value is +200 mV rather than +105 mV, fits of the temperature dependence of the rate to Equations 4 and 5 again yield identical values of H AB and r, and a value of λ of 1.8 eV. (28Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14035-14039Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), when λ is very large compared with ΔG 0, any variation in the value of ΔG 0 used in Equations 4 and 5 will have a negligible effect on the fitted values ofH AB and r, and an effect on the fitted value of λ that is proportional to the error in ΔG 0. The parameters that are obtained from the fits of the data to Equations 4 and 5 are listed in Table I and compared with each other, and with the previously reported parameters from the analogous reactions of reduced forms of MADH with amicyanin. For the reaction ofO-quinol AADH with azurin, a secondary KSIE onk 3 of 1.5 ± 0.1 was observed (Fig.5 A). This is consistent withk 3 describing an ET event, which would not be expected to exhibit a primary KSIE. Under the same conditions, the reaction of N-quinol AADH with azurin exhibited a significantly larger KSIE on k 3 of 3.2 ± 0.2 (Fig. 5 B), which suggests that the rate-limiting step for the observed redox reactions involves the transfer of an exchangeable proton (discussed later). In the simple kinetic model used to analyze these data (Equation 1), the limiting first-order rate constant (k 3) may not necessarily be a true ET rate constant (k ET) (28Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14035-14039Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 29Hoffman B.M. Ratner M.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109 (; Erratum: (1988) J. Am. Chem.

Chen L. Mathews F.S. Xia Z-X. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12600-12608Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the absence of additional data, k 3should be considered an apparent ET rate constant, because any spectroscopically invisible reaction steps that may occur after binding and before ET may be reflected in k 3. For a hypothetical three-step reaction (Equation 6), AADHred+azurinox⇌KdAADHred/azurinox⇌−kxkxEquation 6 [AADHred/azurinox]*⇌−kETkETAADHsemi/azurinredin which some adiabatic reaction step (k x) occurs after binding and is required, to activate the system for ET,k 3 will be a true k ETonly if k ET is rate-limiting for the three-step reaction mechanism. If k x is rate-limiting instead, then it will be a gated ET reaction and k 3 in Equation 1 will be equal to k x. For the reactions of O-quinol and N-quinol AADH with azurin, different reaction steps must be rate-limiting for each of the two redox reactions (Table I). The activation parameters, ΔH* and ΔS*, are given primarily for comparison. Interpretation of these parameters for a nonadiabatic ET reaction is not straightforward, as this reaction does not involve the formation or breakage of bonds. However, it is evident from the very different values for the reactions of O-quinol andN-quinol AADH that these sets of thermodynamic activation parameters must be describing different types of reactions. A qualitatively similar trend was previously reported for the redox reactions between MADH with amicyanin (11Bishop G.R. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12082-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 12Bishop G.R. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13586-13592Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Comparison of the values for the ET parameters for the reactions ofO-quinol and N-quinol AADH provides an explanation for the differences in the temperature dependence and activation parameters of these reactions that are caused by the modification by substrate of the reduced TTQ prosthetic group. The values of λ, H AB, and r that describe the reaction of O-quinol AADH with azurin are consistent with k 3 describing an ET event (28Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14035-14039Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In contrast, the values of λ, H AB, andr that describe the reactions of N-quinol AADH with azurin are diagnostic of a gated ET reaction (28Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14035-14039Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Nonadiabatic ET reactions, by definition, exhibit weak electronic coupling between redox centers and values of H AB that are within the nonadiabatic limit, if the ET event is rate-limiting for the redox reaction. It has been proposed that nonadiabatic ET reactions should exhibit an H AB value of less than 80 cm−1 (32Winkler J.R. Gray H.B. Chem. Rev. 1992; 92: 369-379Crossref Scopus (603) Google Scholar). The H AB for the reaction of O-quinol AADH with azurin is well within this limit. The reaction of N-quinol AADH with azurin, however, exhibited anH AB of 820 cm−1 which indicates that k 3 for this reaction does not describe an ET event. Furthermore, the value of 15 Å that is obtained for the reaction of O-quinol AADH with azurin is reasonable (discussed later), whereas the analysis of thek 3 for the reaction of N-quinol AADH with azurin yields a negative value for ET distance. This absurd value is obtained because Equations 4 and 5 are only appropriate for the analysis of nonadiabatic reactions, and this result is further evidence that k 3 actually describes the rate of a non-ET reaction step (i.e. k x in Equation 6) that precedes the true ET. The much larger value of λ obtained for the reaction of the N-quinol is also consistent with the conclusion that this is a gated ET reaction which is not appropriately described by ET theory. Since it is known that the ET reaction from N-quinol MADH to amicyanin is gated by the deprotonation of the substrate-derived amino group on TTQ (11Bishop G.R. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12082-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 12Bishop G.R. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13586-13592Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), KSIE studies were performed with AADH and azurin to see whether the same is true in this case. Incubation of an enzyme in D2O leads to a multitude of isotopic exchanges within the enzyme framework. By performing the reactions in H2O and D2O, a KSIE (H2Ok/D2Ok) can be determined. A significant KSIE is only observed when an exchangeable proton is transferred in the rate-limiting step. Secondary effects, defined as those involving conformational changes in the enzyme caused by changing the properties of hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic bonds, and other factors will yield a KSIE less than 2.0 and do not involve hydrogen transfer in the rate-limiting step (20Schowen K.B. Schowen R.L. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 551-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The analysis of data for the reactions of O-quinol AADH with oxidized azurin yielded a KSIE of 1.5, which likely describes such secondary effects. This result is consistent with k 3 describing an ET event, which would not exhibit a large KSIE since it does not involve proton transfer. In contrast, the reaction ofN-quinol AADH with azurin yielded a KSIE of 3.2, which is consistent with the k 3 for that reaction describing a proton transfer step, involving an exchangeable proton, that is gating the ET. The modification by substrate of the reduced TTQ cofactor of AADH causes the ET reaction to azurin to become gated by proton transfer. Thus, this previously reported novel feature in the MADH-amicyanin system is not an isolated event, but apparently a common feature of TTQ-dependent enzymes. These results raise the question of why the gated ET reaction from N-quinol AADH to azurin is faster than the ungated ET reaction from the O-quinol to azurin. The same phenomenon was observed for the ET reactions from TTQ in MADH to copper in amicyanin (11Bishop G.R. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12082-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 12Bishop G.R. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13586-13592Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The most likely explanation for this is that incorporation of N into the C-6 position of TTQ raises itsE m value relative to the O-quinol (33Bishop G.R. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11026-11032Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) such that ET to azurin becomes thermodynamically much less favorable and now requires a prerequisite activation step to occur to a significant extent. For AADH, this activation step appears to be the same as that for MADH (12Bishop G.R. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13586-13592Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), deprotonation of the N-quinol to yield a highly reactive species which will transfer electrons much faster than either the unactivated N-quinol or theO-quinol. Thus, the unactivated and ungated ET reaction of the O-quinol is slower than the gated but activated ET reaction of the N-quinol. The λ value of 1.6 eV for the ET reaction fromO-quinol AADH to azurin, while relatively large, is much less than the value of 2.3 eV that was obtained for the ET reaction from O-quinol MADH and amicyanin. The latter value was obtained from the ΔG 0 dependence of ET reactions of different redox forms of MADH (14Brooks H.B. Davidson V.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 11201-11202Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and from temperature dependence studies of the O-quinol (13Brooks H.B. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5696-5701Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It is important to try to understand the basis for these relatively large λ values. One possibility is that they reflect the kinetic complexity of this reaction (28Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14035-14039Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These ET reactions may be representative of kinetically coupled ET. If for the three-step model in Equation 6,k x is relatively fast but very unfavorable (i.e. K x(k x/k −x)≪1) thenk 3 will be influenced by the equilibrium constant for that adiabatic process such that k 3= k ET*K x (28Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14035-14039Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 31Harris T.K. Davidson V.L. Chen L. Mathews F.S. Xia Z-X. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12600-12608Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It follows that the experimentally derived λ will contain contributions from both the ET event and the preceding reaction step (i.e.λobs = f[λET, λx]). At least two possible non-ET reaction steps may be required to activate the system for ET. A conformational rearrangement of the proteins within the ET complex may be needed to orient the proteins from a geometry which is optimal for binding to one which is optimal for ET. Alternatively, a conformational reorientation of the two indole rings (e.g. change in dihedral angle between rings) which comprise the TTQ cofactor may be needed to optimize the system for ET. The need for such a perturbation of the angle between the TTQ rings for ET reactions has also been suggested on the basis of studies with TTQ model compounds (34Itoh S. Ogino M. Haranou S. Terasaka T. Ando T. Komatsu M. Oshiro Y. Fukuzumi S. Kano K. Takagi K. Ikeda T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 1485-1493Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It is also possible that this is a true ET reaction with a large intrinsic λ value. While much is known about the λ values associated with redox changes of metal redox centers, such as type 1 copper and heme, these systems are very different from TTQ which contains no metal and is comprised of two unfused indole ring systems joined by a single bond. The λ value for the reaction of AADH with azurin is approximately 0.8 eV less than that for the corresponding reaction of MADH with amicyanin. This suggests that the λ value of 2.3 eV for the latter reaction cannot be attributed solely to it being an inherent property of TTQ. It is more likely related to the relative flexibility in the orientation of the two TTQ rings with respect to each other in the respective quinoproteins, or differences in the structural features at the respective protein-protein interfaces that may affect the energetics of a conformational rearrangement of protein partners. TheH AB value for the reaction ofO-quinol AADH with azurin is approximately 100-fold less than that for the reaction of O-quinol MADH with amicyanin. This appears to be due to a greater ET distance for the AADH-azurin reaction. For the O-quinol reaction, which is rate-limited by ET, the value which was obtained for the MADH-amicyanin reaction closely matches the actual distance seen in the crystal structure of MADH-amicyanin complex where the redox centers are about 9.4 Å apart (6Chen L. Durley R. Poloks B.J. Hamada K. Chen Z. Mathews F.S. Davidson V.L. Satow Y. Huizinga E. Vellieux F.M.D. Hol W.G.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4959-4964Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 7Chen L. Durley R. Mathews F.S. Davidson V.L. Science. 1994; 264: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In that structure, the edge of the unquinolated indole ring of TTQ is exposed at the MADH surface and interacts with amicyanin at the so-called hydrophobic patch surrounding a histidine which serves as a copper ligand. If one assumes that AADH and azurin interact in an orientation similar to that of MADH and amicyanin, then the decreasedH AB could be a result of the TTQ or copper centers being somewhat more buried in their respective structures, or an increased interprotein distance between AADH and azurin relative to that which separates MADH and amicyanin. A relatively small increase in interprotein distance can cause a large decrease inH AB and large apparent increase in overall distance when a single β value is used (35Davidson V.L. Jones L.H. Zhu Z. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7371-7377Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As stated earlier, the negative values for the reactions of the N-quinols reflect the fact that these are gated reactions which cannot be described by ET theory. Interprotein ET reactions are often suggested or suspected to be gated by a non-ET reaction step. However, there are very few instances in which such reactions have been analyzed by ΔG 0 or temperature dependence studies to determine ET parameters, or studied over a range of reaction conditions to clearly distinguish whether or not the ET is really gated. In addition to the N-quinol AADH-azurin reaction described here, three physiologic interprotein ET reactions have been shown to be gated based on analyses by Equations 4 and 5. The ET reactions fromN-quinol MADH to amicyanin (11Bishop G.R. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12082-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 12Bishop G.R. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13586-13592Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) have been discussed earlier. The ET between the iron protein and molybdenum-iron protein of the nitrogenase complex has been shown to be gated by conformational events associated with either MgATP binding or hydrolysis (36Lanzilotta W.N. Parker V.D. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). ET from flavin to iron in the rubredoxin reductase-rubredoxin complex is gated by an as yet undetermined process (37Lee H.J. Basran J. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15513-15522Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). As is seen for the reaction ofN-quinol AADH with azurin, analyses of each of these other three gated reactions by Equations 4 and 5 also yielded negative values for ET distance and H AB values which exceed the nonadiabatic limit by orders of magnitude (36Lanzilotta W.N. Parker V.D. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 37Lee H.J. Basran J. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15513-15522Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Kostic and co-workers (38Ivkovic-Jensen M.M. Kostic N.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8135-8144Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 39Crnogorac M.M. Shen C. Young S. Hansson O. Kostic N.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16465-16474Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) have also provided strong evidence from viscosity dependence studies and site-directed mutagenesis that non-physiologic ET reactions between cytochrome c and plastocyanin are gated by a conformational rearrangement between proteins after binding. The reactions of N-quinol AADH with azurin andN-quinol MADH with amicyanin stand out as examples of interprotein ET reactions that are gated by proton transfer events, as indicated by a significant KSIE for the apparentk ET."
