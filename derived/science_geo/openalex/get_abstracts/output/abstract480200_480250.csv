https://openalex.org/W2096500024,"Microglia are the resident macrophages of the CNS, and their functions have been extensively studied in various brain pathologies. The physiological roles of microglia in brain plasticity and function, however, remain unclear. To address this question, we generated CX3CR1(CreER) mice expressing tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase that allow for specific manipulation of gene function in microglia. Using CX3CR1(CreER) to drive diphtheria toxin receptor expression in microglia, we found that microglia could be specifically depleted from the brain upon diphtheria toxin administration. Mice depleted of microglia showed deficits in multiple learning tasks and a significant reduction in motor-learning-dependent synapse formation. Furthermore, Cre-dependent removal of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) from microglia largely recapitulated the effects of microglia depletion. Microglial BDNF increases neuronal tropomyosin-related kinase receptor B phosphorylation, a key mediator of synaptic plasticity. Together, our findings reveal that microglia serve important physiological functions in learning and memory by promoting learning-related synapse formation through BDNF signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2171748049,"Ever since eukaryotes subsumed the bacterial ancestor of mitochondria, the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes have had to closely coordinate their activities, as each encode different subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of aging, but its causes are debated. We show that, during aging, there is a specific loss of mitochondrial, but not nuclear, encoded OXPHOS subunits. We trace the cause to an alternate PGC-1α/β-independent pathway of nuclear-mitochondrial communication that is induced by a decline in nuclear NAD(+) and the accumulation of HIF-1α under normoxic conditions, with parallels to Warburg reprogramming. Deleting SIRT1 accelerates this process, whereas raising NAD(+) levels in old mice restores mitochondrial function to that of a young mouse in a SIRT1-dependent manner. Thus, a pseudohypoxic state that disrupts PGC-1α/β-independent nuclear-mitochondrial communication contributes to the decline in mitochondrial function with age, a process that is apparently reversible."
https://openalex.org/W2089771991,"Loss of neurons after brain injury and in neurodegenerative disease is often accompanied by reactive gliosis and scarring, which are difficult to reverse with existing treatment approaches. Here, we show that reactive glial cells in the cortex of stab-injured or Alzheimer's disease (AD) model mice can be directly reprogrammed into functional neurons in vivo using retroviral expression of a single neural transcription factor, NeuroD1. Following expression of NeuroD1, astrocytes were reprogrammed into glutamatergic neurons, while NG2 cells were reprogrammed into glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons. Cortical slice recordings revealed both spontaneous and evoked synaptic responses in NeuroD1-converted neurons, suggesting that they integrated into local neural circuits. NeuroD1 expression was also able to reprogram cultured human cortical astrocytes into functional neurons. Our studies therefore suggest that direct reprogramming of reactive glial cells into functional neurons in vivo could provide an alternative approach for repair of injured or diseased brain."
https://openalex.org/W2161435888,"The physical nature of the bacterial cytoplasm is poorly understood even though it determines cytoplasmic dynamics and hence cellular physiology and behavior. Through single-particle tracking of protein filaments, plasmids, storage granules, and foreign particles of different sizes, we find that the bacterial cytoplasm displays properties that are characteristic of glass-forming liquids and changes from liquid-like to solid-like in a component size-dependent fashion. As a result, the motion of cytoplasmic components becomes disproportionally constrained with increasing size. Remarkably, cellular metabolism fluidizes the cytoplasm, allowing larger components to escape their local environment and explore larger regions of the cytoplasm. Consequently, cytoplasmic fluidity and dynamics dramatically change as cells shift between metabolically active and dormant states in response to fluctuating environments. Our findings provide insight into bacterial dormancy and have broad implications to our understanding of bacterial physiology, as the glassy behavior of the cytoplasm impacts all intracellular processes involving large components."
https://openalex.org/W2040707073,"Perceptual decisions involve distributed cortical activity. Does information flow sequentially from one cortical area to another, or do networks of interconnected areas contribute at the same time? Here we delineate when and how activity in specific areas drives a whisker-based decision in mice. A short-term memory component temporally separated tactile ""sensation"" and ""action"" (licking). Using optogenetic inhibition (spatial resolution, 2 mm; temporal resolution, 100 ms), we surveyed the neocortex for regions driving behavior during specific behavioral epochs. Barrel cortex was critical for sensation. During the short-term memory, unilateral inhibition of anterior lateral motor cortex biased responses to the ipsilateral side. Consistently, barrel cortex showed stimulus-specific activity during sensation, whereas motor cortex showed choice-specific preparatory activity and movement-related activity, consistent with roles in motor planning and movement. These results suggest serial information flow from sensory to motor areas during perceptual decision making."
https://openalex.org/W1977658700,Recent development of molecular genetic techniques are rapidly advancing understanding of the functional role of brain circuits in behavior. Critical to this approach is the ability to target specific neuron populations and circuits. The collection of over 250 BAC Cre-recombinase driver lines produced by the GENSAT project provides a resource for such studies. Here we provide characterization of GENSAT BAC-Cre driver lines with expression in specific neuroanatomical pathways within the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia.
https://openalex.org/W2041171293,"Enhancers are distal regulatory elements that can activate tissue-specific gene expression and are abundant throughout mammalian genomes. Although substantial progress has been made toward genome-wide annotation of mammalian enhancers, their temporal activity patterns and global contributions in the context of developmental in vivo processes remain poorly explored. Here we used epigenomic profiling for H3K27ac, a mark of active enhancers, coupled to transgenic mouse assays to examine the genome-wide utilization of enhancers in three different mouse tissues across seven developmental stages. The majority of the ∼90,000 enhancers identified exhibited tightly temporally restricted predicted activity windows and were associated with stage-specific biological functions and regulatory pathways in individual tissues. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that evolutionary conservation of enhancers decreases following midgestation across all tissues examined. The dynamic enhancer activities uncovered in this study illuminate rapid and pervasive temporal in vivo changes in enhancer usage that underlie processes central to development and disease."

The functions of JMJD6/ Brd4-associated dual histone and RNA demethylase activity on anti-pause enhancers have intriguing implications for these proteins in development, homeostasis, and disease. The critical roles of enhancers have been recognized for more than 25 years, and recently the H3K4me1 mark was identified to characterize many gene enhancers (Heintzman et al., 2009Heintzman N.D.

The molecular mechanisms underlying transcription regulation by enhancers as well as other distal regulatory elements with enhancer-like properties remain incompletely understood. JMJD6, also known as PTDSR or PSR, a JmjC-domain-containing protein, has been suggested to possess novel, unexpected nuclear functions (Cui et al., 2004Cui P. Qin B. Liu N. Pan G. Pei D.

It has been recently reported to be an arginine demethylase and lysyl-5-hydroxylase (Chang et al., 2007Chang B. Chen Y. Zhao Y. Bruick R.K.

Meanwhile, a structural study suggested that methyl groups on single-stranded RNAs (ssRNAs) might be substrates of JMJD6 (Hong et al., 2010Hong X. Zang J. White J. Wang C. Pan C.H. Zhao R.

Brd4, along with Brd2, Brd3, and testes/oocyte-specific BrdT, comprises the BET domain family of proteins in mammals, which is characterized by the presence of tandem, amino-terminal bromodomains and an extraterminal (ET) domain. Knockout of Brd4 and Brd2 in mice leads to early embryonic lethality (Gyuris et al., 2009Gyuris A. Donovan D.J. Seymour K.A. Lovasco L.A. Smilowitz N.R. Halperin A.L. Klysik J.E. Freiman R.N.

The P-TEFb complex is a heterodimer consisting of the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk9 and a cyclin component (Cyclin T1, T2, or K). Brd4 is capable of releasing the P-TEFb complex from the inhibitory factors, HEXIM1/2 and 7SK snRNA, through its direct interaction with Cyclin T1, resulting in the transition of the P-TEFb complex from its inactive to an active form and subsequent phosphorylation of RNA Pol II, leading to efficient transcriptional elongation (Jang et al., 2005Jang M.K.

Enhancer-bound Brd4 regulation of transcription has been recently shown in cancer cells as well as heart failure, although the underlying molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood (Anand et al., 2013Anand P.

Emerging evidence suggests that promoter-proximal pausing of Pol II is a critical regulatory event subsequent to Pol II initiation on a large set of genes (Adelman and Lis, 2012Adelman K. Lis J.T. Promoter-proximal pausing of RNA polymerase II: emerging roles in metazoans.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2012; 13: 720-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). Pol II promoter-proximal pause release is achieved mainly through the action of the P-TEFb complex, which phosphorylates at least three targets including the NelfE subunit of NELF, the Spt5 subunit of DSIF, and serine 2 of RNA Pol II carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) (Kim and Sharp, 2001Kim J.B.

Half of the total P-TEFb in the cells is reversibly bound to the inhibitory subunit composed of 7SK snRNA and HEXIM1/2 and thus is in an inactive form (Nguyen et al., 2001Nguyen V.T. Kiss T. Michels A.A.

The 7SK small nuclear RNA inhibits the CDK9/cyclin T1 kinase to control transcription.Nature. 2001; 414: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar), whereas the remaining half associates with Brd4 (Jang et al., 2005Jang M.K.

Although HIV-1 Tat and Brd4 are capable of directly extracting P-TEFb out from its 7SK snRNP inhibitory complex (Krueger et al., 2010Krueger B.J. Varzavand K. Cooper J.J. Price D.H. The mechanism of release of P-TEFb and HEXIM1 from the 7SK snRNP by viral and cellular activators includes a conformational change in 7SK.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e12335Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), the physiological molecular mechanisms governing the release of P-TEFb complex and transition to the active form remain incompletely understood. In the present study, we provide evidence that JMJD6 and Brd4 physically and functionally interact in the context of the active P-TEFb complex to regulate Pol II promoter-proximal pause release of a large cohort of genes. The pause release function of the JMJD6 and Brd4 complex on these genes is established primarily based on binding to distal enhancers, which we term as anti-pause enhancers (A-PEs). Mechanistically, 7SK snRNA is found to function as a “reader” for H4R3me2(s), a repressive histone mark, and JMJD6 displays dual demethylase activities toward both H4R3me2(s) and the methyl-cap of 7SK snRNA, resulting in the disassembly of the 7SK snRNA/HEXIM1 inhibitory complex imposed on the P-TEFb complex. Simultaneously, both JMJD6 and Brd4 are capable of retaining the P-TEFb complex through physical interaction with CDK9 and Cyclin T1, respectively, leading to its activation, and eventuating in transcriptional pause release and gene activation. Initially, identifying JMJD6 interacting partners in HEK293 cell lines revealed the presence of Brd4, with six peptides predicted with high confidence (Figure 1A and Table S1 available online), consistent with previous reports (Rahman et al., 2011Rahman S. Sowa M.E. Ottinger M. Smith J.A. Shi Y. Harper J.W. Howley P.M.

Accordingly, JMJD6 was found in the list of Brd4-associated proteins, with four peptides predicted with high confidence, strengthening the possibility that these two proteins might function together to regulate cellular process (Figure S1A). In addition, known functional partners of Brd4 were also successfully identified in our pull-down, including the P-TEFb complex composed of Cdk9 and Cyclin T1 (Jang et al., 2005Jang M.K. Mochizuki K. Zhou M. Jeong H.S. Brady J.N. Ozato K. The bromodomain protein Brd4 is a positive regulatory component of P-TEFb and stimulates RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription.Mol.

The interaction between JMJD6 and Brd4 or P-TEFb complex, including Cdk9 and Cyclin T1/2, was further confirmed, suggesting that it associates with the active form of P-TEFb complex (Figure 1B). To test whether JMJD6 also associates with the inactive form of the P-TEFb complex, proteins associated with 7SK snRNA were identified. Known 7SK snRNA-associated proteins, including HEXIM1, BCDIN3, LARP7, and the P-TEFb complex (Cdk9 and Cyclin T1), were successfully identified, whereas neither JMJD6 nor Brd4 was detected (Table S2), as further confirmed through immunoblotting (Figure 1C). These data suggest that JMJD6 and Brd4 specifically interact with the active form of the P-TEFb complex.Figure S1Physical Interaction between JMJD6 and Brd4, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Brd4-associated proteins were identified similarly as described in Figure 1A, with predicted peptides for JMJD6 were shown.(B) Expression of bacterially-expressed GST-tagged JMJD6 detected by Coomassie blue staining (C.B.S).

Note that JMJD6 (306-337) was not detectable probably due to the fact that the amino acid sequence is too short in length. Direct interaction between JMJD6 and Brd4 was demonstrated in vitro (Figures 1D and S1B) and in HEK293T cells cotransfected with JMJD6 and Brd4 (Figure 1E). The JMJD6 interacting domain in Brd4 was mapped to a fragment harboring the extraterminal domain (ET) (aa 471–730) in vitro (Figures S1C–S1E) and in HEK293T cells (Figure S1F). Similarly, the amino-terminal and JmjC domains of JMJD6 together mediated its interaction with Brd4 both in vitro (Figures S1G–S1L) and in HEK293T cells (Figure S1M). To begin to examine the transcriptional regulation by JMJD6 and Brd4 in the context of active P-TEFb complex, HEK293T cells were transfected with control small interfering RNA (siRNA) or two independent siRNAs specifically targeting JMJD6 or Brd4 followed by Gro-seq analyses (Figures 1F, S2A, and S2B). Each of the two siRNAs targeting JMJD6 or Brd4 caused transcriptional changes in a substantial number of genes (Figures 1G, 1H, S2C, and S2D). We subsequently focused on the conserved program (Figures 1G and 1H). In accord with their association with the active P-TEFb complex, 82% of JMJD6- or 71% Brd4-regulated genes exhibited impaired transcription when knocking down of JMJD6 or Brd4, respectively (Figures 1G and 1H). Significantly, over 56% or 47% of the genes regulated by JMJD6 or Brd4, respectively, were jointly regulated by these two proteins (n = 1,201) (Figure 1I and Table S3), 96.2% of which were regulated in the same direction by both proteins (n = 1,155) (Figure 1J). Out of these 1,155 genes, 88% of them required both JMJD6 and Brd4 for transcriptional activation (n = 1,022) (Figure 1J), as further validated by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) (Figure S2E). These genes that were positively regulated in common by both JMJD6 and Brd4 (n = 1,022) were referred to as JB genes. Gene ontology analysis revealed that functional terms, including cellular metabolic process, embryonic development, RNA splicing and processing, cell death and apoptosis, cellular localization, and cell-cycle regulation, were enriched (Table S4). Together, our experiments argue in favor of a physical and functional interaction between JMJD6 and Brd4. Brd4 has been shown to be critical for transcriptional elongation presumably through its recruitment of P-TEFb complex. Based on the fact that JMJD6 and Brd4 coregulated a significant subset of genes, we hypothesized that JMJD6 might also play a role in the process of P-TEFb activation and promoter-proximal Pol II pause release. To test this hypothesis, Pol II chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis was performed in control siRNA or siRNA specifically targeting JMJD6- or Brd4-transfected HEK293T cells. For the vast majority of genes, Pol II occupancy was at a much higher density at the promoter-proximal region compared to gene body (Figure S2F). We then calculated the relative ratio of Pol II density in the promoter-proximal region and the gene body, which has been termed as traveling ratio (TR) (Reppas et al., 2006Reppas N.B. Wade J.T.

It was found that nearly 90% of Pol-II-bound genes have a TR larger than 2, suggesting that these genes experience promoter-proximal pausing regulation (Figure S2G), a result similar to what was found in embryonic stem (ES) cells (Rahl et al., 2010Rahl P.B.

https://openalex.org/W2065814242,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short RNA gene regulators typically produced from primary transcripts that are cleaved by the nuclear microprocessor complex, with the resulting precursor miRNA hairpins exported by exportin 5 and processed by cytoplasmic Dicer to yield two (5p and 3p) miRNAs. Here, we document microprocessor-independent 7-methylguanosine (m(7)G)-capped pre-miRNAs, whose 5' ends coincide with transcription start sites and 3' ends are most likely generated by transcription termination. By establishing a small RNA Cap-seq method that employs the cap-binding protein eIF4E, we identified a group of murine m(7)G-capped pre-miRNAs genome wide. The m(7)G-capped pre-miRNAs are exported via the PHAX-exportin 1 pathway. After Dicer cleavage, only the 3p-miRNA is efficiently loaded onto Argonaute to form a functional microRNP. This unusual miRNA biogenesis pathway, which differs in pre-miRNA synthesis, nuclear-cytoplasmic transport, and guide strand selection, enables the development of shRNA expression constructs that produce a single 3p-siRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2063699128,"The Drosophila sex pheromone cVA elicits different behaviors in males and females. First- and second-order olfactory neurons show identical pheromone responses, suggesting that sex genes differentially wire circuits deeper in the brain. Using in vivo whole-cell electrophysiology, we now show that two clusters of third-order olfactory neurons have dimorphic pheromone responses. One cluster responds in females; the other responds in males. These clusters are present in both sexes and share a common input pathway, but sex-specific wiring reroutes pheromone information. Regulating dendritic position, the fruitless transcription factor both connects the male-responsive cluster and disconnects the female-responsive cluster from pheromone input. Selective masculinization of third-order neurons transforms their morphology and pheromone responses, demonstrating that circuits can be functionally rewired by the cell-autonomous action of a switch gene. This bidirectional switch, analogous to an electrical changeover switch, provides a simple circuit logic to activate different behaviors in males and females."
https://openalex.org/W2096093149,"Layer 5 pyramidal neurons comprise at least two subtypes: thick-tufted, subcortically projecting type A neurons, with prominent h-current, and thin-tufted, callosally projecting type B neurons, which lack prominent h-current. Using optogenetic stimulation, we find that these subtypes receive distinct forms of input that could subserve divergent functions. Repeatedly stimulating callosal inputs evokes progressively smaller excitatory responses in type B but not type A neurons. Callosal inputs also elicit more spikes in type A neurons. Surprisingly, these effects arise via distinct mechanisms. Differences in the dynamics of excitatory responses seem to reflect differences in presynaptic input, whereas differences in spiking depend on postsynaptic mechanisms. We also find that fast-spiking parvalbumin interneurons, but not somatostatin interneurons, preferentially inhibit type A neurons, leading to greater feedforward inhibition in this subtype. These differences may enable type A neurons to detect salient inputs that are focused in space and time, while type B neurons integrate across these dimensions."
https://openalex.org/W2117661095,"During each life cycle, germ cells preserve and pass on both genetic and epigenetic information. In C. elegans, the ALG-3/4 Argonaute proteins are expressed during male gametogenesis and promote male fertility. Here, we show that the CSR-1 Argonaute functions with ALG-3/4 to positively regulate target genes required for spermiogenesis. Our findings suggest that ALG-3/4 functions during spermatogenesis to amplify a small RNA signal that represents an epigenetic memory of male-specific gene expression. CSR-1, which is abundant in mature sperm, appears to transmit this memory to offspring. Surprisingly, in addition to small RNAs targeting male-specific genes, we show that males also harbor an extensive repertoire of CSR-1 small RNAs targeting oogenesis-specific mRNAs. Together, these findings suggest that C. elegans sperm transmit not only the genome but also epigenetic binary signals in the form of Argonaute/small RNA complexes that constitute a memory of gene expression in preceding generations."

Here, we show that Ubr1, the ubiquitin ligase of the Arg/N-end rule pathway, recognizes unacetylated N-terminal methionine if it is followed by a hydrophobic residue. This capability of Ubr1 expands the range of substrates that can be targeted for degradation by the Arg/N-end rule pathway because virtually all nascent cellular proteins bear N-terminal methionine. We identified Msn4, Sry1, Arl3, and Pre5 as examples of normal or misfolded proteins that can be destroyed through the recognition of their unacetylated N-terminal methionine. Inasmuch as proteins bearing the Nt-acetylated N-terminal methionine residue are substrates of the Ac/N-end rule pathway, the resulting complementarity of the Arg/N-end rule and Ac/N-end rule pathways enables the elimination of protein substrates regardless of acetylation state of N-terminal methionine in these substrates.

The N-end rule pathway recognizes proteins containing N-terminal degradation signals called N-degrons, polyubiquitylates these proteins and thereby causes their degradation by the proteasome (Bachmair et al., 1986Bachmair A.

The N-end rule pathway and regulation by proteolysis.Protein Sci. 2011; 20: 1298-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The main determinant of an N-degron is a destabilizing N-terminal residue of a protein. Recognition components of the N-end rule pathway are called N-recognins. In eukaryotes, N-recognins are E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligases that can target N-degrons (Figure S1 available online). Regulated degradation of proteins or their fragments by the N-end rule pathway mediates a strikingly broad range of biological functions, including the sensing of heme, nitric oxide, and oxygen; the control, through degradation, of subunit stoichiometries in multisubunit proteins; the elimination of misfolded proteins; the repression of apoptosis and neurodegeneration; the regulation of chromosome repair, transcription, replication, and cohesion/segregation; the regulation of G proteins, autophagy, peptide import, meiosis, immunity, fat metabolism, cell migration, actin filaments, cardiovascular development, spermatogenesis, neurogenesis, and memory; and the regulation of many processes in plants (Figure S1 and references therein) (Dougan et al., 2012Dougan D.A.

One of them, called the Arg/N-end rule pathway, targets specific unacetylated N-terminal residues (Figure S1B) (Bachmair et al., 1986Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A.

The N-end rule pathway counteracts cell death by destroying proapoptotic protein fragments.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: E1839-E1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). N-terminal Arg, Lys, His, Leu, Phe, Tyr, Trp, and Ile are directly recognized by N-recognins. In contrast, N-terminal Asn, Gln, Asp, and Glu (as well as Cys, under some metabolic conditions) are destabilizing owing to their preliminary enzymatic modifications, which include N-terminal deamidation (Nt-deamidation) and Nt-arginylation (Figures S1B and S1C). In the yeast S. cerevisiae, the Arg/N-end rule pathway is mediated by the Ubr1 N-recognin, a 225 kDa RING-type E3 Ub ligase and a part of the targeting complex containing the Ubr1-Rad6 and Ufd4-Ubc4/5 holoenzymes (Hwang et al., 2010aHwang C.-S. Shemorry A. Auerbach D. Varshavsky A. The N-end rule pathway is mediated by a complex of the RING-type Ubr1 and HECT-type Ufd4 ubiquitin ligases.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 1177-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The other branch, called the Ac/N-end rule pathway, recognizes proteins through their Nα-terminally acetylated (Nt-acetylated) residues (Figure S1A) (Hwang et al., 2010bHwang C.-S. Shemorry A. Varshavsky A. N-terminal acetylation of cellular proteins creates specific degradation signals.Science. 2010; 327: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, Shemorry et al., 2013Shemorry A.

The corresponding degradation signals and E3 Ub ligases are called Ac/N-degrons and Ac/N-recognins, respectively. Nt-acetylation of cellular proteins is apparently irreversible, in contrast to acetylation-deacetylation of internal Lys residues. The bulk of Nt-acetylation is cotranslational, being mediated by ribosome-associated Nt-acetylases. Approximately 90% of human proteins are Nt-acetylated (Arnesen et al., 2009Arnesen T. Van Damme P. Polevoda B. Helsens K. Evjenth R. Colaert N. Varhaug J.E. Vandekerckhove J. Lillehaug J.R. Sherman F. Gevaert K.

Targeted large-scale analysis of protein acetylation.Proteomics. 2011; 11: 571-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Many, possibly most, Nt-acetylated proteins contain Ac/N-degrons (Figure S1A) (Hwang et al., 2010bHwang C.-S. Shemorry A. Varshavsky A. N-terminal acetylation of cellular proteins creates specific degradation signals.Science. 2010; 327: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, Shemorry et al., 2013Shemorry A. Hwang C.-S.

Cell. 2013; 50: 540-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Natural Ac/N-degrons are regulated through their steric shielding. A protein containing an Ac/N-degron is short lived unless it can repress (shield) its Ac/N-degron through intramolecular folding or interactions with other proteins (Figure 7A). The resulting hiatus from being vulnerable to degradation can be either long-lasting or transient, depending on the in vivo dynamics (dissociation-reconstitution) of a complex that sequesters the protein’s Ac/N-degron (Shemorry et al., 2013Shemorry A.

Cell. 2013; 50: 540-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The cotranslational creation of Ac/N-degrons, their exceptional prevalence, and their conditionality underlie the regulation, by the Ac/N-end rule pathway, of the input stoichiometries of subunits in multisubunit complexes, as well as the elimination of misfolded or otherwise abnormal proteins that cannot shield their Ac/N-degrons (Shemorry et al., 2013Shemorry A.

Cell. 2013; 50: 540-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This understanding left open the question of what happens when the Nt-acetylation of a specific protein is incomplete. Many cellular proteins are partially Nt-acetylated, i.e., a protein can exist in vivo as a mix of Nt-acetylated and non-Nt-acetylated species (Arnesen et al., 2009Arnesen T. Van Damme P. Polevoda B. Helsens K. Evjenth R. Colaert N. Varhaug J.E. Vandekerckhove J. Lillehaug J.R. Sherman F. Gevaert K. Proteomics analyses reveal the evolutionary conservation and divergence of N-terminal acetyltransferases from yeast and humans.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 8157-8162Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The unacetylated fraction of an incompletely Nt-acetylated protein would be invisible to the Ac/N-end rule pathway. Might there be a system that can gauge and control, through conditional proteolysis, the homeostasis of both Nt-acetylated proteins and their unacetylated counterparts? Nascent polypeptides bear N-terminal methionine (Met), encoded by the AUG initiation codon. Ribosome-associated Met-aminopeptidases cotranslationally cleave off the N-terminal Met if a residue at position 2, to be made N terminal by the cleavage, is sufficiently small, i.e., if it is Gly, Ala, Ser, Thr, Cys, Pro, or Val (Xiao et al., 2010Xiao Q. Zhang F. Nacev B.A. Liu J.O. Pei D. Protein N-terminal processing: substrate specificity of Escherichia coli and human methionine aminopeptidases.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 5588-5599Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The resulting N-terminal Ala, Ser, and Thr, as well as the retained N-terminal Met residue are often Nt-acetylated (Starheim et al., 2012Starheim K.K. Gevaert K. Arnesen T. Protein N-terminal acetyltransferases: when the start matters.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2012; 37: 152-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Other N-terminal residues are Nt-acetylated either less frequently or almost never (Figure S2A). Until the present work, the unacetylated N-terminal Met was classed as a “stabilizing” (i.e., nondestabilizing) residue (Varshavsky, 2011Varshavsky A. The N-end rule pathway and regulation by proteolysis.Protein Sci. 2011; 20: 1298-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). We show here that the S. cerevisiae Ubr1 N-recognin and its mouse counterparts Ubr1 and Ubr2 have the previously unknown ability to recognize proteins bearing the unacetylated N-terminal Met if the residue at position 2 is Leu, Phe, Tyr, Trp, Ile, Val or Ala, i.e., a non-Met hydrophobic (Ф) residue. Because Ala2 and Val2 allow the removal of N-terminal Met by Met-aminopeptidases (Xiao et al., 2010Xiao Q. Zhang F. Nacev B.A. Liu J.O. Pei D. Protein N-terminal processing: substrate specificity of Escherichia coli and human methionine aminopeptidases.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 5588-5599Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), the retention of Met requires a large second-position Ф residue, i.e., Leu, Phe, Tyr, Trp or Ile. Proteins containing this motif, termed Met-Ф proteins, are shown here to be short-lived substrates of both the Arg/N-end rule and Ac/N-end rule pathways. The substrate range of the Ac/N-end rule pathway is exceptionally broad, as ∼90% of human proteins are Nt-acetylated and many Nt-acetylated proteins contain Ac/N-degrons (Figure S1A) (Hwang et al., 2010bHwang C.-S. Shemorry A. Varshavsky A. N-terminal acetylation of cellular proteins creates specific degradation signals.Science. 2010; 327: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, Shemorry et al., 2013Shemorry A. Hwang C.-S.

Cell. 2013; 50: 540-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The substrate range of the Arg/N-end rule pathway was thought to be much narrower, because the exposure of the previously known unacetylated destabilizing N-terminal residues in substrates of this pathway (Figure S1B) requires preliminary cleavages of proteins by nonprocessive proteases that include calpains, caspases, separases, and secretases. The discovery that this proteolytic system can target unacetylated Met-Ф proteins greatly expands the substrate range of the Arg/N-end rule pathway. We found that the natural Met-Ф proteins Msn4, Sry1, Arl3, and Pre5 bear unacetylated Met-based N-degrons. We also found that the previously reported degradation of misfolded proteins by the Arg/N-end rule pathway (Eisele and Wolf, 2008Eisele F. Wolf D.H.

The cited proteins are a part of an apparently much larger set of normal or misfolded proteins that can be destroyed through the recognition of their unacetylated N-terminal Met. In either yeast or mammals, approximately 15% of genes encode Met-Ф proteins. As described below, many, possibly most, unacetylated Met-Ф proteins contain Met-based N-degrons. The resulting functional complementarity between the two branches of the N-end rule pathway makes possible the degradation-mediated control of Met-Ф proteins irrespective of the extent of their Nt-acetylation. Specifically, it is shown here that an Nt-acetylated Met-Ф protein can be destroyed by the Ac/N-end rule pathway while the otherwise identical unacetylated protein can be eliminated, independently, by the Arg/N-end rule pathway (Figures 6, 7, and S1). First indications that S. cerevisiae Ubr1 has a broader than previously known recognition specificity were provided by peptide arrays on membrane support (SPOT). In these assays, XZ-eK(3-10) peptides were C-terminally linked to a membrane in equal molar amounts and probed for binding to purified, flag-tagged S. cerevisiae Ubr1 (ScfUbr1) or to its mouse counterparts MmfUbr1 and MmfUbr2 (Figures 1A and 1B ). The notation eK(3-10) (extension [e] containing lysine [K]) denotes eight residues (after the varying residues X and Z) of the previously characterized ∼40-residue eK sequence upstream of engineered N-end rule reporters (Hwang et al., 2010bHwang C.-S. Shemorry A. Varshavsky A. N-terminal acetylation of cellular proteins creates specific degradation signals.Science. 2010; 327: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, Varshavsky, 2011Varshavsky A. The N-end rule pathway and regulation by proteolysis.Protein Sci. 2011; 20: 1298-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). ScfUbr1 was found to bind to unacetylated Met-Z-eK(3-10) peptides in which Z = Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, Phe, Trp, Tyr (Figure 1A, spots 1, 5, 8, 10, 18-20), but did not significantly bind to the otherwise identical Met-Z-eK(3-10) peptides in which Z = Cys, Asp, Glu, Gly, His, Lys, Met, Asn, Pro, Gln, Arg, Ser, Thr (Figure 1A, spots 2–4, 6, 7, 9, 11–17). In agreement with these data, a SPOT assay with ScfUbr1 as well as mouse MmfUbr1 and MmfUbr2 showed that yeast Ubr1 could bind to Met-Leu-eK(3-10) but not to Met-Lys-eK(3-10) (with Lys at position 2) and that the binding patterns of mouse Ubr1 and Ubr2 were similar to those of yeast Ubr1, including the absence of binding to Nt-acetylated counterparts of the unacetylated peptides (Figure 1B). Given the pattern of retention of N-terminal Met in nascent proteins (see Introduction), the SPOT results suggested that Ubr1 can target proteins in vivo through their retained unacetylated N-terminal Met if it is followed by one of the large Ф residues Leu, Phe, Tyr, Trp, or Ile. We show, below, that this is indeed the case. The corresponding degrons of Met-Ф and AcMet-Ф proteins were termed MetФ/N-degrons and AcMetФ/N-degrons, respectively. The 35 kDa Met-Z-eK-ha-Ura3 (MZ-Ura3) reporters comprised N-terminal Met, a varying residue Z at position 2, the eK extension (see above), the ha epitope, and S. cerevisiae Ura3. MZ-Ura3 proteins were produced through the cotranslational deubiquitylation of Ub-MZ-Ura3, expressed in yeast using low copy plasmids and the PCUP1 promoter (Hwang et al., 2010bHwang C.-S. Shemorry A. Varshavsky A. N-terminal acetylation of cellular proteins creates specific degradation signals.Science. 2010; 327: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). We showed previously that ML-Ura3 in wild-type (WT) cells was at least partially Nt-acetylated in vivo by the NatC Nt-acetylase and that the resulting AcML-Ura3 was targeted for degradation by the Ac/N-end rule pathway (Figures S1A and S2A) (Hwang et al., 2010bHwang C.-S. Shemorry A. Varshavsky A. N-terminal acetylation of cellular proteins creates specific degradation signals.Science. 2010; 327: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Cycloheximide (CHX) chases indicated that the short-lived ML-Ura3 was longer lived in ubr1Δ cells (lacking the Arg/N-end rule pathway) and in naa30Δ (mak3Δ) cells (lacking the NatC Nt-acetylase) (Figures 1C and S2B). Moreover, ML-Ura3 was synergistically and nearly completely stabilized, in addition to a further increase of its prechase level, in naa30Δ ubr1Δ cells (Figure 1C). In contrast to pulse-chase assays, CHX-chases do not distinguish between “young” and “old” protein molecules. 35S-pulse-chases with ML-Ura3 (expressed from Ub-ML-Ura3 or directly as ML-Ura3) yielded results similar to those with CHX-chases (Figure 1C), including higher prechase levels of 35S-pulse-labeled ML-Ura3 in naa30Δ ubr1Δ cells versus naa30Δ cells (Figure S3A–S3D). The CHX-chase patterns with MI-Ura3 and MY-Ura3, in which Leu2 was replaced by other Ф residues, Ile, or Tyr, were similar to those with ML-Ura3. Specifically, MI-Ura3 and MY-Ura3 were short lived in naa30Δ cells but became nearly completely stable in naa30Δ ubr1Δ cells, with striking increases in their prechase levels (Figures 1D, 2A, and 2C ). The unacetylated state of ML-Ura3 in naa30Δ cells (Hwang et al., 2010bHwang C.-S. Shemorry A. Varshavsky A. N-terminal acetylation of cellular proteins creates specific degradation signals.Science. 2010; 327: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), the binding of Ubr1 to unacetylated N-terminal Met-Ф sequences (Figures 1A and 1B), and the synergistic stabilization of ML-Ura3, MI-Ura3, and MY-Ura3 by the ablation of both Ubr1 and NatC in naa30Δ ubr1Δ cells (Figures 1C, 1D, 2A, 2C, and S3A–S3D) indicated that these reporters were destroyed through their MetФ/N-degrons in naa30Δ cells. In an independent support of this conclusion, and in striking contrast to the instability of ML-Ura3, MI-Ura3, and MY-Ura3 in naa30Δ cells, the otherwise identical MK-Ura3, containing Lys2 (instead of Leu2 in ML-Ura3), was long lived in naa30Δ cells under the same conditions (Figures 2B and 2D). Moreover, the prechase level of MK-Ura3 was ∼5-fold higher than that of ML-Ura3 (Figures 2B and 2D). These in vivo results were predicted by in vitro data, as there was no significant binding of Ubr1 to N-terminal Met if position 2 was occupied by a basic residue such as Lys (Figures 1A and 1B). RT-PCR of mRNA encoding ML-Ura3 indicated no significant changes in the level of this mRNA between naa30Δ cells and naa30Δ ubr1Δ cells (Figure S4C), in striking contrast to the considerably higher levels of the ML-Ura3 protein (and of the analogous MI-Ura3 and MY-Ura3) both before and during CHX-chases in naa30Δ ubr1Δ cells (Figures 1C, 1D, 2A, and 2C). Thus, the observed increases of protein levels stemmed either largely or entirely from changes in the rate of degradation of these proteins. The ∼80-residue UBR domain of the 1,950-residue Ubr1 contains its type 1 binding site, which recognizes the N-terminal basic residues Arg, Lys, or His (Choi et al., 2010Choi W.S. Jeong B.-C. Joo Y.J. Lee M.-R. Kim J. Eck M.J. Song H.K. Structural basis for the recognition of N-end rule substrates by the UBR box of ubiquitin ligases.Nat. Struct. Mol.

Structural basis of substrate recognition and specificity in the N-end rule pathway.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 1182-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The nearby type-2 binding site of Ubr1 recognizes the large N-terminal Ф residues Leu, Phe, Tyr, Trp, or Ile (Figure 2F) (Xia et al., 2008Xia Z. Webster A. Du F. Piatkov K. Ghislain M. Varshavsky A. Substrate-binding sites of UBR1, the ubiquitin ligase of the N-end rule pathway.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 24011-24028Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To map a site that recognizes the unacetylated N-terminal Met of Met-Ф proteins, we performed glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-pulldowns with purified ML-eK-GST (ML-GST) and extracts from S. cerevisiae that expressed the flag-tagged full-length Ubr11–1950 or its fragments fUBR1-717, Ubr1209–1140f, fUbr11–310, fUbr198–518, and fUbr1209–717. The fUBR1–717 fragment, which contained the type-1 and type-2 binding sites, could bind to ML-GST, but shorter N-terminal fragments of Ubr1 or its C-terminal fragments did not bind to ML-GST (Figures 2F–2I). Dipeptides with type-1 or type-2 destabilizing N-terminal residues (Figure S1B) can inhibit, through competition, the binding of Ubr1 to proteins bearing these N-terminal residues (Varshavsky, 2011Varshavsky A. The N-end rule pathway and regulation by proteolysis.Protein Sci. 2011; 20: 1298-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). We used the type 1 Arg-Ala and/or type 2 Leu-Ala dipeptides with the previously characterized, completely defined in vitro ubiquitylation system (Hwang et al., 2010aHwang C.-S. Shemorry A. Auerbach D. Varshavsky A. The N-end rule pathway is mediated by a complex of the RING-type Ubr1 and HECT-type Ufd4 ubiquitin ligases.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 1177-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It comprised purified Ub, the Uba1 E1 enzyme, the Rad6 E2 enzyme, the Ubr1 E3 N-recognin, and the unacetylated ML-GST reporter. Leu-Ala completely inhibited the Ubr1-dependent polyubiquitylation of ML-GST (Figure 2E, lanes 4 versus 2), whereas Arg-Ala enhanced its polyubiquitylation, without negating the inhibitory effect of Leu-Ala if the two dipeptides were added together (Figure 2E, lanes 3 versus 5). The positive allosteric effect of Arg-Ala was previously observed with other type 2 N-end rule substrates, whose binding to the type 2 site of Ubr1 was shown to be allosterically enhanced by the occupancy of its type 1 site (Varshavsky, 2011Varshavsky A. The N-end rule pathway and regulation by proteolysis.Protein Sci. 2011; 20: 1298-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Together, the ubiquitylation data and the pattern of ML-GST binding to Ubr1 and its fragments (Figures 2E–2I) strongly suggested that the recognition of N-terminal Met in Met-Ф proteins by Ubr1 is mediated by its previously characterized (Xia et al., 2008Xia Z. Webster A. Du F. Piatkov K. Ghislain M. Varshavsky A. Substrate-binding sites of UBR1, the ubiquitin ligase of the N-end rule pathway.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 24011-24028Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) type 2 binding site. Studies by Wolf, Hampton, and colleagues showed that a variety of misfolded proteins can be destroyed by the Ubr1-dependent Arg/N-end rule pathway (Eisele and Wolf, 2008Eisele F. Wolf D.H.

Chem. 2012; 287: 23911-23922Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). One Ubr1 substrate of this class is the short-lived 110 kDa ΔssC22–519Leu2myc, comprising a misfolded PRC1-derived moiety, the Leu2 moiety, and the myc13 tag (Eisele and Wolf, 2008Eisele F. Wolf D.H. Degradation of misfolded protein in the cytoplasm is mediated by the ubiquitin ligase Ubr1.FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 4143-4146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Because ΔssC22–519Leu2myc starts with Met-Ile (a Met-Ф sequence), we asked whether this protein, denoted as MI-ΔssC22–519Leu2myc, was targeted through its N-terminal Met. CHX-chases of MI-ΔssC22–519Leu2myc showed it to be short lived in WT cells and significantly stabilized in ubr1Δ cells (Figures 3A and 3D ), in agreement with earlier findings (Eisele and Wolf, 2008Eisele F. Wolf D.H. Degradation of misfolded protein in the cytoplasm is mediated by the ubiquitin ligase Ubr1.FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 4143-4146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). MI-ΔssC22-519Leu2myc was stabilized in double-mutant naa30Δ ubr1Δ cells even stronger than in ubr1Δ cells, with a further increase of its prechase level (Figures 3A and 3D). MI-ΔssC22-58Ura3ha, containing the first 37 residues of the ΔssC22-519 moiety, the Ura3 moiety, and the ha tag, was also short lived in WT cells, and was strikingly stabilized in ubr1Δ cells (Figures 3B and 3E). Given the presence of Ubr1-dependent MetФ/N-degrons in MZ-Ura3 proteins (Figures 1C, 1D, and 2A–2D), the results with MI-ΔssC22-519Leu2myc and MI-ΔssC22-58Ura3ha (Figures 3A, 3B, and 3D) indicated that these proteins were destroyed largely through their MetФ/N-degrons. If so, the Ile2→Lys2 mutation should abrogate this degradation in WT cells, because Ubr1 does not bind to N-terminal Met-Lys (Figures 1A and 1B). Indeed, MK-ΔssC22-58Ura3ha was completely stable in WT cells, in striking contrast to the degradation of the otherwise identical MI-ΔssC22-58Ura3ha (Figure 3C). In sum, at least some misfolded Met-Ф proteins, including MI-ΔssC22-519Leu2myc and MI-ΔssC22-58Ura3ha, are destroyed by the Arg/N-end rule pathway through their MetФ/N-degrons. The findings so far indicated the following mode of degradation of a Met-Ф protein (Figures 1, 2, and 3):(1)The unacetylated N-terminal Met of a Met-Ф protein can act as a MetФ/N-degron, leading to the degradation of this protein by the Ubr1-dependent Arg/N-end rule pathway.(2)Nt-acetylation converts a MetФ/N-degron into AcMetФ/N-degron and thereby shifts the targeting of the resulting AcMet-Ф protein to the Ac/N-end rule pathway. The dual-pathway circuit that is revealed by this understanding (Figures 6 and 7) comprises the Nt-acetylated AcMet-Ф protein, the at least transient presence of its unacetylat"

Neuronal microcircuits in primary sensory cortex process sensory input and subsequently transmit output signals to other distant cortical regions for further processing (Felleman and Van Essen, 1991Felleman D.J.

Distinct output pathways from primary sensory cortex are thought to be critically important for differential processing of sensory information, with different cortical signaling streams facilitating different aspects of sensory perception and sensorimotor coordination (Goodale and Milner, 1992Goodale M.A. Milner A.D.

Classical extracellular recordings from putative long-range projection neurons identified by antidromic stimulation in behaving monkeys show that cortical projection neurons with distinct cortical (Movshon and Newsome, 1996Movshon J.A.

Cortical projection neurons might therefore play important roles in generating distinct information streams in the large-scale neocortical neuronal network through target-specific action potential (AP) firing. APs are driven by membrane potential (Vm) depolarization beyond a relatively well-defined threshold as measured at the soma (Azouz and Gray, 2000Azouz R. Gray C.M.

In order to understand the cellular mechanisms driving AP firing, it is therefore essential to record Vm changes, which are largely driven by synaptic inputs. Interestingly, in vitro brain slice studies have revealed differences in the synaptic connectivity of cortical neurons that have axonal projections to other cortical or subcortical regions (Morishima and Kawaguchi, 2006Morishima M.

However, nothing is currently known about how projection neurons integrate incoming synaptic input to compute functionally tuned output signals during animal behavior. In this study, we combined retrograde fluorescent labeling with in vivo targeted whole-cell recordings in behaving mice to measure Vm dynamics of cortical neurons projecting to other cortical areas. We focused on the primary somatosensory barrel cortex (S1) of mice, which contains a remarkable map of the mystacial vibrissae such that each whisker is individually represented in a well-defined cortical barrel column (Petersen, 2007Petersen C.C.H.

Therefore, the whisker sensorimotor cortex offers unique opportunities for linking the architecture of specific local microcircuits to large-scale cortical processing of sensory information. Here, we specifically measured the Vm dynamics of layer 2/3 neurons in the C2 barrel column projecting to M1, which we compare to neurons residing in the same layer and barrel column, but projecting to S2. Our results indicate that M1- and S2-projecting neurons have distinct intrinsic membrane properties and that they differently process incoming synaptic input to compute functionally relevant, target-specific output signals. We labeled S1 neurons that project to M1 and S2 of the ipsilateral hemisphere using the retrograde tracer choleratoxin subunit B (CTB) conjugated with fluorescent dyes (Figures 1A–1C) (Conte et al., 2009Conte W.L.

Protoc. 2009; 4: 1157-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Injection of CTB conjugated with different fluorescent dyes into M1 and S2 revealed that the spatial location of retrogradely labeled neurons was intermingled in layer 2/3 of the C2 barrel column of S1 (Figure 1C), and only very few cells were double-labeled with both tracers (0.8% ± 0.2% of total CTB-labeled cells at the subpial depth of 0–300 μm, n = 4 mice) (Sato and Svoboda, 2010Sato T.R.

By selectively expressing GFP in CTB-labeled cells using in vivo single-cell electroporation (Kitamura et al., 2008Kitamura K. Judkewitz B. Kano M. Denk W. Häusser M. Targeted patch-clamp recordings and single-cell electroporation of unlabeled neurons in vivo.Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), we confirmed that CTB-labeled neurons in S1 had extensive axonal arborizations in the CTB injection sites (n = 10 out of 10 cells; Figure 1D; Figures S1A and S1B available online). Furthermore, using transgenic mice to label inhibitory neurons, we confirmed that the vast majority of CTB-labeled projection neurons in S1 were not GABAergic (Figures S1C and S1D) (Tamamaki and Tomioka, 2010Tamamaki N. Tomioka R. Long-range GABAergic connections distributed throughout the neocortex and their possible function.Front. Neurosci. 2010; 4: 202Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To measure Vm dynamics of S1 projection neurons, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from CTB-labeled neurons in S1 were obtained under visual control using a two-photon microscope (Margrie et al., 2003Margrie T.W.

The subpial recording depth was 165 ± 4 μm (n = 71, range: 110–245 μm) for M1-projecting neurons and 160 ± 4 μm (n = 63, range: 110–245 μm) for S2-projecting neurons (not different comparing M1- and S2-projecting neurons, p = 0.40) (Figure 2A). We first examined basic membrane properties of the projection neurons during quiet wakefulness, defined as the periods when the whiskers were not moving. M1- and S2-projecting neurons exhibited a similar mean Vm (M1-projecting neurons, –66.5 ± 0.6 mV, n = 42; S2-projecting neurons, –65.6 ± 0.7 mV, n = 42; p = 0.48) and AP threshold was also similar (M1-projecting neurons, –42.4 ± 0.6 mV, n = 27; S2-projecting neurons, –41.8 ± 0.6 mV, n = 29; p = 0.59) (Figure S2). Spontaneous AP rate was low for both these cell-types (M1-projecting neurons, 0.10 ± 0.02 Hz, n = 42; S2-projecting neurons, 0.14 ± 0.03 Hz, n = 42; p = 0.72). Whereas these electrophysiological properties of M1- and S2-projecting neurons were similar, we also found striking differences. S2-projecting neurons had significantly larger input resistance (Rin) (M1-projecting neurons, 35.1 ± 2.0 MΩ, n = 36; S2-projecting neurons, 54.7 ± 3.8 MΩ, n = 34; p < 0.0001) (Figure 2B). S2-projecting neurons also had significantly longer membrane time constants (Tau) (M1-projecting neurons, 6.5 ± 0.5 ms, n = 36; S2-projecting neurons, 9.9 ± 1.0 ms, n = 34; p = 0.0007) (Figure 2B). Presumably as a result of the higher Rin, S2-projecting neurons were significantly more excitable than M1-projecting neurons, with S2-projecting neurons showing a left-shifted spike frequency-current relationship (p < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA; Figures 2C and 2D). Furthermore, the speed of AP repolarization was significantly slower in S2-projecting neurons compared to M1-projecting neurons (Figure S2). Taken together, these results show that M1- and S2-projecting neurons have distinct intrinsic membrane properties in vivo.

Interestingly, the amplitude of such slow Vm dynamics was larger in M1-projecting neurons compared to S2-projecting neurons. Integrating across low-frequency components of the Vm fast Fourier transform (FFT) spectrogram during quiet wakefulness, we found that M1-projecting neurons had ∼50% larger amplitude 1–5 Hz Vm fluctuations compared to S2-projecting neurons (M1-projecting neurons, 6.1 ± 0.4 mV, n = 10; S2-projecting neurons, 4.2 ± 0.6 mV, n = 10; p = 0.021) (Figures 3A–3C). Furthermore, the overall standard deviation (SD) of Vm fluctuations during quiet wakefulness was also significantly larger in M1-projecting neurons compared to S2-projecting neurons (M1-projecting neurons, 4.5 ± 0.3 mV, n = 10; S2-projecting neurons, 3.0 ± 0.4 mV, n = 10; p = 0.010) (Figures 3A and 3C). Given that Rin of M1-projecting neurons is lower than S2-projecting neurons, this suggests that M1-projecting neurons receive substantially stronger synaptic input during quiet wakefulness. During exploratory rhythmic whisking there is a profound shift in brain state such that excitatory layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons reduce slow Vm fluctuations and depolarize (Crochet and Petersen, 2006Crochet S.

Slow Vm fluctuations were attenuated during whisking in both cell-types, quantified through the 1-5 Hz integral of the Vm FFT (M1-projecting neurons, 2.6 ± 0.3 mV, n = 10, p = 0.002 compared to quiet wakefulness; S2-projecting neurons, 2.3 ± 0.4 mV, n = 10; p = 0.002 compared to quiet wakefulness). Whisking also significantly reduced Vm standard deviation in both types of projection neurons (M1-projecting neurons, 2.4 ± 0.2 mV, n = 10, p = 0.002 compared to quiet wakefulness; S2-projecting neurons, 2.1 ± 0.3 mV, n = 10; p = 0.004 compared to quiet wakefulness) (Figures 3A–3C). Both cell-types also depolarized during whisking (Vm during whisking: M1-projecting neurons, –63.7 ± 0.7 mV, n = 40, p < 0.0001 compared to quiet wakefulness; S2-projecting neurons, –64.1 ± 0.8 mV, n = 41; p < 0.0001 compared to quiet wakefulness) (Figure 3D). Overall mean AP rate for both cell-types remained low during whisking (M1-projecting neurons, 0.21 ± 0.10 Hz, n = 40; S2-projecting neurons, 0.15 ± 0.08 Hz, n = 41) (Figure 3E). However, a small fraction of both M1- and S2-projecting neurons changed spike rate during whisking, with a significant fraction of S2-projecting neurons decreasing firing rate (p = 0.013, Wilcoxon signed rank test) (Figures 3E and 3F). A subset of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons show rapid Vm dynamics phase-locked to the whisking cycle (Crochet and Petersen, 2006Crochet S. Petersen C.C.H. Correlating whisker behavior with membrane potential in barrel cortex of awake mice.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 608-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, Poulet and Petersen, 2008Poulet J.F.A.

We therefore next examined the relationship between whisker movement filmed with a high-speed camera and rapid Vm dynamics in defined projection neurons (Figure 4). M1-projecting neurons showed a fast Vm modulation phase-locked to the whisking cycle, which was not obvious in S2-projecting neurons (Figure 4A). Averaging Vm segments aligned at the peak of protraction (Figure 4B) revealed that M1-projecting neurons had a significantly larger Vm modulation than S2-projecting neurons (M1-projecting neurons, 1.51 ± 0.33 mV, n = 14; S2-projecting neurons, 0.83 ± 0.08 mV, n = 13; p = 0.038) (Figure 4C). Averaging Vm at random timing during whisking periods (shuffling) revealed that fast Vm modulation phase-locked to whisker protraction was significantly above chance level in M1-projecting neurons, but not in S2-projecting neurons (shuffled Vm modulation: M1-projecting neurons, 0.76 ± 0.05 mV, n = 14, p = 0.0001 shuffled compared to protraction-triggered Vm modulation of M1-projecting neurons; S2-projecting neurons, 0.59 ± 0.07 mV, n = 13; p = 0.17 shuffled compared to protraction-triggered Vm modulation of S2-projecting neurons) (Figure 4C). Furthermore, during whisking, the Vm was more highly correlated with whisker position in M1-projecting neurons compared to S2-projecting neurons (absolute peak value of cross-correlation: M1-projecting neurons, 0.33 ± 0.02, n = 12; S2-projecting neurons, 0.26 ± 0.02, n = 11; p = 0.012) (Figures 4D and 4E). Averaging the Vm aligned to whisking phase, through the Hilbert transform, revealed stronger phase-locked Vm modulation in M1-projecting neurons (the phase-locked Vm amplitude: M1-projecting neurons, 2.15 ± 0.33 mV, n = 14; S2-projecting neurons, 1.18 ± 0.14 mV, n = 13; p = 0.023) (Figures 4F and 4G). The most depolarized phase of the Vm relative to the whisker movement varied across cells, but it was mostly in more retracted phases in M1-projecting neurons (Figure 4H). Taken together, these results suggest that fast Vm modulation phase-locked to whisker movement is more prominent in M1-projecting neurons compared to S2-projecting neurons. Thus, M1-projecting neurons are more specialized for encoding whisker position on the millisecond timescale. To investigate how sensory information is transmitted from S1 to M1 and S2, we next examined Vm changes evoked by tactile stimulation. In response to a brief (1 ms) passive deflection of the contralateral C2 whisker during quiet wakefulness, only a subset of the projection neurons in the C2 barrel column fired APs with a probability of more than 10% within 0.1 s after stimulation (4 out of 15 cells among M1-projecting neurons, 2 out of 15 among S2-projecting neurons) or within 0.3 s after stimulation (5 o"
https://openalex.org/W2091222604,"We examined the contribution of the amygdala to value signals within orbital prefrontal cortex (OFC) and medial prefrontal cortex (MFC). On each trial, monkeys chose between two stimuli that were associated with different quantities of reward. In intact monkeys, as expected, neurons in both OFC and MFC signaled the reward quantity associated with stimuli. Contrasted with MFC, OFC contained a larger proportion of neurons encoding reward quantity and did so with faster response latencies. Removing the amygdala eliminated these differences, mainly by decreasing value coding in OFC. Similar decreases occurred in OFC immediately before and after reward delivery. Although the amygdala projects to both OFC and MFC, we found that it has its greatest influence over reward-value coding in OFC. Notably, amygdala lesions did not abolish value coding in OFC, which shows that OFC's representations of the value of objects, choices, and outcomes depends, in large part, on other sources."

A central goal in biology and medicine is to understand the relationship between an individual’s genome and his/her disease susceptibility. An individual typically carries loss-of-function alleles in about 300 genes, and 15%–30% of these are classified as causing inherited disorders (1000 Genomes Project Consortium et al., 2010Abecasis G.R. Altshuler D. Auton A. Brooks L.D. Durbin R.M. Gibbs R.A. Hurles M.E. McVean G.A. 1000 Genomes Project ConsortiumA map of human genome variation from population-scale sequencing.Nature. 2010; 467: 1061-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (5936) Google Scholar). Unrelated individuals typically have genomes that differ from one another by approximately 0.5%–1.0% with respect to copy number and sequence, any of which might cause alterations in traits, ranging from physical characteristics to disease susceptibility (Conrad et al., 2010Conrad D.F.

The relationship between an individual’s genome and his or her phenome is highly complex, and the mechanisms that regulate the relationship are poorly understood (Gibson and Wagner, 2000Gibson G. Wagner G. Canalization in evolutionary genetics: a stabilizing theory?.Bioessays. 2000; 22: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Although it has been hypothesized that mechanisms exist to actively repress the impact of genomic variation on phenotypic outcome (de Visser et al., 2003de Visser J.A. Hermisson J. Wagner G.P.

Robustness: mechanisms and consequences.Trends Genet. 2009; 25: 395-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), these have for the most part remained a mystery. Such mechanisms could have profound effects on the contributions that genome variation makes to disease susceptibility. Moreover, impairment of these mechanisms might increase disease risk by elevating the impact of existing genomic variation, making their identification of high interest and significance. Because genomic variation likely has its most primary effect on gene expression, we hypothesized that counteracting mechanisms might operate at this level. We have focused our attention on microRNAs (miRNAs) as potential mediators of such mechanisms. They are well suited to potentially dampen the impact of genomic variation because they regulate a majority of protein-coding genes via posttranscriptional repression (Bartel, 2009Bartel D.P. MicroRNAs: target recognition and regulatory functions.Cell. 2009; 136: 215-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15852) Google Scholar). They are common components of negative feedback and feedforward regulatory motifs with their gene targets (Ebert and Sharp, 2012Ebert M.S. Sharp P.A. Roles for microRNAs in conferring robustness to biological processes.Cell. 2012; 149: 515-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar, Tsang et al., 2007Tsang J.

Cell. 2007; 26: 753-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). These motifs can confer homeostasis to target protein levels, thereby buffering variation in upstream processes such as chromatin dynamics, transcription, and splicing. miRNAs exert modest repression on their targets, but they act rapidly to change protein synthesis (Carthew and Sontheimer, 2009Carthew R.W. Sontheimer E.J. Origins and Mechanisms of miRNAs and siRNAs.Cell. 2009; 136: 642-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3776) Google Scholar). This restrained yet rapid action makes them particularly effective for regulating homeostasis. When any significant drift from the desired steady state of a target protein leads to pathological consequences, miRNAs may counteract such outcomes. The links between human disease and miRNAs are extensive (Mendell and Olson, 2012Mendell J.T. Olson E.N. MicroRNAs in stress signaling and human disease.Cell. 2012; 148: 1172-1187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). However, these links by themselves offer no evidence that any of the connections are due to desuppression of genomic variation. A controlled experimental approach in a model system must be applied to determine whether such connections are possible. As a proof of principle, we have performed experiments to measure the impact of miRNAs on buffering genomic diversity. We chose to use Drosophila because its mechanism of miRNA regulation is highly conserved with humans (Carthew and Sontheimer, 2009Carthew R.W. Sontheimer E.J. Origins and Mechanisms of miRNAs and siRNAs.Cell. 2009; 136: 642-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3776) Google Scholar). Moreover, many miRNAs are conserved between the two species, including the miRNAs we have studied (Christodoulou et al., 2010Christodoulou F. Raible F. Tomer R. Simakov O. Trachana K. Klaus S. Snyman H. Hannon G.J. Bork P. Arendt D. Ancient animal microRNAs and the evolution of tissue identity.Nature. 2010; 463: 1084-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). We chose a nonpathological phenotypic outcome that occurs robustly and quantitatively to allow for sensitive detection of variation. To measure the impact of miRNAs on buffering genomic diversity, we performed multigeneration selection experiments. We show how the interaction between the miR-9a miRNA and its target gene called senseless (sens) can make a cell phenotype more resistant to genomic variation. We used whole-genome sequencing to identify candidate variants that have affected the phenotype. When miR-9a concentration is reduced, a broader group of variants appears to influence the phenotype. Thus, we have established a precedent for miRNAs to act in a mechanism that counteracts variation between different individual genomes. Determination of sensory cell fate is controlled by a network of regulatory factors in Drosophila (Figure 1A). The core circuit comprises three transcription factors required for the fate switch: Achaete (Ac), Scute (Sc), and Sens (Quan and Hassan, 2005Quan X.J. Hassan B.A. From skin to nerve: flies, vertebrates and the first helix.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 2036-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A subset of ectodermal cells is endowed with a combination of signaling inputs and transcription factors such that ac and sc transcription is established. Ac and Sc are bHLH proteins that form heterodimers with Daughterless (Da) and activate transcription of target genes. One of these target genes encodes Sens, which feeds back to regulate transcription of the ac and sc genes (Nolo et al., 2000Nolo R. Abbott L.A. Bellen H.J. Senseless, a Zn finger transcription factor, is necessary and sufficient for sensory organ development in Drosophila.Cell. 2000; 102: 349-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The switch to a sensory cell fate depends on amplification of subtle initial differences in these transcription factors between putative precursor cells leading to a binary switch in fate (Acar et al., 2006Acar M. Jafar-Nejad H. Giagtzoglou N. Yallampalli S. David G. He Y. Delidakis C. Bellen H.J. Senseless physically interacts with proneural proteins and functions as a transcriptional co-activator.Development. 2006; 133: 1979-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, Jafar-Nejad et al., 2003Jafar-Nejad H. Acar M. Nolo R. Lacin H. Pan H. Parkhurst S.M. Bellen H.J. Senseless acts as a binary switch during sensory organ precursor selection.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2966-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Amplification of these differences is achieved by coupling of positive feedback with lateral inhibition (Quan and Hassan, 2005Quan X.J. Hassan B.A. From skin to nerve: flies, vertebrates and the first helix.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 2036-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The precision of the fate switch is influenced by miR-9a and its interaction with sens. Loss of miR-9a results in more variable formation of sensory organs on the adult scutellum (Li et al., 2006Li Y. Wang F. Lee J.A. Gao F.B. MicroRNA-9a ensures the precise specification of sensory organ precursors in Drosophila.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2793-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) (Figure 1B; Table S1 available online). This effect is suppressed by reducing the expression of sens, suggesting that fate precision requires sens regulation (Figure 1C). There are two conserved binding sites for miR-9a in the 3′ UTR of the sens transcript (Figure 1D), and miR-9a can inhibit sens gene expression in cell culture (Li et al., 2006Li Y. Wang F. Lee J.A. Gao F.B. MicroRNA-9a ensures the precise specification of sensory organ precursors in Drosophila.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2793-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). To more fully probe the interaction between miR-9a and sens in vivo, we incorporated a single copy of the sens gene into a transgenic landing site on chromosome II. The transgene contained all known endogenous sens regulatory regions, and thus, its protein expression pattern was identical to the endogenous sens pattern (data not shown). Moreover, the transgene rescued the loss of the endogenous sens gene. We also generated sens transgenes with one or both miR-9a binding sites mutated within the 3′ UTR. We compared the effects of each transgene on scutellar sensory organ (SSO) fate when the endogenous sens gene was absent. The sens transgenes with mutated miR-9a binding sites showed increased variability in SSO fate (Figure 1E), similar to what was observed when miR-9a was lost. However, the mutated transgenes did not further increase fate variability when miR-9a was absent (Figure 1F). This result argues that the binding sites exclusively mediate the effects of miR-9a on reducing fate variability. To further test this, we reduced miR-9a copy number in individuals who had two copies of the sens transgene in addition to the endogenous sens gene. This increased SSO number when the sens transgene was fully wild-type but had no significant effect on SSO number when both miR-9a binding sites were mutated (Figure 1G). The sens transgenes with only one mutated site had greater SSO numbers when miR-9a copy number was reduced, suggesting that both sites mediate miR-9a regulation of sens. In summary, miR-9a regulation of sens generates a robust outcome and suppresses noise in SSO fate determination. How this occurs must be considered within the broader context of miRNA regulation. Modeling and experimental analysis indicates that a simple miRNA-target interaction can create a threshold in the relationship between target mRNA and protein synthesis (Mukherji et al., 2011Mukherji S. Ebert M.S. Zheng G.X. Tsang J.S. Sharp P.A. van Oudenaarden A. MicroRNAs can generate thresholds in target gene expression.Nat. Genet. 2011; 43: 854-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Below the transcription threshold, protein synthesis is silenced by the miRNA; above the threshold, protein output becomes highly sensitive to transcription (Figure 1H). Because miRNA is titrated away by an increasing number of transcripts, repression is weakened until protein output becomes sensitive to transcription. In this context, miR-9a might create a threshold for Sens protein output such that variable sens transcription is prevented from inappropriately triggering the positive feedback circuit (Figure 1A). Network stability during development could be due to buffering of stochastic events, environmental variation, underlying genomic variation, or some combination of the three (Félix, 2012Félix M.A. Evolution in developmental phenotype space.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2012; 22: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We first considered the impact of miR-9a-regulated sens on environmental variation. For this, we sought to sensitize the fate switch to temperature because under normal conditions, physiological temperatures between 18°C and 29°C have little effect. In a sc1 genetic background, temperature has a quantifiable effect on fate even though sc1 does not alter the Sc protein sequence (Campuzano et al., 1986Campuzano S. Balcells L. Villares R. Carramolino L. García-Alonso L. Modolell J. Excess function hairy-wing mutations caused by gypsy and copia insertions within structural genes of the achaete-scute locus of Drosophila.Cell. 1986; 44: 303-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, Sheldon, 1968Sheldon B.L. Studies on the scutellar bristles of Drosophila melanogaster. I. Basic variability, some temperature and culture effects, and responses to short-term selection in the Oregon-RC strain.Aust. J. Biol. Sci. 1968; 21: 721-740PubMed Google Scholar). The probability of SSO fate is inversely proportional to temperature (Figure 2A). We constructed four sc1 strains, each strain replacing the endogenous sens gene with a sens genomic rescue transgene. One strain had the transgene with intact miR-9a binding sites, two strains had one or the other miR-9a binding site intact, and one strain had neither binding site intact. Progressive loss of miR-9a binding sites caused a progressive enhancement of the temperature effect on SSO fate (Figure 2B; Table S2). We also altered the regulatory circuit in a different way. We reduced the copy number of the miR-9a gene from two to one and saw a similar enhancement of the temperature effect on SSO fate (Figure 2C; Table S3). This behavior shows the importance of sens regulation by miR-9a on the robustness of the cell fate switch against variation in temperature. We next focused on the importance of the miR-9a/Sens regulatory circuit on buffering genomic diversity. Almost 4% of sites in the genome have single-nucleotide variation in outbred D. melanogaster populations (Mackay et al., 2012Mackay T.F. Richards S. Stone E.A. Barbadilla A. Ayroles J.F. Zhu D. Casillas S. Han Y. Magwire M.M. Cridland J.M. et al.The Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel.Nature. 2012; 482: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Similar variation is observed in the genomes of other animal species (1000 Genomes Project Consortium et al., 2010Abecasis G.R. Altshuler D. Auton A. Brooks L.D. Durbin R.M. Gibbs R.A. Hurles M.E. McVean G.A. 1000 Genomes Project ConsortiumA map of human genome variation from population-scale sequencing.Nature. 2010; 467: 1061-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (5936) Google Scholar). Typically, multiple unlinked variants act in combination to modify developmental, physiological, and disease outcomes (Frazer et al., 2009Frazer K.A. Murray S.S. Schork N.J. Topol E.J. Human genetic variation and its contribution to complex traits.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2009; 10: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Genome-wide association studies of individuals or selection studies of populations are used to detect variants of this type. The impact of genetic variation on Drosophila SSO formation has been under investigation since 1959, making it an ideal model for this sort of analysis (Rendel, 1959Rendel J.M. Canalization of the scute phenotype of Drosophila.Evolution. 1959; 13: 425-439Crossref Google Scholar). In a sensitized sc1 background, animals subjected to selection for the highest number of SSOs transmit a heritable tendency for their offspring to have more SSOs (Rendel, 1959Rendel J.M. Canalization of the scute phenotype of Drosophila.Evolution. 1959; 13: 425-439Crossref Google Scholar). When selection is repeated generation after generation, the population progressively evolves, and the rate of evolution is a measure of the contribution that genomic diversity has on the variation in SSO fate. A low rate is seen when genomic diversity has little impact on outcome variation, whereas a high rate is seen when diversity strongly affects variation in the cell fate switch. To probe the relationship between genomic diversity and miR-9 regulation, we used sc1 strains with one copy of the sens transgene (Figures S1 and S2; Table S1). The transgene had either intact or disrupted miR-9a binding sites in its 3′ UTR. The animals also contained their normal copies of sens on chromosome III. We maintained replicate populations of individuals of well-defined number at uniform temperature to minimize the effects of population size and temperature on fate variation (Sheldon, 1968Sheldon B.L. Studies on the scutellar bristles of Drosophila melanogaster. I. Basic variability, some temperature and culture effects, and responses to short-term selection in the Oregon-RC strain.Aust. J. Biol. Sci. 1968; 21: 721-740PubMed Google Scholar). We selected individuals who had the highest number of SSOs (above the 50th percentile) and allowed these individuals to produce the next generation. This selection was repeated for several generations on the four replicate populations in each strain.Figure S2Crossing Schemes to Generate Genomic Backgrounds for sens Selection Experiments, Related to Figure 3Show full captionThe sens transgenic stocks were backcrossed to the basal sc w stock twice.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The sens transgenic stocks were backcrossed to the basal sc w stock twice. Realized heritability (h2) measures the proportion of total variation in outcome that is attributable to the effects of the genome (Falconer and Mackay, 1996Falconer D.S. Mackay T.F.C. Introduction to Quantitative Genetics. Longman, Harlow1996Google Scholar). A maximal h2 value of one would occur if genomic diversity perfectly dictated the observed variation in outcome. An h2 of zero occurs when no genomic component affects the variation in outcome. In our case, h2 is then a measure of the impact of genomic diversity on variation in SSO fate. We quantified the cumulative response in SSO fate as a function of the cumulative selection pressure over five generations of selection. The response was proportional to the selection pressure, and the slope of the fitted regression line, h2, was a constant (Figure 3A). We found that h2 was dependent on the integrity of miR-9a binding sites in the sens transgene. Higher h2 values were reproducibly observed when miR-9a binding sites were disrupted (Figure 3B). Assuming a uniform genomic landscape between experimental strains at the experiment’s beginning, this result implies that sens regulation by miR-9a suppresses the impact of genomic diversity on the observed variation in SSO fate. We could not confirm or disprove the assumption of uniform starting landscapes in our experiment because each transgene was incorporated into a unique founder individual from a common population. Therefore, we sought to measure h2 in strains with different concentrations of miR-9a. We constructed two new strains: one containing the normal miR-9a gene copy number of two, and the other containing a single gene copy (Figures S1 and S3). Each strain was carefully introgressed with the other to ensure that the genomic landscape of each was well matched except for the region encompassing the miR-9a gene. Replicate populations for each strain were then independently subjected to selection for individuals with the highest number of SSOs to sire the next generation. Selection was repeated for 15 generations, generating a response in SSO fate that was proportional to selection pressure (Figures 3C and 3D). The strain with a single miR-9a copy had the expected effect, causing an increase in h2 compared to the situation with two copies of miR-9a (Figure 3E). The ability of two different perturbations (miR-9a concentration and deregulation of the miR-9a target sens) to elicit the same effect on h2 is strong evidence that miR-9a regulation of sens is important for buffering the impact of genomic diversity on variation in SSO fate. To test the generality of this miRNA effect on the genome, we collected data for another miRNA called miR-7. A set of miR-7 targets encodes for E(spl) transcription factors that repress ac and sc transcription (Lai et al., 2005Lai E.C. Tam B. Rubin G.M. Pervasive regulation of Drosophila Notch target genes by GY-box-, Brd-box-, and K-box-class microRNAs.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1067-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and, therefore, inhibit the cell fate switch (Figure 1A). We reduced the copy number of the miR-7 gene in a sensitized sc1 background (Figures S1 and S4), which impaired the cell fate switch as predicted (Figure S5A). The strains with one or two copies of miR-7 were subjected to selection for individuals with the greatest number of SSOs. After 15 generations, the heritable response to selection was quantified as a function of the cumulative selection pressure (Figures S5B and S5C). In these strains, h2 was not significantly different from each other (p = 0.101, Z test). We also grew the two strains at different temperatures, and we found that the effect of temperature on SSO fate was unchanged whether one or two copies of the miR-7 gene were present (Figure S5D; Table S4). This lack of an effect on temperature- and genome-induced variation highlights the specificity of miR-9a on these processes for the cell fate switch.Figure S5miR-7 Does Not Affect Robustness to Genomic and Temperature Variation, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) SSO formation is inhibited when miR-7 concentration is reduced.

Error bars are standard errors. The ANOVA of this data is further described in Table S4. A heritable response to selection is predicted to occur when the genomic landscape of a population changes from its initial state during the selection process. Guided by this prediction, we sought to identify those changes in the genome that occurred during the miR-9a selection experiment. We applied shotgun sequencing to pooled genomes sampled before and after the selection experiment (Figure S6A; Table S5). As a further control, we also sequenced genomes from populations that had been randomly selected for 15 generations in parallel with the experimental groups. We achieved a minimum average coverage of 29 reads per genomic site per strain, allowing for variant identification with a maximum false discovery rate of 2% (Table S5). Across all strains and conditions, we identified 730,479 variants (SNPs and indels) in 120.4 Mb of sequence (an average of 6.1 variants per kb of genome). The genomic landscape of a population is determined by the distribution of variants and the allele frequency for each variant. We measured the allele frequencies for all variants, in a given strain and state of selection. Importantly, the allele frequency distributions between one- and two-copy miR-9a strains before selection were highly similar (Figure S6B). Coupled with the observation that the number of variants was comparable between the two strains (Table S5), this observation confirmed that genomic diversity in the one- and two-copy strains was similar prior to selection. For each variant, we calculated the difference in allele frequency between the selected and randomly selected groups. We plotted these allele frequency differences for all variants in both replicate populations (Figures 4A and 4B ). Most variants had a propensity to modestly change allele frequency in a manner that was not necessarily repeated in replicate populations. These variants were presumably changing because of random genetic drift in each population. However, a small fraction of variants (0.1%–0.2%) showed stronger allele frequency change repeatedly in replicate populations. The intensity and reproducibility of these changes suggest that they possibly occurred because of selection. This type of change was observed in strains with either one or two copies of the miR-9a gene (Figures 4A–4C). The reproducible responses may be regarded as a single realization in a large space of possible changes in the genomic landscape. We focused on the variants that exhibited strong and reproducible changes in allele frequency (Figure 4C). We mapped these variants to the genome and found that they clustered into discrete blocks of varying lengths (Figures 4D and 4E). We expec"
https://openalex.org/W2057026113,"A fundamental challenge for maintaining spatial orientation and interacting with the world is knowledge of our orientation relative to gravity, i.e., head tilt. Sensing gravity is complicated because of Einstein's equivalence principle, in which gravitational and translational accelerations are physically indistinguishable. Theory has proposed that this ambiguity is solved by tracking head tilt through multisensory integration. Here we identify a group of Purkinje cells in the caudal cerebellar vermis with responses that reflect an estimate of head tilt. These tilt-selective cells are complementary to translation-selective Purkinje cells, such that their population activities sum to the net gravitoinertial acceleration encoded by the otolith organs, as predicted by theory. These findings reflect the remarkable ability of the cerebellum for neural computation and provide quantitative evidence for a neural representation of gravity, whose calculation relies on long-postulated theoretical concepts such as internal models and Bayesian priors."

Notably, when the agent’s prediction was concordant rather than discordant with the subject’s own likely prediction, participants credited people more than algorithms for correct predictions and penalized them less for incorrect predictions. Neurally, many components of the mentalizing network—medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, temporoparietal junction, and precuneus—represented or updated expertise beliefs about both people and algorithms.

However, how this aroma is perceived in the mammalian olfactory system remains a great mystery. Here, we show that muscone, one musk odor secreted by various animals from stink glands, activates a few glomeruli clustered in a neuroanatomically unique anteromedial olfactory bulb. The muscone-responsive glomeruli are highly specific to macrocyclic ketones; interestingly, other synthetic musk odorants with nitro or polycyclic moieties or ester bonds activate distinct but nearby glomeruli. Anterodorsal bulbar lesions cause muscone anosmia, suggesting that this region is involved in muscone perception. Finally, we identified the mouse olfactory receptor, MOR215-1, that was a specific muscone receptor expressed by neurons innervating the muscone-responsive anteromedial glomeruli and also the human muscone receptor, OR5AN1. The current study documents the olfactory neural pathway in mice that senses and transmits musk signals from receptor to brain."

It is increasingly recognized that adipose tissue critically regulate metabolic homeostasis via secretion of various adipocytokines and metabolic factors (10Trayhurn P. Bing C. Wood I.S. Adipose tissue and adipokines–energy regulation from the human perspective.J. Nutr. 2006; 136: 1935S-1939SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adipose tissue is also a major source of the plasma ROS (3Furukawa S. Fujita T. Shimabukuro M. Iwaki M. Yamada Y. Nakajima Y. Nakayama O. Makishima M. Matsuda M. Shimomura I.

Role of mitochondrial dysfunction in insulin resistance.Circ. Res. 2008; 102: 401-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). In addition, ROS overproduction in adipose tissue leads to decreased expression of anti-oxidative enzymes, increased expression of NADPH oxidase, and dysregulation of adipocytokine expression (e.g. adiponectin and IL-6) (3Furukawa S.

Apelin, a novel peptide hormone and relatively recent addition of adipocytokine family, is abundantly secreted by adipocytes (16Than A. Tee W.T. Chen P.

Through interaction with G-protein coupled APJ receptors, apelin plays important roles in regulating energy metabolism, and has been recognized with its anti-obesity and anti-diabetic properties (18Castan-Laurell I. Dray C. Attané C. Duparc T. Knauf C. Valet P. Apelin, diabetes, and obesity.Endocrine. 2011; 40: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Apelin, for examples, promotes glucose utilization and fatty acid oxidation in muscles of insulin-resistant mice (19Attané C. Foussal C. Le Gonidec S. Benani A. Daviaud D. Wanecq E. Guzmán-Ruiz R.

Apelin ameliorates TNF-α-induced reduction of glycogen synthesis in the hepatocytes through G protein-coupled receptor APJ.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e57231Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and suppresses adipogenesis and lipolysis (22Than A.

Interestingly, apelin has also been shown to alleviate oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells (23Foussal C. Lairez O. Calise D. Pathak A. Guilbeau-Frugier C. Valet P.

Apelin signaling antagonizes Ang II effects in mouse models of atherosclerosis.J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 3343-3354PubMed Google Scholar). However, its regulations of oxidative stress in adipocytes have never been investigated. Considering that apelin expression in adipocytes is up-regulated in obesity (17Boucher J. Masri B. Daviaud D.

Surg. 2009; 19: 1574-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), we speculate that apelin may act as the feedback control to limit obesity-associated oxidative stress. Here, we aim for the first time to reveal the effects of apelin on ROS production and oxidative stress in adipocytes, using human primary adipocyte as the in vitro cell model. Our results show that apelin/APJ suppresses ROS production and release by regulating anti- and pro-oxidant enzyme expressions via MAPK kinase/ERK and AMPK signaling pathways. In addition, we provide evidence that apelin can prevent oxidative-stress-induced dysregulations of ROS-related enzyme expressions, release of anti-inflammatory adipocytokine (adiponectin) and pro-inflammatory adipocytokines (IL-6, TNFα), as well as mitochondrial biogenesis and function. Our experiments also show that oxidative stress stimulates apelin release from adipocytes. This study highlights apelin as a promising therapeutic target for oxidative stress-related metabolic disorders. Human pre-adipocytes (SP-F-2; Zen-Bio Inc.), collected from subcutaneous adipose tissue of non-diabetic male subjects (with body-mass-index 25–29.9), were cultured in pre-adipocyte growth medium (DMEM/Nutrient mixture F-12 medium (1:1, v/v) containing 15 mm HEPES, 2 mm l-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin), at 37 °C and in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Two days after reaching confluence (defined as day 0), the cells were induced to differentiate into mature adipocytes similarly as the previously reported (27Than A. Leow M.K. Chen P. Control of adipogenesis by the autocrine interplays between angiotensin 1–7/Mas receptor and angiotensin II/AT1 receptor signaling pathways.J. Biol.

Optimization of the differentiation of human preadipocytes in vitro.Differentiation. 2005; 73: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Specifically, the cells were incubated with adipocyte growth medium (serum-free DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium containing 15 mm HEPES, 2 mm l-glutamine, 33 μm biotin, 17 μm pantothenate, 10 μg/ml transferrin, 0.2 nm triiodothyronine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin) supplemented with 0.5 μg/ml insulin, 1 μm dexamethasone, and 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), and 10 μm rosiglitazone. On day 2 of differentiation, the cells were treated for 2 days with the growth medium containing insulin and dexamethasone. The medium was thereafter replaced with the growth medium alone, every 2 days in the following 8–10 days. Adipocytes differentiation was confirmed by Oil-red-O staining and visual appearance of intracellular lipid droplets. For knockdown of apelin (APLN) or APJ receptor (APLNR), cells (day 6–7 after induction of differentiation) were transfected with control siRNA or apelin siRNA or APLNR-siRNA (25 nm) (SantaCruz Biotech) using Lipofectamine-RNAiMAX transfection reagent (Invitrogen) for 2 days. Adipocytes were then maintained in the growth medium for 2–3 days before the experiments. Knocking down of apelin or APJ receptor expression was confirmed by immunoblot analyses. All culture media, supplements and sera were purchased from Invitrogen. Unless otherwise stated, all reagents and chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Adipocytes grown on the glass-coverslips were placed in an imaging-chamber filled with the growth medium before imaging with a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 510 Meta, Carl Zeiss GMbH, Germany). For detection of intracellular ROS, the cells were loaded with 6-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorodihydro fluorescein diacetate (carboxy-H2DCFDA, 20 μm, Invitrogen), a ROS indicator which gives green fluorescence while being oxidized by ROS. After incubation with the dye for 30 min at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator, adipocytes were then washed with the growth medium, followed by 200 μm H2O2 treatment for 60 min (or without the treatment as control). Excited at 488 nm, the fluorescence of the dye was monitored with a 505–550 nm filter. For co-localization studies of cellular and mitochondrial ROS, cells were loaded for 30 min with carboxy-H2DCFDA and 0.2 μm MitoTracker Red CM-H2Xros (Invitrogen). The latter, which is a reduced non-fluorescent version of MitoTracker Red, accumulates in mitochondria and fluoresces upon oxidation by ROS generated in mitochondria. To reveal the mitochondrial morphology, the cells were loaded with 0.2 μm MitoTracker Red-FM (Invitrogen). The MitoTracker fluorescence was measured above 580 nm using 543 nm as the excitation wavelength. For detecting superoxide anions (O2⨪), the cells were incubated for 30 min with 10 μm dihydroethidium dye (DHE, Sigma-Aldrich) and then washed with the cell medium. DHE oxidation by (O2⨪) produces red fluorescent 2-hydroxyethidium (29Peshavariya H.M. Dusting G.J. Selemidis S.

In some experiments, the cells were pre-treated with or without pyr-aplein13 (1 μm) and/or TNFα (50 ng/ml) before dye loading and imaging. ROS levels were quantified using a fluorescent plate reader (Victor3, PerkinElmer). The adipocytes were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and scraped in M-PER Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent (Thermo Scientific) containing freshly added protease/phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Cell Signaling Technology). After centrifugation at 4 °C, the supernatant of the sample was collected and its protein content was determined using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) based on Bradford method. Each sample with equal amount of proteins (as the loading control) was mixed with 5x SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and separated on 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) before transferring the proteins onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were then blocked at room temperature for 2–3 h with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Tris-buffered saline-Tween (TBST) (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl and 0.05% Tween-20, pH 7.4), followed by subsequent incubation at 4 °C overnight in TBST containing the different primary antibodies (1:200–400 dilution). After washing three times (15 min each) with TBST, the membranes were incubated for 6–8 h in TBST containing the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:2000–3000 dilution), followed by washing again with TBST for three times. The protein bands were detected in a G:BOX Chemi XT4 imaging system (Syngene) using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific). Antibodies against apelin (sc-33469), APJ receptor (APLNR, sc-33823), superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD-1, sc-8637), catalase (sc-34280), glutathione peroxidase-1/2 (GPx-1/2, sc-30147), p47-phox (sc-14015), PPARγ coactivator-1 (PGC-1α, sc-13067), cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COX1, sc-23982), succinate dehydrogenase subunit A (SDHA, sc-27992), Akt (sc8312), phospho-Akt (Ser-473, sc135651), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPKα1/2, sc-25792), and phospho-AMPKα1/2 (Thr-172, sc-33524) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies against extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2, cat.no. 3085-100), and phospho-ERK1/2 (cat.no. 3441-100) were purchased from Biovision. The concentration of IL-6, TNFα, adiponectin, and apelin in the medium was determined using a human IL-6 ELISA kit (RAB0306, Sigma), or a human TNFα ELISA kit (RAB0476, Sigma), or a human adiponectin EIA kit (RAB0004, Sigma), or a human apelin EIA kit (RAB0018, Sigma), respectively. Each sample contains the same amount of proteins (determined by Bradford assay as the internal control of the total cell number). Total cell antioxidant capacity was measured using the antioxidant assay kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, cell lysates with equal amount of proteins were mixed (5 min at room temperature) with myoglobin, hydrogen peroxide, and 2,2-azino-bis-3-ethylbenz-thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS), before measuring the absorbance at 405 nm using a plate reader. The cell antioxidant activity is quantitatively calibrated to the activity of a defined concentration of trolox, which is a water-soluble vitamin E analog. H2O2 released from adipocytes (total amount of cellular proteins was used as the internal control) was detected using the AmplexRed hydrogen peroxide assay kit (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. The absorbance is measured at ∼560 nm and plotted against a standard curve containing serial dilutions of known concentration of H2O2. The cellular ATP content (total amount of proteins was used as the internal control) was determined using ATP colorimetric/fluorometric assay kit (Biovision) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Optical density at 570 nm was measured as the reporter. The variability between data sets was determined by unpaired Student's t test. All results were expressed as mean ± S.E. based on the measurements from at least three independent experiments. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. In adipocytes, preproapelin (77-amino acid peptide) is expressed by APLN gene and cleaved into shorter active peptides including pyr-apelin13 (pyroglutamated 13-amino acid peptide which is the major apelin isoform in human plasma) (31Kleinz M.J. Davenport A.P. Emerging roles of apelin in biology and medicine.Pharmacol. Ther. 2005; 107: 198-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 32Zhen E.Y. Higgs R.E. Gutierrez J.A. Pyroglutamyl apelin-13 identified as the major apelin isoform in human plasma.Anal. Biochem. 2013; 442: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Apelin's functional effects are mediated by G protein-coupled APJ receptor, which is expressed by APLNR gene (33Pitkin S.L. Maguire J.J. Bonner T.I. Davenport A.P. International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology. LXXIV. Apelin receptor nomenclature, distribution, pharmacology, and function.Pharmacol. Rev. 2010; 62: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that apelin suppresses the adipocyte release of free fatty acids-one of the main contributors to the development of insulin resistance (22Than A. Cheng Y. Foh L.C. Leow M.K. Lim S.C. Chuah Y.J. Kang Y. Chen P. Apelin inhibits adipogenesis and lipolysis through distinct molecular pathways.Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2012; 362: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Since excess ROS such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide radical (O2⨪) in the condition of oxidative stress also cause insulin resistance (4Maritim A.C. Sanders R.A. Watkins 3rd., J.B. Diabetes, oxidative stress, and antioxidants: a review.J. Biochem. Mol. Toxicol. 2003; 17: 24-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (2423) Google Scholar), we sought to investigate whether apelin has any effects on ROS production and release in adipocytes. ROS level in live adipocytes was reported by a cell-permeable ROS indicator dye (carboxy-H2DCF-DA) under confocal microscopy (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1, B and C, the basal ROS level was significantly reduced in the cells pre-treated with apelin (1 μm pyr-apelin13 for 24 h). In addition, the surge of ROS level after H2O2 stimulation (200 μm for 30 min) was also largely obliterated by apelin. The real-time fluorescence measurement indicates that H2O2 causes acute cellular increase of ROS level (within 5 min) and it can be suppressed by apelin treatment (Fig. 1, D and E). To elucidate whether APJ receptor is involved in the apelin effect on ROS level, APJ receptors were knockdown using APLNR-siRNA. As expected, apelin failed to reduce basal and induced ROS levels in APLNR-gene knockdown adipocytes (Fig. 1, B and C). Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 1F, apelin treatment also suppressed H2O2 release from adipocytes. Taken together, our observations establish that, mediated by APJ receptor, apelin is able to suppress ROS production and release in adipocytes. This suggests the beneficial role of apelin to reduce oxidative stress in adipocytes as well as stress in other tissues stimulated by the released ROS from adipose. Previous studies have shown that ROS level in adipocytes was closely related to the activities and expression levels of antioxidant enzymes such as Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn SOD or SOD1), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) (3Furukawa S. Fujita T. Shimabukuro M. Iwaki M. Yamada Y. Nakajima Y. Nakayama O. Makishima M. Matsuda M. Shimomura I. Increased oxidative stress in obesity and its impact on metabolic syndrome.J. Clin.

Dysregulated glutathione metabolism links to impaired insulin action in adipocytes.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2009; 296: E1326-E1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), which are essential to prevent high ROS level caused oxidative stress and cellular damage (35Ray G. Husain S.A. Oxidants, antioxidants and carcinogenesis.Indian J. Exp. Biol. 2002; 40: 1213-1232PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1G, antioxidant activity in adipocytes was greatly augmented by apelin treatment in dose-dependent manner. Consistently, the expression of antioxidant enzymes (SOD1, catalase, and GPx) was markedly increased in apelin-treated adipocytes (Fig. 2, A–D). Contrarily, apelin significantly suppressed the expression of p47phox, which is a cytosolic subunit of the superoxide-producing enzyme complex-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NADPH oxidase) (36Babior B.M. NADPH oxidase: an update.Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2E). On the other hand, siRNA knockdown of apelin or APJ expression in adipocytes produced opposite effects, confirming the autocrine regulation of apelin on the expression of ROS-related enzymes in adipocytes (Fig. 2, F–J). Therefore, it may be concluded that apelin-APJ can refrain ROS level, at least in part, by regulating the expression and activities of both anti- and pro-oxidant enzymes. It has been increasingly recognized that ROS overproduction critically contributes to the development of insulin resistance that characterizes type 2 diabetes (4Maritim A.C. Sanders R.A.

It has been shown that TNFα can decrease insulin sensitivity in adipocytes by inducing ROS overproduction (37Cawthorn W.P. Sethi J.K.

https://openalex.org/W2045457634,"Several cross-talk mechanisms between autophagy and apoptosis have been identified, in which certain co-regulators are shared, allowing the same protein to participate in these opposing processes. Our studies suggest that caspase-9 is a novel co-regulator of apoptosis and autophagy and that its caspase catalytic activity is dispensable for its autophagic role. We provide evidence that caspase-9 facilitates the early events leading to autophagosome formation; that it forms a complex with Atg7; that Atg7 is not a direct substrate for caspase-9 proteolytic activity; and that, depending on the cellular context, Atg7 represses the apoptotic capability of caspase-9, whereas the latter enhances the Atg7-mediated formation of light chain 3-II. The repression of caspase-9 apoptotic activity is mediated by its direct interaction with Atg7, and it is not related to the autophagic function of Atg7. We propose that the Atg7·caspase-9 complex performs a dual function of linking caspase-9 to the autophagic process while keeping in check its apoptotic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2038603307,"The hippocampal CA3 region is essential for pattern completion and generation of sharp-wave ripples. During these operations, coordinated activation of ensembles of CA3 pyramidal neurons produces spatiotemporally structured input patterns arriving onto dendrites of recurrently connected CA3 neurons. To understand how such input patterns are translated into specific output patterns, we characterized dendritic integration in CA3 pyramidal cells using two-photon imaging and glutamate uncaging. We found that thin dendrites of CA3 pyramidal neurons integrate synchronous synaptic input in a highly supralinear fashion. The amplification was primarily mediated by NMDA receptor activation and was present over a relatively broad range of spatiotemporal input patterns. The decay of voltage responses, temporal summation, and action potential output was regulated in a compartmentalized fashion mainly by a G-protein-activated inwardly rectifying K(+) current. Our results suggest that plastic dendritic integrative mechanisms may support ensemble behavior in pyramidal neurons of the hippocampal circuitry."
https://openalex.org/W2052624827,"A primary determinant of the strength of neurotransmission is the number of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) at synapses. However, we still lack a mechanistic understanding of how the number of synaptic AMPARs is regulated. Here, we show that UNC-116, the C. elegans homolog of vertebrate kinesin-1 heavy chain (KIF5), modifies synaptic strength by mediating the rapid delivery, removal, and redistribution of synaptic AMPARs. Furthermore, by studying the real-time transport of C. elegans AMPAR subunits in vivo, we demonstrate that although homomeric GLR-1 AMPARs can diffuse to and accumulate at synapses in unc-116 mutants, glutamate-gated currents are diminished because heteromeric GLR-1/GLR-2 receptors do not reach synapses in the absence of UNC-116/KIF5-mediated transport. Our data support a model in which ongoing motor-driven delivery and removal of AMPARs controls not only the number but also the composition of synaptic AMPARs, and thus the strength of synaptic transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2117096101,"The altered metabolism in most tumor cells consists of elevated glucose uptake and increased glycolysis even in the presence of high oxygen tension. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is an obligatory enzyme in glycolysis. Here, we report that acetylation at lysine 254 (K254) increases GAPDH activity in response to glucose. Furthermore, acetylation of GAPDH (K254) is reversibly regulated by the acetyltransferase PCAF and the deacetylase HDAC5. Substitution of K254 to glutamine compromises the ability of GAPDH to support cell proliferation and tumor growth. Our study reveals a mechanism of GAPDH enzyme activity regulation by acetylation and its critical role in cellular regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2023901364,"Clinical obesity is a complex metabolic disorder affecting one in three adults. Recent reports suggest that pregnane X receptor (PXR), a xenobiotic nuclear receptor important for defense against toxic agents and for eliminating drugs and other xenobiotics, may be involved in obesity. Noting differences in ligand specificities between human and mouse PXRs, the role of PXR in high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity was examined using male PXR-humanized (hPXR) transgenic and PXR-knock-out (PXR-KO) mice in comparison to wild-type (WT) mice. After 16 weeks on either a control diet or HFD, WT mice showed greater weight gain, whereas PXR-KO mice gained less weight due to their resistance to HFD-induced decreases in adipose tissue peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α and induction of hepatic carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, suggesting increased energy metabolism. Interestingly, control-fed PXR-KO mice exhibited hepatomegaly, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperleptinemia but hypoadiponectinemia and lower adiponectin receptor R2 mRNA levels relative to WT mice. Evaluation of these biologic indicators in hPXR mice fed a control diet or HFD revealed further differences between the mouse and human receptors. Importantly, although HFD-fed hPXR mice were resistant to HFD-induced obesity, both PXR-KO and hPXR mice exhibited impaired induction of glucokinase involved in glucose utilization and displayed elevated fasting glucose levels and severely impaired glucose tolerance. Moreover, the basal hepatic levels of the gluconeogenic enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 were increased in hPXR mice compared with WT mice. Altogether, although the mouse PXR promotes HFD-induced obesity, the hPXR mouse carries a genetic predisposition for type 2 diabetes and thus provides a model for exploring the role of human PXR in the metabolic syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2084826637,"Ewing Sarcoma is a biologically aggressive bone and soft tissue malignancy affecting children and young adults. Ewing Sarcoma pathogenesis is driven by EWS/Ets fusion oncoproteins, of which EWS/Fli1 is the most common. We have previously shown that microRNAs (miRs) regulated by EWS/Fli1 contribute to the pro-oncogenic program in Ewing Sarcoma. Here we show that miR-22, an EWS/Fli1-repressed miR, is inhibitory to Ewing Sarcoma clonogenic and anchorage-independent cell growth, even at modest overexpression levels. Our studies further identify the H3K9me1/2 histone demethylase KDM3A (JMJD1A/JHDM2A) as a new miR-22-regulated gene. We show that KDM3A is overexpressed in Ewing Sarcoma, and that its depletion inhibits clonogenic and anchorage-independent growth in multiple patient-derived cell lines, and tumorigenesis in a xenograft model. KDM3A depletion further results in augmentation of the levels of the repressive H3K9me2 histone mark, and downregulation of pro-oncogenic factors in Ewing Sarcoma. Together, our studies identify the histone demethylase KDM3A as a new, miR-regulated, tumor promoter in Ewing Sarcoma."
https://openalex.org/W2045244782,"HER2/Neu is amplified and overexpressed in a large proportion of human breast cancers, but the signaling pathways that contribute to tumor development and metastatic progression are not completely understood. Using gene expression data and pathway signatures, we predicted a role for activator E2F transcription factors in Neu-induced tumors. This was genetically tested by interbreeding Neu transgenics with knockouts of the three activator E2Fs. Loss of any E2F delayed Neu-induced tumor onset. E2F1 loss accelerated tumor growth, while E2F2 and E2F3 loss did not. Strikingly, it was observed that loss of E2F1 or E2F2 significantly reduced the metastatic capacity of the tumor and this was associated with a reduction in circulating tumor cells in the E2F2 knockout. Gene expression analysis between the tumors in the various E2F-mutant backgrounds revealed that there was extensive compensation by other E2F family members in the individual knockouts, underscoring the importance of the E2Fs in HER2/Neu-induced tumors. Extension to HER2-positive (HER2+) human breast cancer revealed a number of HER2+ subtypes based on E2F activity with differences in relapse-free survival times. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the E2F transcription factors are integral to HER2+ tumor development and progression."
https://openalex.org/W2026686802,"In bilaterally symmetric organisms, interhemispheric communication is essential for sensory processing and motor coordination. The mechanisms that govern axon midline crossing during development have been well studied, particularly at the spinal cord. However, the molecular program that determines axonal ipsilaterality remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that ipsilateral neurons whose axons grow in close proximity to the midline, such as the ascending dorsospinal tracts and the rostromedial thalamocortical projection, avoid midline crossing because they transiently activate the transcription factor Zic2. In contrast, uncrossed neurons whose axons never approach the midline control axonal laterality by Zic2-independent mechanisms. Zic2 induces EphA4 expression in dorsospinal neurons to prevent midline crossing while Robo3 is downregulated to ensure that axons enter the dorsal tracts instead of growing ventrally. Together with previous reports, our data reveal a critical role for Zic2 as a determinant of axon midline avoidance in the CNS across species and pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2067710356,"Double electron-electron resonance is used here to investigate intermediates of the transport cycle of the Escherichia coli vitamin B12 ATP-binding cassette importer BtuCD-F. Previously, we showed the ATP-induced opening of the cytoplasmic gate I in TM5 helices, later confirmed by the AMP-PNP-bound BtuCD-F crystal structure. Here, other key residues are analyzed in TM10 helices (positions 307 and 322) and in the cytoplasmic gate II, i.e. the loop between TM2 and TM3 (positions 82 and 85). Without BtuF, binding of ATP induces detectable changes at positions 307 and 85 in BtuCD in liposomes. Together with BtuF, ATP triggers the closure of the cytoplasmic gate II in liposomes (reported by both positions 82 and 85). This forms a sealed cavity in the translocation channel in agreement with the AMP-PNP·BtuCD-F x-ray structure. When vitamin B12 and AMP-PNP are simultaneously present, the extent of complex formation is reduced, but the short 82-82 interspin distance detected indicates that the substrate does not affect the closed conformation of this gate. The existence of the BtuCD-F complex under these conditions is verified with spectroscopically orthogonal nitroxide and Gd(III)-based labels. The cytoplasmic gate II remains closed also in the vanadate-trapped state, but it reopens in the ADP-bound state of the complex. Therefore, we suggest that the substrate likely trapped in ATP·BtuCD-F can be released after ATP hydrolysis but before the occluded ADP-bound conformation is reached."
https://openalex.org/W2014212515,"The spinal cord contains many descending and ascending longitudinal tracts whose development appears to be controlled by distinct guidance systems. We identified a population of dorsal spinal neurons marked by coexpression of the transcription factor Zic2 and the guidance receptor EphA4. Zic2+;EphA4+ neurons are surrounded by mechanosensory terminals, suggesting innervation by mechanoreceptor afferents. Their axons form an ipsilateral ascending pathway that develops during embryogenesis and projects within the ventral aspect of the dorsal funiculus, the same location as the descending corticospinal tract (CST), which develops postnatally. Interestingly, the same guidance mechanism, namely, ephrinB3-induced EphA4 forward signaling, is required for the guidance of both ascending and descending axon tracts. Our analysis of conditional EphA4 mutant mice also revealed that the development of the dorsal funiculus occurs independently of EphA4 expression in descending CST axons and is linked to the distribution of Zic2+;EphA4+ spinal neurons and the formation of the ascending pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2021251760,"•CGp neurons responded phasically to errors and predicted future poor performance•Reversible inactivation of posterior cingulate blocked new learning•Default mode network activity is necessary for cognitively demanding performance The posterior cingulate cortex (CGp) is a major hub of the default mode network (DMN), a set of cortical areas with high resting activity that declines during task performance. This relationship suggests that DMN activity contributes to mental processes that are antagonistic to performance. Alternatively, DMN may detect conditions under which performance is poor and marshal cognitive resources for improvement. To test this idea, we recorded activity of CGp neurons in monkeys performing a learning task while varying reward size and novelty. We found that CGp neurons responded to errors, and this activity was magnified by small reward and novel stimuli. Inactivating CGp with muscimol impaired new learning when rewards were small but had no effect when rewards were large; inactivation did not affect performance on well-learned associations. Thus, CGp, and by extension the DMN, may support learning, and possibly other cognitive processes, by monitoring performance and motivating exploration. The posterior cingulate cortex (CGp) is a major hub of the default mode network (DMN), a set of cortical areas with high resting activity that declines during task performance.

The default mode network (DMN) is a poorly understood set of brain regions with high baseline activity that is suppressed during task engagement (Gusnard et al., 2001Gusnard D.A. Akbudak E. Shulman G.L. Raichle M.E. Medial prefrontal cortex and self-referential mental activity: relation to a default mode of brain function.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In neuroimaging experiments, its component nodes—chiefly the posterior cingulate cortex (CGp) and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)—show high levels of correlated spontaneous activity at rest (Vincent et al., 2007Vincent J.L.

Surprisingly, heightened DMN activity predicts poor performance in a variety of laboratory tasks (Hayden et al., 2009bHayden B.Y. Smith D.V. Platt M.L.

The neural bases of momentary lapses in attention.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 971-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar). One explanation for this relationship is that the DMN mediates cognitive processes, such as mind wandering (Mason et al., 2007Mason M.F. Norton M.I. Van Horn J.D. Wegner D.M. Grafton S.T. Macrae C.N. Wandering minds: the default network and stimulus-independent thought.Science. 2007; 315: 393-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (2052) Google Scholar), introspection, and temporal projection of the self (Buckner and Carroll, 2007Buckner R.L.

While this “antagonistic to cognition” interpretation is intuitive, an alternative is that DMN activation marshals neural resources to improve poor task performance. Such an interpretation is consistent with the idea that the entire cingulate cortex detects the need for enhanced cognitive engagement and recruits additional resources (Botvinick et al., 2004Botvinick M.M.

Biol. 2009; 19: 1532-1537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This model predicts high DMN activity when performance is poor—but as an outcome, rather than as a cause, of poor performance. There is some evidence supporting this possibility. CGp is often particularly active in situations that require high levels of cognitive engagement. Such situations include uncertain or conflict-rich environments where learning, adjustment, and executive control are advantageous. For example, CGp firing rates increase with reward uncertainty (McCoy and Platt, 2005McCoy A.N. Platt M.L. Risk-sensitive neurons in macaque posterior cingulate cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1220-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) and with cognitively demanding exploration of alternatives (Pearson et al., 2009Pearson J.M. Hayden B.Y. Raghavachari S.

Biol. 2009; 19: 1532-1537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Likewise, in a multiattribute decision-making study, firing rates track decision salience (difference from standard), when the need for engagement is high (Heilbronner et al., 2011Heilbronner S.R. Hayden B.Y. Platt M.L. Decision salience signals in posterior cingulate cortex.Front. Neurosci. 2011; 5: 55Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Furthermore, microstimulation of CGp neurons causes monkeys to switch to an alternative option (Hayden et al., 2008Hayden B.Y. Nair A.C. McCoy A.N. Platt M.L. Posterior cingulate cortex mediates outcome-contingent allocation of behavior.Neuron. 2008; 60: 19-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), demonstrating a causal role in exploration and behavioral switching. Together, these findings endorse the idea that CGp surveys the internal and external environment for evidence that the current model of the world is no longer working, thus motivating adaptive changes in cognition and behavior (Pearson et al., 2011Pearson J.M. Heilbronner S.R. Barack D.L. Hayden B.Y. Platt M.L. Posterior cingulate cortex: adapting behavior to a changing world.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2011; 15: 143-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). CGp, as part of the DMN, may marshal cognitive resources in difficult situations, when performance would otherwise be even worse. To test these ideas, we recorded the activity of single CGp neurons in two monkeys performing a conditional association task (cf. Halsband and Passingham, 1982Halsband U. Passingham R. The role of premotor and parietal cortex in the direction of action.Brain Res. 1982; 240: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, Petrides, 1982Petrides M.

Single neurons in the monkey hippocampus and learning of new associations.Science. 2003; 300: 1578-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) in which visual scenes were randomly paired with a saccade target. Effective performance required exploration and adaptation, an ideal probe for CGp function. Monkeys not only had to learn new scenes, but, on randomly interleaved trials, had to recall the actions associated with reference scenes used every day, thus probing recall and motor performance. Scenes were associated with either large or small rewards. We found that neurons responded phasically to errors, and this signal was enhanced when scenes were new or rewards were small—situations in which performance was poor. In addition, higher firing rates were associated with worse learning and performance. Importantly, reversible inactivation of CGp with the GABAA agonist muscimol impaired learning in the most challenging condition, when monkeys were presented with novel, low-value scenes. This finding is inconsistent with the idea that CGp activity antagonizes task performance. Instead, increased activity in CGp, and perhaps the DMN more generally, may signal poor performance and help marshal the strategic recruitment of cognitive resources. In this task, such recruitment improves learning; in different scenarios (such as the reference scenes in this task), it may contribute to other cognitive processes. We used a conditional association task to elicit stimulus-action-outcome learning over the course of dozens of trials. On each trial, a photograph (scene) and two targets appeared on a computer monitor (Figure 1A). The scene indicated that a gaze shift to one target would be rewarded. This association could only be learned through trial and error. Incorrect choices were followed by no reward. Three types of scenes were interleaved each day: reference, novel, and addition; within each type, there were high- and low-value (juice reward) scenes (see Figure 1B). Reference scenes were held constant from session to session. Four novel scenes were introduced at the start of each session. For a subset of sessions, four new scenes, hereafter referred to as additions, were introduced after several hundred trials. Monkeys performed well above chance (Figure 1C–1F). For novel and addition scenes, performance was at chance on the first ten presentations (novel: M = 50.9% correct, t(427) = 0.8, p = 0.43; additions: M = 52.8%; t(270) = 1.83, p = 0.07) but above it by the last ten presentations (novel: M = 66.7%, t(427) = 12.12, p < 0.000001; additions: M = 61.8%, t(279) = 7.17, p < 0.000001). Performance on each new scene presentation correlated with presentation number; thus, performance improved with time (novel: r = 0.37, p < 0.0001; additions: r = 0.54, p < 0.0001). Performance on reference scenes was already above chance during the first ten presentations each day (t(425) = 57.1, p < 0.000001). Performance was higher on high-value scenes than on low-value scenes across all scene types (p < 0.0001 in all 3 cases, Table 1). For new scenes, this difference emerged over the session: it was not present at the start (novel: t(211) = 0.43, p = 0.67; additions: t(136) = 0.52, p = 0.60) but was present at the end (novel: t(211) = 5.8; additions: p < 0.000001; t(136) = 2.9, p = 0.004) of the session. Thus, monkeys successfully learned the associations between stimuli, actions, and reward and subsequently recalled these associations with high fidelity.Table 1Performance on All Scene TypesHigh ValueLow ValueReference scenesSaccade Left0.970.84Saccade Right0.990.87Novel scenesSaccade Left0.660.64Saccade Right0.670.53Addition scenesSaccade Left0.650.60Saccade Right0.620.54 Open table in a new tab We recorded 140 CGp neurons (106 in monkey L, 34 in monkey B) as monkeys performed the conditional association task. Because learning in this task is based on trial and error, we hypothesized that CGp would track outcomes. Thus, we calculated the neuronal firing rates immediately following correct and incorrect choices. Figure 2B shows the average response of an example neuron aligned to the start of the outcome period (700 ms epoch beginning 600 ms after saccade offset, chosen to occur after perisaccadic activity). This neuron showed a phasic response after errors (relative to correct trials) that lasted until nearly the start of the next trial (t(1,154) = 16.3, p < 0.0001, independent samples t test on correct versus incorrect trial firing rates). For this neuron, errors elicited an average of 11.4 sp/s (46%) greater firing rate than correct responses. This pattern matched the population response (Figure 2A; t(139) = 4.08, p < 0.0001: paired-samples t test on average firing rate for correct versus error trials), which showed an average of 1.3 sp/s (17%) higher firing rate following errors compared with correct trials. Eighty-two of the 140 cells that we studied (58.5%) had significant error modulation (outcome period). Of these, 63 (76.8%) fired at higher rates following incorrect choices; the other 19 fired at higher rates following correct choices. By start of the next trial, this modulation was no longer statistically significant (0.2 sp/s) but still trended in the same direction, t(139) = 1.75, p = 0.08 (paired-samples t test for correct versus error trial firing rates, first 300 ms of fixation period on subsequent trial). By the time the scene appeared on the next trial, modulation by a previous error was gone, t(139) = −0.66, p = 0.51 (paired-samples t test for correct versus error trial firing rates, 500 ms following scene onset on subsequent trial). If activation of CGp neurons competes with brain regions responsible for enhancing performance on a trial-by-trial basis, this error signal would be expected to be prepotent, beginning before feedback or overt choice. However, if neuronal activity in CGp facilitates performance, it should track feedback for monitoring and control purposes. We thus examined whether activity earlier in the trial (scene epoch—500 ms following scene onset) predicted performance. The error signal was not prepotent (t(139) = 0.52, p = 0.6, paired-samples t test on average firing rate for correct versus error trials). In this task, we varied scene novelty and value, parameters that should influence control signals. The error signal in CGp varied with stimulus novelty and thus the need for learning. Specifically, errors on new scenes elicited higher firing rates than errors on reference scenes (t(139) = 2.19, p = 0.03, paired-samples t test on novel + addition scene versus reference scene errors, outcome period; Figure 2C). This was not true following correct choices (p = 0.74). The novelty effect on the error signal was quite small (0.45 sp/s). There was no effect of novelty on firing rates during scene presentation (t(139) = 0.60, p = 0.55). Reward size also modulated error signals (Figure 2D; t(139) = −1.98, p < 0.05, paired-samples t test on high- versus low-value scenes, outcome period). This effect, too, was subtle, just 0.28 sp/s on average. The amount of juice received on correct trials did not affect firing rates (p > 0.9). Furthermore, the (missed) reward effect was limited to new (novel + addition) scenes (t(137) = 2.58, p = 0.01). Reference scenes showed no such modulation (t(77) = 0.57, p = 0.57). There was no effect of reward size on firing rates during scene presentation (t(139) = −0.74, p = 0.46). Because of the small size of these effects, we performed additional single-cell analyses. Without regard to significance, 83/140 cells had higher firing rates following incorrect low-value trials than incorrect high-value trials (outcome period). This bias is significant (binomial test, p = 0.034). Moreover, of the 19 cells (13.5% of 140) with significant modulation, 16 had higher firing rates following incorrect low-value than incorrect high-value trials. This proportion is also significantly biased (binomial test, p = 0.004). Without regard to significance, 83/140 cells had higher firing rates following incorrect new (novel + addition) trials than following incorrect reference trials. This is also a significant bias (binomial test, p = 0.034). Only 11 cells had significant novelty modulation (7.9%), and this population had no bias in either direction (p > 0.9). On the whole, CGp neurons thus appear to signal that the current level of task engagement is insufficient to perform optimally, due to scene novelty, low reward rates, and failures to execute the appropriate action. Prior work shows that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) drives rapid trial-to-trial adjustments in behavior (Hayden et al., 2009aHayden B.Y. Pearson J.M. Platt M.L. Fictive reward signals in the anterior cingulate cortex.Science. 2009; 324: 948-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, Hayden et al., 2011Hayden B.Y. Heilbronner S.R. Pearson J.M. Platt M.L. Surprise signals in anterior cingulate cortex: neuronal encoding of unsigned reward prediction errors driving adjustment in behavior.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 4178-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). By contrast, we hypothesize (Pearson et al., 2011Pearson J.M. Heilbronner S.R. Barack D.L. Hayden B.Y. Platt M.L. Posterior cingulate cortex: adapting behavior to a changing world.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2011; 15: 143-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) that CGp, as part of the DMN, modulates learning on a slower time scale, predicting performance across tens of trials. We therefore asked whether firing rates at the start of the session were predictive of final performance. Indeed, CGp activity strongly predicted future performance. We computed a normalized measure of neuronal activity by dividing outcome period firing rates by a cell’s baseline value, defined as mean firing rate activity during a 500 ms presaccade epoch on all completed trials. This was done to allow us to compare activity across a heterogeneous population of cells. Note that this is not equivalent to Z score normalization. Higher firing rates at the start of the session (first ten trials) predicted poorer future performance (last ten trials, correlation between starting firing rates during the outcome period and end performance, r = −0.14, p < 0.0001). To ensure that this effect was not due to the difference in firing rate on correct versus error trials, we separately examined the first ten error and first ten correct trials. In these cases, early high firing rates also predicted reduced future performance (correct: r = −0.10, p = 0.0002; error: r = −0.09, p = 0.007). To determine whether these results could be explained by the subtle value and novelty effects, we performed a multiple regression analysis with starting firing rate, novelty level, and scene value for each scene analyzed as a function of end performance. Our findings remained unchanged (all trials: beta = −0.02, p = 0.0006; error trials: beta = −0.02, p = 0.008; correct trials: beta = −0.02, p = 0.002). Reference scene performance was not associated with variations in early-session firing rate (p > 0.16 in all 3 cases), presumably because learning was not necessary for this scene type, and thus they were fairly easy. Because these results are correlative, they leave open two conflicting possibilities: (1) DMN signals cause poor performance and (2) they marshal resources to mitigate poor performance. To adjudicate between these two hypotheses, we injected the GABAA agonist muscimol into CGp. As a control, on different days, we injected vehicle (saline). We predicted deleterious effects of muscimol on learning of new scenes but not on performance on familiar reference scenes. For reference scenes, a three-way ANOVA with treatment (muscimol/saline), reward size (low-/high-value scene), and target location as factors for performance on each scene revealed a main effect of motivational state on performance (high-value scenes > low-value scenes, F(1, 56) = 36.41, p < 0.000001), but no other significant main effects or interactions (Figure 3). Thus, for reference scenes, CGp inactivation had no effect. For new scenes, we restricted our analysis to the first set (novel scenes), as addition scenes were too rare to analyze. There was a main effect of scene value (F(1, 56) = 8.56, p = 0.005) and a significant interaction between treatment and scene value (F(1, 56) = 4.25, p = 0.04). Post hoc tests revealed an effect of muscimol on performance on low-value scenes (paired-samples t test, t(15) = 3.56, p = 0.003), but not on high-value scenes (t(15) = 0.5, p = 0.6). Each monkey performed poorly on novel, low-reward scenes during muscimol sessions. Monkey L’s data were significant alone, t(9) = −2.51, p = 0.03 (5 session pairs, 16.5% difference in performance). Monkey B’s data trended toward significance, t(5) = −2.39, p = 0.062 (3 session pairs, 21.6% difference in performance) (Figure 3C). We also examined three measures of motivation: time to fixation, reaction time, and fixation breaks. Muscimol did not affect times to fixation or reaction times (Supplemental Information available online). For fixation breaks, we excluded trials in which breaks occurred prior to scene onset. For reference scenes, fixation break frequencies were higher during muscimol sessions (F(1, 56) = 4.43, p < 0.04.) These effects were mainly driven by low-value scenes (t(15) = −3.14, p = 0.007); effects on high-value scenes were not significant (p = 0.26). Although novel scenes were not significant (p = 0.12), the other muscimol results led us to examine, post hoc, the effects on low-value, novel scenes exclusively. These trended toward more fixation breaks (p = 0.06). These results suggest that DMN activity is particularly important when conditions are more challenging—learning novel scenes for small rewards. If CGp activity merely antagonizes task performance, CGp inactivation should have improved learning; instead, we found the opposite. CGp activity is associated with reduced performance in a variety of laboratory tasks. One possibility is that this activity reflects cognitive processes that compete with task competence (Gusnard et al., 2001Gusnard D.A. Akbudak E. Shulman G.L. Raichle M.E. Medial prefrontal cortex and self-referential mental activity: relation to a default mode of brain function.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 4259-4264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2333) Google Scholar, Sonuga-Barke and Castellanos, 2007Sonuga-Barke E.J. Castellanos F.X.

Neurosci. 2006; 9: 971-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it may reflect control processes that compensate for conditions that reduce performance. We tested these ideas by recording and altering neuronal activity in CGp during an associative learning and memory task. We report three main findings. First, CGp neurons carry a prominent error signal; second, the size of this signal is correlated with poor performance on a learning task; and third, inactivation of CGp retards performance in low-stakes conditions. These results are consistent with the idea that CGp detects conditions leading to poor performance and acts to ameliorate suboptimal behavior but are not concordant with the alternative “antagonistic” hypothesis. To our knowledge, this is the first study to reversibly inactivate primate CGp (which has no rodent homolog), although our results are broadly consistent with those from studies of permanent lesions in medial prefrontal DMN regions, which show cognitive control and decision-making deficits (e.g., Gläscher et al., 2012Gläscher J. Adolphs R. Damasio H. Bechara A. Rudrauf D. Calamia M. Paul L.K. Tranel D. Lesion mapping of cognitive control and value-based decision making in the prefrontal cortex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 14681-14686Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). DMN activity is negatively correlated with task performance (Eichele et al., 2008Eichele T. Debener S. Calhoun V.D. Specht K. Engel A.K. Hugdahl K. von Cramon D.Y. Ullsperger M. Prediction of human errors by maladaptive changes in event-related brain networks.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 6173-6178Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, Hayden et al., 2009bHayden B.Y. Smith D.V. Platt M.L. Electrophysiological correlates of default-mode processing in macaque posterior cingulate cortex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 5948-5953Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Error signals were not prepotent in our experiment, meaning firing rates were not higher on error trials prior to feedback. Thus, we infer that CGp activity does not directly lead to moment-to-moment failures of attention or other lapses that may cause errors. Instead, CGp is responsive to task difficulty and priorities—in this case, inherent scene difficulty, novelty, and value. For certain tasks, this will likely correlate with single-trial performance, and error modulation will be prepotent (Hayden et al., 2009bHayden B.Y. Smith D.V. Platt M.L. Electrophysiological correlates of default-mode processing in macaque posterior cingulate cortex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 5948-5953Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). For the present task, however, variations in performance may be more closely linked with inherent difficulty than with attention per se. Our data present an apparent contradiction: high firing rates early in learning predict poor future performance, but suppressing firing rates with muscimol also impairs performance. One hypothesis is that firing rates increase early for scenes with poor learning because factors associated with poor performance—low reward rates, scene difficulty, lack of focus—are detected and subsequently, but only partially, remedied by CGp. By way of analogy, firemen are often found near a fire, but it would be a mistake to conclude that they cause the fire. On the contrary, preventing the firemen from showing up (muscimol in this analogy) would only make the fire worse. Together, our results thus suggest that higher CGp activity does not cause poor task performance but instead detects and possibly endeavors to improve it. These data indicate that, when rewards are small, the normal processes that motivate performance are insufficient, and control areas are recruited to learn the new scene. Inactivating CGp impairs this process, effectively blocking new learning in the low-reward condition. This idea is somewhat different from more conventional theories of motivation and control, such as those associated with ACC and vmPFC. Interestingly, portions of these medial prefrontal areas are also part of the DMN (Buckner et al., 2008Buckner R.L. Andrews-Hanna J.R. Schacter D.L. The brain’s default network: anatomy, function, and relevance to disease.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2008; 1124: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (6976) Google Scholar), and CGp is anatomically and functionally connected to both of them (Vogt and Pandya, 1987Vogt B.A. Pandya D.N.

Menon V. Functional connectivity in the resting brain: a network analysis of the default mode hypothesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (4879) Google Scholar). Like CGp, ACC also increases its firing following errors (Niki and Watanabe, 1979Niki H. Watanabe M. Prefrontal and cingulate unit activity during timing behavior in the monkey.Brain Res. 1979; 171: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). ACC and vmPFC are associated with executive control and decisions but tend to have antagonistic relationships (Kolling et al., 2012Kolling N. Behrens T.E. Mars R.B. Rushworth M.F.

While these different components of the DMN have distinct functions, we suggest that none of them acts in opposition to task performance. While the present results are limited to learning contexts"

CE is responsible for conversion of β1,4-mannobiose to 4-O-β-d-mannosyl-d-glucose in mannan metabolism. However, the detailed catalytic mechanism of CE is unclear due to the lack of structural data in complex with ligands. We determined the crystal structures of halothermophile Rhodothermus marinus CE (RmCE) in complex with substrates/products or intermediate analogs, and its apo form. The structures in complex with the substrates/products indicated that the residues in the β5-β6 loop as well as those in the inner six helices form the catalytic site. Trp-322 and Trp-385 interact with reducing and non-reducing end parts of these ligands, respectively, by stacking interactions. The architecture of the catalytic site also provided insights into the mechanism of reversible epimerization. His-259 abstracts the H2 proton of the d-mannose residue at the reducing end, and consistently forms the cis-enediol intermediate by facilitated depolarization of the 2-OH group mediated by hydrogen bonding interaction with His-200. His-390 subsequently donates the proton to the C2 atom of the intermediate to form a d-glucose residue. The reverse reaction is mediated by these three histidines with the inverse roles of acid/base catalysts. The conformation of cellobiitol demonstrated that the deprotonation/reprotonation step is coupled with rotation of the C2-C3 bond of the open form of the ligand. Moreover, it is postulated that His-390 is closely related to ring opening/closure by transferring a proton between the O5 and O1 atoms of the ligand."
https://openalex.org/W2093803358,"Rac1-GTPases serve as intermediary cellular switches, which conduct transient and constitutive signals from upstream cues, including those from Ras oncoproteins. Although the sirtuin1 (SIRT1) deacetylase is overexpressed in several human cancers and has recently been linked to cancer cell motility as a context-dependent regulator of multiple pathways, its role in Rac1 activation has not been reported. Similarly, SIRT2 has been demonstrated to be upregulated in some cancers; however, studies have also reported its role in tumor suppression. Here, we demonstrate that SIRT1 and SIRT2 positively regulate the levels of Rac1-GTP and the activity of T-cell lymphoma invasion and metastasis 1 (TIAM1), a Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). Transient inhibition of SIRT1 and SIRT2 resulted in increased acetylation of TIAM1, whereas chronic SIRT2 knockdown resulted in enhanced acetylation of TIAM1. SIRT1 regulates Dishevelled (DVL) protein levels in cancer cells, and DVL along with TIAM1 are known to augment Rac activation; however, SIRT1 or 2 has not been previously linked with TIAM1. We found that diminished sirtuin activity led to the disruption of the DVL1-TIAM1 interaction. We hence propose a model for Rac activation where SIRT1/2 positively modulates the DVL/TIAM1/Rac axis and promotes sustained pathway activation."

However, the mechanism of HPK1 loss has not been defined. The aims of this study are to identify the ubiquitin ligase and to examine the mechanisms that targets HPK1 degradation. We found that the CUL7/Fbxw8 ubiquitin ligase targeted HPK1 for degradation via the 26 S proteasome. The ubiquitination of HPK1 required its kinase activity and autophosphorylation. Wild-type protein phosphatase 4 (PP4), but not the phosphatase-dead PP4 mutant, PP4-RL, inhibits the interaction of Fbxw8 with HPK1 and Fbxw8-mediated ubiquitination of HPK1.

Our previous study showed that HPK1 protein is expressed in normal pancreatic ducts but is lost in >95% of pancreatic cancer, which is one of the most lethal cancers; less than 5% of patients remain alive 5 years after diagnosis. The loss of HPK1 is strongly associated with the progression from low-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) to invasive pancreatic cancer. More important, restoring HPK1 expression in pancreatic cancer cells causes cell cycle arrest and growth inhibition, which is due in part to the stabilization of p21 and p27 (20.Wang H. Song X.

HPK1 has been shown to be positively regulated by protein phosphatase 4 (PP4), a serine/threonine phosphatase, which dephosphorylates HPK1 and inhibits HPK1 ubiquitination and degradation (22.Zhou G. Boomer J.S. Tan T.H. Protein phosphatase 4 is a positive regulator of hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49551-49561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Interestingly, our previous study showed that both endogenous HPK1 and exogenously overexpressed HPK1 protein are degraded in pancreatic cancer cells, which can be fully restored by treatment with proteasome inhibitors (20.Wang H. Song X. Logsdon C. Zhou G. Evans D.B. Abbruzzese J.L. Hamilton S.R. Tan T.H. Proteasome-mediated degradation and functions of hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 in pancreatic cancer.Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 1063-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), suggesting that loss of HPK1 in pancreatic cancer is caused by proteasome-mediated protein degradation. However, the ubiquitin ligase and the molecular mechanisms that targets HPK1 for degradation in pancreatic cancer is unknown. Given the novel tumor suppressor function of HPK1 in pancreatic cancer, it is important to identify the ubiquitin ligase and to examine the mechanisms by which HPK1 expression is regulated. The protein ubiquitination is catalyzed by three enzymes, including a ubiquitin (Ub)-activating enzyme (E1), a Ub-conjugating enzyme (E2), and a Ub ligase (E3) (23.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. The ubiquitin system.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6879) Google Scholar). The specificity of this pathway is mainly determined by Ub ligases, which not only interact with the substrates, but also recruit the activated E2 enzymes. The concerted actions between the E3-bound substrate, the Ub ligase, and the Ub-charged E2 produce polyubiquitin chains on targeted proteins, which are then delivered to the 26 S proteasome for degradation (24.Deshaies R.J. SCF and Cullin/Ring H2-based ubiquitin ligases.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Of a few hundreds of Ub ligases, the cullin-RING Ub ligases (CRLs) are grouped as the largest subfamily and are conserved throughout eukaryotes. In these Ub ligases, cullins serve as molecular scaffolds that organize the reactive module to coordinate substrate ubiquitination. Human cells express seven different cullins (CUL1, -2, -3, -4A, -4B, -5, and -7) and each of them can form Ub ligase complexes with other proteins (25.Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Function and regulation of cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). The best characterized CRL is the Skp1-CUL1-F-box protein (SCF) complex (26.Jin J. Cardozo T. Lovering R.C. Elledge S.J. Pagano M. Harper J.W. Systematic analysis and nomenclature of mammalian F-box proteins.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2573-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar), which comprises three invariable components: CUL1, Rbx1, and Skp1 as well as one variable component, known as an F-box protein that binds Skp1 through its F-box motif and determines the substrate specificity (23.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. The ubiquitin system.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6879) Google Scholar, 24.Deshaies R.J. SCF and Cullin/Ring H2-based ubiquitin ligases.Annu. Rev.

The SCF ubiquitin ligase: insights into a molecular machine.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 739-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). Skp1 can also form an E3 complex with CUL7, Rbx1, and F-box and WD repeat domain containing 8 (Fbxw8), which is the only known F-box protein in CUL7 E3 complex (28.Xu X. Sarikas A. Dias-Santagata D.C. Dolios G. Lafontant P.J. Tsai S.C. Zhu W. Nakajima H. Nakajima H.O. Field L.J. Wang R. Pan Z.Q.

In this study, we identified CUL7/Fbxw8 complex as the Ub ligase that is responsible for proteasome-mediated HPK1 degradation. Our data revealed novel pathways of HPK1 regulation, a direct link and novel role of CUL7 ubiquitin ligase in the MAPK pathway. Flag-HPK1, Flag-HGK, Flag-HPK1-M46, Flag-PP4, and HA-PP4-RL were previously described (22.Zhou G. Boomer J.S. Tan T.H.

Flag-Fbxw7, His-Ub, His-Ub-K48R, and His-Ub-K63R plasmids were from Dr. Mong-Hong Lee and Dr. Hui-Kuan Lin at our institution. Site-directed mutagenesis of HPK1 was performed using a QuickChange kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instruction. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cell lines, HEK293T, Jurkat T cells, Panc-1 and Panc-28 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 100 units/ml streptomycin/penicillin. Cells were transfected with various amounts of plasmids encoding PP4, PP4-RL, Fbxw8, HPK1, and its mutants, or Ub as indicated in figure legends. Whole cell lysates were prepared from Panc-1/Flag-HPK1 stable cells treated with 2.0 μm MG132 for 16 h, which stabilized HPK1 protein. The antibody array filter containing 400 different antibodies (HM3000, Hypromatrix, Worcester, MA) was pre-blocked in a buffer containing 5% nonfat milk and then incubated with above-mentioned whole cell lysate. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, the array filter was washed three times with TBST for 15 min and then incubated with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-Flag antibody in TBST for 2 h at room temperature. The antibody-antigen-HPK1 complex was detected by peroxidase substrate, followed by chemiluminescence. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as previously described (20.Wang H. Song X. Logsdon C. Zhou G. Evans D.B. Abbruzzese J.L. Hamilton S.R. Tan T.H. Proteasome-mediated degradation and functions of hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 in pancreatic cancer.Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 1063-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Protein expression was analyzed by 8% or 10% SDS-PAGE, which was electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Novex), blocked in 5% skim milk in 1× TBS, and probed with the primary antibodies indicated in the figure legends. Proteins were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). Following antibodies were used: anti-HA (Upstate Biotechnology); anti-β-actin and anti-Flag (Sigma-Aldrich); Anti-HPK1 (N-19), anti-PP4, anti-c-Myc (9E10), anti-Skp1, anti-CUL1 and anti-CUL7 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), and anti-Fbxw8 (Abgent, Inc.). The half-life of HPK1 protein was measured in 293T cells cotransfected with HPK1 and Fbxw8 constructs compared with those transfected with HPK1 alone. The cells transfected with HPK1 alone or co-transfected with HPK1 and Fbxw8 cDNA constructs were treated with 100 μg of cycloheximide (CHX) for 0, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, and 6 h. The HPK1 protein levels were measured by Western blots. Immunocomplex kinase assays using myelin basic protein (MBP) as a substrate were performed as previously described (20.Wang H. Song X. Logsdon C. Zhou G. Evans D.B. Abbruzzese J.L. Hamilton S.R. Tan T.H. Proteasome-mediated degradation and functions of hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 in pancreatic cancer.Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 1063-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In vivo ubiquitination assays were performed as described elsewhere (30.Yang W.L. Wang J. Chan C.H. Lee S.W. Campos A.D. Lamothe B. Hur L. Grabiner B.C. Lin X. Darnay B.G. Lin H.K. The E3 ligase TRAF6 regulates Akt ubiquitination and activation.Science. 2009; 325: 1134-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Flag-HPK1 and Myc-Fbxw8 were cotransfected with His.Myc-Ub, His.Myc-Ub K48R, or His.Myc-Ub K63R into 293T cells. The cells were treated with 2 μm MG132 for 6 h before harvesting, and lysed in PBS containing 1% nonidet P-40 and 10 mm imidazole. The nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose beads (Ni-NTA, Qiagen Inc.) were then added to the cell extracts and rotated at room temperature for 4 h to pull down the ubiquitinated HPK1 protein. Precipitates were washed three times with PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 20 mm imidazole and then boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The protein complexes were separated on 8% SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-HPK1 antibody. The levels of total polyubiquitinated proteins were comparable across the experimental conditions. Panc-1 or Panc-28 parental, ShRNA control and Fbxw8 knockdown stable cells were plated at an equal density in triplicates and cultured under normal conditions for 6 days. The cells were harvested daily by trypsinization and washed once with cold PBS. The cell numbers were counted and plotted. The experiments to establish the growth curves were repeated three times. To identify HPK1-interacting proteins in pancreatic cancer cells, we performed an antibody-based array screening using the lysates from Panc-1/HPK1 stable clone (C1) treated with MG132, which stabilized HPK1 protein. We found that HPK1 interacted with Skp1 and Rbx1/Rbx2, but not CUL1 (Fig. 1A). To confirm these results, we performed co-immunoprecipitation using the lysates from Panc-1/HPK1 stable clone (C1) treated with MG132. HPK1 antibody could co-precipitate Skp1. No Skp1 was detected in IgG control or Panc-1 parental cells, which had no detectable HPK1 expression. Similar to the results from antibody array, no interaction between HPK1 and CUL1 was detected by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1B). Since Skp1 can also form an E3 complex with CUL7, we examined the interaction between HPK1 and CUL7 in Panc-1/HPK1 stable cells. CUL7 was specifically co-immunoprecipitated with HPK1 (Fig. 1B). These data suggested that Skp1-CUL7- Rbx1 E3 complex is responsible for proteasome-mediated HPK1 degradation in pancreatic cancer cells. Since Fbxw8 is the only known F-box protein in Skp1-CUL7 E3 complex, we examined the interaction between HPK1 and Fbxw8 and found that endogenous Fbxw8 was specifically co-immunoprecipitated with HPK1 in Panc-1/HPK1 stable cells (Fig. 1B). To further confirm their interactions, Myc-Fbxw8 and Flag-HPK1 were cotransfected into 293T cells and co-immunoprecipitation was performed using either anti-Myc or anti-Flag antibody. HPK1 antibody could co-precipitate Fbxw8 protein and Myc antibody could co-precipitate HPK1 protein (Fig. 1C). In addition, endogenous HPK1 also interacted with Fbxw8 in Jurkat T cells (Fig. 1D). To test whether Fbxw8 promoted HPK1 degradation, both overexpression and knockdown systems of Fbxw8 were used. We found that HPK1 protein levels were inversely correlated with the expression levels of Fbxw8 (Fig. 1, E and F). However, Fbxw8 had little effect on the steady-state level of kinase-dead HPK1-M46 (Fig. 1G), suggesting that Fbxw8-mediated HPK1 degradation requires HPK1 kinase activity. Also we did not observe any effect of Fbxw8 on the expression of HGK, another serine/threonine kinase in STE20/MAP4K family (Fig. 1H), which has been shown to be overexpressed in pancreatic cancer (31.Liang J.J. Wang H. Rashid A. Tan T.H. Hwang R.F. Hamilton S.R. Abbruzzese J.L. Evans D.B. Wang H. Expression of MAP4K4 is associated with worse prognosis in patients with stage II pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.Clin. Cancer Res. 2008; 14: 7043-7049Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). When the half-life of HPK1 protein in 293T cells cotransfected with Fbxw8 was compared with that transfected with HPK1 alone, Fbxw8 accelerated the decay rate of HPK1 protein (Fig. 1I). When Fbxw8 was cotransfected with HPK1 and HA-ubiquitin into 293T cells, Fbxw8 markedly increased HPK1 ubiquitination. In contrast, cotransfection of Fbxw7 did not increase HPK1 ubiquitination (Fig. 2A). Fbxw7 is the F-box component of a SCF ubiquitin ligase and acts as a tumor suppressor in many human cancers (32.Mansour M.R. Sanda T. Lawton L.N. Li X. Kreslavsky T. Novina C.D. Brand M. Gutierrez A. Kelliher M.A. Jamieson C.H. von Boehmer H. Young R.A. Look A.T. The TAL1 complex targets the FBXW7 tumor suppressor by activating miR-223 in human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.J. Exp. Med. 2013; 210: 1545-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Since ubiquitination through ubiquitin Lys48 (K48) generally targets proteins for degradation, whereas ubiquitination through K63 plays a critical role in signaling activation and protein trafficking (30.Yang W.L. Wang J. Chan C.H. Lee S.W. Campos A.D. Lamothe B. Hur L. Grabiner B.C. Lin X. Darnay B.G. Lin H.K. The E3 ligase TRAF6 regulates Akt ubiquitination and activation.Science. 2009; 325: 1134-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), we tested whether HPK1 is ubiquitinated through K48 or K63. Fbxw8-mediated HPK1 ubiquitination was abolished in cells cotransfected with His-Ub K48R. Fbxw8-mediated HPK1 ubiquitination was also reduced in cells cotransfected with His-Ub K63R compared with those cotransfected with His-Ub (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that Fbxw8-mediated HPK1 ubiquitination occurred mainly through K48 but to a lesser extent through K63 of ubiquitin. Since kinase-dead HPK1-M46 was more stable than wild type HPK1 when cotransfected with Fbxw8, it is possible that HPK1 ubiquitination requires its kinase activity and autophosphorylation. Two serine (Ser-159 and Ser-171) and two threonine residues (Thr-165 and Thr-175) reside in the putative activation loop of HPK1. It has been shown that full activation of HPK1 is dependent on the autophosphorylation of Thr-165 and phosphorylation of Ser-171 (10.Arnold R. Patzak I.M. Neuhaus B. Vancauwenbergh S. Veillette A. Van Lint J. Kiefer F. Activation of hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 involves relocation, autophosphorylation, and transphosphorylation by protein kinase D1.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2364-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We investigated whether phosphorylation of these residues plays a role in Fbxw8-mediated HPK1 degradation by mutating them to alanine. Similar to HPK1-M46, S171A, or T175A mutation abolished HPK1 kinase activity. HPK1-T165A had decreased HPK1 kinase activity, whereas HPK1-S159A had similar kinase activity to wild-type HPK1 (Fig. 3A), suggesting that HPK1 kinase activity requires phosphorylation of Thr-165, Ser-171, and Thr-175, but not Ser-159. When Fbxw8 were cotransfected with HPK1 mutants into 293T cells, Fbxw8 resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in HPK1-S159A expression similar to wild-type"

The single dendritic branch as a fundamental functional unit in the nervous system.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2010; 20: 494-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) have established that signal propagation through dendrites is subject to distance-dependent filtering and attenuation, potentially reducing the influence of distal synapses on somatic voltage. Importantly, however, mechanisms to counteract this situation have been proposed and substantiated, such as increasing synaptic strength with distance from the soma to offset distance-dependent voltage attenuation (Magee and Cook, 2000Magee J.C.

Neither dendrites nor synapses are uniform, however. For example, the diameter of dendrites near their terminal ends tapers, resulting in distance-dependent increases in local input impedance. Moreover, dendrites are “sealed” at their terminal ends, resulting in even higher input impedance and, consequently, large local synaptic potentials (Rall and Rinzel, 1973Rall W. Rinzel J.

Transient response in a dendritic neuron model for current injected at one branch.Biophys. J. 1974; 14: 759-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Synapses on dendritic spines are also diverse (Bourne and Harris, 2008Bourne J.N. Harris K.M. Balancing structure and function at hippocampal dendritic spines.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 31: 47-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, Nicholson and Geinisman, 2009Nicholson D.A. Geinisman Y.

Neurol. 2009; 512: 399-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), being comprised of two major synaptic subtypes—perforated and nonperforated—that differ in size, number, and ligand-gated receptor expression. Therefore, mechanisms that offset dendritic filtering in some dendritic segments may not be effective in other parts of the dendrites and, further, the role of perforated and nonperforated synapses in such mechanisms may differ. In agreement with such diversity among dendrites and synapses, studies of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons have shown that their apical dendrites implement multiple compensatory mechanisms that, together, counteract the influence of dendritic cable properties on distal synaptic signals. First, along the somatodendritic axis, the expression of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) increases, on average, with distance from the soma, largely due to an increased number of strong synapses at distal locations (Magee and Cook, 2000Magee J.C.

Neurol. 2009; 512: 399-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This local increase in average synapse strength reduces the location dependence of unitary somatic excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) (Magee and Cook, 2000Magee J.C. Cook E.P.

Second, along individual oblique dendrites, which radiate from the main apical dendrite, synapse number decreases. This within-dendrite numerical scaling normalizes the contribution of individual synapses to dendritic spike generation, reducing the location dependence of dendritic spike-triggering synapses (Katz et al., 2009Katz Y. Menon V. Nicholson D.A. Geinisman Y. Kath W.L. Spruston N. Synapse distribution suggests a two-stage model of dendritic integration in CA1 pyramidal neurons.Neuron. 2009; 63: 171-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Together, these studies show that synaptic strength increases along the somatodendritic axis but that synapse number decreases along individual apical dendritic branches, thereby balancing the competing objectives of minimizing EPSP attenuation and maximizing the number of synapses that contribute to dendritic spikes and axonal action potentials. Much less is known about such compensatory mechanisms in the basal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Morphologically, the basal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons are different from the apical dendrites, despite sharing common afferents (i.e., inputs from CA3). Basal dendrites in stratum oriens (SO) are shorter and are distributed in a radially uniform manner, lacking the distinction among the trunk, oblique branches, and the tuft present in the apical tree. In addition, several main parent basal dendrites connect directly to the soma, whereas the apical dendritic arbor connects to the soma via a single main apical dendrite (Amaral and Lavenex, 2006Amaral D.G. Lavenex P. Hippocampal neuroanatomy.in: Andersen P. Morris R. Amaral D. Bliss T. O’Keefe J. The Hippocampus Book. Oxford University Press, Oxford2006: 37-114Google Scholar). Despite these differences in dendrite structure, synaptic signals in both basal and apical oblique dendrites are subjected to similar dendritic cable properties. First, because synapses on apical and basal dendrites are distributed throughout relatively long dendrites, EPSPs from the most distal synapses in both regions undergo the most distance-dependent filtering as they propagate toward the soma. Second, both apical and basal dendrites have a branch point on one end and a tapering “sealed” end on the other, creating a low-input impedance at the former and a high-input impedance at the latter. One prediction from such similarities is that synapses on both basal and apical oblique dendrites could utilize similar mechanisms to compensate for the consonant effects of dendritic filtering on their local and somatic EPSPs. To address this issue, we first determined whether any of the mechanisms identified as influencing synaptic integration in apical dendrites are present in basal dendrites. Next, we analyzed synaptic receptor expression on the axospinous synapses of both basal and apical oblique dendrites, segregated on the basis of their parent dendrites’ diameters, with the presumption that synapses on the thinnest dendrites are closest to the dendrites’ terminal ends. Finally, we performed simulations using computational models to analyze the impact of the observed gradients of synapse number and receptor expression for events both above and below the threshold for triggering local dendritic spikes. Our analyses suggest that synapses in both regions use the same combination of mechanisms to regulate their contribution to somatic and dendritic depolarization, as well as Ca2+ influx through NMDARs. Moreover, the present study provides strong evidence that single-dendrite gradients in synapse number and receptor expression confer to individual hippocampal dendrites the dual capabilities of integrating activity locally in the dendrite and participating in global integration at the soma with remarkable location independence. Like apical oblique dendrites (Golding and Spruston, 1998Golding N.L. Spruston N.

To determine whether basal dendrites show evidence for single-dendrite scaling of synapse number, which was shown in apical oblique dendrites to maximize dendritic impact on somatic voltage and normalize the location of dendritic spike-triggering synapses (Katz et al., 2009Katz Y. Menon V. Nicholson D.A. Geinisman Y. Kath W.L. Spruston N. Synapse distribution suggests a two-stage model of dendritic integration in CA1 pyramidal neurons.Neuron. 2009; 63: 171-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), we reconstructed individual basal dendrites from CA1 pyramidal neurons using serial section electron microscopy (see also Figure S1 available online). Three-dimensional reconstructions of biotinylated dextran-amine-labeled dendritic segments from serial electron micrograph mosaics allowed us to measure the density and volume of spines and to determine the size of many of their postsynaptic densities (PSDs; Figures 1A–1M). As is also apparent from the three-dimensional array tomographic renderings (Figure S1), dendritic diameter in the electron microscopic reconstructions tapers as individual dendrites course to their terminal ends, regardless of whether they are basals or apical obliques (Figure 1G; basal: F(1,5) = 24.8, p < 0.01; apical oblique: F(1,4) = 27.8, p < 0.01). Additionally, as found in apical oblique dendrites, spine density is ∼33% lower in distal basal dendritic segments within SO, as compared to proximal segments (Figure 1J; t(5) = 3.30, p < 0.05). To assess whether synapse size also decreases along the length of an individual dendrite as seen in apical oblique dendrites, we measured 266 PSDs from proximal and distal branch segments. As might be predicted from the correlation between spine volume and PSD area (r = 0.75, p < 0.001; Figure 1K), both are significantly smaller (by 18% and 28%, respectively) in the distal basal dendrites (spine volumes: mean ± SEM proximal = 0.029 ± 0.002 μm3; distal = 0.024 ± 0.001 μm3; p < 0.05; PSD areas: proximal = 0.046 ± 0.002 μm2; distal = 0.033 ± 0.001 μm2; p < 0.0001; Figures 1L and 1M). Taken together, reconstructions of individual dendrites show that spines on both basal and apical oblique dendrites are progressively sparser toward each dendrite’s terminal end. These single-dendrite gradients are very similar for the basal dendrites in the SO and the apical dendrites in the stratum radiatum (SR), suggesting that any compensatory function of such distance-dependent regulation is similar in both regions (e.g., Katz et al., 2009Katz Y. Menon V. Nicholson D.A. Geinisman Y. Kath W.L. Spruston N. Synapse distribution suggests a two-stage model of dendritic integration in CA1 pyramidal neurons.Neuron. 2009; 63: 171-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We next used unbiased quantitative serial section electron microscopy to determine whether basal dendritic synapses show scaling along the somatodendritic axis resembling that described for apical dendrites (Nicholson et al., 2006Nicholson D.A. Trana R.E. Katz Y. Kath W.L. Spruston N. Geinisman Y. Distance-dependent differences in synapse number and AMPA receptor expression in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.Neuron. 2006; 50: 431-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The two major axospinous synaptic subtypes in the hippocampus are distinguished by the configuration of their PSDs into perforated and nonperforated synapses (Bourne and Harris, 2008Bourne J.N. Harris K.M. Balancing structure and function at hippocampal dendritic spines.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 31: 47-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, Nicholson and Geinisman, 2009Nicholson D.A. Geinisman Y. Axospinous synaptic subtype-specific differences in structure, size, ionotropic receptor expression, and connectivity in apical dendritic regions of rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.J. Comp. Neurol. 2009; 512: 399-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Perforated synapses have significantly higher expression levels of AMPARs and NMDARs compared to their nonperforated counterparts (Nicholson and Geinisman, 2009Nicholson D.A. Geinisman Y. Axospinous synaptic subtype-specific differences in structure, size, ionotropic receptor expression, and connectivity in apical dendritic regions of rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.J. Comp. Neurol. 2009; 512: 399-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), which implies that they generate significantly larger synaptic currents than the latter. Thus, the number of perforated and nonperforated synapses in different regions of the dendritic arbor can be used to infer information about the role, or relative importance, of basal dendritic synapses at different distances from the soma. To determine whether their numbers change with distance from the soma as seen in the apical dendrites, we used unbiased quantitative electron microscopy to determine the total number of perforated and nonperforated synapses in proximal, middle, and distal stratum oriens in the CA1 region of hippocampus (pSO, mSO, and dSO, respectively). Because of the radial distribution of basal dendrites, a small proportion of middle and distal branch segments are interspersed with proximal segments in pSO and, similarly, a few proximal and distal segments are present in mSO (Figures 2A and 2B ). To correct for this, we divided the neuropil lying between the pyramidal cell layer and the alveus into thirds (Figure 2B). This approach allowed us to determine the contribution of proximal, middle, and distal branch segments to each region in a set of seven reconstructed neurons (Figure 2B; see also Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Axospinous synapses were categorized as perforated when their PSD profile in serial sections displayed at least one discontinuity (Figure 2C) or nonperforated, which by definition have PSDs that lack such discontinuities (Figure 2D). We found that there are no differences in the total number of perforated synapses in the basal dendrites as a function of distance from the soma (Figures 2E and 2F), but the number of nonperforated synapses, the most numerous axospinous synaptic subtype, is significantly lower in distal basal dendrites (dSO) as compared to proximal ones (Figures 2E and 2F; F(2,20) = 9.95, p > 0.01). Such a distance-dependent shift among the synaptic subtypes is consistent with the single-dendrite analyses, which indicate that distal segments have a lower overall density of synapses/spines (Figure 1), and identifies the selective downregulation of nonperforated synapses as the substrate for lower synapse numbers in distal branches. We next compared the expression of ligand-gated ion channels at synapses in pSO, mSO, and dSO by localizing and quantifying postsynaptic AMPAR and NMDAR expression with serial section, postembedding immunogold electron microscopy. The number of immunogold particles projected onto the PSD of each synapse in serial sections was used to estimate synaptic receptor expression in terms of particle number and density (Figures 3A–3D). As in the apical dendrites (Nicholson and Geinisman, 2009Nicholson D.A. Geinisman Y. Axospinous synaptic subtype-specific differences in structure, size, ionotropic receptor expression, and connectivity in apical dendritic regions of rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.J. Comp. Neurol. 2009; 512: 399-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we found that for both AMPARs and NMDARs in SO, immunogold particle number (per synapse) is greater for perforated synapses than for nonperforated synapses (Figures 3E and 3F; multivariate analysis of covariance, AMPAR, F(2,2422) = 21.12, p < 0.0001; NMDAR F(2,1335) = 10.13, p < 0.0001). Additionally, and also consistent with apical dendrites, receptor expression levels for nonperforated synapses throughout all of SO are similar (Figures 3E and 3F), whereas perforated synapses show distance-dependent differences (Figures 3E and 3F). Interestingly though, AMPARs and NMDARs in perforated synapses are regulated in opposite directions: AMPAR expression increases with distance from the soma in SO (Figure 3E), whereas NMDAR expression decreases (Figure 3F). The only distance-dependent change among nonperforated synapses is that distal nonperforated PSDs are ∼10% smaller on average than proximal ones (Figure 3G; nonperforated: F(2,3483) = 14.58, p < 0.0001; mean ± SEM: proximal = 0.031 ± 0.001 μm2; distal = 0.028 ± 0.001 μm2; perforated: F(2,282) = 2.02, p > 0.05; proximal = 0.050 ± 0.001 μm2; distal = 0.049 ± 0.001 μm2). Plotting the distributions of the number of particles per synapse supports these observations because nonperforated synapses show no differences, whereas the distributions for perforated synapses show that a larger proportion have a high number of AMPAR particles in mSO and dSO as compared to pSO (Figure 3H). The opposite is true for NMDAR particles: perforated synapses in pSO tend to have higher numbers of immunogold particles (Figure 3I). In summary, our experimental results indicate that the number of nonperforated synapses decreases with distance from the soma but that their relative strength remains constant. In contrast, the number of perforated synapses remains constant throughout SO, but their AMPAR and NMDAR expression levels are regulated in opposite directions. To provide a functional context for these results, and a computational comparison of the impact of such scaling in the apical dendrites (Nicholson et al., 2006Nicholson D.A. Trana R.E. Katz Y.

Synapse distribution suggests a two-stage model of dendritic integration in CA1 pyramidal neurons.Neuron. 2009; 63: 171-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), we conducted simulations examining their impact on somatic and dendritic voltage, as described below. To explore the effects of the observed distribution of synapses and their ion channels on synaptic integration in the basal dendrites, we used the NEURON simulation environment to run multicompartmental simulations with a reconstructed CA1 pyramidal neuron model (Figure 4A). The passive properties of the model were fit using previous experimental data (Golding et al., 2005Golding N.L. Mickus T.J. Katz Y. Kath W.L. Spruston N. Factors mediating powerful voltage attenuation along CA1 pyramidal neuron dendrites.J. Physiol. 2005; 568: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and all synapses were placed on simulated spines with neck resistances of ∼500 MΩ (see Harnett et al., 2012Harnett M.T. Makara J.K. Spruston N. Kath W.L. Magee J.C. Synaptic amplification by dendritic spines enhances input cooperativity.Nature. 2012; 491: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Synaptic AMPAR conductances were set such that individual proximal perforated synapses generated an ∼0.2 mV somatic EPSP on average (Figure 4B). This conductance was then divided by the average number of immunogold particles for AMPARs among perforated synapses in pSO, yielding the conductance associated with a single immunogold particle (gparticle). AMPAR-mediated synaptic conductance, gsyn, was then determined using linear interpolation of the experimentally observed particle numbers (Figure 3) as a function of dendritic location. The gparticle for NMDAR immunogold particles was scaled such that NMDAR conductances matched experimentally observed ratios between unitary AMPAR- and NMDAR-mediated currents. In agreement with experimental data (Bloodgood et al., 2009Bloodgood B.L. Giessel A.J. Sabatini B.L. Biphasic synaptic Ca influx arising from compartmentalized electrical signals in dendritic spines.PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e1000190Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), simulated NMDAR-mediated conductances have a significant impact on EPSPs, even when the local depolarization is less than 2 mV. Consistent with this observation, in our simulations, some NMDAR-mediated current flows at synapses even in the absence of activation of their AMPARs (see also Harnett et al., 2012Harnett M.T. Makara J.K. Spruston N. Kath W.L. Magee J.C. Synaptic amplification by dendritic spines enhances input cooperativity.Nature. 2012; 491: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Simulations were conducted with the parsimonious, though unverified, presumption that conductances scale linearly with receptor number. For nonperforated synapses, which show no distance-dependent variation in either AMPAR- or NMDAR-mediated conductance, simulations indicate that proximal synapses generate measurably larger somatic voltage changes than distal ones (Figure 4C). This is also the case for perforated synapses lacking distance-dependent variation in AMPAR- and NMDAR-mediated conductance (Figure 4C). These simulations suggest that uniform synaptic conductances, within either perforated or nonperforated synapses, lead to underrepresentation of middle and distal synaptic input. Our previous work has shown that AMPAR-mediated conductance among perforated synapses scales with distance from the soma in the apical dendrites, whereas NMDAR-mediated conductance remains constant (Nicholson et al., 2006Nicholson D.A. Trana R.E. Katz Y. Kath W.L. Spruston N. Geinisman Y. Distance-dependent differences in synapse number and AMPA receptor expression in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.Neuron. 2006; 50: 431-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We simulated such a scenario (referred to as the “mixed conductance” case) in the basal dendrites (Figure 4D), which notably results in somatic EPSP amplitudes that are location independent (Figure 4E). Given that perforated synapses do not have uniform AMPAR- and NMDAR-mediated conductances throughout the basal dendritic tree (based on Figures 3E and 3F), we ran simulations where they matched the experimentally observed distributions (Figure 4F). This conductance distribution also leads to somatic EPSP amplitudes that are largely independent of the activated synapse’s location (Figure 4G). Therefore, in both the “mixed” and the experimentally observed conductance simulations, the distance-dependent increase in AMPAR-mediated conductance among perforated synapses allows their unitary somatic EPSPs to be independent of the location of the activated synapse. The observation that the AMPAR-mediated conductance gradient alone accounts for normalization of somatic EPSPs among perforated synapses raises the question of why the observed distribution of their NMDARs exhibits a decrease in the distal dendrites. One possibility is that the experimentally observed distance-dependent decrease in NMDAR expression helps to regulate the local influx of current through NMDARs, thereby normalizing Ca2+ entry at the synapse. The high input impedance and large AMPAR-mediated currents at distal synapses are expected to cause large local depolarizations and thus more"
https://openalex.org/W1995871057,"Formin family actin nucleators are potential coordinators of the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons, as they can both nucleate actin filaments and bind microtubules in vitro. To gain a more detailed mechanistic understanding of formin-microtubule interactions and formin-mediated actin-microtubule cross-talk, we studied microtubule binding by Cappuccino (Capu), a formin involved in regulating actin and microtubule organization during Drosophila oogenesis. We found that two distinct domains within Capu, FH2 and tail, work together to promote high-affinity microtubule binding. The tail domain appears to bind microtubules through nonspecific charge-based interactions. In contrast, distinct residues within the FH2 domain are important for microtubule binding. We also report the first visualization of a formin polymerizing actin filaments in the presence of microtubules. Interestingly, microtubules are potent inhibitors of the actin nucleation activity of Capu but appear to have little effect on Capu once it is bound to the barbed end of an elongating filament. Because Capu does not simultaneously bind microtubules and assemble actin filaments in vitro, its actin assembly and microtubule binding activities likely require spatial and/or temporal regulation within the Drosophila oocyte."

https://openalex.org/W2090828488,"GAT107, the (+)-enantiomer of racemic 4-(4-bromophenyl)-3a,4,5,9b-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]quinoline-8-sulfonamide, is a strong positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) activation by orthosteric agonists with intrinsic allosteric agonist activities. The direct activation produced by GAT107 in electrophysiological studies is observed only as long as GAT107 is freely diffusible in solution, although the potentiating activity primed by GAT107 can persist for over 30 min after drug washout. Direct activation is sensitive to α7 nAChR antagonist methyllycaconitine, although the primed potentiation is not. The data are consistent with GAT107 activity arising from two different sites. We show that the coupling between PAMs and the binding of orthosteric ligands requires tryptophan 55 (Trp-55), which is located at the subunit interface on the complementary surface of the orthosteric binding site. Mutations of Trp-55 increase the direct activation produced by GAT107 and reduce or prevent the synergy between allosteric and orthosteric binding sites, so that these mutants can also be directly activated by other PAMs such as PNU-120596 and TQS, which do not activate wild-type α7 in the absence of orthosteric agonists. We identify Tyr-93 as an essential element for orthosteric activation, because Y93C mutants are insensitive to orthosteric agonists but respond to GAT107. Our data show that both orthosteric and allosteric activation of α7 nAChR require cooperative activity at the interface between the subunits in the extracellular domain. These cooperative effects rely on key aromatic residues, and although mutations of Trp-55 reduce the restraints placed on the requirement for orthosteric agonists, Tyr-93 can conduct both orthosteric activation and desensitization among the subunits."
https://openalex.org/W2050175672,"Merozoite surface protein 3 of Plasmodium falciparum, a 40-kDa protein that also binds heme, has been biophysically characterized for its tendency to form highly elongated oligomers. This study aims to systematically analyze the regions in MSP3 sequence involved in oligomerization and correlate its aggregation tendency with its high affinity for binding with heme. Through size exclusion chromatography, dynamic light scattering, and transmission electron microscopy, we have found that MSP3, previously known to form elongated oligomers, actually forms self-assembled filamentous structures that possess amyloid-like characteristics. By expressing different regions of MSP3, we observed that the previously described leucine zipper region at the C terminus of MSP3 may not be the only structural element responsible for oligomerization and that other peptide segments like MSP3(192-196) (YILGW) may also be required. MSP3 aggregates on incubation were transformed to long unbranched amyloid fibrils. Using immunostaining methods, we found that 5-15-μm-long fibrillar structures stained by anti-MSP3 antibodies were attached to the merozoite surface and also associated with erythrocyte membrane. We also found MSP3 to bind several molecules of heme by UV spectrophotometry, HPLC, and electrophoresis. This study suggested that its ability to bind heme is somehow related to its inherent characteristics to form oligomers. Moreover, heme interaction with a surface protein like MSP3, which does not participate in hemozoin formation, may suggest a protective role against the heme released from unprocessed hemoglobin released after schizont egress. These studies point to the other roles that MSP3 may play during the blood stages of the parasite, in addition to be an important vaccine candidate."

Despite the importance of maintaining adequate SMN levels, little is known about factors that control SMN expression, particularly 3' end processing of the SMN pre-mRNA. In this study, we identify the U1A protein as a key regulator of SMN expression. U1A, a component of the U1 snRNP, is known to inhibit polyadenylation upon direct binding to mRNA. We show that U1A binds directly and with high affinity and specificity to the SMN 3'-UTR adjacent to the polyadenylation site, independent of the U1 snRNP (U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein). Binding of U1A inhibits polyadenylation of the SMN pre-mRNA by specifically inhibiting 3' cleavage by the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor. Expression of U1A in excess of U1 snRNA causes inhibition of SMN polyadenylation and decreases SMN protein levels. This work reveals a new mechanism for regulating SMN levels and provides new insight into the roles of U1A in 3' processing of mRNAs."

The Drosophila lipocalin NLaz (neural Lazarillo) modulates the IIS pathway and regulates longevity, stress resistance, and behavior. Here, we test whether a native hydrophobic pocket structure is required for NLaz to perform its functions. We use a point mutation altering the binding pocket (NLazL130R) and control mutations outside NLaz binding pocket. Tryptophan fluorescence titration reveals that NLazL130R loses its ability to bind ergosterol and the pheromone 7(z)-tricosene but retains retinoic acid binding. Using site-directed transgenesis in Drosophila, we test the functionality of the ligand binding-altered lipocalin at the organism level. NLaz-dependent life span reduction, oxidative stress and starvation sensitivity, aging markers accumulation, and deficient courtship are rescued by overexpression of NLazWT, but not of NLazL130R. Transcriptional responses to aging and oxidative stress show a large set of age-responsive genes dependent on the integrity of NLaz binding pocket. Inhibition of IIS activity and modulation of oxidative stress and infection-responsive genes are binding pocket-dependent processes.

https://openalex.org/W2013778765,"The oral mucosal epithelium is typically insulted during chemotherapy and ionizing radiation (IR) therapy and disposed to mucositis, which creates painful inflammation and ulceration in the oral cavity. Oral mucositis alters gene expression patterns, inhibits cellular growth, and initiates cell death in the oral epithelial compartments. Such alterations are governed by several different factors, including transcription factors, RNA-binding proteins, and microRNAs. IR-induced post-transcriptional regulation of RNA-binding proteins exists but is poorly studied in clinically relevant settings. We herein report that the RNA-binding protein human antigen R (HuR) undergoes cleavage modification by caspase-3 following IR-induced oral mucositis and subsequently promotes the expression of the pro-apoptotic factor BAX (Bcl-2-associated X protein), as well as cell death. Further analyses revealed that the HuR cleavage product-1 (HuR-CP1) directly associates and stabilizes the BAX mRNA and concurrently activates the apoptotic pathway. On the other hand, a noncleavable isoform of HuR promotes the clonogenic capacity of primary oral keratinocytes and decreases the effect of IR-induced cell death. Additionally, specific inhibition of caspase-3 by a compound, NSC321205, increases the clonogenic capacity of primary oral keratinocytes and causes increased basal layer cellularity, thickened mucosa, and elevated epithelial cell growth in the tongues of mice with oral mucositis. This protective effect of NSC321205 is mediated by a decrease in caspase-3 activity and the consequent inhibition of HuR cleavage, which reduces the expression of BAX in mice with IR-induced oral mucositis. Thus, we have identified a new molecular mechanism of HuR in the regulation of mRNA turnover and apoptosis in oral mucositis, and our data suggest that blocking the cleavage of HuR enhances cellular growth in the oral epithelial compartment."

https://openalex.org/W1977095652,"Tropomyosin (Tm) is an actin-binding, thin filament, two-stranded α-helical coiled-coil critical for muscle contraction and cytoskeletal function. We made the first identification of a stability control region (SCR), residues 97-118, in the Tm sequence that controls overall protein stability but is not required for folding. We also showed that the individual α-helical strands of the coiled-coil are stabilized by Leu-110, whereas the hydrophobic core is destabilized in the SCR by Ala residues at three consecutive d positions. Our hypothesis is that the stabilization of the individual α-helices provides an optimum stability and allows functionally beneficial dynamic motion between the α-helices that is critical for the transmission of stabilizing information along the coiled-coil from the SCR. We prepared three recombinant (rat) Tm(1-131) proteins, including the wild type sequence, a destabilizing mutation L110A, and a stabilizing mutation A109L. These proteins were evaluated by circular dichroism (CD) and differential scanning calorimetry. The single mutation L110A destabilizes the entire Tm(1-131) molecule, showing that the effect of this mutation is transmitted 165 Å along the coiled-coil in the N-terminal direction. The single mutation A109L prevents the SCR from transmitting stabilizing information and separates the coiled-coil into two domains, one that is ∼9 °C more stable than wild type and one that is ∼16 °C less stable. We know of no other example of the substitution of a stabilizing Leu residue in a coiled-coil hydrophobic core position d that causes this dramatic effect. We demonstrate the importance of the SCR in controlling and transmitting the stability signal along this rodlike molecule."

Here we show that the peptidoglycan recycling enzyme 1,6-anhydro-N-acetylmuramic acid kinase (AnmK) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa undergoes large conformational changes during its catalytic cycle, with its two domains rotating apart by up to 32° around two hinge regions to expose an active site cleft into which the substrates 1,6-anhydroMurNAc and ATP can bind. X-ray structures of the open state bound to a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog (AMPPCP) and 1,6-anhydroMurNAc provide detailed insight into a ternary complex that forms preceding an operative Michaelis complex. Structural analysis of the hinge regions demonstrates a role for nucleotide binding and possible cross-talk between the bound ligands to modulate the opening and closing of AnmK. Although AnmK was found to exhibit similar binding affinities for ATP, ADP, and AMPPCP according to fluorescence spectroscopy, small angle x-ray scattering analyses revealed that AnmK adopts an open conformation in solution in the absence of ligand and that it remains in this open state after binding AMPPCP, as we had observed for our crystal structure of this complex. In contrast, the enzyme favored a closed conformation when bound to ADP in solution, consistent with a previous crystal structure of this complex. Together, our findings show that the open conformation of AnmK facilitates binding of both the sugar and nucleotide substrates and that large structural rearrangements must occur upon closure of the enzyme to correctly align the substrates and residues of the enzyme for catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W2047858693,"The crystal structure of the sensorless pore module of a voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channel showed that lipids occupy a crevice between subunits. We asked if individual lipid monolayers of the bilayer embody independent modules linked to channel gating modulation. Functional studies using single channel current recordings of the sensorless pore module reconstituted in symmetric and asymmetric lipid bilayers allowed us to establish the deterministic role of lipid headgroup on gating. We discovered that individual monolayers with headgroups that coat the bilayer-aqueous interface with hydroxyls stabilize the channel open conformation. The hydroxyl need not be at a terminal position and the effect is not dependent on the presence of phosphate or net charge on the lipid headgroup. Asymmetric lipid bilayers allowed us to determine that phosphoglycerides with glycerol or inositol on the extracellular facing monolayer stabilize the open conformation of the channel. This indirect effect is attributed to a change in water structure at the membrane interface. By contrast, inclusion of the positively charged lysyl-dioleoyl-phosphatidylglycerol exclusively on the cytoplasmic facing monolayer of the bilayer increases drastically the probability of finding the channel open. Such modulation is mediated by a π-cation interaction between Phe-19 of the pore module and the lysyl moiety anchored to the phosphatidylglycerol headgroup. The new findings imply that the specific chemistry of the lipid headgroup and its selective location in either monolayer of the bilayer dictate the stability of the open conformation of a Kv pore module in the absence of voltage-sensing modules. The crystal structure of the sensorless pore module of a voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channel showed that lipids occupy a crevice between subunits. We asked if individual lipid monolayers of the bilayer embody independent modules linked to channel gating modulation. Functional studies using single channel current recordings of the sensorless pore module reconstituted in symmetric and asymmetric lipid bilayers allowed us to establish the deterministic role of lipid headgroup on gating. We discovered that individual monolayers with headgroups that coat the bilayer-aqueous interface with hydroxyls stabilize the channel open conformation. The hydroxyl need not be at a terminal position and the effect is not dependent on the presence of phosphate or net charge on the lipid headgroup. Asymmetric lipid bilayers allowed us to determine that phosphoglycerides with glycerol or inositol on the extracellular facing monolayer stabilize the open conformation of the channel. This indirect effect is attributed to a change in water structure at the membrane interface. By contrast, inclusion of the positively charged lysyl-dioleoyl-phosphatidylglycerol exclusively on the cytoplasmic facing monolayer of the bilayer increases drastically the probability of finding the channel open. Such modulation is mediated by a π-cation interaction between Phe-19 of the pore module and the lysyl moiety anchored to the phosphatidylglycerol headgroup. The new findings imply that the specific chemistry of the lipid headgroup and its selective location in either monolayer of the bilayer dictate the stability of the open conformation of a Kv pore module in the absence of voltage-sensing modules. Voltage-gated channels responsible for cellular excitability are assemblies of modular membrane protein subunits consisting of two distinct, tandemly arranged, functional modules.

Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1694: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A role for lipids on the inactivation of Kv channels, namely the ability of the channel to close and remain closed for prolonged periods while voltage-clamped at an activating potential, has been previously demonstrated (24.Schmidt D. MacKinnon R. Voltage-dependent K+ channel gating and voltage sensor toxin sensitivity depend on the mechanical state of the lipid membrane.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 19276-19281Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 33.Schmidt D. Cross S.R. MacKinnon R.

In recent years this modulatory effect has been attributed solely to an interaction of the lipid bilayer with the voltage-sensor module. The mechanical properties of the membrane are dictated by its lipid composition and the interaction of the basic charges on the sensor with lipid headgroup phosphates as a means to facilitate sensor movement and therefore pore opening (22.Schmidt D. Jiang Q.X. MacKinnon R. Phospholipids and the origin of cationic gating charges in voltage sensors.Nature. 2006; 444: 775-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 25.Xu Y. Ramu Y. Lu Z. Removal of phospho-head groups of membrane lipids immobilizes voltage sensors of K+ channels.Nature. 2008; 451: 826-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the sensorless PM of a Kv channel showed four immobilized lipids filling and surrounding a crevice between subunits at the extracellular surface of the channel, suggesting an affinity for lipids in that region (5.Santos J.S. Asmar-Rovira G.A. Han G.W. Liu W. Syeda R. Cherezov V. Baker K.A. Stevens R.C. Montal M. Crystal structure of a voltage-gated K+ channel pore module in a closed state in lipid membranes.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 43063-43070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked if different lipids could act as selective modulators of ion channel function by acting as co-factors in the ion translocation process. Functional studies using single channel current recordings of a sensorless PM reconstituted in symmetric and asymmetric lipid bilayers allowed us to establish the deterministic role of the lipid headgroup on gating the two channel gates located at the selectivity filter (34.Hoshi T.

Where they are and how they behave.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 112-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (4480) Google Scholar) allowed us to uncover two mechanisms for the stabilization of the open channel conformation. First, we discovered that the inclusion of lipids with headgroups that coat the extracellular membrane-solution interface with hydroxyl groups such as those found in glycerol, phosphoglycerol, phosphoinositol, and lysyl-phosphoglycerol increased drastically the probability of finding the channel open. This effect was observed to be independent of headgroup charge, number of acyl chains, and whether the chains were methyl branched or not. We propose that the stabilizing effect of these surface-coating hydroxyls is indirectly mediated by an interaction with water at the membrane-solution interface. We further validate this proposal by demonstrating that the addition of 1% (0.17 m) ethylene glycol or 0.2 m mannitol to the extracellular bathing solution of lipid bilayers lacking exposed hydroxyls emulates the gain in open conformation stability observed when lipids with exposed hydroxyls are present at the extracellular membrane interface. Second, we unveiled a π-cation interaction (43.Ma J.C. Dougherty D.A. The cation-π interaction.Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 1303-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (3314) Google Scholar) between a lysine containing lipid headgroup and a conserved aromatic residue in Kv channels at the protein cytoplasmic surface as an additional stabilizer to generate an open, rarely interrupted, K+ permeation path. The new findings provide evidence that the PM of Kv channels may be transformed into an open conductor through interactions with lipid modulators that target either the filter gate, through a destabilization of water structure, or the bundle gate, via a direct interaction, and thereby stabilize the conducting conformation of the channel. The implication is that lipids are crucial not only for proper protein folding (44.Valiyaveetil F.I. Zhou Y. MacKinnon R. Lipids in the structure, folding, and function of the KcsA K+ channel.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10771-10777Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) but also to modulate, in a deterministic manner, the properties of the channel. KvLm PM, WT, and mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli XL1-Blue with a C-terminal His tag and purified by Ni2+-affinity and size exclusion chromatography as previously described (45.Santos J.S. Syeda R. Montal M. Stabilization of the conductive conformation of a Kv channel. The lid mechanism.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 16619-16628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Single channel mutations were introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Liposomes were composed of 100 mol % of 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3 phosphocholine (DPhPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DPhPE), or 90 mol % of DPhPC and 10 mol % of the indicated test lipids: DOPC, DPhPE, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidic acid (DOPA), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-rac-glycerol) (DOPG), 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-rac-glycerol) (DPhPG), 1-oleoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-rac-glycerol) (lyso-PG), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-myo-inositol) (DOPI), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(3-lysyl(1-glycerol))] (lysyl-DOPG), 1-oleoyl-rac-glycerol (monoolein) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine N-(methoxy(polyethylene glycol))-350 (DOPE-PEG350) (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) (Fig. 1). Liposomes were prepared as previously described (45.Santos J.S. Syeda R. Montal M. Stabilization of the conductive conformation of a Kv channel. The lid mechanism.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 16619-16628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). When indicated, ethylene glycol (0.17 m) or mannitol (0.2 m) were supplemented to the rehydrated liposome suspension prior to extrusion. For reconstitution, the protein was diluted ∼100–300-fold into preformed liposomes to give final protein concentrations 2–5 μg/ml. The proteoliposomes were incubated on ice for 15 min prior to bilayer recording experiments. Fresh aliquots of liposomes and protein were used for every experiment. Single channel currents were recorded from droplet interface bilayers as described (10.Syeda R. Santos J.S. Montal M. Bayley H. Tetrameric assembly of KvLm K+ channels with defined numbers of voltage sensors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 16917-16922Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 46.Bayley H. Cronin B. Heron A. Holden M.A. Hwang W.L. Syeda R. Thompson J. Wallace M. Droplet interface bilayers.Mol. Biosyst. 2008; 4: 1191-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 10 × 10 × 4-mm Plexiglas chamber was filled with hexadecane (Sigma) containing 1 mol % of DPhPC. A 0.2-mm diameter Ag/AgCl wire electrode (40 mm in length) was attached to each of two micromanipulators (NMN-21, Narishige, Japan). Droplets (∼200 nl) were placed with a pipette on each of the electrodes, which had been coated with 3% (w/v) low-melt agarose (65 °C). The electrode carrying the droplet with the proteoliposomes in 0.5 m KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, was connected to the grounded end (cis side) of the amplifier head-stage. The second electrode, in a droplet containing exclusively liposomes in the same buffer, was connected to the working end of the head-stage (trans side). The chamber, electrodes, and the amplifier head-stage were enclosed in a Faraday cage. The droplets were incubated in hexadecane containing 1 mol % of DPhPC until a monolayer of lipid had formed around them (∼5 min). A bilayer spontaneously formed when the two droplets were brought into contact. Regardless of bilayer composition, and symmetric or asymmetric configuration, the proteoliposome droplet was always placed on the cis compartment to ensure that the filter gate of the channel protein remained on the cis side and was exposed to only one class of lipids. To confirm the orientation of the protein in the reconstituted bilayers with the consequent outward flow of current (from bundle to filter), the open channel blocker tetrabutyl ammonium was used (45.Santos J.S. Syeda R. Montal M. Stabilization of the conductive conformation of a Kv channel. The lid mechanism.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 16619-16628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Tetrabutyl ammonium stocks (5 mm) were made in droplet solution (0.5 m KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and injected into the bundle-facing droplet (trans side) at the end of each experiment to a final concentration of 50 μm using a Nano injector (VWR instrument). In all configurations, channel orientation was verified by sided tetrabutyl ammonium block. The test lipids were always supplemented at 10 mol % in 90 mol % of DPhPC. To increase the signal-to-noise ratio all electrical measurements were performed in 0.5 m KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, at 100 mV and 22 ± 2 °C, unless otherwise indicated. Single channel currents were sampled at 20 kHz using an Axon 200B patch clamp amplifier, filtered by using a low pass Bessel filter (80 dB/decade) with a corner frequency of 2 kHz, and then digitized with a DigiData 1320 A/D converter (Axon Instruments). All pre-processing and analysis of the single channel recordings was performed with QuB software. Currents in symmetric lysyl-DOPG were further filtered to 400–700 Hz, whereas additional off-line filtering of 2 kHz was used for all other recordings. Event detection was performed by time course fitting with the segmental k-means algorithm (SKM) (47.Qin F. Restoration of single-channel currents using the segmental k-means method based on hidden Markov modeling.Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 1488-1501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Stretches of the recordings in which the channel was closed were included in the analysis; hence, the calculated Po is proportional to the ratio of open time/total time of the recording. Segments of continuous recordings in the range of 30 s ≤ t ≤ 400 s were used for analysis. To avoid the detection of erroneous events, the receiver dead time (td) was set at 300 μs for all recordings except for PM in symmetric lysyl-DOPG for which the td was set to 700–1000 μs. Accordingly, transitions shorter than the td were ignored; transitions longer than the td were accepted as “events.” To calculate the median burst length, bursts were defined as a group of three or more opening transitions with intraburst closures shorter than τ-critical (τcrit) and terminated by an interburst closure longer than τcrit. The value of τcrit was calculated from the closed dwell time histograms in QuB for each record (3 ms ≤ τcrit ≤ 20 ms). All the results reported were done at least in triplicate; the calculated values are reported as mean ± S.E. N and n denote the number of events and number of experiments, respectively. Statistical significance was assessed using the unpaired, two-tailed Student's t test. Wherever the statement “equal within error” appears, the p value was >0.05, indicating that the two groups in question are equal and there is no significant statistical difference. By contrast, wherever the open probability (or any other parameter) is stated to be “x-fold higher,” the p value was <0.05 indicating that the differences are statistically significant. To determine which residues in the PM are within 5 Å of a lipid phosphate or choline headgroup we used YASARA (Yasara Bioscience) to run a 10 ns molecular dynamics simulation (48.Krieger E. Darden T.

Force-field parameterization in crystal space.Proteins. 2004; 57: 678-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar) of KvLm PM (5.Santos J.S. Asmar-Rovira G.A. Han G.W. Liu W. Syeda R. Cherezov V.

At the end of the simulation, residues within 5 Å of a phosphate oxygen or a choline nitrogen were identified, given that the Debye screening at 0.5 m salt is 4 Å. The simulation was performed at 25 °C and pH 7.4 with the salt concentration fixed at 0.5 m KCl. The AMBER03 force-field was employed (49.Duan Y. Wu C. Chowdhury S. Lee M.C. Xiong G. Zhang W. Yang R.

Chem. 2003; 24: 1999-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (3730) Google Scholar). To investigate the functional consequence of an interaction between the PM of a Kv channel and the surrounding lipids, PM function was screened in lipid bilayers with varying headgroup chemistry and acyl chains (Fig. 1). The sensorless PM of KvLm was reconstituted in droplet interface bilayers in which both cytoplasmic and extracellular leaflets were of equal composition (symmetric bilayers, Fig. 1J); channel function was assayed by monitoring the single channel steady-state activity at a depolarizing potential of 100 mV while bathing both sides of the membrane in 0.5 m KCl. Channel function was first assayed in 100 mol % of DPhPC, DOPC, or DPhPE. In these bilayers of zwitterionic phospholipid"
