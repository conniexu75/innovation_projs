By means of an exchange reaction they were able to demonstrate the in- corporation of isotopic carbon dioxide into the p-carboxyl group of oxal- acetic acid in the presence of this enzyme (2). Similar results were ob- tained by Evans, Vennesland, and Slotin (3) with an enzyme system from pigeon liver. Further studies on the C+Cl condensation have been re- viewed by Wood (4) and will, therefore, not be discussed here. The apparent importance of oxalacetate decarboxylase as one of the gateway enzymes for the fixation of carbon dioxide into compounds of the Krebs isocitric acid cycle made it of interest to attempt to purify this enzyme and to study some of its properties. The biotin content of the enzyme fractions at various stages of purity was determined in view of the recent implication of biotin in the metabolism of carbon dioxide (5-11). Lee, Burris, and Wilson (12) demonstrated that cell-free preparations of Azotobacter vinelandii have oxalacetate decarboxylase activity. Since this organism is easily grown on a large scale (13), cell-free extracts of this bacterium were used as the source material for this study."

They suppose that the process genuine denatured is forced in tjae direction of the right-hand side of the equation by splitting of the D-form, both forms gradually disappearing ; and they suggest that the pepfcme bonds as such are masked in native globular proteins, and first 'appear' on denaturation."

https://openalex.org/W106046065,"DIŒCY, the separation of the sexes on to different diploid individuals, occurs irregularly throughout the higher plants. It must therefore have arisen a number of times during the evolution of this group. Thus the genetical control of diœcy is of considerable interest, particularly in regard to the differences between diœcious forms and their monœcious or hermaphroditic relatives. Little information has been available about such differences in the past; but two mimeographed papers1,2 have now been circulated, in which Dr. F. Galàn, of the University of Salamanca, describes the results of crosses between dioecious and monoecious forms of the cucurbitous plant Ecballium elaterium."

https://openalex.org/W2067774119,"THE hydrogen electrode is the primary standard to which all electrode potentials are referred and is used in cells without liquid junction for measurements of high accuracy. The potential of the hydrogen electrode is corrected to the standard pressure of one atmosphere on the basis that the electrode is in equilibrium with the measured partial pressure of hydrogen above the solution. It is, however, not the gas phase which directly determines the potential, but the hydrogen in solution ; and a tacit assumption that the concentration of dissolved hydrogen is unequivocally defined by the gas pressure is false. This error can arise in two ways."

https://openalex.org/W2027799494,"WE have kept some Ilford Nuclear Research photographic plates in our underground laboratory, which is at a depth of 30 m. under London clay (60 m. water-equivalent). Hot liquid emulsiOn was brought from the Ilford works to the laboratory, where the required volume was measured out in a measuring cylinder and then poured on to a horizontal glass plate. After leaving to dry for one day, the plates were cut to a convenient size and stored vertically. After a period of sixty days, they were developed in the same underground laboratory. We feel confident that any nuclear tracks we observe were produced underground. We have so far examined 10 c.c. of emulsion, and have found six nuclear disintegrations containing three or more tracks. This gives a rough estimate for the rate of production of these stars at this depth of â¼ 0.01 ± 0.004 stars/c.c./day. The numbers of tracks in the various stars were as follows:"

Early this year, a few rods of the metal fe supplied to the Physics Division of the National Physical Laboratory for the purpose of investigating some of the thermal and electrical properties of the solid and liquid phases (the melting point is just below 30° C., and marked supercooling of the liquid phase occurs)."

It was of particular interest to determine whether virus growing in the presence of radioactive phosphorus would incorporate the isotope into its structure. Some of the results are described here."

https://openalex.org/W2071050745,"SEVERAL papers have recently been published1–4 on the efficiency of naphthalene, anthracene and other organic phosphors used in conjunction with photo-multipliers as detectors of ionizing radiations. In view of the conflicting nature of some of these results, we have carried out experiments with these substances, particular attention being paid to their purity. The phosphors investigated were naphthalene, anthracene and stilbene, and the measurements were made using an EMI Type 4140 photomultiplier with a single-channel pulse analyser to record pulse-height distributions."

https://openalex.org/W1983883517,"WE have described elsewhere a technique for the production of experimental macrocytic anæmia in the rat by the formation of a cul-de-sac in the small intestine, and preliminary observations suggested that a hæmatological remission could be induced in some of the anæmic animals by treatment with purified liver extracts1,2. An experiment was planned to test the effects of continued treatment with large doses of purified liver extract ('Anahæmin'), pteroyl glutamic acid and vitamin B12 on this experimental anæmia, and the results so far are sufficiently interesting to warrant this brief report."

https://openalex.org/W2047975717,"A SUMMARY of the various recent views on the dissociation energy of carbon monoxide is given by Gaydon1 in his ""Dissociation Energies"", in which he eliminates all proposed values except 11·11 and 9·85 eV., and finally accepts the former as being the more probable. At about the same time, Kenty, Aicher, Noel, Paritsky and Paolino2 observed a new band system of molecular oxygen in a gas discharge containing carbon dioxide which suggested a lower limit for D (CO) of 9·4 eV. Since then, Hagstrum3 has defended his electron-impact value of 9·6 eV., Gëro4 through Valatin5 still retains faith in 6·9 eV., and Brewer, Gilles and Jenkins6 have made a determination of the heat of sublimation of graphite which indirectly supports 11·1 eV. Due to this confusion, which has now persisted for some time, the spectroscopic method of evaluating dissociation energies is in danger of being regarded with cynicism by those physical and organic chemists who urgently need this constant for carbon monoxide. The trouble lies in the lack of any dissociation continuum in the spectrum of carbon monoxide, and accordingly attention has been centred on predissociation phenomena, of which there seems no lack."

https://openalex.org/W2049360727,"RECENT work on the chemistry of the heavy elements formed one main topic of a symposium, organised by the Chemistry Division of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment Harwell, on behalf of the Chemical Society and held at Rhodes House, Oxford, during March 28–30. The discovery of the transuranic elements, neptunium, plutonium, americium and curium, has demostrated that a new transition series, like that of the rare earth elements, ariving from the filling of 5f-electron levels, commences ar some stage subsequent to actinium (atomic number 89). Any attempt to trace the chemical relationships between these heavy elements, and the elements standing above them in the Periodic Table, shows how fragmentary and inexact is the existing knowledge even of the chemistry of uranium and thorium, although the former was discovered by Klaproth in 1789 and the latter by Berzelius in 1828."
https://openalex.org/W2058496192,"Neodrilus agilis n.sp. is the second species of the genus, and is distinguished from N. monocystis, Beddard, 1887, by the possession of two pairs of calciferous glands, situated in segments XIV and XV, and by many small diverticula of the spermatheca clustered around the spermathecal duct."
https://openalex.org/W2061774086,"THE aerobic nature of mushroom composts plays an essential part in the production of good mushroom crops, so that it is desirable, in laboratory growth-experiments on mushroom mycelium, to use an aerobic medium of known composition in which growth measurements can be made. The only fully aerobic medium of this nature in general use, so far as I am aware, is milled filter paper1,2,3. Unfortunately, this material loses its aerobio qualities when only a small amount of nutrient solution has been absorbed on it. A medium based on milled transparent cellulose shavings, dyed black to enable mycelial growth to be observed, has now been found to be more satisfactory, and is prepared as follows."
