The projected increase in stratospheric oxides of nitrogen could reduce the ozone shield by about a factor of 2, thus permitting the harsh radiation below 300 nanometers to permeate the lower atmosphere."

A crystalline substance isolated from the active fraction of alfalfa meal increased the dry weight and water uptake of rice seedlings when sprayed on the foliage or applied in nutrient culture. The substance was identified as triacontanol by mass spectrometry. Sprays containing this compound also increased the growth of corn, and barley grown in soil. Authentic triacontanol produced a similar response over a wide range of concentrations on rice grown in nutrient cultures and tomatoes grown in soil."

This is the first time that identifiable quartz has been synthesized in aqueous solution at earth-surface conditions without the aging of an original amorphous precipitate. The concentration of dissolved silica in equilibrium with quartz at 20 degrees C and 1 atmosphere is 4.4+/-0.3 parts per million, a value in agreement with the theoretical value obtained by a constant heat capacity fit of higher temperature equilibrium data. This experiment confirms the results of petrologic investigations which suggest that quartz precipitates directly from aqueous solution during chemical weathering and early diagenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2084369554,"Radiometric (potassium-argon) age determinations for basalts and tuffs associated with middle to late Tertiary mammal-bearing horizons in Patagonia, southern Argentina, permit refinement of boundaries and hiatuses between beds of Deseadan (early Oligocene) through Friasian (middle to late Miocene) age. At two localities beds of Deseadan age are overlain by basalts, which gave dates of 33.6 and 35.4 million years ago; 34.0 million years ago is tentatively accepted as a terminal date for known Deseadan. At several localities beds of Colhuehuapian age are underlain by basalts, which gave dates ranging from 28.8 to 24.3 million years ago; 25.0 million years is tentatively taken as a basal age for known Colhuehuapian. The paleontological hiatus between known Deseadan and known Colhuehuapian is thus in the order of 9.0 million years. Two tuffs from the Santa Cruz Formation (Santacrucian) gave ages of 21.7 and 18.5 million years. Plagioclase and biotite concentrates of an ignimbrite from the Collón Curá Formation (Friasian) gave ages ranging from 15.4 to 14.0 million years."
https://openalex.org/W2029982222,"Chlorinated waters are being introduced into estuarine and coastal areas in increasing quantities. In such systems, the chlorine reacts with the natural bromide and ammonia to produce the highly toxic hypobromous acid, hypobromite ion, and haloamines. Sunlight causes up to 50 percent conversion to bromate ion, which is persistent in natural waters and has an unknown toxicity."

In the nature of the case, many of you will know more than I do about the physical and chemical causes and the biological consequences of environmental pollution. But pollution is also an economic problem, and economists have rather special ways of thinking about it, with implications for the design of environmental policy. What I can hope to do is to put the problem of pollution into the economist's framework, to see if that way of regarding it leads to any basic principles of regulation and control. The ancient economists used to classify productive resources as Land, Labor, and Capital. In this classification Land stood for all those natural resources that are given in amount and cannot be augmented by human decision. Some natural resources are"
https://openalex.org/W2015606270,An ultrahigh-frequency electromagnetic field (2450±20 megahertz) is lethal to plants and seeds of several species after relatively short exposure times. Some species are highly susceptible; others are relatively resistant to a given field intensity. Phytotoxicity is increased in imbibed seeds and young plants. It is decreased in dry seeds and sometimes decreased in mature plants. Soil partially attenuates the field but is not opaque to it.
https://openalex.org/W2006009950,"The rate of isoleucine epimerization in fossil planktonic foraminifera is strongly species-dependent. Alloisoleucine/isoleucine ratios of two species of the same age can vary by more than a factor of 2. This finding, in combination with the known temporal and spatial variability of foraminiferal assemblages, demonstrates the critical importance of basing geochronological studies of marine sediments on monospecific samples. One rapidly epimerizing species generates a calibration curve of potentially high precision for dating sediments between the ages of about 50,000 to 400,000 years."
https://openalex.org/W2013562491,"The iridescent body scales of the fossorial uropeltid snakes produce these interference colors by keratinous ridges spaced at 2500 Å. The pattern inhibits wetting of the surface and adhesion of soil particles and thus reduces friction between the snake's trunk and walls of its tunnel. The epidermal scales of the blunt tail show a sharply defined pattern of spines and ridges with convergent flutings. Dirt caught here forms a plug that protects the snake's caudal end. The sharp transition of surface textures suggests (i) that selection for each of the two roles is great, and (ii) that the interference colors of many fossorial snakes indicate that friction as well as dirt adhesion are being reduced."
https://openalex.org/W2039708454,The activity of 10-norprogesterone a physiologically active lower homolog of progesterone was tested in 2 castrated sexually mature rabbits. The rabbits were castrated 18 hours after mating. 1 rabbit received a total of 4.1 mg over a period of 5 days and at autopsy 6 normal blastocysts were found in the uterus with full proliferation in the endometrium. The 2nd rabbit received a total of .83 mg with no blastocysts observed in the uterus but with complete endometrial proliferation. This compound appears to be at least as active as progesterone and these results indicate that the angular methyl group at C-10 can be replaced with hydrogen without impairing the physiological activity.
https://openalex.org/W1965509099,Differences in total transit time can give rise to images that expand at arbitrarily high speed. Two versions of a model based on this idea can account for the varying microwave structure reported for the quasar 3C 279. Other possible examples are suggested.
https://openalex.org/W2056430649,"Both Hesperornis and Ichthyornis are toothed birds; they and Archaeopteryx share broad flattened teeth with highly expanded roots. The teeth of Ichthyornis have been reported to have been set in sockets as were those of Archaeopteryx , but new specimens of Ichthyornis show the teeth set in a groove as in Hesperornis . These new fossils are from an adult but not old bird; thus, the presence or absence of tooth sockets in birds may be dependent on age."
https://openalex.org/W2029368368,"Small but measurable lengthening of several survey lines within the eastern rift zone of Iceland occurred between 1967 and 1970. The changes can be interpreted as a widening of the rift by 6 to 7 centimeters, possibly during the 1970 eruption of Hekla volcano."

https://openalex.org/W2077665434,"Some consequences of Newtonian mechanics, previously overlooked, result in a new understanding of the behavior of small bodies in the solar system. Collisions between such bodies lead not to a scattering of these bodies over an increasing volume but instead to a contraction resulting in a ""jet stream,"" with application to meteor streams and streams of asteroids. It is possible that comets are formed by bunching in such streams."
https://openalex.org/W1968171293,"Van't Hoff's work constitutes the first systematic contribution to experimental petrology. At all times, the problem was perceived as geologic in nature and the laboratory results were checked against natural assemblages whenever possible. The phase rule was not used, nor, for that matter, was chemical thermodynamics, except for the Van't Hoff equation. However, the work of Van't Hoff and Van Deventer was indirectly involved in the evolution of phase theory by Roozeboom, Van Rijn van Alkemade, and Schreinemakers. Meyerhoffer himself wrote the first text explicitly devoted to the phase rule. The impact of Van't Hoff's study was enormous, but it was restricted to those geologists willing and able to cope with chemistry. Foremost among them were igneous petrologists who had long since accepted chemical arguments for classification purposes. I consider the Geophysical Laboratory program to be the most direct heir of the Van't Hoff approach. Although the shape of that program was formulated independently by Van Hise, Becker, Day, and others, the inspiration they derived from Van't Hoff's successes is clearly acknowledged. The study of the fusion of plagioclases by Day and Allen (41), which directly led to the authorization for the Geophysical Laboratory, was the igneous counterpart of Van't Hoff's low-temperature experimental petrology. On metamorphic petrology, too, Van't Hoff left his mark, with V. M. Goldschmidt acting as his disciple. The interpretation of the Kristiania contact rocks was explicitly based on Van't Hoff's double salt law in preference to the phase rule. Sedimentologists remained unaffected and continued their preoccupation with description and classification. Chemical arguments remained subordinate in their work and of an elementary nature, underscoring the chasm between ""hard"" rocks and ""soft"" rocks. This gulf is only now beginning to close as a result of the blossoming of experimental petrology and geochemistry since World War II. At last the generality of the point of view of Gibbs is being accepted. If Van't Hoff's contribution had been appreciated fully at the time, this could have happened 70 years earlier."

The northern edge of the Gulf Stream, the slope waters, and the shelf waters display complex thermal characteristics with distinct temperature gradients separating these three water masses. This type of information can be very useful for increasing our understanding of many physical phenomena that occur over Earth's oceans."
