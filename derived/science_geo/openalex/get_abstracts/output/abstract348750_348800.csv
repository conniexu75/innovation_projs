Among the simpler procedures known, the biuret reaction seemed to offer the most encouraging possibilities. Variations and improvements in the application of the biuret reaction to clinical chemistry can be traced in the works of Autenrieth (l), Hiller (2), Fine (3), Kingsley (4), and Robinson and Hogden (5). Kingsley (6) simplified the technique by adding serum directly to a “one piece” reagent. Efforts have been made to increase the stability of such biuret reagents with ethylene glycol (7), tartrate (8), and citrate (9)) We began our investigation with Kingsley’s (6) method and report briefly on the two main difficulties encountered in its use. The first is that the total protein (TP) reagent and, to a lesser extent, the albumin (ALB) reagent are not sufficiently stable. The length of time they remain so depends upon the technique of their preparation. One consequence of this variable stability is a difficulty in duplicating calibration curves with different lots of reagent. Errors may arise when results with a new reagent are read from an old calibration curve. Serious errors occur if a reagent is used after the separation of any black deposit gives evidence of deterioration. A second difficulty has been that total protein estimations made with the TP reagent and read, as prescribed, from calibration curves prepared with the ALB reagent have tended to be too low. Recorded in Table I are the results of a number of analyses in which Kingsley’s biuret procedure has been compared with the Kjeldahl method2 on both normal and ab-"

We have had occasion to repeat and extend their experiments during an investigation of the suitability of the pigeon as an agent for the biosynthesis of uric acid labeled in various positions with C14. This paper presents data on the yields of several different kinds of labeled uric acid obtained after injecting suitably labeled precursors and also provides information on the r6le of the methylene carbon of glycine’ in the synthesis of uric acid."

https://openalex.org/W2907802,"Knowledge concerning the amino acid content of the scleroproteins is far from complete. The summary tables of Block and Bolling (l), Cohn and Edsall (2), Schmidt (3), and Hawk et al. (4) offer the best available data, but there is much disagreement. Lindley (5) and Geiger (6) have recently reported on the constitution of wool. We are reporting on the content of fourteen amino acids in seven sclero- proteins. In some instances, our values differ substantially from reports in the literature. In other instances, the content of certain amino acids is reported for the first time."

https://openalex.org/W1553670625,The urease-catalyzed hydrolysis of urea has been found to be competitively inhibited by phosphate at pH 7.0 and 25°. The Michaelis constant of the urea-urease system has been found to be approximately 0.003 M urea and the comparable constant defining the phosphate-urease system 0.035 M phosphate.

At 40° and pH 7.8 in a 0.00344 M solution of the DL mixture the L component is hydrolyzed as rapidly as in a 0.00172 M solution of the L peptide (Table I). Because of the relative insolubility of N-benzoyl-DL-tyrosylglycinamide, it was not possible to study the reaction at higher substrate concentrations, and attention was directed to the much more soluble N-acetyl-DL-tyrosylglycinamide."

In this note the results of analyses carried out on dried plant tissue of Ceylonese origin are reported. We are deeply indebted to Dr. J. L. Simonsen, director of the Colonial Products Research Council, for his help in making supplies of this material available to us, and for his interest in these investigations."

The phenomenon can be demonstrated with no more elaborate apparatus than a 100-c.c. glass cylinder and a perforated disk as piston, mounted centrally on a metal rod terminating in a ring, a similar arrangement to the familiar ‘malted milk mixer'. The plunger not only serves to shear the contents of the cylinder, but also as a rough consistometer, the time of travel of the disk between any two graduations on the freely suspended cylinder serving as a measure, provided the rigidity component of consistency of the material is less than the hydrostatic load of the suspended cylinder."
