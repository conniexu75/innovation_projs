https://openalex.org/W1987080089,"Light microscopy immunohistochemical techniques were used to examine the distribution of glutamine synthetase in rat brain. Glutamine synthetase was found to be localized in the glial cells. Neuronal cell bodies, endothelial cells, and choroid epithelium contained no enzyme. The findings indicate that glia have a crucial role in glutamic acid, Î³-aminobutyric acid, and ammonia metabolism in brain."

https://openalex.org/W1485258003,"A specific association between spectrin and the inner surface of the human erythrocyte membrane has been examined by measuring the binding of purified [32P]spectrin to inside out, spectrin-depleted vesicles and to right side out ghost vesicles. Spectrin was labeled by incubating erythrocytes with 32Pi, and eluted from the ghost membranes by extraction in 0.3 mM NaPO4, pH 7.6. [32P]Spectrin was separated from actin and other proteins and isolated in a nonaggregated state as a So20,w = 7 S (in 0.3 mM NaPO4) or So20,w = 8 S (in 20 mM KCl, 0.3 mM NaPO4) protein after sedimentation on linear sucrose gradients. Binding of [32P]spectrin to inverted vesicles devoid of spectrin and actin was at least 10-fold greater than to right side out membranes, and exhibited different properties. Association with inside out vesicles was slow, was decreased to the value for right side out vesicles at high pH, or after heating spectrin above 50 degrees prior to assay, and was saturable with increasing levels of spectrin. Binding to everted vesicles was rapid, unaffected by pH or by heating spectrin, and rose linearly with the concentration of spectrin. Scatchard plots of binding to inverted vesicles were linear at pH 7.6, with a KD of 45 microng/ml, while at pH 6.6, plots were curvilinear and consistent with two types of interactions with a KD of 4 and 19 microng/ml, respectively. The maximal binding capacity at both pH values was about 200 microng of spectrin/mg of membrane protein. Unlabeled spectrin competed for binding with 50% displacement at 27 microng/ml. [32P]Spectrin dissociated and associated with inverted vesicles with an identical dependence on ionic strength as observed for elution of native spectrin from ghosts. MgCl2, CaCl2 (1 to 4 mM) and EDTA (0.5 to 1 mM) had little effect on binding in the presence of 20 mM KCl, while at low ionic strength, MgCl2 (1 mM) increased binding and inhibited dissociation to the same extent as 10 to 20 mM KCl. Binding was abolished by pretreatment of vesicles with 0.1 M acetic acid, or with 0.1 microng/ml of trypsin. The periodic acid-Schiff-staining bands were unaffected by trypsin digestion which destroyed binding; mild digestion, which decreased binding only 50%, converted Band 3 almost completely to a membrane-bound 50,000-dalton fragment resistant to further proteolysis. These experiments suggest that attachment of spectrin to the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane results from a selective protein-protein interaction which is independent of erythrocyte actin. A direct role of the major sialoglycoprotein or Band 3 as a membrane binding site appears unlikely."
https://openalex.org/W1544443580,"The binding of [3H]podophyllotoxin to tubulin, measured by a DEAE-cellulose filter paper method, occurs with an affinity constant of 1.8 X 10(6) M-1 (37 degrees at pH 6.7). Like colchicine, approximately 0.8 mol of podophyllotixin are bound per mol of tubulin dimer, and the reaction is entropy-driven (43 cal deg-1 mol-1). At 37 degrees the association rate constant for podophyllotoxin binding is 3.8 X 10(6) M-1 h-1, approximtaely 10 times higher than for colchicine; this is reflected in the activation energies for binding which are 14.7 kcal/mol for podophyllotoxin and 20.3 kcal/mol for colchicine. The dissociation rate constant for the tubulin-podophyllotoxin complex is 1.9 h-1, and the affinity constant calculated from the ratio of the rates is close to that obtained by equilibrium measurements. Podophyllotxin and colchicine are mutually competitive inhibitors. This can be ascribed to the fact that both compounds have a trimethoxyphenyl ring and analogues of either compound with bulky substituents in their trimethoxyphenyl moiety are unable to inhibit the the binding of either of the two ligands. Tropolone, which inhibits colchicine binding competitively, has no effect on the podophyllotoxin/tubulin reaction. Conversely, podophyllotoxin does not influence tropolone binding. Moreover, the tropolone binding site of tubulin does not show the temperature and pH lability of the colchicine and podophyllotoxin domains, hence this lability can be ascribed to the trimethoxyphenyl binding region of tubulin. Since podophyllotoxin analogues with a modified B ring do not bind, it is concluded that both podophyllotoxin and colchicine each have at least two points of attachment to tubulin and that they share one of them, the binding region of the trimethoxyphenyl moiety."
https://openalex.org/W1604163804,"Reaction of phospholipase A2 (Naja naja naja) with p-bromophenacyl bromidine leads to almost complete loss of enzymatic activity. The rate of inactivation is pH-dependent with pKa equals 6.9 for the ionizing residue. p-Bromophenacyl bromide modifies 0.5 mol of histidine/mol of enzyme as judged by amino acid analysis and incorporation studies with 14C-labeled reagent. The rate of inactivation is affected by various cations; a saturating concentration of Ca2+ decreases the rate 5-fold, while Mn2+ increases the rate by a factor of 2. Triton X-100, which by itself has little affinity for the enzyme, protects against inactivation, presumably by sequestering p-bromophenacyl bromide into the apolar micellar core. The mixed micelle system of Triton X-100, dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine, and Ba2+ offers the best protection, lowering the inactivation rate by at least 50-fold. This suggests an active site role for the histidine residue. Ethoxyformic anhydride also modifies phospholipase A2, by acylation of the two amino groups, a tyrosine, and 0.5 mol of histidine/mol of enzyme without totally inactivating the enzyme. Removal of the ethoxyformyl group from the histidine does not reactivate the enzyme. Thus, modification of 0.5 mol of histidine with this reagent is not responsible for the 85% loss of activity seen. Ethoxyformylated enzyme, with 0.5 mol of acylated histidine/mol of enzyme, can be further inactivated by treatment with p-bromophenacyl bromide. The resulting derivative contains 0.4 mol of the 14C-labeled p-bromophenacyl group. Other modifiable groups do not show this half-residue reactivity. For example, oxidation of phospholipase A2 with N-bromosuccinimide leads to rapid destruction of 1.0 tryptophan residue and 5% residual activity. The results of these chemical modification experiments can be interpreted in terms of a model in which the active species of enzyme interacting with mixed micelles is a dimer (or possibly higher order aggregate). The dimer, though composed of identical subunits, is asymmetric; the histidine of one subunit is accessible to ethoxyformic anhydride, while the other histidine is near a hydrophobic region of the enzyme and is chemically reactive toward p-bromophenacyl bromide."
https://openalex.org/W1503187265,"gamma-Glutamylcysteine synthetase was purified from rat liver by an improved method involving chromatography on Sepharose-aminohexyl-ATP to a specific activity of about 1600 units/mg, or approximately twice that previously obtained; it is thus the most active preparation of this enzyme thus far isolated. The earlier preparation, which is homogeneous on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, exhibits half of the sites reactivity in that it binds a maximum of 0.5 mol of the inhibitor L-methionine-S-sulfoximine phosphate per mol of enzyme. In contrast, the present enzyme preparation binds 1 mol of methionine sulfoximine phosphate per mol of enzyme; it also differs from the enzyme obtained earlier in exhibiting much less ATPase activity and less activity in catalyzing ATP-dependent cyclization of glutamate. gamma-Glutamylcysteine synthetase dissociates in sodium dodecyl sulfate into two nonidentical subunits of apparent molecular weights 74,000 and 24,000; after cross-linking with dimethyl-suberimidate, a species having a molecular weight of about 100,000 was found on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. New information has been obtained about the interaction of the enzyme with glutamate analogs; thus, the enzyme is active with such glutamate analogs as beta-glutamate, N-methyl-L-glutamate, and threo-beta-hydroxy-L-glutanate, and it is effectively inhibited by cis-1-amino-1,3-dicarboxycyclonexane, 2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate, and gamma-methylglutamate."
https://openalex.org/W1903421783,"Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (Rbu-P2) carboxylase isolated from Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides 2.4.1.Ga was separated into two different forms by DEAE-cellulose column chromatography. Both forms, designated Peak I and Peak II have been purified to homogeneity by the criterion of polyacrylamide disc-gel electrophoresis. The Peak I carboxylase has a molecular weight of 550,000, while the Peak II carboxylase is a smaller protein having a molecular weight of approximately 360,000. Sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis revealed a large subunit for both enzymes which migrates similarly to the large subunit of spinach Rbu-P2 carboxylase. The Peak I enzyme also exhibited a small subunit having a molecular weight of 11,000. No evidence for a smaller polypeptide was found associated with the Peak II enzyme. Antisera prepared against the Peak I enzyme inhibited Peak I enzymatic activity, but had no effect on the activity of the Peak II enzyme. The two enzymes exhibited marked differences in catalytic properties. The Peak I enzyme exhibits optimal activity at pH 8.0 and is inhibited by low concentrations of 6-phosphogluconate, while the Peak II enzyme has a pH optimum of 7.2 and is relatively insensitive to 6-phosphogluconate."
https://openalex.org/W1555191688,"A small endodeoxyribonuclease )2.3 S) that is active on single-stranded DNA has been extensively purified from Escherichia coli so as to be free of other known DNases. It has an alkaline pH optimum (9.5), requires Mg2+, and makes 3'-hydroxy and 5'-phosphate termini. The nuclease nicks duplex DNA, particularly if treated with OsO4, irradiated with ultraviolet light, or exposed to pH 5. The uracil-containing duplex DNA from the Bacillus subtilis phage PBS-2 is an especially good substrate; it is made acid-soluble by levels of the enzyme which fail to produce any acid-soluble material in other single-stranded or duplex DNAs. Neither RNA nor RNA-DNA hybrid are degraded by the enzyme. The enzyme specificity suggests that it might act at abnormal regions in DNA, so that its in vivo function could be to initiate an excision repair sequence. Its high activity on uracil-containing DNA could imply that the enzyme provides an alternative mechanism for excising uracil residues from DNA to the pathway utilizing uracil-DNA N-glycosidase. We suggest that this enzyme be designated as endonuclease V of E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1601754561,"1. The steady state kinetics for the oxidation of ferrocytochrome c by yeast cytochrome c peroxidase are biphasic under most conditions. The same biphasic kinetics were observed for yeast iso-1, yeast iso-2, horse, tuna, and cicada cytochromes c. On changing ionic strength, buffer anions, and pH, the apparent Km values for the initial phase (Km1) varied relatively little while the corresponding apparent maximal velocities varied over a much larger range. 2. The highest apparent Vmax1 for horse cytochrome c is attained at relatively low pH (congruent to 6.0) and low ionic strength (congruent to 0.05), while maximal activity for the yeast protein is at higher pH (congruent to 7.0) and higher ionic strength (congruent to 0.2), with some variations depending on the nature of the buffering ions. 3. Direct binding studies showed that cytochrome c binds to two sites on the peroxidase, under conditions that give biphasic kinetics. Under those ionic conditions that yield monophasic kinetics, binding occurred at only one site. At the optimal buffer concentrations for both yeast and horse cytochromes c, the KD1 and KD2 values approximate the Km1 and Km2 values. At ionic strengths below optimal, binding becomes too strong and above optimal, too weak. 4. Under ionic conditions that are optimal and give monophasic kinetics with horse cytochrome c but are suboptimal for the yeast protein, yeast cytochrome c strongly inhibits the reaction of horse cytochrome c with peroxidase, uncompetitively at one site and competitively at a second site. The appearance of the second site under monophasic conditions is interpreted as an allosteric effect of the inhibitor binding to the first site. 5. The simplest model accounting for these observations postulates two kinetically active sites on each molecule of peroxidase, a high affinity and a low affinity site, that may correspond to the free radical and the heme iron (IV) of the oxidized enzyme, respectively. Both oxidizing equivalents may be discharged at either site. Furthermore, the enzyme appears to exist as an equilibrium mixture of a high ionic strength form, EH and a low ionic strength form, EL, the former reacting optimally with yeast cytochrome c, and the latter with horse cytochrome c."
https://openalex.org/W1552421156,"Guanylate cyclase from human platelets was over 90% soluble, even when assayed in the presence of Triton X-100. A time-dependent increase in activity occurred when the enzyme was incubated at 37 degrees and this spontaneous activation was prevented by dithiothreitol. Arachidonic acid stimulated the soluble enzyme activity approximately 2- to 3-fold. Linear double reciprocal plots of guanylate cyclase activation as a function of arachidonic acid concentration were obtained with a Ka value of 2.1 muM. A Hill coefficient of 0.98 was obtained indicating that one fatty acid binding site is present for each catalytic site. Concentrations of arachidonic acid in excess of 10 muM caused less than maximal stimulation. Dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid and two polyunsaturated 22 carbon fatty acids stimulated the activity of guanylate cyclase to the same degree as did arachidonic acid. The methyl ester of arachidonic acid was much less effective. Diene, monoene, and saturated fatty acids of various carbon chain lengths as well as prostaglandins E1, E2, and F2alpha, had little or no effect. These data indicate that the structural determined required for stimulation by fatty acids of soluble platelet guanylate cyclase is a 1,4,7-octatriene group with its first double bond in the omega6 position. This structural group is similar to the substrate specificity determinants of fatty acid cyclooxygenase, the first enzyme of the prostaglandin synthetase complex. However, conversion of arachidonic acid to a metabolite of the cyclooxygenase pathway did not appear to be required for activation of the cyclase since activation occurred in the 105,000 X g supernatant fraction and pretreatment of this fraction with aspirin did not alter the ability of arachidonic acid to activate guanylate cyclase. Kinetic studies showed that the stimulation of guanylate cyclase by arachidonic acid is primarily an effect on maximal velocity. Arachidonic acid did not alter the concentration of free Mn2+ required for optimal activity. It is concluded that the activity of the soluble form of guanylate cyclase in cell-free preparations of human platelets can be increased by a lipid-protein interaction involving specific polyunsaturated fatty acids."
https://openalex.org/W1549634513,"Treatment of rat liver sulfite oxidase with trypsin leads to loss of ability to oxidize sulfite in the presence of cytochrome c as electron acceptor. Ability to oxidize sulfite with ferricyanide as acceptor is undiminished, while sulfite leads to O2 activity is partially retained. Gel filtration of the proteolytic products has led to the isolation of two major fragments of dissimilar size derived from sulfite oxidase. The smaller fragment has a molecular weight of 9500 and appears to be monomeric when detached from sulfite oxidase. It contains the heme in its cytochrome b5 structure, has no sulfite oxidase activity, and is reducible with dithionite but not with sulfite. The heme fragment can mediate electron transfer between pig liver microsomal NADH cytochrome b5 reductase and cytochrome c. The larger fragment has a molecular weight of 47,400 under denaturing conditions but elutes from Sephadex G-200 as a dimer. It contains no heme but retains all of the molybdenum and the modified sulfite-oxidizing capacity present in the proteolytic mixture. All of the EPR properties of the molybdenum center of native sulfite oxidase are retained in the molybdenum fragment. The molybdenum center is a weak chromophore with an absorption sectrum suggestive of coordination with sulfur ligands. Reduction by sulfite generates a spectrum attributable to molybdenum (V). Spectra of oxidized and sulfite-reduced preparations are sensitive to anions and pH. NH2-terminal analysis of native sulfite oxidase and the two tryptic fragments has permitted the conclusion that the sequence represented by the heme fragment is the NH2 terminus of native enzyme. These studies have demonstrated that the two cofactor moieties of sulfite oxidase are contained in distinct domains which are covalently held in contiguity by means of an exposed hinge region. Isolation of functional heme and molybdenum domains of sulfite oxidase after tryptic cleavage has demonstrated conclusively that the cytochrome b5 region of the molecule is required for electron transfer to the physiological acceptor, cytochrome c."
https://openalex.org/W1211576372,"A procedure is described for the purification of the elastase and chymotrypsin-like enzymes from purulent sputum. This procedure permitted the isolation of 132 mg and 120 mg of the elastase and chymotrypsin-like enzymes, respectively, from 230 g of purulent sputum. The elastase enzymes consist of a family of five isozymes, and at least three isozymes comprise the chymotrypsin-like enzyme system. The elastases proved to be immunologically identical with the corresponding enzyme of human leukocytes. These enzymes were characterized with respect to molecular weight, amino acid and carbohydrate composition, several kinetic parameters, and inhibition by various synthetic and natural inhibitors. The properties so found were comparable to those which had been previously reported by others for the elastase and chymotrypsin-like enzymes isolated directly from leukocytic granules."
https://openalex.org/W1565159790,"The effects of monovalent cations on calcium uptake by fragmented sarcoplasmic reticulum have been clarified. Homogenization of muscle tissue in salt-containing solutions leads to contamination of this subcellular fraction with actomyosin and mitochondrial membranes. When, in addition, inorganic cations are contributed by the microsomal suspension and in association with nucleotide triphosphate substrates there is an apparent inhibition of the calcium transport system by potassium and other cations. However, when purified preparations were obtained after homogenization in sucrose medium followed by centrifugation on a sucrose density gradient in a zonal rotor, calcium uptake and the associated adenosine triphosphatase activity were considerably activated by potassium and other univalent cations. When plotted against the log of the free calcium concentration there was only a slight increase in calcium uptake and ATPase activity in the absence of potassium ions but sigmoid-shaped curves were obtained in 100 mM K+ with half-maximal stimulation occurring at 2 muM Ca2+ for both calcium uptake and ATPase activity. The augmentation in calcium uptake was not due to an ionic strength effect as Tris cation at pH 6.6 was shown to be inactive in this respect. Other monovalent cations were effective in the order K+ greater than Na+ greater than NH4+=Rb+=Cs+ greater than Li+ with half-maximal stimulation in 11 mM K+, 16 mM Na+, 25 mM NH4+, Rb+, and Cs+ and in 50 mM Li+. There was nos synergistic action between K+ AND Na+ ions and both calcium uptak and associated ATPase were insensitive to ouabain. Thallous ions stimulate many K+-requiring enzymes and at one-tenth the concentration were nearly as effective as K+ ions in promoting calcium uptake. The ratio of Ca2+ ions transported to P1 released remained unchanged at 2 after addition of K+ ions indicating an effect on the rate of calcium uptake rather than an increased efficiency of uptake. In support of this it was found that during the stimulation of calcium uptake by Na+ ions there was a reduction in the steady state concentration of phosphorylated intermediate formed from [gamma-32P]ATP. It is considered that there is a physiological requirement for potassium ions in the relaxation process."
https://openalex.org/W1507443244,"Methyl 4-azidobenzoimidate, a photosensitive hetero-bifunctional cross-linking reagent, was synthesized and characterized. This reagent has an imidoester at one end, which reacts spontaneously with primary amines, and an arylazide at the other end, which reacts with a variety of chemical groups upon photolysis by ultraviolet radiation. The reagent molecules were attached to concanavalin A by reactions between imidoester groups of the reagents and free amino groups of the lectin. These activated lectins were purified on a Sephadex G-25 column and showed the binding affinity to an affinity column, glucosylated Sepharose, and to the human erythrocyte ghost membrane. The activated lectins were incubated with the membranes and then unbound lectins were removed by washing. The lectins bound to receptors in the membranes were irradiated with a shortwave ultraviolet lamp to photolyze arylazides attached to the lectins, thus cross-linking the lectins and receptors together. Then the membranes were solubilized and electrophoresed. On gels, the intensity of the lectin receptor band diminished slightly and concomitantly a new band of a higher molecular weight appeared. When 125I-labeled concanavalin A was used, the new band contained the radioactivity. The extent of the appearance of the new band and the decrease of the receptor band were reduced significantly when the ultraviolet irradiation was omitted or the activated lectins were incubated with the membranes in the presence of the lectin inhibitor, alpha-methylmannoside. The irradiation of nonactivated, receptor-bound concanavalin A did not cause those changes. When the activated lectins alone were irradiated with ultraviolet, the band of the lectin dimer appeared whereas nonirradiated lectins appeared mostly as monomers. It is concluded that a small fraction of the activated lectins were cross-linked to receptors in the membrane upon photolysis. In this study, only 8 reagent molecules were attached to a tetramer of the lectin, compared with the presence of approximately 40 available free amino groups. The efficiency of such cross-links of ligands to receptors may be increased by employing longer versions of the hetero-bifunctional cross-linking reagents and also by attaching more of the reagent molecule to ligands."
https://openalex.org/W1549043646,Inbred mice bearing certain alleles at the Mottled locus have defects in connective tissue which result in weakness of skin and of blood vessels. Previous studies have established that cross-links in collagen and elastin are decreased in these animals due to impaired formation of lysine-derived aldehydes. Lysyl oxidase activity in extracts of skin is markedly lower in those prepared from affected animals than control mice. An inhibitor of lysyl oxidase is present in equal amounts in affected and control skins and does not account for diminished activity found in affected animals.

The vesicles display various characteristic properties of anion permeation closely resembling those of the native system. The properties include energy of activation, pH dependence, anion sleectivity, sensitivity to specific inhibitors, and exchange and net rates of sulfate transport. Based on these and other criteria, the functional properties of isolated vesicles could be equated with those of the intact cell system. Direct support for the involvement of 95,000-dalton polypeptides in permeation functions is provided."

https://openalex.org/W1545352215,"Formation of bilirubin monoglucuronide from unconjugated bilirubin requires a microsomal enzyme, UDP-glucuronate glucuronyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.17). Conversion of bilirubin monoglucuronide to bilirubin diglucuronide, the major bilirubin conjugate in bile, was studied in subcellular fractions of rat liver. The highest specific activity for bilirubin diglucuronide formation occurred in a fraction highly enriched in plasma membranes. Studies of reaction stoichiometry and utilization of UDP-D-[14C]glucuronic acid revealed that conversion of bilirubin monoglucuronide to bilirubin diglucuronide is not catalyzed by UDP-glucuronyltransferase, and results from transglucuronidation of bilirubin monoglucuronide, with formation of bilirubin diglucuronide and unconjugated bilirubin. When unconjugated bilirubin was infused intravenously into rats at rates exceeding the maximal hepatic excretory capacity, bilirubin monoglucuronide accumulated in serum and bilirubin diglucuronide was found exclusively in bile as the predominant bilirubin metabolite. These results suggest that formation of bilirubin diglucuronide occurs at the surface membrane of the liver cell. Conversion of bilirubin monoglucuronide to bilirubin diglucuronide may play a role in the transport of bilirubin glucuronides from liver to bile."
https://openalex.org/W1593086337,"Six chromatographically distinct forms of endonuclease active on apurinic and apyrimidinic sites in DNA have been purified away from DNA phosphatases, DNA N-glycosidases, and other DNases of human placenta. The forms seem to be monomeric proteins of 27,000 to 31,000 daltons, and although catalytically similar, they can be distinguished from one another on the basis of substrate Km and the effects of small molecules such as ATP. Analysis of enzymatic activity on a spectrum of damaged DNA substrates indicates that the enzyme forms probably act at an appreciable rate only adjacent to the phosphodiester bond of a deoxyribose lacking a base (purine or pyrimidine) in duplex DNA; such sites can be formed by treating the DNA with acid, alkylating agents, DNA N-glycosidases, and, probably, x-rays and OsO4. The incision is made so as to form a deoxyribose 5'-phosphate and a 3'-hydroxynucleotide."
https://openalex.org/W1598412679,"Purified rat liver albumin mRNA directed the synthesis of albumin in a mRNA-dependent cell-free protein-synthesizing system derived from wheat germ extracts. The [3H]leucine-labeled in vitro translation product reacted with antibodies specific for albumin and co-migrated with authentic 14C-labeled serum albumin during gel electrophoresis in the presence or absence of sodium dodecyl sufate. Higher concentrations of potassium and magnesium ions were required for the translation of albumin mRNA than for total liver mRNAs. These requirements were consistent for the purified albumin as well as when it was a component in the liver mRNA mixture. At the higher potassium or magnesium concentrations, only intact albumin molecules were synthesized, whereas lower concentrations of these ions caused the production of antibody-reactive fragments. These fragments were apparently the result of premature termination of peptide synthesis and not due to endogenous proteolytic activity."

Aldehyde reductase I (AR I) appears in the effluent, while aldehyde reductase II (AR II) is eluted with a salt gradient. By several procedures AR II was purified over 1100-fold from liver supernatant fraction, but AR I could be pruified only 107-fold because of its instability. The two enzymes are different in regard to pH optimum, substrate specificity, response to inhibitors, and reactivity with antibody to AR II. While both enzymes utilize aromatic aldehydes well, only AR II ACTS ON D-glucuronate, indicating that it is the aldyhyde reductase recently reported to be identical to NADP-L-gulonate dehydrogenase. The presence of two NADP-linked aldehyde reductases in liver has apparently not heretofore been reported."
https://openalex.org/W1513122208,"Acetyl-CoA reacts stoichiometrically with a cysteinyl sufhydryl group of avian liver 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA synthase to yield acetyl-S-enzyme (Miziorko H.M., Clinkenbeard, K.D., Reed, W.D., and Lane, M.D. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 5768-5773). Evidence that acetyl-S-enzyme condenses with the second substrate, acetoacetyl CoA, to form enzyme-S-HMG-SCoA has been obtained by trapping and characterizing this putative intermediate. [14C]Acetyl-S-enzyme was incubated briefly at -25 degrees with acetoacetyl-CoA, precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and the labeled acylated enzyme species were isolated. Performic acid oxidation of the precipitated [14C]acyl-S-enzyme intermediates produced volatile [14C]acetic acid from unreacted [14C]acetyl-S-enzyme and nonvolatile [14C]3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaric acid from enzyme-S-[14C]HMG-SCoA. Condensation of unlabeled acetyl-S-enzyme with [14C]aceto-acetyl-CoA or acetoacetyl-[3H]CoA also produced labeled enzyme-S-HMG-SCoA. Thus, the acetyl moiety from acetyl-CoA and the acetoacetyl and CoA moieties from acetoacetyl-CoA all are incorporated into the HMG-CoA which is covalently-linked to the enzyme. Enzyme-S-[14C]HMG-SCoA was subjected to proteolytic digestion under conditions favorable for intramolecular S to N acyl transfer in the predicted cysteine-S-[14C]HMG-SCoA fragment. Performic acid oxidation of the protease-digested material yields N-[14C]HMG-cysteic acid indicating that HMG-CoA had been covalently bound to the enzyme via the -SH of an active site cysteine. An isotope trapping technique was employed to test the kinetic competence of acetyl-S-enzyme as an intermediate in the HMG-CoA synthase-catalyzed reaction. Evidence is presented which indicates that the rate of condensation of acetoacetyl-CoA with acetyl-S-enzyme to form enzyme-S-HMG-SCoA is more rapid than either the acetylation of the synthase by acetyl-CoA or the overall forward reaction leading to HMG-CoA. These observations, together with indirect evidence that hydrolysis of enzyme-S-HMG-SCoA is extremely rapid, suggest that acetylation of synthase is the rate-limiting step in HMG-CoA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1530283587,"Galactokinase (EC 2.7.1.6; ATP:D-galactose-1-phosphotransferase) was purified to homogeneity with a 50% yield from cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae which were fully induced for the production of the galactose metabolizing enzymes. The purification was accomplished by:(a) ammonium sulfate fractionation, (b) streptomycin sulfate precipitation. (c) DEAE-cellulose chromatography, (d) hydroxylapatite chromatography, and finally (e) Bio-Gel A-0.5 m gel filtration. The resulting preparation of galactokinase was judged to be at least 95% pure by the following criteria: (a) sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, (b) ultracentrifuge analysis, (c) nondissociating polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and (d) Bio-Gel A-0.5 m gel filtration. The purified enzyme preparation was used to determine the Km values for the two substrates, galactose and ATP, which were found to be 0.60 and 0.15 mM, respectively. Vmax was also determined and found to be 3.35 mmol/h/mg. This corresponds to a turnover rate of 3350 molecules of galactose phosphorylated/min/enzyme molecule. The effect of pH on the galactokinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of galactose was determined; the results showed the pH optimum of the reaction to be in the range of pH 8.0 to 9.0. The enzyme is highly specific for galactose since galactokinase did not appear to phosphorylate any of the other sugars tested at a rate greater than 0.5% of the rate of galactose phosphorylation. Amino acid analysis was performed on the enzyme preparation and the results were used to calculate the partial specific volume (v) of 0.736. The NH2-terminal sequence was determined for the first 3 residues. The molecular weight and subunit composition were determined by ultracentrifugation and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under dissociating and nondissociating conditions. The data obtained indicated that galactokinase is a monomeric protein of molecular weight 58,000."
https://openalex.org/W1540984664,"Porcine A blood group-specific N-acetylgalactosaminyl-transferase required either Mn2+, Cd2+, or Zn2+ for activity and 2'-O-alpha-fucosylgalactosides as acceptor substrates. The presence of detergent stabilizes the enzyme but is not essential for catalysis. To obtain information about the kinetic mechanism of the transferase reaction, initial rate parameters have been determined using 2'-fucosyllactose or A--mucin as acceptors, and Mn2+ or Cd2+ as cosubstrates. 2'-Fucosyllactose is a competitive inhibitor with respect to A--mucin and a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine. UDP inhibits noncompetively with respect to acceptor; thus UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine or acceptor can bind to the transferase via an equilibrium random pathway. The transferase converts human O blood type erythrocytes of A blood types. After exhaustive glycosylation, 3 X 10(6) N-acetylgalactosaminyl residues were incorporated per cell. Gel electrophoretic analysis of the labeled erythrocyte membranes indicates that glycoproteins with apparents molecular weights from 30,000 to 100,000 have been glycosylated; glycolipids account for only 15% of the labeled material, although pure H-glycolipid is a good acceptor. The transferase, with its strict acceptor specificity, can thus be used as a tool to study the biosynthesis and function of glycolipids and glycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1530389146,"The effects of acid on fragmented sarcoplasmic reticulum from rabbit white skeletal muscle have been studied. Brief exposure of sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes to pH values in the range 5.5 to 6.0 at 37 degrees caused rapid inactivation of calcium accumulation measured at 25 degrees in the presence of oxalate (calcium uptake) while (Ca2+, Mg2+)-ATPase (EC 3.6.1.3) activity was enhanced by 75%. ATPase activity, measured at 37 degrees in the absence of oxalate and in the calcium steady state, was unaltered when calcium uptake was inactivated. Calcium efflux from sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles, previously loaded passibely with 45CaCl2, was only slightly increased when calcium uptake was abolished. At still lower pH values, 5.0 to 5.5, (Ca2+, Mg2+)-ATPase was inactivated while Mg2+ ATPase was more acid-resistant. Acid inactivation of calcium uptake followed simple first order kinetics for at least 80% of the time course. The rate constant, k, increased from 0.043 min-1 to 1.63 min-1 between pH 6.50 and pH 5.35. At pH 4.65, Ea, the energy of activation, was 31 kcal mol-1 between 24 degrees and 43 degrees. Inactivation, once initiated, was irreversible. Aged suspensions of sarcoplasmic reticulum were more sensitive to acid inactivation. Ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)N,N'-tetraacetic acid enhanced inactivation, and calcium specifically protected against inactivation with half-maximal effect at 1 to 2 mM. The sulfhydryl reagent, dithiothreitol (1 mM), caused significantly increased rates of inactivation. Calcium binding was studied by dual wavelength spectrophotometry and stopped flow analysis. Acid inactivation distinguished two ATP-induced binding sites, previously described (Entman, M. L., Snow, T. R., Freed, D., and Schwartz, A. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 7762-7772) as a superficial Mg2+-independent Site A which binds and releases calcium rapidly and a deeper Mg2+-dependent Site B which binds and releases calcium more slowly. Rates of binding to both sites were decreased by acid inactivation. Binding of calcium to Site A increased, however, from 4.6 to 6.4 nmol mg of protein-1 whereas that to Site B decreased from 17.0 to 6.9 nmol mg of protein-1. Passive binding of calcium to sites of medium affinity (K = 7 X 10(4) M-1) was unaffected by acid inactivation of calcium uptake. Temperature dependence of (Ca2+, Mg2+)-ATPase was unchanged in the range 9-34 degrees. Above 34 degrees, the higher activation energy process (Ealpha = 33.7 kcal mol-1) observed in control sarcoplasmic reticulum and thought to arise from a conformational change in the ATPase (Inesi, G., Millman, M., and Eletr, S. (1973) J. Mol. Biol. 81, 483-504) was diminished by acid inactivation (Ealpha = 8.2 kcal mol-1) in a manner suggesting that it is related to active calcium transport. The ATP in equilibrium 32Pi exchange reaction was diminished by acid, but 25% of the activity remained when calcium uptake was completely abolished..."
https://openalex.org/W1529082646,"The principal component of normal adult human hemoglobin was equilibrated under various conditions with 13CO2. Quantitative analysis of the carbamino resonance intensities over the pH range of 6.5 to 9.0 shows that the effects of conversion from the deoxy to the liganded state in reducing the carbamino adduct formation occur predominantly at Val-1beta. Analysis of the pH dependence of carbamino formation at constant total carbonates yields values of pKz and pKc for Val-1beta and Val-1alpha in the deoxy and liganded conditions. In contrast to the Val-1beta as the allosteric site for CO2, the Val-1alpha site is shown to be primarily an alkaline Bohr group. 2,3-Diphosphoglycerate is shown to reduce substantially the Val-1beta carbamino resonance intensity in deoxyhemoglobin. Evidence for 2,3-diphosphoglycerate effects in carbon monoxide hemoglobin at both Val-1alpha and Val-1beta sites is presented. Enhanced carbamino formation in carbon monoxide hemoglobin at Val-1beta is observed at pH values less than 7.8. Finally, chemical exchange analysis of the spectra shows the release rate of the deoxy Val-1alpha carbamino adduct to be greater than that for deoxy Val-1beta. At pH 7.47 k-1obs,beta congruent to 1.0 and k-1obs, alpha congruent to 11.0 s-1."

https://openalex.org/W1860861903,"In previous studies it was found that: (a) aspartate aminotransferase increases the aspartate dehydrogenase activity of glutamate dehydrogenase; (b) the pyridoxamine-P form of this aminotransferase can form an enzyme-enzyme complex with glutamate dehydrogenase; and (c) the pyridoxamine-P form can be dehydrogenated to the pyridoxal-P form by glutamate dehydrogenase. It was therefore concluded (Fahien, L.A., and Smith, S.E. (1974) J. Biol. Chem 249, 2696-2703) that in the aspartate dehydrogenase reaction, aspartate converts the aminotransferase into the pyridoxamine-P form which is then dehydrogenated by glutamate dehydrogenase. The present results support this mechanism and essentially exclude the possibility that aspartate actually reacts with glutamate dehydrogenase and the aminotransferase is an allosteric activator. Indeed, it was found that aspartate is actually an activator of the reaction between glutamate dehydrogenase and the pyridoxamine-P form of the aminotransferase. Aspartate also markedly activated the alanine dehydrogenase reaction catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase plus alanine aminotransferase and the ornithine dehydrogenase reaction catalyzed by ornithine aminotransferase plus glutamate dehydrogenase. In these latter two reactions, there is no significant conversion of aspartate to oxalecetate and other compounds tested (including oxalacetate) would not substitute for aspartate. Thus aspartate is apparently bound to glutamate dehydrogenase and this increases the reactivity of this enzyme with the pyridoxamine-P form of aminotransferases. This could be of physiological importance because aspartate enables the aspartate and ornithine dehydrogenase reactions to be catalyzed almost as rapidly by complexes between glutamate dehydrogenase and the appropriate mitochondrial aminotransferase in the absence of alpha-ketoglutarate as they are in the presence of this substrate. Furthermore, in the presence of aspartate, alpha-ketoglutarate can have little or no affect on these reactions. Consequently, in the mitochondria of some organs these reactions could be catalyzed exclusively by enzyme-enzyme complexes even in the presence of alpha-ketoglutarate. Rat liver glutamate dehydrogenase is essentially as active as thebovine liver enzyme with aminotransferases. Since the rat liver enzyme does not polymerize, this unambiguously demonstrates that monomeric forms of glutamate dehydrogenase can react with aminotransferases."
https://openalex.org/W1508444480,"Investigations on the cholic acid CoA ligase activity of rat liver microsomes were made possible by the development of a rapid, sensitive radiochemical assay based on the conversion of [3H]choloyl-CoA. More than 70% of the rat liver cholic acid CoA ligase activity was associated with the microsomal subcellular fraction. The dependencies of cholic acid CoA ligase activity on pH, ATP, CoA, Triton WR-1339, acetone, ethanol, magnesium, and salts were investigated. The hypothesis that the long chain fatty acid CoA ligase activity and the cholic acid CoA ligase activity are catalyzed by a single microsomal enzyme was investigated. The ATP, CoA, and cholic (palmitic) acid kinetics neither supported nor negated the hypothesis. Cholic acid was not an inhibitor of the fatty acid CoA ligase and palmitic acid was not a competitive inhibitor of the cholic acid CoA ligase. The cholic acid CoA ligase activity utilized dATP as a substrate more effectively than did the fatty acid CoA ligase activity. The cholic acid and fatty acid CoA ligase activities appeared to have different pH dependencies, differed in thermolability at 41 degrees, and were differentially inactivated by phospholipase C. Moreover, fatty acid CoA ligase activity was present in microsomal fractions from all rat organs tested while cholic acid CoA ligase activity was detected only in liver microsomes. The data suggest that separate microsomal enzymes are responsible for the cholic acid and the fatty acid CoA ligase activities in liver."
https://openalex.org/W1517816206,"Indolyl-3-alkane alpha-hydroxylase, a novel tryptophan-metabolizing enzyme, was prepared in crystalline form from soil isolate organism Pseudomonas XA. Emission spectroscopy and atomic absorption analyses of purified enzyme revealed the presence of iron (0.8 mol/mol of protein), and a number of observations supported the presence of heme prosthetic group (1.1 mol/mol of protein). The S20,w value of indolyl-3-alkane alpha-hydroxylase is 10.2 S, and the molecular weight by sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation is 250,000. The E1%280 of the enzyme is 21, and the isoelectric point by isoelectric focusing on ampholine polyacrylamide gel plates is 4.8. The enzyme catalyzes hydroxylation on the side chain of a variety of 3-substituted indole compounds, including certain tryptophan-containing oligopeptides. The reaction product from tryptamine was identified by proton nuclear magnetic resonance and gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy analyses. While the indole ring remained intact, hydroxylation occurred at the side chain carbon adjacent to the ring. Nuclear magnetic resonance studies indicated that hydroxylation always took place at the same position when the substrate was tryptophan methyl ester, tryptophol, indole-3-propionate, or indole-3-butyrate. No other chemical change occurred when these substrates were incubated with the enzyme. The Km value of indolyl-3-alkane alpha-hydroxylase for L-tryptophan is 2.4 X 10(-6) M, at pH 7.2. The enzyme is inhibited by potassium cyanide (0.1 mM) or hydroxylamine (1mM), but not by NaBH4 (25 mM), aminooxyacetic acid (7mM), quinacrine (1 mM), chlortetracycline (1 mM), p-mercuribenzoate (0.1 mM), or ethylenediaminetetraacetate (1 mM).

Chemical shift considerations, the effect of pH, and partially relaxed Fourier transform NMR spectra are used to assign each resonance to one of the seven types of nonprotonated aromatic carbons of amino acid residues. Spectra of chemically modified lysozyme samples yield various assignments to specific residues in the sequence. Line-broadening effects caused by binding of the relaxation probes Gd3+ and 4-N-acetamido-2,2,6,6-tetramethylipiperidine-1-oxyl yield specific assignments which are fully consistent with those based on chemical modifications. The effects of paramagnetic shift reagents and amino sugar inhibitors do not yield any obvious specific assignments. The effect of pH on the chemical shift of Cgamma of His-15 yields a pKalpha in agreement with published values, and indicates that the imidazole form of His-15 exists mainly (or entirely) as the Nepsilon3-H tautomer. The effect of pH on the chemical shifts (measured up to pH 8.8, at 38 degrees) of Czeta and Cgamma of the 3 tyrosine residues yields crude pKalpha values of 9.5 and 10 for Tyr-23 and one of the other tyrosines, respectively.

The molecular weight estimated by gel filtration was approximately 280,000 and sedimentation coefficient (S20,w) was 11 by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. The absorption spectra indicated that the enzyme was a hemoprotein. The purified enzyme was shown to catalyze the reaction in which 1 mol each of NH3 and CO2 was formed at the expense of 1 mol each of L-tryptophan and molecular oxygen. Neither peroxidase nor catalase activity was detected in the purified enzyme and no formation of H2O2 was observed during the enzyme reaction. The product(s) of the reaction was unstable but was converted to and was identified as its stable quinoxaline derivative, 2-(3-indolyl)quinoxaline, in the presence of o-phenylenediamine. These results indicate that the product of the reaction was 3-indolylglycoaldehyde or 3-indolylglyoxal. A variety of other indole derivatives such as D-tryptophan, 5-hydroxyl-L-tryptophan, tryptamine, serotonin, melatonin, N-acetyl-L-tryptophan, N-acetyl-L-tryptophanamide, 3-indoleacetamide, 3-indolelactic acid, 3-indolepropionic acid, 3-indoleethanol, and skatole were also substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1502086237,"Concanavalin A added to intact cells at 37 degrees caused rapid and reversible inactivation of a soluble enzyme, tyrosine aminotransferase, in two lines of rat hepatoma tissue culture cells grown in monolayer culture. This temperature-dependent process was independent of de novo protein and RNA synthesis and independent of increased uptake of Ca2+ and Mg2+ or glucose. The inactivation could be reversed by adding alpha-methyl-D-mannopyranoside a competing sugar for concanavalin A binding. Other lectins known to bind to different sugars did not bring about the inactivation of tyrosine aminotransferase. Addition of concanavalin A did not result in the inactivation of another soluble enzyme, lactic dehydrogenase. The maintenance of tyrosine aminotransferase in an inactive form after the binding of concanavalin A to the cells required the continued presence of concanavalin A. This effect of concanavalin A could not be mimicked either by dibutyryl cyclic adenosine or guanosine monophosphoric acid. Incubation of cell extracts with concanavalin A did not result in inactivation nor did mixing of extracts from concanavalin A-treated cells with extracts from untreated cells. On the basis of these results we conclude that the following are the essential requirements for concanavalin A to bring about the inactivation of tyrosine aminotransferase: (a) the binding of native concanavalin A to the cells; (b) integrity of certain structural elements of the cells."

Step 3 is the hydride transfer. Under steady state conditions isomerization 2 is the rate-determining step in the direction of hydroxypyruvate-P reduction at higher pH values. At lower pH values, the hydride transfer step is also partially rate-determining. The rate-determining step in the direction of 3-phosphoglycerate oxidation occurs subsequent to the hydride transfer step at higher pH values. At lower pH values the rate is determined by both isomerization 4 and the hydride transfer step. Isomerizations 1, 2, and 4 were inhibited by serine, an allosteric inhibitor, indicating that the inactive conformation of the enzyme is incapable of performing any of the steps of the ternary complex interconversion. Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase corresponds to a V-type allosteric enzyme. When the enzyme-NADH complex was mixed with hydroxypyruvate-P at pH 8.5, a rapid quenching of enzymebound NADH fluorescence occurred. This process was studied under pseudo-first order conditions and shown to be the result of hydroxypyruvate-P binding."

Transcarboxylase as isolated previously has a molecular weight of 790,000, an s20,w of 18 S, and contains six biotinyl groups. The larger species of enzyme consists of a central hexameric subunit with six dimeric outer subunits attached to it by biotinyl carboxyl carrier proteins, three each at the opposite faces of the central subunits. This larger species is stable at pH 5.5, but dissociates to the 18 S species at pH values near neutrality with loss of a set of three of the outer subunits with two of the biotinyl carboxyl carrier proteins still attached to each of these subunits. The dissociation to the 18 S form occurs by several rapidly reversible steps and under certain conditions of centrifugation multiple peaks are observed as a consequence of the occurrence of different forms of enzyme with variable numbers of the outer subunits attached to the 18 S enzyme. The s20,w value of the so-called 26 S enzyme varies with conditions. Isolated 18 S enzyme has been combined with isolated outer subunits to form active 26 S enzyme. The newly enzyme is a normal form but has not been isolated previously because of its dissociation to the 18 S form at neutral pH. A procedure is described for the isolation of the 26 S form in a highly purified state. The molecular weight of the enzyme has been determined by high speed meniscus depletion. In addition, a procedure is described for dissociation of the 26 S form of the enzyme and isolation of the resulting outer subunits with the biotinyl subunits still attached to it. Evidence is presented that all six outer subunits participate in the enzymatic reaction which includes the demonstration that; (a) all 12 biotins of the 26 S form of the enzyme can be carboxylated with [3-14C]methylmalonyl coenzyme A; (b) there is an increase in enzymatic activity when the outer subunits are combined with the normal 18 S enzyme with formation of the 26 S enzyme; and (c) a 26 S form of the enzyme is active which is prepared by combination of inactive 18 S trypsin-treated transcarboxylase with the outer subunits. The trypsin-treated 18 S enzyme is inactive because trypsin removes the biotin as biotinyl peptides and the 26 S enzyme is active because of the second set of active outer subunits."

The effect of pH on the resonances of the nonprotonated aromatic carbons of 9 mM lysozyme, and the effect of protein concentration (at pH 7) on these resonances, both indicate that self-association significantly affects the chemical shift of Cgamma of Trp-62, but not the chemical shifts of the other nonprotonated aromatic carbons. This result is consistent with the reported participation of Trp-62 in the intermolecular contact (Banerjee, S.K., Pogolotti, A., and Rupley, J.A. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 8260-8266). Our results indicate that the resonance of Cgamma or Trp-62 is a convenient monitor of lysozyme self-association. The chemical shift of this resonance reflects the extent of aggregation, while the line width yields information about the lifetime of the intermolecular contact. This lifetime is 1 to 2 ms at 38 degrees (9 mM protein, 0.1 M NaCl, pH 7). Our results also indicate that self-association of lysozyme is not accompanied by any general conformational change, and that binding of a lanthanide ion (at the metal ion binding site near the carboxylate groups of ASP-52 AND Glu-35) strongly suppresses self-association."

These results suggest that the human enzyme has amino groups at the active sites, as was shown previously for the horse enzyme. The variant subunit occuring in the enzyme isolated from atypical human livers does not seem to be activated by acetimidylation, which may indicate that substitution of proline for Ala-230 or modifiction of Lys-228 is sufficient to fully activate the enzyme. Results of product inhibition studies of native and modified human enzymes are consistent with an Ordered Bi Bi mechanism. However, the major isoenzyme of native human liver alcohol, dehydrogenase exhibits nonlinear kinetics over a wide range of ethanol concentrations. This result may indicate that subunits with different kinetic characteristics are present or that there is negative cooperativity between subunits. After chemical modification, the kinetic patterns become linear, suggesting that the mechanism is altered."

Binding was concentration-dependent, saturable, and totally dissociable. Steady state was reached within 20 min at all calcium concentrations tested. Three apparent classes of binding sites were identified in kinetic and steady state studies using calcium concentrations from 1 muM to 10 mM. The affinity constants (and maximum binding capacities) as determined by computer analysis for the three classes were 2.1 X 10(5) M-1 (0.28 nmol of calcium/mg of protein), 1.3 X 10(4) M-1 (1.1 nmol/mg), and 1.3 X 10(2) M-1 (35 nmol/mg). The dissociation rate constants for the high and intermediate affinity classes of sites were 1.6 X 10(-3) S-1, respectively, and the association rate constant for the high affinity sites was 8 X 10(2) M-1 S-1. The affinity constant calculated from the rate constants was 5.0 X 10(5) M-1 for the high affinity sites in agreement with the value obtained in studies at steady state. The three classes of binding sites were specific for calcium. Magnesium was a noncompetitive inhibitor of calcium binding to all three classes of sites with a Ki of 9 to 12 mM. Calcium binding at 1 muM calcium was 50% inhibited by 18 muM La3+, 600 muM Sr2+, or 2.7 mM Ba2+. These data represent the first analysis of passive calcium binding to endoplasmic reticulum from nonmuscular cells and the first report of corresponding rate constants for either endoplasmic or sarcoplasmic reticulum. The characteristics of the binding are consistent with the properties of calcium transport by endoplasmic reticulum of adipocytes. The characteristics and specificity of the calcium binding constitute further evidence that endoplasmic reticulum plays an important role in cellular calcium homeostasis."

An intact form of porcine thyroid peroxidase was obtained by solubilization with the nonionic detergent Triton X-100 and two fragmented, hydrophilic forms of the enzyme were prepared by trypsin treatment of the membrane. The three types of thyroid peroxidase bind to Con A-agarose and can be eluted with alpha-methyl-D-mannoside. The alpha-methyl-D-mannoside eluate of the most purified thyroid peroxidase preparation has been analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Peroxidase activity corresponds with a glycoprotein band. The binding of thyroid peroxidase to Con A-agarose can be inhibited by sugars in the following order: alpha-methyl-D-mannoside greater than D-mannose greater than alpha-methyl-D-glucoside greater than D-glucose greater than D-galactose. This order of specificity is typical of Con A-sugar interactions. Furthermore, inactivation of the carbohydrate binding site of Con A by demetallization greatly reduces the extent of thyroid peroxidase binding. Reactivation of the carbohydrate binding site by the addition of Ca2+ and Mn2+ to demetallized Con A-agarose restores thyroid peroxidase binding. These and other experiments suggest that htyroid peroxidase is, like several other peroxidases, a glycoprotein. In addition, the interaction between thyroid peroxidase and Con A-agarose may provide a new purification tool for thyroid peroxidase."

Electron withdrawal in the leaving group accelerates the rate of acylation, and the p value obtained for eight esters is +1.96. The pH- and pD-independent acylation rate constants are, respectively, 1.40 X 10(4) M-1S-1 and 1.23 X 10(4) M-1S-1 for p-nitrophenyl p-nitrobenzoate, and, respectively, 2.19 X 10(3) M-1S-1 and 1968 X 10(3) M-1S-1 for p-nitrophenyl benzoate at 25 degrees. An analysis of structure-reactivity results and kinetic solvent isotope effects indicates a mechanism for acylation by phenylbenzoates in which initial reaction is a nucleophilic attack by an imidazole of the enzyme (His 57). Subsequently, there is rapid transfer of the acylating group to the serine 195 from the acylimidazole species. The kinetic solvent isotope effects for acylation by p-nitrophenyl phenyl acetate and p-nitrophenyl phenyl acetate and p-nitrophenyl hydrocinnamate, in 5%, v/v, acetonitrile, are 1.3 and 2.0, respectively. The latter ester is inhibited more than is p-nitrophenyl benzoate when 5%, v/v, dioxane is substituted for 5%, v/v, acetonitrile as co-solvent. In the presence of 5%, v/v, dioxane a change in the kinetic solvent isotope effect to 1.7 is found for p-nitrophenyl benzoate and p-nitrophenyl phenylacetate while that for the analogous hysdrocinnamate ester is unaffected. The results for the latter substrate are in accord with a general base-catalysed mechanism. Electron-withdrawal groups in the phenyl ring of phenyl acetates accelerate the enzyme acylation yielding a leaving group p of 2.05. The kinetic solvent isotope effects for acylation by p-nitrophenyl thiolacetate and by p-nitrophenyl acetate are close to 2.0.

https://openalex.org/W1556731725,"Abstract When lysozyme is reacted with 4-chloro-7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD-CL), A 1:1 covalent product is produced, in which the NBD group arylates the phenolic hydroxyl group of Tyr-23 (Aboderin, A. A., and Boedefeld, E. (1976) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 420, 177). Changing the pH from neutral to alkaline conditions results in a large spectral shift of the absorption band associated with the NBD chromophore (Aboderin, A. A., Boedefeld, E., and Luisi, P. L. (1973) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 328, 30). In the present work it is shown that this spectral change is due to the formation of a sigma complex in which a hydroxyl ion is added to the aromatic nucleus of the nitrobenzoxadiazole system. Circular dichroic studies suggest that the NBD group is held in a conformationally rigid state in the protein. The kinetics of the spectral change accompanying the formation of the sigma complex has been investigated with a rapid mixing stopped flow spectrophotometer both in the modified enzyme and in the low molecular weight model compounds N-acetyl-(O-NBD)-L-tyrosinamide and glycyl-(O-NBD)-L-tyrosine. In the pH range from 10.1 to 12.7, the time course of the reaction is first order in the case of the modified enzyme (k = 4.8 s-1) and bimolecular and much slower (under pseudo-first order conditions) in the low molecular weight compounds. It is suggested that in the enzyme the reaction proceeds much faster because of the hydrophobic environment around the reacting groups. It is further suggested that the unimolecularity in the enzyme is due to a rate-determining isomerization step, probably connected with a local rearrangement of the protein conformation following the ionization of Tyr-20."
https://openalex.org/W1547417698,"Nuclear magnetic relaxation methods were used to investigate the interaction of the inhibitor succinate with aspartate transcarbamylase from Escherichia coli. Over the pH range 7 to 9, the dissociation constant for succinate remains less than the inhibitor concentration used for most of this work (0.05 M). As a result, the enzyme predominantly exists in a single gross conformational state. Succinate binding to this enzyme state (generally known as the R form) parallels the behavior seen previously with the isolated catalytic subunit (Beard, C. B., and Schmidt, P.G. (1973) Biochemistry 12, 2255-2264). The pH and temperature dependence of succinate proton relaxation rates, 1/T2 - 1/T1, in the presence of carbamyl phosphate, is interpreted in terms of a binding mechanism involving three forms of the enzyme, differing by their states of protonation. The least protonated form of the enzyme does not interact with succinate, the singly protonated species binds succinate to form a rapidly dissociating complex, and the doubly protonated species undergoes a conformational isomerization upon succinate binding, yielding a slow exchange complex. Relaxation data provide sufficient information to determine pKa values of 7.2 and 8.9 for two ionizing groups, as well as the dissociation constant for succinate in the fast exchange complex, Kd =1.6 X 10(-2) M. Rate constants for the forward and reverse steps of the isomerization, 1.3 X 10(3) s-1 and 33 s-1, respectively, indicate a significantly slower reverse rate from that obtained in the earlier NMR study of the isolated catalytic subunit. In experiments where the succinate concentration was varied, the relaxation rates showed sigmoidal binding of that ligand to the fast exchange complex above pH 9.1, (a) indicating cooperative binding of succinate, and (b) suggesting that above pH 9.1, the system cannot be characterized by a single dissociation constant, ionization constant, or relaxation effect. CTP and ATP were tested for their ability to affect succinate binding to the fast exchange complex. Heterotropic interactions were observed for CTP but not for ATP. Addition of low concentrations of the transition state analog N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate to the enzyme-carbamyl phosphate-succinate complex sharply decreased the relaxation rate, indicating that the measurements are sensitive only to succinate bound specifically to the active site."
