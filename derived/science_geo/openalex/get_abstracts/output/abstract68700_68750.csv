https://openalex.org/W1997466867,There have been some questionable assertions relating to population growth. The most serious of these is the notion that the size and growth rate of the U.S. population are only minor contributors to this countrys adverse impact on local and global environment. The discussion in this article centers around 5 theorems which demonstrate the following: 1) population growth causes a disproportionate negative impact on the environment 2) the control of population is necessary but not sufficient means of seeing us through the whole crisis of environmental deterioration 3) population density is a poor measure of population pressure 4) environment as a term must be broadly construed to include physical environment of urban ghettos as well as the human behavioral environment and 5) theoratical solutions to out problems are not operational and some times are not solutions. The paper concludes that population control the redirection of technology the transition from open to closed resouce cycles the equitable distribution of opportunity and the ingredients of prosperity must all be accomplished if there is to be a future worth living.

Upon injection into rats, all of the desialylated plasma proteins tested, with the exception of transferrin, were promptly removed from the circulation and were recovered from the liver. The materials examined included orosomucoid, fetuin, ceruloplasmin, haptoglobin, α2-macroglobulin, thyroglobulin, lactoferrin, and the two gonadotropic hormones, human chorionic gonadotropin and follicle-stimulating hormone. Competitive inhibition of hepatic uptake was demonstrated by the injection of tracer amounts of 64Cu-ceruloplasmin together with substantive amounts of the above-mentioned desialylated proteins or the glycopeptides derived from them. Uptake was not inhibited by the fully sialylated protein or their glycopeptides."
https://openalex.org/W1506059949,"The structure of crystalline horse heart ferricytochrome c has been determined by x-ray methods to a resolution of 2.8 A, and the results have been extended to obtain the structure of bonito cytochrome c as well. There is no difference between the horse and bonito structures, other than the expected changes in side chains where the amino acid sequences differ. The tertiary folding of cytochrome c has been maintained constant since the ancestors of mammals and fish diverged 400 million years ago, and probably for much longer. The polypeptide chain of 104 amino acids is wrapped around the heme in two halves; residues 1 to 47 to the right and 48 to 91 to the left of the heme, which sits in the resultant heme crevice with one edge exposed to solvent. Residues 92 to 104 form an α helical strap that rises over the top rear of the molecule and back across the right side again. Cysteines 14 and 17 and histidine 18 extend to the heme from the right wall of the heme crevice, and methionine 80 extends from the left wall. The heme is tightly enveloped in hydrophobic groups. Two channels filled with hydrophobic side chains lead to the right and left from the heme to the surface of the molecule. Each channel contains at least two aromatic rings in roughly parallel orientation, and each channel is surrounded by a cluster of positively charged lysines where it meets the surface. At the back rear of the molecule, between the two positive regions, is a cluster of nine negatively charged acidic groups. It is proposed that these surface features may be involved in binding to other macromolecular complexes, including the cytochrome oxidase system. The principal folding influence on the molecule appears to be the heme group itself. Only residues 92 to 102 are genuinely α helical, although several other areas might have been were it not for interference from the heme. Methods currently proposed for predicting α helical regions are promising but insufficiently discriminating. The abrupt 310 bend, occasionally observed in other globular proteins, occurs six times in cytochrome c, at locations where a sharp chain reversal is needed in wrapping around the heme. The x-ray structure shows the reasons for many of the unchanging features apparent from comparison of amino acid sequences from over 30 different species. Hydrophobic groups are invariant because they play an essential role in providing the proper heme environment and causing the protein to fold around the heme. Acidic and basic chains are necessary for the preservation of segregated regions of charge on the surface. Glycines often occur where there is no room for a side chain, and serines and theronines play important hydrogen-bonding roles in maintaining the folding of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1599646613,"Abstract Tyrosine hydroxylase from bovine adrenal medulla has been solubilized and extensively purified. The catalytic properties of the solubilized, purified enzyme are similar to those of the particulate enzyme. The stoichiometry of the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme, as well as its regulatory properties, have been found to vary with different pterin cofactors. The enzyme, for example, is markedly inhibited by its substrate, tyrosine, in the presence of tetrahydrobiopterin, but not in the presence of 6,7-dimethyltetrahydropterin. Purified tyrosine hydroxylase is sensitive to H2O2 that is generated during the nonenzymatic oxidation of tetrahydropterin. The enzyme can be protected by catalase, peroxidase, or Fe2+ from H2O2-mediated inactivation. In the presence of catalase or peroxidase, Fe2+ does not stimulate the reaction. It is concluded that the previous reports that tyrosine hydroxylase is stimulated by Fe2+ can be explained by the known ability of Fe2+ to decompose H2O2"
https://openalex.org/W1576709265,"Abstract The activity of diphtheria toxin in catalyzing transfer of the adenosine diphosphate ribose moiety of NAD+ into covalent linkage with the mammalian peptidyl transfer RNA translocation factor, transferase II, is dependent upon exposure of the toxin to thiols. The toxin is almost completely inactive when assayed in the absence of thiols, but may be maximally activated by treatment with 50 mm dithiothreitol for 10 min. The activation process has been correlated with certain structural features of the toxin. Studies involving electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate have led us to conclude that toxin consists of a mixture of two similar proteins of molecular weight about 63,000. One consists of intact, 63,000-dalton polypeptide chains (intact toxin), while the other (nicked toxin) consists of two fragments of 24,000 and 39,000 daltons (A and B, respectively) linked by at least one disulfide bridge. Treatment of toxin with thiols results in dissociation of the latter into Fragments A and B. Fragment A is enzymically active, and probably accounts for all the activity of thiol-treated toxin. Fragment B is almost certainly devoid of activity for reasons which are discussed, although this has not been demonstrated experimentally. Intact toxin appears to be inactive before or after treatment with dithiothreitol. In the accompanying paper we show that intact toxin is a precursor of nicked toxin, and may be converted into the latter by treatment with trypsin."

https://openalex.org/W1637283425,"Abstract The Enzymes II of a bacterial phosphotransferase system are sugar-specific membrane components, most of which are inducible. The present studies are concerned with the constitutive Enzymes II of Escherichia coli. In the presence of purified Enzyme I and HPr of the phosphotransferase system, an E. coli membrane fraction catalyzed the transfer of phosphate from phosphoenolpyruvate to d-glucose, d-mannose, and d-fructose. Extraction of the membrane fraction with a mixture of urea and 1-butanol gave a protein fraction (II-A), which catalyzed the reaction only in the presence of the residual pellet. Fraction II-A was purified free of lipid, and subfractionated by isoelectric focusing to three proteins, each being required for phosphorylation of one of the sugars. The pellet was treated with deoxycholate and fractionated, giving another protein fraction (II-B) which was purified free of lipid. The combination of II-A and II-B was inactive in the phosphorylation reaction unless supplemented with divalent cation and with crude E. coli lipid. A minor component of crude E. coli lipid, phosphatidylglycerol, was found to be the active lipid factor. Thus, reconstitution of Enzyme II activity, specific for one of the three sugars, was effected by combining the corresponding specific II-A with II-B, phosphatidylglycerol, and either Ca++ or Mg++. However, activity was dependent upon the sequence of mixing of the four components. The activity of reconstituted Enzyme II was found in a sedimentable pellet. Further study of this phenomenon showed that II-B, phosphatidylglycerol, and divalent cation interacted to give a sedimentable pellet which catalyzed the phosphorylation of the sugars in the presence of II-A and the phospho-HPr generating system. Activity of the pellet was studied as a function of the concentration of phosphatidylglycerol added to the mixture, and the optimum was reached when all of the lipid sedimented with the protein; additional quantities of lipid gave less active pellets. At the optimum, the pellet contained II-B and lipid in a ratio of 1:1 (w/w). Each of the II-A proteins appeared homogeneous when examined by disc gel electrophoresis. Protein II-B, which showed a marked tendency to aggregate in the absence of detergent, was studied by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, and only one protein band was detected, its mobility corresponding to a molecular weight of about 36,000. If II-B is homogeneous it represents at least 10% of the protein in the membrane preparation."
https://openalex.org/W1587199142,"Most preparations of diphtheria toxin that we have examined consist predominantly of mixtures in various proportions of two proteins, each of molecular weight about 63,000. As judged by their electrophoretic behavior on polyacrylamide gels run in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, one of these consists of intact 63,000-dalton polypeptide chains, while the other is composed of two fragments of molecular weight 24,000 and 39,000 (Fragments A and B, respectively) linked by at least one disulfide bridge. Here we report that when these preparations are treated at 25° with low concentrations of trypsin (0.25 to 1.0 µg per ml), a single scission is introduced at a specific site in the former (intact toxin) converting it into a protein apparently identical with the latter (nicked toxin). Thus nicked toxin in the original preparations must be a derivative of intact toxin which arose by attack of proteases from the bacterial culture in which the toxin was produced. Fragment A contains 1 half-cystine residue, and is therefore linked to Fragment B in nicked toxin by one disulfide bridge. Fragment A is stable to heating at 100°, and exposure to pH values from 2 through 12. Fragment B is relatively unstable, and precipitates even at neutral pH. We have shown previously that toxin is almost devoid of enzymic activity unless treated with thiols. The activity is probably entirely due to Fragment A released upon dissociation of nicked toxin in the presence of thiols. When toxin is treated with trypsin the intact chains are converted into a form which can be dissociated by thiols into fragments apparently identical with A and B. Hence the specific activity of the preparation is enhanced by trypsin treatment because of the greater amount of Fragment A released by thiols. The toxicity of toxin is not significantly changed by treatment with trypsin, which indicates that both intact and nicked toxin are toxic. Fragment A alone is not toxic. Linkage to Fragment B is apparently required for toxicity, perhaps to facilitate entry of Fragment A into cells. Treatment of toxin with thiols decreases the toxicity, presumably as a result of dissociation of the nicked fraction into nontoxic Fragments A and B."
https://openalex.org/W1536307228,"Abstract The intact diphtheria toxin molecule, a single polypeptide chain of about 62,000 daltons, has no enzymic activity. However, the transfer in vitro of ADP-ribose from NAD to aminoacyltransferase II can be catalyzed by any of several fragments of toxin. The smallest active fragment (A, 24,000 daltons) is normally connected to the remainder of the molecule (B, 38,000 daltons) by a peptide bond and a disulfide bond. Both of these bonds must be broken to activate Fragment A. Thus, for example, toxin may be activated by mild digestion with trypsin in the presence of a thiol-reducing agent. The subsequent removal of Fragment B has no effect on the enzymic activity of Fragment A in vitro, but both fragments are required for intoxication of whole cells or of animals. Any enzymic activity observed in preparations of diphtheria toxin in the presence of a thiol derives from degradation products formed from the intact oxin after its synthesis by the diphtheria bacilli."
https://openalex.org/W1568190283,"Abstract A phosphotransferase system was isolated from Escherichia coli and was detected in other gram-negative organisms. The system catalyzed the transfer of phosphate from phosphoenolpyruvate to sugars of the d-gluco and d-manno configurations, yielding pyruvate and the corresponding sugar 6-phosphate esters. Fractionation of the enzyme system yielded three protein components, Enzymes I and II, and a histidine-containing protein, designated HPr. Enzyme I catalyzed the transfer of phosphate from phosphoenolpyruvate to HPr. The phosphoryl moiety in phospho-HPr was linked to the protein via an imidazole nitrogen atom of a histidine residue. Enzyme II catalyzed the transfer of phosphate from phospho-HPr to the sugars. Enzyme I and HPr were soluble constituents of the cell, while Enzyme II (or Fraction II) was located in the membrane fraction."

https://openalex.org/W1649136725,"Diphtheria toxin is synthesized as a single polypeptide chain with a molecular weight of about 62,000. After being secreted it may be partially digested by proteolytic enzymes released from the bacterial cells into the culture medium and purified preparations of toxin usually contain some of the proteolytic breakdown products. In particular most toxin preparations contain a species (nicked toxin) in which two fragments of molecular weights 24,000 (A) and 38,000 (B) are linked by a single disulfide bond. Fragment B contains an internal disulfide bond. Fragment A is stable to denaturing agents, acid, alkali, and heat, whereas Fragment B forms aggregates in neutral buffers. Fragments similar to A and B are the first tryptic digestion products of reduced toxin but in the absence of thiol-reducing agents trypsin also rapidly hydrolyses a second peptide bond."

https://openalex.org/W2078590566,"Studies of the interactions between the metabolism and the function of the red cell have shown the importance of the red cell's metabolism in contributing to the maintenance of adequate oxygen delivery. Some of the phosphorylated intermediates of glycolysis, especially DPG, are now known to reduce the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen. Current evidence indicates that this phenomenon is due to the effects of the binding of DPG to the , beta-chains of deoxyhemoglobin. It appears that increases in red cell concentrations of DPG commonly occur during hypoxia, and that these increases (as well as normal physiological variation) significantly enhance oxygen transport. Artificial manipulation of erythrocyte metabolism may soon prove to be of great clinical usefulness in the treatment of a great variety of disorders which limit oxygen transport."
https://openalex.org/W1515045711,"Abstract A purified (300-fold) liver protein specifically binds squalene and sterol precursors of cholesterol and activates (4-fold or greater) the microsomal enzymic steps of cholesterol biosynthesis in which these precursors participate. This heat-stable protein appears to play a general role as vehicle for cholesterol and its water-insoluble precursors, i.e. it is a squalene and sterol carrier protein (SCP). Apo-SCP (molecular weight 16,000) aggregates to a higher molecular weight species (g150,000) during binding of squalene or sterols and yields a noncovalent squalene- or sterol-SCP complex. Apo-SCP similarly binds stoichiometric levels of a cholesterol precursor and the pyridine nucleotide cofactor required for the oxidation or reduction of the precursor by microsomal enzymes. The apparent Km for a particular sterol-SCP complex is markedly lower than that for initially unbound sterol, although the maximum rate of the particular reaction is unchanged. Of the other liver and serum proteins tested, only apo-high density lipoprotein (HDL) will substitute for the binding and activation functions of apo-SCP. A component of HDL may be identical with apo-SCP."

https://openalex.org/W1496473115,"Abstract Although the enzymes that catalyze the transformation of proinsulin to insulin have not yet been identified, studies of intermediate forms of proinsulin isolated from bovine pancreas indicate the existence of a mechanism in which the interchain connecting peptide is cleaved with elimination of a pair of basic residues from each end to yield insulin and the intact remainder of the connecting peptide segment. This acidic peptide, designated the C-peptide, has been isolated from fresh bovine pancreas and purified by means of a procedure involving acid-ethanol extraction, gel filtration, carboxymethylcellulose chromatography, paper electrophoresis, and partition chromatography. The peptide was found to occur on an equimolar basis with insulin, as expected from the stoichiometry of the cleavage process. The yield of both peptides was approximately 10 µmoles per kg of pancreas. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of the peptide and its chymotryptic fragments demonstrated its structural identity with the authentic proinsulin C-peptide prepared by tryptic digestion of the bovine proinsulin intermediate fraction. These findings are in accord with the hypothesis that the cleavage of proinsulin occurs within newly formed secretory granules and the products are retained therein until they are discharged together by means of fusion of the granule membrane with the cell membrane in the process of emiocytosis."

https://openalex.org/W1558981331,"Abstract Two glucose uptake systems have been detected in ungerminated conidia of wild type Neurospora crassa, strain 74A; the high affinity system has been characterized. Uptake and substrate competition experiments showed that the high affinity system was relatively specific for d-glucose but also transported the nonmetabolizable analogues 6-deoxy-d-glucose, 2-deoxy-d-glucose, and 3-O-methyl-d-glucose. The system exhibited a Km of 0.07 mm and a Vmax of 4 mµmoles per mg, dry weight, per min for 3-O-methyl-d-glucose uptake. The nonmetabolizable analogues were accumulated against concentration gradients; chromatographic analysis showed that the material accumulated in each case was the free sugar. Uptake by the high affinity system was inhibited by azide and dinitrophenol. These results were consistent with an active transport mechanism for uptake. Two alternative mechanisms, group translocation and coupled transport, were considered unlikely because no transitory substrate derivative could be detected during uptake and because influx of 3-O-methyl-d-glucose was not coupled to efflux of any organic metabolite. The high affinity system was repressed when the conidia were germinated on glucose medium but was restored when the glucose was either depleted or removed from the medium. This restoration was inhibited by cycloheximide. Two additional kinetic features were of importance in interpreting 3-O-methyl-d-glucose transport. First, previously accumulated substrate stimulated the subsequent influx of 3-O-methyl-d-glucose. The stimulation was proportional to the internal substrate concentration and was inhibited by azide. Second, efflux appeared to be a carrier-mediated process, but, in contrast to the high affinity uptake system, it was not inhibited by azide or by sulfhydryl reagents."
https://openalex.org/W1511297790,"Pyruvate decarboxylase, isolated from active dry bakers' yeast, dissociates into subunits of one-half the molecular weight at alkaline pH. This has been determined by chromatography on Sephadex G-200 over the pH range 6.5 to 8.0. The conditions at which protein dissociation is observed are the same as the conditions at which the cofactors thiamine pyrophosphate and Mg2+ are released and can be separated from the protein. When the holoenzyme is reconstituted in the presence of thiamine-PP and Mg2+ the active enzyme is a dimer of the same molecular weight as the original native enzyme. When the apoenzyme, subjected to the reconstitution procedure in the absence of thiamine-PP and Mg2+, is chromatographed on Sephadex G-200 at pH 6.5 the protein is eluted at an intermediate position, suggesting a monomer-dimer equilibrium which favors the monomer. It appears that thiamine-PP in addition to its catalytic role also functions in the formation of a stable dimer which is the active holoenzyme. The presence of a subunit association step in the reconstitution process which requires thiamine-PP and Mg2+ identifies a site which may be related to the unusual requirement for excess thiamine-PP in the reconstitution process. A method for selectively staining pyruvate decarboxylase on disc electrophoresis gels with a fuchsin staining reagent is described."
https://openalex.org/W1591661445,"Abstract Thymidylate synthetase from Don Chinese hamster cells grown in vitro was characterized and the changes in the specific activity of this enzyme during the culture cycle and the cell cycle were examined. In crude extracts thymidylate synthetase exhibited a Km for dUMP of 0.90 ± 0.04 x 10-5 m, was very heat-labile at temperatures above 43°, but was stable over pH 7.5 to 9.5. During the culture cycle of Don cells, thymidylate synthetase activity rose 6- to 8-fold during logarithmic growth and fell to base line when the cultures entered stationary phase. In contrast, lactate dehydrogenase activity was low during logarithmic growth and high during stationary phase. However, during the cell cycle of logarithmically growing Don C cells (Don subline), thymidylate synthetase and lactate dehydrogenase activities rose and fell in exact parallel, being low in G1, rising sharply at the beginning of S and again in late S, dropping at the beginning of G2, and then rising again in mid-G2. These studies indicate that, while the absolute amount of a given enzyme present at any time in a cell may be controlled individually for different enzymes, regulation of the relative activity and perhaps the general synthesis and degradation of many different enzymes is synchronized within the cell during logarithmic growth."

https://openalex.org/W1519698205,"Abstract Cysteine 80 and cysteine 117 of the α subunit of the Escherichia coli tryptophan synthetase have been cross-linked by use of the bifunctional reagent N,N'-bis(maleimidomethyl) ether (BME). The sites of reaction were identified from the amino acid compositions of radioactive peptides purified from tryptic and tryptic-chymotryptic digests of α subunit which had reacted with 3H-BME to the extent of 1 mole of cross-linking reagent per mole of enzyme. Hydrodynamic studies showed that no significant dimer formation had occurred. The electrophoretic and immunochemical properties of the enzyme are identical with those of untreated control preparations. Although the intramolecularly cross-linked monomers are apparently homogeneous by these criteria, BME-treated α subunits are functionally heterogeneous in that 70% of the independent indoleglycerol phosphate activity of the α subunit has been lost after reaction of 1 mole of BME with 1 mole of α subunit. In addition, 70% of the protein in such preparations cannot form a functional α2β2-tryptophan synthetase complex with the β2 subunit, as measured indirectly by enzymatic activity studies and directly in studies on α2β2 complex formation in sucrose density gradient centrifugation experiments. Two possible explanations for the observed functional heterogeneity of BME cysteine 80 to cysteine 117 cross-linked α subunit preparations are advanced. These mechanisms may be interdependent. Two new asymmetric centers are introduced by the addition of the protein cysteinyl thiols across the two maleimide double bonds of the bifunctional reagent. A population of α subunits cross-linked between these 2 cysteinyl residues might contain as many as four different conformational forms of BME cross-link. The sulfhydryl group region of the enzyme is known from previous studies to be closely related to the active site of the subunit in the indoleglycerol phosphate aldolase reaction, and to be important in the association of the α subunit with β2 subunits to form the α2β2-tryptophan synthetase complex. Alternatively, the order of addition of the two cysteinyl thiols to the BME molecule is not known, and it is possible that differences in either protein active site structure, or in the stereochemical course of the cross-linking reaction may be the consequence of initial reaction of BME at one or the other of the 2 cysteinyl residues. Such differences in structure between the active and inactive subunits are nonetheless not great enough to allow the physical separation of the different forms involved."

Whereas the inhibitory effect produced by IdUTP at pH 5.4 could not be prevented by even a 12-fold excess of dCTP, the activation caused by IdUTP at pH 7.8 is completely prevented by dTTP. Zone sedimentation studies in sucrose gradients have shown that the sedimentation coefficient of deoxythymidine kinase at pH 7.8 is increased by 5-bromo-2'-deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate and 5-iodo-2'-deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate to a greater extent than that produced by dCTP. IdUTP caused an even more marked effect on the sedimentation coefficient observed at pH 5.6 and 7.8 and was similar to that produced by dTTP. Linear reciprocal plots were obtained for varying concentrations of deoxythymidine in the presence of each halogenated effector at pH 5.4 and 7.8. At pH 5.4 IdUTP, like dTTP, was a competitive inhibitor of thymidine phosphorylation. The synthesis of 5-iodo-2'-deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate from dCTP by direct iodination is described."

Separation from endogenous cholesterol was achieved by oxidation with chromic acid, and subsequent borohydride reduction of the isolated Δ7-3-ketone. 6β-3H-5α-Cholest-7-en-3β-ol has been converted in 3% yield to 6-3H-cholesta-5,7-dien-3β-ol by a rat liver microsomal preparation containing (trans-1,4-bis(2-chlorobenzylaminoethyl)-cyclohexane dihydrochloride. 6α-3H-14C5-5α-Cholest-7-en-3β-ol has been incubated with a rat liver microsomal preparation, being converted in 5.5% yield into 14C5-cholesta-5,7-dien-3β-ol with loss of tritium. Less than 1% of the liberated tritium was found in isolated NADH, the remainder being isolated as 3H2O. In a control experiment, synthetic NADH-4-3H2 was incubated with a microsomal preparation as before. The resulting NADH, isolated in 30% yield, contained 70% of the 3H (corrected to 100% isolation); the remainder of the radioactivity was isolated as 3H2O. Clearly then in the conversion of 5α-cholest-7-en-3β-ol into 7-dehydrocholesterol, the 6α-hydrogen is removed as a proton, and is not directly transferred to NAD+. Had NADH-3H been formed, not more than a 30% loss of 3H would have been expected during the isolation of the NADH."
https://openalex.org/W1563303137,"Abstract The reaction pattern of the three sulfhydryl groups of the α subunit of the Escherichia coli tryptophan synthetase with N-ethylmaleimide and 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) at pH 7.0 is profoundly altered in the presence of 10 mm indole. The effect of indole is upon both the rate of reaction, and upon its over-all extent. In the absence of indole, only cysteinyl sulfhydryl groups 80 and 117 of the α subunit are available for reaction with N-ethylmaleimide, but in 10 mm indole all three thiol groups become available for reaction. Similar results were obtained with DTNB (i.e. in the absence of indole a single sulfhydryl group reacts rapidly with DTNB, any further reaction occurring very slowly; in the presence of indole all three sulfhydryl groups react at a slower although uniform rate). The effects of indole in the 7.5 to 10.0 mm concentration range could not be mimicked with 20% sucrose, 20% ethanol, 20% ethylene glycol, or 20% dioxane, solvents known to be effective perturbants of protein tertiary structure. The presence of indole also had no effect on the optical rotatory dispersion of the enzyme, and caused no detectable change in the 16 ± 2% α helical structure found for this protein. Indole 3-glycerol phosphate (InGP) at concentrations twice the enzyme's Km for this substrate in the InGP aldolase reaction catalyzed by the free α subunit, protected all three sulfhydryl groups from reaction with DTNB in the presence of indole. Examination of the indole concentration dependence of its effect on sulfhydryl group reactivity, and determination of its Km in the reverse InGP aldolase reaction (synthesis of InGP from indole in the presence of excess d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate) showed that the two processes reached half-saturation at indole concentrations of 3.6 and 4.1 mm, respectively. It is concluded that the effect of indole on sulfhydryl group reactivity reflects enzyme conformational changes related to the mechanism of catalysis of the InGP aldolase reaction by the independent α subunit. Indole-induced conformational changes in α subunit structure may be involved in the regulation and catalysis of the last steps in tryptophan synthesis by the α2β2-tryptophan synthetase complex."
https://openalex.org/W1551325764,"Abstract A kinetic analysis of the readdition of CMP or AMP into venom phosphodiesterase-digested transfer RNA by tRNA-nucleotidyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.25) from Escherichia coli is presented. Five purified amino acid acceptor species and unfractionated tRNA were investigated. The Km value for the incorporation of AMP was 10-fold higher than the Km for CMP incorporation into tRNA from which two or three nucleotides had been removed. The Km values for ATP and CTP were similar for all tRNA tested. ATP inhibited CMP incorporation and CTP inhibited AMP incorporation, the Ki values for the two nucleotides were the same, but larger than their Km values. The Km values for the tRNA substrates were about the same whether AMP or CMP incorporation was measured. The tRNA substrates from which one, two, or three nucleotides had been removed inhibited competitively the incorporation of AMP or CMP into tRNA. A smaller inhibition was observed with intact tRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1824147541,"Formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase, a tetrameric protein, contains 23 half-cystine residues as determined by cysteic acid analysis and 24 free sulfhydryl groups as determined by four different methods thus indicating absence of disulfide bonds. All of the cysteine residues react with sulfhydryl reagents in the absence of denaturing agents. Titration of the enzyme with p-chloromercuribenzoate (CMB) caused a loss in activity which was a linear function of the amount of thiol groups reacted. A complete loss in activity occurred after 11 CMB molecules had reacted per mole of enzyme. The loss in activity was accompanied by the appearance of the monomeric form of the protein; however, the presence of tetramer which contained CMB was demonstrated by Sephadex G-200 chromatography of enzyme which had been partially inactivated with 14C-labeled CMB. The reaction of the enzyme with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) was different from that with CMB. The relation between thiol groups reacted and loss in activity was not linear, and about 18 to 20 thiol groups had to react before a complete loss in activity occurred. Dissociation to the monomeric form did not occur until about 75% of the cysteine residues had reacted. Titration with HgCl2 showed that a linear decrease in activity occurred until complete inactivation was observed after 8 Hg2+ ions had been bound by the protein. Hg2+ could be bound to virtually all of the cysteine residues without causing dissociation of the enzyme. Reactivation by cysteine of enzyme inactivated by CMB or DTNB was variable and could be achieved only when the enzyme was still in the tetrameric form. Total reactivation of mercury enzyme was achieved with 2-mercaptoethanol or cysteine. The inactivation by CMB and DTNB was retarded by ATP and tetrahydrofolate and facilitated by MgATP. Formate and Mg2+ had no effect on the inactivation. It is concluded that the inactivation of formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase by sulfhydryl reagents results from conformational changes produced in the tetramer as well as from dissociation of the tetramer to the inactive monomer. The effects produced by the substrates probably result from conformational changes in the protein. There is no evidence which suggests that a sulfhydryl group or groups constitute part of the active site of the enzyme."

The transfer is not through the parental crop milk. The squab does not accumulate enough transferrin of its own making to be detectable until it is about 8 days old. The maternally derived protein remains detectable until 14 days after hatching. The squab actively synthesizes a portion its own transferrin from hatching onward."
https://openalex.org/W1596607720,"Abstract Fumarase from swine heart muscle has been found to catalyze the stereospecific hydration of the l isomer of trans-2,3-epoxysuccinate to yield mesotartrate. The structure of the product was established by a combination of chromatographic techniques and by gas-liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Attempts to dissociate the fumarate-hydrating activity of fumarase from the l-trans-2,3-epoxysuccinate-hydrating activity (including studies involving partial heat inactivation and acrylamide gel electrophoresis) were unsuccessful. Fumarate acted as an inhibitor of the l-trans-2,3-epoxysuccinate-hydrating activity of fumarase and l-trans-2,3-epoxysuccinate inhibited the catalysis by fumarase of the conversion of fumarate to l-malate."
https://openalex.org/W1567459634,"Abstract A comparative study was made of the binding of the two major methionyl transfer RNA species present in wheat embryos, rat liver, and Escherichia coli to ribosomes. At the lower magnesium ion concentrations (4 to 10 mm), the putative initiator methionyl-tRNAs from the three sources bound to washed wheat and E. coli ribosomes much more efficiently than the other major methionyl-tRNA species. The binding was dependent on the presence of the coding trinucleotide ApUpG. In one heterologous system, wheat ribosomes did not discriminate between E. coli Met-tRNAfmet and E. coli Met-tRNAmet, binding both very efficiently at 5 mm magnesium ion concentration."

The results of partial kinetic characterization of the enzyme support the conclusion that the reaction proceeds via a binary ping-pong mechanism. The Michaelis constants for the amino acceptor, α-ketoglutarate, and three branched chain amino acid donors (isoleucine, leucine, and valine) were determined with the use of an appropriate Fortran computer program. No significant kinetic differences were found between the enzymes of the two Salmonella species. The Km for α-ketoglutarate is the same with each of the branched chain amino acids. The aminotransferase displays a comparable affinity for isoleucine and leucine, which is greater than that observed for valine."

https://openalex.org/W2020705562,The Family Planning Services and Population Research Act of 1970 the first major federal legislation dealing solely with population authorized the expenditure of $225 million for family planning services and $145 million for research over a 3-year period. This was to be spent by the administration in addition to family planning funding already authorized for the Dept. of Health Education and Welfare the Office of Economic Opportunity and the State Dept. So far only a small amount of the authorized money has been spent by the administration signalling waning administration interest in population affairs. The research money would go to the Center for Population Research in the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. NIH has traditionally favored basic biomedical research instead of practically-oriented studies. It is believed that population research would fare better if removed from the jurisdiction of NIH and put under another agency.
