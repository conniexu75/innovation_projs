https://openalex.org/W2802667264,"Reversible phase separation underpins the role of FUS in ribonucleoprotein granules and other membrane-free organelles and is, in part, driven by the intrinsically disordered low-complexity (LC) domain of FUS. Here, we report that cooperative cation-π interactions between tyrosines in the LC domain and arginines in structured C-terminal domains also contribute to phase separation. These interactions are modulated by post-translational arginine methylation, wherein arginine hypomethylation strongly promotes phase separation and gelation. Indeed, significant hypomethylation, which occurs in FUS-associated frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), induces FUS condensation into stable intermolecular β-sheet-rich hydrogels that disrupt RNP granule function and impair new protein synthesis in neuron terminals. We show that transportin acts as a physiological molecular chaperone of FUS in neuron terminals, reducing phase separation and gelation of methylated and hypomethylated FUS and rescuing protein synthesis. These results demonstrate how FUS condensation is physiologically regulated and how perturbations in these mechanisms can lead to disease."
https://openalex.org/W2801688422,"Cytoplasmic FUS aggregates are a pathological hallmark in a subset of patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). A key step that is disrupted in these patients is nuclear import of FUS mediated by the import receptor Transportin/Karyopherin-β2. In ALS-FUS patients, this is caused by mutations in the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of FUS that weaken Transportin binding. In FTD-FUS patients, Transportin is aggregated, and post-translational arginine methylation, which regulates the FUS-Transportin interaction, is lost. Here, we show that Transportin and arginine methylation have a crucial function beyond nuclear import-namely to suppress RGG/RG-driven phase separation and stress granule association of FUS. ALS-associated FUS-NLS mutations weaken the chaperone activity of Transportin and loss of FUS arginine methylation, as seen in FTD-FUS, promote phase separation, and stress granule partitioning of FUS. Our findings reveal two regulatory mechanisms of liquid-phase homeostasis that are disrupted in FUS-associated neurodegeneration."

Filbin et al. used a single-cell sequencing approach to study the oncogenic programs, genetics, and cellular hierarchies of H3K27M-glioma. Tumors were mainly composed of cells resembling oligodendrocyte precursor cells, whereas differentiated malignant cells were a smaller fraction. In comparison with other gliomas, these cancers had distinct oncogenic programs and stem cell–like profiles that contributed to their stable tumor-propagating potential. The analysis also identified a lineage-specific marker that may be useful in developing therapies. Science , this issue p. 331"
https://openalex.org/W2802842075,"RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) with prion-like domains (PrLDs) phase transition to functional liquids, which can mature into aberrant hydrogels composed of pathological fibrils that underpin fatal neurodegenerative disorders. Several nuclear RBPs with PrLDs, including TDP-43, FUS, hnRNPA1, and hnRNPA2, mislocalize to cytoplasmic inclusions in neurodegenerative disorders, and mutations in their PrLDs can accelerate fibrillization and cause disease. Here, we establish that nuclear-import receptors (NIRs) specifically chaperone and potently disaggregate wild-type and disease-linked RBPs bearing a NLS. Karyopherin-β2 (also called Transportin-1) engages PY-NLSs to inhibit and reverse FUS, TAF15, EWSR1, hnRNPA1, and hnRNPA2 fibrillization, whereas Importin-α plus Karyopherin-β1 prevent and reverse TDP-43 fibrillization. Remarkably, Karyopherin-β2 dissolves phase-separated liquids and aberrant fibrillar hydrogels formed by FUS and hnRNPA1. In vivo, Karyopherin-β2 prevents RBPs with PY-NLSs accumulating in stress granules, restores nuclear RBP localization and function, and rescues degeneration caused by disease-linked FUS and hnRNPA2. Thus, NIRs therapeutically restore RBP homeostasis and mitigate neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2801356113,"Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is believed to underlie formation of biomolecular condensates, cellular compartments that concentrate macromolecules without surrounding membranes. Physical mechanisms that control condensate formation/dissolution are poorly understood. The RNA-binding protein fused in sarcoma (FUS) undergoes LLPS in vitro and associates with condensates in cells. We show that the importin karyopherin-β2/transportin-1 inhibits LLPS of FUS. This activity depends on tight binding of karyopherin-β2 to the C-terminal proline-tyrosine nuclear localization signal (PY-NLS) of FUS. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses reveal weak interactions of karyopherin-β2 with sequence elements and structural domains distributed throughout the entirety of FUS. Biochemical analyses demonstrate that most of these same regions also contribute to LLPS of FUS. The data lead to a model where high-affinity binding of karyopherin-β2 to the FUS PY-NLS tethers the proteins together, allowing multiple, distributed weak intermolecular contacts to disrupt FUS self-association, blocking LLPS. Karyopherin-β2 may act analogously to control condensates in diverse cellular contexts."

To identify genetic units affecting sensitivity to cytarabine, the mainstay of treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we developed a comprehensive and integrated genome-wide platform based on a dual protein-coding and non-coding integrated CRISPRa screening (DICaS). Putative resistance genes were initially identified using pharmacogenetic data from 760 human pan-cancer cell lines. Subsequently, genome scale functional characterization of both coding and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes by CRISPR activation was performed. For lncRNA functional assessment, we developed a CRISPR activation of lncRNA (CaLR) strategy, targeting 14,701 lncRNA genes. Computational and functional analysis identified novel cell-cycle, survival/apoptosis, and cancer signaling genes. Furthermore, transcriptional activation of the GAS6-AS2 lncRNA, identified in our analysis, leads to hyperactivation of the GAS6/TAM pathway, a resistance mechanism in multiple cancers including AML. Thus, DICaS represents a novel and powerful approach to identify integrated coding and non-coding pathways of therapeutic relevance.

Thus, DICaS represents a novel and powerful approach to identify integrated coding and non-coding pathways of therapeutic relevance. Although precision medicine and targeted therapies offer new hope for treating cancer, chemotherapy still remains the first, and last, line of defense for most patients. Cytarabine (1-β-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine, Ara-C) is a deoxycytidine analog that is used as part of a standard chemotherapeutic regimen for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Ramos et al., 2015Ramos N.R. Mo C.C. Karp J.E. Hourigan C.S. Current approaches in the treatment of relapsed and refractory acute myeloid leukemia.J. Clin. Med. 2015; 4: 665-695Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, ∼30% to 50% of patients relapse with chemotherapy-resistant disease. Thus, there is an ever-present need to better understand the genetic and molecular mechanisms that contribute to chemotherapy resistance. To date, studies on mechanisms leading to therapy resistance have focused on protein-coding genes, yet cancer development and progression cannot be fully explained by the coding genome (Huarte, 2015Huarte M. The emerging role of lncRNAs in cancer.Nat. Med. 2015; 21: 1253-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar, Imielinski et al., 2012Imielinski M. Berger A.H. Hammerman P.S. Hernandez B.

The recent explosion in research and understanding related to the non-coding RNA (ncRNA) transcriptome has highlighted the importance of ncRNAs in biology (Hon et al., 2017Hon C. Ramilowski J. Harshbarger J. Bertin N. Rackham O. Gough J. Denisenko E. Schmeier S. Poulsen T.

Genet. 2015; 47: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1875) Google Scholar). Functional validation of various ncRNA species highlights the fact that these RNAs may play important roles in the pathogenesis of diseases including cancer (Schmitt and Chang, 2016Schmitt A.M. Chang H.Y. Long noncoding RNAs in cancer pathways.Cancer Cell. 2016; 29: 452-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2180) Google Scholar). One large group of ncRNAs is represented by long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA). LncRNAs can be either nuclear or cytoplasmic in localization and play roles in a diverse array of biological processes. As many nuclear lncRNAs behave in a cis-acting manner (Quinn and Chang, 2016Quinn J.J. Chang H.Y. Unique features of long non-coding RNA biogenesis and function.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2016; 17: 47-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (2289) Google Scholar), their study requires their expression from endogenous loci, and CRISPR technologies now facilitate the modulation of gene expression directly from the endogenous promoter (Joung et al., 2017aJoung J. Engreitz J.M. Konermann S. Abudayyeh O.O. Verdine V.K. Aguet F. Gootenberg J.S. Sanjana N.E. Wright J.B.

Brigham M.D. Trevino A.E. Joung J. Abudayyeh O.O. Barcena C. Hsu P.D. Habib N. Gootenberg J.S. Nishimasu H. et al.Genome-scale transcriptional activation by an engineered CRISPR-Cas9 complex.Nature. 2015; 517: 583-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar). This approach has already been compellingly demonstrated using CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) to silence the expression of lncRNAs genome-wide (Liu et al., 2017Liu S.J. Horlbeck M.A. Cho S.W. Birk H.S. Malatesta M. He D. Attenello F.J. Villalta J.E. Cho M.Y. Chen Y. et al.CRISPRi-based genome-scale identification of functional long noncoding RNA loci in human cells.Science. 2017; 355: eaah7111Crossref Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Although we now have a wealth of high-throughput data delineating expression of coding and non-coding genes across hundreds of cancer cell lines (Barretina et al., 2012Barretina J. Caponigro G. Stransky N. Venkatesan K. Margolin A.A. Kim S. Wilson C.J. Lehár J. Kryukov G.V. Sonkin D. et al.The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia enables predictive modelling of anticancer drug sensitivity.Nature. 2012; 483: 603-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (4822) Google Scholar, Garnett et al., 2012Garnett M.J. Edelman E.J. Heidorn S.J. Greenman C.D. Dastur A. Lau K.W. Greninger P. Thompson I.R. Luo X. Soares J. et al.Systematic identification of genomic markers of drug sensitivity in cancer cells.Nature. 2012; 483: 570-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (1696) Google Scholar), there remains a critical lack of integrated high-throughput functional characterization and validation of these data in a disease context. We therefore sought to develop an integrative and comprehensive CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) framework that would complement these publicly available “Big Data” databases to enable the discovery of functional human protein coding and lncRNA genes contributing to chemotherapy resistance. In doing so, we developed a dual coding and non-coding integrated CRISPRa screening (DICaS) platform and applied this integrative approach to identify genetic units and pathways that promote resistance to Ara-C treatment. In order to comprehensively define resistance mechanisms to chemotherapy, we chose to examine cellular responses to Ara-C. We developed a computational strategy to identify genes that correlate with sensitivity or resistance to Ara-C by correlating pharmacological profiles from the Cancer Target Discovery and Development (CTD2) database (Basu et al., 2013Basu A.

Bodycombe N.E. et al.Correlating chemical sensitivity and basal gene expression reveals mechanism of action.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2016; 12: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) with the transcriptomes of 760 corresponding cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) (Barretina et al., 2012Barretina J. Caponigro G. Stransky N. Venkatesan K. Margolin A.A. Kim S. Wilson C.J. Lehár J. Kryukov G.V. Sonkin D. et al.The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia enables predictive modelling of anticancer drug sensitivity.Nature. 2012; 483: 603-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (4822) Google Scholar) (Figure S1A). To identify high confidence gene targets, it is imperative to integrate analysis of as many cell lines as possible (Rees et al., 2016Rees M.G. Seashore-Ludlow B. Cheah J.H. Adams D.J. Price E.V. Gill S. Javaid S. Coletti M.E. Jones V.L. Bodycombe N.E. et al.Correlating chemical sensitivity and basal gene expression reveals mechanism of action.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2016; 12: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar); however, we found that the cell line drug sensitivities formed a skewed distribution (Figure S1B), likely conferred by tissue of origin and histological subtype. Indeed, cancer cell type annotations explained a substantial amount of the variation in drug sensitivities (adjusted R2 = 0.5123, ANOVA p < 2.2e−16) (Figure S1A), which were subsequently corrected (Figure S1C). Thus, using a linear regression model to remove these effects we established a normalized distribution of Ara-C sensitivity for the 760 cell lines analyzed (Figure 1A).Figure 1Identification of Protein-Coding and Non-coding Gene Biomarkers Correlated with Differential Ara-C ResponseShow full caption(A) Distribution of Ara-C drug sensitivities across 760 pan-cancer cell lines profiled by both CCLE and CTD2 studies, quantified by their Z scaled area under the dose-response curve values after regressing out lineage-specific effects.

See also Figures S1 and S2 and Table S2. We subsequently performed a correlation analysis between drug sensitivities and gene expression levels across the 760 cell lines (Figure 1B; Table S1) and determined appropriate Z score thresholds (Figures S1D and S1E). Interestingly, genes involved in the metabolism of Ara-C were highly enriched, illustrating the applicability of such an approach to identifying chemotherapy resistance mechanisms. Low expression of deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) and equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1/SLC29A1) correlated with increased resistance to Ara-C (Z = −2.51 and −1.61, respectively), whereas high expression of cytidine deaminase (CDA) and SAM domain and HD domain 1 (SAMHD1) correlated with increased resistance (Herold et al., 2017Herold N.

Interestingly, we also observed a number of cell-cycle and DNA damage regulators previously implicated in modulation of AraC sensitivity (Abraham et al., 2015Abraham A. Varatharajan S. Karathedath S.

Genetic factors influencing cytarabine therapy.Pharmacogenomics. 2009; 10: 1657-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) (Figure 1B). To define biological pathways predictive of Ara-C resistance we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) on the drug sensitivity-gene expression correlations using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway annotations (Figure 1C; Table S3) (Kanehisa et al., 2014Kanehisa M.

USA. 2005; 102: 15545-15550Crossref PubMed Scopus (26559) Google Scholar). We identified positive enrichment of cell survival signaling pathways, including the Jak-STAT (NES = 1.385, p = 0.013), PI3K-Akt (NES = 1.232, p = 0.025), and MAPK (NES = 1.222, p = 0.042) pathways and negative enrichment of the pyrimidine metabolic pathway (NES = −2.456, p = 0.00016), mechanisms related to DNA damage (e.g., p53 signaling pathway: NES = −2.293, p = 0.00016), and RNA regulatory mechanisms (e.g., RNA degradation: NES = −2.613, p = 1.6e−4) (Figures 1C, 1D, and S1F). To confirm their relevance in human AML, we correlated pre-treatment AML transcriptome profiles with corresponding disease-free survival data from 121 patients treated with Ara-C from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (Ley et al., 2013Ley T.J. Miller C. Ding L. Raphael B.J. Mungall A.J. Robertson A. Hoadley K. Triche Jr., T.J. Laird P.W. Baty J.D. et al.Cancer Genome Atlas Research NetworkGenomic and epigenomic landscapes of adult de novo acute myeloid leukemia.N. Engl. J. Med. 2013; 368: 2059-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar) and identified a large number of enriched pathways shared with our cell line predictions, including oxidative phosphorylation (Farge et al., 2017Farge T. Saland E. de Toni F. Aroua N. Hosseini M. Perry R. Bosc C. Sugita M. Stuani L. Fraisse M. et al.Chemotherapy-resistant human acute myeloid leukemia cells are not enriched for leukemic stem cells but require oxidative metabolism.Cancer Discov. 2017; 7: 716-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) (NES = −1.994, p = 1.1e−4) and RNA regulatory mechanisms (e.g., RNA degradation: NES = −1.702, p = 0.0011) (Figures S1G and S1H). As many non-coding genes act in a proximal and localized manner (Schmitt and Chang, 2016Schmitt A.M. Chang H.Y. Long noncoding RNAs in cancer pathways.Cancer Cell. 2016; 29: 452-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2180) Google Scholar), we evaluated coding and non-coding cognate gene pairs for correlation with either resistance or sensitivity to Ara-C and compiled a genome wide set of 997 coding/non-coding sense/antisense gene pairs. Indeed, we observed a significant positive correlation between sense-antisense gene expression levels across the cell line panel (Pearson correlation, median R = 0.5312; Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p < 2.2e−16) (Figure 1E). Furthermore, cognate gene pairs demonstrated significant positive correlation in drug sensitivity (Pearson correlation, R = 0.5636, p < 2.2e−16) (Figure 1F). Importantly, analysis of these same cognate gene pairs among the TCGA AML patient cohort identified a similarly significant positive correlation (Figures S2A–S2C). Interestingly, cognate sense genes were found to be positively enriched in PI3K-Akt (NES = 1.426, p = 0.0764) and MAPK signaling pathways (NES = 1.787, p = 0.0040) (Figure S2D), implicating these sense-antisense gene pairs in a number of the previously identified enriched pathways. To functionally validate our predictive analysis in a high-throughput manner, we established a CRISPRa-based system in AML cell lines to provide a comprehensive and integrative genome-wide study of both the coding and non-coding genes contributing to Ara-C resistance. We identified the MOLM14 AML cell line to be the most appropriate model for our screening, as its IC50 (∼0.13 μM) ranks it among the most sensitive AML cell lines (Yang et al., 2013Yang W. Soares J. Greninger P. Edelman E.J. Lightfoot H. Forbes S. Bindal N. Beare D. Smith J.A. Thompson I.R. et al.Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC): a resource for therapeutic biomarker discovery in cancer cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: D955-D961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar) (Figure 2A). Overexpression of the anti-apoptotic B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) gene increased the IC50 of MOLM14 for Ara-C, while small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of DCK provided an even more significant protection, increasing its IC50 almost 300-fold (Figure 2B), confirming that sensitivity to Ara-C can be readily manipulated. We also tested synergistic activation mediator (SAM)-mediated CRISPRa (Konermann et al., 2015Konermann S. Brigham M.D. Trevino A.E. Joung J. Abudayyeh O.O. Barcena C. Hsu P.D. Habib N. Gootenberg J.S. Nishimasu H. et al.Genome-scale transcriptional activation by an engineered CRISPR-Cas9 complex.Nature. 2015; 517: 583-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar) in MOLM14 cells as compared with two additional leukemia cell lines, K562 and HL60, and the previously validated HEK293T. Using a panel of validated single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting the promoters of both coding (TTN, RHOXF2, ASCL1, HBG1) and non-coding (MIAT, TUNA) genes (Chavez et al., 2015Chavez A. Scheiman J. Vora S. Pruitt B.W. Tuttle M. P R Iyer E. Lin S. Kiani S. Guzman C.D. Wiegand D.J. et al.Highly efficient Cas9-mediated transcriptional programming.Nat.

Buchthal J. et al.Comparison of Cas9 activators in multiple species.Nat. Methods. 2016; 13: 563-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), we established that the majority of sgRNAs gave the highest activation in MOLM14 among the leukemia cell lines (Figure S3A). We next applied our CRISPRa platform to screen for protein-coding genes using a genome wide sgRNA library (Konermann et al., 2015Konermann S. Brigham M.D. Trevino A.E. Joung J. Abudayyeh O.O. Barcena C. Hsu P.D. Habib N. Gootenberg J.S. Nishimasu H. et al.Genome-scale transcriptional activation by an engineered CRISPR-Cas9 complex.Nature. 2015; 517: 583-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar) (Figure 2C). For library screening, cells were treated for 14 days with 0.25 μM Ara-C, and cell viability monitored over the treatment period (Figure S3B). Following treatment, sgRNA abundances were quantified and analyzed for quality control (Figures S3C–S3E). Transcript-level representation between T0 and T14 identified a host of genes enriched and depleted in Ara-C-treated cells (Figures 2D and S3F). Interestingly, both the correlation analysis and our forward genetic screen revealed DCK to be the most significantly depleted gene, thereby indicating that strong transcriptional activation of DCK by CRISPRa confers high sensitivity to Ara-C (Figures 1B and 2D). Indeed, this was confirmed by overexpressing the top-scoring DCK targeting sgRNA (Figure S3G). Furthermore, multiple genes suspected to modulate sensitivity to Ara-C were also identified (Table S4). GSEA identified a number of pathways congruent with our cell line analysis (Figure 2E; Table S3). Importantly, we identified a large overlap of 2,411 genes significantly enriched/depleted in both our cell line and protein-coding CRISPRa screening (Figure S3H). We subsequently validated a subset of these genes, including ZBP1, MUL1, and PI4K2A, whose expression was associated with poor prognosis and decreased disease-free survival (Figure 2F). Cells expressing the relevant sgRNAs demonstrated increased survival upon treatment with Ara-C (Figures 2G and S3I), and a decrease in apoptosis (Figures 2H and S3J), thereby validating our findings. Importantly, the proliferative capacity of cells was not affected by the overexpression of these sgRNAs (Figure 2I). To study the functional roles of lncRNA genes in Ara-C resistance, we designed an sgRNA library using a comprehensive set of 14,701 lncRNA genes, covering all major classifications of lncRNAs (Figure 3A; Table S5). We designed at least 4 sgRNAs per lncRNA, accounting for 22,253 transcriptional start sites (TSSs), covering multiple TSSs per individual lncRNA. This resulted in a library with 88,444 targeting guides (Figure 3A). We termed this CRISPRa SAM-mediated approach “CRISPR activation of lncRNA” (CaLR). To test our library, we picked sgRNAs targeting the TUNA lncRNA gene (n = 4 sgRNAs) (Figure S4A) and two alternative TSSs for the MIAT lncRNA gene (MIAT-01, n = 5 sgRNAs, MIAT-06, n = 4 sgRNAs), and we confirmed activation of each TSS using at least two sgRNAs (see Figure S3, Figure S4A, S4A, and S4B). An additional set of randomized sgRNAs was also tested on HEK293T and MOLM14, revealing that the majority of sgRNAs demonstrated transcriptional activation in at least one of these cell lines (Figure S4D). Next, we carried out screening using our CaLR library similar to that for the protein-coding library above. After quantifying sgRNA abundance, library preparations were analyzed as above for potential technical bias (Figures S4E–S4G). In order to estimate the false-positive rate within our non-coding RNA screening, we included 99 non-targeting sgRNAs (Figure 3A). These 99 non-targeting sgRNAs behaved as expected (Figure S4G) and were utilized to determine an appropriate false discovery rate (FDR) cut-off to control for the false-positive rate (Figure S4H). Interestingly, several cancer-associated lncRNA genes were identified among enriched sgRNAs, including taurine up-regulated 1 (TUG1), HOXA transcript antisense RNA, myeloid-specific 1 (HOTAIRM1), and plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1) (Figures 3B and S4I; Table S6). Interestingly, expression analysis of lncRNAs and coding genes from the TCGA AML patient cohort revealed that enriched lncRNAs from our screen tended to be both detected at a higher rate (p = 6.92e−3) and expressed more highly than depleted lncRNAs (p = 5.4e−7), whereas a similar pattern was not observed among the enriched/depleted protein-coding mRNAs (Figures 3C and 3D). Furthermore, guilt by association analysis of the enriched lncRNAs identified two distinct gene set networks: (1) oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid metabolism, and (2) leukemia development and progression (Figure S4J). Enrichment of these pathways in the first network is reflective of the role of the mitochondria in regulating nucleotide metabolism, while specific pathways enriched in the latter network include leukemia-associated pro-survival pathways (e.g., interferon response, IL6/JAK/STAT3 signaling, tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α]/nuclear factor κB [NF-κB] signaling) (Steelman et al., 2004Steelman L.S.

We compiled a short list of novel annotated lncRNAs to characterize further, which were significantly enriched in both our functional screening and our cell line analysis (Figure 3B). Co-expression analysis to associate individual lncRNA transcript levels with their most highly correlated protein coding genes from our CCLE cell line panel identified many of the pathways uncovered in our global analysis, suggesting that these lncRNAs play roles in survival pathways know to affect leukemia and drug resistance (Figure 3E; Table S3). To validate the findings from our screening experimentally, we chose 11 genes significantly enriched and two genes significantly depleted in our screening for further characterization (Figures 3B and 3E). Of these 13 genes selected from our screening, 10 were also found to be candidate genes predicted to influence Ara-C response in our cell line analysis. The enriched sgRNAs resulted in a significant protection over control cells, while the two depleted genes resulted in decreased viability in response to Ara-C (Figure 4A). Indeed, we confirmed increased lncRNA expression across the different sgRNAs examined (Figure 4B). To further characterize the ability of induced lncRNA expression to resist Ara-C cytotoxicity, we treated cells expressing the relevant sgRNAs with Ara-C (Figures 4C, S5A, and S5B). Expression of each enriched sgRNA resulted in decreased Ara-C sensitivity (Figures 4C and S5A), correlating with the protective effect observed in Figure 4A, while the depleted lncRNA genes also behaved as expected (Figure S5B).Figure S5Validation of Enriched sgRNAs Targeting lncRNAs in the CaLR Screening, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) Modulation of Ara-C response upon stable expression of sgRNAs targeting CaLR-enriched lncRNAs in MOLM14 cells.

https://openalex.org/W2801634422,"A short-term trend reversed Theory and empirical data both support the paradigm that C 4 plant species (in which the first product of carbon fixation is a four-carbon molecule) benefit less from rising carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) concentrations than C 3 species (in which the first product is a three-carbon molecule). This is because their different photosynthetic physiologies respond differently to atmospheric CO 2 concentrations. Reich et al. document a reversal of this pattern in a 20-year CO 2 enrichment experiment using grassland plots with each type of plant (see the Perspective by Hovenden and Newton). Over the first 12 years, biomass increased with elevated CO 2 in C 3 plots but not C 4 plots, as expected. But over the next 8 years, the pattern reversed: Biomass increased in C 4 plots but not C 3 plots. Thus, even the best-supported short-term drivers of plant response to global change might not predict long-term results. Science , this issue p. 317 ; see also p. 263"
https://openalex.org/W2799943205,"Mechanotransduction plays a crucial role in vascular biology. One example of this is the local regulation of vascular resistance via flow-mediated dilation (FMD). Impairment of this process is a hallmark of endothelial dysfunction and a precursor to a wide array of vascular diseases, such as hypertension and atherosclerosis. Yet the molecules responsible for sensing flow (shear stress) within endothelial cells remain largely unknown. We designed a 384-well screening system that applies shear stress on cultured cells. We identified a mechanosensitive cell line that exhibits shear stress-activated calcium transients, screened a focused RNAi library, and identified GPR68 as necessary and sufficient for shear stress responses. GPR68 is expressed in endothelial cells of small-diameter (resistance) arteries. Importantly, Gpr68-deficient mice display markedly impaired acute FMD and chronic flow-mediated outward remodeling in mesenteric arterioles. Therefore, GPR68 is an essential flow sensor in arteriolar endothelium and is a critical signaling component in cardiovascular pathophysiology."

Such targeting of the largest species is not new, however.

If the current trend continues, terrestrial mammal body sizes will become smaller than they have been over the past 45 million years. Megafaunal mammals have a major impact on the structure of ecosystems, so their loss could be particularly damaging. Science , this issue p. 310"

https://openalex.org/W2799552888,"Teneurins (TENs) are cell-surface adhesion proteins with critical roles in tissue development and axon guidance. Here, we report the 3.1-A cryoelectron microscopy structure of the human TEN2 extracellular region (ECR), revealing a striking similarity to bacterial Tc-toxins. The ECR includes a large β barrel that partially encapsulates a C-terminal domain, which emerges to the solvent through an opening in the mid-barrel region. An immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain seals the bottom of the barrel while a β propeller is attached in a perpendicular orientation. We further show that an alternatively spliced region within the β propeller acts as a switch to regulate trans-cellular adhesion of TEN2 to latrophilin (LPHN), a transmembrane receptor known to mediate critical functions in the central nervous system. One splice variant activates trans-cellular signaling in a LPHN-dependent manner, whereas the other induces inhibitory postsynaptic differentiation. These results highlight the unusual structural organization of TENs giving rise to their multifarious functions."

https://openalex.org/W2800910662,"Background Tuberculosis (TB) induces a systemic inflammatory state affecting iron homeostasis. Patients with TB often have additional comorbidities such as anemia which can result in poorer treat outcomes. We studied the contribution of anemia and the role of the iron regulatory hormone hepcidin among TB patients and household contacts. Methods We analyzed serum samples from 102 TB cases and 98 controls without TB, matched by age/sex, for hepcidin, iron, and inflammation parameters. Five controls developed TB within 12 months. We used linear regression to assess associations. Results Anemia of chronic disease (ACD) was more frequent among cases than controls (59.8% vs. 26.1%), but iron-deficiency anemia more frequent in controls (10% vs. 1%). The median hepcidin level was higher in cases than controls (63.7 vs. 14.2 ng/mL), but coinfections with HIV, helminths, and respiratory pathogens did not show cumulative effects. Hepcidin was associated with more severe TB symptom scoring (coefficient 0.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.5–1.2) and higher mycobacterial load (0.7, 95% CI 0.4–1.0). Hepcidin was higher in TB cases and controls who developed TB compared to controls without TB (p<0.001), even when restricting to HIV-negative study participants. Conclusions ACD was the predominate etiology in TB patients suggesting limited benefit from iron supplementation. Increased hepcidin levels long before active disease, indicating altered iron metabolism, may be a marker for developing disease among TB-exposed individuals. Clinical management of anemia and nutrition interventions in TB patients need to be considered to improve the clinical course and outcomes."

Data on demographic information, 24-hour dietary recalls, Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS), Eating Attitudes Test-26 (EAT-26), and anthropometric measurements were collected through face-to-face interviews. Overall, 11.4% of participants were identified as ""food addicted"" (F: 13.0%; M: 9.2%). Subjects meeting criteria for 'food addiction' had higher body mass index (35.1% were obese and 3.1% were underweight), compared to subjects without food addiction (13.1% were obese and 10.2% were underweight) (p<0.05). Abnormal eating attitudes estimated with EAT-26 were determined as 45.5% in males, 37.5% in females and 40.2% in total, among subjects with food addiction.

https://openalex.org/W2800482390,"You don’t have to sit in a self-driving Tesla to feel the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on your daily life. From voice-powered personal assistants like Alexa or Siri to help you track and organize information to tailored online shopping, AI is no longer in the realm of science fiction. Machine-learning platforms for clinical purposes are also making the headlines. Early last year, Stanford-based scientists harnessed a Google algorithm to classify skin cancers as accurately as board-certified dermatologists (Esteva et al., 2017Esteva A. Kuprel B. Novoa R.A. Ko J. Swetter S.M. Blau H.M. Thrun S. Dermatologist-level classification of skin cancer with deep neural networks.Nature. 2017; 542: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This algorithm distinguishes harmless from potentially fatal moles at an early stage, which is critical, given that melanoma is one of the deadliest cancers and its global incidence is on the rise. 2018 itself has already seen significant AI advances. These bring many unprecedented opportunities—and daunting challenges. “The eyes are a window to the heart”—we’ve all heard it before. While popular sayings are not meant to be taken literally, recent research suggests there may be some truth to this one. In collaboration with the Stanford School of Medicine, Google and its sister company, Verily Life Sciences, recently reported a deep-learning model that can recognize elevated cardiovascular disease risk from photographs of the retinal fundus (Poplin et al., 2018Poplin R. Varadarajan A.V. Blumer K. Liu Y. McConnell M.V. Corrado G.S. Peng L. Webster D.R. Prediction of cardiovascular risk factors from retinal fundus photographs via deep learning.Nat. Biomed. Eng. 2018; 2: 158-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Around the same time, a team of scientists from the University of California, San Diego, and Guangzhou University described an AI platform for the screening and diagnosis of common causes of severe vision loss at a stage where the diseases are still treatable. Further, the authors demonstrated the general applicability of their machine-learning system by showing its potential for diagnosing pediatric pneumonia using chest X-rays (Kermany et al., 2018Kermany D.S. Goldbaum M. Cai W. Valentim C.C.S. Liang H. Baxter S.L. McKeown A. Yang G. Wu X. Yan F. et al.Identifying Medical Diagnoses and Treatable Diseases by Image-Based Deep Learning.Cell. 2018; 172: 1122-1131.e9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2003) Google Scholar). Last month, a paper published in Nature Digital Medicine reported that computer vision can also be leveraged to interpret echocardiograms and does so at accuracies that exceed those of trained experts (Madani et al., 2018Madani A. Arnaout R. Mofrad M. Arnaout R. Fast and accurate view classification of echocardiograms using deep learning.NPJ Digit. Med. 2018; 1 (Published online March 21, 2018)https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-017-0013-1Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). While these developments nicely illustrate the potential for AI in imaged-based medical diagnosis, they are not completely unanticipated. It is well accepted that machines can be fed large amounts of data and be trained to recognize patterns much better than humans. What is surprising is the speed with which such potential is now being unleashed. Medical regulators have also started to open the doors for machine-learning algorithms. Earlier this year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared the healthcare company Viz to market its deep-learning technology to doctors and hospitals. The application in question, LVO Stroke System, uses an AI algorithm to analyze brain computed tomography (CT) scans from patients and sends a text notification to a neurovascular specialist if indicators associated with a stroke are detected. When brain cells start to suffer as a result of a stroke, the race against the clock begins. Earlier intervention can significantly decrease the extent of the damage and prevent disability. The approval of the Viz application is a step toward making healthcare more proficient and cost effective, but it was not the first time the FDA embraced this new era of intelligent care. In January 2017, the medical regulator approved for the first time the marketing of a machine learning application: Cardio DL from Arterys for diagnosing heart problems. Over the past year, several other applications were also granted FDA-marketing clearances, including a predictive platform that calculates the risk of patient deterioration to avoid unexpected deaths in hospitals and a smart watch designed to identify and monitor epileptic seizures. These and other recent FDA clearances are in line with the regulator’s effort to reform its approach to digital health regulation to encourage innovation and modernization. Some of these products have also obtained permission for commercialization in Europe, setting the stage for a worldwide competitive market for AI in healthcare. Deep learning also holds great potential for improving healthcare in remote communities and third-world countries, where medical resources are scarce. In fact, implementing AI in rural areas could have much more immediate impact for saving lives than in wealthier countries, so the benefits may easily outweigh the risks. While the question may no longer be whether AI will revolutionize the current health care system, but rather when and at what cost, one needs to beware of the AI hype too. In a time where the speed of medical science sometimes seems excruciatingly slow with technological, bureaucratic, and legal obstacles, the vibrant and fast-moving field of medical AI may feel like the promise of a blooming spring after a long Boston winter. But it’s important to acknowledge and discuss the limitations too. For instance, a proof-of-concept study published in JAMA Cardiology last month reported that a commercially available smartwatch can be coupled with a deep neural network to detect atrial fibrillation, which is a leading cause of stroke (Tison et al., 2018Tison G.H. Sanchez J.M. Ballinger B. Singh A. Olgin J.E. Pletcher M.J. Vittinghoff E. Lee E.S. Fan S.M. Gladstone R.A. et al.Passive Detection of Atrial Fibrillation Using a Commercially Available Smartwatch.JAMA Cardiol. 2018; (Published online March 21, 2018)https://doi.org/10.1001/jamacardio.2018.0136Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). While promising, further studies are required for optimizing this platform for rhythm assessment. Yet, despite the reported “moderate accuracy” and the author’s indication for the need of improvement, this development has been widely covered by the media and reported as a major success. What will it take to successfully translate AI platforms into wide clinical practice? Trusting Siri for restaurant recommendations is one thing, but should we rely on AI for important medical decisions? Platforms that provide transparent and interpretable explanations for the underlying complex computational steps will be essential for generating trust and acceptance from both healthcare providers and patients. Regardless of how, when, and where AI is implemented, there will be substantial social consequences to this. Regulatory agencies currently demand that AI applications perform at least as well as experienced physicians, but as the field develops, expectations for AI performance will inevitably become higher and higher. Machines already outperform humans in many different tasks—with the advantage that they don’t need coffee or sleep breaks. In fact, leading AI researchers believe that there is a 50% chance that machines will outperform humans in all tasks in 45 years (Grace et al., 2017Grace, K., Salvatier, J., Dafoe, A., Zhang, B., and Evans, O. (2017). When Will AI Exceed Human Performance? Evidence from AI Experts. arXiv, arXiv:1705.08807v2.Google Scholar). The possibility that machines will one day replace physicians, at least in some specialties, like radiology, seems therefore very real to some. But the immediate challenge is to integrate AI, and in particular, computer vision, with existing workforce and structures rather than replacing them. So for the time being, anyway, you will probably still have to keep your hand near the wheel of your Tesla."

Component changes in sweat derived from atopic dermatitis (AD) have been reported. To investigate the influence of sweat components on the pathogenesis of AD, we performed a multifaceted assessment, including nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy-based metabolomic analysis, and linked these features to clinical features of AD. Distinctive properties of AD sweat are the quite-variation in protein, anti-microbial peptides and glucose concentrations. pH, sodium, and other salt levels in sweat of AD were comparable to that of healthy subjects. Sweat from AD patients with acute inflammation had a more prominent increase in glucose concentration than sweat from healthy individuals or those with AD with chronic inflammation. Topical glucose application delayed recovery of transepidermal water loss in barrier-disrupted mice. Furthermore, the glucose transporter GLUT2 was highly expressed in the lumen of sweat glands from AD patients. AD patients with chronic inflammation had significantly increased GLUT2 mRNA expression and near normal sweat glucose levels. Despite the small sample size in our study, we speculate that the increased glucose levels might be affected by AD severity and phenotype. We hope that this report will bring novel insight into the impact of sweat components on the clinical manifestation of AD."

https://openalex.org/W2800987704,"Osteoblast differentiation is a highly regulated process that requires coordinated information from both soluble factors and the extracellular matrix. Among these extracellular stimuli, chemical and physical properties of the matrix are sensed through cell surface receptors such as integrins and transmitted into the nucleus to drive specific gene expression. Here, we showed that the conditional deletion of β1 integrins in the osteo-precursor population severely impacts bone formation and homeostasis both in vivo and in vitro. Mutant mice displayed a severe bone deficit characterized by bone fragility and reduced bone mass. We showed that β1 integrins are required for proper BMP2 dependent signaling at the pre-osteoblastic stage, by positively modulating Smad1/5-dependent transcriptional activity at the nuclear level. The lack of β1 integrins results in a transcription modulation that relies on a cooperative defect with other transcription factors rather than a plain blunted BMP2 response. Our results point to a nuclear modulation of Smad1/5 transcriptional activity by β1 integrins, allowing a tight control of osteoblast differentiation."

The association of the FTO polymorphisms with weight, height, BMI, BF%, and BM% was investigated.A haplotype of rs9930506, rs9930501, and rs9932754 (GGT) in the first intron of the FTO with complete linkage disequilibrium (LD) was found to be significantly associated with higher weight (OR = 1.32), BMI (OR = 5.36) and BF% (OR = 1.46), and lower BM% (OR = 3.59) (all P<0.001). None of the students with GGC genotypes were underweight, while all of the students with AAT genotypes had high muscle mass.A haplotype in the first intron of the FTO gene had a strong association with obesity indices in Iranian adolescent males. The FTO gene polymorphisms might have greater effects on anthropometric indices than what was previously imagined. Moreover, we suggested that the FTO gene exerted their effects on anthropometric measurements through haplotypes (and not single SNPs)."
https://openalex.org/W2801733636,"Coal mining has led to increasingly serious land subsidence, and the reclamation of the subsided land has become a hot topic of concern for governments and scholars. Soil quality of reclaimed land is the key indicator to the evaluation of the reclamation effect; hence, rapid monitoring and evaluation of reclaimed land is of great significance. Visible-near infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroscopy has been shown to be a rapid, timely and efficient tool for the prediction of soil organic carbon (SOC). In this study, 104 soil samples were collected from the Baodian mining area of Shandong province. Vis-NIR reflectance spectra and soil organic carbon content were then measured under laboratory conditions. The spectral data were first denoised using the Savitzky-Golay (SG) convolution smoothing method or the multiple scattering correction (MSC) method, after which the spectral reflectance (R) was subjected to reciprocal, reciprocal logarithm and differential transformations to improve spectral sensitivity. Finally, regression models for estimating the SOC content by the spectral data were constructed using partial least squares regression (PLSR). The results showed that: (1) The SOC content in the mining area was generally low (at the below-average level) and exhibited great variability. (2) The spectral reflectance increased with the decrease of soil organic carbon content. In addition, the sensitivity of the spectrum to the change in SOC content, especially that in the near-infrared band of the original reflectance, decreased when the SOC content was low. (3) The modeling results performed best when the spectral reflectance was preprocessed by Savitzky-Golay (SG) smoothing coupled with multiple scattering correction (MSC) and first-order differential transformation (modeling R2 = 0.86, RMSE = 2.00 g/kg, verification R2 = 0.78, RMSE = 1.81 g/kg, and RPD = 2.69). In addition, the first-order differential of R combined with SG, MSC with R, SG together with MSC and R also produced better modeling results than other pretreatment combinations. Vis-NIR modeling with specific spectral preprocessing methods could predict SOC content effectively."

Although several β-1,2-glucan–associated enzymes have been characterized, little is known about how β-1,2-glucan and its shorter oligosaccharides (Sopns) are captured and imported into the bacterial cell. Here, we report the biochemical and structural characteristics of the Sopn-binding protein (SO-BP, Lin1841) associated with the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter from the Gram-positive bacterium Listeria innocua. Calorimetric analysis revealed that SO-BP specifically binds to Sopns with a degree of polymerization of 3 or more, with Kd values in the micromolar range. The crystal structures of SO-BP in an unliganded open form and in closed complexes with tri-, tetra-, and pentaoligosaccharides (Sop3–5) were determined to a maximum resolution of 1.6 Å. The binding site displayed shape complementarity to Sopn, which adopted a zigzag conformation. We noted that water-mediated hydrogen bonds and stacking interactions play a pivotal role in the recognition of Sop3–5 by SO-BP, consistent with its binding thermodynamics. Computational free-energy calculations and a mutational analysis confirmed that interactions with the third glucose moiety of Sopns are significantly responsible for ligand binding. A reduction in unfavorable changes in binding entropy that were in proportion to the lengths of the Sopns was explained by conformational entropy changes. Phylogenetic and sequence analyses indicated that SO-BP ABC transporter homologs, glycoside hydrolases, and other related proteins are co-localized in the genomes of several bacteria. This study may improve our understanding of bacterial β-1,2-glucan metabolism and promote the discovery of unidentified β-1,2-glucan–associated proteins. β-1,2-Glucans are bacterial carbohydrates that exist in cyclic or linear forms and play an important role in infections and symbioses involving Gram-negative bacteria.

ABC transporters utilize the free energy obtained from ATP hydrolysis to import or export a wide variety of molecules across cellular membranes. They share a common architecture consisting of two transmembrane domains (TMDs) and intracellular nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs). In bacterial ABC importers, an additional domain, a solute (or substrate)-binding protein (SBP), serves as an initial receptor that specifically binds to ligands with high affinity, delivers them to TMDs, and stimulates the ATPase activity (1Davidson A.L.

SBPs from Gram-negative bacteria are located in the periplasm, whereas those from Gram-positive bacteria are anchored at the cell surface (2van der Heide T. Poolman B.

In general, the overall structure comprises two globular α/β domains consisting of a central β-sheet flanked by α-helices. The two domains are linked by a hinge, and ligand binding takes place between the two domains. In the absence of ligands, the two domains can move flexibly around the hinge, and an open conformation, in which the two domains are separated, is predominant (6Tang C. Schwieters C.D. Clore G.M. Open-to-closed transition in apo maltose-binding protein observed by paramagnetic NMR.Nature. 2007; 449 (17960247): 1078-108210.1038/nature06232Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, the two domains get close to each other and are stabilized in a closed conformation. This open-close conformational transition has been called the “Venus Fly Trap” mechanism (7Mao B. Pear M.R. McCammon J.A. Quiocho F.A. Hinge-bending in l-arabinose-binding protein.

Although many SBPs have been structurally and functionally characterized, full evaluations of many of them remain elusive because of the great diversity of their ligands. β-1,2-Glucan is an extracellular polysaccharide predominantly found in a cyclic form in the periplasmic space of the α-2 subdivision of proteobacteria, containing the plant pathogen Agrobacterium, the plant symbiote Rhizobium, and the mammalian pathogen Brucella (8Bohin J.-P.

Sophorose (Sop2) is a well-established powerful cellulase inducer of Trichoderma reesei (16Mandels M. Parrish F.W. Reese E.T. Sophorose as an inducer of cellulase in Trichoderma viride.J.

Despite the importance of their physiological roles, little is known about metabolic enzymes and proteins for β-1,2-glucans and Sopns because of their limited availability. We previously discovered the gene cluster involved in the dissimilation of Sopns in the Gram-positive bacteria Listeria innocua (Lin1838–1843) and characterized two cytosolic Sopns-degrading enzymes: 1,2-β-oligoglucan phosphorylase (Lin1839 and LiSOGP) and β-glucosidase (Lin1840). LiSOGP belongs to glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 94, catalyzing reversible phosphorolysis of Sopn (n ≥ 3) to release α-glucose 1-phosphate (17Nakajima M. Toyoizumi H. Abe K. Nakai H. Taguchi H. Kitaoka M. 1,2-β-Oligoglucan phosphorylase from Listeria innocua.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9 (24647662): e9235310.1371/journal.pone.0092353Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Lin1840 is a GH3 β-glucosidase exhibiting marked specificity toward Sop2 (18Nakajima M. Yoshida R. Miyanaga A. Abe K. Takahashi Y. Sugimoto N. Toyoizumi H. Nakai H. Kitaoka M. Taguchi H. Functional and structural analysis of a β-glucosidase involved in β-1,2-glucan metabolism in Listeria innocua.PLoS ONE. 2016; 11 (26886583): e014887010.1371/journal.pone.0148870Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A putative LacI family transcriptional regulator (Lin1838) is also co-localized in the cluster. Together with these gene products, putative ABC transporter components (Lin1841–1843) are encoded: Lin1841 and Lin1842–1843 encode an SBP and TMDs, respectively. However, it is unknown whether this transporter is responsible for uptake of Sopns. In this study, we focus on the Lin1841 protein to gain insights into the bacterial uptake of Sopn. We show that Lin1841 specifically binds to Sopns with a DP of 3 or more and clarify its binding thermodynamics and its structural basis by X-ray crystallography, isothermal calorimetry (ITC), and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The binding thermodynamic parameters of Lin1841 for various carbohydrates (list of ligands under “Experimental procedures”) were determined by ITC (Table 1 and Fig. 1). Among the tested oligosaccharides, tight interactions were observed for Sop3, Sop4, and Sop5, and their isotherms exhibited typical sigmoidal curves (Fig. 1, B–D). The binding constants (Ka) were on the order of 104–6 m−1, and the binding of Sop4 showed the highest affinity (Ka = 1.72 × 106 m−1 at 20 °C), which is in the same range as those of other SBPs (5Berntsson R.P. Smits S.H. Schmitt L. Slotboom D.J. Poolman B. A structural classification of substrate-binding proteins.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584 (20412802): 2606-261710.1016/j.febslet.2010.04.043Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). No heat pulses were observed for Sop2 (Fig. 1A), laminaritriose, cellotriose, gentiooligosaccharides, or maltotriose (data not shown), demonstrating that the Lin1841 protein is specific for Sopns with a DP ≥ 3. To date, no SBP that can bind to β-1,2-linked glucosides has been reported. The chain length specificity of Lin1841 is consistent with that of LiSOGP (17Nakajima M. Toyoizumi H. Abe K. Nakai H. Taguchi H. Kitaoka M. 1,2-β-Oligoglucan phosphorylase from Listeria innocua.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9 (24647662): e9235310.1371/journal.pone.0092353Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, we named Lin1841 the “Sopn-binding protein” (SO-BP). SO-BP also bound to larger linear β-1,2-glucans (average DP 25, Fig. 1E). The binding isotherm was not clear, likely due to impurity of the linear β-1,2-glucan sample. The affinity was estimated to be ∼10–1000-fold weaker than that of Sop3–5, indicating that SO-BP prefers oligosaccharides rather than polysaccharides. All binding interactions were enthalpy-driven with unfavorable entropy changes, and each of the stoichiometries (n) was almost 1:1. This slight deviation from a 1:1 stoichiometry may be due to impurities of Sopns. The favorable enthalpy changes increased with an increase in temperature and were not able to sufficiently compensate for increases of the entropic penalties, resulting in slight decreases of the Gibbs free energy change at higher temperatures (Table 1).Table 1Thermodynamic parameters of ligand bindingProteinLigandKaKdTΔG0ΔHTΔS0ΔCpn×106 m−1μm°Ckcal mol−1kcal mol−1kcal mol−1cal mol−1 K−1WTSop30.339 ± 0.0032.9515−7.29−23.3 ± 0.1−16.0−288 ± 430.909 ± 0.0010.174 ± 0.0015.7520−7.03−24.9 ± 0.1−17.90.901 ± 0.0020.0883 ± 0.000711.325−6.75−25.0 ± 0.1−18.30.866 ± 0.0020.0417 ± 0.000824.030−6.40−27.2 ± 0.3−20.80.937 ± 0.0090.0193 ± 0.000751.835−6.04−29.3 ± 0.9−23.30.870 ± 0.020D193A0.0201 ± 0.000549.825−5.87−24.8 ± 0.3−18.90.946 ± 0.007Q197A0.00434 ± 0.0002823025−4.96−11.7 ± 0.3−6.741.000aRegression analysis was performed with the fixed n value because the low affinity of the mutant protein limited the protein concentration setting of the titration experiment, resulting in the low c value (=n × protein concentration × Ka <1).WTSop41.72 ± 0.060.5820−8.36−18.8 ± 0.1−10.4−295 ± 201.150 ± 0.0021.34 ± 0.060.7525−8.36−20.2 ± 0.1−11.81.150 ± 0.0020.822 ± 0.0201.2230−8.20−22.0 ± 0.1−13.81.100 ± 0.0020.441 ± 0.0092.2735−7.96−23.1 ± 0.1−15.11.080 ± 0.002WTSop51.53 ± 0.070.6515−8.15−14.4 ± 0.1−6.25−194 ± 221.390 ± 0.0031.21 ± 0.040.8320−8.16−15.0 ± 0.1−6.841.110 ± 0.0020.762 ± 0.0201.3125−8.02−16.0 ± 0.1−7.981.130 ± 0.0020.442 ± 0.0102.2630−7.83−17.3 ± 0.1−9.471.120 ± 0.0020.232 ± 0.0064.3135−7.56−16.6 ± 0.1−9.041.210 ± 0.003WTβ-1,2-GlucanbThe molar concentration was calculated based on the average DP.

Open table in a new tab We also measured the change in the molar heat capacity with ligand binding (ΔCp) by plotting ΔH versus temperature to estimate the detailed binding thermodynamics of SO-BP (Fig. 1F). The ΔCp values for Sop3–5 were approximately −300 to −200 cal mol−1 K−1. A previous study showed that stacking interactions between one aromatic residue and one sugar ring give ΔCp values of −150 to −100 cal mol−1 K−1 (19Zolotnitsky G. Cogan U. Adir N. Solomon V. Shoham G. Shoham Y. Mapping glycoside hydrolase substrate subsites by isothermal titration calorimetry.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Therefore, it was predicted that two or three aromatic residues are involved in the stacking interactions with Sop3–5. The crystal structures of SO-BP in a ligand-free form and in complexes with Sop3, Sop4, and Sop5 were determined at 2.2 to 1.6 Å resolutions (Table 2). The asymmetric units of the crystals contained two molecules. The protein construct used for crystallization consisted of residues 26–422 without the signal peptide. There were no disordered regions in all protein structures, except for the N and C termini; residues 35–420 (ligand-free, chain A), 36–420 (ligand-free, chain B), 34–420 (Sop3 complex, chain A), 34–422 (Sop3 and Sop5 complex, chain B), 35–421 (Sop4 complex, chain A), 36–422 (Sop4 complex, chain B), and 34–421 (Sop5 complex, chains A and B) were modeled. The molecules in an asymmetric unit of each structure were virtually identical, with a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) for the Cα atoms of <0.2 Å. Hereafter, we focused on chain A. The overall structure of SO-BP adopts a typical SBP-fold consisting of two globular α/β domains as follows: N-terminal domain I (residues 34–145 and 301–349) and C-terminal domain II (residues 148–298 and 352–416) connected by hinge regions (residues 146–147, 299–300, and 350–351) (Fig. 2, A, B, and D). SO-BP is classified in structural cluster D-I of SBPs (5Berntsson R.P. Smits S.H. Schmitt L. Slotboom D.J. Poolman B. A structural classification of substrate-binding proteins.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584 (20412802): 2606-261710.1016/j.febslet.2010.04.043Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The complex structures with Sop3–5s could be overlaid well, with a r.m.s.d. of <0.4 Å relative to each other. When r.m.s.d. values were calculated separately for domains I and II, the r.m.s.d. values of the Cα atoms between the ligand-free and the Sop4 complex were 0.9 and 0.3 Å, respectively. In contrast, because of a large hinge motion between the ligand-free (open, Fig. 2A) and complex (closed, Fig. 2B) structures, attempts to overlay the whole protein in these two states provided Cα r.m.s.d. values above 1.6 Å. Superimposition of domain II clearly showed a hinge motion (Fig. 2C). A domain movement analysis using the DynDom server (20Hayward S. Berendsen H.J.

Although a part of the first α-helix (residues 44–47) of the open state deforms due to the absence of interactions between Glu-45 and the ligands (Fig. 3, B, D, and F), it is likely that the conformational change occurs through rigid body rotation, similar to other SBPs (21Sharff A.J. Rodseth L.E. Spurlino J.C. Quiocho F.A.

DALI structural homology search revealed that the structure of SO-BP in complex with Sop4 was most similar to Xac-MalE (a putative maltose/trehalose-binding protein, PDB code 3UOR) from Xanthomonas citri (Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri strain 306), with Z-score of 46.6, r.m.s.d. for the 386 Cα atoms of 3.2 Å, and a sequence identity of 34%. The other DALI hits included a trehalose/maltose-binding protein from Thermococcus litoralis (PDB code 1EU8; Z-score = 43.0, r.m.s.d. for the 373 Cα atoms = 2.3 Å, and sequence identity = 24%), the solute receptor GacH from Streptomyces glaucescens (PDB code 3K00; Z-score = 42.9, r.m.s.d. for the 370 Cα atoms = 2.2 Å, and sequence identity = 24%), and the solute-binding protein Lmo0181 from Listeria monocytogenes (PDB code 5F7V; Z-score = 41.8, r.m.s.d. for the 372 Cα atoms = 2.2 Å, and sequence identity = 20%).

Principal component analysis (PCA) was also performed to examine the conformational distribution in the MD trajectory (Fig. 2, E and F). We found two representative structures (state 1 and 2) based on PCA. State 1 (Fig. 2, E and F, shown in orange) was similar to the open state crystal structure (Cα r.m.s.d. <0.8 Å), whereas state 2 (shown in blue) was subtly different from the crystal structure (Cα r.m.s.d. >1.3 Å). The Cα r.m.s.d. value and the difference in the interdomain bend angle between states 1 and 2 were 1.1 Å and 8.8°, respectively. Moreover, a domain movement analysis using DynDom indicated that the bend angle difference between the closed state crystal structure and state 2 was 32.5°, suggesting that the ligand-free SO-BP can adopt a more open conformation in aqueous solution. The SO-BP structures obtained from co-crystals with Sop3–5s delineated the positions of the corresponding sugars at the center of the cleft enclosed by domains I and II. We defined glucose units of Sopn as A–E from the nonreducing end (Fig. 3, A, C and E). The complex structures showed that Sop3–5s adopt a zigzag conformation, bind to SO-BP in a similar manner, and share units from the nonreducing end. Units A and B are sequestered from solvent, whereas units at the reducing end (C–E in Sop3–5s) are exposed to solvent (Fig. 2B). Two tryptophan residues, Trp-71 and Trp-268, function in stacking with units A and B and the opposite side of unit B, respectively. This observation is in accordance with the ΔCp values of Sopns binding, as revealed by ITC (Table 1). Trp-97 forms hydrophobic interactions with the C6 hydroxymethyl group of unit A. Hydrogen bonds play a pivotal role in stabilizing the SO-BP–Sopn complexes (Fig. 3, B, D and F). Thr-95, Thr-96, Glu-147, and Gly-301 form hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups of unit A. Glu-45 and Tyr-145 form hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups of unit B. Asp-193 and Gln-197 form hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups at unit C. These interactions are shared among the Sopn-bound structures. In particular, the hydrogen bonds of Asp-193 and Gln-197 toward unit C appear to be indispensable for ligand binding because Sop2 was not able to bind to SO-BP (Fig. 1A). The anomeric hydroxyl group of the glucose moiety at unit D in the Sop4 complex forms a hydrogen bond with the N∈1 atom of Trp-268. The C4 hydroxyl group at unit E forms an additional hydrogen bond with the side chain of Ser-265. Eighteen-, 36-, and 21-ordered waters are found within 5 Å of Sop3–5s, respectively, and thus water-mediated hydrogen bonds also substantially contribute to the recognition of Sopns. These water molecules are held in place by hydrogen bonds with Met-42, Asp-44, Glu-45, Trp-71, Thr-95, Thr-96, Glu-147, Arg-149, Asp-193, Gln-195, Glu-196, Glu-197, Met-264, Trp-268, Gly-300, and Glu-377 (Fig. 3, B, D, and F). These features are in accordance with the enthalpy-driven binding modes of Sopns on SO-BP. In such a manner, the large decrease of enthalpy is attributed to formation of hydrogen bonds, and it compensates for unfavorable entropy changes due to the loss of freedom of water molecules, ligands, and proteins (22Jelesarov I. Bosshard H.R. Isothermal titration calorimetry and differential scanning calorimetry as complementary tools to investigate the energetics of biomolecular recognition.J. Mol. Recognit. 1999; 12 (10398392): 3-1810.1002/(SICI)1099-1352(199901/02)12:1%3C3::AID-JMR441%3E3.0.CO%3B2–6Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). To estimate the energetic contributions of interactions at unit C to the binding to SO-BP, the difference in free energy changes of binding (ΔΔG) was calculated based on MD simulations (Fig. 4). We first calculated the ΔΔG value between Sop3 and Sop2. This calculation demonstrated that binding of Sop3 was more energetically favorable than that of Sop2, with a ΔΔG of −3.59 ± 0.59 kcal mol−1 (Fig. 4, A and C). By subtracting the ΔΔG value from the binding free energy of Sop3 at 25 °C, the free energy change in Sop2 binding was estimated to be −3.16 kcal mol−1 (Ka = 2.08 × 102 m−1), which was below the detection limit of ITC. Indeed, no heat signal was observed in the titration of Sop2 (Fig. 1A). We also calculated the ΔΔG value between WT SO-BP and a Q197A mutant. To simply compare the effects of mutation, the ligand-free structures (WT and Q197A) were postulated to be in the closed form. The"
https://openalex.org/W2800921488,"The innate immune system is paramount in the response to and clearance of influenza A virus (IAV) infection in non-immune individuals. Known factors include type I and III interferons and antiviral pathogen recognition receptors, and the cascades of antiviral and pro- and anti-inflammatory gene expression they induce. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are increasingly recognized to participate in post-transcriptional modulation of these responses, but the temporal dynamics of how these players of the antiviral innate immune response collaborate to combat infection remain poorly characterized. We quantified the expression of miRNAs and protein coding genes in the lungs of pigs 1, 3, and 14 days after challenge with swine IAV (H1N2). Through RT-qPCR we observed a 400-fold relative increase in IFN-λ3 gene expression on day 1 after challenge, and a strong interferon-mediated antiviral response was observed on days 1 and 3 accompanied by up-regulation of genes related to the pro-inflammatory response and apoptosis. Using small RNA sequencing and qPCR validation we found 27 miRNAs that were differentially expressed after challenge, with the highest number of regulated miRNAs observed on day 3. In contrast, the number of protein coding genes found to be regulated due to IAV infection peaked on day 1. Pulmonary miRNAs may thus be aimed at fine-tuning the initial rapid inflammatory response after IAV infection. Specifically, we found five miRNAs (ssc-miR-15a, ssc-miR-18a, ssc-miR-21, ssc-miR-29b, and hsa-miR-590-3p)-four known porcine miRNAs and one novel porcine miRNA candidate-to be potential modulators of viral pathogen recognition and apoptosis. A total of 11 miRNAs remained differentially expressed 14 days after challenge, at which point the infection had cleared. In conclusion, the results suggested a role for miRNAs both during acute infection as well as later, with the potential to influence lung homeostasis and susceptibility to secondary infections in the lungs of pigs after IAV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2802226810,"There is evidence that altering stress mindset—the belief that stress is enhancing vs. debilitating—can change cognitive, affective and physiological responses to stress. However individual differences in responsiveness to stress mindset manipulations have not been explored. Given the previously established role of catecholamines in both placebo effects and stress, we hypothesized that genetic variation in catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), an enzyme that metabolizes catecholamines, would moderate responses to an intervention intended to alter participants’ mindsets about stress. Participants (N = 107) were exposed to a stress mindset manipulation (videos highlighting either the enhancing or debilitating effects of stress) prior to engaging in a Trier Social Stress task and subsequent cognitive tasks. The associations of the COMT rs4680 polymorphism with the effect of stress mindset video manipulations on cognitive and affective responses were examined. Genetic variation at rs4680 modified the effects of stress mindset on affective and cognitive responses to stress. Individuals homozygous for rs4680 low-activity allele (met/met) were responsive to the stress-is-enhancing mindset manipulation as indicated by greater increases in positive affect, improved cognitive functioning, and happiness bias in response to stress. Conversely, individuals homozygous for the high-activity allele (val/val) were not as responsive to the stress mindset manipulation. These results suggest that responses to stress mindset intervention may vary with COMT genotype. These findings contribute to the understanding of gene by environment interactions for mindset interventions and stress reactivity and therefore warrant further investigations."
https://openalex.org/W2767706897,"The molecular mechanisms underlying susceptibility to severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection remain poorly understood. Herein, we report on the role of osteopontin (OPN) in regulation of RSV infection in human epithelial cells and how interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), a cytokine secreted soon after RSV infection, when persistently expressed can induce OPN expression leading to increased viral infection. We first compared OPN expression in two human epithelial cell lines: HEK-293 and HEp-2. In contrast to HEp-2, HEK-293 expresses low levels of pro-caspase-1 resulting in decreased IL-1β expression in response to RSV infection. We found a correlation between low IL-1β levels and a delay in induction of OPN expression in RSV-infected HEK-293 cells compared to HEp-2. This phenomenon could partially explain the high susceptibility of HEp-2 cells to RSV infection versus the moderate susceptibility of HEK-293 cells. Also, HEK-293 cells expressing low levels of pro-caspase-1 exhibit decreased IL-1β expression and delayed OPN expression in response to RSV infection. HEK-293 cells incubated with human rIL-1β showed a dose-dependent increase in OPN expression upon RSV infection. Also, incubation with rOPN increased RSV viral load. Moreover, HEp-2 cells or mice infected with a mucogenic RSV strain RSV-L19F showed elevated levels of OPN in contrast to mice infected with the laboratory RSV strain rA2. This correlated with elevated levels of OPN following infection with RSV-L19F compared to rA2. Together, these results demonstrate that increased OPN expression is regulated in part by IL-1β, and the interplay between IL-1β and OPN signaling may play a pivotal role in the spread of RSV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2799333636,"Differentiation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) is critical for proper vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling SMC differentiation are not completely understood. During embryogenesis, the transcription factor mesenchyme homeobox 1 (Meox1) is expressed in the early developing somite, which is one of the origins of SMCs. In the present study, we identified Meox1 as a positive regulator of SMC differentiation. We found that transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) induces Meox1 expression in the initial phase of SMC differentiation of pluripotent murine C3H10T1/2 cells. shRNA-mediated Meox1 knockdown suppressed TGF-β-induced expression of SMC early markers, whereas Meox1 overexpression increased expression of these markers. Mechanistically, Meox1 promoted SMAD family member 3 (Smad3) nuclear retention during the early stage of TGF-β stimulation because Meox1 inhibited protein phosphatase Mg2+/Mn2+-dependent 1A (PPM1A) and thereby prevented PPM1A-mediated Smad3 dephosphorylation. Meox1 appears to promote PPM1A degradation, leading to sustained Smad3 phosphorylation, thus allowing Smad3 to stimulate SMC gene transcription. In vivo, Meox1 knockdown in mouse embryos impaired SMC marker expression in the descending aorta of neonatal mice, indicating that Meox1 is essential for SMC differentiation during embryonic development. In summary, the transcriptional regulator Meox1 controls TGF-β-induced SMC differentiation from mesenchymal progenitor cells by preventing PPM1A-mediated Smad3 dephosphorylation, thereby supporting SMC gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2800658455,"The relationship between body height and the risk of non‒communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease and cancer has been the subject of much debate in the epidemiological literature. Concerns have recently arisen over spurious associations due to confounding factors like birth cohort, especially in the context of epidemiological transition. The population of Sardinia represents an interesting case study, as the average physical stature of inhabitants was the lowest recorded in Europe until a few decades ago. In this population we tested whether height is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and cancer. We analysed the stature of 10,427 patients undergoing endoscopy for any reason, for whom a detailed clinical history of cardiovascular disease and/or malignancies had been documented. Poisson regression modelling was used to test the association between stature and disease risk. When patients were subdivided according to sex and height tertiles, the risk of cardiovascular disease proved significantly greater for subjects in the lowest tertile irrespective of sex (men: 1.87; 95%CI 1.41‒2.47; women: 1.23; 95%CI 0.92‒1.66) and smaller for those in the highest tertile (men: 0.51; 95%CI 0.35‒0.75; women: 0.41; 95%CI 0.27‒0.61). However, after adjusting the risk for birth cohort and established risk factors, it mostly resulted in non-significant values, although the overall trend persisted. Similar results were obtained for all-cancer risk (relative risk for men and women in the lowest tertile: 1.44; 95%CI 1.09-1.90 and 1.17; 95%CI 0.93-1.48, in the highest tertile: 0.51; 95%CI 0.36-0.72 and 0.62; 95%CI 0.47-0.81, respectively) as well as for some of the most common types of cancer. We concluded that the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and malignancies does not vary significantly with stature in the Sardinian population, after adjusting for birth cohort and more obvious risk factors."

This paper presents the results of research intended to develop a novel method to quantify the distance between maize plants at field scale using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Using this method, we can recognize maize plants as objects and calculate the distance between plants. We initially developed our method by training an algorithm in an indoor facility with plastic corn plants. Then, the method was scaled up and tested in a farmer’s field with maize plant spacing that exhibited natural variation. The results of this study demonstrate that it is possible to precisely quantify the distance between maize plants. We found that accuracy of the measurement of the distance between maize plants depended on the height above ground level at which UAV imagery was taken. This study provides an innovative approach to quantify plant-to-plant variability and, thereby final crop yield estimates."
https://openalex.org/W2801938673,"Vanillin (4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde), a food additive with rich milk flavor, is commonly used in the food, beverage and cosmetic industries. However, excessive consumption of vanillin may cause liver and kidney damage. Therefore, methods for detecting and controlling the level of vanillin in food, especially in infant powder, have important practical significance. In this study, we established a colorimetric assay for vanillin detection. The detection was performed under high-temperature and acidic conditions, which can induce the reaction of the aldehyde group of vanillin with the amino group of o-toluidine. The resulting product had a maximum absorption at 363 nm, which was quantified by a UV spectrophotometer. This assay had a limit of detection (LOD) of 1 pg mL-1 and a linear range between 1 μg mL-1 and 100 μg mL-1. The average recoveries at three spiked levels were in the range from 91.1% to 101.6% with a relative standard deviation (RSD) of 4.62% ~ 7.27%."
https://openalex.org/W2800315938,"We derive a novel model-based metric for effective adherence to medication, and validate it using data from the INhaler Compliance Assessment device (INCATM). This technique employs dose timing data to estimate the threshold drug concentration needed to maintain optimal health.The parameters of the model are optimised against patient outcome data using maximum likelihood methods. The model is fitted and validated by secondary analysis of two independent datasets from two remote-monitoring studies of adherence, conducted through clinical research centres of 5 Irish hospitals. Training data came from a cohort of asthma patients (~ 47,000 samples from 218 patients). Validation data is from a cohort of 204 patients with COPD recorded between 2014 and 2016.The time above threshold measure is strongly predictive of adverse events (exacerbations) in COPD patients (Odds Ratio of exacerbation = 0.52 per SD increase in adherence, 95% Confidence Interval [0.34-0.79]). This compares well with the best known previous method, the Area Under the dose-time Curve (AUC) (Odds Ratio = 0.69, 95% Confidence Interval [0.48-0.99]). In addition, the fitted value of the dose threshold (0.56 of prescribed dosage) suggests that prescribed doses may be unnecessarily high given good adherence.The resulting metric accounts for missed doses, dose-timing errors, and errors in inhaler technique, and provides enhanced predictive validity in comparison to previously used measures. In addition, the method allows us to estimate the correct dosage required to achieve the effect of the medication using the patients' own adherence data and outcomes. The adherence score does depend not on sex or other demographic factors suggesting that effective adherence is driven by individual behavioural factors."
https://openalex.org/W2799933443,"It has been proposed that NADP+-specificity of isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) evolved as an adaptation of microorganisms to grow on acetate as the sole source of carbon and energy. In Escherichia coli, changing the cofactor specificity of ICDH from NADP+ to NAD+ (cofactor swapping) decreases the growth rate on acetate. However, the metabolic basis of this phenotype has not been analyzed. In this work, we used constraint-based modeling to investigate the effect of the cofactor swapping of ICDH in terms of energy production, response of alternative sources of NADPH, and partitioning of fluxes between ICDH and isocitrate lyase (ICL) -a crucial bifurcation when the bacterium grows on acetate-. We generated E. coli strains expressing NAD+-specific ICDH instead of the native enzyme, and bearing the deletion of the NADPH-producing transhydrogenase PntAB. We measured their growth rate and acetate uptake rate, modeled the distribution of metabolic fluxes by Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), and quantified the specific activities of NADPH-producing dehydrogenases in central pathways. The cofactor swapping of ICDH led to one-third decrease in biomass yield, irrespective of the presence of PntAB. According to our simulations, the diminution in growth rate observed upon cofactor swapping could be explained by one-half decrease in the total production of NADPH and a lower availability of carbon for biosynthesis because of a change in the partition at the isocitrate bifurcation. Together with an increased total ATP production, this scenario resulted in a 10-fold increment in the flux of ATP not used for growing purposes. PntAB was identified as the primary NADPH balancing response, with the dehydrogenases of the oxidative branch of the Pentose Phosphate Pathway and the malic enzyme playing a role in its absence. We propose that in the context of E. coli growing on acetate, the NADP+-specificity of ICDH is a trait that impacts not only NADPH production, but also the efficient allocation of carbon and energy."
https://openalex.org/W2800288789,"MRI is the optimal method for sensitive detection of tumour tissue and pre-operative staging in oral cancer. When jawbone resections are necessary, the current standard of care for oral tumour surgery in our hospital is 3D virtual planning from CT data. 3D printed jawbone cutting guides are designed from the CT data. The tumour margins are difficult to visualise on CT, whereas they are clearly visible on MRI scans. The aim of this study was to change the conventional CT-based workflow by developing a method for 3D MRI-based lower jaw models. The MRI-based visualisation of the tumour aids in planning bone resection margins.A workflow for MRI-based 3D surgical planning with bone cutting guides was developed using a four-step approach. Key MRI parameters were defined (phase 1), followed by an application of selected Black Bone MRI sequences on healthy volunteers (phase 2). Three Black Bone MRI sequences were chosen for phase 3: standard, fat saturated, and an out of phase sequence. These protocols were validated by applying them on patients (n = 10) and comparison to corresponding CT data. The mean deviation values between the MRI- and the CT-based models were 0.63, 0.59 and 0.80 mm for the three evaluated Black Bone MRI sequences. Phase 4 entailed examination of the clinical value during surgery, using excellently fitting printed bone cutting guides designed from MRI-based lower jaw models, in two patients with oral cancer. The mean deviation of the resection planes was 2.3 mm, 3.8 mm for the fibula segments, and the mean axis deviation was the fibula segments of 1.9°.This study offers a method for 3D virtual resection planning and surgery using cutting guides based solely on MRI imaging. Therefore, no additional CT data are required for 3D virtual planning in oral cancer surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2800324871,"Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous population of immature myeloid progenitor cells that are expanded in cancer and act as potent suppressors of the anti-tumor immune response. MDSCs consist of two major subsets, namely monocytic (M-) MDSCs and granulocytic (G-) MDSCs that differ with respect to their phenotype, morphology and mechanisms of suppression. Here, we cultured bone marrow cells with IL-6 and GM-CSF in vitro to generate a population of bone marrow MDSCs (BM-MDSCs) similar to G-MDSCs from tumor-bearing mice in regards to phenotype, morphology and suppressive-function. Through fluorescent labeling of these BM-MDSCs and optical imaging, we could visualize the recruitment and localization of BM-MDSCs in breast tumor-bearing mice in vivo. Furthermore, we were able to demonstrate that BM-MDSCs home to primary and metastatic breast tumors, but have no significant effect on tumor growth or progression. Ex vivo flow cytometry characterization of BM-MDSCs after adoptive transfer demonstrated both organ-and tumor-specific effects on their phenotype and differentiation, demonstrating the importance of the local microenvironment on MDSC fate and function. In this study, we have developed a method to generate, visualize and detect BM-MDSCs in vivo and ex vivo through optical imaging and flow cytometry, in order to understand the organ-specific changes rendered to MDSCs in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2802602517,"Objective To study the performance of multifocal-visual-evoked-potential (mfVEP) signals filtered using empirical mode decomposition (EMD) in discriminating, based on amplitude, between control and multiple sclerosis (MS) patient groups, and to reduce variability in interocular latency in control subjects. Methods MfVEP signals were obtained from controls, clinically definitive MS and MS-risk progression patients (radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS) and clinically isolated syndrome (CIS)). The conventional method of processing mfVEPs consists of using a 1–35 Hz bandpass frequency filter (XDFT). The EMD algorithm was used to decompose the XDFT signals into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). This signal processing was assessed by computing the amplitudes and latencies of the XDFT and IMF signals (XEMD). The amplitudes from the full visual field and from ring 5 (9.8–15° eccentricity) were studied. The discrimination index was calculated between controls and patients. Interocular latency values were computed from the XDFT and XEMD signals in a control database to study variability. Results Using the amplitude of the mfVEP signals filtered with EMD (XEMD) obtains higher discrimination index values than the conventional method when control, MS-risk progression (RIS and CIS) and MS subjects are studied. The lowest variability in interocular latency computations from the control patient database was obtained by comparing the XEMD signals with the XDFT signals. Even better results (amplitude discrimination and latency variability) were obtained in ring 5 (9.8–15° eccentricity of the visual field). Conclusions Filtering mfVEP signals using the EMD algorithm will result in better identification of subjects at risk of developing MS and better accuracy in latency studies. This could be applied to assess visual cortex activity in MS diagnosis and evolution studies."
https://openalex.org/W2800509900,"We report a computational model for the assembly of HIV-1 Gag into immature viral particles at the plasma membrane. To reproduce experimental structural and kinetic properties of assembly, a process occurring on the order of minutes, a coarse-grained representation consisting of a single particle per Gag molecule is developed. The model uses information relating the functional interfaces implicated in Gag assembly, results from cryo electron-tomography, and biophysical measurements from fluorescence microscopy, such as the dynamics of Gag assembly at single virions. These experimental constraints eliminated many classes of potential interactions, and narrowed the model to a single interaction scheme with two non-equivalent interfaces acting to form Gags into a hexamer, and a third interface acting to link hexamers together. This model was able to form into a hexameric structure with correct lattice spacing and reproduced biologically relevant growth rates. We explored the effect of genomic RNA seeding punctum growth, finding that RNA may be a factor in locally concentrating Gags to initiate assembly. The simulation results infer that completion of assembly cannot be governed simply by Gag binding kinetics. However the addition of membrane curvature suggests that budding of the virion from the plasma membrane could factor into slowing incorporation of Gag at an assembly site resulting in virions of the same size and number of Gag molecules independent of Gag concentration or the time taken to complete assembly. To corroborate the results of our simulation model, we developed an analytic model for Gag assembly finding good agreement with the simulation results."

In this study, we conducted a precipitation manipulation experiment to investigate the changes in water-use patterns of two coexisting species (Achnatherum splendens and Allium tanguticum) to alterations in soil water content (SWC) resulting from increased and decreased rainfall treatments. The results showed that the leaf water potential (Ψ) of A. splendens and A. tanguticum responded to changes in shallow and middle SWC at both the control and treatment plots. However, A. splendens proportionally extracted water from the shallow soil layer (0-10cm) when it was available but shifted to absorbing deep soil water (30-60 cm) during drought. By contrast, the A. tanguticum did not differ significantly in uptake depth between treatment and control plots but entirely depended on water from shallow soil layers. The flexible water-use patterns of A.splendens may be a key factor facilitating its dominance and it better acclimates the recent climate change in the alpine grassland community around Qinghai Lake."
https://openalex.org/W2799666976,"Background In a study conducted in Bhopal district (a setting with facility for molecular drug susceptibility testing (DST)) located in central India in 2014–15, we found high levels of pre-diagnosis attrition among patients with presumptive multi drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB)–meaning TB patients who were eligible for DST, were not being tested. Objectives In this study, we explored the health care provider perspectives into barriers and suggested solutions for improving DST. Methods This was a descriptive qualitative study. One to one interviews (n = 10) and focus group discussions (n = 2) with experienced key informants involved in programmatic management of DR-TB were conducted in April 2017. Manual descriptive thematic analysis was performed. Results The key barriers reported were a) lack of or delay in identification of patients eligible for DST because of using treatment register as the source for identifying patients b) lack of assured specimen transport after patient identification and c) lack of tracking. Extra pulmonary TB patients were not getting identified as eligible for DST. Solutions suggested by the health care providers were i) generation of unique identifier at identification in designated microscopy center (DMC), immediate intimation of unique identifier to district and regular monitoring by senior TB laboratory and senior treatment supervisors of patients eligible for DST that were missed; ii) documentation of unique identifier at each step of cascade; iii) use of human carriers/couriers to transport specimen from DMCs especially in rural areas; and iv) routine entry of all presumptive extra-pulmonary TB specimen, as far as possible, in DMC laboratory register. Conclusion Lack of assured specimen transport and lack of accountability for tracking patient after identification and referral were the key barriers. The identification of patients eligible for DST among microbiologically confirmed TB at the time of diagnosis and among clinically confirmed TB at the time of treatment initiation is the key. Use of unique identifier at identification and its use to ensure cohort wise tracking has to be complemented with specimen transport support and prompt feedback to the DMC. The study has implications to improve detection of MDR-TB among diagnosed/notified TB patients."
https://openalex.org/W2800695218,"Introduction Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is characterized by enhanced pulmonary vascular resistance, which causes right ventricle (RV) pressure overload and results in right sided heart failure and death. This work investigated the effectiveness of a combined therapy with PDE5 inhibitor (PDE5i) and a new adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) agonist in mitigating monocrotaline (MCT) induced PH in rats. Methods An in vitro isobolographic analysis was performed to identify possible synergistic relaxation effect between sildenafil and LASSBio 1359 in rat pulmonary arteries (PAs). In the in vivo experiments, PH was induced in male Wistar rats by a single intraperitoneal injection of 60 mg/kg MCT. Rats were divided into the following groups: control (saline injection only), MCT + vehicle, MCT + sildenafil, MCT + LASSBio 1359 and MCT + combination of sildenafil and LASSBio 1359. Fourteen days after the MCT injection, rats were treated daily with oral administration of the regimen therapies or vehicle for 14 days. Cardiopulmonary system function and structure were evaluated by echocardiography. RV systolic pressure and PA endothelial function were measured. Results Isobolographic analysis showed a synergistic interaction between sildenafil and LASSBio 1359 in rat PAs. Combined therapy with sildenafil and LASSBio 1359 but not monotreatment with low dosages of either sildenafil or LASSBio 1359 ameliorated all of PH related abnormalities in cardiopulmonary function and structure in MCT challenged rats. Conclusions The combination of sildenafil and LASSBio 1359 has a synergistic interaction, suggesting that combined use of these pharmacological targets may be an alternative to improve quality of life and outcomes for PH patients."
https://openalex.org/W2802321320,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has short- and long- term influence on pregnant women and fetus. Swimming, as an aerobic exercise, can effectively improve the blood glucose level in GDM, but the effect of mild swimming alone was not very substantial. Metformin, as an oral antidiabetic drug, has obvious hypoglycemic effect, and is economic also, but the long-term effect on pregnant women and fetus has not been completely clear. We hypothesize that combined intervention of mild swimming and low dose of metformin, may effectively reduce blood glucose, improve the pregnancy outcomes in GDM dams, but simultaneously avoiding the adverse effects caused by overdose of drug and impotence of mild swimming. The streptozotocin was used to stimulate C57BL/6J mice to develop GDM, by which serum glucose, TC, TG, LDL-C were increased significantly, meanwhile HDL-C was decreased significantly in the GDM control (DC) group compared with the normal control group. Swimming or metformin intervention slightly or moderately improves hyperglycemia, insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism both in liver and skeletal muscle from GDM mice, while combined therapy of swimming plus metformin markedly ameliorated hyperglycemia (FPG, decreased by 22.2–59.5% from G10 to G18 versus DC group), insulin sensitivity (2.1 and 2.8 fold increase, respectively, in AKT activity versus DC group) and de novo lipogenesis (3.2 and 7.0 fold decrease, respectively, in ACC activity, and 1.94 and 5.1 fold decrease, respectively, in SREBP2 level, versus DC group) both in liver and skeletal muscle from GDM mice. We conclude that the combined intervention by metformin plus swimming may be more effective than single action to ameliorate glucose and lipid metabolism via improving insulin sensitivity in GDM mice."
https://openalex.org/W2799461304,"The Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) is widely used to evaluate processing speed and executive function in patients with multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, and other neurological disorders. In the PASAT, subjects listen to sequences of digits while continuously reporting the sum of the last two digits presented. Four different stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) are usually tested, with difficulty increasing as SOAs are reduced. Ceiling effects are common at long SOAs, while the digit delivery rate often exceeds the subject’s processing capacity at short SOAs, causing some subjects to stop performing altogether. In addition, subjects may adopt an “alternate answer” strategy at short SOAs, which reduces the test’s demands on working-memory and processing speed. Consequently, studies have shown that the number of dyads (consecutive correct answers) is a more sensitive measure of PASAT performance than the overall number of correct sums. Here, we describe a 2.5-minute computerized test, the Dyad-Adaptive PASAT (DA-PASAT), where SOAs are adjusted with a 2:1 staircase, decreasing after each pair of correct responses and increasing after misses. Processing capacity is reflected in the minimum SOA (minSOA) achieved in 54 trials. Experiment 1 gathered normative data in two large populations: 1617 subjects in New Zealand ranging in age from 18 to 65 years, and 214 Californians ranging in age from 18 to 82 years. Minimum SOAs were influenced by age, education, and daily hours of computer-use. Minimum SOA z-scores, calculated after factoring out the influence of these factors, were virtually identical in the two control groups, as were response times (RTs) and dyad ratios (the proportion of hits occurring in dyads). Experiment 2 measured the test-retest reliability of the DA-PASAT in 44 young subjects who underwent three test sessions at weekly intervals. High intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were found for minSOAs (0.87), response times (0.76), and dyad ratios (0.87). Performance improved across test sessions for all measures. Experiment 3 investigated the effects of simulated malingering in 50 subjects: 42% of simulated malingerers produced abnormal (p< 0.05) minSOA z-scores. Simulated malingerers with abnormal scores were distinguished with 87% sensitivity and 69% specificity from control subjects with abnormal scores by excessive differences between training performance and the actual test. Experiment 4 investigated patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI): patients with mild TBI performed within the normal range while patients with severe TBI showed deficits. The DA-PASAT reduces the time and stress of PASAT assessment while gathering sensitive measures of dyad processing that reveal the effects of aging, malingering, and traumatic brain injury on performance."
https://openalex.org/W2802099634,"Many important applications continuously generate data, such as financial transaction administration, satellite monitoring, network flow monitoring, and web information processing. The data mining results are always evolving with the newly generated data. Obviously, for the clustering task, it is better to incrementally update the new clustering results based on the old data rather than to recluster all of the data from scratch. The incremental clustering approach is an essential way to solve the problem of clustering with growing Big Data. This paper proposes a boundary-profile-based incremental clustering (BPIC) method to find arbitrarily shaped clusters with dynamically growing datasets. This method represents the existing clustering results with a collection of boundary profiles and discards the inner points of clusters rather than keep all data. It greatly saves both time and space storage costs. To identify the boundary profile, this paper presents a boundary-vector-based boundary point detection (BV-BPD) algorithm that summarizes the structure of the existing clusters. The BPIC method processes each new point in an online fashion and updates the clustering results in a batch mode. When a new point arrives, the BPIC method either immediately labels it or temporarily puts it into a bucket according to the relationship between the new data and the boundary profiles. A bucket is employed to distinguish the noise from the potential seeds of new clusters and alleviate the effects of data order. When the bucket is full, the BPIC method will cluster the data within it and update the clustering results. Thus, the BPIC method is insensitive to noise and the order of new data, which is critical for the robustness of the incremental clustering process. In the experiments, the performance of the boundary point detection algorithm BV-BPD is compared with the state-of-the-art method. The results show that the BV-BPD is better than the state-of-the-art method. Additionally, the performance of BPIC and other two incremental clustering methods are investigated in terms of clustering quality, time and space efficiency. The experimental results indicate that the BPIC method is able to get a qualified clustering result on a large dataset with higher time and space efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2802465782,"Despite the widespread acceptance of rotary blood pump (RBP) in clinical use over the past decades, the diminished flow pulsatility generated by a fixed speed RBP has been regarded as a potential factor that may lead to adverse events such as vasculature stiffening and hemorrhagic strokes. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of generating physiological pulse pressure in the pulmonary circulation by modulating the speed of a right ventricular assist device (RVAD) in a mock circulation loop. A rectangular pulse profile with predetermined pulse width has been implemented as the pump speed pattern with two different phase shifts (0% and 50%) with respect to the ventricular contraction. In addition, the performance of the speed modulation strategy has been assessed under different cardiovascular states, including variation in ventricular contractility and pulmonary arterial compliance. Our results indicated that the proposed pulse profile with optimised parameters (Apulse = 10000 rpm and ωmin = 3000 rpm) was able to generate pulmonary arterial pulse pressure within the physiological range (9–15 mmHg) while avoiding undesirable pump backflow under both co- and counter-pulsation modes. As compared to co-pulsation, stroke work was reduced by over 44% under counter-pulsation, suggesting that mechanical workload of the right ventricle can be efficiently mitigated through counter-pulsing the pump speed. Furthermore, our results showed that improved ventricular contractility could potentially lead to higher risk of ventricular suction and pump backflow, while stiffening of the pulmonary artery resulted in increased pulse pressure. In conclusion, the proposed speed modulation strategy produces pulsatile hemodynamics, which is more physiologic than continuous blood flow. The findings also provide valuable insight into the interaction between RVAD speed modulation and the pulmonary circulation under various cardiovascular states."
https://openalex.org/W2801157462,"The distinct functions of each cyclooxygenase (COX) isoform in renal homeostasis have been the subject of intense investigation for many years. We took the novel approach of using 3 characterized mouse lines, where the prostaglandin (PG)-endoperoxide synthase genes 1 and 2 ( Ptgs1 and Ptgs2) substitute for one another to delineate distinct roles and the potential for COX isoform substitution. Flipped Ptgs genes generate a reversed COX-expression pattern in the kidney, where the knockin COX-2 is highly expressed. Normal nephrogenesis was sustained in all 3 strains at the postnatal stage d 8 (P8). Knockin COX-1 can temporally restore renal function and delay but not prevent renal pathology consequent to COX-2 deletion. Loss of COX-2 in adult COX-1 > COX-2 mice results in severe nephropathy, which leads to impaired renal function. These defects are partially rescued by the knockin COX-2 in Reversa mice, whereas COX-2 can compensate for the loss of COX-1 in COX-2 > COX-1 mice. Intriguingly, the highly expressed knockin COX-2 enzyme barely makes any PGs or thromboxane in neonatal P8 or adult mice, demonstrating that prostanoid biosynthesis requires native COX-1 and cannot be rescued by the knockin COX-2. In summary, the 2 COX isoforms can preferentially compensate for some renal functions, which appears to be independent of the PG-synthetic capacity.-Li, X., Mazaleuskaya, L. L., Ballantyne, L. L., Meng, H., FitzGerald, G. A., Funk, C. D. Differential compensation of two cyclooxygenases in renal homeostasis is independent of prostaglandin-synthetic capacity under basal conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2802052629,"C-C motif chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) is a cell surface–associated, immune-regulatory G protein–coupled receptor (GCPR) with seven transmembrane helices. We previously reported the isolation and initial characterization of short artificial transmembrane protein aptamers, named “traptamers,” that specifically down-regulate CCR5 expression and inhibit infection of human T cells by HIV strains that use CCR5 as a co-receptor. Here, we investigated the mechanism of traptamer-mediated CCR5 down-regulation and show that most of the traptamers (designated class 1 traptamers) form a stable complex with CCR5 and target it for lysosome-mediated degradation. The ability of these traptamers to down-regulate CCR5 depended on Lys197 in the fifth transmembrane helix of CCR5. In the absence of traptamers, substitution of Lys197 to an uncharged amino acid increased CCR5 stability, and introduction of a lysine at the homologous position in CCR2b, a related chemokine receptor, decreased CCR2b levels. The prototypic class 2 traptamer BY6M4 also formed a complex with CCR5, but CCR5 down-regulation caused by class 2 traptamers did not depend on the lysosome or on Lys197. These results demonstrate that traptamers use diverse mechanisms to down-regulate CCR5 and identify a specific amino acid that plays a central role in controlling chemokine receptor stability. Further studies of these traptamers are likely to provide new insights into CCR5 metabolism and biology and may suggest new therapeutic approaches to modulate the levels of CCR5 and other GPCRs.

https://openalex.org/W2801992762,"Helicobacter pylori HP0377 is a thiol oxidoreductase, a member of the CcmG family involved in cytochrome biogenesis, as previously shown by in vitro experiments. In this report, we document that HP0377 also acts in vivo in the cytochrome assembly process in Bacillus subtilis, where it complements the lack of ResA. However, unlike other characterized proteins in this family, HP0377 is a dithiol reductase and isomerase. We elucidated how the amino acid composition of its active site modulates its functionality. We demonstrated that cis-proline (P156) is involved in its interaction with the redox partner (CcdA), as a P156T HP0377 variant is inactive in vivo and is present in the oxidized form in B. subtilis. Furthermore, we showed that engineering the HP0377 active motif by changing CSYC motif into CSYS or SSYC, clearly diminishes two activities (reduction and isomerization) of the protein. Whereas HP0377CSYA is inactive in reduction as well as in isomerization, HP0377CSYS retains reductive activity. Also, replacement of F95 by Q decreases its ability to regenerate scRNase and does not influence the reductive activity of HP0377CSYS towards apocytochrome c. HP0377 is also distinguished from other CcmGs as it forms a 2:1 complex with apocytochrome c. Phylogenetic analyses showed that, although HP0377 is capable of complementing ResA in Bacillus subtilis, its thioredoxin domain has a different origin, presumably common to DsbC."
https://openalex.org/W2799376299,"In my third year of grad school, everything seemed to fall apart. I was dealing with my grandmother's death, and then my girlfriend and I broke up. I spent the following year in a painful feedback loop of depression and despair. Every day, I would trudge into lab and try to get excited about my projects. But when I encountered minor hurdles such as a failed replication or contaminated samples, I would become discouraged and give up. Even when my experiments went smoothly, I felt guilty about the time I had wasted being unproductive. I knew I was struggling, but I didn't ask for help. I thought I could deal with my state of mind just as I had dealt with every other problem in my life: Bottle up my emotions, attack the problem with logic, and iterate until I arrived at a solution.

This time, however, that approach didn't work. I wasn't sleeping well. I couldn't focus enough to read even a brief paper in one sitting. During a lab presentation, I got so dizzy from exhaustion that I had to stop midway through. Balancing work and my mental health had become untenable. I concluded that trying to persist with my lab work was not fair to myself or to my group. When I gathered the courage to discuss time off with my adviser, she encouraged me to take a hiatus.

In the beginning, it felt like a blessing to have time to focus on personal projects and self-care I had neglected, including a healthy dose of binge-watching basketball. But after 3 months, feelings of academic guilt crept back. Despite not feeling fully up to it, I convinced myself that it was time to return.

I tried to mask my depression, but the impact on my work was apparent again. A few months after my return, my adviser called me into her office and initiated a forth-right discussion about why I was not being productive. I wondered whether it was time for me to leave my Ph.D. program. I felt like a failure, and I thought of suicide for the first time. These thoughts finally pushed me to see a therapist.

At first, therapy felt awkward and ineffectual. I was not accustomed to introspection, and I certainly was not accustomed to being probed about my problems. But over time, my counselor and I developed a rapport. She helped me figure out that while my girlfriend and I were together and my workload ramped up, I had socially isolated myself, which meant that I didn't have a support network to draw on when things got tough. She also encouraged me to connect with MindHandHeart (MHH), a coalition of students, faculty, and staff promoting mental health and well-being at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

A year and a half of counseling and MHH gave me the tools I needed to strengthen my relationships and establish a support structure to help cope with any future episodes. I revitalized friendships and opened up about my feelings. My lab work improved, and I am on track to graduate in the next year.

Studies have shown that 40% of Ph.D. students are depressed. But if it weren't for my own experiences, I would not be aware of this—and therein lies the problem. Academics tend to be averse to discussing mental health openly, and higher education's mental health safety net is patchy—a forgotten footnote that all too often fails its students. I am lucky that I have a supportive adviser and health insurance that covers mental health care. And I am lucky that I made it to therapy when I considered suicide. I could easily have waited too long.

Even if you aren't personally burdened by these issues, everyone must take action to support those who are struggling, and to ensure that institutions have support frameworks: advisers trained to deal with mental health issues; student-run support programs; and community events with a focus on diversity and inclusion, because students from underrepresented groups are more likely to experience depression. If your institution doesn't, what can you do to help before someone you care about becomes a different kind of footnote?
