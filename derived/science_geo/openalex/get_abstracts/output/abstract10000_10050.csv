https://openalex.org/W1651420115,"A novel enzyme catalyzing cleavage of the thioether linkage in cysteine conjugates of aromatic compounds, such as 2,4-dinitrobenzene and p-bromobenzene, has been purified about 500-fold from rat liver cytosol. Incubation of S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)cysteine with the enzyme preparation yielded 2,4-dinitrobenzenethiol, pyruvic acid, and NH3 at equimolar ratios, indicating that the thioether cleavage probably proceeds via an alpha,beta elimination reaction. The thiol product was methylated and the methylated derivative 1-methylthio-2,4-dinitrobenzene, was identified by mass spectrometry and proton NMR spectroscopy. The Km value of S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)cysteine was 0.5 mM at pH 7.4 in phosphate buffer. The enzyme activity was inhibited by hydroxylamine. No cofactor requirement was observed. A combination of the partially purified enzyme and hepatic microsomes that contain thiol methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.9) converted cysteine conjugates of 2,4-dinitrobenzene and p-bromobenzene to the corresponding methylthio-containing metabolites; S-adenosylmethionine was required. An important role of this novel beta-lyase enzyme in the formation of methylthio-containing metabolites of various drugs is indicated."

https://openalex.org/W1608797716,"Kinetic studies of both liver and muscle phosphorylase a demonstrate that caffeine and glucose inhibit the binding of glucose 1-phosphate to the enzyme in a synergistic competitive and nonexclusive manner. Inhibition studies for numerous other caffeine analogs show that the muscle enzyme has a relaxed specificity for this negative effector. The liver enzyme is more discriminating by preferential binding of methylated oxypurines. Physiological concentrations of AMP and ATP, which affect the enzymic activity at a separate site, prevent glucose from effectively inhibiting the enzyme. The addition of the second synergistic ligand improves the binding of glucose. These data suggest that glucose homeostasis as regulated by phosphorylase may be dependent on a second ligand and that the role of glucose in this physiological process may have been overestimated. A structural rationalization of this synergistic response is discussed with reference to the crystal structure of the muscle enzyme."

The vitamin K dependence of osteocalcin biosynthesis has been studied both in the developing chicken embryo and in the skeletons of young chicks. Osteocalcin formation, assessed by quantitation of gammaCGlu in whole bone, begins in the 8-day embryonic skeleton and increases dramatically until hatching. Biosynthesis of gammaCGlu is warfarinsensitive; time- and dose-related inhibition of up to 75% is observed. Vitamin K deficiency reduces bone gammaCGlu concentrations by 50% in 3-week-old chicks, and this is totally corrected by including vitamin K1 in the diet. Feeding the vitamin K antagonist dicumarol decreases the bone gammaCGlu level 80% after 6 weeks, but no corresponding alterations are observed in the calcium and phosphorous content of the bone ash. Osteocalcin purified from bones of dicumoral-fed chicks exhibits several electrophoretically variant undercarboxylated protein species containing 2 and 3 gammaCGlu/57 amino acid residues rather than the normal complement of 4 gammaCGlu/57 residues."

https://openalex.org/W192469281,"Abstract : Staphylococcal entertoxin C1 is converted to a doubly cleaved molecule by trypsin digestion with one of the scissions internal to the disulfide loop and one external to it. The larger, disulfide-containing polypeptide (Mr = 22,000) exhibited excellent binding to antiserum to the intact enterotoxin. The residual amino terminal fragment (Mr = 6,500) also bound to this antibody but only weakly. Only the carboxyl terminal carboxamidomethylated moiety of the 22,000 Mr polypeptide (Mr = 19,000) combined with anti-enterotoxin C1. Both the 22,000 Mr and 6,500 Mr polypeptides could partially inhibit the binding of entertoxin C1 to its antibody in a competitive system. It is suggested that enterotoxin C1 possesses three major antigenic determinants, two on Cam 19,000 and one on the 6,500 Mr fragment."

https://openalex.org/W1574456938,"The proteins that bind to rat liver 5.8 S ribosomal ribonucleic acid were identified by affinity chromatography. The nucleic acid was oxidized with periodate and coupled by its 3'-terminus to Sepharose 4B through and adipic acid dihydrazide spacer. The ribosomal proteins that associate with the immobilized 5.8 S rRNA were identified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresiss: they were L19, L8, and L6 from the 60 S subunit; and S13 and S9 from the small subparticle. Small amounts of L14, L17', L18, L27/L27', and L35', and of S11, S15, S23/S24, and S26 also were bound to the affinity column, but whether they associate directly and specifically with 5.8 S rRNA is not known. Escherichia coli ribosomal proteins did not bind to the rat liver 5.8 S rRNA affinity column."

https://openalex.org/W1493436411,"An enzyme that catalyzes a post-transcriptional modification of tRNA, resulting in replacement of a base from tRNA by guanine, has been purified 2600-fold from rabbit erythrocyte cytosol. The purest preparation migrates as a single protein band on polycrylamide gel electrophoresis and the enzymatic activity co-electrophoreses with this protein. The native enzyme has a molecular weight of 104,000 and is dissociated into two subunits of Mr= 60,000 and 43,000. The Km for guanine is 1.5 x 10(-7) M and for a pure guanine-accepting tRNA is 3.3 x 10(-9) M. The amino acid composition of the pure enzyme has been determined. To our knowledge this is the first study in which the molecular characteristics of a pure enzyme capable of modifying an internal position in tRNA has been reported."

https://openalex.org/W1497630985,"Abstract The translation of ovomucoid mRNA in a reticulocyte lysate protein-synthesizing system yields a precursor form which contains an NH2-terminal extension of 23 amino acid residues. Edman degradation of radioactive translation products (pre-ovomucoid) identified the following sequence: formula : (see text), where the initiator methionine (in parentheses) is the only residue cleaved from the NH2 terminus during cell-free synthesis and the vertical line indicates the site at which pre-ovomucoid is cleaved in vivo to yield ovomucoid. The precursor sequence differs from those of two other proteins (pre-lysozyme and pre-conalbumin) secreted by the same cell, but resembles these and other secretory protein signal peptides in both length and hydrophobicity. Pre-ovomucoid does not interact with trypsin in the same manner as mature ovomucoid."

https://openalex.org/W1542540481,"Progesterone treatment of estrogen-primed chicks leads to a shift in the oviduct polysome profile and an increase in the proportion of cytoplasmic RNA which is ovalbumin mRNA. To determine whether the progesterone effect is primarily transcriptional or translational and whether it is separable from estrogen action, rapid estrogen withdrawal by the anti-estrogen tamoxifen was compared in the presence and absence of progesterone. After estrogen stimulation, 24 h of tamoxifen treatment causes ovalbumin synthesis and ovalbumin mRNA levels to fall 10-fold. The proportion of ovalbumin mRNA in the monosome and supernatant fractions of the polysome profile increases; however, these sequences can associate with polysomes if elongation is inhibited by cycloheximide. Progesterone prevents the tamoxifen effects, even if administered 9 h after tamoxifen (at which time ov mRNA has decreased by 30%). The progesterone-induced increase of ovalbumin mRNA (from 0.64% of cytoplasmic RNA to 0.79%) and the increased proportion of ribosomes in polysomes (from 65% to 80%) are thus independent of estrogen action. Twenty-four hours of progesterone plus tamoxifen treatment enhances initiation of translation. However, after prolonged treatments of several days, translation becomes inefficient: ovalbumin synthesis falls by 30% without a coordinate decrease in ovalbumin mRNA, and a significant proportion (15%) of the ovalbumin mRNA becomes localized in monosomes. Thus, optimal maintenance of oviduct mRNA utilization requires the presence of estrogen."

https://openalex.org/W2022090645,"ONE-WAY information transfer from nucleic acids to proteins is generally considered to ensure accurate cell self-duplication, in which errors occur by mutation1. However, it has been argued that self-duplication is a multimolecular process consisting of several potentially error-prone stages2, and that mutation is a complex cellular process3. Moreover, it has been shown that error-prone DNA polymerases cause mutations in bacterio-phage T4 (ref. 4.5). We now report that mutations produced by N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), at two separate loci in Chinese hamster cells, are increased 3–10-fold when the cells are treated in the presence of low concentrations (∼2×10−5M) of thymidine (TdR) and deoxycytidine (GdR). We conclude that imbalanced nucleotide pools facilitate errors of replication of methylated DNA, and suggest that aberrant synthesis of macromolecules, facilitated by imbalances in precursor pools, plays an important part in the expression of genetic damage."

https://openalex.org/W1470951340,"NaF (5 mu) was previously shown to protect calcitonin-responsive adenylate cyclase activity in partially purified membranes from pork renal cortex during solubilization of the enzyme with Lubrol PX (Queener, S. F., Fleming, J. W., and Bell, N. H. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 7586-7592). NaF has now been found to directly influence the activity of the membrane-bound calcitonin-responsive adenylate cyclase. At low concentrations of NaF causing no direct stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity, NaF produced a synergistic increase with calcitonin but not with parathyroid hormone or glucagon. At maximally stimulating concentrations of NaF, calcitonin produced a further increase in enzyme activity. NaF alone increased the maximal velocity (I’,,) and did not affect the apparent K, of the enzyme for ATP, whereas calcitonin alone did not alter the V,, but lowered the K, for ATP. Concentrations of NaF too low to directly alter either K,,, or V,, significantly increased V,, and decreased K,,, when added with calcitonin. De Ha&n plots (De Ha&, C. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 2756-2762) of adenylate cyclase activation by calcitonin with and without NaF indicated that NaF increased the maximal response of the enzyme to calcitonin without affecting the affinity of the enzyme for calcitonin. These effects of NaF could not be attributed to alterations in the activity of phosphodiesterase in these membranes. In addition, NaF had no effect on the slope of the Hill plot for activation by calcitonin and, likewise, calcitonin had no effect on the slope of the Hill plot for activation by NaF. NaF did not alter binding of ‘251-calcitonin to renal cortical membranes or the degradation of calcitonin as determined by chromatoelectrophoresis and radioimmunoassay. NaF was shown to increase the heat lability of the enzyme. It is concluded (a) that NaF at low concentrations acts to enhance responsiveness of renal cortical adenylate cyclase to calcitonin without altering binding or degradation of the hormone and (b) that NaF at high concentrations directly stimulates the catalytic component of the enzyme independent of any action of the hormone. These results suggest that NaF acts at different sites to influence the calcitonin-responsive adenylate cyclase system of pork renal cortex."
