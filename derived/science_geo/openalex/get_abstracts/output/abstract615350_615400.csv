https://openalex.org/W2884342152,"The precision of base editing is enhanced with an engineered version of the APOBEC3A deaminase. Base editor technology, which uses CRISPR–Cas9 to direct cytidine deaminase enzymatic activity to specific genomic loci, enables the highly efficient introduction of precise cytidine-to-thymidine DNA alterations1,2,3,4,5,6. However, existing base editors create unwanted C-to-T alterations when more than one C is present in the enzyme's five-base-pair editing window. Here we describe a strategy for reducing bystander mutations using an engineered human APOBEC3A (eA3A) domain, which preferentially deaminates cytidines in specific motifs according to a TCR>TCY>VCN hierarchy. In direct comparisons with the widely used base editor 3 (BE3) fusion in human cells, our eA3A-BE3 fusion exhibits similar activities on cytidines in TC motifs but greatly reduced editing on cytidines in other sequence contexts. eA3A-BE3 corrects a human β-thalassemia promoter mutation with much higher (>40-fold) precision than BE3. We also demonstrate that eA3A-BE3 shows reduced mutation frequencies on known off-target sites of BE3, even when targeting promiscuous homopolymeric sites."
https://openalex.org/W2883380036,"Large scale neural recordings have established that the transformation of sensory stimuli into motor outputs relies on low-dimensional dynamics at the population level, while individual neurons exhibit complex selectivity. Understanding how low-dimensional computations on mixed, distributed representations emerge from the structure of the recurrent connectivity and inputs to cortical networks is a major challenge. Here, we study a class of recurrent network models in which the connectivity is a sum of a random part and a minimal, low-dimensional structure. We show that, in such networks, the dynamics are low dimensional and can be directly inferred from connectivity using a geometrical approach. We exploit this understanding to determine minimal connectivity required to implement specific computations, and find that the dynamical range and computational capacity quickly increase with the dimensionality of the connectivity structure. This framework produces testable experimental predictions for the relationship between connectivity, low-dimensional dynamics and computational features of recorded neurons."

We find high-affinity, yet non-stimulatory, interactions occur with high frequency in the human T cell repertoire. Here, we studied human TCRs that are refractory to activation by pMHC ligands despite robust binding. Analysis of 3D affinity, 2D dwell time, and crystal structures of stimulatory versus non-stimulatory TCR-pMHC interactions failed to account for their different signaling outcomes. Using yeast pMHC display, we identified peptide agonists of a formerly non-responsive TCR. Single-molecule force measurements demonstrated the emergence of catch bonds in the activating TCR-pMHC interactions, correlating with exclusion of CD45 from the TCR-APC contact site. Molecular dynamics simulations of TCR-pMHC disengagement distinguished agonist from non-agonist ligands based on the acquisition of catch bonds within the TCR-pMHC interface.

Adaptive immune responses are initiated by T cell receptor (TCR) recognition of peptides presented by major histocompatibility molecules (pMHC). TCR engagement with an agonist pMHC leads to phosphorylation of CD3 immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs), initiating a cascade of downstream signaling that results in T cell activation (Chakraborty and Weiss, 2014Chakraborty A.K. Weiss A. Insights into the initiation of TCR signaling.Nat. Immunol. 2014; 15: 798-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Despite the low 3D affinity (KD∼1–100 μM) of the TCR-pMHC interaction, the potency of the T cell response has been shown to generally reflect the strength, or duration, of a particular interaction (Allison et al., 2016Allison K.A.

The existence of binding but non-activating pMHC ligands presents a unique opportunity to probe the underlying molecular mechanism of the TCR triggering process from an alternative vantage point. Here, we study examples of naturally occurring non-agonist TCR-pMHC interactions in order to isolate properties responsible for uncoupling binding from signaling. We found that frequent occurrences of non-agonist TCR-pMHC interactions occur in vivo. Using complementary methodologies, we examined two TCRs specific for HLA-B35-HIV(Pol448–456), one of which exhibited impaired signaling despite exhibiting a robust binding interaction (Ueno et al., 2004Ueno T. Tomiyama H. Fujiwara M. Oka S. Takiguchi M. Functionally impaired HIV-specific CD8 T cells show high affinity TCR-ligand interactions.J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 5451-5457Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Selections on a pMHC yeast display library identified stimulatory peptide ligands for the signaling-refractive TCR that differed by as little as a methylene group. Detailed biophysical characterization of agonist and non-agonist interactions with the same TCR revealed two parameters that correlated with potent signaling: formation of catch bonds and segregation of CD45. We used steered molecular dynamics simulations based on crystal structures of the agonist and non-agonist complexes to develop a molecular model of TCR-pMHC catch bond formation. Catch bonds represent a net gain of molecular interactions under force, revealing an additional level of dynamic diversity built-in as a proofreading mechanism to link TCR recognition and subsequent activation. Collectively, our study revealed a triggering mechanism by which TCR ligation and activation can be coupled or decoupled to regulate TCR ligand discrimination. Several studies have described T cell clones that bind to fluorescently labeled class I and class II pMHC tetramers yet are unresponsive to peptide stimulation (Bentzen et al., 2016Bentzen A.K.

We therefore explored the prevalence of this phenomenon in the natural human T cell repertoire. T cells were stained with fluorescent pMHC tetramers, sorted to single cells, and expanded non-specifically ex vivo. To confirm specificity, these clones were re-stained with the pMHC tetramer and stimulated with the specific peptide to assess responsiveness (Figure 1A). We identified both responsive and non-responsive T cell clones isolated with HLA-DR4-HIV(Gag164–183) fluorescent tetramers. We compared a pMHC-responsive clone, TCR6 (Figures 1B–1E, top), to a non-responsive clone, TCR11 (Figures 1B–1E, bottom). While both clones bound their cognate pMHC-tetramer (Figure 1B), only TCR6 proliferated, secreted cytokines, and downregulated TCR in response to stimulation with DR4-HIV(Gag164–183). TCR11 failed to mount a response (Figures 1C–1E). Both T cell clones downregulated TCR and proliferated in response to non-specific TCR stimulation (Figures 1E and S1). We confirmed that the non-stimulatory response was TCR mediated by transducing TCR6 or 11 into a TCR αβ-deficient cell line. Both T cell lines robustly secreted IL-2 in response to anti-CD3 (OKT3) stimulation; however, there was a substantial difference in IL-2 secretion upon stimulation with DR4-HIV(Gag164–183) (Figure S2).Figure S1High-Affinity Non-agonists Respond to Non-specific Stimuli, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Proliferation of TCR6 (top) and TCR11 (bottom) stimulated with CD3/CD28 beads (red) or non-specific HA peptide (gray).(B) Tetramer staining of HCV-NS3(L5M) responsive clone (top) and non-responsive clone (bottom) with HLA-A2(L5M) (turquoise) and HLA A2-PPI (pre-proinsulin; gray).(C) CD107a immobilization of a responsive clone (top) and unresponsive clone (bottom) when stimulated with L5M (turquoise) or PPI peptide (gray).(D) Tetramer staining (top panels) and CD107a (bottom panels) immobilization of L5N specific clones.

We surveyed T cell clones initially isolated through pMHC tetramer binding and sorting using HLA-A2∗01-restricted hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 variant peptides (KLVALGINAV, L5N, and L5M) as well as the HY self-antigen (FIDSYICQV) (Yu et al., 2015Yu W. Jiang N. Ebert P.J.R. Kidd B.A. Müller S. Lund P.J. Juang J. Adachi K. Tse T. Birnbaum M.E. et al.Clonal Deletion Prunes but Does Not Eliminate Self-Specific αβ CD8(+) T Lymphocytes.Immunity. 2015; 42: 929-941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) (Figures 1F–1I and S1). While most of the clones in the datasets were capable of activation, a fraction (ranging from 15% to 72%) were tetramer positive yet did not produce an antigen-specific response (Figures 1J and S1). Taken together, these data indicated that pMHC binding does not uniformly predict T cell activity. In order to determine the molecular basis of this phenomenon, we focused on a pair of HLA-B35-HIV(Pol448–456)-specific TCRs, one of which (TCR55) appeared to have decoupled TCR-pMHC binding and signaling (Ueno et al., 2004Ueno T. Tomiyama H. Fujiwara M. Oka S. Takiguchi M. Functionally impaired HIV-specific CD8 T cells show high affinity TCR-ligand interactions.J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 5451-5457Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). When we transduced responder (TCR589) or impaired-responder (TCR55) TCRs into a TCR αβ-deficient cell line, both T cell lines were stained by the B35-HIV(Pol448–456) fluorescent tetramers, as previously reported (Figure 1K) (Ueno et al., 2004Ueno T. Tomiyama H. Fujiwara M. Oka S. Takiguchi M. Functionally impaired HIV-specific CD8 T cells show high affinity TCR-ligand interactions.J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 5451-5457Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The TCR589-transduced cell line showed dose-dependent secretion of IL-2 in response to peptide-pulsed APCs, while the TCR55-transduced cell lines failed to secrete detectable IL-2 for all peptide concentrations tested (Figure 1L). When the TCR55 and TCR589 cell lines were stimulated non-specifically with OKT3, both T cell lines responded similarly (Figure S1). TCR55 and TCR589 bound to B35-HIV(Pol448–456) with affinities of 17 μM and 4 μM 3D KD (Figure 2B), respectively, as determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). TCR589 had a slower koff (0.71 s−1) than TCR55, whose koff exceeded the limit of detection (Figures 2B and 2E). Both 3D KD values and kinetic rate constants were within typical range of 3D binding affinities and kinetics measured for agonist peptides (Stone et al., 2009Stone J.D. Chervin A.S. Kranz D.M. T-cell receptor binding affinities and kinetics: impact on T-cell activity and specificity.Immunology. 2009; 126: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). We also measured the 3D affinity of MHC class II DR4-HIV(Gag164–183)-specific TCRs. Surprisingly, the non-stimulatory TCR11 bound with a higher 3D affinity (1 μM KD) than the stimulatory TCR6 (10 μM KD) (Figure S2). We sought to determine whether TCR55 on cells engaged pMHC molecules in the context of lipid bilayers. We imaged the B35-HIV(Pol448–456)-TCR55 and TCR589 interactions in hybrid live-cell-supported lipid bilayer junctions to assess possible differences in the interaction dwell times. The supported membrane was functionalized with fluorescently labeled B35-HIV(Pol448–456) (Figure S3) and ICAM1. Using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, pMHC molecules were unambiguously resolved in complex with cell-surface-expressed TCRs (Figure 2C; Video S1).

Images were acquired every 1 s with an exposure of 500 ms. Scale bars represent 2 μm. Movie is played at 21 fps for 300 frames for top panels, and for 100 frames looped 3 times for bottom panels. To identify potential structural differences in the TCR B35-HIV(Pol448–456) interaction, we determined the crystal structures of TCR589 and TCR55 in complex with B35-HIV(Pol448–456) (Figures 2F–2H; Table S1). The structure of TCR55 complexed with B35-HIV(Pol448–456) was also reported recently (Shi et al., 2017Shi Y. Kawana-tachikawa A. Gao F. Qi J. Liu C. Conserved Vd1 Binding Geometry in a Setting of Locus-Disparate pHLA Recognition by δ/αβ T Cell Receptors (TCRs): Insight into Recognition of HIV Peptides by TCRs.J Virol. 2017; 91 (e00725–17)Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Although TCR55 is translated 8 Å toward the B35α1 helix compared to TCR589, the overall docking geometries of TCR589 and TCR55 are similar and unremarkable (Figures 2G and S3). We see no substantial differences in the conformations of the constant regions that would indicate differential allostery correlating with signaling. TCR55 and TCR589 do not share Vα, Vβ, or CDR3 sequences and exhibited distinct binding chemistries to B35-HIV(Pol448–456) (Figure S3; Figure 2H). TCR589 makes the majority of its contact with the Pol448–456 peptide through its CDR3 loops (Table S2). While TCR55 makes key salt-bridges with Pol448–456, the majority of the binding interface is from CDR1/2α interactions with the B35α1 helix and CDR3β interactions with the B35α2 helix (Figures 2G, 2H, and S3; Table S2). To analyze the functional capacity of these two T cell clones, we traced the activation defect within the signaling cascade. The HIV(Pol448–456) peptide was applied to the B35-expressing cell line KG-1 and SKW3 T cells transduced with TCRs were probed for the surface-expressed activation marker CD69. The TCR589-expressing cell line showed dose-dependent upregulation of CD69; however, the TCR55-expressing cells failed to upregulate CD69, consistent with the IL-2 secretion-defective phenotype previously observed (Figures 1L and 3A ). While both TCRs showed robust ERK1/2 phosphorylation (pERK) in response to OKT3 stimuli, only the TCR589 transduced cell line responded to the HIV(Pol448–456) peptide (Figures 3B, 3C, and S3). We assessed early stages of TCR triggering by examining calcium signaling dynamics. We imaged TCR55- or TCR589-expressing cells labeled with Fluo-4 and activated by coverslips coated with B35-HIV(Pol448–456) monomers, or OKT3. Both T cell clones responded to OKT3 stimulation (Figure S3); however, only 12% ± 3% TCR55-expressing cells fluxed calcium in response to B35-HIV(Pol448–456) stimulation, as compared to 51% ± 4% of TCR589-expressing T cells (Figures 3D and 3E). Furthermore, the TCR589-expressing cells exhibited a substantial and rapid increase in calcium followed by a decay, classified as a type-α calcium response and indicative of successful TCR triggering (Liu et al., 2014Liu B. Chen W. Evavold B.D. Zhu C. Accumulation of dynamic catch bonds between TCR and agonist peptide-MHC triggers T cell signaling.Cell. 2014; 157: 357-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). In contrast, TCR55-expressing cells showed a type-β calcium signal, characterized by intracellular calcium either remaining at baseline or increasing only slightly (Figures 3D, 3E, and S3). These results are consistent with calcium signaling observed for the DR4-HIV(Gag) specific TCRs, in which 70% ± 2% of TCR6-expressing cells were triggered compared to 31% ± 8% of TCR11-expressing cells when stimulated with DR4-HIV(Gag) (Figure S2). Upon TCR triggering, ZAP70 is recruited to phosphorylated ITAMs. We used spinning disc TIRF microscopy to observe ZAP70 recruitment in non-agonist and agonist TCR-pMHC interactions. TCR55- and TCR589-expressing cell lines were lentivirally transduced to express ZAP70-GFP in order to visualize intracellular ZAP70 localization. Cells were examined while in contact with supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) functionalized with B35-HIV(Pol448–456) and ICAM1. TCR589-expressing cells exhibited canonical ZAP70 recruitment: ZAP70 clusters centripetally moved toward the center of the cell (Figure 3F, bottom; Video S2). The TCR55-expressing cells exhibited a uniform distribution of ZAP70 throughout the cytoplasm upon interaction with the SLB (Figure 3F, top; Video S2). The non-agonist signaling defect thus occurred at a membrane-proximal stage. eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI5YmVjNDE0ZmE4OGRjOWFiMmJjNjhlNTE4Zjk5YjE0NiIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZh"

Such nanoscale pre-patterning of actin nucleation may represent a general design principle for directional force generation in membrane remodeling processes such as during cell migration and division. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is critical for many biological processes such as signaling, nutrient uptake, and pathogen entry and involves the internalization of cargo molecules from the cell surface into small membrane vesicles. CME follows a stereotypic order of events: first, a protein coat assembles on the membrane, which then invaginates to form a vesicle with cargo molecules inside. This vesicle is pinched off the plasma membrane and rapidly uncoats allowing fusion with endosomes. CME is performed by a machinery that comprises more than 50 different proteins and is conserved from yeast to humans. Much of our knowledge of the mechanism of CME comes from research in cultured mammalian cells, and yeast (Kaksonen and Roux, 2018Kaksonen M. Roux A. Mechanisms of clathrin-mediated endocytosis.Nat.

In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, genetic and imaging screens have led to a near-complete parts list (Weinberg and Drubin, 2012Weinberg J. Drubin D.G.

In addition, live-cell imaging has revealed the order of assembly of components and categorized them into modules based on their dynamics (Kaksonen et al., 2003Kaksonen M. Sun Y. Drubin D.G.

This modular organization is remarkably conserved in metazoans (Boettner et al., 2011Boettner D.R. Chi R.J. Lemmon S.K. Lessons from yeast for clathrin-mediated endocytosis.Nat.

Clathrin-mediated endocytosis in budding yeast.Trends Cell Biol. 2012; 22: 1-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In yeast, CME can be divided into an early phase, when endocytic proteins are recruited to a flat membrane (Kukulski et al., 2012Kukulski W. Schorb M. Kaksonen M. Briggs J.A.G. Plasma membrane reshaping during endocytosis is revealed by time-resolved electron tomography.Cell. 2012; 150: 508-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), and a late phase during which invagination occurs. The early phase is characterized by the recruitment of various endocytic adaptor and coat proteins, including clathrin, and is long and variable in duration (Kaksonen et al., 2005Kaksonen M. Toret C.P. Drubin D.G. A modular design for the clathrin- and actin-mediated endocytosis machinery.Cell. 2005; 123: 305-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, Stimpson et al., 2009Stimpson H.E.M.

Cell. 2009; 20: 4640-4651Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The following highly regular late phase begins with the arrival of late coat proteins, followed by actin regulatory proteins including WASP and type I myosins (Sun et al., 2006Sun Y. Martin A.C. Drubin D.G. Endocytic internalization in budding yeast requires coordinated actin nucleation and myosin motor activity.Dev. Cell. 2006; 11: 33-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). A burst of actin polymerization starts membrane invagination, and with the arrival of amphiphysin proteins, vesicle scission occurs (Picco et al., 2015Picco A. Mund M. Ries J. Nédélec F. Kaksonen M. Visualizing the functional architecture of the endocytic machinery.eLife. 2015; 4: 1039Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Although the recruitment timing of proteins during endocytosis is well understood, their spatial organization at endocytic sites is largely unknown. This is due to the complexity, dynamics, and small size of the endocytic machinery, which is below the resolution of conventional light microscopy. Live-cell fluorescence microscopy revealed the average positions of endocytic proteins along the membrane invagination (Berro and Pollard, 2014aBerro J. Pollard T.D.

Visualizing the functional architecture of the endocytic machinery.eLife. 2015; 4: 1039Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and the shape of the invagination was determined by correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) (Kukulski et al., 2012Kukulski W. Schorb M. Kaksonen M. Briggs J.A.G. Plasma membrane reshaping during endocytosis is revealed by time-resolved electron tomography.Cell. 2012; 150: 508-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Furthermore, immuno-electron microscopy (EM) reported the approximate location of some endocytic proteins (Idrissi et al., 2008Idrissi F.Z. Grötsch H. Fernández-Golbano I.M. Presciatto-Baschong C. Riezman H. Geli M.I. Distinct acto/myosin-I structures associate with endocytic profiles at the plasma membrane.J.

Ultrastructural dynamics of proteins involved in endocytic budding.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: E2587-E2594Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) in the late stages of endocytosis. However, systematic information about the location of the different endocytic proteins is currently lacking, particularly during the initial phase before membrane bending. Thus, the molecular architecture of this complex supramolecular machine, and how it can drive endocytosis so efficiently to generate precisely shaped and sized membrane vesicles, remains unknown. To address this fundamental gap in our knowledge, we developed a high-throughput superresolution microscopy pipeline to study the nanoscale organization of proteins in the endocytic machinery over the entire endocytic time line. By automating image acquisition and analysis, we could process superresolution images of thousands of cells. We used budding yeast to enable systematic fluorescent tagging of endocytic proteins at their genomic loci to ensure high labeling efficiency, while retaining native expression and biological function. This approach allowed us to analyze the structural organization of 23 different endocytic proteins sampled throughout the endocytic process at, in total, over 100,000 endocytic sites in more than 20,000 fixed yeast cells. We found that assembly of the machinery initiates stochastically from irregular structures. Thereafter, an intricate self-organization emerges where endocytic proteins are radially ordered according to their function. WASP family proteins formed a ring-shaped nanoscale template on the flat membrane to pattern the nucleation of actin filaments. Brownian dynamics simulations of actin polymerization showed that this geometry enables the formation of a scaffold of actin filaments producing sufficient force for membrane invagination, and centering provides a mechanism for the high efficiency and robustness of vesicle budding. Here, we used single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM, also called “(f)PALM” or “STORM”) (Betzig et al., 2006Betzig E. Patterson G.H. Sougrat R. Lindwasser O.W. Olenych S. Bonifacino J.S.

We fixed the cells with formaldehyde, and then placed the focal plane on their underside, where endocytic invaginations are oriented perpendicularly to the focal plane (Figure 1A). Thereby we obtained two-dimensional (2D) projections of endocytic structures, which reveal the lateral distribution of proteins at endocytic sites. In these images, the distribution of endocytic proteins appeared as patches, rings, or irregular shapes (Figures S1, S2, and S3).Figure S1Overview of Imaged Endocytic Proteins (Part 1/3), Related to Figures 1 and 2Show full caption(A and B) Shown are superresolved images of cells where the focal plane was positioned on the midplane (A) and bottom (B) of the cells.(C) Shows example endocytic sites focused as in (B).(D) Shows average radial profiles.

Because endocytosis was arrested by fixation, the individual images provide snapshots of different endocytic time points. To sample the entire endocytic timeline with high statistical power, we automatically acquired and segmented superresolution images of many thousands of endocytic sites (Figures 1B–1D), quantitatively analyzed individual structures (Figures 1E and 1F), spatially aligned them by translation, and averaged them. We thereby generated density profiles of how each protein is on average distributed around the center of the endocytic site (Figure 1G), representing the average structural organization of endocytic proteins over their lifetime. Additionally, we determined how the distribution of four key endocytic proteins evolves during endocytosis. We determined the structural organization of 23 endocytic proteins from all functional modules of the machinery (Figures 2A, S1, S2, and S3, mammalian homologs in parentheses): the early proteins Ede1 (Eps15) and Syp1 (an F-BAR protein, FCHo), which initiate endocytic sites; the seven coat proteins Clc1 and Chc1 (clathrin light and heavy chain), Sla2 (Hip1R), Ent1 (epsin), Sla1, End3, and Pan1 (all intersectin), which interact with membrane, cargo, and actin; six WASP/Myo module proteins including the actin nucleation promoting factor Las17 (WASP), Vrp1 (verprolin), the F-BAR protein Bzz1 (syndapin), the type-I myosins Myo3 and Myo5 (both Myo1-E), and Bbc1 (fungi only); seven components of the endocytic actin network including the Arp2/3 complex subunit Arc18 (ArpC3), capping proteins Cap1 and Cap2 (Capping protein), actin binding protein Abp1 (ABP1), actin crosslinker Sac6 (fimbrin), actin turnover factors Twf1 (twinfilin) and Crn1 (coronin); and, finally, the N-BAR protein Rvs167 (amphiphysin). For each of these proteins, we acquired superresolution images of ∼1,000–10,000 endocytic sites (except Rvs167, where n = 413) (Table S1). These images revealed how proteins are arranged at endocytic sites: Some proteins, including the coat proteins, formed mostly small patches (Figures S1, S2, and S3). Others, like WASP/Myo proteins, formed mostly ring-like structures with empty centers (Figures S1, S2, and S3). For all proteins, except Ede1 and Syp1, these structures were characteristic in size and in shape, indicating an intricate sub-organization of different components within the endocytic machinery. Next, we quantitatively analyzed the individual superresolution images of all structures using a geometric model (Figures 1E and 1F) to extract their shape, size, and position, derived each protein’s average distribution and radial density profile (Figures 2D–2G, S1, S2, and S3), and classified the shape of the average protein distribution as a patch, ring or dome (Table S1). We found the average distribution of a protein (Figure 2A) to be representative of the individual structures (Figures S1, S2, and S3), but note that specific angular distributions or structural asymmetry that are visible in individual images are not represented in the averages. By design, the radial density profiles (Figures 2D–2G) represent the average probability of an endocytic protein to be found at a certain distance from the center of the endocytic site and are intended to quantitatively compare the distribution of different proteins. These data showed that endocytic proteins assemble into nanoscale structures of different sizes and geometries, as evident both in images of individual sites (Figures S1, S2, and S3) and in the averages (Figure 2). Proteins within the same functional endocytic module had similar radial profiles and sizes, indicating that structural organization and function are linked. Coat proteins formed the smallest structures, which were mostly patches with mean outer radii of ∼25–50 nm. Proteins of the WASP/Myo module formed larger, ring-like structures with outer radii of ∼60–100 nm, and actin module proteins formed the largest structures with outer radii of ∼80–100 nm. The amphiphysin Rvs167 of the scission module formed small structures with an outer radius of ∼40 nm. Together, our results reveal that endocytic proteins are functionally organized in distinct radial zones at endocytic sites. As we relied on formaldehyde fixation to ensure high spatial resolution and localization density in the superresolution images, we next characterized how well fixation preserved endocytic structures. For this, we directly compared the distribution of Ede1, Pan1, and Las17, each from a different functional endocytic module, in living and fixed cells. To achieve optimal resolution in living cells, we treated cells with Latrunculin A (LatA), which arrests endocytosis prior to membrane ingression (Kukulski et al., 2012Kukulski W. Schorb M. Kaksonen M. Briggs J.A.G. Plasma membrane reshaping during endocytosis is revealed by time-resolved electron tomography.Cell. 2012; 150: 508-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) and thereby allowed us to image defined, stationary structures. In all cases, the observed structures were very similar between living LatA-treated and fixed LatA-treated cells (Figures 2H and S4). Thus, we concluded that chemical fixation preserved yeast endocytic structures well enough for us to take advantage of the excellent image quality of fixed-cell superresolution imaging. For most endocytic proteins, the individual images resembled their average distribution, hinting toward a fairly constant structural organization during endocytosis. However, the fact that proteins get recruited and disassembled gradually suggests some structural rearrangements over time. Particularly, the early proteins Ede1 and Syp1 that initiate endocytic sites with variable timing on the order of minutes formed highly variable structures, including rings, patches, crescents, lines, and more irregular shapes (Figures S1, S2, and S3), with average outer radii of ∼66 nm (Figures 2C and 2D). To test whether this heterogeneity corresponded to structural changes over time, we combined superresolution imaging of the early protein Ede1 with diffraction-limited imaging of the GFP-tagged coat protein Sla2, whose abundance increases over time until Ede1 is disassembled (Picco et al., 2015Picco A. Mund M. Ries J. Nédélec F. Kaksonen M. Visualizing the functional architecture of the endocytic machinery.eLife. 2015; 4: 1039Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar), thus providing a reference to sort endocytic sites in time (Figure 3A). We found that the distribution of Ede1 continuously grows in size from an average outer radius of 60.8 ± 0.4 nm (mean ± SEM; n = 2,514; SD = 20.9 nm) up to 69.9 ± 0.4 nm (mean ± SEM; n = 2,634; SD = 22.4 nm) (Figures 3B–3D and S5A).Figure S5Average Radial Profiles of Ede1, Pan1, Las17, and Abp1 Staged Using Diffraction-Limited Timing Markers, Related to Figures 3 and 5Show full captionAverage radial profiles of (A) Ede1-mMaple staged by Sla2-GFP, (B) Pan1-mMaple staged by Abp1-GFP, (C) Las17 staged by Abp1-GFP, (D) Abp1 staged by Rvs167-GFP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Average radial profiles of (A) Ede1-mMaple staged by Sla2-GFP, (B) Pan1-mMaple staged by Abp1-GFP, (C) Las17 staged by Abp1-GFP, (D) Abp1 staged by Rvs167-GFP. To further investigate this structural remodeling, we imaged Ede1 and the coat protein Sla2 using dual-color superresolution microscopy. This revealed that Ede1 was arranged either around Sla2 or side by side with it (Figure 3E), but the two proteins rarely overlapped. On average, Ede1 was peripherally organized around Sla2 (Figure 3F). Together, the growing size of Ede1 structures and the arrangement around Sla2 suggest that the endocytic machinery is initiated with variable structures, which are then remodeled during coat recruitment, potentially by a mechanism where coat proteins form a stable patch occupying the center, and thereby force early proteins to arrange more peripherally. Besides Sla2, a variety of other coat proteins are recruited. These include clathrin (Clc1, Chc1), Ent1, Sla1, Sla2, Pan1, and End3, which on average formed patch-like structures with sizes in a range between 25–50 nm (Figures 2C and 2E). Clathrin, which arrives first, formed the smallest structures, followed by End3, Ent1, and Sla2, and then by the late coat proteins Sla1 and Pan1. Although the averages of all coat proteins were patch-like, part of the individual sites showed ring-like distributions (Figure S1, Figure S2, Figure S3), which agrees with our previous findings that Sla1 can form small rings at endocytic sites (Picco et al., 2015Picco A. Mund M. Ries J. Nédélec F. Kaksonen M. Visualizing the functional architecture of the endocytic machinery.eLife. 2015; 4: 1039Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We then analyzed how Pan1, which formed the largest structures of the coat, changed over time by imaging Pan1 alongside Abp1-GFP as marker for the actin network (Figures 3G and 3H). Pan1 structures had an average outer radius of 41.8 ± 0.9 nm (mean ± SEM; n = 494; SD = 19.7 nm) before actin polymerization (Figures 3I and S5), which increased to 50.1 ± 1.6 nm (mean ± SEM; n = 98; SD = 16.2 nm) at endocytic sites where actin polymerization had begun, which corresponds to maximum Pan1 recruitment (Kaksonen et al., 2003Kaksonen M.

Mund M. Ries J. Nédélec F. Kaksonen M. Visualizing the functional architecture of the endocytic machinery.eLife. 2015; 4: 1039Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This indicates that Pan1 structures expand during the continuous recruitment to endocytic sites. Taken together, our data suggest that the progressive assembly of endocytic coat proteins translates into a radially expanding architecture: the early coat proteins clathrin, Sla2 and Ent1, form the core of the coat, whereas the late coat proteins, Sla1 and Pan1, extend to its periphery. As the coat is assembling, members of the WASP/Myo module, which regulate actin nucleation start to arrive at endocytic sites, where they formed rings of different sizes visible in their individual images and averages (Figures 2F, S1, S2, and S3). The group of Las17 (yeast WASP), Bzz1, and Vrp1 on average formed rings with indistinguishable radii of ∼70 nm, in agreement with their reported interactions and functional cooperation to promote actin nucleation (Evangelista et al., 2000Evangelista M. Klebl B.M. Tong A.H. Webb B.A. Leeuw T. Leberer E. Whiteway M. Thomas D.Y. Boone C. A role for myosin-I in actin assembly through interactions with Vrp1p, Bee1p, and the Arp2/3 complex.J.

By contrast, the rings of the type-I myosins Myo3 and Myo5 were significantly larger with radii of ∼90 nm (Figure 2C). This difference was confirmed in dual-color superresolution images of Myo5 and Las17 at individual endocytic sites, where Myo5 was peripherally arranged around a Las17 ring (Figure 4A). The discrepancy of ∼20 nm between Vrp1 and Myo5 radii was surprising, as Vrp1 is required to recruit Myo3/5 to endocytic sites (Grötsch et al., 2010Grötsch H. Giblin J.P. Idrissi F.-Z.

Cell. 2015; 35: 281-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that Myo5 could assume an extended conformation. Indeed, when we endogenously tagged Myo5 with mMaple at its N terminus, we found its N terminus to be on average ∼14 nm further inside than the C terminus (Figure 4B). This indicates a preferential radial orientation of Myo5, where its motor domain points inward toward the center of the endocytic site. Whether this arrangement facilitates an interaction with the more centrally located Vrp1—and what it implies for myosins’ mode of action during endocytosis—should be the subject of future studies. The WASP protein Las17 arrives at endocytic sites together with the most peripheral coat protein Pan1 around 20 s before actin polymerization begins. Las17 is therefore the first protein to form clear ring-like structures. Thus, we asked whether Las17 is pre-patterned as a ring already on the flat plasma membrane or whether its ring-like distribution is caused by the invaginating membrane. When we arrested endocytosis at a flat membrane using LatA (Kukulski et al., 2012Kukulski W. Schorb M. Kaksonen M. Briggs J.A.G. Plasma membrane reshaping during endocytosis is revealed by time-resolved electron tomography.Cell. 2012; 150: 508-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), Las17 still formed rings with a slightly larger outer radius of 74.2 ± 0.7 nm (mean ± SEM; n = 2,179; SD = 31.6 nm) (Figure 2H), demonstrating that ring structures of nucleation promoting factors can form on the flat membrane in the absence of polymerized actin. Next, we analyzed whether Las17 rings changed in size during membrane ingression by imaging Las17 alongside Abp1-GFP as a temporal reference for actin polymerization (Figures 3J and 3K). We found th"

Metazoan evolution required functional monitoring and communication of cellular stress across cells and tissues. The development of the nervous system plays a vital role in organismal homeostasis and coordinates diverse processes ranging from metabolism to circadian control of sleep. However, neurons appear to be one of the cell types most susceptible to the challenges of proteotoxic stress. How and why neurons succumb to the adverse effects of neurodegenerative diseases caused by the imbalance of mal-folded proteins such as Aβ, α-synuclein, and polyglutamine repeats found in the huntingtin protein, while other non-neuronal cell types do not, is unknown. Even less well-understood is the mechanism for the age onset decline in processes responsible for the proper handling of the proteome and the proteostasis network, allowing the imbalance of misfolded and toxic proteins that leads to neurodegeneration (Labbadia and Morimoto, 2015Labbadia J. Morimoto R.I. The biology of proteostasis in aging and disease.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2015; 84: 435-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). However, many age-onset neurodegenerative diseases are accompanied by peripheral maladies that present as metabolic abnormalities and deficiencies in non-neuronal tissues (Cai et al., 2012Cai H.

Metabolic disturbances in diseases with neurological involvement.Aging Dis. 2013; 5: 238-255PubMed Google Scholar). Studies in C. elegans have established that expression of the Huntington’s disease-causing polyglutamine expansion protein (Q40) in neurons results not only in neuronal detriment for the animal, but also peripheral decline in metabolic homeostasis, muscle function, and lifespan (Berendzen et al., 2016Berendzen K.M. Durieux J. Shao L.W. Tian Y. Kim H.E. Wolff S. Liu Y. Dillin A.

Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 10417-10422Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, it is also associated with the induction of a protective stress response, the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt), which causes global alteration of transcription networks to maintain a functional mitochondrial proteome during challenges (Berendzen et al., 2016Berendzen K.M. Durieux J. Shao L.W. Tian Y. Kim H.E. Wolff S. Liu Y. Dillin A. Neuroendocrine coordination of mitochondrial stress signaling and proteostasis.Cell. 2016; 166: 1553-1563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Neuronal expressed Q40 associates with mitochondria, causing a local activation of the UPRmt that is further communicated extracellularly across the animal to promote UPRmt activation in non-neuronal, non-innervated cells and tissues. This process requires intact UPRmt machinery, the active participation of serotonin, and the release of dense core vesicles (Berendzen et al., 2016Berendzen K.M. Durieux J. Shao L.W. Tian Y. Kim H.E. Wolff S. Liu Y. Dillin A. Neuroendocrine coordination of mitochondrial stress signaling and proteostasis.Cell. 2016; 166: 1553-1563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). While serotonin is necessary for the cell-non-autonomous communication of UPRmt stress response, it is not sufficient, suggesting other secreted factors might also be responsible for this signaling event. Within C. elegans, the UPRmt is activated when the transcription factor ATFS-1 translocates from mitochondria to the nucleus in response to mitochondrial perturbations (Nargund et al., 2012Nargund A.M. Pellegrino M.W. Fiorese C.J. Baker B.M. Haynes C.M. Mitochondrial import efficiency of ATFS-1 regulates mitochondrial UPR activation.Science. 2012; 337: 587-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). A number of other proteins work together with ATFS-1 during UPRmt activation, including the mitochondrial matrix protease ClpP, ubiquitin-like protein UBL-5, and the transcription factor DVE-1 (Benedetti et al., 2006Benedetti C. Haynes C.M. Yang Y. Harding H.P. Ron D.

Cell. 2007; 13: 467-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). ATFS-1 and DVE-1/UBL-5 induce the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial quality control and cellular metabolism to restore proteostasis within mitochondria (Nargund et al., 2015Nargund A.M. Fiorese C.J. Pellegrino M.W. Deng P. Haynes C.M. Mitochondrial and nuclear accumulation of the transcription factor ATFS-1 promotes OXPHOS recovery during the UPR(mt).Mol. Cell. 2015; 58: 123-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). More recent studies have demonstrated the role of epigenetic regulation in UPRmt induction. Two histone lysine demethylases (JMJD-1.2 and JMJD-3.1) that modify H3K27me2/me3 sites are necessary and sufficient for UPRmt induction (Merkwirth et al., 2016Merkwirth C. Jovaisaite V. Durieux J. Matilainen O. Jordan S.D. Quiros P.M. Steffen K.K. Williams E.G. Mouchiroud L. Tronnes S.U. et al.Two conserved histone demethylases regulate mitochondrial stress-induced longevity.Cell. 2016; 165: 1209-1223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Chromatin remodeling is mediated by the MET-2/LIN-65 histone methyltransferases, which regulate UPRmt-associated transcriptional networks (Tian et al., 2016Tian Y. Garcia G. Bian Q. Steffen K.K. Joe L. Wolff S. Meyer B.J. Dillin A. Mitochondrial stress induces chromatin reorganization to promote longevity and UPR(mt).Cell. 2016; 165: 1197-1208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Within metazoan, the induction of the UPRmt can be coordinated across multiple tissues, preparing the entire organism to better cope with a locally sensed stress (Higuchi-Sanabria et al., 2018Higuchi-Sanabria R. Frankino P.A. Paul 3rd, J.W. Tronnes S.U. Dillin A. A futile battle? Protein quality control and the stress of aging.Dev. Cell. 2018; 44: 139-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For example, UPRmt induction resulting from the knockdown of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) subunit cco-1 (cytochrome c oxidase-1) in neurons is sensed and then reacted to by mitochondria located in the intestine, a physically distinct, non-innervated tissue, resulting in beneficial effects for the whole organism, including increased lifespan (Durieux et al., 2011Durieux J. Wolff S. Dillin A. The cell-non-autonomous nature of electron transport chain-mediated longevity.Cell. 2011; 144: 79-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). Further, the neuron-specific expression of the Q40 protein in C. elegans causes cell-non-autonomous induction of UPRmt in the intestine (Berendzen et al., 2016Berendzen K.M. Durieux J. Shao L.W. Tian Y. Kim H.E. Wolff S. Liu Y. Dillin A. Neuroendocrine coordination of mitochondrial stress signaling and proteostasis.Cell. 2016; 166: 1553-1563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Collectively, these findings have led to the mechanistic hypothesis that a factor, termed a mitokine, is generated in neurons experiencing mitochondrial stress, and is secreted, propagated, and subsequently perceived by cells of peripheral tissues to regulate organismal mitochondrial homeostasis. Humans with mitochondrial diseases, such as IOSCA (infantile onset spinocerebellar ataxia), suffer from muscle debilitation and produce excess levels of FGF21, a cytokine that enters and circulates in the blood (Suomalainen et al., 2011Suomalainen A. Elo J.M. Pietiläinen K.H. Hakonen A.H. Sevastianova K. Korpela M. Isohanni P. Marjavaara S.K. Tyni T. Kiuru-Enari S. et al.FGF-21 as a biomarker for muscle-manifesting mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiencies: a diagnostic study.Lancet Neurol. 2011; 10: 806-818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Flies with disrupted muscle mitochondrial function have elevated levels of ImpL2 (an ortholog to human insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7), which systemically antagonizes insulin signaling, and prolongs lifespan (Owusu-Ansah et al., 2013Owusu-Ansah E. Song W. Perrimon N. Muscle mitohormesis promotes longevity via systemic repression of insulin signaling.Cell. 2013; 155: 699-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). However, the molecular nature of a mitokine first perceived in the nervous system and sufficient to induce the mitochondrial stress response in distal cells has remained unknown. Here, to identify a putative mitokine, we characterized C. elegans EMS mutants that are defective in cell-non-autonomous UPRmt signaling but retain the ability for cell-autonomous UPRmt induction. Intriguingly, within the 16 mutants identified, we found VPS-35, a retromer component, is required for the cell-non-autonomous UPRmt induction through retrieval of the Wnt secretion factor, MIG-14. We further identified that the Wnt ligand, EGL-20, is not only essential, but also sufficient for cell-non-autonomous UPRmt induction. Collectively, EGL-20 presents itself as a strong candidate to be a mitokine. Neuronal expression of a polyglutamine repeat protein of 40 repeats (Q40) is sufficient to induce cell-non-autonomous UPRmt signaling in peripheral, non-neuronal cells of C. elegans (Berendzen et al., 2016Berendzen K.M. Durieux J. Shao L.W. Tian Y. Kim H.E. Wolff S. Liu Y. Dillin A. Neuroendocrine coordination of mitochondrial stress signaling and proteostasis.Cell. 2016; 166: 1553-1563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). UPRmt activation can be monitored by measuring the expression of the transcriptional UPRmt reporter hsp-6p::gfp (Brignull et al., 2006Brignull H.R. Moore F.E. Tang S.J. Morimoto R.I. Polyglutamine proteins at the pathogenic threshold display neuron-specific aggregation in a pan-neuronal Caenorhabditis elegans model.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 7597-7606Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We performed an EMS mutagenesis screen using the hsp-6p::gfp reporter to identify mutants that suppress UPRmt in peripheral cells of animals expressing neuronal Q40. Subsequently, we evaluated whether the mutants identified in this screen retained their ability to induce UPRmt in response to cell-autonomous mitochondrial stress, such as cco-1 RNAi delivered by bacterial feeding (Durieux et al., 2011Durieux J. Wolff S. Dillin A. The cell-non-autonomous nature of electron transport chain-mediated longevity.Cell. 2011; 144: 79-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, Houtkooper et al., 2013Houtkooper R.H.

Mitonuclear protein imbalance as a conserved longevity mechanism.Nature. 2013; 497: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Screening of 2,400 mutagenized genomes with these criteria yielded 16 mutant strains and uth13, the strain with the strongest suppression phenotype, was further characterized (Figure S1A). Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mapping and whole genome deep sequencing indicated that the uth13 carries a mutation in the vps-35 gene at the codon for amino acid 523 (CAA-TAA [Gln-Stop]) (Figure S1C). Using the deletion allele vps-35(ok1880), we confirmed that vps-35 was required for the induction of the hsp-6p::gfp reporter in the peripheral cells of animals expressing Q40 in neurons (Figures 1A and 1B ). Western blot analysis confirmed that both vps-35(uth13) and vps-35(ok1880) mutant animals lost hsp-6p::gfp expression without any alteration of neuronal Q40 expression levels (Figures 1C and S1B). Furthermore, the induction of cell-autonomous UPRmt in vps-35 mutant animals was not affected when animals were treated with the cell autonomous stressor cco-1 RNAi via bacterial feeding (Figures 1D and 1E). While multiple challenges to mitochondrial proteostasis in neurons can activate cell-non-autonomous UPRmt, knockdown of the mitochondrial ETC subunit cco-1 in neurons also activates UPRmt in the peripheral tissue (Durieux et al., 2011Durieux J. Wolff S. Dillin A. The cell-non-autonomous nature of electron transport chain-mediated longevity.Cell. 2011; 144: 79-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, we found that the vps-35 mutation also suppressed the induction of hsp-6p::gfp expression in animals with neuronal cco-1 knockdown (Figures 1F and 1G). The non-autonomous nature of the unfolded protein response is not confined to the UPRmt; the UPRER and UPRCyt also function in a cell-non-autonomous manner to coordinate stress responses across different tissues. For example, ectopic activation of the UPRER in neurons, by overexpression of XBP-1 s, activates the expression of hsp-4p::gfp reporter, a marker of UPRER expression, in the intestine of C. elegans (Ron and Walter, 2007Ron D.

XBP-1 is a cell-nonautonomous regulator of stress resistance and longevity.Cell. 2013; 153: 1435-1447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Similarly, overexpression of the heat shock transcription factor, HSF-1, in the nervous system induces the expression of the sod-3p::gfp reporter, a target gene of DAF-16, in the intestine (Douglas et al., 2015Douglas P.M. Baird N.A. Simic M.S. Uhlein S. McCormick M.A. Wolff S.C. Kennedy B.K. Dillin A.

Direct observation of stress response in Caenorhabditis elegans using a reporter transgene.Cell Stress Chaperones. 1999; 4: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, neither neuronal induction of the UPRER or UPRCyt activates the UPRmt. We found that vps-35 was not involved in either the cell-autonomous or the cell-non-autonomous induction of the UPRER or UPRCyt (Figures S1D–S1G). Therefore, vps-35 plays an essential and specific role in cell-non-autonomous UPRmt communication. vps-35 encodes an essential subunit of the retromer complex, a highly conserved multi-subunit complex that mediates the retrograde transport of cargo between endosomes and the trans-Golgi network (Bonifacino and Rojas, 2006Bonifacino J.S. Rojas R. Retrograde transport from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 568-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). We additionally found that animals carrying mutations in two additional core retromer components (vps-26 and vps-29) (Hierro et al., 2007Hierro A. Rojas A.L. Rojas R. Murthy N. Effantin G. Kajava A.V. Steven A.C. Bonifacino J.S. Hurley J.H. Functional architecture of the retromer cargo-recognition complex.Nature. 2007; 449: 1063-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) exhibited suppression phenotypes in animals expressing neuronal Q40 similar to those of the vps-35 mutants (Figures 1H–1J). Thus, the retromer complex, and not solely vps-35, functions in the regulation of cell-non-autonomous UPRmt signaling from the nervous system to the periphery. The retromer complex mediates at least two essential aspects of cellular biology: the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics and the retrieval of various cargo proteins from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (e.g., glutamate, transforming growth factor β [TGF-β], Wnt, and phagocytic secretion factors) (Belenkaya et al., 2008Belenkaya T.Y.

RAB-6.2 and the retromer regulate glutamate receptor recycling through a retrograde pathway.J. Cell Biol. 2012; 196: 85-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We first tested the role of the retromer complex in mitochondrial dynamics. Here, VPS35 facilitates the degradation of the dynamin-like protein, DLP1, via the mitochondrial-derived vesicle pathway (Wang et al., 2016Wang W. Wang X. Fujioka H. Hoppel C. Whone A.L. Caldwell M.A. Cullen P.J. Liu J. Zhu X. Parkinson’s disease-associated mutant VPS35 causes mitochondrial dysfunction by recycling DLP1 complexes.Nat. Med. 2016; 22: 54-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). We examined the effects of a loss-of-function mutation and of overexpression of drp-1, the C. elegans DLP1 homolog (Labrousse et al., 1999Labrousse A.M. Zappaterra M.D. Rube D.A. van der Bliek A.M. C. elegans dynamin-related protein DRP-1 controls severing of the mitochondrial outer membrane.Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 815-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). The drp-1(tm1108) mutant and the drp-1 overexpression strain both induced the expression of hsp-6p::gfp reporter and did not suppress the induction of cell-non-autonomous UPRmt signaling in Q40 animals (Figures S2A and S2C). Likewise, the removal of mitochondrial fusion proteins eat-3 and fzo-1 also induced UPRmt and did not suppress the induction of cell-non-autonomous UPRmt of neuronal expressed Q40 animals (Figure S2B). Therefore, the role of the retromer complex in mitokine signaling does not appear to be linked to mitochondrial dynamics. We next tested the retrieval function of the retromer complex, which is critical for efficient recycling of signaling receptors to allow proper transcellular signal transduction. We hypothesized that the observed loss of cell-non-autonomous UPRmt signaling in the vps-35 mutant was due to a defect in the retromer-mediated recycling of receptors that function in the cell-non-autonomous mitochondrial stress signaling pathway. We initially characterized receptors known to be retrieved by the retromer complex and found that the Wnt secretion factor, MIG-14, was required for induction of the hsp-6p::gfp reporter in animals expressing Q40 in neurons (Figures 2A and 2B ). In contrast, the glutamate receptor GLR-1, the phagocytic receptor CED-1, and the TGF-β receptor SMA-6, which are also retrieved by the retromer complex, are not involved in cell-non-autonomous UPRmt signaling (Figure S2C). Studies across multiple organisms have demonstrated that Wnt ligands are post-translationally modified with lipids (Clevers and Nusse, 2012Clevers H. Nusse R. Wnt/β-catenin signaling and disease.Cell. 2012; 149: 1192-1205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4021) Google Scholar). Lipidation of Wnt ligands occurs in the ER and is catalyzed by the enzyme porcupine (mom-1 in C. elegans) (Rocheleau et al., 1997Rocheleau C.E. Downs W.D. Lin R. Wittmann C. Bei Y. Cha Y.-H. Ali M. Priess J.R. Mello C.C. Wnt signaling and an APC-related gene specify endoderm in early C. elegans embryos.Cell. 1997; 90: 707-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The Wnt secretion factor, MIG-14, can then bind these modified Wnt ligands and transport them from the Golgi to the cell surface (Bänziger et al., 2006Bänziger C. Soldini D. Schütt C. Zipperlen P. Hausmann G. Basler K. Wntless, a conserved membrane protein dedicated to the secretion of Wnt proteins from signaling cells.Cell. 2006; 125: 509-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). After Wnt ligands have been released to the extracellular space, MIG-14 becomes internalized via the clathrin adaptor DPY-23/AP2-mediated endocytosis pathway (Pan et al., 2008Pan C.L. Baum P.D. Gu M. Jorgensen E.M. Clark S.G. Garriga G. C. elegans AP-2 and retromer control Wnt signaling by regulating mig-14/Wntless.Dev. Cell. 2008; 14: 132-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the retromer-dependent retrieval pathway delivers MIG-14 back to the Golgi, where it becomes available for further Wnt secretion (Yang et al., 2008Yang P.T. Lorenowicz M.J. Silhankova M. Coudreuse D.Y.M. Betist M.C. Korswagen H.C. Wnt signaling requires retromer-dependent recycling of MIG-14/Wntless in Wnt-producing cells.Dev. Cell. 2008; 14: 140-147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). We found that loss of the DPY-23/AP2 adaptor in dpy-23 mutants resulted in suppression of the mitokine signaling that phenocopied the mig-14 mutant animals (Figures 2A and 2B). We also found that lipid modification of Wnt is essential for the mitokine signaling induction: mom-1 RNAi strongly suppressed induction of the hsp-6p::gfp reporter in neurons of Q40 animals (Figures 2A and 2B). Western blot analysis verified that hsp-6p::GFP levels were dramatically reduced in mig-14, dpy-23, and mom-1 mutants as compared to wild-type (WT) animals expressing neuronal Q40 (Figure 2C). Moreover, we observed no differences in the induction of cell-autonomous UPRmt when we fed cco-1 RNAi bacteria to mig-14, dpy-23, and mom-1 mutants compared to control animals (Figure S2D). Furthermore, we overexpressed mig-14 in vps-35 mutant animals expressing neuronal Q40 and found that mig-14 overexpression partially rescued the hsp-6p::gfp suppression phenotypes in vps-35 mutants. Our observation that excess MIG-14 ameliorated vps-35 suppression on UPRmt induction is consistent with the prediction that retromer-dependent MIG-14 recycling is essential for mitokine signaling (Figure S2E). We performed a candidate screen against all known Wnt ligands in C. elegans (egl-20, lin-44, cwn-1, cwn-2, and mom-2) (Shackleford et al., 1993Shackleford G.M. Shivakumar S. Shiue L. Mason J.

The other Wnt ligand mutants did not affect either the cell autonomous or cell-non-autonomous UPRmt induction (Figures S3A–S3C). Western blot analysis verified that hsp-6p::GFP levels were dramatically reduced in egl-20 mutants compared to the control animals expressing neuronal Q40 (Figure 3C). Furthermore, we measured the endogenous hsp-6 mRNA levels and found that it was also dramatically reduced by the loss of egl-20 in the neuronal expressed Q40 animals (Figure S3D).Figure S3Other Wnt Ligands Are Not Required for the Induction of Cell-Non-autonomous UPRmt in Animals Expressing Q40 in Neurons, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Representative photomicrographs of animals expressing neuronal Q40::YFP; hsp-6p::gfp in WT, lin-44(n1792), cwn-1(ok546), cwn-2(ok895), or mom-2 RNAi background.(B) Quantification of hsp-6p::gfp expression in neuronal Q40::YFP animals in the WT, lin-44(n1792), cwn-1(ok546), or cwn-2(ok895) background as shown in (A).

Nevertheless, due to challenges associated with detecting protein interactions on the cell surface, the host receptors of many human pathogens remain unknown. Here, we build a library consisting of most single transmembrane human receptors and implement a workflow for unbiased and high-sensitivity detection of receptor-ligand interactions. We apply this technology to elucidate the long-sought receptor of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), the leading viral cause of congenital birth defects. We identify neuropilin-2 (Nrp2) as the receptor for HCMV-pentamer infection in epithelial/endothelial cells and uncover additional HCMV interactors. Using a combination of biochemistry, cell-based assays, and electron microscopy, we characterize the pentamer-Nrp2 interaction and determine the architecture of the pentamer-Nrp2 complex. This work represents an important approach to the study of host-pathogen interactions and provides a framework for understanding HCMV infection, neutralization, and the development of novel anti-HCMV therapies."

https://openalex.org/W2883902554,"Overnutrition disrupts circadian metabolic rhythms by mechanisms that are not well understood. Here, we show that diet-induced obesity (DIO) causes massive remodeling of circadian enhancer activity in mouse liver, triggering synchronous high-amplitude circadian rhythms of both fatty acid (FA) synthesis and oxidation. SREBP expression was rhythmically induced by DIO, leading to circadian FA synthesis and, surprisingly, FA oxidation (FAO). DIO similarly caused a high-amplitude circadian rhythm of PPARα, which was also required for FAO. Provision of a pharmacological activator of PPARα abrogated the requirement of SREBP for FAO (but not FA synthesis), suggesting that SREBP indirectly controls FAO via production of endogenous PPARα ligands. The high-amplitude rhythm of PPARα imparted time-of-day-dependent responsiveness to lipid-lowering drugs. Thus, acquisition of rhythmicity for non-core clock components PPARα and SREBP1 remodels metabolic gene transcription in response to overnutrition and enables a chronopharmacological approach to metabolic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2884450623,"During corticogenesis, ventricular zone progenitors sequentially generate distinct subtypes of neurons, accounting for the diversity of neocortical cells and the circuits they form. While activity-dependent processes are critical for the differentiation and circuit assembly of postmitotic neurons, how bioelectrical processes affect nonexcitable cells, such as progenitors, remains largely unknown. Here, we reveal that, in the developing mouse neocortex, ventricular zone progenitors become more hyperpolarized as they generate successive subtypes of neurons. Experimental in vivo hyperpolarization shifted the transcriptional programs and division modes of these progenitors to a later developmental status, with precocious generation of intermediate progenitors and a forward shift in the laminar, molecular, morphological, and circuit features of their neuronal progeny. These effects occurred through inhibition of the Wnt-beta-catenin signaling pathway by hyperpolarization. Thus, during corticogenesis, bioelectric membrane properties are permissive for specific molecular pathways to coordinate the temporal progression of progenitor developmental programs and thus neocortical neuron diversity."

The discovery of reversible N6-methyladenosine (m6A) mRNA methylation (m6A tagging) has revealed an important layer of post-transcriptional gene regulation (Meyer and Jaffrey, 2014Meyer K.D.

Recent studies have shown that constitutive knockout of Mettl14, a key element of the m6A methyltransferase complex (Liu et al., 2014Liu J. Yue Y. Han D. Wang X. Fu Y. Zhang L. Jia G. Yu M. Lu Z.

Indeed, studies examining the consequences of Fto manipulation, an m6A demethylase (Jia et al., 2011Jia G. Fu Y. Zhao X. Dai Q. Zheng G. Yang Y. Yi C. Lindahl T. Pan T. Yang Y.G. He C.

Using cell-type-specific genetic deletion or brain-region-specific adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated deletion of Mettl14, here we study the necessity of m6A tagging in neurons by examining the functional consequences of m6A loss in the adult mammalian brain. To bypass the detrimental effects of Mettl14 deletion in early embryonic development (Yoon et al., 2017Yoon K.J. Ringeling F.R. Vissers C. Jacob F. Pokrass M. Jimenez-Cyrus D. Su Y. Kim N.S. Zhu Y.

Neurosci. 2018; 21: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), we crossed mice carrying a conditionally removable allele of Mettl14 (M14f/f) with mice expressing Cre recombinase under control of either the dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) promoter (D1R-fM14exp) or ADORA2A promoter (D2R-fM14exp) to delete Mettl14 in dopamine D1R-expressing striatonigral neurons or dopamine D2 receptor (D2R)-expressing striatopallidal neurons, respectively. These cells represent the two prominent striatal projection neuron types with roughly even distribution throughout the striatum. Both D1R- and D2R-fM14exp mice were viable. Adult mutant mice (2–6 months old) were not obviously distinguishable from littermate controls (referred herein as D1R-fM14ctrl and D2R-fM14ctrl), although motor impairments became more obvious in older mice. Deletion of either striatonigral or striatopallidal Mettl14 significantly decreased striatal cells double-labeled for both NeuN and METTL14 (D1R, t = 7.608, p = 0.0032; D2R, t = 3.2092, p = 0.0326), without affecting overall levels of NeuN in either manipulation (Figures S1A and S1B; D1R, t = −0.1079, p = 0.9197; D2R, t = 0.3825, p = 0.7216). We also found intact striatonigral projections to the substantia nigra pars reticulata in D1R-fM14exp mice (Figure S1C) and intact striatopallidal projections to the globus pallidus in D2R-fM14exp mice (Figure S1C). m6A mRNA immunoprecipitation followed by RNA sequencing (m6A-seq) revealed more than 33,500 putative m6A sites enriched in more than 11,000 mRNA species in control striatum, with a transcriptome-wide distribution and preferred consensus motif similar to previous reports (Meyer et al., 2012Meyer K.D. Saletore Y. Zumbo P. Elemento O. Mason C.E. Jaffrey S.R.

Biol. 2014; 10: 93-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (1675) Google Scholar; Figures 1A and 1B ). Mettl14 deletion in either cross significantly reduced overall m6A levels determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (Figure 1C; D1R, t = 18.34, p < 0.0001; D2R, t = 4.402, p = 0.0033). Loss of striatonigral Mettl14 resulted in the downregulation of 740 m6A-containing mRNAs (Figures 1D and 1F) and upregulation of 498 m6A-containing mRNAs (Figures 1D and 1H). The magnitude of change in both downregulated (Figure 1F; t = 3.6157, p = 0.0003) and upregulated (Figure 1H; t = 2.288, p = 0.0225) mRNAs positively correlated with magnitude of decrease in m6A peak enrichment in D1R-fM14exp mice (Table S1), meaning that transcripts with the largest decrease in m6A mRNA enrichment score in experimental mice relative to control mice also showed the greatest degree of change in mRNAs (either up or down). In D2R-fM14exp mice, we similarly found a greater number of downregulated m6A-containing mRNAs (Figures 1E and 1F; n = 433) than upregulated m6A mRNA species (Figures 1E and 1H; n = 180). Similar to D1R-fM14exp mice, the degree of downregulation of mRNA species correlated with loss of m6A enrichment (Figure 1F; t = 2.1575, p = 0.03151). However, we found no significant correlation between upregulation of mRNA species and m6A enrichment (Figure 1H; t = 1.2007, p = 0.2314; Table S1). Gene ontology (GO) analyses revealed that genes associated with downregulated mRNAs containing m6A sites were enriched in neuron-specific compartments including the synapse, postsynaptic membrane, axon, and dendrites in both D1R- and D2R-fM14exp mice (Figure 1G). Moreover, we found downregulation of striatal mRNAs containing m6A sites in numerous genes important for synaptic plasticity, including Homer1 and Cdk5r1, in both D1R- and D2R-fM14exp mice. Despite these shared changes in mRNAs encoding neuronal and synaptic proteins, only D1R-fM14exp mice showed significantly reduced expression of striatonigral identity genes encoding the precursors of substance-P (Tac1, t = 3.806, p = 0.0190) and dynorphin (Pdyn, t = 5.288, p = 0.0061). Likewise, only D2R-fM14exp mice showed decreased mRNA expression of the striatopallidal identity genes for the enkephalin precursor (Penk, t = 7.162, p = 0.0029) and D2R (Drd2, t = 3.389, p = 0.02805). All of these identity genes contain m6A consensus sequences. In contrast, GO analyses of genes containing m6A sites that resulted in upregulation of striatal mRNA expression in D1R-fM14exp mice revealed enrichment primarily in metabolism, ribosomal machinery, and translation (Figure 1I). In D2R-fM14exp mice, we found almost no significant enrichment terms when upregulated mRNA species were subjected to GO analysis (Figure 1I). Subsequent analysis revealed a subset of 86 genes (Figure 1J) downregulated in both D1R- and D2R-fM14exp mice with GO enrichment in membrane, axon, and phosphoproteins (Figure 1K), while 47 genes were upregulated in both D1R- and D2R-fM14exp mice. Importantly, only three genes with significant changes in mRNA expression in both D1R- and D2R-fM14exp mice showed altered expression in opposite directions (e.g., upregulated in D1R-fM14exp, but downregulated in D2R-fM14exp mice), suggesting lack of Mettl14 alters mRNA expression in these two neural populations similarly. To examine the behavioral consequences of Mettl14 deletion, we focused on well-established striatum-dependent behaviors, which require intact cortico-striato-thalamic circuitry. We used the accelerating rotarod to assess sensorimotor learning and the water cross maze to assess response-reversal learning. Impairments were observed in sensorimotor learning (D1R, Figure 2A; genotype main effect, F(1,52) = 10.22, p = 0.0070; D2R, Figure 2B; genotype main effect, F(1,120) = 4.615, p = 0.0227) and reversal learning (Figure 2C, right; D1R, log-rank Mantel-Cox, chi-square = 9.356, p = 0.0022; D2R, log-rank Mantel-Cox, chi-square = 3.704, p = 0.0543) in both D1R- and D2R-fM14exp mice, while initial acquisition of response learning was normal (Figure 2C, left; D1R, log-rank Mantel-Cox, chi-square = 0.004413, p = 0.8336; D2R, log-rank Mantel-Cox, chi-square = 0.8056, p = 0.3694). Gross motor performance was then assessed using a visible platform task. We found significantly increased latency to reach the platform in mice with striatonigral (Figure 2D, left; t = −6.421, p = 0.0016), but not striatopallidal (Figure 2D, right; t = −0.8932, p = 0.3901), Mettl14 deletion. We next administered pathway-specific drugs to evaluate locomotor responsivity. Baseline locomotor activity did not differ in either D1R-fM14exp (Figure 2E; genotype, F(1.767) = 0.0725, p = 0.7920; genotype × time interaction, F(59,767) = 0.9441, p = 0.5963) or D2R-fM14exp mice (Figure 2F; genotype, F(1.1711) = 2.970, p = 0.955; genotype × time interaction, F(59,1711) = 0.1.326, p = 0.0512), though there was a trend toward hyperactivity in D2R-fM14exp mice. D1R-fM14exp mice showed significantly increased sensitivity to the selective D1R agonist SKF-81297 (Figure 2E; genotype × drug, F(1,13) = 7.029, p = 0.0200). In contrast, D2R-fM14exp mice showed almost normal sensitivity to the selective D2R antagonist eticlopride (Figure 2F; genotype × drug, F(1,28) = 0.0400, p = 0.8430). We chose to treat D2R-fM14exp mice with an antagonist rather than an agonist due to a potential confound arising from D2R agonist activation of D2 autoreceptors, which dramatically reduce dopamine release. The epitranscriptomic and behavioral analyses suggest that Mettl14 deletion from specific neuronal populations alters neuronal function. To study how neuron-specific Mettl14 deletion may alter neuronal structure and function, we first examined basic morphological properties in the striatonigral pathway of D1R-fM14exp mice. We focused on the striatonigral-specific deletion as we observed a more severe phenotype in these mice. To visualize dendritic spine morphology in D1R neurons (Figure 3), we injected an AAV encoding Cre-dependent mCherry into the dorsal striatum of adult D1R-fM14exp and M14f/−;D1Rcre+ control (D1R-fM14ctrl) mice. Immunohistochemistry revealed a lack of METTL14 in mCherry-positive striatal cells in D1R-fM14exp mice (Figure 3A). We found no difference in dendritic branching (Figure 3B); dendritic diameter (Figures 3C and 3D); total spine number (Figures 3C and 3E); or number or volume of stubby, mushroom, and thin dendritic spines (Figures 3F and 3G; see Table S2 for statistics). To determine if Mettl14 deletion alters intrinsic physiological properties of striatonigral neurons, we performed whole-cell recordings in mCherry-labeled D1 neurons. Recorded cells were filled with biocytin to confirm lack of METTL14 (Figure 3H). We found no difference in passive membrane properties (Figures 3I–3K; Table S2), including resting membrane potential, input resistance, and capacitance. However, a leftward shift in the current-voltage relationship, while not significant, was observed in D1R-fM14exp mice (Figure 3N). Striatonigral Mettl14 deletion also significantly lowered the current threshold to generate both a single action potential (rheobase; Figure 3L) and a train of action potentials (Figure 3O, inset), suggesting Mettl14 deletion increases neuronal excitability. Interestingly, instantaneous firing frequency did not differ (Figure 3O), yet the number of spikes at a given frequency was significantly lower in D1R-fM14exp mice (Figure 3P), suggesting Mettl14 deletion alters spike frequency adaptation. These differences are likely due to altered intrinsic striatonigral signaling rather than inputs to striatonigral neurons as we found no difference in paired pulse ratio (Figure 3M). Because D1Rcre and A2ARcre direct Cre expression starting in late embryonic development (Sillivan and Konradi, 2011Sillivan S.E. Konradi C. Expression and function of dopamine receptors in the developing medial frontal cortex and striatum of the rat.Neuroscience. 2011; 199: 501-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, Weaver, 1993Weaver D.R. A2a adenosine receptor gene expression in developing rat brain.Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1993; 20: 313-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), data collected with these mouse lines may include developmental effects of Mettl14 deletion. To strictly test the necessity of Mettl14 in adult neurons, we injected an AAV encoding Cre or eGFP under control of the synapsin promoter (Syn-Cre or Syn-eGFP) bilaterally into the dorsal striatum of adult M14f/f mice. Viral-mediated Mettl14 deletion resulted in a substantial loss of METTL14 protein (Figure 4A) and reduced striatal m6A levels (Figure 4B; t = 3.14, p = 0.0199), providing the first definitive in vivo evidence that Mettl14 is indispensable for m6A modification of mRNAs in the adult brain. The remaining m6A-modified mRNA in the striatum likely reflects non-neuronal cells as well as neurons outside the range of AAV infection in the dorsal striatum. Transcriptome-wide m6A profiling showed no correlation between degree of change in m6A enrichment and fold change of mRNA levels and returned no significantly enriched GO terms in Syn-Cre mice relative to controls (Figure S2; Table S1). Lack of significance may be due to a loss in signal to noise stemming from the inclusion of striatal cells outside the injection site. Moreover, the striatal network may not sufficiently adapt after only a few weeks of m6A deficiency. Analysis of striatal-mediated behaviors showed Syn-cre mice were impaired in sensorimotor learning (Figure 4C; 4 weeks post-injection, AAV effect, F(1,9) = 5.016, p = 0.0390; 8 weeks post-injection, F(1,64) = 7.639, p = 0.0136) as well as both initial acquisition of response learning (Figure 4D; log-rank Mantel-Cox, chi-square = 9.158, p = 0.025) and reversal learning (Figure 4D; log-rank Mantel-Cox, chi-square = 14.51, p = 0.0001). Strikingly, not a single Syn-Cre mouse completed reversal training. A visible platform test revealed that Syn-Cre mice were overall slower to reach the escape platform, though this difference disappeared by the last trial (Figure 4E; F(1,56) = 5.227, p = 0.0383). We next assessed the effects of Mettl14 viral deletion on locomotor response to a D1R agonist or D2R antagonist. We found no difference in baseline ambulatory distance (Figure 4F; F(1,826) = 0.6530, p = 0.4362; Figure 4G; F(1,826) = 0.05255, p = 0.8220). Syn-Cre mice showed a significant increase in locomotor response to the D1R agonist (Figure 4F; virus × drug, F(1,16) = 11.54, p = 0.000368) and a minor increase in response to the D2R antagonist (Figure 4G; virus × drug, F(1,14) = 3.091, p = 0.1010). Brain epitranscriptomics is an emerging concept. Among post-transcriptional modifications, m6A methylation is the most abundant mammalian internal mRNA modification and plays a central role in translational control (Meyer et al., 2012Meyer K.D. Saletore Y. Zumbo P. Elemento O. Mason C.E. Jaffrey S.R.

Recent studies have implicated m6A tagging in processes such as the temporal timing of cortical development (Yoon et al., 2017Yoon K.J. Ringeling F.R. Vissers C. Jacob F. Pokrass M. Jimenez-Cyrus D.

However, the necessity of m6A tagging for normal function of neurons in the adult brain has not been definitively demonstrated. Using cell-type-specific or viral-mediated conditional deletion of Mettl14 in the striatum, we show that METTL14 is indispensable for m6A mRNA methylation in the adult mammalian brain and that m6A deficiency profoundly impacts gene expression and impairs striatal-mediated behaviors in adult mice. In the current study, we focused on the adult striatum for two reasons. First, its functional role in motor learning is well established. Second, there are two prominent and largely discrete neuronal cell types throughout the striatum—striatonigral and striatopallidal—with only a few genes differentiating identity and function. Not too surprisingly, Mettl14 deletion in either subtype led to changes in similar classes of mRNA species. While the fate of m6A-tagged mRNAs (i.e., degradation or increased ribosomal loading) depends on the binding of specific m6A reader proteins (Wang et al., 2014Wang X. Lu Z. Gomez A. Hon G.C. Yue Y. Han D. Fu Y. Parisien M. Dai Q. Jia G. et al.N6-methyladenosine-dependent regulation of messenger RNA stability.Nature. 2014; 505: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar, Wang et al., 2015Wang X. Zhao B.S.

YTHDF3 facilitates translation and decay of N6-methyladenosine-modified RNA.Cell Res. 2017; 27: 315-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar), it is remarkable that we observed a clear split in which downregulated mRNAs primarily encoded neuron- and synapse-specific proteins, and upregulated mRNAs primarily encoded globally expressed proteins involved in metabolism and translational regulation. Furthermore, it is intriguing that several mRNAs encoding striatonigral identity genes (e.g., Tac1 and Pdyn) were uniquely downregulated following striatonigral Mettl14 deletion, while striatopallidal identity genes (e.g., Penk and Drd2) were uniquely downregulated following striatopallidal Mettl14 deletion. Notably, we found no difference in overall striatal cell numbers or axonal projections in either manipulation, and dendritic morphology was normal following striatonigral Mettl14 deletion. These results suggest that Mettl14, and by extension m6A tagging, could play an important role in maintaining identity of discrete neuronal populations in adult mice. The striatum acts to filter cortical inputs, with the striatonigral and striatopallidal pathways working in concert to promote some actions while inhibiting others (Lerner and Kreitzer, 2011Lerner T.N. Kreitzer A.C. Neuromodulatory control of striatal plasticity and behavior.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2011; 21: 322-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, disruption to either striatonigral or striatopallidal neuron properties (e.g., downreguation of various ion channels) could have profound consequences. Functionally, we found increased neuronal excitability in Mettl14-deficient striatonigral neurons, yet prolonged stimulation impaired spike frequency adaptation. We speculate that such impairment (Venance and Glowinski, 2003Venance L. Glowinski J. Heterogeneity of spike frequency adaptation among medium spiny neurones from the rat striatum.Neuroscience. 2003; 122: 77-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, Ha and Cheong, 2017Ha G.E. Cheong E. Spike frequency adaptation in neurons of the central nervous system.Exp. Neurobiol. 2017; 26: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) may profoundly impact the ability of striatonigral neurons to properly integrate cortical inputs and faithfully respond to the increased activity demands that accompany learning. However, whether specific genes contribute to this phenomenon and whether such a phenomenon translates across other neural subtypes (e.g., glutamatergic projection neurons or interneurons) remain to be determined. Behaviorally, we observed impaired striatal-dependent behaviors among all three manipulations to varying extents. Mettl14 deletion in D1 neurons resulted in a more severe phenotype than Mettl14 deletion in A2A neurons. This effect may be specific to the affected pathway. Another possible explanation is that D1R, while mostly expressed in striatonigral neurons, is also expressed in some cortical neurons, whereas A2AR expression is more restricted to striatopallidal neurons. Notably, we found the most severe impairments in initial acquisition of response learning and reversal learning following pan-neuronal, viral-mediated Mettl14 deletion in the adult brain, when Mettl14 deletion was most pervasive. The present study has provided the first direct and specific evidence that m6A deficiency in a subset of neurons in the adult brain impairs learning and performance. Given that activity-dependent protein synthesis in synapses is unique to neurons and central to synaptic plasticity and learning, it is imperative to determine if and how regulation and functional consequences of m6A tagging in neurons differ from other cells. For example, different m6A reader proteins may mediate specific downstream functional consequences of m6A tagging following experience-dependent learning. Major challenges remain in determining how m6A and its reader proteins (e.g., YTHDF1, YTHDF2, YTHDF3, or other reader proteins yet to be identified) are dynamically regulated in response to neural activities, and how they in turn influence the spatial and temporal control of protein synthesis to ultimately impact behavior.

https://openalex.org/W2884658103,"Protein phosphorylation is a prevalent and ubiquitous mechanism of regulation. Kinases are popular drug targets, but identifying selective phosphatase inhibitors has been challenging. Here, we used surface plasmon resonance to design a method to enable target-based discovery of selective serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors. The method targeted a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1, PPP1R15B (R15B), a negative regulator of proteostasis. This yielded Raphin1, a selective inhibitor of R15B. In cells, Raphin1 caused a rapid and transient accumulation of its phosphorylated substrate, resulting in a transient attenuation of protein synthesis. In vitro, Raphin1 inhibits the recombinant R15B-PP1c holoenzyme, but not the closely related R15A-PP1c, by interfering with substrate recruitment. Raphin1 was orally bioavailable, crossed the blood-brain barrier, and demonstrated efficacy in a mouse model of Huntington’s disease. This identifies R15B as a druggable target and provides a platform for target-based discovery of inhibitors of serine/threonine phosphatases."

In all living cells, DNA is organized into compact structures that influence transcription, repair, and replication. In eukaryotic cells, the link between histone-induced DNA compaction and transcriptional activity is well established. Changes in histone occupancy have been shown to provide epigenetic control of transcription (Goldberg et al., 2007Goldberg A.D. Allis C.D. Bernstein E. Epigenetics: A landscape takes shape.Cell. 2007; 128: 635-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar), to block the initiation of transcription (Hartley and Madhani, 2009Hartley P.D.

In addition to compaction due to histones, eukaryotic cells can sequester DNA in membrane-free, phase-separated organelles (Hyman et al., 2014Hyman A.A. Weber C.A. Jülicher F. Liquid-liquid phase separation in biology.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2014; 30: 39-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar). These structures provide a way to selectively enrich for or exclude proteins from accessing the enclosed DNA. Some organelles, such as heterochromatin, suppress gene expression, while others, such as the nucleolus, allow for transcription to occur on the condensed DNA. Phase separation may underpin genome restructuring into transcriptionally active and silent domains in eukaryotes (Strom et al., 2017Strom A.R. Emelyanov A.V. Mir M. Fyodorov D.V. Darzacq X. Karpen G.H. Phase separation drives heterochromatin domain formation.Nature. 2017; 547: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). In bacteria, DNA is organized and condensed by nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs), a diverse and unevenly understood group (Dorman, 2013Dorman C.J. Genome architecture and global gene regulation in bacteria: Making progress towards a unified model?.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2013; 11: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Dps is a nucleoid-associated protein that was first discovered in E. coli (Almirón et al., 1992Almirón M. Link A.J. Furlong D. Kolter R. A novel DNA-binding protein with regulatory and protective roles in starved Escherichia coli.Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar), with homologs identified in over 1,000 species of bacteria and Archaea (Calhoun and Kwon, 2011Calhoun L.N.

Yoshimura S.H. Hizume K. Ohniwa R.L. Ishihama A. Takeyasu K.

While deleting dps causes few detectable phenotypes during exponential phase, Δdps cells subjected to starvation or several other forms of stress exhibit sharp decreases in survival rates (Nair and Finkel, 2004Nair S. Finkel S.E. Dps protects cells against multiple stresses during stationary phase.J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 4192-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Importantly, the DNA-binding activity is essential for the stress protection conferred by Dps (Karas et al., 2015Karas V.O. Westerlaken I. Meyer A.S. The DNA-binding protein from starved cells (Dps) utilizes dual functions to defend cells against multiple stresses.J. Bacteriol. 2015; 197: 3206-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The dramatic changes in DNA topology induced by Dps binding could potentially alter transcription, as has been observed for DNA condensed by eukaryotic histones and other prokaryotic nucleoid-associated proteins including H-NS (Hommais et al., 2001Hommais F. Krin E. Laurent-Winter C. Soutourina O. Malpertuy A. Le Caer J.P. Danchin A. Bertin P.

The density of observed Dps-DNA structures, along with differences in protein expression patterns between wild-type and Δdps cells reported during stationary phase (Almirón et al., 1992Almirón M.

A novel DNA-binding protein with regulatory and protective roles in starved Escherichia coli.Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar), has prompted suggestions that Dps may act as a pleiotropic regulator of transcription in stationary phase (Browning and Busby, 2004Browning D.F.

Genome architecture and global gene regulation in bacteria: Making progress towards a unified model?.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2013; 11: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). A recent study reported Dps-associated changes in the transcription of specific genes in exponential phase (Antipov et al., 2017Antipov S.S. Tutukina M.N. Preobrazhenskaya E.V. Kondrashov F.A. Patrushev M.V. Toshchakov S.V. Dominova I. Shvyreva U.S. Vrublevskaya V.V. Morenkov O.S. et al.The nucleoid protein Dps binds genomic DNA of Escherichia coli in a non-random manner.PLoS ONE. 2017; 12: e0182800Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), providing support for this hypothesis. In this study, we examined how Dps influences the activity of RNA polymerase (RNAP) in stationary phase. Surprisingly, we found that deletion of dps caused no significant change of global transcriptional patterns in vivo during stationary phase and produced only mild changes in the proteome. Investigation of the effect of Dps on the initiation of transcription in vitro found no changes in RNAP initiation activity at physiologically relevant Dps concentrations. To probe the effects of Dps on RNAP elongation in vitro, we used a single-molecule transcription assay to examine whether Dps-mediated DNA compaction could induce RNAP pausing or arrest during transcriptional elongation. We again found no significant change in RNAP transcription dynamics. We conclude that in contrast to histones and other specific nucleoid-associated proteins, Dps does not affect transcription during stationary phase. Instead, Dps provides the first identified example of a DNA-binding protein that can completely decouple DNA condensation from transcriptional regulation, providing bacteria greater freedom to tailor transcriptional responses to various sources of stress while protecting the genome from damage. We propose that Dps achieves this decoupling by creating a phase-separated organelle in bacteria that is permeable to RNAP. While isolated Dps biocrystals have been observed in vivo by electron microscopy (Frenkiel-Krispin et al., 2001Frenkiel-Krispin D. Levin-Zaidman S. Shimoni E. Wolf S.G. Wachtel E.J. Arad T.

Frenkiel D. Arad T. Finkel S.E. Kolter R. Minsky A. DNA protection by stress-induced biocrystallization.Nature. 1999; 400: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), the overall effect of Dps on the compaction of the nucleoid of intact cells has not been measured directly. We therefore set out to measure the size of the nucleoid in a wild-type E. coli strain as well as in its isogenic Δdps derivative (Karas et al., 2015Karas V.O. Westerlaken I. Meyer A.S. The DNA-binding protein from starved cells (Dps) utilizes dual functions to defend cells against multiple stresses.J. Bacteriol. 2015; 197: 3206-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Our expectation, based on atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies on nucleoids extracted from cells (Kim et al., 2004Kim J. Yoshimura S.H. Hizume K. Ohniwa R.L. Ishihama A. Takeyasu K. Fundamental structural units of the Escherichia coli nucleoid revealed by atomic force microscopy.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1982-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), was that the formation of Dps complexes in the wild-type strain should lead to a compact nucleoid (Figure 1A) compared to the Δdps strain (Figure 1B). Cultures of wild-type and Δdps strains were incubated for 24 (stationary phase) or 96 (late stationary phase) hr. Western blot analysis confirmed that Dps protein levels in the wild-type strain increased dramatically upon entering stationary phase (Figures S1A and S1B), consistent with previous results (Ali Azam et al., 1999Ali Azam T. Iwata A. Nishimura A. Ueda S. Ishihama A. Growth phase-dependent variation in protein composition of the Escherichia coli nucleoid.J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6361-6370Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, De Martino et al., 2016De Martino M. Ershov D. van den Berg P.J. Tans S.J. Meyer A.S. Single-cell analysis of the Dps response to oxidative stress.J. Bacteriol. 2016; 198: 1662-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Nucleoids of the stationary-phase cells were labeled with the fluorescent nucleic acid stain Hoechst 33258. Cells were imaged using fluorescence and phase-contrast microscopy, and both the length of the cell and the length of the nucleoid were measured along the long axis of individual cells (Figures 1C and 1D). The ratio of these lengths was averaged over ≥130 individual cells for each condition tested (Figure 1E). The presence of Dps caused a significant reduction in the fractional length of the nucleoid in both 24- and 96-hr starved cells, whereas cell length remained unchanged in all conditions (Figure S1C). Compared to wild-type cells, Δdps nucleoids exhibited an increase in length of 24% at 24 hr and 34% at 96 hr. We conclude that a significant fraction of the genome is condensed by Dps in stationary phase, consistent with a previous estimate that Dps occupies a large but incomplete fraction of the stationary-phase nucleoid (Talukder and Ishihama, 2015Talukder A. Ishihama A. Growth phase dependent changes in the structure and protein composition of nucleoid in Escherichia coli.Sci. China Life Sci. 2015; 58: 902-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To test whether compaction of the nucleoid by Dps might influence transcription, we used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to survey the entire transcriptome (Wang et al., 2009Wang Z. Gerstein M. Snyder M. RNA-seq: A revolutionary tool for transcriptomics.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2009; 10: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (8510) Google Scholar). Cultures of wild-type and Δdps strains were again incubated for 24 or 96 hr, and RNA was isolated from the cells (Figure S2A). In order to focus specifically on changes to mRNA levels, we depleted the rRNA, generated cDNA libraries, and sequenced the resulting fragments. For each condition, we collected and analyzed more than 10 million aligned read pairs (Figures S2B–S2D). The isolated RNA samples were of high quality (Figure S2A), suggesting negligible degradation. Quantification of the RNA levels demonstrated that Dps did not have a significant influence on either the total RNA extracted or the overall amount of mRNA recovered (Figures 2A and S2E).Figure 2Dps Has No Influence on the Transcriptome and Mild Influence on the Proteome in Stationary-Phase E. coli CellsShow full caption(A) The relative amounts of total RNA and mRNA (mean ± SE).(B) Differential expression analysis of RNA sequencing.

Strikingly, the wild-type and Δdps strains showed a nearly one-to-one relationship in mRNA expression patterns after 24 hr of starvation, with 99.84% of genes exhibiting less than a 2-fold change (Figure 2B). Statistical analysis (Trapnell et al., 2010Trapnell C. Williams B.A. Pertea G. Mortazavi A. Kwan G. van Baren M.J. Salzberg S.L. Wold B.J. Pachter L. Transcript assembly and quantification by RNA-seq reveals unannotated transcripts and isoform switching during cell differentiation.Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (10646) Google Scholar) showed that only two genes, dps and flu, show significant variation when analyzed individually (p < 0.05). In order to adjust for multiple testing, we derived the q values (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995Benjamini Y. Hochberg Y. Controlling the false discovery rate: A practical and powerful approach to multiple testing.J. R. Stat. Soc. B. 1995; 57: 289-300Google Scholar), which left dps as the sole gene with significant variation (Figure 2C). The same analysis was applied to the data obtained after 96 hr of starvation, and an almost identical pattern was observed (Figure S2F). To confirm the sensitivity of the RNA-seq technique, we determined differential expression between samples taken from the Δdps strain at 24 and 96 hr of starvation. Here, the q values indicated significant variation in the expression of 67 genes (Figure S2G). We further verified our RNA-seq results by independently analyzing the changes in expression of several E. coli genes using qPCR (Figure S3). With the exception of flu, none of these genes exhibited significant variation in expression level between the wild-type and Δdps strains. However, flu is a phase-variable gene with an ON/OFF heritable expression pattern that can persist for many generations until undergoing a spontaneous switch (Diderichsen, 1980Diderichsen B. flu, a metastable gene controlling surface properties of Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 858-867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Changes in flu expression therefore cannot be unambiguously attributed to Dps. Our results clearly demonstrate that Dps does not influence mRNA levels in stationary-phase bacteria. Our transcriptome results were unexpected given that a two-dimensional PAGE analysis indicated that Dps influences the expression levels of several proteins in stationary phase (Almirón et al., 1992Almirón M. Link A.J. Furlong D. Kolter R. A novel DNA-binding protein with regulatory and protective roles in starved Escherichia coli.Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). To assess whether Dps can influence protein abundances in vivo, we directly measured changes in the proteome using SILAC (stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture), a sensitive mass spectrometry technique (Ong et al., 2003Ong S.E. Foster L.J. Mann M. Mass spectrometric-based approaches in quantitative proteomics.Methods. 2003; 29: 124-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). We constructed double Arg–/Lys– auxotroph derivatives of our wild-type and Δdps strains of E. coli and grew them in synthetic media containing arginine and lysine labeled with either light or heavy isotopes. This differential labeling allowed us to compare the protein levels of the two strains directly in a single MALDI mass spectrometry assay by determining the isotope ratios of individual proteins. Although overall protein levels were not altered between the wild-type and Δdps strains (Figure 2D), analysis of the SILAC data revealed greater variability between the protein expression levels of the two strains compared to the variability observed for the mRNA. Within the proteome, 4.9% of detected proteins exhibited more than a 2-fold change (Figure 2E). Statistical analysis (Kammers et al., 2015Kammers K. Cole R.N. Tiengwe C. Ruczinski I. Detecting significant changes in protein abundance.EuPA Open Proteom. 2015; 7: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) revealed that 12% of the protein species could be assigned significant p values, and three of these proteins were deemed significant using q values (Figure 2F). Those proteins were Dps itself along with two enzymes involved in amino acid synthesis, anthranilate synthase component 1 and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase. Our SILAC data demonstrate a mild but detectable change in the proteome. However, given the lack of any detectable change in mRNA levels using the more sensitive RNA-seq assay, these changes in the proteome cannot be attributed to transcription. Instead, Dps must influence rates of protein synthesis or protein degradation during stationary phase. One possible way to reconcile our RNA-seq results would be if Dps somehow avoided condensing promoter sequences. To test this hypothesis, we examined Dps binding in vitro to linear DNA fragments containing RNAP promoter sequences (Figure S4A). We selected four promoters that control a diverse set of genes: the rrnB P1 promoter that regulates rRNA and tRNA expression, the recA promoter that participates in the SOS response, the bacteriophage λ PR promoter, and the promoter for flu, the only gene that was detectably upregulated at the mRNA level in stationary-phase cells. We used a gel shift assay to measure the fraction of DNA condensed by Dps (Figure S4B). Similar concentrations of Dps were required to bind and condense DNA containing each promoter (Figure 3A; Table S1), consistent with reports that Dps exhibits loose sequence specificity (Azam and Ishihama, 1999Azam T.A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 33105-33113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar).Figure 3Dps Allows RNAP to Bind to Promoters but Excludes KpnI Restriction Enzyme from Its Target SiteShow full caption(A) Gel shift analysis of Dps binding to linear promoter DNA fragments.

DNA:Dps complexes were dissociated by heparin. See also Figures S4 and S5. Since Dps was capable of condensing these promoters, we next directly measured its effect on the first steps of transcript initiation in vitro. Linear DNA containing the recA promoter was incubated with various concentrations of Dps, spanning the critical DNA-condensing range. Next, RNAP holoenzyme was added, along with a dinucleotide RNA primer and a radiolabeled nucleotide triphosphate corresponding to the next position on the template. If the DNA remains accessible to RNAP in the presence of Dps, then an open complex should rapidly form, allowing RNAP to engage in multiple rounds of synthesis of abortive RNA trimers. At all Dps concentrations tested, we detected significant trimer production (Figure 3B). Although high concentrations of Dps reduced trimer synthesis, no noticeable change occurred near the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 0.54 μM when Dps first condenses the DNA. A similar pattern was observed for the λ PR promoter (Figure S4C). Even at high Dps concentrations where partial inhibition of trimer synthesis occurred, Dps did not interfere with binding of the RNAP holoenzyme to the promoter. When trimer production is measured as a function of time, the rate of production follows the functional form kss(1−e−t/τoc), where τoc is a characteristic time constant associated with open complex formation and kss is the steady-state rate of trimer production (McClure, 1980McClure W.R. Rate-limiting steps in RNA chain initiation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1980; 77: 5634-5638Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). We found τoc for the λ PR promoter to be indistinguishable in the absence and presence of 4 μM Dps, even though kss was reduced by 47% (Figures S4D and S4E). We therefore conclude that high concentrations of Dps interfere with steps of initiation subsequent to open complex formation, e.g., the binding of nucleotide substrates. Since Dps did not block RNAP holoenzyme from binding promoters, we next asked whether Dps could block other enzymes from accessing bound DNA. Our recA, rrnB P1, and λ PR promoter sequences each contain recognition sites for restriction endonucleases (KpnI, HindIII, and HincII, respectively), allowing direct comparison of restriction enzyme activity to that of RNAP. Pre-incubating each DNA molecule with saturating Dps (4 μM) was sufficient to completely block the activity of the corresponding restriction enzyme (Figures S4F and S4G). We then explored the effects of a range of Dps concentrations spanning the critical DNA-condensing concentrations for these promoter sequences (Figure S4H). In contrast to RNAP holoenzyme, we found that the activity of restriction enzymes decreased sharply with increasing Dps concentrations, and significant protection was observed even at concentrations near the apparent KD (Figure 3C). To confirm that this protection was specifically associated with the binding of Dps to DNA, we probed the effect of two Dps point mutations (K8A and K10A) that lower the affinity of Dps for DNA (Karas et al., 2015Karas V.O. Westerlaken I. Meyer A.S. The DNA-binding protein from starved cells (Dps) utilizes dual functions to defend cells against multiple stresses.J. Bacteriol. 2015; 197: 3206-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Wild-type or modified Dps was added to the three promoter DNA fragments to test their relative ability to protect against restriction enzyme cleavage (Figures 3D, S4I, and S4J). At a concentration of 4 μM, wild-type Dps bound nearly all the DNA template while K8A and K10A Dps bound almost none. We found that K8A and K10A Dps were unable to protect the promoter fragments from KpnI, HindIII, or HincII restriction activity, while the wild-type Dps again showed full protection. We conclude that Dps blocks the restriction enzymes tested specifically by binding and condensing DNA. To measure the effect of Dps on other proteins related to transcriptional regulation, we looked at the activity of the transcriptional repressor LexA (Butala et al., 2009Butala M. Zgur-Bertok D. Busby S.J. The bacterial LexA transcriptional repressor.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2009; 66: 82-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) using a run-off transcription assay on the recA template (Figure S5). LexA inhibited transcription both in the presence and absence of 2 μM Dps. The σ70-dependent recA promoter contains canonical −35 and −10 elements that are also recognized by σs (Gaal et al., 2001Gaal T. Ross W. Estrem S.T. Nguyen L.H. Burgess R.R. Gourse R.L.

Adult hippocampal neurogenesis arises from radial neural stem cells (rNSCs) within a specialized local niche in the adult dentate gyrus (DG). Neuronal activity and experience, acting on this local niche, regulate rNSCs and subsequent hippocampal neurogenesis (Song et al., 2012Song J. Zhong C. Bonaguidi M.A. Sun G.J. Hsu D. Gu Y. Meletis K. Huang Z.J. Ge S.

Olsen R.H. Sun J. Ming G.L. Song H. Neuronal circuitry mechanisms regulating adult mammalian neurogenesis.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2016; 8: 8Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Within the DG neurogenic niche, mossy cells (MCs) are one of the major glutamatergic neurons and innervate both mature granule cells (GCs) and local interneurons that make GABAergic synapses onto GCs (Scharfman, 1995Scharfman H.E. Electrophysiological evidence that dentate hilar mossy cells are excitatory and innervate both granule cells and interneurons.J. Neurophysiol. 1995; 74: 179-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Recently, MCs have received tremendous attention because of their critical roles in cognition, their vulnerability to glutamate excitotoxicity in temporal lobe epilepsy, and their potential involvement in neuropsychiatric disorders (Scharfman, 2016Scharfman H.E. The enigmatic mossy cell of the dentate gyrus.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2016; 17: 562-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To date, very few studies have examined the influence of MCs on hippocampal neurogenesis, though it has been suggested that MCs could be important because they provide the first glutamatergic synaptic inputs, as well as disynaptic GABAergic inputs, onto newborn GCs (Chancey et al., 2014Chancey J.H. Poulsen D.J. Wadiche J.I. Overstreet-Wadiche L. Hilar mossy cells provide the first glutamatergic synapses to adult-born dentate granule cells.J.

Monosynaptic inputs to new neurons in the dentate gyrus.Nat. Commun. 2012; 3: 1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). MCs project axons along the septo-temporal axis of the ipsilateral DG (associational pathway) as well as to the contralateral DG (commissural pathway) (Buckmaster et al., 1996Buckmaster P.S. Wenzel H.J. Kunkel D.D. Schwartzkroin P.A. Axon arbors and synaptic connections of hippocampal mossy cells in the rat in vivo.J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 366: 271-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). These axons target the inner molecular layer (IML) of the DG and extend collaterals within the hilus (Scharfman and Myers, 2013Scharfman H.E. Myers C.E. Hilar mossy cells of the dentate gyrus: a historical perspective.Front. Neural Circuits. 2013; 6: 106Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The localization of MC collaterals in the IML and hilus is particularly intriguing because it is closely associated with the neurogenic niche where rNSCs and local interneurons reside. It remains unknown whether and how MCs contribute to the functional regulation of rNSCs and subsequent hippocampal neurogenesis. Using an array of circuit-based approaches in combination with stereological analysis of rNSCs, we demonstrate that MC commissural projections structurally and functionally interact with rNSCs through both the direct glutamatergic MC-rNSC pathway and the indirect GABAergic MC-local interneuron-rNSC pathway. Strikingly, rNSC quiescence is dynamically regulated through the balance of direct and indirect pathways onto rNSCs under various MC activity states. Under a moderate MC activation state, MCs increase rNSC quiescence through the dominant indirect pathway. In contrast, under a high MC activation state, MCs increase rNSC activation through the dominant direct pathway. Interestingly, both inhibition and chronic ablation of MCs lead to a transient increase of rNSC activation, likely due to reduced GABA signaling mediated by the indirect pathway, but rNSC depletion only occurs upon chronic ablation of MCs. These results suggest that MC inhibition and ablation represent distinct MC activity patterns onto rNSCs. In summary, our study identifies MCs as a critical stem cell niche component that controls rNSC quiescence and long-term maintenance under various MC activity states through a dynamic balance of direct and indirect pathways onto rNSCs. To examine the structural interaction between MCs and rNSCs, we injected AAV carrying CaMKII-driven mCherry (AAV-CaMKII-mCherry) into the hilus of Nestin-GFP mice to label excitatory neurons and found that the majority of mCherry-labeled cells are dentate GCs and hilar MCs, along with some CA3c pyramidal cells (Figures 1A and 1B ). Since GCs and pyramidal cells do not project to the contralateral DG (Hsu et al., 2016Hsu T.T. Lee C.T. Tai M.H. Lien C.C. Differential recruitment of dentate gyrus interneuron types by commissural versus perforant pathways.Cereb. Cortex. 2016; 26: 2715-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we limited our structural and functional analyses to the contralateral side for specificity. Within the hilus, injection of AAV-CaMKII-mCherry labeled ∼82% of GluR2/3+ cells (specific marker for MCs) and ∼94% of AAV-CaMKII-mCherry-labeled cells were positive for GluR2/3 (Figures 1C and 1D), thus validating the efficiency and specificity of CaMKII-driven AAVs for targeting MCs. We next examined whether direct morphological associations exist between MC commissural projections and rNSCs. Confocal imaging of contralateral brain sections from Nestin-GFP mice unilaterally injected with AAV-CaMKII-mCherry revealed close associations between MC commissural IML projections and distal thin processes of GFP+ rNSCs (Figure 1E). We further examined MC commissural projections and the distal processes of the rNSCs using serial section immuno-electron microscopy (Immuno-EM). We found that rNSC processes extended into the IML and ensheathed excitatory synapses between MC commissural axons and GCs (Figures 1F–1Q; Videos S1, S2, and S3). This is consistent with the concept that MCs directly mediate tonic glutamatergic signaling onto rNSCs. Additionally, immunogold labeling revealed NMDA receptor (NMDAR) NR1 subunits in the perisynaptic processes of rNSC in the IML (Figure S1; Video S4). These data provide high-resolution structural support for a direct glutamatergic MC-rNSC pathway. MCs also interact with several distinct types of dentate GABAergic interneurons (Hsu et al., 2016Hsu T.T. Lee C.T. Tai M.H. Lien C.C. Differential recruitment of dentate gyrus interneuron types by commissural versus perforant pathways.Cereb.

Electrophysiological evidence that dentate hilar mossy cells are excitatory and innervate both granule cells and interneurons.J. Neurophysiol. 1995; 74: 179-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). It is possible that there is a substantial disynaptic GABAergic pathway onto the rNSCs. To examine the indirect association of MC commissural projections with rNSCs via dentate GABA interneurons, we injected AAV-CaMKII-eGFP into one DG for labeling MCs and AAV-hSyn-DIO-mCherry into the opposite DG to label local GABA interneurons using VGAT-Cre mice (Figure 1R). Confocal microscopy showed that MC commissural hilar projections closely associated with somas of dentate GABAergic interneurons (Figure 1R). Contralateral MC axons were further immunostained and imaged by electron microscopy. In the hilus, MC axons formed asymmetric (putatively glutamatergic) synapses directly on dendrites. These dendrites received multiple inputs from non-labeled asymmetric axons (Figures 1S, 1S′, 1T, and 1T′), which are typical features of parvalbumin (PV)-expressing basket cell dendrites (Ribak and Seress, 1983Ribak C.E. Seress L. Five types of basket cell in the hippocampal dentate gyrus: a combined Golgi and electron microscopic study.J. Neurocytol. 1983; 12: 577-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). MC axons were also found to synapse with hilar dendritic spines, suggestive of non-basket cell interneurons (Figures 1U and 1V). These results thus provide morphological support for an indirect GABAergic pathway. While rNSCs do not possess synapses and typically exhibit hyperpolarized membrane potentials (Vm), single-cell analysis has detected mRNAs for both GABA and glutamate receptors (Shin et al., 2015Shin J. Berg D.A. Zhu Y. Shin J.Y. Song J. Bonaguidi M.A. Enikolopov G. Nauen D.W. Christian K.M. Ming G.L. Song H. Single-cell RNA-seq with waterfall reveals molecular cascades underlying adult neurogenesis.Cell Stem Cell. 2015; 17: 360-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether these receptors are functional in rNSCs, which could potentially mediate both direct and indirect pathways onto rNSCs, we recorded Vm from Nestin-GFP+ rNSCs in response to bath application of glutamate or muscimol (GABAA receptor agonist). Interestingly, in the presence of TTX, bath application of muscimol hyperpolarized rNSCs (Figure 1W), while bath application of glutamate depolarized rNSCs (Figure 1X). Taken together, our morphological data and electrophysiological recordings suggest that rNSCs are regulated by both glutamatergic and GABAergic signaling, potentially mediated by MC direct and indirect pathways, respectively (Figure 1Y). eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiIyOTQxZmVjNjk2Zjk2ZTVmMjVlN2RkMzc5ZTMxZDJmNiIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc3ODMwNzAwfQ.Ux55VjEWzeK-2_G4QpAidb103XCtUHRMyycl74EncBDxsXf_jNxoOJ6K7-3JGo-LCnMBVfXP8lS2I73uRgWFSmQJ7V-irTaxXp6qkGd2NHucq_uLNFhUrt9U-rQW8nAm8MMxDGFOAKRSanznNbQ9YLfVrMl6JJ-KTzcVVEE6OPJgx_uqWH4z-swqoNV8mU25IRGdmDrIKltjkBn2dEbJDxtYbvHWmpnoYVareZbLGmi8sneHv_MB1IIBRBpfj6aFs9hSkZjIqm4XFX7GLdnB7cYj71cSI4D7412qgFbJ-YscbHLMvaLzrP1CUw_XBuckZPHd3P8ZVqWga2aIWnCVLw Download .mp4 (19.46 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S1. rNSC Processes Ensheath Synapses, Related to Figure 1Rotation of 3D reconstruction showing rNSC processes (green) with apposing axons embedded into the side of the larger stem cell processes (warm colors), two of which are DAB-labeled hilar mossy cell axons (purple and orange). eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiIxMmJiYzAwOTUwMzE1NzNlMzUyM2NiOTRhOGJlZGMxNiIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc3ODMwNzAwfQ.sBvX0HX8UsO9bUuF4jHnmozkwYOQ2TFXPN8UEn9YEKk_uKTrKJOfh_nUZboR_E-wqA7ebGyYcqizjI3wV7cK6UsPN_lN2xsATSqLv0jMNZogNpk31TUcJzzK5P5zabDsJMQU8BwFxg9_2QlF2xxcsXa481S4wDvPdh0XgxlsKTd2ifT0u0YIJyWxp21kvHWI7m11HXYDw_Dk9BWsD36Gbe7KmQU_d6tg8eQ4AeNPbiiYyodLCAkwvooHQGpaOm9i8ANNcK94sJvge5LB-AziT8qEJaP3qg-4rGZeZ4MAE5_0_BGLiG7AfgbDsW5hIAviAalV-L9O8jkNYZ9K1OwIjg Download .mp4 (20.98 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S2. rNSC Processes Ensheath an Axon Terminal of MC Commissural Projections, Related to Figure 1Rotation of 3D reconstruction showing an rNSC process (green) directly apposing a synapse formed by a DAB-labeled hilar mossy cell axon (orange) with the dendritic spine of a granule neuron dendrite (light blue).

Cell-wide Expression of NR1 in rNSC, Related to Figure 1 and Figure S1Rotation of 3D reconstruction showing NR1 gold particles in an entire rNSC. To examine the functional interaction between MCs and rNSCs, we unilaterally injected a mixture of AAV carrying CaMKII-driven excitatory DREADDs (AAV-CaMKII-HA-hM3Dq-mCitrine) and AAV carrying CaMKII-driven mCherry (AAV-CaMKII-mCherry) into the hilus of Nestin-GFP mice and recorded Vm from contralateral GFP+ rNSCs upon chemogenetic activation of MC commissural projections (Figure 2A; Figure S2A). Co-injecting two viruses facilitated the identification of MC commissural projections for electrophysiological recording, as mCitrine was not readily visualized by our fluorescence microscope. MC commissural projections at the contralateral side were detected 14 days after viral injection using immunostaining against the hemagglutinin (HA) tag (Figures 2B and 2C), indicating that hM3Dq was efficiently transported to the contralateral terminals. We then dissected the functional effects of MC-mediated direct and indirect pathways on the Vm of the rNSCs. We first examined the MC direct pathway onto rNSCs. We recorded GFP+ rNSCs upon chemogenetic activation of MC commissural projections in the presence of GABAA receptor blocker bicuculline in order to uncover potential glutamatergic components. Strikingly, we observed a significant depolarization in 41% of rNSCs ranging from 10 to 50 mV upon bath application of clozapine N-oxide (CNO) to activate MC commissural projections (Figures 2D–2F). This depolarizing effect was not observed in the GFP+ rNSCs from non-viral-injected mice in the presence of bicuculline and CNO (Figure 2G), confirming that CNO by itself did not influence the Vm of the rNSCs. The highly variable depolarizing responses from rNSCs highlight a heterogeneity of rNSCs. Morphological heterogeneity in the height of rNSCs primary radial process has been recently reported (Gebara et al., 2016Gebara E. Bonaguidi M.A. Beckervordersandforth R. Sultan S. Udry F. Gijs P.J. Lie D.C. Ming G.L. Song H. Toni N. Heterogeneity of radial glia-like cells in the adult hippocampus.Stem Cells. 2016; 34: 997-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Since MCs project axons to a specific molecular layer domain (Figures 1B, 1E, and 2C), we examined the reach of rNSCs into the IML and found that ∼35% of the rNSCs reach MC projections (Figures S2B and S2C). Next, we dissected the glutamate receptor subtypes mediating MC-induced rNSC depolarization. Recent single-cell RNA-sequencing data revealed AMPA receptor (AMPAR) and NMDAR expression in rNSCs (Shin et al., 2015Shin J. Berg D.A. Zhu Y. Shin J.Y. Song J. Bonaguidi M.A. Enikolopov G. Nauen D.W. Christian K.M. Ming G.L. Song H. Single-cell RNA-seq with waterfall reveals molecular cascades underlying adult neurogenesis.Cell Stem Cell. 2015; 17: 360-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar); therefore, we recorded GFP+ rNSCs upon bath application of CNO in the presence of bicuculline and NMDAR blocker APV or AMPAR blocker NBQX. Interestingly, we found that rNSCs still depolarized upon adding CNO despite NMDAR (Figures 2H and 2J) or AMPAR (Figures 2I and 2K) blockade, and the depolarization magnitude was not significantly different from bicuculline-only conditions (Figure 2L). These results suggest that NMDARs and AMPARs have redundant functions in mediating MC-induced rNSC depolarization. Furthermore, we addressed whether combined NMDA and AMPA components mediate MC-induced rNSC depolarization with two sets of experiments. First, we recorded rNSCs upon adding CNO in the presence of both APV and NBQX along with bicuculline and did not observe rNSC depolarization; however, after washing both glutamate blockers away, CNO-mediated rNSC depolarization was regained (Figures 2M and 2O). Second, we added CNO first to induce rNSC depolarization, which was later abolished upon adding glutamate receptor blockers (Figures 2N and 2O). Together, these data support the combined involvement of both AMPARs and NMDARs in mediating MC-induced rNSC depolarization. To validate the chemogenetic manipulation, we also recorded the Vm of rNSCs upon optogenetic stimulation of MC commissural projections in contralateral brain slices prepared from Nestin-GFP mice injected with AAV-CaMKII-ChR2-mCherry (Figure S2D). We recorded in the presence of GABAA receptor blocker bicuculline to uncover the glutamatergic component. Consistent with depolarization of rNSCs induced by chemogenetic activation of MCs, we observed light-evoked depolarization of rNSCs in response to optogenetic activation of MC commissural projections (Figure S2E). Though the depolarization amplitude appeared small and the kinetics were slow, the responses were phase-locked to the light delivery onto the MC commissural projections. To enhance the reliability of light-evoked responses in rNSCs, we added low-concentration K+ channel blocker 4-AP (Grubb and Burrone, 2010Grubb M.S. Burrone J. Channelrhodopsin-2 localised to the axon initial segment.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e13761Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Indeed, this resulted in reliable, robust depolarization in rNSCs upon blue light stimulations (Figures S2F and S2G). Thus, both chemogenetic and optogenetic approaches confirm a glutamatergic direct pathway onto rNSCs. Since local GABAergic interneurons regulate quiescence of rNSCs (Song et al., 2012Song J. Zhong C. Bonaguidi M.A. Sun G.J. Hsu D. Gu Y. Meletis K. Huang Z.J. Ge S. Enikolopov G. et al.Neuronal circuitry mechanism regulating adult quiescent neural stem-cell fate decision.Nature. 2012; 489: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), we next examined the plausibility of an indirect MC-GABAergic pathway regulating rNSCs. To probe the functional role of the MC commissural pathway in exciting local GABA interneurons, we injected a mixture of AAV-CaMKII-HA-hM3Dq-mCitrine and AAV-CaMKII-mCherry to one DG to label MCs and a Cre-dependent calcium sensor AAV-DIO-GCaMP6 to the other DG to label GABA cells using VGAT-Cre mice (Figure 3A). We examined calcium signals of dentate GABA interneurons in response to chemogenetic activation of MC commissural projections by bath application of CNO and observed a significant increase of Ca2+ signals in 48% of GABA interneurons located at the subgranular zone (SGZ; 40% responding), hilus (50% responding), and granule cell layer (GCL; 60% responding) upon CNO application (Figures 3B–3F), suggesting that activation of MC commissural projections excites local GABA interneurons. Interestingly, CNO-induced responses in dentate GABA neurons were highly heterogeneous (Figures 3B–3D), consistent with the recent finding that the MC commissural pathway preferentially recruits several subsets of dentate GABA interneurons (Hsu et al., 2016Hsu T.T. Lee C.T. Tai M.H. Lien C.C. Differential recruitment of dentate gyrus interneuron types by commissural versus perforant pathways.Cereb. Cortex. 2016; 26: 2715-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Dentate PV interneurons can functionally interact with and regulate rNSCs (Song et al., 2012Song J. Zhong C. Bonaguidi M.A. Sun G.J. Hsu D. Gu Y. Meletis K. Huang Z.J. Ge S. Enikolopov G. et al.Neuronal circuitry mechanism regulating adult quiescent neural stem-cell fate decision.Nature. 2012; 489: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), and our Ca2+ imaging showed that 32% of the responding cells were from the SGZ, where PV basket cells reside (Figure 3G). Therefore, we hypothesized that PV basket cells in part mediate the MC GABAergic indirect pathway onto rNSCs. To probe the functional role of the MC commissural pathway in regulating PV excitability, we repeated the same injections in PV-Cre mice (as for VGAT-Cre; Figure 3H) and observed a significant increase in the Ca2+ signals in 50% of PV interneurons upon CNO (Figures 3I and 3J), suggesting that PV interneurons in part mediate the MC GABAergic indirect pathway onto rNSCs. The presence of direct and indirect pathways onto rNSCs raised a question of the net effects of MC commissural projections on rNSCs under different MC activation states. The extent of neuronal activation using chemogenetic approaches is typically CNO dose dependent (Sternson and Roth, 2014Sternson S.M. Roth B.L. Chemogenetic tools to interrogate brain functions.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2014; 37: 387-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). We first examined rNSCs in acute brain slices prepared from adult Nestin-GFP mice injected with CaMKII-hM3Dq by recording the GFP+ rNSCs using CNO concentrations of 10 and 50 μM to represent moderate and high activation states of MCs. We recorded rNSCs in the absence of the GABA and glutamate receptor blockers to reflect the natural states of the circuit. We found that 10 μM CNO did not induce significant changes in the Vm of the rNSCs (Figures 4A and 4C ); in contrast, 50 μM CNO induced significant depolarization in rNSCs (Figures 4B and 4C). Furthermore, the high-concentration CNO-induced depolarization was abolished in the presence of AMPAR and NMDAR blockers (Figures 4D–4F), suggesting that ionotropic glutamate receptors mediate membrane depolarization in rNSCs during high MC activation. Interestingly, we occasionally observed rapid depolarizing membrane potential transients during the bath application of 50 μM CNO in the presence of AMPA and NMDA blockers (Figures 4D and 4E), which is in sharp contrast to the prolonged depolarization without the AMPA and NMDA blockers (Figure 4B), suggesting the potential involvement of other MC-induced niche signals onto rNSCs under the high MC activation state. Importantly, these membrane transients did not affect the overall Vm of the rNSCs. Together, these results suggest a switch from indirect pathway dominance at moderate MC activation state (low-dose CNO) to direct pathway dominance at high MC activation state (high-dose CNO). To examine the circuit mechanism underlying this switch, we performed Ca2+ imaging and electrophysiology in acute slices to address dose-dependent effects of CNO on MCs and PV cells. Our Ca2+ imaging analysis revealed a significant increase in MCs that responded to high CNO concentrations (Figures S3A and S3B) as well as a trend of CNO dose dependence (Figure S3C). Calcium imaging provided a quick readout for MC activity upon chemogenetic activation, but to get a more precise measurement of MC firing rates, we performed cell-attached electrophysiology recording. We observed a significant increase of MC firing at both low- and high-dose CNO as compared to baseline (Figures 4G–4I). Importantly, the increase of MC firing rate was dose dependent. Next, we performed cell-attached recording in dentate PV cells upon various CNO doses to address CNO dose-dependent effects on the indirect pathway. Similarly, we observed a significant increase of PV firing rate at both low- and high-dose CNO as compared to the baseline, and the increase of PV firing rate was dose dependent (Figures 4J–4L). From our slice recording, it appears that PV cells have a higher basal firing rate than MCs (Figures 4G and 4J). Interestingly, low-dose CNO increased MC and PV firing rates by 3- and 37-fold, respectively (Figures 4I and 4L), compared to the baselines. In contrast, high-dose CNO increased MC and PV firing rates by 28- and 55-fold, respectively (Figures 4I and 4L). Together, these results reveal a differential regulation of MC and PV responses to low- and high-dose CNO: low-dose CNO increased the firing rate of PV cells 12 times that of the increase in MCs, while high-dose CNO increased the firing rate of PV cells only 2 times that of the increase in MCs. These results thus suggest that the indirect pathway is more sensitive to low-dose CNO treatment, which subsequently leads to more pronounced interneuron firing and GABA release. Together, these results provide mechanistic insights into the switch from indirect pathway dominance to direct pathway dominance at high-dose CNO. To address the in vivo effects of CNO dose-dependent MC activation, we performed c-Fos staining at both ipsilateral and contralateral DGs in wild-type (WT) mice injected with AAV-CaMKII-hM3Dq. At the ipsilateral side, we quantified c-Fos+ MC somas, while at contralateral side, we quantified c-Fos+ dentate GCs. Interestingly, we observed that low- and high-dose CNO similarly increased the density of c-Fos+ MCs at the ipsilateral side (Figures 4M and 4N), but only high-dose CNO induced a significant increase of the density of c-Fos+ cells in the contralateral GCL (Figures 4O and 4P). Additionally, high-dose CNO did not significantly alter the distribution of the c-Fos+ GCs within the GCL between control and hM3Dq groups (Figure S3D). These results suggest that though both CNO doses induced MC activation, only high-dose CNO induced sufficient glutamate release to excite contralateral GCs and rNSCs. To probe the function of MCs in regulating rNSCs in vivo, we administered low- or high-dose CNO drinking water (0.25 or 1 mg/200 mL) in C57BL6 mice injected with control AAV-CaMKII-eGFP (or AAV-CaMKII-mCherry) or excitatory DREADDs AAV-CaMKII-hM3Dq-mCherry for 4 days, followed by thymidine analog EdU injections on the last day to label the proliferating cells (Figure 4Q). Activated rNSCs were identified as contralateral SGZ cells with Nestin+ radial processes and EdU incorporation (Figure S3E). Stereological analysis showed that chemogenetic activation of MCs at low-dose CNO led to a significant decrease in"

In mice developmentally deficient for striatal dopamine, direct pathway D1-SPNs failed to undergo maturation of excitability past P18 and maintained hyperexcitability into adulthood. We found that the absence of D1-SPN maturation was due to altered phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate dynamics and a consequent lack of normal ontogenetic increases in Kir2 currents. Dopamine replacement corrected these deficits in SPN excitability when provided from birth or during a specific period of juvenile development (P18–P28), but not during adulthood.

These results identify a sensitive period of dopamine-dependent striatal maturation, with implications for the pathophysiology and treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders. Selecting an appropriate action in response to environmental stimuli is critical to learning and survival. The basal ganglia encompass subcortical circuits essential to action selection. Perturbations of basal ganglia development are suggested to enhance susceptibility to drug use and neuropsychiatric disease later in life (Spear, 2000Spear L.P. The adolescent brain and age-related behavioral manifestations.Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 2000; 24: 417-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar). The elucidation of mechanisms that regulate basal ganglia development is thus important for unveiling the pathophysiology of multiple disorders. The main input nucleus of the basal ganglia—the striatum—undergoes significant postnatal development during the first through the fourth postnatal weeks (Tepper et al., 1998Tepper J.M. Sharpe N.A. Koós T.Z. Trent F. Postnatal development of the rat neostriatum: electrophysiological, light- and electron-microscopic studies.Dev. Neurosci. 1998; 20: 125-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The principal neuron of the striatum is the spiny projection neuron (SPN). SPNs participate in two output pathways: (1) the direct pathway containing SPNs that express D1 dopamine (DA) receptors and project to the basal ganglia output nuclei of the substantia nigra reticulata and globus pallidus interna (dSPN) and (2) the indirect pathway including SPNs that express D2 DA receptors and project to the globus pallidus externa (iSPN) (Gerfen and Surmeier, 2011Gerfen C.R. Surmeier D.J. Modulation of striatal projection systems by dopamine.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2011; 34: 441-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). In the adult, the SPN receives glutamatergic input from the cortex and thalamus that, together with DA inputs from the midbrain, provides a neurophysiological basis for motivational control of movement (Gerfen and Surmeier, 2011Gerfen C.R. Surmeier D.J. Modulation of striatal projection systems by dopamine.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2011; 34: 441-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). Adult SPNs are characterized by low firing frequencies and a high threshold for action potential firing (Wilson and Groves, 1981Wilson C.J. Groves P.M. Spontaneous firing patterns of identified spiny neurons in the rat neostriatum.Brain Res. 1981; 220: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, Wilson and Kawaguchi, 1996Wilson C.J. Kawaguchi Y. The origins of two-state spontaneous membrane potential fluctuations of neostriatal spiny neurons.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2397-2410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, only simultaneous activity from convergent synaptic inputs provides sufficient excitation to drive adult SPNs to fire and control action. Immature SPNs, however, are hyperexcitable and, therefore, do not generate mature firing patterns (Tepper et al., 1998Tepper J.M. Sharpe N.A. Koós T.Z. Trent F. Postnatal development of the rat neostriatum: electrophysiological, light- and electron-microscopic studies.Dev. Neurosci. 1998; 20: 125-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Although SPN hyperexcitability and consequent inappropriate action selection has been widely suggested to be present during adulthood in neuropsychiatric diseases, such as schizophrenia (Cazorla et al., 2012Cazorla M.

DA transmission into the striatum also changes during postnatal development. While DA axons arrive in the striatum at embryonic day 14 (E14) and are capable of calcium-dependent DA release by P0 (Ferrari et al., 2012Ferrari D.C. Mdzomba B.J. Dehorter N. Lopez C. Michel F.J.

This postnatal maturation of DA neurotransmission occurs during a period associated with the onset of multiple neuropsychiatric disorders, suggesting that changes in presynaptic DA may induce developmental changes in dopaminoceptive regions, although this has not been fully explored (Galiñanes et al., 2009Galiñanes G.L.

Here, we report that DA transmission is responsible for the induction of the maturation of direct pathway SPN intrinsic excitability and must act during a critical window within the juvenile period to achieve the normal adult SPN state. Adult SPNs maintain a hyperpolarized resting membrane potential and high latency to spike. Both in vivo and ex vivo recordings have demonstrated that SPNs are hyperexcitable after birth and acquire their mature phenotype during the first four postnatal weeks (Gertler et al., 2008Gertler T.S.

Postnatal development of the rat neostriatum: electrophysiological, light- and electron-microscopic studies.Dev. Neurosci. 1998; 20: 125-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Here, we examined the time course of these changes in acute brain slices from BAC-D1tomato (D1T) mice (Shuen et al., 2008Shuen J.A. Chen M. Gloss B. Calakos N.

Neurosci. 2008; 28: 2681-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). We conducted whole-cell recordings from D1T+ (dSPNs) and D1T− (putative iSPNs) SPNs in the dorsal striatum during the second, third, and fourth postnatal weeks and adulthood (∼4 months) to assess whether and how excitability is decreased throughout the juvenile and early adolescent period. We selected ages P12–P14, P18, and P28 for examination based on the following rationales: P12–P14 occur around eye opening (Evans et al., 2015Evans R.C. Herin G.A. Hawes S.L. Blackwell K.T.

Brain Res. 1997; 98: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar); P18 occurs immediately before weaning and at the end of excitatory synaptogenesis in the striatum (Peixoto et al., 2016Peixoto R.T. Wang W. Croney D.M. Kozorovitskiy Y. Sabatini B.L. Early hyperactivity and precocious maturation of corticostriatal circuits in Shank3B(-/-) mice.Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19: 716-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar); and P28 marks the first age with “mature” up and down states during in vivo recordings of SPNs (Tepper et al., 1998Tepper J.M. Sharpe N.A. Koós T.Z. Trent F. Postnatal development of the rat neostriatum: electrophysiological, light- and electron-microscopic studies.Dev. Neurosci. 1998; 20: 125-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We also measured SPN excitability at 4 months to compare the juvenile and adult states. We found that both D1T+ and D1T− SPNs undergo reductions in excitability between P12 and P28. Resting membrane potential (RMP) and input resistance (Rin) decreased over this period in both dSPNs and iSPNs, while rheobase increased (Figures 1A–1D) (RMP: age p < 0.0001, subtype p = 0.94, interaction p = 0.58; Rin: age p < 0.0001, subtype p = 0.03, interaction p = 0.0618; rheobase: age × subtype interaction p = 0.045). These changes were associated with a difference in the number of action potentials fired in response to a range of injected current (current-response) (Figure 1E). By P28, parameters of SPN excitability were stable and not different from those measured at P120. Significant differences in rheobase, input resistance, and current-response curve were also observed between dSPNs and iSPNs, similar to previous reports (Figures 1C and 1D) (Cepeda et al., 2008Cepeda C. André V.M. Yamazaki I. Wu N. Kleiman-Weiner M. Levine M.S. Differential electrophysiological properties of dopamine D1 and D2 receptor-containing striatal medium-sized spiny neurons.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2008; 27: 671-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, Gertler et al., 2008Gertler T.S. Chan C.S. Surmeier D.J. Dichotomous anatomical properties of adult striatal medium spiny neurons.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 10814-10824Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Thus, SPNs undergo a substantial decrease in excitability during the second and third postnatal weeks, with direct pathway neurons exhibiting a more profound decrease during the third and fourth weeks. Why does SPN excitability change during the postnatal period? We hypothesized that a change in modulatory neurotransmission may induce these changes. Previous work has demonstrated differences in DA release dynamics between the immediate postnatal, adolescent, and adult periods (Ferrari et al., 2012Ferrari D.C. Mdzomba B.J. Dehorter N. Lopez C.

Reduced presynaptic dopamine activity in adolescent dorsal striatum.Neuropsychopharmacology. 2013; 38: 1344-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, Stamford, 1989Stamford J.A. Development and ageing of the rat nigrostriatal dopamine system studied with fast cyclic voltammetry.J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 1582-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), although a systematic characterization of evoked synaptic DA release dynamics during juvenile period has not been reported. We measured electrically evoked DA release events in the dorsal striatum by fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) in acute brain slices prepared from mice aged P8 to P110 (Figure 2A) (Sulzer et al., 2016Sulzer D. Cragg S.J. Rice M.E. Striatal dopamine neurotransmission: regulation of release and uptake.Basal Ganglia. 2016; 6: 123-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). We chose P8, an age at which DA neuron firing rates are similar to those in adult levels (Ferrari et al., 2012Ferrari D.C. Mdzomba B.J. Dehorter N. Lopez C. Michel F.J. Libersat F. Hammond C. Midbrain dopaminergic neurons generate calcium and sodium currents and release dopamine in the striatum of pups.Front. Cell. Neurosci. 2012; 6: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), to determine whether increases in DA release preceded changes in the maturation of SPN excitability. Analysis revealed a significant effect of age on the amplitude of peak DA release (Figure 2B). The increased evoked extracellular DA concentration measured by FSCV could be due to either increased presynaptic DA release or decreased DA reuptake (Schmitz et al., 2001Schmitz Y. Lee C.J. Schmauss C. Gonon F. Sulzer D. Amphetamine distorts stimulation-dependent dopamine overflow: effects on D2 autoreceptors, transporters, and synaptic vesicle stores.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5916-5924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Schmitz et al., 2002Schmitz Y. Schmauss C. Sulzer D. Altered dopamine release and uptake kinetics in mice lacking D2 receptors.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8002-8009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To address this, we measured the t1/2 (width at half-height) of DA peaks following electrical stimuli as a functional estimate of DA reuptake. We observed no effect of age on t1/2 when analyzed by one-way ANOVA (Figure 2C), suggesting that, along with increased DA release, DA reuptake increases during postnatal development (Jones et al., 1995Jones S.R. Garris P.A. Wightman R.M. Different effects of cocaine and nomifensine on dopamine uptake in the caudate-putamen and nucleus accumbens.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 274: 396-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, Moll et al., 2000Moll G.H. Mehnert C. Wicker M. Bock N. Rothenberger A. Rüther E. Huether G. Age-associated changes in the densities of presynaptic monoamine transporters in different regions of the rat brain from early juvenile life to late adulthood.Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 2000; 119: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Consistently, nomifensine, a DAT blocker, affected peak height and t1/2 similarly at P14 and P28 (Figure S1). To analyze why DA release increases postnatally, we examined short-term presynaptic plasticity by measuring the amplitude of DA release evoked by paired electrical pulses. We observed a significant effect of age on paired-pulse ratio (2nd/1st peak) (Figure 2D), suggesting either a larger releasable pool or faster refilling rate of release-competent synaptic vesicles. To examine a basis for an increased releasable pool of DA, we probed striatal tissue lysates for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in DA synthesis, using DARPP-32, a protein involved in the SPN response to DA signaling, and actin as loading controls. While no effect of age was observed on DARPP-32 or actin levels, TH levels increased significantly over the same time course as that of electrically evoked DA release measured by FSCV (Figures 2E and 2F). Overall, our data indicate that DA synthesis and the number and/or quantal size of DA released during synaptic vesicle fusion increases over the P8–P30 period, with the most dramatic increases occurring at ages less than P20. While DA axons arrive in the striatum during the embryonic period (Voorn et al., 1988Voorn P. Kalsbeek A. Jorritsma-Byham B. Groenewegen H.J. The pre- and postnatal development of the dopaminergic cell groups in the ventral mesencephalon and the dopaminergic innervation of the striatum of the rat.Neuroscience. 1988; 25: 857-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), our results indicate that DA release dynamics continue to mature throughout the first four weeks postnatally (Figure 2). These ontogenetic increases in DA release immediately precede major postnatal reductions in SPN excitability, suggesting that DA could induce these changes (Figures 1 and 2). To address this hypothesis, we utilized the Pitx3KO mouse, which harbors a loss-of-function mutation upstream of the Pitx3 gene, leading to developmental loss of DA neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta by P0–P1 (Nunes et al., 2003Nunes I. Tovmasian L.T. Silva R.M. Burke R.E. Goff S.P. Pitx3 is required for development of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 4245-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Thus, dorsal striatal SPNs in the Pitx3KO mouse develop in the absence of postnatal dopaminergic signaling (Figures 3A and 3B ). We first confirmed that nigrostriatal projections are not present in Pitx3 mice. Consistent with the literature, we found that P28 Pitx3KO mice did not express TH-labeled DA axons in the dorsal striatum (Figure 3A) and that electric stimulation of the dorsal striatum did not elicit DA release (Figure 3B). We then conducted whole-cell recordings from SPNs in acute brain slices from P14, P18, and P28 Pitx3WT and Pitx3KO mice. We chose P14 as the earliest age to examine in this experiment as this is the beginning of a period of excitatory synaptogenesis (Tepper et al., 1998Tepper J.M. Sharpe N.A. Koós T.Z. Trent F. Postnatal development of the rat neostriatum: electrophysiological, light- and electron-microscopic studies.Dev. Neurosci. 1998; 20: 125-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and the end of a robust period of dopaminergic axon retraction (Oo and Burke, 1997Oo T.F. Burke R.E. The time course of developmental cell death in phenotypically defined dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra.Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1997; 98: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). SPNs became significantly less excitable from P14 to P18, as demonstrated by a reduced RMP, an increased rheobase, and reduced input resistance in both genotypes (Figures 3C–3F) (RMP: age × genotype interaction p = 0.04; Rin: age × subtype interaction p = 0.001; rheobase: age × subtype interaction p = 0.0002). Pitx3WT SPNs then underwent further reductions in excitability from P18 to P28, as demonstrated by reduced RMP and input resistance and increased rheobase (Figures 3B–3D). In striking contrast, however, P28 Pitx3KO mice showed no further decrease in excitability after P18 and displayed significantly elevated RMP and input resistance and decreased rheobase compared to P28 WT SPNs (Figures 3B–3D). Adult SPNs also demonstrated a long delay to first spike in response to square current pulses and, at subthreshold current levels, displayed a voltage ramp response (see Figure S3 for example). We measured the magnitude of the voltage ramp in response to current injections 10–20 pA below the rheobase in SPNs from Pitx3WT and Pitx3KO mice at age P28 and found no difference (Figure 3G, p = 0.9795). Similarly, no effect of genotype was observed on the latency to fire the first action potential in response to a square current injection at the rheobase (Figure 3H, p = 0.9941). Finally, more action potentials were triggered in response to injected current in Pitx3KO than Pitx3WT at P28, but not at P18 (Figures 3I and 3J) (P18: current p < 0.0001, genotype p = 0.5323, current × genotype p = 0.9997; P28: current × genotype p = 0.0067). We then recorded from SPNs of 4-month-old Pitx3WT and Pitx3KO mice to address whether the hyperexcitable SPN phenotype of the Pitx3KO mouse persisted into adulthood. A significant effect of genotype was observed for rheobase, RMP, and input resistance (Figures 3C–3F). These data indicate that SPN excitability matures in DA-independent (P14–P18) and DA-dependent (>P18) stages, and the absence of striatal DA causes hyperexcitability of SPNs in adulthood. To address whether these changes in intrinsic excitability were homeostatic in response to reduced glutamatergic synaptic inputs, we measured spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic current (sEPSC) frequency and amplitude at P28 and observed no difference between genotypes (Figures 3K–3M). These findings suggest that in the absence of developmental DA signaling, excitatory inputs onto SPNs function normally, but SPN intrinsic excitability is increased. To identify"
https://openalex.org/W2883812812,"Although animals have evolved multiple mechanisms to suppress transposons, “leaky” mobilizations that cause mutations and diseases still occur. This suggests that transposons employ specific tactics to accomplish robust propagation. By directly tracking mobilization, we show that, during a short and specific time window of oogenesis, retrotransposons achieve massive amplification via a cell-type-specific targeting strategy. Retrotransposons rarely mobilize in undifferentiated germline stem cells. However, as oogenesis proceeds, they utilize supporting nurse cells—which are highly polyploid and eventually undergo apoptosis—as factories to massively manufacture invading products. Moreover, retrotransposons rarely integrate into nurse cells themselves but, instead, via microtubule-mediated transport, they preferentially target the DNA of the interconnected oocytes. Blocking microtubule-dependent intercellular transport from nurse cells significantly alleviates damage to the oocyte genome. Our data reveal that parasitic genomic elements can efficiently hijack a host developmental process to propagate robustly, thereby driving evolutionary change and causing disease."

HIV infection is associated with dysregulation of cytokines and chemokines, which subsequently contribute to the pathogenesis of HIV. Alcohol and tobacco exposure, which are prevalent in HIV-infected individuals, may induce changes in the expression of cytokines and chemokines. Therefore, our aim in this study was to quantify plasma exosomal cytokines and chemokines that we expect to exacerbate toxicity or disease progression in HIV-positive drug abusers. We measured the levels of cytokines and chemokines in the plasma and plasma exosomes of 39 patients comprising six groups: HIV-negative and HIV-positive non drug abusers, HIV-negative and HIV-positive alcohol users, and HIV-negative and HIV positive tobacco smokers. We measured six cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-8, IL-6, IL-1ra, IL-10) and two chemokines (MCP-1 and RANTES). All were present in exosomes of healthy subjects, but their levels varied between different study groups. HIV-positive alcohol drinkers had higher levels of plasma IL-8 compared to those of HIV-positive non-drinkers. The IL-1ra level was significantly higher in exosomes of non-HIV-infected alcohol drinkers compared to those of HIV-positive alcohol drinkers. Interestingly, the IL-10 level was higher in exosomes compared with their respective plasma levels in all study groups except HIV-positive non-alcohol drinkers. IL-10 was completely packaged in exosomes of HIV-positive smokers. HIV-positive smokers had significantly higher levels of plasma IL-8 compared with HIV-positive non-smokers and significantly higher exosomal IL-6 levels compared with HIV-negative subjects. HIV-positive smokers had significantly increased plasma levels of IL-1ra compared to HIV-positive non-smokers. The MCP-1 levels in the plasma of HIV-positive smokers was significantly higher than in either HIV-positive non-drug abusers or HIV-negative smokers. Overall, the findings suggest that plasma cytokines and chemokines are packaged in exosomes at varying degrees in different study groups. Exosomal cytokines and chemokines are likely to have a significant biological role at distant sites including cells in the brain."

Here we describe functional and single-channel properties of triheteromeric GluN1/GluN2A/GluN2C receptors, which contain two GluN1, one GluN2A, and one GluN2C subunits. This NMDAR has three conductance levels and opens in bursts similar to GluN1/GluN2A receptors but with a single-channel open time and open probability reminiscent of GluN1/GluN2C receptors. The deactivation time course of GluN1/GluN2A/GluN2C receptors is intermediate to GluN1/GluN2A and GluN1/GluN2C receptors and is not dominated by GluN2A or GluN2C. We show that triheteromeric GluN1/GluN2A/GluN2C receptors are the predominant NMDARs in cerebellar granule cells and propose that co-expression of GluN2A and GluN2C in cerebellar granule cells occludes cell surface expression of diheteromeric GluN1/GluN2C receptors. This new insight into neuronal GluN1/GluN2A/GluN2C receptors highlights the complexity of NMDAR signaling in the CNS."
https://openalex.org/W2883308970,"Summary Rtt109 is a unique histone acetyltransferase acetylating histone H3 lysine 56 (H3K56), a modification critical for DNA replication-coupled nucleosome assembly and genome stability. In cells, histone chaperone Asf1 is essential for H3K56 acetylation, yet the mechanisms for H3K56 specificity and Asf1 requirement remain unknown. We have determined the crystal structure of the Rtt109-Asf1-H3-H4 complex and found that unwinding of histone H3 αN, where K56 is normally located, and stabilization of the very C-terminal β strand of histone H4 by Asf1 are prerequisites for H3K56 acetylation. Unexpectedly, an interaction between Rtt109 and the central helix of histone H3 is also required. The observed multiprotein, multisite substrate recognition mechanism among histone modification enzymes provides mechanistic understandings of Rtt109 and Asf1 in H3K56 acetylation, as well as valuable insights into substrate recognition by histone modification enzymes in general."

Here, we biophysically and structurally characterize the unusual cis-homodimeric architecture of PCDH15. We show that PCDH15 molecules form double-helical assemblies through cis-dimerization interfaces in the extracellular cadherin EC2-EC3 domain region and in a unique membrane-proximal domain. Electron microscopy studies visualize the cis-dimeric PCDH15 assembly and reveal the PCDH15 extracellular domain as a parallel double helix with cis cross-bridges at the two locations we defined. The helical configuration suggests the potential for elasticity through helix winding and unwinding. Functional studies in hair cells show that mutations that perturb PCDH15 dimerization contacts affect mechanotransduction. Together, these data reveal the cis-dimeric architecture of PCDH15 and show that dimerization is critical for sensing mechanical stimuli."

In this study, we reported the identification of Calcium Binding Protein 39-Like (CAB39L) as a novel regulator of tumor metabolism in GC. CAB39L mRNA was frequently silenced by promoter methylation in GC cell lines and tissues. Functional studies suggested that CAB39L functions as a tumor suppressor, as overexpression of CAB39L elicited suppression of multiple cancer phenotypes both in GC cells and an orthotopic mouse model; whilst its knockdown promoted tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, CAB39L interacted with LKB1-STRAD complex and induced LKB1, leading to the phosphorylation and activation of AMPKα/β. LKB1-AMPK activation in GC cell lines was tumor suppressive, as metformin (an AMPK activator) inhibited GC cell growth in the CAB39L-silenced cells. Moreover, knockdown of LKB1 reversed growth inhibitory effect of CAB39L, indicating that tumor suppression by CAB39L depended on LKB1-AMPK. RNAseq and gene set enrichment analysis revealed that CAB39L was closely correlated with oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial biogenesis. Consistently, CAB39L-induced p-AMPK elicited PGC1α phosphorylation and increased the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial respiration complexes. Accordingly, CAB39L reversed the Warburg effect in GC, as evidenced by enhanced oxygen consumption rate and reduced extracellular acidification rate; inversely, CAB39L knockdown promoted a metabolic shift towards the Warburg phenotype. In GC patients, CAB39L promoter hypermethylation was correlated with poor prognosis. Our data demonstrate that CAB39L is a novel tumor suppressor which suppresses tumorigenesis by promoting LKB1-AMPK-PGC1α axis, thereby preventing a metabolic shift that drives carcinogenesis. CAB39L methylation is a potential prognostic biomarker for GC patients."

The 3.7 Å cryo-EM structure of a closed trimer of the clathrin adaptor AP-1, the small GTPase Arf1, HIV-1 Nef, and the cytosolic tail of the restriction factor tetherin suggested a mechanism for inactivating tetherin by Golgi retention. The 4.3 Å structure of a mutant Nef-induced dimer of AP-1 showed how the closed trimer is regulated by the dileucine loop of Nef. HDX-MS and mutational analysis were used to show how cargo dynamics leads to alternative Arf1 trimerization, directing Nef targets to be either retained at the trans-Golgi or sorted to lysosomes. Phosphorylation of the NL4-3 M-Nef was shown to regulate AP-1 trimerization, explaining how O-Nefs lacking this phosphosite counteract tetherin but most M-Nefs do not. These observations show how the higher-order organization of a vesicular coat can be allosterically modulated to direct cargoes to distinct fates."
https://openalex.org/W2883124811,"While linear mechanisms lay the foundations of feature selectivity in many brain areas, direction selectivity in the elementary motion detector (EMD) of the fly has become a paradigm of nonlinear neuronal computation. We have bridged this divide by demonstrating that linear spatial summation can generate direction selectivity in the fruit fly Drosophila. Using linear systems analysis and two-photon imaging of a genetically encoded voltage indicator, we measure the emergence of direction-selective (DS) voltage signals in the Drosophila OFF pathway. Our study is a direct, quantitative investigation of the algorithm underlying directional signals, with the striking finding that linear spatial summation is sufficient for the emergence of direction selectivity. A linear stage of the fly EMD strongly resembles similar computations in vertebrate visual cortex, demands a reappraisal of the role of upstream nonlinearities, and implicates the voltage-to-calcium transformation in the refinement of feature selectivity in this system.Video AbstracteyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI0ZDA1MGRmNzkwZjE5ZjE2Y2UxYzE2ZTlmYjI1MmIzYyIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc5MTgwMTMzfQ.dvc485IZzrMpEU5rjwswfHyCbJor0UO9515aIHtOVcM7EbRLO5J7zzjp8v-HTVgFRxS-xcjdpSFcyEULnRxer8GKX-yaosXf3fUjahRtFBenXPvSYtRItgJ1FuNdr2g2Rq9EEWlowz1T5JkEPSbVMqXKk8J-875dXfVibzs8_01Z9s46eHHXmWyAStCPz1SIX_kCzXXvKFg50g08h6LDHUgr5ofHwBfcRoYd_OLql8q7OlFQ_kzrUJXFRO_qi6URnLMYUgMmTsk5YjnGNv-QC8jjuQW4_YL2rIH99lUzNbDAmJHqkSbvnf2EP_HwHLCcJNaV36c-GNyeO-roCMYrqA(mp4, (22.9 MB) Download video"
https://openalex.org/W2883200496,"We used event-related potentials to investigate morphosyntactic development in 78 adult English-speaking learners of Spanish as a second language (L2) across the proficiency spectrum. We examined how development is modulated by the similarity between the native language (L1) and the L2, by comparing number (a feature present in English) and gender agreement (novel feature). We also investigated how development is impacted by structural distance, manipulating the distance between the agreeing elements by probing both within-phrase (fruta muy jugosa ""fruit-FEM-SG very juicy-FEM-SG"") and across-phrase agreement (fresa es ácida ""strawberry-FEM-SG is tart-FEM-SG""). Regression analyses revealed that the learners' overall proficiency, as measured by a standardized test, predicted their accuracy with the target properties in the grammaticality judgment task (GJT), but did not predict P600 magnitude to the violations. However, a relationship emerged between immersion in Spanish-speaking countries and P600 magnitude for gender. Our results also revealed a correlation between accuracy in the GJT and P600 magnitude, suggesting that behavioral sensitivity to the target property predicts neurophysiological sensitivity. Subsequent group analyses revealed that the highest-proficiency learners showed equally robust P600 effects for number and gender. This group also elicited more positive waveforms for within- than across-phrase agreement overall, similar to the native controls. The lowest-proficiency learners showed a P600 for number overall, but no effects for gender. Unlike the highest-proficiency learners, they also showed no sensitivity to structural distance, suggesting that sensitivity to such linguistic factors develops over time. Overall, these results suggest an important role for proficiency in morphosyntactic development, although differences emerged between behavioral and electrophysiological measures. While L2 proficiency predicted behavioral sensitivity to agreement, development with respect to the neurocognitive mechanisms recruited in processing only emerged when comparing the two extremes of the proficiency spectrum. Importantly, while both L1-L2 similarity and hierarchical structure impact development, they do not constrain it."
https://openalex.org/W2883222462,"Background Undocumented migrants endure adverse living conditions while facing barriers to access healthcare. Evidence is lacking regarding their healthcare needs, notably in regards to chronic diseases. Our goal was to investigate health conditions in undocumented migrants attended in primary care setting. Methods This study was conducted at the primary care outpatient clinic, Geneva University Hospitals, Switzerland. We retrospectively recorded and coded all medical conditions of a random sample of 731 undocumented migrants using the International Classification of Primary Care, 2nd version (ICPC-2). We dichotomized conditions as chronic or non-chronic and considered multimorbidity in the presence of three or more chronic conditions. Results Participants originated from 72 countries and were mainly female (65.5%) with a mean age of 42.4 (standard deviation [SD]: 11.4) years. They presented a mean of 2.9 (SD: 2.1; range: 1–17) health conditions. In multivariable analysis, the number of conditions was associated with female gender (p = 0.011) and older age (p <0.001), but not with origin (p = 0.373). The body systems most frequently affected were endocrine, metabolic and nutritional (n = 386; 18.4%), musculoskeletal (n = 308, 14.7%) and digestive (n = 266, 12.8%). Hypertension (17.9%; 95% CI: 15.2%, 29.9%), obesity or overweight (16%; 95% CI: 13.4%, 18.9%) and gastric problems (14.1%; 95% CI: 11.6%, 16.8%) were most prevalent. Overall, 71.8% (95% CI: 68.5%, 75%) participants had at least one chronic condition while 20% (95% CI: 17.2%, 23.1%) had three or more. In multivariable analysis, age (p <0.001) was the only predictor of presenting at least one or three or more chronic conditions. Conclusions Undocumented migrants present multiple health problems in primary care settings and bear an important burden of chronic diseases. The extent of multimorbidity highlights the need to provide and facilitate the access to comprehensive and long-term primary healthcare services."

These lipopeptides were synthesized on solid-phase and screened for their antimicrobial activity, toxicity and proteolytic stability. They incorporated a butanoyl, a hexanoyl or a lauroyl group at the N-terminus or at the side chain of a lysine residue placed at each position of the sequence. Their antimicrobial activity and hemolysis depended on the fatty acid length and its position. In particular, lipopeptides containing a butanoyl or a hexanoyl chain exhibited the best biological activity profile. In addition, we observed that the incorporation of the acyl group did not induce the overexpression of defense-related genes in tomato. Best lipopeptides were BP370, BP378, BP381, BP387 and BP389, which were highly active against all the pathogens tested (minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.8 to 12.5 μM), low hemolytic, low phytotoxic and significantly stable to protease degradation. This family of lipopeptides might be promising functional peptides useful for plant protection."
https://openalex.org/W2884604777,"Transcriptional downregulation caused by intronic triplet repeat expansions underlies diseases such as Friedreich's ataxia. This downregulation of gene expression is coupled with epigenetic changes, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here, we show that an intronic GAA/TTC triplet expansion within the IIL1 gene of Arabidopsis thaliana results in accumulation of 24-nt short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and repressive histone marks at the IIL1 locus, which in turn causes its transcriptional downregulation and an associated phenotype. Knocking down DICER LIKE-3 (DCL3), which produces 24-nt siRNAs, suppressed transcriptional downregulation of IIL1 and the triplet expansion-associated phenotype. Furthermore, knocking down additional components of the RNA-dependent DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway also suppressed both transcriptional downregulation of IIL1 and the repeat expansion-associated phenotype. Thus, our results show that triplet repeat expansions can lead to local siRNA biogenesis, which in turn downregulates transcription through an RdDM-dependent epigenetic modification."

The mutation causes a substitution of a glutamine residue that is highly conserved in the extracellular S1–S2 loop of domain II in all Cav channels with a histidine and was identified by whole-exome sequencing of an individual with moderate hearing impairment, developmental delay, and epilepsy. When introduced into the rat Cav1.3 cDNA, Q558H significantly decreased the density of Ca2+ currents in transfected HEK293T cells. Gating current analyses and cell-surface biotinylation experiments suggested that the smaller current amplitudes caused by Q558H were because of decreased numbers of functional Cav1.3 channels at the cell surface. The substitution also produced more sustained Ca2+ currents by weakening voltage-dependent inactivation. When inserted into the corresponding locus of Cav2.1, the substitution had similar effects as in Cav1.3. However, the substitution introduced in Cav3.1 reduced current density, but had no effects on voltage-dependent inactivation.

Knowledge about feeding habits is essential for understanding the role of these predators in the environment, the impact on prey populations, and potential competition among themselves and with other carnivores. This study aimed to describe and compare the diet of four sympatric small cats in the grasslands of southern Brazil. We analysed the stomach contents of 37 Geoffroy’s cats (Leopardus geoffroyi), 27 margays (Leopardus wiedii), 14 pampas cats (Leopardus colocola), and 20 jaguarundis (Herpailurus yagouaroundi) obtained as road kill in the Brazilian Pampa in southern Brazil. Small mammals were the most representative class consumed by all cats, followed by Aves, Reptilia, and Amphibia. Some items, such as rodents Cavia aperea, Akodon sp., Oligoryzomys sp. and Passeriformes were consumed by all cat species. Niche overlap varied widely, from 10% (margay x jaguarundi) to 92% (jaguarundi x pampas cat). Niche breadth indicated that jaguarundi were the most specialized of the cats (Bsta = 0.24) in this region, with a diet closely associated to C. aperea. Margay consumed more items associated with arboreal behaviour than other cat species, but consumed more terrestrial items than arboreal ones. The pampas cat consumed mostly terrestrial species associated with open fields. Geoffroy’s cat consumed mammals found in a diversity of habitats, indicating high ecological flexibility. Species with more similarity in diet such as jaguarundi and pampas cat probably present temporal segregation in activity. In conclusion, despite their habitat and diet similarities, these four species explore distinct microhabitats by foraging different prey groups, what favor them to live in sympatry."

From an analytic sample of 44,000 households, we identified those having at least one member with diabetes or hypertension and determined their health expenditure. Using matching procedures, we compared these data with those of households lacking such individuals.We found that 24% of the households had at least one member who had been diagnosed with diabetes, hypertension, or both. Households with such members reported health expenditures that were 25%-34% (P <0.01) higher than households without such individuals. Such differences were more pronounced among households at lower socioeconomic levels and among those with no or limited health insurance.In addition to their impact on individual health, chronic ailments exert financial pressure on households. The additional health-care expenditure for households owing to such diseases leaves them financially exposed-especially households with lower income levels."
https://openalex.org/W2883513997,"Previously, we highlighted induction of an integrated stress response (ISR) gene program in skeletal muscle of pigs treated with a beta-adrenergic agonist. Hence we tested the hypothesis that the ER-stress inhibitor, sodium 4-phenylbutyrate (PBA), would inhibit Clenbuterol-mediated muscle growth and reduce expression of genes that are known indicators of an ISR in mice. Clenbuterol (1mg/kg/day) administered to C57BL6/J mice for 21 days increased body weight (p<0.001), muscle weights (p<0.01), and muscle fibre diameters (p<0.05). Co-administration of PBA (100mg/kg/day) did not alter the Clenbuterol-mediated phenotype, nor did PBA alone have any effects compared to that of the vehicle treated mice. Clenbuterol increased skeletal muscle mRNA expression of phosphoserine amino transferase 1 (PSAT1, p<0.001) and cyclophillin A (p<0.01) at day 3, but not day 7. Clenbuterol decreased mRNA expression of activating transcription factor (ATF) 4 and ATF5 at day 3 (p<0.05) and day 7 (p<0.01), X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) variant 2 mRNA at day 3 only (p<0.01) and DNA damage inducible transcript 3 (DDIT3/CHOP) mRNA at day 7 only (p<0.05). Co-administration of PBA had no effect on Clenbuterol-induced changes in skeletal muscle gene expression. In contrast, treatment of C2C12 myotubes with 5mM PBA (8hr) attenuated the thapsigargin-induced ISR gene program. Prolonged (24-48hr) treatment with PBA caused atrophy (p<0.01), reduced neoprotein synthesis (p<0.0001) and decreased expression of myogenin and fast myosin heavy chain genes (p<0.01), indicating an inhibition of myogenic differentiation. In summary, Clenbuterol did not induce an ISR gene program in mouse muscle. On the contrary, it reduced expression of a number of ISR genes, but it increased expression of PSAT1 mRNA. Co-administration of PBA had no effect on Clenbuterol-mediated muscle growth or gene expression in mice, whereas PBA did inhibit thapsigargin-induced ISR gene expression in cultured C2C12 cells and appeared to inhibit myogenic differentiation, independent of altering ISR gene expression."

In this longitudinal, two-wave study of a normative sample of 515 Greek adolescents at 16 and 18 years, ARA was assessed with the relevant subscale of the Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised and EIU with the Internet Addiction Test. A three-level hierarchical linear model found ARA tendencies to decrease between 16 and 18 while engagement in a romantic relationship and EIU were associated with lower and higher ARA tendencies respectively. Gender did not differentiate ARA severity either at the age of 16 or its changes over time. Results highlight the need of adopting a longitudinal-contextualized approach and provide implications for prevention and intervention initiatives in relation to the romantic development of adolescents."

Being a new enzyme mechanism, several important questions regarding the mechanism remain unknown and are addressed in this two-part work using the SgrAI system.

SgrAI derives from the bacterium Streptomyces griseus and is part of bacterial immunity against bacterial viruses (i.e. bacteriophage). Bacteria and their corresponding phage are among the oldest and most numerous organisms on Earth, evolving and coevolving strategies of attack and defense in what is known as the “phage-host arms race” (9Stern A. Sorek R. The phage-host arms race: shaping the evolution of microbes.Bioessays. 2011; 33 (10.1002/bies.201000071 20979102): 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In this arms race, properties such as speed likely matter, such that SgrAI is able to cleave the invading phage DNA prior to viral transcription or replication. At the same time, damaging dsDNA cleavage of the host genome must be minimized and therefore the potentially destructive activity of SgrAI must be sequestered to the phage DNA. restriction endonuclease 18-bp DNA containing the primary SgrAI recognition sequence SgrAI bound to uncleaved 18M-1 SgrAI bound to self-annealed PC DNA SgrAI bound to 18M-1 cleaved in the SgrAI pattern 6-carboxyfluorescein Kintek Global Kinetic Explorer software precleaved primary site DNA with 16 flanking bp DNA run-on oligomer(s) formed from SgrAI bound to DNA rhodamine-X or 5(6)-carboxy-X-rhodamine. The unusual mechanism evolved by SgrAI involving ROO filament formation may be a result of the particular biological niche found in S. griseus. SgrAI cleaves two types of recognition sites, primary (CRCCGGYG, 3 unique sequences) and secondary (CRCCGGY(A or C or T) and CRCCGGGG, 14 unique sequences), but will cleave the secondary sites only when on the same DNA as a primary site, or alternatively in cis when concentrations of SgrAI bound to primary site DNA are high (10Bitinaite J.

Primary sites are protected from DNA cleavage by the cognate SgrAI methyltransferase in the host organism. However, invading phage DNA will not be methylated at the primary site sequences, and hence SgrAI enzymes will bind to those sites, assemble into ROO filaments, and rapidly cleave the DNA. The ROO filament will also incorporate SgrAI bound to secondary sites within the phage DNA, activating SgrAI and resulting in rapid cleavage of those sequences as well. This expansion of specificity to include secondary site sequences may have evolved to increase the number of cleavage sites in invading phage DNA, because the primary recognition site is relatively long (8 bp versus 4–6 bp of many REs). The longer recognition site may have evolved to protect the host genome, which is also relatively large. More host DNA means more recognition sites, which must be protected by the cognate methyltransferase or be cleaved by SgrAI. This may also explain the unusually slow cleavage rate of SgrAI in the absence of ROO filament formation (rate constant of 0.1 min−1, compared with 20 min−1 of the RE EcoRI (12Lesser D.R.

The energetic basis of specificity in the Eco RI endonuclease–DNA interaction.Science. 1990; 250 (10.1126/science.2237428 2237428): 776-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar)). However, the slow DNA-cleavage rate and rare recognition sequence make for very poor anti-phage activity. However, the allosteric activation by binding and ROO filament assembly with multiple unmethylated primary sites increases the DNA-cleavage rate by 200–1000-fold (8Park C.K. Stiteler A.P. Shah S. Ghare M.I. Bitinaite J. Horton N.C. Activation of DNA cleavage by oligomerization of DNA-bound SgrAI.Biochemistry. 2010; 49 (10.1021/bi100557v 20836535): 8818-8830Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 13Shah S. Sanchez J.

In addition, the expansion of DNA sequence specificity from 3 primary sites to also include the 14 secondary site sequences results in very rapid cleavage of many sites on the phage DNA, making for an effective anti-phage enzyme. Structural studies of SgrAI in its low activity form show a canonical dimeric RE fold enzyme bound to one recognition site (primary or secondary) in duplex DNA (14Dunten P.W. Little E.J. Gregory M.T.

These SgrAI–DNA complexes are then the building blocks for the high activity state of SgrAI, which forms a left-handed helix with approximately four SgrAI–DNA complexes per turn, which we call a run-on oligomer or ROO filament (Fig. 1A) (16Lyumkis D. Talley H. Stewart A. Shah S. Park C.K. Tama F. Potter C.S. Carragher B. Horton N.C. Allosteric regulation of DNA cleavage and sequence-specificity through run-on oligomerization.Structure. 2013; 21 (10.1016/j.str.2013.08.012 24055317): 1848-1858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The SgrAI–DNA complexes associate using protein–protein and protein–DNA interactions between neighboring SgrAI–DNA complexes (Fig. 1A), and the DNA (when contiguous sites are bound by SgrAI) is predicted to weave in and out of the filament (17Dryden D.T. The architecture of restriction enzymes.Structure. 2013; 21 (10.1016/j.str.2013.09.009 24119670): 1720-1721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The ROO filament can also theoretically extend indefinitely from either end, and ROO filaments of 30 or more SgrAI–DNA complexes have been visualized via EM (16Lyumkis D. Talley H. Stewart A. Shah S. Park C.K. Tama F. Potter C.S. Carragher B. Horton N.C. Allosteric regulation of DNA cleavage and sequence-specificity through run-on oligomerization.Structure. 2013; 21 (10.1016/j.str.2013.08.012 24055317): 1848-1858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The conformation of SgrAI is altered in the ROO filamentous activated state compared with the unoligomerized low activity state, as expected for an allosteric enzyme (16Lyumkis D. Talley H. Stewart A. Shah S. Park C.K. Tama F. Potter C.S. Carragher B. Horton N.C. Allosteric regulation of DNA cleavage and sequence-specificity through run-on oligomerization.Structure. 2013; 21 (10.1016/j.str.2013.08.012 24055317): 1848-1858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Because SgrAI bound to primary site DNA forms the ROO filament, which also binds and activates SgrAI bound to secondary site DNA, the primary site DNA is an allosteric effector of both the activity and substrate specificity of SgrAI. To explain this allosteric behavior, a model has been proposed wherein SgrAI exists in equilibrium between an active and an inactive conformation (16Lyumkis D. Talley H. Stewart A. Shah S. Park C.K. Tama F. Potter C.S. Carragher B. Horton N.C. Allosteric regulation of DNA cleavage and sequence-specificity through run-on oligomerization.Structure. 2013; 21 (10.1016/j.str.2013.08.012 24055317): 1848-1858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The active conformation readily forms the ROO filament, and in turn, the ROO filament stabilizes the active conformation. The active conformation forms more readily (is more energetically stable) when SgrAI is bound to primary site than when bound to secondary site sequences, explaining why SgrAI bound to primary site DNA readily assembles into the ROO filaments, but SgrAI bound to secondary-site DNA alone will not. The activated conformation has rapid DNA cleavage activity; thus DNA is rapidly cleaved by SgrAI in the ROO filament. ROO filaments assemble from SgrAI–DNA complexes, regardless of the state of cleavage of the DNA; hence the product of primary site DNA cleavage by SgrAI also stimulates SgrAI activity by inducing ROO filament formation. The formation of ROO filaments intuitively suggests cooperativity and rapid activation; however, until this study, the details of these effects were not known or quantified. In addition, the ROO filament structure suggests potential trapping of cleaved DNA, yet the rapid turnover in steady state reactions indicates that trapping does not occur (11Hingorani-Varma K. Bitinaite J. Kinetic analysis of the coordinated interaction of SgrAI restriction endonuclease with different DNA targets.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278 (10.1074/jbc.M304603200 12851384): 40392-40399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In this two-part work, we measure individual steps in the run-on oligomer mechanism to address specific questions of cooperativity, trapping, filament growth mechanisms, and sequestration of activity using fluorophore-labeled DNA, kinetic FRET measurements, and reaction modeling with global data fitting. The first part of this work (18Park C.K. Sanchez J.L. Barahona C. Basantes L.E. Sanchez J. Hernandez C. Horton N.C. The run-on oligomer filament enzyme mechanism of SgrAI: Part 1. Assembly kinetics of the run-on oligomer filament.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293 (10.1074/jbc.RA118.003680 30068553): 14585-14598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) developed reaction models for ROO filament formation and determined initial estimates of rate constants for assembly and disassembly of SgrAI–DNA complexes from the ROO filament. In this second of the two parts, we develop models further and globally fit all steps of the reaction pathway including DNA cleavage and product release. The reaction data were collected using four different experimental approaches. Each approach measures a different set of steps in the reaction pathway, and concentrations of activating and reporter DNA were varied in each timed reaction to provide additional information. The resulting data from a total of 22 different timed reactions were then fit globally to different reaction models of increasing complexity and ROO filament growth mechanisms, resulting in estimates of microscopic rate constants for each major step of the reaction pathway. The resulting globally fit rate constants show several consistent trends across all models and mechanisms. First, the association of SgrAI–DNA complexes into the ROO filament is relatively slow and is 3–4 orders of magnitude slower than diffusion limited. We show that this characteristic is likely what provides the sequestering effect necessary to prevent cleavage of secondary sites in the host DNA upon activation of SgrAI via invading phage. Second, the corresponding dissociation of SgrAI–DNA complexes from the ROO filament is the next slowest step, and this rate constant is the same to the best of our estimation regardless of whether the bound DNA is cleaved or not. However, though it is the second slowest step of the overall reaction, this step is still fast enough to result in the rapid equilibration of individual SgrAI–DNA complexes into and out of the ROO filament. Therefore, trapping of SgrAI enzyme and/or product (cleaved) DNA within the ROO filament does not occur. Third, the DNA-cleavage rate is 4 orders of magnitude faster in the ROO filament than in isolated SgrAI–DNA complexes and is now comparable to those of other REs. Significantly, it is at least three times faster than the dissociation of SgrAI–DNA complexes from the ROO filament; hence cleavage of the DNA is likely upon every association of a SgrAI–DNA complex into the ROO filament, making the reaction mechanism efficient. The last step, product release (dissociation of the cleaved DNA from SgrAI) is fast and does not limit the overall DNA-cleavage reaction. Finally, we use the different reaction models and extracted rate constants to address issues of cooperativity and growth mechanisms of the ROO filament. Activated DNA cleavage by SgrAI involves several steps: 1) DNA binding by SgrAI, 2) assembly of SgrAI–DNA complexes into the filamentous assembly we call ROO filaments, 3) rapid DNA cleavage by SgrAI while in the ROO filament, 4) separation of the individual SgrAI–DNA complexes from the ROO filament, and then 5) dissociation of the cleaved DNA from SgrAI. In addition, SgrAI will cleave primary site DNA sequences when unoligomerized (i.e. not in the ROO filament), albeit at a slow rate (8Park C.K. Stiteler A.P. Shah S. Ghare M.I. Bitinaite J. Horton N.C. Activation of DNA cleavage by oligomerization of DNA-bound SgrAI.Biochemistry. 2010; 49 (10.1021/bi100557v 20836535): 8818-8830Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Also, the primary site DNA used to induce ROO filament formation and activate SgrAI (i.e. PC DNA in this work) is a mimic of the cleaved product DNA, which must self-anneal before binding to SgrAI, and this annealing can limit the reaction rates at lower concentrations of PC DNA. Because the goal of this work is to estimate each individual, microscopic rate constant (forward and reverse) for each step, the reaction data were measured using three different approaches. In addition, the number of rate constants to be fit was reduced by estimating equilibrium dissociation constants (KD), and fixing reverse rate constants to the fitted forward rate constant. This was done for the self-annealing of PC DNA (KD estimated in Ref. 18Park C.K. Sanchez J.L. Barahona C. Basantes L.E. Sanchez J. Hernandez C. Horton N.C. The run-on oligomer filament enzyme mechanism of SgrAI: Part 1. Assembly kinetics of the run-on oligomer filament.J. Biol.

The KD of SgrAI for the DNA used in these studies was determined as described in the supporting information. The association of SgrAI–DNA complexes into (and out of) the ROO filament was measured by placing FRET donor and acceptor fluorophores on different DNA molecules, resulting in a FRET signal when SgrAI bound to donor DNA assembles with SgrAI bound to acceptor DNA into the ROO filament (Fig. 2A). A titration was first performed to show that the FRET technique measures ROO filament assembly (described below). Timed reactions were then measured to provide the data to use in global fitting to reaction models and from which to determine rate constants for each step of the reaction (Data Sets 4 and 6 and Table S1). First, to isolate only ROO filament formation (and breakdown), DNA cleavage was blocked by excluding the required Mg2+ cofactor from the reaction buffer (reactions of Data Set 4). This approach is similar to that used in the accompanying article (18Park C.K. Sanchez J.L. Barahona C. Basantes L.E. Sanchez J. Hernandez C. Horton N.C. The run-on oligomer filament enzyme mechanism of SgrAI: Part 1. Assembly kinetics of the run-on oligomer filament.J. Biol.

The 18-bp reporter DNA is used instead of the 40-bp reporter DNA of the accompanying article (18Park C.K. Sanchez J.L. Barahona C. Basantes L.E. Sanchez J. Hernandez C. Horton N.C. The run-on oligomer filament enzyme mechanism of SgrAI: Part 1. Assembly kinetics of the run-on oligomer filament.J. Biol.

The 18-bp construct cannot induce ROO filament formation presumably because of the shortened flanking base pairs on either side of the 8-bp recognition site, because those flanking base pairs make contact to neighboring SgrAI–DNA complexes in the ROO filament (Fig. 1A) (8Park C.K.

Therefore, the activation of SgrAI can be controlled in reactions by using different concentrations of activator DNA (i.e. PC DNA, which self-associates into a 40-bp precleaved DNA containing a single primary recognition site cleaved in the SgrAI pattern and which was also used in the accompanying article (18Park C.K. Sanchez J.L. Barahona C. Basantes L.E. Sanchez J. Hernandez C. Horton N.C. The run-on oligomer filament enzyme mechanism of SgrAI: Part 1. Assembly kinetics of the run-on oligomer filament.J. Biol.

SgrAI bound to self-annealed PC DNA will induce ROO filament formation that can incorporate (and thereby activate) SgrAI bound to the 18-bp reporter DNA. In total, six different timed reactions, each having different concentrations of DNA (all with excess SgrAI), were measured and comprise Data Set 4 (Table S1). Reaction mechanism models created to globally fit the reaction data of Data Set 4 are summarized in Table 1 (the “filament assembly” mechanisms). It was not possible to build models allowing for infinitely long ROO filaments, although these models are theoretically possible. Instead, the modeling software limited ROO filaments to only four or five SgrAI–DNA complexes total. However, this simplification is adequate for modeling the data because previous analyses done in the accompanying article (18Park C.K. Sanchez J.L. Barahona C. Basantes L.E. Sanchez J. Hernandez C. Horton N.C. The run-on oligomer filament enzyme mechanism of SgrAI: Part 1. Assembly kinetics of the run-on oligomer filament.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293 (10.1074/jbc.RA118.003680 30068553): 14585-14598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) showed that most ROO filaments are four or five SgrAI–DNA complexes in size or smaller when the total DNA concentration (corresponding to the total concentration of SgrAI recognition sites) is limited to 250 nm or lower, as is the case in these reactions (Table S1). Next, the growth mechanism of the ROO filaments was modeled to allow for either “ends-only” or “breaks-in-the-middle” mechanisms. The ends-only mechanism limits ROO filament growth to only either end and via the addition of only single SgrAI–DNA complexes at a time. In contrast, the mechanism with breaks in the middle allows ROO filaments to grow via the association of two ROO filaments of any size (or single SgrAI/complexes as well) and to dissociate via “breakage” at anywhere within the ROO filament, between any adjacent SgrAI–DNA complex. The implications and justifications for these mechanisms are discussed below. To gain more information on steps following ROO filament formation (including DNA cleavage and product release), we also used an approach where the reporter DNA is doubly labeled with both donor and acceptor (Fig. 2B) . B). This allowed the FRET signal to be lost upon the dissociation of cleaved DNA from SgrAI (because of strand separation of short, unstable duplexes), hence measuring steps following DNA cleavage, ROO filament dissociation, and release of cleaved DNA. These reactions are collected into Data Set 5. We also used this DNA to gain kinetic information on reaction steps up to and including DNA cleavage, but not product release, by analyzing the total amount of cleaved DNA via denaturing PAGE. This approach was used in the timed reactions of Data Set 7. Data Set 6 contains reaction data from the same approach as used in Data Set 4 reactions (activator and reporter DNAs are singly labeled with FRET donor and acceptor, respectively); however, Mg2+ is included in the reactions, allowing for the full DNA cleavage pathway to be performed by SgrAI. Modeling of the full DNA-cleavage reaction data (Data Sets 5–7, with a total of 22 timed reactions) was performed separately from the approach to equilibrium data used with Data Set 4. Different reaction models were built based on those used in Data Set 4 but extended to include DNA cleavage, as well as subsequent steps. These models are also summarized in Table 1 (i.e. “full pathway” models) and were tested for their ability to fit the experimental timed reaction data. Despite the differing degrees of complexity (maximum ROO filament length and filament growth mechanisms, independent or simultaneous DNA strand cleavage, and cleavage with the ROO filament), fitting with these models resulted in very similar extracted microscopic rate constants and similar measures of the quality of fit (see Tables 2–Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Fig. S5, and below).Table 1Models used in data fittingModelType of data used in fittingaEP40, SgrAI bound to self-annealed PC DNA; ES18, SgrAI bound to"

Circadian rhythm, an evolutionary adaptation of most animals to the rotation of the earth, is dictated by a conserved transcription and translation feedback loop. In Drosophila melanogaster, the basic helix-leucine-helix (bHLH) heterodimeric transcription factors CLOCK (CLK) and CYCLE (CYC) directly activate hundreds of genes during the daytime, including period (per) and timeless (tim) (Crane and Young, 2014Crane B.R. Young M.W. Interactive features of proteins composing eukaryotic circadian clocks.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2014; 83: 191-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Their gene products, PER and TIM, respectively, are transcriptional repressors that accumulate during the nighttime and undergo orchestrated phosphorylation mediated by several kinases. Accumulation of phosphorylated PER and TIM, as well as their translocation into the nucleus, gradually reduces the binding of CLK/CYC to the promoters of their target genes, thereby repressing their transcriptional activity (Crane and Young, 2014Crane B.R. Young M.W. Interactive features of proteins composing eukaryotic circadian clocks.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2014; 83: 191-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, Hardin, 2011Hardin P.E. Molecular genetic analysis of circadian timekeeping in Drosophila.Adv. Genet. 2011; 74: 141-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Light exposure at the end of the night and parallel mechanisms in constant darkness trigger TIM and PER degradation, which releases the CLK/CYC complex for the next round of transcription. A similar circadian repression mechanism is employed by mammals. The transcription factor CLK/BMAL1 is orthologous to CLK/CYC and activates the transcription of several direct target genes, including per and cryptochrome (cry) (Takahashi, 2017Takahashi J.S. Transcriptional architecture of the mammalian circadian clock.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2017; 18: 164-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). They encode the transcription repressors PER and CRY, which recruit corepressors to the chromatin and negatively regulate CLK/BMAL1 activity during a 24-hr cycle (Kume et al., 1999Kume K. Zylka M.J. Sriram S. Shearman L.P. Weaver D.R. Jin X. Maywood E.S. Hastings M.H. Reppert S.M. mCRY1 and mCRY2 are essential components of the negative limb of the circadian clock feedback loop.Cell. 1999; 98: 193-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar). One circadian corepressor is the SIN3A/HDAC1 complex, which contributes to CLK/BMAL1 repression by deacetylation of lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9) and lysine 5 of histone H4 (H4K5) residues (Duong et al., 2011Duong H.A. Robles M.S. Knutti D. Weitz C.J. A molecular mechanism for circadian clock negative feedback.Science. 2011; 332: 1436-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recruitment of SIN3A/HDAC1 requires the polypyrimidine-tract-binding protein-associated splicing factor (PSF), which also belongs to the Drosophila behavior and human splicing (DBHS) family (Duong et al., 2011Duong H.A. Robles M.S. Knutti D. Weitz C.J. A molecular mechanism for circadian clock negative feedback.Science. 2011; 332: 1436-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). NONO is another member of this family and is found along with PSF in a large complex associated with mammalian PERIOD proteins (Brown et al., 2005Brown S.A. Ripperger J. Kadener S. Fleury-Olela F.

NONO like PFS binds directly to the period 1 promoter as well as to many other promoters, recruits SIN3A/HDAC1, and represses transcription (Amelio et al., 2007Amelio A.L. Miraglia L.J.

NonO binds to the CpG island of oct4 promoter and functions as a transcriptional activator of oct4 gene expression.Mol. Cells. 2013; 35: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, there is also evidence that NONO plays a positive role in transcriptional activation by synergizing with other co-activators and nascent RNA. For example, NONO knockdown leads to reduced levels of direct CLK/BMAL1 target gene expression (Brown et al., 2005Brown S.A. Ripperger J. Kadener S. Fleury-Olela F. Vilbois F. Rosbash M. Schibler U. PERIOD1-associated proteins modulate the negative limb of the mammalian circadian oscillator.Science. 2005; 308: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), and NONO interacts with photoreceptor transcription factors to activate rhodopsin expression (Yadav et al., 2014Yadav S.P. Hao H. Yang H.J. Kautzmann M.A. Brooks M. Nellissery J. Klocke B. Seifert M. Swaroop A.

This mechanistic uncertainty notwithstanding, the association of NONO with PER appears relevant to circadian rhythms as NONO downregulation results in markedly attenuated rhythmicity and altered periods of circadian gene reporters (Brown et al., 2005Brown S.A.

PERIOD1-associated proteins modulate the negative limb of the mammalian circadian oscillator.Science. 2005; 308: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, Kowalska et al., 2013Kowalska E. Ripperger J.A. Hoegger D.C. Bruegger P. Buch T. Birchler T. Mueller A. Albrecht U. Contaldo C. Brown S.A. NONO couples the circadian clock to the cell cycle.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 1592-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Moreover, mutation of NonA, the Drosophila ortholog of NONO, results in attenuated tim mRNA expression and behavioral arrhythmicity, suggesting a role for NonA in Drosophila circadian rhythms that parallels the role of NONO in mammalian rhythms (Brown et al., 2005Brown S.A. Ripperger J. Kadener S. Fleury-Olela F. Vilbois F. Rosbash M. Schibler U. PERIOD1-associated proteins modulate the negative limb of the mammalian circadian oscillator.Science. 2005; 308: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). NonA must function within the ∼150 central circadian neurons that govern circadian locomotor activity rhythms of Drosophila. These neurons all express high levels of core clock proteins, which undergo synchronized circadian oscillations. Despite this common feature, the central circadian neurons are anatomically and functionally distinct (Helfrich-Förster et al., 2007Helfrich-Förster C. Shafer O.T. Wülbeck C. Grieshaber E. Rieger D. Taghert P. Development and morphology of the clock-gene-expressing lateral neurons of Drosophila melanogaster.J. Comp. Neurol. 2007; 500: 47-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). For example, the ventral lateral neurons (LNvs) are known as the morning (M) cells because they govern the morning peak of locomotor activity (Grima et al., 2004Grima B. Chélot E. Xia R. Rouyer F. Morning and evening peaks of activity rely on different clock neurons of the Drosophila brain.Nature. 2004; 431: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, Stoleru et al., 2004Stoleru D. Peng Y. Agosto J. Rosbash M. Coupled oscillators control morning and evening locomotor behaviour of Drosophila.Nature. 2004; 431: 862-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). These M-cells are also the only central circadian neurons expressing the pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) and are important for maintaining circadian period in constant darkness as well as synchronizing and communicating information from the M-cells to other circadian neurons (Collins et al., 2014Collins B.

Nawathean P. Rosbash M. A resetting signal between Drosophila pacemakers synchronizes morning and evening activity.Nature. 2005; 438: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In contrast to the M-cells, the evening cells (E-cells), which consist of the 6 dorsal lateral neurons (LNds) and the PDF-negative 5th small LNvs neuron (s-LNv), dictate circadian locomotor activity in the evening and in constant light (Picot et al., 2007Picot M.

Light activates output from evening neurons and inhibits output from morning neurons in the Drosophila circadian clock.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e315Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, Stoleru et al., 2004Stoleru D. Peng Y. Agosto J. Rosbash M. Coupled oscillators control morning and evening locomotor behaviour of Drosophila.Nature. 2004; 431: 862-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). More recently, we discovered these E-cells as a major source of rhythmicity and locomotor activity (Guo et al., 2014Guo F. Cerullo I. Chen X. Rosbash M. PDF neuron firing phase-shifts key circadian activity neurons in Drosophila.eLife. 2014; 3: e02780Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie how the E-cells control circadian evening activity are still unclear. It has been known that the core central clock sits upstream of at least some circadian-relevant features of neuropeptide function. For example, pdf mRNA and peptide are undetectable in adult s-LNvs in clk and cyc mutants. Furthermore, PDF staining intensity undergoes circadian cycling in the dorsal termini of the s-LNvs, which is abolished in per01 and tim01 loss-of-function mutants (Renn et al., 1999bRenn S.C. Park J.H. Rosbash M. Hall J.C. Taghert P.H. A pdf neuropeptide gene mutation and ablation of PDF neurons each cause severe abnormalities of behavioral circadian rhythms in Drosophila.Cell. 1999; 99: 791-802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Similarly, circadian neuron expression and possibly release of the PDF and ion transport peptide (ITP) are under circadian control (Gunawardhana and Hardin, 2017Gunawardhana K.L. Hardin P.E. VRILLE controls PDF neuropeptide accumulation and arborization rhythms in small ventrolateral neurons to drive rhythmic behavior in Drosophila.Curr. Biol. 2017; 27: 3442-3453.e4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, Hermann-Luibl et al., 2014Hermann-Luibl C. Yoshii T. Senthilan P.R. Dircksen H. Helfrich-Förster C. The ion transport peptide is a new functional clock neuropeptide in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster.J. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 9522-9536Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The word “possibly” indicates that cycling staining intensity in neuron terminals is usually interpreted to indicate circadian control of secretion and/or vesicle fusion (Fernández et al., 2008Fernández M.P. Berni J. Ceriani M.F. Circadian remodeling of neuronal circuits involved in rhythmic behavior.PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e69Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, Gorostiza et al., 2014Gorostiza E.A.

Biol. 2014; 24: 2161-2167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).Yet there is little direct information that addresses neuropeptide release from circadian neurons. In Drosophila as in other eukaryotes, the protein Complexin (CPX) positively stimulates Ca2++-dependent evoked release of neurotransmitter and also functions as a clamp to inhibit spontaneous release in the absence of Ca2+ (Buhl et al., 2013Buhl L.K. Jorquera R.A. Akbergenova Y. Huntwork-Rodriguez S. Volfson D. Littleton J.T. Differential regulation of evoked and spontaneous neurotransmitter release by C-terminal modifications of complexin.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2013; 52: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It probably functions similarly to regulate neuropeptide release from dense core vesicles (E. Levitan, personal communication). In this study, we show that cpx pre-mRNA is a target of NonA. NonA also physically interacts with CLK during active transcription, suggesting that NonA physically bridges the circadian transcription machinery to nascent RNAs, including cpx. Downregulation of NonA in circadian neurons inhibits circadian evening activity anticipation and modestly lengthens the free-run period, and a very similar phenotype results from downregulation of cpx mRNA; either overexpression of CPX or PDF knockdown rescues this evening activity defect. Interestingly, NonA and CPX knockdowns inhibit circadian neuronal activity, whereas knockdown of PDF alone does the opposite; namely, it stimulates neuronal activity. The results taken together suggest that CLK helps bring NonA to cpx pre-mRNA and positively regulates cpx gene expression. Proper CPX levels are necessary for proper PDF release and for generating wild-type levels of locomotor activity and a normal free-running period. To identify CLK-associated proteins, we generated a 3×FLAG-CLK-14.8-HBH transgenic fly strain containing a full-length genomic sequence with the CLK protein sequence (Menet et al., 2010Menet J.S. Abruzzi K.C. Desrochers J. Rodriguez J. Rosbash M. Dynamic PER repression mechanisms in the Drosophila circadian clock: from on-DNA to off-DNA.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 358-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) flanked by an N-terminal 3×FLAG and a C-terminal biotin recognition sequence (Figure 1A). Extracts were made from this strain with entrained flies collected at different times of day. Because the circadian regulation of clock gene transcription is linked to the circadian regulation of CLK/CYC chromatin association, we used a nuclear extract protocol at times of active CLK gene transcription, Zeitgeber time (ZT)10-ZT14-ZT18, but a whole-cell extract protocol at ZT02, when the complex is predominantly free from chromatin (Menet et al., 2010Menet J.S. Abruzzi K.C. Desrochers J. Rodriguez J. Rosbash M. Dynamic PER repression mechanisms in the Drosophila circadian clock: from on-DNA to off-DNA.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 358-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, Yu et al., 2006Yu W. Zheng H. Houl J.H. Dauwalder B. Hardin P.E. PER-dependent rhythms in CLK phosphorylation and E-box binding regulate circadian transcription.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The CLK complex at the above four time points was purified with a simple two-step affinity purification protocol as previously described (Luo et al., 2012Luo W. Li Y. Tang C.H. Abruzzi K.C. Rodriguez J. Pescatore S. Rosbash M. CLOCK deubiquitylation by USP8 inhibits CLK/CYC transcription in Drosophila.Genes Dev. 2012; 26: 2536-2549Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), i.e., anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation and elution with 300 ng/μL 3×FLAG peptide, which was immediately subjected to a streptavidin pull-down. Bead-bound proteins were extensively washed, subjected to on-gel tryptic digestion, and detected by mass spectrometry. CLK was efficiently captured by both anti-FLAG and streptavidin immunoprecipitations (IPs) at all time points (data not shown); a representative western blot experiment from a ZT14 extract is shown (Figure 1A; compare lane 2 to lane 1 and lane 5 to lane 4). Other expected proteins were also identified by mass spectrometry. For example and consistent with previous studies (Menet et al., 2010Menet J.S. Abruzzi K.C. Desrochers J. Rodriguez J. Rosbash M. Dynamic PER repression mechanisms in the Drosophila circadian clock: from on-DNA to off-DNA.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 358-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), the CLK partner CYC was identified at all 4 time points; substantial PER and TIM were identified at ZT18; and PER, but not TIM, is still associated with CLK at ZT02 (data not shown). Importantly, we found substantial NonA peptides in the CLK complex at all 4 time points (Figure 1B, top). By this peptide number criterion, NonA was the top CLK-associated RNA binding protein. To generate a very approximate ratio of NonA to CLK molecules in the complex and how that ratio changes with time, we divided the NonA peptide number by the CLK peptide number and then normalized for their molecular weights. This should help accommodate the somewhat variable CLK peptide numbers at the different time points as well as the substantial difference in molecular weight between CLK and NonA. The estimated ratio of NonA to CLK molecules is large, between 0.5 and 2.0, at ZT10 and ZT14. This is when active circadian transcription is at or near maximal levels. There is much less CLK-associated NonA at ZT18 and ZT02, when there is considerably less circadian transcription (Figure 1B, bottom). To validate the interaction of CLK and NonA, we assayed NonA by a simple one-step coimmunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody. Consistent with the mass spectrometry results (Figure 1B), NonA is maximally recovered at ZT14 (Figure 1C by inspection; also by calculation; data not shown). Importantly, there is no detectable NonA recovered with an anti-PER antibody at any time point (Figure 1C), unlike what one might have anticipated from the mammalian literature (see Introduction and Discussion). Consistent with an optimal CLK association during periods of maximal circadian transcription, NonA and CLK exhibit similar binding patterns to the tim E-box by chromatin immunoprecipitation; both show peak binding at ZT14, whereas PER binding appears to parallel transcriptional repression and is delayed, as previously shown in mammals and flies (Koike et al., 2012Koike N.

Dynamic PER repression mechanisms in the Drosophila circadian clock: from on-DNA to off-DNA.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 358-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar; Figure 1D). The results taken together suggest that NonA promotes rather than inhibits circadian gene expression. NonA is important for fly courtship behavior and locomotor activity rhythms, but the homozygous NonA loss-of-function mutant causes lethality and infertility (Brown et al., 2005Brown S.A. Ripperger J. Kadener S. Fleury-Olela F. Vilbois F. Rosbash M. Schibler U.

To investigate in more detail the role of NonA in circadian rhythms, we took advantage of the GAL4-upstream activating sequence (UAS) system and several NonA RNAi constructs to selectively knock down the expression of NonA within circadian neurons. We screened several nonA RNAi lines from the Vienna Drosophila Resource Center (VDRC) and Bloomington fly stocks and found that combining single-nonA RNAi constructs with the tim-gal4 driver resulted in modest circadian phenotypes (data not shown). Our screen strategy incorporated the tubulin-gal80ts system to bypass developmental effects (McGuire et al., 2003McGuire S.E. Le P.T. Osborn A.J. Matsumoto K. Davis R.L. Spatiotemporal rescue of memory dysfunction in Drosophila.Science. 2003; 302: 1765-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). To enhance efficacy, we recombined the two RNAi nonA constructs (V26442 and V33901; Dietzl et al., 2007Dietzl G. Chen D. Schnorrer F. Su K.C. Barinova Y. Fellner M. Gasser B. Kinsey K. Oppel S. Scheiblauer S. et al.A genome-wide transgenic RNAi library for conditional gene inactivation in Drosophila.Nature. 2007; 448: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar) with the strongest circadian phenotypes and expressed them with different circadian GAL4 drivers at 29°C. Conditional knockdown of NonA in all adult circadian neurons with the tim-gal4 driver lengthened circadian period by 1.8 hr. NonA knockdown with the narrower dvpdf-gal4, expressed in both morning and evening circadian neurons (Guo et al., 2014Guo F. Cerullo I. Chen X. Rosbash M. PDF neuron firing phase-shifts key circadian activity neurons in Drosophila.eLife. 2014; 3: e02780Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar), had a comparable effect (Figure 2A; Table 1). Surprisingly, we observed a similar long period when NonA is knocked down only in evening neurons (dvpdf-gal4,pdf-gal80), whereas the effect is more modest with the pdf-gal4 driver (Table 1). Although NonA is essential for cell survival, all nonA RNAi flies tested here exhibit a high rhythmicity percentage and index (Table 1). In addition, NonA downregulation with the dvpdf-gal4 driver had no discernable effect on the presence or normal morphology of M- and E-cells (Figure S1). As a control, we knocked down per expression with a per RNAi construct and the tim-gal4 driver; this resulted in arrhythmic behavior, as expected for a strong per loss-of-function phenotype (Figure 2A).Table 1Summary of Free-Run Periods and Evening Activity Inhibition of nonA RNAi Knockdown by Different Circadian DriversGenotypeEvening Anticipation IndexPeriod ± SEMRhythmicity PercentageRhythmicity IndexnonA RNAi/+0.386 ± 0.01723.1 ± 0.2 (n = 48)87.5%0.42 ± 0.11tim-gal4,tub-gal80 > nonA RNAi0.110 ± 0.04024.9 ± 0.4 (n = 45)93.3%0.37 ± 0.09dvpdf-gal4 > nonA RNAi0.066 ± 0.01124.9 ± 0.3 (n = 52)86.5%0.41 ± 0.1pdf-gal4 > nonA RNAi0.247 ± 0.01124.5 ± 0.2 (n = 56)91.1%0.45 ± 0.12dvpdf-gal4;pdf-gal80 > nonA RNAi0.567 ± 0.02524.9 ± 0.2 (n = 65)92.3%0.39 ± 0.12tim-gal4,tub-gal80ts/+0.304 ± 0.01024.1 ± 0.2 (n = 42)90.5%0.45 ± 0.13dvpdf-gal4/+0.376 ± 0.01323.9 ± 0.2 (n = 30)86.7%0.40 ± 0.16pdf-gal4/+0.356 ± 0.01723.8 ± 0.3 (n = 24)95.8%0.39 ± 0.1dvpdf-gal4,pdf-gal80/+0.327 ± 0.01823.7 ± 0.2 (n = 29)100%0.43 ± 0.09dvpdf-gal4,tubgal80ts0.328 ± 0.02323.8 ± 0.2 (n = 36)88.9%0.36 ± 0.05dvpdf-gal4,tubgal80ts > nonA RNAi0.102 ± 0.01624.6 ± 0.1 (n = 52)86.5%0.40 ± 0.12tim-gal4, tub-gal80ts > per RNAi0.257 ± 0.013arrhythmic (n = 36)0%NAExperiments were performed and analyzed as in Figure 2.

Evening anticipation index; periods with error bar (SEM); and numbers of flies, rhythmicity percentage, and rhythmicity index were shown. The lowest evening anticipation index indicates the strongest inhibition of evening anticipation. We noticed that downregulation of NonA with most of these circadian drivers (especially tim-gal4, dvpdf-gal4, and dvpdf-gal4,pdf-gal80) dramatically reduced circadian evening anticipation, the major locomotor activity event under 12 hr light-12 hr dark (LD) conditions. Normally, evening activity gradually increases before lights off at ZT12 and is followed by the startle event that occurs at lights off (Figure 2B). To rule out potential developmental effect of NonA knockdown, we performed a similar experiment with the dvpdf-gal4, tub-gal80ts driver. Adult-specific downregulation of NonA also significantly inhibits evening anticipation and slightly lengthens the free-run period (Figure S2; Table 1). There is a more modest effect on the evening anticipation of NonA knockdown in PDF neurons (Figure 2B). This is similar to the weaker period effect of PDF neuron knockdown (Table 1); this may be due to the weaker pdf driver relative to the dvpdf-gal4 driver (Figure 2A). These effects on circadian period as well as on evening locomotor activity presumably reflect the contribution of NonA to circadian neuron gene expression. To find potential RNA targets of NonA in circadian neurons, we GFP-labeled morning and evening circadian neurons with the dvpdf-gal4 driver and manually sorted these cells at two different time points (ZT14 and ZT23) from the control and the nonA RNAi knockdown strains. Cell sorting, mRNA isolation, and library preparation for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) were as described (Abruzzi et al., 2017Abruzzi K.C. Zadina A. Luo W. Wiyanto E. Rahman R. Guo F. Shafer O.

Yet a recent meta-analysis found the evidence-base to be lacking from a policy perspective. We sought to determine whether private rooms were associated with a lower risk of central-line infections. We examined the discharge records of more than one million inpatients from 335 Texas hospitals to determine patients that stayed in private rooms. Patients who stayed in bay rooms had 64 percent more central line infections than patients who stayed in private rooms. Even after adjusting for relevant covariates, patients assigned to bay rooms had a 21 percent greater relative risk of a central line infection (p = 0.005), compared with patients assigned to private rooms. At the hospital level, a 10% increase in private rooms was associated with an 8.6% decrease in central line infections (p<0.001), regardless of individual patients' room assignment. This study demonstrates and validates the use of private rooms as a structural measure and independent predictor of hospital quality."

Tens of thousands of putative restriction endonucleases and MTases have been identified throughout bacterial and archaeal kingdoms, and thousands of restriction-modification (R-M) proteins have been biochemically or genetically described (1Roberts R.J. Vincze T. Posfai J. Macelis D.

The staggering diversity of R-M enzymes is attributed to their role as a prokaryotic “immune system” (2Murray N.E.

Bacteriol. 1953; 65 (13034700): 113-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two key features of the Type I enzymes are their multimeric composition (one specificity (HsdS, S) and two modification subunits (HsdM, M) form the trimeric MTase (M2S) that can be supplemented by two restriction subunits (HsdR, R) to complete the pentameric holoenzyme (R2M2S)) and their ability to translocate DNA before cleaving it at a distant random site (14Horiuchi K.

Both structural and functional complexity are implied by these two characteristics and have indeed become apparent in decades of research. Type I enzymes split into five families, A–E, based on complementation tests, antibody cross-reactivity, and sequence similarity (8Loenen W.A. Dryden D.T. Raleigh E.A. Wilson G.G. Murray N.E.

EcoR124 belongs to the Type IC family, along with EcoprrI, EcoDXXI, and NgoAV (8Loenen W.A. Dryden D.T. Raleigh E.A. Wilson G.G. Murray N.E.

To study DNA recognition, methylation, translocation, and cleavage, attempts have been made to obtain structures of the individual Type I R-M subunits and their assemblies using X-ray crystallography and EM techniques. These attempts have been met with varying success: a low-resolution structure (∼18 Å) of MTase.EcoKI (PDB codes 2y7c and 2y7h (15Kennaway C.K. Obarska-Kosinska A. White J.H. Tuszynska I. Cooper L.P.

However, the structural information available to date is incomplete and fragmented; structures of the subunits often originate from different R-M systems or even species, and some are only partially resolved. The first structure of HsdR was obtained from EcoR124 in 2009 (PDB code 2W00 (21Lapkouski M. Panjikar S. Janscak P. Smatanova I.K. Carey J. Ettrich R. Csefalvay E. Structure of the motor subunit of type I restriction-modification complex EcoR124I. Nat. Struct.

Functional coupling of duplex translocation to DNA cleavage in a type I restriction enzyme.PLoS ONE. 2015; 10 (26039067): e012870010.1371/journal.pone.0128700Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and 4XJX). HsdR was described as having four domains (endonuclease, two RecA-like helicases, and one helical domain); however, a large stretch of the C terminus (residues 893–1038) was not resolved and said to be disordered (21Lapkouski M. Panjikar S. Janscak P. Smatanova I.K. Carey J. Ettrich R. Csefalvay E. Structure of the motor subunit of type I restriction-modification complex EcoR124I. Nat. Struct. Mol.Biol. 2009; 16 (19079266): 94-9510.1038/nsmb.1523Google Scholar). It was initially suggested that these amino acids add to the fourth helical domain. As demonstrated for a related Type I R-M enzyme, EcoKI, in partial proteolysis experiments, cleaving off 155 terminal residues of HsdR produced a fragment stable in the presence of ATP but unable to bind to MTase (24Davies G.P. Martin I. Sturrock S.S. Cronshaw A. Murray N.E. Dryden D.T. On the structure and operation of type I DNA restriction enzymes.J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290 (10390354): 565-57910.1006/jmbi.1999.2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). De novo modeling of HsdR from EcoR124 supported the notion of the C terminus actively participating in complex formation but revealed little about its structural organization except for a relatively short coiled-coil fragment and an overall disordered nature (25Obarska-Kosinska A. Taylor J.E. Callow P. Orlowski J. Bujnicki J.M. Kneale G.G. HsdR subunit of the type I restriction-modification enzyme EcoR124I: biophysical characterisation and structural modelling.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 376 (18164032): 438-45210.1016/j.jmb.2007.11.024Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Another known crystal structure of HsdR from Vibrio vulnificus also lacks ∼220 C-terminal residues and folds into three domains (endonuclease and two RecA-like helicases), providing no further insight into the 3D structure of the C terminus. A structure of the full EcoR124I complex was derived using EM and small-angle scattering (neutron and X-ray) (26Kennaway C.K. Taylor J.E. Song C.F. Potrzebowski W. Nicholson W. White J.H. Swiderska A. Obarska-Kosinska A. Callow P. Cooper L.P. Roberts G.A. Artero J.B. Bujnicki J.M. Trinick J. Kneale G.G. Dryden D.T. Structure and operation of the DNA-translocating type I DNA restriction enzymes.Genes Dev. 2012; 26 (22215814): 92-10410.1101/gad.179085.111Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, the ring-like shape together with a resolution of only 21 Å unfortunately does not allow orientation of HsdR in the EM map unambiguously. Additionally, the HsdM subunit used for fitting into the EM map was a low-resolution model based on a distant homolog with missing parts modeled de novo. Although this model appropriately describes the open and closed conformations of the full pentameric complex, it is not suitable to explore the HsdM–HsdR interface. In the absence of a crystal structure, it has become apparent that atomic-level structural information could shed first light on the way HsdR subunits attach to the MTase to form a holoenzyme capable of DNA translocation and cleavage. Bioinformatic analysis of HsdR is hindered because of a low sequence identity of ∼23–27% for the classified HsdR subunits between families of Type I R-M enzymes (8Loenen W.A. Dryden D.T. Raleigh E.A. Wilson G.G. Murray N.E. Highlights of the DNA cutters: a short history of the restriction enzymes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 (24141096): 3-1910.1093/nar/gkt990Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Within the Type IC family, full sequences are only available for EcoR124 and NgoAV from Neisseria gonorrhoeae (27Piekarowicz A. Kłyz A. Kwiatek A. Stein D.C. Analysis of type I restriction modification systems in the Neisseriaceae: genetic organization and properties of the gene products.Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41 (11555298): 1199-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) that display ∼75% sequence identity. An alignment between members of different families was nevertheless achieved in endonuclease and helicase I and II domains because of the presence of clearly defined motifs (25Obarska-Kosinska A. Taylor J.E. Callow P. Orlowski J. Bujnicki J.M. Kneale G.G. HsdR subunit of the type I restriction-modification enzyme EcoR124I: biophysical characterisation and structural modelling.J. Mol.

The helical and C-terminal domains exhibit an even lower sequence identity than the rest of the protein, thereby prohibiting a direct identification of conserved regions through multiple pairwise alignment. So far, no motifs or folds have been identified for these two domains, although they have been said to belong to an α-helical class (21Lapkouski M. Panjikar S. Janscak P. Smatanova I.K. Carey J. Ettrich R. Csefalvay E. Structure of the motor subunit of type I restriction-modification complex EcoR124I. Nat. Struct. Mol.Biol. 2009; 16 (19079266): 94-9510.1038/nsmb.1523Google Scholar). The obtained crystal structure of the C terminus of HsdR from EcoR124 in the form of a pHluorin fusion protein reveals that the C terminus stands as a separate domain featuring a helical bundle with its own hydrophobic core and a unique fold. The full-length HsdR model based on a re-refinement of the original WT crystal structure proposes that the C-terminal domain, attached by a short linker region, points outward from the four-domain arrangement and thereby clearly breaks the planar nature of the HsdR subunit of EcoR124. Sequence analysis using putative HsdR sequence data allowed a tentative assignment of conserved amino acid sequences in the C-terminal domain. Combined with the results of biochemical and physiological experiments, the model augments the hypothesis of the involvement of the C-terminal domain in complex assembly and DNA binding. The vector design, purification, crystallization, and X-ray data analysis for pHluorin-HsdR887 fusion protein were reported previously (28Grinkevich P. Iermak I. Luedtke N.A. Mesters J.R. Ettrich R. Ludwig J. pHluorin-assisted expression, purification, crystallization and X-ray diffraction data analysis of the C-terminal domain of the HsdR subunit of the Escherichia coli type I restriction-modification system EcoR124I.

Initial molecular replacement revealed two pHluorin molecules in the asymmetric unit. Using the Buccaneer pipeline in CCP4, 74% of all amino acids were built in eight fragments. After combining the fragments and manual model building, the C-terminal domain was resolved for one of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit. A pore of ∼42-Å diameter with almost no electron density delineates the missing residues from the second molecule in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 1). In total, 382 residues were built in one molecule and 228 in the other, along with 198 solvent molecules; the structure was refined to a final resolution of 2.45 Å (see Table 1 for refinement statistics).Table 1Data collection and refinement statistics for pHluorin-HsdR887 and re-refinement statistics for the extended HsdR structurepHluorin-HsdR887 (PDB code 5JN3)Extended HsdR with C-terminus (PDB code 6H2J)Data collectionSpace groupC2221P212121a, b, c (Å), α (°)83.39, 176.51, 126.02, 90.00123.91, 129.92, 161.01, 90.00Resolution range (Å)20.00–2.45 (2.59–2.45)19.97–2.60Unique reflectionsaValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.34,663 (5303)MultiplicityaValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.4.68 (4.63)Completeness (%)aValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.99.2 (97.4)I/δaValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.11.70 (2.74)Rmerge (%)aValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.10.1 (51.0)Overall B-factor (Å2)41.27RefinementRe-refinementProtein atoms/residuesb4810/61014,917/1832 (13,740/1694)Solvent moleculesb198383 (582)Rwork/Rfree (%)bValues in parentheses are those of the original HsdR structure (PDB code 2W00).,cRfree was calculated using 5% of the data excluded from refinement.19.2/25.420.27/26.38 (22.1/26.5)RMSDbValues in parentheses are those of the original HsdR structure (PDB code 2W00).Bond length (Å)bValues in parentheses are those of the original HsdR structure (PDB code 2W00).0.010.009 (0.014)Bond angles (°)bValues in parentheses are those of the original HsdR structure (PDB code 2W00).1.731.008 (1.418)Ramachandran plot (%)bValues in parentheses are those of the original HsdR structure (PDB code 2W00).Core regionbValues in parentheses are those of the original HsdR structure (PDB code 2W00).98.294.14 (91.7)Allowed regionbValues in parentheses are those of the original HsdR structure (PDB code 2W00).1.84.7 (6.15)OutliersbValues in parentheses are those of the original HsdR structure (PDB code 2W00).01.16 (2.15)a Values in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.b Values in parentheses are those of the original HsdR structure (PDB code 2W00).c Rfree was calculated using 5% of the data excluded from refinement. Open table in a new tab The following description applies to molecule A of the asymmetric unit, as it contains the resolved HsdR domain. Residues 8–244 correspond to the pHluorin sequence and residues 247–398 to the C terminus of HsdR (residues 887–1038 in “HsdR coordinates”). Electron density was missing for residues 263–267 and therefore modeled as a loop in the YASARA software. Residues with missing or poor electron density for the side chains were modeled to Cβ. Two histidines from the His6 tag, 6 and 7, are also present in molecule A, along with a short linker of Glu245-Phe246 between the pHluorin and HsdR sequences. Linker design is a trial and error process (29Kobe B. Ve T. Williams S.J. Fusion-protein-assisted protein crystallization.Acta Crystallogr F Struct. Biol. Commun. 2015; 71 (26144231): 861-86910.1107/S2053230X15011061Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and, as a first possibility, a rigid linker of two amino acids was chosen to reduce conformational heterogeneity and promote interactions between the C-terminal domain and pHluorin. This first trial proved successful. Despite the prevailing assumption that the C terminus is a part of the helical domain, it actually forms a separate domain characterized by a unique fold and its own hydrophobic core. The domain is stable on its own in solution, as demonstrated in molecular dynamics simulations (data not shown). The C-terminal domain consists of six α-helices arranged in two bundles around the hydrophobic core (Fig. 1B), shaped similar to a tube with dimensions of 50 by 26 Å. According to secondary structure analysis in STRIDE (30Frishman D. Argos P. Knowledge-based protein secondary structure assignment.Proteins. 1995; 23 (8749853): 566-57910.1002/prot.340230412Crossref PubMed Scopus (2039) Google Scholar), of 152 residues in the C-terminal domain, 60.5% form α-helices, 6.0% 310-helices, 11.2% turns, 19% coils, and 3.3% are unresolved. The longest α-helix is the fourth one (27 residues), whereas the shortest is the third one (nine residues), which is preceded by three residues forming a 310-helix. All α-helices are arranged in an antiparallel manner, except α5 and α6. They are linked by a 27-residue-long coil–turn–310-helix–turn–coil–turn region, bringing helix α6 to an ∼45° angle in relation to α5 and almost perfectly antiparallel to α4. The N and C termini of the domain are ∼27 Å apart. Six contacts between the C-terminal domain and the crystallization chaperone pHluorin are present (Asn284-Phe246 (linker), Arg285-Tyr45, Asn333-Lys47, Arg349-Thr44, Thr351-Asp82, and Lys376-Thr236). A fold analysis by the Dali server (31Holm L. Laakso L.M. Dali server update.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 (27131377): W351-W35510.1093/nar/gkw357Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar), which compares newly solved structures against structures in the Protein Data Bank to compute the amount of structural similarity as a so-called Z-score, was unable to assign the C terminus to a specific fold family. Of 30 structures with a Z-score of 4.0 or higher reported by Dali, the highest percentage of aligned residues is 71% (PDB code 5W1H, chain A) and the lowest root mean square deviation is 2.4 (PDB code 2DOB, chain A). Most of the structures with a Z-score ≥ 4.0 have less than 50% aligned residues corresponding at best to a three-helix bundle. Hence, the C-terminal domain represents a novel six-helix bundle. The extended HsdR crystal structure was obtained by combining the previous WT HsdR coordinates and structure factors PDB code 2W00 (21Lapkouski M. Panjikar S. Janscak P. Smatanova I.K. Carey J. Ettrich R. Csefalvay E. Structure of the motor subunit of type I restriction-modification complex EcoR124I. Nat. Struct. Mol.Biol. 2009; 16 (19079266): 94-9510.1038/nsmb.1523Google Scholar)) with the structure of the C-terminal domain determined here. Using Phaser from the CCP4 software bundle, the main features of the secondary structure of the C-terminal domain were fitted into the electron density map, even though many side chains and some regions were not fully resolved after refinement (Fig. 1, C and D, and Table 1). High mobility of the C-terminal domain that formerly prevented structure determination correlates well with increased B-factors of amino acids most distal from the core of the enzyme. The resulting structure represents the first experimentally determined full-length structure of HsdR deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB code 6H2J). Nevertheless, to be able to calculate the electrostatic surface potential and determine hydrogen-bond interactions, a full-length HsdR model was generated that includes the missing loops, side chains, and hydrogens. To attain more side chain information, the C-terminal domain from the pHluorin-HsdR887 fusion structure was aligned in YASARA using the Mustang software (32Konagurthu A.S. Whisstock J.C. Stuckey P.J. Lesk A.M. MUSTANG: a multiple structural alignment algorithm.Proteins. 2006; 64 (16736488): 559-57410.1002/prot.20921Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar), and atom coordinates were replaced by higher-resolution information from the pHluorin-HsdR887 crystal structure. A root mean square deviation of 0.884 Å over 119 aligned residues of the C-terminal domain was observed during the alignment. The connecting region between the helical domain and the C-terminal domain (residues 887–902) was modified manually to fit the electron density map of the WT structure. The resulting model represents the first full-length HsdR subunit of a Type I restriction enzyme (Fig. 2). The full-length model was used for all further analysis (see Model S1). The four previously identified domains of HsdR are the endonuclease domain (residues 13–260), RecA-like helicase domains 1 and 2 (residues 261–461 and 470–731), and the helical domain (residues 732–892) (21Lapkouski M. Panjikar S. Janscak P. Smatanova I.K. Carey J. Ettrich R. Csefalvay E. Structure of the motor subunit of type I restriction-modification complex EcoR124I. Nat. Struct.

Consequently, the helical domain should be reassigned to include"
https://openalex.org/W2884473008,"The Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase (SAGA) family of transcriptional coactivators are prototypical nucleosome acetyltransferase complexes that regulate multiple steps in gene transcription. The size and complexity of both the SAGA enzyme and the chromatin substrate provide numerous opportunities for regulating the acetylation process. To better probe this regulation, here we developed a bead-based nucleosome acetylation assay to characterize the binding interactions and kinetics of acetylation with different nucleosomal substrates and the full SAGA complex purified from budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). We found that SAGA-mediated nucleosome acetylation is stimulated up to 9-fold by DNA flanking the nucleosome, both by facilitating the binding of SAGA and by accelerating acetylation turnover. This stimulation required that flanking DNA is present on both sides of the nucleosome and that one side is >15 bp long. The Gal4–VP16 transcriptional activator fusion protein could also augment nucleosome acetylation up to 5-fold. However, contrary to our expectations, this stimulation did not appear to occur by stabilizing the binding of SAGA toward nucleosomes containing an activator-binding site. Instead, increased acetylation turnover by SAGA stimulated nucleosome acetylation. These results suggest that the Gal4–VP16 transcriptional activator directly stimulates acetylation via a dual interaction with both flanking DNA and SAGA. Altogether, these findings uncover several critical mechanisms of SAGA regulation by chromatin substrates. The Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase (SAGA) family of transcriptional coactivators are prototypical nucleosome acetyltransferase complexes that regulate multiple steps in gene transcription. The size and complexity of both the SAGA enzyme and the chromatin substrate provide numerous opportunities for regulating the acetylation process.

One of the major ways that SAGA achieves its function is through its innate histone acetyltransferase activity. This catalytic activity resides in the Gcn5 subunit of SAGA, which transfers acetyl groups from acetyl-CoA (CoA) to lysine residues in the tails of histone proteins (14Brownell J.E. Zhou J.

Heterologously expressed Gcn5 acetylates a single lysine residue, Lys-14, on free histone H3 (15Kuo M.H. Brownell J.E. Sobel R.E. Ranalli T.A. Cook R.G. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Allis C.D.

However, when associated with other SAGA subunits, Gcn5 gains additional specificity and acetylates up to six lysine residues on H3 and to a smaller degree on H2B (4Grant P.A. Duggan L. Côté J.

During transcription, this histone acetylation generates transcriptionally activated chromatin, and in yeast, SAGA mediates this acetylation in several different ways. Under rich medium conditions, SAGA maintains a basal state of histone acetylation globally throughout the yeast genome, poising genes for activation (19Katan-Khaykovich Y. Struhl K. Dynamics of global histone acetylation and deacetylation in vivo: rapid restoration of normal histone acetylation status upon removal of activators and repressors.Genes Dev. 2002; 16 (11914279): 743-75210.1101/gad.967302Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Under stress conditions, SAGA becomes localized to the promoters of induced genes and acetylates chromatin to facilitate transcription initiation (20Eberharter A. Becker P.B.

Additionally, for all transcribed genes, SAGA is present in the open reading frames of genes, and histone acetylation assists in transcriptional elongation (21Govind C.K. Zhang F. Qiu H. Hofmeyer K.

These proteins are downstream of signaling pathways and bind to promoter regions of induced genes to initiate transcription. In addition to a DNA-binding domain, they contain a transcriptional activation domain that can interact with a number of transcriptional coactivators and general transcription factors (30Kobayashi N.

To ultimately better understand the requirements and mechanism of activator-mediated stimulation of SAGA acetylation, we previously developed a nucleosome acetylation assay that utilized chromatin model systems assembled from individual nucleosomes and purified endogenous SAGA complex from budding yeast (36Mittal C. Blacketer M.J. Shogren-Knaak M.A. Nucleosome acetylation sequencing to study the establishment of chromatin acetylation.Anal. Biochem. 2014; 457 (24769374): 51-5810.1016/j.ab.2014.04.024Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In the course of developing this assay, we obtained results suggesting that the DNA flanking a nucleosome could stimulate SAGA activity. To substantiate these results, as well as to characterize the effect of activator proteins, here we develop several new assays for characterizing nucleosome acetylation and binding, and we apply them to studying the role of flanking DNA and activator on SAGA-mediated nucleosome acetylation. To characterize how different factors affect the mechanism of SAGA-mediated nucleosome acetylation, we developed a bead-based, initial rate, steady-state nucleosome acetylation assay that extends our previously described acetylation sequencing assay (36Mittal C. Blacketer M.J. Shogren-Knaak M.A. Nucleosome acetylation sequencing to study the establishment of chromatin acetylation.Anal. Biochem. 2014; 457 (24769374): 51-5810.1016/j.ab.2014.04.024Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In our new assay, we immobilized biotinylated nucleosome GBY (Fig. 1A) onto streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. GBY was assembled from recombinant histones and a DNA template containing 147 bp of the 601 strong octamer positioning sequence that was flanked by 95 bp on one side and 15 bp on the other side. Embedded in the 95-bp flanking DNA and 24 bp away from the 147-bp sequence was a 17-bp recognition sequence for the yeast Gal4 transcriptional activator domain (37Giniger E. Varnum S.M. Ptashne M. Specific DNA binding of GAL4, a positive regulatory protein of yeast.Cell. 1985; 40 (3886158): 767-77410.1016/0092-8674(85)90336-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), although no activator protein was present in our initial assays. To perform the initial rate, steady-state assays, tritium-labeled acetyl-CoA, and purified native yeast SAGA complex were added to the bead-bound GBY nucleosomes, and aliquots of the reaction were removed at specific time points (Fig. 1A). These aliquots were washed to remove unincorporated acetyl-CoA and then counted by liquid scintillation. These assays included concentrations of SAGA and nucleosomes that were significantly lower than we used previously (36Mittal C. Blacketer M.J. Shogren-Knaak M.A. Nucleosome acetylation sequencing to study the establishment of chromatin acetylation.Anal. Biochem. 2014; 457 (24769374): 51-5810.1016/j.ab.2014.04.024Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and required optimization to obtain greater sensitivity. Therefore, prior to counting samples by liquid scintillation, aliquots were washed with hydroxylamine to remove unincorporated acetyl-CoA. This compound cleaves the thioester bond of acetyl-CoA (38Stadtman E.R. Preparation and assay of acyl coenzyme-A and other thiol esters–use of hydroxylamine.Method Enzymol. 1957; 3: 931-94110.1016/S0076-6879(57)03481-3Crossref Scopus (355) Google Scholar) and thereby liberates the tritiated acetyl group away from any CoA nonspecifically associated with the beads. Using this strategy, we found that linear rates of acetylation could be collected over a wide range of nucleosome concentrations, indicating that steady-state, initial rate kinetic analysis was possible. By plotting the initial rates of nucleosome acetylation as a function of nucleosome concentration (Fig. 1B), we observed saturation of acetylation activity on GBY nucleosomes that was well fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation, yielding a Km of 22 ± 4 nm and a kcat of 1.0 ± 0.1 min−1. Additional experiments were next performed to interpret these kinetic constants. Although the Km value of an enzyme is often used as shorthand for the dissociation constant (KD) and for its substrate, there can be a significant deviation between the two. Formally, the Km value represents the overall dissociation constant of all enzyme-bound species and can differ from the KD value because of additional bound intermediates or rapid turnover. To determine the KD value of SAGA for GBY nucleosomes, a binding titration, was performed between SAGA and the GBY nucleosomes in the presence of CoA via electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) (Fig. 1C). CoA was used in this assay because acetyl-CoA would result in turnover by the enzyme, potentially obfuscating our analysis of shifted nucleosome. In this experiment, the band corresponding to GBY nucleosome alone (Fig. 1C, left lane) decreases with increasing amounts of SAGA complex, concomitant with the appearance of a species with decreased mobility. The shifted species requires SAGA but is not SAGA alone as the DNA stain does not detect SAGA without nucleosomes (Fig. 1C, right-most lane). These results indicate formation of a complex between SAGA and the nucleosome and give a qualitative measurement of the strength of the interaction, where half-saturation of binding appears to occur at 16 ± 3 nm. This apparent KD value is in rough agreement with the measured Km of 22 nm, although it may reflect an increase in binding affinity between GBY nucleosome and SAGA. To better understand the nature of the acetylation turnover parameter, kcat, time-course experiments were done to probe early and late acetylation events. Initial experiments were performed with 200 nm nucleosome (∼10 × Km) at a concentration of SAGA complex close to nucleosome concentration (50 nm). Under these conditions, acetylation did not proceed with a simple linear or exponential rate (Fig. 1D). In the late time points, each nucleosome has been acetylated on average more than twice (for example, at 300 s each nucleosome has 10 acetylations on average). This indicates that this portion of the progress curve includes kinetic information on acetylation subsequent to the first histone acetylation. The rate in this region was significantly less than the rate of early time points, and one possible interpretation of these data is that after completing the first histone acetylation, subsequent acetylation is significantly slower. However, the rate of acetylation in the early time points is significantly greater than the measured steady-state turnover from the earlier experiment (Fig. 1B). This suggests that the reaction may undergo burst-phase kinetics, where the rate of pre-steady-state acetylation is faster than steady-state acetylation. To investigate this possibility, time-course experiments were repeated with less SAGA (4.5 nm), where acetylation of the first nucleosomal lysine would not proceed to completion. Under these conditions (Fig. 1E), as expected, nucleosome acetylation only proceeds to a limited extent (on average, only 4% of nucleosomes contained a single acetylation). However, the initial rates of acetylation still appear faster than the linear steady-state rate observed later in the time course, consistent with burst-phase kinetics. Thus, these data together suggest that rapid acetylation proceeds steady-state acetylation turnover. To probe the effect of flanking DNA on nucleosome acetylation, we compared the GBY nucleosome (+95/+15) with a 147-bp nucleosome (+0/+0). This nucleosome is composed of the same recombinant histone proteins and 147 bp of the 601 strong positioning sequence as the GBY nucleosome with no flanking DNA. We found that in the absence of flanking DNA, the overall rate of nucleosome acetylation was reduced more than 5-fold (Fig. 2A), suggesting that flanking DNA stimulates nucleosome acetylation. Although our previous studies with GBY nucleosomes were not affected by attachment to the bead (36Mittal C. Blacketer M.J. Shogren-Knaak M.A. Nucleosome acetylation sequencing to study the establishment of chromatin acetylation.Anal. Biochem. 2014; 457 (24769374): 51-5810.1016/j.ab.2014.04.024Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), we compared the rate of acetylation on bead-bound 147-bp nucleosomes to those free in solution to ensure this attachment was not responsible for the decreased activity (Fig. 2A). Attachment of the 147-bp nucleosome to the bead did not decrease the extent of its acetylation, confirming that reduction in 147-bp nucleosome acetylation relative to the GBY nucleosome was due to its lack of flanking DNA. To characterize the mechanism by which flanking DNA stimulates nucleosome acetylation, we performed initial rate, steady-state kinetic analysis on the 147-bp nucleosome and compared the results with that of the GBY nucleosome (Fig. 2B). We found that without the flanking DNA, the rate of acetylation was lower at all nucleosome concentrations. Under saturating nucleosome concentrations, the rate of acetylation decreased 4-fold, corresponding to an equivalent decrease in kcat (Table 1). Additionally, for the 147-bp nucleosome, the half-saturation of this activity required a greater nucleosome concentration, corresponding to an increase in Km of 2.3-fold (Table 1). Thus, flanking DNA appears to stimulate nucleosome acetylation in two different ways, both by changing the Km and kcat values for the reaction, resulting in a 9.20-fold change of the selectivity constant of the reaction (kcat/Km).Table 1Kinetic constants for SAGA-mediated nucleosome acetylationSubstrateKmkcat, appnmmin−1GBY nucleosome22 ± 41.0 ± 0.1147-bp nucleosome50.6 ± 13.70.25 ± 0.02GBY nucleosome + Gal4-VP1646 ± 114.8 ± 1.1 Open table in a new tab To characterize the meaning of the Km change, we again performed an EMSA experiment (Fig. 2C). In comparing the GBY and the 147-bp nucleosome, we found that the 147-bp nucleosome had a reduced apparent affinity for SAGA of 52 ± 12 nm, requiring 3.3 times the SAGA concentration to obtain the same degree of gel shift. Thus, this result supports the idea that underlying the ability of flanking DNA to change the Km value of SAGA-mediated acetylation is an increased binding affinity for such nucleosomes, although the effect of flanking DNA on SAGA binding may be larger than its effect on the overall Km of the reaction. To help characterize the observed kcat change, we performed an acetylation time course on the 147-bp nucleosome under near-saturating concentrations of nucleosomes (Fig. 2D). Like the GBY nucleosome, the 147-bp nucleosome exhibits a rapid rise in nucleosome acetylation followed by a slower, linear steady-state phase. However, both phases are significantly slower than those exhibited for the GBY nucleosome. Specifically, it appears that the rate of SAGA on the 147-bp nucleosome is four times slower than the GBY nucleosome at all time points, within the error of our measurements (Fig. 2E). This is in good agreement with the difference in kcat values obtained above (Fig. 2B), where the kcat value of the GBY nucleosome was 4-fold faster than that for the 147-bp nucleosome and suggests that the flanking DNA stimulates multiple phases of nucleosome acetylation. To determine which features of the flanking DNA stimulate SAGA-mediated acetylation, several different factors were investigated (all using 10 nm nucleosome and 2.0 nm SAGA). To probe whether the sequence or orientation of the flanking DNA were crucial, a GBY-like nucleosome was assembled such that the Gal4 consensus sequence was eliminated, and the flanking DNA orientation relative to the bead was flipped (+15/+95). The acetylation rate was then measured at a nonsaturating nucleosome concentration (20 nm) so that changes in either Km and/or kcat would be detected. The rate of acetylation of this nucleosome was slightly (1.3-fold) higher than that of the GBY nucleosome (Fig. 3A), indicating, at most, a modest role of sequence or nucleosome side in controlling acetylation rate. To determine whether flanking DNA on both sides of the nucleosome stimulated acetylation, additional substrates were"
https://openalex.org/W2887067252,"Approximately 2 yr ago, I was invited by the journal Structure to write a preview for a recently accepted paper dealing with novel features of a bacterial ribonucleotide reductase (aka RNR). Somewhat whimsically, I entitled my short commentary (1), “The most interesting enzyme in the world.” The title was based on the Dos Equis beer advertising campaign, “The Most Interesting Man in the World” (“Insects refuse to bite him, out of respect,” and so on). In selecting an unconventional title, I was following the example of Stubbe (2), who entitled a 1990 review, “Ribonucleotide reductase: amazing and confusing.” In the past 2 yr, discoveries about this remarkable enzyme have continued to amaze, although perhaps the field is not as confusing as it was 3 decades ago. Here, I briefly describe some of the most amazing recent developments. Some features that have focused attention on RNR include the following: 1) its metabolic importance in catalyzing the first reaction committed to DNA synthesis, 2) the novel free-radical mechanism by which it reduces the 2′ hydroxyl of the ribonucleotide substrate, 3) the enzyme's status as a potential and actual drug target, 4) the complexity of its allosteric regulation, aimed toward balanced production of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) at rates proportional to the base composition of the host DNA, 5) genetic consequences of mutational dysregulation of the enzyme, and 6) the mysterious evolutionary processes that have led to 3 distinct structural forms of the enzyme that act by a similar free-radical mechanism but that differ in subunit composition, source of free radical, source of reducing power, phosphorylation state of the ribonucleotide substrates, and amino acid sequences of the protein subunits. Most of the recent excitement about RNR involves the so-called class I enzyme, which is found in all eukaryotes and many bacteria. Class II RNRs are found in many bacteria and blue-green algae, whereas class III RNRs are found in bacteria that are either facultative or strict anaerobes. Within class I RNRs are 4 subclasses, which differ in the mechanisms used to create an essential free radical. Classes Ia and Ib use a bound metallocofactor to generate a catalytically essential tyrosyl radical, whereas classes Ic and Id generate an active radical without the involvement of an organic cofactor (3). Although the 3 classes differ in subunit structure, source of reducing power, and strategy for generating a free radical at the active site, they are remarkably similar with respect to allosteric regulation of the enzyme's 4 activities. Here, I focus on class I RNRs, particularly the well-studied class Ia enzyme of Escherichia coli. The class I RNR is an α2β2 heterotetramer, composed of a stable α2 dimer (R1) and a stable β2 dimer (R2). The catalytic site lies in the large α subunit. The smaller β subunit carries a stable tyrosine radical. Catalysis begins with a long-range electron-transfer process from an active site cysteine thiol in the α subunit to the tyrosine radical, some 35 Å units away, in β. This process, one of the most striking in enzymology, involves a series of coupled 1-electron oxidation-reduction reactions involving specific amino acid residues along the path between the catalytic site in α and the radical in β. This creates a thiyl radical in the catalytic site, which abstracts an H atom from C3 of the substrate ribose and initiates a catalytic cycle. Allosteric regulation is expressed through binding of dNTPs at 2 distinct sites on the large subunit. Specificity is controlled through binding of regulatory dNTPs—either deoxythymidine triphosphate, deoxy (d)GTP, dATP, or ATP—to the specificity site, a region near the catalytic site. For example, binding of deoxythymidine triphosphate at this site activates the enzyme for guanosine diphosphate reduction and inhibits the reduction of cytidine diphosphate or uridine diphosphate. The rationale is to produce deoxyribonucleotides at rates commensurate with their respective needs for DNA synthesis. Overall activity is controlled by an on-off switch—binding of ATP or dATP at the activity site. ATP is a general allosteric activator, whereas dATP binding at this site inhibits all 4 activities. The activity site is the general on-off switch. In the well-studied E. coli and human RNRs, the activity site lies in the “ATP cone,” a small, flexible domain of ∼100 residues near the N terminus of the α subunit. Structurally, the ATP cone consists of a bundle of 4 α helices capped by a short β hairpin. Adenine nucleotide binding at the activity site is a “coarse control,” with ATP and dATP affinities being lower than at the “fine control” specificity site. The ATP cone, originally described in RNRs, has now been observed in other proteins, including the NdR transcription factor. Sequence similarities among class I RNRs, along with similarities in mechanism and allosteric regulation, might have suggested closer structural relationships than have been shown to exist. In 2011, Ando et al. (4) showed that exposure of E. coli RNR to dATP converted the α2β2 tetramer to an inactive ring-shaped α4β4 octamer in which the α–β interaction blocks the electron-transport process essential for the initiation of catalysis. Also in 2011, Fairman et al. (5) showed human RNR to undergo conversion to an inactive α6β2 ring-shaped octamer under the influence of dATP. A third dATP-induced structural transformation was seen with the Pseudomonas aeruginosa RNR, which was shown to undergo conversion to an inactive ring-shaped α4β2 hexamer. Whether this heterogeneity in quaternary structures is seen also in vivo remains an open question. An unexpected feature of the P. aeruginosa enzyme is the presence of 2 bound dATP molecules on one ATP cone and none on the other (6). Further heterogeneity in ATP/dATP coarse control was seen recently with the class Ib RNR from Bacillus subtilis (7). The endogenous form of a noncanonical R1 of this enzyme was shown to bind dAMP; the dAMP was shown to interact with dATP to form catalytically inactive oligomers. The variety of quaternary structures seen may be a function of the unusual flexiblity of this protein, with small changes in experimental conditions affecting the structure of the protein as isolated. Still more variety in the location and function of the ATP cone was seen recently in the bacterium Leeuwenhoekiellla blandensis, where the ATP cone was found on β, the radical-containing subunit (8). Comparative sequence analysis suggests that the ATP cone, and hence, the capacity for allosteric regulation of total catalytic activity, have been lost and regained at various times in evolution (9). Apparently, when the ATP cone is lost from the large subunit, it can reappear on the small subunit. With the consideration of the general inactivation of RNR by dATP, it is important to determine whether the change in quaternary structure is a cause or a result of the loss of activity. To approach this question Chen et al. (10) examined the structure of the dATP-inactivated class Ia RNR of E. coli and identified several amino acid pairs in the α–β interface of the ring-like α4β4 complex. Several mutations in residues involved in these interactions were created. In every case, a mutation that disrupted the α–β interaction also created an enzyme insensitive to inhibition by dATP. Hence, formation of the ring structure is a cause nor a consequence of sensitivity to dATP. Although it is generally accepted that the catalytically active form of RNR is an α2β2 tetramer, isolation of the active tetrameric enzyme for structural studies has proven extraordinarily difficult in studies with the human, E. coli, and yeast RNR. A step toward this goal was reported recently by Brignole et al. (11). These investigators used cryoelectron microscopy to describe the structure of the human dATP-inhibited α6 circular complex at near-atomic (3.3 Å) resolution, with substrate and allosteric regulators bound. Their results suggested that the path to success for the active holoenzyme may involve treating the enzyme with the right combination of ligands (8 possible ligands at 3 different sites) before crystallization. RNR has long been recognized as a target for treating cancer and other proliferative diseases. Hydroxyurea was the earliest-recognized RNR inhibitor, and it was a valuable reagent in establishing the free-radical mechanism by which RNR functions. However, hydroxyurea has a variety of effects, and a recent study in bacteria identifies multiple targets for hydroxyurea action, most of them resulting from depletion of iron cofactors (12). Results of this study indicate that hydroxyurea-treated cells suffer DNA damage but that there is not a specific inhibition of DNA synthesis. More specific inhibition of DNA synthesis is seen with a variety of nucleoside analogs, some of which are used in cancer chemotherapy. The best known is gemcitabine (2′,2′-difluorodeoxycytidine), which is metabolized to the diphosphate form, which in turn, inhibits RNR by competing with cytidine diphosphate. Gemcitabine is used to treat ovarian, pancreatic, and lung cancer. However, being a nucleoside analog, gemcitabine forms nucleotides that interact with other enzymes of nucleotide metabolism, giving this and related drugs a lack of specificity. Accordingly, investigators are seeking inhibitors that target RNR more specifically. Two recent papers (13, 14) describe exciting results. Ahmad et al. (13) and Huff et al. (14) described a naphthyl salicyl acyl hydrazone-based compound that inhibits human RNR through binding at the catalytic site. Huff et al. (14) synthesized 25 analogs, each selected for its docking to human R1 protein, based on the crystal structure of the protein determined by the same group. The most effective analog inhibited human RNR activity with a half maximal inhibitory concentration of 5.3 μM. Recent attention is being paid to a long-established feature of RNR enzymology—the function of molecular oxygen in forming the stable tyrosine radical on the small subunit. Foskolou et al. (15) reported, as have others, that mammalian cells exposed to hypoxia experience replication stress but do not accumulate DNA damage. Mammalian cells contain 2 forms of the RNR R2 protein, RNR M2 (RRM2) A and RRM2B. Hypoxic conditions induce formation of RRM2B, which combines with R1 to create an RNR that maintains its activity in hypoxia. Although the mechanistic basis for the hypoxia-resistant property of M2B has yet to be defined, Foskolou et al. (15) propose the protein as a hypoxia-specific target for cancer therapy. An additional contribution mentioned here relates to the role of RNR in embryonic development. Obviously, there is tremendous demand for dNTPs early after fertilization; what is their source? Song et al. (16) noted that in Drosophila, some 13 nuclear cleavages occur within 2 h after fertilization. Storage of dNTPs in the egg accounted for only one-half of the total amount required, and the rest was shown to be synthesized “on the go.” An anomalous finding is that despite the large requirement for dNTPs, RNR was inhibited by dATP stored in the egg until its contents had been depleted by ongoing DNA synthesis. Finally, the following includes a few words about deoxyribonucleotide synthesis in the prebiotic environment. How did the capacity for DNA synthesis arise in the “RNA world”? Two groups (9, 17) have recently described plausible chemical mechanisms for reduction of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides. Whether either process contributed to the emergence of DNA as the genetic substance is left to the reader's imagination. The author thanks two anonymous reviewers who helped improve this article. The author declares no conflicts of interest."
https://openalex.org/W2883184585,"The Tibetan horse is a species endemic to the Tibetan plateau, with considerable economic value in the region. However, we currently have little genetic evidence to verify whether the breed originated in Tibet or if it entered the area via an ancient migratory route. In the present study, we analyzed the hypervariable segment I sequences of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in 2,050 horses, including 290 individuals from five Tibetan populations and 1,760 from other areas across Asia. Network analysis revealed multiple maternal lineages in the Tibetan horse. Component analysis of sub-lineage F3 indicated that it decreased in frequency from east to west, a trend reflected both southward and northward from Inner Mongolia. Analysis of population genetics showed that the Deqen horse of eastern Tibet was more closely related to the Ningqiang horse of northern China than to other Tibetan horses or the Yunnan horse. These results indicated that the Tibetan horse migrated first from Central Asia to Mongolia, moved south to eastern Tibet (near Deqen), then finally westward to other regions of Tibet. We also identified a novel lineage K that mainly comprises Tibetan and Yunnan horses, suggesting autochthonous domesticated origin for some Tibetan horse breeds from local wild horses. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that modern Tibetan horse breeds originated from the introgression of local wild horses with exotic domesticated populations outside China."
https://openalex.org/W2884886828,"Decrease of CD4 T cell numbers causes immunosuppression in sepsis. We previously showed the beneficial role of ghrelin in sepsis. We hypothesize that the protective outcome of ghrelin in sepsis is mediated partially through the restoration of CD4 T cells' proliferation. Sepsis was induced in mice by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). The percentage of CD4 T cells in spleen was assessed by flow cytometry and their proliferation was determined by carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CSFE). Compared to sham mice, the percentages of splenic CD4 T cells were reduced by 20%, 21%, and 29% at day 1, 2 and 3 after CLP, respectively. Human ghrelin was given to 3 day septic mice by s.c. injection at 5 and 24 h after CLP. Treatment with ghrelin restored the loss of CD4 T cells by increasing their proliferation in septic mice. The expression of cyclin D1 and B1 was significantly increased, while the expression of p57 was decreased in ghrelin-treated mice compared to vehicle-treated mice in sepsis. Treatment with human ghrelin significantly increased the p-AKT levels in the spleen compared to vehicle-treated septic mice. Human ghrelin plays an important role in reestablishing the proliferation of CD4 T cells and serves as a promising therapeutic agent in sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W2886879322,"Significant advances in biotechnology have allowed for simultaneous measurement of molecular data across multiple genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic levels from a single tumor/patient sample. This has motivated systematic data-driven approaches to integrate multi-dimensional structured datasets, since cancer development and progression is driven by numerous co-ordinated molecular alterations and the interactions between them. We propose a novel multi-scale Bayesian approach that combines integrative graphical structure learning from multiple sources of data with a variable selection framework—to determine the key genomic drivers of cancer progression. The integrative structure learning is first accomplished through novel joint graphical models for heterogeneous (mixed scale) data, allowing for flexible and interpretable incorporation of prior existing knowledge. This subsequently informs a variable selection step to identify groups of co-ordinated molecular features within and across platforms associated with clinical outcomes of cancer progression, while according appropriate adjustments for multicollinearity and multiplicities. We evaluate our methods through rigorous simulations to establish superiority over existing methods that do not take the network and/or prior information into account. Our methods are motivated by and applied to a glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas to predict patient survival times integrating gene expression, copy number and methylation data. We find a high concordance between our selected prognostic gene network modules with known associations with GBM. In addition, our model discovers several novel cross-platform network interactions (both cis and trans acting) between gene expression, copy number variation associated gene dosing and epigenetic regulation through promoter methylation, some with known implications in the etiology of GBM. Our framework provides a useful tool for biomedical researchers, since clinical prediction using multi-platform genomic information is an important step towards personalized treatment of many cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2883074315,"Reproductive function is under the control of the neurohormone GnRH, which activates a G-protein-coupled receptor (GnRHR) expressed in pituitary gonadotrope cells. GnRHR activates a complex signaling network to regulate synthesis and secretion of the two gonadotropin hormones, luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, both regulating gametogenesis and steroidogenesis in gonads. Recently, in an attempt to identify the mechanisms underlying GnRHR signaling plasticity, we identified the first interacting partner of GnRHR, the proto-oncogene SET. We showed that SET binds to intracellular domains of GnRHR to enhance its coupling to cAMP pathway in αT3-1 gonadotrope cells. Here, we demonstrate that SET protein is rapidly regulated by GnRH, which increases SET phosphorylation state and decreases dose-dependently SET protein level. Our results highlight a post-translational regulation of SET protein involving the proteasome pathway. We determined that SET phosphorylation upon GnRH stimulation is mediated by PKC and that PKC mediates GnRH-induced SET down-regulation. Phosphorylation on serine 9 targets SET for degradation into the proteasome. Furthermore, a non-phosphorylatable SET mutant on serine 9 is resistant to GnRH-induced down-regulation. Altogether, these data suggest that GnRH-induced SET phosphorylation on serine 9 mediates SET protein down-regulation through the proteasome pathway. Noteworthy, SET down-regulation was also observed in response to pulsatile GnRH stimulation in LβT2 gonadotrope cells as well as in vivo in prepubertal female mice supporting its physiological relevance. In conclusion, this study highlights a regulation of SET protein by the neurohormone GnRH and identifies some of the mechanisms involved."

https://openalex.org/W2883183618,"Kinetochore fibers (K-fibers) are microtubule bundles attached to chromosomes. Efficient K-fiber formation is required for chromosome congression, crucial for faithful chromosome segregation in cells. However, the mechanisms underlying K-fiber formation before chromosome biorientation remain unclear. Depletion of hepatoma up-regulated protein (HURP), a RanGTP-dependent microtubule-associated protein localized on K-fibers, has been shown to result in low-efficiency K-fiber formation. Therefore, here we sought to identify critical interaction partners of HURP that may modulate this function. Using co-immunoprecipitation and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays, we determined that HURP interacts directly with the centrosomal protein transforming acidic coiled coil–containing protein 3 (TACC3), a centrosomal protein, both in vivo and in vitro through the HURP1–625 region. We found that HURP is important for TACC3 function during kinetochore microtubule assembly at the chromosome region in prometaphase. Moreover, HURP regulates stable lateral kinetochore attachment and chromosome congression in early mitosis by modulation of TACC3. These findings provide new insight into the coordinated regulation of K-fiber formation and chromosome congression in prometaphase by microtubule-associated proteins."

We aimed to present Influenza Like Illness (ILI) and Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) surveillance data and characterize influenza viruses circulating in the country over three influenza seasons. Methods We analyzed sentinel site ILI and SARI data for the 2014–2017 seasons in Georgia. Patients’ samples were screened by real-time RT-PCR and influenza viruses isolated were characterized antigenically by haemagglutination inhibition assay and genetically by sequencing of HA and NA genes. Results 32% (397/1248) of ILI and 29% (581/1997) of SARI patients tested were positive for influenza viruses. In 2014–2015 the median week of influenza detection was week 7/2015 with B/Yamagata lineage viruses dominating (79%); in 2015–2016—week 5/2016 was the median with A/H1N1pdm09 viruses prevailing (83%); and in 2016–2017 a bimodal distribution of influenza activity was observed—the first wave was caused by A/H3N2 (55%) with median week 51/2016 and the second by B/Victoria lineage viruses (45%) with median week 9/2017. For ILI, influenza virus detection was highest in children aged 5–14 years while for SARI patients most were aged >15 years and 27 (4.6%) of 581 SARI cases died during the three seasons. Persons aged 30–64 years had the highest risk of fatal outcome, notably those infected with A/H1N1pdm09 (OR 11.41, CI 3.94–33.04, p<0.001). A/H1N1pdm09 viruses analyzed by gene sequencing fell into genetic groups 6B and 6B.1; A/H3N2 viruses belonged to genetic subclades 3C.3b, 3C.3a, 3C.2a and 3C.2a1; B/Yamagata lineage viruses were of clade 3 and B/Victoria lineage viruses fell in clade1A. Conclusion In Georgia influenza virus activity occurred mainly from December through March in all seasons, with varying peak weeks and predominating viruses. Around one third of ILI/ SARI cases were associated with influenza caused by antigenically and genetically distinct influenza viruses over the course of the three seasons."
https://openalex.org/W2884406684,"FXYD proteins are the regulators of sodium-potassium ATPase (Na+/K+-ATPase, NKA). In teleosts, NKA is a primary driving force for the operation of many ion transport systems in the osmoregulatory organs (e.g. intestines). Hence, the purpose of this study was to determine the expression of FXYD proteins and NKA α-subunit in the intestines of two closely related medakas (Oryzias dancena and O. latipes), which came from different salinity habitats and have diverse osmoregulatory capabilities, to illustrate the association between NKA and FXYD proteins of two medaka species in response to salinity changes. The results showed that the fxyd12 mRNA was the most predominant in the intestines of both medakas. The association of FXYD12 and NKA in the intestines of the two medaka species was demonstrated via double immunofluorescent staining and co-immunoprecipitation. Upon salinity challenge, the localization of FXYD12 and NKA was similar in the intestines of the two medaka species. However, the expression profiles of intestinal FXYD12 and NKA (mRNA and protein levels), as well as NKA activity differed between the medakas. These results showed that FXYD12 may play a role in modulating NKA activity in the intestines of the two medakas following salinity changes in the maintenance of internal homeostasis. These findings contributed to knowledge of the expression and potential role of vertebrate FXYD12, the regulators of NKA, upon salinity challenge."
