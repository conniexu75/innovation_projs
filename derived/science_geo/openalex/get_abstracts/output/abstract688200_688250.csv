https://openalex.org/W4210773546,"Aside from PD-L1 expression, biomarkers of response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are needed. In a previous retrospective analysis, we documented that fecal Akkermansia muciniphila (Akk) was associated with clinical benefit of ICI in patients with NSCLC or kidney cancer. In the current study, we performed shotgun-metagenomics-based microbiome profiling in a large cohort of patients with advanced NSCLC (n = 338) treated with first- or second-line ICIs to prospectively validate the predictive value of fecal Akk. Baseline stool Akk was associated with increased objective response rates and overall survival in multivariate analyses, independent of PD-L1 expression, antibiotics, and performance status. Intestinal Akk was accompanied by a richer commensalism, including Eubacterium hallii and Bifidobacterium adolescentis, and a more inflamed tumor microenvironment in a subset of patients. However, antibiotic use (20% of cases) coincided with a relative dominance of Akk above 4.8% accompanied with the genus Clostridium, both associated with resistance to ICI. Our study shows significant differences in relative abundance of Akk that may represent potential biomarkers to refine patient stratification in future studies. In a large multicentric study of patients with advanced NSCLC undergoing anti-PD-1 therapy, the relative abundance of intestinal Akkermansia spp. was shown to associate with changes in the gut microbiome ecosystem and clinical outcomes."

In this study, we analyzed the proteomes of more than 1,000 brain tissues to reveal new AD-related protein co-expression modules that were highly preserved across cohorts and brain regions. Nearly half of the protein co-expression modules, including modules significantly altered in AD, were not observed in RNA networks from the same cohorts and brain regions, highlighting the proteopathic nature of AD. Two such AD-associated modules unique to the proteomic network included a module related to MAPK signaling and metabolism and a module related to the matrisome. The matrisome module was influenced by the APOE ε4 allele but was not related to the rate of cognitive decline after adjustment for neuropathology. By contrast, the MAPK/metabolism module was strongly associated with the rate of cognitive decline. Disease-associated modules unique to the proteome are sources of promising therapeutic targets and biomarkers for AD."

Here we characterize genetic variations associated with microbial abundances in a single large-scale population-based cohort of 5,959 genotyped individuals with matched gut microbial metagenomes, and dietary and health records (prevalent and follow-up). We identified 567 independent SNP–taxon associations. Variants at the LCT locus associated with Bifidobacterium and other taxa, but they differed according to dairy intake. Furthermore, levels of Faecalicatena lactaris associated with ABO, and suggested preferential utilization of secreted blood antigens as energy source in the gut. Enterococcus faecalis levels associated with variants in the MED13L locus, which has been linked to colorectal cancer. Mendelian randomization analysis indicated a potential causal effect of Morganella on major depressive disorder, consistent with observational incident disease analysis. Overall, we identify and characterize the intricate nature of host–microbiota interactions and their association with disease. Genome-wide association analysis of gut microbial taxa in a single homogenous population-based cohort of 5,959 Finnish individuals identifies 567 independent SNP–taxon associations, including strong associations with LCT, ABO and MED13L."
https://openalex.org/W4225395139,"Abstract Two different sarbecoviruses have caused major human outbreaks in the past two decades 1,2 . Both of these sarbecoviruses, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, engage ACE2 through the spike receptor-binding domain 2–6 . However, binding to ACE2 orthologues of humans, bats and other species has been observed only sporadically among the broader diversity of bat sarbecoviruses 7–11 . Here we use high-throughput assays 12 to trace the evolutionary history of ACE2 binding across a diverse range of sarbecoviruses and ACE2 orthologues. We find that ACE2 binding is an ancestral trait of sarbecovirus receptor-binding domains that has subsequently been lost in some clades. Furthermore, we reveal that bat sarbecoviruses from outside Asia can bind to ACE2. Moreover, ACE2 binding is highly evolvable—for many sarbecovirus receptor-binding domains, there are single amino-acid mutations that enable binding to new ACE2 orthologues. However, the effects of individual mutations can differ considerably between viruses, as shown by the N501Y mutation, which enhances the human ACE2-binding affinity of several SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern 12 but substantially decreases it for SARS-CoV-1. Our results point to the deep ancestral origin and evolutionary plasticity of ACE2 binding, broadening the range of sarbecoviruses that should be considered to have spillover potential."
https://openalex.org/W4225566784,"Host genetics are known to influence the gut microbiome, yet their role remains poorly understood. To robustly characterize these effects, we performed a genome-wide association study of 207 taxa and 205 pathways representing microbial composition and function in 7,738 participants of the Dutch Microbiome Project. Two robust, study-wide significant (P < 1.89 × 10-10) signals near the LCT and ABO genes were found to be associated with multiple microbial taxa and pathways and were replicated in two independent cohorts. The LCT locus associations seemed modulated by lactose intake, whereas those at ABO could be explained by participant secretor status determined by their FUT2 genotype. Twenty-two other loci showed suggestive evidence (P < 5 × 10-8) of association with microbial taxa and pathways. At a more lenient threshold, the number of loci we identified strongly correlated with trait heritability, suggesting that much larger sample sizes are needed to elucidate the remaining effects of host genetics on the gut microbiome."
https://openalex.org/W4210338178,"NLRP3 is an intracellular sensor protein that when activated by a broad spectrum of exogenous and endogenous stimuli leads to inflammasome formation and pyroptosis1,2. The conformational states of NLRP3 and the way antagonistic small molecules act at the molecular level remain poorly understood2,3. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of full-length human NLRP3 in its native form and complexed with the inhibitor CRID3 (also named MCC950)4. Inactive, ADP-bound NLRP3 is a decamer composed of homodimers of intertwined leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains that assemble back-to-back as pentamers. The NACHT domain is located at the apical axis of this spherical structure. One pyrin domain dimer is in addition formed inside the LRR cage. Molecular contacts between the concave sites of two opposing LRR domains are mediated by an acidic loop that extends from an LRR transition segment. Binding of CRID3 considerably stabilizes the NACHT and LRR domains relative to each other. CRID3 binds into a cleft, connecting four subdomains of the NACHT with the transition LRR. Its central sulfonylurea group interacts with the Walker A motif of the NLRP3 nucleotide-binding domain and is sandwiched between two arginine residues, which explains the specificity of NLRP3 for this chemical entity. With the determination of the binding site of this key therapeutic agent, specific targeting of NLRP3 for the treatment of autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases and rational drug optimization is within reach."
https://openalex.org/W4221028201,"ChRmine, a recently discovered pump-like cation-conducting channelrhodopsin, exhibits puzzling properties (large photocurrents, red-shifted spectrum, and extreme light sensitivity) that have created new opportunities in optogenetics. ChRmine and its homologs function as ion channels but, by primary sequence, more closely resemble ion pump rhodopsins; mechanisms for passive channel conduction in this family have remained mysterious. Here, we present the 2.0 Å resolution cryo-EM structure of ChRmine, revealing architectural features atypical for channelrhodopsins: trimeric assembly, a short transmembrane-helix 3, a twisting extracellular-loop 1, large vestibules within the monomer, and an opening at the trimer interface. We applied this structure to design three proteins (rsChRmine and hsChRmine, conferring further red-shifted and high-speed properties, respectively, and frChRmine, combining faster and more red-shifted performance) suitable for fundamental neuroscience opportunities. These results illuminate the conduction and gating of pump-like channelrhodopsins and point the way toward further structure-guided creation of channelrhodopsins for applications across biology."
https://openalex.org/W4210441349,"Currently, licensed seasonal influenza vaccines display variable vaccine effectiveness, and there remains a need for novel vaccine platforms capable of inducing broader responses against viral protein domains conserved among influenza subtypes. We conducted a first-in-human, randomized, open-label, phase 1 clinical trial ( NCT03186781 ) to evaluate a novel ferritin (H2HA-Ferritin) nanoparticle influenza vaccine platform. The H2 subtype has not circulated in humans since 1968. Adults born after 1968 have been exposed to only the H1 subtype of group 1 influenza viruses, which shares a conserved stem with H2. Including both H2-naive and H2-exposed adults in the trial allowed us to evaluate memory responses against the conserved stem domain in the presence or absence of pre-existing responses against the immunodominant HA head domain. Fifty healthy participants 18-70 years of age received H2HA-Ferritin intramuscularly as a single 20-μg dose (n = 5) or a 60-μg dose either twice in a homologous (n = 25) prime-boost regimen or once in a heterologous (n = 20) prime-boost regimen after a matched H2 DNA vaccine prime. The primary objective of this trial was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of H2HA-Ferritin either alone or in prime-boost regimens. The secondary objective was to evaluate antibody responses after vaccination. Both vaccines were safe and well tolerated, with the most common solicited symptom being mild headache after both H2HA-Ferritin (n = 15, 22%) and H2 DNA (n = 5, 25%). Exploratory analyses identified neutralizing antibody responses elicited by the H2HA-Ferritin vaccine in both H2-naive and H2-exposed populations. Furthermore, broadly neutralizing antibody responses against group 1 influenza viruses, including both seasonal H1 and avian H5 subtypes, were induced in the H2-naive population through targeting the HA stem. This ferritin nanoparticle vaccine technology represents a novel, safe and immunogenic platform with potential application for pandemic preparedness and universal influenza vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W4210469056,"Answer ALS is a biological and clinical resource of patient-derived, induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell lines, multi-omic data derived from iPS neurons and longitudinal clinical and smartphone data from over 1,000 patients with ALS. This resource provides population-level biological and clinical data that may be employed to identify clinical-molecular-biochemical subtypes of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). A unique smartphone-based system was employed to collect deep clinical data, including fine motor activity, speech, breathing and linguistics/cognition. The iPS spinal neurons were blood derived from each patient and these cells underwent multi-omic analytics including whole-genome sequencing, RNA transcriptomics, ATAC-sequencing and proteomics. The intent of these data is for the generation of integrated clinical and biological signatures using bioinformatics, statistics and computational biology to establish patterns that may lead to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of disease, including subgroup identification. A web portal for open-source sharing of all data was developed for widespread community-based data analytics."
https://openalex.org/W4210528415,"Chronic stress is a major risk factor for depression onset. However, it remains unclear how repeated stress sculpts neural circuits and finally elicits depression. Given the essential role of lateral habenula (LHb) in depression, here, we attempt to clarify how LHb-centric neural circuitry integrates stress-related information. We identify lateral hypothalamus (LH) as the most physiologically relevant input to LHb under stress. LH neurons fire with a unique pattern that efficiently drives postsynaptic potential summation and a closely followed LHb bursting (EPSP-burst pairing) in response to various stressors. We found that LH-LHb synaptic potentiation is determinant in stress-induced depression. Mimicking this repeated EPSP-burst pairings at LH-LHb synapses by photostimulation, we artificially induced an ""emotional status"" merely by potentiating this pathway in mice. Collectively, these results delineate the spatiotemporal dynamics of chronic stress processing from forebrain onto LHb in a pathway-, cell-type-, and pattern-specific manner, shedding light on early interventions before depression onset."

https://openalex.org/W4225398122,"The peripheral nerve contains diverse cell types that support its proper function and maintenance. In this study, we analyzed multiple peripheral nerves using single-nuclei RNA sequencing, which allowed us to circumvent difficulties encountered in analyzing cells with complex morphologies via conventional single-cell methods. The resultant mouse peripheral nerve cell atlas highlights a diversity of cell types, including multiple subtypes of Schwann cells (SCs), immune cells and stromal cells. We identified a distinct myelinating SC subtype that expresses Cldn14, Adamtsl1 and Pmp2 and preferentially ensheathes motor axons. The number of these motor-associated Pmp2+ SCs is reduced in both an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) SOD1G93A mouse model and human ALS nerve samples. Our findings reveal the diversity of SCs and other cell types in peripheral nerve and serve as a reference for future studies of nerve biology and disease."
https://openalex.org/W4210492228,"Drought accompanied with reduced precipitation is one of the key manacles to global agricultural throughput and is expected to escalate further hence posing major challenges to future food safety. For a sustainable agricultural environment, drought resistant plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are new encouraging prospect, which are inexpensive and have no side effects, as those of synthetic fertilizers. In the present study, five strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa , the strain MK513745, strain MK513746, strain MK513747, strain MK513748, and strain MK513749 were used as drought tolerant PGPR with multiple traits of IAA production, N fixation, P solubilization, siderophore producing capabilities. The strain MK513745 and strain MK513749 produced higher quantities of indole acetic acid (116±0.13 and 108±0.26 μg ml -1 ). MK513749 yielded 12 different indole compounds in GCMS analysis. The strain MK513748 yielded maximum S.I. (3.33mm) for phosphate solubilizing test. Maximum nitrogen concentration was produced (0.18 μg ml -1 ) by strain MK513746. Percent siderophore units ranged from 2.65% to 2.83% as all five pseudomonas strains were siderophore positive. In all growth experiments of plant microbe interaction two varieties of Vigna radiata (AZRI-06, NM-11) plants inoculated with P . aeruginosa strains under drought stress responded significantly (P &lt; 0.05) better than control stressed plants. Maximum shoot length was enhanced up-to 125%, pod/plant 172%, number of grains 65%, 100 seed weight 95%, 100 seed straw weight 124% and total yield 293% were recorded in plants inoculated with drought stress tolerant PGPR in both varieties as compared to respective stressed control plants. Photosynthetic activity, membrane stability (45%), water content (68%) and antioxidant efficacy (19%) were improved with PGPR inoculations. The variety NM-11 (V2) was more tolerant to drought stress with inoculations of Pseudomonas strains than AZRI-06 (V1). Inoculations with these indole acetic acid producing strains would be suitable for plant growth promotion in areas facing water deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W4210644359,"Inherited noncoding genetic variants confer significant disease susceptibility to childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) but the molecular processes linking germline polymorphisms with somatic lesions in this cancer are poorly understood. Through targeted sequencing in 5,008 patients, we identified a key regulatory germline variant in GATA3 associated with Philadelphia chromosome-like ALL (Ph-like ALL). Using CRISPR–Cas9 editing and samples from patients with Ph-like ALL, we showed that this variant activated a strong enhancer that upregulated GATA3 transcription. This, in turn, reshaped global chromatin accessibility and three-dimensional genome organization, including regions proximal to the ALL oncogene CRLF2. Finally, we showed that GATA3 directly regulated CRLF2 and potentiated the JAK–STAT oncogenic effects during leukemogenesis. Taken together, we provide evidence for a distinct mechanism by which a germline noncoding variant contributes to oncogene activation, epigenetic regulation and three-dimensional genome reprogramming. A germline variant associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia activates an enhancer element resulting in increased GATA3 expression, altered chromatin accessibility and changes in three-dimensional genome organization."
https://openalex.org/W4210369939,"In Huntington's disease (HD), the uninterrupted CAG repeat length, but not the polyglutamine length, predicts disease onset. However, the underlying pathobiology remains unclear. Here, we developed bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mice expressing human mutant huntingtin (mHTT) with uninterrupted, and somatically unstable, CAG repeats that exhibit progressive disease-related phenotypes. Unlike prior mHTT transgenic models with stable, CAA-interrupted, polyglutamine-encoding repeats, BAC-CAG mice show robust striatum-selective nuclear inclusions and transcriptional dysregulation resembling those in murine huntingtin knockin models and HD patients. Importantly, the striatal transcriptionopathy in HD models is significantly correlated with their uninterrupted CAG repeat length but not polyglutamine length. Finally, among the pathogenic entities originating from mHTT genomic transgenes and only present or enriched in the uninterrupted CAG repeat model, somatic CAG repeat instability and nuclear mHTT aggregation are best correlated with early-onset striatum-selective molecular pathogenesis and locomotor and sleep deficits, while repeat RNA-associated pathologies and repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation may play less selective or late pathogenic roles, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W4210359082,"The healthcare system is faced by an ageing population, increase in chronic conditions and multimorbidity. Multimorbid patients are faced with multiple parallel care processes leading to a risk of fragmented care. These problems relate to the disease-oriented paradigm. In this paradigm the treatment goals can be in contrast with what patients value. The concept of goal-oriented care is proposed as an alternative way of providing care as meeting patients' goals could have potential benefits. Though, there is a need to translate this concept into tangible knowledge so providers can better understand and use the concept in clinical practice. The aim of this study is to address this need by means of a concept analysis.This concept analysis using the method of Walker and Avant is based on a literature search in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, PsychInfo, CINAHL, OTSeeker and Web of Science. The method provides eight iterative steps: select a concept, determine purpose, determine defining attributes, identify model case, identify additional case, identify antecedents and consequences and define empirical referents.The analysis of 37 articles revealed that goal-oriented care is a dynamic and iterative process of three stages: goal-elicitation, goal-setting, and goal-evaluation. The process is underpinned by the patient's context and values. Provider and patient preparedness are required to provide goal-oriented care. Goal-oriented care has the potential to improve patients' experiences and providers' well-being, to reduce costs, and improve the overall population health. The challenge is to identify empirical referents to evaluate the process of goal-oriented care.A common understanding of goal-oriented care is presented. Further research should focus on how and what goals are set by the patient, how this knowledge could be translated into a tangible workflow and should support the development of a strategy to evaluate the goal-oriented process of care."
https://openalex.org/W4210560351,"Conserved epitopes on the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) stem are an attractive target for universal vaccine strategies as they elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies. Such antibody responses to stem-specific epitopes have been extensively characterized for HA subtypes H1 and H5 in humans. H2N2 influenza virus circulated 50 years ago and represents a pandemic threat due to the lack of widespread immunity, but, unlike H1 and H5, the H2 HA stem contains Phe45HA2 predicted to sterically clash with HA stem-binding antibodies characterized to date. To understand the effect of Phe45HA2, we compared the HA stem-specific B cell response in post hoc analyses of two phase 1 clinical trials, one testing vaccination with an H2 ferritin nanoparticle immunogen ( NCT03186781 ) and one with an inactivated H5N1 vaccine ( NCT01086657 ). In H2-naive individuals, the magnitude of the B cell response was equivalent, but H2-elicited HA stem-binding B cells displayed greater cross-reactivity than those elicited by H5. However, in individuals with childhood H2 exposure, H5-elicited HA stem-binding B cells also displayed high cross-reactivity, suggesting recall of memory B cells formed 50 years ago. Overall, we propose that a one-residue difference on an HA immunogen can alter establishment and expansion of broadly neutralizing memory B cells. These data have implications for stem-based universal influenza vaccination strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4210732016,"The number of scholarly journal articles published each year is growing, but little is known about the relationship between journal article growth and other forms of scholarly dissemination (e.g., books and monographs). Journal articles are the de facto currency of evaluation and prestige in STEM fields, but social scientists routinely publish books as well as articles, representing a unique opportunity to study increased article publications in disciplines with other dissemination options. We studied the publishing activity of social science faculty members in 12 disciplines at 290 Ph.D. granting institutions in the United States between 2011 and 2019, asking: 1) have publication practices changed such that more or fewer books and articles are written now than in the recent past?; 2) has the percentage of scholars actively participating in a particular publishing type changed over time?; and 3) do different age cohorts evince different publication strategies? In all disciplines, journal articles per person increased between 3% and 64% between 2011 and 2019, while books per person decreased by at least 31% and as much as 54%. All age cohorts show increased article authorship over the study period, and early career scholars author more articles per person than the other cohorts in eight disciplines. The article-dominated literatures of the social sciences are becoming increasingly similar to those of STEM disciplines."
https://openalex.org/W4210277306,"Background Transplant related toxicity is a major therapeutic challenge. We have previously reported that the toxicity of chemotherapy is largely not directly because of the drugs themselves; rather it is mainly due to DNA damage, apoptosis and hyper-inflammation triggered by cell-free chromatin particles that are released because of drug-induced host cell death. Cell-free chromatin particles can be inactivated by free-radicals which are generated when the nutraceuticals resveratrol and copper are administered orally. We investigated if a combination of resveratrol and copper would reduce transplant related toxicities in an exploratory, prospective dose-escalation study. Patients and methods Twenty-five patients with multiple myeloma were enrolled between March 2017 to August 2019. Patients were divided into 3 groups: control (Group 1, N = 5) received vehicle alone; group 2 (N = 15) received resveratrol-copper at dose level I (resveratrol = 5.6 mg and copper = 560 ng); group 3 (N = 5) received resveratrol-copper at dose level II (resveratrol = 50 mg and copper = 5 μg). The dose was given twice daily with the first dose administered 48 hours before administering melphalan and continued until day +21 post-transplant. Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.02 was used to assess toxicities which included oral mucositis, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Measurement of inflammatory cytokines was done by ELISA. Results All patients (100%) in the control group developed grade 3/4 oral mucositis compared to 8/20 (40%) in both resveratrol-copper group 2 plus group 3 combined (P = 0.039). Reduction in inflammatory cytokines: salivary TNF - α (p = 0.012) and IL—1β (p = 0.009) in dose level I but not in dose level II was observed. Conclusions A combination of resveratrol-copper reduced transplant related toxicities in patients with multiple myeloma receiving high dose melphalan. We conclude that relatively inexpensive nutraceuticals may be useful as adjuncts to chemotherapy to reduce its toxicity. Registration The trial was registered under Clinical Trial Registry of India (no. CTRI/2018/02/011905 )."
https://openalex.org/W4210715361,"Emerging evidence has indicated a possible link between obesity in early life with subsequent cancer risks, but its association with gastric cancer remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the association of obesity at ages 18-20 and 35 with the later risk of gastric cancer among the Korean population. Included were 122,724 individuals who participated in the large-scale prospective cohort study, the Health Examinees-Gem (HEXA-G) study, during 2004-2017. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for gastric cancer risk associated with body mass index (BMI) at ages 18-20 and 35 years. During a mean follow-up period of 8.6±2.1 years, a total 927 gastric cancer cases (531 men and 396 women) were identified. When compared to normal BMI (18.5-23.0 kg/m2), obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) at age 35 was significantly associated with increased risk of gastric cancer later in life among total participants (HR 1.94, 95% CI 1.26-2.97, p 0.01). When analyzed separately by sex, obesity at 35 years of age was significantly associated with increased risk of gastric cancer among both men (HR 1.79, 95% CI 1.02-3.13, p 0.05) and women (HR 2.35, 95% CI 1.21-4.60, p 0.02). No significant associations were found for obesity at late adolescence in both men and women. Our findings suggest that obesity in early adulthood may be associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer. The results may aid in understanding the etiology of GC in a population with a divergent trend of gastric cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4210274567,"Discrimination of people living with HIV/AIDS is one of the reported obstacles to the achievement of universal access to HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, care, and support programs. Many international agencies have made combating HIV/AIDS stigma and discrimination a top priority. However, previous evidence in different parts of Africa revealed that the magnitude of HIV/AIDS-related discriminatory attitude is significantly high.To assess discriminatory attitude towards people living with HIV/AIDS and its associated factors among the adult population in 15 sub-Saharan African nations.We have used the 15 Demographic and Health Survey data that were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) from 2015 to 2019/20. Each country's data was appended and a total weighted sample of 318,186 (unweighted sample = 315,448) adults who had ever heard of AIDS was used for the final analysis. The two discriminatory attitude questions were used to get the outcome variable and those who answered ""Yes"" or ""don't know"" for both questions were counted as if they had no discriminatory attitude towards people living with HIV/AIDS. To assess the factors associated with discriminatory attitude towards people living with HIV/AIDS, we have fitted a multilevel binary logistic regression model. Bivariable analysis was done to select eligible variables for the multivariable analysis. Finally, variables with p<0.05, in the multivariable analysis, were considered as significant predictors of discriminatory attitude towards people living with HIV/AIDS.The prevalence of discriminatory attitude towards HIV/AIDS in the 15 sub-Saharan African nations was 47.08% (95% CI: 47.08, 47.42), which ranges from 17.64% (95% CI: 17.22, 18.07) in Malawi to 79.75% (95% CI: 79.02, 80.45) in Guinea. In the multivariable analysis, both individual level and community level variables were significantly associated with discriminatory attitude towards people living with HIV/AIDS. Being younger age, no formal education, never married, low socioeconomic status, male-headed household, non-contraceptive use, no mass media exposure, and incorrect comprehensive knowledge towards HIV/AIDS were among the individual-level factors that were associated with higher odds of discriminatory attitude towards people living with HIV/AIDS. While being from urban residence and the western SSA region were among the community-level factors that were significantly associated with higher odds discriminatory attitude towards people living with HIV/AIDS.The prevalence of discriminatory attitude towards people living with HIV/AIDS in 15 sub-Saharan African nations was high. Both individual and community-level factors were associated with discriminatory attitude towards people living with HIV/AIDS. Therefore, special attention should be given to those who are poor, uneducated, and younger adults. In addition, it is better to strengthen the accessibilities of different media for adult populations to create an appropriate attitude towards people with HIV/AIDS."
https://openalex.org/W4210359941,"Mental illness is a leading cause of disease burden amongst children and young people (CYP). This is exacerbated in low- and middle-income (LMIC) countries which often have embryonic care structures. Understanding and targeting illness beliefs is a potentially efficacious way of optimising the development of health prevention interventions. These beliefs remain relatively underexplored in CYP in LMIC contexts. Aim: To develop an in-depth understanding of CYPs beliefs about mental health and illness in Indonesia.Semi-structured interviews (n = 43) combined with photo elicitation methodology were undertaken with CYP aged 11-15 from Java, Indonesia. Our sample comprised those living with (n = 19) and without (n = 24) high prevalence mental health conditions, specifically anxiety or depression. Data were analysed using framework analysis, informed by the Common Sense Model of Self-Regulation of Health and Illness. Positive mental health and illness were dichotomised in accounts with mental health typically characterised as an absence of mental disturbance. This contributed to attributions of abnormality and the marginalisation of those with mental illness. Mental illness was conceptualised as a single entity, commonly arising from individual failings. This prompted feelings of self-stigma in those with lived experience of mental illness. Analysis identified marked differences in the perceived time dimensions of positive mental health and illness with mental illness conceived as less transient than episodes of positive mental health. Illness beliefs appeared relatively consistent across the two groups of CYP although some nuanced differences were identified. CYP with anxiety and depression were less likely to believe that mental illness could be diagnosed visually, more likely to uphold multiple causal factors and endorse the potential efficacy of professional input.Public health interventions to increase understanding may be necessary to develop healthcare systems to reduce treatment barriers, optimise return on investment and enhance population health effect."
https://openalex.org/W4210694927,"Sport-based life skills interventions offer compelling pathways to understanding the role of physical activity and sport on youth psychosocial and other development outcomes. This is because of evidence that shows the benefits of sport programs to health and well-being of youth, and more lately other areas such as academic achievement and various life skills such as teamwork, leadership and goal setting. However, much of the research in this area of youth development is largely descriptive, with limited capacity to infer causal relationships and application across contexts. Therefore, this study examines the effects of a sport-based intervention program on life skills and entrepreneurial mindsets of youth from three African countries (n = 146, average age = 15.9 years, female = 48.6%). Half of the recruited participants were assigned to a three-week life skills intervention program and the remaining half to a sport-only control program. Both groups completed a demographic information questionnaire, Life Skills for Sport Scale and the General Enterprising Tendency v2 test. Two-way mixed ANOVAs showed significant post-intervention changes in life skills for both groups but changes in entrepreneurial mindsets for the intervention group only. This demonstrates the relevance of sport-based interventions to youth development outcomes in different contexts and the transformative potential of youth sport reported in previous studies. The findings have important implications for intentional and targeted delivery of programs to enhance specific youth development outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4210456713,"With the development of recent years, the field of deep learning has made great progress. Compared with the traditional machine learning algorithm, deep learning can better find the rules in the data and achieve better fitting effect. In this paper, we propose a hybrid stock forecasting model based on Feature Selection, Convolutional Neural Network and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (FS-CNN-BGRU). Feature Selection (FS) can select the data with better performance for the results as the input data after data normalization. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is responsible for feature extraction. It can extract the local features of the data, pay attention to more local information, and reduce the amount of calculation. The Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BGRU) can process the data with time series, so that it can have better performance for the data with time series attributes. In the experiment, we used single CNN, LSTM and GRU models and mixed models CNN-LSTM, CNN-GRU and FS-CNN-BGRU (the model used in this manuscript). The results show that the performance of the hybrid model (FS-CNN-BGRU) is better than other single models, which has a certain reference value."
https://openalex.org/W4210661449,"Measurement of external load in players provides objective information to optimise the weekly balance between training and recovery to improve performance and prevent injuries. Our aim was to evaluate the incidence of sports-related muscle injuries of the lower limb in relation to external load, measured by global positioning system (GPS), in football players. A descriptive study was carried out. Data were collected from 71 professional male football players (30 professionals and 41 youth players) from an elite football club competing in the Spanish and European League in the 2017-2018 season. As external load variables, we measured High Metabolic Load Distance (HMLD), High Speed Running (HSR), Player Load (PL), and Total Distance (TD) through GPS. Injury rate (IR) was calculated both in relation to such GPS load metrics and to load exposure time. We considered categories (youth and professional), playing positions (centre back, full back, midfielder, and forward), and training day with respect to match-day (-4MD, -3MD, -2MD, -1MD, MD, +1MD, +2MD). The GPS load metrics HMLD, HSR, PL, and TD showed very similar patterns across categories and positions, but varied according to training session or MD. The highest loads were observed on MD and three days prior to the match (-3MD). Similarly, the overall IR, both calculated per load exposure time and per GPS load metrics, was highest on MD and -3MD. Again, no differences were observed between youth and professional players. Midfielders demonstrated the highest IR in all metrics, followed by the forwards. In conclusion, this study suggests that external load and incidence of muscle injuries are directly proportional. Therefore, the measurement of more external load variables other than load exposure time, such as the GPS metrics HMLD, HSR, PL, and TD may help to describe the pattern and magnitude of injuries. Future studies based on ours may help to further improve the understanding of the incidence of muscle injuries on the basis of external loads measurements in different football teams."
https://openalex.org/W4210726271,"In late December 2019, pneumonia cases of unknown origin were reported in Wuhan, China. This virus was named SARS-CoV2 and the clinical syndrome was named coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). South Africa, despite strict and early lockdown has the highest infection rate in Africa. A key component of South Africa's response to SARSCoV2 was the rapid scale-up of diagnostic testing. The Abbott SARS-CoV2 assay detects IgG antibodies against the Nucleocapsid (N) protein of the SARS-CoV2 virus. This study undertook to validate and evaluate performance criteria of the Abbott assay and to establish whether this assay would show clinical utility in our population. Positive patients (n = 391) and negative controls (n = 139) were included. The Architect-i and Alinity-i systems were analyzers that were used to perform the SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. In-house ELISA was incorporated into the study as a confirmatory serology test. A total of number of 530 participants was tested, 87% were symptomatic with infection and 13% were asymptomatic. When compared to RT-qPCR, the sensitivity of Architect and Alinity SARS-CoV2 assays was 69.5% and 64.8%, respectively. Specificity for Architect and Alinity assays was 95% and 90.3%, respectively. The Abbott assay was also compared to in house ELISA assay, with sensitivity for the Architect and Alinity assays of 94.7% and 92.5%, respectively. Specificity for Abbott Alinity assays was 91.7% higher than Abbott Architect 88.1%. Based on the current findings testing of IgG after 14 days is recommended in South Africa and supports other studies performed around the world."

Utility is a measure of HRQoL that includes preferences for health outcomes, used in treatment decision-making. Generic preference-based instruments lack BrC-specific concerns, indicating the need for a BrC-specific preference-based instrument. Our objective was to determine dimensions of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) general cancer (QLQ-C30) and breast module (BR45) instruments, the first step in our development of the novel Breast Utility Instrument (BUI).Patients (n = 408) attending outpatient BrC clinics at an urban cancer centre, and representing a spectrum of BrC health states, completed the QLQ-C30 and BR45. We performed confirmatory factor analysis of the combined QLQ-C30 and BR45 using mean-and variance-adjusted unweighted least squares estimation. The hypothesized factor model was based on clinical relevance, item distributions, missing data, item-importance, and internal reliability of dimensions. Models were evaluated based on global and item fit, local areas of strain, and likelihood ratio tests of nested models.Our final model had 10 dimensions: physical and role functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning, body image, pain, fatigue, systemic therapy side effects, sexual functioning and enjoyment, arm and breast symptoms, and endocrine therapy symptoms. Good overall model fit was achieved: χ2/df: 1.45, Tucker-Lewis index: 0.946, comparative fit index: 0.951, standardized root-mean-square residual: 0.069, root-mean-square error of approximation: 0.033 (0.030-0.037). All items had salient factor loadings (λ>0.4, p<0.001).We identified important BrC HRQoL dimensions to develop the BUI, a BrC-specific preference-based instrument."
https://openalex.org/W4226139699,"The World Health Organization recommends seeking medical treatment within 24 hours after transmission of malaria to reduce the risk of severe complications and its onwards spread. However, in some parts of Indonesia, including East Nusa Tenggara Province (ENTP), this adherence is not achieved for a range of reasons including delays in visiting health centres. This study aims to determine factors related to the poor understanding of appropriate malaria treatment-seeking behaviour (AMTSB) of rural adults in ENTP. AMTSB was defined as seeking treatment at professional health facilities within 24 hours of the onset of malaria symptoms.A cross-sectional study was conducted in the East Sumba, Belu, and East Manggarai district of ENTP between October and December 2019. A multi-stage cluster sampling procedure was applied to enrol 1503 participants aged between 18 and 89 years of age. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to assess significant factors associated with the poor understanding of AMTSB.Eighty-six percent of participants were found to be familiar with the term malaria. However, poor understanding level of AMTSB in rural adults of ENTP achieved 60.4% with a 95% confidence interval (CI): 56.9-63.8. Poor understanding of AMTSB was significantly higher for adults with no education (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 3.42, 95% CI: 1.81, 6.48) compared to those with a diploma or above education level; having low SES (AOR: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.19, 2.96) compared to those having high SES; residing at least three kilometres (km) away from the nearest health facilities (AOR: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.2, 2.5) compared to those living within one km from the nearest health service; and working as farmer (AOR: 1.63, 95% CI: 1.01-2.63) compared to those working at government or non-government sector. Whilst, other factors such as ethnicity and family size were not associated with the poor understanding of AMTSB.The proportion of rural adults having a poor understanding of AMTSB was high leading to ineffective implementation of artemisinin-based combination therapies as the method to treat malaria in ENTP. Improving awareness of AMTSB for rural adults having low level education, low SES, working as a farmer, and living at least three km from the nearest health facilities is critical to support the efficacy of malaria treatment in ENTP. This method will support the Indonesian government's objective to achieve malaria elimination by 2030."
https://openalex.org/W4210346650,"ABCA1 and ABCA4 are enigmatic because they transport substrates in opposite directions yet share >50% amino acid identity. ABCA4 imports lipid conjugates but ABCA1 exports lipids. Both hydrolyze ATP to drive transport, and both contain cytoplasmic regulatory domains (RDs) following nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) in the primary structure. The tertiary structures of several ABC importers, including ABCA4, show that each RD forms a domain-swapped latch that locks onto the opposing RD and holds the NBDs close together. Crucially, sequences encoding the RDs and their bridges are among the most conserved in the entire ABC-A subfamily. In the original cryo-EM structure of ABCA1, the RDs were modeled without crossover. After close inspection of that cryo-EM density map and the recent structure of ABCA4, we propose that the RDs of ABCA1 also form a domain-swapped latch. A refined ABCA1 model containing latches exhibited significantly improved overall protein geometry. Critically, the conserved crossover sequence leading to the RD-domain swap is directly supported by the original cryo-EM density map of ABCA1 and appears to have been overlooked. Our refined ABCA1 model suggests the possibility that ABCA1, despite being an exporter, has highly restrained NBDs that suggest a transport mechanism that is distinct from 'alternating access'."

The activity of oxidant resistant human apoA1 was compared to unmodified human apoA1 in mouse models of atherosclerosis progression and regression.Human apoA1 and the MPO oxidant resistant 4WF isoform transgenic mice were bred to LDL receptor deficient (LDLr KO) mice and fed a western-type diet. High level expression of these human apoA1 isoforms did not lead to increased HDL-cholesterol levels on the LDLr KO background. In males and females, lesion progression was studied over time, and both apoA1 and 4WF transgenic mice vs. LDLr KO mice had significant and similar delayed lesion progression and reduced non-HDL cholesterol. Using time points with equivalent lesion areas, lesion regression was initiated by feeding the mice a low-fat control diet containing a microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitor for 7 weeks. Lesions regressed more in the male apoA1 and 4WF transgenics vs. the LDLr KO, but the 4WF isoform was not superior to the unmodified isoform in promoting lesion regression.Both human apoA1 and the 4WF MPO oxidant resistant apoA1 isoform delayed lesion progression and promoted lesion regression in LDLr KO mice, with more pronounced effects in males than females; moreover, the 4WF isoform functioned similarly to the unmodified human apoA1 isoform."
https://openalex.org/W4210439167,"The growing complexity of cancer care necessitates collaboration among different professionals. This interprofessional collaboration improves cancer care delivery and outcomes. Treatment decision-making within the context of a multidisciplinaire team meeting (MDTMs) may be seen as a particular form of interprofessional collaboration. Various studies on cancer MDTMs highlight a pattern of suboptimal information sharing between attendants. To overcome the lack of non-medical, patient-based information, it might be recommended that non-physician care professionals play a key patient advocacy role within cancer MDTMs. This study aims to explore non-physician care professionals' current and aspired role within cancer MDTMs. Additionally, the perceived hindering factors for these non-physician care professionals to fulfil their specific role are identified. The analysis focuses on nurses, specialist nurses, head nurses, psychologists, social workers, a head of social workers and data managers. The results show that non-physician care professionals play a limited role during case discussions in MDTMs. Neither do they actively participate in the decision-making process. Barriers perceived by non-physician care professionals are classified on two main levels: 1) team-related barriers (factors internally related to the team) and 2) external barriers (factors related to healthcare management and policy). A group of non-physician care professionals also belief that their information does not add value in the decision-making proces and as such, they underestimate their own role in MDTMs. To conclude, a change of culture is needed towards an interdisciplinary collaboration in which knowledge and expertise of different professions are equally assimilated into an integrated perspective to guarantee a true patient-centred approach for cancer MDTMs."
https://openalex.org/W4210770789,"The intensity of malaria transmission is measured by parous rate, daily survival rate, human blood meal frequency, sporozoite rate, and entomological inoculation rates. Female parous status is a key index of vector competence, adult vector longevity, recruitment rate of adult, and the length of a gonotrophic cycle. Hence, the present study was aimed to investigate the parous rate and the longevity of Anopheles mosquitoes in Bure District, Northwestern Ethiopia. Parous rate was estimated as the number of mosquitoes with parous ovaries divided by the number of females dissected multiplied by 100. Mosquito life expectancy (longevity as d) was estimated by. One way- ANOVA was applied to confirm the presence of parous rate difference in the villages (p < 0.05). A total of 952 unfed hosts-seeking Anopheles mosquitoes was dissected for parous rate determination. The overall parous rate of An. arabiensis in the district was 52.0%, and the highest parous rate was recorded in Shnebekuma than other villages (F 2, 33 = 6.974; p = 0.003). Similarly, the parous rate of An. cinereus showed significant variation among villages (F 2, 33 = 5.044, p = 0.012) and the highest rate (63.0%) was recorded in Bukta. The mean longevity of An. funestus, An. arabiensis, An. coustani, An. squamosus, An. pharoensis, and An. cinereus was 6.5 days, 4.6 days, 3.5 days, 3.7 days, 2.7 days, and 2.2 days, respectively. The longevity of each species was not sufficient to complete the life cycle of malaria parasite for malaria transmission throughout the year because P. falciparum requires from 12-14 day."
https://openalex.org/W4210811424,"Background This study investigated selected inflammatory responses to acute and chronic exercise in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted on all relevant exercise-based intervention publications with IBD participants. The study included articles that utilised a broad range of acute and chronic exercise interventions, with inflammatory biomarkers measured and symptoms documented, both pre- and post-exercise for those with IBD. The search was limited to studies published in English, the use of human participants, and primary studies, with no restrictions on date of publication or participant’s age. Articles were retrieved through the electronic databases: PubMed, SPORTDiscus, and Scopus. This study adhered to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Results Six inflammatory markers were included in the meta-analysis which consisted of five studies. Exercise interventions resulted in no significant difference in IL-6 ( SMD = -0.09; 95% CI = -0.49, 0.30; P = 0.64), TNF-α ( SMD = 0.08; 95% CI = -0.31, 0.48; P = 0.68), CRP ( SMD = -0.04; 95% CI = -0.58, 0.50; P = 0.89), IL-17 ( SMD = 0.15; 95% CI = -0.45, 0.76; P = 0.62), leukocytes ( SMD = 0.40; 95% CI = -0.53, 1.33; P = 0.40) or lymphocytes ( SMD = 0.32; 95% CI = -0.33, 0.97; P = 0.33), thus, indicating exercise may have no effect on inflammatory markers in IBD. Bowel symptoms improved following regular moderate exercise that incorporated stress management. Conclusion Heterogeneity among the identified literature may have led to exercise interventions being ineffective in reducing inflammation. Although the limited number of eligible studies may reduce the reliability of results, it emphasises the need for additional research in this domain. Importantly, no adverse symptomatic responses to exercise indicate that exercise is safe for IBD patients."
https://openalex.org/W4210358202,"Background Sickle cell disease (SCD) incurs vaso-occlusive episodes and organ damage, including nephropathy. Despite displaying characteristics of vascular dysfunction, SCD patients tend to present relatively lower systemic blood pressure (BP), via an unknown mechanism. We investigated associations between BP and renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) components in SCD and determined whether an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE; often used to slow SCD glomerulopathy) further modulates BP and RAS components in a murine model of SCD. Methods BP was compared in human subjects and mice with/without SCD. Plasma angiotensin II, ACE and renin were measured by immunoassay. BP was reevaluated after treating mice with enalapril (25 mg/kg, 5x/week) for 5 weeks; plasma and organs were stored for angiotensin II and ACE activity measurement, and quantitative real-time PCR. Results Diastolic BP and systolic BP were significantly lower in patients and mice with SCD, respectively, compared to controls. Reduced BP was associated with increased plasma renin and markers of kidney damage (mice) in SCD, as well as significantly decreased plasma ACE concentrations and ACE enzyme activity. As expected, enalapril administration lowered BP, plasma angiotensin II and organ ACE activity in control mice. In contrast, enalapril did not further reduce BP or organ ACE activity in SCD mice; however, plasma angiotensin II and renin levels were found to be significantly higher in enalapril-treated SCD mice than those of treated control mice. Conclusion Relative hypotension was confirmed in a murine model of SCD, in association with decreased ACE concentrations in both human and murine disease. Given that ACE inhibition has an accepted role in decreasing BP, further studies should investigate mechanisms by which ACE depletion, via both Ang II-dependent and alternative pathways, could contribute to reduce BP in SCD and understand how ACE inhibition confers Ang II-independent benefits on kidney function in SCD."

The degree of cooperation between the cities was analyzed based on the frequency of occurrence and co-occurrence of information on tourist attractions or cities in the Yangtze River Delta region in tourist notes, tourist route quotes, and official news. This study divides 27 cities in the Yangtze River Delta region into three categories: those where supply matches demand (e.g., Shanghai and Nanjing), nine cities where there is a demand lag (e.g., Zhenjiang), and 16 cities where there is a supply lag (e.g., Wuxi). Investigating the differences between the supply and demand networks is helpful to understand the effectiveness of regional tourism cooperation mechanisms and government policies, which is crucial for the sustainability and good governance of regional tourism."

Secondary infertility is particularly common, defined as the inability of a woman to conceive for at least one year following a full-term pregnancy. We describe a prospective study conducted in Cameroon designed to test the hypothesis of an association between common treatable sexually transmitted infections (STI): Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), Mycoplasma genitalium (MG), and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) and secondary infertility in women.In this case-control study, we enrolled women in Fako Division, Cameroon between November 2017 and December 2018 with secondary infertility (cases) or current pregnancy (controls). We conducted a baseline survey to collect sociodemographic, and sexual and medical history information. Nucleic acid amplification testing using Aptima (Hologic, San Diego, CA, US) was performed on endocervical swabs for CT, NG, MG, and TV. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between active STI and secondary infertility.A total of 416 women were enrolled: 151 cases and 265 controls. Compared to controls, cases were older (median age 32 vs 27 years) and had more lifetime sexual partners (median 4 vs 3) (p<0.001). Cases were more likely to report dyspareunia, abnormal menses, prior miscarriage, and ectopic pregnancy (all p<0.05). STI positivity was not significantly different among cases and controls (2.7% vs 5.4% for CT, 1.3% vs 2.9% for NG, 6.0% vs 7.0% for MG, respectively), with the exception of TV which was more common in pregnant controls (0.7% vs 5%; p = 0.02).Study findings did not support an association between active STI and secondary infertility in Cameroon. Given high rates of pre-existing tubal damage, routine STI screening and treatment in younger women may be more impactful than costly STI testing during infertility assessments."
https://openalex.org/W4210726041,"Childhood undernutrition is a major health burden worldwide that increases childhood morbidity and mortality and causes impairment in infant growth and developmental delays that can persist into adulthood. The first weeks and months after birth are critical to the establishment of healthy growth and development during childhood. The World Health Organization recommends immediate and exclusive breastfeeding (EBF). In infants for whom EBF may not meet nutritional and caloric demands, early, daily, small-volume formula supplementation along with breastfeeding may more effectively avoid underweight wasting and stunting in early infancy than breastfeeding alone. The primary objective of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the efficacy of formula for 30 days among low birth weight (LBW) infants <6 hours of age and those not LBW with weights <2600 grams at 4 days of age. We will compare breastfeeding and formula (up to 59 milliliters administered daily) through 30 days of infant age vs recommendations for frequent EBF without supplementation, and test the hypothesis that formula increases weight-for-age z-score at 30 days of infant age. The trial will enroll and randomize 324 mother-infant pairs in Guinea-Bissau and Uganda, and follow them for 6 months for outcomes including growth, intestinal microbiota, breastfeeding duration, infant dietary intake, and adverse events. Conservatively estimating 20% loss to follow up, this sample size provides ≥80% power per weight stratum for intervention group comparison to detect a difference of 0.20 with respect to the outcome of WAZ at day 30.

Further medical information was obtained by a standardized questionnaire. Multivariable conditional logistic regression model was used.7760 patients with STEC infection were registered in the NESID. 182 patients with HUS and 910 matched controls without HUS were selected. 90 patients with HUS (68 children and 22 adults) and 371 patients without HUS (266 children and 105 adults) were included in the main analysis. The matched ORs of any antibiotics and fosfomycin for HUS in children were 0.56 (95% CI 0.32-0.98), 0.58 (0.34-1.01). The matched ORs for HUS were 2.07 (1.07-4.03), 0.86 (0.46-1.61) in all ages treated with antidiarrheal agent and probiotics.Antibiotics, especially fosfomycin, may prevent the development of HUS in children, while use of antidiarrheal agents should be avoided."
https://openalex.org/W4210787987,"Farmland conversion to forest is considered to be one of the effective measures to mitigate climate change. However, the impact of farmland conversion to forest land or grassland on soil CO2 emission in arid areas is unclear due to the lack of comparative information on soil organic carbon (SOC) mineralization of different conversion types. The SOC mineralization in 0-100 cm soil layer in farmland (FL), abandoned land (AL) and different ages (including 8, 15, 20 and 28 years) of Zanthoxylum bungeanum plantations were measured by laboratory incubation. The size and decomposition rate of fast pool (Cf) and slow pool (Cs) in different land-use types and soil layers were estimated by double exponential model. The results showed that: 1) Farmland conversion increased the cumulative CO2-C release (Cmin) and SOC mineralization efficiency, and those indexes in AL were higher than that in Z. bungeanum plantations. The Cmin and SOC mineralization efficiency of 0-100 cm soil increased with the ages of Z. bungeanum plantation. Both Cmin and SOC mineralization efficiency decreased with the increase of soil depth; 2) Both soil Cf and Cs increased after farmland converted to Z. bungeanum plantations and AL. The Cs in the same soil layer increased with the ages of Z. bungeanum plantation, and the Cf showed a ""V"" type with the increased ages of Z. bungeanum plantation. The Cf and Cs decreased with the increase of soil depth in all land-use types; 3) Farmland conversion increased the decomposition rate of Cf (k1) in all soil layer by 0.008-0.143 d-1 and 0.082-0.148 d-1 in Z. bungeanum plantations and AL, respectively. The k1 was obviously higher in the 0-20 cm soil layer than that in other soil layers, while the decomposition rate of Cs (k2) was not affected by FL conversion and soil depth; and 4) The initial soil chemical properties and enzyme activity affected SOC mineralization, especially the concentrations of total organic nitrogen (TON), SOC, easily oxidizable organic carbon (EOC) and microbial biomass carbon (MBC). It indicated that the conversion of farmland to Z. bungeanum plantations and AL increases SOC mineralization, especially in deeper soils, and it increased with the ages. The conversion of farmland to Z. bungeanum plantation is the optimal measure when the potential C sequestration of plant-soil system were taken in consideration."
https://openalex.org/W4210799396,"Background Current tuberculosis treatments leave most patients with bronchiectasis and fibrosis, permanent conditions that impair lung function and increase all-cause post-TB mortality. Host-directed therapies (HDTs) may reduce lung inflammation and hasten eradication of infection. Biomarkers can accelerate tuberculosis regimen development, but no studies have yet examined early biomarkers of TB-HDTs. Methods Biomarkers of inflammation and microbicidal activity were evaluated as a part of a recent phase-2 randomized controlled trial of four HDTs in 200 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and baseline predictors of poor outcome, including CC-11050 (PDE4i), everolimus (mTORi), auranofin (oral gold salt), and ergocalciferol (vitamin D). Two of the 4 arms (CC-11050 and everolimus) showed superior recovery of lung function at day 180 compared to control; none showed accelerated eradication of MTB infection. Patients underwent 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) on entry and day 56. PET signals were analyzed according to total, maximal, and peak glycolytic activity; CT was analyzed according to total modified Hounsfield units to assess radiodensity. Mycobactericidal activity in ex vivo whole blood culture was measured on days 42, 84, and 140. C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured at multiple time points. Results All PET/CT parameters showed highly significant reductions from baseline to day 56; however, only maximal or peak glycolytic activity showed further experimental reduction compared to controls, and only in everolimus recipients. CRP dropped precipitously during early treatment, but did so equally in all arms; over the entire period of treatment, the rate of decline of CRP tended to be greater in CC-11050 recipients than in controls but this fell short of statistical significance. Whole blood mycobactericidal activity in ex-vivo culture was enhanced by auranofin compared to controls, but not by other HDTs. Conclusions None of these early biomarkers correctly predicted HDT effects on inflammation or infection across all four experimental arms. Instead, they each appear to show highly specific responses related to HDT mechanisms of action."

The experimental group will receive neural mobilisation techniques and soft tissue mobilisation techniques for 30 minutes per session, 10 weekly sessions, plus advice to stay active on their activities of daily living, information on physical activity, imaging tests, and sciatica for 5 biweekly sessions lasting 25-30 minutes. The control group will receive advice to stay active only. The re-evaluation will be performed out after 5 weeks, 10 weeks, and 26 weeks after randomisation and primary endpoints will be pain intensity and functional limitation at 10 weeks. Secondary outcomes will include neuropathic symptoms, sciatic neurodynamic, pain modulation, and psychosocial factors. Adverse events and patient satisfaction will be assessed. Ethical approval has been granted from an Institutional Human Research Ethics Committee. Trial registration: Trial was prospectively registered in the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials (number: RBR-3db643c)."
https://openalex.org/W4210552406,"To quantify changes in corneal densitometry after long-term orthokeratology treatment in myopic children and to analyze the reversibility one month after discontinuation.Seventy-four myopic subjects aged 8-16 years, who wore orthokeratology lenses for two years, were divided into relatively steep- (lens movement within 1.0-1.5 mm, thirty-six participants) and flat-fitting groups (lens movement within 1.5-2.0 mm, thirty-eight participants). Based on refractive errors, they were divided into low and moderate myopia groups (thirty-seven participants in each group). Corneal densitometry was performed using Pentacam (Oculus Optikgeräte GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) at each follow-up timepoint. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to compare the parameters before and after orthokeratology.The corneal densitometry values over the 0-10 mm diameter area increased from 12.84±1.38 grayscale units (GSU) at baseline to 13.59±1.42 GSU after three-month orthokeratology (P = .001) and reached 14.92±1.45 GSU at two years (P < .001). An increase in densitometry began at one month (P = .001) over the 0-2 mm annulus compared with that at three months over the 2-6 mm and 6-10 mm zones (P = .002,.014). The densitometry values significantly increased at three months in the relatively steep-fitting group (P = .003) and at one year in the relatively flat-fitting group (P = .001). After discontinuation of orthokeratology for one month, the values showed no significant decrease.Long-term orthokeratology treatment causes a small but statistically significant increase in corneal densitometry values. During the first year, the onset of these changes was related to the fitting mode. Corneal densitometry values showed no significant reduction after one-month discontinuation."
https://openalex.org/W4210557506,"Madagascar is a large island to the south-east of Africa and in many ways continental in size and ecological complexity. Here we aim to define how skull morphology of an endemic and monophyletic clade of rodents (sub-family Nesomyinae), that show considerable morphological variation, have evolved and how their disparity is characterized in context of the geographical and ecological complexity of the island. We performed a two-dimensional geometric morphometric analysis on 370 dorsal and 399 ventral skull images of 19 species (comprising all nine extant endemic genera) and tested the influence of three ecological parameters (climate, locomotor habitat and nychthemeral cycle) in a phylogenetic context on size and shape. The results indicate that skull shape appears to importantly reflect phylogeny, whereas skull size does not carry a significant phylogenetic signal. Skull shape is significantly influenced by climate while, skull size is not impacted by any of the ecological factors tested, which is controversial to expectations in an insular context. In conclusion, Nesomyinae must have evolved under unusual types of local constraints, preventing this radiation from demonstrating strong ecological release."
https://openalex.org/W4210604398,"The objective of this exploratory research is to study the impact of holding a tennis racket while propelling a wheelchair on kinetic and temporal parameters in a field-based environment. 13 experienced wheelchair tennis players with disabilities (36.1 ± 8.2 years, 76.8 ± 15.3 kg, 174.8 ± 17.1 cm) classified between 30/8 and first series performed two 20 m sprints in a straight line, on a tennis court: one while holding a tennis racket and the second without a tennis racket. They used their own sports wheelchair. Potential participants were excluded if they had injuries or pain that impaired propulsion. Maximal total force, maximal propulsive moment, rate of rise, maximal power output, push and cycle times and maximal velocity were measured. Sprinting while holding a tennis racket increased the cycle time by 0,051 s and push time by 0,011s. Sprinting while holding a tennis racket decreased the maximal propulsive moment, maximal power output, rate of rise and maximal velocity during propulsion by 6.713 N/m, 151.108 W, 672.500 N/s and 0.429 m/s, respectively. Our results suggest that the biomechanical changes observed associated with racket propulsion are generally in a direction that would be beneficial for the risk of injury. But sprinting holding a racket seems to decrease players propulsion performance. Working on forward accelerations with a tennis racket would be a line of work for coaches."
https://openalex.org/W4210640598,"Despite increasing attention in the cardiac anesthesiology literature, continuous measurement of right ventricular pressure using a pulmonary artery catheter has not been described in orthotopic liver transplantation, despite similarities in the anesthetic approach to the two populations. We describe our preliminary experience with this technique in orthotopic liver transplantation, and by combining various derived measures with trans-esophageal echocardiography, make some early observations regarding the response of these measures of right ventricular function during the procedure.In this case series, ten patients (five men and five women) undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation in our institution had their surgeries performed while monitored with a pulmonary artery catheter with continuous right ventricular port transduction and trans-esophageal echocardiography. We recorded various right ventricular waveform (early-to-end diastolic pressure difference, right ventricular outflow tract gradient, right ventricular dP/dT and right ventricular end-diastolic pressure) and echocardiographic (right ventricular fractional area change, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, right ventricular lateral wall strain) and described their change relative to baseline at timepoints five minutes before and after portal vein reperfusion, immediately after hepatic artery reperfusion and on abdominal closure.Except for tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion at five minutes prior to reperfusion (mean -0.8 cm; 95% CI-1.4, -0.3; p = 0.007), no echocardiographic metric was statistically significantly different at any timepoint relative to baseline. In contrast, changes in right ventricular outflow tract gradient and right ventricular dP/dt were highly significant at multiple timepoints, generally peaking immediately before or after reperfusion before reducing, but not returning to baseline in the neohepatic phase. Nine of 10 participants in this series demonstrated a degree of dynamic right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, which met criteria for hemodynamic significance (> 25 mmHg) in two participants. These changes were not materially affected by cardiac index.Dynamic right ventricular outflow tract obstruction of varying severity appears common in patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation. These results are hypothesis generating and will form the basis of future prospective research."
https://openalex.org/W4210776497,"We examined the potential roles of the athlete's performance passport (APP) for doping detection by analyzing the relationship between weightlifting performance and sanction status. For the present study, performance data of 'not-sanctioned' (26740 datasets) and 'sanctioned' (289 datasets) male athletes were acquired from the website of the International Weightlifting Federation (www.iwf.net). One-way ANOVA, correlation analysis, and t-tests were used to analyze the relationship between athletes' use of doping and their performances across age and body weight. Athletic performance was significantly greater for athletes in the sanctioned group than those of the same age group who were not sanctioned, and this performance difference between the two groups was the greatest in their late thirties at 20.6% (not-sanctioned 292.0kg vs. sanctioned 352.3kg) (p < 0.05). From the age group analysis, out of 289 sanctioned cases, 84 cases, which was the largest proportion, were found within the top 10-25% of their performances. When stratified by body weight, athletic performance was significantly greater for the sanctioned group than the not-sanctioned group, and this performance gap was the greatest in the bodyweight category of 96 at 18.6% (not-sanctioned 310.1kg vs. sanctioned 367.8kg) (p < 0.05). From the body weight category analysis, out of 289 sanctioned cases, 75 cases, which was the largest proportion, were found within the top 10-25% of their performances. Additionally, the mean difference in performance between not-sanctioned and sanctioned groups was the largest in the body weight category of 67kg in the ages of 15-19 at 20% (not-sanctioned 234.6kg vs. sanctioned 281.5kg). These results are interpreted to mean that in male weightlifters 1) sanctioned athletes were detected in all ranges of performances regardless of age and body weight, 2) there were even higher rates of sanctioned athletes who performed within the top 10-25% of each age group and body weight category, 3) there were significant differences in performance between not-sanctioned and sanctioned group for all body weight categories, excluding +109, in the ages of 15-19 and 20-24, 4) therefore, performance data can be effectively used to better target suspected athletes for doping testing."
https://openalex.org/W4210790328,"Switzerland experiences one of the highest caesarean section rates in Europe but it is unclear why and when the decision is made to perform a caesarean section. Many studies have examined from a medical and physiological point of view, but research from a women's standpoint is lacking. Our aim was to develop a model of the emerging expectations of giving birth and the subsequent experiences of healthy primigravid women, across four cantons in Switzerland. This longitudinal study included 30 primigravidae from the German speaking, 14 from the French speaking and 14 from the Italian speaking cantons who were purposively selected. Data were collected by semi-structured interviews taking place around 22 and 36 weeks of pregnancy and six weeks and six months postnatally. Following Gadamer's hermeneutic, which in this study comprised 5 stages, a model was developed. Four major themes emerged: Decisions, Care, Influences and Emotions. Their meandering paths and evolution demonstrate the complexity of the expectations and experiences of women becoming mothers. In this study, women's narrated mode of birth expectations did not foretell how they gave birth and their lived experiences. A hermeneutic discontinuity arises at the 6 week postnatal interview mark. This temporary gap illustrates the bridge between women's expectations of birth and their actual lived experiences, highlighting the importance of informed consent, parent education and ensuring women have a positive birth and immediate postnatal experiences. Other factors than women's preferences should be considered to explain the increasing caesarean section rates."
