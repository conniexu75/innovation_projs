https://openalex.org/W2103594871,"Cortical long-term plasticity depends on firing rate, spike timing, and cooperativity among inputs, but how these factors interact during realistic patterns of activity is unknown. Here we monitored plasticity while systematically varying the rate, spike timing, and number of coincident afferents. These experiments demonstrate a novel form of cooperativity operating even when postsynaptic firing is evoked by current injection, and reveal a complex dependence of LTP and LTD on rate and timing. Based on these data, we constructed and tested three quantitative models of cortical plasticity. One of these models, in which spike-timing relationships causing LTP ""win"" out over those favoring LTD, closely fits the data and accurately predicts the build-up of plasticity during random firing. This provides a quantitative framework for predicting the impact of in vivo firing patterns on synaptic strength."
https://openalex.org/W2036950925,"Growth cones contain mRNAs, translation machinery, and, as we report here, protein degradation machinery. We show that isolated retinal growth cones immediately lose their ability to turn in a chemotropic gradient of netrin-1 or Sema3A when translation is inhibited. Translation inhibition also prevents Sema3A-induced collapse, while LPA-induced collapse is not affected. Inhibition of proteasome function blocks responses to netrin-1 and LPA but does not affect Sema3A responses. We further demonstrate in isolated growth cones that netrin-1 and Sema3A activate translation initiation factors and stimulate a marked rise in protein synthesis within minutes, while netrin-1 and LPA elicit similar rises in ubiquitin-protein conjugates. These results suggest that guidance molecules steer axon growth by triggering rapid local changes in protein levels in growth cones."
https://openalex.org/W2047283239,"Cation channels in the DEG/ENaC family are proposed to detect cutaneous stimuli in mammals. We localized one such channel, DRASIC, in several different specialized sensory nerve endings of skin, suggesting it might participate in mechanosensation and/or acid-evoked nociception. Disrupting the mouse DRASIC gene altered sensory transduction in specific and distinct ways. Loss of DRASIC increased the sensitivity of mechanoreceptors detecting light touch, but it reduced the sensitivity of a mechanoreceptor responding to noxious pinch and decreased the response of acid- and noxious heat-sensitive nociceptors. The data suggest that DRASIC subunits participate in heteromultimeric channel complexes in sensory neurons. Moreover, in different cellular contexts, DRASIC may respond to mechanical stimuli or to low pH to mediate normal touch and pain sensation."
https://openalex.org/W2094337062,"Synaptotagmin 1 probably functions as a Ca2+ sensor in neurotransmitter release via its two C2-domains, but no common Ca2+-dependent activity that could underlie a cooperative action between them has been described. The NMR structure of the C2B-domain now reveals a beta sandwich that exhibits striking similarities and differences with the C2A-domain. Whereas the bottom face of the C2B-domain has two additional alpha helices that may be involved in specialized Ca2+-independent functions, the top face binds two Ca2+ ions and is remarkably similar to the C2A-domain. Consistent with these results, but in contrast to previous studies, we find that the C2B-domain binds phospholipids in a Ca2+-dependent manner similarly to the C2A-domain. These results suggest a novel view of synaptotagmin function whereby the two C2-domains cooperate in a common activity, Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding, to trigger neurotransmitter release."
https://openalex.org/W2069508460,"The serine-threonine kinase Akt exerts its anti-apoptotic effects through several downstream targets, including the pro-apoptotic Bc1-2 family member Bad, Forkhead transcription factors, and the cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB). In this report we demonstrate that Akt inhibits a conformational change in the pro-apoptotic Bax protein and its translocation to mitochondria, thus preventing the disruption of the mitochondrial inner membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)), caspase-3 activation, and apoptosis in pre-B hematopoietic cells FL5.12 following interleukin-3 (IL-3) withdrawal. Inhibition of PI-3 kinase, but not MAPK kinase, promotes this conformational change in Bax. Moreover, overexpression of Akt suppresses the relocalization of GFP-Bax to mitochondria and apoptosis in Hela cells induced by the DNA-damaging agent methyl methanesulphonate. However, Akt does not abolish the ability of a conformationally changed Bax mutant, GFP-Bax (DeltaS184), to translocate to mitochondria and to induce apoptosis. These findings indicate that Akt exerts its anti-apoptotic effects in cells at a premitochondrial stage, at least in part, by inhibiting Bax conformational change and its redistribution to the mitochondrial membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1963580947,"In many synapses, depletion and recruitment of releasable synaptic vesicles contribute to use-dependent synaptic depression and recovery. Recently it has been shown that high-frequency presynaptic stimulation enhances recovery from depression, which may be mediated by Ca2+. We addressed this issue by measuring quantal release rates at the calyx of Held synapse and found that transmission is mediated by a heterogeneous population of vesicles, with one subset releasing rapidly and recovering slowly and another one releasing reluctantly and recovering rapidly. Ca2+ promotes refilling of the rapidly releasing synaptic vesicle pool and calmodulin inhibitors block this effect. We propose that calmodulin-dependent refilling supports recovery from synaptic depression during high-frequency trains in concert with rapid recovery of the slowly releasing vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W2153667098,"Subclasses of motor neurons are generated at different positions along the rostrocaudal axis of the spinal cord. One feature of the rostrocaudal organization of spinal motor neurons is a position-dependent expression of Hox genes, but little is known about how this aspect of motor neuron subtype identity is assigned. We have used the expression profile of Hox-c proteins to define the source and identity of patterning signals that impose motor neuron positional identity along the rostrocaudal axis of the spinal cord. We provide evidence that the convergent activities of FGFs, Gdf11, and retinoid signals originating from Hensen's node and paraxial mesoderm establish and refine the Hox-c positional identity of motor neurons in the developing spinal cord."
https://openalex.org/W1999966549,"Members of the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases control many aspects of cellular interactions during development, including axon guidance. Here, we demonstrate that EphB2 also regulates postnatal synaptic function in the mammalian CNS. Mice lacking the EphB2 intracellular kinase domain showed wild-type levels of LTP, whereas mice lacking the entire EphB2 receptor had reduced LTP at hippocampal CA1 and dentate gyrus synapses. Synaptic NMDA-mediated current was reduced in dentate granule neurons in EphB2 null mice, as was synaptically localized NR1 as revealed by immunogold localization. Finally, we show that EphB2 is upregulated in hippocampal pyramidal neurons in vitro and in vivo by stimuli known to induce changes in synaptic structure. Together, these data demonstrate that EphB2 plays an important role in regulating synaptic function."
https://openalex.org/W1973629131,"During development, Eph receptors mediate the repulsive axon guidance function of ephrins, a family of membrane attached ligands with their own receptor-like signaling potential. In cultured glutamatergic neurons, EphB2 receptors were recently shown to associate with NMDA receptors at synaptic sites and were suggested to play a role in synaptogenesis. Here we show that Eph receptor stimulation in cultured neurons modulates signaling pathways implicated in synaptic plasticity, suggesting cross-talk with NMDA receptor-activated pathways. Mice lacking EphB2 have normal hippocampal synapse morphology, but display defects in synaptic plasticity. In EphB2(-/-) hippocampal slices, protein synthesis-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) was impaired, and two forms of synaptic depression were completely extinguished. Interestingly, targeted expression of a carboxy-terminally truncated form of EphB2 rescued the EphB2 null phenotype, indicating that EphB2 kinase signaling is not required for these EphB2-mediated functions."
https://openalex.org/W2093660899,"A proton pump acidifies synaptic vesicles and provides the electrochemical gradient for transmitter uptake. Although external protons can modulate membrane voltage- and ligand-gated conductances, the fate of the protons released when vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane is unclear. In the dark, the glutamate-laden vesicles of cone photoreceptors fuse continuously with the plasma membrane. I now show that vesicular protons feed back to block the nearby calcium channels that mediate release. This local proton-mediated feedback is a novel mechanism through which neurons may regulate the release of transmitter."

https://openalex.org/W1985405412,"We investigated the role of postsynaptic protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) in regulating synaptic strength by loading CA1 pyramidal cells either with peptides that disrupt PP1 binding to synaptic targeting proteins or with active PP1. The peptides blocked synaptically evoked LTD but had no effect on basal synaptic currents mediated by either AMPA or NMDA receptors. They did, however, cause an increase in synaptic strength following the induction of LTD. Similarly, PP1 had no effect on basal synaptic strength but enhanced LTD. In cultured neurons, synaptic activation of NMDA receptors increased the proportion of PP1 localized to synapses. These results suggest that PP1 does not significantly regulate basal synaptic strength. Appropriate NMDA receptor activation, however, allows PP1 to gain access to synaptic substrates and be recruited to synapses where its activity is necessary for sustaining LTD."
https://openalex.org/W2150321010,"To define the relationship between glomerular activation patterns and neuronal olfactory responses in the main olfactory bulb, intracellular recordings were combined with optical imaging of intrinsic signals. Response correlation maps (RCMs) were constructed by correlating the fluctuations in membrane potential and firing rate during odorant presentations with patterns of glomerular activation. The RCMs indicated that mitral/tufted cells were excited by activation of a focal region surrounding their principal glomerulus and generally inhibited by activation of more distant regions. However, the structure of the RCMs and the relative contribution of excitatory and inhibitory glomerular input evolved and even changed sign during and after odorant application. These data suggest a dynamic center-surround organization of mitral/tufted cell receptive fields."
https://openalex.org/W1969876249,"Triptolide, a major component in the extract of Chinese herbal plant Tripterygium wilfordii Hook f (TWHf), has potential anti-neoplastic effect. In the present study we investigated the potential therapeutic effects and mechanisms of triptolide against human gastric cancer cells. Four gastric cancer cell lines with different p53 status, AGS and MKN-45 (wild type p53); MKN-28 and SGC-7901 (mutant p53) were observed as to cell growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis in response to triptolide treatment. We showed that triptolide inhibited cell growth, induced apoptosis and suppressed NK-kappaB and AP-1 transactivation in AGS cells with wild-type p53. Triptolide induced apoptosis by stimulating the expressions of p53, p21(waf1/cip1), bax protein, and increased the activity of caspases. In addition, it caused cell cycle arrest in the G(0)/G(1) phase. To examine the role of p53 in these functions, we showed that suppression of p53 level with antisense oligonucleotide abrogated triptolide-induced apoptosis and over-expression of dominant negative p53 abolished the inhibitory effect on NF-kappaB activation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that triptolide had differential effects on gastric cancer cells with different p53 status. We showed that triptolide also inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in MKN-45 with wild-type p53, whereas it had no significant growth-inhibition and apoptosis induction effects on the MKN-28 and SGC-7901 cells with mutant p53. Our data suggest that triptolide exhibits anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting cell proliferation, inducing apoptosis and inhibiting NF-kappaB and AP-1 transcriptional activity. However, a functional p53 is required for these proapoptotic, anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor effects."
https://openalex.org/W2034584551,"Treatment of SENCAR mouse skin with dibenzo[a,l]pyrene results in abundant formation of abasic sites that undergo error-prone excision repair, forming oncogenic H-ras mutations in the early preneoplastic period. To examine whether the abundance of abasic sites causes repair infidelity, we treated SENCAR mouse skin with estradiol-3,4-quinone (E(2)-3,4-Q) and determined adduct levels 1 h after treatment, as well as mutation spectra in the H-ras gene between 6 h and 3 days after treatment. E(2)-3,4-Q formed predominantly (> or =99%) the rapidly-depurinating 4-hydroxy estradiol (4-OHE(2))-1-N3Ade adduct and the slower-depurinating 4-OHE(2)-1-N7Gua adduct. Between 6 h and 3 days, E(2)-3,4-Q induced abundant A to G mutations in H-ras DNA, frequently in the context of a 3'-G residue. Using a T.G-DNA glycosylase (TDG)-PCR assay, we determined that the early A to G mutations (6 and 12 h) were in the form of G.T heteroduplexes, suggesting misrepair at A-specific depurination sites. Since G-specific mutations were infrequent in the spectra, it appears that the slow rate of depurination of the N7Gua adducts during active repair may not generate a threshold level of G-specific abasic sites to affect repair fidelity. These results also suggest that E(2)-3,4-Q, a suspected endogenous carcinogen, is a genotoxic compound and could cause mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2333862858,"Tumor promoters are non-mutagenic chemicals which increase the probability of cancer by accelerating the clonal expansion of cells transformed during tumor initiation. Phenobarbital (PB) is an antiepileptic drug which promotes hepatocarcinogenesis in rodents when administered subsequent to an initiating carcinogen like diethylnitrosamine (DEN). Here we have investigated the prevalence and patterns of mutations in two genes, Ha-ras and β-catenin, both known mutational targets in mouse hepatocarcinogenesis. Liver tumors were generated by a single administration of DEN to 6 week old mice followed by feeding of PB (0.05%) containing or control diet for 39 weeks. Mutations at Ha-ras codon 61 were screened by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization; β-catenin mutations were detected by direct sequencing of PCR products spanning exon 2. In tumors from mice treated with DEN alone, the prevalence of Ha-ras mutations was ∼30% (6/20), while no β-catenin mutations (0/13) were detectable in tumors of this treatment group. By contrast, Ha-ras mutations were undetectable in tumors from mice treated with DEN/PB (0/32), while ∼80% (37/46) of tumors from this group showed β-catenin mutations. These results demonstrate that PB strongly affects the prevalence of mutations in the two cancer-related genes, presumably by positive and negative selection for cells harboring the respective mutation."
https://openalex.org/W1976961529,"Signaling between osteoblasts and osteoclasts is important in bone homeostasis. We previously showed that human osteoblasts propagate intercellular calcium signals via two mechanisms: autocrine activation of P2Y receptors, and gap junctional communication. In the current work we identified mechanically induced intercellular calcium signaling between osteoblasts and osteoclasts and among osteoclasts. Intercellular calcium responses in osteoclasts required P2 receptor activation but not gap junctional communication. Pharmacological studies and reverse transcriptase-PCR amplification demonstrated that human osteoclasts expressed functional P2Y1 receptors, but, unexpectedly, desensitization of P2Y1 did not block calcium signaling to osteoclasts. We also found that osteoclasts expressed functional P2X7 receptors and showed that pharmacological inhibition of these receptors blocked calcium signaling to osteoclasts. Thus these studies show that calcium signaling between osteoblasts and osteoclasts occurs via activation of P2 receptors, but that different families of P2 receptors are required for calcium signaling in these two cell types. Intercellular calcium signaling among bone cells is therefore amenable to pharmacological manipulation that will specifically affect only bone-forming or bone-resorbing cells. P2 receptors may be important drug targets for the modulation of bone turnover. Signaling between osteoblasts and osteoclasts is important in bone homeostasis.

Intercellular calcium signaling among bone cells is therefore amenable to pharmacological manipulation that will specifically affect only bone-forming or bone-resorbing cells. P2 receptors may be important drug targets for the modulation of bone turnover. Osteoclasts are the cells responsible for bone resorption, whereas osteoblasts deposit new bone throughout a lifetime. Bone resorption and formation are coordinated, and in adult life are maintained in a balance, so that no significant bone loss occurs. In later life, especially in women after menopause, osteoclast activity is increased relative to osteoblast activity, and this unbalanced cellular activity causes increased relative bone resorption, and in turn, bone loss and osteoporosis. Both endocrine and paracrine factors modulate osteoclast activity, including calciotropic, growth, sex, and adrenal hormones as well as cytokines, growth factors, electrolytes, and mechanical forces. Most of these paracrine and endocrine factors affect osteoclast activity indirectly, acting on osteoblasts. Thus, bone-resorptive signals must be transmitted from osteoblasts to osteoclasts via mechanisms of cell-to-cell communication between the two lineages. We have previously shown that mechanical stimulation of human osteoblasts in vitro generates a calcium signal that is communicated to other osteoblasts (1Jorgensen N.R. Geist S.T. Civitelli R. Steinberg T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 2Jorgensen N.R. Henriksen Z. Brot C. Eriksen E.F. Sorensen O.H. Civitelli R. Steinberg T.H. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 1024-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The propagation of this signal involves two different mechanisms. One is the autocrine action of ATP on plasma membrane purinergic receptors of the P2Y subtype, and the other involves the passage of a soluble messenger through gap junctions, leading to influx of extracellular calcium. Recent studies have revealed the presence of nucleotide receptors in osteoclasts. 1Naemsch, L. N., Dixon, S. J., and Sims, S. M. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 39107–39114 1Naemsch, L. N., Dixon, S. J., and Sims, S. M. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 39107–39114 ATP can act on two different classes of receptors. The P2Y receptors are G-protein-coupled and stimulate phospholipases, subsequently activating the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate pathway releasing calcium from intracellular stores. Members of the P2X family are non-selective cation channels permeable to Na+, K+, Ca2+, and H+. Receptors from both classes have been identified on bone-resorbing cells (3Weidema A.F. Barbera J. Dixon S.J. Sims S.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 503: 303-315Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 4Wiebe S.H. Sims S.M. Dixon S.J. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 1999; 9: 323-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), as determined both by pharmacological profiles and effector functions. Thus, ATP induces both a non-selective cation current (P2X-mediated) and release of calcium from intracellular stores (P2Y-mediated) (3Weidema A.F. Barbera J. Dixon S.J. Sims S.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 503: 303-315Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar).

Bone. 1998; 22: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Other investigators have identified nucleotide-mediated responses in osteoclastic cells. ATP has been shown to cause a transient decrease in intracellular pH, possibly related to activation of P2X cation channels (7Yu H. Ferrier J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3051-3058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This response might favor formation of osteoclastic resorption pits and increased bone resorption. Supporting this hypothesis, ATP induces osteoclast activation and resorption in rat osteoclasts (8Morrison M.S. Turin L. King B.F. Burnstock G. Arnett T.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 511: 495-500Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and in giant cells from human osteoclastoma (6Bowler W.B. Littlewood E.A. Bilbe G. Gallagher J.A. Dixon C.J. Bone. 1998; 22: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The effect on osteoclast formation is, however, biphasic, because low concentrations increase osteoclast formation while high concentrations decrease mouse osteoclast formation (8Morrison M.S.

This intercellular signal propagation might represent a mechanism by which signals initiated by mechanical stimulation of bone cells, primarily osteocytes, are diffused through the bone tissue to surface osteoblasts and in turn to osteoclasts, thus regulating bone remodeling. We report herein that a calcium signal can be communicated from osteoblasts to osteoclasts and among osteoclasts. Whereas calcium signals among osteoblasts involve activation of P2Y receptors, we found unexpectedly that P2X nucleotide receptors, probably of the P2X7 subtype, are required for osteoclast calcium signals activation. Human bone marrow (5–10 ml) was obtained from healthy volunteers (aged 20–34) by puncture of the posterior iliac spine. The marrow material was collected in a 50-ml tube, containing 15 ml of heparinized (100 units/ml) minimum essential medium. The mononuclear fraction of the cells was then isolated by centrifugation on a Lymphoprep gradient. The cells were plated in T-75 culture flasks with 10 × 106 cells/flask in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with glutamine (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY)) and 30% horse serum (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). The culture was incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 37 °C. The following day, to separate adherent and non-adherent cell populations, the medium was collected, flushing the bottom of the flask a couple of times. The adherent cell population was transferred to minimum essential medium and 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and maintained by completely changing the medium once a week. After 3–4 weeks of culture, the osteoblastic cells reached 80% confluence and were used to co-culture with the tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive giant cells (osteoclastic cells). The non-adherent cells were counted, and 5% osteoblastic cells were added to the cell suspension. The cells were then replated in 6-well plates, each well containing a 25-mm no. 1 glass coverslip, at 2 × 106 osteoclastic cells/well. The co-culture was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with glutamine (Invitrogen) and 30% horse serum (Sigma). Initially and at every medium change 10−8m1,25(OH)2 vitamin-D3 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added to the medium. After 2–3 weeks, multinucleated cells started to appear, and the co-cultures were ready for video imaging experiments. The day before experiments were performed, the co-culture was washed twice with PBS to remove the non-adherent cells. The methods for obtaining osteoblastic and osteoclastic cells in human bone marrow co-cultures have been described previously (9Kassem M. Risteli L. Mosekilde L. Melsen F. Eriksen E.F. APMIS. 1991; 99: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 10Kassem M. Mosekilde L. Rungby J. Melsen F. Eriksen E.F. APMIS. 1991; 99: 262-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These methods allow the production of cells of both (a) osteoblastic cells, as demonstrated by high alkaline phosphatase activity, secretion of osteocalcin, production of procollagen type I, presence of parathyroidhormone receptors, and ability to produce mineralized matrix in the presence of β-glycerophosphate and ascorbic acid (9Kassem M. Risteli L. Mosekilde L. Melsen F. Eriksen E.F. APMIS. 1991; 99: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 11Kassem M. APMIS Suppl. 1997; 71: 1-30PubMed Google Scholar, 12Rickard D.J.

Osteoclasts for RNA extraction were isolated from human bone marrow as described above, but instead of co-culturing with osteoblastic cells, the non-adherent cells were plated in 6-cm plates and maintained in minimum essential medium and 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) supplemented with 200 ng/ml human macrophage-colony stimulating factor (R&D Systems) and 20 ng/ml human RANKL (PeproTech), to promote osteoclast differentiation and maturation. A similar method has been shown to be able to produce osteoclasts from human peripheral blood (13Matsuzaki K. Udagawa N. Takahashi N. Yamaguchi K. Yasuda H. Shima N. Morinaga T. Toyama Y. Yabe Y. Higashio K. Suda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 14Quinn J.M. Elliott J. Gillespie M.T. Martin T.J. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4424-4427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This method yields a high number of multinucleated, giant cells that stain positively for TRAP, as shown in Fig.1. The study was approved by the local Ethics Committee, and study participants signed informed consent prior to participation. The fluorescent calcium indicator fura-2 was purchased from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). Thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the calcium-ATPase of the endoplasmic reticulum, was from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA) and was used in a final concentration of 50 nm. The ATP-receptor antagonist suramin was purchased from Research Biochemicals Inc. (Natick, MA), and nucleotides were fromRoche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). All other chemicals were from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). The gap junctional inhibitor heptanol was freshly made each day as a 1:4 heptanol:ethanol solution and used in a final concentration of 3.5 mm. Measurement of the intracellular calcium concentration was done using the calcium indicator dye fura-2. Co-cultures of osteoblastic and osteoclastic cells in monolayers adherent to non-coated glass coverslips were incubated at 37 °C in medium containing 5 μm fura-2/AM for 30 min and then incubated for an additional 20 min in medium without dye. Coverslips were affixed to a Teflon chamber and mounted in a PDMI-2 open perfusion microincubator (Medical Systems Corp., Greenvale, NY) maintained at 37 °C with superfused CO2 on a Zeiss Axiovert 35 inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY). Imaging was performed with the Metamorph/Metafluor system (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA) with excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm for acquiring ratio images of fura-2. Probenecid at a concentration of 1 mm was added throughout the experiment to prevent dye leakage from the cytoplasm of the cells (15Di Virgilio F. Steinberg T.H. Silverstein S.C. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Ratio images were calibrated using buffers of known calcium concentrations (Molecular Probes). Calcium waves were induced by stimulating a single cell with a borosilicate glass micropipette affixed to an Eppendorf 5171 micromanipulator (Eppendorf Inc., Madison, WI). We assessed nucleotide-induced plasma membrane permeabilization by measuring uptake of the membrane-impermeant fluorescent dye Lucifer Yellow (Sigma). Cell monolayers were incubated at 37 °C in medium containing 0.5 mg/ml Lucifer Yellow in the presence of different ATP analogs for 10 min. Thereafter, monolayers were washed with PBS. Cells demonstrating diffuse cytoplasmic staining with Lucifer Yellow were identified by fluorescence microscopy, and images were recorded. Images of the same cells were also recorded by phase contrast microscopy to identify the cell type. Almost pure osteoclast cultures were used as described above. After 2 weeks of culture, total RNA was extracted from the osteoclasts using the RNeasy Mini kit from Qiagen. The RNA was DNase-treated using an RNase-free DNase set also from Qiagen. Reverse transcription was done using the Carboxydothermus hydrogenofomans. Polymerase kit supplied by Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Briefly, cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA, using oligo(dT) primers, and the reaction was incubated for 30 min at 60 °C. PCR was done using the Expand High Fidelity PCR System kit supplied by Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The forward primer used for P2Y1 was 5′-GTGTACATGTTCAATTTGGCTCT and the reverse primer 5′-GTTGAGACTTGCTAGACCTCTTG. The primers used for P2X7 were: forward primer 5′-AGATCGTGGAGAATGGAGTG and reverse primer 5′-TTCTCGTGGTGTAGTTGTGG. All oligonucleotides were synthesized by Invitrogen. The PCR reactions were set up using 5 μl of the cDNA template previously synthesized. The PCR was performed in a PTC-100 programmable thermal controller (MJ Research, Inc.). Initially, the template was denatured for 2 min at 94 °C, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C (P2Y1)/53 °C (P2X7) for 30 s, elongation at 72 °C for 1 min., and ended with a prolonged elongation at 72 °C for 7 min. Finally, the PCR products were separated in a 2% agarose gel, the P2Y1 product at a length of 685 bp and the P2X7 product at a length of 399 bp. Osteoclasts were cultured on glass slides and treated as described above in the RNA extraction section. After 2 weeks of culture, the flask was removed from the slide, and the slide was washed briefly in PBS and then fixed in 70% ethanol for 5 min. Then the cells were incubated for 15 min in TRAP solution (naphthol-as-bi-phosphate,N,N-methylformamid, pararosanilin, sodium nitrite, and tartrate in Michaelis buffer, pH 5.0), washed with tap water, and then counterstained with Meyers hematoxylin for 10 s. Finally, preparations were mounted in aqueous mounting medium. Osteoclasts were cultured on glass slides and treated as described above. They were fixed in ethanol for 10 min and incubated for 15 h with P2X7 receptor antibody, developed in rabbit (Sigma), diluted 1:50 with TBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin. After incubation the slides were washed 3 × 5 min in TBS. Then the cells were incubated for 1 h with a Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch), diluted 1:50 with TBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin. Finally the cells were washed 3 × 5 min in TBS, and preparations were mounted with mounting medium. Observations and images were performed with a Zeiss confocal microscopy system using a 40 × water immersion objective (40/1.2 Zeiss), 4 × zoom, and Cy3 excitation with a 543-nm laser. We have previously shown that human osteoblastic cells can communicate intercellular calcium waves by two mechanisms: one involving autocrine action of ATP and one dependent on gap junctional communication (2Jorgensen N.R. Henriksen Z. Brot C. Eriksen E.F. Sorensen O.H. Civitelli R. Steinberg T.H. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 1024-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In this study, we asked whether the intercellular calcium signal, which can be elicited in osteoblast networks, is also communicated to osteoclasts, the other major cell type effecting bone remodeling. Co-cultures of human osteoblastic and osteoclastic cells were loaded with the calcium indicator fura-2, and a single osteoblastic cell was stimulated mechanically with a glass micropipette. The stimulated cell showed an initial increase in [Ca2+] i, spreading to adjacent osteoblasts and, with a 10- to 15-s time lag, to adjacent osteoclasts (n= 34) (Fig. 2). Interestingly, when one osteoclast was mechanically stimulated, [Ca2+] i rapidly increased in this cell, and a calcium wave was initiated and propagated to adjacent osteoblasts as well as osteoclasts (n = 48 of 52 experiments), in a similar fashion as it occurred with mechanical stimulation of one osteoblast (Fig.3). Hence, intercellular calcium waves can be elicited by mechanical perturbation of either osteoblasts or osteoclasts and can be communicated bi-directionally between cells of the two lineages, as well as among cells of each lineage.Figure 3Intercellular calcium signaling occurs among human osteoclasts cultured with RANKL and M-CSF , as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The numbers on each panel indicate time in seconds after mechanical stimulation.OC, osteoclast; the scale bar shows intracellular calcium concentrations in micromolar.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next asked whether propagation of calcium signals to osteoclasts required either gap junctional communication or activation of P2 receptors. We used the gap junction inhibitor heptanol to test whether gap junctional communication is required for the propagation of osteoclast-initiated calcium waves. First, a single cell in the fura-2 loaded monolayer was mechanically stimulated to confirm the ability of the cells to propagate a calcium signal upon mechanical stimulation. After 5 min incubation with heptanol (3.5 mm), another cell was mechanically stimulated. Despite the inhibition of gap junctional communication, the stimulated osteoclast was still able to initiate a calcium pulse to the neighboring osteoclasts (n = 5) (Fig. 4). Thus, gap junctional communication is not required for the propagation of intercellular calcium signals generated by mechanical perturbation of osteoclasts (Table I).Table IEffect of heptanol and P2 receptor agonists/antagonists on calcium signalingAdditionSignaling to OBSignaling to OCHeptanol-1-aIn a previous study we have performed similar experiments in cultures of human osteoblastic cells, showing that ATP inhibited fast waves, not slow waves.

Numbers indicate the number of experiments in which a fast calcium signaling was transmitted to osteoblasts, or any calcium signaling was transmitted to osteoclasts, per total number of experiments. In similar experiments we used the P2 receptor antagonist suramin to determine whether P2 receptors were required for calcium signal propagation to osteoclasts, because they are in osteoblast-to-osteoblast signaling (2Jorgensen N.R. Henriksen Z. Brot C. Eriksen E.F. Sorensen O.H. Civitelli R. Steinberg T.H. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 1024-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). One single osteoblast in a fura-2-loaded monolayer of an osteoblast-osteoclast co-culture was stimulated mechanically, and a calcium signal was propagated to neighboring osteoblasts and osteoclasts as described above. We then added suramin in a final concentration of 100 μm, and after a short incubation period, we stimulated an osteoblast mechanically. No calcium waves were seen, either to osteoblasts or osteoclasts, in five of six experiments (Table I). Thus, P2 receptors are involved in the propagation of intercellular calcium signals to osteoclasts. Having demonstrated the involvement of a P2Y receptor in osteoclast calcium wave propagation, we next functionally characterized the member of this receptor superfamily that may be present in our human osteoclast preparations, by measuring nucleotide-induced calcium transients in osteoblast-osteoclast monolayers, as summarized in TableII. We have previously shown that UTP and ATP induce increases in [Ca2+] i in human osteoblasts, consistent with the expression of P2Y2 receptors in the osteoblasts.Table IIOsteoblast (OB) and osteoclast (OC) calcium transients in response to nucleotide stimulationNucleotideOB responseOC responseATP++++UTP++−ADP+++BzATP−++oATP + BzATP−− Open table in a new tab Monolayers of osteoblast/osteoclast co-cultures were loaded with fura-2, mounted on the stage of the calcium imaging system, and the effect of different nucleotides on the osteoclastic [Ca2+] i was tested. ATP was able to increase the [Ca2+] i in all experiments (n = 57) at concentrations of 100 μm and 1 mm. Response to ATP stimulation was seen with ATP concentrations down to 1 μm. A maximum increase in [Ca2+] i of 400 nm was seen with a final ATP concentration of 100 μm. The same experiments were performed with ADP, UDP, UTP, and benzoylbenzyl-ATP (BzATP). Neither UDP (100 μm) nor UTP (100 μm) had an effect on the [Ca2+] i in the osteoclasts (n = 5), but UTP resulted in increases in [Ca2+] i in the osteoblasts as expected. The absence of UDP- and UTP-induced calcium transients indicates that the primary human osteoclastic cells lack functional P2Y2, P2Y4, or P2Y6, even though P2Y2 mRNA has been identified in human osteoclasts by other investigators (5Bowler W.B. Birch M.A. Gallagher J.A. Bilbe G. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1995; 10: 1137-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In contrast, ADP (100 μm) increased [Ca2+] i in osteoclastic cells (29 of 31 experiments) (Fig. 5). Based on nucleotide specificity of the different purinergic receptors, this pharmacological profile is most consistent with the presence of functional P2Y1 receptors on these cells. Osteoblasts sometimes exhibited a weak calcium response after addition of ADP, again consistent with P2Y2 expression in these cells. We next confirmed the expression of P2Y1 receptors by RT-PCR amplification of mRNA from human osteoclasts. For these experiments, monocultures of human osteoclasts were produced from human bone marrow mononuclear cells by stimulation with RANKL and M-CSF. RT-PCR using primers specific for the P2Y1 coding sequence and total RNA extracted from isolated osteoclastic cells as a template revealed a clear 685-bp product corresponding to P2Y1 (Fig.6). P2Y receptors, like many other G-protein-coupled receptors, undergo desensitization after ligand binding. Accordingly, we found that a second addition of ADP to osteoclasts was not accompanied by a cytosolic calcium transient (n = 5) (Fig. 5). We used this homologous desensitization to ask whether activation of P2Y receptors on human osteoclasts was required for the propagation of intercellular calcium waves to these cells. After demonstrating the ability to propagate waves from osteoblasts to osteoclasts, we desensitized the osteoclast P2Y1 receptors with ADP and saw an increase in [Ca2+] i . Surprisingly, when another mechanical stimulation was applied, intercellular calcium signaling to osteoclasts was unperturbed by the desensitization (Table I). Thus, although osteoclasts express functional P2Y1 receptors, these receptors were not required for the communication of calcium waves from osteoblasts to osteoclasts. In separate experiments we also used ATP to desensitize P2Y receptors. In all cases both osteoblasts and osteoclasts responded to ATP stimulation with an increase in [Ca2+] i . Subsequent mechanical stimulation of an osteoblast resulted in a calcium transient in the stimulated cell. Whereas intracellular calcium did not increase in neighboring osteoblasts, as expected, neighboring osteoclasts propagated a calcium wave as they did before ATP desensitization (Table I). T"
https://openalex.org/W2073223453,"It is widely accepted that disruption of the hedgehog-patched pathway is a key event in development of basal cell cancer. In addition to patched gene alterations, p53 gene mutations are also frequent in basal cell cancer. We determined loss of heterozygosity in the patched and p53 loci as well as sequencing the p53 gene in tumors both from sporadic and hereditary cases. A total of 70 microdissected samples from tumor and adjacent skin were subjected to PCR followed by fragment analysis and DNA sequencing. We found allelic loss in the patched locus in 6/8 sporadic basal cell cancer and 17/19 hereditary tumors. All sporadic and 7/20 hereditary tumors showed p53 gene mutations. Loss of heterozygosity in the p53 locus was rare in both groups. The p53 mutations detected in hereditary tumors included rare single nucleotide deletions and unusual double-base substitutions compared to the typical ultraviolet light induced missense mutations found in sporadic tumors. Careful microdissection of individual tumors revealed genetically linked subclones with different p53 and/or patched genotype providing an insight on time sequence of genetic events. The high frequency and co-existence of genetic alterations in the patched and p53 genes suggest that both these genes are important in the development of basal cell cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2314144775,"The DEAD box RNA helicase, p68, is upregulated in exponentially growing cells and shows cell cycle-dependent changes in nuclear localization. Although some other DEAD box proteins have been implicated in cancer, there have been no reports of any link between p68 status and carcinogenesis. In the present study we have analysed specimens from 50 patients with colorectal adenocarcinomas, including cases in which an adenomatous polyp was also present, by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Our data indicate that p68 protein is consistently overexpressed in tumours as compared with matched normal tissue. Examination of the levels of p68 mRNA from both normal and tumour tissue showed no obvious specific increase in p68 mRNA levels in tumours nor any evidence of underlying mutations in the p68 coding region. Interestingly, however, the accumulated p68 appears to be poly-ubiquitylated, suggesting a possible defect in proteasome-mediated degradation in these tumours. This overexpression/ubiquitylation is observed in both pre-invasive and invasive lesions suggesting that the dysregulation of p68 expression occurs early during tumour development. Finally, we demonstrate that ubiquitylation of p68 occurs in cultured cells, thereby providing a model for the molecular analysis of this process and its potential role in tumorigenesis."

Blocking Ser-259 dephosphorylation inhibits the two latter events, but it does not prevent activation of a S259A Raf-1 mutant, which is preferentially localized at the membrane independently of mitogenic stimulation. Inhibition of Ser-259 dephosphorylation has no effect on the activation of membrane-tethered Raf-1 (Raf-1CAAX).

Recently, phosphorylation of the activation loop of the kinase at residues Thr-491 and Ser-494 has been shown to be essential for Raf-1 activation by different stimuli (9Chong H. Lee J. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3716-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Three serine residues whose phosphorylation negatively regulates kinase activation have been identified in Raf-1. All three (Ser-43, Ser-621, and Ser-259) are phosphorylated to different degrees in resting fibroblasts (10Morrison D.K. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Copeland T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17309-17316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of S-43 was reported to interfere with Ras binding and consequently with Ras-mediated activation (2Marshall M. Mol. Reprod.

Bivalent binding of 14-3-3 to Ser(P)-259 and Ser(P)-621 has been suggested to maintain Raf-1 in an inactive conformation (14Rommel C. Radziwill G. Lovric J. Noeldeke J. Heinicke T. Jones D. Aitken A.

On the other hand, reversible association with 14-3-3 facilitates Ras-dependent Raf-1 activation in vivo and in vitro (16Roy S. McPherson R.A. Apolloni A. Yan J. Lane A. Clyde-Smith J. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3947-3955Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and binding to the Ser(P)-621 site appears to be necessary for kinase activity (15Tzivion G. Luo Z. Avruch J.

The significance of Ser-621 phosphorylation is still in question and cannot be answered by the investigation of S621A mutants, since this residue cannot be replaced by other amino acids without loss of kinase activity (18Mischak H.

Serine 259 can be phosphorylated by Akt/PKB, and this phosphorylation correlates with the down-regulation of kinase activity (21Zimmermann S. Moelling K. Science. 1999; 286: 1741-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that dephosphorylation of Ser-259 by Raf-1-associated PP2A1 contributes to Raf-1 activation (22Abraham D. Podar K. Pacher M. Kubicek M. Welzel N. Hemmings B.A. Dilworth S.M.

PP2A has been shown to form a complex with a number of kinases, including Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (23Westphal R.S. Anderson K.A. Means A.R. Wadzinski B.E.

Science. 1998; 280: 1258-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), PP2A has been shown to contribute to the inactivation of the associated kinase. Raf-1 represents the first example of a PP2A-associated kinase activated by dephosphorylation. This report focuses on the specific role of Ser-259 dephosphorylation in Raf-1 kinase activation in vivo. It shows that preventing mitogen-induced Ser-259 dephosphorylation results in inefficient accumulation of endogenous as well as overexpressed Raf-1 to the plasma membrane and that both an S259A mutation and artificial tethering of Raf-1 to the membrane bypass the requirement for phosphatase activity. Our results indicate that Ser-259 phosphorylation is involved in the relocation of Raf-1 to the cytosol and that PP2A supports full-fledged Raf-1 activation by dephosphorylating this residue and increasing the efficiency with which Raf-1 is retained at the membrane of mitogen-stimulated cells.

COS cells were transfected by electroporation (0.5–1 × 107 cells/cuvette, 240 V, 960 microfarads, 10 μg of plasmid DNA).

Cells were harvested 2 days after transfection. Under these conditions protein expression increased linearly between 1 and 10 μg of transfected plasmid DNA. Confluent cultures were starved for 18 h before stimulation with recombinant EGF (33 nm, 10 min). In selected experiments, cells were incubated with okadaic acid (100 nm, 45 min) before growth factor stimulation.

After 30 min on ice, cells were homogenized by 30 strokes through a 26-gauge needle. Nuclei were removed by low speed centrifugation. The post nuclear supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 × g. The supernatant (S100) was removed, and the sedimented fraction (P100) was resuspended in resuspension buffer (0.1 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 nm okadaic acid) after washing with phosphate-buffered saline. A rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against a carboxyl-terminal peptide of v-raf (SP63, CTLTTSPRLPVF) was used to immunoprecipitate Raf-1 molecules. A mouse monoclonal antibody against PP2AC (F2 8F5) was used to immunoprecipitate PP2A (22Abraham D. Podar K. Pacher M. Kubicek M. Welzel N. Hemmings B.A. Dilworth S.M. Mischak H. Kolch W.

Immunocomplexes were collected after incubation (1–3 h at 4 °C) with protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) and washed three times with lysis buffer before Western blotting or immune complex kinase assay. For Western blotting, cell lysates (25 μg/lane) or immunoprecipitates were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE before electrophoretic transfer onto Hybond C super (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The blots were probed with monoclonal antibodies against Raf-1 (29Kolch W. Weissinger E. Mischak H. Troppmair J. Showalter S.D. Lloyd P. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 713-720PubMed Google Scholar) or PP2AC (22Abraham D. Podar K. Pacher M. Kubicek M. Welzel N. Hemmings B.A. Dilworth S.M. Mischak H. Kolch W. Baccarini M. J. Biol.

Rabbit polyclonal antisera against Raf-1 phosphopeptides (anti-Ser(P)-259, QRQRSTSpTPNVHC; and anti Ser(P)-621, KINRSASpEPSLHRC, where p is phosphorylated serine) were produced in our lab. Their specificity is shown in Fig. 1 A. The blots were subsequently incubated for 1 h at room temperature with donkey-anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies before exposure to the ECL substrate. All blotting reagents were from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. The blots were stripped according to the manufacturer's instruction. Raf-1 kinase activity was measured as the ability of immunoisolated Raf-1 to activate recombinant MEK-1 (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal regulated-kinase kinase-1) in coupled assays using myelin basic protein as the end point of the assay (30Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Ashworth A. Cowley S. Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that okadaic acid inhibits peak Raf-1 kinase activation by the mitogens CSF-1 and EGF. In the case of EGF, Ser-259 was identified as the site relevant for inhibition (22Abraham D. Podar K. Pacher M. Kubicek M. Welzel N. Hemmings B.A. Dilworth S.M. Mischak H. Kolch W. Baccarini M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22300-22304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Because this residue is constitutively phosphorylated in quiescent cells (10Morrison D.K. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Copeland T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17309-17316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these data predict mitogen-induced dephosphorylation of Ser-259. To test this hypothesis, we determined the effect of EGF stimulation of COS-1 cells expressing wt Raf-1 on the phosphorylation of Ser-259 by immunoblotting with phospho-specific antisera recently produced in our laboratory (Fig.1 A). Consistent with the postulated negative regulatory role of this residue, we observed a rapid mitogen-induced Ser-259 dephosphorylation that persisted up to 10 min after EGF stimulation (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, dephosphorylation of Ser-621, a second putative inhibitory site (18Mischak H. Seitz T. Janosch P. Eulitz M. Steen H. Schellerer M. Philipp A. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5409-5418Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), was transient. After initial dephosphorylation (2 min), this residue was quickly rephosphorylated and appeared to be actually hyperphosphorylated 10 min after EGF stimulation, a time when the Raf-1 kinase was activated. Therefore, dephosphorylation of Ser-259, but not of Ser-621, correlates with peak Raf-1 activation by EGF. Okadaic acid inhibited mitogen-induced dephosphorylation of both residues (Fig.1 B) and full-fledged Raf-1 activation (Fig. 1 C; 37 and 40% inhibition after 5 and 10 min of EGF treatment). We next examined whether dephosphorylated Raf-1 was found preferentially in the membrane or in the cytosol of COS cells. In untreated cells, both the cytosol and the membrane compartment contained Raf-1 phosphorylated on Ser-259 (Fig. 1 D). 2 min after EGF stimulation, dephosphorylation was evident in the cytosol and, considering the increased amount of Raf-1 protein due to the beginning of recruitment, was even more evident in the membrane fraction. Okadaic acid blocked dephosphorylation in both compartments. Interestingly, the EGF-mediated translocation of wt Raf-1 to the membrane seemed to be impaired by the drug. Considering the impairment in membrane translocation, the specific activity of membrane-recruited kinase was comparable in okadaic acid-treated and untreated cells. The bulk of the Raf-1 protein was cytosolic and at this early time point had a very low specific activity that was not reduced by okadaic acid pretreatment (Fig.1 D). We next investigated whether mitogens induced Ser-259 dephosphorylation by promoting physical association between Raf-1 and PP2A. We had previously addressed this question in macrophages and shown that PP2A is present in Raf-1 immunoprecipitates (22Abraham D. Podar K. Pacher M. Kubicek M. Welzel N. Hemmings B.A. Dilworth S.M. Mischak H. Kolch W. Baccarini M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22300-22304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). These experiments were performed under extremely stringent washing conditions and did not clearly show whether growth factor treatment influenced the association between Raf-1 and PP2A. We re-examined this issue by determining the amount of Raf-1 present in PP2AC immunoprecipitates obtained under less stringent conditions from quiescent and growth factor-stimulated cells. Raf-1 was recovered in PP2AC immunoprecipitates from both the cytosolic and the membrane fraction of COS-1 cells. Treatment with EGF stimulated the Raf-1/PP2A association in both compartments, although the increase was more evident in the cytosolic fraction (Fig.2 A). The kinetics of mitogen-stimulated complex formation were similar to those of kinase activation (compare Fig. 2 A and Fig. 1 C). Okadaic acid did not disrupt the association and in fact appeared to stabilize the complex, possibly due to substrate trapping by the inactive phosphatase (Fig. 2 A). Raf-1 was also detectable in PP2A immunoprecipitates from EGF-treated wt, but not Raf-1-deficient (28Mikula M. Schreiber M. Husak Z. Kucerova L. Ruth J. Wieser R. Zatloukal K. Beug H. Wagner E.F. Baccarini M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1952-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) 3T3 cells (Fig. 2 B). In BAC-1.2F5 cells, CSF-1 stimulated Raf-1/PP2A association both in the cytosolic and in the membrane fraction. The amount of Raf-1 recovered in PP2A immunoprecipitates was maximal at 2 min and decreased after 15 min of treatment (Fig.2 C). In BAC-1.2F5 cells, Raf-1 kinase activation reached a peak around 2 min and subsided by 15 min (22Abraham D. Podar K. Pacher M. Kubicek M. Welzel N. Hemmings B.A. Dilworth S.M. Mischak H. Kolch W. Baccarini M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22300-22304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 31Buscher D. Hipskind R.A. Krautwald S. Reimann T. Baccarini M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Thus, the kinetics of Raf-1/PP2A association correlated with those of activation in CSF-1-treated macrophages. These data indicate that mitogens can stimulate association between endogenous Raf-1 and PP2A in different cell types. We next investigated the relevance of Ser-259 dephosphorylation in the activation of endogenous Raf-1. In untreated COS-1 cells, Ser-259 phosphorylation of Raf-1 could be observed in the cytosol (Fig.3 A; Ser(P)-259 immunoblot (pS259), middle left panel). 10 min after EGF stimulation, okadaic acid-sensitive dephosphorylation was evident in the cytosol. Inhibition of Ser-259 dephosphorylation by the drug was accompanied by a 30% reduction in EGF-stimulated kinase activity (Fig.3 A, top left panel). Ser-259 phosphorylation of membrane-associated Raf-1 could not be detected under any of the conditions used (Fig. 3 A; Ser(P)-259 immunoblot,middle right panel), likely due to the limited amount of Raf-1 protein present in this compartment. In particular, in the presence of okadaic acid EGF-mediated membrane recruitment of Raf-1 was completely abrogated (Fig. 3 A; Raf-1 immunoblot,bottom right panel), whereas Raf-1 kinase activation was reduced by 48% but not entirely prevented (Fig. 3 A,top right panel). It would thus appear that the main effect of okadaic acid is to decrease Raf-1 membrane translocation rather than to reduce the specific activity of the kinase. We next investigated the effect of okadaic acid treatment on Raf-1 Ser-259 phosphorylation and membrane translocation in CSF-1-induced BAC-1.2F5 macrophages. In contrast to COS cells, phosphorylation of Ser-259 cannot be demonstrated by in vivo labeling of quiescent macrophages (22Abraham D. Podar K. Pacher M. Kubicek M. Welzel N. Hemmings B.A. Dilworth S.M. Mischak H. Kolch W. Baccarini M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22300-22304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) but is readily detectable in okadaic acid-pretreated, CSF-1-stimulated cells. Immunoblotting with anti-Ser(P)-259 antibodies confirmed our original result (Fig. 3 B). Thus, phosphorylation of Ser-259 can be constitutive or mitogen-induced depending on the cellular context. In BAC-1.2F5 macrophages, Raf-1 activation occurs with much faster kinetics than in COS cells (peak at 2 min (22Abraham D. Podar K. Pacher M. Kubicek M. Welzel N. Hemmings B.A. Dilworth S.M. Mischak H. Kolch W. Baccarini M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22300-22304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar)) and cannot be blocked by transfection with a dominant negative Ras mutant (31Buscher D. Hipskind R.A. Krautwald S. Reimann T. Baccarini M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Despite these differences, Raf-1 activation in macrophages was paralleled by membrane translocation of the kinase. Pretreatment of quiescent cells with okadaic acid increased the amount of membrane-associated Raf-1 but abrogated the membrane translocation in CSF-1-stimulated cells (Fig. 3 C). Based on these data, we investigated the effect of okadaic acid on the EGF-induced membrane translocation of wt Raf-1 and of a Ser-259 Raf-1 mutant in COS-1 cells in more detail. Subcellular fractionation showed that low amounts of Raf-1 were detectable in the membrane fraction of quiescent cells and that EGF treatment caused steady membrane accumulation of the kinase over the time course analyzed. In okadaic acid-treated cells, early translocation (2 min) was slightly impaired. At later time points, instead of accumulating, Raf-1 eventually disappeared from the membrane fraction (Fig. 4 A, left panel). In contrast, a S259A Raf-1 mutant, whose activation is not impaired by okadaic acid (Fig. 4 B and Ref. 22Abraham D. Podar K. Pacher M. Kubicek M. Welzel N. Hemmings B.A. Dilworth S.M. Mischak H. Kolch W. Baccarini M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22300-22304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), was constitutively present in the membrane fraction of quiescent cells, and neither EGF nor okadaic acid altered its localization significantly (Fig. 4 A, middle panel). wt Raf-1 and the S259A mutant were expressed at comparable levels in COS cells. This rules out the possibility that the preferential localization of S259A to the membrane was due to overexpression of the mutant as compared with the wt protein and, therefore, to nonspecific membrane association (Fig.4 A, right panel). Thus, Ser-259 dephosphorylation appears to play a role in Raf-1 membrane accumulation. Paradoxically, in most experiments okadaic acid caused a detectable increase in the accumulation of wt Raf-1 to the membrane of unstimulated cells (Fig.4 A, left panel, and Figs. 2 A and3 C). It is conceivable that this effect of okadaic acid might be mediated via phosphorylation of Ser-621, which has been implicated in the translocation of Raf-1 to the membrane (17Thorson J.A. Yu L.W. Hsu A.L. Shih N.Y. Graves P.R. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Piwnica-Worms H. Shaw A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5229-5238Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This explanation, however, would not fit well with the transient dephosphorylation of this residue observed early in the kinetics of EGF stimulation. To address the significance of Ser-621 in Raf-1 membrane translocation, we compared the behavior of wt kinase and of a S621A mutant in EGF-stimulated cells pretreated or not with okadaic acid. The S621A mutant associated with the membrane of unstimulated cells slightly more efficiently than wt Raf-1 and was translocated to the membrane upon EGF stimulation. Okadaic acid treatment of unstimulated cells increased the membrane pool of S621A Raf-1 molecules, but it reduced their EGF-induced translocation. This behavior is identical to that displayed by wt Raf-1. Thus, Ser-621 phosphorylation is dispensable for EGF-induced Raf-1 membrane translocation. The data mentioned above indicate that the phosphorylation of Ser-259 impairs Raf-1 membrane accumulation. To test whether this is the main function of Ser-259 phosphorylation, or whether, in addition, phosphorylation of this residue has a direct effect on kinase activity, we investigated the effect of okadaic acid on the activation and Ser-259 phosphorylation of Raf-1CAAX(Raf-1 artificially tethered to the membrane by the Ki-Ras membrane-targeting signal). As previously described, the basal activity of Raf-1CAAX was modestly increased with respect to a mutant with a non-functional membrane-targeting signal (Raf-1SAAX). Both mutants were efficiently stimulated by EGF. Pretreatment with okadaic acid prevented EGF-induced Ser-259 dephosphorylation and decreased activation of Raf-1SAAX by 40%. Raf-1CAAX activation, in contrast, was fully refractory to okadaic acid (Fig. 5). These data confirm that Ser-259 phosphorylation per se does not have a negative effect on the activity of membrane-targeted Raf-1 and indicate that Ser-259 dephosphorylation supports full-fledged Raf-1 activation solely by increasing accumulation of the kinase at the membrane. We have previously shown that Raf-1-associated PP2A is a positive regulator of Raf-1 activation in COS cells and macrophages and that this function is mediated via Ser-259 of Raf-1. PP2A might either prevent inactivation of Raf-1 or facilitate its activation. Although our former work did not distinguish between these two possibilities, we favored the idea that PP2A counteracted the inhibitory effect of a mitogen-stimulated Ser-259 kinase (possibly Akt/protein kinase B) (21Zimmermann S. Moelling K. Science. 1999; 286: 1741-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). By using a phospho-specific antiserum, we could confirm this hypothesis in macrophages. In quiescent BAC-1.2F5 cells, in fact, Ser-259 phosphorylation is undetectable even in the presence of okadaic acid. Ser-259 phosphorylation occurs simultaneously with activation, but it is so efficiently counteracted by PP2A that it can only be revealed by okadaic acid pretreatment. In COS cells, in contrast, Ser-259 phosphorylation is constitutive as determined by both Western blotting with phospho-specific antiserum (Fig. 1, B and D) and in vivo radiolabeling (not shown), indicating a turnover of this site in the absence of mitogen. Dephosphorylation occurs early upon EGF stimulation, and it precedes (and contributes to) peak activation. Thus, depending on the cellular context, constitutively active as well as mitogen-induced kinases can phosphorylate Ser-259. In either case, however, dephosphorylation is necessary to stabilize Raf-1 activation and its association with the membrane. Ser-259 phosphorylation mainly affects mitogen-induced membrane localization of Raf-1 but not its specific activity. Consistently, S259A Raf-1 localizes to the membrane significantly more than the wt and is refractory to okadaic acid pretreatment (Fig. 4). Furthermore, a membrane-tethered Raf-1 (Raf-1CAAX) is activated by EGF regardless of Ser-259 phosphorylation (Fig. 5). In COS cells, inhibition of dephosphorylation leads to a dramatic impairment in EGF-induced membrane accumulation of wt Raf-1 but only to a 40–50% reduction in kinase activation. Ser-259 dephosphorylation is apparent 2 min after EGF stimulation; at this time point, however, phosphatase inhibition has only marginal effects on Raf-1 membrane translocation and kinase activation (Figs. 1 and 4). Furthermore, the few Raf-1 molecules in the membrane of okadaic acid-pretreated cells appear to be extremely active (Fig. 3 A). This higher specific activity of membrane-recruited Raf-1 explains why the okadaic acid fails to inhibit kinase activation completely. Thus, inhibition of dephosphorylation appears to play a dual role in Raf-1 activation, a negative role in membrane accumulation but a positive role on the specific activity of membrane-recruited Raf-1. These results are reminiscent of previous observations made by Hancock and co-workers (16Roy S. McPherson R.A. Apolloni A. Yan J. Lane A. Clyde-Smith J. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3947-3955Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) in an in vitro system of Ras-mediated Raf-1 activation and recruitment. In those experiments, the addition of recombinant 14-3-3 proteins to the system caused an increase in the specific activity of membrane-recruited Raf-1 but a decrease in the amount of Raf-1 associated with the Ras membranes (16Roy S. McPherson R.A. Apolloni A. Yan J. Lane A. Clyde-Smith J. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3947-3955Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The essential role of 14-3-3 as a stimulator of Raf-1 activity is most likely mediated by Ser-621 (15Tzivion G. Luo Z. Avruch J. Nature. 1998; 394: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 17Thorson J.A. Yu L.W. Hsu A.L. Shih N.Y. Graves P.R. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Piwnica-Worms H. Shaw A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5229-5238Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Like Ser-259, this residue is dephosphorylated early upon EGF stimulation (Fig. 1 A). Interestingly, a S621A mutant associates with the membrane of quiescent cells somewhat more efficiently than wt Raf-1 (Fig. 4 C), suggesting that dephosphorylation of Ser-621, too, might promote membrane translocation of Raf-1. It is possible that dephosphorylation of both residues is necessary for the dissociation of 14-3-3 proteins and membrane translocation of Raf-1 (16Roy S. McPherson R.A. Apolloni A. Yan J. Lane A. Clyde-Smith J. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3947-3955Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Unlike Ser-259, which remains dephosphorylated throughout activation, Ser-621 is quickly rephosphorylated. This is in line with the proposed autophosphorylation of this residue (17Thorson J.A. Yu L.W. Hsu A.L. Shih N.Y. Graves P.R. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Piwnica-Worms H. Shaw A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5229-5238Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and would allow, in theory, quick re-binding of 14-3-3 to Ser-621 and stimulation of Raf-1 (15Tzivion G. Luo Z. Avruch J. Nature. 1998; 394: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar,17Thorson J.A. Yu L.W. Hsu A.L. Shih N.Y. Graves P.R. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Piwnica-Worms H. Shaw A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5229-5238Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In contrast to S259A Raf-1, the S621A mutant behaves like wt Raf-1 in okadaic acid-treated, EGF-stimulated cells; thus, phosphorylation of Ser-259, but not of Ser-621, is responsible for the impairment in mitogen-induced membrane accumulation of Raf-1. In principle, Ser-259 dephosphorylation might increase Raf-1 membrane association either by promoting recruitment (priming Raf-1 for activation) or by allowing Raf-1 to remain at the membrane after activation. We favor the latter hypothesis for two reasons. First, okadaic acid leads to the complete disappearance of Raf-1 from the membrane fraction of EGF-treated cells, but it actually increases the amount of membrane-associated Raf-1 in quiescent cells (Fig. 3,A and C, and Fig. 4). At present, the molecular basis of this paradoxical effect, which is not affected by mutation of Ser-259 or Ser-621 and which is somewhat variable in its extent, is unknown. However, these data indicate that only activated Raf-1 can be earmarked for removal from the membrane by Ser-259 phosphorylation. Second, small amounts of Ser-259-phosphorylated Raf-1 can be detected in the membrane of untreated COS-1 cells overexpressing Raf-1 and can be activated by EGF even in the presence of okadaic acid (Fig.1 D). Thus, Ser-259 phosphorylation does not absolutely preclude membrane localization or activation but should rather be envisioned as a safety catch, decreasing the pool of active Raf-1 molecules that can accumulate in this compartment (Fig.6). How could phosphorylation of Ser-259 favor the removal of Raf-1 from the membrane of activated cells? Ser-259 phosphorylation might, for instance, render membrane association more transient by masking the CRD (Raf-1 cysteine-rich domain) and thereby destabilizing its interaction with membrane lipids and/or with Ras (32Sendoh H. Hu C.D. Wu D. Song C. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Kotani J. Okada T. Shima F. Kariya K. Kataoka T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 596-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 33Mott H.R.

Indeed, the S259A Raf-1 mutant shows increased Ras binding (data not shown). An alternative, attractive possible explanation comes from the recently published work by Jaumot and Hancock (34Jaumot M. Hancock J.F. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3949-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Using an in vitro system that relies on Ras binding to activate Raf-1, these authors show that phosphatase inhibitors block Raf-1 activation and promote the accumulation of inactive Raf-1/14-3-3 complexes in membrane microdomains that contain endocytic markers. The authors suggest that these complexes might represent a pool of deactivated molecules on their way to the cytosol. It is likely that these intermediates can only be detected in thein vitro system, whereas in vivo one would only observe an increased removal of Raf-1 from the membrane, as seen here. Finally, it is possible that membrane-associated, Ser(P)-259 Raf-1 is recognized and removed from the membrane by a factor(s) activated by EGF. This would explain why in unstimulated cells Raf-1 is not removed from the membrane when phosphorylated on Ser-259 as a result of okadaic acid treatment. Be that as it may, mitogens deactivate the safety catch by promoting Raf-1/PP2A association and the dephosphorylation of Ser-259 (Figs.Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). By so doing, they ensure efficient membrane accumulation of active Raf-1 and allow a larger pool of molecules to be retained at this site. In vivo, such a mechanism might have a remarkable impact on the strength and duration of kinase activation, as recently shown in Caenorhabditis elegans. In this system, elimination of the inhibitory phosphorylation is as effective as mimicking activating phosphorylation in conferring constitutive biological activity on lin-45 Raf (9Chong H. Lee J. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3716-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). By showing that Ser-259 dephosphorylation supports membrane accumulation of Raf-1, our findings assign a specific function to Ser-259 phosphorylation/dephosphorylation in Raf-1 activation in vivo and provide a mechanistic explanation for the positive regulation of the kinase by PP2A. We are grateful to Dr. Stephen M. Dilworth for the gift of PP2A monoclonal antibodies and to Drs. Thomas Decker and Egon Ogris for many helpful discussions and for critically reading this manuscript."

LTB4 stimulates a number of cellular functions in addition to chemotaxis, including release of lysosomal enzymes and production of ROS (6Li Y. Ferrante A. Poulos A. Harvey D.P. J. Clin.

Although LTB4-induced leukocyte recruitment is thought to play a protective role in the host defense against various pathogens, it is also involved in the pathogenesis of such inflammatory diseases as bronchial asthma (9Turner C.R.

Despite many reports on the cellular functions of LTB4, the exact signaling pathway along which its biological activities are transduced remains largely unknown. It is known, however, that LTB4 acts via two G protein-coupled receptors, BLT1 and BLT2 (15Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T.

The former is a high affinity LTB4 receptor expressed mainly in polymorphonuclear leukocytes, whereas the latter is a ubiquitous, low affinity receptor whose expression is highest in spleen (17Yokomizo T.

Commun. 1999; 262: 806-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The details of the cellular functions of BLT1 and BLT2 are still largely unknown. Recently, however, LTB4-induced chemotaxis was shown to be completely inhibited in cells pretreated with PTX (100 ng/ml), indicating the participation of a PTX-sensitive G protein in LTB4 signaling to chemotaxis (16Haribabu B.

LTB4 also elicits increases in intracellular free Ca2+ and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate, but these are apparently not involved in the chemotactic response by LTB4(15Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). In addition to the BLTs, LTB4 can also bind to and activate the intranuclear transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α, resulting in the activation of genes that terminate inflammatory processes (21Devchand P.R. Keller H. Peters J.M. Vazquez M. Gonzalez F.J. Wahli W. Nature. 1996; 384: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar, 22Chinetti G. Fruchart J.-C. Staels B. Inflamm. Res. 2000; 49: 479-505Crossref Scopus (742) Google Scholar). We previously observed that LTB4 plays a role in mediating TNF-α-induced ROS generation in Rat-2 fibroblasts (23Woo C.-H. Eom Y.-W. Yoo M.-H. You H.-J. Han H.-J. Song W.-K. Yoo Y.-J. Chun J.-S. Kim J.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32357-32362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). LTB4 likewise induces ROS generation in neutrophils, eosinophils, and other fibroblasts (6Li Y. Ferrante A. Poulos A. Harvey D.P. J. Clin.

J. 2000; 348: 525-530Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the signaling pathway via which this effect is exerted as well as the precise cellular function of the increased ROS levels remains largely unknown. Although NADPH oxidase was proposed to play a role in the generation of ROS in response to LTB4 in eosinophils, the detailed signaling mechanism is still unclear (7Lindsay M.A. Perkins R.S. Barnes P.J. Giembycz M.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4526-4534PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we and others have shown that Rac, a member of the Rho family GTPases, plays a crucial role in ROS generation in fibroblasts (23Woo C.-H. Eom Y.-W. Yoo M.-H. You H.-J. Han H.-J.

J. 1996; 318: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Additionally, the generation of ROS by Rac was shown to be mediated mainly by cPLA2-linked cascade (24Woo C-H. Lee Z.-W. Kim B.-C. Ha K.-S. Kim J.-H. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 525-530Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a possible role of cPLA2 as a downstream mediator of Rac in the signaling to ROS generation. Therefore, in an effort to broaden our understanding of LTB4-induced signaling, we studied the pathway via which exogenous LTB4 induces the generation of ROS in Rat-2 fibroblasts. Our results suggest that Rac, ERK, and cPLA2all play pivotal roles in the LTB4-induced generation of ROS required for the chemotactic activity and proliferation elicited by exogenous LTB4. 2′,7′-Dichlorofluorescein diacetate was purchased from Molecular Probes. MK-886, genistein, herbimycin, and AACOCF3 were from BIOMOL. LTB4and cysLTs were from Cayman Chemical Co. LPA, LY294002, wortmannin, DPI, and NAC were from Sigma. FBS, DMEM, phenol red-free DMEM, gentamicin, and nonessential amino acids were from Invitrogen. ZK 158252, a specific BLT antagonist, was kindly provided by Dr. Claudia Giesen (Experimental Dermatology, Schering AG, Berlin, Germany). All other chemicals were from standard sources and were molecular biology grade or higher. The pEXV and pEXV-RacV12plasmids were gifts from Dr. A. Hall (University College, London, United Kingdom). Rat-2 fibroblasts were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, CRL 1764), and the cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 0.1 mmnonessential amino acids, 10% FBS, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C under a humidified 95%, 5% (v/v) mixture of air and CO2. Stable Rat2-RacN17 clones expressing RacN17, a dominant negative Rac1 mutant, were described previously (23Woo C.-H. Eom Y.-W. Yoo M.-H. You H.-J. Han H.-J. Song W.-K. Yoo Y.-J. Chun J.-S. Kim J.-H.

Cells. 1998; 8: 90-95PubMed Google Scholar). Transient transfection was carried out by plating ∼5 × 105 cells in 100-mm dishes for 24 h and then adding calcium phosphate:DNA precipitates prepared with 20 μg of DNA/dish. To control for variations in cell number and transfection efficiency, all clones were cotransfected with 1 μg of pCMV-βGAL, a eukaryotic expression vector containing the Escherichia coliβ-galactosidase (lacZ) structural gene under the transcriptional control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The quantity of DNA used in each transfection was held constant (20 μg) by adding sonicated calf thymus DNA (Sigma). To measure ERK kinase activity with PathDetect trans-reporting system (Stratagene catalog no. 219005), Elk1 fused to trans-activator plasmid was co-transfected with pFR-Luc reporter plasmid according to the manufacturer's protocol. After incubating with the calcium phosphate:DNA precipitates for 6 h, the cells were rinsed twice with PBS before incubating them in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS for additional 24 h. Each dish of cells was then rinsed twice with PBS and lysed in 0.1 ml of lysis solution (0.2 m Tris, pH 7.6, plus 0.1% Triton X-100), after which the supernatants were assayed for luciferase activity as well as protein concentration and β-galactosidase activity. Intracellular H2O2 was measured as a function of DCF fluorescence using the procedures of Ohba et al. (27Ohba M. Shibanuma M. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 26: 1079-1088Crossref Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown on coverslips for 2 days and then serum-starved in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% (v/v) FBS for an additional 2 days. They were then stabilized in serum-free DMEM without phenol red for at least 30 min before exposure to agonists (LTB4 or cysLTs) for the indicated times. When assessing the effects of inhibitors, cells were pretreated with the respective inhibitor for 30 min. To measure intracellular H2O2, cells were then incubated for 10 min with the H2O2-sensitive fluorophore 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (5 μg/ml), which when taken up fluorescently labels intracellular H2O2 with DCF. The cells were then immediately observed under a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss LSM 410); DCF fluorescence was excited at 488 nm using an argon laser, and the evoked emission was filtered with a 515-nm long pass filter. DCF fluorescence was measured in 30 randomly selected cells. Rac1 activation was measured using a GST-(PAK)-PBD fusion protein that binds GTP-bound, activated Rac1 as described previously (28Akasaki T. Koga H. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18055-18059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Briefly, the fusion protein was expressed inE. coli BL21 transformed with pGEX-4T3 plasmid by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction and then purified by column chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose-4B. Rat-2 cells were serum-starved for 36 h prior to stimulation with LTB4 for the indicated time periods, after which cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaF, 75 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmNa2VO3), centrifuged for 20 s at 12,000 × g, and the supernatant was incubated on ice for 3 min with the GST-(PAK)-PBD fusion protein, which had been freshly coupled to glutathione-agarose beads. Proteins complexed to the beads were recovered by centrifugation, washed twice with the lysis buffer, and resuspended in sample buffer. The proteins were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were then probed with anti-Rac1 antibody (1:2000 dilution) and detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody and an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (ECL, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Protein samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE performed on 8% (for cPLA2) or 10% (for ERKs or p38) acrylamide gels, followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using a Novex wet transfer unit (for 2 h at 100 V). The membranes were blocked for 1 h with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 plus 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, incubated first for 2 h with the primary antibody (1:1000 dilutions for cPLA2; 1:2000 dilutions for phospho-ERKs) in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 plus 3% (w/v) BSA, and then for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody prior to development using an ECL kit. Bands corresponding to cPLA2, p38, and ERKs on XAR-5 film (Eastman Kodak Co.) were measured by densitometry. To visualize the localization of endogenous cPLA2, cells were plated on coverslips and grown for 24 h in DMEM containing 10% FBS. They were then starved in serum-free DMEM for 16 h before exposure to an agonist. Thereafter the cells were washed with cold PBS, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, blocked in 1% BSA (solubilized in PBS), and labeled with mouse anti-cPLA2 antibody (1:150). The immunolabeled cells were then washed with PBS and labeled with a tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate-conjugated, anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:200). After washing again with cold PBS, the cells were mounted on a slide glass for observation under a fluorescence microscope. Rat-2 cells were serum-starved in DMEM containing 0.5% FBS for 24 h and then exposed to the appropriate agonist for the indicated times. The medium was then removed, and the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, scraped, harvested by microcentrifugation, and resuspended in 0.2 ml of buffer A (137 mm NaCl, 8.1 mmNa2HPO4, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.5). The resuspended cells were lysed by sonicating them twice for 15 s each or by passing them 20 times through a 21.1-gauge needle on ice. The lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to prepare cytosolic and total particulate fractions. The particulate fraction, containing the membrane fraction, was washed twice and resuspended in 50 μl of buffer A. The supernatant fraction was precipitated with five volumes of acetone, incubated on ice for 5 min, centrifuged, and the pellet was resuspended in buffer A. Protein concentrations were routinely determined using the Bradford procedure with Bio-Rad dye reagent using BSA as a standard. The chemotactic motility of Rat-2 or Rat2-RacN17 cells was assayed using Transwell chambers with 6.5-mm diameter polycarbonate filters (8-μm pore size). Briefly, the lower surfaces of the filters were coated with 10 μg/ml gelatin (Collaborative Biomedicals) in HEPES-buffered RPMI 1640 medium for 2 h at 37 °C. Dry coated filters containing various amounts of LTB4 were placed in the lower wells of the Transwell chambers, after which 100 μl of Rat-2 or Rat2-RacN17cells in DMEM containing 1% FBS were loaded into the top wells, yielding a final concentration of 1×106 cells/ml. If necessary, inhibitors were applied to the cells for 20 min at room temperature before seeding. After incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 3 h, the filters were disassembled, and the upper surface of each filter was scraped free of cells by wiping it with a cotton swab. Cells that had migrated to the underside of the filter were fixed for 1 min with methanol and stained for 20 min with hematoxylin and eosin. Chemotaxis was quantified by counting the cells on the lower side of the filter under an optical microscope (magnification, ×200). Ten fields were counted in each assay; each sample was assayed in duplicate, and the assays were repeated twice. Το assess cell growth, Rat-2 or Rat2-RacN17 cells were plated onto 60-mm plates (105 cells/plate) in DMEM containing 10% FBS. The next day, the medium was replaced with serum-free medium or serum-free medium containing LTB4 or LPA. The number of viable cells was then counted after an additional 48 h. Data are expressed as means ± S.D. or as percentages ± S.D. of control. Statistical comparisons between groups were made using Student'st tests. Values of p < 0.01 were considered significant. To assess whether LTB4 induces ROS generation, Rat-2 fibroblasts were serum-starved for 48 h and then exposed to exogenous LTB4 for 3 min. The resultant ROS generation was monitored as a function of H2O2-sensitive DCF fluorescence. As shown in Fig. 1 A, 0.3 μmLTB4 elicited a significant (∼2.5-fold) increase in the levels of ROS; no further increases were seen at LTB4concentrations up to 1 μm (data not shown). This effect was completely inhibited by ZK158252, a specific BLT antagonist (17Yokomizo T. Kato K. Terawaki K. Izumi T. Shimizu T. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 421-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar,29Devchand P.R. Hihi A.K. Perroud M. Scheuning W.D. Spiegelman B.M. Wahli W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23341-23348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), whereas ROS generated in response to exogenous cysLTs (LTC4/D4/E4 mixture) were unaffected by ZK158252, confirming that LTB4 generates ROS via a specific BLT-linked pathway (Fig. 1 B). Likewise, the ROS response elicited by TNF-α (∼2.6-fold increase) was completely abolished by ZK158252 (Fig. 1 B), which is consistent with the previous report suggesting the mediatory role of BLTR in TNF-α signaling to ROS generation (23Woo C.-H. Eom Y.-W. Yoo M.-H. You H.-J. Han H.-J. Song W.-K. Yoo Y.-J. Chun J.-S. Kim J.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32357-32362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). It has been reported that BLTs are closely coupled to a PTX-sensitive G protein (15Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar, 16Haribabu B. Zhelev D.V. Pridgen B.C. Richardson R.M. Ali H. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37087-37092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Consistent with that idea, pretreatment with PTX (100 ng/ml) also completely blocked LTB4-induced ROS generation (Fig. 2). By contrast, LTB4-induced ROS generation was little affected by EGTA,U73122, or calphostin C, suggesting that Ca2+ mobilization, phospholipase C, and protein kinase C are not involved. Previously, we and others have reported that Rac1 plays a crucial role in ROS generation in fibroblasts (23Woo C.-H. Eom Y.-W. Yoo M.-H. You H.-J. Han H.-J. Song W.-K. Yoo Y.-J. Chun J.-S. Kim J.-H.

J. 1996; 318: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). To examine whether Rac1 is involved in LTB4 signaling to ROS generation, we compared the effects of LTB4 in Rat-2 and Rat2-RacN17 cells, which express a dominant negative Rac1 mutant (26Kim B.-C. Yi Y.-J. Yi S.-J. Shin I.-C. Ha K.-S. Jhun B.-H. Hwang S.-B. Kim J.-H. Mol. Cells. 1998; 8: 90-95PubMed Google Scholar). Although substantial ROS generation (a ∼2.3-fold increase over control) was observed within 3 min of exposing Rat-2 cells to 0.3 μm LTB4, little effect was observed in Rat2-RacN17 cells under the same conditions (Fig. 3, A andB). This result prompted us to test directly the extent to which exposure to LTB4 alters cellular Rac1 activity; we found that indeed LTB4 induced significant, time-dependent increase in Rac1 activity, consistent with the proposed mediatory role of LTB4 signaling (Fig.3 C). We recently reported that cPLA2 serves as a key downstream mediator of Rac in Rat-2 cells (23Woo C.-H. Eom Y.-W. Yoo M.-H. You H.-J. Han H.-J. Song W.-K. Yoo Y.-J. Chun J.-S. Kim J.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32357-32362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 24Woo C-H. Lee Z.-W. Kim B.-C. Ha K.-S. Kim J.-H. Biochem.

Eom Y.-W. Choi E.-J. Na D.-S. Kim J.-H. Biochem. Biophy. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We therefore assessed the effects of AACOCF3, a specific cPLA2inhibitor, on LTB4-induced ROS generation and found that pretreatment with 10 μm AACOCF3 almost completely blocked LTB4-induced ROS generation (>90% inhibition) (Fig. 4 A). By contrast, MK-886, a specific 5-LO inhibitor (Fig. 4 A), and indomethacin, a nonspecific COX inhibitor, had little or no inhibitory effect (data not shown). It thus appears that activation of cPLA2, without subsequent metabolism of arachidonic acid by 5-LO or COX, is required for LTB4-induced ROS generation. The role of cPLA2 in LTB4 signaling was further confirmed by our observations that LTB4 evoked translocation of cPLA2 to the membrane compartment (e.g. nuclear envelope area) in Rat-2, but not Rat2-RacN17 cells (Fig. 4 B), as well as time-dependent increases (up to 10 min) in levels of cPLA2 in the particulate fraction of Rat-2 cell lysates (Fig. 4 C). Interestingly, we also observed that, with more prolonged incubations (e.g. 30 min after LTB4treatment), the level of cPLA2 in the particulate fraction was significantly diminished, whereas that in the soluble fraction increased (Fig. 4 C). To investigate the possible involvement of MAP kinases in LTB4signaling to ROS generation, we tested the effects of 10 μm PD098059, a specific MEK inhibitor, and 10 μm SB203580, a specific p38 kinase inhibitor, on the production of intracellular ROS. We found that, although pretreatment with the former inhibited LTB4-induced ROS generation, pretreatment with the latter did not (Fig.5 A). This finding suggested the presence of ERK in the LTB4 signaling pathway, which prompted us to test whether ERK is indeed activated in cells exposed to LTB4. We found that exposing serum-starved Rat-2 cells to 0.3 μm LTB4 for 5 min significantly elevated levels of the activated (phosphorylated) ERK form in manner that was entirely dependent on Rac activity, as the effect was absent in Rat2-RacN17 cells (Fig. 5 B). Addition of epidermal growth factor, by contrast, evoked virtually the same level of ERK activation in both Rat-2 and Rat2-RacN17 cells. ERK activation was also dose-dependently elevated by transient transfection with plasmid expressing RacV12, a constitutively active form of Rac1 (Fig. 5 C). Similarly, RacV12 elevated Elk-luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5 D), confirming the ERK activation by Rac1. To investigate further mediators involved in the LTB4-induced ROS generation, we assessed the effects of inhibitors of PI 3-kinase on production of intracellular ROS. As shown in Fig. 6 A, LTB4-evoked ROS generation was completely blocked by specific PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (10 μm) or wortmannin (50 nm). Besides PI 3-kinase, we observed that tyrosine kinase inhibitors, herbimycin and genistein, also dramatically diminished LTB4-evoked ROS generation. Moreover, when we tested whether LTB4-induced ERK activation is affected by PI 3-kinase inhibition, we found the effect of LTB4 on ERK to be highly dependent on PI 3-kinase and tyrosine kinase(s) activities, as ERK activation was clearly diminished by pretreatment with LY294002, wortmannin (Fig. 6 B), herbimycin, or genistein (data not shown). Administration of 1 μmLTB4APA, a specific BLT antagonist, confirmed that LTB4 elicited ERK activation via BLT (Fig. 6 B). Together, our results strongly suggest the mediatory roles of PI 3-kinase and tyrosine kinase(s) in the LTB4 signaling pathway to ROS production, acting upstream of ERK. This result is consistent with our previous report (32Kim B.-C. Lee M.-N. Kim J.-Y. Lee S.-S. Chang J.-D. Kim S.-S. Lee S.-Y. Kim J.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24372-24377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), suggesting the role of PI 3-kinase acting upstream of Rac1 in Rat-2 fibroblasts. Additionally, PI 3-kinase or tyrosine kinase activities were shown to be essential for mediating the chemotaxis in response to LTB4 (8Lindsay M.A. Haddad E.B. Rousell J. Teixeira M.M. Hellewell P.G. Barnes P.J. Giembycz M.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 64: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 16Haribabu B. Zhelev D.V. Pridgen B.C. Richardson R.M. Ali H. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37087-37092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). As LTB4 is known to be a potent chemotactic agent, we examined whether ROS generation could mediate the chemotaxis evoked by LTB4. As shown in Fig.7 (A and B), pretreatment with DPI (2 μm), an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase-like flavoproteins, or NAC (2 mm), a free radical scavenger, diminished chemotaxis elicited by LTB4, suggesting a role for ROS generation in mediating chemotactic activity. RacN17 expression also inhibited chemotaxis induced by LTB4 (Fig. 7 C), supporting the involvement of the Rac-ROS cascade. The role of ROS generation in LTB4-induced cell proliferation was similarly tested. As shown in Fig.8 A, LTB4 elicited significant cell proliferation, which was inhibited by pretreatment with 2 mm NAC or 2 μm DPI, and likewise LTB4-induced cell proliferation was not detected in Rat2-RacN17, although LPA-induced cell proliferation remained intact (Fig. 8 B). Together, these results suggest a potential, mediatory role of Rac-ROS cascade for the LTB4-evoked chemotaxis and cell proliferation. The present study demonstrates the central role played by a Rac-linked cascade in LTB4-signaling to ROS generation in Rat-2 fibroblasts. Supporting that conclusion are the observations that exposure to LTB4 stimulates Rac activity and that stable expression of RacN17 dramatically inhibits LTB4-evoked ROS generation. In addition, our findings suggest that ERK and cPLA2 are situated downstream of Rac1, mediating LTB4 signaling to ROS generation. Levels of ERK and cPLA2 activation were both Rac-dependently increased following treatment with LTB4, as demonstrated by ERK phosphorylation and translocation of cPLA2 to the nuclear envelope (Figs.4 B and 5 B). It was previously shown that cPLA2 translocation from cytosol to particulate fraction represents an activation of cPLA2 (33Schievella A.R. Regier M.K. Smith W.L. Lin L-L. J. Biol.

Commun. 1987; 149: 769-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of constitutively active RacV12 also elicited dose-dependent activation of ERK (Fig. 5, C andD). Consistent with our findings are earlier reports of increased ERK activity in response to LTB4 and of ERK's involvement in the LTB4 signaling to eosinophil activation (7Lindsay M.A. Perkins R.S. Barnes P.J. Giembycz M.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4526-4534PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lindsay M.A. Haddad E.B. Rousell J. Teixeira M.M. Hellewell P.G. Barnes P.J. Giembycz M.A. J.

Most germane to the present study, Rac-dependent ROS generation was shown to be mediated largely by a cPLA2-linked cascade (24Woo C-H. Lee Z.-W. Kim B.-C. Ha K.-S. Kim J.-H. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 525-530Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The downstream signaling pathway via which cPLA2 activation leads to ROS generation is completely unknown, however. Nevertheless, because no detectable inhibition of LTB4-induced ROS generation was observed with treatment with MK-886 or indomethacin, we predict that eicosanoid synthesis by 5-LO or COX is likely not involved. Our results clearly demonstrate that EGTA has no inhibitory effect on LTB4-induced ROS generation (Fig. 2). Although LTB4 evokes rapid, transient increases in Ca2+, such Ca2+ mobilization is not involved in LTB4signaling to ROS generation, as demonstrated by the failure of EGTA or SK&F 96365, a putative inhibitor of receptor-operated Ca2+entry, to affect LTB4-induced ROS generation (7Lindsay M.A. Perkins R.S. Barnes P.J. Giembycz M.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4526-4534PubMed Google Scholar, 37Perkins R.S. Lindsay M.A. Barnes P.J. Giembycz M.A. Biochem.

Furthermore, U73122, a specific inhibitor of phospholipase C, and calphostin C, a protein kinase C inhibitor, also had no effect, thereby excluding these enzymes from the LTB4 signaling cascade leading to ROS generation. On the other hand, PTX completely inhibited ROS generation in response to LTB4, which is consistent with LTB4 mediating chemotaxis via Giprotein-coupled receptors (15Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K.

Chem. 2000; 275: 27000-27004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although we do not yet precisely know which BLT receptor mediates ROS generation in Rat-2 fibroblasts, we suspect that BLT2 occupation is possibly involved. This is because, whereas BLT1 expression has not been detected in Rat-2 fibroblasts, expression of BLT2 was well detected in Rat-2 fibroblasts as well as other cell lines, including A549 epithelial cells using RT-PCR analysis with each BLT-specific primers (39Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Shimizu T. Life Sci. 2001; 68: 2207-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) (data not shown). In addition, the pharmacological properties of BLT2 are distinct from those of BLT1 (17Yokomizo T. Kato K. Terawaki K. Izumi T. Shimizu T. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 421-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar,40Yokomizo T. Kato K. Hagiya H. Izumi T. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12454-12459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Throughout this experiment, LTB4 showed biological activity at concentrations of 0.3–1 μm, which falls within the reported optimal range for BLT2 (e.g. ∼0.1–1 μm) and is 2 orders of magnitude higher than the optimal range for BLT1. In any event, consistent with the proposed action of BLT as a receptor for LTB4 in Rat-2 fibroblasts, we observed that ROS generation by LTB4 is completely abolished by pretreatment with ZK 158252, a potent inhibitor antagonizing both BLT1 and BLT2 (17Yokomizo T. Kato K. Terawaki K. Izumi T. Shimizu T. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 421-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The action of ZK 158252 was quite specific to the LTB4 receptor, as ROS generation elicited by an LTC4/D4/E4 mixture was not affected by this compound (Fig. 1). In support of our finding, increasing evidence points to the existence of a signaling link between LTB4 and ROS generation. For example, Li et al.(6Li Y. Ferrante A. Poulos A. Harvey D.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1605-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and Lindsay et al. (7Lindsay M.A. Perkins R.S. Barnes P.J. Giembycz M.A. J.

Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 64: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), respectively. Further, NADPH oxidase appears to be involved in LTB4 signaling to H2O2 generation in guinea pig eosinophils (7Lindsay M.A. Perkins R.S. Barnes P.J. Giembycz M.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4526-4534PubMed Google Scholar), and, although details of the mechanism are still unclear, cPLA2 appears to play an essential role in the activation of NADPH oxidase in human phagocyte myeloid cells (41Dana R. Leto T.L. Malech H.L. Levy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 441-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The generation of ROS in response to LTB4 does not appear to cause cytotoxicity. Usually, production of ROS in non-phagocytes is only 1–2% of that seen in phagocytes, which produce large amounts of O2− as part of the body's defense against disease processes (42Cross A.R. Jones O.T.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1057: 281-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Instead, our findings suggest that, at least in fibroblasts, ROS generation elicited by LTB4functions in the regulation of intracellular signaling cascades leading to chemotaxis and cell proliferation. Future studies aimed at clarifying the linkage between cPLA2 and ROS will likely be pivotal to our complete understanding of LTB4-evoked intracellular signaling and inflammatory responses.

https://openalex.org/W1995382565,"DNA hypermethylation of CpG islands in the promoter region of genes is associated with transcriptional silencing. Treatment with hypo-methylating agents can lead to expression of these silenced genes. However, whether inhibition of DNA methylation influences the expression of unmethylated genes has not been extensively studied. We analysed the methylation status of CDKN2A and CDKN2D in human lung cancer cell lines and demonstrated that the CDKN2A CpG island is methylated, whereas CDKN2D is unmethylated. Treatment of cells with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR), an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase 1, induced a dose and duration dependent increased expression of both p16INK4a and p19INK4d, the products of CDKN2A and CDKN2D, respectively. These data indicate that global DNA demethylation not only influences the expression of methylated genes but also of unmethylated genes. Histone acetylation is linked to methylation induced transcriptional silencing. Depsipeptide, an inhibitor of histone deacetylase, acts synergistically with 5-Aza-CdR in inducing expression of p16INK4a and p19INK4d. However, when cells were treated with higher concentrations of 5-Aza-CdR and depsipeptide, p16INK4a expression was decreased together with significant suppression of cell growth. Interestingly, p19INK4d expression was enhanced even more by the higher concentrations of 5-Aza-CdR and depsipeptide. Our data suggest that p19INK4d plays a distinct role from other INK4 family members in response to the cytotoxicity induced by inhibition of DNA methylation and histone deacetylation."
https://openalex.org/W2072080830,"Telomerase activation is considered to be a critical step in cancer progression due to its role in cellular immortalization. The prevalence of telomerase expression in human cancers makes it an attractive candidate for new mechanism-based targets for cancer therapy. The selective killing of cancer cells can be achieved by gene-directed enzyme pro-drug therapy (GDEPT). In this study we have tested the feasibility of using the transcriptional regulatory sequences from the hTERT and hTR genes to regulate expression of the bacterial nitroreductase enzyme in combination with the pro-drug CB1954 in a suicide gene therapy strategy. hTERT and hTR promoter activity was compared in a panel of 10 cell lines and showed a wide distribution in activity; low activity was observed in normal cells and telomerase-negative immortal ALT cell lines, with up to 300-fold higher activity observed in telomerase positive cancer lines. Placing the nitroreductase gene under the control of the telomerase gene promoters sensitized cancer cells in tissue culture to the pro-drug CB1954 and promoter activity was predictive of sensitization to the pro-drug (2-20-fold sensitization), with cell death restricted to lines exhibiting high levels of promoter activity. The in vivo relevance of these data was tested using two xenograft models (C33a and GLC4 cells). Significant tumour reduction was seen with both telomerase promoters and the promoter-specific patterns of sensitization observed in tissue culture were retained in xenograft models. Thus, telomerase-specific suicide gene therapy vectors expressing bacterial nitroreductase sensitize human cancer cells to the pro-drug CB1954."

Gestblom C. Hedborg F. Sandstedt B. Olsen L. Påhlman S. Lab. Invest. 1996; 75: 659-675PubMed Google Scholar). This part of the nervous system originates from the neural crest, which, in addition to the cells of the peripheral nervous system, gives rise to cartilage and smooth muscle cells, as well as melanocytes (2Groves A.K. Bronner-Fraser M. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 221-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In recent years, several transcription factors that control differentiation of the developing nervous system have been identified, and many of these belong to the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)1 family of proteins (3Lee J.E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). This family can be divided into different subgroups on the basis of structure, expression pattern, and DNA binding activity (4Massari M.E. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar, 5Murre C. McCaw P.S. Vaessin H. Caudy M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cabrera C.V. Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Lassar A.B. Cell. 1989; 58: 537-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar). The E proteins (also designated class A), have four mammalian members: E2-2, HEB, and the two E2a gene products E12 and E47. These proteins are ubiquitously expressed, and they can bind DNA as homodimers or as heterodimers with the class B or tissue-specific bHLH transcription factors. The homo- or heterodimeric DNA binding complexes activate transcription of target genes that contain the E-box motif CANNTG in their promoter (4Massari M.E. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar). There is also a subgroup of tissue-specific bHLH proteins that repress transcription, typified by hairy/enhancer of split homologue-1 (HES-1) (6Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). The basic DNA-binding domains of these proteins contain a proline that alters the DNA binding specificity, as compared with other bHLH proteins (6Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). The HES-related proteins can achieve their repressive functions in two ways: by binding DNA and recruiting the corepressor transducin-like enhancer of split; or, in a non-DNA-binding manner, by interfering with complex formation between E and bHLH proteins (6Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 7Palaparti A. Baratz A. Stifani S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26604-26610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). From a mechanistic point of view, the latter function resembles the effect of the Id (inhibitors of differentiation or inhibitors of DNA binding) proteins, which are a group of regulatory proteins in the helix-loop-helix (HLH) network. The Id proteins are dominant-negative inhibitors since they lack the basic DNA-binding domain (8Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar). The four mammalian Id proteins (Id1–Id4) form transcriptionally inactive heterodimers, primarily with the E proteins, and thereby prevent the E proteins from forming functional heterodimers with tissue-specific bHLH proteins (9Norton J.D. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3897-38905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian achaete-scute homologue-1 (MASH-1 in the mouse and HASH-1 in humans) is a vital bHLH protein in the developing sympathetic nervous system. MASH-1 is expressed in restricted regions of the embryonic brain and in sympathetic and enteric precursor cells (10Lo L.C. Johnson J.E. Wuenschell C.W. Saito T. Anderson D.J. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1524-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Gene-targeting experiments have shown that MASH-1 is needed for proper development of autonomic and olfactory neuroblasts, neuroendocrine cells of the lung, and certain regions of the telencephalon (11Borges M.

Another tissue-specific bHLH protein is dHAND, which is expressed in the embryonic sympathetic and enteric nervous systems (14Srivastava D. Thomas T. Lin Q. Kirby M.L. Brown D. Olson E.N. Nat.

Neuroblastoma cells show characteristics of developing sympathetic neuroblasts, and we have previously studied the expression ofdHAND and HASH-1, in both primary tumors and neuroblastoma cell lines. At the mRNA level, we detected expression of these two genes in all neuroblastoma cell lines and a majority of the primary tumors we analyzed (16Gestblom C. Grynfeld A. Øra I. Örtoft E. Larsson C.

Furthermore, during induced differentiation of neuroblastoma cells, we observed rapid down-regulation of HASH-1 that was accompanied by a transient up-regulation of HES-1 (17Grynfeld A. Pahlman S. Axelson H. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 88: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). HES-1 is an important protein in the Notch-1 signaling cascade that has been shown to bind the HASH-1 promoter and thereby inhibit expression ofHASH-1 (19Chen H. Thiagalingam A. Chopra H. Borges M.W.

Accordingly, down-regulation ofHASH-1 induced by increased expression of HES-1 may be a prerequisite for neuronal differentiation of neuroblastoma cells (17Grynfeld A. Pahlman S. Axelson H. Int. J.

In the present study, we analyzed expression of the Id genes in relation to some tissue-specific bHLH factors that are expressed in differentiating neuroblastoma cells. We found varying levels of Id1, Id2, and Id3, but not Id4, in neuroblastoma cell lines, and the expression of these proteins was down-regulated when differentiation was induced. To further elucidate the dynamics of the bHLH network, we also performed experiments to ascertain the capacity of Id proteins to interact with bHLH proteins involved in neurogenesis. The results show that the Id proteins form complexes with HES-1, both in vitro and in vivo, which demonstrates novel functions of HES-1 and the Id proteins and provides evidence of an additional level of regulation within the bHLH network. This could have implications for understanding of the formation of the neural crest and the lineage determination of neuronal cells, as well as the function of these proteins in general. The neuroblastoma cell lines SH-SY5Y and SK-N-BE (2Groves A.K. Bronner-Fraser M. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 221-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and the neuroepithelioma cell line SK-N-MC were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The SH-SY5Y cells were induced to differentiate by exposure to 16 nm12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), and the SK-N-BE (2Groves A.K. Bronner-Fraser M. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 221-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) cells were differentiated with 10 μmall-trans-retinoic acid (RA, Sigma) for 0, 2, 8, 24, and 96 h. The neuroblastoma cell lines (IMR-32, LA-N-1, LA-N-2, and LA-N-5) and the Chinese hamster ovary cell line (CHO) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). The rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 was grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Total cell homogenates were prepared in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 137 mm NaCl, and 4% complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Using 40 μg of protein per lane, we performed SDS-PAGE and then blotted to PVDF filters (Immobilon). The filters were probed with polyclonal anti-Id1 or anti-Id3 antisera (Santa Cruz) diluted 1:1000 or polyclonal anti-Id2 antiserum (Santa Cruz) diluted 1:200. HES-1 and HASH-1 were detected with polyclonal anti-HES-1 antiserum (kindly provided by Dr. Tetsuo Sudo (20Kaneta M. Osawa M. Sudo K. Nakauchi H. Farr A.G. Takahama Y. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 256-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar)) diluted 1:8000 and a monoclonal anti-MASH-1 antibody (Pharmingen) diluted 1:125. Fusion proteins containing VP16, GAL4, and EGFP domains were, respectively, detected with a monoclonal anti-VP16 antibody (Santa Cruz), a monoclonal anti-GAL4-DNA-binding domain antibody (Santa Cruz), and a polyclonal anti-GFP antiserum (CLONTECH). Immunoreactivity was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Mammalian two-hybrid analyses were performed using the Checkmate system (Promega). Constructs encoding VP16 transactivating (pACT) and GAL4-DNA-binding (pBIND) proteins were created by cloning PCR-generated fragments intoBamHI/SalI-digested vectors. The fragments comprised the following amino acids: dHAND, 1–217; E2-2, 1–668; E47, 508–654 (spanning the bHLH region); HASH-1, 1–180; HES-1, 90–281; Id1, 1–154; Id2, 1–134; Id3, 1–119; Id4, 1–162. The pBIND-MyoD vector was provided in the Checkmate kit (Promega). The pG5luc reporter plasmid contains five GAL4-binding sites upstream of the coding sequence for firefly luciferase. The pMACT vector also encodes renilla luciferase downstream of a constitutively active cytomegalovirus promoter, hence it was possible to use a Dual Luciferase kit (Promega) for both luminometric measurement of the interaction and determination of transfection efficiency. The analyses were done on CHO cells (1.5 × 105 per 35-mm dish), which were transfected with the appropriate vectors and the pG5luc reporter (0.6 μg of each plasmid per dish) using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). The experiments were performed in triplicate, and the results were recorded as the relative luciferase activity (i.e. the ratio of firefly luciferase activity to renilla luciferase activity). The expression plasmids were sequenced, and expression of all proteins was verified by Western blot analysis. The mammalian two-hybrid system was also employed to assess the ability of HES-1 and Id2 to interfere with the formation of bHLH dimers in a dominant-negative manner. CHO cells were co-transfected with pACT-E2-2 and pBIND-HASH-1 or pBIND-Id2 (0.2 μg of each plasmid per dish), along with increasing amounts of pMYC-HES-1 or pEGFP-Id2 (0.2–0.8 μg of plasmid per dish). The total amount of DNA was equalized with either pMYC or pEGFP. The pMYC-HES-1 and pEGFP-Id2 were made as described above, but, for HES-1, the full-length sequence (amino acids 1–281) was used. The results are given as percentage of the initial activity. The following expression plasmids were used: pBIND-HASH-1, pBIND-HES-1, pBIND-Id2, pBIND-E2–2, pBIND-E47, pEGFP-HASH-1, and pEGFP-HES-1. To make pEGFP-HASH-1 (amino acids 1–238) and pEGFP-HES-1 (amino acids 1–281), PCR-generated fragments were inserted into aBamHI/XhoI-digested pEGFP-C2 vector (CLONTECH). All transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE according to the recommendations of the manufacturer (Invitrogen). CHO cells were plated (1 × 106cells/100-mm dish) and transfected with 5 μg of total DNA. Sixteen hours after transfections, total cell lysates were prepared in modified RIPA buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 4% complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). The lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min to remove debris and then precleared with protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) for 10 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitations were performed with a monoclonal anti-GAL4-DNA-binding domain antibody. The immune complexes were recovered on protein G-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C and then washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline. The precipitated proteins were resuspended in sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, fractionated by SDS-PAGE on a 12.5% gel, and thereafter blotted to a PVDF filter. The filter was incubated with polyclonal anti-GFP antiserum diluted 1:100. Immunoreactivity was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). For co-immunoprecipitations of endogenous proteins, PC12 cells were plated (10 × 106 cells/100-mm dish), and cell lysates were prepared in modified RIPA buffer (as above). Immunoprecipitations were performed with 1 μg of polyclonal anti-Id1 antiserum (Santa Cruz) or 1 μg of rabbit immunoglobulin (negative control, Dako) for 1.5 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were precipitated with protein G-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C and then washed twice with modified RIPA buffer and twice with phosphate-buffered saline. The samples were separated by electrophoresis on a 12.5% acrylamide gel and the proteins were transferred to a PVDF filter. HES-1 was detected with polyclonal anti-HES-1 antiserum diluted 1:16,000, and Id1 with polyclonal anti-Id1 antiserum diluted 1:1000. Immunoreactivity was detected as described above. Using LipofectAMINE, pACT-HES-1 or pACT-Id2 were transfected into CHO cells seeded at a density of 1 × 106 cells/100-mm plate. Sixteen hours after transfection, the cells were harvested in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mmNa4P2O7, 50 mm NaF, and 5 μm ZnCl2 (pH 7.1), supplemented with 1% Triton X-100, 5% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and 6.7 mm dithiothreitol). Transcription and translation of Id2in vitro were carried out using a TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate kit (Promega) and the pACT-Id2 plasmid. DNA-binding reactions were done in a total volume of 35 μl containing 20 mmHEPES (pH 7.3), 50 mm KCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 8% glycerol, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 0.2 ng of32P-labeled wild type (wt) oligonucleotide (5′-CCGCCAGGCGCACGCACTGCAACAA-3′). Competition experiments were done with 175 ng of unlabeled wt oligonucleotide or 175 ng of N-box-mutated oligonucleotide (5′-CCGCCAGGCGACTAAGCTGCAACAA-3′). For supershift experiments, the cell extracts were preincubated with polyclonal anti-HES-1 antiserum (CeMines) for 10 min at room temperature. Thereafter, the labeled probe was added, and the samples were further incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Id2 translated in vitro or an equal amount of mock-translated rabbit reticulocyte lysate was mixed with protein extract from HES-1-transfected CHO cells, and the mixture was preincubated for 10 min at room temperature, after which the labeled probe was added. In the Id2 competition experiments, increasing amounts of cell extract from Id2-transfected CHO cells were mixed with constant amounts of cell extract from HES-1-transfected CHO cells and then preincubated for 10 min at room temperature. Cell extract from untransfected CHO cells was used as a negative control. The binding reactions were then subjected to electrophoresis on a 4% polyacrylamide gel (30:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide). The expression patterns of Id1, Id2, Id3, Id4, HASH-1, and HES-1 were analyzed at the protein level in neuroblastoma cell lines and in two other cell lines derived from related tumors, the rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 and the neuroepithelioma cell line SK-N-MC (Fig.1). The PC12 cells and all but one of the neuroblastoma cell lines (i.e. SH-SY5Y, IMR-32, LA-N-2, LA-N-1, and SK-N-BE (2Groves A.K. Bronner-Fraser M. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 221-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), but not LA-N-5) expressed detectable levels of HASH-1. HES-1 was clearly detected in PC12 and SK-N-MC cells, and low levels of this protein was also found in four neuroblastoma cell lines (SH-SY5Y, LA-N-5, LA-N-1, and SK-N-BE (2Groves A.K. Bronner-Fraser M. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 221-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar)). These results corroborated our previous mRNA data showing that there is an inverse correlation between HASH-1 and HES-1 expression in neuroblastoma cells and that HES-1, but notHASH-1, is expressed in SK-N-MC cells (17Grynfeld A. Pahlman S. Axelson H. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 88: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Varying levels of Id1 and Id2 were expressed in all neuroblastoma cell lines tested: high levels of Id1 in SH-SY5Y, IMR-32, LA-N-1, and SK-N-BE (2Groves A.K. Bronner-Fraser M. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 221-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar); and substantial expression of Id2 in LA-N-2 and SH-SY5Y (Fig. 1). All the neuroblastoma lines except IMR-32 and LA-N-1 expressed Id3 (Fig. 1), whereas none of the cell lines investigated expressed Id4 (data not shown). In many cell systems, Id expression decreases during differentiation (9Norton J.D. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3897-38905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To study the expression pattern of HASH-1, HES-1, and the Id proteins in differentiating neuroblastoma cells, we used two different cell systems: SH-SY5Y, which lacks N-mycamplification; and SK-N-BE (2Groves A.K. Bronner-Fraser M. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 221-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), in which each cell contains ∼85 copies of the N-myc gene (21Squire J.A. Thorner P.S. Weitzman S. Maggi J.D. Dirks P. Doyle J. Hale M. Godbout R. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1417-1422PubMed Google Scholar). The SH-SY5Y cells were induced to undergo robust and well characterized sympathetic neuronal differentiation by exposure to 16 nm TPA (22Påhlman S. Odelstad L. Larsson E. Grotte G. Nilsson K. Int. J. Cancer. 1981; 28: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 23Bjelfman C. Meyerson G. Cartwright C.A. Mellstrom K. Hammerling U. Påhlman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and the SK-N-BE (2Groves A.K. Bronner-Fraser M. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 221-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) cells were induced to differentiate with 10 μm RA, which led to a less distinct neuronal differentiation (17Grynfeld A. Pahlman S. Axelson H. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 88: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 18Söderholm H. Örtoft E. Johansson I. Ljungberg J. Larsson C. Axelson H. Påhlman S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Within 2 h of TPA treatment, the level of HES-1 in the SH-SY5Y cells reached a maximum, and there was a concurrent down-regulation of HASH-1 expression (Fig.2); neither of these proteins was detected after 96 h of differentiation. In accordance with these findings, we have previously studied the corresponding genes and observed a similar rapid down-regulation of HASH-1 at the mRNA level, with a concomitant transient up-regulation ofHES-1 (17Grynfeld A. Pahlman S. Axelson H. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 88: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In differentiating SH-SY5Y cells, the Id1 level remained constant up to 24 h, but had decreased markedly after 96 h (Fig. 2). By comparison, Id2 and Id3 were down-regulated more quickly: both showed a distinct decrease after only 8 h, and, after 96 h, Id3 was undetectable, and the level of Id2 was low (Fig. 2). After 2 h of differentiation induced by 10 μm RA, the SK-N-BE (2Groves A.K. Bronner-Fraser M. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 221-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) cells exhibited a decrease in the level of HASH-1, and this was accompanied by an increase in HES-1 (Fig.3). After 96 h, the former protein was barely detectable, and the level of HES-1 had decreased to baseline, which reflects our previously reported mRNA data (17Grynfeld A. Pahlman S. Axelson H. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 88: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The changes in Id levels that occurred in this cell line with progressing differentiation were not as marked as those observed in SH-SY5Y cells undergoing TPA-induced differentiation. Moreover, in the SK-N-BE (2Groves A.K. Bronner-Fraser M. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 221-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) cells, the level of Id1 was virtually constant, while the level of Id2 decreased to some extent, and there was a slight transient up-regulation of Id3 expression after 8 h (Fig. 3). Thus, the SK-N-BE (2Groves A.K. Bronner-Fraser M. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 221-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and SH-SY5Y cells were similar in regard to regulation of expression of HASH-1 and HES-1, but they exhibited slightly different Id expression patterns. We used the mammalian two-hybrid system to investigate the ability of the Id proteins to form complexes with bHLH transcription factors (24Dang C.V. Barrett J. Villa-Garcia M. Resar L.M. Kato G.J. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 954-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Expression plasmids encoding GAL4 fusion proteins of Id1 to Id4 and VP16 fusion proteins of a panel of bHLH transcription factors were constructed (Fig.4 A). Western blot analyses revealed that the levels of expression of the different fusion proteins were similar (Fig. 4, B and C). The modest variations that were noticeable were not correlated with the degree of reporter gene activation in the mammalian two-hybrid assays, as exemplified by HES-1 and dHAND (Fig. 4 B), as well as dHAND and Id1 (Fig. 4 C). As expected, there was a clear interaction between Id1 and the ubiquitously expressed E proteins E47 and E2-2 (Fig. 4 B). Comparable results were obtained with the Id2, Id3, and Id4 constructs (data not shown), and, in the subsequent mammalian two-hybrid experiments, all four Id proteins displayed similar capacities to interact with bHLH proteins. In agreement with previous reports (25Langlands K. Yin X. Anand G. Prochownik E.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19785-19793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 26Finkel T. Duc J. Fearon E.R. Dang C.V. Tomaselli G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we found that all four Id proteins interacted with MyoD (Fig. 4 B and data not shown). Moreover, although the four Id proteins did not form complexes with the tissue-specific proneuronal transcription factors dHAND and HASH-1, they did dimerize with HES-1 (Fig. 4 B and data not shown). The ability of HES-1 to dimerize with both the Id and the E proteins distinguished it from the other tissue-specific bHLH transcription factors we investigated. The difference between dHAND and HES-1 in regard to interaction capacity was further illustrated by coexpression of VP16-dHAND or VP16-HES-1 with GAL4 fusion proteins of a panel of HLH/bHLH factors. We thereby generated a “fingerprint” of the abilities of dHAND and HES-1 to interact with other proteins of the HLH network (Fig. 4, C and D). The background activity of each GAL4 fusion protein was assessed in combination with the empty pACT vector. These analyses highlighted the following characteristic difference in the interaction patterns of these two proteins: HES-1 formed complexes with the E and the Id proteins, whereas dHAND dimerized only with the E proteins. We extended the mammalian two-hybrid analyses to ascertain whether HES-1 and Id2 interfere with the formation of HLH dimers in a dominant-negative manner. Increasing amounts of HES-1 had no effect on dimerization between HASH-1 and E2-2 (Fig.5 A). In contrast, Id2 decreased the reporter gene activity even at the initial concentration we tested (Fig. 5 B). At this level, the EGFP-Id2 fusion protein was hardly detectable by Western blot analysis. This effect was most likely due to the formation of E2–2/Id2 dimers, since the Id proteins do not interact with HASH-1 (Fig. 4 B and data not shown). Accordingly, we investigated the effect of HES-1 on formation of the E2–2/Id2 dimer and discovered that reporter gene activation decreased with increasing amounts of HES-1 (Fig. 5 C). Theoretically, this may have been due to binding of either Id2 or E2-2 to HES-1. However, HES-1 did not affect the interaction between E2-2 and HASH-1 (Fig. 5 A), hence we suggest that this inhibitory effect of HES-1 was mainly the result of complex formation with Id2. Thus, in these experiments in vivo, HES-1 sequestered Id2 and in that way prevented it from dimerizing with the E protein E2-2. We performed co-immunoprecipitation assays to prove that HES-1 and Id proteins can interact in mammalian cells. CHO cells were transfected with expression plasmids for EGFP-tagged HES-1 or HASH-1 and GAL4-tagged Id2 (Fig.6 A), and Western blotting revealed that EGFP-HES-1 and EGFP-HASH-1 were expressed at similar levels (data not shown). Sixteen hours after transfection, the cells were lysed, and Id2 with associated proteins were immunoprecipitated with an anti-GAL4 antibody conjugated to protein G-Sepharose beads. The precipitates were subjected to Western blot analysis using a polyclonal anti-EGFP antiserum, which showed that HES-1, but not HASH-1, was co-immunoprecipitated with Id2 (Fig. 6 A). Use of an empty GAL4-expressing vector showed that the Id2 part of the fusion protein was necessary for co-immunoprecipitation to occur. We included the E proteins E2-2 and E47 as positive controls in these experiments. Our findings confirmed the results obtained using the mammalian two-hybrid system, that is, both E2-2 and E47 formed complexes with HES-1, whereas there was no detectable association between HASH-1 and HES-1 or between HASH-1 and Id2 (Fig. 6 A). Apparently, the amounts of HES-1 immunoprecipitated by Id2, E47, and E2-2, respectively, were to some extent correlated with the level of reporter gene"

https://openalex.org/W2061772847,"We previously isolated and characterized a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell mutant, ZPG207, that is defective in import of proteins carrying a peroxisome-targeting signal type 2 (PTS2) nonapeptide. Herein we have cloned Chinese hamster (<i>Cl</i>) <i>PEX7</i> encoding the PTS2 receptor. ClPex7p consists of 318 amino acids, shorter than human Pex7p by 5 residues, showing 91 and 30% identity with Pex7p from humans and the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, respectively. Expression of <i>ClPEX7</i> rescued the impaired PTS2 import in<i>pex7</i> ZPG207. Mutation in ZPG207 <i>PEX7</i> was determined by reverse transcription PCR; a G-to-A transition caused a 1-amino acid substitution, W221ter. We investigated the molecular dysfunction of Pex7p variants in mammals, including Pex7p-W221ter and Pex7p with one site mutation at G217R, A218V, or L292ter, which frequently occurs in the human fatal genetic peroxisomal disease rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata, showing a cell phenotype of PTS2 import defect. All types of the mutations affected Pex7p in binding to both PTS2 cargo protein and the longer isoform of PTS1 receptor Pex5pL that is responsible for transport of the Pex7p-PTS2 complex. Subcellular fractionation and protease protection studies demonstrated bimodal distribution of Pex7p between the cytoplasm and peroxisomes in CHO and human cells. Moreover, expression of Pex5pL, but not of the shorter isoform Pex5pS, enhanced translocation of Pex7p-PTS2 proteins into peroxisomes, thereby implying that both PTS receptors shuttle between peroxisomes and the cytosol. Furthermore, a ClPex7p mutant with a deletion of 7 amino acids from the N terminus retained peroxisome-restoring activity, whereas an 11-amino acid truncation abrogated the activity. ClPex7p with a C-terminal 9- amino acid truncation, comprising residues 1–309, maintained the activity, whereas a 14-amino acid shorter form lacking several amino acids of the sixth WD motif lost the activity. Therefore, nearly the full length of Pex7p, including all WD motifs, is required for its function."
https://openalex.org/W2001686449,"IEX-1, an immediate early gene, is widely expressed in epithelial and endothelial tissues, and is altered by a variety of growth regulatory factors. We have shown that expression of IEX-1 in keratinocytes increases the growth rate of these cells. The effects of IEX-1 on apoptosis, however, are unclear. To clarify the effects of IEX-1 on apoptosis, we investigated the effects of IEX-1 expression in keratinocytes (HaCaT cells) in the basal state and after the induction of cellular stress. Under normal, non-stressed conditions, both control (HaCaT) and IEX-1-transfected (IEX-HaCaT) cell lines showed no significant differences in the activity of a key apoptotic enzyme, caspase 3 despite significantly higher levels of IEX-1 expression. IEX-HaCaT cells grew faster than HaCaT cells. When both cell lines were irradiated with ultraviolet B radiation, caspase 3 activity increased to a greater extent in the IEX-HaCaT cells than in HaCaT cells. Camptothecin increased caspase 3 activity twice as much in the IEX-HaCaT cells when compared to HaCaT cells. When histone-complex DNA fragments were measured in IEX-HaCaT or HaCaT cells following UVB irradiation or treatment with camptothecin, significantly higher amounts of nucleosomes were seen in the IEX-HaCaT transfected cells. Likewise, serum deprivation induced higher degrees of apoptosis in IEX-HaCaT cells than in HaCaT cells. We conclude that overexpression of IEX-1 in HaCaT keratinocytes increases the growth rate of cells under basal conditions; in the basal state the rate of apoptosis is unchanged. However, the rate of apoptosis increases in IEX-1 overexpressing HaCaT keratinocytes after cells are subjected to stress."
https://openalex.org/W2063398239,"Opening of the NMDA receptor channel requires simultaneous binding of glutamate and glycine. Although the binding sites for each agonist are in different subunits, the presence of one agonist influences the binding of the other. We have localized regions in the S1 binding domain of both subunits required for the transmission of allosteric signals from the glutamate binding NR2A subunit to the glycine binding NR1 subunit. Three-dimensional modeling indicates that these segments are not directly involved in ligand binding, but likely form solvent-accessible loops protruding out of the binding pocket, making them suitable to relay interactions between adjacent subunits. Thus, these segments mediate negative allosteric coupling between the two subunit types that form the NMDA receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2129113721,"The primary visual cortex (V1) of higher mammals contains maps of stimulus features; how these maps influence vision remains unknown. We have examined the functional significance of an asymmetry in the orientation map in cat V1, i.e., the fact that a larger area of V1 is preferentially activated by vertical and horizontal contours than by contours at oblique orientations. Despite the fact that neurons tuned to cardinal and oblique orientations have indistinguishable tuning characteristics, cardinal neurons remain more stable in their response properties after selective perturbation induced by adaptation. Similarly, human observers report different adaptation-induced changes in orientation tuning between cardinal and oblique axes. We suggest that the larger cortical area devoted to cardinal orientations imposes stability on the processing of cardinal contours during visual perception, by retaining invariant cortical responses along cardinal axes."

To identify the binding site of these phosphate esters, we took advantage of the homology of GKRP to the isomerase domain of GlmS (glucosamine-6-phosphatesynthase) and created 12 different mutants of rat GKRP. Mutations of three residues predicted to bind to Fru-6-P resulted in proteins that were ∼5-fold (S110A) and 50-fold (S179A and K514A) less potent as inhibitors of glucokinase and had an at least 100-fold reduced affinity for the effectors. Mutation of another residue of the putative binding site (T109A) resulted in a 10-fold decrease in the inhibitory power and an inversion of the effect of sorbitol-6-P, a Fru-6-P analog. The replacement of Gly107, a residue close to the binding site, by cysteine (as in GlmS andXenopus GKRP) resulted in a protein that had 20 times more affinity for Fru-6-P and 30 times less affinity for Fru-1-P. These results are consistent with GKRP having one single binding site for phosphate esters. They also show that a missense mutation of GKRP can lead to a gain of function.

Diabetologia. 1993; 36: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 2Iynedjian P.B. Biochem.

This role is best illustrated by the fact that mutations that make glucokinase less active or less stable cause maturity onset diabetes of the young type 2 (MODY2), a form of dominantly inherited diabetes (5Vionnet N. Stoffel M. Takeda J. Yasuda K. Bell G.I. Zouali H. Lesage S. Velho G. Iris F. Passa P. Froguel P. Cohen D. Nature. 1992; 356: 721-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 6Velho G. Froguel P.

In hepatocytes, glucokinase activity is acutely regulated by a glucokinase regulatory protein (GKRP),1 which binds to this enzyme and inhibits it competitively with respect to glucose (7Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 8Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J.

Veiga-da-Cunha M. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 414-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Physiologically, the interaction between glucokinase and GKRP is modulated by Fru-6-P, which binds to GKRP, promoting the association of the two proteins, and by Fru-1-P, a metabolite of fructose that promotes the dissociation of the complex (11Vandercammen A. Detheux M. Van Schaftingen E. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Through this mechanism, fructose, which is converted to Fru-1-P, stimulates glucose phosphorylation in the liver (8Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 12Clark D.G. Filsell O.H. Topping D.L. Biochem. J. 1979; 184: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 13Davies D.R.

J. 1995; 308: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It is thought that Fru-6-P (as well as its more powerful analog, sorbitol-6-P) and Fru-1-P act by inducing different conformational changes in GKRP (15Detheux M. Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Both phosphate esters bind competitively to the protein, but it is not yet clear, despite studies with analogs, if they bind to a common site or to two distinct sites that cannot be occupied simultaneously (15Detheux M. Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). GKRP is mainly located in the nucleus, whereas glucokinase is mainly present in the nucleus at low glucose concentrations and in the absence of fructose, but moves to the cytoplasm upon addition of fructose or of elevated concentrations of glucose (16Agius L. Peak M. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 785-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 17Toyoda Y. Miwa I. Kamiya M. Ogiso S. Nonogaki T. Aoki S. Okuda J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Due to the ability of GKRP to inhibit glucokinase, it has been postulated that mutations in the gene encoding this protein may cause diabetes if such mutations increase the inhibition, e.g. by suppressing the “de-inhibitory” effect of Fru-1-P (1Randle P.J. Diabetologia. 1993; 36: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 23Van Schaftingen E. Diabetologia. 1993; 36: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 24Vaxillaire M. Vionnet N.

It is therefore of interest to determine whether there are one or two binding sites for the phosphate esters in GKRP and which residues interact with these effectors. To guide such studies, two different observations can be exploited. The first one is that GKRP found in lower vertebrates, unlike its mammalian counterpart, is insensitive to Fru-6-P and Fru-1-P, inhibiting the enzyme even in the absence of these phosphate esters (26Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding Xenopus GKRP has been cloned and shown to encode a protein with 58% identity to rat liver GKRP (27Veiga-da-Cunha M. Detheux M. Watelet N. Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A comparison of the sequences of these two proteins may therefore allow identification of residues that potentially interact with Fru-6-P and Fru-1-P. The second observation of interest is that GKRPs (whether the fructose phosphate-sensitive or -insensitive forms) are homologous to bacterial open reading frames of unknown function (Yfeu) as well as to a number of other proteins, including the isomerase domain of GlmS (glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase) (28Van Schaftingen E. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Niculescu L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This enzyme converts Fru-6-P into GlcN-6-P or Glu-6-P depending on the presence or absence of glutamine (29Teplyakov A. Obmolova G. Badet-Denisot M.A. Badet B. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 596-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the isomerase domain of GlmS is known (30Teplyakov A. Obmolova G. Badet-Denisot M.A. Badet B. Polikarpov I. Structure. 1998; 6: 1047-1055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and the residues that interact with the substrate Fru-6-P have been identified. They lie at the interface of two subdomains with similar topology, known as SIS (sugar isomerase) domains (31Bateman A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 94-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The objective of this work was to identify the regions in GKRP that are responsible for its interaction with Fru-6-P and Fru-1-P. For this purpose, we mutated residues that potentially interact with Fru-6-P based on the homology of Yfeu to GKRPs and GlmS or on the sequence comparison between Fru-6-P-sensitive and -insensitive GKRPs. The sources of materials were as previously reported (32Veiga-da-Cunha M. Courtois S. Michel A. Gosselain E. Van Schaftingen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6292-6297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 33Veiga-da-Cunha M. Xu L.Z. Lee Y.H. Marotta D. Pilkis S.J. Van Schaftingen E. Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 1173-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Recombinant human islet glucokinase was expressed and purified as described (34Moukil M.A. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Van Schaftingen E. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Mutants of rat liver GKRP were prepared with a PCR-based technique using back-to-back primers (32Veiga-da-Cunha M. Courtois S. Michel A. Gosselain E. Van Schaftingen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6292-6297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and Pwo polymerase, an enzyme with proofreading activity. PCR was performed with the primers shown in TableI using the expression vector of rat liver GKRP (pET-GKRP) as a template. This plasmid, derived from pET3a (35Studier F.W. Moffat B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar), contains the entire coding sequence of wild-type rat liver GKRP flanked at its 5′-end by an NdeI site (containing the initiator ATG) and at its 3′-end by a BamHI site. The reaction was carried out in the presence of 1.3% Me2SO and with an elongation time of 6 min at 72 °C to increase the yield of the PCR product with the expected size (≈6.5 kb). After PCR amplification, the linear plasmids were phosphorylated, recircularized, and cloned in Escherichia coli JM109. Plasmids that had incorporated the desired mutation could be distinguished from the wild-type plasmid by restriction analysis (Table I); they were further sequenced to rule out any PCR errors. The mutant plasmids were used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS for expression of the recombinant proteins (35Studier F.W. Moffat B.A. J. Mol.

For the expression of both wild-type and mutant GKRPs, 40-ml precultures of the bacteria bearing the appropriate plasmids were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB medium containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin and 0.03 mg/ml chloramphenicol. The precultures were then used to inoculate 1 liter of M9 salts medium containing 1% glucose, 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin, and 0.03 mg/ml chloramphenicol. The cultures were incubated in an orbital shaker at 37 °C until A 600 = 0.6 and then chilled on ice before addition of the inducer isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.4 mm). After a further incubation of 60 h at 18 °C in an orbital shaker, the bacteria were isolated by centrifugation, and extracts (50 ml) were prepared (27Veiga-da-Cunha M. Detheux M. Watelet N. Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For the purification of recombinant GKRPs, polyethylene glycol 6000 was added to a final concentration of 22%. After gentle mixing for 20 min at 4 °C, the preparation was centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 12,000 ×g, and the clear supernatant was eliminated. The pellet was dissolved in 15 ml of buffer A (25 mm Hepes (pH 7.1), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 μg/ml each antipain and leupeptin) and chromatographed on a 1.6 × 13-cm DEAE-Sepharose column equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with 100 ml of buffer A, and the proteins retained were eluted with a 0–0.5m NaCl gradient (in 2× 100 ml of buffer A). The fractions collected (2.5 ml) were tested for their ability to inhibit recombinant human liver glucokinase in the presence of 5 mm glucose and 200 μm Fru-6-P (7Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Total protein was measured according to Bradford (36Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215608) Google Scholar) using bovine γ-globulin as a standard. The chromatographic step allowed the separation of GKRP from enzymes that interfered in the assay by causing a high “blank” value. As a rule, only the three fractions (≈7 ml) that were the richest in GKRP (identified through its inhibitory effect and/or by the presence of an ≈68-kDa polypeptide) were pooled and used for further studies. For most of the proteins, this pool contained 1–2.5 mg/ml GKRP (depending on the amount of soluble GKRP expressed). The DEAE-Sepharose pools from mutants S179A and K499A were concentrated by ∼3-fold in an Amicon pressure cell equipped with a YM-10 membrane to obtain a preparation with a similar GKRP concentration. The purity of GKRP in the DEAE pools was estimated to be between 60 and 90% by densitometric analysis of SDS-polyacrylamide gels (performed with the NIH Image program). 2Available at rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/. The concentration of GKRP was calculated by multiplying the total concentration of protein by this purity factor. GKRP was assayed by its ability to inhibit glucokinase in the presence of 5 mm glucose and the indicated concentrations of Fru-6-P, sorbitol-6-P, or Fru-1-P using a pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase-coupled assay (8Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Recombinant human liver glucokinase was used instead of rat liver glucokinase because both proteins have virtually identical properties, including their affinity for GKRP (33Veiga-da-Cunha M. Xu L.Z. Lee Y.H. Marotta D. Pilkis S.J. Van Schaftingen E. Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 1173-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The dissociation constants for the complexes formed between GKRP and Fru-6-P or sorbitol-6-P were derived from plots (15Detheux M. Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) relating the effect of these phosphate esters on the activity of glucokinase in the presence of GKRP. The dissociation constants for the GKRP·Fru-1-P complexes were computed from saturation curves describing the effect of Fru-1-P on the activity of glucokinase in the presence of Fru-6-P and GKRP, taking into account the dissociation constant of the GKRP·Fru-6-P complex (15Detheux M. Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The coding sequence of Hemophilus influenzae Yfeu was amplified by PCR using Pwo polymerase and a plasmid (GHIDB10) containing the appropriate region of the genome (kindly provided by The Institute of Genomic Research, Rockville, MD) as a template. The 5′-end primer (CATATGGATGACATTATATTA) contained the ATG codon (boldface) in an NdeI restriction site (underlined), and the 3′-end primer (GGATCC TTATTTAGAAAGCGCATTTCT) contained the stop codon (boldface) flanked by a BamHI restriction site (underlined). The ≈0.93-kb amplification product was first ligated in the EcoRV restriction site of pBluescript, sequenced to confirm the nucleotide sequence, and cloned in the NdeI andBamHI restriction sites of the expression vector pET3a (pET-Yfeu). Recombinant Yfeu was expressed at 22 °C in E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS cells harboring pET-Yfeu as described above for GKRP. The presence of a soluble and abundant polypeptide with a molecular mass of ≈31 kDa was detected on SDS-polyacrylamide gels only in the bacteria that harbored pET-Yfeu. SDS-PAGE was therefore used to identify Yfeu in the course of the purification. Yfeu was purified by polyethylene glycol 6000 precipitation (which was carried out at pH 6.7 to facilitate precipitation) and DEAE-Sepharose chromatography as described for GKRP. Four fractions (10 ml) containing Yfeu were pooled, concentrated by ∼4-fold in an Amicon pressure cell equipped with a YM-10 membrane, and applied to a Sephacryl S-200 column (1.6 × 50 cm) equilibrated in buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl. The collected fractions (3 ml) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and Yfeu was judged to be >90% pure in the eight fractions that were pooled. From 1 liter of culture, we purified ∼70 mg of Yfeu. For determination of the molecular mass, 0.5 mg of purified Yfeu was applied to the Sephacryl S-200 column together with aldolase (160 kDa), phosphoglucose isomerase (110 kDa), glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (68 kDa), and cytochrome c (13.5 kDa). The dimerization of Yfeu was confirmed using the glutaraldehyde/NaBH4cross-linking method as described by White et al. (37White M.F. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For these experiments, 10, 30, and 50 μg of purified Yfeu were added to 0.5 ml of Hepes (pH 7.1) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. After cross-linking, the proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid in the presence of deoxycholate, resuspended in electrophoresis loading buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Fig. 1shows the alignment of rat, human, and Xenopus GKRPs with bacterial proteins of the Yfeu family. These bacterial proteins contain conserved motifs that align better either with the amino- or carboxyl-terminal half of GKRPs. For instance, the sequence GXGTSGR (residues 75–81 in Yfeu) is conserved in the amino-terminal half, whereas the motif D(A/G)XECXXT(Y/F) (residues 86–94 in Yfeu) is conserved in the carboxyl-terminal half. Similarly, the motif GPEXX(S/T)GS(S/T)RXK (residues 191–202 in Yfeu) is conserved in the amino-terminal half of GKRP, whereas the neighboring motif GKXXXNXM(V/L)DXXXXNXKL (residues 223–240) is conserved in the carboxyl-terminal half. This alternation in the conservation of the motifs is in agreement with the fact that the identity between the amino- and carboxyl-terminal halves of GKRPs is very low. Psi-Blast searches (38Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59753) Google Scholar) indicated that Yfeu is homologous to the isomerase domain of GlmS (28Van Schaftingen E. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Niculescu L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), which, like GKRP, binds Fru-6-P. The crystal structure of this enzyme (29Teplyakov A. Obmolova G. Badet-Denisot M.A. Badet B. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 596-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 30Teplyakov A. Obmolova G. Badet-Denisot M.A. Badet B. Polikarpov I. Structure. 1998; 6: 1047-1055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) reveals that it contains two SIS subdomains (31Bateman A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 94-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), each of which has an αβ-structure consisting of a five-stranded parallel β-sheet with connecting α-helices (schematized in Fig. 2; see also Fig. 2 of Ref. 30Teplyakov A. Obmolova G. Badet-Denisot M.A. Badet B. Polikarpov I. Structure. 1998; 6: 1047-1055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The binding site for the Hex-6-P substrate lies at the interface of the two subdomains and is made up of six peptide segments: three (motifs A–C in Fig. 2) in SIS domain 1, one (motif D) in SIS domain 2, and one (motif E) in the carboxyl-terminal loop; because GlmS is a dimeric protein, the sixth peptide segment (a KHG motif) (30Teplyakov A. Obmolova G. Badet-Denisot M.A. Badet B. Polikarpov I. Structure. 1998; 6: 1047-1055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) is contributed by the other subunit (not shown in Fig. 2). These peptide segments are, as expected, extremely conserved in the GlmS proteins, and we have tried to align them with well conserved motifs in GKRPs and Yfeu (Fig. 1). For motifs A–C, these alignments are based on Psi-Blast searches with Yfeu, and for motifs A and E, on the MatchBox algorithm (39Depiereux E. Baudoux G. Briffeuil P. De Reginster I. Bolle X. Vinals C. Feytmans E. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1997; 13: 249-256PubMed Google Scholar). Motif D is tentatively aligned with a well conserved region in Yfeu and in the carboxyl-terminal half of GKRP. No candidate was found for the sixth motif (KHG), in relation to the fact that GKRP is a monomeric protein. These alignments allowed us to predict residues of rat GKRP that could potentially interact through their side chain with Fru-6-P and other ligands. Some of these (Thr109, Ser110, Ser179, and Lys514) were mutated to alanine. We mutated also to alanine other well conserved residues that were not expected to bind directly to Fru-6-P; these residues are either inside (Asp507) or outside (Thr337, Thr411, and Lys499) these motifs. Furthermore, the alignments allowed us to identify a few residues that are conserved in mammalian GKRPs as well as in Yfeu, but that are different in Xenopus GKRP (which is not sensitive to phosphate esters). These were mutated to the corresponding residues in the Xenopus protein (mutations G99D/G100S, G107C, and V180C). All mutant proteins, as well as wild-type rat GKRP, were produced in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS. Under the conditions used for expression, all mutant GKRPs were at least partially soluble. The amount of soluble recombinant GKRP present in the bacterial lysates averaged 10 mg/liter of culture, but some mutations increased (G107C, T109A, and S110A) or decreased (S179A, K499A, and D507A) this yield by 2–3-fold. The proteins were purified, and the following properties were investigated: 1) ability to inhibit glucokinase in the presence of a saturating concentration of Fru-6-P (Fig.3), 2) sensitivity to Fru-6-P (Fig.4) and to sorbitol-6-P in the presence of a fixed concentration of GKRP, and 3) sensitivity to Fru-1-P in the presence of a fixed concentration of GKRP and Fru-6-P (Fig.5). K d values for Fru-6-P and Fru-1-P were calculated according to Ref. 15Detheux M. Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar; these values are independent of the GKRP concentration and, in the case of theK d for Fru-1-P, also independent of the Fru-6-P concentration. A summary of these data is shown in TableII.Figure 4Effect of Fru-6-P on the activity of glucokinase in the presence of wild-type and mutant GKRPs.Glucokinase (GK) activity was measured in the presence of 5 μg/ml GKRP, 5 mm glucose, and the indicated concentrations of Fru-6-P.

The three mutations made in motif A (G107C, T109A, and S110A), one of the two mutations made in motif B (S179A), and the two mutations made in motif E (K499A and D507A) dramatically affected the properties of GKRP. For the alanine substitutions, these effects consisted of a 5-fold (S110A and D507A), 10-fold (T109A), or 50-fold (S179A and K514A) decrease in the affinity for glucokinase (Fig. 3), combined with a complete (K514A) or partial (S110A, S179A, and D507A) loss of effect of Fru-6-P, a decrease in the apparent affinity for this phosphate ester (T109A, S110A, and S179A), and an increase in the effect of GKRP in the absence of Fru-6-P in the case of mutant S110A (Fig. 4 and TableII). The decrease in the apparent affinity for Fru-6-P observed with mutants S110A, S179A, and K514A was paralleled by similar changes in the affinity for sorbitol-6-P and Fru-1-P (Fig. 5 and Table II). Remarkably, mutation T109A caused an inversion of the effect of sorbitol-6-P, which no longer reinforced the inhibition exerted by GKRP, but quite to the contrary, suppressed it (Fig.6). No such effect was observed with other mutants. Mutation G107C (a “Xenopus ” mutation) in motif A did not affect the affinity of GKRP for glucokinase, but caused a marked increase in the affinity for Fru-6-P and sorbitol-6-P and a marked decrease in the affinity for Fru-1-P (Figs. 4 and 5). Other mutations (G99D/G100S, V180C, T411A, and K499A) had little effect, with the exception of T337A (close to, but outside motif D), which most increased the inhibition exerted by GKRP in the absence of Fru-6-P while decreasing by 1.6–5-fold the affinity for the investigated phosphate esters (Fig. 4). V180C decreased the affinity for Fru-1-P by ∼3-fold, whereas the double mutant G107C/V180C had properties similar to those of the single mutant G107C (Table II). Because the bacterial homolog of GKRP contains only one SIS domain and two such domains are needed to form a binding site, it was of interest to determine the subunit composition of this protein. Yfeu, the H. influenzae homolog of GKRP, was expressed in E. coli and purified by polyethylene glycol 6000 precipitation and DEAE-Sepharose chromatography to near homogeneity. The molecular size of the purified protein was determined by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200. As shown in Fig. 7, the protein almost coeluted with glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, indicating a molecular mass of ≈68 kDa and therefore a dimeric structure. This dimeric structure was confirmed by cross-linking experiments using glutaraldehyde, followed by reduction with sodium borohydride and analysis by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Sequence comparisons indicate that GKRP belongs to the SIS protein family, as does GlmS, a protein for which the three-dimensional structure is known. Based on this distant homology, we have tried to identify residues in GKRP that bind Fru-6-P and other phosphate esters. Replacement of four residues predicted to interact with Fru-6-P through their side chains (T109A, S110A, S179A, and K514A) resulted in a marked decrease in the ability of the resultant proteins to inhibit glucokinase. For three of them (S110A, S179A, and K514A), this change was accompanied by a large decrease in the affinity for Fru-6-P, which may account for the decreased inhibition of glucokinase. By comparison, smaller effects, if any, were observed with other mutants (with the exception of mutant T337A; see below). These data therefore confirm that GKRP belongs to the SIS protein family and that the binding site for phosphate esters lies at the interface of the two SIS domains, as in GlmS. Although the closest homolog of GKRP contains only one SIS domain per polypeptide chain, its dimeric structure (indicated by gel filtration and cross-linking experiments) suggests that it has two binding sites for its physiological ligand(s), each consisting of motifs A–C in one subunit and motifs D and E in the other one. Such architecture accounts for the fact that the five conserved motifs that are distributed between the two SIS subdomains of GKRP are present in one single SIS domain in the case of Yfeu. Fru-6-P and Fru-1-P act in a competitive manner on mammalian GKRP (7Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 15Detheux M. Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Kinetic experiments using analogs of both compounds did not allow discrimination between models with one or two binding sites for these phosphate esters (15Detheux M. Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The presence of one single binding site is now supported by the finding of a significant structural homology between GKRP and GlmS and by the fact that most mutations affect the affinity for Fru-6-P, sorbitol-6-P, and Fru-1-P in parallel. It is also consistent with the fact that sorbitol-6-P behaves like Fru-6-P with wild-type GKRP and most mutants, but like Fru-1-P in the case of mutant T109A. It has been postulated that Fru-6-P and Fru-1-P bind to two different conformations of GKRP, only one of which is able to form a heterodimer with glucokinase. The position of the binding site for these phosphate esters at the interface between the two SIS subdomains suggests that the two conformations could differ from each other by the relative disposition of the two SIS subdomains. This hypothesis is consistent with the effect of mutation T337A, which increased the effect of GKRP in the absence of Fru-6-P, presumably by favoring the conformation of GKRP able to bind to glucokinase. Thr337 is predicted to be in helix CD (see Figs. 1 and 2), which is at the interface with the other SIS subdomain (30Teplyakov A. Obmolova G. Badet-Denisot M.A. Badet B. Polikarpov I. Structure. 1998; 6: 1047-1055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The mechanism proposed above implies that there are two binding sites for glucokinase on GKRP, one per SIS subdomain. This is consistent with site-directed mutagenesis studies of glucokinase indicating that this enzyme binds to GKRP through two distinct regions located on the tip of the smaller domain and on the hinge region (32Veiga-da-Cunha M. Courtois S. Michel A. Gosselain E. Van Schaftingen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6292-6297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 34Moukil M.A. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Van Schaftingen E. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This study did not allow us to identify the GKRP residues that directly interact with glucokinase. However, using a phage display approach, Baltrusch et al. (40Baltrusch S. Lenzen S. Okar D. Lange A.J. Tiedge M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43915-43923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) recently identified a peptide that binds glucokinase with high affinity. This peptide shares with GKRP an LSAXXVAG motif, which is conserved in rat, human, and Xenopus GKRPs (residues 182–189), but not in Yfeu and other bacterial homologs. This putative binding site is next to motif B, in a region corresponding to the first residues of helix NF in the three-dimensional structure of GlmS. While trying to identify the residues that makeXenopus GKRP insensitive to phosphate esters, we have created a mutation (G107C) that causes a marked increase in the affinity for Fru-6-P and sorbitol-6-P while decreasing the affinity for Fru-1-P. The equivalent residue in GlmS is an extremely conserved cysteine, which interacts with the substrate through main-chain atoms (see Table II). The G107C mutation could act in GKRP by narrowing the phosphate ester-binding site, thereby decreasing the affinity for the ligand with the bulkier conformation (β-pyranose in Fru-1-P) while increasing the affinity for the ligands with more compact (furanose in Fru-6-P) or more flexible (sorbitol-6-P) conformations. Combining the G107C mutation with another Xenopus mutation (V180C) introducing a cysteine residue in the neighborhood of Cys107 did not result in a loss of sensitivity to Fru-6-P and Fru-1-P. The insensitivity of Xenopus GKRP to phosphate esters must therefore be due to other amino acid changes. Mutation G107C leads to a protein that could behave in vivoas a super-inhibitor of glucokinase because it is much more sensitive to the physiological ligand (Fru-6-P) that increases its affinity for glucokinase and much less sensitive to the ligand (Fru-1-P) that decreases its affinity for glucokinase. This mutation (or any mutation with similar effects) could result in some degree of glucose intolerance due to increased inhibition of liver glucokinase, an enzyme known to play an important role in blood glucose homeostasis. Overexpression of glucokinase in the liver in transgenic mouse models (41Ferre T. Riu E. Bosch F. Valera A. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1213-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 42Hariharan N.

Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2022-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) results in decreased blood glucose and insulin concentrations and improves glucose tolerance. Furthermore, mice that lack glucokinase only in the liver are mildly hyperglycemic and display pronounced defects in both glycogen synthesis and glucose turnover rates during a hyperglycemic clamp (44Postic C.

Chem. 1999; 274: 305-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). However, the effect of a mutation that reinforces the inhibition exerted by GKRP is difficult to predict. Mouse GKRP-null mutants have a decreased level of glucokinase without significant change in the mRNA encoding this protein (45Farrelly D. Brown K.S. Tieman A. Ren J. Lira S.A. Hagan D. Gregg R.

The mechanism of this effect is not well understood, although it appears that GKRP may stabilize glucokinase by sequestering it in the nucleus. A mutation that reinforces the effect of GKRP could therefore result in a compensatory increase in the amount of glucokinase without significant perturbation or even with a slight improvement of glucose tolerance. Accordingly, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of GKRP was recently shown to improve glucose tolerance in a mouse model of type II diabetes (47Slosberg E.D. Desai U.J. Fanelli B. St. Denny I.

The mutants that we have produced may be helpful to understand the effect of GKRP on glucokinase expression, most particularly to determine whether the interaction between glucokinase and GKRP is essential for this effect.

A constellation of conserved amino acids (Arg-130, Lys-167, Arg-223, and His-265 in vaccinia topoisomerase) catalyzes the attack of the tyrosine nucleophile (Tyr-274) at the scissile phosphodiester. Previous studies implicated Arg-223 and His-265 in transition state stabilization and Lys-167 in proton donation to the 5′-O of the leaving DNA strand. Here we find that Arg-130 also plays a major role in leaving group expulsion. The rate of DNA cleavage by vaccinia topoisomerase mutant R130K, which was slower than wild-type topoisomerase by a factor of 10−4.3, was stimulated 2600-fold by a 5′-bridging phosphorothiolate at the cleavage site. The catalytic defect of the R130A mutant was also rescued by the 5′-S modification (190-fold stimulation), albeit to a lesser degree than R130K. We surmise that Arg-130 plays dual roles in transition state stabilization and general acid catalysis. Whereas the R130A mutation abolishes both functions, R130K permits the transition state stabilization function (via contact of lysine with the scissile phosphate) but not the proton transfer function. Our results show that the process of general acid catalysis is complex and suggest that Lys-167 and Arg-130 comprise a proton relay from the topoisomerase to the 5′-O of the leaving DNA strand.

Type IB DNA topoisomerases relax DNA supercoils via a reaction pathway entailing noncovalent binding of the enzyme to duplex DNA, cleavage of one DNA strand with formation of a covalent DNA-(3′-phosphotyrosyl)-protein intermediate, strand passage, and strand religation (1Shuman S.

Mutational, stereochemical, and structural data for vaccinia and nuclear topoisomerase IB and tyrosine recombinases suggest that the two arginines and the histidine contact the nonbridging oxygens of the scissile phosphodiester and that these interactions serve to stabilize a proposed pentacoordinate phosphorane transition state (3Redinbo M.R.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5561-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).Recently we used 5′-bridging phosphorothiolate-modified DNAs to implicate Lys-167 of vaccinia topoisomerase as a general acid catalyst of the DNA cleavage reaction (14Krogh B.O. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 1035-1041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The hypothesis was that if the expulsion of the 5′-oxygen of the leaving DNA strand was indeed catalyzed by a general acid on the topoisomerase, then the requirement for the general acid ought to be alleviated by introducing a 5′-bridging phosphorothiolate at the scissile phosphodiester because the pK a of the DNA 5′-SH is ∼5 log units lower than that of the DNA 5′-OH. Accordingly the diagnostic feature of a topoisomerase mutant defective in general acid catalysis would be a significant increase in the cleavage rate on a 5′-S substrate compared with a 5′-O substrate. The “sulfur/oxygen ratio” ought not to increase for topoisomerase mutants that are impaired in other aspects of transesterification chemistry (e.g. transition state stabilization). Our findings were that that the 5′-S group restored activity to the catalytically defective K167A mutant, whereas there was no positive thiolate effect for mutants R223A and H265A (14Krogh B.O. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 1035-1041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Thus, we concluded that Lys-167 functions in proton transfer to the leaving strand. Lys-167 is located in a flexible interstrand hairpin loop of vaccinia topoisomerase and is conserved in all known type IB topoisomerases and tyrosine recombinases.Our earlier experiments did not address whether Arg-130 plays any role in leaving strand expulsion. Arg-130, which is invariant among type IB topoisomerases and tyrosine recombinases, enhances the transesterification rate of vaccinia topoisomerase by 5 orders of magnitude as gauged by the effect of the R130A mutation (10Petersen B.Ø. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3891-3896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Because a conservative R130K substitution had little restorative effect, it was surmised that multivalent contacts of the guanidinium nitrogens of Arg-130 with the scissile phosphodiester are essential for catalysis. The occurrence of either one or two hydrogen bonding contacts between this conserved arginine side chain and the DNA backbone in various crystal structures of topoisomerase IB and tyrosine recombinases (3Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 5Guo F. Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3001-3008Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Here we report the surprising observation that Arg-130 plays a major role in proton transfer to the 5′-leaving DNA strand.DISCUSSIONLys-167 and Arg-130 enhance the rate of transesterification by factors of ∼104 and ∼105, respectively. The substantial alleviation of the requirements for Lys-167 andArg-130 during scission of a 5′-bridging phosphorothiolate-modified substrate indicates that the process of general acid catalysis is more complex than was anticipated initially (14Krogh B.O. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 1035-1041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The present data suggest that Lys-167 and Arg-130 comprise a proton relay from the topoisomerase to the 5′-O of the leaving DNA strand. The order of the proton relay steps (e.g. Arg-130 → Lys-167 →5′-O versus Lys-167 → Arg-130 → 5′-O) cannot be surmised from the biochemical data alone. Moreover, none of the crystal structures of topoisomerase IB or tyrosine recombinases are directly illuminating on this issue. The structures provide snapshots of the protein-DNA interface before and after transesterification, but the atomic contacts during the chemical step, and especially in the transition state, are unclear and likely to differ from those seen in the pre- and postcleavage states. Some of the key side chains may interact only transiently with the scissile phosphate.In particular, it is evident that the β loop in which Lys-167 is situated displays considerable conformational flexibility in the various tyrosine recombinase and topoisomerase IB structures (see Ref.14Krogh B.O. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 1035-1041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar for discussion). We suggested a model whereby the β loop and Lys-167 initially lie outside the circumference of the DNA helix, and a conformational change upon cleavage site recognition triggers movement of the loop such that Lys-167 interacts transiently with the 5′-bridging oxygen in the transition state, donating its proton to form the 5′-OH of the leaving strand and subsequently reorienting its side chain to interact with the +1 base in the minor groove (14Krogh B.O. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 1035-1041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Recent structures of Flp recombinase and human topoisomerase IB are at least consistent with the idea that Lys is a direct proton donor to the leaving strand, insofar as (i) the Lys is located within hydrogen bonding distance (3.16 Å) of the 5′-OH of the cleaved strand in one of the protomer pairs of the Flp-DNA cocrystal and (ii) the Lys is located 4.0 Å from the 5′-O of the scissile phosphodiester in a new DNA cocrystal of human topoisomerase IB (9Chen Y. Narendra U. Iype L.E. Cox M.M. Rice P.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 885-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Redinbo M.R. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6832-6840Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Still we do not exclude the possibility that Arg-130 is the direct proton donor to the 5′-O leaving group; indeed an arginine is proposed to play such a role in the hydrolysis of phosphodiesters by staphylococcal nuclease (20Weber D.J. Gittis A.G. Mullen G.P. Abeygunawardana C. Lattman E.E. Mildvan A.S. Proteins. 1992; 13: 275-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the Flp-DNA cocrystal, the Lys is closer to the 5′-OH than is the Arg side chain, but the opposite situation holds for human topoisomerase IB where the Arg is within hydrogen binding distance (2.96 Å) of the 5′-O of the scissile phosphodiester (9Chen Y. Narendra U. Iype L.E. Cox M.M. Rice P.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 885-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Redinbo M.R. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6832-6840Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).Arg-130 is located between helices α2 and α3 of the catalytic domain; this segment is disordered in the crystal structure of free vaccinia topoisomerase and is sensitive to proteolysis in the free state in solution but resistant in the DNA-bound state (4Cheng C. Kussie P. Pavletich N. Shuman S. Cell. 1998; 92: 841-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 21Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11636-11645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, it is suggested that Arg-130 also undergoes a conformational change upon DNA binding that incorporates it into the active site. Although the Arg-130 equivalents are typically in contact with the scissile phosphate in the DNA cocrystal structures of topoisomerase IB or tyrosine recombinases, a recent structure of Cre recombinase bound to a Y-junction showed that the Arg-173 side chain (equivalent to vaccinia Arg-130) was rotated away from the scissile phosphate and that the β loop containing Lys-201 (equivalent of vaccinia Lys-167) was disordered, i.e. there was no visible electron density (22Woods K.C. Martin S.S. Chu V.C. Baldwin E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 49-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Taken together these observations suggest that the assembly of a catalytically competent active site in the DNA-bound topoisomerase IB and recombinase enzymes may involve conformational changes of both Arg-130 and Lys-167.There are several ways in which Arg-130 might assist proton donation by Lys-167: (i) Arg-130 could help lower the pK a of Lys-167 by contributing to a local positive electrostatic environment; (ii) Arg-130 could engage in a hydrogen bond to Lys-167; or (iii) Arg-130 could transfer a proton to Lys-167, conceivably coupled to its acquisition of a proton from an “upstream” component in a proton relay. The first model, based on purely electrostatic effects, does not account for the observed mutational and 5′-bridging phosphorothiolate effects on transesterification, insofar as the R130K substitution should have restored a positive electrostatic environment, yet the R130K mutant remains grossly defective in expulsion of the leaving DNA strand as gauged by the 2600-fold thiolate effect.We speculate that the Arg-130 side chain contacts both the scissile phosphate and Lys-167 in the transition state. The former interaction would help neutralize the developing negative charge on the proposed pentacoordinate phosphorane transition state, while the latter would donate either a hydrogen bond (proton sharing) or fully transfer a proton to Lys-167 as it gives up a proton to the 5′-O of the leaving strand. A model of proton relay from Arg-130 to Lys-167 can account for the 5′-bridging phosphorothiolate effects observed for the R130K and K167A mutants, and it raises the prospect that Arg-130 in turn accepts a proton from an upstream donor, which either directly or indirectly leads to abstraction of a proton from the active site tyrosine.An answer to the question of how the tyrosine is activated for nucleophilic attack on the scissile phosphodiester has been extremely elusive. A scheme has been proposed whereby a general base on the enzyme accepts a proton from the attacking tyrosine nucleophile during covalent adduct formation (23Stivers J.T. Shuman S. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15449-15458Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 24Christiansen K. Knudsen B.R. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11367-11373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, the available structures of type IB topoisomerases provide no clues to the identity of a putative general base, i.e. there is no “conventional” proton-accepting side chain (e.g. His, Asp, or Glu) in the immediate vicinity of the tyrosine nucleophile that can be shown by mutagenesis to be functionally relevant. Comprehensive alanine scanning of His, Asp, Glu, and Cys residues of vaccinia topoisomerase has failed to uncover any other than His-265 that contributes significantly to transesterification chemistry; moreover, it has been established by conservative mutagenesis that His-265 is not a general base catalyst (10Petersen B.Ø. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3891-3896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Alternatively it has been suggested based on the recent structural data for human topo IB that an ordered water molecule in the active site could act as a specific base to accept a proton from the Tyr O-4 atom (19Redinbo M.R. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6832-6840Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We speculate that Arg-130 might accept a proton from the active site tyrosine either directly or via an intervening water molecule as part of a wider proton relay network (conceivably Tyr-274 → Arg-130 → Lys-167→ 5′-O or Tyr-274 → water→ Arg-130 → Lys-167 → 5′-O) that links in a concerted fashion the deprotonation of the attacking Tyr nucleophile and the protonation of the 5′-O leaving group during the cleavage reaction. The religation reaction, entailing attack of the 5′-OH of the noncovalently held DNA strand on the covalent DNA-3′-phosphotyrosyl-enzyme intermediate, would presumably entail a reversal of the proposed proton relay whereby Lys-167 accepts a proton from the 5′-OH, transfers its to Arg-130, and then (directly or via water or some other intermediary) to the oxygen of the Tyr-274 leaving group. Type IB DNA topoisomerases relax DNA supercoils via a reaction pathway entailing noncovalent binding of the enzyme to duplex DNA, cleavage of one DNA strand with formation of a covalent DNA-(3′-phosphotyrosyl)-protein intermediate, strand passage, and strand religation (1Shuman S.

Tyrosine recombinases use a similar transesterification mechanism to form and resolve Holliday junctions. The catalytic domains of topo 1topotopoisomerase 1topotopoisomerase IB and tyrosine recombinases adopt a common fold composed of eight α helices and a three-stranded antiparallel β sheet (3Redinbo M.R.

The constituents of the active site occupy similar positions in the topo IB and recombinase tertiary structures. topoisomerase topoisomerase Four conserved amino acid side chains (e.g. Arg-130, Lys-167, Arg-223, and His-265 in the vaccinia topoisomerase) catalyze the attack of the active site tyrosine nucleophile (Tyr-274) on the scissile phosphodiester (10Petersen B.Ø.

Mutational, stereochemical, and structural data for vaccinia and nuclear topoisomerase IB and tyrosine recombinases suggest that the two arginines and the histidine contact the nonbridging oxygens of the scissile phosphodiester and that these interactions serve to stabilize a proposed pentacoordinate phosphorane transition state (3Redinbo M.R.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5561-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Recently we used 5′-bridging phosphorothiolate-modified DNAs to implicate Lys-167 of vaccinia topoisomerase as a general acid catalyst of the DNA cleavage reaction (14Krogh B.O. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 1035-1041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The hypothesis was that if the expulsion of the 5′-oxygen of the leaving DNA strand was indeed catalyzed by a general acid on the topoisomerase, then the requirement for the general acid ought to be alleviated by introducing a 5′-bridging phosphorothiolate at the scissile phosphodiester because the pK a of the DNA 5′-SH is ∼5 log units lower than that of the DNA 5′-OH. Accordingly the diagnostic feature of a topoisomerase mutant defective in general acid catalysis would be a significant increase in the cleavage rate on a 5′-S substrate compared with a 5′-O substrate. The “sulfur/oxygen ratio” ought not to increase for topoisomerase mutants that are impaired in other aspects of transesterification chemistry (e.g. transition state stabilization). Our findings were that that the 5′-S group restored activity to the catalytically defective K167A mutant, whereas there was no positive thiolate effect for mutants R223A and H265A (14Krogh B.O. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 1035-1041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Thus, we concluded that Lys-167 functions in proton transfer to the leaving strand. Lys-167 is located in a flexible interstrand hairpin loop of vaccinia topoisomerase and is conserved in all known type IB topoisomerases and tyrosine recombinases. Our earlier experiments did not address whether Arg-130 plays any role in leaving strand expulsion. Arg-130, which is invariant among type IB topoisomerases and tyrosine recombinases, enhances the transesterification rate of vaccinia topoisomerase by 5 orders of magnitude as gauged by the effect of the R130A mutation (10Petersen B.Ø. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3891-3896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Because a conservative R130K substitution had little restorative effect, it was surmised that multivalent contacts of the guanidinium nitrogens of Arg-130 with the scissile phosphodiester are essential for catalysis. The occurrence of either one or two hydrogen bonding contacts between this conserved arginine side chain and the DNA backbone in various crystal structures of topoisomerase IB and tyrosine recombinases (3Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 5Guo F. Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D.

Cell. 2000; 6: 885-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was broadly consonant with the mutational data for the vaccinia enzyme (11Wittschieben J. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3001-3008Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Here we report the surprising observation that Arg-130 plays a major role in proton transfer to the 5′-leaving DNA strand. DISCUSSIONLys-167 and Arg-130 enhance the rate of transesterification by factors of ∼104 and ∼105, respectively. The substantial alleviation of the requirements for Lys-167 andArg-130 during scission of a 5′-bridging phosphorothiolate-modified substrate indicates that the process of general acid catalysis is more complex than was anticipated initially (14Krogh B.O. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 1035-1041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The present data suggest that Lys-167 and Arg-130 comprise a proton relay from the topoisomerase to the 5′-O of the leaving DNA strand. The order of the proton relay steps (e.g. Arg-130 → Lys-167 →5′-O versus Lys-167 → Arg-130 → 5′-O) cannot be surmised from the biochemical data alone. Moreover, none of the crystal structures of topoisomerase IB or tyrosine recombinases are directly illuminating on this issue. The structures provide snapshots of the protein-DNA interface before and after transesterification, but the atomic contacts during the chemical step, and especially in the transition state, are unclear and likely to differ from those seen in the pre- and postcleavage states. Some of the key side chains may interact only transiently with the scissile phosphate.In particular, it is evident that the β loop in which Lys-167 is situated displays considerable conformational flexibility in the various tyrosine recombinase and topoisomerase IB structures (see Ref.14Krogh B.O. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 1035-1041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar for discussion). We suggested a model whereby the β loop and Lys-167 initially lie outside the circumference of the DNA helix, and a conformational change upon cleavage site recognition triggers movement of the loop such that Lys-167 interacts transiently with the 5′-bridging oxygen in the transition state, donating its proton to form the 5′-OH of the leaving strand and subsequently reorienting its side chain to interact with the +1 base in the minor groove (14Krogh B.O. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 1035-1041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Recent structures of Flp recombinase and human topoisomerase IB are at least consistent with the idea that Lys is a direct proton donor to the leaving strand, insofar as (i) the Lys is located within hydrogen bonding distance (3.16 Å) of the 5′-OH of the cleaved strand in one of the protomer pairs of the Flp-DNA cocrystal and (ii) the Lys is located 4.0 Å from the 5′-O of the scissile phosphodiester in a new DNA cocrystal of human topoisomerase IB (9Chen Y.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6832-6840Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Still we do not exclude the possibility that Arg-130 is the direct proton donor to the 5′-O leaving group; indeed an arginine is proposed to play such a role in the hydrolysis of phosphodiesters by staphylococcal nuclease (20Weber D.J.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6832-6840Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).Arg-130 is located between helices α2 and α3 of the catalytic domain; this segment is disordered in the crystal structure of free vaccinia topoisomerase and is sensitive to proteolysis in the free state in solution but resistant in the DNA-bound state (4Cheng C. Kussie P. Pavletich N. Shuman S. Cell. 1998; 92: 841-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 21Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11636-11645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, it is suggested that Arg-130 also undergoes a conformational change upon DNA binding that incorporates it into the active site. Although the Arg-130 equivalents are typically in contact with the scissile phosphate in the DNA cocrystal structures of topoisomerase IB or tyrosine recombinases, a recent structure of Cre recombinase bound to a Y-junction showed that the Arg-173 side chain (equivalent to vaccinia Arg-130) was rotated away from the scissile phosphate and that the β loop containing Lys-201 (equivalent of vaccinia Lys-167) was disordered, i.e. there was no visible electron density (22Woods K.C. Martin S.S. Chu V.C. Baldwin E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 49-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Taken together these observations suggest that the assembly of a catalytically competent active site in the DNA-bound topoisomerase IB and recombinase enzymes may involve conformational changes of both Arg-130 and Lys-167.There are several ways in which Arg-130 might assist proton donation by Lys-167: (i) Arg-130 could help lower the pK a of Lys-167 by contributing to a local positive electrostatic environment; (ii) Arg-130 could engage in a hydrogen bond to Lys-167; or (iii) Arg-130 could transfer a proton to Lys-167, conceivably coupled to its acquisition of a proton from an “upstream” component in a proton relay. The first model, based on purely electrostatic effects, does not account for the observed mutational and 5′-bridging phosphorothiolate effects on transesterification, insofar as the R130K substitution should have restored a positive electrostatic environment, yet the R130K mutant remains grossly defective in expulsion of the leaving DNA strand as gauged by the 2600-fold thiolate effect.We speculate that the Arg-130 side chain contacts both the scissile phosphate and Lys-167 in the transition state. The former interaction would help neutralize the developing negative charge on the proposed pentacoordinate phosphorane transition state, while the latter would donate either a hydrogen bond (proton sharing) or fully transfer a proton to Lys-167 as it gives up a proton to the 5′-O of the leaving strand. A model of proton relay from Arg-130 to Lys-167 can account for the 5′-bridging phosphorothiolate effects observed for the R130K and K167A mutants, and it raises the prospect that Arg-130 in turn accepts a proton from an upstream donor, which either directly or indirectly leads to abstraction of a proton from the active site tyrosine.An answer to the question of how the tyrosine is activated for nucleophilic attack on the scissile phosphodiester has been extremely elusive. A scheme has been proposed whereby a general base on the enzyme accepts a proton from the attacking tyrosine nucleophile during covalent adduct formation (23Stivers J.T. Shuman S. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15449-15458Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 24Christiansen K. Knudsen B.R. Westergaard O. J. Biol.

Comprehensive alanine scanning of His, Asp, Glu, and Cys residues of vaccinia topoisomerase has failed to uncover any other than His-265 that contributes significantly to transesterification chemistry; moreover, it has been established by conservative mutagenesis that His-265 is not a general base catalyst (10Petersen B.Ø. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3891-3896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Alternatively it has been suggested based on the recent structural data for human topo IB that an ordered water molecule in the active site could act as a specific base to accept a proton from the Tyr O-4 atom (19Redinbo M.R. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6832-6840Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We speculate that Arg-130 might accept a proton from the active site tyrosine either directly or via an intervening water molecule as part of a wider proton relay network (conceivably Tyr-274 → Arg-130 → Lys-167→ 5′-O or Tyr-274 → water→ Arg-130 → Lys-167 → 5′-O) that links in a concerted fashion the deprotonation of the attacking Tyr nucleophile and the protonation of the 5′-O leaving group during the cleavage reaction. The religation reaction, entailing attack of the 5′-OH of the noncovalently held DNA strand on the covalent DNA-3′-phosphotyrosyl-enzyme intermediate, would presumably entail a reversal of the proposed proton relay whereby Lys-167 accepts a proton from the 5′-OH, transfers its to Arg-130, and then (directly or via water or some other intermediary) to the oxygen of the Tyr-274 leaving group. Lys-167 and Arg-130 enhance the rate of transesterification by factors of ∼104 and ∼105, respectively.

Narendra U. Iype L.E. Cox M.M. Rice P.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 885-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Redinbo M.R. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6832-6840Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Arg-130 is located between helices α2 and α3 of the catalytic domain; this segment is disordered in the crystal structure of free vaccinia topoisomerase and is sensitive to proteolysis in the free state in solution but resistant in the DNA-bound state (4Cheng C. Kussie P. Pavletich N. Shuman S. Cell. 1998; 92: 841-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 21Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11636-11645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, it is suggested that Arg-130 also undergoes a conformational change upon DNA binding that incorporates it into the active site. Although the Arg-130 equivalents are typically in contact with the scissile phosphate in the DNA cocrystal structures of topoisomerase IB or tyrosine recombinases, a recent structure of Cre recombinase bound to a Y-junction showed that the Arg-173 side chain (equivalent to vaccinia Arg-130) was rotated away from the scissile phosphate and that the β loop containing Lys-201 (equivalent of vaccinia Lys-167) was disordered, i.e. there was no visible electron density (22Woods K.C. Martin S.S. Chu V.C. Baldwin E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 49-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Taken together these observations suggest that the assembly of a catalytically competent active site in the DNA-bound topoisomerase IB and recombinase enzymes may involve conformational changes of both Arg-130 and Lys-167. There are several ways in which Arg-130 might assist proton donation by Lys-167: (i) Arg-130 could help lower the pK a of Lys-167 by contributing to a local positive electrostatic environment; (ii) Arg-130 could engage in a hydrogen bond to Lys-167; or (iii) Arg-130 could transfer a proton to Lys-167, conceivably coupled to its acquisition of a proton from an “upstream” component in a proton relay. The first model, based on purely electrostatic effects, does not account for the observed mutational and 5′-bridging phosphorothiolate effects on transesterification, insofar as the R130K substitution should have restored a positive electrostatic environment, yet the R130K mutant remains grossly defective in expulsion of the leaving DNA strand as gauged by the 2600-fold thiolate effect. We speculate that the Arg-130 side chain contacts both the scissile phosphate and Lys-167 in the transition state. The former interaction would help neutralize the developing negative charge on the proposed pentacoordinate phosphorane transition state, while the latter would donate either a hydrogen bond (proton sharing) or fully transfer a proton to Lys-167 as it gives up a proton to the 5′-O of the leaving strand. A model of proton relay from Arg-130 to Lys-167 can account for the 5′-bridging phosphorothiolate effects observed for the R130K and K167A mutants, and it raises the prospect that Arg-130 in turn accepts a proton from an upstream donor, which either directly or indirectly leads to abstraction of a proton from the active site tyrosine. An answer to the question of how the tyrosine is activated for nucleophilic attack on the scissile phosphodiester has been extremely elusive. A scheme has been proposed whereby a general base on the enzyme accepts a proton from the attacking tyrosine nucleophile during covalent adduct formation (23Stivers J.T. Shuman S. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15449-15458Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 24Christiansen K. Knudsen B.R. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11367-11373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, the available structures of type IB topoisomerases provide no clues to the identity of a putative general base, i.e. there is no “conventional” proton-accepting side chain (e.g. His, Asp, or Glu) in the immediate vicinity of the tyrosine nucleophile that can be shown by mutagenesis to be functionally relevant. Comprehensive alanine scanning of His, Asp, Glu, and Cys residues of vaccinia topoisomerase has failed to uncover any other than His-265 that contributes significantly to transesterification chemistry; moreover, it has been established by conservative mutagenesis that His-265 is not a general base catalyst (10Petersen B.Ø. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3891-3896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Alternatively it has been suggested based on the recent structural data for human topo IB that an ordered water molecule in the active site could act as a specific base to accept a proton from the Tyr O-4 atom (19Redinbo M.R. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6832-6840Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We speculate that Arg-130 might accept a proton from the active site tyrosine either directly or via an intervening water molecule as part of a wider proton relay network (conceivably Tyr-274 → Arg-130 → Lys-167→ 5′-O or Tyr-274 → water→ Arg-130 → Lys-167 → 5′-O) that links in a concerted fashion the deprotonation of the attacking Tyr nucleophile and the protonation of the 5′-O leaving group during the cleavage reaction. The religation reaction, entailing attack of the 5′-OH of the noncovalently held DNA strand on the covalent DNA-3′-phosphotyrosyl-enzyme intermediate, would presumably entail a reversal of the proposed proton relay whereby Lys-167 accepts a proton from the 5′-OH, transfers its to Arg-130, and then (directly or via water or some other intermediary) to the oxygen of the Tyr-274 leaving group."

A role for Rac3 in integrin-mediated adhesion and spreading has not been defined. We here report that CIB, a protein that binds to the αIIbβ3 fibrinogen receptor, interacts exclusively with activated (V12) Rac3 but not Rac1 or Rac2. Binding of V12Rac3 to CIB was mediated by the C-terminal end of Rac3 and by Rac3 membrane localization. Adhesion of cells on fibrinogen was accompanied by a specific increase in the levels of Rac3 but not Rac1 or Rac2 in the Triton-insoluble fraction of the cell. Also, CIB co-localized with active Rac3 to the periphery of cells adhering to fibrinogen. Expression of V12Rac3 and CIB stimulated αIIbβ3-mediated adhesion and spreading on fibrinogen. Moreover, adhesion through αIIbβ3 caused a marked increase in the levels of endogenous GTP-bound Rac3 but not Rac1.

D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2097) Google Scholar, 2Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar). Spreading and adhesion are mediated by the integrin class of transmembrane receptors. The affinity of integrins for ligands can be regulated intracellularly by agonists through so-called inside-out signaling. Ligand-bound integrins transmit signals to the cell interior, resulting in post-receptor occupancy events, including actin cytoskeletal rearrangement, leading to the spreading of cells (3Shattil S.J. Kashiwagi H. Pampori N. Blood. 1998; 91: 2645-2657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Integrin-mediated adhesion and spreading have been linked to the activity of Rac1. Experiments in T-cells demonstrated that V12Rac1 is not involved in the first steps leading to activation of the integrin receptor but, rather, that it plays a role in these post-receptor occupancy events (4D'Souza-Schorey C. Boetiner B. Van Aelst L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3936-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Within minutes of integrin engagement on normal human natural killer cells, the level of endogenous active GTP-bound Rac1 is increased (5Mainiero F. Soriani A. Strippoli R. Jacobelli J. Gismondi A. Piccoli M. Frati L. Santoni A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 7-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Adhesion of NIH3T3 cells to fibronectin also caused a transient increase in the levels of activated Rac (6del Pozo M.A. Price L.S. Alderson N.B. Ren X.-D. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 2000; 9: 2008-2014Crossref Scopus (405) Google Scholar). The introduction of constitutively active V12Rac1, which is locked in its GTP-bound state, into cultured cells results in a dramatic spreading of these cells, accompanied by actin cytoskeletal rearrangements, which are integrin-dependent (2Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar, 7Clark E.A. King W.G. Brugge J.S. Symons M. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 573-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 8Price L.S. Leng J. Schwartz M.A. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Moreover, integrin engagement leads to downstream activation of previously identified Rac effectors (8Price L.S. Leng J. Schwartz M.A. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). In combination, these data demonstrate that the cytoskeletal rearrangements associated with integrin activation are linked to Rac1, but the exact mechanism by which this takes place is not clear. There are only three human Racs, which together are responsible for mediating the large variety of downstream cellular effects associated with activated Racs. They share between 89 and 93% identity in their amino acid sequence (9Haataja L. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20384-20388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Because the sequence of their so-called effector loop, the region to which most Rac effectors bind, is virtually identical, it is unclear how specificity is generated. Indeed, no proteins binding to the Rac effector loop have been reported that interact with only one single Rac family member. The only region that differs substantially among Rac1, 2, and 3 is their C-terminal end (9Haataja L. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20384-20388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), which also contains subcellular localization determinants. We reasoned, therefore, that this region is most likely to specify differential functions between the three Rac isoforms. In an attempt to isolate proteins interacting only with Rac3, we used the isolated C-terminal 48 amino acid residues of Rac3 to screen a yeast two-hybrid cDNA library. Here we report that the calcium- and integrin-binding protein CIB1binds exclusively to Rac3 and that these proteins stimulate adhesion and spreading of cells in an αIIbβ3integrin-dependent manner. This is the only protein identified to date that interacts exclusively with a single Rac isoform and links Rac3 with adhesion and spreading of cells through the fibrinogen receptor. The C-terminal fragments of RAC3 and RAC1 encoding amino acids 145–192 were subcloned into the yeast bait vector pAS2-1 (Fig. 1 A, CLONTECH). pAS2-1/V12S189Rac3 was used to isolate and subclone the C-terminal fragment containing the S189 mutation (10Haataja L. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 1: 665-670PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, that plasmid was used to generate GST-V12S189Rac3 in pLEF. The plasmids pAS2-1/S189Rac3, pLEF/GST-wtRac3, and pLEF/GST-V12Rac3 have been described previously (10Haataja L. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 1: 665-670PubMed Google Scholar). pcDNA3.1/ Xpress-N17Rac3 was generated by PCR mutagenesis using RAC3 cDNA as a template (9Haataja L. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20384-20388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). To express GST-V12Rac1 and GST-V12Rac2 in mammalian cells, a G12V mutation was generated by PCR mutagenesis usingRAC1 and RAC2 cDNAs as templates (9Haataja L. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20384-20388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Mutations were verified by sequencing. Candidate positive cDNAs from the yeast two-hybrid screen were subcloned into pSG5 (Stratagene) as described previously (10Haataja L. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 1: 665-670PubMed Google Scholar). Our 0.9-kb cDNA clone 107-14 encodes full-length CIB, including a 191-amino acid coding region, a short 5′-noncoding sequence, and a 300-bp 3′-untranslated region. pSG5/HA-CIB expresses a 26-kDa protein; the HA tag is located at the N terminus of the protein. V12Rac3 and CIB were also subcloned into pcDNA3.1 to include an N-terminal Xpress tag (Invitrogen). One EF-hand motif was deleted by digestion of CIB with NgoAIV and removal of sequences 3′ to this site. This CIB protein, CIB del EF, included an N-terminal Xpress tag and amino acid residues 1–129. We also constructed CIB-Myc (amino acids 1–191), which contained a C-terminal Myc epitope, in pcDNA3.1. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain YRG-2 (Stratagene) was co-transformed with pAS2-1/C-terminal Rac3 and the Matchmaker human placenta cDNA library (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In total, 7 × 105 primary transformants were selected for growth on yeast dropout medium lacking histidine, leucine, and tryptophan, and surviving His+ colonies were screened for expression of β-galactosidase. Forty-three primary positives were retransformed into the yeast reporter host strain Y190 (CLONTECH) as described previously (10Haataja L. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 1: 665-670PubMed Google Scholar) and were tested for interaction with the nonspecific test bait lamin. COS-1 and CHO-K1 cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. All tissue culture reagents were from Invitrogen, and all reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with 10 μg of pSG5/HA-CIB and 10 μg of pLEF/GST-V12Rac3, pLEF/GST-wtRac3, or an empty pLEF-vector (GST) by using DEAE-dextran. CHO-K1 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies). The amount of pcDNA3.1/Xpress-CIB was always 3.5 μg, and the amount of pLEF/GST-V12Rac3, pLEF/GST-V12S189Rac3, pLEF/GST-V12Rac1, or pLEF/GST-V12Rac2 was always 0.5 μg to compensate for differences in expression levels of these constructs. Transfected cells were lysed in Triton-lysis buffer (25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, and 1 mmNa3VO4), and cleared lysates (0.3 mg) were incubated with glutathione-agarose beads in pull-down buffer (4D'Souza-Schorey C. Boetiner B. Van Aelst L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3936-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) as described previously (10Haataja L. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 1: 665-670PubMed Google Scholar). GST-containing proteins were bound to glutathione-agarose, and the presence of interacting HA or Xpress-tagged proteins and GST fusion proteins were assayed using anti-Xpress (Invitrogen), anti-HA (USC core facility), and anti-GST (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) antibodies. CHO-K1 cells were co-transfected with pSG5/HA-CIB plus pcDNA3.1 vector, pcDNA3.1/Xpress-wtRac3, or pcDNA3.1/Xpress-V12Rac3. Forty-two hours after transfection, cells were lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Cell lysates were incubated with GST-PAK-PBD essentially as described by Benard et al. (11Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Affinity-precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The membranes were incubated with anti-Xpress antibodies, and immunocomplexes were detected by ECL (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Using this method, we could show a minimum of 4-fold increase of GTP-Rac1 in COS-1 cells transfected with a Dbl expression vector (a known guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac)versus a vector control (data not shown). A5 CHO cells expressing αIIbβ3 integrin were a gift from Dr. M. Ginsberg (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) (12O'Toole T.E. Mandelman D. Forsyth J. Shattil S. Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. Science. 1991; 254: 845-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The cells were serum-starved in DMEM/0.1% fetal calf serum for 24 h, then trypsinized and kept in suspension in DMEM/0.1% fetal calf serum for an additional 18 h. Cells were washed with DMEM/0.5% BSA and kept in suspension in DMEM/0.5% BSA for 3 h. An aliquot was maintained in suspension, whereas another was plated on a Petri dish coated with 20 μg/ml fibrinogen (Enzyme Research Laboratories) for 10 min. Cells were lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation buffer, and Rac activity assays were performed as described above. Filters were first probed with Rac3 antibodies (9Haataja L. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20384-20388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) then stripped with a Re-blot kit (Chemicon) and reprobed with anti-Rac1 (Transduction Laboratories) antibodies. The GTP-Rac pull-down results were analyzed using the Un-Scan-It program (Silk Scientific). A5 CHO cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1/Xpress-CIB alone or with pLEF/GST-V12Rac3, pLEF/GST-V12Rac1, or pLEF/GST-V12Rac2. A5 CHO cells were also transfected with pLEF/GST-V12Rac3 alone. CHO-K1 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1/Xpress-CIB plus pLEF/GST-V12Rac3 or pLEF/GST using LipofectAMINE. Transfected cells were serum-starved in DMEM/0.1% fetal calf serum for 24 h before an assay. Cells were washed twice with PBS and trypsinized. Soybean trypsin inhibitor was added, and cells were washed twice with DMEM/0.5% BSA and kept in suspension for 1 h. Cells were plated on Petri dishes coated with 20 μg/ml fibrinogen (A5 CHO) or with 10 μg/ml fibronectin (CHO-K1) or kept in suspension at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed in Triton-lysis buffer. An aliquot of the lysate was solubilized in 2× Laemmli sample buffer (total lysate) and boiled. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 19,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant (Triton-soluble fraction) was removed, and the pellet was washed once with Triton-lysis buffer and finally solubilized in 2× Laemmli sample buffer (Triton-insoluble fraction). An equal amount of protein (10 μg) was loaded in each lane. Proteins were assayed using anti-Rac3, anti-Xpress, or anti-GST antibodies. Transfected and serum-starved A5 CHO cells were plated on fibrinogen-coated Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nunc) for 15 or 30 min at 37 °C. Nonadherent cells were washed away, and adherent cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and blocked in PBS plus 3% normal goat serum (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 30 min. Cells were incubated for 1 h with primary antibodies, including polyclonal anti-HA (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, 1:400), polyclonal anti-GST (1:50), monoclonal anti-Xpress (1:400), or monoclonal anti-Myc (USC Core Facility, 1:200) antibodies, followed by incubation for 30 min with fluorescein isothiocyanate (1:50)- and TRITC (1:100)-conjugated secondary antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Actin filaments were stained with TRITC-phalloidin (Sigma, 1:1000). Slides were then washed and incubated for 6 min with 300 nm 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenyl-indole (Molecular Probes). Slides were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories), and cells were analyzed with a Zeiss LSM 510 or a Leica TCS SP confocal microscope. Cell area comparisons from transfected cells were performed on images captured using a 40x/1.25 numerical aperture objective lens on a Leica TCS SP confocal microscope with 488- and 568-nm excitation and fluorescein isothiocyanate and TRITC emission spectral windows, then measured with MetaMorph software. The areas of 50 cells were counted. Differences of mean area were analyzed by a one-tailedt test with unequal variances. Probabilities (pvalues) were also calculated for the t test values. Ninety-six-well, flat-bottomed plates (Dynatech) were coated with 20 μg/ml fibrinogen. A5 CHO cells were transfected and serum-starved for 24 h. Detached cells were kept in suspension (2 × 105/ml) in Tyrode's modified buffer (Tyrode's salt solution, Sigma, supplemented with 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 1% BSA) at 37 °C for 30 min and plated (100 μl/well). After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, non-adherent cells were washed off and quantitation of adherent cells was performed using a colorimetric detection method. For each sample, eight wells were quantitated. Adherent cells were incubated with 0.25 mg/ml 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide in DMEM/0.1% BSA. After 2 h at 37 °C, medium was replaced with Me2SO. The plates were read at 550–650 nm in a Thermomax microplate reader (Molecular Devices), and the results were statistically analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. In different experiments, the degree of stimulation of adhesion was strongly correlated with the expression level of transfected CIB (results not shown), and, although CIB levels varied between different experiments, we were unable to overexpress it to a similar degree as Rac3 upon serum starvation of cells. We screened a human placental cDNA library with C-terminal residues 145–192 of Rac3 as bait (C-term. Rac3, Fig.1 A) and isolated one clone, 107-14, independently six times. In a separate yeast two-hybrid screen using V12S189Rac3 as bait, we identified several other positives, including a CRIB domain-containing target as well as a protein with a serine/threonine kinase homology domain (10Haataja L. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 1: 665-670PubMed Google Scholar). 2L. Haataja, V. Kaartinen, J. Groffen, and N. Heisterkamp, unpublished. The strength of interaction of clone 107-14 with C-term. Rac3 was comparable to that of the serine/threonine kinase homolog with V12S189Rac3 in yeast but was about 3-fold lower than that of V12S189Rac3 with the CRIB domain protein. Data base searches with the nucleotide sequence of clone 107-14 revealed that it encoded full-length CIB, a previously identified calcineurin-homologous protein that was shown to bind to the αIIb integrin, to Presenilin-2, and to the polo-like kinases Fnk and Snk (13Naik U.P.

To date, no other studies have identified CIB as an Rac-interacting protein. In eukaryotic cells, Rac GTPases are post-translationally modified by attachment of a 20-carbon geranylgeranyl moiety to the C-terminal cysteine residue (Cys-189), removal of the three most C-terminal amino acid residues, and methylation of the lipid-modified cysteine (20Casey P.J. Science. 1995; 268: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). These modifications provide a membrane-targeting signal to eukaryotic Rac. Targeting of Rac to membranes is undesirable in a yeast two-hybrid screen, because interactions in that system must be scored in the nucleus. To prevent this from happening, other yeast two-hybrid screens have been done using constitutively active Rac with a C189S mutation to prevent such membrane targeting (21Aspenström P. Olson M.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 228-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We tested whether in yeast CIB would bind to full-length Rac3, including the V12 and S189 mutations, but we could detect no interaction between these proteins (Fig. 1 B). Also, full-length wild type Rac3 with the Ser-189 mutation did not bind CIB. To test whether the Cys-189 residue of Rac3 is critical for the interaction of CIB with Rac3, we introduced the C189S mutation into the C-terminal Rac3 fragment. However, this C-terminal Rac3 fragment interacted with CIB with a strength comparable to that of the original bait lacking this mutation (Fig. 1 B). Surprisingly, CIB did not interact with the C-terminal end (residues 145–192) of the closely related Rac1 protein (Fig. 1 B). Thus, in the yeast two-hybrid system, CIB binds only to the C-terminal sequence of Rac3. In the yeast two-hybrid system, proteins are forced into a common subcellular compartment, the nucleus. To investigate whether the interaction of CIB with the isolated C terminus of Rac3 reflected an authentic interaction of the entire protein in mammalian cells, we co-transfected HA-tagged CIB plus full-length GST-tagged Rac3 (with and without the activating V12 mutation) or GST control into COS-1 cells. The expression levels of HA-CIB and GST fusion proteins were comparable in each transfectant (Fig. 2 A,Lysate). GST-containing proteins were then bound to glutathione-agarose, and the presence of co-precipitating HA-CIB was examined. As shown in Fig. 2 A (GST-pulldown), HA-CIB formed a detectable complex with V12Rac3, with around 0.3% of the Triton-soluble CIB binding to V12Rac3 (Fig. 2, A andB). There was no binding to GST alone. CIB failed to bind to the Rac1 C terminus in yeast. Therefore we co-transfected CIB with the V12 mutants of Rac1, Rac2, and Rac3 into CHO-K1 cells and compared the binding of CIB to these closely related small GTPases. As shown in Fig. 2 B (Lysate), all three GST-tagged small GTPases and Xpress-tagged CIB were clearly expressed in these cells. However, remarkably, CIB was only able to complex with full-length V12Rac3, and failed to detectably bind to full-length V12Rac1 or V12Rac2 (Fig. 2 B, GST-pull-down). As discussed above, in small GTPases such as Rac, the prenylation of the carboxyl-proximal cysteine residue (Cys-189) is a major determinant for membrane association (22Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1761) Google Scholar), and prenylation can be blocked by the C189S mutation. Because Cys-189 does not appear to be essential for the binding of Rac3 to CIB but will prevent its association with membranes, we tested the binding of CIB to V12S189Rac3 in eukaryotic cells. CHO-K1 cells were co-transfected with Xpress-tagged CIB plus GST-tagged V12Rac3 or V12S189Rac3. Xpress-tagged CIB protein bound to GST-Rac3 was analyzed using anti-Xpress antibodies. The constructs were efficiently expressed (Fig. 2 C, Lysate). As shown in Fig.2 C (GST-pulldown), in comparison with V12Rac3, there was significantly less CIB complexed with the V12S189Rac3 mutant. These experiments indicate that membrane localization of Rac3 is important for the efficient interaction between CIB and Rac3. We considered the possibility that CIB is involved in the activation of Rac3. As shown in Fig. 2 A (GST-pulldown), there as a detectable interaction of wild type Rac3 with CIB, although the level of detected complex formation was much lower than that with constitutively active GTP-bound Rac3. Wild type Rac is mainly in the GDP-bound form. To examine if CIB is involved in the activation of Rac3, cells were transfected with CIB and wtRac3, and affinity precipitation with GST-PAK-PBD was performed as described (11Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar), followed by immunoblotting with anti-Xpress antibodies. The expression level of HA-CIB was equal in each lane (Fig. 2 D,Lysate). As controls, we transfected cells with CIB plus empty vector or plus V12Rac3. As shown in Fig. 2 D, although GTP-bound V12Rac3 was clearly detectable using this method, there was no evidence that any of the wtRac3 was in the GTP-bound state in the presence of CIB. These data show that CIB and Rac3 specifically interact in mammalian cells but that this does not result in the activation of Rac3. Both CIB and Rac3 are ubiquitously expressed. Although the normal cellular functions of Rac3 have not yet been defined, Rac1 was shown to be involved in integrin-mediated adhesion and spreading. CIB was originally identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen as a protein binding specifically to the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the αIIb integrin. Therefore, we examined a possible role for Rac3 in αIIbβ3 integrin-mediated spreading and adhesion. The function and downstream signaling of the αIIbβ3 integrin have been extensively investigated in the A5 CHO model system, in which αIIbβ3 is stably expressed. These cells can adhere to fibrinogen because of the presence of the αIIbβ3 integrin, which is lacking in the parental cell line; parental CHO-K1 cells are unable to adhere to fibrinogen-coated supports (12O'Toole T.E. Mandelman D. Forsyth J. Shattil S. Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. Science. 1991; 254: 845-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Engagement of the αIIbβ3 integrin leads to association of specific proteins involved in signaling through this integrin with the cytoskeleton, where they are recovered in the Triton-insoluble fraction of the cell (23Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). To investigate whether CIB and V12Rac3 become incorporated into the Triton-insoluble fraction during fibrinogen-mediated adhesion, A5 CHO cells were transiently co-transfected with Xpress-CIB plus GST-V12Rac3. Cells were either allowed to adhere on fibrinogen or kept in suspension. The total amount of Rac3 or CIB was not different between adherent and non-adherent cells (Fig. 3 A, lanes T). In suspended cells, a relatively low level of CIB was associated with the Triton-insoluble cytoskeletal fraction (Fig.3 A, right panel, lane IS). When cells were plated on fibrinogen, a 2- to 3-fold increase of CIB as well as V12Rac3 protein levels was detected in this fraction (Fig.3 A, left panel, lanes IS), indicating that both V12Rac3 and CIB become associated with the cytoskeleton upon αIIbβ3 integrin-mediated adhesion. To compare the localization of CIB in the absence and in the presence of Rac3, we transfected A5 CHO cells with CIB or with CIB plus GST-tagged V12Rac3. Cells were adhered on fibrinogen for 30 min, and Triton-soluble and Triton-insoluble fractions were prepared. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the amount of CIB in the Triton-insoluble fraction was increased in the presence of V12Rac3 (compare lanes IS), whereas the level of association with the V12Rac3 in Triton-insoluble fraction, which was already high, did not clearly change in the presence of CIB (Fig. 3 C). To be able to compare the localization of Rac3 with that of Rac2 and Rac1, we co-transfected Xpress-CIB with V12Rac 1, 2, or 3, which were all GST-tagged, and repeated the experiment. GST was recovered only in the soluble fraction, indicating that there is no significant contamination of the insoluble fraction with soluble proteins. V12Rac3 levels increased in the insoluble fraction when the A5 CHO cells were allowed to adhere on fibrinogen, in concordance with the previous experiment (Fig. 3 D). V12Rac1 and V12Rac2 clearly behaved differently: Their levels did not increase in the insoluble fraction of the fibrinogen-adherent cells (Fig. 3 D). In addition, the overall amount of V12Rac2 associated with the insoluble fraction was less than that of V12Rac1 or V12Rac3 and is concordant with the difference in subcellular locations found for Rac1 and Rac2 in living cells (24Michaelson D. Silletti J. Murphy G. D'Eustachio P. Rush M. Philips M.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Previous studies in other cell types have shown that constitutively active Rac1 promotes integrin-mediated spreading of cells (2Hall A.

A5 CHO cells co-transfected with EGFP plasmid plus CIB or EGFP alone were allowed to adhere to fibrinogen for 15 and 30 min. Cells were subsequently stained with TRITC-phalloidin to visualize the actin cytoskeleton and analyzed using confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig.4 A, at 15 min, EGFP-alone-transfected cells were rounded, with a prominent actin ring, whereas the"

The activation/deactivation cycle of heterotrimeric G-proteins, key players in cell signaling events, involves guanine nucleotide exchange, GTP hydrolysis, and a number of dynamic, conformationally sensitive protein interactions. In addition to the extensively studied activation of G-proteins by the superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors, the G-protein activation/deactivation cycle is regulated by nonreceptor proteins that influence subunit interactions, GTPase activity, and guanine nucleotide binding properties of Gα.

The GPR motif is evolutionarily conserved within individual orthologs and among proteins with apparently diverse functions (see S.M.A.R.T. data base at dylan.embl-heidelberg.de/). Four spatially conserved GPR motifs are found in AGS3 (3Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C. Bernard M. Chung P. Hazard III, S. Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol.

The interaction of the PINS protein GPR domains with Gα is involved in the function of PINS in cell polarity and asymmetric cell division (17Schaefer M. Petronczki M. Dorner D. Forte M. Knoblich J.A.

M., and Kalivas, P. (2001) Annual Meeting of the Society of Neuroscience, November 11–15, San Diego, CA, Abstract Program 977.6Google Scholar). Single GPR motifs are found in Rap1GAP, Pcp2, RGS12, and RGS14, which are all implicated as G-protein regulators. Protein interaction studies and/or functional screens in yeast indicate that the AGS3 GPR motif interacts with Gαi1–3, but not Gαs, Gαq, Gαz, Gα12, or Gα16 (3Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C.

Specific GPR motifs are capable of interacting with Gαo, albeit with apparently lower affinity than observed for Gαi (10Natochin M. Gasimov K.G. Artemyev N.O. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5322-5328Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Rap1GAP was actually isolated in yeast two-hybrid screens using Gαo (18Jordan J.D. Carey K.D. Stork P.J.S. Iyengar R. J.

Thus the GPR motif appears to serve as a discrete motif to anchor a variety of proteins that influence the guanine nucleotide binding/hydrolysis properties of G-proteins. The existence of such a fairly discrete and highly conserved binding motif that inhibits GDP dissociation is of particular interest. As a first step toward developing a small organic molecule that would mimic the action of a GPR peptide, we defined the key structural features of the GPR motif required for biological activity. These data provide a platform for the development of novel, G-protein-selective therapeutics that target this critically important signaling protein within the cell. Such agents might inhibit Gα-mediated signaling by G-protein-coupled receptors, selectively activate Gβγ-sensitive effectors, and/or disrupt specific regulatory input to G-proteins mediated by GPR-containing proteins. Peptides were synthesized and purified by Bio-Synthesis, Inc. (Lewisville, TX) and peptide identity verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry.

The GPR domain of AGS3 (463P–S650) was generated as a gutathioneS-transferase fusion protein in pGEX4T1. GST-AGS3 was expressed in and purified from BL21 bacteria using glutathione-Sepharose 4B. Gαi1 and Gαo were purified in the GDP bound state from Sf9 insect cells infected with recombinant virus as described previously (21Clawges H.M. Depree K.M. Parker E.M. Graber S.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12930-12938Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Concentration response curves with GPR peptides were analyzed by PRISM (Graphpad Software, Inc, San Diego, CA) to calculate IC50 values. Stabilization of the GDP-bound conformation of Gαiby a 28-amino acid peptide encompassing the GPR motif presents an unexpected aspect of regulation within the G-protein activation/deactivation cycle. This activity of the peptide essentially prevents nucleotide exchange on Gα and binding of GTP to G-protein. The GPR-GαiGDP complex is quite stable and is observed in the absence and presence of added magnesium, which is generally required for high affinity binding of GTPγS (Fig.1). As part of a broad approach to define the structural properties of this regulation and develop a small molecule ligand that would target this novel regulatory site on Gα subunits, we defined the core GPR motif and the key amino acid residues within this core motif. A panel of peptides derived from the GPR motif were characterized in GTPγS binding assays and protein interaction assays using purified mammalian G-protein α subunits. Several conserved features constitute the GPR motif. The invariant Q15 essentially divides the peptide into two general regions of conserved residues (Fig.2 A). Both helical wheel and hydrophobic moment analysis indicate that the area upstream of Q15 likely exists as an alpha helix. We first asked if either of the two general regions of conserved residues (i.e. upstream and downstream of Q15) were active by themselves. Neither GPR1–15 nor GPR15–28 inhibited GTPγS binding to Gαi. The region upstream of Q15 is distinguished by the negatively charged 4EED6followed by two hydrophobic sectors (7FF8,10LL11) (Fig. 2). The region downstream of the Q15 peptide is characterized by the conserved sequence18RMDDQR23. Deletion of the first eight residues at the amino terminus, which removed7FF8 or mutation of R23 to phenylalanine (3Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C. Bernard M. Chung P. Hazard III, S. Duzic E.

The 20DDQR23 sequence is one of the most highly conserved regions of the peptide among different species and proteins. To test the importance of the spatial relationship between this region and the remainder of the conserved residues found elsewhere in the peptide, we inserted two and four alanines just upstream of the 20DDQR23 region. Insertion of the alanines completely abolished bioactivity in GTPγS binding assays (Fig. 2 A). Thus, these data indicated that there is a core GPR motif (residues 7–23) in which a defined spatial relationship among the conserved residues is required for bioactivity. We then addressed the relative importance of conserved amino acids within the core GPR motif by alanine substitutions and subsequent peptide evaluation in GTPγS binding assays (Fig. 2 B). Peptides with alanine substitutions at 7FF8,10LL11, and Q22 were inactive and thus identify the key residues of the peptide. Both7FF8 and 10LL11 likely constitute the core of the predicted alpha helix in this region, indicating the importance of this structural feature for bioactivity (Fig. 1). The importance of this region is further emphasized by loss of biological activity observed with an F8R mutation in the context of a GST-AGS3 fusion protein (3Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C.

The IC50values for D9A, K13A, Q15A, and S16A peptides were similar to the consensus GPR peptide (Fig. 2 B). Alanine substitutions at the other key residues within the GPR motif indicated that the residues could be grouped as those causing 7–10-fold (4EED6, R18, and20DD21) or 50–70-fold (M19 and R23) shifts in IC50 values (Fig.2 B). The loss of affinity observed with the alanine substitutions at 4EED6 are consistent with the retention of bioactivity by the truncation mutant GPR3–24, whereas the loss of activity with the 7FF8 alanine substitutions was also observed by elimination of these residues in the GPR10–24 truncated peptide. The larger reduction in affinity observed with the M19 and R23 alanine substitutions indicate the importance of these residues within the core GPR peptide. Indeed, reversal of charge or hydrophobicity at these residues (M19D and R23F) essentially rendered these peptides inactive (3Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C. Bernard M. Chung P. Hazard III, S.

The inhibition of GTPγS binding and apparent stabilization of the GDP-bound conformation of Gαi by the GPR peptide likely involves two events, the initial binding of the peptide to G-protein, followed by a conformational change in Gαi itself. To determine whether the two events can be functionally dissociated, we performed two series of experiments. We first asked if mutant peptides that exhibited lower affinity in GTPγS binding assays were also deficient in inhibiting binding of a GPR-containing GST-AGS3 fusion protein to Gαi. In the second series of experiments, we determined whether truncated GPR peptides could act in a complementary fashion and whether they could antagonize the action of the GPR consensus peptide. Data generated from this series of experiments indicated that the loss of function in binding studies was also reflected in the protein interaction assays (Fig.3, A and B). The partial inhibition of GST-AGS3 binding to G-protein in the presence of GPR6–24 indicates that this peptide is not as potent as GPR3–24 or wild type peptide, likely due to the loss of the4EED6 acidic cluster (Fig. 2, A andB, and Fig. 3 B). These data indicated that G-protein interaction and inhibition of GTPγS binding could not be dissociated from each other. This point is further emphasized by data generated in another series of experiments (Fig. 3 C). A combination of the inactive GPR truncation peptides (GPR 1–15 and GPR 15–28) did not inhibit binding of GST-AGS3 to Gαi. Neither of the peptides antagonized the action of the consensus GPR peptide nor were they able to rescue the activity of nonfunctional, alanine-substituted GPR peptides (Fig. 3). These data confirm the importance of the spatial relationship within the core GPR motif. These data also indicate that the GPR domain must function as an intact unit and that there are multiple points of contact between the GPR domain and Gα. Although the GPR peptide clearly prefers Gαi over Gαo, subtle mutations within the core motif differentially effect peptide interaction with the two G-proteins (Fig.4 A). A screen of the mutant GPR peptides for selectivity indicated that inhibition of GTPγS binding to Gαo is completely eliminated by alanine substitutions within the core GPR motif that only minimally altered GTPγS binding to Gαi (Fig. 4 A). The difference in the interaction of the GPR peptide with Gαi versus Gαo is also observed by comparing the relative inhibition of GTPγS binding in the presence and absence of magnesium. The inhibition of GTPγS binding to Gαo is much more sensitive to magnesium as compared with the effects of the peptide on Gαi (Fig. 4 B). These data indicate that the GPR peptides can differentially target G-protein α subunits. Amino acids outside the GPR motif may also influence G-protein selectivity or bioactivity (see Discussion in Ref.4Peterson Y.K. Bernard M.L., Ma, H. Hazard III, S. Graber S.G. Lanier S.M. J. Biol.

The core GPR motif identified in the present study is indicated in Sequence 1. FF­LL­­­­­­­M­­QR SEQUENCE1Within this core, 7FF8,10LL11, and Q22 are absolutely required for bioactivity. The carboxyl terminus R23 and the M19 residue also play key roles in bioactivity as their mutation results in large shifts in affinity.

Minimizing the core GPR motif to its essential pharmacophores identified the chemical moieties within the GPR motif that regulate Gi/Go nucleotide exchange. By virtue of its novel mode of regulation of G-proteins, the core GPR motif provides an unexpected platform for the development of G-protein selective therapeutics.

Although these channels differ in the inactivation kinetics and sensitivity to ω-agatoxin IVA, the mechanism underlying these differences remains to be clarified. Alternative splicings of the Cacna1a transcript have been postulated to contribute to the respective properties, however, the splice variants responsible for P-type Ca2+ channels have not been identified. To explore P-type-specific splice variants, we aimed at cloning α12.1 from isolated mouse Purkinje cells using single-cell reverse transcription-PCR, because in Purkinje cells P-type currents dominate over the whole currents (>95%) with Q-type currents undetected. As a result, two novel splice variants were cloned. Compared with the previously cloned mouse α12.1, two novel variants had additional 48 amino acids at the amino termini, six single amino acid changes, and splicing variations at the exon 46/47 boundary, which produced different carboxyl termini. Furthermore, one variant had one RNA editing site. However, electrophysiological and pharmacological studies indicated that these variants did not generate P-type current in cultured cells. These results suggest that P-type-specific splice variants may exist but that post-translational processing or modification by uncharacterized interacting proteins is also required for generating the P-type current.

Among them, the α1 subunit is the largest and constitutes an ion-conduction pore, voltage sensor, and gating apparatus. Although the other auxiliary subunits modulate channel properties, the diversity of VDCCs comes primarily from the existence of multiple forms of the α1 subunits. Electrophysiologically and pharmacologically, VDCCs are divided into six types (L, N, P, Q, R, and T), and ten genetically different cDNAs, which encode the α1 subunit, have been identified. They are grouped into three families based on the similarities of deduced amino acid sequences (3Ertel E.A. Campbell K.P. Harpold M.M. Hofmann F. Mori Y. Perez-Reyes E. Schwartz A. Snutch T.P.

The Cav1 family (Cav1.1 through Cav1.4) includes channels containing α1S, α1C, α1D, and α1F, which constitute l-type Ca2+ channels. The Cav2 family (Cav2.1 through Cav2.3) includes channels containing α1A, α1B, and α1E, which constitute P/Q-type, N-type, and R-type Ca2+ channels, respectively. The Cav3 family (Cav3.1 through Cav3.3) includes channels containing α1G, α1H, and α1I, which mediate T-type Ca2+ currents. P/Q-type Ca2+ channels are expressed mainly in the central nervous system and contribute to neurotransmitter release (4Takahashi T. Momiyama A.

Recently, much attention has been paid to P/Q-type Ca2+ channels, because mutations in the α12.1 subunit were reported to cause several neurological disorders such as familial hemiplegic migraine, episodic ataxia type 2, and spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) (10Ophoff R.A.

Pathologically, SCA6 is marked by the severe loss of Purkinje cells, where only P-type Ca2+ channels are expressed, and relatively intact cerebellar granule cells, where both P- and Q-type Ca2+ channels are expressed (13Gomez C.M.

One of the reasons why the possible P-type-specific splice variants have not been cloned may be that the amount of P-type splice variants is quite small in the cDNA libraries. It is difficult to obtain cDNAs from specific cells by screening of a conventional cDNA library, because it is made up of cDNAs derived from heterogeneous cells. Recently single-cell reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was developed to investigate the expression of genes in a specific cell and has proven to be a useful tool for the identification of ion channel subunits (27Lambolez B. Audinat E. Bochet P. Crepel F. Rossier J. Neuron. 1992; 9: 247-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 28Miera E.V.-S. Rudy B. Sugimori M. Llinás R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7059-7064Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In this study, we applied the single-cell RT-PCR to cloning of α12.1 subunit from isolated mouse single Purkinje cells, where almost all the Ca2+ currents are P-type and no Q-type currents are recorded. C57BL/6N mice were anesthetized with methoxyflurane and decapitated, and the brains were quickly removed. Then cerebral cortices and cerebella were dissected. Total RNA was obtained from mouse cerebral cortices and cerebella using the standard acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction method (29Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 167: 156-159Crossref Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). To obtain a single Purkinje cell or granule cells, a mouse cerebellum was cut into 300-μm slices in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) saturated with 95% O2-5% CO2, and then the slices were incubated for 2 h at room temperature in the saturated ACSF to allow recovery from the injury due to slicing. The ACSF consisted of (in millimolar) 137 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 0.58 NaH2PO4, 1.2 MgCl2, 2.5 CaCl2, 21 NaHCO3, and 10 glucose. A single Purkinje cell was identified morphologically and then aspirated into a glass micropipette by applying negative pressure. Granule cells were also collected in a group using the same procedure. Aspirated single Purkinje cells or granule cells were directly expelled into thin-walled plastic tubes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Norwalk, CT) containing 5× First Strand buffer (4 μl), dNTP mixture (4 μl, 2.5 mm), RNase inhibitor (0.5 μl, 28,000 units/ml), dithiothreitol (2 μl, 0.1 m), and random hexamer (0.5 μl, 5 ng/μl) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Pomona, CA). The reaction mixture was incubated at 70 °C for 10 min and then placed on ice. SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (1 μl, 200 units/μl) (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD) was added to the mixture, and then the reaction mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 10 min, 42 °C for 50 min, and 70 °C for 15 min. After the treatment, 1 μl of RNase H was added, and the sample was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Primers were designed in reference to the sequence of the previously reported mouse α12.1 cDNA (30Fletcher C.F. Lutz C.M. O'Sullivan T.N. Shaughnessy J.D., Jr. Hawkes R. Frankel W.N. Copeland N.G.

To discriminate PCR products derived from the genomic DNA, all the primer pairs were designed so that each primer was located in different exons. Nested PCR was carried out to amplify α12.1 cDNA from single Purkinje cells. Single-cell cDNA (2.5 μl) was used as a template for the first PCR amplification. The reaction mixture contained: PCR-grade H2O (7.5 μl), 5× Advantage-GC PCR Buffer (5 μl), dNTP mixture (2.5 μl, 2.5 mm), GC Melt (2.5 μl, 5 m), each primer (2 μl, 2.5 μm), and 50× Advantage-GC cDNA polymerase mix (1 μl) (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The thermal cycling program for the first PCR was 35 cycles of 96 °C for 4 min, 60 °C (56 °C for some primers) for 1 min, and 72 °C for 3 min. The first PCR product (2.5 μl) was used as a template for the second PCR. The reaction mixture contained: PCR-grade H2O (10 μl), 10× Cloned Pfu DNA polymerase reaction buffer (2.5 μl), dimethyl sulfoxide (2.5 μl), dNTP mixture (2.5 μl, 2.5 mm), each primer (2 μl, 2.5 μm), andPfuTurbo DNA polymerase (1 μl, 2.5 units/μl) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The second PCR program was the same as the first except that the number of PCR cycles was 20 or 25. To obtain the 3′-downstream region, 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA end (3′-RACE) was performed initially with 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from mouse cerebellum using a Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reaction products were subcloned into pCR 2.1 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and sequenced using an ABI Prism 310 genetic analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Then reverse primers were designed so that they were located downstream from the termination codons of any reading frames (Ma1A3′R3 and Ma1A3′R4; Table I). With these primers, nested PCR was also performed with a single Purkinje cell as described above. All PCR products were gel-purified and subcloned into the HincII site of pUC18 and sequenced. We used two independent Purkinje cells to avoid possible PCR errors.Table IPrimer setsRegion, fragment sizeForward primerReverse primerPrimer name Primer sequences (5′→3′)Primer name Primer sequences (5′→3′)exon 1–6, 1001 bpOuter primersMaIA-5′-F1ACAGCCCGGCCAGCCTGAGCAMalA-R1AGGAGATCAGTCCAGCCTTCCATInner primersMalA-5′-F2AAGCTTTCGCCGCAGCAACAGCAGCCGMalA-R2CACTGGAAAACAGTGAGCACAGCexon 6–12, 785 bpOuter primersMalA-F5ACGACATCCAGGGTGAGTCGCMalA-R5AAGAGTGGAAGTAAGGCCGCGTInner primersMalA-F6GACAGAGGAGCCTGCCCGCAMalA-R6AACATTTCGGACATAAAGAGTCCTAAexon 11–19, 831 bpOuter primersMalA-F7GGTCTCCCTTCGCCAGAGCCAMalA-R7ACGGCTATGGACATGTTGGCTGInner primersMalA-F8TCACAAGAAGGAGAGAAGAATGCGMalA-R8TACCTCCTTGGCTTTCTGTAGAGexon 16–25, 1806 bpOuter primersMalA-ex16-F2TTTCAGATCCTGACTGGCGAAGATMalA-ex25R2CTTCAGCTTTGGCAGCCGCTTGInner primersMalA-ex16-F1CGGCATGGTGTTCTCCATCTAMalA-ex25-RAATGTCCTTTCCTTTGCTATTGCCAexon 23–29, 997 bpOuter primersMalA-F13TGCTGCGATATTTTGACTATGTTTTTMalA-R13GTACTCTTCCATCATCTTGTCTCCInner primersMalA-F14CAGGCGTGTTTACCTTTGAGATGMalA-R14CTGAAAGGTGATGATGATCAAGGCexon 28–36, 900 bpOuter primersMalA-F11GGTCCTCAAGCACTCAGTGGATMalA-R11CAGAAACGAGCACAGGAAGATGAAInner primersMalA-F12CATGGAGATGTCCATCTTCTACGTMalA-R12GTTGCCGCAGTCTGCCGTGAGexon 34–42, 959 bpOuter primersMalA-F9GTGTTTGGCAACATCGGCATTGAMalA-R9AGGCATGTCGATGGGTGGCCCInner primersMalA-F10GAGGATGAATTCCAAATCACGGAGMalA-R10GCTCCAGGTGCCAGTCTTCTGexon 41–47, 1364/1506 bpOuter primersMalA-F3AACCGGACACCACTCATGTTCCAMalA-3′-R3TAATAAGCTTGGCGTGGCCCInner primersMalA-F4ATGGAGCCTCCATCACCAACACAMalA-3′-R4TCTAGATAGCACTCCCGTGGGTCTGAexon 41–46, 821 bpOuter primersMalA-F3AACCGGACACCACTCATGTTCCAMalA-3′-R3TAATAAGCTTGGCGTGGCCCInner primersMalA-F4ATGGAGCCTCCATCACCAACACAMalA-R4TCTAGACTACTGTCTGTGTGTThe exon numbers are deduced from those of human CACNA1Agene (10Ophoff R.A.

The sequences which are exhibited asbold letters are added to the primers for subcloning. Eight independent nested PCR reactions were designed so that the resulting PCR products covered the entire coding region of the mouse α12.1 subunit. The adjacent PCR products possessed overlapping sequences in which unique restriction sites occurred, making it easy to connect all the fragments to construct expression vectors (pcDNAI/Amp, Invitrogen, was used as the backbone vector). With regard to the most 3′ region, two fragments with different sizes (1364 and 1506 bp) were amplified (TableI). The α12.1 with the shorter 3′ sequence was designed MPI and the longer MPII. Thus, MPI and MPII differed only in their 3′ sequence corresponding to the exon 41–47 (Fig. 1 C). PKCRα2 and PKCRβ that encode α2δ and β1a subunits, respectively, were described previously (32Zong S. Zhou J. Tanabe T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 1117-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The expression vector for the β2a or β3 subunit was constructed by subcloning the inserted fragment of pBH19 or pBH23 (33Hullin R. Singer-Lahat D. Freichel M. Biel M. Dascal N. Hofmann F. Flockerzi V. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) into pKCRH2 (34Mishina M. Kurosaki T. Tobimatsu T. Morimoto Y. Noda M. Yamamoto T. Terao M. Lindstrom J. Takahashi T. Kuno M. Numa S. Nature. 1984; 307: 604-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), respectively. The expression vector for the β4 subunit was constructed by subcloning the inserted fragment of β k213 (35Castellano A. Wei X. Birnbaumer L. Perez-Reyes E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12359-12366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) into pcDNAI/Amp. We also constructed a plasmid carrying the mouse α12.1 whose coding region terminated in the end of exon 46 and designated this version of α12.1 as MPc. A stop codon (TAG) was artificially introduced immediately after the end of exon 46 by PCR using MPII as a template and primer MalAF4 and MalAR4 (Table I) as a mutagenic primer. Then MPc was constructed by connecting the artificially made exon 41–46 fragment together with the seven same fragments that were used to construct MPI or MPII. Fragments with a size of 780 bp containing nucleotide (nt) 6358 were PCR-amplified from cDNAs that were prepared from single Purkinje cells, cerebellar granule cells, or cerebral cortex. The primers used were Ma1A-F4 (Table I) as a forward primer and MalA-RE (5′-TGGGCGAGCGGGACCAGCG-3′) as a reverse primer. Each PCR product was subjected to both direct sequencing and subcloning into pCR 2.1. For control experiments, we used two plasmids that contained the exon 41–47 fragment of MPI and MPII. The Escherichia colicolonies were transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond-N+, Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Uppsala, Sweden). The membranes were hybridized with 18-mer oligonucleotide probe 6358C (5′-AGAACCAACGGTACCACC-3′) or 6358T (5′-AGAACCAATGGTACCACC-3′). The probes were 32P-end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP (>5000 Ci/mmol) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA). Hybridization was performed at 37 °C for 16 h in 4× SSC containing 0.1% SDS, 1× Denhardt's reagent, and 50 μg/ml herring sperm DNA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). After hybridization, the membranes were washed in 1× SSC with 0.1% SDS at 37 °C for 20 min. Autoradiography was performed with Hyperfilm-ECL (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) at −80 °C using an intensifying screen. The procedures of cell culture and transfection were the same as those previously described (16Toru S. Murakoshi T. Ishikawa K. Saegusa H. Fujigasaki H. Uchihara T. Nagayama S. Osanai M. Mizusawa H. Tanabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10893-10898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In brief, human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (Invitrogen). The α12.1 subunits were transiently co-expressed with α2δ and one of the β subunits, and pEGFP-C2 (CLONTECH) was used as a transfection marker. Transfection was performed with a calcium phosphate precipitation method (Mammalian Transfection kit, Stratagene). Electrophysiological analysis was performed 36–72 h after transfection. Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass (GC150F-4, Warner, Instruments, Hamden, CT) and filled with a solution consisting of (in millimolar) 140 CsCl, 2 MgCl2, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 3 ATP·Mg (pH 7.4 with CsOH). Pipette resistance ranged from 2 to 4 MΩ. The external solution consists of (in millimolar) 15 BaCl2, 145 tetraethylammonium chloride, 10 HEPES, and 10 glucose (pH 7.4 with tetraethylammonium-OH). Barium currents were recorded at room temperature (22–25 °C) under a whole-cell mode of the patch clamp recording with an amplifier (EPC-9, HEKA, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany). The holding potential was −80 mV unless otherwise stated. Series resistance was electronically compensated by 50–80%. All illustrated and analyzed currents were corrected for remaining capacitance and leakage currents using the −P/4 method. Data were filtered at 3 kHz (four-pole Bessel filter) and sampled at 10 kHz. The software (Pulse+PulseFit 8.09, HEKA) was used for data acquisition and analysis. In the experiments with ω-Aga IVA (Peptide Institute, Inc., Osaka, Japan), the external solution was supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml cytochrome c to prevent nonspecific binding of the toxin. All data were presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using an unpaired Student'st test. We cloned two novel splice variants of α12.1 subunit from the mouse Purkinje cell using the single-cell RT-PCR technique. Compared with the sequences of rabbit α12.1 subunit (BI-1) or rat α12.1 (rbA-1), the previously reported mouse α12.1 lacked 46 or 48 amino acids in the amino terminus, respectively (30Fletcher C.F. Lutz C.M. O'Sullivan T.N. Shaughnessy J.D., Jr. Hawkes R. Frankel W.N. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 607-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). However, α12.1 variants we cloned in this study commonly contained the 5′ sequences homologous to those of BI-1 and rbA-1, suggesting that the amino termini of our newly cloned α12.1 variants are longer by 48 amino acid residues than that of the previously reported mouse α12.1. Together with this difference, two novel α12.1 had single base substitutions at 16 sites located from exon 1 to exon 41 compared with the previously reported mouse α12.1. We confirmed these 16 single base substitutions in two independent Purkinje cells. Therefore, PCR errors are unlikely to be the cause of the substitutions. Ten of the 16 substitutions were silent polymorphisms leading to no amino acid changes, and the rest of them resulted in amino acid changes. Two altered amino acids found in II–III loop (L886P, D1085N) were identical to the sequence of rbA-1, and the remaining four found in repeat I (P79S, F82L) and repeat III (F1409L, F1433L) were conserved in BI-1, rbA-1, and human α12.1 subunit (Fig.1 A). In the human Ca v 2.1 gene, differential splice acceptor usage at the boundary of intron 46/exon 47 is known to yield an α12.1 variant with a longer carboxyl terminus (11Zhuchenko O. Bailey J. Bonnen P. Ashizawa T. Stockton D.W. Amos C. Dobyns W.B. Subramony S.H. Zoghbi H.Y. Lee C.C. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar), because the stop codon in the beginning of exon 47 was no longer in-frame. The same kind of variant was also found in rat α12.1 (36Ligon B. Boyd III, A.E. Dunlap K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13905-13911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). But the nucleotide sequence of mouse α12.1 corresponding to the variant with a longer carboxyl-tail has not been reported so far. This carboxyl-terminal sequence, which is thought to be encoded by exon 47, is expressed abundantly in rat Purkinje cell bodies and dendrites as revealed by an immunohistochemical study (17Restituito S. Thompson R.M. Eliet J. Raike R.S. Riedl M. Charnet P. Gomez C.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6394-6403Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and may affect channel properties. Therefore, we tried to clone the mouse exon 47 by 3′-RACE. Because a single Purkinje cell has an extremely small amount of RNA, it is expected to be difficult to apply 3′-RACE. Therefore, we first applied 3′-RACE to mouse cerebellar poly(A)+ RNA. As a result, a novel fragment with a size of 1504 bp was cloned, and sequence analysis revealed that there were termination codons in all the reading frames on the sequence. Then we designed reverse primers (Ma1A-3′-R3, Ma1A-3′-R4; Table I) to perform RT-PCR with single Purkinje cells. Two fragments with different sizes of 1364 and 1506 bp were amplified. We assigned the novel α12.1 with the shorter fragment MPI, and the α12.1 with the longer fragment MPII. The nucleotide sequences of MPI and MPII were completely the same except for these most 3′ sequences, where several distinctive features were found in the two variants (Fig. 1,B and C). First, a single nucleotide conversion (C to T) was observed at nt 6358 in MPI. This conversion led to an amino acid substitution from arginine to tryptophan (Fig. 1,B and C). Second, there were two variations at the beginning of exon 47. In MPI, 5 nucleotide residues (GGCAG) were inserted, whereas in MPII 3 nucleotide residues (TAG) were deleted, when compared with the previously published sequence (30Fletcher C.F. Lutz C.M.

https://openalex.org/W2314151894,"The catalytic activity of the c-Abl tyrosine kinase is tightly regulated by its Src homology 3 (SH3) domain through a complex mechanism that may involve intramolecular binding to Pro242 in the linker region between the SH2 and catalytic domains as well as interactions with a trans-inhibitor. We analysed the effect of mutation or replacement of SH3 on c-Abl tyrosine kinase activity and transformation. Random mutagenesis of SH3 identified several novel point mutations that dysregulated c-Abl kinase activity in vivo, but the RT loop was insensitive to mutational activation. Activating SH3 mutations abolished binding of proline-rich SH3 ligands in vitro, while mutations at Ser140 in the connector between the SH3 and SH2 domains activated Abl kinase activity in vivo and in vitro but did not impair SH3 ligand-binding. Abl was regulated efficiently when its SH3 domain was replaced with a heterologous SH3 from c-Src that binds a different spectrum of proline-rich ligands, but not by substitution of a modular WW domain with similar ligand-binding specificity. These results suggest that the SH3 domain regulates Abl principally by binding to the atypical intramolecular ligand Pro242 rather than a canonical PxxP ligand. Coordination between the SH3 and SH2 domains mediated by the connector region may be required for regulation of Abl even in the absence of SH2 ligand binding."
https://openalex.org/W2331286807,"Bone morphogenetic protein-6 (BMP-6) is a member of the transforming growth factor-ß superfamily. In murine skin, BMP-6 is highly expressed in postmitotic keratinocytes from day 15.5 p.c. till day 6 p.p. Expression in adult skin remains at very low levels, but pathological conditions such as wounding induce the expression of BMP-6. We demonstrate that tumor promotion by TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) also induces expression of BMP-6 in suprabasal keratinocytes. This induction is due to post-transcriptional regulation since the level of BMP-6 mRNA remained unchanged. We performed two-stage skin carcinogenesis experiments with transgenic mice epidermally overexpressing BMP-6. These mice display augmented mitotic indices in normal and TPA-treated epidermis when compared to controls. Despite this hyperproliferation, BMP-6 transgenics showed a delayed development and strong suppression of benign and malignant skin tumor formation. In order to resolve this paradox we determined apoptotic frequencies as well as the expression of constituents of AP-1 (activator protein-1) which is essential for tumor promotion. A higher rate of apoptotic keratinocytes was detectable in transgenic mice versus controls and a downregulation of mRNA for jun/fos family members in transgenic skin after TPA-treatment. Thus expression of BMP-6 augments apoptosis and downregulates the transcription of AP-1 family members thereby establishing tumor resistance."

https://openalex.org/W2064757402,"Hundreds of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and at least six GPCR kinases have been identified, but the only GPCR phosphatase that has been definitively demonstrated is the rhodopsin phosphatase encoded by the rdgC locus of Drosophila. Mutations in rdgC result in defects in termination of the light response and cause severe retinal degeneration. In the current work, we demonstrate that RDGC binds to calmodulin, and a mutation in an IQ motif that eliminates the calmodulin/RDGC interaction prevents dephosphorylation of rhodopsin in vivo and disrupts termination of the photoresponse. Our data indicate that RDGC is a novel calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase and raise the possibility that regulation of other GPCRs through dephosphorylation may be controlled by calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatases related to RDGC."

Gene expression was analysed by multiprobe RNAse protection, Western blotting and in vitro kinase assays. No differences were observed between RA sensitive and RA resistant ovarian carcinoma cells in the levels of expression of many cell cycle genes including cyclin A, B and E, cdk 2,4 and 6, E2F-1, E2F-2, E2F-3, E2F-4, E2F-5, DP-1 and DP-2. However, RA sensitive CA-OV3 cells expressed higher levels of p53, p27, p21, and p16 compared to RA resistant SK-OV3 cells. In addition, RA treatment of CA-OV3 cells resulted in a significant decrease in hyperphosphorylated RB and RB-2/p130 and corresponding significant increases in the levels of hypophosphorylated and/or partially phosphorylated RB-2/p130 protein and hypophosphorylated RB. Also, RA treatment increased expression of the cdk inhibitor p27 and decreased activity of cdk 2, cdk 4 and cdk 6. Finally, amounts of p27-cyclin E and RB-2/p130-E2F4 complexes were found to increase in CA-OV3 cells growth arrested by RA. These results suggest that the pocket protein pathways are critical targets for retinoid suppression of ovarian carcinoma cell growth."

We isolated an aptamer directed against NPY from a nuclease-resistant RNA library. Mapping experiments with N-terminally, C-terminally, and centrally truncated analogues of NPY revealed that the aptamer recognizes the C terminus of NPY. Individual replacement of the four arginine residues at positions 19, 25, 33, and 35 byl-alanine showed that arginine 33 is essential for binding. The aptamer does not recognize pancreatic polypeptide, a highly homologous Y4 receptor-specific peptide of the gut. Furthermore, the affinity of the aptamer to the Y5 receptor-selective agonist [Ala31,Aib32]NPY and the Y1/Y5 receptor-binding peptide [Leu31,Pro34]NPY was considerably reduced, whereas Y2 receptor-specific NPY mutants were bound well by the aptamer. Accordingly, the NPY epitope was recognized by the Y2 receptor, and the aptamer was highly similar. This Y2 receptor mimicking effect was further confirmed by competition binding studies. Whereas the aptamer competed with the Y2 receptor for binding of [3H]NPY with high affinity, a low affinity displacement of [3H]NPY was observed at the Y1 and the Y5 receptors. Consequently, competition at the Y2 receptor occurred with a considerably lower Ki value compared with the Y1 and Y5 receptors.

Only recently the first crystal structure of a G-protein-coupled receptor, rhodopsin, has been solved and provided insight into the molecular mechanism of GPCR activation (15.Palczewski K.

However, these structural analyses are highly advanced and cannot be considered routine. Furthermore, because the ligand is covalently bound in rhodopsin, the process of ligand approaching is still unknown. Accordingly, biochemical methods that facilitate our understanding of GPCRs are urgently required. All current information on structure/activity or structure/affinity relationships of NPY and its G-protein-coupled receptor subtypes have been obtained by indirect methods such as site-directed mutagenesis in transmembrane regions and extracellular loops of the receptors (16.Sautel M.

Doods H.N. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 271: R11-R13Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 21.Söll R.M. Dinger M.C. Lundell I. Larhammer D. Beck-Sickinger A.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2828-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These small organic molecules, however, do not necessarily bind to the receptor in a way similar to the endogenous ligand. For example, only partial overlapping of the binding site has been shown for BIBP3226, and in the substance P and angiotensin systems completely different binding sites for agonist and antagonist were identified (22.Elling C.E. Nielsen S.M. Schwartz T.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Mapping of the Y1 receptor with anti-receptor antibodies has provided some insight into the hypothetical binding topology of NPY (23.Wieland H.A. Eckard C.P. Doods H.N. Beck-Sickinger A.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar); however, the use of polyclonal antibodies directed against the 16–20-mer receptor segments only provided limited structural information. We therefore chose an alternative approach to characterize the interaction of NPY with its receptors. Here we describe the selection of aptamers that specifically recognize NPY with good affinities. The binding of the aptamer to NPY in relation to a series of NPY agonists or antagonists was characterized. Finally, we investigated the quality of the aptamer as a functional and selective NPY competitor by displacing NPY from its receptors Y1, Y2, and Y5. The Nα-Fmoc-protected amino acids were obtained from Alexis (Switzerland) and Novabiochem. The side chain protecting groups are as follows: tert-butyl for Asp, Glu, Ser, Thr, and Tyr; t-butoxycarbonyl for Lys; trityl for Asn, Gln, and His; and 2,2,5,7,8-pentamethylchroman-6-sulfonyl for Arg. The 4-(2′,4′-dimethoxyphenyl-Fmoc-aminomethyl)-phenoxy (Rink Amide) resin was obtained from Novabiochem. Peptides were synthesized by automated multiple solid phase peptide synthesis on a peptide synthesizer (Syro, MultiSynTech, Bochum, Germany) using Rink Amide resin (30 mg, resin loading 0.6 mmol/g). Nα-Fmoc amino acids were attached by a double coupling procedure with 10-fold excess of amino acid, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt), 1,3-diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC) in DMF (2 × 40 min). The Fmoc deprotection step was accomplished with 40% piperidine in DMF for 3 min, 20% piperidine for 7 min, and finally 40% piperidine for 5 min. Amino acid sequences of the peptides are listed in Table II. The sequences of the two random NPYs were determined by random combination of the 36 amino acids of NPY. Prior to cleavage of the truncated NPY variants from the resin, they were N-terminally biotinylated. The Ahx spacer was introduced as final step during automated synthesis. N-terminal biotinylation was achieved by using 5 eq of biotin; HOBt and DIC were dissolved in DMF (0.5m). One hour after addition of this solution to the pre-swollen resin, 5 eq of N-ethyldiisopropanolamine (DIPEA) were added. The coupling reaction was stopped after 15 h by washing the resin with DMF, methanol, methylene chloride, DMF, and diethyl ether (4 times at 1 ml each). The peptides were cleaved from the resins with a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid/thioanisole/p-thiocresol (90:5:5 v/v), precipitated from ice-cold diethyl ether, collected by centrifugation, washed with diethyl ether 4 times, and lyophilized from water/tert-butanol (3:1 w/w). Characterization of the peptides was achieved by mass spectrometry and analytical high pressure liquid chromatography.Table IIBinding of anti-NPY aptamer (DP3) was probed with a panel of immobilized peptide variants of porcine NPY (pNPY)EntryNamePeptide sequenceBindingNPYBiotin-YPSKPDNPGEDAPAEDLARYYSALRHYINLITRQRY-NH2++1.10Biotin-YPSKPDNPGE-CONH2−2.20Biotin-PDNPGEDAPAEDLARY-CONH2−3.25–34Biotin-RHYINLITRQ-NH2−4.25–36Biotin-RHYINLITRQRY-NH2−5.18–28Biotin-ARYYSALRHYI-NH2−6.18–32Biotin-ARYYSALRHYINLIT-NH2−7.18–34Biotin-ARYYSALRHYINLITRQ-NH2−8.Ahx5–24Biotin-YPSKRHYINLITRQRY-NH2++9.13–36Biotin-PAEDLARYYSALRHYINLITRQRY-NH2++10.18–36Biotin-ARYYSALRHYINLITRQRY-NH2++11.[Ala19]18–36Biotin-AAYYSALRHYINLITRQRY-NH2++12.[Ala25]18–36Biotin-ARYYSALAHYINLITRQRY-NH2+13.[Ala33]18–36Biotin-ARYYSALRHYINLITAQRY-NH2−14.[Ala35]18–36Biotin-ARYYSALRHYINLITRQAY-NH2+15.[Leu31,Pro34]Biotin-YPSKPDNPGEDAPAEDLARYYSALRHYINLLTRPRY-NH2−16.[Ala31,Aib32]Biotin-YPSKPDNPGEDAPAEDLARYYSALRHYINLAAibRQRY-NH2+In constructs 1–7, 9, and 10 the remaining amino acid residues of several N- and C-terminally truncated porcine NPY variants are indicated on the left.

The RNA library was synthesized by in vitro T7 transcription from a PCR-amplified double-stranded DNA pool (MicMod 40N) as follows: 5′-TCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAAAGGGAAGCTTGAG-40N-AGAAGAAGGAACGAGCGTACGGATCCGATC-3′, 5′-PCR primer Mic-(1–39), 5′-TCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAAAGGGAAGCTTGAG-3′ (underlines indicate the T7 promoter and boldface indicates the HindIII restriction site), 3′-PCR primer Mic-(1–25), 3′-CTTCCTGCTCGCATGCCTAGGCTAG-5′ (boldface indicates the BamHI restriction site) as described (24.Klug S.J. Huttenhofer A. Kromayer M. Famulok M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6676-6681Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The T7 in vitro transcription was done in a standard fashion by incubating the DNA template with T7 polymerase (250 units) and ATP, GTP, 2′NH2-CTP, and 2′NH2-UTP (all at 1 mm) for 10–12 h at 37 °C in 40 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8, containing 12 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm spermidine, 0.002% Triton X-100, and 4% polyethylene glycol. The biotinylated NPY was immobilized on streptavidin-agarose (Pierce) in 0.25× PBS, pH 7.4, at 4 °C overnight. The coupling efficiency quantified spectroscopically was about 95%. In the first cycle 3.8 nmol (2.3 library equivalents) of the 32P-labeled RNA were dissolved in PBS binding buffer (Invitrogen, 155 mm NaCl, 1.1 mmKH2PO4, 3 mmNa2HPO4·7H2O, pH 7.4), heated for 2 min at 90 °C and then renatured for 10 min on ice in the presence of 1 mm MgCl2 to allow proper secondary structure formation. To remove RNAs with affinity for streptavidin-agarose material, a counter selection using streptavidin-agarose was performed in cycles 1–9. The initial two fractions of the streptavidin-agarose flow-through were incubated with the immobilized NPY for 1 h at 37 °C by mixing gently. The matrix was washed with 100 column volumes of binding buffer. NPY-bound RNA was eluted with 7 m urea containing 3 mmEDTA and quantified by scintillation counting. Further treatment and amplification was performed as described previously. In cycles following round 9, the immobilized NPY concentration was decreased gradually from 26 to 2.5 μm, and selections were done in the presence of 1% heparin and 10% fetal calf serum. After cycle 12 the enriched pool was PCR-amplified with primers Mic-(1–39) and Mic-(1–25), cloned, and sequenced as described (25.Famulok M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 1698-1706Crossref Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Binding studies were done with 1.5 nm 5′-32P-labeled RNA. Representatives of each sequence group were incubated with peptide dilution series ranging from 5 nm to 7 μm in 50 μl of binding buffer (0.9 mmKH2PO4, 5 mmNa2HPO4, 70 mm NaCl, 1.3 mm KCl, 1% heparin, 20 μg of streptavidin, pH 7.6) for 1 h at 37 °C. Streptavidin was added to improve the retention of the peptide on the nitrocellulose filter, and filter-binding studies were performed as described. The percentage of input RNA retained on each filter was quantified by PhosphorImaging. For RNA ligands exhibiting monophasic binding equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd values) were determined using Equation 1(26.Jellinek D. Green L.S. Bell C. Janjic N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10450-10456Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), (f/2Rt)=(Pt+Rt+Kd)−((Pt+Rt+Kd)2−4PtRt)1/2Equation 1 The various NPY derivatives (Table II) were immobilized on streptavidin-agarose. The internally32P-labeled RNA (50 pmol) was incubated with the coupled peptides (7 μm derivatized agarose material). After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C the mixture was placed into a Bio-Rad column, and the nonbinding aptamers were removed by washing with 100 column volumes of binding buffer, and the amount of the complexed RNA was determined by scintillation counting. For competition of NPY-receptor interaction on cells, SK-N-MC cells (neuroblastoma cell line) expressing endogenously the hY1 receptor, SMS-KAN cells (neuroblastoma cell line) expressing endogenously hY2, and baby hamster kidney cells transfected with the rY5 receptor were cultured as described (27.Eckard C.P. Cabrele C. Wieland H.A. Beck-Sickinger A.G. Molecules. 2001; 6: 448-467Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 28.Rist B. Wieland H.A. Willim K.D. Beck-Sickinger A.G. J. Pept. Sci. 1995; 1: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested at 100% confluence in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.02% EDTA (SK-N-MC cells and SMS-KAN cells) or in the presence of trypsin (baby hamster kidney cells), resuspended in incubation buffer (minimal essential medium, 1% bovine serum albumin, 1% Pefabloc, and 1% Bacitracin), and counted. After centrifugation (800 rpm for 5 min) the pellet was resuspended in the incubation buffer and diluted to 2 × 106 cells/ml. 200 μl of cell suspension (5 × 105 cells) were incubated simultaneously with 25 μl of oligonucleotide solution in increasing concentrations and a constant amount of [3H]propionyl-NPY to give a total volume of 250 μl. After 1.5 h at room temperature, incubation was terminated by centrifugation for 5 min at 3200 rpm at 4 °C. The pellets were washed with cold PBS, resuspended in PBS, and mixed with scintillation mixture, and the 3H radioactivity was measured. To test for and to quantify the unspecific binding of 3H-labeled NPY to the cells containing the NPY receptors, a 1000-fold increased concentration of unlabeled NPY was added. Experiments were repeated independently three to four times in triplicate each. Values of IC50 were calculated with the program GraphPadPrism 3.02 using the “sigmoidal dose response (variable slope)” Equation 2, Y=(respBottom+(respTop−respBottom))×(1+10(log IC50−x)·Hillslope)−1Equation 2 where Y indicates response, whereas Ystarts at bottom (respBottom) and goes to top (respTop) with sigmoidal shape; x indicates logarithm of concentration of aptamer. Equation 2 is also designated as the “four parameter logistic equation.” Values of Ki were calculated according to the method of Cheng and Prusoff (29.Cheng Y. Prussoff W.H. Biochem.

In vitro selection of random oligonucleotide libraries has been used to isolate RNA, single-stranded DNA, or modified RNA ligands with high affinity for diverse targets (30.Gold L. Polisky B.

This modification is known to protect against the majority of serum nucleases so that such aptamers can be applied in the presence of biological materials in which normal RNA would rapidly degrade (39.Eaton B.E. Pieken W.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 837-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar,40.Heidenreich O. Pieken W. Eckstein F. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). As the C-terminal pentapeptide of NPY has recently been shown (19.Cabrele C. Beck-Sickinger A.G. J. Pept. Sci. 2000; 6: 97-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) to be essential for its interaction with all receptor subtypes, we immobilized NPY via N-terminal biotinylation on streptavidin-agarose to ensure maximal accessibility of the C terminus (Fig. 1A). From an RNA pool with a complexity of 9 × 1014 different sequences in which all pyrimidine residues were substituted by 2′-amino-2′-deoxy derivatives, anti-NPY-aptamers were selected in 12 cycles of iterative selection and amplification (Fig. 1). Fig. 1B shows the concentration-dependent binding of NPY to the unselected pool and the enriched pool from cycle 12, determined by nitrocellulose filtration. Whereas the cycle 12 library reaches saturation at an NPY concentration of 5 μm, no significant retention of the unselected pool was detected. Therefore, the affinity of the cycle 12 pool for NPY had improved at least 3 orders of magnitude compared with the starting pool. Cloning and sequencing of 30 clones from cycle 12 revealed one major (>80%) and a minor (7%) family of sequences and three orphans (Fig. 2) indicating that the pool diversity was decreased considerably after cycle 12.Figure 2Sequences of 2′-aminopyrimidine RNA ligands selected from the cycle 12 pool. For each clone only the variable 40-nucleotide region is shown. Parentheses show the number of identical clones.

Nucleotides highlighted in gray reflect point mutations; − indicates deletions or insertions in relation to the most abundant clone DP11.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next determined Kd values of representative clones from each family for binding to full-length NPY by titration experiments using nitrocellulose filtration. As shown in Table I, DP3 from sequence class II exhibited a Kd of 370 nm, representing the tightest NPY binding aptamer. DP11, a member of the most abundant class I aptamers bound with 470 nm, orphans showed only weak (DP25) or no affinity (DP14 and DP19; Table I, and data not shown). As negative controls, we also tested the unselected pool RNA for binding to NPY and the binding behavior of DP3 to a version of NPY with randomly scrambled sequence (scNPY, Table I). We found no affinity in either case showing that NPY recognition occurs with high sequence specificity both for the RNA and the peptide. Further mapping and specificity experiments were performed with clone DP3 (see below).Table IKd values of anti-NPY aptamers and the unselected pool to full-length NPY, scrambled NPY, truncated versions of NPY, and human pancreatic peptide (hPP)Aptamer cloneKdNPYaBiotinylated full-length NPY.ScNPYbSequence of the scrambled NPY, SKPQRDANREPTRYAIYDYSNPDIELHYLRPAYALG-NH2.18–36cAmino acids 1–17 were deleted.13–36dAmino acids 1–12 were deleted.Ahx5–24eAmino acids 5–24 were substituted by an aminohexanoic acid spacer.hPPfSequence of hPP, APLEPVYPGDNATPEQMAQYAADLRRYINMLTRPRY-NH2.μmDP30.37NA1.160.760.71NADP40.41DP110.47PoolNANANANANANAKd values were determined in the presence of streptavidin and heparin by filter binding assays and calculated as described.g.

We next sought to identify the epitope on NPY recognized by the aptamer DP3 by comparing its binding behavior to a variety of truncated analogues of NPY with that of the full-length peptide. First, we mapped the discrete binding region on NPY minimally required for complex formation with the aptamer. The results are summarized in Tables I and II. NPY fragments comprising central domains of the N and C terminus, respectively, do not show any detectable interaction with DP3 (entries 1–7, Table II). Similarly, the C-terminal construct 18–34 (entry 7, Table II), which lacks the two C-terminal amino acid residues, Arg35 and Tyr36, shows no detectable interaction with DP3. Interestingly, construct 18–36 (Table I and 2, entry 10) containing Arg35 and Tyr36, which is otherwise identical to 18–34, is recognized by DP3 with the same order of magnitude as full-length NPY. The same is true for construct 13–36 (Table I and 2, entry 9). In this sense, DP3 binding to NPY correlates with the requirements of NPY complexation by all of its receptor subtypes which also do not bind NPY constructs lacking the C-terminal amino acid (19.Cabrele C. Beck-Sickinger A.G. J. Pept. Sci. 2000; 6: 97-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Peptide 25–36 did not show any detectable affinity to DP3 (Table II, entry 4). Likewise, this peptide competes only weakly NPY bound to any receptor subtype (data not shown). In contrast, the well characterized centrally truncated Y2 receptor-selective agonist, Ahx-(5–24) (Table II, entry 8), in which amino acid residues 5–24 are substituted by an aminohexyl spacer shows restoration of the binding to DP3 in the same order of magnitude as full-length NPY. We next investigated a set of analogues in which arginine residues that are thought to play an important role for receptor-ligand interaction were replaced, in order to determine the role of individual amino acid residues for NPY/DP3 complexation. All four arginines of NPY were individually substituted by alanines (Table II, entries 11–14). These residues were chosen because we initially assumed that positively charged arginine side chains are likely to contribute strongly to the binding affinity between DP3 and the NPY C terminus. The R19A substitution did not affect aptamer binding (Table II, entry 11), whereas a substantial reduction of binding was observed for the R25A and the R35A substitutions (Table II, entries 12 and 14). In contrast, when arginine 33 was substituted for alanine, the peptide completely lost its affinity to the aptamer (Table II, entry 13) To test for specificity of the aptamer DP3"
https://openalex.org/W2053595697,"One of the most effective ways to kill cancer cells is by treatment of tumours with radiation. However, the administered dose of radiation to the tumour is limited by normal tissue toxicity. Strategies which decrease normal tissue exposure relative to tumour dose are urgently sought. One such promising scheme involves gene transfer, leading to the introduction of transporters specific for pharmaceuticals which can be labelled with radionuclides. We have previously demonstrated in vitro, that transfer of the noradrenaline transporter (NAT) gene, under viral promoter control, induces in host cells the active accumulation of the radiopharmaceutical [131I]meta-iodobenzylguanidine ([131I]MIBG) which results in kill of clonogens. We now report 17-fold enhancement of [131I]MIBG uptake by UVW glioma cells transfected with the NAT gene whose expression is driven by the human telomerase RNA (hTR) promoter (70% the uptake achieved by the strong viral promoter). Multicellular spheroids composed of hTR–NAT-transfected UVW cells exhibited dose-dependent susceptibility to treatment with [131I]MIBG. This was demonstrated by decreased survival of clonogens and complete sterilization of clonogens derived from spheroids and also failure of spheroids to regrow after administration of 7 MBq/ml [131I]MIBG. These data suggest hTR regulated expression of NAT may be an effective gene therapy strategy."

https://openalex.org/W2314593430,"Cytokines can influence the interactions between members of the integrin cell adhesion receptor family and the extracellular matrix thereby potentially affecting cell function and promoting cell adhesion, growth and migration of malignant astrocytoma tumor cells. As malignant astrocytoma cells synthesize TGF-β1 in vivo, we analysed the effects of TGF-β1 on signaling events associated with integrin receptor ligation, focusing on the effects on paxillin, a phosphorylated adaptor protein, that acts as a scaffold for signaling molecules recruited to focal adhesions. TGF-β1-stimulation of primary astrocytes and serum-starved U-251MG malignant astrocytoma cells attached to fibronectin induced a substantial increase in the levels of paxillin protein (fivefold increase at 2.0 ng/ml) in a dose- and time-dependent manner compared to the levels observed on plating onto fibronectin in the absence of stimulation. In the astrocytoma cells, this resulted in an increase in the pool of tyrosine-phosphorylated paxillin, although it did not appear to alter the extent of phosphorylation of the paxillin molecules. In contrast, in primary astrocytes the protein levels were upregulated in the absence of a parallel increase in phosphorylation. The TGF-β1-stimulated increase in paxillin levels required ligation of the fibronectin receptor, as it was not induced when the cells were plated onto vitronectin, collagen or laminin. The increase in the pool of paxillin on TGF-β1 stimulation of the fibronectin-plated astrocytoma cells was associated with an increase in translation, but was not associated with an increase in the steady-state levels of paxillin mRNA. Stimulation with TGF-β1 on a fibronectin substrate increased subsequent attachment and spreading of U-251MG cells onto fibronectin and, to a lesser extent, vitronectin, but not collagen. Our results indicate that physiologic levels of TGF-β1 stimulate the expression of paxillin protein at the level of translation through a process that requires engagement of the fibronectin receptor, and promotes attachment and spreading of malignant astrocytoma cells on fibronectin."
https://openalex.org/W2078739323,"We have previously shown that a retinoic acid receptor (RAR) antagonist BMS453, which does not activate RAR-dependent gene transcription in breast cells, inhibits normal breast cell growth. In this study we have investigated the mechanisms by which this retinoid receptor antagonist inhibits cell growth. Both all trans retinoic acid (atRA) and BMS453 inhibited the proliferation of normal breast cell growth without significantly inducing apoptosis. Both retinoids caused a G1 block in the cell cycle with an increase in the proportion of cells in G0/G1 and a decrease in the proportion of cells in S phase. We then investigated the effects of the retinoids on molecules that regulate the G1 to S transition. These studies demonstrated that both atRA and BMS453 induce Rb hypophosphorylation and decrease CDK2 kinase activity. We then studied the effect of the retinoids on the expression of CDK inhibitors. atRA and BMS453 increased total p21 protein levels and CDK2-bound p21 protein, but did not change CDK4-bound p21. These results suggest that atRA and BMS453 increase p21, decrease CDK2 kinase activity, which in turn leads to hypophosphorylation of Rb and G1 arrest. Because transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) has been proposed as a mediator of retinoid-induced growth inhibition, we next investigated whether TGFbeta mediates the anti-proliferative effect of atRA and BMS453 in normal breast cells. These studies showed that atRA and BMS453 increased total TGFbeta activity by 3-5-fold. However, BMS453 increased active TGFbeta activity by 33-fold while atRA increased active TGFbeta activity by only threefold. These results suggest that BMS453 treatment induces conversion of latent TGFbeta to active TGFbeta. To investigate whether this increase in active TGFbeta mediates the anti-proliferative effects of these retinoids, a TGFbeta-blocking antibody was used in an attempt to prevent retinoid-induced growth inhibition. Results from these experiments showed that the anti-TGFbeta antibody prevented the inhibition of cell proliferation induced by BMS453, but did not prevent the inhibition of cell proliferation induced by atRA. These results demonstrate that BMS453 inhibits breast cell growth predominantly through the induction of active TGFbeta, while atRA inhibits growth through other mechanisms. These results suggest that retinoid analogs that increase active TGFbeta may be promising agents for the prevention of breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2323284589,"With the aim to identify the oncoprotein partners implicated in the c-Jun myogenic influence, we carried out stable transfection experiments of c-Jun and/or ATF2, Fra2, c-Fos overexpression in avian myoblasts. Before induction of differentiation, c-Jun repressed myoblast withdrawal from the cell cycle, as did a TPA treatment. However, after serum removal, unlike TPA, c-Jun significantly stimulated myoblast differentiation. In search for specific partners involved in this dual influence, we found that a reduction in the amounts of c-Fos and Fra2 and an increase in c-Jun proteins occurred at cell confluence, a situation likely to favor cooperation between c-Jun and ATF2 during terminal differentiation. Whereas c-Fos and Fra2 cooperated with c-Jun to abrogate myoblast withdrawal from the cell cycle and terminal differentiation, ATF2 co-expression potentiated the positive myogenic c-Jun influence. In addition, myogenin expression was a positive target of this cooperation and this regulation occurred through a stimulation of myogenin promoter activity: (1) whereas c-Fos or Fra2 co-expression abrogated c-Jun stimulatory activity on this promoter, ATF2 co-expression potentiated this influence; (2) using a dominant negative ATF2 mutant, we established that c-Jun transcriptional activity required functionality of endogenous ATF2. These data suggest that through this dual myogenic influence due to cooperations with different partners, c-Jun is involved in the control of duration of myoblast proliferation and thereafter of fusion efficiency."

There are two isoforms of PKA that are distinguished by two types of R subunit, RI and RII. Evidence suggests that RI is associated with proliferation and RII is associated with cell differentiation. Previous work in this laboratory has demonstrated that depletion of the RIalpha subunit by treatment with an antisense oligonucleotide (ODN) induces differentiation in leukemia cells and growth arrest and apoptosis in epithelial cancer cells. Using the prostate cancer cell line PC3M as a model system, we have developed a cell line that overexpresses a retroviral vector construct containing the RIalpha antisense gene. This cell line has been characterized and the effectiveness of the construct determined. In the work presented here, we demonstrate by immunocytochemistry that treatment with RIalpha antisense ODN induces translocation of the Calpha subunit of PKA to the nucleus of PC3M prostate cancer cells. The translocation of Calpha triggered by exogenous antisense ODN treatment mirrors that observed in cells endogenously overexpressing the antisense gene. Triggering the nuclear translocation of the Calpha subunit of PKA in the cell may be an important mechanism of action of RIalpha antisense that regulates cell growth independent of adenylate cyclase and cellular cAMP levels. The nuclear localization of the Calpha subunit of PKA may be an essential step in revealing the mechanism whereby this critical kinase regulates cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W2026291489,"The most common malignant germ cell tumor of early childhood is the endodermal sinus tumor (CEST), also known as yolk sac tumor. Previous cytogenetic studies of CEST have demonstrated recurrent deletion of distal regions of chromosomes 1p and 6q. Studies utilizing comparative genomic hybridization have likewise demonstrated loss of distal 6q, however these studies show discrepant data concerning chromosome 1 abnormalities. This study analyses 18 CESTs for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of distal chromosome 6q utilizing 17 microsatellite markers and 13 tumors were analysed for LOH of distal 1p using two microsatellite markers. LOH of 6q was found in 13/18 tumors (72 %). This data confirms that loss of genetic material on 6q is one of the most common abnormalities in CESTs and narrows the region of loss, enabling candidate tumor suppressor genes to be identified and analysed. In addition, LOH of 1p36 was identified in five of 11 informative tumors, clarifying prior conflicting data and confirming that 1p deletion is a common event in CESTs."
