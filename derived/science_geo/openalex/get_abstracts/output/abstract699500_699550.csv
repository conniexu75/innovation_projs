https://openalex.org/W4293247374,"Embryonic stem (ES) cells can undergo many aspects of mammalian embryogenesis in vitro1-5, but their developmental potential is substantially extended by interactions with extraembryonic stem cells, including trophoblast stem (TS) cells, extraembryonic endoderm stem (XEN) cells and inducible XEN (iXEN) cells6-11. Here we assembled stem cell-derived embryos in vitro from mouse ES cells, TS cells and iXEN cells and showed that they recapitulate the development of whole natural mouse embryo in utero up to day 8.5 post-fertilization. Our embryo model displays headfolds with defined forebrain and midbrain regions and develops a beating heart-like structure, a trunk comprising a neural tube and somites, a tail bud containing neuromesodermal progenitors, a gut tube, and primordial germ cells. This complete embryo model develops within an extraembryonic yolk sac that initiates blood island development. Notably, we demonstrate that the neurulating embryo model assembled from Pax6-knockout ES cells aggregated with wild-type TS cells and iXEN cells recapitulates the ventral domain expansion of the neural tube that occurs in natural, ubiquitous Pax6-knockout embryos. Thus, these complete embryoids are a powerful in vitro model for dissecting the roles of diverse cell lineages and genes in development. Our results demonstrate the self-organization ability of ES cells and two types of extraembryonic stem cells to reconstitute mammalian development through and beyond gastrulation to neurulation and early organogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W4293237625,"Abstract First-line cemiplimab (anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)) monotherapy has previously shown significant improvement in overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) versus chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC) and PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression ≥50%. EMPOWER-Lung 3 ( NCT03409614 ), a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study, examined cemiplimab plus platinum-doublet chemotherapy as first-line treatment for aNSCLC, irrespective of PD-L1 expression or histology. In this study, 466 patients with stage III/IV aNSCLC without EGFR , ALK or ROS1 genomic tumor aberrations were randomized (2:1) to receive cemiplimab 350 mg ( n = 312) or placebo ( n = 154) every 3 weeks for up to 108 weeks in combination with four cycles of platinum-doublet chemotherapy (followed by pemetrexed maintenance as indicated). In total, 57.1% (266/466 patients) had non-squamous NSCLC, and 85.2% (397/466 patients) had stage IV disease. The primary endpoint was OS. The trial was stopped early per recommendation of the independent data monitoring committee, based on meeting preset OS efficacy criteria: median OS was 21.9 months (95% confidence interval (CI), 15.5–not evaluable) with cemiplimab plus chemotherapy versus 13.0 months (95% CI, 11.9–16.1) with placebo plus chemotherapy (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.71; 95% CI, 0.53–0.93; P = 0.014). Grade ≥3 adverse events occurred with cemiplimab plus chemotherapy (43.6%, 136/312 patients) and placebo plus chemotherapy (31.4%, 48/153 patients). Cemiplimab is only the second anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agent to show efficacy in aNSCLC as both monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy for both squamous and non-squamous histologies."
https://openalex.org/W4293237445,"Enhancing CRISPR-mediated site-specific transgene insertion efficiency by homology-directed repair (HDR) using high concentrations of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) with Cas9 target sequences (CTSs) can be toxic to primary cells. Here, we develop single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) HDR templates (HDRTs) incorporating CTSs with reduced toxicity that boost knock-in efficiency and yield by an average of around two- to threefold relative to dsDNA CTSs. Using small-molecule combinations that enhance HDR, we could further increase knock-in efficiencies by an additional roughly two- to threefold on average. Our method works across a variety of target loci, knock-in constructs and primary human cell types, reaching HDR efficiencies of >80–90%. We demonstrate application of this approach for both pathogenic gene variant modeling and gene-replacement strategies for IL2RA and CTLA4 mutations associated with Mendelian disorders. Finally, we develop a good manufacturing practice (GMP)-compatible process for nonviral chimeric antigen receptor-T cell manufacturing, with knock-in efficiencies (46–62%) and yields (>1.5 × 109 modified cells) exceeding those of conventional approaches. Combinations of single-stranded DNA repair templates and small molecules markedly enhance genome editing."
https://openalex.org/W4293242954,"Quantum state engineering, the cornerstone of quantum photonic technologies, mainly relies on spontaneous parametric down-conversion and four-wave mixing, where one or two pump photons decay into a photon pair. Both these nonlinear effects require momentum conservation (i.e., phase-matching) for the participating photons, which strongly limits the versatility of the resulting quantum states. Nonlinear metasurfaces, due to their subwavelength thickness, relax this constraint and extend the boundaries of quantum state engineering. Here, we generate entangled photons via spontaneous parametric down-conversion in semiconductor metasurfaces with high-quality resonances. By enhancing the quantum vacuum field, our metasurfaces boost the emission of photon pairs within narrow resonance bands at multiple selected wavelengths. Due to the relaxed momentum conservation, the same resonances support photon pair generation from pump photons of practically any energy. This enables the generation of complex frequency-multiplexed quantum states, in particular cluster states. Our results demonstrate the multifunctional use of metasurfaces for quantum state engineering."
https://openalex.org/W4293242914,"The CRISPR-Cas type III-E RNA-targeting effector complex gRAMP/Cas7-11 is associated with a caspase-like protein (TPR-CHAT/Csx29) to form Craspase (CRISPR-guided caspase). Here, we use cryo–electron microscopy snapshots of Craspase to explain its target RNA cleavage and protease activation mechanisms. Target-guide pairing extending into the 5′ region of the guide RNA displaces a gating loop in gRAMP, which triggers an extensive conformational relay that allosterically aligns the protease catalytic dyad and opens an amino acid side-chain–binding pocket. We further define Csx30 as the endogenous protein substrate that is site-specifically proteolyzed by RNA-activated Craspase. This protease activity is switched off by target RNA cleavage by gRAMP and is not activated by RNA targets containing a matching protospacer flanking sequence. We thus conclude that Craspase is a target RNA–activated protease with self-regulatory capacity."

We investigated the petrology of olivine and carbonate-bearing rocks of the Séítah formation in the floor of Jezero. Using multispectral images and x-ray fluorescence data, acquired by the Perseverance rover, we performed a petrographic analysis of the Bastide and Brac outcrops within this unit. We found that these outcrops are composed of igneous rock, moderately altered by aqueous fluid. The igneous rocks are mainly made of coarse-grained olivine, similar to some martian meteorites. We interpret them as an olivine cumulate, formed by settling and enrichment of olivine through multistage cooling of a thick magma body."
https://openalex.org/W4293243158,"One of the key insights in the emerging field of non-Hermitian photonics is that well-established concepts like the laser can be operated in reverse to realize a 'coherent perfect absorber' (CPA). While conceptually appealing, such CPAs are limited so far to a single, judiciously shaped wavefront or 'mode'. Here, we demonstrate how this limitation can be overcome by time-reversing a 'degenerate cavity laser', based on a unique cavity that self-images any incident light-field onto itself. Placing a weak, critically-coupled absorber into this cavity, we demonstrate that any incoming wavefront, even a complex and dynamically-varying speckle pattern, is absorbed with close to perfect efficiency in a massively parallel interference process. Moreover, the coherent nature of multi-mode absorption allows us to tune the degree of absorption over a wide range. These characteristics open-up interesting new possibilities for applications in light-harvesting, energy delivery, light control, and imaging."
https://openalex.org/W4292684577,"Virtually all age-related neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) can be characterized by the accumulation of proteins inside and outside the cell that are thought to significantly contribute to disease pathogenesis. One of the cell's primary systems for the degradation of misfolded/damaged proteins is the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS), and its impairment is implicated in essentially all NDs. Thus, upregulating this system to combat NDs has garnered a great deal of interest in recent years. Various animal models have focused on stimulating 26S activity and increasing 20S proteasome levels, but thus far, none have targeted intrinsic activation of the 20S proteasome itself. Therefore, we constructed an animal model that endogenously expresses a hyperactive, open gate proteasome in Caenorhabditis elegans. The gate-destabilizing mutation that we introduced into the nematode germline yielded a viable nematode population with enhanced proteasomal activity, including peptide, unstructured protein, and ubiquitin-dependent degradation activities. We determined these nematodes showed a significantly increased lifespan and substantial resistance to oxidative and proteotoxic stress but a significant decrease in fecundity. Our results show that introducing a constitutively active proteasome into a multicellular organism is feasible and suggests targeting the proteasome gating mechanism as a valid approach for future age-related disease research efforts in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W4293215758,"Excitatory synapses are formed and matured by the cooperative actions of synaptic organizers, such as neurexins (Nrxns), neuroligins (Nlgns), LRRTMs, and Cbln1. Recent super-resolution nanoscopy developments have revealed that many synaptic organizers, as well as glutamate receptors and glutamate release machinery, exist as nanoclusters within synapses. However, it is unclear how such nanodomains interact with each other to organize excitatory synapses in vivo. By applying X10 expansion microscopy to epitope tag knockin mice, we found that Cbln1, Nlgn1, and LRRTM1, which share Nrxn as a common presynaptic receptor, form overlapping or separate nanodomains depending on Nrxn with or without a sequence encoded by splice site 4. The size and position of glutamate receptor nanodomains of GluD1, NMDA, and AMPA receptors were regulated by Cbln1, Nlgn1, and LRRTM1 nanodomains, respectively. These findings indicate that Nrxns anterogradely regulate the postsynaptic nanoscopic architecture of glutamate receptors through competition and coordination of Nrxn ligands."
https://openalex.org/W4293237483,"Abstract Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods that quantitatively probe motions on molecular and atomic levels have propelled the understanding of biomolecular processes for which static structures cannot provide a satisfactory description. In this work, we studied the structure and dynamics of the essential 100-kDa eukaryotic 5′→3′ exoribonuclease Xrn2. A combination of complementary fluorine and methyl-TROSY NMR spectroscopy reveals that the apo enzyme is highly dynamic around the catalytic center. These observed dynamics are in agreement with a transition of the enzyme from the ground state into a catalytically competent state. We show that the conformational equilibrium in Xrn2 shifts substantially toward the active state in the presence of substrate and magnesium. Finally, our data reveal that the dynamics in Xrn2 correlate with the RNA degradation rate, as a mutation that attenuates motions also affects catalytic activity. In that light, our results stress the importance of studies that go beyond static structural information."
https://openalex.org/W4292821561,"Sphingomyelin (SM) is an abundant plasma membrane and plasma lipoprotein sphingolipid. We previously reported that ATP-binding cassette family A protein 1 (ABCA1) deficiency in humans and mice decreases plasma SM levels. However, overexpression, induction, downregulation, inhibition, and knockdown of ABCA1 in human hepatoma Huh7 cells did not decrease SM efflux. Using unbiased siRNA screening, here, we identified that ABCA7 plays a role in the biosynthesis and efflux of SM without affecting cellular uptake and metabolism. Since loss of function mutations in the ABCA7 gene exhibit strong associations with late-onset Alzheimer’s disease across racial groups, we also studied the effects of ABCA7 deficiency in the mouse brain. Brains of ABCA7-deficient (KO) mice, compared with WT, had significantly lower levels of several SM species with long chain fatty acids. In addition, we observed that older KO mice exhibited behavioral deficits in cognitive discrimination in the active place avoidance task. Next, we performed synaptic transmission studies in brain slices obtained from older mice. We found anomalies in synaptic plasticity at the intracortical synapse in layer II/III of the lateral entorhinal cortex but not in the hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses in KO mice. These synaptic abnormalities in KO brain slices were rescued with extracellular SM supplementation but not by supplementation with phosphatidylcholine. Taken together, these studies identify a role of ABCA7 in brain SM metabolism and the importance of SM in synaptic plasticity and cognition, as well as provide a possible explanation for the association between ABCA7 and late-onset Alzheimer’s disease.

Sphingolipids are biologically active lipids involved in several biological processes (1Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Principles of bioactive lipid signalling: lessons from sphingolipids.Nat. Rev. Mol.

Invest. 2011; 121: 4222-4230Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Sphingomyelin (SM), a major sphingolipid, is abundant in the outer leaflet of cell membranes where it forms lipid rafts with cholesterol. Additionally, SM is the most abundant sphingolipid in plasma lipoproteins (3Hammad S.M. Blood sphingolipids in homeostasis and pathobiology.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2011; 721: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We previously showed that microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) and ATP-binding cassette transporter family A protein 1 (ABCA1) play important roles in determining plasma concentrations of SM (4Iqbal J.

It is known that MTP transfers lipids in vitro between vesicles and possibly to apoB in vivo to assist in lipoprotein assembly and secretion (6Hussain M.M. Shi J. Dreizen P.

We showed that MTP transfers SM in vitro and suggested that it might also do so in cells and facilitate secretion of SM with lipoproteins to explain significant reductions in plasma SM levels in MTP-deficient humans and mice (4Iqbal J. Walsh M.T. Hammad S.M. Cuchel M. Tarugi P. Hegele R.A. et al.Microsomal triglycerdie transfer protein transfers and determines plasma concentrations of ceramide and sphingomyelin but not glycosylceramide.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 25863-25875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). ABCA1 is involved in the efflux of phospholipids and cholesterol to high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) and its deficiency in humans and mice is associated with low levels of plasma HDL. Although chronic deficiency of ABCA1 significantly reduced plasma SM levels in humans and mice, acute knockdown or inhibition had no effect on SM efflux from human hepatoma cells (5Iqbal J. Walsh M.T. Hammad S.M. Cuchel M. Rader D.J. Hussain M.M. ATP binding cassette family A protein 1 determines hexosylceramide and sphingomyelin levels in human and mouse plasma.J. Lipid Res. 2018; 59: 2084-2097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Therefore, we surmised that ABCA1 plays a role in the biogenesis of HDL, and HDL is involved in the efflux of SM from cells involving an unexplained mechanism. Here, using an unbiased siRNA-mediated knockdown (KD) approach, we identified that ABCA7 plays a role in the biosynthesis and efflux of SM. Since ABCA7 gene has been associated with late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) (8Reitz C. Jun G. Naj A. Rajbhandary R. Vardarajan B.N. Wang L.S. et al.Variants in the ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABCA7), apolipoprotein E ε4,and the risk of late-onset Alzheimer disease in African Americans.JAMA. 2013; 309: 1483-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), we addressed the role of ABCA7 in the brain. We observed that ABCA7 knockout (Abca7−/−) mice have reduced levels of certain species of SM in the brain and that ABCA7 deficiency affects cognitive discrimination and synaptic plasticity in brain slices which can be mitigated by supplementation of SM. We previously reported that ATP-binding cassette family A protein 1 (ABCA1) deficiency in humans and mice decreases plasma SM levels (5Iqbal J. Walsh M.T. Hammad S.M. Cuchel M. Rader D.J. Hussain M.M. ATP binding cassette family A protein 1 determines hexosylceramide and sphingomyelin levels in human and mouse plasma.J. Lipid Res. 2018; 59: 2084-2097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, overexpression, induction, downregulation, inhibition, and KD of ABCA1, a well-characterized cholesterol and phospholipid transporter, in human hepatoma Huh7 cells does not decrease SM efflux to HDL (5Iqbal J. Walsh M.T. Hammad S.M. Cuchel M. Rader D.J. Hussain M.M. ATP binding cassette family A protein 1 determines hexosylceramide and sphingomyelin levels in human and mouse plasma.J. Lipid Res. 2018; 59: 2084-2097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that ABCA1 is not directly involved in the SM efflux to HDL but contributes to plasma SM levels by playing a role in the biogenesis of HDL. To identify the SM transporter, we individually knocked down 48 members of the ABC transporter family by using an siRNA library in Huh7 cells, which were treated with C6-NBD ceramide (Cer). Ceramide is taken up by cells and is converted to sphingomyelin (SM) and glucosylceramide (GluCer). After labeling, cells were incubated with bovine serum albumin (BSA) to quantify basal efflux (siCTRL-BSA) or efflux to HDL (siCTRL-HDL) (Fig. 1). Compared with BSA, HDL significantly increased SM efflux (Fig. 1, A and B), in agreement with findings from our earlier studies (5Iqbal J. Walsh M.T. Hammad S.M. Cuchel M. Rader D.J. Hussain M.M. ATP binding cassette family A protein 1 determines hexosylceramide and sphingomyelin levels in human and mouse plasma.J. Lipid Res. 2018; 59: 2084-2097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), thus confirming that HDL enhances SM efflux. KD of different genes either increased or decreased SM efflux to HDL (Fig. 1, A and B). Of interest was one protein, ABCA7, whose KD significantly decreased SM efflux to HDL (Fig. 1, A and B). We validated these results by performing a second screening. In agreement with the results of our first screening, incubation of siCTRL-treated cells with HDL resulted in significantly greater SM efflux than that with siCTRL-BSA, and this enhanced efflux significantly decreased after KD of ABCA7 (Fig. 1C). These results suggested that ABCA7 might be involved in the efflux of SM to HDL. In previous studies, we showed that MTP and ABCA1 deficiencies have no effect on SM synthesis; however, they were involved in secretion and efflux, respectively (4Iqbal J. Walsh M.T. Hammad S.M. Cuchel M. Tarugi P. Hegele R.A. et al.Microsomal triglycerdie transfer protein transfers and determines plasma concentrations of ceramide and sphingomyelin but not glycosylceramide.J. Biol.

Lipid Res. 2018; 59: 2084-2097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that ABCA7 would not affect SM synthesis but would decrease efflux. To test this hypothesis, we transfected Huh7 cells with siABCA7 to knockdown (KD) ABCA7 by more than 80% compared to siCTRL-treated cells (Fig. 2, A–C). These cells were then incubated with C6-NBD Cer for 10 to 60 min. Measurement of intracellular sphingolipids revealed that cellular Cer levels increased with time, thus indicating time-dependent uptake (Fig. 2D). At the earliest time point studied, NBD-Cer had already been converted to GluCer, and the levels remained similar over 1 h in both siCTRL- and siABCA7-treated cells. In contrast, conversion of Cer to SM increased with time in both siCTRL- and siABCA7-treated cells. However, unexpectedly, these time-dependent increases were significantly lower in ABCA7 KD cells, thereby leading to lower intracellular SM levels than those in siCTRL-treated cells (Fig. 2D). These studies suggest that ABCA7 is involved in SM synthesis but not in the synthesis of GluCer. We considered the possibility that decreased synthesis of SM might have been an artifact due to the use of NBD-labeled C6-Cer as a precursor for SM synthesis. Therefore, we labeled siCTRL- or siABCA7-treated Huh7 cells with C16-[14C]-Cer and measured labeled sphingolipids in the media and cells. For an additional control, we performed KD of ABCA1, whose deficiency decreases plasma SM levels in mice and humans (5Iqbal J. Walsh M.T. Hammad S.M. Cuchel M. Rader D.J. Hussain M.M. ATP binding cassette family A protein 1 determines hexosylceramide and sphingomyelin levels in human and mouse plasma.J. Lipid Res. 2018; 59: 2084-2097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). First, we quantified the efflux of [14C]-sphingolipids to BSA and HDL in the media (Fig. 2E). We observed significantly greater levels of Cer, GluCer, and SM in the media of siCTRL-HDL– than siCTRL-BSA–treated cells. SiABCA1 had no significant effect on the efflux of Cer, GluCer, and SM to HDL. We did not observe any difference in the efflux of Cer to HDL between siABCA7-treated cells and siCTRL-HDL–treated cells. However, we observed significantly greater efflux of GluCer and significantly less efflux of SM to HDL in siABCA7-HDL than in siCTRL-HDL–treated cells. These studies indicated that siABCA7 significantly decreases [14C]-SM efflux to HDL. Next, we measured sphingolipids in cells (Fig. 2F). SiABCA1 and siABCA7, compared with siCTRL-HDL, had no significant effect on cellular Cer and GluCer levels. In contrast, siABCA7-treated cells had significantly lower levels of radiolabeled SM than siCTRL- and siABCA1-treated cells, thus indicating decreased synthesis. To determine whether ABCA7 might play a role in both synthesis and efflux or whether decreased efflux might be secondary to lower synthesis, we calculated the efflux as a percentage of the total SM level present in the cells and media (Table 1). SiABCA1 had no effect on Cer and SM efflux but increased GluCer efflux. In contrast, siABCA7 increased the efflux of Cer and GluCer but had no effect on SM efflux. Based on these calculations, we surmised that ABCA7 plays a role in SM synthesis, and decreased efflux is secondary to lower synthesis and lower cellular SM levels. Because of reduced SM synthesis in the absence of ABCA7, more Cer is likely to remain in cells, and conversion to GluCer is likely to be greater; therefore, these lipids should be available for efflux to HDL. Together, these studies indicate that KD of ABCA7 significantly decreases the conversion of [14C]-Cer to SM and the efflux of [14C]-SM to HDL.Table 1Efflux of different sphingolipids to HDL as a percentage of total lipidsCellular (AU)Media (AU)Total (AU)% Effluxp value[14C]-Ceramide CeramidesiCTRL-BSA7861 ± 8681447 ± 2149307 ± 78815.7 ± 2.9siCTRL-HDL8343 ± 9933791 ± 9812,134 ± 97831.4 ± 2.7siABCA1-HDL8312 ± 8423904 ± 12312,216 ± 90232.1 ± 2.1NSsiABCA7-HDL6504 ± 8074447 ± 35510,951 ± 73740.7 ± 4.2<0.05 GlucosylceramidesiCTRL-BSA5695 ± 297464 ± 1106123 ± 3477.6 ± 1.5siCTRL-HDL5601 ± 2881711 ± 3697312 ± 59923.2 ± 3.4siABCA1-HDL5553 ± 1313166 ± 8518719 ± 97835.9 ± 5.8<0.05siABCA7-HDL5779 ± 6003165 ± 1848945 ± 78435.4 ± 1.0<0.005 SphingomyelinsiCTRL-BSA5165 ± 3472008 ± 3337173 ± 67627.9 ± 2.1siCTRL-HDL4300 ± 2433674 ± 4097974 ± 35446.0 ± 3.6siABCA1-HDL4455 ± 3943878 ± 1108332 ± 48646.6 ± 1.7NSsiABCA7-HDL3326 ± 1842702 ± 2816028 ± 13444.8 ± 3.9NSData from Figure 2, B and C were used to calculate the percentage efflux with respect to total sphingolipid arbitrary units present in the media and cells at the end of the experiment.

The above studies showed that ABCA7 is involved in SM synthesis. We also considered several other possible roles of ABCA7 in SM synthesis. It has been shown that ceramide transfer protein 1 (CERT1) is important for SM synthesis (9Kumagai K. Hanada K. Structure, functions and regulation of CERT, a lipid-transfer protein for the delivery of ceramide at the ER-Golgi membrane contact sites.FEBS Lett. 2019; 593: 2366-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether CERT1 expression is altered in Abca7 deficiency and measured ABCA7 and CERT1 mRNA levels in the livers of WT and Abca7−/−-deficient (KO) mice. Compared to WT, KO livers had barely detectable ABCA7 mRNA levels confirming ABCA7 deficiency (Fig. S1). In contrast, ABCA7 deficiency had no effect on CERT1 mRNA levels. These studies showed that ABCA7 deficiency has no effect on CERT1 expression. Next, we studied the uptake of NBD-labeled SM by these cells (Fig. 3, A–D). Both WT and KO hepatocytes took up similar amounts of NBD-SM fluorescence (Fig. 3B). Moreover, both cells showed similar uptake of NBD-SM (Fig. 3, A and C). We observed that there was an increase in NBD-Cer in cells with time (Fig. 3A). The production of ceramide was similar in WT and KO hepatocytes (Fig. 3, A and D). These studies showed that hepatocytes take up NBD-SM and a small portion is hydrolyzed to ceramide. Both uptake of SM and conversion to ceramide were unaffected by ABCA7 deficiency. To investigate further the role of ABCA7 in the hydrolysis of SM, we first labeled WT and KO hepatocytes with NBD-SM. Next, we studied time-dependent conversion of NBD-SM to NBD-Cer (Fig. 4). Total disappearance of NBD-SM was similar in both hepatocytes (Fig. 4B). We observed similar decline in cellular NBD-SM with time (Fig. 4, A and C). Moreover, the production of NBD-Cer was similar in WT and KO hepatocytes (Fig. 4, A and D). We did not see rapid increase in NBD-Cer levels corresponding to loss of cellular NBD-SM. These studies suggested that NBD-SM is metabolized to other unknown metabolites. Nevertheless, these studies showed that degradation of NBD-SM in hepatocytes was unaffected by the absence of ABCA7. In short, these studies showed that mouse hepatocyte take up SM. A portion of it is converted to NBD-Cer probably due to sphingomyelinase activity. More importantly, we did not find any differences between WT and KO hepatocytes with respect to SM uptake and metabolism. Therefore, it is likely that ABCA7 does not play a major role in SM uptake and hydrolysis. ABCA7 protein contains two each of extracellular, transmembrane, and intracellular ABC domains (10Aikawa T. Holm M.L. Kanekiyo T. ABCA7 and pathogenic pathways of Alzheimer's disease.Brain Sci. 2018; 8: 27Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The ABC domains (Fig. 5A) are important for protein function (10Aikawa T. Holm M.L. Kanekiyo T. ABCA7 and pathogenic pathways of Alzheimer's disease.Brain Sci. 2018; 8: 27Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 11Kaminski W.E. Piehler A. Wenzel J.J. ABC A-subfamily transporters: structure, function and disease.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1762: 510-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). To address the roles of these domains in SM synthesis and efflux, we first transfected 293T cells with a control plasmid or a plasmid expressing FLAG-tagged mouse ABCA7 (Fig. 5B, top). Expression of ABCA7 resulted in significantly greater SM efflux than that observed in the control cells (Fig. 5B, bottom). Next, we expressed mouse WT ABCA7, R986H, and K2027Q missense mutations in cells (Fig. 5C, top). SM efflux was similar in cells expressing WT ABCA7 and the K2027Q missense mutant (Fig. 5C, bottom and right graph). However, SM efflux was significantly lower in cells expressing R986H than in WT cells (Fig. 5C, bottom and right graph). Next, we studied the effect of the R986H mutation on cellular SM levels and found that cells expressing R986H had lower levels of SM than WT cells (Fig. 5D). These studies showed that overexpression of ABCA7 increases SM synthesis and efflux. Expression of the R986H, but not the K2027Q, missense mutation decreased SM cellular levels and efflux, thus indicating that at least one of the ABC domain is important for cellular SM levels and efflux. We then studied the effect of overexpression of human ABCA7 and the R989H missense mutation orthologous to mouse R986H reported in a Belgian cohort (12Bossaerts L. Hendrickx Van de Craen E. Cacace R.

Overexpression of GFP-tagged ABCA7-R989H showed strong vesicular localization, similar to ABCA7-WT (Fig. 5E). In addition, similar cellular protein levels were detected with a mouse anti-GFP IgG antibody via immunoblotting (Fig. 5F). Next, we studied the effect of the human R989H mutant on intracellular and medium SM levels in cells incubated with HDL. R989H expressing cells, compared with WT ABCA7 expressing cells, had lower levels of SM in the media and in cells (Fig. 5G). These results indicated that the human ABCA7 missense mutant R989H is defective in SM synthesis and efflux in neuronal cells. KD, KO, overexpression, and mutagenesis studies in the cells described above identified ABCA7 as a protein involved in SM synthesis. Next, we extended these studies to mice and investigated the consequences of ABCA7 deficiency on the levels of different SM species in the plasma, liver, and brain. Several SM species were more abundant in the plasma of ABCA7-deficient (Abca7−/−, KO) mice than in WT controls (Fig. 6A). In contrast, we did not observe any significant change in the levels of these sphingolipids in the livers of KO mice (Fig. 6B). However, analysis of different species of SM revealed significantly lower levels of C22:1-, C22-, C24:1-, C24-, and C26:1-SM in the brains of KO mice than those in WT controls (Fig. 6C). These data suggest that ABCA7 may play a role in determining the levels of SM with longer fatty acid species in the brain. Given the association between ABCA7 mutations and LOAD (14Hollingworth P.

Young-adult (4–6 months old) WT and KO mice quickly learned to actively avoid the shock zone, as evidenced by decreases in the number of shocks that they received in different trials (Fig. 7B). Older KO (14–18 months old) mice also learned to avoid the shock zone (Fig. 7D, T1–T8). The values of these parameters were not significantly different to those of WT mice of the same age. These studies suggested that young and old KO mice do not show any visuospatial memory disabilities as assessed by APA, in agreement with the studies of Logge et al. (19Logge W. Cheng D. Chesworth R. Bhatia S. Garner B. Kim W.S. et al.Role of Abca7 in mouse behaviours relevant to neurodegenerative diseases.PLoS One. 2012; 7e45959Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), who did not observe a decline in cognitive function in young-adult mice. We then investigated cognitive discrimination by changing the location of the shock zone (APA conflict, Fig. 7A, TC1–TC4) (16Cimadevilla J.M. Kaminsky Y. Fenton A. Bures J. Passive and active place avoidance as a tool of spatial memory research in rats.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2000; 102: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 17Cimadevilla J.M. Wesierska M.

Persistent modifications of hippocampal synaptic function during remote spatial memory.Neurobiol. Learn. Mem. 2017; 138: 182-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Representative recordings of mouse paths and shocks received by a KO and a WT mouse are shown in Figure 7C. These recordings show that older WT mice quickly learned to avoid the conflict area and displayed a regular pattern of movement within the test arena. In contrast, older KO mice received more shocks and showed a random pattern of movement in the arena. Quantification revealed a transient increase in shocks in both young-adult WT and KO mice (Fig. 7, B and D; TC1, TC4), thus indicating that both WT and KO young-adult mice learned to ignore the initial location of the shock and acquired the information on the new location of the shock zone. With continued training, both the WT and KO young-adult mice rapidly learned to discriminate between the old and new shock locations (Fig. 7B, TC1–TC4). However, older KO mice received significantly more shocks in the first two trials of the third day, in contrast to older WT mice (Fig. 7D, TC1–TC2), but eventually learned to avoid the new shock zone (Fig. 7D, TC3–TC4). These studies showed that KO mice required more shocks to learn the new location of the shock zone. We interpret these studies to suggest that older KO mice have cognitive discrimination deficits. Since animals use visual cues to locate the shock zone in the APA task, we performed a visual Cliff test (20Fox M.W. The visual cliff test for the study of visual depth perception in the mouse.Anim. Behav. 1965; 13: 232-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) of visual depth perception on a group of KO (n = 10) and WT mice (n = 12), >12 months old, and observed no significant differences (ANOVA safe. 8.42 ± 0.36 trials versus 9.33 ± 0.35; F = 1.59, p = 0.11). We also did not find differences in distance traveled, the number of shocks per entrance, or between males and females (Fig. S2). These studies suggest that the differences between KO and WT mice seen in APA conflict were not due to major visual abnormalities, locomotor problems, or differences in the sensitivity to the shocks. Subsequently, we attempted to address reasons for cognitive decline in older ABCA7 KO mice. To test whether the KO mice had abnormalities in synaptic transmission, we evaluated the long-term potentiation (LTP) form of synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapse (Fig. 8A). No significant differences were observed 40 min after LTP induction in the CA3-CA1 synapse between WT and KO slices (Fig. 8B). Because CA3-CA1 LTP has been proposed to be required for hippocampus-dependent memory storage (18Pavlowsky A. Wallace E. Fenton A.A. Alarcon J.M. Persistent modifications of hippocampal synaptic function during remote spatial memory.Neurobiol. Learn. Mem. 2017; 138: 182-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), these results are consistent with the behavioral data (Fig. 7B). Next, we evaluated the LTP in the intracortical synapse in layer II/III of the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC). No significant differences were observed in the input-output relationships or basal paired-pulse ratio (PPR) (Fig. 8C). We found that both, post-tetanic potentiation (PTP) and LTP were significantly lower in KO mice (Fig. 8D; PTP = 141.8%; LTP = 117.9% 40 min after high frequency stimulation (HFS)) as compared with WT mice (PTP = 208.1% p ≤ 0.0001; LTP = 157.1% p ≤ 0.0001). These studies suggest that the electrophysiological differences observed in the entorhinal cortex maybe due to impaired synaptic plasticity in this region rather than differences in basal synaptic transmission. Next, we assessed whether the LTP deficiency in ABCA7 KO mice was different between female and male mice. We did not find significant differences in input/output relationships in male and female mice (Fig. 8E). Interestingly, we found that female KO mice have significantly lower LTP values (F1,10 = 9.765, p = 0.0108) (Fig. 8F); however, Sidak’s post hoc analysis"

The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of virulence genes, biofilm formation, motor capacities and antimicrobial resistance profile of V. parahaemolyticus isolates isolated from clinical samples in Nantong during 2018-2020. Sixty-six V. parahaemolyticus strains isolated from stool specimens of diarrheal patients were examined. The PCR results showed that there were two tdh+trh+ isolates, four tdh-trh- isolates and sixty tdh+trh- isolates, accounting for 3.0%, 6.1% and 90.9%, respectively. All the tdh carrying isolates manifested the positive reactions for the Kanagawa phenomenon (KP) test. Most of the isolates harbored at least one of the specific DNA markers of 'pandemic group' strains, suggesting that the dominant isolates of V. parahaemolyticus in Nantong might belong to the new O3: K6 or its serovariants. All tdh+ isolates possessed the Vp-PAI genes, but no tdh-trh- isolates carried the T3SS2 genes. All isolates were biofilm producers and had relatively strong motor capacities. In addition, the V. parahaemolyticus isolates were resistant to ampicillin (98.5%), cefuroxime (75.6%), cefepime (66.7%), piperacillin (59.1%) and ampicillin/sulbactam (50.0%), but sensitive to ciprofloxacin (100.0%), levofloxacin (100.0%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (98.5%), gentamicin (98.5%), amikacin (97%), meropenem (71.2%), and ceftazidime (56.1%).

https://openalex.org/W4292622421,"Legionella pneumophila, a bacterial pathogen that causes a severe pneumonia known as Legionnaires' disease, extensively exploits the ubiquitin (Ub) pathway in the infected host cells through certain virulence effectors excreted by the Dot/Icm system. To date, several Dot/Icm effectors have been found to act as Ub ligases, and four effectors, including LotA, LotB, LotC, and Ceg7, have been identified as deubiquitinases (DUBs) from the ovarian tumor (OTU) domain family. LotA is unique among other OTU DUBs because it possesses two distinct DUB domains and exclusively exhibits catalytic activity against K6-linked diUb and polyUb chains. However, the structure of LotA and the molecular mechanism for the dual DUB activity remains elusive. In this study, we solved the structure of LotA in complex with proximally bound Ub and distal covalently bound Ub. Both Ub molecules are bound to the DUB1 domain and mimic a K6-linked diUb. Structural analysis reveals that the DUB1 domain utilizes a distinct mechanism for recognition of the K6-linked diUb within a large S1' binding site that is uncommon to OTU DUBs. Structural fold of the LotA DUB2 domain closely resembles LotB and LotC, similarly containing an extra α-helix lobe that has been demonstrated to play an important role in Ub binding. Collectively, our study uncovers the structural basis for the dual catalytic activity of the unique OTU family DUB LotA."
https://openalex.org/W4293036731,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second-most common malignant disease worldwide, and metastasis is the main culprit of CRC-related death. Metachronous metastases remain to be an unpredictable, unpreventable, and fatal complication, and tracing the molecular chain of events that lead to metastasis would provide mechanistically linked biomarkers for the maintenance of remission in CRC patients after curative treatment. We hypothesized, that Metastasis-associated in colorectal cancer-1 (MACC1) induces a secretory phenotype to enforce metastasis in a paracrine manner, and found, that the cell-free culture medium of MACC1-expressing CRC cells induces migration. Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture mass spectrometry (SILAC-MS) of the medium revealed, that S100A4 is significantly enriched in the MACC1-specific secretome. Remarkably, both biomarkers correlate in expression data of independent cohorts as well as within CRC tumor sections. Furthermore, combined elevated transcript levels of the metastasis genes MACC1 and S100A4 in primary tumors and in blood plasma robustly identifies CRC patients at high risk for poor metastasis-free (MFS) and overall survival (OS). Mechanistically, MACC1 strengthens the interaction of β-catenin with TCF4, thus inducing S100A4 synthesis transcriptionally, resulting in elevated secretion to enforce cell motility and metastasis. In cell motility assays, S100A4 was indispensable for MACC1-induced migration, as shown via knock-out and pharmacological inhibition of S100A4. The direct transcriptional and functional relationship of MACC1 and S100A4 was probed by combined targeting with repositioned drugs. In fact, the MACC1-β-catenin-S100A4 axis by statins (MACC1) and niclosamide (S100A4) synergized in inhibiting cancer cell motility in vitro and metastasis in vivo. The MACC1-β-catenin-S100A4 signaling axis is causal for CRC metastasis. Selectively repositioned drugs synergize in restricting MACC1/S100A4-driven metastasis with cross-entity potential."

A total of 552 alleles were obtained and allele number varied from 2-6 with an average number of 3.17 alleles per SSR marker. The major allele frequency ranged from 0.29 (ENA23) to 0.92 (BrgMS841) with an average value of 0.58 per SSR locus. The polymorphic information content (PIC) value ranged from 0.10 (BrgMS841) to 0.68 (BrgMS519) with 0.39 as mean PIC value.

The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to assess LL-37 levels. Data analysis was performed using STATA software and Graph pad Prism version 8. Mann-Whitney U test was used for correlation between variables with two categories and the Kruskal-Wallis test for three or more categories.The study had more female participants than males, with similar median ages across the three groups, 29.5, 25.0, and 23.0 years respectively. Active tuberculosis patients had significantly higher LL-37 levels compared to those with latent tuberculosis and without tuberculosis. The median/interquartile ranges were 318.8 ng/ml (157.9-547.1), 242.2 ng/ml (136.2-579.3), 170.9 ng/ml (129.3-228.3); p = 0.002 respectively. Higher LL-37 was found in the male participant with median/interquartile range, 424.8 ng/ml (226.2-666.8) compared to the females 237.7 ng/ml (129.6-466.6); p = 0.045.

https://openalex.org/W3208325286,"The exponential family random graph modeling (ERGM) framework provides a highly flexible approach for the statistical analysis of networks (i.e., graphs). As ERGMs with dyadic dependence involve normalizing factors that are extremely costly to compute, practical strategies for ERGMs inference generally employ a variety of approximations or other workarounds. Markov Chain Monte Carlo maximum likelihood (MCMC MLE) provides a powerful tool to approximate the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of ERGM parameters, and is generally feasible for typical models on single networks with as many as a few thousand nodes. MCMC-based algorithms for Bayesian analysis are more expensive, and high-quality answers are challenging to obtain on large graphs. For both strategies, extension to the pooled case-in which we observe multiple networks from a common generative process-adds further computational cost, with both time and memory scaling linearly in the number of graphs. This becomes prohibitive for large networks, or cases in which large numbers of graph observations are available. Here, we exploit some basic properties of the discrete exponential families to develop an approach for ERGM inference in the pooled case that (where applicable) allows an arbitrarily large number of graph observations to be fit at no additional computational cost beyond preprocessing the data itself. Moreover, a variant of our approach can also be used to perform Bayesian inference under conjugate priors, again with no additional computational cost in the estimation phase. The latter can be employed either for single graph observations, or for observations from graph sets. As we show, the conjugate prior is easily specified, and is well-suited to applications such as regularization. Simulation studies show that the pooled method leads to estimates with good frequentist properties, and posterior estimates under the conjugate prior are well-behaved. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach with applications to pooled analysis of brain functional connectivity networks and to replicated x-ray crystal structures of hen egg-white lysozyme."
https://openalex.org/W4292622229,"The general secretory, or Sec, system is a primary protein export pathway from the cytosol of Escherichia coli and all eubacteria. Integral membrane protein complex SecDF is a translocation factor that enhances polypeptide secretion, which is driven by the Sec translocase, consisting of translocon SecYEG and ATPase SecA. SecDF is thought to utilize a proton gradient to effectively pull precursor proteins from the cytoplasm into the periplasm. Working models have been developed to describe the structure and function of SecDF, but important mechanistic questions remain unanswered. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a powerful technique for studying the dynamics of single-molecule systems including membrane proteins in near-native conditions. The sharp tip of the AFM provides direct access to membrane-external protein conformations. Here, we acquired AFM images and kymographs (∼100 ms resolution) to visualize SecDF protrusions in near-native supported lipid bilayers and compared the experimental data to simulated AFM images based on static structures. When studied in isolation, SecDF exhibited a stable and compact conformation close to the lipid bilayer surface, indicative of a resting state. Interestingly, upon SecYEG introduction, we observed changes in both SecDF conformation and conformational dynamics. The population of periplasmic protrusions corresponding to an intermediate form of SecDF, which is thought to be active in precursor protein handling, increased more than ninefold. In conjunction, our dynamics measurements revealed an enhancement in the transition rate between distinct SecDF conformations when the translocon was present. Together, this work provides a novel vista of basal-level SecDF conformational dynamics in near-native conditions."

The as-prepared Au 0.3 -BiOBr nanosheets exhibited an excellent electrochemical performance. The charge separation efficiency of Au 0.3 -BiOBr nanosheets was enhanced by 18.5 times compared with that of BiOBr. The intrinsic photocatalytic activity of Au 0.3 -BiOBr nanosheets in the degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride was approximately twice higher than that of BiOBr under visible light irradiation. In addition, three pathways were identified for the photocatalytic degradation and mineralization of tetracycline hydrochloride, which involve four reactions: hydroxylation, demethylation, ring opening and mineralization.

https://openalex.org/W4292622553,"NAD+ is a cellular redox cofactor involved in many essential processes. The regulation of NAD+ metabolism and the signaling networks reciprocally interacting with NAD+-producing metabolic pathways are not yet fully understood. The NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase (HDAC) Hst1 has been shown to inhibit de novo NAD+ synthesis by repressing biosynthesis of nicotinic acid (BNA) gene expression. Here, we alternatively identify HDAC Rpd3 as a positive regulator of de novo NAD+ metabolism in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We reveal that deletion of RPD3 causes marked decreases in the production of de novo pathway metabolites, in direct contrast to deletion of HST1. We determined the BNA expression profiles of rpd3Δ and hst1Δ cells to be similarly opposed, suggesting the two HDACs may regulate the BNA genes in an antagonistic fashion. Our chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that Rpd3 and Hst1 mutually influence each other's binding distribution at the BNA2 promoter. We demonstrate Hst1 to be the main deacetylase active at the BNA2 promoter, with hst1Δ cells displaying increased acetylation of the N-terminal tail lysine residues of histone H4, H4K5, and H4K12. Conversely, we show that deletion of RPD3 reduces the acetylation of these residues in an Hst1-dependent manner. This suggests that Rpd3 may function to oppose spreading of Hst1-dependent heterochromatin and represents a unique form of antagonism between HDACs in regulating gene expression. Moreover, we found that Rpd3 and Hst1 also coregulate additional targets involved in other branches of NAD+ metabolism. These findings help elucidate the complex interconnections involved in effecting the regulation of NAD+ metabolism."

Using a high-throughput imaging-based reporter drug screen with 9 501 compounds, we have identified three polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) inhibitors as major inducers of ERα protein expression and downstream activity in TNBC cells. PLK1 inhibition upregulates a cell differentiation program characterized by increased DNA damage, mitotic arrest, and ultimately cell death. Furthermore, cells surviving PLK1 inhibition have decreased tumorigenic potential, and targeting PLK1 in already established tumours reduces tumour growth both in cell line- and patient-derived xenograft models. In addition, the upregulation of genes upon PLK1 inhibition correlates with their expression in normal breast tissue and with better overall survival in breast cancer patients. Our results indicate that differentiation therapy based on PLK1 inhibition is a potential alternative strategy to treat TNBC."
https://openalex.org/W4293155535,"Introduction Advances in medical science are helping to break down the barriers to surgery. In the near future, neonatal or in utero operations will become the standard for the treatment of defects in the human motor system. In order to carry out such procedures properly, detailed knowledge of fetal anatomy is necessary. It must be presented in an attractive way not only for anatomists but also for potential clinicians who will use this knowledge in contact with young patients. This work responds to this demand and presents the anatomy of the superior gluteal nerve in human fetuses in an innovative way. The aim of this work is to determine the topography and morphometry of the superior gluteal nerve in the prenatal period. We chose the superior gluteal nerve as the object of our study because of its clinical significance—for the practice of planning and carrying out hip surgery and when performing intramuscular injections. Material and methods The study was carried out on 40 human fetuses (20 females and 20 males) aged from 15 to 29 weeks (total body length v-pl from 130 to 345 mm). Following methods were used: anthropological, preparatory, image acquisition with a digital camera, computer measurement system Scion for Windows 4.0.3.2 Alpha and Image J (accuracy up to 0.01 mm without damaging the unique fetal material) and statistical methods. Results The superior gluteal nerve innervates three physiologically significant muscles of the lower limb’s girdle: gluteus medius muscle, gluteus minimus muscle and tensor fasciae latae muscle. In this study the width of the main trunk of the nerve supplying each of these three muscles was measured and the position of the nerve after leaving the suprapiriform foramen was observed. A unique typology of the distribution of branches of the examined nerve has been created. The bushy and tree forms were distinguished. There was no correlation between the occurrence of tree and bushy forms with the body side (p &gt; 0.05), but it was shown that the frequency of the occurrence of the bushy form in male fetuses is significantly higher than in female fetuses (p &lt; 0.01). Proportional and symmetrical nerve growth dynamics were confirmed and no statistically significant sexual dimorphism was demonstrated (p &gt; 0.05). Conclusions The anatomy of the superior gluteal nerve during prenatal period has been determined. We have identified two morphological forms of it. We have observed no differences between right and left superior gluteal nerve and no sexual dimorphism. The demonstrated high variability of terminal branches of the examined nerve indicates the risk of neurological complications in the case of too deep intramuscular injections and limits the range of potential surgical interventions in the gluteal region. The above research may be of practical importance, for example for hip surgery."

To explore the optimal temperature strategy, we examined the association between temperature management and survival among patients during cardiopulmonary bypass assisted coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) procedures on 30-days and 5-year postoperative survival. Adult patients (n = 5,672, 23.6% female and mean (SD) age of 66 (10) years) operated between 1997 and 2015 were included, with continuous measured intraoperative nasopharyngeal temperatures. The association between mortality and patient characteristics, laboratory parameters, the lowest intraoperative plateau temperature and intraoperative cooling/rewarming rates were examined by multivariate Cox regression analysis. Machine learning-based cluster analysis was used to identify patient subgroups based on pre-cooling parameters and explore whether specific subgroups benefitted from a particular temperature management. Mild hypothermia (32–35°C) was independently associated with improved 30-days and 5-year survival compared to patients in other temperature categories regardless of operation year. 30 days and 5-year survival were 98% and 88% in the mild hypothermia group, whereas it amounted 93% and 80% in the severe hypothermia (&lt;30°C). Normothermia (35–37°C) showed the lowest survival after 30 days and 5 years amounting 93% and 72%, respectively. Cluster analysis identified 8 distinct patient subgroups principally defined by gender, age, kidney function and weight. The full cohort and all patient subgroups displayed the highest survival at a temperature of 32°C. Given these associations, further prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to ascertain optimal patient temperatures during CPB."

https://openalex.org/W4293093182,"Introduction Institutional delivery is crucial to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality as well as serious morbidities. However, in Ethiopia, home delivery (attended by an unskilled birth attendant) after antenatal care (ANC) visit is highly in practice. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the spatial variation and determinants of home delivery after antenatal care visits in Ethiopia. Method A secondary data analysis was conducted using the 2019 mini Ethiopian demographic and health survey. A total of 2,923 women who had ANC visits were included. Spatial analysis was done by using GIS 10.7 and SaTscan 9.6. The risk areas for home delivery from GIS and spatial scan statistics results were reported. A multi-level logistic regression model was fitted using Stata14 to identify individual and community-level factors associated with home delivery after ANC visit. Finally, AOR with 95% CI and random effects were reported. Result Home delivery after ANC visit was spatially clustered in Ethiopia(Moran’s index = 0.52, p-value &lt;0.01 ). The primary clusters were detected in Oromia and SNNP region (LLR = 37.48, p &lt; 0.001 and RR = 2.30) and secondary clusters were located in Benishangul Gumuz, Amhara, Tigray and Afar (LLR = 29.45, p&lt;0.001 and RR = 1.54). Being rural resident (AOR = 2.52; 95%CI 1.09–5.78), having no formal education (AOR = 3.19;95% CI 1.11–9.16), being in the poor (AOR = 2.20;95%CI 1.51–3.22) and middle wealth index (AOR = 2.07;95% CI 1.44–2.98), having one ANC visit (AOR = 2.64; 95% CI 1.41–4.94), and living in the agrarian region (AOR = 3.63; 95%CI 1.03–12.77) had increased the odds of home delivery after ANC visit. Conclusion and recommendation Home delivery after ANC visit was spatially clustered in Ethiopia. Factors like maternal education, wealth index, number of ANC visits, residency and region were significantly associated with home delivery after ANC visit. Therefore, it is better to increase the number of ANC contact by giving health education, especially for women with low levels of education and better to improve the wealth status of women. A special strategy is also vital to reduce home delivery after ANC visit in those high-risk regions."
https://openalex.org/W4293093200,"Faking in a psychological test is often observed whenever an examinee may gain an advantage from it. Although techniques are available to identify a faker, they cannot identify the specific questions distorted by faking. This work evaluates the effectiveness of term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF)—an information retrieval mathematical tool used in search engines and language representations—in identifying single-item faked responses. We validated the technique on three datasets containing responses to the 10-item Big Five questionnaire (total of 694 participants, respectively 221, 243, and 230) in three faking situations. Each participant responded twice, once faking to achieve an objective in one of three contexts (one to obtain child custody and two to land a job) and once honestly. The proposed TF-IDF model has proven very effective in separating honest from dishonest responses—with the honest ones having low TF-IDF values and the dishonest ones having higher values—and in identifying which of the 10 responses to the questionnaire were distorted in the dishonest condition. We also provide examples of the technique in a single-case evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W4293093289,"Recommender systems (RSs) have become increasingly vital in the modern information era and connected economy. They play a key role in business operations by generating personalized suggestions and minimizing information overload. However, the performance of traditional RSs is limited by data sparseness and cold-start issues. Though deep learning-based recommender systems (DLRSs) are very popular, they underperform when considering rating matrices with sparse entries. Despite their performance improvements, DLRSs also suffer from data sparsity, cold start, serendipity, and generalizability issues. We propose a multistage model that uses multimodal data embedding and deep transfer learning for effective and personalized product recommendations, and is designed to overcome data sparsity and cold-start issues. The proposed model includes two phases. In the first—offline—phase, a deep learning technique is implemented to learn hidden features from a large image dataset (targeting new item cold start), and a multimodal data embedding is used to produce dense user feature and item feature vectors (targeting user cold start). This phase produces three different similarity matrices that are used as inputs for the second—online—phase to generate a list of top-n relevant items for a target user. We analyzed the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed model against the existing baseline RSs using a Brazilian E-commerce dataset. The results show that our model scored 0.5882 for MAE and 0.4011 for RMSE which is lower than baseline RSs which indicates that the model achieved an improved accuracy and was able to minimize the typical cold start and data sparseness issues during the recommendation process."

Various socioeconomic factors and food subsidies influence diets in India. Indian food systems face the challenge of sustainably nourishing the 1.3 billion population. However, existing studies focus on a few food system components, and holistic analysis is still missing. We identify Indian food systems covering six food system components: food consumption, production, processing, policy, environmental footprints, and socioeconomic factors from the latest Indian household consumer expenditure survey. We identify 10 Indian food systems using k-means cluster analysis on 15 food system indicators belonging to the six components. Based on the major source of calorie intake, we classify the ten food systems into production-based (3), subsidy-based (3), and market-based (4) food systems. Home-produced and subsidized food contribute up to 2000 kcal/consumer unit (CU)/day and 1651 kcal/CU/day, respectively, in these food systems. The calorie intake of 2158 to 3530 kcal/CU/day in the food systems reveals issues of malnutrition in India. Environmental footprints are commensurate with calorie intake in the food systems. Embodied GHG, land footprint, and water footprint estimates range from 1.30 to 2.19 kg CO 2 eq/CU/day, 3.89 to 6.04 m 2 /CU/day, and 2.02 to 3.16 m 3 /CU/day, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W4293150358,"Unveiling the main drivers of economic growth is of paramount importance. Previous research recognizes the critical role played by the factors of production: capital and labor. However, the exact mechanisms that underpin Total Factor Productivity (TFP) are not fully understood. An increasing number of studies suggests that the creation and transmission of knowledge, factor supply and economic integration are indeed crucial. Yet, the need for a systematic and unifying framework still exists. Nowadays capital and labor are embedded into a complex network structure through global supply chains and international migration. Recent research has established a link between network centralities and different types of social capital. In this work we employ the OECD’s Multi-Regional Input-Output and International Migration datasets to build the network representation for capital and labor of 63 economies during 10 years. We then examine the role of social capital measures as drivers of the TFP adopting an extended Cobb-Douglass production function and addressing potential issues such as multicollinearity, reverse causality and non-linear effects. Our results indicate that social capital in the factors of production networks can significantly drive economic outputs through TFP."
https://openalex.org/W4293150364,"MYC is one of the most dysregulated oncogenes and is thought to be fundamental to tumor formation and/or maintenance in many cancer types. This dominant pro-tumor activity makes MYC an attractive target for cancer therapy. However, MYC is a transcription factor lacking enzymatic activity, and the structure of one of its two domains is unknown e.g., its transactivation domain. Consequently, few direct MYC-targeting therapies have been developed, and none have been successful in the clinic. Nevertheless, significant effort has been devoted to understanding the mechanisms of oncogenic MYC activity with the objective of uncovering novel vulnerabilities of MYC-dependent cancers. These extensive investigations have revealed in detail how MYC translocation, amplification, and other upstream perturbations contribute to MYC activity in cancer. However, missense mutations of the MYC gene have remained relatively understudied for their potential role in MYC-mediated oncogenesis. While the function of several low-frequency mutations in MYC have been described, our understanding of other equally or more frequent mutations is incomplete. Herein, we define the function of a recurrent missense mutation in MYC resulting in the substitution S146L. This mutation enhances the interaction between MYC and its cofactor TRRAP and may enhance oncogenic MYC activity in certain cellular contexts. Implication Our results fortify the mechanistic understanding of oncogenic MYC and may indicate a novel prognostic marker for patients whose tumors harbor the somatic mutation resulting in MYC S146L."
https://openalex.org/W4293150402,"Valid, reliable behavioral data and contextually meaningful interventions are necessary for improved health outcomes. Ecological Momentary Assessment and Intervention (EMAI), which collects data as behaviors occur to deliver real-time interventions, may be more accurate and reliable than retrospective methods. The rapid expansion of mobile technologies in low-and-middle-income countries allows for unprecedented remote data collection and intervention opportunities. However, no previous studies have trialed EMAI in sub-Saharan Africa. We assessed EMAI acceptability and feasibility, including participant retention and response rate, in a prospective, parallel group, randomized pilot trial in Rakai, Uganda comparing behavioral outcomes among adults submitting ecological momentary assessments (EMA) versus EMAI. After training, participants submitted EMA data on five nutrition and health risk behaviors over a 90-day period using a smartphone-based application utilizing prompt-based, participant-initiated, and geospatial coordinate data collection, with study coordinator support and incentives for &gt;50% completion. Included behaviors and associated EMAI-arm intervention messages were selected to pilot a range of EMAI applications. Acceptability was measured on questionnaires. We estimated the association between high response rate and participant characteristics and conducted thematic analysis characterizing participant experiences. Study completion was 48/50 participants. Median prompt response rate was 66.5% (IQR: 60.0%-78.6%). Prior smartphone app use at baseline (aPR 3.76, 95%CI: 1.16–12.17, p = 0.03) and being in the intervention arm (aPR 2.55, 95% CI: 1.01–6.44, p = 0.05) were significantly associated with the top response rate quartile (response to &gt;78.6% of prompts). All participants submitted self-initiated reports, covering all behaviors of interest, including potentially sensitive behaviors. Inconsistent phone charging was the most reported feasibility challenge. In this pilot, EMAI was acceptable and feasible. Response rates were good; additional strategies to improve compliance should be investigated. EMAI using mobile technologies may support improved behavioral data collection and intervention approaches in low and middle-income settings. This approach should be tested in larger studies."
https://openalex.org/W4293155423,"Background Despite current resuscitation strategies, circulatory shock and organ injury after cardiac surgery occur in 25–40% of patients. Goal-directed resuscitation after cardiac surgery has generated significant interest, but clinical practice to normalize hemodynamic variables including mean arterial pressure, cardiac filling pressures, and cardiac output may not reverse microcirculation abnormalities and do not address cellular dysoxia. Recent advances in technology have made it possible to measure critical components of oxygen delivery and oxygen utilization systems in live human tissues and blood cells. The MicroRESUS study will be the first study to measure microcirculatory and mitochondrial function in patients with circulatory shock and link these findings with clinical outcomes. Methods and analysis This will be a prospective, observational study that includes patients undergoing elective cardiovascular surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Microcirculation will be quantified with sublingual incident dark field videomicroscopy. Mitochondrial respiration will be measured by performing a substrate–uncoupler–inhibitor titration protocol with high resolution respirometry on peripheral blood mononuclear cells at baseline and serial timepoints during resuscitation and at recovery as a possible liquid biomarker. Plasma samples will be preserved for future analysis to examine endothelial injury and other mechanisms of microcirculatory dysfunction. Thirty-day ventilator and vasopressor-free days (VVFDs) will be measured as a primary outcome, along with sequential organ failure assessment scores, and other clinical parameters to determine if changes in microcirculation and mitochondrial respiration are more strongly associated with clinical outcomes compared to traditional resuscitation targets. Discussion This will be the first prospective study to examine both microcirculatory and mitochondrial function in human patients with circulatory shock undergoing cardiac bypass and address a key mechanistic knowledge gap in the cardiovascular literature. The results of this study will direct future research efforts and therapeutic development for patients with shock."

While a physically active lifestyle is crucial in decreasing this risk, physical activity (PA) levels among this group remain low. The objectives of this study were to explore social and cultural factors that influence PA behavior, investigate how immigration process intersects with PA behaviors to influence PA levels and to engage community in a discussion about what can be done to increase PA in the South Asian community. Methods For this qualitative study, we conducted four Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) among a subset of participants who were part of a larger study. FGD data was coded and analysed using directed content analysis to identify key categories. Results Participants expressed a range of opinions, attitudes and beliefs about PA. Most believed they were sufficiently active. Women talked about restrictive social and cultural norms that discouraged uptake of exercise. Post-immigration levels of PA were low due to change in type of work and added responsibilities. Conclusion Health promoters need to consider social, cultural, and structural contexts when exploring possible behavior change interventions for South Asian immigrants."

Timely intervention to neonatal morbidity and early neonatal care visit could reduce the burden of mortality. Studies related to home based postnatal care is limited in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to assess home based postnatal care visits and determinants in Ethiopia.A secondary data analysis using 2016 EDHS data was conducted among 7590 women who had live births two years preceding the survey. A multilevel mixed-effect logistic regression analysis model was used and those variables with a P-value ≤ of 0.05 in multivariable analysis were considered as predictors. Results: Home based postpartum care by health care providers was 6.3% and 67.9% of women gave birth at home. Women perceived that distance is not big problem [AOR = 1.37; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.68], richer wealth index [AOR = 1.69; 95% CI: 1.15, 2.48], attending antenatal care visit [AOR = 2.17; 95% CI:1.57, 2.99], giving birth in health institution [AOR = 2.07; 95% CI:1.53, 2.80], giving birth by cesarean section [AOR = 3.41; 95% CI: 2.33, 4.99], and having awareness about neonatal danger sign [AOR = 3.68; 95% CI: 2.90,4.70] were factors associated with home based postpartum care.Home based care by health care providers was low. Therefore, measures should be taken in increasing the number of nearby health care facility, strengthen the continuum of care on antenatal care follow-up, institutional delivery and improve mother's knowledge about neonatal danger sign."

In previous studies, key factors such as greenness, wetness, and temperature were extracted from satellite images to assess the urban ecological environment. Although air pollution has become increasingly serious as urbanisation proceeds, information on air pollution is not included in existing models. The Sentinel-5P satellite launched by the European Space Agency in 2017 is a reliable data source for monitoring air quality. By making full use of images from Landsat 8, Sentinel-2A, and Sentinel-5P, this work attempts to construct a new remote sensing monitoring index for urban ecology by adding air quality information to the existing remote sensing ecological index. The proposed index was tested in the Beijing metropolitan area using satellite data from 2020. The results obtained using the proposed index differ greatly in the central urban region and near large bodies of water from those obtained using the existing remote sensing monitoring model, indicating that air quality plays a significant role in evaluating the urban ecological environment. Because the model constructed in this study integrates information on vegetation, soil, humidity, heat, and air quality, it can comprehensively and objectively reflect the quality of the urban ecological environment.

Here, we show a specific bop1 expression in the developing anterior tissue of the South African clawed frog Xenopus laevis . Morpholino oligonucleotide-mediated knockdown approaches demonstrated that Bop1 is required for proper development of the cranial cartilage, brain, and the eyes. Furthermore, we show that bop1 knockdown leads to impaired retinal lamination with disorganized cell layers. Expression of neural crest-, brain-, and eye-specific marker genes was disturbed. Apoptotic and proliferative processes, which are known to be affected during ribosomal biogenesis defects, are not hindered upon bop1 knockdown. Because early Xenopus embryos contain a large store of maternal ribosomes, we considered if Bop1 might have a role independent of de novo ribosomal biogenesis. At early embryonic stages, pax6 expression was strongly reduced in bop1 morphants and synergy experiments indicate a common signaling pathway of the two molecules, Bop1 and Pax6. Our studies imply a novel function of Bop1 independent of ribosomal biogenesis."

West J. Waine C. Craik D. Anderson M. Biosynthesis and insecticidal properties of plant cyclotides: the cyclic knotted proteins from Oldenlandia affinis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10614-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Similarly, a recent study showcased the activity of the prototypic bracelet cyclotide cycloviolacin O2 (cyO2) against Myzus persicae probing and feeding behavior (16Dancewicz K. Slazak B. Kielkiewicz M. Kapusta M. Bohdanowicz J. Gabrys B. Behavioral and physiological effects of Viola spp. cyclotides on Myzus persicae (Sulz.).J. Insect Physiol. 2020; 122104025Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The bioinsecticide Sero-X (https://innovate-ag.com.au/sero-x/) is produced from an extract of the cyclotide-bearing plant Clitoria ternatea (Fabaceae) and was recently approved for agricultural use against various insect pests including Helicoverpa species, green mirids, green vegetable bugs, and whiteflies. The cyclotide Cter M, isolated from C. ternatea (Fig. 1B) (17Poth A.G. Colgrave M.L. Lyons R.E. Daly N.L. Craik D.J. Discovery of an unusual biosynthetic origin for circular proteins in legumes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2011; 108: 10127-10132Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), displays insecticidal activity against the cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera, suggesting it may be responsible for the activity of Sero-X. Peptide-based bioinsecticides offer potential advantages over traditional pesticides of lower off-target toxicity, reduced environmental impacts, and more sustainable manufacture. Recently, noncyclic analogs of cyclotides, called acyclotides, have attracted increasing attention (18Tammineni R. Gulati P. Kumar S. Mohanty A. An overview of acyclotides: past, present and future.Phytochemistry. 2020; 170112215Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 19Nguyen G.K. Lian Y.L. Pang E.W.H. Phuong Q.T.N. Tran T.D. Tam J.P.

Chem. 2013; 288: 3370-3380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Acyclotides have a similar sequence to cyclotides and also contain a cystine knot but lack a head-to-tail cyclic backbone. The backbone cyclization is absent due to a stop codon occupying the position that would encode an Asx (Asn or Asp) residue in a typical cyclotide precursor (20Dang T.T. Chan L.Y. Tombling B.J.

Prod. 2021; 84: 395-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This key Asx residue and an adjacent C-terminal tail peptide in the precursor facilitate cyclization in cyclotides by asparaginyl endopeptidase enzymes in plants (19Nguyen G.K. Lian Y.L. Pang E.W.H.

Despite their acyclic backbone, acyclotides have comparable stability and structures to cyclotides, primarily due to the stabilizing effect of the cystine knot motif (20Dang T.T. Chan L.Y. Tombling B.J. Harvey P.J. Gilding E.K. Craik D.J. Planta discovery and chemical synthesis of bracelet cystine knot peptides from Rinorea bengalensis.J. Nat.

Apart from local changes at the terminal residues, the NMR structures of two acyclotides, violacin A, and MCoTI-V have shown that linearization has negligible effects upon the structure of the cystine knot core (22Ireland D.C.

Examination of species from the five dicot families known to produce cyclotides (namely the Violaceae, Rubiaceae, Solanaceae, Cucurbitaceae, and Fabaceae) suggests that fewer acyclotides than cyclotides are produced by these plants (24Wang C.K. Kaas Q. Chiche L. Craik D.J.

Wang C. Craik D.J. CyBase: a database of cyclic protein sequence and structure.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D192-D194Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Some monocots from the Poaceae family express acyclotides but no cyclotide has so far been discovered in this plant family (19Nguyen G.K. Lian Y.L. Pang E.W.H. Phuong Q.T.N. Tran T.D. Tam J.P.

Although acyclotides host features common to the bracelet or Möbius cyclotide subfamilies, they are topologically linear. Examples include violacin A (Möbius subfamily) (22Ireland D.C. Colgrave M.L. Nguyencong P. Daly N.L. Craik D.J. Discovery and characterization of a linear cyclotide from Viola odorata: implications for the processing of circular proteins.J. Mol.

Prod. 2019; 82: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Overall, there are currently around 105 acyclotides reported with about 85% of them being homologous to bracelet subfamily cyclotides. Due to their apparent scarcity in nature compared to cyclotides, the biological activities of acyclotides have been less extensively studied. Specifically, there have been no reported studies assessing the insecticidal activities of acyclotides, highlighting this as an unexplored research field. Pesticides are a keystone in the agricultural sector, and the need for developing alternative insecticidal compounds is becoming increasingly apparent due to the negative environmental impacts of many existing pesticides (28Hossard L. Philibert A. Bertrand M. Colnenne-David C. Debaeke P. Munier-Jolain N. et al.Effects of halving pesticide use on wheat production.Sci. Rep. 2014; 4: 4405Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Some widely used conventional insecticides are composed of chemicals that cause environmental damage to surroundings and can pose health risks to the wider population (29Braga A.R.C. de Rosso V.V. Harayashiki C.A.Y. Jimenez P.C. Castro Í.B. Global health risks from pesticide use in Brazil.Nat. Food. 2020; 1: 312-314Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For instance, there have been reports of residual insecticides leading to increased cancer risk (30Gill J.P.S. Bedi J.S. Singh R. Fairoze M.N. Hazarika R.A. Gaurav A. et al.Pesticide residues in peri-urban bovine milk from India and risk assessment: a multicenter study.Sci.

Epidemiological characteristics of pesticide poisoning in Jiangsu Province, China, from 2007 to 2016.Sci. Rep. 2019; 9: 8604Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thus, environmentally friendly insecticides, such as Sero-X, are attractive alternatives to harsh chemicals, potentially helping to reduce contamination and damage to ecosystems. Drosophila suzukii is a major fruit pest in the North America and Asia (32Goodhue R.E. Bolda M. Farnsworth D. Williams J.C. Zalom F.G.

In the current study, a family of acyclotides previously discovered from the stem and leaf of Rinorea bengalensis, named ribe peptides (20Dang T.T. Chan L.Y. Tombling B.J. Harvey P.J. Gilding E.K. Craik D.J. Planta discovery and chemical synthesis of bracelet cystine knot peptides from Rinorea bengalensis.J. Nat. Prod. 2021; 84: 395-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), were isolated and evaluated for their potential insecticidal activity. The toxicity of these peptides was examined against two insect cell lines in vitro and tested for in vivo insecticidal activity against D. melanogaster (Fig. 1C). Ribe 31 was found to be more toxic than the well-characterized insecticidal cyclotide kalata B1. Structural analysis revealed that all ribe peptides display a similar cystine knot motif and tertiary structure to cyclotides. Ribe 31 was shown to bind preferentially to a model membrane containing phospholipids with phosphatidyl-ethanolamine (PE) headgroups, suggesting that its ability to disrupt membrane is related to its insecticidal activity. Our results suggest that ribe 31 is a useful lead for the development of ecofriendly biocides for crop protection. Ribe peptides isolated from stem and leaf tissue extracts of R. bengalensis were purified and separated based on their hydrophobicity as evaluated by their elution times in reverse-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) (Fig. 2A). Generally, peaks with a later elution time are more hydrophobic. From early to late elution, the order of hydrophobicity was acyclotides ribe 10, 20, 24, and 31, and cyclotide ribe 33. Amino acid sequences of the isolated peptides are shown in Fig. 2B. In vitro assays indicated that several purified peptides (ribe 10, 20, 24, 31, 33) and the stem extract from R. bengalensis had cytotoxic activity against insect cells (Table 1). The in vivo insecticidal activity of these peptides for D. melanogaster were evaluated and compared to known insecticidal cyclotides cyO2 and kalata B1. Initial screening involved feeding flies with stem extracts (50 μg), ribe peptides (16 μM), or 10% sucrose (vehicle control) using the capillary feeder (CAFE) assay (Fig. S1, Supporting Information). In this screen, only ribe 31 caused a reduction in lifespan.Table 1Cytotoxicity and hemolytic activity of isolated peptides against insect cell lines (Sf9 and High Five) and red blood cellsPeptideCC50 (μM) ± SEMaCytotoxic concentration required to kill 50% of the cells (CC50) with data representing the SEM from triplicates.Sf9bSf9: a clonal isolate derived from Spodoptera frugiperda Sf21 cells.High fivecHigh Five: an insect cell line originating from the ovarian cells of the cabbage looper, Trichoplusia ni.RBCdN.D.: not determined due to insufficient samples.ribe 100.8 ± 0.01.3 ± 0.114.0 ± 0.2ribe 203.5 ± 0.18.3 ± 0.1>25ribe 240.3 ± 0.00.9 ± 0.111.3 ± 0.1ribe 310.7 ± 0.02.6 ± 0.121.4 ± 0.2ribe 331.6 ± 0.13.2 ± 0.121.9 ± 0.2stem extract0.3 ± 0.00.7 ± 0.1N.D.kalata B13.2 ± 0.1N.D.8.4 ± 0.1cyO20.2 ± 0.01.0 ± 0.022.0 ± 0.2a Cytotoxic concentration required to kill 50% of the cells (CC50) with data representing the SEM from triplicates.b Sf9: a clonal isolate derived from Spodoptera frugiperda Sf21 cells.c High Five: an insect cell line originating from the ovarian cells of the cabbage looper, Trichoplusia ni.d N.D.: not determined due to insufficient samples. Open table in a new tab Subsequently, multiple concentrations of ribe 31 were tested to determine a dose–response relationship. As shown in Fig. 3A, the lifespan of the flies was shorter with increasing peptide concentrations. When ribe 31 was administered at 1.6, 16, and 160 μM, the average fly survival decreased by –200, –252, and –352 h, respectively. This average survival rate was drastically lower than that for control flies (average survival of 458 h). Thus, these results confirm that the administration of ribe 31 shortened the lifespan of D. melanogaster in a dose–response manner, with concentrations as low as 1.6 μM, provoking substantial toxicity. Cyclotides cyO2 and kalata B1 have previously been shown to be effective on M. persicae (16Dancewicz K. Slazak B. Kielkiewicz M. Kapusta M. Bohdanowicz J. Gabrys B. Behavioral and physiological effects of Viola spp. cyclotides on Myzus persicae (Sulz.).J. Insect Physiol. 2020; 122104025Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and to impair the growth and development of H. punctigera, respectively (15Jennings C. West J. Waine C. Craik D. Anderson M. Biosynthesis and insecticidal properties of plant cyclotides: the cyclic knotted proteins from Oldenlandia affinis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10614-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). To extend our understanding of toxicity to the Diptera order of insects, cyO2 and kalata B1 were tested on vinegar flies here, and it was found that lifespan declined with increasing concentrations of cyO2 and kalata B1. However, the toxic effect of cyO2 was not as strong as that of ribe 31, as cyO2 administered at 1.6, 16, and 160 μM reduced average survival by –137, –174 and –310 h, respectively (Fig. 3B). In addition, the effect of kalata B1 on survival was weaker; the average survival reduction was –39, –99, and –140 h when administered at 1.7, 17, and 170 μM, respectively (Fig. 3C). More details on the side-by-side comparison of ribe 31 versus cyO2 or kalata B1 on fly survival are shown in Fig. 2. The secondary structure elements of the ribe peptides were evaluated by measuring their secondary Hα NMR chemical shifts (i.e., the difference of measured shifts from random coil values). These shifts were compared to those of cyO2, which also belongs to the bracelet cyclotide subfamily (Fig. 4A) (41Göransson U. Herrmann A. Burman R. Haugaard-Jönsson L.M. Rosengren K.J. The conserved Glu in the cyclotide cycloviolacin O2 has a key structural role.ChemBioChem. 2009; 10: 2354-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Overall, the ribe peptides showed similar secondary shifts to cyO2, indicating that all the peptides have similar secondary structure elements. Slight differences were observed between the ribe peptides in the loops that showed sequence variability. In particular, the different loop lengths and sequences of ribe 20 result in chemical shift differences compared to the other ribe acyclotides, in loops 3, 5, and 6 (Fig. S3, Supporting Information). The amino acid sequence of loop 3 was variable among the studied peptides, and the corresponding Hα shifts were also different, suggesting different conformations. To determine the effect of an acyclic backbone on structure, the three-dimensional structure of ribe 31 was determined based on NMR spectroscopy measurements. A total of 326 distance restraints and 32 dihedral angle restraints was used to calculate preliminary structures with the following imposed disulfide connectivities: Cys4-Cys20, Cys8-Cys22, and Cys13-Cys27. Both proline residues in loops 2 and 6 were determined to adopt a trans conformation based on strong Hδ(i)Pro-Hα(i-1) NOEs. Amide temperature coefficients identified six residue pairs involved in hydrogen bond interactions (Cys4 HN–Cys27 O, Ser21 HN–Tyr28 O, Arg23 HN–Val 26 O, Cys27 HN–Glu6 O, Tyr28 HN–Ser21 O, and Arg29 HN–Ile2 O). The final ensemble of structures (Fig. 4B) is well defined with an average pairwise RMSD across backbone atoms of 0.71 Å. The models were of very good quality as evidenced by an average MolProbity score of 1.8 (Table S2). Despite the linear nature of ribe 31, its backbone structure overlays well with that of cyO2 (RMSD 0.90 Å) with conservation of the three stranded antiparallel β-sheet, hydrogen bonding network across the core, and a short α-helix in loop 3 (Fig. 4C). Homology models of all tested peptides are illustrated in Fig. 5A as ribbon (left) and surface (right) representations. Analyzing the surface properties of the ribe peptides from the models visualizes the distribution of the hydrophobic patches that derive from residues in loops 2 and 3. Compared to ribe 10 and 20, ribe 24, 31, and 33 have an additional hydrophobic residue in their loop 3. The models suggest that loop 3 drives the difference in hydrophobicity between the peptides. Ribe 24, 31, and 33 indeed have longer HPLC retention times than the other two ribe peptides (10 and 20, see Fig. 2A). The more hydrophobic ribe peptides 24, 31, and 33 were expected to bind with higher affinity to lipid membranes than ribe 10 and ribe 20, as later tested using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). To assess the potency of the ribe peptides as insecticidal agents, their activity against two pest insect cell lines was tested using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. In experiments comparing selected peptides to an extract, the stem extract from R. bengalensis (5 mg/ml) containing a plethora of acyclotides was shown to be toxic to both insect cell lines (Table 1), suggesting that the plant-expressed peptides are potentially cytotoxic. Isolated ribe peptides had different levels of cytotoxicity toward the two insect cell lines, as shown in Table 1. Ribe 10, ribe 24, and ribe 31 had higher toxicity against Sf9 cells, whereas ribe 20 was the least toxic to both insect cell lines. The grand average of hydropathy (42Jaspard E. Macherel D.

As a result, prognostic factors for this patient population are not well described. Methods EC patients with CNSm were identified retrospectively from two academic centers. EC patients without CNSm (non-CNSm) were used as controls. Chi-square and Fisher’s exact tests were used for analysis of categorial variables. Wilcoxon tests were used for quantitative measures. Overall survival (OS) was compared with Log-rank test. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios for OS. Results 22 EC patients with CNSm and 354 non-CNSm patients were included. Compared to non-CNSm EC, the CNSm cohort was younger (58.5 vs 62.0 years, p = 0.018) with lower BMI (27.7 vs. 33.7 kg/m 2 , p = 0.005), and had more advanced stages (p = ≤ 0.001), grade 3 tumors (81.8% CNSm vs 25.1% non CNSm, p≤0.001) and serous histology (22.7% vs 8.5%, p = 0.010). Median survival after CNSm diagnosis was 9 months (95% CI 4, NA). CNSm was a strong poor prognostic factor (HR death 4.96, p = 0.022). Improved OS was seen with CNS as the only disease site (83m CNSm only vs 30m additional sites, p = 0.007) and less than five CNSm (49m &lt;5 vs. 23m ≥5, p = 0.004). Surgical resection of CNSm (OS 83m surgery vs 33m no surgery, p = 0.003) or multimodal therapy (83m multimodal vs 33m single therapy, p = 0.027) resulted in longer OS. Conclusions CNSm is a poor prognostic factor in EC, however, low volume disease with aggressive treatment may result in more favorable survival outcomes."

A 2 2 full factorial design was selected for the present study. Prunus domestica gum and HPMC (K4M) were used as independent variables, swelling index and drug dissolution at 12 hours as dependent variables. Formulations were subjected to pre- and post-compression tests that showed good micromeritics and buoyancy characteristics (Carr’s index 11.76%–14.00%, Hausner’s ratio 1.13°–1.16°, angle of repose 22.67°–25.21°, floating lag time 56–76 seconds, total floating time 18–25 hours and swelling index 59.87%–139.66%). The cumulative drug release in 0.1 N HCl at 12 hours was 72%–90% (p&lt;0.05). Weibull model was found to be the best fit model (R 2 &gt;0.99) among all other studied models.

We investigated roles of twist-related protein 1 (TWIST1) in EMT phenomenon and renal fibrosis through C3 upregulation in a mouse UUO model with gene silencer pyrrole-imidazole (PI) polyamides targeting TWIST1. We designed and synthesized PI polyamides targeting TWIST1 binding site on mouse pre-pro C3 promoter. Increased expression C3 mRNA with interferon-γ was significantly inhibited with PI polyamide in nephrotubular epithelial cells. Immunofluorescence showed suppression of E-cadherin and enhancement of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) stainings as EMT phenomena in UUO kidney. TWIST1 and C3 expression was significantly increased in UUO kidney versus contralateral unobstructed kidney (CUK). Expression of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), α-SMA and renin mRNAs was increased in UUO kidney versus CUK. Systemic administration of TWIST1 PI polyamide significantly suppressed increased C3 expression in UUO kidney versus CUK. PI polyamide administration also suppressed the increased expression of TGF-β1, α-SMA and renin mRNAs and histologically improved renal fibrosis in UUO kidney. These findings indicate that TWIST1 induces EMT phenomenon and renal fibrosis by TGF-β1 upregulation of C3 in mouse UUO model and that TWIST1 PI polyamide may be a novel medicine for renal fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W4293242125,"A large volume of freshwater is incorporated in the relatively fresh (salinity ~32–33) Pacific Ocean waters that are transported north through the Bering Strait relative to deep Atlantic salinity in the Arctic Ocean (salinity ~34.8). These freshened waters help maintain the halocline that separates cold Arctic surface waters from warmer Arctic Ocean waters at depth. The stable oxygen isotope composition of the Bering Sea contribution to the upper Arctic Ocean halocline was established as early as the late 1980’s as having a δ 18 O V - SMOW value of approximately -1.1‰. More recent data indicates a shift to an isotopic composition that is more depleted in 18 O (mean δ 18 O value ~-1.5‰). This shift is supported by a data synthesis of &gt;1400 water samples (salinity from 32.5 to 33.5) from the northern Bering and Chukchi seas, from the years 1987–2020, which show significant year-to-year, seasonal and regional variability. This change in the oxygen isotope composition of water in the upper halocline is consistent with observations of added freshwater in the Canada Basin, and mooring-based estimates of increased freshwater inflows through Bering Strait. Here, we use this isotopic time-series as an independent means of estimating freshwater flux changes through the Bering Strait. We employed a simple end-member mixing model that requires that the volume of freshwater (including runoff and other meteoric water, but not sea ice melt) flowing through Bering Strait has increased by ~40% over the past two decades to account for a change in the isotopic composition of the 33.1 salinity water from a δ 18 O value of approximately -1.1‰ to a mean of -1.5‰. This freshwater flux change is comparable with independent published measurements made from mooring arrays in the Bering Strait (freshwater fluxes rising from 2000–2500 km 3 in 2001 to 3000–3500 km 3 in 2011)."

Potential participants were approached through hospital registries. The survey had 56.2% response rate. Participants (N = 114, 50% men), 27 to 94 years old (71.6±12.9 years), were categorized as: older-old (n = 51), younger-old (n = 34) and young (n = 29). They answered questions on health, functioning and contextual factors, the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) and the Behavioural Regulation Exercise Questionnaire-2. Descriptive analysis was used, along with analysis of variance for continuous data and Fisher´s exact tests for categorical variables. TukeyHSD, was used for comparing possible age-group pairings.The responses reflected ICF´s personal and environmental factors as well as body function, activities, and participation. Comparisons between age-groups revealed that the oldest participants reported more anxiety and depression and used more walking devices and fewer smart devices than individuals in both the younger-old and young groups. In the SIS, the oldest participants had lower scores than both younger groups in the domains of activities of daily living and mobility.These findings provide important information on needs and opportunities in community-based rehabilitation for first-time stroke survivors and reveal that this population has good access to smart devices which can be used in community integration. Moreover, our results support the need for analysis in subgroups of age among the heterogenous group of older individuals in this population."
https://openalex.org/W4293242230,"A clustering algorithm is a solution for grouping a set of objects and for distribution centre location problems. But the common K-means clustering algorithm may give local optimal solutions. Swarm intelligent algorithms simulate the social behaviours of animals and avoid local optimal solutions. We employ three swarm intelligent algorithms to avoid these solutions. We propose a new algorithm for the clustering problem, the fruit-fly optimization K-means algorithm (FOA K-means). We designed a distribution centre location problem and three clustering indicators to evaluate the performance of algorithms. We compare the algorithms of K-means with the ant colony optimization algorithm (ACO K-means), particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO K-means), and fruit-fly optimization algorithm. We find K-Means modified by the fruit-fly optimization algorithm (FOA K-means) has the best performance on convergence speed and three clustering indicators, compactness, separation, and integration. Thus, we can apply FOA K-means to improve the distribution centre location solution and the efficiency for distribution in the future."
https://openalex.org/W4293242328,"The Amazon Continental Shelf (ACS) is a complex habitat that receives a large annual freshwater discharge into the ocean, producing a superficial plume and carrying with it large amounts of nutrients to the continental shelf along thousands of kilometers while sustaining high biodiversity in the estuary–ocean continuum. For the first time, this study monitored six sites in a wide transect with approximately 240 km radius on the ACS every 2–4 months. The objectives were (1) to analyze the composition of larval Brachyuran crabs and (2) to predict the importance of environmental parameters (temperature, salinity and chlorophyll- a ) in structuring their abundance. A total of 17,759 larvae identified were distributed in 8 families and 24 taxa. The water salinity was the best predictor of larval distribution. The statistical models used indicated that Panopeidae and Portunidae larvae are more frequent and more likely to occur in shallow water layers, while Calappidae occur in deeper layers, and Grapsidae, Ocypodidae, Sesarmidae, Pinnotheridae and Leucosiidae occur similarly in both strata. The larval dispersal extent varies among families and throughout the year while the groups are distributed in different salinities along the platform. The probability of occurrence of Portunidae is higher in ocean water (≥ 33.5); Grapsidae, Panopeidae, and Pinnotheridae is higher in intermediate and ocean salinity waters (25.5 to 33.5); Ocypodidae, Sesarmidae and Calappidae is higher in estuarine and intermediate salinity waters (5 to 25.5), whereas Leucosiidae, euryhaline, occur in all salinities (5 to 33.5). Furthermore, the Amazon River seasonal flow and plume movement throughout the year not only regulate the larval distribution and dispersion of estuarine species but are also fundamental for the ACS species, providing the necessary nutrient input for larval development in the region."
