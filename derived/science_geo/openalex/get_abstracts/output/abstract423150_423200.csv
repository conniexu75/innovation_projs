https://openalex.org/W1969156908,"Failure of immunization with the HIV-1 envelope to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies against conserved epitopes is a major barrier to producing a preventive HIV-1 vaccine. Broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (BnAbs) from those subjects who do produce them after years of chronic HIV-1 infection have one or more unusual characteristics, including polyreactivity for host antigens, extensive somatic hypermutation and long, variable heavy-chain third complementarity-determining regions, factors that may limit their expression by host immunoregulatory mechanisms. The isolation of BnAbs from HIV-1-infected subjects and the use of computationally derived clonal lineages as templates provide a new path for HIV-1 vaccine immunogen design. This approach, which should be applicable to many infectious agents, holds promise for the construction of vaccines that can drive B cells along rare but desirable maturation pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1982636457,"The genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach has discovered hundreds of genetic variants associated with diseases and quantitative traits. However, despite clinical overlap and statistical correlation between many phenotypes, GWAS are generally performed one-phenotype-at-a-time. Here we compare the performance of modelling multiple phenotypes jointly with that of the standard univariate approach. We introduce a new method and software, MultiPhen, that models multiple phenotypes simultaneously in a fast and interpretable way. By performing ordinal regression, MultiPhen tests the linear combination of phenotypes most associated with the genotypes at each SNP, and thus potentially captures effects hidden to single phenotype GWAS. We demonstrate via simulation that this approach provides a dramatic increase in power in many scenarios. There is a boost in power for variants that affect multiple phenotypes and for those that affect only one phenotype. While other multivariate methods have similar power gains, we describe several benefits of MultiPhen over these. In particular, we demonstrate that other multivariate methods that assume the genotypes are normally distributed, such as canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and MANOVA, can have highly inflated type-1 error rates when testing case-control or non-normal continuous phenotypes, while MultiPhen produces no such inflation. To test the performance of MultiPhen on real data we applied it to lipid traits in the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 (NFBC1966). In these data MultiPhen discovers 21% more independent SNPs with known associations than the standard univariate GWAS approach, while applying MultiPhen in addition to the standard approach provides 37% increased discovery. The most associated linear combinations of the lipids estimated by MultiPhen at the leading SNPs accurately reflect the Friedewald Formula, suggesting that MultiPhen could be used to refine the definition of existing phenotypes or uncover novel heritable phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2004842526,"A prominent clinical symptom in multiple sclerosis (MS), a progressive disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) due to heightened neuro-inflammation, is learning and memory dysfunction. Here, we investigated the effects of a ketogenic diet (KD) on memory impairment and CNS-inflammation in a murine model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), using electrophysiological, behavioral, biochemical and in vivo imaging approaches. Behavioral spatial learning deficits were associated with motor disability in EAE mice, and were observed concurrently with brain inflammation. The KD improved motor disability in the EAE model, as well as CA1 hippocampal synaptic plasticity (long-term potentiation) and spatial learning and memory (assessed with the Morris Water Maze). Moreover, hippocampal atrophy and periventricular lesions in EAE mice were reversed in KD-treated EAE mice. Finally, we found that the increased expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), in our EAE model were both suppressed by the KD. Collectively, our findings indicate that brain inflammation in EAE mice is associated with impaired spatial learning and memory function, and that KD treatment can exert protective effects, likely via attenuation of the robust immune response and increased oxidative stress seen in these animals."
https://openalex.org/W2167665957,"Early life seizures can result in chronic epilepsy, cognitive deficits and behavioral changes such as autism, and conversely epilepsy is common in autistic children. We hypothesized that during early brain development, seizures could alter regulators of synaptic development and underlie the interaction between epilepsy and autism. The mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) modulates protein translation and is dysregulated in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex, a disorder characterized by epilepsy and autism. We used a rodent model of acute hypoxia-induced neonatal seizures that results in long term increases in neuronal excitability, seizure susceptibility, and spontaneous seizures, to determine how seizures alter mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling. We hypothesized that seizures occurring at a developmental stage coinciding with a critical period of synaptogenesis will activate mTORC1, contributing to epileptic networks and autistic-like behavior in later life. Here we show that in the rat, baseline mTORC1 activation peaks during the first three postnatal weeks, and induction of seizures at postnatal day 10 results in further transient activation of its downstream targets phospho-4E-BP1 (Thr37/46), phospho-p70S6K (Thr389) and phospho-S6 (Ser235/236), as well as rapid induction of activity-dependent upstream signaling molecules, including BDNF, phospho-Akt (Thr308) and phospho-ERK (Thr202/Tyr204). Furthermore, treatment with the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin immediately before and after seizures reversed early increases in glutamatergic neurotransmission and seizure susceptibility and attenuated later life epilepsy and autistic-like behavior. Together, these findings suggest that in the developing brain the mTORC1 signaling pathway is involved in epileptogenesis and altered social behavior, and that it may be a target for development of novel therapies that eliminate the progressive effects of neonatal seizures."
https://openalex.org/W2154596951,"Background Agitation in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is common and associated with poor patient life-quality and carer distress. The best evidence-based pharmacological treatments are antipsychotics which have limited benefits with increased morbidity and mortality. There are no memantine trials in clinically significant agitation but post-hoc analyses in other populations found reduced agitation. We tested the primary hypothesis, memantine is superior to placebo for clinically significant agitation, in patients with moderate-to-severe AD. Methods and Findings We recruited 153 participants with AD and clinically significant agitation from care-homes or hospitals for a double-blind randomised-controlled trial and 149 people started the trial of memantine versus placebo. The primary outcome was 6 weeks mixed model autoregressive analysis of Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI). Secondary outcomes were: 12 weeks CMAI; 6 and 12 weeks Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPI), Clinical Global Impression Change (CGI-C), Standardised Mini Mental State Examination, Severe Impairment Battery. Using a mixed effects model we found no significant differences in the primary outcome, 6 weeks CMAI, between memantine and placebo (memantine lower −3.0; −8.3 to 2.2, p = 0.26); or 12 weeks CMAI; or CGI-C or adverse events at 6 or 12 weeks. NPI mean difference favoured memantine at weeks 6 (−6.9; −12.2 to −1.6; p = 0.012) and 12 (−9.6; −15.0 to −4.3 p = 0.0005). Memantine was significantly better than placebo for cognition. The main study limitation is that it still remains to be determined whether memantine has a role in milder agitation in AD. Conclusions Memantine did not improve significant agitation in people with in moderate-to-severe AD. Future studies are urgently needed to test other pharmacological candidates in this group and memantine for neuropsychiatric symptoms.

https://openalex.org/W2093016703,"Deciphering ecological effects of major catastrophic events such as earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, storms and fires, requires rapid interdisciplinary efforts often hampered by a lack of pre-event data. Using results of intertidal surveys conducted shortly before and immediately after Chile's 2010 Mw 8.8 earthquake along the entire rupture zone (ca. 34–38°S), we provide the first quantification of earthquake and tsunami effects on sandy beach ecosystems. Our study incorporated anthropogenic coastal development as a key design factor. Ecological responses of beach ecosystems were strongly affected by the magnitude of land-level change. Subsidence along the northern rupture segment combined with tsunami-associated disturbance and drowned beaches. In contrast, along the co-seismically uplifted southern rupture, beaches widened and flattened increasing habitat availability. Post-event changes in abundance and distribution of mobile intertidal invertebrates were not uniform, varying with land-level change, tsunami height and coastal development. On beaches where subsidence occurred, intertidal zones and their associated species disappeared. On some beaches, uplift of rocky sub-tidal substrate eliminated low intertidal sand beach habitat for ecologically important species. On others, unexpected interactions of uplift with man-made coastal armouring included restoration of upper and mid-intertidal habitat seaward of armouring followed by rapid colonization of mobile crustaceans typical of these zones formerly excluded by constraints imposed by the armouring structures. Responses of coastal ecosystems to major earthquakes appear to vary strongly with land-level change, the mobility of the biota and shore type. Our results show that interactions of extreme events with human-altered shorelines can produce surprising ecological outcomes, and suggest these complex responses to landscape alteration can leave lasting footprints in coastal ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2009487345,"The longest-lived rodent, the naked mole-rat (Bathyergidae; Heterocephalus glaber), maintains robust health for at least 75% of its 32 year lifespan, suggesting that the decline in genomic integrity or protein homeostasis routinely observed during aging, is either attenuated or delayed in this extraordinarily long-lived species. The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) plays an integral role in protein homeostasis by degrading oxidatively-damaged and misfolded proteins. In this study, we examined proteasome activity in naked mole-rats and mice in whole liver lysates as well as three subcellular fractions to probe the mechanisms behind the apparently enhanced effectiveness of UPS. We found that when compared with mouse samples, naked mole-rats had significantly higher chymotrypsin-like (ChT-L) activity and a two-fold increase in trypsin-like (T-L) in both whole lysates as well as cytosolic fractions. Native gel electrophoresis of the whole tissue lysates showed that the 20S proteasome was more active in the longer-lived species and that 26S proteasome was both more active and more populous. Western blot analyses revealed that both 19S subunits and immunoproteasome catalytic subunits are present in greater amounts in the naked mole-rat suggesting that the observed higher specific activity may be due to the greater proportion of immunoproteasomes in livers of healthy young adults. It thus appears that proteasomes in this species are primed for the efficient removal of stress-damaged proteins. Further characterization of the naked mole-rat proteasome and its regulation could lead to important insights on how the cells in these animals handle increased stress and protein damage to maintain a longer health in their tissues and ultimately a longer life."
https://openalex.org/W1993602109,"Diatoms and other algae not only survive, but thrive in sea ice. Among sea ice diatoms, all species examined so far produce ice-binding proteins (IBPs), whereas no such proteins are found in non-ice-associated diatoms, which strongly suggests that IBPs are essential for survival in ice. The restricted occurrence also raises the question of how the IBP genes were acquired. Proteins with similar sequences and ice-binding activities are produced by ice-associated bacteria, and so it has previously been speculated that the genes were acquired by horizontal transfer (HGT) from bacteria. Here we report several new IBP sequences from three types of ice algae, which together with previously determined sequences reveal a phylogeny that is completely incongruent with algal phylogeny, and that can be most easily explained by HGT. HGT is also supported by the finding that the closest matches to the algal IBP genes are all bacterial genes and that the algal IBP genes lack introns. We also describe a highly freeze-tolerant bacterium from the bottom layer of Antarctic sea ice that produces an IBP with 47% amino acid identity to a diatom IBP from the same layer, demonstrating at least an opportunity for gene transfer. Together, these results suggest that the success of diatoms and other algae in sea ice can be at least partly attributed to their acquisition of prokaryotic IBP genes."
https://openalex.org/W2128849491,"Salinity is a key abiotic property of inland waters; it has a major influence on biotic communities and is affected by many natural and anthropogenic processes. Salinity of inland waters tends to increase with aridity, and biota of inland waters may have evolved greater salt tolerance in more arid regions. Here we compare the sensitivity of stream macroinvertebrate species to salinity from a relatively wet region in France (Lorraine and Brittany) to that in three relatively arid regions eastern Australia (Victoria, Queensland and Tasmania), South Africa (south-east of the Eastern Cape Province) and Israel using the identical experimental method in all locations. The species whose salinity tolerance was tested, were somewhat more salt tolerant in eastern Australia and South Africa than France, with those in Israel being intermediate. However, by far the greatest source of variation in species sensitivity was between taxonomic groups (Order and Class) and not between the regions. We used a Bayesian statistical model to estimate the species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) for salinity in eastern Australia and France adjusting for the assemblages of species in these regions. The assemblage in France was slightly more salinity sensitive than that in eastern Australia. We therefore suggest that regional salinity sensitivity is therefore likely to depend most on the taxonomic composition of respective macroinvertebrate assemblages. On this basis it would be possible to screen rivers globally for risk from salinisation."
https://openalex.org/W1985225299,"Androgen deprivation therapy has been the standard of care in prostate cancer due to its effectiveness in initial stages. However, the disease recurs, and this recurrent cancer is referred to as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Radiotherapy is the treatment of choice; however, in addition to androgen independence, CRPC is often resistant to radiotherapy, making radioresistant CRPC an incurable disease. The molecular mechanisms by which CRPC cells acquire radioresistance are unclear. Androgen receptor (AR)-tyrosine 267 phosphorylation by Ack1 tyrosine kinase (also known as TNK2) has emerged as an important mechanism of CRPC growth. Here, we demonstrate that pTyr(267)-AR is recruited to the ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) enhancer in an Ack1-dependent manner to up-regulate ATM expression. Mice engineered to express activated Ack1 exhibited a significant increase in pTyr(267)-AR and ATM levels. Furthermore, primary human CRPCs with up-regulated activated Ack1 and pTyr(267)-AR also exhibited significant increase in ATM expression. The Ack1 inhibitor AIM-100 not only inhibited Ack1 activity but also was able to suppress AR Tyr(267) phosphorylation and its recruitment to the ATM enhancer. Notably, AIM-100 suppressed Ack1 mediated ATM expression and mitigated the growth of radioresistant CRPC tumors. Thus, our study uncovers a previously unknown mechanism of radioresistance in CRPC, which can be therapeutically reversed by a new synergistic approach that includes radiotherapy along with the suppression of Ack1/AR/ATM signaling by the Ack1 inhibitor, AIM-100."
https://openalex.org/W2074375564,"Background The inflammatory response plays a critical role in hypertension-induced cardiac remodeling. We aimed to study how interaction among inflammatory cells causes inflammatory responses in the process of hypertensive cardiac fibrosis. Methodology/Principal Findings Infusion of angiotensin II (Ang II, 1500 ng/kg/min) in mice rapidly induced the expression of interferon γ (IFN-γ) and leukocytes infiltration into the heart. To determine the role of IFN-γ on cardiac inflammation and remodeling, both wild-type (WT) and IFN-γ-knockout (KO) mice were infused Ang II for 7 days, and were found an equal blood pressure increase. However, knockout of IFN-γ prevented Ang II-induced: 1) infiltration of macrophages and T cells into cardiac tissue; 2) expression of tumor necrosis factor α and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), and 3) cardiac fibrosis, including the expression of α-smooth muscle actin and collagen I (all p<0.05). Cultured T cells or macrophages alone expressed very low level of IFN-γ, however, co-culture of T cells and macrophages increased IFN-γ expression by 19.8±0.95 folds (vs. WT macrophage, p<0.001) and 20.9 ± 2.09 folds (vs. WT T cells, p<0.001). In vitro co-culture studies using T cells and macrophages from WT or IFN-γ KO mice demonstrated that T cells were primary source for IFN-γ production. Co-culture of WT macrophages with WT T cells, but not with IFN-γ-knockout T cells, increased IFN-γ production (p<0.01). Moreover, IFN-γ produced by T cells amplified MCP-1 expression in macrophages and stimulated macrophage migration. Conclusions/Significance Reciprocal interaction between macrophages and T cells in heart stimulates IFN-γ expression, leading to increased MCP-1 expression in macrophages, which results a forward-feed recruitment of macrophages, thus contributing to Ang II-induced cardiac inflammation and fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2095543724,"Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) reside in many organs including lung, as shown by their isolation from fetal lung tissues, bronchial stromal compartment, bronchial-alveolar lavage and transplanted lung tissues. It is still controversial whether lung MSCs can undergo mesenchymal-to-epithelial-transition (MET) and possess immune regulatory properties. To this aim, we isolated, expanded and characterized MSCs from normal adult human lung (lung-hMSCs) and compared with human bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-hMSCs). Our results show that lung-MSCs reside at the perivascular level and do not significantly differ from BM-hMSCs in terms of immunophenotype, stemness gene profile, mesodermal differentiation potential and modulation of T, B and NK cells. However, lung-hMSCs express higher basal level of the stemness-related marker nestin and show, following in vitro treatment with retinoic acid, higher epithelial cell polarization, which is anyway partial when compared to a control epithelial bronchial cell line. Although these results question the real capability of acquiring epithelial functions by MSCs and the feasibility of MSC-based therapeutic approaches to regenerate damaged lung tissues, the characterization of this lung-hMSC population may be useful to study the involvement of stromal cell compartment in lung diseases in which MET plays a role, such as in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2127948625,"Spike mosses are among the most basal vascular plants, and one species, Selaginella moellendorffii, was recently selected for full genome sequencing by the Joint Genome Institute (JGI). Glycosyltransferases (GTs) are involved in many aspects of a plant life, including cell wall biosynthesis, protein glycosylation, primary and secondary metabolism. Here, we present a comparative study of the S. moellendorffii genome across 92 GT families and an additional family (DUF266) likely to include GTs. The study encompasses the moss Physcomitrella patens, a non-vascular land plant, while rice and Arabidopsis represent commelinid and non-commelinid seed plants. Analysis of the subset of GT-families particularly relevant to cell wall polysaccharide biosynthesis was complemented by a detailed analysis of S. moellendorffii cell walls. The S. moellendorffii cell wall contains many of the same components as seed plant cell walls, but appears to differ somewhat in its detailed architecture. The S. moellendorffii genome encodes fewer GTs (287 GTs including DUF266s) than the reference genomes. In a few families, notably GT51 and GT78, S. moellendorffii GTs have no higher plant orthologs, but in most families S. moellendorffii GTs have clear orthologies with Arabidopsis and rice. A gene naming convention of GTs is proposed which takes orthologies and GT-family membership into account. The evolutionary significance of apparently modern and ancient traits in S. moellendorffii is discussed, as is its use as a reference organism for functional annotation of GTs."
https://openalex.org/W2046270298,"Although odour perception impacts food preferences, the effect of genotypic variation of odorant receptors (ORs) on the sensory perception of food is unclear. Human OR7D4 responds to androstenone, and genotypic variation in OR7D4 predicts variation in the perception of androstenone. Since androstenone is naturally present in meat derived from male pigs, we asked whether OR7D4 genotype correlates with either the ability to detect androstenone or the evaluation of cooked pork tainted with varying levels of androstenone within the naturally-occurring range. Consistent with previous findings, subjects with two copies of the functional OR7D4 RT variant were more sensitive to androstenone than subjects carrying a non-functional OR7D4 WM variant. When pork containing varying levels of androstenone was cooked and tested by sniffing and tasting, subjects with two copies of the RT variant tended to rate the androstenone-containing meat as less favourable than subjects carrying the WM variant. Our data is consistent with the idea that OR7D4 genotype predicts the sensory perception of meat containing androstenone and that genetic variation in an odorant receptor can alter food preferences."
https://openalex.org/W2012199881,"We evaluated the potential of two noninvasive genetic sampling methods, hair traps and bear rub surveys, to estimate population abundance and trend of grizzly (Ursus arctos) and black bear (U. americanus) populations in Banff National Park, Alberta, Canada. Using Huggins closed population mark-recapture models, we obtained the first precise abundance estimates for grizzly bears (N= 73.5, 95% CI = 64-94 in 2006; N= 50.4, 95% CI = 49-59 in 2008) and black bears (N= 62.6, 95% CI = 51-89 in 2006; N= 81.8, 95% CI = 72-102 in 2008) in the Bow Valley. Hair traps had high detection rates for female grizzlies, and male and female black bears, but extremely low detection rates for male grizzlies. Conversely, bear rubs had high detection rates for male and female grizzlies, but low rates for black bears. We estimated realized population growth rates, lambda, for grizzly bear males (λ= 0.93, 95% CI = 0.74-1.17) and females (λ= 0.90, 95% CI = 0.67-1.20) using Pradel open population models with three years of bear rub data. Lambda estimates are supported by abundance estimates from combined hair trap/bear rub closed population models and are consistent with a system that is likely driven by high levels of human-caused mortality. Our results suggest that bear rub surveys would provide an efficient and powerful means to inventory and monitor grizzly bear populations in the Central Canadian Rocky Mountains."
https://openalex.org/W2017032430,"The conserved tridisulfide array of the α-defensin family imposes a common triple-stranded β-sheet topology on peptides that may have highly diverse primary structures, resulting in differential outcomes after targeted mutagenesis. In mouse cryptdin-4 (Crp4) and rhesus myeloid α-defensin-4 (RMAD4), complete substitutions of Arg with Lys affect bactericidal peptide activity very differently. Lys-for-Arg mutagenesis attenuates Crp4, but RMAD4 activity remains mostly unchanged. Here, we show that the differential biological effect of Lys-for-Arg replacements can be understood by the distinct phase behavior of the experimental peptide-lipid system. In Crp4, small-angle x-ray scattering analyses showed that Arg-to-Lys replacements shifted the induced nanoporous phases to a different range of lipid compositions compared with the Arg-rich native peptide, consistent with the attenuation of bactericidal activity by Lys-for-Arg mutations. In contrast, such phases generated by RMAD4 were largely unchanged. The concordance between small-angle x-ray scattering measurements and biological activity provides evidence that specific types of α-defensin-induced membrane curvature-generating tendencies correspond directly to bactericidal activity via membrane destabilization."
https://openalex.org/W2053240633,"Splicing of the human vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) gene has been reported to generate angiogenic (VEGFxxx) and anti-angiogenic (VEGFxxxb) isoforms. Corresponding VEGFxxxb isoforms have also been reported in rat and mouse. We examined VEGFxxxb expression in mouse fibrosarcoma cell lines expressing all or individual VEGF isoforms (VEGF120, 164 or 188), grown in vitro and in vivo, and compared results with those from normal mouse and human tissues. Importantly, genetic construction of VEGF164 and VEGF188 expressing fibrosarcomas, in which exon 7 is fused to the conventional exon 8, precludes VEGFxxxb splicing from occurring. Thus, these two fibrosarcoma cell lines provided endogenous negative controls. Using RT-PCR we show that primers designed to simultaneously amplify VEGFxxx and VEGFxxxb isoforms amplified only VEGFxxx variants in both species. Moreover, only VEGFxxx species were generated when mouse podocytes were treated with TGFβ-1, a reported activator of VEGFxxxb splice selection in human podocytes. A VEGF164/120 heteroduplex species was identified as a PCR artefact, specifically in mouse. VEGFxxxb isoform-specific PCR did amplify putative VEGFxxxb species in mouse and human tissues, but unexpectedly also in VEGF188 and VEGF164 fibrosarcoma cells and tumours, where splicing to produce true VEGFxxxb isoforms cannot occur. Moreover, these products were only consistently generated using reverse primers spanning more than 5 bases across the 8b/7 or 8b/5 splice junctions. Primer annealing to VEGFxxx transcripts and amplification of exon 8b primer ‘tails’ explained the artefactual generation of VEGFxxxb products, since the same products were generated when the PCR reactions were performed with cDNA from VEGF164/VEGF188 ‘knock-in’ vectors used in the generation of single VEGF isoform-expressing transgenic mice from which the fibrosarcoma lines were developed. Collectively, our results highlight important pitfalls in data interpretation associated with detecting VEGFxxxb isoforms using current methods, and demonstrate that anti-angiogenic isoforms are not commonly expressed in mouse or human tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2054295855,"Background It has been shown that amyloid ß (Aβ), a product of proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid β precursor protein (APP), accumulates in neuronal cytoplasm in non-affected individuals in a cell type–specific amount. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study, we found that the percentage of amyloid-positive neurons increases in subjects diagnosed with idiopathic autism and subjects diagnosed with duplication 15q11.2-q13 (dup15) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In spite of interindividual differences within each examined group, levels of intraneuronal Aβ load were significantly greater in the dup(15) autism group than in either the control or the idiopathic autism group in 11 of 12 examined regions (p<0.0001 for all comparisons; Kruskall-Wallis test). In eight regions, intraneuronal Aβ load differed significantly between idiopathic autism and control groups (p<0.0001). The intraneuronal Aβ was mainly N-terminally truncated. Increased intraneuronal accumulation of Aβ17–40/42 in children and adults suggests a life-long enhancement of APP processing with α-secretase in autistic subjects. Aβ accumulation in neuronal endosomes, autophagic vacuoles, Lamp1-positive lysosomes and lipofuscin, as revealed by confocal microscopy, indicates that products of enhanced α-secretase processing accumulate in organelles involved in proteolysis and storage of metabolic remnants. Diffuse plaques containing Aβ1–40/42 detected in three subjects with ASD, 39 to 52 years of age, suggest that there is an age-associated risk of alterations of APP processing with an intraneuronal accumulation of a short form of Aβ and an extracellular deposition of full-length Aβ in nonfibrillar plaques. Conclusions/Significance The higher prevalence of excessive Aβ accumulation in neurons in individuals with early onset of intractable seizures, and with a high risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy in autistic subjects with dup(15) compared to subjects with idiopathic ASD, supports the concept of mechanistic and functional links between autism, epilepsy and alterations of APP processing leading to neuronal and astrocytic Aβ accumulation and diffuse plaque formation."
https://openalex.org/W1982196595,"Many conserved noncoding sequences function as transcriptional enhancers that regulate gene expression. Here, we report that protein-coding DNA also frequently contains enhancers functioning at the transcriptional level. We tested the enhancer activity of 31 protein-coding exons, which we chose based on strong sequence conservation between zebrafish and human, and occurrence in developmental genes, using a Tol2 transposable GFP reporter assay in zebrafish. For each exon we measured GFP expression in hundreds of embryos in 10 anatomies via a novel system that implements the voice-recognition capabilities of a cellular phone. We find that 24/31 (77%) exons drive GFP expression compared to a minimal promoter control, and 14/24 are anatomy-specific (expression in four anatomies or less). GFP expression driven by these coding enhancers frequently overlaps the anatomies where the host gene is expressed (60%), suggesting self-regulation. Highly conserved coding sequences and highly conserved noncoding sequences do not significantly differ in enhancer activity (coding: 24/31 vs. noncoding: 105/147) or tissue-specificity (coding: 14/24 vs. noncoding: 50/105). Furthermore, coding and noncoding enhancers display similar levels of the enhancer-related histone modification H3K4me1 (coding: 9/24 vs noncoding: 34/81). Meanwhile, coding enhancers are over three times as likely to contain an H3K4me1 mark as other exons of the host gene. Our work suggests that developmental transcriptional enhancers do not discriminate between coding and noncoding DNA and reveals widespread dual functions in protein-coding DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2010447439,"HIV-1 assembly and release occurs at the plasma membrane of human T lymphocytes and model epithelial cell lines, whereas in macrophages intracellular sites of virus assembly or accumulation predominate. The origin of the intracellular virus-containing compartment (VCC) has been controversial. This compartment is enriched in markers of the multivesicular body, and has been described as a modified endosomal compartment. Several studies of this compartment have revealed the presence of small channels connecting to the plasma membrane, suggesting that instead of an endosomal origin the compartment is a modified plasma membrane compartment. If the compartment is accessible to the external environment, this would have important implications for antiviral immune responses and antiviral therapy. We performed a series of experiments designed to determine if the VCC in macrophages was open to the external environment and accessible to antibodies and small molecules. The majority of VCCs were found to be inaccessible to exogenously-applied antibodies to tetraspanins in the absence of membrane permeabilization, while tetraspanin staining was readily observed following membrane permeabilization. Cationized ferritin was utilized to stain the plasma membrane, and revealed that the majority of virus-containing compartments were inaccessible to ferritin. Low molecular weight dextrans could access only a very small percentage of VCCs, and these tended to be more peripheral compartments. We conclude that the VCCs in monocyte-derived human macrophages are heterogeneous, but the majority of VCCs are closed to the external environment."
https://openalex.org/W1993964103,"Staphylococcus aureus is a major human pathogen, a relevant pathogen in veterinary medicine, and a major cause of food poisoning. Epidemiological investigation tools are needed to establish surveillance of S. aureus strains in humans, animals and food. In this study, we investigated 145 S. aureus isolates recovered from various animal species, disease conditions, food products and food poisoning events. Multiple Locus Variable Number of Tandem Repeat (VNTR) analysis (MLVA), known to be highly efficient for the genotyping of human S. aureus isolates, was used and shown to be equally well suited for the typing of animal S. aureus isolates. MLVA was improved by using sixteen VNTR loci amplified in two multiplex PCRs and analyzed by capillary electrophoresis ensuring a high throughput and high discriminatory power. The isolates were assigned to twelve known clonal complexes (CCs) and –a few singletons. Half of the test collection belonged to four CCs (CC9, CC97, CC133, CC398) previously described as mostly associated with animals. The remaining eight CCs (CC1, CC5, CC8, CC15, CC25, CC30, CC45, CC51), representing 46% of the animal isolates, are common in humans. Interestingly, isolates responsible for food poisoning show a CC distribution signature typical of human isolates and strikingly different from animal isolates, suggesting a predominantly human origin."
https://openalex.org/W2035539300,"The polymorphic property of amyloid structures has been focused on as a molecular basis of the presence and propagation of different phenotypes of amyloid diseases, although little is known about the molecular mechanism for expressing diverse structures from only one protein sequence. Here, we have found that, in combination with an enhancing effect of ultrasonication on nucleation, β2-microglobulin, a protein responsible for dialysis-related amyloidosis, generates distinct fibril conformations in a concentration-dependent manner in the presence of 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE). Although the newly formed fibrils all exhibited a similar needle-like morphology with an extensive cross-β core, as suggested by Fourier transform infrared absorption spectra, they differed in thioflavin T intensity, extension kinetics, and tryptophan fluorescence spectra even in the same solvents, representing polymorphic structures.

The polymorphic property of amyloid structures has been focused on as a molecular basis of the presence and propagation of different phenotypes of amyloid diseases, although little is known about the molecular mechanism for expressing diverse structures from only one protein sequence. Here, we have found that, in combination with an enhancing effect of ultrasonication on nucleation, β2-microglobulin, a protein responsible for dialysis-related amyloidosis, generates distinct fibril conformations in a concentration-dependent manner in the presence of 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE). Although the newly formed fibrils all exhibited a similar needle-like morphology with an extensive cross-β core, as suggested by Fourier transform infrared absorption spectra, they differed in thioflavin T intensity, extension kinetics, and tryptophan fluorescence spectra even in the same solvents, representing polymorphic structures.

Amyloid fibrils are supramolecular assemblies of proteins often associated with serious disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, prion disease, Parkinson's disease, and dialysis-related amyloidosis (1Rochet J.C.

The most characteristic feature of amyloid fibrils independent of protein sequences is a cross-β structure where β-strands align perpendicularly to the fibril axis. However, recent experimental studies have revealed that, despite this apparent similarity in morphology, a variety of fibril conformations are formed even from one protein sequence, which leads to differences in pathology and transmission. For yeast prion Sup35, amyloid fibrils formed in vitro with conformational variations induced distinct prion strains that further propagated to the subsequent generations (5Tanaka M. Chien P.

For β-amyloid fibrils responsible for Alzheimer's disease (6Paravastu A.K. Leapman R.D. Yau W.M. Tycko R. Molecular structural basis for polymorphism in Alzheimer's β-amyloid fibrils.Proc. Natl.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 9679-9684Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), amyloid fibrils with distinct conformations showed different neurotoxic effects on living cells. Given these findings, understanding the polymorphic nature of amyloid fibrils is essential to elucidating the pathogenesis and transmission of amyloidoses at a molecular level (8Kodali R. Wetzel R. Polymorphism in the intermediates and products of amyloid assembly.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2007; 17: 48-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In many cases, the structural diversity of amyloid fibrils is manifested as morphological diversity with respect to flexibility in shape, repeat distance of twists, and fibril length and width. Although some of this morphological diversity may emerge simply from differences in the hierarchical assembly of a single type of protofilament (9Anderson M. Bocharova O.V. Makarava N. Breydo L.

For a comprehensive understanding and for regulation of the structure and function of each type of amyloid fibril, elucidation of the interactions inside the polypeptide chains constituting the fibrils is essential. However, unlike the amount of information available regarding the native globular structure, much remains to be elucidated, in particular the key interactions determining the physicochemical properties of amyloid fibrils. The mechanism that accounts for multiple conformations from one unique amino acid sequence needs to be clarified. Here, we address our new finding that multiple forms of amyloid fibrils of β2-microglobulin (β2-m) 2The abbreviations used are: β2-mβ2-microglobulinTFE2,2,2-trifluoroethanolThTthioflavin TANS1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acidGdn-HClguanidine hydrochlorideFTIRFourier transform infrared. are produced on the addition of 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) in a concentration-dependent manner. β2-m, a light chain of the type I major histocompatibility antigen (MHC-1) with 99 amino acid residues, is the main component of the amyloid fibrils deposited in patients with dialysis-related amyloidosis (21Yamamoto S.

Chem. 2011; 286: 2121-2131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We have previously clarified that alcohols, in particular TFE and hexafluoroisopropanol, markedly accelerated the formation of fibrils by a 22-residue fragment of β2-m (K3 peptide) and human islet amyloid polypeptide (23Yamaguchi K.

This acceleration was eminent, especially at concentrations slightly below the alcohol clustering concentration, exhibiting a bell-shaped dependence on the concentration of alcohol as a result of a balancing of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. At higher concentration of alcohol, the weak polarity of the solvent is resistant to fibril formation, alternatively stabilizing α-helical structures with extended intramolecular hydrogen networks in many cases. Curiously, we have found that β2-m amyloid fibrils can be formed even at TFE concentrations above the alcohol clustering concentration if combined with ultrasonication. β2-microglobulin 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol thioflavin T 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid guanidine hydrochloride Fourier transform infrared. Ultrasonication is an effective agitating system with intensive effects on the spontaneous formation of amyloid fibrils with a short lag time of only several hours by reducing the free-energy barrier of nucleating processes (25Ohhashi Y.

Although few β2-m fibrils form under quiescent conditions because of the high energetic barrier, we have clarified that ultrasonication strongly generates β2-m amyloid fibrils without any seeds (25Ohhashi Y.

With the assistance of this effect, we obtained a series of polymorphic fibrils at various concentrations of TFE. Interestingly, the fibrils generated at higher concentration of TFE were more stable. On the basis of the physicochemical properties of the amyloid fibrils obtained, the molecular mechanism underlying the manifestation of this polymorphism will be discussed. Recombinant human β2-m was produced with an Escherichia coli expression system as described previously (28Chiba T. Hagihara Y. Higurashi T. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. Amyloid fibril formation in the context of full-length protein. Effects of proline mutations on the amyloid fibril formation of β2-microglobulin.J. Biol.

The purified β2-m was desalted by dialysis against deionized water and stocked as a lyophilized form for experiments. Concentrations of monomeric β2-m were determined using an absorption coefficient of 19,300 cm−1m−1 at 280 nm (28Chiba T. Hagihara Y. Higurashi T. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y.

To induce the spontaneous formation of β2-m amyloid fibrils without seeds, the ultrasonication system established in our previous study was used (25Ohhashi Y. Kihara M. Naiki H. Goto Y.

Samples of 0.3 mg/ml of β2-m dissolved in 10 mm HCl containing 100 mm NaCl and various concentrations of TFE (0–50%) were placed on a water bath-type ultrasonic transmitter with a temperature controller (ELESTEIN SP070-PG-M, Elekon, Tokyo). The concentration of TFE was represented by v/v. The pH of the solutions with 10 mm HCl in the absence of TFE was 2.0. Although TFE increases the pH because of its hydrophobic effects, we did not try to keep the pH constant because increasing the HCl concentration complicates the experimental conditions. The temperature of the samples was maintained at 37 °C, ultrasonication was applied for 1 min, and then the samples were incubated for 9 min without sonication, a process that was repeated. The samples were ultrasonicated from three directions, i.e. the bottom and two walls of the incubating bath, the ultrasonication pulses from which cross one another at the sample position (25Ohhashi Y.

The frequency and the power of output of the sonication were 17–20 kHz and 350 watts, respectively. At different points of time, a 5-μl aliquot of sample was mixed with 1 ml of 5 μm ThT in 50 mm glycine-NaOH buffer (pH 8.5) at 25 °C, and the fluorescence intensity at 485 nm of this solution was measured with an excitation wavelength of 445 nm to monitor the formation of amyloid fibrils (29Naiki H. Hashimoto N. Suzuki S. Kimura H. Nakakuki K. Gejyo F. Establishment of a kinetic model of dialysis-related amyloid fibril extension in vitro.Amyloid. 1997; 4: 223-232Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The seed-dependent extension reaction was examined according to the method of Naiki et al. (29Naiki H. Hashimoto N. Suzuki S. Kimura H. Nakakuki K. Gejyo F. Establishment of a kinetic model of dialysis-related amyloid fibril extension in vitro.Amyloid. 1997; 4: 223-232Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar) with a slight modification of the solutions. β2-m was dissolved at a concentration of 0.3 mg/ml in a 10 mm HCl solution containing 100 mm NaCl and various concentrations of TFE (0–50%) in the presence of 30 μg/ml of ultrasonicated fibrils as seeds. For the preparation of seeds, fibrils were ultrasonicated using a Microson sonicator (Misonix, Farmingdale, NY) at intensity level 2 and 20 1-s pulses. The extension reaction was carried out at 37 °C without agitation and monitored at different points in time by measuring ThT fluorescence. In the repeated self-seeding experiments, β2-m fibrils produced by ultrasonication (F0) were used as the first seeds (S0) to make F1 fibrils. By repeating the protocol, F2, F3, F4, and F5 fibrils were obtained from the seed-dependent formation of fibrils with S1, S2, S3, and S4 seeds, respectively, as described previously (30Kihara M. Chatani E. Sakai M. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. Seeding-dependent maturation of β2-microglobulin amyloid fibrils at neutral pH.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12012-12018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For S0 seeds, no ultrasonication was applied for fragmentation. The extension reaction in the same solvent was also carried out with fundamentally the same method as that described above, where the TFE concentration was uniformly set to 5%. Amyloid fibrils (0.3 mg/ml) were diluted 20-fold with water and immediately placed on carbon-coated copper grids (400 mesh). The excess solution was removed with filter paper after the sample had stood for 1 min, and the fibrils adsorbed on the grid were negatively stained with a 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate solution. Electron micrographs were acquired using a transmission electron microscope (100CX, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) at 80 kV with a magnification of ×29,000. Far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectra were measured with a J-600 model spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Japan). Samples (0.15 mg/ml) of the monomer or amyloid fibrils of β2-m in 10 mm HCl containing 0.1 m NaCl and various concentrations of TFE were analyzed. For the analysis of amyloid fibrils, samples dissolved in 10 mm HCl containing 5% TFE and 0.1 m NaCl were also prepared and measured. Measurements were performed at 25 °C with a path length of 0.1 cm, and the results were expressed as mean residue ellipticity [θ]. Attenuated total reference FTIR spectra were measured with a J-6100 model spectrometer (Jasco, Japan) with an attenuated total reference option. Fibrils formed by seed-dependent extension reaction were precipitated by centrifugation and resuspended by a small amount of the same solvents to concentrate the fibrils to ∼2 mg/ml, and then 2 μl of them were loaded and dried on the attenuated total reference prism for the measurement. FTIR spectra were then monitored at room temperature with a resolution of 4 cm−1. The spectra were normalized so that the integrated intensity of the amide I band ranging from 1580 to 1750 cm−1 was set to be equal. Tryptophan fluorescence spectra of the fibrillar forms of β2-m were measured using a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Fibrils at 0.05 mg/ml were incubated at 25 °C for 5 min in the thermostated cuvette holder of the spectrophotometer, and fluorescence spectra from 310 to 440 nm were collected with an excitation wavelength of 295 nm. Fibrils at a concentration of 0.05 mg/ml were reacted with 25 μm 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic Acid (ANS) in 10 mm HCl containing 0.1 m NaCl and 5% TFE at 25 °C for 1 h. After the reaction, the fluorescence spectra of ANS within the samples were measured from 400 to 600 nm with an excitation at 350 nm. The stability of β2-m amyloid fibrils in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride (Gdn-HCl) was examined by monitoring the equilibrium depolymerization of β2-m amyloid fibrils on the basis of the change in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. The fibrils were suspended at a concentration of 0.05 mg/ml in 10 mm HCl containing 0.1 m NaCl, 5% TFE, and various concentrations of Gdn-HCl, which were incubated at 25 °C for 1 day before the measurements. Each spectrum was quantified using the center of spectral mass, <ν>, the average energy of fluorescence spectra calculated from the following equation,<ν>=Σνi×Fi/ΣFi(Eq. 1) where νi and Fi are the wavenumber and fluorescence intensity at νi (31Silva J.L. Miles E.W. Weber G. Pressure dissociation and conformational drift of the β dimer of tryptophan synthase.Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5780-5786Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The stability of β2-m amyloid fibrils at neutral pH or low ionic strength was examined by monitoring the time course of depolymerization reactions. Amyloid fibrils of β2-m were first prepared by incubating 1.2 mg/ml of monomeric β2-m in 10 mm HCl containing 0.1 m NaCl, 5% TFE, and 30 μg/ml of seeds at 37 °C. The fibrils were then diluted 6-fold with a 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl to raise the pH to 7.0 or 24-fold with a 10 mm HCl solution to decrease the NaCl concentration to 4.2 mm. The reactions were monitored by measuring ThT fluorescence at different points of time. First we examined the effects of TFE on the formation of β2-m amyloid fibrils by monitoring the reaction at concentrations of TFE from 0 to 50%. β2-m forms amyloid fibrils from an acid-unfolded state at low pH in vitro, which we adopted as standard conditions. In a 10 mm HCl solution containing 0.1 m NaCl, standard conditions in this study, monomeric β2-m was acid-unfolded, showing a far-UV CD spectrum with a minimum at 205 nm (Fig. 1A, inset). The addition of TFE induced the formation of an α-helical structure with a minimum at 208 nm and a shoulder at 222 nm and the structural transition saturated at 30% TFE and above in a similar fashion to that observed in 20 mm HCl (32Hirota-Nakaoka N. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. Dissolution of β2-microglobulin amyloid fibrils by dimethylsulfoxide.J. Biochem. 2003; 134: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A, inset). These β2-m monomers were then placed in a thermoregulated water bath at 37 °C and ultrasonicated repeatedly for 1 min every 10 min to enhance fibrillation. Under the standard conditions without TFE, a rapid increase in ThT fluorescence was observed after a lag time of about 4 h, as observed previously (Fig. 1A) (25Ohhashi Y. Kihara M. Naiki H. Goto Y.

Biol. 2011; 412: 568-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). An unambiguous increase in ThT fluorescence was also observed under all of the conditions in the presence of 10–50% TFE, suggesting that the formation of amyloid fibrils occurs even in the presence of relatively high concentrations of TFE, although more time is required (Fig. 1A). The ultrasonication-induced fibrillation reactions showed fairly good reproducibility in terms of the overall shape of the kinetics and the final ThT intensity under all conditions at different concentrations of TFE, although some fluctuations were observed in the presence of 20% TFE. The final value for fluorescence intensity was generally smaller in the presence of TFE than in its absence. The length of the lag phase increased significantly as the concentration of TFE increased, and growth after the lag phase also seemed to decelerate significantly in the presence of TFE, especially at 40 and 50% TFE. The control reaction without applying ultrasonication pulses did not exhibit any increase in ThT fluorescence for all samples within the experimental period (see supplemental Fig. S1). To verify the formation of amyloid fibrils at different concentrations of TFE, we analyzed the ability to self-propagate, a characteristic feature of amyloid fibrils, by monitoring seed-dependent extension reactions with the sonication-generated fibrils as seeds. It should be noted that the seed-dependent extension reactions hereafter were carried out without ultrasonication. When sonication-generated amyloid fibrils were added to a newly prepared monomeric β2-m solution containing the same TFE concentration as that present during the nucleation, ThT fluorescence increased dramatically in an exponential manner without a lag phase for all fibrils (Fig. 1B), from which we concluded that amyloid fibrils were formed at all concentrations of TFE. Repeated cycles of self-seeding produced second, third, and fourth (which was analyzed only at 10%) generations of fibrils, with some acceleration of the extension reaction observed in the second cycle at 30 and 40% but no change observed at 0%, 10%, 20%, or 50% (Fig. 1B).

https://openalex.org/W2162392249,"It is critical to assess the effectiveness of the tools used to protect endangered species. The main tools enabled under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) to promote species recovery are funding, recovery plan development and critical habitat designation. Earlier studies sometimes found that statistically significant effects of these tools could be detected, but they have not answered the question of whether the effects were large enough to be biologically meaningful. Here, we ask: how much does the recovery status of ESA-listed species improve with the application of these tools? We used species' staus reports to Congress from 1988 to 2006 to quantify two measures of recovery for 1179 species. We related these to the amount of federal funding, years with a recovery plan, years with critical habitat designation, the amount of peer-reviewed scientific information, and time listed. We found that change in recovery status of listed species was, at best, only very weakly related to any of these tools. Recovery was positively related to the number of years listed, years with a recovery plan, and funding, however, these tools combined explain <13% of the variation in recovery status among species. Earlier studies that reported significant effects of these tools did not focus on effect sizes; however, they are in fact similarly small. One must conclude either that these tools are not very effective in promoting species' recovery, or (as we suspect) that species recovery data are so poor that it is impossible to tell whether the tools are effective or not. It is critically important to assess the effectiveness of tools used to promote species recovery; it is therefore also critically important to obtain population status data that are adequate to that task."
https://openalex.org/W1984494687,"To evaluate the relevance of C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) expression and tumor development, we compared melanoma growth in CCR5 knockout (CCR5(-/-)) mice and wild type (CCR5(+/+)) mice. CCR5(-/-) mice showed reduced tumor volume, tumor weight, and increased survival rate when compared to CCR5(+/+) mice. We investigated the activation of NF-κB since it is an implicated transcription factor in the regulation of genes involving cell growth, apoptosis, and tumor growth. Significant inhibition of DNA binding activity of NF-κB, and translocation of p50 and p65 into the nucleus through the inhibition of phosphorylation of IκB was found in the melanoma tissues of CCR5(-/-) mice compared to melanoma tissues of CCR5(+/+) mice. NF-κB target apoptotic protein expression, such as cleaved caspase-3, cleaved PARP, and Bax, was elevated, whereas the survival protein expression levels, such as Bcl-2, C-IAP1, was decreased in the melanoma tissues of CCR5(-/-) mice. Interestingly, we found that the level of IL-1Ra, a tumor growth suppressive cytokine, was significantly elevated in tumor tissue and spleen of CCR5(-/-) mice compared to the level in CCR5(+/+) mice. Moreover, infiltration of CD8(+) cytotoxic T cell and CD57(+) natural killer cells was significantly increased in melanoma tumor and spleen tissue of CCR5(-/-) mice compared to that of CCR5(+/+) mice. Therefore, these results showed that CCR5 deficiency caused apoptotic cell death of melanoma through inhibition of NF-κB and upregulation of IL-1Ra."
https://openalex.org/W2088608383,"Invasive predators can impose strong selection pressure on species that evolved in their absence and drive species to extinction. Interactions between coexisting predators may be particularly strong, as larger predators frequently kill smaller predators and suppress their abundances. Until 3500 years ago the marsupial thylacine was Australia's largest predator. It became extinct from the mainland soon after the arrival of a morphologically convergent placental predator, the dingo, but persisted in the absence of dingoes on the island of Tasmania until the 20th century. As Tasmanian thylacines were larger than dingoes, it has been argued that dingoes were unlikely to have caused the extinction of mainland thylacines because larger predators are rarely killed by smaller predators. By comparing Holocene specimens from the same regions of mainland Australia, we show that dingoes were similarly sized to male thylacines but considerably larger than female thylacines. Female thylacines would have been vulnerable to killing by dingoes. Such killing could have depressed the reproductive output of thylacine populations. Our results support the hypothesis that direct killing by larger dingoes drove thylacines to extinction on mainland Australia. However, attributing the extinction of the thylacine to just one cause is problematic because the arrival of dingoes coincided with another the potential extinction driver, the intensification of the human economy."
https://openalex.org/W2066255121,"Purpose To report visual outcomes and risk factors for poor outcomes of cataract surgery in three Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA) areas of Andhra Pradesh, India. Methods and Results Using validated Rapid Assessment of Avoidable Blindness (RAAB) methodology, a population based cross-sectional study, was conducted in three ITDA areas. A two-stage sampling procedure was used to select 7281 participants aged 50 years and above. Vision assessment using a tumbling E chart and standard ocular examinations were completed. Visual outcomes and risk factors for poor outcomes were assessed among subjects undergoing cataract surgery (1548 eyes of 1124 subjects). Mean age at surgery was 67±8 years; Among the operated eyes, presenting visual acuity (PVA) and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) worse than 6/18 was seen in 492 (31.8%; 95% CI, 29.5–34.2%) and 298 eyes (19.3%; 95% CI, 17.3–21.3%), respectively. Similarly, PVA and BCVA worse than 6/60 was seen in 219 (14.1%; 95% CI, 12.4–16%) and 147 eyes (9.5%; 95% CI, 8.1–11.1%), respectively. When either eye was taken into consideration, the PVA and BCVA worse than 6/18 was seen in 323 (20.1%; 95% CI, 18.9–23%) and 144 subjects (9.3%; 95% CI, 7.9–10.9%), respectively. PVA and BCVA worse than 6/60 was seen in 74 (4.8%; 95% CI, 3.8–6%) and 49 subjects (3.2%; 95% CI, 2.4–4.2%), respectively. Posterior capsular opacification was seen in 51 of 1316 pseudophakic eyes (3.9%; 95% CI, 2.9–5.1%). In multivariable analysis among pseudophakic subjects with PVA worse than 6/18, increasing age (p = 0.002) and undergoing free surgery (p = 0.05) were independent risk factors. Undergoing surgery before 2005 (p = 0.05) and being illiterate (p = 0.05) were independent risk factors for BCVA worse than 6/18. Conclusions There are changing trends with improved outcomes in cataract surgery among these tribal populations of India. However, post-operative refractive error correction remains an issue, especially for those undergoing free surgeries."
https://openalex.org/W2029425974,"The long-term control of tuberculosis (TB) will require the development of more effective anti-TB vaccines, as the only licensed vaccine, Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG), has limited protective efficacy against infectious pulmonary TB. Subunit vaccines have an improved safety profile over live, attenuated vaccines, such as BCG, and may be used in immuno-compromised individuals. MPT83 (Rv2873) is a secreted mycobacterial lipoprotein expressed on the surface of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In this study, we examined whether recombinant MPT83 is recognized during human and murine M. tuberculosis infection. We assessed the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of MPT83 as a protein vaccine, with monophosphyl lipid A (MPLA) in dimethyl-dioctadecyl ammonium bromide (DDA) as adjuvant, or as a DNA vaccine in C57BL/6 mice and mapped the T cell epitopes with peptide scanning. We demonstrated that rMPT83 was recognised by strong proliferative and Interferon (IFN)-γ-secreting T cell responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with active TB, but not from healthy, tuberculin skin test-negative control subjects. MPT83 also stimulated strong IFN-γ T cell responses during experimental murine M. tuberculosis infection. Immunization with either rMPT83 in MPLA/DDA or DNA-MPT83 stimulated antigen-specific T cell responses, and we identified MPT83127–135 (PTNAAFDKL) as the dominant H-2b-restricted CD8+ T cell epitope within MPT83. Further, immunization of C57BL/6 mice with rMPT83/MPLA/DDA or DNA-MPT83 stimulated significant levels of protection in the lungs and spleens against aerosol challenge with M. tuberculosis. Interestingly, immunization with rMPT83 in MPLA/DDA primed for stronger IFN-γ T cell responses to the whole protein following challenge, while DNA-MPT83 primed for stronger CD8+ T cell responses to MPT83127–135. Therefore MPT83 is a protective T cell antigen commonly recognized during human M. tuberculosis infection and should be considered for inclusion in future TB subunit vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2050760228,"Collodaria are the only group of Radiolaria that has a colonial lifestyle. This group is potentially the most important plankton in the oligotrophic ocean because of its large biomass and the high primary productivity associated with the numerous symbionts inside a cell or colony. The evolution of Collodaria could thus be related to the changes in paleo-productivity that have affected organic carbon fixation in the oligotrophic ocean. However, the fossil record of Collodaria is insufficient to trace their abundance through geological time, because most collodarians do not have silicified shells. Recently, molecular phylogeny based on nuclear small sub-unit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA) confirmed Collodaria to be one of five orders of Radiolaria, though the relationship among collodarians is still unresolved because of inadequate taxonomic sampling. Our phylogenetic analysis has revealed four novel collodarian sequences, on the basis of which collodarians can be divided into four clades that correspond to taxonomic grouping at the family level: Thalassicollidae, Collozoidae, Collosphaeridae, and Collophidae. Comparison of the results of our phylogenetic analyses with the morphological characteristics of each collodarian family suggests that the first ancestral collodarians had a solitary lifestyle and left no silica deposits. The timing of events estimated from molecular divergence calculations indicates that naked collodarian lineages first appeared around 45.6 million years (Ma) ago, coincident with the diversification of diatoms in the pelagic oceans. Colonial collodarians appeared after the formation of the present ocean circulation system and the development of oligotrophic conditions in the equatorial Pacific (ca. 33.4 Ma ago). The divergence of colonial collodarians probably caused a shift in the efficiency of primary production during this period."
https://openalex.org/W1967322603,"Group A Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS) is an important human pathogen that frequently causes pharyngitis. GAS organisms can adhere to and invade pharyngeal epithelial cells, which are overlaid by salivary components. However, the role of salivary components in GAS adhesion to pharyngeal cells has not been reported precisely. We collected human saliva and purified various salivary components, including proline-rich protein (PRP), statherin, and amylase, and performed invasion assays. The GAS-HEp-2 association ratio (invasion/adhesion ratio) and invasion ratio of GAS were increased significantly with whole human saliva and PRP, while the anti-PRP antibody inhibited the latter. GAS strain NY-5, which lacks M and F proteins on the cell surface, was promoted to cohere with HEp-2 cells by whole human saliva and PRP. The 28-kDa protein of GAS bound to PRP and was identified as GrpE, a chaperone protein, whereas the N-terminal of GrpE was found to bind to PRP. A GrpE-deficient mutant of GAS strain B514Sm, TR-45, exhibited a reduced ability to adhere to and invade HEp-2 cells. Microscopic observations showed the GrpE was mainly expressed on the surface of the cell division site of GAS. Furthermore, GrpE-deficient mutants of GAS and Streptococcus pneumoniae showed an elongated morphology as compared with the wild type. Taken together, this is the first study to show an interaction between salivary PRP and GAS GrpE, which plays an important role in GAS infection on the pharynx, whereas the expression of GrpE on the surface of GAS helps to maintain morphology."
https://openalex.org/W1972465086,"Health risks associated with sewage-contaminated recreational waters are of important public health concern. Reliable water monitoring systems are therefore crucial. Current recreational water quality criteria rely predominantly on the enumeration of bacterial indicators, while potentially dangerous viral pathogens often remain undetected. Human enteric viruses have been proposed as alternative indicators; however, their detection is often hindered by low viral concentrations present in the environment. Reported here are novel and effective laboratory protocols for viral concentration and highly sensitive and optimized RT-PCR for the efficient detection of enteroviruses, an important enteric virus subset, in Hawaiian environmental waters. Eighteen published enterovirus primer pairs were comparatively evaluated for detection sensitivity. The primer set exhibiting the lowest detection limit under optimized conditions, EQ-1/EQ-2, was validated in a field survey of 22 recreational bodies of water located around the island of Oahu, Hawaii. Eleven sites tested positive for enterovirus, indicating fecal contamination at these locations. As an additional means of viral concentration, shellfish were collected from 9 sample sites and subjected to dissection, RNA extraction, and subsequent RT-PCR. Shellfish tissue from 6 of 9 sites tested positive for enterovirus. The techniques implemented here are valuable resources to aid accurate reflection of microbial contamination in Hawaii's environmental waters."
https://openalex.org/W1995333377,"Thrombin, a G protein-coupled receptor agonist, induced a biphasic expression of cyclin D1 in primary vascular smooth muscle cells. Although both phases of cyclin D1 expression require binding of the newly identified cooperative complex, NFATc1·STAT-3, to its promoter, the second phase, which is more robust, depends on NFATc1-mediated recruitment of p300 onto the complex and the subsequent acetylation of STAT-3. In addition, STAT-3 is tyrosine-phosphorylated in a biphasic manner, and the late phase requires NFATc1-mediated p300-dependent acetylation. Furthermore, interference with acetylation of STAT-3 by overexpression of acetylation null STAT-3 mutant led to the loss of the late phase of cyclin D1 expression. EMSA analysis and reporter gene assays revealed that NFATc1·STAT-3 complex binding to the cyclin D1 promoter led to an enhanceosome formation and facilitated cyclin D1 expression. In the early phase of its expression, cyclin D1 is localized mostly in the cytoplasm and influenced cell migration. However, during the late and robust phase of its expression, cyclin D1 is translocated to the nucleus and directed cell proliferation. Together, these results demonstrate for the first time that the dual function of cyclin D1 in cell migration and proliferation is temperospatially separated by its biphasic expression, which is mediated by cooperative interactions between NFATc1 and STAT-3."
https://openalex.org/W2006334562,"Despite advances in radiation delivery protocols, exposure of normal tissues during the course of radiation therapy remains a limiting factor of cancer treatment. If the canonical TGF-β/Smad pathway has been extensively studied and implicated in the development of radiation damage in various organs, the precise modalities of its activation following radiation exposure remain elusive. In the present study, we hypothesized that TGF-β1 signaling and target genes expression may depend on radiation-induced modifications in Smad transcriptional co-repressors/inhibitors expressions (TGIF1, SnoN, Ski and Smad7). In endothelial cells (HUVECs) and in a model of experimental radiation enteropathy in mice, radiation exposure increases expression of TGF-β/Smad pathway and of its target gene PAI-1, together with the overexpression of Smad co-repressor TGIF1. In mice, TGIF1 deficiency is not associated with changes in the expression of radiation-induced TGF-β pathway-related transcripts following localized small intestinal irradiation. In HUVECs, TGIF1 overexpression or silencing has no influence either on the radiation-induced Smad activation or the Smad3-dependent PAI-1 overexpression. However, TGIF1 genetic deficiency sensitizes mice to radiation-induced intestinal damage after total body or localized small intestinal radiation exposure, demonstrating that TGIF1 plays a role in radiation-induced intestinal injury. In conclusion, the TGF-β/Smad co-repressor TGIF1 plays a role in radiation-induced normal tissue damage by a Smad-independent mechanism."

Chemical modifications to nucleotides and histone proteins are added, removed and recognized by multi-functional molecular complexes. Here I define a new computational model, in which chromatin modifications are information units that can be written onto a one-dimensional string of nucleosomes, analogous to the symbols written onto cells of a Turing machine tape, and chromatin-modifying complexes are modeled as read-write rules that operate on a finite set of adjacent nucleosomes. I illustrate the use of this “chromatin computer” to solve an instance of the Hamiltonian path problem. I prove that chromatin computers are computationally universal – and therefore more powerful than the logic circuits often used to model transcription factor control of gene expression. Features of biological chromatin provide a rich instruction set for efficient computation of nontrivial algorithms in biological time scales. Modeling chromatin as a computer shifts how we think about chromatin function, suggests new approaches to medical intervention, and lays the groundwork for the engineering of a new class of biological computing machines."

The aims of this study were to examine Symbiodinium diversity and distribution associated with scleractinian corals in five atolls of the Chagos Archipelago, spread over 10,000 km(2). Symbiodinium clade diversity in 262 samples of seven common coral species, Acropora muricata, Isopora palifera, Pocillopora damicornis, P. verrucosa, P. eydouxi, Seriatopora hystrix, and Stylophora pistillata were determined using PCR-SSCP of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1), PCR-DDGE of ITS2, and phylogenetic analyses. The results indicated that Symbiodinium in clade C were the dominant symbiont group in the seven coral species. Our analysis revealed types of Symbiodinium clade C specific to coral species. Types C1 and C3 (with C3z and C3i variants) were dominant in Acroporidae and C1 and C1c were the dominant types in Pocilloporidae. We also found 2 novel ITS2 types in S. hystrix and 1 novel ITS2 type of Symbiodinium in A. muricata. Some colonies of A. muricata and I. palifera were also associated with Symbiodinium A1. These results suggest that corals in the Chagos Archipelago host different assemblages of Symbiodinium types then their conspecifics from other locations in the Indian Ocean; and that future research will show whether these patterns in Symbiodinium genotypes may be due to local adaptation to specific conditions in the Chagos."
https://openalex.org/W2043880065,"The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is among the world's largest investors in biomedical research, with a mandate to: ""…lengthen life, and reduce the burdens of illness and disability."" Its funding decisions have been criticized as insufficiently focused on disease burden. We hypothesize that modern portfolio theory can create a closer link between basic research and outcome, and offer insight into basic-science related improvements in public health. We propose portfolio theory as a systematic framework for making biomedical funding allocation decisions-one that is directly tied to the risk/reward trade-off of burden-of-disease outcomes.Using data from 1965 to 2007, we provide estimates of the NIH ""efficient frontier"", the set of funding allocations across 7 groups of disease-oriented NIH institutes that yield the greatest expected return on investment for a given level of risk, where return on investment is measured by subsequent impact on U.S. years of life lost (YLL). The results suggest that NIH may be actively managing its research risk, given that the volatility of its current allocation is 17% less than that of an equal-allocation portfolio with similar expected returns. The estimated efficient frontier suggests that further improvements in expected return (89% to 119% vs. current) or reduction in risk (22% to 35% vs. current) are available holding risk or expected return, respectively, constant, and that 28% to 89% greater decrease in average years-of-life-lost per unit risk may be achievable. However, these results also reflect the imprecision of YLL as a measure of disease burden, the noisy statistical link between basic research and YLL, and other known limitations of portfolio theory itself.Our analysis is intended to serve as a proof-of-concept and starting point for applying quantitative methods to allocating biomedical research funding that are objective, systematic, transparent, repeatable, and expressly designed to reduce the burden of disease. By approaching funding decisions in a more analytical fashion, it may be possible to improve their ultimate outcomes while reducing unintended consequences."

The association between AMD and asthma has been debated in previous studies. The authors investigated the relationship between AMD and asthma systemically.The epidemiological study showed that asthma was related to choroidal neovascularization (CNV) subtype (OR = 1.721, P = 0.023). However, the meta-analysis showed there was no association between AMD and asthma. In an animal model, we found more fluoresce in leakage of CNV lesions by FA analysis and more angiogenesis by histological analysis in rats with asthma. Western blot demonstrated an elevated level of C3α-chain, C3α'-chain and VEGF. After compstatin was intravitreally injected, CNV leakage decreased according to FA analysis, with the level of C3 and VEGF protein decreasing at the same time.This study first investigated the relationship between AMD and asthma systematically, and it was found that asthma could be a risk factor for the development of AMD. The study may provide a better understanding of the disease, which may advance the potential for screening asthma patients in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2024733541,"Background High levels of defaulting from treatment challenge tuberculosis control in many African cities. We assessed defaulting from tuberculosis treatment in an African urban setting. Methods An observational study among adult patients with smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis receiving treatment at urban primary care clinics in Kampala, Uganda. Defaulting was defined as having missed two consecutive monthly clinic visits while not being reported to have died or continued treatment elsewhere. Defaulting patients were actively followed-up and interviewed. We assessed proportions of patients abandoning treatment with and without the information obtained through active follow-up and we examined associated factors through multivariable logistic regression. Results Between April 2007 and April 2008, 270 adults aged ≥15 years were included; 54 patients (20%) were recorded as treatment defaulters. On active follow-up vital status was established of 28/54 (52%) patients. Of these, 19 (68%) had completely stopped treatment, one (4%) had died and eight (29%) had continued treatment elsewhere. Extrapolating this to all defaulters meant that 14% rather than 20% of all patients had truly abandoned treatment. Daily consumption of alcohol, recorded at the start of treatment, predicted defaulting (adjusted odds ratio [ORadj] 4.4, 95%CI 1.8–13.5), as did change of residence during treatment (ORadj 8.7, 95%CI 1.8–41.5); 32% of patients abandoning treatment had changed residence. Conclusions A high proportion of tuberculosis patients in primary care clinics in Kampala abandon treatment. Assessing change of residence during scheduled clinic appointments may serve as an early warning signal that the patient may default and needs adherence counseling."
https://openalex.org/W2034772940,"Although Lrp5 is known to be an important contributor to the mechanisms regulating bone mass, its precise role remains unclear. The aim of this study was to establish whether mutations in Lrp5 are associated with differences in the growth and/or apoptosis of osteoblast-like cells and their proliferative response to mechanical strain in vitro. Primary osteoblast-like cells were derived from cortical bone of adult mice lacking functional Lrp5 (Lrp5(-/-)), those heterozygous for the human G171V High Bone Mass (HBM) mutation (LRP5(G171V)) and their WT littermates (WT(Lrp5), WT(HBM)). Osteoblast proliferation over time was significantly higher in cultures of cells from LRP5(G171V) mice compared to their WT(HBM) littermates, and lower in Lrp5(-/-) cells. Cells from female LRP5(G171V) mice grew more rapidly than those from males, whereas cells from female Lrp5(-/-) mice grew more slowly than those from males. Apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal was significantly higher in cultures from Lrp5(-/-) mice than in those from WT(HBM) or LRP5(G171V) mice. Exposure to a single short period of dynamic mechanical strain was associated with a significant increase in cell number but this response was unaffected by genotype which also did not change the 'threshold' at which cells responded to strain. In conclusion, the data presented here suggest that Lrp5 loss and gain of function mutations result in cell-autonomous alterations in osteoblast proliferation and apoptosis but do not alter the proliferative response of osteoblasts to mechanical strain in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2039113377,"The localization of estrogen receptor (ER)β in mitochondria suggests ERβ-dependent regulation of genes, which is poorly understood. Here, we analyzed the ERβ interacting mitochondrial as well as nuclear proteins in mouse brain using pull-down assay and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectroscopy (MALDI-MS). In the case of mitochondria, ERβ interacted with six proteins of 35-152 kDa, its transactivation domain (TAD) interacted with four proteins of 37-172 kDa, and ligand binding domain (LBD) interacted with six proteins of 37-161 kDa. On the other hand, in nuclei, ERβ interacted with seven proteins of 30-203 kDa, TAD with ten proteins of 31-160 kDa, and LBD with fourteen proteins of 42-179 kDa. For further identification, these proteins were cleaved by trypsin into peptides and analyzed by MALDI-MS using mascot search engine, immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and far-Western blotting. To find the consensus binding motifs in interacting proteins, their unique tryptic peptides were analyzed by the motif scan software. All the interacting proteins were found to contain casein kinase (CK) 2, phosphokinase (PK)C phosphorylation, and N-myristoylation sites. These were further confirmed by peptide pull-down assays using specific mutations in the interacting sites. Thus, the present findings provide evidence for the interaction of ERβ with specific mitochondrial and nuclear proteins through consensus CK2, PKC phosphorylation, and N-myristoylation sites, and may represent an essential step toward designing selective ER modulators for regulating estrogen-mediated signaling."

Methods Pregnant women (≥28 weeks gestation) in Vellore, South India were approached for enrollment from April 2009 to January 2010. After informed consent was obtained, women completed a socio-demographic, prenatal, and sexual history questionnaire. Endocervical samples collected at delivery were examined for CT by a rapid enzyme test and nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT). Neonatal nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swabs were collected for NAAT testing. Results Overall, 1198 women were enrolled and 799 (67%) endocervical samples were collected at birth. Analyses were completed on 784 participants with available rapid and NAAT results. The mean age of women was 25.8 years (range 18–39 yrs) and 22% (95% CI: 19.7–24.4%) were primigravida. All women enrolled were married; one reported >one sexual partner; and six reported prior STI. We found 71 positive rapid CT tests and 1/784 (0.1%; 95% CI: 0–0.38%) true positive CT infection using NAAT. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the largest study on CT prevalence amongst healthy pregnant mothers in southern India, and it documents a very low prevalence with NAAT. Many false positive results were noted using the rapid test. These data suggest that universal CT screening is not indicated in this population."
https://openalex.org/W2024866851,"BAG-1 is an anti-apoptotic protein that interacts with a variety of cellular molecules to inhibit apoptosis. The mechanisms by which BAG-1 interacts with other proteins to inhibit apoptosis have been extensively explored. However, it is currently unknown how BAG-1 expression is regulated at the molecular level, especially in cancer cells. Here we reported to clone a novel down-regulated BAG-1 expression gene named FLJ20420 using hBAG-1 promoter as a probe to screen Human Hela 5′ cDNA library by Southernwestern blot. The FLJ20420 gene encodes a ∼26-kDa protein that is localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. We proved that FLJ20420 protein can specially bind hBAG-1 promoter region by EMSA in vivo and ChIP assay in vivo. Northern blot analysis revealed a low level of FLJ20420 transcriptional expression in normal human tissues (i.e., brain, placenta, lung, liver, kidney, pancreas and cervix), except for heart and skeletal muscles, which showed higher levels. Furthermore, enhanced FLJ20420 expression was observed in tumor cell lines (i.e., MDA468, BT-20, MCF-7, C33A, HeLa and Caski). Knockdown of endogenous FLJ20420 expression significantly increased BAG-1 expression in A549 and L9981 cells, and also significantly enhanced their sensitivity to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. A microarray assay of the FLJ20420 siRNA –transfectants showed altered expression of 505 known genes, including 272 upregulated and 233 downregulated genes. Finally, our gene array studies in lung cancer tissue samples revealed a significant increase in FLJ20420 expression in primary lung cancer relative to the paired normal lung tissue controls (p = 0.0006). The increased expression of FLJ20420 corresponded to a significant decrease in BAG-1 protein expression in the primary lung cancers, relative to the paired normal lung tissue controls (p = 0.0001). Taken together, our experiments suggest that FLJ20420 functions as a down-regulator of BAG-1 expression. Its abnormal expression may be involved in the oncogenesis of human malignancies such as lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1984573774,"Some anti-cancer drugs, including those that alter microtubule dynamics target mitotic cells and induce apoptosis in some cell types. However, such drugs elicit protective responses in other cell types allowing cells to escape from drug-induced mitotic inhibition. Cells with a faulty protective mechanism undergo defective mitosis, leading to genome instability. Brd4 is a double bromodomain protein that remains on chromosomes during mitosis. However, Brd4 is released from mitotic chromosomes when cells are exposed to anti-mitotic drugs including nocodazole. Neither the mechanisms, nor the biological significance of drug-induced Brd4 release has been fully understood. We found that deletion of the internal C-terminal region abolished nocodazole induced Brd4 release from mouse P19 cells. Furthermore, cells expressing truncated Brd4, unable to dissociate from chromosomes were blocked from mitotic progression and failed to complete cell division. We also found that pharmacological and peptide inhibitors of the c-jun-N-terminal kinases (JNK) pathway, but not inhibitors of other MAP kinases, prevented release of Brd4 from chromosomes. The JNK inhibitor that blocked Brd4 release also blocked mitotic progression. Further supporting the role of JNK in Brd4 release, JNK2–/– embryonic fibroblasts were defective in Brd4 release and sustained greater inhibition of cell growth after nocodazole treatment. In sum, activation of JNK pathway triggers release of Brd4 from chromosomes upon nocodazole treatment, which mediates a protective response designed to minimize drug-induced mitotic stress."

A disease-causing mutation inherited from a common founder may thus be detected by searching for a common haplotype signature in a sample population of patients. We present here FounderTracker, a computational method for the genome-wide detection of founder mutations in cancer using dense tumor SNP profiles. Our method is based on two assumptions. First, the wild-type allele frequently undergoes loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the tumors of germline mutation carriers. Second, the overlap between the ancestral chromosome fragments inherited from a common founder will define a minimal haplotype conserved in each patient carrying the founder mutation. Our approach thus relies on the detection of haplotypes with significant identity by descent (IBD) sharing within recurrent regions of LOH to highlight genomic loci likely to harbor a founder mutation. We validated this approach by analyzing two real cancer data sets in which we successfully identified founder mutations of well-characterized tumor suppressor genes. We then used simulated data to evaluate the ability of our method to detect IBD tracts as a function of their size and frequency. We show that FounderTracker can detect haplotypes of low prevalence with high power and specificity, significantly outperforming existing methods. FounderTracker is thus a powerful tool for discovering unknown founder mutations that may explain part of the ""missing"" heritability in cancer. This method is freely available and can be used online at the FounderTracker website."
https://openalex.org/W1976697119,"DNA damages, as well as mutations, increase with age. It is believed that these result from increased genotoxic stress and decreased capacity for DNA repair. The two causes are not independent, DNA damage can, for example, through mutations, compromise the capacity for DNA repair, which in turn increases the amount of unrepaired DNA damage. Despite this vicious circle, we ask, can cells maintain a high DNA repair capacity for some time or is repair capacity bound to continuously decline with age? We here present a simple mathematical model for ageing in multicellular systems where cells subjected to DNA damage can undergo full repair, go apoptotic, or accumulate mutations thus reducing DNA repair capacity. Our model predicts that at the tissue level repair rate does not continuously decline with age, but instead has a characteristic extended period of high and non-declining DNA repair capacity, followed by a rapid decline. Furthermore, the time of high functionality increases, and consequently slows down the ageing process, if the DNA repair mechanism itself is vulnerable to DNA damages. Although counterintuitive at first glance, a fragile repair mechanism allows for a faster removal of compromised cells, thus freeing the space for healthy peers. This finding might be a first step toward understanding why a mutation in single DNA repair protein (e.g. Wrn or Blm) is not buffered by other repair proteins and therefore, leads to severe ageing disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2130784395,"Transgenes encoding for insecticidal crystal (Cry) proteins from the soil-dwelling bacterium Bacillus Thuringiensis have been widely introduced into Genetically Modified (GM) crops to confer protection against insect pests. Concern that these transgenes may also harm beneficial or otherwise valued insects (so-called Non Target Organisms, NTOs) represents a major element of the Environmental Risk Assessments (ERAs) used by all countries prior to commercial release. Compiling a comprehensive list of potentially susceptible NTOs is therefore a necessary part of an ERA for any Cry toxin-containing GM crop. In partly-characterised and biodiverse countries, NTO identification is slowed by the need for taxonomic expertise and time to enable morphological identifications. This limitation represents a potentially serious barrier to timely adoption of GM technology in some developing countries. We consider Bt Cry1A cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) in Nigeria as an exemplar to demonstrate how COI barcoding can provide a simple and cost-effective means of addressing this problem. Over a period of eight weeks, we collected 163 insects from cowpea flowers across the agroecological and geographic range of the crop in Nigeria. These individuals included 32 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) spanning four Orders and that could mostly be assigned to genus or species level. They included 12 Lepidopterans and two Coleopterans (both potentially sensitive to different groups of Cry proteins). Thus, barcode-assisted diagnoses were highly harmonised across groups (typically to genus or species level) and so were insensitive to expertise or knowledge gaps. Decisively, the entire study was completed within four months at a cost of less than 10,000 US$. The broader implications of the findings for food security and the capacity for safe adoption of GM technology are briefly explored."
https://openalex.org/W2020102486,"Belly-size ratings or belly scores are frequently used in carnivore research as a method of rating whether and how much an animal has eaten. This method provides only a rough ordinal measure of fullness and does not quantify the amount of food an animal has consumed. Here we present a method for estimating the amount of meat consumed by individual African wild dogs Lycaon pictus. We fed 0.5 kg pieces of meat to wild dogs being temporarily held in enclosures and measured the corresponding change in belly size using lateral side photographs taken perpendicular to the animal. The ratio of belly depth to body length was positively related to the mass of meat consumed and provided a useful estimate of the consumption. Similar relationships could be calculated to determine amounts consumed by other carnivores, thus providing a useful tool in the study of feeding behaviour."
