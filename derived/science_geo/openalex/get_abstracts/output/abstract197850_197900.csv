He examined collagen samples from two broad sources, namely, mammalian and teleost connective tissue, and his findings demonstrated a direct relationship between the hydroxyproline content of a collagen and its shrinkage temperature. He considers that hydroxyproline will form interchain hydrogen bonds between its hydroxyl group and the carbonyl oxygen of an adjacent peptide grouping and may also be involved in the formation of ester links between polypeptide chains, thus playing a very important part in determining the stability and general reactivity of a collagen fibre. The evidence for assigning such a function to the hydroxyproline residue has, however, been derived from a study of many animal species. Furthermore, there is a growing body of evidence2–4 which indicates that the reactivity of a collagen fibre depends on age and it still remains to be established whether variations in the hydroxyproline content can account for the differing degrees of reactivity with age, shown by collagen obtained from a single animal species."

Sugawara1 has shown that about half this is iodide, while the remainder is an oxidized form, which he attributes to iodate. We find that various observations are more readily explained on the hypothesis that the oxidized form is principally hypoiodous acid."

These growths collect silt and humus and, on becoming detached from the stream bed, release large amounts of organic material into suspension."
https://openalex.org/W2002774493,"IN studying the inhibition of partially purified mammalian β-glucuronidase by heavy metal ions, we have found that the cupric ion is a moderate inhibitor, and is potentiated by cysteine. This action of cysteine appears to be limited by the formation of cystine, since the latter reverses inhibition by copper and by other metals. Sodium bisulphite and ascorbic acid were therefore examined as alternative reducing agents. Neither of these agents by itself had any effect on the enzyme activity, but they had an identical action in potentiating inhibition by the cupric ion, as shown in Fig. 1; this process was instantaneous, there being no increase in inhibition on prolonged incubation with the substrate. In the presence of ascorbic acid or bisulphite, the inhibitory power of Cu++ was of the same order as that of Ag+ or Hg++, neither of which was potentiated by the reducing agents. A feasible explanation of these results is that copper inhibition is due to the cuprous, and not the cupric, ion."

https://openalex.org/W2017963826,"As the reproductive organs of the female chicken develop there is an atrophy of the right gonad and the right oviduct which begins during early embryogeny. Persistency of these structures on the left side results in only one functional ovary and oviduct. A suspicion that bilateral oviducts were present in an inbred strain of Rhode Island Reds resulted when hens were being artificially inseminated. As each hen was prepared for receiving semen, manual pressure was exerted so that the vagina would be extruded. When this practice was followed with line SD-11 hens (from the Rhode Island Red inbred line) it was frequently observed that apparently two vaginas were appearing at the cloaca. Subsequent autopsies have verified that at least a portion of the right oviduct has persisted in some of the SD-11 hens."

https://openalex.org/W2055871033,"ELECTRON micrographs of cross-sections of protein monolayers have been obtained in the following way. A monolayer of protein, a commercial sample of egg albumen, was spread at the surface of water contained in a small Langmuir type trough. This layer was then compressed and crumpled by advancing a barrier coated with paraffin wax towards a second retaining barrier. When the two barriers were about a centimetre apart, the crumpled film became visible at the interface and was lifted from the water as a frail thread by means of a wire yoke. Portions of this thread were prepared for cross-sectioning by dehydrating in an alcohol series and embedding in an epoxide resin1. It was found advantageous to ‘stain’ the specimen first by treating it for a short time in a buffered osmium tetroxide solution. The thread, darkened and hardened by this treatment, was easier to handle and to see by eye in the block and also in the electron microscope. Very thin sections were cut from the block at right angles to the length of the thread by the standard procedure for electron microscopy2 and examined in a Siemens ‘Elmiskop I’ microscope."

https://openalex.org/W1989117313,"IT has been known for some time that inorganic nitrates catalyse the formation of polysulphones from liquid mixtures of olefines and sulphur dioxide1, but the mechanism of catalysis has never been clarified. It is now suggested that the effective catalyst is nitrogen dioxide and/or the sulphite radical ion formed as the primary products of the reaction between nitrates and sulphur dioxide. The following observations are consistent with this suggestion:"

https://openalex.org/W2068020891,"IN the course of an investigation in the Jute Agricultural Research Institute on nitrogen transformation in soils cropped with jute, a nitrogen-fixing bacterium has been isolated by the dilution-plate technique. It shows certain morphological and physiological differences from the known non-symbiotic nitrogen-fixing organisms like Pseudomonas azotocalligans and those belonging to the Azotobacteriaceae1. The cells at first have a coccus-like appearance and occur singly (measuring 0.75–1.0 × 1.5–2.5µ on an average) or as doublets or triplets, gradually changing to rod shape (Fig. 1). The cells are Gram-negative; they contain fat and are very difficult to suspend in water. The optimum temperature for growth was found to be about 28° C. The organism is aerobic, but can be grown under low oxygen tension in Winogradsky's nitrogen-free glucose–phosphate media. It can grow in acidic media also; even at pH 4.0 growth was obtained. Bromo-cresol purple milk (skimmed) is turned alkaline and a sediment is formed at the bottom with a clear liquid surface after ten days incubation at 30° C."
https://openalex.org/W2017360853,"IT was shown by Linderstrom-Lang and co-workers1 that the tryptic hydrolysis of β-lactoglobulin involves the reversible denaturation of the protein as a preliminary stage. A consideration of known facts, together with new evidence obtained in connexion with an investigation of the mechanism of bating of skins in leather manufacture2, indicates that collagen and procollagen are also denatured by the enzyme prior to hydrolysis. Bating is a process in which skins, after liming and deliming, are treated with a proteolytic enzyme (usually trypsin) in order to produce a soft leather. The process has been shown to involve the removal of degraded collagen (a form of collagen in which the fibrillar structure has disintegrated and which has been named ‘progelatin’2) produced by the swelling action of lime, and is normally carried out at about 37° C. Temperature control is critical since little or no action takes place below 35° C., and above 40° C. rapid digestion of intact collagen occurs, leading to a loss of leather-making substance. The lower limit is explained by the fact that progelatin must be converted into gelatin before it can be hydrolysed by the enzyme. If, however, the skin is heated to 40–45° C. before adding the enzyme, bating can be carried out at a much lower temperature, for example, at 27° C. in about twice the time required at 37° C., which is in accord with the temperature coefficient of proteolytic enzymes acting on gelatin3. The higher temperature required to heat the progelatin in the absence of enzyme than in its presence is indicative of a denaturation stage which can be catalysed by the enzyme. As denaturation is believed to involve rupture of hydrogen bonds between parallel molecular chains, the enzyme functions as a hydrogen bond breaker in a similar manner to chemicals such as alkali, urea, potassium thiocyanate, etc."

https://openalex.org/W2028617463,"IT has been shown in a recent report by Strachan and Harris1 that a sputtering plant operated at voltages as low as 8–10 kV. can give rise to X-radiation which can be dangerous to the operator. This observation was made with an apparatus different from the two-electrode system used for the deposition of thin films. Their apparatus consisted of a glass vessel in which positive ions formed in a discharge between an oxide-coated cathode and iron anode were accelerated to a target used for sputtering. It was shown that the X-rays arose from secondary electrons emitted from the target bombarding the walls of the glass envelope. It was possible to operate the main sputtering chamber at a lower gas pressure than normal because the ions were formed in an auxiliary discharge. Thus, the secondary electrons were able to reach voltages comparable to that of the ion-accelerating potential because of their long mean free-path. In a glow discharge the secondary electrons are required for ionizing the gas molecules and their final voltage is not that of the applied potential. Thus it is uncertain whether the results of Strachan and Harris would be directly applicable to a normal two-electrode system with a cold cathode operated at 8–10 kV."
