https://openalex.org/W4210248221,"Background We retrospectively data-mined the case records of Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized to a tertiary care centre to derive mortality predictors and formulate a risk score, for prioritizing admission. Methods and findings Data on clinical manifestations, comorbidities, vital signs, and basic lab investigations collected as part of routine medical management at admission to a COVID-19 tertiary care centre in Chengalpattu, South India between May and November 2020 were retrospectively analysed to ascertain predictors of mortality in the univariate analysis using their relative difference in distribution among ‘survivors’ and ‘non-survivors’. The regression coefficients of those factors remaining significant in the multivariable logistic regression were utilised for risk score formulation and validated in 1000 bootstrap datasets. Among 746 COVID-19 patients hospitalised [487 “survivors” and 259 “non-survivors” (deaths)], there was a slight male predilection [62.5%, (466/746)], with a higher mortality rate observed among 40–70 years age group [59.1%, (441/746)] and highest among diabetic patients with elevated urea levels [65.4% (68/104)]. The adjusted odds ratios of factors [OR (95% CI)] significant in the multivariable logistic regression were SaO 2 &lt;95%; 2.96 (1.71–5.18), Urea ≥50 mg/dl: 4.51 (2.59–7.97), Neutrophil-lymphocytic ratio (NLR) &gt;3; 3.01 (1.61–5.83), Age ≥50 years;2.52 (1.45–4.43), Pulse Rate ≥100/min: 2.02 (1.19–3.47) and coexisting Diabetes Mellitus; 1.73 (1.02–2.95) with hypertension and gender not retaining their significance. The individual risk scores for Sa O 2 &lt;95–11, U rea ≥50 mg/dl-15, NL R &gt;3–11, A ge ≥50 years-9, Pulse R ate ≥100/min-7 and coexisting d iabetes mellitus-6, acronymed collectively as ‘ OUR-ARDs score ’ showed that the sum of scores ≥ 25 predicted mortality with a sensitivity-90%, specificity-64% and AUC of 0.85. Conclusions The ‘OUR ARDs’ risk score, derived from easily assessable factors predicting mortality, offered a tangible solution for prioritizing admission to COVID-19 tertiary care centre, that enhanced patient care but without unduly straining the health system."

In the present study, a total of 39 Korean participants (female = 20, mean age = 24.2 years) inferred seven emotions (happiness, surprise, fear, sadness, disgust, anger, surprise, and neutral) from uncovered, mask-covered, sunglasses-covered faces. The recognition rates were the lowest under mask conditions, followed by the sunglasses and uncovered conditions. In identifying emotions, different emotion types were associated with different areas of the face. Specifically, the mouth was the most critical area for happiness, surprise, sadness, disgust, and anger recognition, but fear was most recognized from the eyes. By simultaneously comparing faces with different parts covered, we were able to more accurately examine the impact of different facial areas on emotion recognition. We discuss the potential cultural differences and the ways in which individuals can cope with communication in which facial expressions are paramount."

This study presented data on the occurrence of microplastics in water, sediment, Bagrid Catfish (Chrysichthys nigrodigitatus) and Black-chinned Tilapia (Sarotherodon melanotheron) from the Densu River, an urban riverine system in Ghana. Microplastics were extracted from the samples collected from both the lentic and lotic sections of the river. The results indicated widespread pollution of the Densu River with microplastics in all the compartments studied. The average numbers of microplastic particles deposited in the Dam (2.0 ± 0.58) and Delta (2.50 ± 0.48) sections of the river were not affected by the differences in their hydrology. However, the stagnant water system of the Dam promoted the floating of larger-sized microplastics while the flowing waters of the Delta did not show any selectivity in the deposition of microplastics between sediment and the water column. The number of microplastics ingestions by the Bagrid Catfish (2.88 ± 2.11) was similar to the Black-chinned Tilapia (2.38 ± 1.66) but both species ingested lower numbers of microplastics than reported for marine fish species in coastal Ghana."
https://openalex.org/W4210413868,"Using microdata from the Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS 2010), this paper investigates whether there are green returns to education in China, where educational attainment promotes pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors. We establish causality by exploiting the exogenous variation induced by the implementation of the Compulsory Schooling Law (CSL) in China. We find evidence that educational attainment is associated with higher levels of pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors, and these estimates are robust to various robustness checks. Further analysis reveals that the acquisition of environmental knowledge is the channel that drives the effect of education on pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors. Finally, the effects of education are heterogeneous across individuals."
https://openalex.org/W4210400057,"Religious responses to COVID-19 as portrayed in a major news source raise the issue of conflict or cooperation between religious bodies and public health authorities. We compared articles in the New York Times relating to religion and COVID-19 with the COVID-19 statements posted on 63 faith-based organizations’ web sites, and with the guidance documents published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) specifically for religious bodies. We used computational text analysis to identify and compare sentiments and topics in the three bodies of text. Sentiment analysis showed consistent positive values for faith-based organizations’ texts throughout the period. The initial negative sentiment of religion—COVID-19 coverage in the New York Times rose over the period and eventually converged with the consistently positive sentiment of faith-based documents. In our topic modelling analysis, rank order and regression analysis showed that topic prevalence was similar in the faith-based and public health sources, and both showed statistically significant differences from the New York Times . We conclude that there is evidence of both narratives and counter-narratives, and that these showed demonstrable shifts over time. Text analysis of public documents shows alignment of the interests of public health and religious bodies, which can be discerned for the benefit of communities if parties are trusted and religious messages are consistent with public health communications."
https://openalex.org/W4210429075,"Municipal landfill leachates are a source of toxic heavy metals that have been shown to have a detrimental effect on human health and the environment. This study aimed to assess heavy metal contamination in leachates, surface water, and sediments from non-sanitary landfills in Uyo, Nigeria, and to identify potential health and environmental effects of leachate contamination. Over the wet and dry seasons, surface water and sediment samples were collected from an impacted freshwater ecosystem, and leachates samples from six monitoring wells. Elemental analyses of samples were conducted following standard analytical procedures and methods. The results indicated that leachate, surface water, and sediment samples all had elevated levels of heavy metals, implying a significant impact from landfills. Pollution indices such as the potential ecological risk index (PERI), pollution load index (PLI), degree of contamination (Cd), modified degree of contamination (mCd), enrichment factor (EF), geoaccumulation index (Igeo), and Nemerov pollution index (NPI) were used to assess the ecological impacts of landfill leachates. The following values were derived: PERI (29.09), PLI (1.96E-07), Cd (0.13), mCd (0.16), EF (0.97-1.79E-03), Igeo (0), and NPI (0.74). Pollution indicators suggested that the sediment samples were low to moderately polluted by chemical contaminants from the non-sanitary landfills, and may pose negative risks due to bioaccumulation. Human health risks were also assessed using standard risk models. For adults, children, and kids, the incremental lifetime cancer rate (ILCR) values were within the acceptable range of 1.00E-06-1.00E-04. The lifetime carcinogenicity risks associated with oral ingestion exposure to heavy metals were 9.09E-05, 1.21E-05, and 3.60 E-05 for kids, adults, and children, respectively. The mean cumulative risk values for dermal exposures were 3.24E-07, 1.89E-06, and 1.17E-05 for adults, children, and kids, respectively. These findings emphasized the risks of human and biota exposure to contaminants from landfills."
https://openalex.org/W4210544892,"Though antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programmes are the cornerstone of Uganda's national action plan (NAP) on antimicrobial resistance, there is limited evidence on AMS attitude and practices among healthcare providers in health facilities in Uganda. We determined healthcare providers' AMS attitudes, practices, and associated factors in selected health facilities in Uganda. We conducted a cross-sectional study among nurses, clinical officers, pharmacy technicians, medical officers, pharmacists, and medical specialists in 32 selected health facilities in Uganda. Data were collected once from each healthcare provider in the period from October 2019 to February 2020. Data were collected using an interview-administered questionnaire. AMS attitude and practice were analysed using descriptive statistics, where scores of AMS attitude and practices for healthcare providers were classified into high, fair, and low using a modified Blooms categorisation. Associations of AMS attitude and practice scores were determined using ordinal logistic regression. This study reported estimates of AMS attitude and practices, and odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were reported. We adjusted for clustering at the health facility level using clustered robust standard errors. A total of 582 healthcare providers in 32 healthcare facilities were recruited into the study. More than half of the respondents (58%,340/582) had a high AMS attitude. Being a female (aOR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.47-0.92, P < 0.016), having a bachelor's degree (aOR: 1.81, 95% CI: 1.24-2.63, P < 0.002) or master's (aOR: 2.06, 95% CI: 1.13-3.75, P < 0.018) were significant predictors of high AMS attitude. Most (46%, 261/582) healthcare providers had fair AMS practices. Healthcare providers in the western region's health facilities were less likely to have a high AMS practice (aOR: 0.52, 95% CI 0.34-0.79, P < 0.002). In this study, most healthcare providers in health facilities had a high AMS attitude and fair AMS practice."
https://openalex.org/W4210614338,"SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid (N) is the most abundant viral protein expressed in host samples and is an important antigen for diagnosis. N is a 45 kDa protein that does not present disulfide bonds. Intending to avoid non-specific binding of SARS-CoV-2 N to antibodies from patients who previously had different coronaviruses, a 35 kDa fragment of N was expressed without a conserved motif in E. coli as inclusion bodies (N122-419-IB). Culture media and IB washing conditions were chosen to obtain N122-419-IB with high yield (370 mg/L bacterial culture) and protein purity (90%). High pressure solubilizes protein aggregates by weakening hydrophobic and ionic interactions and alkaline pH promotes solubilization by electrostatic repulsion. The association of pH 9.0 and 2.4 kbar promoted efficient solubilization of N122-419-IB without loss of native-like tertiary structure that N presents in IB. N122-419 was refolded with a yield of 85% (326 mg/L culture) and 95% purity. The refolding process takes only 2 hours and the protein is ready for use after pH adjustment, avoiding the necessity of dialysis or purification. Antibody binding of COVID-19-positive patients sera to N122-419 was confirmed by Western blotting. ELISA using N122-419 is effective in distinguishing between sera presenting antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 from those who do not. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed condition for IB solubilization is one of the mildest described. It is possible that the refolding process can be extended to a wide range of proteins with high yields and purity, even those that are sensible to very alkaline pH."
https://openalex.org/W4210272917,"Ethiopia is one of the high burden countries for extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB); however, the prompt diagnosis of EPTB remains challenging. This study is aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of Xpert MTB/RIF and DetermineTM TB-LAM Ag (TB-LAM) for the prompt diagnosis of EPTB in Ethiopia.A total of 147 presumptive EPTB patients, including 23 HIV- positive participants were enrolled. Extra-pulmonary samples were collected from all presumptive EPTB cases and tested for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) using fluorescent microscopy, Xpert MTB/RIF, and culture. Additionally, urine samples were also collected from 126 participants and were tested by DetermineTM TB-LAM Ag (Alere Inc, Waltham, USA). The Sensitivity and specificity of Xpert and TB- LAM tests were calculated by comparing with a composite reference standard (CRS), which comprises smear microscopy, culture and response to empirical anti-TB treatment.Of 147 patients, 23 (15.6%) were confirmed EPTB cases (culture-positive), 14 (9.5%) were probable EPTB (clinically, radiologically or cytologically positive and received anti-TB treatment with good response), and 110 (74.8%) were classified as ""non- TB"" cases. Compared to the composite reference standard (CRS), the overall sensitivity and specificity of Xpert MTB/RIF were 43.2% and 100%, respectively with the highest sensitivity for Lymph node aspirate (85.7%) and lower sensitivity for pleural fluid (14.3%) and 100% specificity for all specimen types. The sensitivity and specificity of TB-LAM were 33.3% and 94.4% respectively with the highest sensitivity for HIV co-infected participants (83.3%). The sensitivity of the combination of Xpert MTB/RIF and TB-LAM tests regardless of HIV status was 61.1% whereas the sensitivity was improved to 83.3% for HIV-positive cases.TB-LAM alone has low sensitivity for EPTB diagnosis; however, the combination of TB-LAM and Xpert MTB/RIF improves the diagnosis of EPTB particularly for countries with high EPTB and HIV cases."
https://openalex.org/W4210370538,"The incidence of Lyme disease is increasing in Québec and is closely linked to the distribution of Ixodes scapularis ticks. A time-to-establishment model developed in 2012 by Leighton and colleagues predicted the year of tick population establishment for each municipality in eastern Canada. To validate if this model correctly predicted tick distribution in Québec, predicted tick establishment was compared to field data from active tick surveillance (2010–2018) using two criteria: i) the detection of at least one tick and ii) the detection of the three questing stages of the tick. The speed of tick establishment and the increase in the exposed human population by 2100 were predicted with the time-to-establishment model. Field observations were consistent with model predictions. Ticks were detected on average 3 years after the predicted year. The probability of tick detection is significantly higher after the predicted year than before (61% vs 27% of collections). The trend was similar for the detection of three tick stages (16% vs 9% of collections). The average speed of tick range expansion was estimated by the model to be 18 km/year in Québec, with 90% of the human population exposed by 2027. The validation of the time-to-establishment model using field data confirmed that it could be used to project I . scapularis range expansion in Québec, and consequently the increase in Lyme disease risk over the coming decades. This will help public health authorities anticipate and adapt preventive measures, especially in areas not yet affected by Lyme disease."
https://openalex.org/W4210387296,"RNA binding proteins play an important role in regulating alternative pre-mRNA splicing and in turn cellular gene expression. Polypyrimidine tract binding proteins, PTBP1 and PTBP2, are paralogous RNA binding proteins that play a critical role in the process of neuronal differentiation and maturation; changes in the concentration of PTBP proteins during neuronal development direct splicing changes in many transcripts that code for proteins critical for neuronal differentiation. How the two related proteins regulate different sets of neuronal exons is unclear. The distinct splicing activities of PTBP1 and PTBP2 can be recapitulated in an in vitro splicing system with the differentially regulated N1 exon of the c-src pre-mRNA. Here, we conducted experiments under these in vitro splicing conditions to identify PTBP1 and PTBP2 interacting partner proteins. Our results highlight that both PTBPs interact with proteins that participate in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation. Our data reveal that PTBP1 interacts with many proteins involved in mRNA processing including splicing regulation while PTBP2 does not. Our results also highlight enzymes that can serve as potential ""writers"" and ""erasers"" in adding chemical modifications to the PTB proteins. Overall, our study highlights important differences in protein-protein interactions between the PTBP proteins under splicing conditions and supports a role for post-translational modifications in dictating their distinct splicing activities."
https://openalex.org/W4210429847,"Background Impairments to comprehension and production of speech (aphasia, dysarthria) and swallowing disorders (dysphagia) are common sequelae of stroke, reducing patients’ quality of life and social participation. Treatment oriented on evidence-based guidelines seems likely to improve outcomes. Currently, little is known about guideline adherence in stroke aftercare for the above-mentioned sequelae. This study aims to analyse guideline adherence in the treatment of aphasia, dysarthria and dysphagia after stroke, based on suitable test parameters, and to determine factors that influence the implementation of recommended therapies. Methods Six test parameters were defined, based on systematic study of guidelines for the treatment of speech impairments and swallowing disorders (e.g. comprehensive diagnostics, early initiation and continuity). Guideline adherence in treatment was tested using claims data from four statutory health insurance companies. Multivariate logistic and linear regression analyses were performed in order to test the outcomes. Results 4,486 stroke patients who were diagnosed with specific disorders or received speech therapy were included in the study. The median age was 78 years; the proportion of women was 55.9%. Within the first year after the stroke, 90.3% of patients were diagnosed with speech impairments and swallowing disorders. Overall, 44.1% of patients received outpatient speech and language therapy aftercare. Women were less frequently diagnosed with specific disorders (OR 0.70 [95%CI:0.55/0.88], p = 0.003) and less frequently received longer therapy sessions (OR 0.64 [95%CI:0.43/0.94], p = 0.022). Older age and longer hospitalization duration increased the likelihood of guideline recommendations being implemented and of earlier initiation of stroke aftercare measures. Conclusions Our observations indicate deficits in the implementation of guideline recommendations in stroke aftercare. At the same time, they underscore the need for regular monitoring of implementation measures in stroke aftercare to address group-based disparities in care."
https://openalex.org/W4210503267,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a fibrosing interstitial lung disease, predominantly affects the elderly and is associated with a high mortality risk. Nintedanib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, significantly reduces IPF progression. However, data on the tolerability and efficacy of nintedanib in the elderly with IPF are limited. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the tolerability and efficacy of nintedanib in the elderly with IPF in a real-world setting. Medical records of 19 elderly IPF patients (≥ 75 years) and 46 non-elderly IPF patients (&lt; 75 years) newly administered nintedanib were retrospectively analyzed. We compared the forced vital capacity (FVC) level, incidence and severity of adverse events, and continuation rates of nintedanib between the two groups. FVC and percent predicted diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLco) were lower in the elderly IPF group at baseline. Although the elderly IPF patients had a significantly higher incidence of adverse events, such as diarrhea, nausea, and elevation of hepatic enzymes, the rate of discontinuation of nintedanib owing to adverse events was not different between the groups. The continuation rates of nintedanib treatment at 6 months and 1 year in the elderly IPF group were equivalent. Furthermore, there was a similar trend in the reduction of the annual FVC decline after nintedanib initiation between the groups. Our study demonstrated that nintedanib was tolerable in both the IPF patient groups in a real-world setting. Proper management of adverse events in the elderly with IPF would lead to a better clinical outcome."
https://openalex.org/W4226136886,"Host-associated microbial communities are impacted by external and within-host factors, i.e., diet and feeding behavior. For organisms known to have a circadian rhythm in feeding behavior, microbiome composition is likely impacted by the different rates of microbe introduction and removal across a daily cycle, in addition to any diet-induced changes in microbial interactions. Here, we measured feeding behavior and used 16S rRNA sequencing to compare the microbial community across a diel cycle in two distantly related species of Daphnia , that differ in their life history traits, to assess how daily feeding patterns impact microbiome composition. We find that Daphnia species reared under similar laboratory conditions have significantly different microbial communities. Additionally, we reveal that Daphnia have daily differences in their microbial composition that correspond with feeding behavior, such that there is greater microbiome diversity at night during the host’s active feeding phase. These results highlight that zooplankton microbiomes are relatively distinct and are likely influenced by host phylogeny."
https://openalex.org/W4210324853,"In order to advance models of human oral mucosa towards routine use, these models must faithfully mimic the native tissue structure while also being scalable and cost efficient. The goal of this study was to develop a low-cost, keratinized human gingival model with high fidelity to human attached gingiva and demonstrate its utility for studying the implant-tissue interface. Primary human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) and keratinocytes (HGK) were isolated from clinically healthy gingival biopsies. Four matrices, electrospun collagen (ES), decellularized dermis (DD), type I collagen gels (Gel) and released type I collagen gels (Gel-R)) were tested to engineer lamina propria and gingiva. HGF viability was similar in all matrices except for Gel-R, which was significantly decreased. Cell penetration was largely limited to the top layers of all matrices. Histomorphometrically, engineered human gingiva was found to have similar appearance to the native normal human gingiva except absence of rete pegs. Immunohistochemical staining for cell phenotype, differentiation and extracellular matrix composition and organization within 3D engineered gingiva made with electrospun collagen was mostly in agreement with normal gingival tissue staining. Additionally, five types of dental material posts (5-mm diameter x 3-mm height) with different surface characteristics were used [machined titanium, SLA (sandblasted-acid etched) titanium, TiN-coated (titanium nitride-coated) titanium, ceramic, and PEEK (Polyetheretherketone) to investigate peri-implant soft tissue attachment studied by histology and SEM. Engineered epithelial and stromal tissue migration to the implant-gingival tissue interface was observed in machined, SLA, ceramic, and PEEK groups, while TiN was lacking attachment. Taken together, the results suggest that electrospun collagen scaffolds provide a scalable, reproducible and cost-effective lamina propria and 3D engineered gingiva that can be used to explore biomaterial-soft tissue interface."
https://openalex.org/W4210565739,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by impaired social communication and behavioral problems. An increased risk of premature mortality has been observed in individuals with ASD. Therefore, we hypothesized that biological aging is accelerated in individuals with ASD. Recently, several studies have established genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles as 'epigenetic clocks' that can estimate biological aging. In addition, ASD has been associated with differential DNAm patterns.We used two independent datasets from blood samples consisting of adult patients with high-functioning ASD and controls: the 1st cohort (38 ASD cases and 31 controls) and the 2nd cohort (6 ASD cases and 10 controls). We explored well-studied epigenetic clocks such as HorvathAge, HannumAge, SkinBloodAge, PhenoAge, GrimAge, and DNAm-based telomere length (DNAmTL). In addition, we investigated seven DNAm-based age-related plasma proteins, including plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and smoking status, which are the components of GrimAge.Compared to controls, individuals with ASD in the 1st cohort, but not in the 2nd cohort, exhibited a trend for increased GrimAge acceleration and a significant increase of PAI-1 levels. A meta-analysis showed significantly increased PAI-1 levels in individuals with ASD compared to controls.Our findings suggest there is no epigenetic age acceleration in the blood of individuals with ASD. However, this study provides novel evidence regarding increased plasma PAI-1 levels in individuals with high-functioning ASD. These findings suggest PAI-1 may be a biomarker for high-functioning ASD, however, larger studies based on epigenetic clocks and PAI-1 will be necessary to confirm these findings."
https://openalex.org/W4210270751,"Since July 2019, Gyaros island in the central Aegean Sea, enjoys the status of a partial Marine Protected Area (MPA), allowing for exploitation by small-scale fishers following specific spatio-temporal restrictions. The need for assessing the effectiveness of the MPA in the future, led MAVA Foundation to fund a knowledge survey project aiming to serve as a baseline for future reference. A series of experimental fishing surveys took place with static nets, the outcomes of which are presented herein. From June 2018 to September 2020, a series of 8 fishing excursions with a total of 40 experimental fishing sets with bottom static nets were realized in 5 set locations around Gyaros island, inside the MPA protection zone. A total of 75 species were identified; the most abundant species, in terms of biomass, being: parrotfish -Sparisoma cretense , red scorpionfish- Scorpaena scrofa , common spiny lobster- Palinurus elephas , red porgy- Pagrus pagrus , little tunny–- Euthynnus alletteratus , Mediterranean moray- Muraena helena , lesser spotted dogfish - Scyliorhinus canicula , forkbeard- Phycis phycis , surmullet- Mullus surmuletus , common cuttlefish- Sepia officinalis and common Pandora- Pagellus erythrinus . A comparison with similar data in adjacent areas outside the MPA allowed for assessing the effectiveness of the MPA based on four indicators: species diversity index, species relative biomass index, key predator species abundance, and alien fish abundance. Based solely on the experimental fishing trials, the MPA seems to be functioning, since both species diversity and abundance were higher within the protected area. However, its performance may still not be considered as optimal, as this is indicated by the large proportion of undersized key predators (e.g. groupers), although more abundant and larger than the ones residing outside the MPA."
https://openalex.org/W4210351156,"The capability to establish accurate predictions is an integral part of learning. Whether predictions about different dimensions of a stimulus interact with each other, and whether such an interaction affects learning, has remained elusive. We conducted a statistical learning study with EEG (electroencephalography), where a stream of consecutive sound triplets was presented with deviants that were either: (a) statistical, depending on the triplet ending probability, (b) physical, due to a change in sound location or (c) double deviants, i.e. a combination of the two. We manipulated the predictability of stimulus-onset by using random stimulus-onset asynchronies. Temporal unpredictability due to random onsets reduced the neurophysiological responses to statistical and location deviants, as indexed by the statistical mismatch negativity (sMMN) and the location MMN. Our results demonstrate that the predictability of one stimulus attribute influences the processing of prediction error signals of other stimulus attributes, and thus also learning of those attributes."
https://openalex.org/W4210412668,"Background Hospitals face immense pressures in balancing patient throughput. Medical assessment units have emerged as a commonplace response to improve the flow of medical patients presenting to the emergency department requiring hospital admission and to ease overcrowding in the emergency department. The aim of this study was to understand factors influencing the decision-making behaviour of key stakeholders involved in the transfer of care of medical patients from one service to the other in a large, tertiary teaching hospital in Queensland, Australia. Methods We used a qualitative approach drawing on data from focus groups with key informant health and professional staff involved in the transfer of care. A theoretically-informed, semi-structured focus group guide was used to facilitate discussion and explore factors impacting on decisions made to transfer care of patients from the emergency department to the medical assessment unit. Thematic analysis was undertaken to look for patterns in the data. Results Two focus groups were conducted with a total of 15 participants. Four main themes were identified: (1) we have a process—we just don’t use it; (2) I can do it, but can they; (3) if only we could skype them; and (4) why can’t they just go up. Patient flow relies on efficiency in two processes—the transfer of care and the physical re-location of the patient from one service to the other. The findings suggest that factors other than clinical reasoning are at play in influencing decision-making behaviour. Conclusions Acknowledgement of the interaction within and between professional and health staff (human factors) with the organisational imperatives, policies, and process (system factors) may be critical to improve efficiencies in the service and minimise the introduction of workarounds that might compromise patient safety."
https://openalex.org/W4210464309,"The cytokine Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) exerts powerful immunoregulatory effects on the adaptive immune system and also enhances functions of the neutrophil (PMN). The clinical use of IFN-γ has been driven by the finding that its administration to patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) results in decreased incidence and severity of infections. However, IFN-γ has no effect on the characteristic defect of CGD, the inability to convert oxygen to microbicidal metabolites including superoxide anion (O2-) during the phagocytosis associated oxidative burst. We administered varying doses of IFN-γ to adult volunteers and studied the effects on plasma drug levels and response molecules and PMNs isolated from blood drawn at intervals over a 96- hour period. Plasma concentrations of IFN-γ, IP-10 and neopterin, and stimulated release of O2- from PMNs exhibited dose- and time-dependent increases after IFN-γ administration. Gene expression in PMNs was altered for 2775 genes; changes occurred rapidly after administration and returned to baseline in 24-36 hours. Several genes involved with neutrophil host defense were upregulated including those for components of the O2- generating NADPH oxidase; innate-immune and Fc receptors; proteins involved in MHCI and II; a regulator of circulating PMN number; guanylate binding proteins; and a key enzyme in synthesis of an essential NOS cofactor. Coordinate changes were detected in protein levels of representative products from several of these genes. Lysates from isolated neutrophils also demonstrated a spike in NO following IFN-γ administration. IFN-γ appears to increase non-oxygen dependent microbicidal functions of PMNs which could provide strategies to compensate for deficiencies, explain its clinical benefit for CGD patients and expand therapeutic applications of IFN-γ to other disorders.

https://openalex.org/W4210307040,"To evaluate the association between the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and post-inflammatory emphysematous lung alterations on follow-up low-dose CT scans.Consecutive patients with proven COVID-19 infection and a follow-up CT were retrospectively reviewed. The severity of pulmonary involvement was classified as mild, moderate and severe. Total lung volume, emphysema volume and the ratio of emphysema/-to-lung volume were quantified semi-automatically and compared inter-individually between initial and follow-up CT and to a control group of healthy, age- and sex-matched patients. Lung density was further assessed by drawing circular regions of interest (ROIs) into non-affected regions of the upper lobes.A total of 32 individuals (mean age: 64 ± 13 years, 12 females) with at least one follow-up CT (mean: 52 ± 66 days, range: 5-259) were included. In the overall cohort, total lung volume, emphysema volume and the ratio of lung-to-emphysema volume did not differ significantly between the initial and follow-up scans. In the subgroup of COVID-19 patients with > 30 days of follow-up, the emphysema volume was significantly larger as compared to the subgroup with a follow-up < 30 days (p = 0.045). Manually measured single ROIs generally yielded lower attenuation values prior to COVID-19 pneumonia, but the difference was not significant between groups (all p > 0.05).COVID-19 patients with a follow-up CT >30 days showed significant emphysematous lung alterations. These findings may help to explain the long-term effect of COVID-19 on pulmonary function and warrant validation by further studies."
https://openalex.org/W4210474811,"Purpose To evaluate predictors for success in corneal crosslinking (CXL) for keratoconus in a large cohort and extended follow-up. Design A retrospective study based on a prospectively built database. Methods Participants underwent CXL for keratoconus from 2007 to 2018. Statistical analysis was performed for patients with at least 1-year follow-up. We analyzed effects of CXL type (Epithelium-on or Epithelium-off and Accelerated (9mW/cm2@10min) or Standard (3mW/cm2@30min)) and pre-operative factors including age, gender, baseline LogMAR visual acuity (LogMAR pre ), maximal corneal power (Kmax pre ), pachymetry, refractive and topographic cylinders, spherical equivalent (SE pre ), mean corneal power (MeanK) and follow-up time on outcome measures. The outcome measures were the final change of Kmax (Delta Kmax) and the final change in LogMAR visual acuity (Delta LogMAR). A more negative Delta Kmax or Delta LogMAR represents a favorable effect of crosslinking. Results 517 eyes had Kmax results, and 385 eyes had LogMAR results with more than one year follow-up. These eyes were included in the study. The mean follow-up time was 2.29 years. Mean Kmax decreased from 54.07±5.99 diopters to 52.84±5.66 diopters (p&lt;0.001), and Mean LogMAR decreased from 0.28±0.20 to 0.25±0.21 (p&lt;0.001). Non-accelerated epithelium-off CXL resulted in greater flattening of Kmax when compared with other protocols. Visual acuity improvement was similar when comparing different CXL protocols. Multivariate analysis showed four factors associated with negative Delta Kmax: high Kmax pre , high SE pre , high MeanK pre, and non-accelerated procedure. Multivariate analysis showed three factors associated with negative Delta LogMAR: high LogMAR pre , high SE pre , and Low MeanK pre . After excluding corneas with Kmax pre &gt;65 D or Pachymetry&lt;400 microns, multivariate analysis showed that high Kmax pre , high SE pre , and non-accelerated CXL were associated with negative Delta Kmax while high LogMAR pre and high SE pre were associated with negative Delta LogMAR. Conclusion CXL for keratoconus is a highly effective treatment, as evident by its effects on the outcome measures: Delta Kmax and Delta LogMAR. CXL was more successful in eyes with high Kmax pre , high SE pre , and high LogMAR pre, which express disease severity. The non-accelerated epithelium-off protocol was associated with greater flattening of corneal curvature but did not show a better effect on visual acuity as compared to the other CXL protocols."
https://openalex.org/W4210499182,"Avocado ( Persea americana Mill.) is an important horticultural crop and proved to be a very profitable commercial crop for both local consumption and export. The physical characteristics of fruits are an important factor to determine the quality of fruit produced. On the other hand, estimation of fruit volume is time-consuming and impractical under field conditions. Thus, this study was conducted to devise cultivar-specific and generalized allometric models to analytically and non-destructively determine avocado fruit volume of five wildly distributed avocado cultivars. A significant relationship ( P ≤ 0.01) was found between fruit diameter, length, and volume of each cultivar. Our best models (VM2 –for cultivar specific, and VM7-generalized model) has passed all the rigorous cross-validation and performance statistics tests and explained 94%, 92%, 87%, 93%, 94% and 93% of the variations in fruit volume of Ettinger, Fuerte, Hass, Nabal, Reed, and Multiple cultivars, respectively. Our finding revealed that in situations where measurements of volume would be inconvenient, or time-consuming, a reliable volume and yield estimation can be obtained using site- and cultivar-specific allometric equations. Allometric models could also play a significant role in improving data availability on avocado fruit physical appearance which is critical to assess the quality and taste of fresh products influencing the purchase decision of customers. Moreover, such information can also be used as a ripeness index to predict optimum harvest time important for planned marketing. More importantly, the models might assist horticulturists, agronomists, and physiologists to conduct further study on avocado production and productivity through agroforestry landuse system across Ethiopia."
https://openalex.org/W4210509695,"In high tuberculosis (TB) burden countries, health settings, including non-designated TB hospitals, host many patients with pulmonary TB. Bangladesh's National TB Control Program aims to strengthen TB infection prevention and control (IPC) in health settings. However, there has been no published literature to date that assessed the preparedness of hospitals to comply with the recommendations. To address this gap, our study examined healthcare workers knowledge and attitudes towards TB IPC guidelines and their perceptions regarding the hospitals' preparedness in Bangladesh. Between January to December 2019, we conducted 16 key-informant interviews and four focus group discussions with healthcare workers from two public tertiary care hospitals. In addition, we undertook a review of 13 documents [i.e., hospital policy, annual report, staff list, published manuscript]. Our findings showed that healthcare workers acknowledged the TB risk and were willing to implement the TB IPC measures but identified key barriers impacting implementation. Gaps were identified in: policy (no TB policy or guidelines in the hospital), health systems (healthcare workers were unaware of the guidelines, lack of TB IPC program, training and education, absence of healthcare-associated TB infection surveillance, low priority of TB IPC, no TB IPC monitoring and feedback, high patient load and bed occupancy, and limited supply of IPC resources) and behavioural factors (risk perception, compliance, and self and social stigma). The additional service-level gap was the lack of electronic medical record systems. These findings highlighted that while there is a demand amongst healthcare workers to implement TB IPC measures, the public tertiary care hospitals have got key issues to address. Therefore, the National TB Control Program may consider these gaps, provide TB IPC guidelines to these hospitals, assist them in developing hospital-level IPC manual, provide training, and coordinate with the ministry of health to allocate separate budget, staffing, and IPC resources to implement the control measures successfully."
https://openalex.org/W4210672688,"The aims of the study were two-fold: i) examine the validity and reliability of high-speed kicking actions using foot-mounted inertial measurement unit's (IMU), ii) quantify soccer players within-microcycle and inter-positional differences in both the frequency and speed of technical actions.During the in-season phase (25 weeks) of the UK domestic season, 21 professional soccer player ball releases, high-speed ball releases and ball release index were analysed. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient and confidence intervals were used to determine the validity between the systems, whilst a general linear mixed model analysis approach was used to establish estimated marginal mean values for total ball releases, high-speed ball releases and ball release index.Good concurrent validity was observed for ball release velocity and high-speed kicks against a high-speed camera (r2- 0.96, CI 0.93-0.98). Ball releases, high-speed ball releases and ball release index all showed main effects for fixture proximity (p>0.001), playing positions (p>0.001) and across different training categories (p>0.001). The greatest high-speed ball releases were observed on a match-day (MD)+1 (17.6 ± 11.9; CI- 16.2 to 19) and MD-2 (16.8 ± 15; CI- 14.9 to 18.7), with MD+1 exhibiting the highest number of ball releases (161.1 ± 51.2; CI- 155.0 to 167.2) and ball release index (145.5 ± 45.2; CI- 140.1 to 150.9) across all fixture proximities. Possessions (0.3 ± 0.9; CI- 0.3 to 0.4) and small-sided games (1.4 ± 1.6; CI- 1.4 to 1.5), had the lowest values for high-speed ball releases with technical (6.1 ± 7.2; CI- 5.7 to 6.6) and tactical (10.0 ± 10.5; CI- 6.9 to 13.1) drills showing the largest high-speed ball releases.The present study provides novel information regarding the quantification of technical actions of professional soccer players. Insights into absolute and relative frequency and intensity of releases in different drill types, provide practitioners with valuable information on technical outputs that can be manipulated during the process of planning training programmes to produce desired outcomes. Both volume and speed of ball release actions should be measured, when monitoring the technical actions in training according to fixture proximity, drill type and player position to permit enhanced training prescription."
https://openalex.org/W4210729403,"The aim was to investigate the impact of a group-based weight management programme on symptoms of depression and anxiety compared with self-help in a randomised controlled trial (RCT).People with overweight (Body Mass Index [BMI]≥28kg/m2) were randomly allocated self-help (n = 211) or a group-based weight management programme for 12 weeks (n = 528) or 52 weeks (n = 528) between 18/10/2012 and 10/02/2014. Symptoms were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, at baseline, 3, 12 and 24 months. Linear regression modelling examined changes in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale between trial arms.At 3 months, there was a -0.6 point difference (95% confidence interval [CI], -1.1, -0.1) in depression score and -0.1 difference (95% CI, -0.7, 0.4) in anxiety score between group-based weight management programme and self-help. At subsequent time points there was no consistent evidence of a difference in depression or anxiety scores between trial arms. There was no evidence that depression or anxiety worsened at any time point.There was no evidence of harm to depression or anxiety symptoms as a result of attending a group-based weight loss programme. There was a transient reduction in symptoms of depression, but not anxiety, compared to self-help. This effect equates to less than 1 point out of 21 on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and is not clinically significant."
https://openalex.org/W4210764933,"Objective The success of pharmacological randomised controlled trials (RCTs) depends on the recruitment of the required number of participants. Recruitment to RCTs for patients with cirrhosis and small oesophageal varices raises specific additional challenges. The objectives of the study were 1) to explore patient perspectives on factors that influence RCT recruitment, 2) to understand factors that influence the success of recruitment from a staff perspective, and 3) to identify opportunities for tailored interventions to improve trial recruitment in this context. Methods The qualitative study was embedded in a multi-centre blinded RCT (BOPPP trial) and was conducted alongside site opening. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with patients who enrolled to participate in the trial (n = 13), patients who declined to take part (n = 5), and staff who were responsible for recruiting participants to the trial (n = 18). An open approach to data collection and analysis was adopted and the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) was used to provide a theoretical lens through which to view influences on behaviour. Data was analysed using thematic analysis. Results The findings consist of 5 overarching themes that outline trial recruitment influences at the patient, staff, team, organisational and trial levels: i) patient risks and benefits ii) staff attitudes , knowledge and capacity , iii) team-based approach , iv) organisational context and v) Trial collective . Patient-generated themes map onto thirteen of the fourteen TDF domains and staff-generated themes map onto all TDF domains. The overarching themes are not mutually exclusive; with evidence of direct interactions between patient and staff-level themes that influence recruitment behaviours. Conclusions This study uses a theory-informed approach to gain new insights into improving clinical trial recruitment for patients with cirrhosis and small oesophageal varices. Although people with cirrhosis often display decreased healthcare-seeking behaviours, we found that patients used research to empower themselves to improve their health. Pragmatic trials involving unpredictable populations require staff expertise in building trust, and a deep knowledge of the patient group and their vulnerabilities. RCT recruitment is also more successful when research visits align with what staff identified as the natural rhythm of care. Trial registration ISRCTN10324656; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ ."
https://openalex.org/W4210276471,"Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is now widely used in dentistry and growing areas of medical imaging. The presence of strong metal artifacts is however a major concern of using CBCT especially in dentistry due to the presence of highly attenuating dental restorations, fixed appliances, and implants. Virtual monoenergetic images (VMIs) synthesized from dual energy CT (DECT) datasets are known to reduce metal artifacts. Although several techniques exist for DECT imaging, they in general come with significantly increased equipment cost and not available in dental clinics. The objectives of this study were to investigate the feasibility of developing a low-cost dual energy CBCT (DE-CBCT) by retrofitting a regular CBCT scanner with a carbon nanotube (CNT) x-ray source with dual focal spots and corresponding low-energy (LE) and high-energy (HE) spectral filters. A testbed with a CNT field emission x-ray source (NuRay Technology, Chang Zhou, China), a flat panel detector (Teledyne, Waterloo, Canada), and a rotating object stage was used for this feasibility study. Two distinct polychromatic x-ray spectra with the mean photon energies of 66.7keV and 86.3keV were produced at a fixed 120kVp x-ray tube voltage by using Al+Au and Al+Sn foils as the respective LE and HE filters attached to the exist window of the x-ray source. The HE filter attenuated the x-ray photons more than the LE filter. The calculated post-object air kerma rate of the HE beam was 31.7% of the LE beam. An anthropomorphic head phantom (RANDO, Nuclear Associates, Hicksville, NY) with metal beads was imaged using the testbed and the images were reconstructed using an iterative volumetric CT reconstruction algorithm. The VMIs were synthesized using an image-domain basis materials decomposition method with energy ranging from 30 to 150keV. The results were compared to the reconstructed images from a single energy clinical dental CBCT scanner (CS9300, Carestream Dental, Atlanta, GA). A significant reduction of the metal artifacts was observed in the VMI images synthesized at high energies compared to those from the same object imaged by the clinical dental CBCT scanner. The ability of the CNT x-ray source to generate the output needed to compensate the reduction of photon flux due to attenuation from the spectral filters and to maintain the CT imaging time was evaluated. The results demonstrated the feasibility of DE-CBCT imaging using the proposed approach. Metal artifact reduction was achieved in VMIs synthesized. The x-ray output needed for the proposed DE-CBCT can be generated by a fixed-anode CNT x-ray source."

Sausage casing is one of the key factors affecting the quality of fermented sausage. However, there is little information involved in this field.In this study, collagen casings were used as a wrapping material, and natural casings (pig casings) were used as a control. The effects of the two types of casings on biogenic amine content and other quality characteristics of fermented sausage were analyzed with increasing the storage time.The results showed that with storage time increasing, the hardness and gumminess of fermented sausage in collagen casing (CC) group were higher than those in pig casing (PC) group (P<0.05), while the elasticity in CC group was lower than that in PC group (P<0.05). In the processing and storage period, there was no significant difference in the type and content of flavor substances between the two groups. More importantly, the contents of tryptamine, putrescine, cadaverine, histamine, tyramine and phenyethylamine in fermented sausage of CC group were lower than those in PC group (P<0.05).In conclusion, this study revealed that CC could improve the quality characteristics of fermented sausage and reduce the content of biogenic amines in fermented sausage, which provides a theoretical basis for the choice of casings in industrial production in the future."
https://openalex.org/W4210435070,"Harvesting the adult male Jonah crab, Cancer borealis , mainly based on the size, has become an economically significant fishery, particularly in the Southern New England region of the US since 2000. Many decapod crustacean fisheries including C. borealis rely on harvesting adult males. Understanding the size related-sexual maturity and the seasonal changes in male reproductive activity is critical for sustainable management. In other decapods, an insulin-like hormone produced by the male-specific androgenic gland (AG), called insulin-like androgenic gland factor (IAG), plays an essential role in sexual maturity. Specifically IAG is involved in developing male primary and secondary sexual characteristics including spermatogenesis. This study aimed first to identify the IAG, then examine if season influences IAG expression in C . borealis males. Finally, the AG transcriptome was used to test if eyestalk neuropeptides regulate IAG levels via an endocrine axis between the two endocrine tissues as established in other crustaceans. The full-length CabIAG sequence is 928 nucleotides long, encoding a 151 amino acid deduced sequence. The CabIAG identified from the AG transcriptome after eyestalk ablation was the most highly expressed gene and accounted for up to 25% of transcripts, further confirming the presence of an endocrine axis between the androgenic gland and eyestalk ganglia. This gene expression was exclusive in male C . borealis AG. The transcriptomic analysis also revealed strong upregulation of the PPOAE transcript and downregulation of proteolytic enzymes. The CabIAG levels differ by season, increasing AG activity in fall and possibly coinciding with high mating activity. The timing of increased AG activity correlating to mating with females should be considered for better stock management for the C . borealis population."
https://openalex.org/W4210492329,"Suicide rates have been steadily increasing in both the U.S. general population and military, with significant psychological and economic consequences. The purpose of the current study was to examine the economic costs and cost-benefit of the suicide-focused Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality (CAMS) intervention versus enhanced treatment as usual (ETAU) in an active duty military sample using data from a recent randomized controlled trial of CAMS versus ETAU. The full intent-to-treat sample included 148 participants (mean age 26.8 years ± 5.9 SD years, 80% male, 53% White). Using a micro-costing approach, the cost of each condition was calculated at the individual level from a healthcare system perspective. Benefits were estimated at the individual level as cost savings in past-year healthcare expenditures based on direct care reimbursement rates. Cost-benefit was examined in the form of cost-benefit ratios and net benefit. Total costs, benefits, cost-benefit ratios, and net benefit were calculated and analyzed using general linear mixed modeling on multiply imputed datasets. Results indicated that treatment costs did not differ significantly between conditions; however, CAMS was found to produce significantly greater benefit in the form of decreased healthcare expenditures at 6-month follow-up. CAMS also demonstrated significantly greater cost-benefit ratios (i.e., benefit per dollar spent on treatment) and net-benefit (i.e., total benefit less the cost of treatment) at 12-month follow-up. The current study suggests that beyond its clinical effectiveness, CAMS may also convey potential economic advantages over usual care for the treatment of suicidal active duty service members. Our findings demonstrate cost savings in the form of reduced healthcare expenditures, which theoretically represent resources that can be reallocated toward other healthcare system needs, and thus lend support toward the overall value of CAMS."

PRECISION and PRECISE are among the first randomised studies to evaluate the new MRI-targeted biopsy (MRI-TB) pathway with a non-paired design to detect clinically significant prostate cancer and avoid unnecessary treatment. The trials' results individually demonstrated non-inferiority of MRI-TB compared to TRUS biopsy. An individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis was planned from the outset of the two trials in parallel and this IPD meta-analysis aims to further elucidate the utility of MRI-TB as the optimal diagnostic pathway for prostate cancer.This study is registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021249263). A search of Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Registered Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov was performed up until 4th February 2021. Only randomised controlled trials (PRECISE, PRECISION and other eligible trials) comparing the MRI-targeted biopsy pathway and traditional TRUS biopsy pathway will be included. The primary outcome of the review is the proportion of men diagnosed with clinically significant prostate cancer in each arm (Gleason ≥ 3+4 = 7). IPD and study-level data and characteristics will be sought from eligible studies. Analyses will be done primarily using an intention-to-treat approach, and a one-step IPD meta-analysis will be performed using generalised linear mixed models. A non-inferiority margin of 5 percentage points will be used. Heterogeneity will be quantified using the variance parameters from the mixed model. If there is sufficient data, we will investigate heterogeneity by exploring the effect of the different conducts of MRIs, learning curves of MRI reporting and MRI targeted biopsies.This systematic review is registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021249263)."

The current feasibility study used MRI-derived diffusion imaging data to investigate whether it would be possible to identify neural biomarkers of a behavioral intervention among people diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The corpus callosum has been linked to cognitive processing and callosal abnormalities have been previously found in people diagnosed with ASD. We used a case-control design to evaluate the association between the type of intervention people diagnosed with ASD had previously received and their current white matter integrity in the corpus callosum. Twenty-six children and adolescents with ASD, with and without a history of parent-managed behavioral intervention, underwent an MRI scan with a diffusion data acquisition sequence. We conducted tract-based spatial statistics and a region of interest analysis. The fractional anisotropy values (believed to indicate white matter integrity) in the posterior corpus callosum was significantly different across cases (exposed to parent-managed behavioral intervention) and controls (not exposed to parent-managed behavioral intervention). The effect was modulated by the intensity of the behavioral intervention according to a dose-response relationship. The current feasibility case-control study provides the basis for estimating the statistical power required for future RCTs in this field. In addition, the study demonstrated the effectiveness of purposely-developed motion control protocols and helped to identify regions of interest candidates. Potential clinical applications of diffusion tensor imaging in the evaluation of treatment outcomes in ASD are discussed."

Mongolia's capital city, Ulaanbaatar, experiences high employee absenteeism during the winter than during other seasons due to the combination of extreme cold and extreme air pollution. We identified direct and indirect costs of absenteeism attributed to air pollution among private-sector employees in Ulaanbaatar. Using a purposive sampling design, we obtained questionnaire data for 1,330 employees working for private-sector companies spanning six economic sectors. We conducted 26 employee focus groups and 20 individual employer in-depth interviews. We used both quantitative and qualitative instruments to characterize the direct and indirect costs of absence due to illnesses attributed to severe air pollution during wintertime. Female employees and employees with a young child at home were more likely to be absent. Respiratory diseases accounted for the majority of reported air pollution-related illnesses. All participants perceived that air pollution adversely affected their health. Individual employee direct costs related to absence totaled 875,000 MNT ($307.10) for an average of three instances of three-day illness-related absences during the winter. This sum included diagnostic and doctor visit-related, medication costs and hospitalization costs. Non-healthcare-related direct cost (transportation) per absence was 50,000₮ ($17.60). Individual indirect costs included the value of lost wages for the typical 3-day absence, amounting to 120,000₮ ($42.10). These total costs to employees, therefore, may amount to as much as 10% of annual income. The majority of sick absences were unpaid. Overall, the cost of wintertime absences is substantial and fell disproportionately on female employees with young children."

We analyzed a cohort for the factors age at diagnosis, place of residence, time to treatment, staging, and molecular classification, using the Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, Pearson's chi-squared test and Cox regression model. The outcome was the vital status at the end of the study. Our analysis showed an OS probability of 0.72 and an SS probability of 0.75. In multivariate analysis, time to treatment within 60 days, stage IV, and triple-negative classification remained independent prognostic factors for both OS [unadjusted hazard ratio (HRp) 1.50 (1.21; 1.86), HRp 16.56 (8.35; 32.85), and HRp 2.73 (1.73; 4.29), respectively] and SS [HRp 1.43 (1.13; 1.81), HRp 20.53 (9.45; 44.56), and HRp 3.14 (1.88; 5.26), respectively]. Better survival was demonstrated for the following patients: those receiving their first treatment after 60 days, with an OS of 52.5 months (51.2; 53.8) and SS of 53.5 months (52.3; 54.7); stage I patients, with an OS of 58.8 months (57.7; 60.0) and SS of 59.2 months (58.1; 60.3); patients without nodal metastasis, with an OS of 54.2 months (53.0; 55.4) and SS of 55.6 months (54.5; 56.7); and patients with luminal A classification, with an OS of 56.8 months (55.0; 58.5) and SS of 57.8 months (56.2; 59.4).

https://openalex.org/W4210653452,"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) are a family of membrane receptors that play important roles in the regulation of various physiological phenomena. LPA receptors (LPA1-6) are members of the class A GPCRs, which transduce a lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) signal across the cell membrane and evoke various responses, including cellular survival, proliferation, differentiation, and migration. The crystal structure of LPA6 revealed a gap between its transmembrane helices (TMs), which is opened toward the membrane side. This led to the proposal of the ""lateral access model,"" in which its lipophilic ligand directly enters the binding pocket through the gap structure at the membrane. In this study, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and Markov state model (MSM) analyses of LPA6 and LPA, to elucidate the long timescale dynamics of the ligand binding process. The results from the 71.4-μs MD simulation suggested that the flexibility of the TMs constituting the gap structure enables the lateral entrance of the ligand, and the key interactions between the receptor and ligand facilitate the transition state of the ligand binding process."
https://openalex.org/W4210680868,"Mobility disability (MD) refers to substantial limitations in life activities that arise because of movement impairments. Although MD is most prevalent in older individuals, it can also affect younger adults. Increasing evidence suggests that inflammation can drive the development of MD and may need to be targeted for MD prevention. Physical exercise has anti-inflammatory properties and has been associated with MD prevention. However, no studies to date have examined whether exercise interventions affect the peripheral inflammatory status in younger adults with MD. To this end, we used blood samples from young and middle-aged adults with MD (N = 38; median age = 34 years) who participated in a 12-week intervention that included aerobic and resistance exercise training. A pre-post assessment of inflammatory biomarkers was conducted in plasma from two timepoints, i.e., before the exercise trial and at follow-up (3–7 days after the last exercise session). We successfully measured 15 inflammatory biomarkers and found that exercise was associated with a significant reduction in levels of soluble fractalkine, transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1), eotaxin-1 and interleukin (IL) 6 (corrected α = 0.004). We also found significant male-specific effects of exercise on (i) increasing IL-16 and (ii) decreasing vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A). In line with our results, previous studies have also found that exercise can reduce levels of TGF-β1, eotaxin-1 and IL-6. However, our finding that exercise reduces plasma levels of fractalkine in younger adults with MD, as well as the sex-dependent findings, have not been previously reported and warrant replication in larger cohorts. Given the suggested role of inflammation in promoting MD development, our study provides additional support for the use of physical exercise as a treatment modality for MD."

Gene stacking technology emerged as an adaptive strategy to combat biotic and abiotic stresses by integrating 2–3 genes simultaneously and at a specific site to avoid variable gene expression at diverse locations. This study explains the development of cotton’s founder transformants to be used as a base line for multiple gene stacking projects. We introduced Cre and PhiC31 mediated recombination sites to specify the locus of incoming genes. CRISPR-Cas9 gene was integrated for developing CRISPR based founder lines of cotton. Cas9 gene along with gRNA was integrated to target Rep (replication) region of cotton leaf curl virus. Replication region of virus was specifically targeted to diminish further proliferation and preventing the virus to develop new strains. To successfully develop these primary transformants, a model transformation system has been optimized with the red color visualization (DS-Red). Following red color transformation system, three baselines with recombination specified site (Rec), targeted replication region (Rep) and Cas9 founder lines have been developed. These founder transformants are useful for developing recombinase mediated and CRISPR/Cas9 based originator lines of cotton. Moreover, these transformants will set up a base system for all the recombinase mediated gene stacking projects."
https://openalex.org/W4210744262,"Both physical inactivity and sedentary behavior are considered modifiable risk factors for chronic diseases and all-cause mortality. Adult office-workers spend most of their working day in sedentary behaviors, so they are particularly at high risk of developed chronic diseases (e.g., cardiovascular diseases, metabolic disorders like diabetes mellitus, …). It seems important to promote behavioral changes that could prevent or delay metabolic disease development. Evidence supports the use of exercise programs, however, to date there are several knowledge gaps and inconsistencies in the literature regarding the effects of Combined Training (i.e., aerobic plus resistance training) in sedentary healthy adults. This paper outlines an RCT designed to evaluate the effects of a 16-week combined training program on biochemical and immune markers of metabolic disease, lung function, salivary stress hormones and subjective quality of life (primary outcomes), as well as on body composition and physical fitness (secondary outcomes) in sedentary middle-aged office-workers. Furthermore, we aimed to assess the associations between the changes promoted by the exercise program and the different variables studied.This is a single-blinded two-arm RCT with parallel groups. A minimum of healthy 40 office-workers aged 40-64 years will be recruited to engage in a 16-week intervention study. After baseline assessments, participants will be randomized to one of the two groups: (1) combined training group or (2) control group. Baseline assessments will be repeated after 8 weeks of intervention (mid-testing) and upon completion of the intervention (post-testing).This RCT involves a multi-disciplinary approach and seems to be a relevant contribution to understanding the potential role of combined training in improving the metabolic profile, lung function, stress, and quality of life in adults. The results can provide important insights for clinical recommendations and for the optimization of strategies to prevent metabolic disorders in adults with sedentary jobs.This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (registration number: NCT04868240; date of registration April 30, 2021)."
https://openalex.org/W4210813006,"As prevalence of multimorbidity and polypharmacy rise, health care systems must respond to these challenges. Data is needed from general practice regarding the impact of age, number of chronic illnesses and medications on specific metrics of healthcare utilisation.This was a retrospective study of general practices in a university-affiliated education and research network, consisting of 72 practices. Records from a random sample of 100 patients aged 50 years and over who attended each participating practice in the previous two years were analysed. Through manual record searching, data were collected on patient demographics, number of chronic illnesses and medications, numbers of attendances to the general practitioner (GP), practice nurse, home visits and referrals to a hospital doctor. Attendance and referral rates were expressed per person-years for each demographic variable and the ratio of attendance to referral rate was also calculated.Of the 72 practices invited to participate, 68 (94%) accepted, providing complete data on a total of 6603 patients' records and 89,667 consultations with the GP or practice nurse; 50.1% of patients had been referred to hospital in the previous two years. The attendance rate to general practice was 4.94 per person per year and the referral rate to the hospital was 0.6 per person per year, giving a ratio of over eight attendances for every referral. Increasing age, number of chronic illnesses and number of medications were associated with increased attendance rates to the GP and practice nurse and home visits but did not significantly increase the ratio of attendance to referral rate.As age, morbidity and number of medications rise, so too do all types of consultations in general practice. However, the rate of referral remains relatively stable. General practice must be supported to provide person centred care to an ageing population with rising rates of multi-morbidity and polypharmacy."
https://openalex.org/W4225497278,"The temporal relationship between work-life balance/imbalance, occupational burnout, and poor mental health outcomes have been widely explored. Little has been forthcoming on cognitive functioning among those with work-life imbalance. This study aimed to explore the rate of work-life imbalance and the variation in neuropsychological functioning. The relationship between affective ranges (anxiety and depressive symptoms) and work-life balance was also explored. The target population in this study are Omani nationals who were referred for psychometric evaluation. The study employs neuropsychology measures tapping into attention and concentration, learning and remembering, processing speed, and executive functioning. Subjective measures of cognitive decline and affective ranges were also explored. A total of 168 subjects (75.3% of the responders) were considered to be at a work-life imbalance. Multivariate analysis showed that demographic and neuropsychological variables were significant risk factors for work-life imbalance including age and the presence of anxiety disorder. Furthermore, participants indicating work-life imbalance were more likely to report cognitive decline on indices of attention, concentration, learning, and remembering. This study reveals that individuals with work-life imbalance might dent the integrity of cognition including attention and concentration, learning and remembering, executive functioning, and endorsed case-ness for anxiety."

High reproducibility was demonstrated using repeated questionnaires on 30 patients two weeks after the first interview. Conclusion The Serbian version of the FACT-C was demonstrated to have satisfactory applicability, reliability and validity in Serbian patients with colorectal cancer. It can be considered as a valid colorectal cancer specific health related quality of life tool for the Serbian population."
https://openalex.org/W4210307328,"Bullying constitutes a serious risk factor for the psychosocial adjustment of young people in both the general population and minority groups. Among minorities, international adoptees are likely to show a specific vulnerability to the experience of being bullied, moderated by specific risk and protective factors. This study aimed to investigate the association between adoptees' experience of bullying victimization and their psychosocial adjustment, and to explore the moderating role of adoptive identity and reflected minority categorization. An online, anonymous self-report questionnaire was completed by 140 adolescents (13-17 years), who were internationally adopted by Italian families. Findings showed that being victimized was associated with higher levels of emotional and behavioral difficulties, but that the strength of this relation varied according to the levels of adoptive identity and reflected minority categorization. Specifically, victimization was found to have a more detrimental and negative impact on psychological adjustment for adoptees who were highly identified with the adoptive group, and reported to be less perceived by others as members of the minority group. Results are discussed in relation to recommendations for further research as well as for professionals working with internationally adopted adolescents."
https://openalex.org/W4210311750,"This mixed-method quasi-experimental study examined whether metaconceptual grammar teaching impacts on (a) students’ L1 grammatical understanding, (b) their ‘blind’ use of grammatical concepts and (c) their preference of using explicit grammatical concepts over everyday concepts in explaining grammatical problems. Previous research, involving single group pre-postintervention designs, found positive effects for metaconceptual interventions on secondary school students’ grammatical reasoning ability, although a negative side effect seemed to be that some students started using grammatical concepts ‘blindly’ (i.e., in an inaccurate way). While there are thus important clues that metaconceptual grammar teaching may lead to increased grammatical understanding, there is a great need for more robust empirical research. The current study, involving 196 Dutch 14-year old pre-university students, is a methodological improvement of previous work, adopting a switching replications design. Bayesian multivariate analyses indicate medium to large effects from the metaconceptual intervention on students’ grammatical understanding. The study found a similar effect of the intervention on students’ ability to use explicit grammatical concepts over everyday concepts in tackling grammatical problems. No evidence for increased ‘blind’ concept use as a negative byproduct of the intervention was found. Additional qualitative analyses of in-intervention tasks provided further evidence for the effectiveness of metaconceptual interventions, and seemed to indicate that cases of blind concept use, rather than being a negative side effect, might actually be part of a gradual process of students’ growing understanding of grammatical (meta)concepts. We discuss these findings in relation to previous work and conclude that linguistic metaconcepts can improve L1 grammatical understanding."
https://openalex.org/W4210322616,"Restoring arm and hand function has been indicated by individuals with tetraplegia as one of the most important factors for regaining independence. The overall goal of our research is to develop assistive technologies that allow individuals with tetraplegia to control functional reaching movements. This study served as an initial step toward our overall goal by assessing the feasibility of using eye movements to control the motion of an effector in an experimental environment. We aimed to understand how additional motor requirements placed on the eyes affected eye-hand coordination during functional reaching. We were particularly interested in how eye fixation error was affected when the sensory and motor functions of the eyes were entangled due to the additional motor responsibility. We recorded participants' eye and hand movements while they reached for targets on a monitor. We presented a cursor at the participant's point of gaze position which can be thought of as being similar to the control of an assistive robot arm. To measure eye fixation error, we used an offline filter to extract eye fixations from the raw eye movement data. We compared the fixations to the locations of the targets presented on the monitor. The results show that not only are humans able to use eye movements to direct the cursor to a desired location (1.04 ± 0.15 cm), but they can do so with error similar to that of the hand (0.84 ± 0.05 cm). In other words, despite the additional motor responsibility placed on the eyes during direct eye-movement control of an effector, the ability to coordinate functional reaching movements was unaffected. The outcomes of this study support the efficacy of using the eyes as a direct command input for controlling movement."
https://openalex.org/W4210593091,"The calcium ion channel ORAI1 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for the Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19)-associated pneumonia, and a pharmacological inhibitor of ORAI1 has now reached clinical trials for severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Whether ORAI1 itself is associated with an increased risk for severe COVID-19 presentation is still unknown. Here, we employed genetic association analysis to investigate the potential association of host genetic polymorphisms of ORAI1 with the risk of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and its associated COVID-19 fatality in UK Biobank participants from white British background. The analysis showed no significant association between ORAI1 variants and COVID-19 positivity or fatality, despite the well-established roles of ORAI1 in immune response and inflammation and the success of ORAI1 inhibition in clinical trials. Our results suggest that the host genetic polymorphisms of ORAI1 are unlikely to be implicated in the broad variability in symptoms severity among afflicted patients."
https://openalex.org/W4210598588,"Introduction Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) now constitute major cause of morbidity and mortality in middle and low income countries including Nigeria. One of the major efforts at controlling CVDs in Nigeria includes expanding universal access to care through the primary healthcare (PHC) system. The study was to assess essential medicines and technology for control of hypertension in PHC facilities in Ebonyi Nigeria. Methods The study used mixed method cross-sectional survey to assess availability, affordability and accessibility of essential medicines and technology in 45 facilities and among their patients with hypertension (145). Results Most of the PHC facilities (71.1%) assessed were rural. The heads of facilities were mainly community health extension workers (86.7%). One (2.2%) facility had a pharmacy technician. All facilities had been supervised by the regulatory authority in the last one year. Out of 15 anti-hypertensive drugs assessed, 10 were available in some facilities (2.2%–44.4%) but essential drug availability was low (&lt;80%). Only mercury sphygmomanometers were available in all facilities with 82.2% functioning. Stethoscopes were available in all facilities and 95.6% were functional. Glucometers were present in 20.0% of facilities and were all functional. All the respondents (100.0%) reported they could not afford their anti-hypertensive drugs. Median monthly income was 8,000 Nigerian Naira (range = 2,000–52,000). Median monthly cost of anti-hypertensive drugs was 3,500 Naira (range = 1,500–10,000). For 99 (68.3%) of the respondents, the facilities were accessible. Median cost of transportation for care was 400 Naira (range = 100–2,000). Conclusion Gaps still exist in the provision of hypertension control services in PHC facilities in Ebonyi State, Nigeria. The essential drugs were not always available, and cost of the drugs were still a challenge to the patients. There is urgent need to expand health insurance coverage to rural communities to ameliorate the catastrophic out-of-pocket health expenditures and improve control of CVDs."
https://openalex.org/W4210782702,"The present study was carried out to investigate food habits and associated risk factors of depressed patients with cardiovascular disease in Riyadh city, Saudi Arabia. Depressed and healthy females (n = 30 each) and males (n = 30 each) aged 18–65 years were involved in this study. Sociodemographic, anthropometric proxies, and nutritional status were evaluated. Cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) levels of respondents’ blood were determined. The respondents were varied according to demographic factors and anthropometric proxies. The majority of depressed males had higher values than healthy ones. The student t-test analysis showed that the average daily intake of fat especially saturated fat, by depressed respondents was higher than that of the healthy ones as well as the dietary requirement intake (DRI). The analysis of respondents’ blood showed that the number of depressed females had higher abnormal HDL-c than males, who were observed to have an abnormal level of cholesterol and triglycerides. The correlation of daily nutrient intake and depression duration, depression severity, and age showed that the nutrients responsible for the extension and severity of depression were intake of food rich in dietary fat. Factors including demographics daily nutrient intake appeared to be associated with depression."
