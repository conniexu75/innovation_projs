The link between Schumann resonance and temperature is lightning flash rate, which increases nonlinearly with temperature in the interaction between deep convection and ice microphysics."
https://openalex.org/W2059967334,"The production and spectroscopic characterization of fullerene-encapsulated metal-atom clusters is reported. In particular, both solution and solid-state electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of Sc(3)C(82) have been obtained. ScC(82) also gives an EPR spectrum, but Sc2Cn species-the most abundant metallofullerenes in the mass spectrum-are EPR-silent even though Sc(2) is EPR-active in a rare-gas matrix at 4.2 K. The results suggest that the three scandium atoms in Sc(3)C(82) form an equilateral triangle-as was previously suggested for Sc(3) molecules isolated in a cryogenic rare-gas matrix. The spectrum of ScC(82) has features similar to those found earlier for LaC(82) and YC(82), suggesting that it can also be described as a +3 metal cation within a -3 fullerene radical anion. An implication of this work is that production of macroscopic quantities of clustercontaining fullerenes may make possible the fabrication of exotic new structures with regular arrays of metal-atom clusters isolated in fullerene molecules, resulting in a new type of host/guest nanostructured material."

https://openalex.org/W2015461965,"Sizable single crystals of C(6O) have been synthesized and doped with potassium. Above the superconducting transition temperature T(c), the electrical resistivity p(T) displays a classic metal-like temperature dependence. The transition to the superconducting state at T(c) = 19.8 K is extremely sharp, with a transition width DeltaT < 200 mK. In contrast to transport behavior of doped polycrystalline and granular thin films, no anomalous fluctuations are observed near T(c) in single crystal specimens."

https://openalex.org/W2045540305,"The hydroxyl radical (OH) controls the lifetimes and therefore the concentrations of many important chemical species in Earth's lower atmosphere including several greenhouse and ozone-depleting species. Two completely different measurement techniques were used in an informal intercomparison to determine tropospheric OH concentrations at Fritz Peak concentrations by chemical analysis; the other used spectroscopic absorption on a long path. The intercomparison showed that ambient OH concentrations can now be measured with sufficient sensitivity to provide a test for photochemical models, with the derived OH concentrations agreeing well under both polluted and clean atmospheric conditions. Concentrations of OH on all days were significantly lower than model predictions, perhaps indicating the presence of an unknown scavenger. The change in OH concentration from early morning to noon on a clear day was found to be only a factor of 2."

That this problem is now being recognized is shown by the number of bills that were introduced in Congress in 1974, culminating in the Solar Heating and Cooling Act of 1974 (7). An examination of the incentives for technology utilization in the conceptual framework of TDS (as shown in Fig. 4) reveals the following: 1) Incentives must be applied to each component of the TDS. 2) Different components in the TDS require different incentives. 3) Although information exists concerning a wide variety of incentives that are currently being used by various federal agencies to stimulate technology utilization, most of this information is in the form of raw data compiled by the respective agencies and a substantial effort will be required to collect, compile, and evaluate them. 4) All the components of a TDS must be activated if technology utilization is to occur on a self-sustaining basis. This makes experimental verification of a particular incentive on a particular component difficult. 5) A federal agency concerned with technology utilization can and should assume the responsibility for identifying all the components of the required TDS, devising incentives for each component and testing them to ensure their effectiveness. Where a TDS does not exist, the federal agency may have to assume the responsibility of creating one. The scope of this effort in many cases may transcend the present authority of the agency, and congressional action may be required to remedy this shortcoming."

https://openalex.org/W2082693187,"Plants may be affected by relatively low concentrations of pollutants and can serve as a kind of early warning system for the buildup of noxious chemicals in the air. The pollutants discussed were ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN). These pollutants produce leaf damage and injure grapes, navel oranges, and alfalfa. Many of these oxidants are produced by automobile exhaust. There is evidence that combinations of the pollutants can produce greater effects than individuals, if in the same concentration. The use of antioxidants to retard the action of oxidants is considered. Since chemical treatments are all expensive, use of pollution-resistant plants appears to be a more economical approach. There are marked variations in the susceptibilities of different plant strains to the effects of a given pollutant. 1 figure."

https://openalex.org/W2095566763,"A hermaphroditic sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, with three ovotestes and two testes is described. Neither cleaving eggs nor embryos were found in corpore. Fertilization inter se gave normal larvae. The specimen was collected from Palos Verdes, Calif., a region which has yielded an unusually large number of hermaphroditic S. purpuratus."
