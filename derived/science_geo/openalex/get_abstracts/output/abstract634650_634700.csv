Yang et al. created a nanoporous graphene membrane reinforced by a network of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) to provide mechanical stability (see the Perspective by Mi). The SWNT network also stopped the propagation of cracks in the graphene, effectively localizing the damage to a small area defined by a cell in the carbon nanotube mesh. The membranes showed high water flux rates as well as a high rejection rate for most ions. Science , this issue p. 1057 ; see also p. 1033"

Maini Rekdal et al. found that different species of bacterium are involved in l -dopa metabolism (see the Perspective by O'Neill). Tyrosine decarboxylase (TDC) from Enterococcus faecalis and dopamine dehydroxylase (Dadh) from Eggerthella lenta A2 sequentially metabolized l -dopa into m -tyramine. The microbial l -dopa decarboxylase can be inactivated by ( S )-α-fluoromethyltyrosine (AFMT), which indicates possibilities for developing combinations of Parkinson's drugs to circumvent microbial inactivation.

Jäck et al. used scanning tunneling spectroscopy to observe MZMs in a similar heterostructure. In their devices, the TI is a hexagonal bismuth island placed on top of a layer of superconducting niobium. The bismuth island had topological boundary hinge states on every other edge of the hexagon. Placing a cluster of iron atoms on the hinge generated a zero-bias peak characteristic of MZMs at the interface between the cluster and the hinge state. Science , this issue p. 1255"
https://openalex.org/W2950509486,"The paraventricular thalamus (PVT) is an interface for brain reward circuits, with input signals arising from structures, such as prefrontal cortex and hypothalamus, that are broadcast to downstream limbic targets. However, the precise synaptic connectivity, activity, and function of PVT circuitry for reward processing are unclear. Here, using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging, we find that PVT neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens (PVT-NAc) develop inhibitory responses to reward-predictive cues coding for both cue-reward associative information and behavior. The multiplexed activity in PVT-NAc neurons is directed by opposing activity patterns in prefrontal and lateral hypothalamic afferent axons. Further, we find that prefrontal cue encoding may maintain accurate cue-reward processing, as optogenetic disruption of this encoding induced long-lasting effects on downstream PVT-NAc cue responses and behavioral cue discrimination. Together, these data reveal that PVT-NAc neurons act as an interface for reward processing by integrating relevant inputs to accurately inform reward-seeking behavior."

They can quickly switch from glassy to crystalline using a thermal pulse and then lock in that structure for a long time at lower temperature. Zalden et al. probed the underlying atomic structure of two phase-change materials during this switching using ultrafast x-rays and simulations (see the Perspective by Rao et al. ). A liquid-liquid phase transition in both materials allowed fast switching at high temperatures. The lower-temperature glass locks in the structure, allowing for long-term memory storage.

https://openalex.org/W2952908749,"The explore-exploit dilemma refers to the challenge of deciding when to forego immediate rewards and explore new opportunities that could lead to greater rewards in the future. While motivational neural circuits facilitate learning based on past choices and outcomes, it is unclear whether they also support computations relevant for deciding when to explore. We recorded neural activity in the amygdala and ventral striatum of rhesus macaques as they solved a task that required them to balance novelty-driven exploration with exploitation of what they had already learned. Using a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) model to quantify explore-exploit trade-offs, we identified that the ventral striatum and amygdala differ in how they represent the immediate value of exploitative choices and the future value of exploratory choices. These findings show that subcortical motivational circuits are important in guiding explore-exploit decisions."

The alga defends itself from predators using peptide toxins decorated with fatty acids, called kahalalides. Zan et al. wondered if a third party was involved in toxin production (see the Perspective by Mascuch and Kubanek). Within the alga, a species of bacterium with a very reduced genome was discovered to be a factory for the nonribosomal assembly of a family of kahalalides. The authors elucidated the pathways for generating this chemical diversity. It seems that the sea slug not only tolerates the toxins but, to protect itself from being eaten by fish, grazes on the alga to accumulate kahalalide.

https://openalex.org/W2949819557,"Background Adolescents have physical, social and psychological characteristics that are different from adults. Adolescent pregnancy results in pregnancy and childbirth complications- an area neglected in developing countries like Ethiopia. This study, therefore, was conducted to assess the adverse neonatal outcomes of adolescent pregnancy in Northwest Ethiopia. Methods Institutional-based study was conducted in East Gojjam zone, Northwest Ethiopia. A total of 374 adolescent (15–19 years) and 760 adult (20–34 years) women were included in this study. Data were collected among women who came to randomly selected health facilities in East Gojjam zone. Data were collected by trained research assistants using a structured data collection questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, chi-square test, and Student's t-tests were utilized. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis were employed to adjust for confounding factors of adverse neonatal outcomes. Statistical significance was declared when the p-value was less than 0.05. Results Higher proportion of adolescent than adult women were from rural area (57.2% vs 44.7%), were not married (5.1% vs 1.7%), were pregnant for the first time (91.7% vs 34.1%), didn’t attend antenatal care (ANC) follow-up (12% vs 4.5%), and had late initiation of ANC follow-up. After adjusting for known confounding factors, the odds of low birth weight (LBW) was higher among adolescents than adult women (AOR 2.14; 95% CI, 1.36, 3.36, p-value = 0.001). Similarly, the odds of preterm birth was higher among adolescents than adult women (AOR 1.65; 95% CI, 1.09, 2.49, p-value = 0.017). There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of low Apgar score at first and five minutes after birth and neonatal Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission between babies born from adolescent and adult women. Conclusions Adolescent women were less likely to receive ANC service. Babies born from adolescent women are at higher odds of adverse neonatal outcomes like LBW and preterm birth than babies born from adult women. Use of community- and health facility-based intervention programs that can prevent adolescent pregnancy and reduce adverse neonatal outcomes among adolescent girls is recommended."
https://openalex.org/W2952971802,"The nosocomial pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii acquired clinical significance due to the rapid development of its multi-drug resistant (MDR) phenotype. A. baumannii strains have the ability to colonize several ecological niches including soil, water, and animals, including humans. They also survive under extremely harsh environmental conditions thriving on rare and recalcitrant carbon compounds. However, the molecular basis behind such extreme adaptability of A. baumannii is unknown. We have therefore determined the complete genome sequence of A. baumannii DS002, which was isolated from agricultural soils, and compared it with 78 complete genome sequences of A. baumannii strains having complete information on the source of their isolation. Interestingly, the genome of A. baumannii DS002 showed high similarity to the genome of A. baumannii SDF isolated from the body louse. The environmental and clinical strains, which do not share a monophyletic origin, showed the existence of a strain-specific unique gene pool that supports niche-specific survival. The strains isolated from infected samples contained a genetic repertoire with a unique gene pool coding for iron acquisition machinery, particularly those required for the biosynthesis of acinetobactin. Interestingly, these strains also contained genes required for biofilm formation. However, such gene sets were either partially or completely missing in the environmental isolates, which instead harbored genes required for alternate carbon catabolism and a TonB-dependent transport system involved in the acquisition of iron via siderophores or xenosiderophores."
https://openalex.org/W2951951558,"Discoveries of bacterial communities in environments that previously have been described as sterile have in recent years radically challenged the view of these environments. In this study we aimed to use 16S rRNA sequencing to describe the composition and temporal stability of the bacterial microbiota in bovine milk from healthy udder quarters, an environment previously believed to be sterile. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene is a technique commonly used to describe bacterial composition and diversity in various environments. With the increased use of 16S rRNA gene sequencing, awareness of methodological pitfalls such as biases and contamination has increased although not in equal amount. Evaluation of the composition and temporal stability of the microbiota in 288 milk samples was largely hampered by background contamination, despite careful and aseptic sample processing. Sequencing of no template control samples, positive control samples, with defined levels of bacteria, and 288 milk samples with various levels of bacterial growth, revealed that the data was influenced by contaminating taxa, primarily Methylobacterium. We observed an increasing impact of contamination with decreasing microbial biomass where the contaminating taxa became dominant in samples with less than 104 bacterial cells per mL. By applying a contamination filtration on the sequence data, the amount of sequences was substantially reduced but only a minor impact on number of identified taxa and by culture known endogenous taxa was observed. This suggests that data filtration can be useful for identifying biologically relevant associations in milk microbiota data."
https://openalex.org/W2949887950,"Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a public health problem that affects millions of women worldwide and can occur during both pregnancy and the perinatal period. We aimed to evaluate if the experience of psychological and physical intimate partner violence (IPV) adversely affects pregnancy outcomes. We established a cohort of 779 consecutive mothers receiving antenatal care including ultrasound and giving birth in 15 public hospitals, drawn using cluster sampling of all obstetric services in Andalusia, Spain (February-June 2010). Trained midwives gathered IPV data using the Index of Spouse Abuse validated in the Spanish language (score ranges: 0–100, higher scores reflect more severe IPV; cut-offs: physical IPV = 10, psychological IPV = 25). Socio-demographic data, including lack of kin support, maternal outcomes, and hospitalization were collected. Multivariate logistic regression estimated adjusted odds ratios (AOR), with 95% confidence intervals (CI), of the relationship between psychological and physical IPV and maternal outcomes, controlling for socio-demographic characteristics. Response rate was 92.2%. Psychological IPV, reported by 21.0% (n = 151), was associated significantly with urinary tract infection (127 (23%) vs 56 (37%); AOR = 1.9; 95%CI = 1.2–3.0), vaginal infection (30 (5%) vs 20 (13%); AOR = 2.4; 95%CI = 1.2–4.7) and spontaneous preterm labour (32 (6%) vs 19 (13%); AOR = 2.2; 95%CI = 1.1–4.5). Physical IPV, reported by 3.6% (n = 26), was associated with antenatal hospitalizations (134 (19%) vs 11 (42%); AOR = 2.6; 95%CI = 1.0–7.1). Lack of kin support was associated with spontaneous preterm labour (AOR = 4.7; 95%CI = 1.7–12.8). Mothers with IPV have higher odds of complications. Obstetricians, gynaecologists and midwives should act as active screeners, particularly of the undervalued psychological IPV, to reduce or remedy its effects."
https://openalex.org/W2951404889,"The quadriceps angle (Q angle), formed between the quadriceps muscles and the patella tendon, is considered clinically as a very important parameter which displays the biomechanical effect of the quadriceps muscle on the knee, and it is also regarded a crucial factor for the proper posture and movement of the knee patella. The Q angle is routinely and regularly used as an assessment parameter during the diagnosis of many knee-related problems, including the anterior knee pain, osteoarthritis, and degenerative knee disorders. This study had been conducted so as to measure the normal Q angle values range in the Arab nationalities and determine the correlation between Q angle values and several body parameters, including gender, height, weight, dominant side, and the condylar distance of the femur. The study includes 500 healthy young Arab students from the Yarmouk University and Jordan University of Science and Technology. The Q angle of those volunteers was measured using a universal manual Goniometer with the subjects in the upright weight-bearing position. It was found that Q angle was greater in young women than young men. Also, the analysis of the data revealed an insignificant increase in the dominant side of the Q angle. In addition, the Q angle was significantly higher in the taller people of both sexes. However, the Q angle did not present any considerable correlation with weight in the study population; conversely, it was clearly observed that there was a link with the condylar distance of the femur in both sexes. It was also noticed that the Q angle increased remarkably when there was an increase in the condylar distance. Consequently, it turned out that the gender, height, and the condylar distance were momentous factors that had impact on the Q angle in our study samples. However, weight and dominancy factors did not show to have any influence on the values in our study."
https://openalex.org/W2950203828,"Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) based on visual evoked potentials (VEPs) allow high communication speeds and accuracies. The fastest speeds can be achieved if targets are identified in a synchronous way (i.e., after a pre-set time period the system will produce a command output). The duration a target needs to be fixated on until the system classifies an output command affects the overall system performance. Hence, extracting a data window dedicated for the classification is of critical importance for VEP-based BCIs. Secondly, unintentional fixation on a target could easily lead to its selection. For the practical usability of BCI applications it is desirable to distinguish between intentional and unintentional fixations. This can be achieved by using threshold-based target identification methods. The study explores personalized dynamic classification time windows for threshold-based time synchronous VEP BCIs. The proposed techniques were tested employing the SSVEP and the c-VEP paradigm. Spelling performance was evaluated using an 8-target dictionary-supported BCI utilizing an n-gram word prediction model. The performance of twelve healthy participants was assessed with the information transfer rate (ITR) and accuracy. All participants completed sentence spelling tasks, reaching average accuracies of 94% and 96.3% for the c-VEP and the SSVEP paradigm, respectively. Average ITRs around 57 bpm were achieved for both paradigms."
https://openalex.org/W2950781735,"The zinc finger e-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) transcription factor is a master regulator of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), and of the reverse mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) processes. ZEB1 plays an integral role in mediating cell state transitions during cell lineage specification, wound healing and disease. EMT/MET are characterized by distinct changes in molecular and cellular phenotype that are generally context-independent. Posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (PPCD), associated with ZEB1 insufficiency, provides a new biological context in which to understand and evaluate the classic EMT/MET paradigm. PPCD is characterized by a cadherin-switch and transition to an epithelial-like transcriptomic and cellular phenotype, which we study in a cell-based model of PPCD generated using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated ZEB1 knockout in corneal endothelial cells (CEnCs). Transcriptomic and functional studies support the hypothesis that CEnC undergo a MET-like transition in PPCD, termed endothelial to epithelial transition (EnET), and lead to the conclusion that EnET may be considered a corollary to the classic EMT/MET paradigm."
https://openalex.org/W2952583190,"Integrating elements from life tables into population models within a matrix framework has been an underutilized method of describing host–parasitoid population dynamics. This type of modeling is useful in describing demographically-structured populations and in identifying points in the host developmental timeline susceptible to parasitic attack. We apply this approach to investigate the effect of parasitism by the Asian parasitoid Aphelinus certus on its host, the soybean aphid (Aphis glycines). We present a matrix population model with coupled equations that are analogous to a Nicholson–Bailey model. To parameterize the model, we conducted several bioassays outlining host and parasitoid life history and supplemented these studies with data obtained from the literature. Analysis of the model suggests that, at a parasitism rate of 0.21 d−1, A. certus is capable of maintaining aphid densities below economically damaging levels in 31.0% of simulations. Several parameters—parasitoid lifespan, colonization timeline, host developmental stage, and mean daily temperature—were also shown to markedly influence the overall dynamics of the system. These results suggest that A. certus might provide a valuable service in agroecosystems by suppressing soybean aphid populations at relatively low levels of parasitism. Our results also support the use of A. certus within a dynamic action threshold framework in order to maximize the value of biological control in pest management programs."
https://openalex.org/W2950933695,"Background The exposure to extreme ambient temperatures has been reported to increase mortality, although less is known about its impact on morbidity. The analysis of temporal changes in temperature-health associations has also focused on mortality with no studies on hospitalizations worldwide. Studies on temporal variations can provide insights on changes in susceptibility or on effectiveness of public health interventions. We aimed to analyse the effects of temperature on cause-specific hospital admissions in Spain and assess temporal changes using two periods, the second one characterized by the introduction of a heat health prevention plan. Methods Daily counts of non-scheduled hospital admissions for cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and respiratory diseases and daily maximum temperature were obtained for each Spanish province for the period 1997–2013. The relationship between temperature and hospitalizations was estimated using distributed lag non-linear models. We compared the risk of hospitalization due to temperatures (cold, heat and extreme heat) in two periods (1997–2002 and 2004–2013). Results Cold temperatures were associated with increased risk of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and respiratory hospital admissions. Hot temperatures were only associated with higher hospital admissions for respiratory causes while hospitalizations for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases did not increase with heat. There was a small reduction in heat-related respiratory admissions in period 2. Whereas cold-related hospitalizations for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases increased in period 2, a significant reduction for respiratory hospitalizations was reported. Conclusions Our results suggested that heat had an adverse impact on hospital admissions for respiratory diseases, while cold increased the risk of the three studied cause-specific hospitalizations. Public health interventions should also focus on morbidity effects of temperature."
https://openalex.org/W2951714618,"Advances in machine learning and deep learning methods, together with the increasing availability of large-scale pharmacological, genomic, and chemical datasets, have created opportunities for identifying potentially useful relationships within biochemical networks. Knowledge embedding models have been found to have value in detecting knowledge-based correlations among entities, but little effort has been made to apply them to networks of biochemical entities. This is because such networks tend to be unbalanced and sparse, and knowledge embedding models do not work well on them. However, to some extent, the shortcomings of knowledge embedding models can be compensated for if they are used in association with graph embedding. In this paper, we combine knowledge embedding and graph embedding to represent biochemical entities and their relations as dense and low-dimensional vectors. We build a cascade learning framework which incorporates semantic features from the knowledge embedding model, and graph features from the graph embedding model, to score the probability of linking. The proposed method performs noticeably better than the models with which it is compared. It predicted links and entities with an accuracy of 93%, and its average hits@10 score has an average of 8.6% absolute improvement compared with original knowledge embedding model, 1.1% to 9.7% absolute improvement compared with other knowledge and graph embedding algorithm. In addition, we designed a meta-path algorithm to detect path relations in the biomedical network. Case studies further verify the value of the proposed model in finding potential relationships between diseases, drugs, genes, treatments, etc. Amongst the findings of the proposed model are the suggestion that VDR (vitamin D receptor) may be linked to prostate cancer. This is backed by evidence from medical databases and published research, supporting the suggestion that our proposed model could be of value to biomedical researchers."

We present close-range remote-sensing observations of the main rings from the Cassini spacecraft. We find detailed sculpting of the rings by embedded masses, and banded texture belts throughout the rings. Saturn-orbiting streams of material impact the F ring. There are fine-scaled correlations among optical depth, spectral properties, and temperature in the B ring, but anticorrelations within strong density waves in the A ring. There is no spectral distinction between plateaux and the rest of the C ring, whereas the region outward of the Keeler gap is spectrally distinct from nearby regions. These results likely indicate that radial stratification of particle physical properties, rather than compositional differences, is responsible for producing these ring structures."
https://openalex.org/W2950896312,"Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a low input, high biomass perennial grass being developed for the bioenergy sector. Upland and lowland cultivars can differ in their responses to insect herbivory. Fall armyworm [FAW; Spodoptera frugiperda JE Smith (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)] is a generalist pest of many plant species and can feed on switchgrass as well. Here, in two different trials, FAW larval mass were significantly reduced when fed on lowland cultivar Kanlow relative to larvae fed on upland cultivar Summer plants after 10 days. Hormone content of plants indicated elevated levels of the plant defense hormone jasmonic acid (JA) and its bioactive conjugate JA-Ile although significant differences were not observed. Conversely, the precursor to JA, 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) levels were significantly different between FAW fed Summer and Kanlow plants raising the possibility of differential signaling by OPDA in the two cultivars. Global transcriptome analysis revealed a stronger response in Kanlow plant relative to Summer plants. Among these changes were a preferential upregulation of several branches of terpenoid and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis in Kanlow plants suggesting that enhanced biosynthesis or accumulation of antifeedants could have negatively impacted FAW larval mass gain on Kanlow plants relative to Summer plants. A comparison of the switchgrass-FAW RNA-Seq dataset to those from maize-FAW and switchgrass-aphid interactions revealed that key components of plant responses to herbivory, including induction of JA biosynthesis, key transcription factors and JA-inducible genes were apparently conserved in switchgrass and maize. In addition, these data affirm earlier studies with FAW and aphids that the cultivar Kanlow can provide useful genetics for the breeding of switchgrass germplasm with improved insect resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2953072501,"The beneficial effect of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on wound healing is mostly attributed to a trophic effect that promotes angiogenesis. Whether MSCs can contribute to the formation of new blood vessels by direct differentiation is still controversial. Pelvic floor dysfunction (PFD) is a group of disorders that negatively affect the quality of women's lives. Traditional vaginal surgical repair provides disappointing anatomical outcome. Stem cell transplantation may be used to supplement surgery and improve its outcome. Here we aimed to examine the engraftment, survival, differentiation and angiogenic effect of transplanted MSCs in a vaginal injury rat model. MSCs were obtained from the bone marrow of Sprague Drawley (SD) rats, expanded and characterized in vitro. The MSCs expressed CD90 and CD29, did not express CD45, CD34, CD11b and CD31 and could differentiate into osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic lineages. Cells were labeled with either PKH-26 or GFP and transplanted systemically or locally to female SD rats, just after a standardized vaginal incision was made. Engraftment after local transplantation was less efficient at all-time points compared to systemic administration. In the systemically transplanted animal group, MSCs migrated to the injury site and were present in the healed vagina for at least 30 days. Both systemic and local MSCs transplantation promoted host angiogenesis. Systemically transplanted MSCs created new vascular-like structures by direct differentiation into endothelium. These findings pave the way to further studies of the potential role of MSCs transplantation in improving surgical outcome in women with PFD."
https://openalex.org/W2949063724,"One of the biggest challenges of health care systems worldwide is the increasing number of pathogenic bacteria resistant to a growing number of antibiotics. In this respect, class 1 integrons which are part of mobile genetic elements can confer several phenotypes including resistance to a broad range of antibiotic classes, heavy metals and biocides. They are linked to common resistance genes and have penetrated pathogenic and commensal bacteria likewise. Therefore its relative prevalence can be a proxy for antimicrobial resistance and anthropogenic pollution. Household environments are areas with a high influx of bacteria from humans, animals and foods, and biocides and detergents are frequently used. In this study we aimed to investigate the relative prevalence of class 1 integrons in household environments, in relation to the number of antibiotic and benzalkonium chloride resistant phenotypes of a sample point, for the validation of the relative prevalence of class 1 integrons as a screening tool for multi-resistance. Kitchen sink and bathroom sink U-bends, dishwasher, washing machines and toothbrushes of 28 households were probed. Copies /mL of class 1 integron integrase gene and 16SrDNA gene were determined by qPCR and bacteria of the respective sample were isolated on ampicillin selective agar plates, followed by the determination of the species and phenotypic resistance profiles. The relative prevalence of class 1 integrons in relation to 16SrDNA was calculated and correlated to phenotypic resistance. Our findings show a high relative prevalence of class 1 integrons in water reticulation systems of household environments and in particular shower U-bends. Furthermore, prevalence of class 1 integrons correlates strongly (rs = 0.95) with total phenotypic resistance at a sample point and suggest that a standardized assay determining the relative prevalence of class 1 integrons could be used as a useful screening tool in the assessment of multi-resistance in environmental samples."
https://openalex.org/W2949454002,"Multi-locus sequencing typing (MLST) is widely used to monitor the phylogeny of microbial outbreaks. However, several strains of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm) with a missing MLST locus (pstS) have recently emerged in Australia, with a few cases also reported in England. Here, we identified similarly distinct strains circulating in two neighbouring hospitals in Scotland. Whole genome sequencing of five VREfm strains isolated from these hospitals identified four pstS-null strains in both hospitals, while the fifth was multi-locus sequence type (ST) 262, which is the first documented in the UK. All five Scottish isolates had an insertion in the tetM gene, which is associated with increased susceptibility to tetracyclines, providing no other tetracycline-resistant gene is present. Such an insertion, which encompasses a dfrG gene and two currently uncharacterised genes, was additionally identified in all tested vanA-type pstS-null VREfm strains (5 English and 68 Australian). Phylogenetic comparison with other VREfm genomes indicates that the four pstS-null Scottish isolates sequenced in this study are more closely related to pstS-null strains from Australia rather than the English pstS-null isolates. Given how rapidly such pstS-null strains have expanded in Australia, the emergence of this clone in Scotland raises concerns for a potential outbreak."
https://openalex.org/W2949959323,"Replacement therapy in severe hemophilia A leads to factor VIII (FVIII) inhibitors in 30% of patients. Factor VIII gene (F8) mutation type, a family history of inhibitors, ethnicity and intensity of treatment are established risk factors, and were included in two published prediction tools based on regression models. Recently investigated immune regulatory genes could also play a part in immunogenicity. Our objective is to identify bio-clinical and genetic markers for FVIII inhibitor development, taking into account potential genetic high order interactions. The study population consisted of 593 and 79 patients with hemophilia A from centers in Bonn and Frankfurt respectively. Data was collected in the European ABIRISK tranSMART database. A subset of 125 severely affected patients from Bonn with reliable information on first treatment was selected as eligible for risk stratification using a hybrid tree-based regression model (GPLTR). In the eligible subset, 58 (46%) patients developed FVIII inhibitors. Among them, 49 (84%) were ""high risk"" F8 mutation type. 19 (33%) had a family history of inhibitors. The GPLTR model, taking into account F8 mutation risk, family history of inhibitors and product type, distinguishes two groups of patients: a high-risk group for immunogenicity, including patients with positive HLA-DRB1*15 and genotype G/A and A/A for IL-10 rs1800896, and a low-risk group of patients with negative HLA-DRB1*15 / HLA-DQB1*02 and T/T or G/T for CD86 rs2681401. We show associations between genetic factors and the occurrence of FVIII inhibitor development in severe hemophilia A patients taking into account for high-order interactions using a generalized partially linear tree-based approach."
https://openalex.org/W2949473464,"The association between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and all-cause mortality is well established but it is unclear if there are differences in mortality risk among the 32 possible MetS combinations. Hence, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the associations between different MetS combinations and its individual components with all-cause mortality, and to examine differences in the association by age and sex.A merged sample of 82,717 adults from 7 U.S. cohorts was used.In our sample, MetS was present in 32% of men, 34% of women, 28% of younger adults (18-65 years) and 62% of older adults (>65 years) with 14,989 deaths over 14.6 ± 7.4 years of follow-up. Risk of all-cause mortality was higher in younger individuals with a greater number of MetS factors present, but in older adults having all 5 MetS factors was the only combination significantly associated with mortality. Regardless of age or sex, elevated blood pressure was the MetS factor most consistently present in MetS combinations that were significantly and most strongly associated with mortality. In fact, elevated blood pressure in the absence of other risk factors was significantly associated with mortality in men (HR, 95% CI = 1.56, 1.33-1.84), women (HR = 1.62, 1.44-1.81) and younger adults (HR = 1.61, 1.45-1.79). Conversely, waist circumference, glucose and triglycerides in isolation were not associated with mortality (p>0.05).In a large U.S. population, different combinations of MetS components vary substantially in their associations with all-cause mortality. Men, women and younger individuals with MetS combinations including elevated blood pressure had stronger associations with greater mortality risk, with minimal associations between MetS and mortality risk in older adults. Thus, we suggest that future algorithms may wish to consider differential weighting of these common metabolic risk factors, particularly in younger populations."
https://openalex.org/W2949608679,"In tasks that demand rapid performance, actions must be executed as efficiently as possible. Theories of expert motor performance such as the motor chunking framework suggest that efficiency is supported by automatization, where many serial actions are automatized into smaller chunks, or groups of commonly co-occuring actions. We use the fast-paced, professional eSport StarCraft 2 as a test case of the explanatory power of the motor chunking framework and assess the importance of chunks in explaining expert performance. To do so, we test three predictions motivated by a simple motor chunking framework. (1) StarCraft 2 players should exhibit an increasing number of chunks with expertise. (2) The proportion of actions falling within a chunk should increase with skill. (3) Chunks should be faster than non-chunks containing the same atomic behaviours. Although our findings support the existence of chunks, they also highlight two problems for existing accounts of rapid motor execution and expert performance. First, while better players do use more chunks, the proportion of actions within a chunks is stable across expertise and expert sequences are generally more varied (the diversity problem). Secondly, chunks, which are supposed to enjoy the most extreme automatization, appear to save little or no time overall (the time savings problem). Instead, the most parsimonious description of our latency analysis is that players become faster overall regardless of chunking."
https://openalex.org/W2950682268,"Gastric cancer is a leading cause of cancer worldwide. Our previous studies showed that aberrant activation of JAK/STAT3 signaling confer epigenetically silences STAT3 target genes in gastric cancer. To further investigate the clinical significance of this phenomenon, we performed Illumina 850K methylation microarray analysis in AGS gastric cancer cells, and cells depleted of STAT3. Integrative computational analysis identified SPG20 as a putative STAT3 epigenetic target, showing promoter hypomethylation in STAT3-depleted AGS cells. Bisulphite pyrosequencing and qRT-PCR confirmed that SPG20 is epigenetically silenced by promoter hypermethylation in a panel of gastric cancer cell lines including AGS cells, but not in immortalized gastric epithelial GES cells. Expression of SPG20 could be restored by the treatment with a DNMT inhibitor, further suggesting that SPG20 is epigenetically silenced by promoter methylation. Clinically, a progressive increase in SPG20 methylation was observed in tissues samples from gastritis (n = 34), to intestinal metaplasia (IM, n = 33), to gastric cancer (n = 53). Importantly, SPG20 methylation could be detected in cell-free DNA isolated from serum samples of gastritis, IM and gastric cancer patients, having a progressive similar to tissues. Taken together, SPG20, a potential STAT3 target, is frequently methylated in gastric cancer, representing a novel noninvasive biomarker for early detection of this deadly disease."
https://openalex.org/W2949989983,"Cognition is impaired in homeless and vulnerably housed persons. Within this heterogeneous and multimorbid group, distinct profiles of cognitive dysfunction are evident. However, little is known about the underlying neurobiological substrates. Imaging structural covariance networks provides a novel investigative strategy to characterizing relationships between brain structure and function within these different cognitive subgroups.Participants were 208 homeless and vulnerably housed persons. Cluster analysis was used to group individuals on the basis of similarities in cognitive functioning in the areas of attention, memory, and executive functioning. The principles of graph theory were applied to construct two brain networks for each cognitive group, using measures of cortical thickness and gyrification. Global and regional network properties were compared across networks for each of the three cognitive clusters.Three cognitive groups were defined by: higher cognitive functioning across domains (Cluster 1); lower cognitive functioning with a decision-making strength (Cluster 3); and an intermediate group with a relative executive functioning weakness (Cluster 2). Between-group differences were observed for cortical thickness, but not gyrification networks. The lower functioning cognitive group exhibited higher segregation and reduced integration, higher centrality in select nodes, and less spatially compact modules compared with the two other groups.The cortical thickness network differences of Cluster 3 suggest that major disruptions in structural connectivity underlie cognitive dysfunction in a subgroup of people who have a high multimorbid illness burden and who are vulnerably housed or homeless. The origins, and possible plasticity of these structure-function relationships identified with network analysis warrant further study."
https://openalex.org/W2950219540,"During the winter of 2016-2017, an epidemic of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) led to high mortality in poultry and put a serious burden on the poultry industry of the Republic of Korea. Effective control measures considering spatial heterogeneity to mitigate the HPAI epidemic is still a challenging issue. Here we develop a spatial-temporal compartmental model that incorporates the culling rate as a function of the reported farms and farm density in each town. The epidemiological and geographical data of two species, chickens and ducks, from the farms in the sixteen towns in Eumseong-gun and Jincheon-gun are used to find the best-fitted parameters of the metapopulation model. The best culling radius to maximize the final size of the susceptible farms and minimize the total number of culled farms is calculated from the model. The local reproductive number using the next generation method is calculated as an indicator of virus transmission in a given area. Simulation results indicate that this parameter is strongly influenced not only by epidemiological factors such as transmissibility and/or susceptibility of poultry species but also by geographical and demographical factors such as the distribution of poultry farms (or density) and connectivity (or distance) between farms. Based on this result, we suggest the best culling radius with respect to the local reproductive number in a targeted area."
https://openalex.org/W2952049619,"Riptortus pedestris is a major agricultural pest on leguminous plants in South Korea and Japan. Recent studies have revealed that R. pedestris can form beneficial symbiosis with bacteria belonging to genus Burkholderia acquired from soil newly for every generation. Although their physiological interactions are relatively well-understood, infection rate and abundance of the Burkholderia in overwintering natural populations of R. pedestris remain unknown. Therefore, the objective of this study was to characterize Burkholderia infection ratio and clade composition of overwintering R. pedestris populations as well as prevalence and diversity of the genus Burkholderia in soil by conducting a two-year field survey. From the field survey, we found 29 overwintering R. pedestris adults in forested areas nearby soybean fields. Diagnostic PCR analysis revealed that overall infection rate of the symbiotic Burkholderia was 93.1% from overwintering adults. Among the Burkholderia-infected R. pedestris, 70.4% of individuals harbored unclassified Burkholderia clades whereas 22.2% and 7.4% of R. pedestris harbor stinkbug-associated beneficial and environmental (SBE) group and Burkholderia cepacia and complex (BCC), respectively. All R. pedestris were infected with a single clade of Burkholderia. In soil, 56.2% of soil samples were Burkholderia positive, and unlike R. pedestris, multiple Burkholderia clades were detected from 62.2% of those samples. Clade composition of the genus Burkholderia in the samples with the bacteria was 91.1%, 60.0%, 31.1% and 8.8% for plant-associated beneficial and environment (PBE), BCC, SBE and unclassified clade, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2950250056,"When C. elegans hermaphrodites are deprived of food during the mid-L4 larval stage and throughout adulthood, they enter an alternative stage termed ""adult reproductive diapause (ARD)"" in which they halt reproduction and extend their lifespan. During ARD, germ cell proliferation stops; oogenesis is slowed; and the gonad shrinks progressively, which has been described as the ""oogenic germline starvation response"". Upon refeeding, the shrunken gonad is regenerated, and animals recover fertility and live out their remaining lifespan. Little is known about the effects of ARD on oocyte quality after ARD. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine how oocyte quality is affected after ARD by measuring brood size and embryonic lethality as a reflection of defective oocyte production. We found that ARD affects reproductive capacity. The oogenic germline starvation response protects oogenic germ cells by slowing oogenesis to prevent prolonged arrest in diakinesis. In contrast to a previous report, we found that germ cell apoptosis is not the cause of gonad shrinkage; instead, we propose that ovulation contributes to gonad shrinkage during the oogenic germline starvation response. We show that germ cell apoptosis increases and continues during ARD via lin-35/Rb and an unknown mechanism. Although apoptosis contributes to maintain germ cell quality during ARD, we demonstrated that apoptosis is not essential to preserve animal fertility. Finally, we show that IIS signaling inactivation partially participates in the oogenic germline starvation response."

We use these models to meet three different output targets, namely, increasing both the desirable and undesirable outputs by the same percentage, increasing these outputs by different percentages, and increasing only the desirable outputs while keeping the undesirable outputs unchanged. We find that operation cost and interest expense are more flexible than labor in the adjustment process and that deposits have no obvious law of change. The findings of this work provide some suggestions for bank managers."

Patients were followed up for hospitalisation due to severe infections, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and death. Multivariable Cox regression and competing risk analyses (accounting for death when appropriate) were used to estimate risk associations.Patients with depression had a higher frequency of comorbidities. During a mean follow-up of 3.2 years, 1,140 severe infections, 806 MACE, and 1,121 deaths were recorded. Compared to controls, patients with depression were at increased risk of death (adjusted hazard ratio 1.24; 95%CI 1.16-1.33). Patients with depression were also at higher risk of severe (1.14; 1.06-1.22) and fatal infections (death within 30 days, 1.22; 1.09-1.35), attributed mainly to sepsis (1.19; 1.08-1.31), septic shock (1.36; 1.13-1.62) and pneumonia (1.19; 1.07-1.33). Conversely, no association was observed between depression and the MACE risk (1.04; 0.94-1.15).Dialysis patients with depression are associated with increased risk of infections and death."

https://openalex.org/W2952750229,"Expanding the southern range of herbaceous peony (Paeonia lactiflora Pall.) is a meaningful and worthwhile horticultural endeavor in the Northern Hemisphere. However, high temperatures in winter seriously hinder the bud dormancy release and flowering of peony in the more southern areas of subtropical and tropical regions. Resource introduction and hybridization can contribute to creating new cultivars with high adaptability in a warmer winter climate. In this study, three representative cultivars of P. lactiflora were screened for flowering capabilities and their annual growth cycles were observed to provide information needed for hybridization. Among these three cultivars, 'Hang Baishao' is the best adapted cultivar for southern growing regions and is unique in its ability to thrive in southern areas of N 30°00'. Pollen viability of 'Hang Baishao' was 55.60% based on five measuring methods, which makes it an excellent male parent in hybridization. Hybrid plants among these three cultivars grew well, but all of their flower buds aborted. Additionally, the ability of three growth regulators that advance the flowering of 'Hang Baishao' to promote an indoor cultivation strategy for improving peony application as a potted or cut-flower plant was tested. 5-azacytidine could impact the growth of 'Hang Baishao' and induce dwarfism and small flowers but not advance the flowering time. Gibberellin A3 promoted the sprouting and growth significantly, but all plants eventually withered. Chilling at 0-4°C for four weeks and irrigation with 300 mg/L humic acid was the optimal combination used to hasten flowering and ensure flowering quality simultaneously. These results can lay the foundation for future studies on the chilling requirement trait, bud dormancy release and key functional gene exploration of herbaceous peony. Additionally, this study can also provide guidance for expanding the range of economically important plants with the winter dormancy trait to the low-latitude regions."
https://openalex.org/W2949084192,"Background Knowledge about the relationship between PSA, age and ISUP grade group (ISUP) 1 prostate cancer can improve clinical and biological understanding of prostate cancer. We aimed to investigate the associations between PSA and age and the risk of ISUP 1 and ISUP ≥ 2 prostate cancer, respectively. Methods We included 6 083 men aged 50–69 biopsied with a total of 72 996 individual biopsy cores from the prospective and population based Stockholm3 diagnostic study. We computed the risk of ISUP 1 and ISUP ≥ 2 prostate cancer and their respective associations with PSA and age. Since lower Gleason grades often are masked by higher grades in the overall Gleason score, we compared associations both for overall Gleason score and for Gleason on individual biopsy cores. Results ISUP 1 prostate cancer was not significantly associated with PSA at diagnosis: odds ratios ranged from 0.82 (95%CI: 0.68–1.00) for PSA 3–4 ng/mL, 0.96 (95%CI: 0.79–1.16) for PSA 4–6 ng/mL, 0.95 (95%CI: 0.75–1.21) for PSA 6–10 ng/mL, and 0.92 (95%CI: 0.58–1.45) for PSA 10–15 ng/mL compared with PSA 2–3 ng/mL. Age was not significantly associated with risk of ISUP 1 cancer. This contrasts to the strong relationship between ISUP ≥ 2 prostate cancer and its respective associations with PSA and age. Conclusions We find no significant association between the risk of ISUP 1 prostate cancer and PSA and age at diagnosis indicating that PSA contribution from ISUP 1 prostate cancer is closer to that of benign prostate tissue than to that of ISUP ≥ 2 prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2952294996,"Peanut scab caused by Elsinoë arachidis is found throughout China’s peanut-growing areas. Elsinochrome produced by E. arachidis is a perylenequinone photosensitive mycotoxin vital to the pathogenic process of the pathogen. In this study, the complex mechanism underlying the regulation of elsinochrome biosynthesis by E. arachidis was investigated based on various nutritional and environmental factors. The initiation of elsinochrome biosynthesis depends on light. E. arachidis produced substantially more quantities of elsinochrome when grown on a semi-synthetic medium (PDA) than when grown on synthetic media with defined ingredients in the presence of light. Elsinochrome accumulation decreased when adjusted with either citrate or phosphate buffers and changing pH suppressed the radical growth. At temperatures ranging from 10°C to 25°C, the production of elsinochrome increased, peaking at 28°C, and it decreased slightly at 30°C. 63 field-collected isolates from China were assessed for the level of elsinochrome production, and pathogenicity analysis was conducted by selecting 12 strains from each 3 of the 4 groups with different levels of elsinochrome production. A direct correlation was observed between elsinochrome production and pathogenicity among the isolates. The results showed elsinochrome biosynthesis to be controlled by E. arachidis and showed elsinochrome to be a vital virulence factor of E. arachidis, required for disease severity."
https://openalex.org/W2952844733,"Nicotine is known to affect cell proliferation and differentiation, two processes vital to proper development of the mandible. The mandible, the lower jaw in mammals and fish, plays a crucial role in craniofacial development. Malformation of the jaw can precipitate a plethora of complications including disrupting development of the upper jaw, the palate, and or impeding airway function. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that in utero nicotine exposure alters the development of the murine mandible in a dose dependent manner. To test this hypothesis, wild type C57BL6 mice were used to produce in utero nicotine exposed litters by adding nicotine to the drinking water of pregnant dams at concentrations of 0 μg/ml (control), 50 μg/ml (low), 100 μg/ml (medium), 200 μg/ml (high) throughout pregnancy to birth of litters mimicking clinically relevant nicotine exposures. Resultant pups revealed no significant differences in body weight however, cephalometric investigation revealed several dimensions affected by nicotine exposure including mandibular ramus height, mandibular body height, and molar length. Histological investigation of molars revealed an increase in proliferation and a decrease in apoptosis with nicotine exposure. These results demonstrate the direct effects of nicotine on the developing mandible outside the context of tobacco use, indicating that nicotine use including tobacco alternatives, cessation methods, and electronic nicotine delivering products may disrupt normal growth and development of the craniofacial complex."

The modeling of technology evolution is crucial for designers, entrepreneurs, and government officials to set reasonable R&D targets, invest in promising technology, and develop effective incentive policies. Scientists and engineers have developed several mathematical functions such as logistic function and exponential function (Moore's Law) to model technology evolution. However, these models focus on how a technology evolves in isolation and do not consider how the technology interacts with other technologies. Here, we extend the Lotka-Volterra equations from community ecology to model a technology ecosystem with system, component, and fundamental layers. We model the technology ecosystem of passenger aircraft using the Lotka-Volterra equations. The results show limited trickle-down effect in the technology ecosystem, where we refer to the impact from an upper layer technology to a lower layer technology as a trickle-down effect. The limited trickle-down effect suggests that the advance of the system technology (passenger aircraft) is not able to automatically promote the performance of the component technology (turbofan aero-engine) and the fundamental technology (engine blade superalloy) that constitute the system. Our research warns that it may not be effective to maintain the prosperity of a technology ecosystem through government incentives on system technologies only. Decision makers should consider supporting the innovations of key component or fundamental technologies."
https://openalex.org/W2949257047,"Assistance dogs aid people with various impairments on a daily basis. To become an assistance dog, a strict selection procedure and intensive training period must be successfully completed. Consequently, not every dog acquired for this purpose, becomes an assistance dog. The purpose of this study was to investigate reasons for failure and the financial consequences thereof for assistance dog associations that do not have a dedicated breeding program for their dogs. Data were collected for a total of 537 dogs enlisted between 2001 and 2015 and purchased out of the general dog population by five Belgian assistance dog associations. Only 60 percent of the dogs actually became an assistance dog and the main reasons for failure were related to undesirable behavioural characteristics and orthopaedic disorders. The estimated average financial loss per rejected dog was found to be 10524 euro. A detailed comparison of the two most popular breeds (Golden Retriever and Labrador Retriever) within the guide dogs and mobility assistance dogs revealed no significant difference in probability of successfully completing the training. However, a comparison of orthopaedic screening methods revealed a higher rejection with computed tomography for elbow dysplasia and laxity-based radiographical techniques for hip dysplasia compared to radiography and the standard ventrodorsal hip extend radiograph alone, respectively. Based on these results, we provide several suggestions to increase the probability of success."

The printed ink on the capsule surface was sampled by swabbing, followed by direct analysis of the DNA-swab complex, without subsequent DNA purification. It was shown that DNA recovered from the ink by swabbing was suitable for PCR-CE analysis-a widely used method in forensic science and was also suitable for qPCR and isothermal DNA amplification, when coupled with portable devices similar to those used for environmental sampling and food safety testing. The data set a precedent: A small DNA fragment could be introduced as an excipient into a pharmaceutical application, and thereafter tracked through the pharmaceutical supply chain via forensic DNA authentication."
https://openalex.org/W2951118164,"Children born small for gestational age (SGA) generally have a catch-up growth and rapid weight gain in the first years of life, which is a high risk of insulin resistance and cardiovascular diseases later in life. It was reported that the level of imprinted genes IGF-2, CDKN1C and PHLDA2 regulates placental growth. We assessed these imprinted genes expression levels in placental tissue and their influences on catch-up growth of full-term SGA infants. The protein and mRNA levels of placental CDKN1C, PHLDA2 and IGF-2 were analyzed in 29 full-term SGA and 29 full-term infants born appropriate for gestational age (AGA) using quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot assay, respectively. Catch-up growth was indicated by increased standard deviation score (ΔSDS) of weight at 1, 3 and 6 months relative to birth weight (BW). Correlations between indicated variables were evaluated using Pearson correlation coefficient analysis. Compared to AGA infants, CDKN1C and PHLDA2 levels were significantly increased, whereas IGF-2 was significantly reduced in SGA infants. The value of ΔSDS was significantly higher in SGA than that in AGA infants. For SGA status, Pearson analysis shows i) a negative correlation of CDKN1C and PHLDA2 abundances with BW, and a positive correlation of IGF-2 with BW, ii) no correlation between the three imprinted gene abundances and placental weight (PW), and between PW and BW, iii) a positive correlation of PHLDA2 abundance with CDKN1C, and iv) a positive correlation of CDKN1C and PHLDA2 abundances with ΔSDS, and a negative correlation of IGF-2 with ΔSDS at 1, 3 and 6 months. Taken together, increased CDKN1C and PHLDA2 and reduced IGF-2 abundances in placental tissue were related to BW and early period catch-up growth in full-term SGA infants. Placental CDKN1C, PHLDA2 and IGF-2 level monitoring may be useful for predicting and preventing the development of SGA."

Our work has focused on CD26 as a novel therapeutic target for various tumors and immune disorders, and we have recently developed a humanized anti-CD26 monoclonal antibody (mAb), YS110, which has promising safety profile and clinical activity in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. The development of an anti-human CD26 mAb that can clearly and reliably detect the denatured CD26 molecule in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues in the clinical setting is therefore of the utmost importance. To develop novel anti-CD26 mAbs capable of binding to denatured CD26, we immunized mice with urea-treated CD26 protein. Hybridoma supernatants were screened for specific reactivity with human CD26 by immunostaining through the use of a set of FFPE human CD26-positive or negative tumor cell lines. This screening method enables us to develop novel anti-human CD26 mAbs suitable for immunohistochemical staining of CD26 in FFPE non-tumor and tumor tissue sections with reliable clarity and intensity. Specifically, these mAbs display strong binding affinity to denatured human CD26 rather than undenatured human CD26, and are capable of detecting denatured human CD26 in decalcified specimens. These novel anti-CD26 mAbs are potentially useful for the analysis of CD26 expression in cancer patients with bony metastasis, and may help decide the appropriateness of YS110 therapy for future cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2952675077,"While prediction errors (PE) have been established to drive learning through adaptation of internal models, the role of model-compliant events in predictive processing is less clear. Checkpoints (CP) were recently introduced as points in time where expected sensory input resolved ambiguity regarding the validity of the internal model. Conceivably, these events serve as on-line reference points for model evaluation, particularly in uncertain contexts. Evidence from fMRI has shown functional similarities of CP and PE to be independent of event-related surprise, raising the important question of how these event classes relate to one another. Consequently, the aim of the present study was to characterise the functional relationship of checkpoints and prediction errors in a serial pattern detection task using electroencephalography (EEG). Specifically, we first hypothesised a joint P3b component of both event classes to index recourse to the internal model (compared to non-informative standards, STD). Second, we assumed the mismatch signal of PE to be reflected in an N400 component when compared to CP. Event-related findings supported these hypotheses. We suggest that while model adaptation is instigated by prediction errors, checkpoints are similarly used for model evaluation. Intriguingly, behavioural subgroup analyses showed that the exploitation of potentially informative reference points may depend on initial cue learning: Strict reliance on cue-based predictions may result in less attentive processing of these reference points, thus impeding upregulation of response gain that would prompt flexible model adaptation. Overall, present results highlight the role of checkpoints as model-compliant, informative reference points and stimulate important research questions about their processing as function of learning und uncertainty."
https://openalex.org/W2951877775,"The relationship between lay theories of gender and attitudes to abortion policy has received minimal empirical attention. An ongoing theoretical debate in the psychological essentialism literature queries whether biological attributions causally influence social attitudes or primarily function to justify existing attitudinal commitments. The current research used the context of a national referendum on abortion in Ireland to investigate whether endorsement of certain gender theories is contingent on their rhetorical construction as supporting particular attitudes to abortion. Two experimental studies were conducted online in the three weeks preceding the Irish abortion referendum. The studies tested whether participants would adapt their causal gender beliefs after reading that biological (Study 1; N = 348) or social (Study 2; N = 241) accounts of gender supported or conflicted with their intended vote in the referendum. Both studies showed the opposite effect: causal gender theories presented as conflicting with participants’ voting intentions subsequently showed elevated support, relative to theories that purportedly aligned with participants’ voting intentions. While results confirm that lay theories of gender are mutable, the direction of effects does not support the proposition that gender theories are selectively endorsed to support existing socio-political attitudes to abortion. Potential mechanisms for the results observed are discussed."

We present the results of a local-scale data analysis to investigate the onset and patterns of the Noctiluca blooms, which form annually during the winter monsoon in the Gulf of Oman and in the Arabian Sea. Our approach combines methods in physical and biological oceanography with machine learning techniques. In particular, we present a robust algorithm, the variable-length Linear Dynamic Systems (vLDS) model, that extracts the causal factors and latent dynamics at the local-scale along each individual drifter trajectory, and demonstrate its effectiveness by using it to generate predictive plots for all variables and test macroscopic scientific hypotheses. The vLDS model is a new algorithm specifically designed to analyze the irregular dataset from surface velocity drifters, in which the multivariate time series trajectories are having variable or unequal lengths. The test results provide local-scale statistical evidence to support and check the macroscopic physical and biological Oceanography hypotheses on the Noctiluca blooms; it also helps identify complementary local trajectory-scale dynamics that might not be visible or discoverable at the macroscopic scale. The vLDS model also exhibits a generalization capability (as a machine learning methodology) to investigate important causal factors and hidden dynamics associated with ocean biogeochemical processes and phenomena at the population-level and local trajectory-scale."

Similarly, risk factors for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases are associated with cognitive function and dementia. We hypothesized that cardiovascular risk factors moderate the association of exposure to infectious diseases with cognitive function. Methods We studied 5662 participants aged 20 to 59 years from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988–1994) in the United States. We used linear regression to investigate whether the Framingham general cardiovascular risk index moderated the association of infection burden based on exposure to eight different infectious diseases with cognitive functioning as measured by the Symbol Digit Substitution, Serial Digit Learning, and Reaction Time tests. Results The multiplicative interaction between the infection-burden index and the cardiovascular-risk index was associated with performance on the Symbol Digit Substitution (B = .019 [95% CI: .008, .031], p < .001) but not on the Serial Digit Learning (B = .034 [95% CI: -.025, .094]) or for Reaction Time (B = -.030 [95% CI: -.848, .787]). Participants with a lower cardiovascular risk appeared to be more resilient against the potential adverse effects of higher infection burden on the Symbol Digit Substitution task. Conclusions Participants at zero risk for a cardiovascular event in the next 10 years had no differences in processing speed with increasing exposure to infectious disease, whereas participants with higher risk for a cardiovascular event had worse processing speed with increased exposure to infectious disease."
https://openalex.org/W2950528761,"Based on recent findings that interrogator intonation can enhance interrogative suggestibility during recall phases, the present study tested influences of interrogator intonation on memory performance even as early as at the encoding stage. We experimentally manipulated interrogator intonation during encoding of a story to be recalled in immediate and delayed subsequent memory tests (Experiment 1, N = 50). As expected, a symmetrically structuring vs. an isolating-emphasizing speaking style generally increased the amount of freely recalled details. In a more fine-grained experiment (N = 50), we additionally manipulated emphasized story details and tested recall rates for peripheral, neutral, and central items. We found that emphasized peripheral details of the story were easier reproduced than central details realized in a neutral fashion, whereas the opposite pattern emerged for emphasized central details. Results are discussed in terms of their implications for forensic (interrogation) contexts and their legal psychological relevance."
