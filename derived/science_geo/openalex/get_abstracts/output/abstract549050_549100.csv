https://openalex.org/W2200292141,"High fluorescence quantum yield graphene quantum dots (GQDs) have showed up as a new generation for bioimaging. In this work, luminescent GQDs were prepared by an ameliorative photo-Fenton reaction and a subsequent hydrothermal process using graphene oxide sheets as the precursor. The as-prepared GQDs were nanomaterials with size ranging from 2.3 to 6.4 nm and emitted intense green luminescence in water. The fluorescence quantum yield was as high as 24.6% (excited at 340 nm) and the fluorescence was strongest at pH 7. Moreover, the influences of low-concentration (12.5, 25 μg/mL) GQDs on the morphology, viability, membrane integrity, internal cellular reactive oxygen species level and mortality of HeLa cells were relatively weak, and the in vitro imaging demonstrated GQDs were mainly in the cytoplasm region. More strikingly, zebrafish embryos were co-cultured with GQDs for in vivo imaging, and the results of heart rate test showed the intake of small amounts of GQDs brought little harm to the cardiovascular of zebrafish. GQDs with high quantum yield and strong photoluminescence show good biocompatibility, thus they show good promising for cell imaging, biolabeling and other biomedical applications."
https://openalex.org/W2214651920,"Hippocampal neurons show selectivity with respect to visual cues in primates, including humans, but this has never been found in rodents. To address this long-standing discrepancy, we measured hippocampal activity from rodents during real-world random foraging. Surprisingly, ∼ 25% of neurons exhibited significant directional modulation with respect to visual cues. To dissociate the contributions of visual and vestibular cues, we made similar measurements in virtual reality, in which only visual cues were informative. Here, we found significant directional modulation despite the severe loss of vestibular information, challenging prevailing theories of directionality. Changes in the amount of angular information in visual cues induced corresponding changes in head-directional modulation at the neuronal and population levels. Thus, visual cues are sufficient for-and play a predictable, causal role in-generating directionally selective hippocampal responses. These results dissociate hippocampal directional and spatial selectivity and bridge the gap between primate and rodent studies."
https://openalex.org/W2217359279,"Eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis depends on several hundred assembly factors to produce functional 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits. The final phase of 60S subunit biogenesis is cytoplasmic maturation, which includes the proofreading of functional centers of the 60S subunit and the release of several ribosome biogenesis factors. We report the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the yeast 60S subunit in complex with the biogenesis factors Rei1, Arx1, and Alb1 at 3.4 Å resolution. In addition to the network of interactions formed by Alb1, the structure reveals a mechanism for ensuring the integrity of the ribosomal polypeptide exit tunnel. Arx1 probes the entire set of inner-ring proteins surrounding the tunnel exit, and the C terminus of Rei1 is deeply inserted into the ribosomal tunnel, where it forms specific contacts along almost its entire length. We provide genetic and biochemical evidence that failure to insert the C terminus of Rei1 precludes subsequent steps of 60S maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2213545278,"Purpose To report on the influence of ophthalmic artery chemosurgery (OAC) on enucleation rates, ocular and patient survival from metastasis and impact on practice patterns at Memorial Sloan Kettering for children with advanced intraocular unilateral retinoblastoma. Patients and Methods Single-center retrospective review of all unilateral retinoblastoma patients with advanced intraocular retinoblastoma treated at MSKCC between our introduction of OAC (May 2006) and December 2014. End points were ocular survival, patient survival from metastases and enucleation rates. Results 156 eyes of 156 retinoblastoma patients were included. Primary enucleation rates have progressively decreased from a rate of >95% before OAC to 66.7% in the first year of OAC use to the present rate of 7.4%. The percent of patients receiving OAC has progressively increased from 33.3% in 2006 to 92.6% in 2014. Overall, ocular survival was significantly better in eyes treated with OAC in the years 2010–2014 compared to 2006–2009 (p = 0.023, 92.7% vs 68.0% ocular survival at 48 months). There have been no metastatic deaths in the OAC group but two patients treated with primary enucleation have died of metastatic disease. Conclusion OAC was introduced in 2006 and its impact on patient management is profound. Enucleation rates have decreased from over 95% to less than 10%. Our ocular survival rate has also significantly and progressively improved since May 2006. Despite treating more advanced eyes rather then enucleating them patient survival has not been compromised (there have been no metastatic deaths in the OAC group). In our institution, enucleation is no longer the most common treatment for advanced unilateral retinoblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W2283203552,"The secoiridoids are the main class of specialized metabolites present in olive (Olea europaea L.) fruit. In particular, the secoiridoid oleuropein strongly influences olive oil quality because of its bitterness, which is a desirable trait. In addition, oleuropein possesses a wide range of pharmacological properties, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer activities. In accordance, obtaining high oleuropein varieties is a main goal of molecular breeding programs. Here we use a transcriptomic approach to identify candidate genes belonging to the secoiridoid pathway in olive. From these candidates, we have functionally characterized the olive homologue of iridoid synthase (OeISY), an unusual terpene cyclase that couples an NAD (P)H-dependent 1,4-reduction step with a subsequent cyclization, and we provide evidence that OeISY likely generates the monoterpene scaffold of oleuropein in olive fruits. OeISY, the first pathway gene characterized for this type of secoiridoid, is a potential target for breeding programs in a high value secoiridoid-accumulating species."
https://openalex.org/W2197043200,"Our previous studies had reported that morin, a bioflavanoid exhibited potent anti-inflammatory effect against adjuvant-induced arthritic rats. In this current study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory mechanism of morin against monosodium urate crystal (MSU)-induced inflammation in RAW 264.7 macrophage cells, an in vitro model for acute gouty arthritis. For comparison purpose, colchicine was used as a reference drug. We have observed that morin (100-300 μM) treatment significantly suppressed the levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, MCP-1 and VEGF), inflammatory mediators (NO and PEG2), and lysosomal enzymes (acid phosphatase, β-galactosidase, N-acetyl glucosamindase and cathepsin D) in MSU-crystals stimulated macrophage cells. The mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and MCP-1), inflammatory enzymes (iNOS and COX-2), and NF-κBp65 was found downregulated in MSU crystal stimulated macrophage cells by morin treatment, however, the mRNA expression of hypoxanthine phospho ribosyl transferse (HPRT) was found to be increased. The flow cytometry analysis revealed that morin treatment decreased intracellular reactive oxygen species levels in MSU crystal stimulated macrophage cells. The western blot analysis clearly showed that morin mainly exerts its anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the MSU crystal-induced COX-2 and TNF-α protein expression through the inactivation of NF-κB signaling pathway in RAW 264.7 macrophage cells similar to that of BAY 11-7082 (IκB kinase inhibitor). Our results collectively suggest that morin can be a potential therapeutic agent for inflammatory disorders like acute gouty arthritis."
https://openalex.org/W2205845943,"In Australia, a conclusive aetiology of Lyme disease-like illness in human patients remains elusive, despite growing numbers of people presenting with symptoms attributed to tick bites. In the present study, we surveyed the microbial communities harboured by human-biting ticks from across Australia to identify bacteria that may contribute to this syndrome. Universal PCR primers were used to amplify the V1-2 hyper-variable region of bacterial 16S rRNA genes in DNA samples from individual Ixodes holocyclus (n = 279), Amblyomma triguttatum (n = 167), Haemaphysalis bancrofti (n = 7), and H. longicornis (n = 7) ticks. The 16S amplicons were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform and analysed in USEARCH, QIIME, and BLAST to assign genus and species-level taxonomies. Nested PCR and Sanger sequencing were used to confirm the NGS data and further analyse novel findings. All 460 ticks were negative for Borrelia spp. by both NGS and nested PCR analysis. Two novel “Candidatus Neoehrlichia” spp. were identified in 12.9% of I. holocyclus ticks. A novel Anaplasma sp. was identified in 1.8% of A. triguttatum ticks, and a novel Ehrlichia sp. was identified in both A. triguttatum (1.2%) ticks and a single I. holocyclus (0.6%) tick. Further phylogenetic analysis of novel “Ca. Neoehrlichia”, Anaplasma and Ehrlichia based on 1,265 bp 16S rRNA gene sequences suggests that these are new species. Determining whether these newly discovered organisms cause disease in humans and animals, like closely related bacteria do abroad, is of public health importance and requires further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2207545253,"Introduction There is limited understanding of the association between peer social networks and physical activity (PA), sedentary and screen-related behaviors. This study reports on associations between personal network characteristics and these important health behaviors for early adolescents. Methods Participants were 310 students, aged 11–13 years, from fifteen randomly selected Victorian primary schools (43% response rate). PA and sedentary behaviors were collected via accelerometer and self-report questionnaire, and anthropometric measures via trained researchers. Participants nominated up to fifteen friends, and described the frequency of interaction and perceived activity intensity of these friends. Personal network predictors were examined using regression modelling for PA and sedentary/screen behavior. Results Perceived activity levels of friends, and friendships with very frequent interaction were associated with outside-of-school PA and/or sedentary/screen time. Differences according to sex were also observed in the association between network characteristics and PA and sedentary time. A higher number of friends and greater proportion of same sex friends were associated with boys engaging in more moderate-to-vigorous PA outside of school hours. PA intensity during school-day breaks was positively associated with having a greater proportion of friends who played sports for girls, and a greater proportion of male friends for boys. Conclusion Friendship network characteristics are associated with PA and sedentary/screen time in late childhood/early adolescence, and these associations differ by sex. The positive influence of very active peers may be a promising avenue to strengthen traditional interventions for the promotion of PA and reduction in screen time."
https://openalex.org/W2284126852,"The gastrointestinal tract microbiome has been suggested as a potential therapeutic target for metabolic diseases such as obesity and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the relationship between changes in microbial communities and metabolic disease-phenotypes are still poorly understood. In this study, we used antibiotics with markedly different antibacterial spectra to modulate the gut microbiome in a diet-induced obesity mouse model and then measured relevant biochemical, hormonal and phenotypic biomarkers of obesity and T2DM. Mice fed a high-fat diet were treated with either ceftazidime (a primarily anti-Gram negative bacteria antibiotic) or vancomycin (mainly anti-Gram positive bacteria activity) in an escalating three-dose regimen. We also dosed animals with a well-known prebiotic weight-loss supplement, 10% oligofructose saccharide (10% OFS). Vancomycin treated mice showed little weight change and no improvement in glycemic control while ceftazidime and 10% OFS treatments induced significant weight loss. However, only ceftazidime showed significant, dose dependent improvement in key metabolic variables including glucose, insulin, protein tyrosine tyrosine (PYY) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Subsequently, we confirmed the positive hyperglycemic control effects of ceftazidime in the Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat model. Metagenomic DNA sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA gene regions V1-V3 showed that the microbiomes of ceftazidime dosed mice and rats were enriched for the phylum Firmicutes while 10% OFS treated mice had a greater abundance of Bacteroidetes. We show that specific changes in microbial community composition are associated with obesity and glycemic control phenotypes. More broadly, our study suggests that in vivo modulation of the microbiome warrants further investigation as a potential therapeutic strategy for metabolic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2209466135,"Cataract is a protein misfolding disease where the size of the aggregate is directly related to the severity of the disorder. However, the molecular mechanisms that trigger the onset of aggregation remain unknown. Here we use a combination of protein engineering techniques and single-molecule force spectroscopy using atomic force microscopy to study the individual unfolding pathways of the human γD-crystallin, a multidomain protein that must remain correctly folded during the entire lifetime to guarantee lens transparency. When stretching individual polyproteins containing two neighboring HγD-crystallin monomers, we captured an anomalous misfolded conformation in which the β1 and β2 strands of the N terminus domain of two adjacent monomers swap. This experimentally elusive domain-swapped conformation is likely to be responsible for the increase in molecular aggregation that we measure in vitro. Our results demonstrate the power of force spectroscopy at capturing rare misfolded conformations with potential implications for the understanding of the molecular onset of protein aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W2217260633,"In multi-server environments, user authentication is a very important issue because it provides the authorization that enables users to access their data and services; furthermore, remote user authentication schemes for multi-server environments have solved the problem that has arisen from user’s management of different identities and passwords. For this reason, numerous user authentication schemes that are designed for multi-server environments have been proposed over recent years. In 2015, Lu et al. improved upon Mishra et al.’s scheme, claiming that their remote user authentication scheme is more secure and practical; however, we found that Lu et al.’s scheme is still insecure and incorrect. In this paper, we demonstrate that Lu et al.’s scheme is vulnerable to outsider attack and user impersonation attack, and we propose a new biometrics-based scheme for authentication and key agreement that can be used in multi-server environments; then, we show that our proposed scheme is more secure and supports the required security properties."
https://openalex.org/W2205229855,"Background Obesity is a global public health challenge. In the US, for instance, obesity prevalence remains high at more than one-third of the adult population, while over two-thirds are obese or overweight. Obesity is associated with various health problems, such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), depression, some forms of cancer, sleep apnea, osteoarthritis, among others. The body mass index (BMI) is one of the best known measures of obesity. The BMI, however, has serious limitations, for instance, its inability to capture the distribution of lean mass and adipose tissue, which is a better predictor of diabetes and CVDs, and its curved (“U-shaped”) relationship with mortality hazard. Other anthropometric measures and their relation to obesity have been studied, each with its advantages and limitations. In this work, we introduce a new anthropometric measure (called Surface-based Body Shape Index, SBSI) that accounts for both body shape and body size, and evaluate its performance as a predictor of all-cause mortality. Methods and Findings We analyzed data on 11,808 subjects (ages 18–85), from the National Health and Human Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999–2004, with 8-year mortality follow up. Based on the analysis, we introduce a new body shape index constructed from four important anthropometric determinants of body shape and body size: body surface area (BSA), vertical trunk circumference (VTC), height (H) and waist circumference (WC). The surface-based body shape index (SBSI) is defined as follows: (1) SBSI has negative correlation with BMI and weight respectively, no correlation with WC, and shows a generally linear relationship with age. Results on mortality hazard prediction using both the Cox proportionality model, and Kaplan-Meier curves each show that SBSI outperforms currently popular body shape indices (e.g., BMI, WC, waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), A Body Shape Index (ABSI)) in predicting all-cause mortality. Conclusions We combine measures of both body shape and body size to construct a novel anthropometric measure, the surface-based body shape index (SBSI). SBSI is generally linear with age, and increases with increasing mortality, when compared with other popular anthropometric indices of body shape."
https://openalex.org/W2202409919,"This study describes a spring 2013 outbreak of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDv), using data from 222 swine sites in 14 counties area in 4 contiguous states in the United States. During the outbreak, the premises-level incidence of PEDv was 40.5 percent (90/222 sites). One of the three companies from which data were collected had a lower incidence (19.5 percent) than the other two companies (41.1 and 47.2 percent). Sow sites had the highest incidence of PEDv during the outbreak (80.0 percent). Spatial analysis showed that PEDv was clustered rather than randomly distributed, which suggested that sites near a positive site had increased risk of acquiring PEDv infection. Meteorological data were used to investigate the hypothesis that PEDv was spread by air. If airborne dissemination played a role in this outbreak, we would expect the direction of disease spread to correlate with the predominant wind direction. Two methods were used to determine the direction of disease spread--linear direction mean analysis in ArcGIS and the direction test in ClusterSeer. The former method indicated PEDv spread was south to slightly southwest, and the latter indicated spread was to the southeast. The predominant wind direction during the month of the outbreak was toward the south, with some southeast and southwest winds; the strongest wind gusts were toward the southwest. These findings support the hypothesis that PEDv was spread by air. The results, however, should be interpreted cautiously because we did not have information on direct and indirect contacts between sites, such as movement of trucks, feed, pigs or people. These types of contacts should be evaluated before pathogen spread is attributed to airborne mechanisms. Although this study did not provide a definitive assessment of airborne spread of PEDv, we believe the findings justify additional research to investigate this potential mechanism of transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2213421170,"Cancer cachexia is a paraneoplastic syndrome that causes profound weight loss and muscle mass atrophy and is estimated to be the cause of up to 30% of cancer deaths. Though the exact cause is unknown, patients with cancer cachexia have increased muscle protein catabolism. In healthy muscle, injury activates skeletal muscle stem cells, called satellite cells, to differentiate and promote regeneration. Here, we provide evidence that this mechanism is inhibited in cancer cachexia due to persistent expression of CCAAT/Enhancer Binding Protein beta (C/EBPβ) in muscle myoblasts. C/EBPβ is a bzip transcription factor that is expressed in muscle satellite cells and is normally downregulated upon differentiation. However, in myoblasts exposed to a cachectic milieu, C/EBPβ expression remains elevated, despite activation to differentiate, resulting in the inhibition of myogenin expression and myogenesis. In vivo, cancer cachexia results in increased number of Pax7+ cells that also express C/EBPβ and the inhibition of normal repair mechanisms. Loss of C/EBPβ expression in primary myoblasts rescues differentiation under cachectic conditions without restoring myotube size, indicating that C/EBPβ is an important inhibitor of myogenesis in cancer cachexia."
https://openalex.org/W2221425950,"Background The β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-3 gene (B3GNT3) encodes a member of the B3GNT family that functions as the backbone structure of dimeric sialyl-Lewis A and is involved in L-selectin ligand biosynthesis, lymphocyte homing and lymphocyte trafficking. B3GNT3 has been implicated as an important element in the development of certain cancers. However, the characteristics of B3GNT3 in the development and progression of cancer remain largely unknown. Thus, our study aimed to investigate the expression pattern and the prognostic value of B3GNT3 in patients with early-stage cervical cancer. Methods The mRNA and protein levels of B3GNT3 expression were examined in eight cervical cancer cell lines and ten paired cervical cancer tumors, using real-time PCR and western blotting, respectively. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to analyze B3GNT3 protein expression in paraffin-embedded tissues from 196 early-stage cervical cancer patients. Statistical analyses were applied to evaluate the association between B3GNT3 expression scores and clinical parameters, as well as patient survival. Results B3GNT3 expression was significantly upregulated in cervical cancer cell lines and lesions compared with normal cells and adjacent noncancerous cervical tissues. In the 196 cases of tested early-stage cervical cancer samples, the B3GNT3 protein level was positively correlated with high risk TYPES of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection (P = 0.026), FIGO stage (P < 0.001), tumor size (P = 0.025), tumor recurrence (P = 0.004), vital status (P < 0.001), concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy (P = 0.016), lymphovascular space involvement (P = 0.003) and most importantly, lymph node metastasis (P = 0.003). Patients with high B3GNT3 expression had a shorter overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) compared with those with low expression of this protein. Multivariate analysis suggested that B3GNT3 expression is an independent prognostic indicator for cervical cancer patients. Conclusions Our study demonstrated that elevated B3GNT3 expression is associated with pelvic lymph node metastasis and poor outcome in early-stage cervical cancer patients. B3GNT3 may be a novel prognostic marker and therapeutic target for the treatment of cervical cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2216466706,"Background TM4SF1 is overexpressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and affects the development of this cancer. Also, multidrug resistance (MDR) is generally associated with tumor chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer. However, the correlation between TM4SF1 and MDR remains unknown. This research aims to investigate the effect of TM4SF1 on gemcitabine resistance in PDAC and explore the possible molecular mechanism between TM4SF1 and MDR. Methods The expression of TM4SF1 was evaluated in pancreatic cancer cell lines and human pancreatic duct epithelial (HPDE) cell lines by quantitative RT-PCR. TM4SF1 siRNA transfection was carried out using Hiperfect transfection reagent to knock down TM4SF1. The transcripts were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR, RT-PCR and western blotting for further study. The cell proliferation and apoptosis were obtained to investigate the sensitivity to gemcitabine of pancreatic cancer cells after silencing TM4SF1 in vitro. We demonstrated that cell signaling of TM4SF1 mediated chemoresistance in cancer cells by assessing the expression of multidrug resistance (MDR) genes using quantitative RT-PCR. In vivo, we used orthotopic pancreatic tumor models to investigate the effect of proliferation after silencing TM4SF1 by a lentivirus-mediated shRNA in MIA PaCa-2 cell lines. Results The mRNA expression of TM4SF1 was higher in seven pancreatic cancer cell lines than in HPDE cell lines. In three gemcitabine-sensitive cell lines (L3.6pl, BxPC-3, SU86.86), the expression of TM4SF1 was lower than that in four gemcitabine-resistant cell lines (MIA PaCa-2, PANC-1, Hs766T, AsPC-1). We evaluated that TM4SF1 was a putative target for gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic cancer cells. Using AsPC-1, MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1, we investigated that TM4SF1 silencing affected cell proliferation and increased the percentages of cell apoptosis mediated by treatment with gemcitabine compared with cells which were treated with negative control. This resistance was associated with the expression of multidrug resistance genes including ABCB1 and ABCC1. In vivo, silencing of TM4SF1 in MIA PaCa-2 cell lines increased the effectiveness of gemcitabine-based treatment in orthotopic pancreatic tumor models evaluated using noninvasive bioluminescent imaging. Conclusion These findings suggest that TM4SF1 is a surface membrane antigen that is highly expressed in pancreatic cancer cells and increases the chemoresistance to gemcitabine. Thus, TM4SF1 may be a promising target to overcome the chemoresistance of pancreatic cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2282875517,"Sortase-dependent surface pili (or fimbriae) in Gram-positive bacteria are well documented as a key virulence factor for certain harmful opportunistic pathogens. However, it is only recently known that these multi-subunit protein appendages are also belonging to the “friendly” commensals and now, with this new perspective, they have come to be categorized as a niche-adaptation factor as well. In this regard, it was shown earlier that sortase-assembled piliation is a native fixture of two human intestinal commensalics (i.e., Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium bifidum), and correspondingly where the pili involved have a significant role in cellular adhesion and immunomodulation processes. We now reveal that intestinal indigenous (or autochthonous) Lactobacillus ruminis is another surface-piliated commensal lactobacillar species. Heeding to in silico expectations, the predicted loci for the LrpCBA-called pili are organized tandemly in the L. ruminis genome as a canonical fimbrial operon, which then encodes for three pilin-proteins and a single C-type sortase enzyme. Through electron microscopic means, we showed that these pilus formations are a surface assemblage of tip, basal, and backbone pilin subunits (respectively named LrpC, LrpB, and LrpA) in L. ruminis, and also when expressed recombinantly in Lactococcus lactis. As well, by using the recombinant-piliated lactococci, we could define certain ecologically relevant phenotypic traits, such as the ability to adhere to extracellular matrix proteins and gut epithelial cells, but also to effectuate an induced dampening on Toll-like receptor 2 signaling and interleukin-8 responsiveness in immune-related cells. Within the context of the intestinal microcosm, by wielding such niche-advantageous cell-surface properties the LrpCBA pilus would undoubtedly have a requisite functional role in the colonization dynamics of L. ruminis indigeneity. Our study provides only the second description of a native-piliated Lactobacillus species, but at the same time also involves the structural and functional characterization of a third type of lactobacillar pilus."
https://openalex.org/W2198730715,"Plant responses to heavy metal contamination may depend on the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). Elsholtzia splendens is an indicator species for the presence of copper (Cu) mines because both its flowering phenology and reproduction are tolerant to heavy metals. To test whether effects of Cu on the flowering phenology and reproduction of E. splendens depend on the presence of AMF, we conducted a factorial experiment with two Cu treatments (with or without Cu addition) crossed with two AMF treatments (with or without AMF inoculation). Without AMF, Cu addition significantly delayed the onset dates, ending dates and peak dates of flowering and decreased flowering duration. However, AMF inoculation reversed the effects of Cu stress, with recovered flowering onset and ending dates and increased the flowering duration. Cu addition significantly decreased inflorescence width and number, inflorescence biomass, vegetative biomass and total seed number, but significantly increased 1000-seed weight. AMF inoculation significantly increased vegetative biomass. Two-way ANOVA results showed that the interactive effects between Cu addition and AMF inoculation were significant on the inflorescence number, vegetative biomass and total seed number. These results indicate that AMF can alleviate the Cu stress on the flowering phenology and reproduction of E. splendens."

https://openalex.org/W2220068888,"Central nervous system injury induces a regenerative response in ensheathing glial cells comprising cell proliferation, spontaneous axonal remyelination, and limited functional recovery, but the molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. In Drosophila, this involves the genes prospero and Notch controlling the balance between glial proliferation and differentiation, and manipulating their levels in glia can switch the response to injury from prevention to promotion of repair. In the mouse, Notch1 maintains NG2 oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) in a progenitor state, but what factor may enable oligodendrocyte (OL) differentiation and functional remyelination is not understood. Here, we asked whether the mammalian homologue of prospero, Prox1, is involved. Our data show that Prox1 is distributed in NG2+ OPCs and in OLs in primary cultured cells, and in the mouse spinal cord in vivo. siRNA prox1 knockdown in primary OPCs increased cell proliferation, increased NG2+ OPC cell number and decreased CC1+ OL number. Prox1 conditional knockout in the OL cell lineage in mice increased NG2+ OPC cell number, and decreased CC1+ OL number. Lysolecithin-induced demyelination injury caused a reduction in CC1+ OLs in homozygous Prox1-/- conditional knockout mice compared to controls. Remarkably, Prox1-/- conditional knockout mice had smaller lesions than controls. Altogether, these data show that Prox1 is required to inhibit OPC proliferation and for OL differentiation, and could be a relevant component of the regenerative glial response. Therapeutic uses of glia and stem cells to promote regeneration and repair after central nervous system injury would benefit from manipulating Prox1."
https://openalex.org/W2206043536,"Epidemiological evidence indicates that assisted reproductive technologies (ART) may be associated with several epigenetic diseases such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) or Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS). Selection of sperm by density-gradients in ART has improved DNA integrity and sperm quality; however, epigenetic alterations associated with this approach are largely unknown. In the present study, we investigated DNA methylation and histone retention profiles in raw sperm and selected sperm derived from the same individual and separated by using density-gradients. Results from a study group consisting of 93 males demonstrated that both global DNA methylation and histone retention levels decreased in density selected sperm. Compared to unselected raw sperm, histone transition rates decreased by an average of 27.2% in selected sperm, and the global methylation rate was 3.8% in unselected sperm and 3.3% in the selected sperm. DNA methylation and histone retention location profiling analyses suggested that these alterations displayed specific location patterns in the human genome. Changes in the pattern of hypomethylation largely occurred in transcriptional factor gene families such as HOX, FOX, and GATA. Histone retention increased in 67 genes, whereas it was significantly clustered in neural development-related gene families, particularly the olfactory sensor gene family. Although a causative relationship could not be established, the results of the present study suggest the possibility that sperm with good density also possess unique epigenetic profiles, particularly for genes involved in neural and olfactory development. As increasing evidence demonstrates that epigenetics plays a key role in embryonic development and offspring growth characteristics, the specific epigenetic alterations we observed in selected sperm may influence the transcriptional process and neural development in embryos."
https://openalex.org/W2205041826,"Bacteriocins are antimicrobial peptides of bacterial origin that are considered as a promising alternative to the use of conventional antibiotics. Recently, our laboratory reported the purification and characterization of two lantibiotics, suicin 90–1330 and suicin 3908, produced by the swine pathogen and zoonotic agent Streptococcus suis (serotype 2). In this study, a novel bacteriocin produced by S. suis has been identified and characterized. The producing strain S. suis 65 (serotype 2) was found to belong to the sequence type 28, that includes strains known to be weakly or avirulent in a mouse model. The bacteriocin, whose production was only possible following growth on solid culture medium, was purified to homogeneity by cationic exchange and reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. The bacteriocin, named suicin 65, was heat, pH and protease resistant. Suicin 65 was active against all S. suis isolates tested, including antibiotic resistant strains. Amino acid sequencing of the purified bacteriocin by Edman degradation revealed the presence of modified amino acids suggesting a lantibiotic. Using the partial sequence obtained, a blast was performed against published genomes of S. suis and allowed to identify a putative lantibiotic locus in the genome of S. suis 89–1591. From this genome, primers were designed and the gene cluster involved in the production of suicin 65 by S. suis 65 was amplified by PCR. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of ten open reading frames, including a duplicate of the structural gene. The structural genes (sssA and sssA’) of suicin 65 encodes a 25-amino acid residue leader peptide and a 26-amino acid residue mature peptide yielding an active bacteriocin with a deducted molecular mass of 3,005 Da. Mature suicin 65 showed a high degree of identity with class I type B lantibiotics (globular structure) produced by Streptococcus pyogenes (streptococcin FF22; 84.6%), Streptococcus macedonicus (macedocin ACA-DC 198; 84.6%), and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (lacticin 481; 74.1%). Further studies will evaluate the ability of suicin 65 or the producing strain to prevent experimental S. suis infections in pigs."
https://openalex.org/W2216965264,"Background The diagnostic and prognostic value of microRNAs (miRNAs) in a variety of diseases is promising. The novel silicon nanowire (SiNW) biosensors have advantages in molecular detection because of their high sensitivity and fast response. In this study, poly-crystalline silicon nanowire field-effect transistor (poly-SiNW FET) device was developed to achieve specific and ultrasensitive detection of miRNAs without labeling and amplification. Methods The poly-SiNW FET was fabricated by a top–down Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) wafer fabrication based technique. Single strand DNA (ssDNA) probe was bind to the surface of the poly-SiNW device which was silanated and aldehyde-modified. By comparing the difference of resistance value before and after ssDNA and miRNA hybridization, poly-SiNW device can be used to detect standard and real miRNA samples. Results Poly-SiNW device with different structures (different line width and different pitch) was applied to detect standard Let-7b sample with a detection limitation of 1 fM. One-base mismatched sequence could be distinguished meanwhile. Furthermore, these poly-SiNW arrays can detect snRNA U6 in total RNA samples extracted from HepG2 cells with a detection limitation of 0.2 μg/mL. In general, structures with pitch showed better results than those without pitch in detection of both Let-7b and snRNA U6. Moreover, structures with smaller pitch showed better detection efficacy. Conclusion Our findings suggest that poly-SiNW arrays could detect standard and real miRNA sample without labeling or amplification. Poly-SiNW biosensor device is promising for miRNA detection."
https://openalex.org/W2201194739,"Metastatic Ewing Sarcoma carries a poor prognosis, and novel therapeutics to prevent and treat metastatic disease are greatly needed. Recent evidence demonstrates that tumor-associated macrophages in Ewing Sarcoma are associated with more advanced disease. While some macrophage phenotypes (M1) exhibit anti-tumor activity, distinct phenotypes (M2) may contribute to malignant progression and metastasis. In this study, we show that M2 macrophages promote Ewing Sarcoma invasion and extravasation, pointing to a potential target of anti-metastatic therapy. CNI-1493 is a selective inhibitor of macrophage function and has shown to be safe in clinical trials as an anti-inflammatory agent. In a xenograft mouse model of metastatic Ewing Sarcoma, CNI-1493 treatment dramatically reduces metastatic tumor burden. Furthermore, metastases in treated animals have a less invasive morphology. We show in vitro that CNI-1493 decreases M2-stimulated Ewing Sarcoma tumor cell invasion and extravasation, offering a functional mechanism through which CNI-1493 attenuates metastasis. These data indicate that CNI-1493 may be a safe and effective adjuvant agent for the prevention and treatment of metastatic Ewing Sarcoma."
https://openalex.org/W2213701964,"In non-clinical studies, the proteasome inhibitor ixazomib inhibits cell growth in a broad panel of solid tumor cell lines in vitro. In contrast, antitumor activity in xenograft tumors is model-dependent, with some solid tumors showing no response to ixazomib. In this study we examined factors responsible for ixazomib sensitivity or resistance using mouse xenograft models. A survey of 14 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 6 colon xenografts showed a striking relationship between ixazomib activity and KRAS genotype; tumors with wild-type (WT) KRAS were more sensitive to ixazomib than tumors harboring KRAS activating mutations. To confirm the association between KRAS genotype and ixazomib sensitivity, we used SW48 isogenic colon cancer cell lines. Either KRAS-G13D or KRAS-G12V mutations were introduced into KRAS-WT SW48 cells to generate cells that stably express activated KRAS. SW48 KRAS WT tumors, but neither SW48-KRAS-G13D tumors nor SW48-KRAS-G12V tumors, were sensitive to ixazomib in vivo. Since activated KRAS is known to be associated with metabolic reprogramming, we compared metabolite profiling of SW48-WT and SW48-KRAS-G13D tumors treated with or without ixazomib. Prior to treatment there were significant metabolic differences between SW48 WT and SW48-KRAS-G13D tumors, reflecting higher oxidative stress and glucose utilization in the KRAS-G13D tumors. Ixazomib treatment resulted in significant metabolic regulation, and some of these changes were specific to KRAS WT tumors. Depletion of free amino acid pools and activation of GCN2-eIF2α-pathways were observed both in tumor types. However, changes in lipid beta oxidation were observed in only the KRAS WT tumors. The non-clinical data presented here show a correlation between KRAS genotype and ixazomib sensitivity in NSCLC and colon xenografts and provide new evidence of regulation of key metabolic pathways by proteasome inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2220330935,"Studies have suggested a link between the transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) signaling cascade and the stress-inducible activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3). We have demonstrated that triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TGRL) lipolysis products activate MAP kinase stress associated JNK/c-Jun pathways resulting in up-regulation of ATF3, pro-inflammatory genes and induction of apoptosis in human aortic endothelial cells. Here we demonstrate increased release of active TGF-β at 15 min, phosphorylation of Smad2 and translocation of co-Smad4 from cytosol to nucleus after a 1.5 h treatment with lipolysis products. Activation and translocation of Smad2 and 4 was blocked by addition of SB431542 (10 μM), a specific inhibitor of TGF-β-activin receptor ALKs 4, 5, 7. Both ALK receptor inhibition and anti TGF-β1 antibody prevented lipolysis product induced up-regulation of ATF3 mRNA and protein. ALK inhibition prevented lipolysis product-induced nuclear accumulation of ATF3. ALKs 4, 5, 7 inhibition also prevented phosphorylation of c-Jun and TGRL lipolysis product-induced p53 and caspase-3 protein expression. These findings demonstrate that TGRL lipolysis products cause release of active TGF-β and lipolysis product-induced apoptosis is dependent on TGF-β signaling. Furthermore, signaling through the stress associated JNK/c-Jun pathway is dependent on TGF-β signaling suggesting that TGF-β signaling is necessary for nuclear accumulation of the ATF3/cJun transcription complex and induction of pro-inflammatory responses."

The conserved meiosis-specific Dmc1 recombinase catalyzes homologous recombination triggered by DNA double strand breaks through the exchange of parental DNA sequences. Although providing an efficient rate of DNA strand exchange between polymorphic alleles, Dmc1 must also guard against recombination between divergent sequences. How DNA mismatches affect Dmc1-mediated DNA strand exchange is not understood. We have used fluorescence resonance energy transfer to study the mechanism of Dmc1-mediated strand exchange between DNA oligonucleotides with different degrees of heterology. The efficiency of strand exchange is highly sensitive to the location, type, and distribution of mismatches. Mismatches near the 3′ end of the initiating DNA strand have a small effect, whereas most mismatches near the 5′ end impede strand exchange dramatically. The Hop2-Mnd1 protein complex stimulates Dmc1-catalyzed strand exchange on homologous DNA or containing a single mismatch. We observed that Dmc1 can reject divergent DNA sequences while bypassing a few mismatches in the DNA sequence. Our findings have important implications in understanding meiotic recombination. First, Dmc1 acts as an initial barrier for heterologous recombination, with the mismatch repair system providing a second level of proofreading, to ensure that ectopic sequences are not recombined.

Homologous recombination (HR) 2The abbreviations used are: HR, homologous recombination; DSBs, double-strand breaks; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; TAMRA, tetramethylrhodamine; FE, fluorescence emission. is a major, conserved pathway for the repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). During meiosis, HR establishes physical linkages between homologous chromosomes from maternal and paternal origins as pairs. These linkages produce chiasmata, which are the cytological manifestation of the crossover products of HR. Together with sister chromatid cohesion, these chromosome crossovers ensure the orderly segregation of each chromosome pair in the first meiotic division (1Kleckner N. Meiosis: how could it work?.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 8167-8174Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 2Roeder G.S. Meiotic chromosomes: it takes two to tango.Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2600-2621Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). The cells derived from the meiotic cell division have half the number of chromosomes as their parent, which is an essential feature of sexual reproduction involving the generation of haploid gametes. Errors in meiotic chromosome segregation lead to miscarriages and Down, Klinefelter, Edwards, and Turner syndromes in humans, which are all characterized by aneuploidy stemming from a deficiency in meiotic chromosome segregation (3Hassold T.J.

Meiotic HR is initiated by cleavage of chromosomal DNA at multiple sites by the Spo11 protein to generate DSBs (6Keeney S. Giroux C.N. Kleckner N.

These DSBs are processed by nucleases to generate 3′ single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) tails (7Neale M.J. Pan J. Keeney S.

Bidirectional resection of DNA double-strand breaks by Mre11 and Exo1.Nature. 2011; 479: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). A recombinase polymerizes on the ssDNA tails to form a helical nucleoprotein filament, termed the presynaptic filament, capable of searching for, interacting with, and invading a homologous double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) target in a reaction named homologous pairing (9Neale M.J.

The heteroduplex region formed by homologous pairing is expanded in the next step, referred to as DNA strand exchange. In most eukaryotes, homologous DNA pairing and strand exchange are catalyzed by Dmc1 and Rad51 proteins, which are structural and functional homologues of the bacterial recombinase RecA. Whereas Dmc1 acts specifically in meiosis, Rad51 functions in both meiosis and mitotic cells. Previous studies have suggested that, similar to Rad51 and RecA, the recognition of DNA homology by human Dmc1, which is strongly influenced by helix stability and mismatched base pairs, requires the preferential breathing of A:T base pairs (12Gupta R.C. Folta-Stogniew E. O'Malley S. Takahashi M. Radding C.M. Rapid exchange of A:T base pairs is essential for recognition of DNA homology by human Rad51 recombination protein.Mol.

Although bacterial RecA and eukaryotic Rad51 proteins have been well characterized, less is known about the mechanism by which Dmc1 promotes the recognition of homology and discriminates between homeologous DNA sequences. Notably, in vitro, eukaryotic recombinases usually exhibit a less robust strand exchange activity and higher tolerance to interruptions of homology than RecA protein (15Volodin A.A. Bocharova T.N.

At present, it is not clear if the ability of the eukaryotic recombinases to tolerate DNA mismatches during the catalysis of homologous DNA pairing and strand exchange is subject to regulation by their accessory factors. Indeed, the proper function of Dmc1 and Rad51 requires their interactions with several accessory proteins (see Refs. 9Neale M.J. Keeney S.

In this study, we have analyzed the effect of Hop2-Mnd1 in the Dmc1-catalyzed strand exchange reaction using homologous or mismatch-containing oligonucleotide substrates. Considering that homologous chromosomes diverge in their primary sequence (26Sebat J. Lakshmi B. Troge J. Alexander J. Young J. Lundin P. Månér S. Massa H. Walker M. Chi M. Navin N. Lucito R. Healy J. Hicks J. Ye K. Reiner A. Gilliam T.C. Trask B. Patterson N. Zetterberg A. Wigler M. Large-scale copy number polymorphism in the human genome.Science. 2004; 305: 525-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (1969) Google Scholar), the ability of Dmc1 to tolerate mismatches in the heteroduplex DNA joints may be crucial for successful HR between parental chromosomes. However, to ensure that HR occurs only between homologs, the Dmc1-mediated DNA strand exchange reaction must also exhibit a certain limit of tolerance of the number and types of DNA mismatches in carrying out DNA pairing and strand exchange. The lack of information in this important aspect of meiotic recombination has prompted us to study the effect of DNA mismatches on the efficiency of Dmc1-mediated DNA strand exchange. Specifically, we have carried out a systematic study of Dmc1-catalyzed DNA strand exchange with different mismatched substrates using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) techniques. Our results show that Dmc1-mediated strand exchange is highly sensitive to the location, type, and distribution of mismatches. The presence of a few mismatches at specific locations of the incoming strand can inhibit strand exchange considerably. This rejection of the incoming strand, which cannot be explained merely by changes in the stability of the duplex DNA, suggests a mechanism that uses ATP hydrolysis to amplify the fidelity of homology search, being akin to kinetic proofreading (27Sagi D.

A DNA binding site present on Mnd1 is needed for this Hop2-Mnd1 attribute. All the oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, Coralville, IA). Selected oligonucleotides were fluorescently labeled at the 3′ end with tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) or at the 5′ end with Cy5 and were purified by HPLC and PAGE. Unlabeled oligonucleotides were purified by PAGE. To prepare dsDNA, the complementary strands were mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and hybridized by cooling from 90 °C to room temperature over 2.5 h. The sequences of the oligonucleotides are shown in Table 1.

Briefly, the protein complex was purified by co-expressing His-tagged Hop2 and untagged Mnd1 in the same expression system and employing consecutive chromatographic steps on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid, MonoQ, Macro hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad), heparin-Sepharose, and MonoS columns. The concentration of proteins was determined by the Bradford assay. E. coli RecA protein was purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. Nucleoprotein complexes were formed by incubating Dmc1 protein (3 μm) with unlabeled 50-mer ssDNA (10 μm nucleotides) for 8 min at 37 °C in buffer (250 μl, final volume) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 3 mm ATP, and 100 μg/ml of BSA. The strand exchange reaction was initiated by adding labeled dsDNA (5 μm base pairs) and incubated at 37 °C for 40 min. Variation in the fluorescence emission (FE) of TAMRA was recorded every 1.25 s at 580 nm on excitation at 556 nm. FRET measurements were performed using an ISS-PC1 photon counting spectrofluorometer (ISS Inc.). For DNA strand exchange reactions done with Hop2-Mnd1, Dmc1 (3 μm) was incubated with ssDNA in the same buffer for 5 min at 37 °C, followed by the addition of wild type or mutant Hop2-Mnd1 and incubated for an additional 5 min. Then, the strand exchange reaction was initiated by the addition of labeled dsDNA. Dmc1 and Hop2-Mnd1 were used at a 4:1 molar ratio. RecA-ssDNA filaments were formed by incubating RecA (0.4 μm) with unlabeled ssDNA (10 μm nucleotides) for 2 min at 37 °C. The DNA and buffer conditions were identical as described for the Dmc1 reaction, except that ATP was present at 1 mm and an ATP-regenerating system (7.5 mm creatine phosphate and 30 units ml−1 creatine kinase) was added. The reaction was carried out for 22 min. Fig. 1A illustrates our experimental design for measuring DNA strand exchange catalyzed by the recombinases (see also Results). The fraction of dsDNA having undergone strand exchange (x) was calculated using the following equation: d2.x + d1.(1-x) = d; where “d1” is the fluorescence emission from the donor (TAMRA) measured in a sample containing fully hybridized labeled duplexes, “d2” is the emission from the donor measured in a sample containing non-hybridized labeled oligonucleotides, and “d” is the measured emission of the donor, respectively. The relative strand exchange efficiency was calculated as the increase of FE at 580 nm at the end of the reaction (tf) relative to the value obtained with the homologous ssDNA (which was set as 1 for each oligonucleotide group): (FEtf − FEt0) ssDNA/(FEtf − FEt0) homologous. An essential attribute of recombinases is the ability to search for a homologous sequence amid an excess of heterologous DNA, and to discriminate against target sequences that are not completely homologous to the initiating ssDNA. During DNA homology search, the Dmc1-ssDNA presynaptic filament engages a duplex DNA molecule and samples segments of the duplex DNA until homology is found. However, for successful recombination between chromosome homologs to occur, the presynaptic filament must be able to tolerate a certain level of heterology between the recombining DNA molecules. These characteristics for Dmc1-mediated strand exchange reactions are poorly understood. We have examined the influence of DNA heterologies on Dmc1-promoted HR by conducting a systematic study of DNA strand exchange between oligonucleotides with different degrees of heterology using a FRET-based method. The scheme shown in Fig. 1A illustrates our experimental design, which follows procedures described previously (27Sagi D. Tlusty T. Stavans J. High fidelity of RecA-catalyzed recombination: a watchdog of genetic diversity.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 5021-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, linear dsDNA was formed by annealing complementary oligonucleotides each labeled with a fluorescent dye that constitutes a donor (3′TAMRA)-acceptor (5′Cy5) pair (Fig. 1A). The labeled dsDNA was mixed with linear unlabeled ssDNA complementary to the TAMRA strand and that was preincubated with Dmc1. In the absence of strand exchange, the donor-acceptor pair yields high transfer efficiency due to their close proximity. Fluorescence emission of the donor (TAMRA) at 580 nm becomes greatly enhanced upon DNA strand exchange because of the replacement of the Cy5-oligonucleotide by the unlabeled DNA. In experiments to be described in the following sections, the FRET assay was used to study the effects of the position, number, and type of DNA mismatches on the efficiency of strand exchange catalyzed by human Dmc1 and E. coli RecA. In initial experiments, we examined ssDNA substrates that differ from the 50-bp duplex target by a single TG mismatch or three such mismatches being located at different positions (Fig. 1B). Fig. 1, C and D, show the fraction of duplex DNA that undergoes exchange as a function of Dmc1 concentration. Under the experimental conditions used, Dmc1 binds to all the ssDNA oligonucleotides used in our study (not shown). With the fully homologous DNA substrates, the fraction of the duplex substrate that had undergone exchange was 0.07 with 3 μm Dmc1 (Fig. 1, C and D), reaching a maximum of 0.15 with 6 μm Dmc1 (not shown). The presence of one TG mismatch near the 3′ end of the initiating ssDNA (3′ TG) did not affect strand exchange appreciably, but a mismatch either in the middle or the 5′ end of the ssDNA (midTG and 5′ TG, respectively) had a significant negative impact in this regard (Fig. 1, B and C). With the substrates that harbor 3 mismatches, the location of the mismatches also had a distinct effect on strand exchange efficiency. Specifically, whereas little negative effect occurred with the ssDNA wherein all 3 mismatches are located near the 3′ end of the DNA (3MM3′), a large reduction in strand exchange efficiency was seen when the mismatches were either uniformly distributed over the substrate (3MMunif) or clustered within the middle of the substrate (3MMmid) (Fig. 1, B and D). With the heterologous ssDNA (28 mismatches, 60% of divergence), DNA strand exchange was reduced to the background level. We note that the use of oligonucleotides with slightly different sequences did not apparently influence the effect of the number and position of mismatches in DNA strand exchange (oligonucleotides Group 1–4, see below). We next asked whether the placement of the reporter dyes would affect the outcome of strand exchange. We prepared another set of substrates with the locations of the fluorophores being reversed (i.e. TAMRA at the 5′ end and Cy5 at the 3′ end) in the duplex substrate. Importantly, we again observed a similar bias in strand exchange, with the 5′ mismatch affecting the efficiency of the reaction much more than the 3′ mismatch (Fig. 1, E and F). Taken together, the results show that the presence of a single mismatch in 50-mer substrates can affect Dmc1-mediated DNA strand exchange significantly, although the position of the mismatch appears to be a critical factor in this regard. The general trend is that strand exchange efficiency decreases with the mismatch being proximal to the 5′ end of the initiating ssDNA strand. The strong influence of mismatches located at the 5′ versus 3′ end of the initiating ssDNA could stem from the directionality in the Dmc1-mediated strand exchange process. Previous studies showed that DNA strand exchange efficiency is attenuated when the GC content of the substrates increases (30Gupta R.C. Golub E.I. Wold M.S. Radding C.M. Polarity of DNA strand exchange promoted by recombination proteins of the RecA family.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 9843-9848Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore, strand exchange was assayed using oligonucleotide substrates with a GC-rich region present at either the 5′ or 3′ end of the ssDNA (Fig. 2A). The presynaptic filament was formed on the oligonucleotide RG1(−) (3′, 71% GC content, 42-mer) or RG2(−) (5′, 71% GC content, 42-mer) and paired with the corresponding duplex. Dmc1 could mediate DNA strand exchange with both pairs of substrates, but more efficiently with the ssDNA that harbors high GC content at its 5′ end (Fig. 2B). The strand exchange bias observed is consistent with strand exchange being propagated in the 3′-5′ direction with respect to the initiating ssDNA. As a control, we examined the action of RecA protein, which is known to promote exchange in the 5′-3′ direction (30Gupta R.C. Golub E.I. Wold M.S. Radding C.M. Polarity of DNA strand exchange promoted by recombination proteins of the RecA family.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 9843-9848Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In contrast to what was observed for Dmc1, the RecA reaction occurred more rapidly with the ssDNA substrate in which the GC-rich region lies within the 3′ end of the substrate (Fig. 2C). The findings reported here show that in short range interactions involving the exchange of a few dozen base pairs, Dmc1 promotes strand exchange in a 3′-5′ direction, which is opposite to that of RecA. Thus, the strong influence of 5′ mismatches on Dmc1 may be unrelated to the directionality of the strand exchange reaction. Alternatively, inhibition of strand exchange by mismatches located at the 5′ end of the initiating ssDNA may be explained by differences in the stability of the dsDNA product of the reaction. In this case, lower duplex DNA melting temperature may favor the reverse reaction of strand exchange. However, a comparative analysis indicates that the melting temperature of duplex products containing specific single mismatches at either the 5′ or 3′ end of the initiating ssDNA is similar (Fig. 2, D and E), but the relative efficiency of strand exchange involving these substrates is clearly dependent on the location and type of the mismatch. In summary, there is no correlation between the melting temperature of the duplex product of strand exchange and the strength of inhibition of the strand exchange reaction by a DNA mismatch. We asked whether the DNA mismatch type exert an effect on the strand exchange efficiency. For this, we constructed four different duplex substrates with each differing by 1 base pair in three fixed positions to each ssDNA substrates that we used alongside the control that is completely homologous to the duplex (Fig. 3A). This allowed us to study the effect of all 12 types of single mismatches at three different positions between the recombining DNA molecules (near the 5′ end, in the middle, or near 3′ end). The results from this extensive series of experiments are shown in Fig. 3, B–D. The general trend is that Dmc1 strand exchange is more sensitive to different types of mismatches when they are located at the 5′ end of the initiating ssDNA, with the following order of severity of inhibition: CA ≈ CC > GG ≈ TG ≈ AA ≈ TC ≈ AG ≈ AC ≈ GA > GT ≈ CT ≈ TT. Some mismatches located in the center of the ssDNA substrate, namely, TG, GG, AG and AA, also resulted in an inhibition of strand exchange, but most mismatches located at the 3′ end did not show any inhibitory effect. Interestingly, contrary to that observed when a TT mismatch was located at the 5′ end, a TT mismatch at the 3′ end resulted in a large reduction of Dmc1 strand exchange efficiency. We also note that, whereas TG and TC mismatches at the 5′ end inhibited strand exchange considerably, GT and CT mismatches had no effect. We proceeded to analyze the effect on Dmc1-catalyzed strand exchange of oligonucleotides containing two and three mismatches. The results obtained with these substrates (oligonucleotides of Group 1) are shown in FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, respectively. We observed that the efficiency of strand exchange mainly depends on the type of mismatch present at the 5′ position, whereas the frequency of mismatches has less influence. For example, the presence of a TG or TC mismatch at the 5′ position (in oligonucleotides containing two or three mismatches) led to a strong inhibition of strand exchange, independently of the mismatch type present in"
https://openalex.org/W2288051797,"Phospholipase C-related catalytically inactive protein (PRIP) was first identified as an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-binding protein, and was later found to be involved in a variety of cellular events, particularly those related to protein phosphatases. We previously reported that Prip knock-out (KO) mice exhibit a lean phenotype with a small amount of white adipose tissue. In the present study, we examined whether PRIP is involved in energy metabolism, which could explain the lean phenotype, using high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Prip-KO mice showed resistance to HFD-induced obesity, resulting in protection from glucose metabolism dysfunction and insulin resistance. Energy expenditure and body temperature at night were significantly higher in Prip-KO mice than in wild-type mice. Gene and protein expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), a thermogenic protein, was up-regulated in Prip-KO brown adipocytes in thermoneutral or cold environments. These phenotypes were caused by the promotion of lipolysis in Prip-KO brown adipocytes, which is triggered by up-regulation of phosphorylation of the lipolysis-related proteins hormone-sensitive lipase and perilipin, followed by activation of UCP1 and/or up-regulation of thermogenesis-related genes (e.g. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α). The results indicate that PRIP negatively regulates UCP1-mediated thermogenesis in brown adipocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2202392957,"We studied the response of the barn owl annual productivity to the common vole population numbers and variability to test the effects of environmental stochasticity on their life histories. Current theory predicts that temporal environmental variability can affect long-term nonlinear responses (e.g., production of young) both positively and negatively, depending on the shape of the relationship between the response and environmental variables. At the level of the Czech Republic, we examined the shape of the relationship between the annual sum of fledglings (annual productivity) and vole numbers in both non-detrended and detrended data. At the districts’ level, we explored whether the degree of synchrony (measured by the correlation coefficient) and the strength of the productivity response increase (measured by the regression coefficient) in areas with higher vole population variability measured by the s-index. We found that the owls’ annual productivity increased linearly with vole numbers in the Czech Republic. Furthermore, based on district data, we also found that synchrony between dynamics in owls’ reproductive output and vole numbers increased with vole population variability. However, the strength of the response was not affected by the vole population variability. Additionally, we have shown that detrending remarkably increases the Taylor’s exponent b relating variance to mean in vole time series, thereby reversing the relationship between the coefficient of variation and the mean. This shift was not responsible for the increased synchrony with vole population variability. Instead, we suggest that higher synchrony could result from high food specialization of owls on the common vole in areas with highly fluctuating vole populations."
https://openalex.org/W2204601510,"Regenerative dental therapies for bone tissues rely on efficient targeting of endogenous and transplanted mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to guide bone formation. Amelogenin is the primary component of Emdogain, which is used to regenerate periodontal defects; however, the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects on alveolar bone remain unclear. The tetracycline (Tet)-dependent transcriptional regulatory system is a good candidate to investigate distinct roles of genes of interest during stem cell differentiation. Here, we investigated amelogenin-dependent regulation of osteogenesis in MSCs by establishing a Tet-controlled transcriptional activation system. Clonal mouse bone marrow-derived MSCs were lentivirally transduced with the Tet repressor (TetR) expression vector followed by drug selection to obtain MSCs constitutively expressing TetR (MSCs-TetR). Expression vectors that contained the Tet operator and amelogenin-coding (Amelx) cDNA fragments were constructed using the Gateway system and lentivirally introduced into MSCs-TetR to generate a Tet regulation system in MSCs (MSCs-TetR/Amelx). MSCs-TetR/Amelx significantly overexpressed the Amelx gene and protein in the presence of the tetracycline derivative doxycycline. Concomitant expression of osterix, bone sialoprotein (BSP), osteopontin, and osteocalcin was modulated by addition or removal of doxycycline under osteogenic guidance. During osteogenic induction, MSCs-TetR/Amelx treated with doxycycline showed significantly increased gene expression of osterix, type I collagen, BSP, and osteocalcin in addition to increased alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralized nodule formation. Enhanced extracellular matrix calcification was observed when forced Amelx expression commenced at the early stage but not at the intermediate or late stages of osteogenesis. These results suggest that a Tet-controlled Amelx gene regulation system for mouse MSCs was successfully established, in which transcriptional activation of Amelx was associated with enhanced osteogenic differentiation, especially in the early stage of biomineralization."
https://openalex.org/W2212824388,"We investigated whether the frequency, phenotype, and suppressive function of CD4+ FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) are altered in young TS patients with the 45,X karyotype compared to age-matched controls.Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from young TS patients (n = 24, 17.4-35.9 years) and healthy controls (n = 16) were stained with various Treg markers to characterize their phenotypes. Based on the presence of thyroid autoimmunity, patients were categorized into TS (-) (n = 7) and TS (+) (n = 17). Tregs sorted for CD4+ CD25bright were co-cultured with autologous CD4+ CD25- target cells in the presence of anti-CD3 and -CD28 antibodies to assess their suppressive function.Despite a lower frequency of CD4+ T cells in the TS (-) and TS (+) patients (mean 30.8% and 31.7%, vs. 41.2%; P = 0.003 and P < 0.001, respectively), both groups exhibited a higher frequency of FOXP3+ Tregs among CD4+ T cells compared with controls (means 1.99% and 2.05%, vs. 1.33%; P = 0.029 and P = 0.004, respectively). There were no differences in the expression of CTLA-4 and the frequency of Tregs expressing CXCR3+, and CCR4+ CCR6+ among the three groups. However, the ability of Tregs to suppress the in vitro proliferation of autologous CD4+ CD25- T cells was significantly impaired in the TS (-) and TS (+) patients compared to controls (P = 0.003 and P = 0.041). Meanwhile, both the TS (-) and TS (+) groups had lower frequencies of naïve cells (P = 0.001 for both) but higher frequencies of effector memory cells (P = 0.004 and P = 0.002) than did the healthy control group.The Tregs of the TS patients could not efficiently suppress the proliferation of autologous effector T cells, despite their increased frequency in peripheral CD4+ T cells."

A recent study reported that more than a third of hospitalized women were non-adherent with breast cancer screening. The current study explores prevalence of socio-demographic and clinical variables associated with non-adherence to screening mammography recommendations among hospitalized women.A cross sectional bedside survey was conducted to collect socio-demographic and clinical comorbidity data thought to effect breast cancer screening adherence of hospitalized women aged 50-75 years. Logistic regression models were used to assess the association between these factors and non-adherence to screening mammography.Of 250 enrolled women, 61% were of low income, and 42% reported non-adherence to screening guidelines. After adjustment for socio-demographic and clinical predictors, three variables were found to be independently associated with non-adherence to breast cancer screening: low income (OR = 3.81, 95%CI; 1.84-7.89), current or ex-smoker (OR = 2.29, 95%CI; 1.12-4.67), and history of stroke (OR = 2.83, 95%CI; 1.21-6.60). By contrast, hospitalized women with diabetes were more likely to be compliant with breast cancer screening (OR = 2.70, 95%CI 1.35-5.34).Because hospitalization creates the scenario wherein patients are in close proximity to healthcare resources, at a time when they may be reflecting upon their health status, strategies could be employed to counsel, educate, and motivate these patients towards health maintenance. Capitalizing on this opportunity would involve offering screening during hospitalization for those who are overdue, particularly for those who are at higher risk of disease."
https://openalex.org/W2199984441,"Obesity is associated with a worse breast cancer prognosis, while greater breast tumor estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) expression is correlated with improved therapy response and survival. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of obesity on breast cancer cell ERβ expression, which is currently unknown. We utilized an in vitro model of obesity in which breast cancer cells were exposed to patient serum pooled by body mass index category (obese (OB): ≥30 kg/m2; normal weight (N): 18.5–24.9 kg/m2). Four human mammary tumor cell lines representing the major breast cancer subtypes (SKBR3, MCF-7, ZR75, MDA-MB-231) and mammary tumor cells from MMTV-neu mice were used. ERβ expression, assessed by qPCR and western blotting, was suppressed in the two HER2-overexpressing cell lines (SKBR3, MMTV-neu) following OB versus N sera exposure, but did not vary in the other cell lines. Expression of Bcl-2 and cyclin D1, two genes negatively regulated by ERβ, was elevated in SKBR3 cells following exposure to OB versus N sera, but this difference was eliminated when the ERβ gene was silenced with siRNA. Herceptin, a HER2 antagonist, and siRNA to HER2 were used to evaluate the role of HER2 in sera-induced ERβ modulation. SKBR3 cell treatment with OB sera plus Herceptin increased ERβ expression three-fold. Similar results were obtained when HER2 expression was silenced with siRNA. OB sera also promoted greater SKBR3 cell viability and growth, but this variance was not present when ERβ was silenced or the cells were modified to overexpress ERβ. Based on this data, we conclude that obesity-associated systemic factors suppress ERβ expression in breast cancer cells via a HER2-mediated pathway, leading to greater cell viability and growth. Elucidation of the mechanism(s) mediating this effect could provide important insights into how ERβ expression is regulated as well as how obesity promotes a more aggressive disease."
https://openalex.org/W2214984488,"CD4 T cells secreting IL-10 or IL-17 are frequent at mucosal sites, where their equilibrium is important for simultaneously maintaining tolerance and immunity to the resident microbiota. The mode of action of these cells, however, is as yet incompletely understood. In this study, we have combined ex vivo analysis of CD4 T cells producing IL-10 or/and IL-17 with assessment of clonal populations isolated ex vivo using a cytokine catch assay. We found that circulating CD4 T cells secreting IL-10 or/and IL-17 ex vivo include both conventional FOXP3- CD4 T cells and FOXP3+ Helios- Treg. Upon assessment of clonal populations derived from single ex vivo isolated cytokine secreting cells, we found that IL-10 or/and IL-17 secreting cells prevalently secrete one or the other cytokine depending on the type of stimulation, the time after stimulation and the presence of microbial products. Namely, IL-10 secretion by clonal cells was prevalent at early time points after TCR mediated stimulation, was independent of co-stimulation and was increased in the presence of the microbial fermentation product butyrate. In contrast, IL-17 secretion was higher at later time points after TCR mediated stimulation and in the presence of co-stimulatory signals. Taken together, these results provide insights into the mechanisms that, through modulation of cytokine secretion depending on conditions, allow IL-10 and IL-17 producing CD4 T cells to contribute to maintain tolerance to microbes locally, while retaining the ability to participate in protective immune responses at distant sites."
https://openalex.org/W2277280364,"Smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (SM-MLCK) is the key enzyme responsible for phosphorylation of regulatory myosin light chain (MLC20), resulting in actin-myosin cross-bridging and force generation in vascular smooth muscle required for physiological vasoreactivity and blood pressure control. In this study, we investigated the combinatorial role of myocardin/serum response factor (SRF) and Notch signaling in the transcriptional regulation of MLCK gene expression. Promoter reporter analyses in rat A10 smooth muscle cells revealed a bimodal pattern of MLCK promoter activity and gene expression upon stimulation with constitutively active Notch1 in presence of myocardin or by Jagged1 ligand stimulation. An initial Notch1-induced increase in MLCK transcription was followed by loss in promoter sensitivity, which could be restored with further Notch1 dose escalation. Real-time PCR analyses revealed that endogenous levels of Hairy Related Transcription (HRT) factor 2 (HRT2) peaked concurrently with inhibitory concentrations of Notch1. Forced expression of HRT2 demonstrated simultaneous repression of both myocardin- and Notch1-induced MLCK promoter activity. HRT2-mediated repression was further confirmed by HRT2 truncations and siHRT2 treatments that rescued MLCK promoter activity and gene expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies revealed both Jagged1 ligand- and Notch1-enhanced myocardin/SRF complex formation at the promoter CArG element. In contrast, heightened levels of HRT2 concomitantly disrupted myocardin/SRF and Notch transcription complex formation at respective CArG and CSL binding elements. Taken together, SM-MLCK promoter activity appears highly sensitive to the relative levels of Notch1 signaling, HRT2, and myocardin. These findings identify a novel Notch-dependent HRT2 autoregulatory circuit coordinating transcriptional regulation of SM-MLCK."

https://openalex.org/W2210230804,"Melting (MF) and non melting flesh (NMF) peaches differ in their final texture and firmness. Their specific characteristics are achieved by softening process and directly dictate fruit shelf life and quality. Softening is influenced by various mechanisms including cell wall reorganization and water loss. In this work, the biomechanical properties of MF Spring Crest's and NMF Oro A's exocarp and mesocarp along with the amount and localization of hydroxycinnamic acids and flavonoids were investigated during fruit ripening and post-harvest. The objective was to better understand the role played by water loss and cell wall reorganization in peach softening. Results showed that in ripe Spring Crest, where both cell turgor loss and cell wall dismantling occurred, mesocarp had a little role in the fruit reaction to compression and probe penetration response was almost exclusively ascribed to the epidermis which functioned as a mechanical support to the pulp. In ripe Oro A's fruit, where cell wall disassembly did not occur and the loss of cell turgor was observed only in mesocarp, the contribution of exocarp to fruit firmness was consistent but relatively lower than that of mesocarp, suggesting that in addition to cell turgor, the integrity of cell wall played a key role in maintaining NMF fruit firmness. The analysis of phenols suggested that permeability and firmness of epidermis were associated with the presence of flavonoids and hydroxycinnamic acids."
https://openalex.org/W2198611850,"Soybean is one of the most important crops grown across the globe. In the United States, approximately 15% of the soybean yield is suppressed due to various pathogen and pests attack. Sudden death syndrome (SDS) is an emerging fungal disease caused by Fusarium virguliforme. Although growing SDS resistant soybean cultivars has been the main method of controlling this disease, SDS resistance is partial and controlled by a large number of quantitative trait loci (QTL). A proteinacious toxin, FvTox1, produced by the pathogen, causes foliar SDS. Earlier, we demonstrated that expression of an anti-FvTox1 single chain variable fragment antibody resulted in reduced foliar SDS development in transgenic soybean plants. Here, we investigated if synthetic FvTox1-interacting peptides, displayed on M13 phage particles, can be identified for enhancing foliar SDS resistance in soybean. We screened three phage-display peptide libraries and discovered four classes of M13 phage clones displaying FvTox1-interacting peptides. In vitro pull-down assays and in vivo interaction assays in yeast were conducted to confirm the interaction of FvTox1 with these four synthetic peptides and their fusion-combinations. One of these peptides was able to partially neutralize the toxic effect of FvTox1 in vitro. Possible application of the synthetic peptides in engineering SDS resistance soybean cultivars is discussed."

The EV types (E-5, E-9, and E-18) exhibited a lower worldwide genetic diversity (respective number of genogroups: 4, 5, and 3) in comparison to CV-A9 (n = 10). The phylogenetic trees estimated with both 1D/VP1 and 3CD sequence data showed variations in the number of co-circulating lineages over the last 20 years among the four EV types. Despite the low number of genogroups in E-18, the virus exhibited the highest number of recombinant 3CD lineages (n = 10) versus 4 (E-5) to 8 (E-9). The phylogenies provided evidence of multiple transportation events between France and Tunisia involving E-5, E-9, E-18, and CV-A9 strains. Virus spread events between France and 17 other countries in five continents had high probabilities of occurrence as those between Tunisia and two European countries other than France. All transportation events were supported by BF values > 10. Inferring the source of virus transmission from phylogenetic data may provide insights into the patterns of sporadic and epidemic diseases caused by EVs."
https://openalex.org/W2209557315,"Bacterial chemoreceptors of the methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein (MCP) family operate in commingled clusters that enable cells to detect and track environmental chemical gradients with high sensitivity and precision. MCP homodimers of different detection specificities form mixed trimers of dimers that facilitate inter-receptor communication in core signaling complexes, which in turn assemble into a large signaling network. The two subunits of each homodimeric receptor molecule occupy different locations in the core complexes. One subunit participates in trimer-stabilizing interactions at the trimer axis, the other lies on the periphery of the trimer, where it can interact with two cytoplasmic proteins: CheA, a signaling autokinase, and CheW, which couples CheA activity to receptor control. As a possible tool for independently manipulating receptor subunits in these two structural environments, we constructed and characterized fused genes for the E. coli serine chemoreceptor Tsr that encoded single-chain receptor molecules in which the C-terminus of the first Tsr subunit was covalently connected to the N-terminus of the second with a polypeptide linker. We showed with soft agar assays and with a FRET-based in vivo CheA kinase assay that single-chain Tsr~Tsr molecules could promote serine sensing and chemotaxis responses. The length of the connection between the joined subunits was critical. Linkers nine residues or shorter locked the receptor in a kinase-on state, most likely by distorting the native structure of the receptor HAMP domain. Linkers 22 or more residues in length permitted near-normal Tsr function. Few single-chain molecules were found as monomer-sized proteolytic fragments in cells, indicating that covalently joined receptor subunits were responsible for mediating the signaling responses we observed. However, cysteine-directed crosslinking, spoiling by dominant-negative Tsr subunits, and rearrangement of ligand-binding site lesions revealed subunit swapping interactions that will need to be taken into account in experimental applications of single-chain chemoreceptors."

We investigated the mechanisms that underpin the beneficial effects of PDE5a inhibition through shRNA on post-MI heart failure.An adenoviral vector with an shRNA sequence inserted was adopted for the inhibition of phosphodiesterase 5a (Ad-shPDE5a) in vivo and in vitro. Myocardial infarction (MI) was induced in male C57BL/6J mice by left coronary artery ligation, and immediately after that, the Ad-shPDE5a was injected intramyocardially around the MI region and border areas.Four weeks post-MI, the Ad-shPDE5a-treated mice showed significant mitigation of the left ventricular (LV) dilatation and dysfunction compared to control mice. Infarction size and fibrosis were also significantly reduced in Ad-shPDE5a-treated mice. Additionally, Ad-shPDE5a treatment decreased the MI-induced inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and transforming growth factor-β1, which was confirmed in vitro in Ad-shPDE5a transfected myofibroblasts cultured under oxygen glucose deprivation. Finally, Ad-shPDE5a treatment was found to activate the myocardial Akt signaling pathway in both in vivo and in vitro experiments.These findings indicate that PDE5a inhibition by Ad-shPDE5a via the Akt signal pathway could be of significant value in the design of future therapeutics for post-MI heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W2199107040,"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is a genetic disorder characterized by tissue-specific tumors in the endocrine pancreas, parathyroid, and pituitary glands. Although tumor development in these tissues is dependent upon genetic inactivation of the tumor suppressor Men1, loss of both alleles of this gene is not sufficient to induce these cancers. Men1 encodes menin, a nuclear protein that influences transcription. A previous ChIP on chip analysis suggested that menin binds promoter sequences of nol3, encoding ARC, which is a cell death inhibitor that has been implicated in cancer pathogenesis. We hypothesized that ARC functions as a co-factor with Men1 loss to induce the tissue-restricted distribution of tumors seen in MEN1. Using mouse models that recapitulate this syndrome, we found that biallelic deletion of Men1 results in selective induction of ARC expression in tissues that develop tumors. Specifically, loss of Men1 in all cells of the pancreas resulted in marked increases in ARC mRNA and protein in the endocrine, but not exocrine, pancreas. Similarly, ARC expression increased in the parathyroid with inactivation of Men1 in that tissue. To test if ARC contributes to MEN1 tumor development in the endocrine pancreas, we generated mice that lacked none, one, or both copies of ARC in the context of Men1 deletion. Studies in a cohort of 126 mice demonstrated that, although mice lacking Men1 developed insulinomas as expected, elimination of ARC in this context did not significantly alter tumor load. Cellular rates of proliferation and death in these tumors were also not perturbed in the absence of ARC. These results indicate that ARC is upregulated by loss Men1 in the tissue-restricted distribution of MEN1 tumors, but that ARC is not required for tumor development in this syndrome."

Patients with CF suffer from chronic infections and severe inflammation, which lead to progressive pulmonary and gut diseases. Recently, an expanding body of evidence has suggested that iron homeostasis was abnormal in CF with, in particular, systemic iron deficiency and iron sequestration in the epithelium airway. The molecular mechanisms responsible for iron dysregulation and the relationship with inflammation in CF are unknown.We assessed the impact of CFTR deficiency on systemic and tissue iron homeostasis as well as inflammation in wildtype and CFTR knockout (KO) mice. First, in contrast to the systemic and intestinal inflammation we observed in the CFTR KO mice, we reported the absence of lung phenotype with regards to both inflammation and iron status. Second, we showed a significant decrease of plasma ferritin levels in the KO mice, as in CF patients, likely caused by a decrease in spleen ferritin levels. However, we measured unchanged plasma iron levels in the KO mice that may be explained by increased intestinal iron absorption.These results indicate that in CF, the lung do not predominantly contributes to the systemic ferritin deficiency and we propose the spleen as the major organ responsible for hypoferritinemia in the KO mouse. These results should provide a better understanding of iron dysregulation in CF patients where treating or not iron deficiency remains a challenging question."
https://openalex.org/W2280098964,"Thermoplasma acidophilum is a thermophilic archaeon that uses both non-phosphorylative Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway and Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway for glucose degradation. While triosephosphate isomerase (TPI), a well-known glycolytic enzyme, is not involved in the ED pathway in T. acidophilum, it has been considered to play an important role in the EMP pathway. Here, we report crystal structures of apo- and glycerol-3-phosphate-bound TPI from T. acidophilum (TaTPI). TaTPI adopts the canonical TIM-barrel fold with eight α-helices and parallel eight β-strands. Although TaTPI shares ~30% sequence identity to other TPIs from thermophilic species that adopt tetrameric conformation for enzymatic activity in their harsh physiological environments, TaTPI exists as a dimer in solution. We confirmed the dimeric conformation of TaTPI by analytical ultracentrifugation and size-exclusion chromatography. Helix 5 as well as helix 4 of thermostable tetrameric TPIs have been known to play crucial roles in oligomerization, forming a hydrophobic interface. However, TaTPI contains unique charged-amino acid residues in the helix 5 and adopts dimer conformation. TaTPI exhibits the apparent Td value of 74.6°C and maintains its overall structure with some changes in the secondary structure contents at extremely acidic conditions (pH 1-2). Based on our structural and biophysical analyses of TaTPI, more compact structure of the protomer with reduced length of loops and certain patches on the surface could account for the robust nature of Thermoplasma acidophilum TPI."
