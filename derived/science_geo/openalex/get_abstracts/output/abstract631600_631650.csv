Tandem cells that use only perovskite films have been less successful because of the lack of a suitable material with a low bandgap that can replace silicon. Tong et al. report that a mixed tin-lead organic-inorganic material containing a small fraction of guanidinium thiocyanate has a low bandgap, long charge-carrier lifetime, and efficiencies around 25%.

Immunotherapy targeting PD-1 has proven successful for certain types of cancer, but it remains unclear how PD-1 is regulated. Sugiura et al. found that a costimulatory molecule, CD80, can restrict PD-1 function during the activation of T lymphocytes. Binding of CD80 to the PD-1 ligand PD-L1 in cis on primary activated dendritic cells interfered with the ability of PD-L1 to access PD-1 on T cells, which would otherwise have inhibited T cell activation. Functional insights into PD-L1–CD80 interactions may explain the outcomes of anti–PD-1 and anti–PD-L1 cancer therapy. Science , this issue p. 558"

Cataloging small earthquakes is challenging because the small signal is often indistinguishable from noise. Ross et al. used a template-matching algorithm to find almost two million tiny earthquakes previously missed by other earthquake-logging techniques in Southern California (see the Perspective by Brodsky).

Taking a cue from multimeric transcription factor complexes, Bashor et al. developed synthetic transcriptional circuits that produce nonlinear behavior from cooperativity (see the Perspective by Ng and El-Samad). Their system uses clamp proteins with multiple protein-interaction domains. Circuit behavior can be tuned by altering the number or affinities of the interactions according to a mathematical model. The authors created synthetic circuits with desired functions common in biology, for example, switch-like behavior or Boolean decision functions. Science , this issue p. 593 ; see also p. 531"

With the development of deep learning, a semantic segmentation method with the SegNet that is based on fully convolutional network (FCN) was proposed. In this paper, RGB color images of seedling rice were captured in paddy field, and ground truth (GT) images were obtained by manually labeled the pixels in the RGB images with three separate categories, namely, rice seedlings, background, and weeds. The class weight coefficients were calculated to solve the problem of the unbalance of the number of the classification category. GT images and RGB images were used for data training and data testing. Eighty percent of the samples were randomly selected as the training dataset and 20% of samples were used as the test dataset. The proposed method was compared with a classical semantic segmentation model, namely, FCN, and U-Net models. The average accuracy rate of the SegNet method was 92.7%, whereas the average accuracy rates of the FCN and U-Net methods were 89.5% and 70.8%, respectively. The proposed SegNet method realized higher classification accuracy and could effectively classify the pixels of rice seedlings, background, and weeds in the paddy field images and acquire the positions of their regions."
https://openalex.org/W2936137022,"Angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) is a two-domain dipeptidylcarboxypeptidase involved in regulating blood pressure via the kallikrein-kininand renin-angiotensin-aldosterone complex. Therefore, ACE is a key drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular system diseases. At present many works are focus on searching for new inhibitory peptides of ACE to control the blood pressure. In order to exploit the interactions between ACE and its inhibitors, molecular dynamics simulations were used. The results showed that (a) the secondary structures of the three inhibitor-protein complexes did not change significantly; (b) root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), radius of gyration (Rg), and solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) values of Leu-Ile-Val-Thr (LIVT)-ACE complexes were significantly higher than that of other systems; (c) the backbone movement of LIVT was vigorous in Asp300-Val350, compared with that in Tyr-Leu-Val-Pro-His (YLVPH) and Tyr-Leu-Val-Arg(YLVR), as shown by the center-of-mass distance; and (d) the backbone movement of Asp300-Val350 may contribute to the interaction between ACE and its inhibitors. Our theoretical results will be helpful to further the design of specific inhibitors of ACE."
https://openalex.org/W2939751461,"The need for an efficacious vaccine against highly pathogenic filoviruses was reinforced by the recent and devastating 2014-2016 outbreak of Ebola virus (EBOV) disease in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia that resulted in more than 10,000 casualties. Such a vaccine would need to be vetted through a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) traditional, accelerated, or Animal Rule or similar European Medicines Agency (EMA) regulatory pathway. Under the FDA Animal Rule, vaccine-induced immune responses correlating with survival of non-human primates (NHPs), or another well-characterized animal model, following lethal EBOV challenge will need to be bridged to human immune response distributions in clinical trials. When possible, species-neutral methods are ideal for detection and bridging of these immune responses, such as methods to quantify anti-EBOV glycoprotein (GP) immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. Further, any method that will be used to support advanced clinical and non-clinical trials will most likely require formal validation to assess suitability prior to use. Reported here is the development, qualification, and validation of a Filovirus Animal Nonclinical Group anti-EBOV GP IgG Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (FANG anti-EBOV GP IgG ELISA) for testing human serum samples."
https://openalex.org/W2951993957,"Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) is one of the most cultured fish species over the world with many different breeds and plenty of published protocols for sperm cryopreservation. However, data regarding preservation of gonadal tissue and surrogate production is still missing. A protocol for freezing common carp spermatogonia was developed through varying different factors along a set of serial subsequent experiments. Among the six cryoprotectants tested, the best survival was achieved with dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). In the next experiment, a wide range of cooling rates (0.5–10°C/min) and different concentrations of Me2SO were tested resulting in the highest survival achieved using 2 M Me2SO and cooling rate of -1°C/min. When testing different tissue sizes and incubation times in the cryomedia, the highest viability was observed when incubating 100 mg tissue fragments for 30 min. Finally, sugar supplementation did not yield significant differences. When testing different equilibration (ES) and vitrification solutions (VS) used for needle-immersed vitrification, no significant differences were observed between the tested groups. Additionally, varied exposure time to VS did not improve the vitrification outcome where the viability was 4-fold lower than that of freezing. The functionality of cryopreserved cells was tested by interspecific transplantation into sterilized goldfish recipients. The exogenous origin of the germ cells in gonads of goldfish recipient was confirmed by molecular markers and incorporation rate was over 40% at 3 months post-transplantation. Results of this study can serve for long-term preservation of germplasm in carp which can be recovered in a surrogate recipient."
https://openalex.org/W2939755584,"Coffee leaf rust caused by the fungus Hemileia vastatrix is one of the most important leaf diseases of coffee plantations worldwide. Current knowledge of the H. vastatrix genome is limited and only a small fraction of the total fungal secretome has been identified. In order to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of its secretome, we aimed to sequence and assemble the entire H. vastatrix genome using two next-generation sequencing platforms and a hybrid assembly strategy. This resulted in a 547 Mb genome of H. vastatrix race XXXIII (Hv33), with 13,364 predicted genes that encode 13,034 putative proteins with transcriptomic support. Based on this proteome, 615 proteins contain putative secretion peptides, and lack transmembrane domains. From this putative secretome, 111 proteins were identified as candidate effectors (EHv33) unique to H. vastatrix, and a subset consisting of 17 EHv33 genes was selected for a temporal gene expression analysis during infection. Five genes were significantly induced early during an incompatible interaction, indicating their potential role as pre-haustorial effectors possibly recognized by the resistant coffee genotype. Another nine genes were significantly induced after haustorium formation in the compatible interaction. Overall, we suggest that this fungus is able to selectively mount its survival strategy with effectors that depend on the host genotype involved in the infection process."
https://openalex.org/W2939107238,"Background While a few studies have tried to estimate the economic burden of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) associated with air pollution, most previous studies have methodological limitations. For example, neither the cost of illness approach nor the value of a statistical life approach accounts for economic adjustment mechanisms (i.e., they do not include substitution of labor lost due to an illness with capital or other workers), and neither approach considers disease impact on physical and human capital. Furthermore, since new evidence shows that air pollution is also linked to diabetes, previous studies did not estimate the economic costs of diabetes associated with air pollution. The total economic costs of NCDs associated with air pollution under a comprehensive framework therefore remained unexplored. Objectives This study uses a human capital–augmented production function framework to analyze and estimate the macroeconomic impact of NCDs associated with air pollution in China in 1990–2030 and in 2015–2030. It makes several contributions—beyond those of the extant literature—to understanding the economic burden of NCDs associated with air pollution. It does this by accounting for economic adjustment mechanisms and by incorporating human capital into the model. Methods In our framework, aggregate output is produced according to a human capital–augmented production function that accounts for the effects of projected disease prevalence. NCDs associated with air pollution affect the aggregate output through three pathways: 1) Mortality effect—when working-age individuals die from a disease, aggregate output decreases because physical capital is an imperfect substitute for the loss of human capital in the production process. 2) Morbidity effect—when working-age individuals suffer from a disease but do not die from it, their contribution to overall output also decreases depending on disease severity; for example, they might work fewer hours or with lower productivity, or they might retire earlier. We also incorporate age-specific human capital to account for education-related productivity differences between members of different cohorts who are differentially affected by NCDs. 3) Treatment cost effect—when households in which members suffer from a disease use part of their savings to cover the out-of-pocket share of their treatment costs, physical capital accumulation diminishes. Our estimates are based on the recently updated Global Burden of Disease epidemiology data, which identify four pathways through which air pollution affects health: cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, cancer, and diabetes. Results Total losses from NCDs associated with air pollution in China in 1990–2030 are estimated to be $1,137 billion (constant 2010 USD) and in 2015–2030 are estimated to be $499 billion (constant 2010 USD). Cardiovascular diseases account for the highest burden, followed by chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes, and cancer. Treatment costs account for nearly 30% of the total economic burden of NCDs associated with air pollution. We also find that the share of economic burden associated with treatment costs is highest for diabetes. This is mainly driven by the fact that, on a per case basis, diabetes has a lower health burden than other diseases associated with air pollution. Discussion The NCDs associated with air pollution impose a large economic burden on China."
https://openalex.org/W2937056601,"Hibernating mammals experience prolonged periods of torpor and starvation during winter for up to 5-7 months. Though physical inactivity and malnutrition generally lead to profound loss of muscle mass and metabolic dysfunction in humans, hibernating bears show limited muscle atrophy and can successfully maintain locomotive function. These physiological features in bears allow us to hypothesize that hibernating bears uniquely alter the regulation of protein and energy metabolism in skeletal muscle which then contributes to ""muscle atrophy resistance"" against continued physical inactivity. In this study, alteration of signaling pathways governing protein and energy metabolisms was examined in skeletal muscle of the Japanese black bear (Ursus thibetanus japonicus). Sartorius muscle samples were collected from bear legs during late November (pre-hibernation) and early April (post-hibernation). Protein degradation pathways, through a ubiquitin-proteasome system (as assessed by increased expression of murf1 mRNA) and an autophagy-dependent system (as assessed by increased expression of atg7, beclin1, and map1lc3 mRNAs), were significantly activated in skeletal muscle following hibernation. In contrast, as indicated by a significant increase in S6K1 phosphorylation, an activation state of mTOR (mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin), which functions as a central regulator of protein synthesis, increased in post-hibernation samples. Gene expression of myostatin, a negative regulator of skeletal muscle mass, was significantly decreased post-hibernation. We also confirmed that the phenotype shifted toward slow-oxidative muscle and mitochondrial biogenesis. These observations suggest that protein and energy metabolism may be altered in skeletal muscle of hibernating bears, which then may contribute to limited loss of muscle mass and efficient energy utilization."
https://openalex.org/W2937536464,"Background Functional disability is a common health burden in older adults and follows a hierarchical pattern. Physical performance measures are useful for the objective estimation of functional disability. This study primarily aimed to compare the validity of handgrip strength and gait speed, alone and in combination, for recognizing the functional disability among Chinese older adults. This study also aimed to stratify the functional disability according to the criterion-referenced values of handgrip strength and gait speed. Methods We selected 6127 respondents from the 2011 wave of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study. Here, we defined functional disability as needing any help in any items of activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). To assess the validity of physical performance measures alone and in combination for the recognition of functional disability, we conducted the receiver operating characteristic analysis. Results Compared with handgrip strength, the gait speed could better discriminate ADL disability and showed a satisfactory discriminant validity (area under the curve ≥ 0.7) in men. However, this finding was not found in the recognition of IADL disability. When combining these two measures, the parallel test showed a high sensitivity with a poor specificity, whereas the serial test showed a perfect specificity with a poor sensitivity. Conclusion We developed the hierarchical cut-off values of handgrip strength and gait speed for identifying and stratifying the functional disability among Chinese adults over 60 years old. The speed test was superior to handgrip strength in identifying ADL disability. The parallel tests of those with high sensitivity perhaps could help identify the functional disability. Further work on cost-utility analysis is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2937687122,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays an important role in neurogenesis and synapse formation. The V66M is the most prevalent BDNF mutation in humans and impairs the function and distribution of BDNF. This mutation is related to several psychiatric disorders. The pro-region of BDNF, particularly position 66 and its adjacent residues, are determinant for the intracellular sorting and activity-dependent secretion of BDNF. However, it has not yet been fully elucidated. The present study aims to analyze the effects of the V66M mutation on BDNF structure and function. Here, we applied nine algorithms, including SIFT and PolyPhen-2, for functional and stability prediction of the V66M mutation. The complete theoretical model of BNDF was generated by Rosetta and validated by PROCHECK, RAMPAGE, ProSa, QMEAN and Verify-3D algorithms. Structural alignment was performed using TM-align. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the ConSurf server. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed and analyzed using the GROMACS 2018.2 package. The V66M mutation was predicted as deleterious by PolyPhen-2 and SIFT in addition to being predicted as destabilizing by I-Mutant. According to SNPeffect, the V66M mutation does not affect protein aggregation, amyloid propensity, and chaperone binding. The complete theoretical structure of BDNF proved to be a reliable model. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the V66M mutation of BDNF occurs at a non-conserved position of the protein. MD analyses indicated that the V66M mutation does not affect the BDNF flexibility and surface-to-volume ratio, but affects the BDNF essential motions, hydrogen-bonding and secondary structure particularly at its pre and pro-domain, which are crucial for its activity and distribution. Thus, considering that these parameters are determinant for protein interactions and, consequently, protein function; the alterations observed throughout the MD analyses may be related to the functional impairment of BDNF upon V66M mutation, as well as its involvement in psychiatric disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2938203016,"Background Melatonin stimulates the production of progesterone, which is essential for the maintenance of pregnancy. Since melatonin in blood is reduced due to work under illuminated conditions during night work, it has been hypothesized that night work may increase the risk of preterm birth. Previous meta-analyses have not revealed increased risk of preterm birth in women working night shifts during pregnancy. Still, these studies might have been limited by inaccurate self-reports of timing, intensity and duration of night work most likely causing bias towards the null. The aim of this is study was to investigate if the frequency and duration of night work during the first (week 1–12) and second (week 13–22) trimester of pregnancy were associated with risk of preterm birth when objective and prospective data on night work are used. Method In a register-based prospective cohort study, we obtained individual day-to-day information on working hours from The Danish Working Hour Database (DWHD, a payroll database including all public service employees in administrative Danish Regions from 2007–2013) and information on preterm birth from the Danish Medical Birth Registry. Night-shift was defined as at least three working hours between 23:00 and 06:00. Preterm birth was defined as giving birth during gestational weeks 23–37. Odds of preterm birth according to working night shifts were analysed by logistic regression. Results We identified 16,501 pregnant women eligible for the study, of which 10,202 women (61.8%) had at least one night-shift during the first 22 gestational weeks. The risk of preterm birth was not elevated among women working night shifts compared to women working only day shifts during either the first or second trimester. Within night-shift workers, the risk was not related to the number of night shifts, the duration of night shifts, consecutive night shifts or quick returns defined as short intervals between shifts. Odds of preterm birth was not related to change of working schedule from the first to second trimester, although women changing from night shifts in the first trimester to day work only in the second trimester displayed a weak increased odds of preterm birth (OR 1.21, 95%CI 0.98–1.49) compared to women working night shifts in both trimesters. Conclusion Our results, which are without bias from self-report of either exposure or outcome, are in line with the results of previous meta-analyses. Due to the detailed information on hours worked during pregnancy, we were able to investigate several dimensions of night work not previously investigated, of which none were associated with elevated risk of preterm birth."
https://openalex.org/W2938370846,"HIV infection is known to be associated with cardiometabolic abnormalities; here we investigated the progression and causes of these abnormalities. Three groups of participants were recruited: HIV-negative subjects and two groups of treatment-naïve HIV-positive subjects, one group initiating antiretroviral treatment, the other remaining untreated. Intima-media thickness (cIMT) increased in HIV-positive untreated group compared to HIV-negative group, but treatment mitigated the difference. We found no increase in diabetes-related metabolic markers or in the level of inflammation in any of the groups. Total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol and apoB levels were lower in HIV-positive groups, while triglyceride and Lp(a) levels did not differ between the groups. We found a statistically significant negative association between viral load and plasma levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, apoA-I and apoB. HIV-positive patients had hypoalphalipoproteinemia at baseline, and we found a redistribution of sub-populations of high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles with increased proportion of smaller HDL in HIV-positive untreated patients, which may result from increased levels of plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein in this group. HDL functionality declined in the HIV-negative and HIV-positive untreated groups, but not in HIV-positive treated group. We also found differences between HIV-positive and negative groups in plasma abundance of several microRNAs involved in lipid metabolism. Our data support a hypothesis that cardiometabolic abnormalities in HIV infection are caused by HIV and that antiretroviral treatment itself does not influence key cardiometabolic parameters, but mitigates those affected by HIV."
https://openalex.org/W2940262519,"Zoophilic members of the Anopheles gambiae complex are often associated with cattle. As such, it is likely that the immature aquatic stages will be exposed to cattle faeces as a pollutant. This study aimed to examine the effect of cattle manure on members of the An. gambiae complex found in South Africa. In this study, a commercial organic fertiliser originating from cattle manure was used as a proxy for cattle faeces. Laboratory strains of An. merus, An. quadriannulatus as well as four An. arabiensis strains (SENN and MBN: insecticide susceptible, MBN-DDT: insecticide resistant, unselected, SENN-DDT: insecticide resistant: selected for resistance) were used in this study. The effect of larval fertiliser exposure on larval development rate and adult longevity was assessed in all three species. The effect of larval fertiliser exposure on subsequent adult size, insecticide tolerance and detoxification enzyme activity of the four strains of the malaria vector An. arabiensis was also assessed. Following fertiliser treatment, all strains and species showed a significantly increased rate of larval development, with insecticide susceptible strains gaining the greatest advantage. The adult longevities of An. merus, An. quadriannulatus, insecticide susceptible and resistant An. arabiensis were significantly increased following fertiliser treatment. Insecticide susceptible and resistant An. arabiensis adults were significantly larger after larval organic fertiliser exposure. Larval fertiliser exposure also increased insecticide tolerance in adult An. arabiensis, particularly in the insecticide resistant, selected strain. This 4.7 fold increase in deltamethrin tolerance translated to an increase in pyrethroid resistance intensity, which could exert operational effects. In general, larval exposure to cattle faeces significantly affects the life histories of members of the An. gambiae complex."
https://openalex.org/W2937392788,"Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common malignant oral tumor in cats. The late presentation is one of the factors contributing to the detrimental prognosis of this disease. The immunohistochemical expression of the p53 tumor suppressor protein has been reported in 24% to 65% of feline oral squamous cell carcinomas, but no study has systematically evaluated in this tumor the presence of p53 encoding gene (TP53) mutations. The aim of this retrospective study was to determine whether p53 immunohistochemistry accurately reflects the mutational status of the TP53 gene in feline oral squamous cell carcinoma. Additionally, the prevalence of p53 dysregulation in feline oral squamous cell carcinoma was compared with that of feline non-neoplastic oral mucosa, in order to investigate the relevance of these dysregulations in cancer development. The association between p53 dysregulations and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and tumor characteristics was further assessed. Twenty-six incisional biopsies of oral squamous cell carcinomas and 10 cases each of lingual eosinophilic granuloma, chronic gingivostomatitis and normal oral mucosa were included in the study. Eighteen squamous cell carcinomas (69%) expressed p53 and 18 had mutations in exons 5-8 of TP53. The agreement between immunohistochemistry and mutation analysis was 77%. None of non-neoplastic oral mucosa samples had a positive immunohistochemical staining, while one case each of eosinophilic granuloma and chronic gingivostomatitis harbored TP53 mutations. Unlike previously hypothesized, p53 dysregulations were not associated with exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. These results suggest an important role of p53 in feline oral tumorigenesis. Additionally, the immunohistochemical detection of p53 expression appears to reflect the presence of TP53 mutations in the majority of cases. It remains to be determined if the screening for p53 dysregulations, alone or in association with other markers, can eventually contribute to the early detection of this devastating disease."
https://openalex.org/W2940391834,"Background Laboratory diagnosis of chronic Chagas disease is a troubling factor due to lack of reference tests. The WHO suggests the use of two distinct commercial serological tests in parallel. The performance of commercial immunoassays might fluctuate depending on the antigenic matrices and the local strains of T. cruzi in different geographical settings. The use of antigenic matrices based on chimeric proteins can solve these limitations. Here, we evaluated the diagnostic performance of two chimeric T. cruzi antigens (IBMP-8.1 and -8.4) to diagnose chronic Chagas disease in individuals from endemic South American countries. Methodology/Principal findings IBMP-8.1 and IBMP-8.4 chimeric antigens were expressed as soluble proteins in E. coli and purified using chromatography methods. Reactivity of IBMP-8.1 and IBMP-8.4 was assessed using an in-house ELISA with sera from 122 non-infected and 215 T. cruzi-infected individuals from Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay. Cut-off values were based on ROC curves and performance parameters were determined using a dichotomous approach. Area under the curve values were > 99.7% for both IBMP-8.1 and IBMP-8.4 antigens. IgG levels in T. cruzi-positive and negative samples were higher for IBMP-8.4 than IBMP-8.1. Both IBMP-8.1 and -8.4 were 100% specific, while IBMP-8.4 were 100% sensitive compared to IBMP-8.1 (95.3%). Admitting RI values of 1.0 ± 0.10 as the inconclusive interval, 6.2% of the samples tested using IBMP-8.1 and 2.1% using IBMP-8.4 fell inside the grey zone. Based on accuracy and diagnostic odds ratio values, IBMP-8.4 presented the best performance. Differences in sensitivity and IgG levels among the samples from Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay were not significant. Conclusions/Significance Our findings showed a notable performance of IBMP-8.1 and -8.4 chimeric antigens in diagnosing chronic Chagas disease in individuals from endemic South American countries, confirming our hypothesis that these antigens could be used in geographical areas where distinct T. cruzi DTUs occur."
https://openalex.org/W2938176811,"Hydrocarbons are important environmental pollutants, and the isolation and characterization of new microorganisms with the ability to degrade these compounds are important for effective biodegradation. In this work we isolated and characterized several bacterial isolates from compost, a substrate rich in microbial diversity. The isolates were obtained from selective culture medium containing n-hexadecane, aiming to recover alkane-degraders. Six isolates identified as Gordonia by MALDI-TOF and 16S rRNA sequencing had the ability to degrade n-hexadecane in three days. Two isolates were selected for genomic and functional characterization, Gordonia paraffinivorans (MTZ052) and Gordonia sihwensis (MTZ096). The CG-MS results showed distinct n-hexadecane degradation rates for MTZ052 and MTZ096 (86% and 100% respectively). The genome sequence showed that MTZ052 encodes only one alkane degrading gene cluster, the CYP153 system, while MTZ096 harbors both the Alkane Hydroxylase (AH) and the CYP153 systems. qPCR showed that both gene clusters are induced by the presence of n-hexadecane in the growth medium, suggesting that G. paraffinivorans and G. sihwensis use these systems for degradation. Altogether, our results indicate that these Gordonia isolates have a good potential for biotransformation of hydrocarbons."
https://openalex.org/W2935979427,"Introduction Achieving functional cure of chronic HBV infection (Hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] clearance, eventually followed by acquisition of anti-hepatitis B surface antigen [Anti-HBs]) in individuals with HIV and HBV infections is a rare event. In this setting, factors related to HBV cure have not yet been fully characterized. Methods HIV-infected individuals with chronic HBV infection enrolled in the French Dat’AIDS cohort (NCT02898987), who started combined antiretroviral (cART)-anti-HBV treatment were retrospectively analyzed for HBsAg loss and Anti-HBs seroconversion. Results Overall, 1419 naïve-subjects received three different cART-anti-HBV treatment schedule: (1) 3TC or FTC only (n = 150), (2) TDF with or without 3TC or FTC (n = 489) and (3) 3TC or FTC as first line followed by adding/switching to TDF as second line (n = 780). Individuals were followed-up for a median of 89 months (IQR, 56–118). HBV-DNA was < 15 IU/mL in 91% of individuals at the end of the follow-up. Overall, 97 individuals cleared HBsAg (0.7/100 patient-years), of whom, 67 seroconverted for Anti-HBs (0.5/100 patient-years). A high CD4 nadir, a short delay between HBV diagnosis and treatment, a longer time on HBV therapy, an African origin and TDF-based therapy were independent predictors of HBsAg clearance (Probability of odds ratio [OR]>1, >95%) suggested by Bayesian analysis. Also, TDF-based regimen as first line (OR, 3.03) or second line (OR, 2.95) increased rates of HBsAg clearance compared to 3TC or FTC alone, with a 99% probability. Conclusions HBsAg clearance rate was low in HIV-HBV co-infected cART-anti-HBV treated individuals, but was slightly improved on TDF-based regimen."
https://openalex.org/W2939057810,"This study compares the psychometric properties of two versions of the Lubben Social Network Scale (LSNS-18 and LSNS-6) with community dwelling older adults in Mongolia. We recruited 650 older adult in the capital city of Ulaanbaatar and the country’s four rural regions. We used the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15), the Short Form 12 (SF-12) physical and mental health functioning measures, and a multi-dimensional scale of social isolation for confirmatory factor analyses of the LSNS-18 and the LSNS-6. Both versions demonstrated excellent internal consistency and intraclass correlation and both correlated in expected directions with other study measures. Only the LSNS-6 provided a good fit to the data. The LSNS-6 is a viable instrument for assessing the social networks of older adults in Mongolia. The study adds to the sparse literature on measuring social and behavioral determinants of health in resource-constrained settings characterized by aging populations and high internal migration rates."
https://openalex.org/W2898648286,"The dioecious and andromonoecious Solanum taxa (the “S. dioicum group”) of the Australian Monsoon Tropics have been the subject of phylogenetic and taxonomic study for decades, yet much of their basic biology is still unknown. This is especially true for plant-animal interactions, including the influence of fruit form and calyx morphology on seed dispersal. We combine field/greenhouse observations and specimen-based study with phylogenetic analysis of seven nuclear regions obtained via a microfluidic PCR-based enrichment strategy and high-throughput sequencing, and present the first species-tree hypothesis for the S. dioicum group. Our results suggest that epizoochorous trample burr seed dispersal (strongly linked to calyx accrescence) is far more common among Australian Solanum than previously thought and support the hypothesis that the combination of large fleshy fruits and endozoochorous dispersal represents a reversal in this study group. The general lack of direct evidence related to biotic dispersal (epizoochorous or endozoochorous) may be a function of declines and/or extinctions of vertebrate dispersers. Because of this, some taxa might now rely on secondary dispersal mechanisms (e.g. shakers, tumbleweeds, rafting) as a means to maintain current populations and establish new ones."
https://openalex.org/W2936943972,"Social connection can be a rich source of happiness. Humans routinely go out of their way to seek out social connection and avoid social isolation. What are the proximal forces that motivate people to share experiences with others? Here we used a novel experience-sharing and decision-making paradigm to understand the value of shared experiences. In seven experiments across Studies 1 and 2, participants demonstrated a strong motivation to engage in shared experiences. At the same time, participants did not report a commensurate increase in hedonic value or emotional amplification, suggesting that the motivation to share experiences need not derive from their immediate hedonic value. In Study 3, participants reported their explicit beliefs about the reasons people engage in shared experiences: Participants reported being motivated by the desire to forge a social connection. Together, these findings suggest that the desire to share an experience may be distinct from the subjective experience of achieving that state. People may be so driven to connect with each other that social experiences remain valuable even in the most minimalistic contexts."
https://openalex.org/W2935845974,"Timing of menarche has largely been studied in the context of a secular trend. However, since mortality and fertility rates are fundamental demographic factors linked to a population’s developmental and reproductive characteristics, we expect that the timing of menarche, a precondition to reproduction, is also associated with these vital rates. We conduct an analysis of 89 countries and 21 demographic, socioeconomic, nutritional, and educational variables selected for their known influence on menarche. Model results predict that a country’s fertility and adult female mortality rates are significant predictors of mean age at menarche, while other covariates are not. Specifically, menarche is delayed in countries with high mortality and high fertility, which may be proxies for assessing overall environmental quality. We emphasize that, for a comprehensive understanding of the timing of menarche, it is critical to take into account both individual- and population-level influences."
https://openalex.org/W2936056031,"Complex interactions between HSV-1 and infiltrating immune cells play important roles in establishing localized, acute virus replication as well as chronic latent infection. The extent and duration of initial virus replication are the key determinants of subsequent pathologic inflammatory responses and therefore, the accumulation of immune cell populations at this time point is a key target for prevention. Therefore, we evaluated the role of various immune cell infiltrates between 1 h and 28 days post-infection (PI) using mice infected with virulent HSV-1 strain McKrae without corneal scarification. The effect of corneal scarification on immune cell infiltrates was also determined. We first determined the activation status and origin of macrophage infiltrates as early as 1 h PI. We found a sharp increase in the total macrophage population after 12 h PI, that was primarily due to infiltration of CCR2+ migratory macrophages, mostly in M1 status (MHC II+). The number of CCR2- resident macrophages, mostly unpolarized (M0), increased gradually over time and peaked at 48 h PI. Interestingly, some of the resident macrophages gained an M2-like phenotype (CD206Low), which peaked at 12 h PI, concurrent with M1 macrophage infiltration. From 1-7 days PI, infiltration of various immune cells correlated strongly with HSV-1 replication, with neutrophils showing the biggest increase, and NKT cells the biggest decrease, after infection. The presence of geographical ulcer did not correlate with increased infiltration, while mice with corneal scarring had significantly more immune cell infiltration than those without corneal scarring. Overall, we showed time-dependent infiltration of various immune cells in the eye of HSV-1 infected mice. Initial infiltration of macrophages followed by infiltration of T cells at later times PI demonstrates the importance of targeting macrophages rather than other immune cells type, for therapeutic treatment of HSV-1."
https://openalex.org/W2939561185,"Understanding the regulatory mechanisms within esophageal epithelia is essential to gain insight into the pathogenesis of esophageal diseases, which are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. The zinc-finger transcription factor Krüppel-like factor (KLF4) is implicated in a large number of cellular processes, such as proliferation, differentiation, and inflammation in esophageal epithelia. In murine esophageal epithelia, Klf4 overexpression causes chronic inflammation which is mediated by activation of NFκB signaling downstream of KLF4, and this esophageal inflammation produces epithelial hyperplasia and subsequent esophageal squamous cell cancer. Yet, while NFκB activation clearly promotes esophageal inflammation, the mechanisms by which NFκB signaling is activated in esophageal diseases are not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that the Rho-related GTP-binding protein RHOF is activated by KLF4 in esophageal keratinocytes, leading to the induction of NFκB signaling. Moreover, RHOF is required for NFκB activation by KLF4 in esophageal keratinocytes and is also important for esophageal keratinocyte proliferation and migration. Finally, we find that RHOF is upregulated in eosinophilic esophagitis, an important esophageal inflammatory disease in humans. Thus, RHOF activation of NFκB in esophageal keratinocytes provides a potentially important and clinically-relevant mechanism for esophageal inflammation and inflammation-mediated esophageal squamous cell cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2940206014,"Background Many middle- and high-income countries face the challenge of meeting preferences for home deaths. A better understanding of associated factors could support the design and implementation of policies and practices to enable dying at home. This study aims to identify factors associated with the place of death in Singapore, a country with a strong sense of filial piety. Settings/participants A retrospective cohort of 62,951 individuals (≥21 years old) who had died from chronic diseases in Singapore between 2012–2015 was obtained. Home death was defined as a death that occurred in a private residence whereas non-home deaths occurred in hospitals, nursing homes, hospices and other locations. Data were obtained by extracting and linking data from five different databases. Hierarchical multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the effects of individual, clinical and system factors sequentially. Results Twenty-eight percent of deaths occurred at home. Factors associated with home death included being 85 years old or older (OR 4.45, 95% CI 3.55–5.59), being female (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.16–1.25), and belonging to Malay ethnicity (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.82–2.01). Compared to malignant neoplasm, deaths as a result of diabetes mellitus (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.69–2.20), and cerebrovascular diseases (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.19–1.36) were also associated with a higher likelihood of home death. Independently, receiving home palliative care (OR 3.45, 95% CI 3.26–3.66) and having a documented home death preference (OR 5.08, 95% CI 3.96–6.51) raised the odds of home deaths but being admitted to acute hospitals near the end-of-life was associated with lower odds (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.90–0.94). Conclusion Aside from cultural and clinical factors, system-based factors including access to home palliative care and discussion and documentation of preferences were found to influence the likelihood of home deaths. Increasing home palliative care capacity and promoting advance care planning could facilitate home deaths if this is the desired option of patients."

This study aims to validate the Scale of Emotional Development-Short (SED-S) to provide an instrument for the assessment of socio-emotional brain functions.The SED-S was applied in 160 children aged 0-12 years. Criterion validity was investigated at item and scale level in terms of the agreement between the scale classification and the child's chronological age. Additionally, interrater reliability and internal consistency were assessed.For the majority of items, the expected response pattern emerged, showing the highest response probabilities in the respective target age groups. Agreement between the classification of the different SED-S domains and chronological age was high (κw = 0.95; exact agreement = 80.6%). Interrater reliability at domain level ranged from κw = .98 to 1.00 and internal consistency was high (α = .99).The study normed the SED-S in a sample of typically developing children and provides evidence for criterion validity on item, domain and scale level."
https://openalex.org/W2938215178,"The oncogenic Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) has two distinct life cycles with lifelong latent/non-productive and a sporadic lytic-reactivating/productive phases in the infected immune compromised human hosts. The virus reactivates from latency in response to various chemical or environmental stimuli, which triggers the lytic cascade and leads to the expression of immediate early gene, i.e. Replication and Transcription Activator (K-RTA). K-RTA, the latent-to-lytic switch protein, activates the expression of early (E) and late (L) lytic genes by transactivating multiple viral promoters. Expression of K-RTA is shown to be sufficient and essential to switch the latent virus to enter into the lytic phase of infection. Similarly, the virus-encoded bZIP family of protein, K8 also plays an important role in viral lytic DNA replication. Although, both K-RTA and K8 are found to be the ori-Lyt binding proteins and are required for lytic DNA replication, the detailed DNA-binding profile of these proteins in the KSHV and host genomes remains uncharacterized. In this study, using chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) assay, we performed a comprehensive analysis of K-RTA and K8 binding sites in the KSHV and human genomes in order to identify specific DNA binding sequences/motifs. We identified two novel K-RTA binding motifs, (i.e. AGAGAGAGGA/motif RB and AGAAAAATTC/motif RV) and one K8 binding motif (i.e. AAAATGAAAA/motif KB), respectively. The binding of K-RTA/K8 proteins with these motifs and resulting transcriptional modulation of downstream genes was further confirmed by DNA electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay (EMSA), reporter promoter assay, Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay and mRNA quantitation assay. Our data conclusively shows that K-RTA/K8 proteins specifically bind to these motifs on the host/viral genomes to modulate transcription of host/viral genes during KSHV lytic reactivation."
https://openalex.org/W2938232654,"Infectious disease nucleic acid amplification technologies (NAAT) have superior sensitivity, specificity, and rapid time to result compared to traditional microbiological methods. Recovery of concentrated, high quality pathogen nucleic acid (NA) from complex specimen matrices is required for optimal performance of several NA amplification/detection technologies such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Fully integrated NAAT platforms that enable rapid sample-to-result workflows with minimal user input are generally restricted to larger reference lab settings, and their complexity and cost are prohibitive to widespread implementation in resource limited settings (RLS). Identification of component technologies for incorporation of reliable and affordable sample preparation with pathogen NA amplification/detection into an integrated platform suitable for RLS, is a necessary first step toward achieving the overarching goal of reducing infectious disease-associated morbidity and mortality globally. In the current study, we evaluate the performance of six novel NA extraction technologies from different developers using blinded panels of stool, sputum and blood spiked with variable amounts of quality-controlled DNA- and/or RNA-based microbes. The extraction efficiencies were semi-quantitatively assessed using validated real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays specific for each microbe and comparing target-specific RT-PCR results to those obtained with reference NA extraction methods. The technologies were ranked based on overall diagnostic accuracy (analytical sensitivity and specificity). Sample input and output volumes, total processing time, user-required manual steps and cost estimates were also examined for suitability in RLS. Together with the performance analysis, these metrics were used to select the more suitable candidate technologies for further optimization of integrated NA amplification and detection technologies for RLS."
https://openalex.org/W2938996079,"The regulation of transcription initiation is critical for developmental and cellular processes. RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is recruited by the basal transcription machinery to the core promoter where Pol II initiates transcription. The core promoter encompasses the region from -40 to +40 bp relative to the +1 transcription start site (TSS). Core promoters may contain one or more core promoter motifs that confer specific properties to the core promoter, such as the TATA box, initiator (Inr) and motifs that are located downstream of the TSS, namely, motif 10 element (MTE), the downstream core promoter element (DPE) and the Bridge, a bipartite core promoter element. We had previously shown that Caudal, an enhancer-binding homeodomain transcription factor and a key regulator of the Hox gene network, is a DPE-specific activator. Interestingly, pair-rule proteins have been implicated in enhancer-promoter communication at the engrailed locus. Fushi tarazu (Ftz) is an enhancer-binding homeodomain transcription factor encoded by the ftz pair-rule gene. Ftz works in concert with its co-factor, Ftz-F1, to activate transcription. Here, we examined whether Ftz and Ftz-F1 activate transcription with a preference for a specific core promoter motif. Our analysis revealed that similarly to Caudal, Ftz and Ftz-F1 activate the promoter containing a TATA box mutation to significantly higher levels than the promoter containing a DPE mutation, thus demonstrating a preference for the DPE motif. We further discovered that Ftz target genes are enriched for a combination of functional downstream core promoter elements that are conserved among Drosophila species. Thus, the unique combination (Inr, Bridge and DPE) of functional downstream core promoter elements within Ftz target genes highlights the complexity of transcriptional regulation via the core promoter in the transcription of different developmental gene regulatory networks."
https://openalex.org/W2938123877,"Childhood stunting is a public health concern in many low-and-middle income countries, as it is associated with both short-term and long-term negative effects on child cognitive development, physical health, and schooling outcomes. There is paucity of studies on recovery from stunting among under five children in these countries. Most studies focused on the recovery much later in adolescence. We used longitudinal data from two Nairobi urban settlements to determine the incidence of recovery from stunting and understand the factors associated with post-stunting linear growth among under-five children. A total of 1,816 children were recruited between birth and 23 months and were followed-up until they reached five years. We first looked at the time to recover from stunting using event history analysis and Cox regression. Second, we used height-for-age z-score slope modelling to estimate the change in linear growth among children who were stunted. Finally, we fitted a linear regression model of the variation in HAZ on a second degree fractional polynomials in child’s age to identify the factors associated with post-stunting linear growth. The principal findings are: i) the incidence of recovery from stunting was 45% among stunted under-five children in the two settlements; ii) timely child immunization, age at stunting, mother’s parity and household socioeconomic status are important factors associated with time to recover from stunting within the first five years of life; and iii) child illness status and age at first stunting, mother’s parity and age have a strong influence on child post-stunting linear growth. Access to child health services and increased awareness among health professionals and child caregivers, would be critical in improving child growth outcomes in the study settings. Additionally, specific maternal and reproductive health interventions targeting young mothers in the slums may be needed to reduce adolescent and young mother’s vulnerability and improve their child health outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2939529996,"Exploitation and changing ocean conditions have resulted in altered species interactions and varied population dynamics within marine fish communities off northeast Newfoundland and southern Labrador, Canada. To understand contemporary species interactions, we quantified the isotopic niches, niche overlap, and ontogenetic niche change among seven dominant fish species using stable isotope analyses. Analyses used fishes from three regions differing in fish and prey diversities. Differences in fish and diet composition diversity among regions were found using Simpson’s inverse diversity index. The regions of lowest diversities had higher instances of niche overlap and higher percentage of niche overlap area. The region of highest diversity had the widest spread of niches with greater distances from the community centroid. Ontogenetic shifts were observed such that larger individuals shifted towards the community centroid with the exception of Atlantic cod. Atlantic cod in particular was found to consistently be the top predator of the analyzed species. Our results reveal: (a) overlap in isotopic niches and spread within niche space was correlated with fish and diet diversity; (b) ontogenetic shifts are important when considering a species’ niche and quantifying spatial variation in community niche profiles."

The indirect effect was calculated using 10.000 bootstrap samples for the bootstrap confidence intervals corrected for bias. Empathy improvement is mediated by changes in the cognitions derived from mindfulness (B = .346, p<.01). The direct effect of mindfulness practice on empathy disappears in presence of this mediator (B = .133, p>.05). Mindfulness interventions that aim to improve empathy should focus on three of its components; observing, describing and nonreactivity to inner experience. Given the significance of the results, the research must be extended to larger samples."

Refraction was performed on children with uncorrected visual acuity (VA) < = 6/12 in either eye, and acceptance of free glasses assessed.Baseline myopia (uncorrected visual acuity < = 6/12 in > = 1 eye and spherical equivalent refractive power < = -0.5D in both eyes); baseline glasses wear; free glasses acceptance.Among 10,037 children (mean age 10.6 years, 52.3% boys), 800 (8.0%) were myopic, 4.04% among Yunnan Minority children (OR 0.47, 95%CI 0.33, 0.67, P<0.001), 6.48% in Yunnan Han (OR 0.65, 95%CI 0.45, 0.93, P = 0.019), 9.87% in Guangdong Han (Reference). Differences remained significant after adjusting for study time and parental glasses wear. Difference in baseline glasses ownership (Yunnan Minority 4.95%, Yunnan Han 6.15%, Guangdong Han 15.3%) was not significant after adjustment for VA. Yunnan minority children (71.0%) were more likely than Yunnan Han (59.6%) or Guangdong Han (36.8%) to accept free glasses. The difference was significant after adjustment only compared to Guangdong Han (OR 3.34, 95% CI 1.62, 6.90, P = 0.001).Myopia is more common among Han children and in wealthier Guangdong. Baseline differences in glasses wear could be explained by student, teacher and parental factors. Yunnan Minority children were more likely to accept free glasses."
https://openalex.org/W2939947027,"In complex adaptive systems approaches to perceptual-motor control the mapping between the different categories of task dynamics: namely, task outcome, collective variable, neuromuscular synergies and individual joint configurations is a central theoretical issue, that has been primarily studied in bimanual tasks. Here we report an investigation in the roller ball task of how the task goal and multiple degrees of freedom of the arm-hand complex affords degeneracy between the respective properties of the task dynamics. The relation of the candidate collective variable, namely, the synchrony of the inner ball to outer shell motion of the roller ball and its relation to the task goal (continued increasing in ball speed), was examined as a function of the initial ball speed acting as a control parameter. Within trial analysis revealed initial search behavior for synchrony of ball and shell motion that was longer in duration with initial lower ball speed conditions. In contrast, higher initial ball speed conditions reduced the search time for and enhanced the rate of stabilization of the synchrony of inner ball and outer shell motion–features that facilitated the continued increase of ball speed and the probability of task success. Participants adopted one of three wrist-elbow neuromuscular synergies to manipulate the roller ball, the distribution of which was not influenced by either initial ball speed or task outcome. The pattern of findings over the different properties of task analysis of the roller ball provides evidence for the distinct but complementary dynamics of searching to form, stabilize and exploit a collective variable that satisfies the task goal through a small redundant set of arm-hand synergy motions."
https://openalex.org/W2936948134,"Understanding the adaptation mechanisms of sorghum to drought and the underlying genetic architecture may help to improve its production in a wide range of environments. By crossing a high yielding parent (HYP) and a drought tolerant parent (DTP), we obtained 140 recombinant inbred lines (RILs), which were genotyped with 120 DArT and SSR markers covering 14 linkage groups (LGs). A subset of 100 RILs was evaluated three times in control and drought treatments to genetically dissect their response to water availability. Plants with early heading date (HD) in the drought treatment maintained yield (YLD) level by reducing seed number SN and increasing hundred seed weight (HSW). In contrast, early HD in the control treatment increased SN, HSW and YLD. In total, 133 significant QTL associated with the measured traits were detected in ten hotspot regions. Antagonistic, pleiotropic effects of a QTL cluster mapped on LG-6 may explain the observed trade-offs between SN and HSW: Alleles from DTP reduced SN and the alleles from HYP increased HSW under drought stress, but not in the control treatment. Our results illustrate the importance of considering genetic and environmental factors in QTL mapping to better understand plant responses to drought and to improve breeding programs."

Given its increased salt and drought stress tolerance, C. procera stands out as a powerful candidate to provide alternative genetic resources for biotechnological approaches. The qPCR (real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction), widely recognized among the most accurate methods for quantifying gene expression, demands suitable reference genes (RGs) to avoid over- or underestimations of the relative expression and incorrect interpretation. This study aimed at evaluating the stability of ten RGs for normalization of gene expression of root and leaf of C. procera under different salt stress conditions and different collection times. The selected RGs were used on expression analysis of three target genes. Three independent experiments were carried out in greenhouse with young plants: i) Leaf100 = leaf samples collected 30 min, 2 h, 8 h and 45 days after NaCl-stress (100 mM NaCl); ii) Root50 and iii) Root200 = root samples collected 30 min, 2 h, 8 h and 1day after NaCl-stress (50 and 200 mM NaCl, respectively). Stability rank among the three algorithms used showed high agreement for the four most stable RGs. The four most stable RGs showed high congruence among all combination of collection time, for each software studied, with minor disagreements. CYP23 was the best RG (rank of top four) for all experimental conditions (Leaf100, Root50, and Root200). Using appropriated RGs, we validated the relative expression level of three differentially expressed target genes (NAC78, CNBL4, and ND1) in Leaf100 and Root200 samples. This study provides the first selection of stable reference genes for C. procera under salinity. Our results emphasize the need for caution when evaluating the stability RGs under different amplitude of variable factors."
https://openalex.org/W2938059403,"Most chemotherapy regimens cause neutropenic nadirs between days 10 and 14, and administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support relies on this timing. In docetaxel (DOC)-based chemotherapy, the frequency of febrile neutropenia (FN) and the G-CSF dose administered varied greatly between studies. Our study goal was to forecast the necessary dose of G-CSF by comparing day 8 neutropenia with putative changes within the neutrophil pool. We conducted a retrospective observational analysis of 242 early breast cancer patients who had received adjuvant DOC-based chemotherapy (DOC group) compared with 43 patients who had received FEC chemotherapy (FEC group). Patients who were given a standard dose and had a blood test on day 8 in the 1st cycle were eligible. In the DOC group, patients routinely received prophylactic administration of G-CSF (150 μg/body) on day 3 and received additional G-CSF based on a blood test on day 8. Results of the day 8 blood test showed that severe neutropenia (<500/mm3, average 494/mm3) was observed in 152 out of 242 (62.8%) patients in the DOC group, while in the FEC group (n = 43), neutropenia was ambiguous (average 1,741/mm3). In the FEC group, 9 out of 43 patients (20.9%) and in the DOC group, 27 out of 242 patients (11.1%) experienced FN. In the DOC group, day 8 neutropenia was predictive for FN in a logistic regression model (OR 0.79 [95% CI: 0.655–0.952], p = 0.013). Among 214 patients under 70 years old, the planned chemotherapy cycle was completed in 190 (88.8%) patients who also received the maximum dose of G-CSF (150 μg/body) four times, while 23 patients could not complete the planned chemotherapy cycle, but only five because of FN-related complications. Patients treated with DOC should be treated for primary prophylaxis with G-CSF support at an earlier time starting with a relatively small dose."

We have constructed an accurate model of IPF disease status using elastic net regularized regression on clinical gene expression data. Leveraging whole transcriptome microarray data from 230 IPF and 89 control samples from Yang et al. (2013), sourced from the Lung Tissue Research Consortium (LTRC) and National Jewish Health (NJH) cohorts, we identify an IPF gene expression signature. We performed optimal feature selection to reduce the number of transcripts required by our model to a parsimonious set of 15. This signature enables our model to accurately separate IPF patients from controls. Our model outperforms existing published models when tested with multiple independent clinical cohorts. Our study underscores the utility of elastic nets for gene signature/panel selection which can be used for the construction of a multianalyte biomarker of disease. We also filter the gene sets used for model input to construct a model reliant on secreted proteins. Using this approach, we identify the preclinical bleomycin rat model that is most congruent with human disease at day 21 post-bleomycin administration, contrasting with earlier timepoints suggested by other studies."
https://openalex.org/W2938930999,"Resynthesized (RS) Brassica napus can be used to increase the genetic diversity of this important crop plant and to develop the heterotic gene pool required for successful hybrid breeding programmes. The level of heterosis in F1 hybrids depends on the individual performance of the parents and on the degree of genetic difference between them. However, RS forms obtained from crosses of B. rapa ssp. with B. oleracea ssp. possess many undesirable agronomic traits, such as low quality of seeds, low yield and seed oil content, high erucic acid level in the oil and high glucosinolate content in seed meal. Therefore, RS oilseed rape needs to be improved by crossing with natural double-low oilseed rape, leading to selected double-low quality semi-RS lines that can be used for breeding. In this study, we evaluated the seed yield potential of F1 hybrids derived from crosses between Ogura cytoplasmic male-sterility (CMS) lines and doubled haploid (DH) semi-RS lines with restorer gene in three locations in Poland. The genotype by environment interaction (GE interaction) and general combining ability (GCA) of the restorer and CMS line effects, as well as the effects of heterosis, were also assessed. The results of the study provide the first insights into the use of semi-RS lines as components for the development of new hybrid cultivars. Even the introduction of 50% of the RS oilseed rape genotype to natural restorer lines resulted in a marked heterosis effect, with seed yield ranging from 4.56% to 90.17% more than that of the better parent. The yield of the best hybrid amounted to 108.6% of the seed yield of the open-pollinated cultivar Monolit and 94.4% of that of the hybrid cultivar Arsenal. The best DH semi-RS line S1, which had a significantly positive GCA for seed yield, can be recommended as a possible parent for inclusion in breeding programmes aimed at developing new hybrid cultivars."

https://openalex.org/W2936014793,"Myostatin (MSTN) negatively regulates skeletal muscle growth, and its activity is inhibited by the binding of MSTN propeptide (MSTNpro), the N-terminal domain of proMSTN that is proteolytically cleaved from the proMSTN. Partial sequences from the N-terminal side of MSTNpro have shown to be sufficient to inhibit MSTN activity. In this study, to determine the minimum size of flatfish MSTNpro for MSTN inhibition, various truncated forms of flatfish MSTNpro with N-terminal maltose binding protein (MBP) fusion were expressed in E. coli and purified. MSTNpro regions consisting of residues 45-68, -69, and -70 with MBP fusion suppressed MSTN activity with a potency comparable to that of full-sequence flatfish MSTNpro in a pGL3-(CAGA)12-luciferase reporter assay. Even though the MSTN-inhibitory potency was about 1,000-fold lower, the flatfish MSTNpro region containing residues 45-65 (MBP-Pro45-65) showed MSTN-inhibitory capacity but not the MBP-Pro45-64, indicating that the region 45-65 is the minimum domain required for MSTN binding and suppression of its activity. To examine the in vivo effect of MBP-fused, truncated flatfish MSTNpro, MBP-Pro45-70-His6 (20 mg/kg body wt) was subcutaneously injected 5 times for 14 days in mice. Body wt gain and bone mass were not affected by the administration. Grip strength and swimming time were significantly enhanced at 7 d after the administration. At 14 d, the effect on grip strength disappeared, and the extent of the effect on swimming time significantly diminished. The presence of antibody against MBP-Pro45-70-His6 was observed at both 7 and 14 d after the administration with the titer value at 14 d being much greater than that at 7 d, suggesting that antibodies against MBP-Pro45-70-His6 neutralized the MSTN-inhibitory effect of MBP-Pro45-70-His6. We, thus, examined the MSTN-inhibitory capacity and in vivo effect of flatfish MSTNpro region 45-65 peptide (Pep45-65-NH2), which was predicted to have no immunogenicity in silico analysis. Pep45-65-NH2 suppressed MSTN activity with a potency similar to that of MBP-Pro45-65 but did not suppress GDF11, or activin A. Pep45-65-NH2 blocked MSTN-induced Smad2 phosphorylation in HepG2 cells. The administration of Pep45-65 (20 mg/kg body wt, 5 times for 2 weeks) increased the body wt gain with a greater gain at 14 d than at 7 d and muscle wt. Grip strength and swimming time were also significantly enhanced by the administration. Antibody titer against Pep45-65 was not detected. In conclusion, current results indicate that MSTN-inhibitory proteins with heterologous fusion partner may not be effective in suppressing MSTN activity in vivo due to an immune response against the proteins. Current results also show that the region of flatfish MSTNpro consisting of 45-65 (Pep45-65) can suppress mouse MSTN activity and increase muscle mass and function without invoking an immune response, implying that Pep45-65 would be a potential agent to enhance skeletal muscle growth and function in animals or to treat muscle atrophy caused by various clinical conditions."

Data from the Finger Lakes Perinatal Data System database on 316,956 deliveries occurring between 2004–2014 and pregnancy outcomes were analyzed to assess the association of periodontal (gum) disease with depression, other maternal factors and adverse birth outcomes. Adjusted effects of periodontal disease and depression on adverse birth outcomes were estimated using multiple logistic regression models and path analysis. Having preterm delivery was associated significantly with depression (OR = 1.177; 95% CI: [1.146, 1.208]), having adequate health care (OR = 1.638; 95% CI: [1.589, 1.689]), smoking during pregnancy (OR = 1.259; 95% CI: [1.220, 1.300]), and being less educated (OR = 1.214; 95% CI: [1.174, 1.256]). Having low birth weight was significantly associated with depression (OR = 1.206; 95% CI: [1.170, 1.208]), smoking during pregnancy (OR = 1.855; 95% CI: [1.793, 1.919]), and being less educated (OR = 1.322; 95% CI: [1.275, 1.370]). Periodontal disease was significantly associated with alcohol use during pregnancy (OR = 1.314; 95% CI: [1.227, 1.407]) and white race (OR = 1.192; 95% CI: [1.167, 1.217]). Depression was significantly associated with periodontal disease (OR = 1.762; 95% CI: [1.727, 1.797]) and alcohol use during pregnancy (OR = 1.470; 95% CI: [1.377, 1.570]). We concluded that a positive association existed between depression during pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes, and that depression served as a mediator in the association of periodontal disease with adverse birth outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2936626386,"Background Adipose tissue-derived adipokines are pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in metabolic-related diseases and can be influenced by diet and exercise. We aimed to compare the effect of a Mediterranean (MdM) compared with Fast Food (FFM) meal on the exercise induced adipokines changes. Methods In a double blinded cross over trial, 46 participants were randomly assigned to one of two standardized iso-energy pre-exercise meals: FFM or MdM-type. Three hours after each meal, participants completed a treadmill exercise test (EC). Serum adiponectin, resistin, PAI-1, lipocalin-2/NGAL and adipsin were determined by Luminex magnetic bead immunoassay. Wilcoxon signed rank test compared changes before/after meal and before/after EC and a linear mixed model evaluated the effect of meals on the adipokine response to exercise, adjusted for confounders. Results Thirty-nine participants (mean age of 25, with a standard deviation of 5 years) completed the trial (56% females). For both interventions, a significant reduction of adipsin after each meal and a significant increase of lipocalin, PAI-1, adipsin and resistin, after exercise was observed. When exercise was preceded by a MdM meal a higher increase in adipsin levels was seen. Conclusion Acute exercise induced an increase of circulatory levels of adipsin, resistin, lipocalin and PAI-1, but not adiponectin. A pre-exercise Mediterranean meal potentiated the increase of adipsin after the exercise test, which possibly relates to the immune regulatory role of adipsin. These changes suggest a cross-talk between the immune and metabolic immediate response to exercise and its modulation by the pre-exercise diet composition."
https://openalex.org/W2938713598,"Introduction From the perspective of dynamic systems theory, stability and variability of biological signals are both understood as a functional adaptation to variable environmental conditions. In the present study, we examined whether this theoretical perspective is applicable to the pedalling movement in cycling. Non-linear measures were applied to analyse pedalling forces with varying levels of subjective load. Materials and methods Ten subjects completed a 13-sector virtual terrain profile of 15 km total length on a roller trainer with varying degrees of virtual terrain inclination (resistance). The test was repeated two times with different instructions on how to alter the bikes gearing. During the experiment, pedalling force and heart rate were measured. Force-time curves were sequenced into single cycles, linearly interpolated in the time domain, and z-score normalised. The established time series was transferred into a two-dimensional phase space with limit cycle properties given the applied 25% phase shift. Different representations of the phase space attractor were calculated within each sector and used as non-linear measures assessing pedalling forces. Results and discussion A contrast analysis showed that changes in pedalling load were strongly associated to changes in non-linear phase space attractor variables. For the subjects investigated in this study, this association was stronger than that between heart rate and resistance level. The results indicate systematic changes of the pedalling movement as an adaptive response to an externally determined increase in workload. Future research may utilise the findings from this study to investigate possible relationships between subjective measures of exhaustion, comfort, and discomfort with biomechanic characteristics of the pedalling movement and to evaluate connections with dynamic stability measures."
https://openalex.org/W2936201996,"The aim of this study was to validate energy intake (EI) reported by a pre-coded food diary (PFD) against energy expenditure (EE) measured by the ActiReg system consisting of an activity and position monitor and a calculation program (ActiCalc). Dietary intake was recorded by the PFD and EE was measured by the ActiReg system over a 7-day period. One hundred and twenty adult participants completed the study, 42 men and 78 women. The average group EI was 17% lower compared to measured EE. The 95% limits of agreement were 6.7 and -2.9 MJ/day. Of all participants, 68% were classified as acceptable reporters, 29% as underreporters and only 3% as overreporters. Fifty percent of the men and 30% of the women were classified into the same quartile for EI and EE, whereas 5% of both men and women were ranked in the opposite quartile by the two methods (weighted kappa coefficient = 0.29). Pearson correlation coefficient between reported EI and measured EE was 0.49 (p<0.001). High BMI was related to larger underreporting when EE was low. Furthermore, this study found that PFD underestimates EI on the group level with an average of 17% and showed large variation in the validity of the PFD on the individual level."
https://openalex.org/W2936896606,"Low socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and infertility. Low-dose aspirin (LDA) was shown to improve livebirth rates in certain subsets of women, and therefore, may impact pregnancy rates differentially by SES status. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to examine whether daily preconception-initiated LDA affects rates of pregnancy, livebirth, and pregnancy loss differently across strata of socioeconomic status (SES). This is a secondary analysis of The Effects of Aspirin in Gestation and Reproduction (EAGeR) Trial, a multisite, block- randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted at four U.S. medical centers (n = 1,228, 2007-2012). Women attempting spontaneous conception with a history of pregnancy loss were randomly allocated preconception to 81mg of aspirin + 400mcg of folic acid (n = 615) or placebo + 400mcg of folic acid (n = 613). Study medication was administered for six menstrual cycles or until 36 weeks' gestation if pregnancy was achieved. For this analysis, women were stratified by SES, which included income (low, mid, high) and a combined grouping of education and income (low-low, low-high, high-low, high-high). Log binomial models with robust variance estimated risks of pregnancy, livebirth, and pregnancy loss for LDA versus placebo. LDA increased pregnancy and livebirth rates (RR 1.23, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.45) in the high-income, but not mid- or low-income groups. LDA increased pregnancy rates in both the low education-low income group (RR 1.22, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.46) and the high education-high income group (RR 1.23, 95%CI: 1.06, 1.42), with no effect observed in mid-SES groupings. LDA, a low-cost and widely available treatment, may be particularly beneficial to women at the highest and lowest ends of the socioeconomic spectrum, though underlying mechanisms of this disparity are unclear. Confirming these findings and identifying factors which may modulate the effectiveness of LDA will ultimately facilitate personalized clinical care and improvements in population-level reproductive health.

https://openalex.org/W2938464340,"Phosphoenolpyruvate-carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS) is a highly conserved, multistep chemical process which uses phosphate transfer to regulate the intake and use of sugars and other carbohydrates by bacteria. In addition to controlling sugar uptake, the PTS regulates several bacterial cellular functions such as chemotaxis, glycogen metabolism, catabolite repression and biofilm formation. Previous studies have shown that the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate ratio is a critical determinant of PTS functions. This study shows that 2-oxo-4-phenyl-2,5-dihydro-3-furancarbonitrile (MW01), a compound with structural similarity to known natural products, induces Vibrio cholerae to grow preferentially in the biofilm mode in a mechanism that involves interaction with pyruvate. Spectrophotometric assays were used to monitor bacterial growth kinetics in microtiter plates and quantitatively evaluate biofilm formation in borosilicate glass tubes. Evidence of MW01 and pyruvate interactions was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Given the established connection between PTS activity and biofilm formation, this study also highlights the potential impact that small-molecule modulators of the PTS may have in the development of innovative approaches to manage desired and undesired microbial cultures in clinical, industrial and environmental settings."
