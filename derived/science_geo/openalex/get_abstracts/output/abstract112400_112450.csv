https://openalex.org/W2028343350,"A hemispheric asymmetry in the functional activation of the human motor cortex during contralateral (C) and ipsilateral (I) finger movements, especially in right-handed subjects, was documented with nuclear magnetic resonance imaging at high field strength (4 tesla). Whereas the right motor cortex was activated mostly during contralateral finger movements in both right-handed (C/I mean area of activation = 36.8) and left-handed (C/I = 29.9) subjects, the left motor cortex was activated substantially during ipsilateral movements in left-handed subjects (C/I = 5.4) and even more so in right-handed subjects (C/I = 1.3)."
https://openalex.org/W2060686995,"A method was developed to clone, without the use of specific functional assays, complementary DNAs (cDNAs) that carry specific amino-terminal signal sequences, such as those encoding intercellular signal-transducing molecules and receptors. The vector used in this system directed the cell surface expression of interleukin-2 receptor fusion proteins when inserts with signal sequences were cloned in-frame with the correct orientation. An expression cDNA library was constructed from a bone marrow stromal cell line, which contained 5' portion-enriched cDNAs (the average size was 400 base pairs). Two cDNAs that encoded putative cytokine molecules, stromal cell-derived factor-1 alpha (SDF-1 alpha) and SDF-1 beta, which belong to the intercrine-macrophage inflammatory protein superfamily, were cloned."
https://openalex.org/W2091872511,"Detection of receptor-ligand interactions is generally accomplished by indirect assays such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A direct colorimetric detection method based on a polydiacetylene bilayer assembled on glass microscope slides has been developed. The bilayer is composed of a self-assembled monolayer of octadecylsilane and a Langmuir-Blodgett monolayer of polydiacetylene. The polydiacetylene layer is functionalized with an analog of sialic acid, the receptor-specific ligand for the influenza virus hemagglutinin. The sialic acid ligand serves as a molecular recognition element and the conjugated polymer backbone signals binding at the surface by a chromatic transition. The color transition is readily visible to the naked eye as a blue to red color change and can be quantified by visible absorption spectroscopy. Direct colorimetric detection by polydiacetylene films offers new possibilities for diagnostic applications and screening for new drug candidates or binding ligands."
https://openalex.org/W1550073817,"Studies reported previously from this laboratory have shown that microsomal membranes of the vertebrate retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) contain an RPE-specific 65-kDa protein, RPE65, which bears the determinant recognized by the strictly tissue-specific monoclonal antibody RPE9, and which is developmentally regulated (Hamel, C. P., Tsilou, E., Harris, E., Pfeffer, B. A., Hooks, J. J., Detrick, B., and Redmond, T. M. (1993) J. Neurosci. Res. 34, 414-425). Microsequencing of 17 tryptic and chymotryptic peptides obtained from the in situ digestion of the RPE65 blotted on nitrocellulose yielded primary sequences that were used to generate oligonucleotide probes. An 84-nucleotide guessmer was used to isolate two clones from a bovine RPE lambda Zap II cDNA library. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends was used to complete the 5' and 3' ends, resulting in a 3,115-base pair composite cDNA. The open reading frame encodes a novel protein of 533 amino acid residues with a computed molecular weight of 60,940. This protein does not match any other sequence in the data bases. The 231 amino acids obtained from peptide sequencing match 43% of the amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA. The protein has a calculated pI of 6.41 and is not predicted to have any transmembrane segments. The open reading frame expressed in Escherichia coli has an apparent molecular weight identical to that of the native protein and is recognized by the monoclonal antibody RPE9, further corroborating its validity. Northern blot analysis detected a major mRNA species of 3.15 kilobases for RPE65, as well as shorter species, only in RPE and not in other tissues (including other ocular tissues). Cultured RPE cells (7 weeks in primary culture) contained RPE65 mRNA in amounts equivalent to fresh RPE. Such cells, however, contained no immunodetectable RPE65. The possible structure of this RPE-specific protein and hypotheses for the absence of translation in vitro are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2035584408,"The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor interacts with plasma membrane-associated adapter proteins during endocytosis through coated pits. Almost 50 percent of the total pool of α-adaptins was coimmunoprecipitated with the EGF receptor when A-431 cells were treated with EGF at 37°C, but not at 4°C. Partial proteolysis of α-adaptin suggested that the amino-terminal domain is the region that associates with the EGF receptor. The extent of receptor-adaptin association was increased in cells depleted of potassium to block endocytosis. These data suggest that receptor-adaptin association occurs in intact cells before coated pits are fully assembled."
https://openalex.org/W1565477787,"Agonist-induced platelet activation causes fibrinogen binding to integrin alpha IIb beta 3 (glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa) and platelet aggregation. This is associated with the phosphorylation of specific platelet proteins on tyrosine residues. Since fibrinogen immobilized on a solid matrix can bind platelet GP IIb-IIIa without the need for exogenous agonists, we examined whether platelet adhesion to a fibrinogen matrix induces tyrosine phosphorylation. Platelets adhered to fibrinogen in a GP IIb-IIIa-dependent manner and assumed a spread morphology. This change in cell shape was associated with tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins, most prominently two unidentified proteins (101 and 105 kDa) and pp125FAK, a focal adhesion protein-tyrosine kinase. Pretreatment of platelets with prostaglandin I2 to increase cAMP, with cytochalasin D to inhibit actin polymerization, or with ADP scavengers to remove ADP did not affect initial adhesion, but inhibited both platelet spreading and tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125FAK and the 101- and 105-kDa proteins. This suggested that adhesion to fibrinogen caused cytoskeletal reorganization and the local release of ADP from platelet-dense granules, which potentiated the biochemical and morphological responses of the platelets to fibrinogen. Platelet adhesion to a collagen matrix also led to the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of the 101- and 105-kDa proteins and pp125FAK. In this case, tyrosine phosphorylation was dependent on the interaction of collagen with integrin alpha 2 beta 1 (GP Ia-IIa), and it was independent of both GP IIb-IIIa and ADP. These results indicate that platelet adhesion to fibrinogen or collagen induces signal transduction that is initiated through integrins GP IIb-IIIa and alpha 2 beta 1, respectively. In both cases, tyrosine phosphorylation is accompanied by cytoskeletal reorganization and changes in cell shape. However, different regulatory components may be interposed between each of these integrins and the enzymes that control the level of protein tyrosine phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1605349427,"Mammalian DNA polymerase beta (beta-pol) is considered to be part of the DNA repair machinery. However, there have been conceptual problems with this idea because beta-pol does not completely fill some gapped substrates, and unlike other DNA polymerases, beta-pol adds just one dNMP for each cycle of binding to the DNA substrate, incorporation, and product release (distributive synthesis). To examine the questions of complete gap filling and gap recognition by beta-pol, we designed template-primer substrates with a range of gap sizes from 1 to 53 template residues between the 3'-OH primer and a downstream polynucleotide. M13mp18(+) single-stranded DNA was used as template, and synthetic deoxyoligonucleotides were used as primers and downstream polynucleotides. We find that beta-pol can completely fill gaps and that the gap-filling activity on substrates with gaps of up to 6 nucleotides is highly processive rather than distributive; processive synthesis to fill a gap strictly required 5'-phosphate on the 5'-moiety of the gap. Similar specificity for filling short gaps was not observed with other DNA polymerases. These results on substrate specificity and the mechanism of beta-pol suggest distinct requirements for the role of beta-pol in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1512176361,"The human erythroleukemia (K562) cell line undergoes megakaryocytic differentiation and cessation of proliferation when treated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). To investigate the role of individual protein kinase C (PKC) isotypes in these events, we have assessed PKC isotype expression during leukemic proliferation and PMA-induced differentiation. Immunoblot analysis using isotype-specific antibodies demonstrates that proliferating K562 cells express the alpha, beta II, and zeta PKC isotypes. PMA-induced differentiation and cytostasis lead to a decrease in beta II PKC and increases in alpha and zeta PKC levels. The role of the alpha and beta II PKC isotypes was further assessed in cells overexpressing these isotypes. K562 cells overexpressing human alpha PKC grew more slowly and were more sensitive to the cytostatic effects of PMA than control cells, whereas cells overexpressing beta II PKC were less sensitive to PMA. PMA-induced cytostasis is reversed upon removal of PMA. Resumption of proliferation is accompanied by reexpression of beta II PKC to near control levels, whereas alpha and zeta PKC levels remain elevated for several days after removal of PMA. Proliferation of PMA-withdrawn cells can be partially inhibited by antisense beta II PKC oligodeoxyribonucleotide. Growth inhibition is dose-dependent, specific for beta II PKC-directed antisense oligonucleotide, and associated with significant inhibition of beta II PKC levels indicating that beta II PKC is essential for K562 cell proliferation. Sodium butyrate, which unlike PMA induces megakaryocytic differentiation without cytostasis, causes increases in both alpha and beta II PKC levels. These data demonstrate that beta II PKC is required for K562 cell proliferation, whereas alpha PKC is involved in megakaryocytic differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1563596243,"Platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1, CD31) is a 130-kDa integral membrane glycoprotein expressed on endothelial cells, platelets, and leukocytes. Experiments analyzing the aggregation of mouse L-cells stably transfected with full-length PECAM-1 cDNA have demonstrated that PECAM-1 is capable of mediating calcium-dependent heterophilic aggregation. In this report the ligand interactions involved in the aggregation process were studied. This aggregation was inhibited by heparin and chondroitin sulfate, but not by other glycosaminoglycans. Enzymatic removal of cell surface glycosaminoglycans confirmed a PECAM-1-glycosaminoglycan interaction and suggested that this interaction involved glycosaminoglycans on adjacent cells. PECAM-1 contains a glycosaminoglycan consensus binding sequence in the second immunoglobulin-like domain of the molecule's extracellular domain. A comparable region in the related adhesion protein N-CAM has been shown to mediate the adhesive properties of N-CAM. Cells expressing mutant PECAM-1 protein missing the second domain failed to aggregate. Synthetic peptides mimicking the consensus glycosaminoglycan binding sequence, L-K-R-E-K-N, inhibited aggregation. These results demonstrate that PECAM-1-mediated aggregation is dependent on the binding of PECAM-1 to specific glycosaminoglycans on adjacent cells via a glycosaminoglycan consensus binding sequence in the second immunoglobulin-like homology domain."
https://openalex.org/W2033957457,"Structure-specific recognition proteins (SSRPs) bind to DNA containing intrastrand cross-links formed by the anticancer drug cisplatin. A yeast gene encoding an SSRP, designated IXR1, was cloned and sequenced. The Ixr1 protein, a member of the high mobility group-box protein family, bound specifically to DNA modified with cisplatin but not inactive platinum compounds. A yeast strain with an inactivated IXR1 gene was half as sensitive to cisplatin and accumulated one-third as many platinum-DNA lesions after treatment with cisplatin as the parental strain. These findings suggest that SSRPs play a role in mediating the cytotoxicity of cisplatin."
https://openalex.org/W1659662945,"The carboxyl terminus of apolipoprotein (apo) E is required for lipoprotein association and for tetramer formation. To correlate these roles with specific regions within the carboxyl terminus, a series of apoE3 variants with carboxyl-terminal truncations at residues 266, 244, 223, and 191 were expressed in Escherichia coli. As determined by gel permeation and sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation, the four truncated variants were monomeric in solution. Compared to native apoE3 (299 residues), all had reduced affinity for lipoproteins, as assessed by incubation of 125I-labeled proteins with plasma followed by fractionation of lipoprotein classes by gel filtration. The 266-residue variant associated with very low density lipoproteins and high density lipoproteins, but was partly non-lipoprotein-bound (25% of total). Shorter variants, with 244 or fewer residues, did not associate with very low density lipoproteins and only associated slightly (approximately 20%) with high density lipoproteins, with the major portion non-lipoprotein-bound (65-73%). After these proteins were injected into rabbits, the clearance rate was proportional to the plasma level of non-lipoprotein-bound protein. These results indicate lipoprotein association modulates the clearance of apoE, residues within the segment 267-299 are critical for apoE tetramerization and facilitate lipoprotein association, and residues within the segment 245-266 also contribute to lipoprotein association."
https://openalex.org/W1510771719,"Previous studies have demonstrated that multichain immune recognition receptors, such as the T-cell receptor, signal their occupancy by inducing tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular protein substrates. Type I and II receptors for the Fc portion of IgG are single-chain immune recognition receptors having external, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains. In the present study, we have investigated the possibility that, upon engagement, Fc gamma receptors induce protein-tyrosine phosphorylation. Our findings reveal increased phosphorylation of a number of proteins on tyrosine residues after cross-linking of either high (Fc gamma RI) or low (Fc gamma RII) affinity receptors expressed on HL60 cells. Engagement of Fc gamma RII induced rapid tyrosine phosphorylation that decayed to basal levels by 40 min. In contrast, phosphorylation induced by Fc gamma RI cross-linking was more delayed, peaking at 5-10 min, and returning to basal levels by 60 min. Kinase assays of cellular proteins immunoprecipitated from lysates of activated cells by antibody to phosphotyrosine revealed phosphorylation of a 72-kDa molecule that was not present in lysates of resting cells. This phosphoprotein was identified as p72syk by immunoprecipitation with antibodies directed against two different regions of the syk gene product. Immunoprecipitation with antibodies against p72syk followed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies revealed an activation-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of p72syk. Thus, our present findings demonstrate induction of protein-tyrosine phosphorylation following engagement of monomeric immune recognition receptors and identify p72syk as a tyrosine kinase substrate involved in signaling by Fc gamma RI and Fc gamma RII."
https://openalex.org/W1558047925,"Nuclear extracts from maize leaves have been shown previously to contain a factor, MNF1, that interacts with both the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter and the promoter of the maize gene for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, which is involved in C4 photosynthesis. We have isolated two cDNA clones encoding proteins (MNB1a and MNB1b), that bind to an MNF1-binding site in a sequence-specific manner, by screening of a maize cDNA expression library with synthetic oligonucleotides. Using various mutated oligonucleotides, we showed that both proteins recognize an AAGG motif at the MNF1-binding site as important bases for binding, as does MNF1 in maize nuclear extracts. However, the binding specificities of MNB1a and MNB1b are similar but not identical to that of MNF1. The deduced amino acid sequences of these proteins are completely different from each other. The basic region of MNB1b exhibits homology to the high mobility group (HMG) box of the vertebrate HMG1 family, whereas MNB1a exhibits no homology to any known proteins. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA revealed that the cDNA for MNB1a is derived from a multigene family whose members have highly homologous N-terminal basic domain, whereas the gene for MNB1b exhibits only limited homology to a few other genes. These results suggest that the MNF1-binding site on the 35S promoter is a target of multiple DNA-binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1649701723,"The syndrome of thyroid hormone resistance (THR) is caused by multiple distinct mutations of the ligand-binding domain of the thyroid hormone beta receptor. Although the mutant receptors are transcriptionally inactive, they inhibit normal receptor function in a dominant negative manner to cause hormone resistance. Because most of the naturally occurring mutations are clustered within two areas that lie on either side of a putative dimerization region, we hypothesized that receptor dimerization was important for dominant negative inhibition. In gel mobility shift assays, two THR mutants (G345R and P453H) formed homodimers as well as heterodimers with the retinoic acid X receptor alpha. In contrast, an artificial mutation (L428R) in one of the hydrophobic heptad repeats of the putative receptor dimerization domain impaired heterodimerization with retoinoic acid X receptor alpha without altering the formation of homodimers. Double mutants containing either of the THR mutations along with the dimerization mutation formed homodimers but not heterodimers, reflecting the properties of the dimerization mutant alone. In transient expression assays using positively (TRETKLuc) or negatively (TSH alpha Luc) regulated reporter genes, the dominant negative activity of the THR mutants was eliminated by the addition of the dimerization mutation. These results support a mechanism for dominant negative activity by THR mutants in which functionally inactive heterodimers bind to DNA to inhibit access by normal receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1492683939,"We previously identified a gene, reg (i.e. regenerating gene), in the screening of a regenerating islet-derived cDNA library of rat (Terazono, K., Yamamoto, H., Takasawa, S., Shiga, K., Yonemura, Y., Tochino, Y., and Okamoto, H. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 2111-2114), and isolated a human reg cDNA and gene (Watanabe, T., Yonekura, H., Terazono, K., Yamamoto, H., and Okamoto, H. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 7432-7439); the rat and human cDNAs encode 165- and 166-amino acid proteins, respectively. Until now, it was thought that there is a single locus for Reg protein in the mammalian genome. In this study, we isolated two distinct cDNAs and genes, one of which was a mouse homologue to rat and human reg gene, the other a novel type of reg gene. We designated them reg I and reg II, respectively. The two proteins encoded by these genes share 76% amino acid sequence identity with each other. Both genes span about 3 kilobase pairs, and the genomic organization of six exons and five introns is conserved between them. Chromosomal mapping studies indicate that the reg I gene is localized on mouse chromosome 12, whereas the reg II gene is localized on chromosome 3. By Northern blot analysis, both reg I and reg II mRNAs are detected in the normal pancreas and hyperplastic islets of aurothioglucose-treated mice, but not in the normal islets. It is remarkable that in the gallbladder reg I is expressed, but reg II is not."
https://openalex.org/W1481137597,"On the basis of its primary sequence and the location of its disulfide bonds, we propose a structural model of the erythropoietic hormone erythropoietin (Epo) which predicts a four alpha-helical bundle motif, in common with other cytokines. In order to test this model, site-directed mutants were prepared by high level transient expression in Cos7 cells and analyzed by a radioimmuno assay and by bioassays utilizing mouse and human Epo-dependent cell lines. Deletions of 5 to 8 residues within predicted alpha-helices resulted in the failure of export of the mutant protein from the cell. In contrast, deletions at the NH2 terminus (delta 2-5), the COOH terminus (delta 163-166), or in predicted interhelical loops (AB: delta 32-36, delta 53-57; BC: delta 78-82; CD: delta 111-119) resulted in the export of immunologically detectable Epo muteins that were biologically active. The mutein delta 48-52 could be readily detected by radioimmunoassay but had markedly decreased biological activity. However, replacement of each of these deleted residues by serine resulted in Epo muteins with full biological activity. Replacement of Cys29 and Cys33 by tyrosine residues also resulted in the export of fully active Epo. Therefore, this small disulfide loop is not critical to Epo's stability or function. The properties of the muteins that we tested are consistent with our proposed model of tertiary structure."
https://openalex.org/W1486253077,"The c-raf-1 protooncogene encodes a Ser/Thr protein kinase. A mitogen-activated protein kinase-kinase (MAPKK) purified from bovine brain is phosphorylated and activated 4-9-fold in vitro by c-Raf-1 from mitogen-treated cells. c-Raf-1 protein kinase activity, measured by the phosphorylation of brain MAPKK substrate, is detectably activated within 1 min after addition of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) to 3T3 cells, increasing more rapidly than the endogenous NIH 3T3 cell MAPKK activity. c-Raf-1 activation is also induced by insulin, phorbol ester, thrombin, and endothelin. PDGF-, epidermal groth factor-, and insulin-stimulated 32P-c-Raf-1 yield very similar, complex tryptic 32P-peptide maps, wherein only 2 of 10 32P-peptides appear entirely de novo after growth factor addition. Mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase-2 can phosphorylate c-Raf-1 in vitro on 4-6 tryptic 32P-peptides, all of which comigrate with tryptic 32P-peptides derived from c-Raf-1 labeled in situ. Mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation of c-Raf-1 in vitro, however, does not 1) generate 32P-peptides that comigrate with those that appear de novo after PDGF or insulin treatment in situ; 2) does not convert c-Raf-1 polypeptides to a slower mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as is seen after PDGF or insulin; 3) does not alter c-Raf-1 kinase activity toward MAPKK. Thus, based on overlapping site specificity, Erk-2 is a viable candidate to be among the PDGF-stimulated c-Raf-1 kinases. Although PDGF/insulin-stimulated c-Raf-1 Ser/Thr phosphorylation may be necessary to sustain the active state, a role for mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase-2 phosphorylation in the initiation of c-Raf-1 activation is unlikely."
https://openalex.org/W2024975959,"Models of DNA replication in Escherichia coli involve an asymmetric DNA polymerase complex that replicates concurrently the leading and the lagging strands of double-stranded DNA. The effect of asymmetry on mutagenesis was tested with pairs of plasmids containing the unidirectional ColE1 origin of replication and a single lesion located in the leading or lagging strand. The lesion used was the covalent adduct that the chemical carcinogen N-2-acetylaminofluorene (AAF) forms with the C-8 position of guanine. Whether SOS was induced or not, mutations arose at about a 20-fold higher frequency when the AAF adduct was located in the lagging strand than when in the leading strand."
https://openalex.org/W1582185217,"Abstract Aquaporin-CHIP is the first known molecular water channel. Originally identified in red cells and renal tubules, transcripts and proteins related to AQP-CHIP are also expressed in diverse epithelia with distinct developmental patterns. Northern analyses of RNA from several tissues revealed transcripts of 3.1 kilobases and other sizes. The nucleotide sequences of human kidney AQP-CHIP cDNAs are identical to the human bone marrow AQP-CHIP cDNA. The 17-kilobase human AQP-CHIP structural gene was isolated, and restriction maps were constructed and partially sequenced. The TATA consensus sequence is located 87 bp 5' to the translation initiation site, and sequences surrounding the polyadenylation consensus were determined. Four exons were identified corresponding to amino acids 1-128, 129-183, 184-210, and 211-269, separated by introns of 9.6, 0.43, and 0.80 kilobases. Genomic Southern analyses indicated the existence of a single AQP-CHIP gene which was located at human chromosome 7p14 by in situ hybridization. Sequence comparisons of AQP-CHIP and cDNAs of similar proteins from diverse species suggested a common evolutionary origin. At least three of these proteins are now known to function as membrane water pores and are referred to as the Aquaporins. These genomic AQP-CHIP DNA sequences should permit molecular characterization of the complex patterns of AQP-CHIP expression."
https://openalex.org/W1544289096,"alpha 1-Acid glycoprotein (AGP) is a major acute phase protein synthesized primarily by the liver. The AGP gene is transcriptionally activated in hepatocytes during the acute phase response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide. In this study, we analyzed an acute phase responsive element (APRE) located between nucleotide residues -127 to -104 relative to the transcription initiation site of the mouse AGP gene. Binding studies show that several trans-acting factors interact with the APRE. Using monospecific antibodies we demonstrate that three isoforms of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family, namely C/EBP alpha, C/EBP beta, and C/EBP delta, bind to the APRE. Furthermore, with liver nuclear protein from control animals, C/EPB alpha is the predominant form that binds to the APRE, whereas with nuclear proteins from acute phase-induced animals, C/EBP alpha is replaced by C/EBP beta. The mechanism of activation of the AGP gene during the acute phase response appears to involve an exchange of C/EBP alpha by C/EBP beta. C/EBP delta does not play a role in this reaction. Interestingly, the C/EBP binding site of the APRE partially overlaps a functional glucocorticoid responsive element. We present evidence that both purified C/EBP alpha and glucocorticoid receptor bind strongly to the APRE. By site-specific mutation, we have identified the C/EBP and glucocorticoid receptor binding sites in the APRE. These mutants were used in expression vectors to demonstrate that both C/EBP and glucocorticoid receptor are essential for maximal response to interleukin-6 and dexamethasone. These results demonstrate that the APRE is a composite binding site for multiple factors that are responsible for the transcriptional control of the mouse AGP. Finally, functional analyses indicate that C/EBP alpha, C/EBP beta, and C/EBP delta are strong transcriptional trans-activators of the AGP APRE in hepatoma cells. These data suggest that the regulatory activity of the C/EBP with the APRE in the liver may require interactions with adjacent proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1565300119,"Phosphatidylcholine is a major component of membranes in most eukaryotes, but it is found only in a small number of bacteria, where it is synthesized by N-methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine. In yeast and other fungi the methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine proceeds in two steps: the methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine by phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase followed by the methylation of monomethylphosphatidylethanolamine by phospholipid methyltransferase. Here we describe the isolation of two allelic phosphatidylcholine-deficient mutants of Rhodobacter sphaeroides which are unable to methylate phosphatidylethanolamine, monomethylphosphatidylethanolamine, or dimethylphosphatidylethanolamine. A DNA fragment containing a gene designated pmtA, which encodes a 22.9-kDa protein, was found to complement both mutants. Expression of this gene in Escherichia coli, which normally lacks phosphatidylcholine or methylated derivatives of phosphatidylethanolamine, resulted in the formation of phosphatidylcholine. A protein extract derived from the E. coli strain expressing the pmtA gene was able to convert phosphatidylethanolamine, mono- and dimethylphosphatidylethanolamine into phosphatidylcholine. Based on these data we conclude that the product of the pmtA gene catalyzes a sequence of three chemically distinct, methylation reactions beginning with phosphatidylethanolamine and leading to the formation of phosphatidylcholine in R. sphaeroides."

https://openalex.org/W1536511766,"We have shown previously that chondroitin sulfate, but not heparan sulfate/heparin, linked to either natural core proteins or serum albumin interferes with cell-to-substrate adhesion, provided that the external proteoglycans are topologically immobilized on plastic plates. In order to study the roles of glycosaminoglycan chains (GAGs) as recognition structure, a new assay system is now developed which involves the conversion of free GAGs to reactive lactone derivatives selectively modified at the reducing end. The modified GAGs can be coupled to the amino group of phosphatidylethanolamino (PE) for use as probes on either plastic plates or cell surfaces. Incubation of GAG-PE solutions in polystyrene plates results in a time- and dose-dependent increase of the density of the GAG chains noncovalently immobilized onto the plates. No immobilization is detected with any of the GAG-PE samples that have been treated with phospholipase D. A M(r) 30,000 chondroitin sulfate conjugate to PE (CS-PE), when immobilized onto a fibronectin-coated well for 2 h at an initial concentration of 0.06 microgram/100 microliters/well, inhibits the adhesion of baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells to the substratum by approximately 50%, whereas heparin-, heparan sulfate-, hyaluronic acid-, and dermatan sulfate-PE do not. The effect of CS-PE is abolished by treating the CS-PE-coated plates with chondroitinase ABC. A similar level of inhibition by CS-PE is found when the RGD-containing 120-kDa fragment of fibronectin is used in place of fibronectin. CS-PE in soluble form, once exposed to BHK cells in suspension, can be associated with the cell surfaces, thereby exerting some inhibitory effects on cell-to-substrate adhesion. On a per mol basis, however, the activity of cell-associated CS-PE is far lower than that of substrate-associated CS-PE. Together the results indicate that our GAG-PEs offer useful tools for probing regulatory function of the GAG moieties of proteoglycans and further support the hypothesis that the inhibitory regulation of cell-to-matrix adhesion by large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans is caused by an interaction between the cell surface and the chondroitin sulfate chains topologically immobilized on extracellular matrices."
https://openalex.org/W2148826559,"A cDNA coding for cystatin D, a human member of the cystatin protein family, has been cloned after specific amplification of reverse-transcribed parotid gland RNA. After replacing the segment encoding the putative 20-residue signal peptide with one encoding the Escherichia coli OmpA leader sequence, the cDNA was expressed in E. coli. The isolated recombinant protein exhibited Ki values of 1.2 nM and > 1 microM for papain and cathepsin B, respectively. An antiserum raised against recombinant cystatin D recognized a protein in human saliva with electrophoretical mobility identical to that of the recombinant protein. Immunoenzymatic analysis revealed that this cysteine proteinase inhibitor is present in human saliva and tears at concentrations of 3.8 and 0.5 mg/liter, respectively, while it was not detected in seminal plasma, blood plasma, milk, or cerebrospinal fluid. Cystatin D purified from human saliva by immunosorption displayed a heterogeneous N-terminal end, with sequences starting at residues 5, 7, 9, and 11 of the predicted N-terminal portion of the mature protein. On the basis of structural and functional properties, cystatin D represents a novel cysteine proteinase inhibitor possibly playing a protective role against proteinases present in the oral cavity."
https://openalex.org/W1574439919,"Fluorescent derivatives of the bisindolylmaleimide inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC) were synthesized and tested with respect to their inhibitory potency, specificity, and usefulness as fluorescent cytological stains for PKC. Several of the fluorescent bisindolylmaleimide derivatives (fim-1, fim-2, and rim-1) acted as ATP-competitive catalytic site inhibitors and retained much of the potency and specificity of the parental compound. The R6-C1 and the PKC beta 1-overexpressing R6-PKC3 cell lines were used for testing fim-1 and rim-1 as cytological stains for PKC. Comparisons showed that the R6-PKC3 cells stained much more brightly than R6-C1 cells. When R6-PKC3 cells were treated with the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for 30 min, staining with fim-1 or anti-PKC beta 1 revealed a dramatic translocation of PKC to the cell periphery. When R6-PKC3 cells were exposed to PMA for 24 h to down-regulate PKC, cytoplasmic staining was drastically reduced. Staining patterns obtained with an antibody specific for PKC beta 1 and with fim-1 were remarkably similar except for mitochondrial staining, which was only seen with fim-1. A closer examination of the mitochondrial staining showed that mitochondria convert from filamentous to punctate shapes and cluster around the nucleus when cells are treated with PMA. This punctate morphology, perinuclear clustering, and staining with fim-1 persists when PKC is down-regulated. Overall, these results indicate that fim-1 and rim-1 can serve as useful fluorescent probes for PKC. The mitochondrial staining may be due to a PKC isoform resistant to down-regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1630557303,"The calcitonin/calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) gene is transcribed in thyroid C-cells and a subset of neurons. We have localized sequences required for cell-specific enhancement of calcitonin/CGRP transcription in rat thyroid C-cell lines. An 18-base pair element approximately 1 kilobase pair upstream of the transcriptional start site stimulated expression of a luciferase reporter gene 50-fold in 44-2C C-cells. There was less than 2-fold stimulation in HeLa and Rat-1 cells, which do not express the endogenous calcitonin/CGRP gene. The enhancer contains potential binding sites for helix-loop-helix (HLH) and octamer transcription factors based on sequence homologies. The functional significance of these sites was shown by point mutations in the HLH and octamer motifs and by separation of the two motifs, all of which decreased enhancer activity greater than 10-fold. The involvement of HLH proteins was further shown by co-expression of the mammalian achaete-scute homologue-1 HLH protein, which activated the enhancer severalfold in HeLa cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift analyses revealed several DNA-protein complexes containing HLH and octamer-binding proteins. One octamer-binding complex (OB1) most likely contains the ubiquitous Oct-1 protein, whereas a second complex (OB2) was cell-specific. In contrast to OB1, OB2 had lower affinity for a consensus octamer motif, and its DNA binding was not affected by addition of antiserum that recognizes Oct-1 and Oct-2 proteins. In addition, we observed a large complex that appears to contain both an HLH protein and OB2. These results demonstrate that calcitonin/CGRP enhancer activity is controlled by a cell-specific synergistic activation involving HLH and octamer-binding factors."
https://openalex.org/W1487920066,"The promoter region of the human aldose reductase gene has been identified upstream of the translation start ATG codon. The promoter contains a TATA box, a CCAAT promoter element, and three Sp1 protein binding consensus sequences upstream of the capsite. A 640-base pair insert spanning +31 to -609 directs expression of the reporter gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase in an orientation-specific manner in transfected Hep G2 cells. The promoter activity remained constant with deletions from base pairs -609 to -186. The TATA and the CCAAT consensus sequences show significant promoter activity, whereas the three Sp1 binding consensus sequences, individually, have no significant promoter activity. A GA-rich region (-186 to -146) contains two CGGAAA/G motifs, which show promoter activity and interaction with Hep G2 nuclear extract and GA-binding proteins (GABP alpha and GABP beta 1) as shown by mobility shift assays and DNase I footprinting. Similar cis-elements in herpes simplex virus type 1 interact with rat liver GABP and the viral VP16 protein to mediate the induction of immediate early viral genes. A GC-rich region (-87 to -31) is identified by mobility shift assay, and a consensus sequence of an androgen response element is present at -396 to -382. The human aldose reductase promoter, thus, has regulatory response elements that may be important during early development and puberty. These regulatory elements may play a significant role in the development of certain diabetic complications."
https://openalex.org/W1636514590,"We have investigated the processing of O6-methylguanine (O6-MeGua) in plasmid DNA by extracts of human cells defective in O6-MeGua-DNA methyltransferase. Cell extracts of HeLaMR cells performed viral T antigen-independent DNA synthesis on plasmids that had been treated with low concentrations of methylating agents. The in vitro DNA synthesis was non-semiconservative and depended on the presence of O6-MeGua in the substrate. The involvement of DNA polymerase delta or epsilon and proliferating cell nuclear antigen but not single-strand binding protein was indicated by partial fractionation, inhibitor, and antibody studies. Processing of O6-MeGua is not via the UV nucleotide excision repair pathway since additional component(s) are apparently required to perform repair synthesis on the methylated substrate. This is the first direct demonstration of DNA repair synthesis provoked by O6-MeGua in DNA. Since O6-MeGua is not excised from DNA by Mex- cells, it represents a novel type of processing of the methylated base that may be involved in its cytotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1515430029,"Mutations in the norpA gene of Drosophila melanogaster severely affect the light-evoked photoreceptor potential with strong mutations rendering the fly blind. Molecular cloning of the norpA gene revealed that it encodes phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, which enzymes play a pivotal role in one of the largest classes of signaling pathways known. We have used Northern analysis, Western blots, phospholipase C activity assays, and immunohistochemical staining of tissues to examine the tissue-specific expression of the norpA gene and found that it is expressed in a variety of tissues besides the eye. Hybridization of norpA cRNA probe to blots of poly(A+) RNA reveals that the gene encodes at least four transcripts: a 7.5-kilobase (kb) transcript that is expressed in eye and 6.5-, 5.5-, and 5.0-kb transcripts that are expressed in adult body or early stages of development. Antiserum generated against the major gene product of norpA recognizes a 130-kDa protein that is abundant in eyes but severely reduced or absent in norpA mutants, a result which is consistent with previous conclusions that the norpA gene encodes an essential component of the visual system. However, the norpA antiserum also recognizes a 130-kDa protein in adult legs, thorax, and male abdomen, but not female abdomen. These localizations are supported by results of phospholipase C activity assays which show that the norpA mutation reduces phospholipase C activity in each of the tissues in which norpA protein can be detected. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining of tissue sections with the norpA antiserum demonstrates that the norpA protein is abundant in the retina and ocelli and is present to a lesser extent in the brain and thoracic nervous system. Since some of the above mentioned tissues that express norpA (such as thorax, legs, and abdomen) have no known photoreceptor tissue, we conclude that the norpA gene product is also likely to have a role in signaling pathways other than phototransduction."
https://openalex.org/W1580973227,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) core promoter region, extending approximately from nucleotides -40 to +80 relative to the transcription start site, contains a complex array of putative regulatory elements, including a TATA box, an initiator element, an element between the TATA box and start site, binding sites for LBP/UBP, the TAR element, and others. However, because of this elaborate architecture, the precise boundaries and functional roles for the individual regulatory elements have not been defined. To facilitate a detailed analysis of the HIV-1 core promoter, we employed in vitro transcription assays to identify the simplest control elements that activate RNA synthesis in the context of a synthetic, heterologous promoter. Because mutations at the start site previously were shown to diminish transcription, we anticipated finding an initiator as a basic regulator. However, we have demonstrated that the HIV-1 core promoter lacks an initiator that is functionally analogous to those found in the terminal transferase and adenovirus major late promoters. In its place, we identified two elements between -6 and +30, both of which appear to be necessary for significant transcriptional activation. Unlike a strong initiator, the activity of these elements was dependent on the presence of a TATA box and on their position relative to TATA. We have called the region containing these two elements the HIV-1 SSR to distinguish it from the simple transcriptional initiator elements found in other genes."
https://openalex.org/W1576311384,"Compounds with an imidazoline or guanidinium moiety elicit a variety of stimulatory and inhibitory cell responses in both central and peripheral tissues. Many of these effects are mediated by interaction with alpha-adrenergic receptors, but these molecules also selectively recognize other membrane-bound proteins with high affinity. We used a functionalized derivative of the imidazoline molecule cirazoline to visualize the imidazoline/guanidinium-receptive site (IGRS). 2-[3-Aminophenoxy]methyl imidazoline was radioiodinated and subsequently converted to the arylazide to generate the photoaffinity adduct 2-[3-azido-4-[125I]iodophenoxy]methyl imidazoline ([125I]AZIPI). Both 2-[3-amino-4-[125I]iodophenoxy]methyl imidazoline and [125I]AZIPI exhibited saturable high affinity binding in rat liver membrane preparations (Ki = 2-5 nM). In rat liver mitochondrial membranes, [125I]AZIPI photoincorporates into two peptides with apparent molecular weights of approximately 55,000 and approximately 61,000 as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The labeling of these two species is blocked by various competing ligands (10 microM) with a potency order expected for an IGRS. The photolabeling of both peptides is blocked by the imidazolines cirazoline and idazoxan or by the guanidinium guanabenz, but it is not altered by the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor antagonist rauwolscine or by the adrenergic receptor agonist epinephrine. Photoincorporation of [125I]AZIPI is minimally inhibited by the imidazoline clonidine or by the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist prazosin. However, the guanidinium ligand amiloride exhibits higher affinity for the M(r) = 61,000 peptide as compared with the M(r) = 55,000 peptide, suggesting that the two labeled species differ in their ligand recognition properties. An additional IGRS was identified by photolabeling in membranes prepared from PC-12 pheochromocytoma cells. In PC-12 membranes, [125I]AZIPI photolabels a major M(r) = approximately 61,000 peptide; the photoincorporation is blocked by cirazoline, guanabenz, and amiloride but not by idazoxan (competing ligands = 10 microM). These data indicate the existence of at least three subtypes of IGRS that differ in their ligand recognition properties, their apparent molecular weight, and their tissue distribution."
https://openalex.org/W1497994269,"PilD is a bifunctional enzyme responsible for cleavage of the leader peptides from the precursors of the type IV pilin and four proteins with type IV pilin-like amino termini that are required for extracellular protein secretion in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Following cleavage, PilD also catalyzes the second major posttranslational modification of these proteins, namely the N-methylation of the amino-terminal phenylalanine residues of the mature polypeptides. In this report, we demonstrate that the enzymatic activities of PilD involve cysteine residues that lie within a cytoplasmic domain that shows a high degree of similarity to other proteins postulated to perform the same function in other bacterial species. Both activities are reduced in the presence of sulfhydryl-reactive reagents such as N-ethylmaleimide and p-chloromercuribenzoate. Mutagenesis of pilD resulting in specific amino acid substitutions in all of the Cys residues in PilD show that the 4 conserved cysteines in the cytoplasmic domain are required for full peptidase activity in vivo and for complete peptidase and methyltransferase activities in vitro. Conversely, substitution for a Cys residue in a membrane spanning domain had no effect on PilD activities in vivo or in vitro. Evidence suggests that the peptidase and methyltransferase sites of PilD are adjacent, with the Cys residues in the cytoplasmic domain important for methyl donor binding, as prior reaction of PilD with the S-adenosyl-L-methionine analogue sinefungin afforded complete protection of peptidase activity from inactivation with N-ethylmaleimide."
https://openalex.org/W1598257944,"G63, the major surface glycoprotein of Leishmania chagasi promastigotes, increases 11-fold in amount as promastigotes grow from logarithmic to stationary phase. Transcripts from three different classes of gp63 genes are differentially expressed during this development (Ramamoorthy, R., Donelson, J. E., Paetz, K. E., Maybodi, M., Roberts, S. P., and Wilson, M. E. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 1888-1895). We studied the effect of protein synthesis inhibitors on gp63 mRNAs. The steady state level of log class gp63 RNA, expressed primarily in logarithmic phase promastigotes, increased 16.5-fold after incubation in cycloheximide. A similar increase in log gp63 RNAs was caused by inhibitors that block different steps in translation. In contrast, the levels of stationary class gp63 RNA, expressed in stationary phase parasites, and constitutive class gp63 RNA, expressed throughout promastigote growth, increased only 2.3- and 1.5-fold, respectively. The latter was not statistically significant. Nuclear run-on assays showed that the cycloheximide effect was not due to an increased rate of transcription. However, the t1/2 of log RNAs was prolonged 6.5-fold after incubation in cycloheximide, in contrast to a 1.7-fold increase in the t1/2 of ATPase RNA, suggesting that cycloheximide specifically stabilizes log gp63 mRNAs. Thus, a highly labile negative regulatory protein, such as an RNase, may specifically target log gp63 RNAs for degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1595269103,"Previously we showed that fibrils generated from collagen and pNcollagen-ex6 from fibroblasts of an individual with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) type VIIB were hieroglyphic in cross-section and all N-propeptides were located at the fibril surface. Hieroglyphs were resolved to near-cylindrical fibrils (that were similar in appearance to the fibrils seen in the tissues of individuals with EDS type VIIB) by treatment with N-proteinase which cleaved the pN alpha 1(I) chains but not the pN alpha 2(I)-ex6 chains (Watson, R. B., Wallis, G. A., Holmes, D. F., Viljoen, D., Byers, P. H., and Kadler, K. E. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 9093-9100). Here, quantitative scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) showed that N-propeptides in hieroglyphs were in a conformation and thus located exclusively in the overlap zone of the fibril D-period (D = 67 nm). In contrast, STEM of fibrils from the dermis of an individual with EDS type VIIB showed that partially cleaved N-propeptides (in which cleaved pN alpha 1(I) remained in noncovalent association with pN alpha 2(I)-ex6 chains) were distributed equally between the gap and overlap zones of the fibrils. Comparison of experimental data with theoretical mass distributions of the fibril based on amino acid sequence data gave a consistent value of 33 nm for the total axial extent for the N-propeptides in hieroglyphic and tissue fibrils irrespective of the location of N-propeptides to the gap or overlap zone. These data exclude the possibility that N-propeptides adopt a random configuration, but rather, that they locate to specific sites in the gap and overlap zones. The results demonstrated that cleavage of pN alpha 1(I) chains in vivo releases the N-propeptides from the constraints of the bent-back conformation. Co-distribution of partially cleaved N-propeptides between gap and overlap zones allows a higher surface packing density of N-propeptides and explains how circularity of large diameter fibrils can be achieved despite the retention of N-propeptides in tissues of individuals with EDS type VIIB."
https://openalex.org/W1568188870,"beta IL3 (formerly known as AIC2A), a beta subunit of the murine interleukin-3 receptor (IL-3R), is not only required for formation of the high affinity receptor but is also important for signal transduction. To examine the function of beta IL3 in signal transduction, we constructed several chimeric receptors consisting of the intracellular portion of beta IL3 and the extracellular portion of other members of the cytokine receptor superfamily, i.e. the human interleukin-2 receptor beta chain (hIL-2R beta), the human interleukin-4 receptor (hIL-4R), and the murine erythropoietin receptor (mEpoR). These chimeric receptors and normal cytokine receptors were expressed in an IL-3-dependent murine pro-B cell line, Ba/F3, and an IL-2-dependent murine T cell line, CTLL2. Regardless of the origin of the extracellular domain, these chimeric receptors were functional in Ba/F3 cells; they stimulated proliferation and induced tyrosine phosphorylation in response to the cytokine corresponding to the extracellular domain. However, the response of transfectants expressing chimeric receptors was similar to, but not identical with, the response of Ba/F3 cells to mIL-3. We present evidence that the IL-4R and EpoR probably have an additional component which is involved in signal transduction."

https://openalex.org/W1516621219,"Bovine growth hormone (bGH) pre-mRNA is alternatively spliced, resulting in retention of the last intron (intron D) in a fraction of the cytosolic bGH mRNA. To study the mechanism of this alternative splicing event, we examined the splicing of bGH pre-mRNA in vitro. The splicing of bGH intron D in vitro required a 115-base pair segment of exon 5, reflecting the positive influence of exon sequences observed in transfected cells. No detectable spliceosome complex formation was observed using bGH pre-mRNA containing the 115-base pair deletion in exon 5. The in vitro splicing of the wild type bGH pre-mRNA was inhibited by the addition of RNA containing the 115-nucleotide exon sequence, but not by nonspecific RNAs. UV irradiation of the in vitro splicing reaction resulted in specific cross-linking of a 35-kDa protein(s) to the 115-nucleotide bGH exon sequence. These results suggest that terminal exon sequences are required at an early step of spliceosome complex formation and are consistent with a mechanism in which saturable, trans-acting factor(s) bind to these exon sequences to activate spliceosome complex formation and splicing of bGH intron D."

By systematic amino acid substitution of synthetic peptide analogues of FN-C/H II, the basic structural features necessary for activity have been identified in the COOH-terminal residues LIGRKK. This biologically active sequence has been located in several other heparin/heparan sulfate-binding proteins and may represent a potential binding motif for sulfated polyanions. NMR structural studies indicate that the COOH-terminal segment of FN-C/H II displays significant multiple-turn or helix-like character suggesting that the RKK sequence may lie on the same surface of the protein, as opposed to alternating in an extended chain motif."

https://openalex.org/W1592502747,"The proto-oncogene Raf-1 is a cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase implicated in the signaling process in cell proliferation. To determine if Raf-1 is sufficient and necessary to transmit mitogenic signals to growth-responsive genes, we examined the effect of constitutively activated (v-raf) or inhibitory (Raf-C4) Raf-1 proteins on reporter gene activation in transient expression assays of NIH 3T3 cells. In serum-starved cells, v-raf strongly activated transcription from the promoters of the immediate-early genes c-fos and egr-2, as well as the proximal or B promoter of the late growth response gene rep-3 (rep-3b). Two other late response gene promoters, cad and dhfr, were only modestly activated by v-raf, however. An individual serum response element from the c-fos or egr-2 promoter conferred both serum-inducibility and v-raf-responsiveness to a heterologous promoter. Consistent with the degree to which antisense c-raf-1 RNA and dominant-negative Raf-1 proteins interfere with NIH 3T3 cell proliferation, Raf-C4 reduced serum-induced transcription from the egr-2 and rep-3b promoters in a dose-dependent manner by 50%. In contrast, Raf-C4 did not significantly reduce transcription from the c-fos or cad promoters or the serum response element-driven heterologous promoters. We conclude that Raf-1 is both sufficient and necessary to activate a subset of early and late growth response genes."
https://openalex.org/W1538166107,"Pulsed laser cross-linking results in efficient and rapid formation of covalent bonds between proteins and the nucleic acids to which they are bound, creating a snapshot of the protein-nucleic acid equilibrium existing at the moment of irradiation. The frozen equilibrium allows the determination of protein-nucleic acid binding constants, confirming both theoretical predictions and experimental determinations by standard physical chemical methods. Laser cross-linking results accurately reflect the alteration of protein-nucleic acid interactions induced by traditional methods such as increasing the salt concentration or by the addition of a nucleic acid that competes for binding of the protein. Thus this technique is very useful for the study of the association of proteins and protein complexes with nucleic acids under environmental conditions at which the reactions are not amenable to study by traditional physical chemical methods. In this paper we continue our calibration of the method, focusing primarily on interactions with single-stranded DNA-binding proteins and describe techniques for measuring quantitative interactions between nucleic acid constructs and single-protein or multiprotein complexes. Laser cross-linking can also provide direct evidence that binding correlates with functional activity."
https://openalex.org/W1588484334,"Abstract In this paper we examine the interactions of the polymerase accessory proteins subassembly of the bacteriophage T4 DNA replication complex, using single-pulse ultraviolet laser excitation to induce protein-nucleic acid cross-links. The laser-induced cross-linking permits effective freezing of the instantaneous equilibrium state of the complex and thus provides a mechanism to dissect the individual protein-nucleic acid interactions involved in complex assembly. We find that the binding of the gene 44, 62, and 45 proteins is dependent not only on the presence of each of the other proteins, but also on the presence of adenine nucleotide cofactors. We find that the nonhydrolyzable analogs of ATP often behave more like ADP than ATP in these experiments. Gene 45 protein is able to induce an increase in cross-linking of the gp44/62 complex to nucleic acids, and this increased cross-linking correlates with changes in the apparent Km of the gp44/62 complex for polynucleotides and with changes in Vmax during ATP hydrolysis. Our results suggest that the enhanced DNA binding is predominately through the gene 62 protein and not the ATPase catalytic subunit (gene 44 protein). Thus the gene 62 protein seems to play an integral role in gp45-mediated enhancement of the ATP hydrolytic activity of gp44. These results are summarized and integrated in the form of a model for the multiple interactions of the accessory proteins with DNA and one another in the presence of mononucleotide cofactors and substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1550940471,"The enzyme that catalyzed the conversion of human salivary alpha-amylase family A (HSA-A) to family B (HSA-B) was identified. It was partially purified from the precipitate obtained by centrifugation of human saliva at 105,000 x g for 60 min by solubilization with 3[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane sulfonate and column chromatographies with Sephacryl S-300-HR and hydroxylapatite. The enzyme preparation was practically free from contaminating exoglycosidases and proteases. The enzyme cleaved the N,N'-diacetylchitobiose moiety of the sugar chain of HSA-A, as shown by the isolation of the protein moiety which contained 1 GlcNAc and 1 Fuc residue and the sugar chain (Gal)2(Fuc)1(GlcNAc)2(Man)3(GlcNAc). This enzyme also cleaved the N,N'-diacetylchitobiose moiety of the sugar chain of human transferrin tetraglycopeptide Asn-Tyr-Asn(GlcNAc)2(Man)3(GlcNAc)2(Gal)2-Lys to yield equimolar amounts of peptide Asn-Tyr-Asn(GlcNAc)Lys and sugar chain (Gal)2(GlcNAc)2(Man)3(GlcNAc). The enzyme was identified as an endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase. The enzyme acted on HSA-A with desialylated and defucosylated outer chain moieties of the sugar chains at a similar rate as that of native HSA-A. The enzyme activity was reduced to 13 and 5% using HSA-A with the sugar chains whose outer chain moieties lacked Gal and GlcNAc, respectively, from the nonreducing end. The enzyme also acted on human transferrin, calf fetuin, and asparagine oligosaccharides of transferrin and fetuin. On the other hand, the enzyme did not act on ovalbumin, RNase B, Taka-amylase, yeast invertase, and ovalbumin asparagine oligosaccharides. These results indicate that human salivary endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase is specific for complex type sugar chains and can release the sugar chains from native glycoproteins and glycopeptides regardless of the existence of a Fuc residue on the proximal GlcNAc of the N,N'-diacetylchitobiose core of their sugar chains. The source of the enzyme was epithelial cells peeling from the oral cavity epithelium into saliva. The enzyme was thought to be integrated on the surface of the epithelial cell membrane. This enzyme was named endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase HS. Thus, these studies indicate that the properties of the enzyme are distinct from those of known endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase and endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase HS is a novel endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase."
https://openalex.org/W1490591463,"The expression of class I major histocompatibility complex antigens on the surface of cells transformed by adenovirus 12 (Ad12) is generally very low. The absence of class I antigens correlates with the high oncogenicity of this virus. In primary embryonal fibroblasts from transgenic mice that express both endogenous H-2 genes and a miniature swine class I gene (PD1), Ad12-mediated transformation results in complete suppression of cell surface expression of class I antigens, but only 50% of the cell lines tested demonstrated decreased steady state levels of class I mRNA. The complete absence of cell surface class I antigens is accompanied by decreased levels of newly synthesized class I molecules. Those molecules that are immunoprecipitated by class I-specific antibodies are assembled with beta 2-microglobulin, but their transport through the Golgi is inefficient. The biosynthesis of both the endogenous H-2K, H-2D, and the transgene product, PD1, is similarly altered in the transformed cells. The results suggest that Ad12 transformation is associated with both reduced synthesis rate and inefficient transport of class I molecules to the cell surface. This might be a general mechanism by which virus-infected or -transformed cells escape immune surveillance."

L-system functional recovery is induced in CLL B-cells by the maturational agent, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). The studies reported here extend the analysis of CLL B-cell maturation by comparing membrane protein expression in untreated and TPA-treated CLL B-cells, with the identification of candidate proteins for the L-system transporter. Cell membrane proteins of resting and TPA-treated CLL B-lymphocytes were studied using ultrahigh resolution giant two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Cellular proteins were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine, and, in separate experiments, membrane proteins were photoaffinity labeled with [125I] iodoazidophenylalanine, an amino acid transporter by the L-system and which binds at or near the L-system transport carrier. In a partially purified membrane preparation, approximately 1400 proteins were identified by metabolic labeling. Following TPA treatment for 17 h, 14 new metabolically labeled membrane proteins were identified, and five of these also were labeled by the L-system photoprobe. Photolabeling of four of these proteins was inhibited by an excess of the L-system prototype amino acid, 2-aminobicyclo(2.2.1)heptane-2-carboxylic acid. Given these labeling characteristics, one or more of these four proteins may be related to the L-system amino acid transport carrier."

https://openalex.org/W1562716593,"As is the case with many other peptide hormones of the brain and gut, gastrin requires a carboxyl-terminal amide moiety for optimal biological activity. In the structure of progastrin, the carboxyl-terminal Phe of gastrin is followed by the sequence Gly93-Arg94-Arg95, which must be processed sequentially by an endoprotease, a carboxypeptidase, and an amidating enzyme to produce amidated bioactive gastrin. To examine the molecular determinants of peptide amidation in vivo, we mutated the wild-type Gly93 residue of progastrin to Ala93 and Ser93 and expressed the three progastrin DNAs in GH3 and MTC 6-23 endocrine cell lines. Although substantial quantities of amidated gastrin were seen in cells expressing wild-type progastrin, replacement of Gly93 with Ala93 completely abolished production of amidated gastrin when the cells were incubated in standard medium containing only L-alanine. In a similar fashion, cells expressing [Ser93]progastrin also demonstrated no production of amidated gastrin. When cells expressing [Ala93]- or [Ser93]progastrin were incubated in the presence of 1 mg/ml D-alanine or D-serine, respectively, a small but consistent amount of amidated gastrin production was detected (< 1% of wild type). These data lead us to conclude that the amidating enzyme has a rigid substrate specificity for a glycine-extended precursor. Furthermore, this in vivo substrate specificity confirms the importance of the pro-S-alpha-hydrogen of the carboxyl-terminal glycine for enzyme-substrate recognition."
