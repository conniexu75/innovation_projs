https://openalex.org/W2048977235,"Opening a Surface Gap Many properties of topological insulators are a consequence of their so-called gapless surface state, in which electrons are protected from back-scattering, thanks to time-reversal symmetry. Breaking the time-reversal symmetry and opening a surface gap offers prospects for studying phenomena relevant to particle physics, such as axion electrodynamics. To achieve this, Chen et al. (p. 659 ; see the Perspective by Franz ) doped the three-dimensional topological insulator Bi 2 Se 3 with magnetic dopants and observed the opening of a surface gap. Simultaneous doping with charge dopants was used to shift the Fermi energy to the inside of the surface gap, thus achieving an insulating gapped Dirac state. Both the size of the gap and the position of the Fermi energy level were tunable by varying the nature and the density of the dopants."

Using a high-throughput chemical screen, Boitano et al. (p. 1345 , published online 5 August; see the Perspective by Sauvageau and Humphries ) found that a purine derivative, StemRegenin1 (SR1), promoted the expansion of human HSCs. Treatment of HSCs with SR1 (which blocked the activity of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor) led to the expansion of CD34 + cells and a 12 to 17-fold increase in the number of HSCs that engraft immune deficient mice."
https://openalex.org/W2094684530,"Threats to and from Bats Bats appear to be able to host an assortment of alarming pathogens, which, if they do not extirpate the bats, have implications for human health (see the Perspective by Daszak ). For example, exposure to bats is the main source of human rabies in the Americas. But rabies is not generally transmitted among people; humans are a dead end for the virus. Streicker et al. (p. 676 , see the cover) show that rabies virus lineages tend to be specific for bat lineages. It seems that although rabies viruses have the potential for rapid evolution, this property alone is not enough to overcome genetic barriers, which inhibit the onward transmission of rabies virus into a new species. White-nose syndrome, an exotic fungal infection of bats, has, over the past 3 years, spread from upstate New York to West Virginia, killing on average 70% of the animals in a hibernating colony. The infection makes bats restless over winter when they should be dormant, which makes them exhaust their fat reserves, resulting in the death of over a million bats. Frick et al. (p. 679 ) have analyzed population data collected on bats in the northeastern United States for the past 30 years and show that, mainly owing to white-nose syndrome, the once abundant little brown bat is heading for regional extinction in the next 16 years or so. This scale of loss of an insectivorous mammal is expected to have repercussions for ecosystem integrity and for the economic costs of agricultural pest control."

Leach et al. (p. 662 ) now show such strong quantum correlations between the complementary variables—angular position and orbital angular momentum—of two photons created during the parametric down-conversion process in a nonlinear crystal. This demonstration of entanglement in an angular basis establishes that angles are genuine quantum observables and can therefore be considered a resource for quantum information processing, capable of secure, high-dimension, key distribution."

https://openalex.org/W2075293125,"Visual, acoustic, and olfactory stimuli associated with a highly charged emotional situation take on the affective qualities of that situation. Where the emotional meaning of a given sensory experience is stored is a matter of debate. We found that excitotoxic lesions of auditory, visual, or olfactory secondary sensory cortices impaired remote, but not recent, fear memories in rats. Amnesia was modality-specific and not due to an interference with sensory or emotional processes. In these sites, memory persistence was dependent on ongoing protein kinase Mzeta activity and was associated with an increased activity of layers II-IV, thus suggesting a synaptic strengthening of corticocortical connections. Lesions of the same areas left intact the memory of sensory stimuli not associated with any emotional charge. We propose that secondary sensory cortices support memory storage and retrieval of sensory stimuli that have acquired a behavioral salience with the experience."
https://openalex.org/W1976005990,"Autophagy is a protein degradation process by which cells recycle cytoplasmic contents under stress conditions or during senescence; a basal level of housekeeping autophagy also occurs under non-stressed conditions. Although a number of genes that function in autophagy (ATG genes) have been identified in plants, the upstream components that regulate the plant autophagy pathway are still obscure. Target of rapamycin (TOR) is a negative regulator of autophagy in both yeast and animals, and homologs of TOR in plants control plant growth and protein synthesis. However, a role for TOR in regulation of autophagy in plants has not been demonstrated previously.In this paper we used RNA interference (RNAi) to generate transgenic plants with reduced AtTOR transcript level. By observing monodansylcadaverine- (MDC) and GFP-AtATG8e-labeled autophagosomes, these plants were demonstrated to have constitutive AtATG18a-dependent autophagy. Reverse transcriptase-PCR also showed increased expression of some AtATG genes in the RNAi-AtTOR plants. Unlike autophagy induced by starvation or salt stress, an NADPH oxidase inhibitor did not inhibit the constitutive autophagy in the RNAi-AtTOR lines, indicating that AtTOR is either downstream of or in a parallel pathway to NADPH oxidase.Together, our results provide evidence that TOR is a negative regulator of autophagy in plants."
https://openalex.org/W2128360354,"Background Protein adsorption is the first of a complex series of events that regulates many phenomena at the nano-bio interface, e.g. cell adhesion and differentiation, in vivo inflammatory responses and protein crystallization. A quantitative understanding of how nanoscale morphology influences protein adsorption is strategic for providing insight into all of these processes, however this understanding has been lacking until now. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we introduce novel methods for quantitative high-throughput characterization of protein-surface interaction and we apply them in an integrated experimental strategy, to study the adsorption of a panel of proteins on nanostructured surfaces. We show that the increase of nanoscale roughness (from 15 nm to 30 nm) induces a decrease of protein binding affinity (≤90%) and a relevant increase in adsorbed proteins (≤500%) beyond the corresponding increase of specific area. We demonstrate that these effects are caused by protein nucleation on the surface, which is promoted by surface nanoscale pores. Conclusions/Significance These results show that the adsorption of proteins depends significantly on surface nanostructure and that the relevant morphological parameter regulating the protein adsorption process is the nanometric pore shape. These new findings improve our understanding of the role of nanostructures as a biomaterial design parameter and they have important implications for the general understanding of cell behavior on nanostructured surfaces."

(p. 1050 , published online 5 August) measured the chlorine isotope content of lunar samples returned by the Apollo missions and found that the spread in their chlorine isotope composition is 25-fold greater than for rocks and minerals that have been measured from Earth and meteorites. This result implies that the hydrogen content of the Moon (and therefore its water content) is much lower than suggested by recent studies."
https://openalex.org/W1989223984,"A family of bacterial effectors including Cif homolog from Burkholderia pseudomallei (CHBP) and Cif from Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) adopt a functionally important papain-like hydrolytic fold. We show here that CHBP was a potent inhibitor of the eukaryotic ubiquitination pathway. CHBP acted as a deamidase that specifically and efficiently deamidated Gln40 in ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 both in vitro and during Burkholderia infection. Deamidated ubiquitin was impaired in supporting ubiquitin-chain synthesis. Cif selectively deamidated NEDD8, which abolished the activity of neddylated Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs). Ubiquitination and ubiquitin-dependent degradation of multiple CRL substrates were impaired by Cif in EPEC-infected cells. Mutations of substrate-contacting residues in Cif abolished or attenuated EPEC-induced cytopathic phenotypes of cell cycle arrest and actin stress fiber formation."
https://openalex.org/W2049111734,"Background The susceptibility status of Anopheles funestus to insecticides remains largely unknown in most parts of Africa because of the difficulty in rearing field-caught mosquitoes of this malaria vector. Here we report the susceptibility status of the An. funestus population from Tororo district in Uganda and a preliminary characterisation of the putative resistance mechanisms involved. Methodology/Principal Findings A new forced egg laying technique used in this study significantly increased the numbers of field-caught females laying eggs and generated more than 4000 F1 adults. WHO bioassays indicated that An. funestus in Tororo is resistant to pyrethroids (62% mortality after 1 h exposure to 0.75% permethrin and 28% mortality to 0.05% deltamethrin). Suspected DDT resistance was also observed with 82% mortality. However this population is fully susceptible to bendiocarb (carbamate), malathion (organophosphate) and dieldrin with 100% mortality observed after exposure to each of these insecticides. Sequencing of a fragment of the sodium channel gene containing the 1014 codon conferring pyrethroid/DDT resistance in An. gambiae did not detect the L1014F kdr mutation but a correlation between haplotypes and resistance phenotype was observed indicating that mutations in other exons may be conferring the knockdown resistance in this species. Biochemical assays suggest that resistance in this population is mediated by metabolic resistance with elevated level of GSTs, P450s and pNPA compared to a susceptible strain of Anopheles gambiae. RT-PCR further confirmed the involvement of P450s with a 12-fold over-expression of CYP6P9b in the Tororo population compared to the fully susceptible laboratory colony FANG. Conclusion This study represents the first report of pyrethroid/DDT resistance in An. funestus from East Africa. With resistance already reported in southern and West Africa, this indicates that resistance in An. funestus may be more widespread than previously assumed and therefore this should be taken into account for the implementation and management of vector control programs in Africa."
https://openalex.org/W1970812296,"Fermi liquid theory explains the thermodynamic and transport properties of most metals. The so-called non-Fermi liquids deviate from these expectations and include exotic systems such as the strange metal phase of cuprate superconductors and heavy fermion materials near a quantum phase transition. We used the anti-de-Sitter/conformal field theory correspondence to identify a class of non-Fermi liquids; their low-energy behavior is found to be governed by a nontrivial infrared fixed point, which exhibits nonanalytic scaling behavior only in the time direction. For some representatives of this class, the resistivity has a linear temperature dependence, as is the case for strange metals."
https://openalex.org/W1979217402,"Orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP) plays a key role in transcriptional repression of gluconeogenic enzyme gene expression. Here, we show that SHP inhibited protein kinase A-mediated transcriptional activity of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB), a major regulator of glucose metabolism, to modulate hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression. Deletion analysis of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) promoter demonstrated that SHP inhibited forskolin-mediated induction of PEPCK gene transcription via inhibition of CREB transcriptional activity. In vivo imaging demonstrated that SHP inhibited CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 2 (CRTC2)-mediated cAMP-response element-driven promoter activity. Furthermore, overexpression of SHP using adenovirus SHP decreased CRTC2-dependent elevations in blood glucose levels and PEPCK or glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) expression in mice. SHP and CREB physically interacted and were co-localized in vivo. Importantly, SHP inhibited both wild type CRTC2 and S171A (constitutively active form of CRTC2) coactivator activity and disrupted CRTC2 recruitment on the PEPCK gene promoter. In addition, metformin or overexpression of a constitutively active form of AMPK (Ad-CA-AMPK) inhibited S171A-mediated PEPCK and G6Pase gene expression, and hepatic glucose production and knockdown of SHP partially relieved the metformin- and Ad-CA-AMPK-mediated repression of hepatic gluconeogenic enzyme gene expression in primary rat hepatocytes. In conclusion, our results suggest that a delayed effect of metformin-mediated induction of SHP gene expression inhibits CREB-dependent hepatic gluconeogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2116542858,"Two Ways to Nucleotide Reduction Ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) are essential for DNA synthesis and repair in all organisms, initiating nucleotide reduction through a free-radical mechanism. The class Ib RNRs are the primary aerobic RNRs for many human pathogens. NrdF, the class Ib RNR of Escherichia coli , can initiate nucleotide reduction through either a Fe III 2 -Y• or a Mn III 2 -Y• cofactor. Whereas the Fe-based cofactor can self-assemble, assembly of the Mn-based free radical requires a reduced flavoprotein, NrdI. Boal et al. (p. 1526 , published online 5 August; see the Perspective by Sjöberg ) have gained insight into the mechanism of cofactor activation by determining structures of Mn II 2 -NrdF, Fe II 2 -NrdF, and Mn II 2 -NrdF in complex with reduced and oxidized NrdI. The structures show how a single protein, NrdF, can use two different oxidants to activate two different metallocofactors using distinct chemistries."
https://openalex.org/W2046508842,"Clearance of synaptically released dopamine is regulated by the plasmalemmal dopamine transporter (DAT), an integral membrane protein that resides within a complex lipid milieu. Here we demonstrate that cholesterol, a major component of the lipid bilayer, can modulate the conformation of DAT and alter cocaine binding to DAT. In striatal synaptosomes and transfected cells, DAT was in cholesterol-rich membrane fractions after mild detergent extraction. After increasing the membrane cholesterol content by treatment of water-soluble cholesterol (cholesterol mixed with methyl-β-cyclodextrin), we observed an increase in DAT binding B(max) values for cocaine analogs [(3)H]WIN35428 and [(125)I]RTI-55, but similar levels of DAT proteins on the cell surface were shown by surface biotinylation assays. Membrane cholesterol addition also markedly enhanced the accessibility of cysteine sulfhydryl moieties in DAT as probed by a membrane-impermeable maleimide-biotin conjugate. We identified cysteine 306, a juxtamembrane residue on transmembrane domain 6 (TM6) of DAT, as the intrinsic residue exhibiting enhanced reactivity. Similar effects on DAT cysteine accessibility and radioligand binding were observed with addition of zinc, a reagent known to promote the outward facing conformation of DAT. Using substituted cysteine mutants on various positions likely to be extracellular, we identified additional residues located on TM1, TM6, TM7, and TM12 of DAT that are sensitive to alterations in the membrane cholesterol content. Our findings in transfected cells and native tissues support the hypothesis that DAT adopts an outward facing conformation in a cholesterol-rich membrane environment, suggesting a novel modulatory role of the surrounding membrane lipid milieu on DAT function."
https://openalex.org/W2019461187,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a critical role in normal development as well as retinal vasculature disease. During retinal vascularization, VEGF is most strongly expressed by not yet vascularized retinal astrocytes, but also by retinal astrocytes within the developing vascular plexus, suggesting a role for retinal astrocyte-derived VEGF in angiogenesis and vessel network maturation. To test the role of astrocyte-derived VEGF, we used Cre-lox technology in mice to delete VEGF in retinal astrocytes during development. Surprisingly, this only had a minor impact on retinal vasculature development, with only small decreases in plexus spreading, endothelial cell proliferation and survival observed. In contrast, astrocyte VEGF deletion had more pronounced effects on hyperoxia-induced vaso-obliteration and led to the regression of smooth muscle cell-coated radial arteries and veins, which are usually resistant to the vessel-collapsing effects of hyperoxia. These results suggest that VEGF production from retinal astrocytes is relatively dispensable during development, but performs vessel stabilizing functions in the retinal vasculature and might be relevant for retinopathy of prematurity in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2072688864,"Measuring Motion Within a solid, atoms vibrate about their mean position in a series of frequencies known as the normal modes, which relate to the thermal and mechanical transport properties of the material. D. Kaya et al. (p. 656 ) used video microscopy to observe the motion of colloidal crystals made from microgel particles. The colloidal particles varied slightly in their properties, allowing the behavior of disordered materials to be probed. Long-wavelength plane-wave modes were observed, characteristic of perfect crystals, and a conventional elastic behavior, modified by short-wavelength features, was also observed, in spite of the disorder of the colloidal crystals. The analysis method will allow studies on the effects of different types of disorder on the structure of the normal modes and the elasticity in a range of material systems."
https://openalex.org/W2158409776,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the presence of early intraneuronal deposits of amyloid-beta 42 (Abeta42) that precede extracellular amyloid deposition in vulnerable brain regions. It has been hypothesized that endosomal/lysosomal dysfunction might be associated with the pathological accumulation of intracellular Abeta42 in the brain. Our previous findings suggest that the LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), a major receptor for apolipoprotein E, facilitates intraneuronal Abeta42 accumulation in mouse brain. However, direct evidence of neuronal endocytosis of Abeta42 through LRP1 is lacking.Here we show that LRP1 endocytic function is required for neuronal Abeta42 uptake. Overexpression of a functional LRP1 minireceptor, mLRP4, increases Abeta42 uptake and accumulation in neuronal lysosomes. Conversely, knockdown of LRP1 expression significantly decreases neuronal Abeta42 uptake. Disruptions of LRP1 endocytic function by either clathrin knockdown or by removal of its cytoplasmic tail decreased both uptake and accumulation of Abeta42 in neurons. Finally, we show that LRP1-mediated neuronal accumulation of Abeta42 is associated with increased cellular toxicity.These results demonstrate that LRP1 endocytic function plays an important role in the uptake and accumulation of Abeta42 in neuronal lysosomes. These findings emphasize the central function of LRP1 in neuronal Abeta metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W2099107111,"Antigen recognition by T cells involves large scale spatial reorganization of numerous receptor, adhesion, and costimulatory proteins within the T cell-antigen presenting cell (APC) junction. The resulting patterns can be distinctive, and are collectively known as the immunological synapse. Dynamical assembly of cytoskeletal network is believed to play an important role in driving these assembly processes. In one experimental strategy, the APC is replaced with a synthetic supported membrane. An advantage of this configuration is that solid structures patterned onto the underlying substrate can guide immunological synapse assembly into altered patterns. Here, we use mobile anti-CD3epsilon on the spatial-partitioned supported bilayer to ligate and trigger T cell receptor (TCR) in live Jurkat T cells. Simultaneous tracking of both TCR clusters and GFP-actin speckles reveals their dynamic association and individual flow patterns. Actin retrograde flow directs the inward transport of TCR clusters. Flow-based particle tracking algorithms allow us to investigate the velocity distribution of actin flow field across the whole synapse, and centripetal velocity of actin flow decreases as it moves toward the center of synapse. Localized actin flow analysis reveals that, while there is no influence on actin motion from substrate patterns directly, velocity differences of actin are observed over physically trapped TCR clusters. Actin flow regains its velocity immediately after passing through confined TCR clusters. These observations are consistent with a dynamic and dissipative coupling between TCR clusters and viscoelastic actin network."
https://openalex.org/W2012576713,"VEGF proteolysis by plasmin or matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is believed to play an important role in regulating vascular patterning in vivo by releasing VEGF from the extracellular matrix (ECM). However, a quantitative understanding of the kinetics of VEGF cleavage and the efficiency of cell-mediated VEGF release is currently lacking. To address these uncertainties, we develop a molecular-detailed quantitative model of VEGF proteolysis, used here in the context of an endothelial sprout.To study a cell's ability to cleave VEGF, the model captures MMP secretion, VEGF-ECM binding, VEGF proteolysis from VEGF165 to VEGF114 (the expected MMP cleavage product of VEGF165) and VEGF receptor-mediated recapture. Using experimental data, we estimated the effective bimolecular rate constant of VEGF165 cleavage by plasmin to be 328 M(-1) s(-1) at 25 degrees C, which is relatively slow compared to typical MMP-ECM proteolysis reactions. While previous studies have implicated cellular proteolysis in growth factor processing, we show that single cells do not individually have the capacity to cleave VEGF to any appreciable extent (less than 0.1% conversion). In addition, we find that a tip cell's receptor system will not efficiently recapture the cleaved VEGF due to an inability of cleaved VEGF to associate with Neuropilin-1.Overall, VEGF165 cleavage in vivo is likely to be mediated by the combined effect of numerous cells, instead of behaving in a single-cell-directed, autocrine manner. We show that heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) potentiate VEGF cleavage by increasing the VEGF clearance time in tissues. In addition, we find that the VEGF-HSPG complex is more sensitive to proteases than is soluble VEGF, which may imply its potential relevance in receptor signaling. Finally, according to our calculations, experimentally measured soluble protease levels are approximately two orders of magnitude lower than that needed to reconcile levels of VEGF cleavage seen in pathological situations."

https://openalex.org/W2134966375,"Background The extraordinary morphology, reproductive and developmental biology, and behavioral ecology of twisted wing parasites (order Strepsiptera) have puzzled biologists for centuries. Even today, the phylogenetic position of these enigmatic “insects from outer space” [1] remains uncertain and contentious. Recent authors have argued for the placement of Strepsiptera within or as a close relative of beetles (order Coleoptera), as sister group of flies (order Diptera), or even outside of Holometabola. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we combine data from several recent studies with new data (for a total of 9 nuclear genes and ∼13 kb of aligned data for 34 taxa), to help clarify the phylogenetic placement of Strepsiptera. Our results unequivocally support the monophyly of Neuropteroidea ( = Neuropterida + Coleoptera) + Strepsiptera, but recover Strepsiptera either derived from within polyphagan beetles (order Coleoptera), or in a position sister to Neuropterida. All other supra-ordinal- and ordinal-level relationships recovered with strong nodal support were consistent with most other recent studies. Conclusions/Significance These results, coupled with the recent proposed placement of Strepsiptera sister to Coleoptera, suggest that while the phylogenetic neighborhood of Strepsiptera has been identified, unequivocal placement to a specific branch within Neuropteroidea will require additional study."
https://openalex.org/W2033031412,"Although the general cytotoxicity of selenite is well established, the mechanism by which this compound crosses cellular membranes is still unknown. Here, we show that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the transport system used opportunistically by selenite depends on the phosphate concentration in the growth medium. Both the high and low affinity phosphate transporters are involved in selenite uptake. When cells are grown at low Pi concentrations, the high affinity phosphate transporter Pho84p is the major contributor to selenite uptake. When phosphate is abundant, selenite is internalized through the low affinity Pi transporters (Pho87p, Pho90p, and Pho91p). Accordingly, inactivation of the high affinity phosphate transporter Pho84p results in increased resistance to selenite and reduced uptake in low Pi medium, whereas deletion of SPL2, a negative regulator of low affinity phosphate uptake, results in exacerbated sensitivity to selenite. Measurements of the kinetic parameters for selenite and phosphate uptake demonstrate that there is a competition between phosphate and selenite ions for both Pi transport systems. In addition, our results indicate that Pho84p is very selective for phosphate as compared with selenite, whereas the low affinity transporters discriminate less efficiently between the two ions. The properties of phosphate and selenite transport enable us to propose an explanation to the paradoxical increase of selenite toxicity when phosphate concentration in the growth medium is raised above 1 mm. Although the general cytotoxicity of selenite is well established, the mechanism by which this compound crosses cellular membranes is still unknown.

The properties of phosphate and selenite transport enable us to propose an explanation to the paradoxical increase of selenite toxicity when phosphate concentration in the growth medium is raised above 1 mm. Although toxic at high concentrations, selenium is required in many cells, because it is translationally incorporated as selenocysteine into selenoproteins that perform specific and essential functions (1Rayman M.P. Lancet. 2000; 356: 233-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3248) Google Scholar). Cells must ensure selenium uptake to sustain this metabolism. However, little is known about selenium transport. Because selenium and sulfur are chalcogen elements that have many chemical properties in common, selenium shares metabolic pathways with sulfur. Accordingly, selenate was shown to be taken up by the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae sulfate permeases (2Cherest H. Davidian J.C. Thomas D. Benes V. Ansorge W. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Genetics. 1997; 145: 627-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, in plants, selenate is taken up by roots via the high affinity sulfate transporters (3Sors T.G. Ellis D.R. Salt D.E. Photosynth. Res. 2005; 86: 373-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). On the other hand, specific selenite transporters have never been identified so far. The sulfate ABC transporter of Escherichia coli mediates selenite uptake in addition to that of selenate (4Lindblow-Kull C. Kull F.J. Shrift A. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 1267-1269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, repression of the expression of that transporter does not quench selenite uptake completely, indicating that an alternative entry pathway exists for selenite (5Turner R.J. Weiner J.H. Taylor D.E. Biometals. 1998; 11: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, which does not possess selenoproteins, an energy-dependent uptake of selenite, distinct from that of selenate, was reported. Characterization of the kinetics of selenite uptake suggested the existence of two transport systems: a high affinity system at low selenite concentration and a low affinity system at higher concentration (6Gharieb M.M. Gadd G.M. Mycol. Res. 2004; 108: 1415-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Recently, a study of selenite uptake by wheat (Triticum aestivum) roots showed it to be an active process competitively inhibited by phosphate, suggesting a role for the plant phosphate transporters in selenite uptake (7Li H.F. McGrath S.P. Zhao F.J. New Phytol. 2008; 178: 92-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in S. cerevisiae, a correlation between resistance to the toxicity of selenite and the expression of a high affinity phosphate transporter has been evidenced (8Pinson B. Merle M. Franconi J.M. Daignan-Fornier B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35273-35280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this study, we asked whether the selenite and phosphate oxyanions, which have similar sizes and charges at pH 6, share the same pathways to enter S. cerevisiae cells. Phosphate is an essential nutrient required for numerous biological processes such as biosynthesis of nucleic acids and phospholipids. In S. cerevisiae, the inorganic phosphate (Pi) acquisition system is composed of five transporters (9Wykoff D.D. O'Shea E.K. Genetics. 2001; 159: 1491-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three of them (Pho87p, Pho90p, and Pho91p) are constitutively transcribed and take up phosphate with low affinity (10Auesukaree C. Homma T. Kaneko Y. Harashima S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 306: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).

This well characterized regulatory pathway requires the transcription factor Pho4p, whose nuclear or cytoplasmic localization depends on the cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase complex Pho80p-Pho85p and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Pho81p. When phosphate is limiting, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Pho81p inactivates the Pho80p-Pho85p complex, leading to accumulation of unphosphorylated Pho4p in the nucleus and subsequent activation of phosphate-responsive genes (14Oshima Y.

Acta. 1999; 1422: 255-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). When phosphate is abundant, Pho4p is phosphorylated by the Pho80p-Pho85p complex and exported to the cytoplasm by the receptor Msn5p, where it becomes unable to activate transcription. One of the genes up-regulated by the PHO pathway is SPL2, a negative regulator of the low affinity phosphate transporters (18Wykoff D.D. Rizvi A.H. Raser J.M. Margolin B. O'Shea E.K. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 1005-1013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Inhibition of the low affinity phosphate transport is likely to occur through a physical interaction with Spl2 because both Pho87p and Pho90p have an SPX (SYG1, pho81, XPR1) domain that has been shown to bind the regulatory protein Spl2p (19Hürlimann H.C. Pinson B. Stadler-Waibel M. Zeeman S.C. Freimoser F.M. EMBO Rep. 2009; 10: 1003-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, although the low affinity phosphate transporters are not transcriptionally regulated in response to external phosphate availability, their transport activity is inhibited post-transcriptionally following phosphate starvation. Overall, the above regulatory mechanism results in cells that use either the high affinity or the low affinity transport systems, depending on phosphate availability. phosphate signal transduction synthetic dextrose 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. In this study, we show that selenite toxicity is dependent on phosphate concentrations in the growth medium. Selenite uptake measurements allow us to establish that both the high affinity phosphate transporter Pho84p as well as the low affinity carriers mediate selenite uptake in S. cerevisiae and that phosphate and selenite compete for uptake by both these systems. Primacy of one transport system on the other depends on the phosphate concentration conditions used to grow the cells. The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are derived from strain BY4742 (MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0). The parental and all the single mutants were purchased from Euroscarf. The double and triple mutant strains were constructed by replacing the entire reading frame of the reference gene with a PCR-generated marker cassette containing either the URA3kl or the LEU2 genes (20Baudin A. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Denouel A. Lacroute F. Cullin C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3329-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). All of the disruptions were verified by PCR analysis. The constructed strains are as follows: Δpho87-Δpho90 (BY4742 pho87::KanMX4; pho90::URA3kl), Δpho87-Δpho91 (BY4742 pho87::KanMX4; pho91::URA3kl), Δpho90-Δpho91 (BY4742 pho90::KanMX4;pho91::URA3kl), Δpho84-Δspl2 (BY4742 pho84::KanMX4; spl2::URA3kl), and Δpho87-Δpho90-Δpho91 (BY4742 pho87::KanMX4; pho90::URA3kl; pho91::LEU2).

Standard synthetic dextrose (SD) minimal medium contained 0.67% yeast nitrogen base (Difco), 2% glucose, and 50 mg/liter of histidine, leucine, lysine, and uracil and was buffered at pH 6.0 by the addition of 50 mm MES-NaOH. This medium contained 7.3 mm phosphate. Phosphate-depleted SD medium was prepared as described (21Bisson L.F. Thorner J. Genetics. 1982; 102: 341-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Then 2% glucose, 50 mg/liter of histidine, leucine, lysine, and uracil, and 50 mm MES were added to the filtered phosphate-depleted medium, and the pH was adjusted to 6.0 with HCl. The medium was filtered through a 0.2-μm filter unit (Nalgene). This medium contained less than 50 μm phosphate (21Bisson L.F. Thorner J. Genetics. 1982; 102: 341-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and did not support growth of the parental strain. Phosphate was added to this medium at the indicated concentrations from a 100 mm potassium phosphate pH 6.0 solution. The strains were always pregrown overnight at 30 °C in SD medium containing the amount of phosphate used in the following experiments with the exception of strains containing the Δpho4 or Δpho84 deletions, which do not grow well in low phosphate medium. These strains were pregrown at 0.6 or 0.8 mm phosphate prior to dilution to the desired phosphate concentration and incubated further for at least 4 h. For growth inhibition, the cells were inoculated in phosphate-defined medium at an OD650 of 0.12 and left to grow at 30 °C for 1 h. Then 5 mm Na2SeO3 (Sigma) was added to half of the cultures, and growth was monitored by following the OD650 as a function of time. For viability assays, the cells were inoculated in phosphate-defined medium to obtain an OD650 of 0.025 and left to grow at 30 °C. When the OD650 reached 0.1, sodium selenite, selenate, or selenide was added to 1 ml of the cultures at the desired final concentration. After 1 h at 30 °C under agitation, the samples were diluted 1000-fold in water. To monitor cell viability, 200-μl aliquots of this dilution were plated in duplicate onto YPD agar plates. The plates were left to grow for 2 days at 30 °C prior to scoring. The strains were pregrown overnight as indicated above. The cells were inoculated in phosphate-defined medium to obtain an OD650 of 0.4 and left to grow at 30 °C. When the OD650 reached 1.5, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed with SD medium without phosphate. The cells were resuspended in SD medium without phosphate at a density of 1 OD650/ml and incubated at 30 °C for 5 min prior to the addition of [32P]Pi (PerkinElmer Life Science). Uptake measurements were initiated by the addition of 0.1 ml of [32P]Pi (final concentrations from 5 to 7500 μm; specific activity between 103 and 106 dpm·nmol−1) to 0.9 ml of cell suspension. The assays were terminated at 3 and 6 min by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold 0.5 m phosphate, pH 6.0. Cell suspensions were then filtered using 0.45-μm nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell) and washed twice with 3 ml of 0.25 m phosphate, pH 6.0. The radioactivity retained on the filter was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The rates of transport are given in pmol/min and per OD650. The Km and Vmax values were derived from iterative nonlinear fits of the theoretical Michaelis equation to the experimental values, using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm as described previously (22Dardel F. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 273-275PubMed Google Scholar). When experimental values could not be fitted to a single hyperbola, a partition method was employed, as recommended (23Burns D.J. Tucker S.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 81: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Km1 and Vmax 1 values were derived from the experimental data obtained for phosphate concentrations ranging from 5 to 50 μm. The theoretical contribution of the first uptake system was subtracted from the subsequent experimental values (100–5000 μm). The resulting data were used to determine Km and Vmax values for the second uptake system. The strains were pregrown overnight as indicated above. The cells were inoculated in phosphate-defined medium to obtain an OD650 of 0.4 and left to grow at 30 °C. When the OD650 reached 1.5, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed with SD medium without phosphate. The cells were resuspended in SD medium without phosphate at a density of 5 OD650/ml and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min prior to the addition of Na2SeO3. For determination of the kinetic parameters for selenite uptake, selenite concentrations were in the range 1–20 mm. At time intervals, 10 ml of cell suspension were removed from the incubation mixture, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold 1 m phosphate, pH 6.0. The samples were centrifuged (5000 × g for 5 min), washed twice with 10 ml of water, and lyophilized. Selenium content of the cells was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP/MS) on a Thermo Fisher PQ Excell quadripole spectrometer in the collision cell mode. The mass of each yeast sample was estimated by the difference of weight between the filled and empty microtubes (microbalance Sartorius ME 36S, range 30 g/1 μg). The yeast samples were digested with 3 ml of HNO3 (67–69%; Plasmapur SGS) and 1 ml of H2O2 (30%; Suprapur Merck) in a closed vessel microwave oven (Ethos 900; Thermo Fisher). The residues were then diluted with 10 ml of pure water. The ICP/MS mass spectrometer was calibrated (range, 0–200 μg/liter) against a reagent blank solution, and several selenium standard solutions were obtained after dilutions from a concentrated certified standard (selenium, 999 ± 5 mg/liter; Certipur Merck). The data were recorded for the four selenium isotopes 76Se, 78Se, 80Se, and 82Se. Selenium concentrations calculated from each isotope were analogous. The results are the means of data obtained on each isotope and are expressed in μg of selenium·g−1 (dry weight). Conversion in pmol·OD650−1 was made using a mean atomic mass of 79 and by considering that 1 g of yeast (dry weight) corresponds to 6200 OD650. The toxicity of selenite in yeast is well documented, although the mechanisms of toxicity are less well understood (24Letavayová L. Vlasáková D. Spallholz J.E. Brozmanová J. Chovanec M. Mutat. Res. 2008; 638: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 25Pinson B. Sagot I. Daignan-Fornier B. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Selenite uptake is the first step in selenium metabolism that ultimately leads to toxicity. To investigate the possibility that selenite enters yeast cells via the orthophosphate transport system, the influence of the concentration of phosphate in the growth medium on the toxicity of sodium selenite was analyzed. We compared the effect of the addition of 5 mm of sodium selenite on the growth of yeast cells (strain BY4742) cultivated in the presence of increasing concentrations of potassium phosphate (SD with 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, or 0.8 mm Pi or standard high Pi SD (7.3 mm Pi)) (Fig. 1A). In the absence of selenite, whatever the concentration of phosphate, growth rates were identical (t½ = 135 min at 30 °C). We observed, however, that in the medium supplemented with 0.1 mm phosphate, upon reaching the late exponential phase, phosphate depletion became limiting for cell growth. In the presence of 5 mm selenite, growth rates and plateau values were clearly dependent on phosphate concentrations. Up to 0.8 mm Pi, the cells were much more affected by selenite toxicity in the medium containing the lowest phosphate concentration. Surprisingly, at high phosphate concentration, selenite toxicity increased. To determine whether this inhibition of growth was due to increased selenite lethality, cell viability was assayed after a short term exposure to selenite. The cells, grown exponentially in medium containing various concentrations of phosphate, were incubated for 1 h in the same medium with 5 or 10 mm selenite, diluted, and plated on rich medium plates (high phosphate). The survival rates were determined by counting colonies after 2 days growth at 30 °C (Fig. 1B). In a medium containing 0.1 mm Pi, exposure to 5 mm selenite reduced cell survival by nearly 90%. In contrast, at 0.4 mm Pi, more than 80% of the cells were resistant to 5 mm selenite. When the phosphate concentration was raised further, viability of the cells decreased to reach ∼50% in high phosphate medium. These results show that selenite not only inhibits the growth of yeast cells but also induces mortality. In a previous paper, we showed that extracellular reduction of selenite into hydrogen selenide (HSe−) led to increased cellular accumulation and toxicity of selenium (26Tarze A. Dauplais M. Grigoras I. Lazard M. Ha-Duong N.T. Barbier F. Blanquet S. Plateau P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8759-8767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To determine whether sodium selenide toxicity was dependent on phosphate concentration, we measured cell survival after a 5-min exposure to 40 μm Na2Se in medium containing increasing concentrations of Pi. This resulted in ∼50% mortality of the cells, independently of phosphate concentration, suggesting that these two forms of inorganic selenium (selenite and selenide) are internalized by different pathways, as suggested previously (27Ganyc D. Self W.T. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Because our sample of sodium selenite might contain traces of selenate, sodium selenate toxicity was also assayed. Exposure to 5 mm selenate resulted in low mortality (<20%), irrespective of phosphate concentration. Thus, the toxicity of selenite cannot originate from trace amounts of selenate contaminating the selenite solution. In a first set of experiments, the toxicity of selenite was analyzed in Pi-limited medium. Viability assays were performed in strains disrupted for one of the phosphate transporter genes (PHO84, PHO87, PHO89, PHO90, and PHO91). The cells were pregrown with increasing Pi concentrations, exposed to 5 mm selenite, plated, and scored to assess cell survival (Fig. 2A). Whatever the concentration of phosphate in the range 0.1–0.8 mm, each of the single mutants in the low affinity carriers (Δpho87, Δpho90, and Δpho91) displayed curves similar to that of the parental strain, with high selenite toxicity at low Pi concentrations. However, a triple mutant Δpho87-Δpho90-Δpho91 was slightly more sensitive to selenite than the wild-type strain. At 0.1 mm Pi, survival was 1.4% for the triple mutant as compared with 15% for wild type. In contrast, the Δpho84 strain was very resistant to selenite toxicity at low Pi concentrations. The Δpho4 strain, in which PHO84 is not expressed, was also very resistant to selenite toxicity at low Pi concentrations. As shown in Fig. 2B, expression, in the Δpho84 strain, of PHO84 from the constitutive ADH1 promoter restored selenite toxicity values close to those observed in the wild type. These results suggest that Pho84p plays a major role in the toxicity of selenite, at least up to 0.4–0.5 mm phosphate. In the case of a Δpho89 strain, the survival curve was similar to that of the wild type. This indicates that, under our experimental conditions, this transporter is not involved in selenite toxicity. However, both the transcription and the activity of Pho89p are strongly pH-dependent, with an optimum pH of >8.0 (13Zvyagilskaya R.A. Lundh F. Samyn D. Pattison-Granberg J. Mouillon J.M. Popova Y. Thevelein J.M. Persson B.L. FEMS Yeast Res. 2008; 8: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Although no effect of the inactivation of its gene was observed, a potential role for Pho89p in selenite toxicity cannot be excluded but must be studied in different conditions. For this reason, this high affinity transporter was not considered in the remainder of our study. The uptake of selenite by BY4742 yeast cells was measured using cells grown in Pi-limited conditions (0.3 mm). The cells were washed and resuspended in SD medium without Pi. The cell suspensions were incubated at 30 °C in the presence of various concentrations of selenite (1–10 mm), and aliquots were removed at various times to measure the amount of total incorporated selenium (Fig. 3A). Cellular accumulation of selenium was linear over a period of at least 10 min. The rate of selenite uptake, as a function of selenite concentration, could be adequately described by the Michaelis-Menten equation, allowing us to derive a Km of 4 ± 1 mm and a Vmax of 67 ± 4 μg of selenium·g−1·min−1 (or 136 pmol of selenium·OD−1·min−1) (Fig. 3B). The rate of selenite uptake, at the selenite concentration of 5 mm, was 76 pmol of selenium·OD−1·min−1 (Table 1). The uptake of 5 mm selenite, by the Δpho84 mutant assayed in the same conditions, was only 11 pmol of selenium·OD−1·min−1, indicating that deletion of PHO84 drastically reduced selenite uptake. These results show that, in Pi-limited conditions, transport of selenite is ensured mostly by Pho84p. In addition, the kinetics of selenite uptake were measured in the presence of 0.5 mm Pi in the uptake medium (Fig. 3B and Table 1). Whatever the selenite concentration, accumulation of selenium was reduced at least 10 times, showing that selenite uptake by Pho84p is inhibited by phosphate.TABLE 1Rates of selenite uptake and inhibition by phosphate of wild-type and Pi transporter-defective strains in the presence of 5 mm selenitePi concentration in the growth mediumStrainV0 mm PiaConcentration of phosphate in the uptake medium.0.5 mm PiaConcentration of phosphate in the uptake medium.pmol of SeO32−·min−1·OD650−10.3 mmBY474276 ± 106.4 ± 17.3 mmBY474227 ± 424 ± 40.3 mmΔpho8411 ± 4ND7.3 mmΔpho8420 ± 4ND0.3 mmΔpho84-Δspl221 ± 4ND7.3 mmΔpho84-Δspl221 ± 3ND7.3 mmΔpho8731 ± 514 ± 47.3 mmΔpho87 (pPHO87)30 ± 426 ± 37.3 mmΔpho8587 ± 1011 ± 2a Concentration of phosphate in the uptake medium.

The rate of phosphate accumulation at concentrations ranging from 5 to 500 μm could be fitted to a single Michaelis-Menten equation, giving a Vmax of 860 pmol of Pi incorporated per min/OD650 and a Km of 20 μm. The Km for Pi uptake is in the micromolar range, suggesting that only high affinity phosphate transport is operative at this phosphate concentration. To support this idea, we compared the rate of phosphate uptake in the wild-type strain and the Δpho84 mutant grown in 0.3 mm Pi, using a phosphate concentration of 0.3 mm in the assay. Rates of 840 and 43 pmol of Pi·OD−1·min−1 were determined, respectively. These results indicate that in the growth conditions used above, Pho84p is the major contributor to phosphate uptake. Kinetic studies were also performed in the presence of 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 mm selenite. The results show that selenite competitively inhibits phosphate uptake by BY4742 cells with a Ki of 4.6 mm (Table 2). It is noteworthy that this value is close to the Km determined for selenite uptake. This is in agreement with the conclusion that the same transporter, Pho84p, is responsible for the major part of the uptake of both phosphate and selenite. In a previous paper (8Pinson B. Merle M. Franconi J.M. Daignan-Fornier B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35273-35280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the authors found that selenite did not compete with phosphate transport. However, they did not go beyond a 10-fold molar excess of selenite, which may not have been enough to observe an effect, because of the large difference of Km for phosphate or selenite transport. We also measured the Ki of selenite toward phosphate uptake in the Δpho87-Δpho90-Δpho91 strain. Experimental conditions were identical to those used above with the wild-type strain. As expected, the Km for phosphate (25 μm) and the Ki for selenite (5.5 mm) were similar to those determined with the BY4742 strain, which confirms that the selenite transport kinetic values determined above correspond to Pho84p-mediated uptake. Transport of selenite by Pho84p cannot explain the increase in selenite toxicity observed with cells grown in high Pi conditions, because Pho84p is not significantly expressed in these conditions (11Bun-Ya M. Nishimura M. Harashima S. Oshima Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3229-3238Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 18Wykoff D.D. Rizvi A.H. Raser J.M. Margolin B. O'Shea E.K. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 1005-1013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In agreement with this idea, when assayed for cell survival after exposure to 5 or 10 mm selenite, the single mutants in the high affinity transporter genes (PHO84 and PHO89), as well as the Δpho4 and Δspl2 strains, grown in high phosphate medium, displayed selenite survival values comparable with those of the wild-type strain (Fig. 4). In contrast, single mutant strains in the low affinity Pi transporters, as well as the double and triple mutants, were more resistant to selenite. An increased resistance of the Δpho87, Δpho90, and Δpho91 mutants has been previously reported by Pinson et al. (8Pinson B. Merle M. Franconi J.M. Daignan-Fornier B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35273-35280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that mutations in the low affinity phosphate transporters resulted in derepression of the PHO-regulated genes (8Pinson B. Merle M. Franconi J.M. Daignan-Fornier B. J. Biol.

Pathogenic bacteria produce a prodigious array of virulence factors in the form of adhesins, toxins, cytoskeleton-manipulating effectors, enzymes, and mediators of motility that are usually secreted across the bacterial cell surface by a variety of simple or complex highly organized secretion mechanisms (1Coburn B.

In doing so, infectious bacteria ensure their ability to survive and multiply within their host. Among the different protein secretion mechanisms described in Gram-negative bacteria, the type 5 protein secretion system is perhaps the simplest of all because it does not require the repertoire of components and sophisticated structures associated with other systems (1Coburn B.

The C terminus contains the β-domain, which forms a β-barrel pore-like structure in the outer membrane through which the passenger domain, corresponding to the mid-portion of the protein, is secreted and can remain associated to the cell surface or be released to the milieu (2Henderson I.R. Navarro-Garcia F. Desvaux M. Fernandez R.C. Ala'Aldeen D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 692-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Members of the family of SPATE (serine protease ATs of the Enterobacteriacea) are proteins from Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Shigella spp., which possess a consensus serine protease motif (2Henderson I.R. Navarro-Garcia F. Desvaux M. Fernandez R.C. Ala'Aldeen D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 692-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). SPATEs are generally large proteins that display an array of distinct biological activities such as adhesins, hemagglutinins, cytotoxins, or enzymes with different substrate specificities (2Henderson I.R.

Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) O157:H7 is a food-borne pathogen implicated as a major cause of diarrheal illness in developed countries. The production of Shiga toxins and colonization of the large intestine are central aspects of the pathogenicity of EHEC strains (5Kaper J.B. Nataro J.P. Mobley H.L. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 123-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (3384) Google Scholar). Cattle are natural hosts of EHEC O157:H7, and they constitute the primary source of infection for humans (5Kaper J.B. Nataro J.P. Mobley H.L. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 123-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (3384) Google Scholar). Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) is a cause of potentially fatal infantile diarrhea in developing countries (5Kaper J.B. Nataro J.P. Mobley H.L. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 123-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (3384) Google Scholar). EPEC and EHEC possess a pathogenicity island termed the locus of enterocyte effacement, which contains a repertoire of genes encoding regulators, the adhesin intimin and its receptor Tir, a type 3 secretion system (T3SS) machinery, and T3 secreted effector molecules, that together with non-locus of enterocyte effacement encoded effectors (Nles), act in concert to confer on the bacteria the ability to adhere and inflict damage to the gut mucosa (5Kaper J.B. Nataro J.P. Mobley H.L. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 123-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (3384) Google Scholar). In addition to the outer membrane adhesin intimin (5Kaper J.B. Nataro J.P. Mobley H.L. Nat.

EspP and EspC are SPATE proteins (>100 kDa) secreted by EHEC and EPEC, respectively, that share significant similarity at their amino acid sequence level and are two of the predominant secreted proteins found in liquid culture supernatants of these organisms (2Henderson I.R. Navarro-Garcia F. Desvaux M. Fernandez R.C. Ala'Aldeen D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 692-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). The EspC protein of EPEC shows considerable homology with the IgA protease of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenza, although it does not display this activity (2Henderson I.R. Navarro-Garcia F. Desvaux M. Fernandez R.C. Ala'Aldeen D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 692-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 11Stein M. Kenny B. Stein M.A. Finlay B.B. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6546-6554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Enterotoxin and cytotoxin activities on rat jejunal segments and cultured epithelial cells have been demonstrated for EspC (12Mellies J.L. Navarro-Garcia F. Okeke I. Frederickson J. Nataro J.P.

Cell Microbiol. 2008; 10: 1975-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Recently, it was also found that EspC conferred enhanced lysozyme resistance to EPEC (16Salinger N. Kokona B. Fairman R. Okeke I.N. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2009; 75: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). EspC and EspP display enzymatic activities, and although EspC cleaves spectrin (also called fodrin) and hemoglobin, EspP of EHEC cleaves pepsin A, and human coagulation factor V (2Henderson I.R.

The EspP protein was also shown to influence gut colonization in calves and contributes to adherence of EHEC to bovine primary rectal cells (20Dziva F. Mahajan A. Cameron P. Currie C. McKendrick I.J. Wallis T.S. Smith D.G. Stevens M.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2007; 271: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Recently, EspP was found to be directly involved in biofilm formation and adherence of EHEC to T84 intestinal epithelial cells (21Puttamreddy S. Cornick N.A. Minion F.C. Infect. Immun. 2010; 78: 2377-2384Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide compelling evidence that EspC and EspP proteins oligomerize into macroscopic rope-like structures that possess cell adhesiveness, exert enzymatic and cytopathic effects, and serve as a substratum for bacterial biofilm formation sheltering the bacteria from external foes. The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S1. The bacteria were cultured in Luria-Bertani broth or in DMEM (Invitrogen) at 37 °C with shaking, unless otherwise stated. When required, antibiotics were added to the medium at the following concentrations: kanamycin at 50 μg/ml, ampicillin at 200 μg/ml, gentamicin at 50 μg/ml, and chloramphenicol at 30 μg/ml. For scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and ultra thin sectioning the ropes were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS and processed for SEM and transmission electron microscopy. Ultrathin longitudinal and transversal sections of ropes were used for structural analysis and immunodetection of EspP with primary rabbit anti-EspP antibodies (produced in this study against purified EHEC EspP) or preimmune sera and anti-rabbit IgG gold-labeled conjugates as previously described (9Xicohtencatl-Cortes J. Monteiro-Neto V. Ledesma M.A. Jordan D.M. Francetic O. Kaper J.B. Puente J.L. Girón J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 3519-3529Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Ropes produced by E. coli in liquid (DMEM) cultures were pulled out and extensively washed by vigorous and repeated vortexing and centrifugation in distilled water to remove bacteria. The ropes were analyzed by conventional SDS-PAGE using 10% polyacrylamide gels or immunoblotting using rabbit anti-EspP serum as primary antibody (1:2,000) and anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugate (1:20,000). A 104-kDa protein identified in the EHEC ropes was excised from polyacrylamide gels and subjected to mass spectrometry analysis after digestion with trypsin. To demonstrate host protein-EspP binding, the immobilized EspP protein derived from the ropes was incubated with fibronectin (5 μg/ml) and reacted with rabbit anti-fibronectin serum (Sigma) (1:20,000) and secondary antibody. Immunoblots were developed with HyGLO chemiluminescent HRP antibody detection reagent (Denville) (9Xicohtencatl-Cortes J. Monteiro-Neto V. Ledesma M.A. Jordan D.M. Francetic O. Kaper J.B. Puente J.L. Girón J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 3519-3529Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Ropes produced by E. coli K-12 DH5α(pB9-5) were subjected to different physical and chemical treatments and then analyzed visually for stability and dissociation. The ropes were treated with proteolytic enzymes proteinase K (0.2–0.8 μg/ml) and trypsin (50 μg/ml), 1–4 m urea, 2–20% SDS, and 0.05–0.5 m Triton X-100 or heated at 40 or 100 °C for 2 h in PBS. We sought to compare the cytotoxic activity of ropes versus EspP monomer. Purification of EspP monomers and ropes is described in the supplemental text. One hundred μg of ropes or purified EspP were incubated with HeLa cell monolayers in high glucose DMEM containing 1% BSA for 2, 4, 6, and 24 h at 37 °C. The supernatants were removed from the wells, and cell lysis was quantified by measuring lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release as outlined by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science). HeLa cells in high glucose DMEM and 1% BSA were used as low control (spontaneous LDH release). Maximum LDH release (high control) was determined by adding 100 μl/well of 2% Triton X-100. For immunofluorescence microscopy, anti-EspP antibodies were added to 2% formalin-fixed samples for 1 h in 10% horse serum followed by the Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibody and then visualized using an Axio Imager1.0 Zeiss microscope as previously described (8Rendón M.A. Saldaña Z. Erdem A.L. Monteiro-Neto V. Vázquez A. Kaper J.B. Puente J.L. Girón J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 10637-10642Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 9Xicohtencatl-Cortes J.

The cytopathic effect exerted by ropes or EspP monomers were compared visually counting the number of rounded HeLa cells under fluorescence microscopy. Different concentrations (two serial fold dilutions starting at 100 μg/ml) of EspP or ropes were incubated for 6 h with monolayers of HeLa cells in a black sterile polystyrene 96-well microplate (Packard). Bound ropes or EspP were detected with anti-EspP antibodies and a secondary antibody labeled with Alexa Flour 488. The fluorescence was read at an excitation of 485 ± 9 nm. To determine whether the ropes shared the enzymatic activity shown by EspP, 30 μg of porcine pepsin A (Sigma) were mixed with 5 μg of EspP or ropes in a total volume of 10 μl of 150 mm PBS (pH 7.6) and incubated at 37 °C for 18 h as previously described (17Brunder W. Schmidt H. Karch H. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 767-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The digestion samples were analyzed by 16% SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Ropes obtained from cultures of EHEC, EPEC, or DH5α(pB9-5) were rinsed gently to remove any loosely associated bacteria and then incubated for 2 h with kanamycin, ampicillin, or gentamicin in triplicate on three different days. The ropes were washed three times with PBS to remove residual antibiotics and then incubated with 1 ml of 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min. Serial dilutions were plated out onto agar plates, and the colony-forming units (1 × 103) were recorded. All of the strains used are sensitive to the antibiotics employed, except for DH5α(pB9-5), which is resistant to kanamycin. We found that macroscopic fibrillar structures are formed by EPEC strain E2348/69 (O127:H6) and EHEC O157:H7 strains EDL933, 86-24, and 85-170 growing with shaking overnight at 37 °C in tissue culture DMEM (supplemental Fig. S1 and Table S1). These fibers could be visualized by the naked eye and pulled out for analysis. When extended on a glass slide they measured up to 2 cm in length and were several microns wide (Fig. 1A). These dimensions are well beyond those of other bacterial filamentous superstructures such as flagella (20 nm wide, 5–10 μm long) (22Giron J.A. Nataro J.P. Colonization of Mucosal Surfaces. ASM Press, Herndon, VA2005: 213-236Google Scholar), type 4 pili (20 μm long), or T3SS needles (12 nm wide and 600 nm to several μm long) (7Girón J.A. Ho A.S. Schoolnik G.K.

We were able to reproducibly see these highly flexible and sticky fibers, albeit of different dimensions on a day-to-day basis (supplemental Fig. S1). SEM analysis at low magnification of the fibers revealed a morphology resembling ropes, which appeared to be composed of hundreds of parallel long flexible filaments, which bundled up to increase the thickness of the ropes (Fig. 2). The bundle of filaments twisted together yielding rope-like structures that torqued forming loops at different sites. The helix handedness of the ropes examined was unambiguously determined by observation of the orientation of the filaments, which appeared to torque in a left-handed orientation forming coiled and supercoiled structures (Fig. 2, A and B). The particular handedness was not due to the rotation orientation (counterclockwise) of our shaking incubator because static growth of large cultures of EPEC or EHEC also produced ropes. Congo Red (CR) and thioflavin T (ThT) dye binding is a general property of highly aggregative and insoluble human amyloid fibers and of a few bacterial amyloidogenic proteins such as curli fibers (25Chapman M.R.

These dyes are believed to specifically interact in some unknown way with the crossed-β-sheet structure common to amyloid structures (28Naiki H. Higuchi K. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar, 30Naiki H. Higuchi K. Matsushima K. Shimada A. Chen W.H. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Lab.

Biol. 2005; 149: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). We found that, like human amyloids, the ropes bound CR dye (Fig. 1A). We compared the absorbance pattern of CR alone versus CR in the presence of ropes between 400 and 700 nm. We found a shift in maximal optical absorbance from 475 (CR alone) to 500 (CR plus ropes) nm (Fig. 1B). This pattern is in agreement with that exhibited by the E. coli curli fibers in the presence of CR (25Chapman M.R. Robinson L.S. Pinkner J.S. Roth R. Heuser J. Hammar M. Normark S. Hultgren S.J. Science. 2002; 295: 851-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). For these experiments, an EPEC curli mutant (E2348/69ΔcsgD) and its derivative complemented strain (E2348/69ΔcsgD(pCP994)), which overproduces curli (33Saldaña Z. Xicohtencatl-Cortes J. Avelino F. Phillips A.D. Kaper J.B. Puente J.L. Girón J.A. Environ. Microbiol. 2009; 11: 992-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. Observation of unstained or CR-stained bacterial ropes under light microscopy also revealed their fibrillar nature (Fig. 1, C and D). We also found that the fluorescent ThT dye associated with ropes in a protein concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1, E and F). After excitation at 450 nm, ThT exhibits a constant fluorescence emission (28Naiki H. Higuchi K. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar, 34LeVine 3rd., H. Protein. Sci. 1993; 2: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1947) Google Scholar). When EspP or ropes were mixed with ThT in suspension, both mixtures exhibited an enhanced fluorescence emission at 482 nm. However, a higher intensity was obtained with the EspP monomers (Fig. 1F). In all, these data indicate that β-sheet structures are present in both the EspP monomers and the ropes. Regarding the nature of the ropes, our first thought was that they were formed by chains of bacteria in tandem. Previous work reported that Bacillus subtilis could form macrofibers composed of biologically active strands of chained bacteria (35Mendelson N.H. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 438-449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, E. coli colonizing the urinary tract can form filamentous chains of bacteria that represent a source of infectious units (36Justice S.S. Hunstad D.A. Seed P.C. Hultgren S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 19884-19889Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In the present study, analysis by high magnification SEM inside the crevices of the EPEC ropes showed a highly organized filamentous substratum with scores of bacteria adhering to it (Fig. 2C). Analysis of longitudinal and transversal thin sections of bacterial ropes by transmission electron microscopy confirmed their stranded and sheeted architecture (Fig. 3, A and B) and that they are not composed of bacteria joined in tandem as in the case of the B. subtilis macrofibers or the filamentous uropathogenic E. coli. The presence of bacteria inside the ropes supports the provoking thought that the ropes could serve also as a biofilm substratum. It was necessary to discriminate the presence of other bacterial superstructures such as flagella, pili, or T3SS needles as components of the newly discovered ropes. Isogenic deletion mutants of EPEC in fliC (flagellin gene), bfpA (type 4 pilin gene), escN (T3SS ATPase gene), espB (T3SS pore-forming protein gene), or espA (T3SS translocon sheath gene), and EHEC EDL933 mutants in fliC and escN retained the ability to form ropes, indicating that rope formation was independent of pili, flagella, EspA or EspB secreted proteins, or T3S (supplemental Table S1). SDS-PAGE analysis of individual EPEC and EHEC ropes showed that these fibers were largely composed in each case of a doublet protein band of 104 kDa (Fig. 4A). The EHEC EspP protein was analyzed by trypsin digestion and mass spectrometry yielding peptide amino acid sequences (KTGEGLVILGAEKTF, VAGMQNTEADAVKQNGNAY, and IDLHAGKNITGDGF) that matched the predicted product of the espP gene. In agreement, the doublet band reacted with anti-EspP antibody by immunoblotting (Fig. 4B). To investigate whether HUS patients develop anti-EspP antibodies, we examined a pool of sera obtained from patients who suffered HUS. The HUS serum clearly reacted with EspP, whereas no reaction was observed with a pool of normal human sera (Fig. 4C). Immuno-EM experiments using rabbit anti-EspP antibody showed labeling along the length of thin sections of the EPEC macrofilaments (Fig. 3C). To provide genetic evidence of the role of EspP or EspC in rope formation, we constructed isogenic deletion mutants in EHEC espP or EPEC espC genes. Ropes were not observed in cultures of EPEC espC or EHEC (EDL933, 86-24, and 85-170) espP mutants. Laboratory strains E. coli K-12 DH5α or HB101, both naturally lacking espC or espP genes, did not produce ropes (supplemental Table S1). Further genetic proof of the nature of the ropes was provided by experiments demonstrating rope formation in DH5α transformed with espP harbored on plasmid pB9-5 (17Brunder W. Schmidt H. Karch H. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 767-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and in the EPEC espC and EHEC espP mutants complemented with pB9-5 (supplemental Table S1). We also found that Citrobacter rodentium, another attaching and effacing organism pathogenic for mice (37Deng W. Puente J.L. Gruenheid S. Li Y. Vallance B.A. Vázquez A. Barba J. Ibarra J.A. O'Donnell P. Metalnikov P. Ashman K. Lee S. Goode D. Pawson T. Finlay B.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 3597-3602Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), produced ropes, whereas the C. rodentium espC mutant was not able to assemble ropes (supplemental Table S1). Rope formation was studied in the presence of anti-EspP antibodies in filtered supernatants containing EspP monomers obtained from overnight cultures of E. coli K-12 DH5α(pB9-5), EHEC EDL933, or EPEC E2348/69 incubated overnight with several dilutions of anti-EspP or preimmune sera. As expected, rope formation was abolished in a dose-dependent manner only in the samples containing anti-EspP antibody and not by the preimmune serum, suggesting that the antibody opsonized the soluble protein monomers blocking rope formation (supplemental Table S2). CD employing different concentrations of purified EspP monomers (Fig. 5A) was used to evaluate the stability of the EspP protein at pH 8.0 and 20 °C using an Aviv 62DS spectropolarimeter. A distinctive CD spectra in the far ultraviolet region between 180 and 260 nm was obtained (Fig. 5D). Low concentrations of EspP (between 0.25 and 0.5 mg/ml) showed one peak at 200–205 nm, suggesting that the protein is present in a random coil structure. However, at higher protein concentrations (between 1.2 and 1.6 mg/ml), a mean molar ellipticity was achieved at 217 and 220 nm, respectively, suggesting conformational changes from a random coil structure to a β-sheet structure, which, as in the case of amyloidogenic proteins, could be important for the structural stability of the protein and for rope assembly. The secondary structure of the EspP passenger domain is predicted to be composed of 57% β-strands, which are likely to form β-sheet-rich intermediate fibrils that assemble into the complex quaternary rope structures. Experiments to determine the stability and resistance of the ropes to different physical and chemical treatments were performed. Similar to human amyloid fibris and curli, the ropes were highly aggregative, sticky, insoluble, and stable in aqueous solutions (including most common buffers at neutral pH) and resistant to vigorous mechanical shearing and disruption (e.g. vortexing or manual shaking). Bacterial ropes proved to be highly resistant to anionic detergents because only 75% dissociation of ropes was observed in 20% SDS, and Triton X-100 had no effect on the ropes (supplemental Table S3). Urea totally dissociated the ropes when used at 4 m, indicating the presence of noncovalent bonds between the monomeric subunits (supplemental Table S3). The ropes were sensitive to trypsin at 150 μg/ml and were highly sensitive to treatment with low concentrations of proteinase K, further proving their proteinaceous nature. The addition of 0.5 m EDTA did not destabilize the ropes; however, the presence of EDTA inhibited rope formation in EspP-containing supernatants, suggesting a role of divalent cations in oligomerization of the EspP subunits into ropes. Finally, the ropes were demonstrated to be thermo-resistant because incubation at 100 °C for 2 h did not disaggregate the structures ("
https://openalex.org/W2085836949,"The amount of RNase R, an important degradative exoribonuclease, increases 3–10-fold under a variety of stress conditions. This elevation is due to posttranslational regulation in which the highly unstable RNase R protein becomes stabilized during stress. Here we identify two components of the trans-translation machinery, transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA) and SmpB, that are responsible for the short half-life of RNase R in exponential phase cells. The absence of either lengthens the half-life of RNase R in vivo >6-fold. SmpB directly interacts with RNase R in vitro and is stimulated by tmRNA. The C-terminal region of RNase R, encompassing its basic region and adjacent S1 domain are required for the interaction; their removal eliminates binding and stabilizes RNase R in vivo. However, the binding of SmpB and tmRNA does not alter RNase R activity. These data define a previously unknown regulatory process in which the stability of an RNase is determined by its interaction with an RNA and an RNA-associated protein. The amount of RNase R, an important degradative exoribonuclease, increases 3–10-fold under a variety of stress conditions. This elevation is due to posttranslational regulation in which the highly unstable RNase R protein becomes stabilized during stress. Here we identify two components of the trans-translation machinery, transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA) and SmpB, that are responsible for the short half-life of RNase R in exponential phase cells. The absence of either lengthens the half-life of RNase R in vivo >6-fold. SmpB directly interacts with RNase R in vitro and is stimulated by tmRNA.

https://openalex.org/W1995890947,"Background Direct cellular contact with stimulated T cells is a potent mechanism that induces cytokine production in human monocytes in the absence of an infectious agent. This mechanism is likely to be relevant to T cell-mediated inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Microparticles (MP) generated by stimulated T cells (MPT) display similar monocyte activating ability to whole T cells, isolated T cell membranes, or solubilized T cell membranes. We previously demonstrated that high-density lipoproteins (HDL) inhibited T cell contact- and MPT-induced production of IL-1β but not of its natural inhibitor, the secreted form of IL-1 receptor antagonist (sIL-1Ra). Methodology/Principal Findings Labeled MPT were used to assess their interaction with monocytes and T lymphocytes by flow cytometry. Similarly, interactions of labeled HDL with monocytes and MPT were assessed by flow cytometry. In parallel, the MPT-induction of IL-1β and sIL-1Ra production in human monocytes and the effect of HDL were assessed in cell cultures. The results show that MPT, but not MP generated by activated endothelial cells, bond monocytes to trigger cytokine production. MPT did not bind T cells. The inhibition of IL-1β production by HDL correlated with the inhibition of MPT binding to monocytes. HDL interacted with MPT rather than with monocytes suggesting that they bound the activating factor(s) of T cell surface. Furthermore, prototypical pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as TNF, IL-6, IL-8, CCL3 and CCL4 displayed a pattern of production induced by MPT and inhibition by HDL similar to IL-1β, whereas the production of CCL2, like that of sIL-1Ra, was not inhibited by HDL. Conclusions/Significance HDL inhibit both MPT binding to monocytes and the MPT-induced production of some but not all cytokines, shedding new light on the mechanism by which HDL display their anti-inflammatory functions."

Although harmless in healthy individuals, E. faecalis has emerged as a major cause of nosocomial infections. In order to better understand the transformation of a harmless commensal into a life-threatening pathogen, we developed a Recombination-based In Vivo Expression Technology for E. faecalis. Two R-IVET systems with different levels of sensitivity have been constructed in a E. faecalis V583 derivative strain and tested in the insect model Galleria mellonella, during growth in urine, in a mouse bacteremia and in a mouse peritonitis model. Our combined results led to the identification of 81 in vivo activated genes. Among them, the ef_3196/7 operon was shown to be strongly induced in the insect host model. Deletion of this operonic structure demonstrated that this two-component system was essential to the E. faecalis pathogenic potential in Galleria. Gene ef_0377, induced in insect and mammalian models, has also been further analyzed and it has been demonstrated that this ankyrin-encoding gene was also involved in E. faecalis virulence. Thus these R-IVET screenings led to the identification of new E. faecalis factors implied in in vivo persistence and pathogenic potential of this opportunistic pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2086346948,"Hsp90 is a ubiquitous, ATP-dependent chaperone, essential for eukaryotes. It possesses a broad spectrum of substrates, among which is the p53 transcription factor, encoded by a tumor-suppressor gene. Here, we elucidate the role of the adenine nucleotide in the Hsp90 chaperone cycle, by taking advantage of a unique in vitro assay measuring Hsp90-dependent p53 binding to the promoter sequence. E42A and D88N Hsp90β variants bind but do not hydrolyze ATP, whereas E42A has increased and D88N decreased ATP affinity, compared with WT Hsp90β. Nevertheless, both of these mutants interact with WT p53 with a similar affinity. Surprisingly, in the case of WT, but also E42A Hsp90β, the presence of ATP stimulates dissociation of Hsp90-p53 complexes and results in p53 binding to the promoter sequence. D88N Hsp90β is not efficient in both of these reactions. Using a trap version of the chaperonin GroEL, which irreversibly captures unfolded proteins, we show that Hsp90 chaperone action on WT p53 results in a partial unfolding of the substrate. The ATP-dependent dissociation of p53-Hsp90 complex allows further folding of p53 protein to an active conformation, able to bind to the promoter sequence. Furthermore, in support of these results, the overproduction of WT or E42A Hsp90β stimulates transcription from the WAF1 gene promoter in H1299 cells. Altogether, our research indicates that ATP binding to Hsp90β is a sufficient step for effective WT p53 client protein chaperoning.

Hsp90 is an abundant protein in cells of all known organisms, with the exception of the Archea kingdom. Although in bacteria its presence is not required for survival (1Bardwell J.C. Craig E.A. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2977-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), yeast and higher eukaryotes are fully dependent on its activity (2Chang H.C. Lindquist S. J. Biol.

In multicellular organisms Hsp90 plays a key role in the activation and stabilization of various protein substrates. Among these are kinases (Raf1, Akt, and Src), telomerase, Rab GDP dissociation inhibitors, glucocorticoid hormone receptors (GR), 3The abbreviations used are: GRglucocorticoid receptorANOVAanalysis of variance. and transcription factors such as the p53 tumor suppressor protein (4Whitesell L.

Hence, modes of interaction and chaperoning may possess both common features and specific differences. glucocorticoid receptor analysis of variance. Hsp90 is functional as a dimer, each monomer consisting of three domains connected with flexible linkers of different length and sequence depending on organism and isoform. The main substrate binding region is proposed to be localized in the middle domain (7Meyer P. Prodromou C. Hu B. Vaughan C. Roe S.M. Panaretou B. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Mol.

Repositioning of the domains of the Hsp90 may be translated into conformational rearrangements of a protein substrate, changing its tertiary structure and exposing buried residues, thus enabling interaction with other proteins and ligands, such as hormones or nucleic acids. Despite the initial controversy on the ATP dependence of Hsp90 (12Jakob U. Scheibel T. Bose S. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10035-10041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), it was unambiguously shown that yeast and human Hsp90 possess an adenine nucleotide binding site localized in the N-terminal part of the protein (13Prodromou C.

Pavletich N.P. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Further studies have revealed that yeast Hsp82 is able to hydrolyze ATP and that changes of amino acids engaged directly in ATP binding (D79N) or Mg2+ ion binding and ATP hydrolysis (E33A) in Hsp82 are lethal (15Panaretou B. Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4829-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Finally, a low intrinsic ATPase activity of human Hsp90β was confirmed (16McLaughlin S.H. Ventouras L.A. Lobbezoo B. Jackson S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 813-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). More recently, crystal structures of full-length Hsp90 from yeast and bacteria were published (17Ali M.M. Roe S.M. Vaughan C.K.

Cell. 2006; 127: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) as well as mammalian Grp96 Hsp90 endoplasmic reticulum homologue (19Dollins D.E. Warren J.J. Immormino R.M. Gewirth D.T. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 41-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Based on these findings a model for chaperoning cycle of Hsp90 was proposed for a bacterial HptG protein (18Shiau A.K. Harris S.F. Southworth D.R. Agard D.A. Cell. 2006; 127: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The model assumes that the ATP hydrolysis is the crucial step in the Hsp90 chaperoning cycle, providing energy for most prominent rearrangements in the Hsp90 protein. In contrast, new studies on conformation dynamics of both HptG (20Graf C. Stankiewicz M. Kramer G. Mayer M.P. EMBO. J. 2009; 28: 602-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and yeast Hsp82 (21Mickler M. Hessling M. Ratzke C. Buchner J. Hugel T. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Biol. 2009; 16: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) demonstrate that severe structural changes of Hsp90 dimers could occur upon ATP binding and are rate-limiting for the nucleotide hydrolysis. This suggests that at least partial influence on the substrate may be evoked before the hydrolysis step. Additionally, the crystallographic data indicate that, although Grp94 is an ATP-hydrolyzing enzyme (23Frey S. Leskovar A. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35612-35620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), the decisive step in Grp94 client protein chaperoning cycle is possibly the ATP binding, rather than hydrolysis (19Dollins D.E. Warren J.J. Immormino R.M. Gewirth D.T. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 41-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In the best studied Hsp90-dependent reaction, where GR is activated for hormone binding, Hsp90 does not work alone. Hsp70 machinery as well as co-chaperones are required for the efficient receptor activation (24Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Exp. Biol. Med. (Maywood). 2003; 228: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). In our previous reports we have established that Hsp90 rescues the WT p53 tumor suppressor protein activity at physiological temperature in a single chaperone reaction. We demonstrated that WT p53 binding to the specific DNA promoter sequence in vitro at physiological temperature is Hsp90- and ATP-dependent and that the p53 transcriptional activity in cells requires Hsp90 (25Walerych D. Kudla G. Gutkowska M. Wawrzynow B. Muller L. King F.W. Helwak A. Boros J. Zylicz A. Zylicz M. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6297-6305Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Muller and co-workers detected the WT p53 DNA binding domain as a minimal region of the protein responsible for Hsp90 interaction, whereas Hsp90 middle and C-terminal domains were proposed to be engaged in p53 binding (11Müller L. Schaupp A. Walerych D. Wegele H. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48846-48854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In the current work we took advantage of the simplicity of the Hsp90-dependent reaction of p53 chaperoning and tested the role of adenine nucleotide in this reaction. We used Hsp90β proteins with changes in single residues, which disturb ATP binding or hydrolysis, to demonstrate that protein substrate binds stably to the nucleotide-free Hsp90β. Binding of ATP, but not its hydrolysis, was required for dissociation of p53-Hsp90β complex, and such a reaction was sufficient to rescue the p53 capability to bind to the promoter sequence in vitro. In accordance, the ability to hydrolyze ATP by an overproduced Hsp90β was not required to increase the p53 activity in cultured cells. Human full-length Hsp90β isoform was cloned from human cDNA library and inserted into pBAD24 plasmid. E42A and D88N changes were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. Hsp90β variants were purified as described for WT Hsp90β (26Walerych D. Olszewski M.B. Gutkowska M. Helwak A. Zylicz M. Zylicz A. Oncogene. 2009; 28: 4284-4294Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Human MBP-Hsp90α was purified, and the tag was removed as described previously (25Walerych D. Kudla G. Gutkowska M.

GroEL D87K trap was overproduced in the BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli strain and purified using ion-exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose beads following heparin and ResQ FPLC columns (Amersham Biosciences). Full-length human p23 protein was overproduced from plasmid pT7p23 in BL21(DE3) E. coli strain by 5-h induction with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed in buffer: 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma) followed by short sonication. The lysate was purified using phenyl-Sepharose and ResQ FPLC columns and dialyzed against the storage buffer: 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 150 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, and 5 mm DTT. Hsp90β variants were incubated at 1 μm concentrations on ice for 30 min in a buffer A (50-μl total): 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm MgCl2, 15 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 0.01% Triton X-100, 20 μm BSA (20-fold excess over Hsp90) and 14 μCi of [α-32P]ATP. Afterward, the whole volume of the mixture was applied onto the nitrocellulose 0.44-μm filter and washed with 30 ml of buffer A. Dry nitrocellulose filters were put into scintillation vials, and the radioactivity was measured using a scintillation counter. The experiment was independently repeated three times. ATPase activity of Hsp90β chaperones was measured as described earlier (25Walerych D. Kudla G. Gutkowska M. Wawrzynow B. Muller L. King F.W. Helwak A. Boros J. Zylicz A. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48836-48845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). A p23 affinity column was prepared by covalent cross-linking of the purified proteins to the CNBr-activated Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) according to the producer's protocol. Roughly 1 mg of the protein was conjugated to 0.5 g of the resin. Free uncoupled groups were blocked by addition of glycine. Pull-down experiments were performed by incubation of 10 μl of the prepared affinity resin with 5 μg of the purified Hsp90 WT or mutant in the buffer: 25 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP. Beads were washed three times in buffer containing 150 mm KCl and eluted with Laemmli SDS-PAGE buffer. Samples were loaded on 10% SDS-PAGE gel, after electrophoresis proteins were visualized by a silver stain. Binding of WT p53 to Hsp90β variants was tested by ELISA, as described previously for p53-Hsp90 interaction in the presence or absence of a nucleotide (25Walerych D. Kudla G. Gutkowska M.

The p53 electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed as described previously (25Walerych D. Kudla G. Gutkowska M. Wawrzynow B. Muller L. King F.W. Helwak A. Boros J. Zylicz A. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48836-48845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), with the modified reaction buffer composition: 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 3 mm DTT. GroEL trap protein was added to selected reactions as indicated, together with the promoter DNA, during the stage of p53 activation for DNA binding. H1299 human p53-null cells were grown to 90% confluence in 6-well plates and transfected by using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) with 5 μg of pcDNA3.1 plasmids carrying WT or E42A/D88N FLAG-HA-tagged Hsp90β coding sequences and with 100 ng of pCMV plasmid carrying the WT p53 gene as indicated. At 24 h post-transfection cells were washed with PBS and scraped from plates in ice-cold IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Cells were lysed by brief sonication, and lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Equal amounts of clarified lysates, as determined by Bradford assay, were incubated with 7 μl of anti-FLAG-agarose beads (Sigma) for 3 h at 4 °C, and subsequently washed three times with IP buffer. Bound proteins were eluted from beads with 30 μl of FLAG peptide (100 ng/μl) in IP buffer. Eluates were resolved in SDS-PAGE system and blotted, and proteins were detected with anti-Hsp90α/β (SPA-846, Stressgen), anti-p53 (rabbit polyclonal, Moravian Biotechnology), and anti-p23 (JJ3, Affinity Bioreagents) primary antibodies and suitable secondary antibodies coupled to HRP. H1299 cells were grown and transfected as described for Hsp90β co-immunoprecipitation with the following vectors: p21-luc, containing Firefly luciferase under WAF1 p53-inducible promoter (350 ng), pCMV-luc with Firefly luciferase under the CMV promoter (350 ng), and pCMV-RL with Renilla luciferase under the CMV promoter (150 ng), along with other vectors required in the experiment: FLAG-HA-pcDNA/FLAG-HA-Hsp90β (5 μg) and pCMV-WTp53 (50 ng). 18-h post transfection cells were detached using trypsin, washed 2× with PBS, and 20% of the cell number was lysed to measure luciferase activity, 80% for the RNA isolation. The luminescence of both luciferases was measured using Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) on the LumiStar Galaxy luminometer (BMG). Promoter activity was calculated by the division of a measured value of the Firefly luciferase activity by the value of Renilla luciferase activity. RNA was isolated, cDNA synthesized, and Real-Time PCR performed for TP53 and GAPDH cDNA as described previously (25Walerych D. Kudla G. Gutkowska M. Wawrzynow B. Muller L. King F.W. Helwak A. Boros J. Zylicz A. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48836-48845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used to detect proteins on Western blot: for Hsp90β, PA-012 (Affinity Bioreagents); for p53, DO-1 (Moravian Biotechnology); and for GAPDH, SC-25778 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To elucidate the role of the adenine nucleotides in the Hsp90β chaperoning cycle we constructed point mutants in human HSP90β coding sequence, which resulted, on the protein level, in amino acid changes: E42A and D88N. The changed residues are strictly conserved in the whole Hsp90 family and correspond to positions Glu-33 and Asp-79 in yeast Hsp82 and Glu-46 and Asp-93 in human Hsp90α. Yeast and human Hsp90α protein variants were described previously to have impaired ATP cycling properties (14Obermann W.M. Sondermann H. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 28Young J.C. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5930-5940Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). By analogy to these results, the E42A variant of human Hsp90β protein was supposed to bind but not hydrolyze ATP, whereas the D88N residue change, to abolish the binding of ATP to Hsp90β. To verify these assumptions the WT and changed Hsp90β proteins were overproduced in E. coli and purified to homogeneity (Fig. 1A). They were properly folded as judged by CD spectrum and mostly dimeric, as judged by size-exclusion chromatography (data not shown). All purified proteins were tested for ATP binding and hydrolysis activities. As shown in Fig. 1B, the E42A variant of Hsp90β binds ATP more efficiently than WT Hsp90β, whereas the binding of ATP by D88N Hsp90β is weaker. The D88N Hsp90β variant still binds ATP more efficiently than BSA (background) probably due to the existence of the second ATP binding site located in the C-terminal domain of Hsp90 (29Söti C. Rácz A. Csermely P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7066-7075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 30Garnier C. Lafitte D. Tsvetkov P.O. Barbier P. Leclerc-Devin J.

Both variants, E42A and D88N, do not catalyze the ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 1C). To confirm that the full-length WT or mutant variants of the Hsp90β chaperone interact with the p23 co-chaperone (31Richter K. Walter S. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 1403-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 32McLaughlin S.H. Sobott F. Yao Z.P. Zhang W. Nielsen P.R. Grossmann J.G. Laue E.D. Robinson C.V. Jackson S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 356: 746-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) in a manner previously described, we prepared affinity column, conjugating p23 to the CNBr-activated resin. We performed an in vitro pulldown experiment to check whether the full-length WT Hsp90β and studied E42A or D88N variants were capable of interacting with p23. In the presence of ATP, E42A Hsp90β interacted with p23 affinity resin more efficiently than WT and D88N Hsp90β. In control experiments, in the absence of ATP, the affinity of all Hsp90 variants to p23 was at a background level (Fig. 1D). These results are in agreement with earlier reports of yeast p23 affinity to the yeast Hsp82 WT/E33A/D79N variants (14Obermann W.M. Sondermann H. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). To monitor the effect of ATP on binding of Hsp90 to the p53 tumor suppressor protein in vitro, we have used a modified ELISA. In the absence of ATP all three proteins, namely WT Hsp90β, E42A Hsp90β, and D88N Hsp90β possessed a similar affinity toward WT p53 (Fig. 2). In all three variants, the presence of ATP shifted the equilibrium toward dissociation of Hsp90β-p53 complex (Fig. 2). The strongest effect was achieved in the case of E42A Hsp90β, suggesting that ATP binding, rather than hydrolysis, was sufficient for releasing of p53 from the Hsp90β complex (Fig. 2). Supporting this hypothesis, the presence of ATP only mildly influenced the binding of p53 to D88N Hsp90β (Fig. 2). In control experiments we confirmed that the preincubation of p53 with Hsp90 variants does not change the results presented in Fig. 2, suggesting that ATP can also disrupt pre-formed p53-Hsp90 complexes (result not shown). The efficient binding of WT p53 to D88N Hsp90β independently of the presence of ATP was additionally supported by results of a glycerol gradient centrifugation (supplemental data) and glutaraldehyde cross-linking experiments (result not shown). To answer the question whether the ATPase of Hsp90β is required for rescue of the in vitro WT p53 activity at the physiological temperature, we performed an EMSA of p53 binding to a WAF1 (p21 encoding gene) promoter sequence, as published before (25Walerych D. Kudla G. Gutkowska M. Wawrzynow B. Muller L. King F.W. Helwak A. Boros J. Zylicz A. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48836-48845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). p53 was able to bind the WAF1 promoter-derived sequence in the absence or presence of Hsp90β at a temperature <35 °C (Fig. 3, A (lane 1) and C (lanes 1–3)). After 1-h incubation at 37 °C, p53 was not able to bind to the promoter sequence (Fig. 3A, lane 2) unless WT Hsp90 α or β and at least 3 mm ATP concentration was present (Fig. 3, A (lanes 3 and 4) and B (lanes 1–3 and 10–13)). In the case of E42A Hsp90β, which can efficiently bind, but not hydrolyze ATP, a lower concentration of ATP (1–2 mm) was sufficient to allow chaperoning of the binding of p53 to the promoter-derived sequence (Fig. 3B, lanes 4–6 and 14–17). In contrast, the D88N Hsp90β protein, in the presence or absence of ATP, retained only traces of chaperoning activity toward WT p53 (Fig. 3, A (lane 6) and B (lanes 7–9)). Surprisingly, at heat-shock conditions (40 °C) and with a presence of 5 mm ATP, the E42A Hsp90β variant exhibited more pronounced chaperone activity toward WT p53 than WT Hsp90β (Fig. 3C). In accordance, the R249S oncogenic p53 variant, which is unable to bind WAF1 sequence already at >20 °C (26Walerych D. Olszewski M.B. Gutkowska M. Helwak A. Zylicz M. Zylicz A. Oncogene. 2009; 28: 4284-4294Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), was partially reactivated in vitro by E42A and not by WT Hsp90β at 37 °C (Fig. 3D). These data suggest that the in vitro rescue of p53 activity from thermal inactivation by Hsp90β is dependent mainly on the ATP binding to Hsp90β and may be increased by reducing the Hsp90β ATPase activity. Notably, we do not observe any additional supershift when Hsp90β is present in the reaction mixture, suggesting that p53 dissociates completely from Hsp90β complex upon interacting with the promoter sequence. In control experiments we found that the presence of anti-Hsp90 IgGs (SPA-842 and SPA-846, Stressgen) does not supershift the p53-promoter complex (result not shown). As shown in Fig. 2, the presence of ATP is sufficient to shift the equilibrium toward dissociation of p53-Hsp90β complex that allows formation of the specific p53-DNA complex. A passive, “holdase,” mode of Hsp90 action should be diminished in the presence of ATP, which stimulates the dissociation of p53-Hsp90 complexes (Fig. 2). However, the ATP binding is required for efficient chaperone activity of Hsp90, which facilitates p53 binding to the promoter sequence at 37 °C (Fig. 3). This potential discrepancy needs to be resolved. An attractive hypothesis is that Hsp90 is also an active chaperone, that similarly to Hsp100 binds to client proteins, partially unfolds them, and, in the presence of ATP, dissociates, allowing for a spontaneous folding of the client protein to its active conformation (33Wawrzynow A. Banecki B. Zylicz M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 895-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis we used a GroEL D87K trap protein (34Weber-Ban E.U. Reid B.G. Miranker A.D. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), which irreversibly binds to unfolded protein intermediates. Increasing concentration of the GroEL trap, added during the specific DNA binding by WT p53, efficiently inhibits Hsp90-dependent binding of p53 to the promoter sequence at 37 °C (Fig. 3E). This suggests that partially unfolded WT p53 intermediates are released from Hsp90. The effect of the GroEL trap is not pronounced when the reaction is carried out in the absence of Hsp90 at lower temperatures, such as 17 °C (Fig. 3F). A moderate inhibition of p53 binding to the promoter sequence at 17 °C by the GroEL trap is likely due to the presence of intrinsically unfolded regions of p53 (35Bell S. Klein C. Müller L. Hansen S. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 917-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). We used a p53-null, H1299 human lung carcinoma cell line to verify the interaction of p53 with Hsp90 variants in a cell system. We have transiently overproduced FLAG-HA tagged variants of Hsp90β together with WT p53. The suitability of cell-transfected system for this study was ensured by showing the interaction of p23 protein exclusively with E42A Hsp90β mutant (Fig. 4). This is in line with in vitro experiments (Fig. 1) and previously published data on yeast Hsp82 (36Millson S.H. Truman A.W. King V. Prodromou C. Pearl L.H. Piper P.W. Eukaryot Cell. 2005; 4: 849-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Results presented in Fig. 4 show that p53 co-immunoprecipitates most efficiently with Hsp90β D88N and to a lesser extent with WT and E42A variants. Enhanced binding of p53 to Hsp90β D88N most probably reflects a diminished dynamics of such interaction in an ATP-containing lysate as compared with p53-WT Hsp90β or E42A interactions. It is in agreement with in vitro WT p53-Hsp90β interaction results in the presence of ATP (Fig. 2). The p53 transcriptional activity in H1299 cells was monitored by a co-transfection of a limiting amount of WT p53 vector (2× less WT p53-encoding vector than in co-immunoprecipitation experiments, see “Experimental Procedures”) and with the vector containing Firefly luciferase gene under the control of the WAF1 promoter. E42A Hsp90β overexpression up-regulated the WT p53 transcriptional activity more efficiently than WT Hsp90β (Fig. 5A). D88N Hsp90β, similarly to in vitro experiments, retained a positive p53 activity regulation when compared with controls, suggesting that a part of the influence of Hsp90 on WT p53 may be exerted by a passive, ATP-independent chaperone mechanism. The increase in the Firefly luciferase activity by E42A Hsp90β was not caused by the direct chaperoning of luciferase (Fig. 5B). Described effects were also not caused by p53 mRNA level differences as tested by real-time PCR (Fig. 5C), or difference in Hsp90β level after overexpression, as shown by Western blots (Fig. 5D). However, the limiting amount of overexpressed WT p53, which allowed us to observe p53 activity differences, revealed that Hsp90β variants increased the amount of WT p53 protein (Fig. 5D). This suggested that Hsp90β may act on p53 stability. It has been demonstrated earlier that a transient overproduction of Hsp90 increases WT p53 level in U2OS cells (37Sasaki M. Nie L. Maki C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 14626-14634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The Hsp90 ATPase cycle has been extensively studied (15Panaretou B. Prodromou C. Roe S.M.

https://openalex.org/W1982597689,"Traits that influence reproductive success and contribute to reproductive isolation in animal and plant populations are a central focus of evolutionary biology. In the present study we used an experimental approach to demonstrate the occurrence of environmental effects on sexual and asexual reproduction, and provide evidence for sexual plasticity and inter-clonal fertilization in laboratory-cultured lines of the sea anemone Aiptasia diaphana. We showed that in A. diaphana, both asexual reproduction by pedal laceration, and sexual reproduction have seasonal components. The rate of pedal laceration was ten-fold higher under summer photoperiod and water temperature conditions than under winter conditions. The onset of gametogenesis coincided with the rising water temperatures occurring in spring, and spawning occurred under parameters that emulated summer photoperiod and temperature conditions. In addition, we showed that under laboratory conditions, asexually produced clones derived from a single founder individual exhibit sexual plasticity, resulting in the development of both male and female individuals. Moreover, a single female founder produced not only males and females but also hermaphrodite individuals. We further demonstrated that A. diaphana can fertilize within and between clone lines, producing swimming planula larvae. These diverse reproductive strategies may explain the species success as invader of artificial marine substrates. We suggest that these diverse reproductive strategies, together with their unique evolutionary position, make Aiptasia diaphana an excellent model for studying the evolution of sex."

Excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) 6The abbreviations used are: EAATexcitatory amino acid transporterCFPcerulean fluorescent proteinYFPyellow fluorescent proteinFMPfluorescence membrane potentialERendoplasmic reticulumTMtransmembrane. are high-affinity, sodium-dependent glutamate carriers from solute carrier family 1 (SLC1). Five EAATs have been cloned from animal and human tissue. EAAT1 (SLC1A3; GLAST in rodents) and EAAT2 (SLC1A2; GLT1) are primarily expressed in astroglia (1Danbolt N.C. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 1-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3800) Google Scholar). Overall, EAAT2 is responsible for most of the glutamate transport in the adult brain (1Danbolt N.C. Prog.

The amino acid sequence of an aspartate transporter from Pyrococcus horikoshii (GltPh) is 36% homologous to EAAT2; many residues implicated in glutamate binding and transport are highly conserved (up to 90%) between all EAATs (3Boudker O.

The crystal structure of GltPh is a trimer in which each protomer comprises eight α-helical transmembrane domains and two helical hairpins (5Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that transmembrane domains, TM3, -6, -7, and -8, together with the two helical hairpins, HP1 and HP2, are essential for substrate translocation from the extracellular side into the cell. The first transmembrane segments, TM1, -2, -4, and -5, form the trimerization domain and provide stability to counterbalance the movements of the transport domains (3Boudker O. Ryan R.M. Yernool D.

Alternative splicing of 5′ untranslated regions produces four different potential N termini (8Münch C. Ebstein M. Seefried U. Zhu B. Stamm S. Landwehrmeyer G.B. Ludolph A.C. Schwalenstöcker B.

Wiessner M. Sullivan R. Lee A. Pow D.V. Neurochem. Int. 2004; 45: 1095-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). One of these, GLT1b, was first described in liver and brain from mice. When expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes it showed similar glutamate concentration dependence profiles to GLT-1 (EC50 32 μm). EAAT2b is only expressed in brain astrocytic processes, not in neurons, although some neuronal expression occurs in retina (11Sullivan R. Rauen T. Fischer F. Wiessner M. Grewer C. Bicho A. Pow D.V. Glia. 2004; 45: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Holmseth et al. (12Holmseth S. Scott H.A. Real K. Lehre K.P. Leergaard T.B. Bjaalie J.G. Danbolt N.C.

They showed that overall GLT1b expression was much lower than GLT1 expression in the hippocampus. Besides diverse C and N termini, exon-skipping splice variants of EAAT2 have been described in brain tissue samples (Table 1): exon 7 deletion (EAAT2Δ7; Ref. 13Honig L.S. Chambliss D.D. Bigio E.H.

EAAT2Δ9 lacks parts of the glutamate translocation site. Expression of EAAT2Δ7 or EAAT2Δ9 (alone) in X. laevis oocytes or HEK293 cells generates protein that is expressed at the cell surface, but in both cases the proteins were non-functional (16Scott H.A. Gebhardt F.M. Mitrovic A.D. Vandenberg R.J. Dodd P.R. Neurobiol. Aging. 2010; (in press)doi: 10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2010.03.008Google Scholar). A splice variant of EAAT1, EAAT1Δ9, has also been described. It lacks the region homologous to that missing in EAAT2Δ9; expression of EAAT1Δ9 alone in HEK293 cells generates protein that is also unable to transport glutamate. HEK293 cells co-transfected with equal amounts of EAAT1wt and EAAT1Δ9 showed 44% lower glutamate uptake than cells transfected with EAAT1wt alone (17Vallejo-Illarramendi A. Domercq M. Matute C. J. Neurochem. 2005; 95: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Because there are many EAAT2 splice variants, and a trimeric complex appears to be required for the transporter to be functional, the question may be raised whether variants form homomeric or heteromeric structures. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments have shown that N- and C-terminal variants of GLT1 can associate with each other, in both homomers and heteromers, but will not associate with EAAT1 (18Peacey E. Miller C.C. Dunlop J. Rattray M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2009; 75: 1062-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 19van Eersel J. Mitrovic A.D. Vandenberg R.J. Proc. Aust. Neurosci. Soc. 2006; 17: 80Google Scholar). It is not known whether EAAT2Δ7 or EAAT2Δ9 are able to form complexes. Here we show that EAAT2 exon splice variants can form heteromeric complexes when co-transfected with either EAAT2wt or EAAT2b and that glutamate-dependent voltage changes are contingent on the ratio of splice variant to EAAT2wt or EAAT2b. Plasmids encoding EAAT2 and each variant were inserted into pcDNA 3.1 mammalian expression vectors (Invitrogen). EAAT2wt and the various splice variants were tagged with cerulean fluorescent protein (CFP) or yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) at either the carboxyl or amino terminus. For the carboxyl-terminal tags, the stop codons of EAAT2wt-pcDNA3.1 and each EAAT2variant-pcDNA3.1 cDNA were removed by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit, Stratagene; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). XbaI restriction enzyme sites were introduced by mutagenesis at the 5′ or 3′ termini of both CFP and YFP cDNA. The EAAT2wt-pcDNA3.1 and EAAT2variant-pcDNA3.1 cDNAs were linearized with XbaI (Promega) and ligated with either CFP or YFP cDNA using a Fast-LinkTM DNA Ligation Kit (Epicenter Biotechnologies, Madison, WI). For amino-terminal tags, KpnI restriction enzyme sites were introduced at the 5′ or 3′ termini of CFP and YFP and ligated with KpnI-linearized EAAT2wt-pcDNA3.1 or EAAT2variant-pcDNA3.1 cDNA using a Fast-Link Kit (Epicenter). For Western blot analysis and imaging, 5 × 105 cells/well were aliquoted in 6-well plates. After 24 h they were transfected with 0.25–5 μg of plasmid encoding EAAT2wt or EAAT2 splice variants using a calcium phosphate precipitation protocol (20Kingston R.E. Chen C.A. Rose J.K. Curr. Protoc. Mol. Biol. 2003; 9.1: 1-11Google Scholar). For electrophysiology, 1 × 105 cells were plated on coverslips in single well dishes and co-transfected with 0.25–5 μg of plasmid encoding EAAT2wt or EAAT2 variants and 0.25 μg of eGFP-IRES (Stratagene). 12 h after transfection cells were washed twice with PBS and maintained in 2 ml of DMEM, 10% Serum Supreme (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and used for electrophysiology studies 24 h after transfection. For FRET experiments, HEK293 cells were plated on 24-well glass-bottom culture plates coated with poly-d-lysine (MatTek, Ashland, MA) at 5 × 104 cells/well. Cells were transfected at a 1:2 ratio of cDNA encoding EAAT2 tagged with CFP (0.1 μg of plasmid DNA) and EAAT2 tagged with YFP (0.2 μg of plasmid DNA). Control experiments were conducted on cells transfected with 0.1 μg of CFP-tagged DNA and 0.2 μg of pcDNA3.1 vector DNA. A total of 0.3 μg of DNA was transfected with FuGENE HD (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions in serum-free DMEM (Invitrogen). Medium was replaced with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 48 h. The cells were allowed to grow for a further 24–48 h before imaging. Prior to imaging DMEM was aspirated and cells were washed twice with Leibovitz's L-15 medium (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were washed twice with PBS, scraped off into 1 ml of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2.5 mm Na4P2O7, 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, and Complete Mini Protease Inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), incubated for 15 min on ice, and dispersed with an ultrasonic pulse for 20 s. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C to remove cellular debris. Protein concentration in the supernatants was determined by the Bradford (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) method. Samples were stored at −80 °C until use. Cell surface expression was performed with the Pierce Cell Surface protein isolation kit (Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, transfected HEK293 cells were grown in T75 flasks to 80% confluence, rinsed once with ice-cold PBS, then incubated with Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin for 1 h at 4 °C on a rocking platform. The biotinylation reaction was quenched to stop the labeling. Cells were washed twice with TBS and lysed on ice by ultrasonic homogenization pulses for 3 × 10 s. Cellular debris was deposited by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. Labeled proteins were bound to an immobilized NeutrAvidin Gel. Proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer (5% (v/v) glycerol, 1.7% (w/v) SDS, 2.5% (w/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% (w/v) bromphenol blue in 58 mm Tris, pH 8.5). For Western blotting, total protein samples of human cortex were prepared as follows. Pieces were excised from frozen tissue blocks on a freezing stage, thawed in 0.32 m sucrose solution held at 37 °C, immediately transferred to a tared beaker of ice-cold 0.32 m sucrose, and weighed. Each tissue piece was transferred to 10 volumes of ice-cold water and dispersed using a motor-driven Teflon-glass homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were measured using the Lowry (22Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) method. Aliquots (1 ml) were stored at −80 °C. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 9% acrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-FL membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Membranes were blocked with either 1% BLOTTO/PBST or 0.5% fish skin gelatin/PBST for 1 h, then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies at concentrations as designated below. EAAT2-specific antibody B493 kindly provided by Dr. N. C. Danbolt was raised against residues 493–508 of EAAT2wt. Rabbit anti-p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) was used at a dilution of 1:1000. Monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (Sigma) was used at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. Secondary Alexa Fluor® 680 goat anti-rabbit antibody (Invitrogen) was used at a concentration of 0.1 μg/ml. Membranes were scanned using the LI-COR Odyssey® scanner with Odyssey software 3.0 (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). This was performed using a Nikon Confocal Microscopy system (C1) equipped with a high-speed Lifetime Imaging Module consisting of a pulsed 440-nm laser and a high-speed gated detection system (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY). To ensure that only the CFP signal is detected, a 470 ± 20-nm bandpass emission filter is placed in the detection pathway. Experiments were conducted at 37 °C on a heated stage. All images were taken using a ×60 water objective (Numerical aperture = 1.4). Images were collected at 256 × 256 pixel resolution and regions of interest at the cell surface were chosen that had photon counts greater than 500 photons/pixel for Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy analysis. Analysis was conducted using the Nikon C1 speed Lifetime Imaging Module software. Transfected cells were transferred to transparent 384-well plates at 4 × 103 cells/well. After 16–24 h the medium was aspirated and cells were washed with 25 μl of Ringer solution (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4). A mixture of 10 μl of Ringer solution and 15 μl of blue fluorescence membrane potential (FMP) assay dye (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) was added to each well and the plate incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Plates were placed onto a motorized stage (Prior ProScan II, Prior Scientific Instruments, Cambridge, UK) of an Olympus IX51 inverted microscope and cells were imaged using a ×10 objective (UPlanFln, NA 0.30, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Fluorescence was collected by a CCD camera (coolSNAP monochrome cf/Ol, Olympus). Liquid handling was performed with an LC PAL autosampler (CTC Analytics, Zwingen, Switzerland) using a 100-ml syringe. A suite of labView 7.1 and 8.2.1 (National Instruments, Dublin, Ireland) software routines written in the laboratory were used for hardware control and image acquisition. Automated image analysis was performed with a modified version of DetecTiff® image analysis software (23Gilbert D.F. Meinhof T. Pepperkok R. Runz H. J. Biomol. Screen. 2009; 14: 944-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Two pictures were acquired per well, the first in 25 μl of FMP assay solution and the second 24 s after the addition of 25 μl of substrate in Ringer solution. For concentration-response assessment, each substrate was assayed in triplicate. Each experiment was repeated independently at least three times on different days. All experiments were carried out at room temperature (20–22 °C). Cells were visualized using an inverted fluorescent microscope and voltage clamped at −50 mV. An Axopatch one-dimensional amplifier with pCLAMP 10.2 software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) was used to record whole cell membrane currents. During recordings cells were perfused by a control solution containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. Patch pipettes were fabricated from borosilicate hematocrit tubing (Vitrex Medical A/S, Herlev, Denmark) and heat polished. Pipettes had a tip resistance of 1–2 MΩ when filled with pipette solution, which contained 160 mm KSCN, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, pH adjusted to 7.3 with KOH. The cells were perfused by gravity-fed solutions through a parallel array of microtubular barrels. Results were expressed as mean ± S.E. of three or more independent experiments. Glutamate concentration-response relationships were fitted with following equation:F=Fbasal+Fmax/(1+EC50/[S])Hill Slope(Eq. 1) where F is the fluorescence corresponding to substrate concentration S, Fbasal is the initial (control) fluorescence value, Fmax is the maximum fluorescence, and EC50 is the substrate concentration that elicits a half-maximal response. A similar equation was used to calculate the IC50 for inhibition. For electrophysiology, fluorescence (F) was substituted by current (I) in the formula above. All curves were fitted by non-linear regression using Prism version 5.0b for Macintosh (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Statistical significance was determined by paired Student's t tests, or by analysis of variance with appropriate post hoc tests where indicated. Western blot analysis was carried out using a pan-EAAT2 primary antibody on HEK293 cells expressing EAAT2wt and EAAT2 splice variants. It may be seen (Fig. 1) that EAAT2wt, EAAT2b, and each splice variant were translated into protein. Several immunoreactive bands were detected for EAAT2wt and EAAT2b, including a band at ∼75 kDa and bands at higher molecular mass of ∼100 and ∼150 kDa. The latter bands correspond to homodimers and homotrimers. Samples from human cerebral cortex and EAAT2wt not only showed a 75-kDa band but also a band at ∼55 kDa that may represent intracellular unglycosylated EAAT2wt. EAAT2Δ7 and EAAT2Δ9 showed a major band at ∼50–58 kDa, but only EAAT2Δ9 showed bands at high molecular mass, which suggests that EAAT2Δ9 is able to form homotrimers but that EAAT2Δ7 is unable to do so. Expression analysis of EAAT2wt and splice variants at the surface of HEK293 cells was performed. Transfected cells were surface biotinylated and proteins were isolated by column purification. Samples were immunoblotted and proteins were detected with the same antibody used for total protein visualization. EAAT2wt, EAAT2b, and EAAT2Δ9 were all found to be expressed both intracellularly and at the cell surface (Fig. 1A). In contrast, EAAT2Δ7 protein was not expressed at the cell surface when it was transfected alone. Co-expression of EAAT2Δ7 with EAAT2wt enabled the complex to be transported to the cell surface. To check on cytoplasmic protein contamination of the membrane fraction, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with GFP and EAAT2wt and cell-surface proteins were isolated. Fractions were blotted for EAAT2 and GFP: no GFP labeling was found in the cell-surface fraction (Fig. 1A, lane 10). As a more thorough check for cytoplasmic proteins, samples were probed with anti-ERK1/2 antibody. No ERK1/2 labeling was found in the cell-surface fractions (Fig. 1B). Co-expression of EAAT2wt and increasing amounts of EAAT2Δ7 or EAATΔ9 were tested (Fig. 1C). EAAT2wt expression did not change as the amount of splice variant increased, suggesting that the latter did not inhibit EAAT2wt translation. FRET was used to investigate the association of EAAT2 protomers with various splice variants in membrane complexes. CFP and YFP cDNAs were subcloned at the 5′ and 3′ ends of EAAT2wt and the above mentioned splice variant cDNAs to generate C or N termini-tagged transporters. We measured the fluorescence lifetime of the donor fluorophore, CFP, in the presence and absence of the acceptor fluorophore, YFP, as an indicator of FRET. Fluorescence lifetime can only be reduced when the two fluorophores are in close proximity (24Sitte H.H. Farhan H. Javitch J.A. Mol. Interv. 2004; 4: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Baseline CFP lifetime values were determined from cells transfected with EAAT2wt or EAAT2 variants tagged with CFP only. Differences from baseline were calculated for cells co-transfected with CFP-tagged and YFP-tagged protomers. As a positive control, cells were transfected with a tandem YFP-CFP construct, which generated a maximal decrease in CFP lifetime (Fig. 2A). A negative control comprised CFP-tagged EAAT2wt co-transfected with YFP-tagged glycine transporter GLYT1. These transporters do not associate at the cell surface (25Haugeto O. Ullensvang K. Levy L.M.

Aschrafi A. Schmalzing G. Betz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 1448-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The CFP lifetime of tagged EAAT2wt was not altered significantly by the presence of the YFP-tagged GLYT1 (Fig. 2A). Fluorescence signals from EAAT2wt or EAAT2b were only detected at the cell membrane. For EAAT2Δ7 and EAAT2Δ9 some intracellular fluorescence was seen (Fig. 2C). However, FRET measurements were only taken from regions located at the surface of cells. In cells co-transfected with YFP-EAAT2wt and CFP-EAAT2wt there was a marked and significant reduction in CFP fluorescence lifetime that did not differ significantly from the tandem CFP-YFP positive control (Fig. 2A). The reduction did not differ significantly irrespective of whether both the fluorescent protein tags were located at either the C or N terminus of EAAT2wt, or if one tag was at the C terminus and other at the N terminus (Fig. 2A). YFP-EAAT2b co-expressed with CFP-EAAT2b gave a similar reduction in CFP fluorescence lifetime (Fig. 2A). Tests were not done on co-expressed EAAT2b constructs with fluorophore proteins at opposite ends (Fig. 2A). When EAAT2wt, tagged either with CFP or YFP, was co-expressed with EAAT2b carrying the alternate tag, CFP fluorescence lifetime did not differ significantly from the positive control (Fig. 2A). The reduction in CFP fluorescence lifetime was equally strong whether the tags were at the same or opposite termini of the amino acid sequence of either transporter (Fig. 2A). These observations confirm that EAAT2wt and EAAT2b can form both homomeric and heteromeric complexes. Co-expression of tagged EAAT2wt with either EAAT2Δ7 or EAAT2Δ9 tagged with the complementary fluorophore protein significantly decreased CFP fluorescence lifetimes, which suggests that these transporter variant combinations can associate to form heteromeric complexes (Fig. 2A). Tags at the same terminus (N or C) of EAAT2wt and EAAT2Δ9 gave CFP fluorescence lifetime values that did not differ significantly from the positive control. With tags at opposite termini of EAAT2wt and EAAT2Δ9, the reductions in CFP lifetime were significantly less than those with the positive control, although still significantly different from baseline and from the negative control (Fig. 2A). That is, the location of the tags influenced the efficiency of FRET for EAAT2wt/EAAT2Δ9 combinations. Co-transfections of EAAT2wt and EAAT2Δ7 gave the smallest fluorescence lifetime changes. Tags at the same ends of the protein (C terminus) generated changes in CFP fluorescence lifetimes that were not significantly different from baseline and significantly less than the positive control (Fig. 2A). However, when the tags were at the opposite ends of these proteins (CFP on EAAT2wt C-terminal and YFP on EAAT2Δ7 N-terminal), the change in CFP fluorescence lifetime values were significantly different from baseline (Fig. 2A). We characterized the functional properties of EAAT2 co-expressed with various EAAT2 splice variants using a FMP dye and also by electrophysiological analysis. The FMP dye has been used previously with expressed EAATs, glycine receptors, and voltage-gated K+ channels (27Baxter D.F. Kirk M. Garcia A.F. Raimondi A. Holmqvist M.H. Flint K.K. Bojanic D.

Glutamate transport is coupled to the transport of three Na+ ions and one proton and the countertransport of one K+ ion. This results in the transfer of two positive charges into the cell with each transport cycle, causing depolarization that may be monitored as an increase in fluorescence. Jensen et al. (28Jensen A.A. Bräuner-Osborne H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 67: 2115-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) showed that EAAT2wt-transfected HEK293 cells gave highly similar Km values in FMP assays, d-[3H]aspartate transport assays, and electrophysiology studies. Glutamate applied to HEK293 cells transiently transfected with EAAT2wt generated concentration-dependent increases in fluorescence, reflecting depolarization of the cells (Fig. 3). The responses were fitted to a non-linear Hill equation over a range of time points (Fig. 3). The fluorescence reached steady state at ∼24 s and the EC50 (33.4 ± 1.3 μm) and Hill slope values (1.1 ± 0.1) for glutamate-induced depolarization at this time point conformed well to values obtained with other assays (30Arriza J.L.

Increasing the amount of EAAT2wt cDNA used in the transfection did not significantly alter EC50, Hill slope, or Fmax values (Table 2).

https://openalex.org/W2018245598,"Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1)-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) is likely neuroinflammatory in origin, believed to be triggered by inflammatory and oxidative stress responses to cytokines and HIV protein gene products such as the HIV transactivator of transcription (Tat). Here we demonstrate increased messenger RNA for nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) family member, transcription factor RelB, in the brain of doxycycline-induced Tat transgenic mice, and increased RelB synthesis in Tat-exposed microglial cells. Since genetic ablation of RelB in mice leads to multi-organ inflammation, we hypothesized that Tat-induced, newly synthesized RelB inhibits cytokine production by microglial cells, possibly through the formation of transcriptionally inactive RelB/RelA complexes. Indeed, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) production in monocytes isolated from RelB deficient mice was significantly higher than in monocytes isolated from RelB expressing controls. Moreover, RelB overexpression in microglial cells inhibited Tat-induced TNFα synthesis in a manner that involved transcriptional repression of the TNFα promoter, and increased phosphorylation of RelA at serine 276, a prerequisite for increased RelB/RelA protein interactions. The Rel-homology-domain within RelB was necessary for this interaction. Overexpression of RelA itself, in turn, significantly increased TNFα promoter activity, an effect that was completely blocked by RelB overexpression. We conclude that RelB regulates TNFα cytokine synthesis by competitive interference binding with RelA, which leads to downregulation of TNFα production. Moreover, because Tat activates both RelB and TNFα in microglia, and because Tat induces inflammatory TNFα synthesis via NF-κB, we posit that RelB serves as a cryoprotective, anti-inflammatory, counter-regulatory mechanism for pathogenic NF-κB activation. These findings identify a novel regulatory pathway for controlling HIV-induced microglial activation and cytokine production that may have important therapeutic implications for the management of HAND."
https://openalex.org/W1987085742,"Background Excessive release of chelatable zinc from excitatory synaptic vesicles is involved in the pathogenesis of selective neuronal cell death following transient forebrain ischemia. The present study was designed to examine the neuroprotective effect of a membrane-permeable zinc chelator, clioquinol (CQ), in the CA1 region of the gerbil hippocampus after transient global ischemia. Methodology/Principal Findings The common carotid arteries were occluded bilaterally, and CQ (10 mg/kg, i.p.) was injected into gerbils once a day. The zinc chelating effect of CQ was examined with TSQ fluorescence and autometallography. Neuronal death, the expression levels of caspases and apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) were evaluated using TUNEL, in situ hybridization and Western blotting, respectively. We were able to show for the first time that CQ treatment attenuates the ischemia-induced zinc accumulation in the CA1 pyramidal neurons, accompanied by less neuronal loss in the CA1 field of the hippocampus after ischemia. Furthermore, the expression levels of caspase-3, -9, and AIF were significantly decreased in the hippocampus of CQ-treated gerbils. Conclusions/Significance The present study indicates that the neuroprotective effect of CQ is related to downregulation of zinc-triggered caspase activation in the hippocampal CA1 region of gerbils with global ischemia."
https://openalex.org/W2070071446,"Chromosomal translocations are a primary biological response to ionizing radiation (IR) exposure, and are likely to result from the inappropriate repair of the DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) that are created. An abundance of repetitive sequences in eukaryotic genomes provides ample opportunity for such breaks to be repaired by homologous recombination (HR) between non-allelic repeats. Interestingly, in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae the central strand exchange protein, Rad51 that is required for DSB repair by gene conversion between unlinked repeats that conserves genomic structure also suppresses translocation formation by several HR mechanisms. In particular, Rad51 suppresses translocation formation by single-strand annealing (SSA), perhaps the most efficient mechanism for translocation formation by HR in both yeast and mammalian cells. Further, the enhanced translocation formation that emerges in the absence of Rad51 displays a distinct pattern of genetic control, suggesting that this occurs by a separate mechanism. Since hypomorphic mutations in RAD51 in mammalian cells also reduce DSB repair by conservative gene conversion and stimulate non-conservative repair by SSA, this mechanism may also operate in humans and, perhaps contribute to the genome instability that propels the development of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2055727067,"Pyk2 was identified as a Ca(2+)-dependent kinase, however, the regulation of Pyk2 by Ca(2+) in T cells remains controversial. We found that Ca(2+) mobilization preferentially induced Pyk2 phosphorylation in cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Furthermore, Pyk2 phosphorylation in CTL was not absolutely Ca(2+) dependent but relied on the strength of T cell receptor stimulation. Ionomycin-stimulated Pyk2 phosphorylation did not require calmodulin activity, because phosphorylation was not inhibited by the calmodulin inhibitor W7, and we detected no Ca(2+)-regulated association between Pyk2 and calmodulin. Ca(2+)-stimulated Pyk2 phosphorylation was dependent on Src-family kinase activity, even at the Pyk2 autophosphorylation site. We sought to identify a Ca(2+)-regulated pathway that could trigger Pyk2 phosphorylation in T cells and found that ionomycin stimulated the production of reactive oxygen species and an H(2)O(2) scavenger inhibited ionomycin-induced Pyk2 phosphorylation. Additionally, H(2)O(2) induced strong Erk activation and ionomycin-stimulated Pyk2 phosphorylation was Erk dependent. These data support the conclusion that Ca(2+) mobilization induces the production of reactive oxygen species, which in turn activate the Erk pathway, leading to Src-family kinase-dependent Pyk2 phosphorylation. Our data demonstrate that Pyk2 is not a Ca(2+)-dependent kinase in T cells but instead, increased intracellular Ca(2+) induces Pyk2 phosphorylation through production of reactive oxygen species. These findings are consistent with the possibility that Pyk2 acts as an early sensor of numerous extracellular signals that trigger a Ca(2+) flux and/or reactive oxygen species to amplify tyrosine phosphorylation signaling events."
https://openalex.org/W2014077515,"Background Telomeres are essential to maintain chromosomal stability. Cells derived from mice lacking telomerase RNA component (mTERC−/− mice) display elevated telomere-mediated chromosome instability. Age-dependent telomere shortening and associated chromosome instability reduce the capacity to respond to cellular stress occurring during inflammation and cancer. Inflammation is one of the important risk factors in cancer progression. Controlled innate immune responses mediated by Toll-like receptors (TLR) are required for host defense against infection. Our aim was to understand the role of chromosome/genome instability in the initiation and maintenance of inflammation. Methodology/Principal Findings We examined the function of TLR4 in telomerase deficient mTERC−/− mice harbouring chromosome instability which did not develop any overt immunological disorder in pathogen-free condition or any form of cancers at this stage. Chromosome instability was measured in metaphase spreads prepared from wildtype (mTERC+/+), mTERC+/− and mTERC−/− mouse splenocytes. Peritoneal and/or bone marrow-derived macrophages were used to examine the responses of TLR4 by their ability to produce inflammatory mediators TNFα and IL6. Our results demonstrate that TLR4 is highly up-regulated in the immune cells derived from telomerase-null (mTERC−/−) mice and lipopolysaccharide, a natural ligand for TLR4 stabilises NF-κB binding to its promoter by down-regulating ATF-3 in mTERC−/− macrophages. Conclusions/Significance Our findings implied that background chromosome instability in the cellular level stabilises the action of TLR4-induced NF-κB action and sensitises cells to produce excess pro-inflammatory mediators. Chromosome/genomic instability data raises optimism for controlling inflammation by non-toxic TLR antagonists among high-risk groups."
https://openalex.org/W2062140702,"Background Erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) are widely used to treat anaemia but concerns exist about their potential to promote pathological angiogenesis in some clinical scenarios. In the current study we have assessed the angiogenic potential of three ESAs; epoetin delta, darbepoetin alfa and epoetin beta using in vitro and in vivo models. Methodology/Principal Findings The epoetins induced angiogenesis in human microvascular endothelial cells at high doses, although darbepoetin alfa was pro-angiogenic at low-doses (1–20 IU/ml). ESA-induced angiogenesis was VEGF-mediated. In a mouse model of ischaemia-induced retinopathy, all ESAs induced generation of reticulocytes but only epoetin beta exacerbated pathological (pre-retinal) neovascularisation in comparison to controls (p<0.05). Only epoetin delta induced a significant revascularisation response which enhanced normality of the vasculature (p<0.05). This was associated with mobilisation of haematopoietic stem cells and their localisation to the retinal vasculature. Darbepoetin alfa also increased the number of active microglia in the ischaemic retina relative to other ESAs (p<0.05). Darbepoetin alfa induced retinal TNFα and VEGF mRNA expression which were up to 4 fold higher than with epoetin delta (p<0.001). Conclusions This study has implications for treatment of patients as there are clear differences in the angiogenic potential of the different ESAs."
https://openalex.org/W2052353983,"A consistent debate is ongoing on genome-wide association studies (GWAs). A key point is the capability to identify low-penetrance variations across the human genome. Among the phenomena reducing the power of these analyses, phenocopy level (PE) hampers very seriously the investigation of complex diseases, as well known in neurological disorders, cancer, and likely of primary importance in human ageing. PE seems to be the norm, rather than the exception, especially when considering the role of epigenetics and environmental factors towards phenotype. Despite some attempts, no recognized solution has been proposed, particularly to estimate the effects of phenocopies on the study planning or its analysis design. We present a simulation, where we attempt to define more precisely how phenocopy impacts on different analytical methods under different scenarios. With our approach the critical role of phenocopy emerges, and the more the PE level increases the more the initial difficulty in detecting gene-gene interactions is amplified. In particular, our results show that strong main effects are not hampered by the presence of an increasing amount of phenocopy in the study sample, despite progressively reducing the significance of the association, if the study is sufficiently powered. On the opposite, when purely epistatic effects are simulated, the capability of identifying the association depends on several parameters, such as the strength of the interaction between the polymorphic variants, the penetrance of the polymorphism and the alleles (minor or major) which produce the combined effect and their frequency in the population. We conclude that the neglect of the possible presence of phenocopies in complex traits heavily affects the analysis of their genetic data."
https://openalex.org/W2052606414,"Background Microarray experiments in mice have shown that high fat diet can lead to elevated expression of genes that are disproportionately associated with immune functions. These effects of high fat (atherogenic) diet may be due to infiltration of tissues by leukocytes in coordination with inflammatory processes. Methodology/Principal Findings The Novartis strain-diet-sex microarray database (GSE10493) was used to evaluate the hepatic effects of high fat diet (4 weeks) in 12 mouse strains and both genders. We develop and apply an algorithm that identifies “signature transcripts” for many different leukocyte populations (e.g., T cells, B cells, macrophages) and uses this information to derive an in silico “inflammation profile”. Inflammation profiles highlighted monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells as key drivers of gene expression patterns associated with high fat diet in liver. In some strains (e.g., NZB/BINJ, B6), we estimate that 50–60% of transcripts elevated by high fat diet might be due to hepatic infiltration by these cell types. Interestingly, DBA mice appeared to exhibit resistance to localized hepatic inflammation associated with atherogenic diet. A common characteristic of infiltrating cell populations was elevated expression of genes encoding components of the toll-like receptor signaling pathway (e.g., Irf5 and Myd88). Conclusions/Significance High fat diet promotes infiltration of hepatic tissue by leukocytes, leading to elevated expression of immune-associated transcripts. The intensity of this effect is genetically controlled and sensitive to both strain and gender. The algorithm developed in this paper provides a framework for computational analysis of tissue remodeling processes and can be usefully applied to any in vivo setting in which inflammatory processes play a prominent role."
https://openalex.org/W2058590372,"Behavioral and/or developmental plasticity is crucial for resisting the impacts of environmental stressors. We investigated the plasticity of adult foraging behavior and chick development in an offshore foraging seabird, the black noddy (Anous minutus), during two breeding seasons. The first season had anomalously high sea-surface temperatures and ‘low’ prey availability, while the second was a season of below average sea-surface temperatures and ‘normal’ food availability. During the second season, supplementary feeding of chicks was used to manipulate offspring nutritional status in order to mimic conditions of high prey availability. When sea-surface temperatures were hotter than average, provisioning rates were significantly and negatively impacted at the day-to-day scale. Adults fed chicks during this low-food season smaller meals but at the same rate as chicks in the unfed treatment the following season. Supplementary feeding of chicks during the second season also resulted in delivery of smaller meals by adults, but did not influence feeding rate. Chick begging and parental responses to cessation of food supplementation suggested smaller meals fed to artificially supplemented chicks resulted from a decrease in chick demands associated with satiation, rather than adult behavioral responses to chick condition. During periods of low prey abundance, chicks maintained structural growth while sacrificing body condition and were unable to take advantage of periods of high prey abundance by increasing growth rates. These results suggest that this species expresses limited plasticity in provisioning behavior and offspring development. Consequently, responses to future changes in sea-surface temperature and other environmental variation may be limited."

Methodology/Principal Findings We describe two negative modulators of lin-12 activity in C. elegans. One gene, sel-11, was initially defined as a suppressor of a lin-12 hypomorphic allele; the other gene, cdc-42, is a well-studied Rho GTPase. Here, we show that SEL-11 corresponds to yeast Hrd1p and mammalian Synoviolin. We also show that cdc-42 has the genetic properties consistent with negative regulation of lin-12 activity during vulval precursor cell fate specification. Conclusions/Significance Our results underscore the multiplicity of negative regulatory mechanisms that impact on lin-12/Notch activity and suggest novel mechanisms by which constitutive lin-12/Notch activity might be exacerbated in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2061489599,"Background The diagnostic value of CSF tau for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) has been widely evaluated, showing a markedly disease-relative manner. However, the profiles of tau isoforms in CSF of CJD patients remain unknown. Here, we prepared the exon-specific antibodies against the peptides encoded by exon-2, exon-3 and exon-10 of human tau protein and evaluated the reactive profiles of tau in CSF samples from the patients with probable CJD. Methodology/Principal Findings Sequences encoding exon-2, exon-3 and exon-10 of human tau protein were cloned into a prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-2T. Using recombinant fusion proteins GST-E2, GST-E3 and GST-E10, three tau exon-specific antibodies were elicited. Reliable specificities of the prepared antibodies were obtained after a serial of purification processes, not only in recognizing the tau peptides encoded by exon-2, -3 and -10, but also in distinguishing six recombinant tau isoforms by Western blot and ELISA. Three predominant tau-specific bands were observed in CSF samples with the exon-specific and the commercial tau antibodies, respectively, showing different reactive profiles between the groups of probable CJD and non-CJD. A 65 KD band was detected only in the CSF samples from probable CJD patients, especially with the antibodies against exon-2 (Anti-tE2) and exon-10 (Anit-tE10). The appearances of 65 KD band in CSF correlated well with positive 14-3-3 in CSF and typical abnormality in EEG. Such band was not observed in the CSF samples of six tested genetic CJD patients. Conclusions/Significance Three exon-specific polyclonal antibodies were successfully prepared. Based on these antibodies, different CSF tau profiles in Western blots were observed between the groups of probable CJD and non-CJD. A disease-specific tau band emerged in the CSF samples from probable sporadic CJD, which may supply a new biomarker for screening sporadic CJD."
https://openalex.org/W2171967195,"The translocation of DNA helicases on single-stranded DNA and the unwinding of double-stranded DNA are fueled by the hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates (NTP). Although most helicases use ATP in these processes, the DNA helicase encoded by gene 4 of bacteriophage T7 uses dTTP most efficiently. To identify the structural requirements of the NTP, we determined the efficiency of DNA unwinding by T7 helicase using a variety of NTPs and their analogs. The 5-methyl group of thymine was critical for the efficient unwinding of DNA, although the presence of a 3′-ribosyl hydroxyl group partially overcame this requirement. The NTP-binding pocket of the protein was examined by randomly substituting amino acids for several amino acid residues (Thr-320, Arg-504, Tyr-535, and Leu-542) that the crystal structure suggests interact with the nucleotide. Although positions 320 and 542 required aliphatic residues of the appropriate size, an aromatic side chain was necessary at position 535 to stabilize NTP for efficient unwinding. A basic side chain of residue 504 was essential to interact with the 4-carbonyl of the thymine base of dTTP. Replacement of this residue with a small aliphatic residue allowed the accommodation of other NTPs, resulting in the preferential use of dATP and the use of dCTP, a nucleotide not normally used.

Results from this study suggest that the NTP must be stabilized by specific interactions within the NTP-binding site of the protein to achieve efficient hydrolysis. These interactions dictate NTP specificity. Helicases are ubiquitous enzymes that play pivotal roles in diverse cellular activities (1Singleton M.R. Dillingham M.S. Wigley D.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 23-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Reactions mediated by helicases require their ability to bind and move along a DNA or RNA strand. Such a fundamental feature is coupled to the binding of nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) 2The abbreviations used are: NTPnucleoside triphosphatessDNAsingle-stranded DNANi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidrNTPribonucleotide triphosphate4S-dT4-thiothymidine 5′-triphosphate5-Me-dC5-methyl-2′-deoxycytidine 5′-triphosphate5-Br-dU5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine 5′-triphosphate5-Pr-dU5-propynyl-2′-deoxyuridine 5′-triphosphate. and their hydrolysis. An underlying mechanism in helicase action is a change in contact of the protein with the nucleic acid strand depending on the state of the bound NTP (1Singleton M.R. Dillingham M.S. Wigley D.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 23-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Binding and subsequent hydrolysis of NTP induce conformational shifts in the nucleic acid-interacting part of the helicase that enable the enzyme to move unidirectionally. The unidirectional movement enables the helicase to translocate on the strand to which it is bound, and upon encountering duplex DNA, its continued movement results in unwinding of the dsDNA. Consequently, despite the divergence in their structure and mechanism of action, all helicases require the binding and hydrolysis of NTP to fulfill these multiple roles (2Caruthers J.M. McKay D.B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Accordingly, signature structural motifs of helicase for NTP binding, for example the Walker motifs A and B, are conserved throughout the helicase family (3Ilyina T.V. Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 34: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). These motifs interact with the phosphate moiety of NTP and influence DNA binding upon hydrolysis of NTP. In the case of hexameric helicases such as the T7 DNA helicase, complexity of helicase action is increased because the oligomerization of the subunits is a prerequisite for all the steps described above. In helicases of this family, binding and hydrolysis of NTP occur at the interface of two subunits (4Sawaya M.R. Guo S. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Cell. 1999; 99: 167-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 5Patel S.S. Picha K.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 651-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). A recent structural study of an AAA+ hexameric helicase demonstrated that indeed a polypeptide hairpin of the helicase makes different contacts with the ssDNA depending on the hydrolysis state of the NTP (6Enemark E.J. Joshua-Tor L. Nature. 2006; 442: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). nucleoside triphosphate single-stranded DNA nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid ribonucleotide triphosphate 4-thiothymidine 5′-triphosphate 5-methyl-2′-deoxycytidine 5′-triphosphate 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine 5′-triphosphate 5-propynyl-2′-deoxyuridine 5′-triphosphate. The helicase responsible for unwinding dsDNA to provide an ssDNA template for the replicative DNA polymerase of bacteriophage T7 is encoded by gene 4 of the phage. The multifunctional gene 4 protein contains a helicase domain located in the C-terminal half of the protein and a primase domain located in the N-terminal half. The helicase domain, along with the linker connecting the helicase and primase domains, contains the determinants for hexamer formation (7Guo S. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30303-30309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The T7 gene 4 helicase, like other homologs in the DnaB-like family (Family 4), functions as an oligomer (4Sawaya M.R. Guo S. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Cell. 1999; 99: 167-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 8Egelman E.H. Yu X. Wild R. Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cell. 2000; 101: 589-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The unique coexistence of both primase and helicase domains in a single polypeptide bypasses the requirement for assembly of the two proteins as it must occur in other replication systems. In addition, the primase benefits from the relatively tight binding of the helicase to DNA, and its location in the N-terminal half of the protein places it in the proper position to survey the DNA exiting from the translocating helicase for primase recognition sites (10Frick D.N. Richardson C.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 39-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Another feature unique to the T7 gene 4 helicase is its preference for dTTP, whereas most other helicases prefer ATP, the most abundant NTP in the cell (11Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman, New York1992: 54Google Scholar), in the unwinding reaction (12LeBowitz J.H. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4738-4748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Brennan C.A. Steinmetz E.J. Spear P. Platt T. J. Biol.

Yoder B.L. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25321-25327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some helicases can use dATP, GTP, or dCTP (13Brennan C.A. Steinmetz E.J. Spear P. Platt T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5440-5447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Venkatesan M. Silver L.L. Nossal N.G. J. Biol.

However, preferential use of dTTP over ATP has not been observed by any helicase other than the T7 helicase. Preferential use of dTTP by T7 gene 4 protein was noticed initially in studies on strand displacement DNA synthesis mediated by T7 DNA polymerase and T7 DNA helicase (18Kolodner R. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1977; 74: 1525-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In this reaction, the helicase unwinds the duplex DNA to generate ssDNA template for the DNA polymerase. Measurement of nucleoside diphosphate arising during DNA synthesis revealed that the T7 helicase most favorably uses dTTP and dATP followed by ATP (18Kolodner R. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1977; 74: 1525-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have shown that indeed either dTTP or dATP can support the unwinding of dsDNA by the T7 helicase (19Satapathy A.K. Crampton D.J. Beauchamp B.B. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 14286-14295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, the hydrolysis of dTTP by T7 DNA helicase is not limited to the unwinding of dsDNA as the hydrolysis of dTTP is also required for the unidirectional translocation of the helicase on ssDNA. In this reaction, dTTP is also preferred, although all NTPs except CTP are hydrolyzed (20Matson S.W. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14009-14016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Km for dTTP in this reaction is 0.4 mm, whereas that for ATP is an order of magnitude higher (3.2 mm). The Km for dATP, the NTP that is also used favorably, is 1.2 mm. The use of dNTP by the helicase for translocation is complex in that the functional helicase is a hexamer with six NTP-binding sites, each of which is capable of hydrolyzing NTP in a random manner (21Crampton D.J. Mukherjee S. Richardson C.C. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Consequently, the occupancy of NTP-binding sites other than the one fueling translocation of the DNA may have an effect on translocation on the DNA. Recent studies using genetically modified helicases suggest that T7 helicase uses the energy derived from the hydrolysis of dATP in addition to dTTP for mediating unwinding of dsDNA (19Satapathy A.K. Crampton D.J. Beauchamp B.B. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 14286-14295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallographic structures of the T7 helicase in complex with various nucleotides provide molecular details on the NTP-binding pockets (4Sawaya M.R. Guo S. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Cell. 1999; 99: 167-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 9Singleton M.R. Sawaya M.R. Ellenberger T. Wigley D.B. Cell. 2000; 101: 589-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The NTP-binding site located at the interface of two subunits within the hexameric helicase is composed of several conserved residues (Fig. 1). Essential roles of many of these residues have been demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis followed by biochemical characterization of the altered proteins (21Crampton D.J. Mukherjee S. Richardson C.C. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 22Notarnicola S.M. Richardson C.C. J. Biol.

U.S.A. 2004; 101: 4373-4378Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These roles include sensing the state of hydrolysis during catalysis of NTP hydrolysis (Gly-317 and Lys-318), coordination of metal ions (Ser-319 and Asp-424), providing the catalytic base (Glu-343), and communication between the bound DNA and the NTP (His-465). In addition, the arginine finger, Arg-522, of the subunit adjacent to the NTP contacts the γ-phosphate of NTP to couple NTP hydrolysis to conformational changes in the subunit. Although the residues mentioned above are located in proximity to phosphate groups of the NTP, structural studies also demonstrate that the base of the NTP is stacked between the side chains of two residues, Tyr-535 and Arg-504 (9Singleton M.R. Sawaya M.R. Ellenberger T. Wigley D.B. Cell. 2000; 101: 589-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), implicating a role for these residues in NTP binding. Precisely which structural features of the NTP-binding pocket dictate specificity for dTTP remains unclear. A recent study (19Satapathy A.K. Crampton D.J. Beauchamp B.B. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 14286-14295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) revealed that Arg-363, in close proximity to the sugar of the bound NTP, is essential for the hydrolysis of dATP, dCTP, and dGTP. In this study, Arg-504 and Ser-319 were found to be important in the hydrolysis of dTTP. For example, substitution of alanine for Arg-504 increases the rate of hydrolysis of dCTP and enables this nucleotide to fuel unwinding of DNA, and substitution of threonine for Ser-319 reduces the hydrolysis of dTTP without affecting that of dATP. Interestingly, bacterial helicases have a threonine at the position corresponding to Ser-319 in the T7 helicase and preferentially use ATP. In the current study, we examined the ability of a number of NTPs and their analogs to replace dTTP in the unwinding reaction in an attempt to identify the structural features of the NTP that are important for activity of the helicase. Based on structural information of the T7 helicase (4Sawaya M.R. Guo S. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Cell. 1999; 99: 167-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 8Egelman E.H. Yu X. Wild R. Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 3869-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 9Singleton M.R. Sawaya M.R. Ellenberger T. Wigley D.B. Cell. 2000; 101: 589-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), we selected four residues within the NTP-binding site that have the potential to play a role in NTP specificity. Rather than selectively substitute an amino acid for each of the four found in the helicase, we randomly replaced the four residues and examined the consequences of these replacements. By examining NTP analogs and site-directed mutagenesis in the NTP-binding site of T7 helicase, we identified specific interactions between the NTP and side chains of residues in the binding pocket that stabilize the NTP and support efficient translocation on ssDNA and unwinding of dsDNA. Primers used for site-directed mutagenesis were obtained from Integrated DNA Technology. DNA purification kits, Ni-NTA resin, and Ni-NTA minispin columns were purchased from Qiagen. Restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase, and Deep Vent® DNA polymerase were from New England Biolabs. Slide-A-Lyzer® minidialysis units were from Pierce. NTP analogs were purchased from TriLink Biotechnologies. A library of gene 4 proteins containing a single amino acid substitution at specific positions was generated as follows. DNA fragments containing random mutations were generated by standard PCR using a mutagenic primer harboring mixed codon NNK (N = any base, K = G or T) at the designated position (27Hughes M.D. Nagel D.A. Santos A.F. Sutherland A.J. Hine A.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 973-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The DNA fragments were digested with restriction endonucleases and ligated into a plasmid encoding the His-tagged gene 4 protein (pET28-gp4) previously cut with the same restriction enzymes. After transformation of the ligation products, resulting plasmids were isolated from individual colonies, and the entire gene 4 coding region of each plasmid was verified by DNA sequence analysis. To generate mutations containing two separate single amino acid substitutions, PCR was carried out as described above using a plasmid containing a single mutation as template along with mutagenic primers containing another single mutation. Escherichia coli DH5α containing a plasmid encoding T7 gene 4 was grown to an A600 of ∼1. About 0.1 ml of the bacterial culture was mixed with 3 ml of LB medium containing 0.7% agar and plated on an LB plate containing kanamycin. A small amount (1–2 μl) of serially diluted phage solution was spotted on the plate and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Proteins used for the initial biochemical screening were prepared by one-step affinity purification using a Ni-NTA minispin column. Gene 4 protein containing a His6 tag at the N terminus was overproduced in E. coli BL21(DE3) by inducing with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 3 h at an A600 of 1. The bacterial cells from a 100-ml culture were harvested, resuspended in 2 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.1 m NaCl), and freeze-thawed three times in the presence of lysozyme (0.2 mg/ml) to rupture the cells. Clear bacterial lysate was collected by centrifugation and loaded onto the Ni-NTA spin column. After spinning, the column was washed with 5 ml of buffer A containing 0.1 m imidazole, and the protein was eluted with 0.3 ml of buffer A containing 0.5 m imidazole followed by dialysis against storage buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 50% glycerol). Protein purity was greater than 70% as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis followed by Coomassie staining. Large scale purification of gene 4 protein was carried out as described previously (28Lee S.J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49419-49426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A minireplication fork consisting of a 65-mer and a 5′-32P-radiolabeled 45-mer DNA was used as substrate for the DNA unwinding assay (29Lee S.J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23384-23393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The partial duplex substrate was further purified on a 10% native polyacrylamide gel to remove remaining ssDNA that might provide a substrate for the translocation activity of gene 4 helicase. A standard reaction mixture contained 100 nm DNA substrate, 1 mm indicated NTP, and 17 nm gene 4 protein (hexameric concentration) in reaction buffer B (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm DTT). The unwinding reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 5 min and terminated by addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mm. After the reaction products were separated on a 10% native gel, the amount of radioactivity in the displaced 45-mer was measured using a Fuji BAS 1000 BioImaging analyzer. All data were from at least two independent experiments. A range of gene 4 protein concentrations (from 10 to 600 nm) was incubated with 100 μm indicated NTP (0.25 μCi of [α-32P]NTP) in reaction buffer B. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for either 60 min in the absence of DNA or 20 min in the presence of 9 nm M13 ssDNA. The reaction was terminated by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 25 mm. Reaction products were separated by polyethyleneimine cellulose thin layer chromatography (28Lee S.J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49419-49426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and analyzed by a Fuji BAS 1000 BioImaging analyzer. Unwinding of dsDNA by T7 gene 4 helicase can be measured directly by observing the release of a radioactively labeled oligonucleotide partially annealed to a complementary oligonucleotide (29Lee S.J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23384-23393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The minireplication fork (Fig. 2, inset) has a 40-nucleotide 5′-ssDNA tail to which the helicase can assemble and a 20-nucleotide 3′-ssDNA tail. Because the unwinding reaction requires hydrolysis of NTP, the level of unwinding in the presence of NTP provides information as to how efficiently T7 gene 4 helicase uses a particular NTP. We measured the ability of various NTPs to support activity of T7 DNA helicase to unwind DNA (Fig. 2). In the assay, the minireplication fork was present in a 6-fold molar excess over the hexameric helicase to ensure that turnover of the helicase can occur in the reaction. In the initial experiment, we determined apparent Km and Vmax for the most frequently used NTPs, dTTP and dATP (Table 1). Although dTTP was preferentially used for unwinding (more than 3-fold higher Vmax than dATP), both NTPs showed similar Km values lower than 0.3 mm. In addition, the average cellular concentration of rNTPs is in the millimolar range (11Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman, New York1992: 54Google Scholar). Therefore, we used 1 mm NTP for comparison with dTTP in unwinding assay. Overall, the preference for dNTPs in the unwinding reaction is in agreement with the previous observations measuring their efficiency in the coupled helicase-polymerase assay and in their hydrolysis during translocation on ssDNA (18Kolodner R. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1977; 74: 1525-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 20Matson S.W. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14009-14016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The most efficient dNTP to support unwinding by the T7 helicase was dTTP followed by dATP; as found previously (19Satapathy A.K. Crampton D.J. Beauchamp B.B. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 14286-14295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), dGTP and dCTP were essentially unable to support unwinding of DNA by the helicase. ddTTP was similar to dTTP in supporting unwinding of DNA, but surprisingly ddATP was unable to do so. rNTPs were poor substrates for T7 DNA helicase with only UTP providing any detectable activity. Clearly the NTP-binding site of T7 helicase is optimized for dTTP with the unexplained ability to use dATP.TABLE 1Apparent kinetic constants for NTP used by T7 gene 4 helicase in DNA unwinding reactionKmVmaxmmfmol dsDNA unwound/83 fmol hexameric helicase/5 mindTTP0.22 ± 0.2165 ± 11dATP0.24 ± 0.249 ± 8 Open table in a new tab To identify structural components of dTTP contributing to the preference for DNA unwinding, we examined a variety of NTPs structurally related to dTTP for their ability to support unwinding activity. All NTPs containing thymine showed a significant level of unwinding regardless of the presence or location of the hydroxyl group on the sugar (Fig. 3A). When the base was replaced with uracil, eliminating the 5-methyl group, only the configuration of 2′-dUTP (3′-OH, 2′-H) provided activity approaching that observed with dTTP. The presence of a 2′-OH (rUTP) rendered the NTP almost 7-fold less active. Collectively, these results suggest that the 5-methyl in the base is required to maintain an important contact in the binding pocket of T7 helicase. The absence of the 5-methyl in the base can be compensated by the absence of a 2′-OH and the presence of a 3′-OH. Because modifications in the base of dTTP significantly affected its use in unwinding by T7 helicase, we further examined the effect of substitutions at positions 4 and 5 of the base on the unwinding activity. Although replacement of the carbonyl group at position 4 with a thio group (4S-dT) slightly reduced unwinding efficiency, substitution of an amino group (5-Me-dC) eliminated the activity (Fig. 3B), suggesting a critical interaction mediated by the carbonyl group. Similarly, the methyl group at position 5 could be replaced with a bromo group (5-Br-dU) of an equivalent size without affecting unwinding, but a bulky propynyl group (5-Pr-dU) at this position abolished activity to support unwinding. The NTP use by T7 gene 4 helicase presented above suggests that residues within the NTP-binding pocket of the protein are important in accommodating the 4-carbonyl, 5-methyl, and the 3′-OH groups of dTTP. Fortunately, crystal structures of the T7 helicase domain in complex with dTTP (Protein Data Bank code 1CR4) and a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog (Protein Data Bank code 1E0J) are available (4Sawaya M.R. Guo S. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Cell. 1999; 99: 167-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 9Singleton M.R. Sawaya M.R. Ellenberger T. Wigley D.B. Cell. 2000; 101: 589-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Based on these structures, we chose four residues located in proximity (4–5 Å) to the base and sugar of the dTTP for further examination. These residues (Thr-320, Arg-504, Tyr-535, and Leu-542) and their properties are listed in Table 2. Each of the selected residues was randomly replaced with other amino acids using a mixed codon (NNK where N = any base and K = G or T) at the selected position as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Although this random mutagenesis significantly reduces redundancy to code all 20 possible amino acids (27Hughes M.D. Nagel D.A. Santos A.F. Sutherland A.J. Hine A.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 973-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), we were able to obtain only 9–14 different substitutions for the four positions after examination of ∼90 clones for each position. It appears that statistically larger numbers of clones need to be examined to obtain all possible 19 substitutions.TABLE 2Residues of T7 helicase randomly substitutedResidueIn proximity toSecondary structureConserved in Family 4 helicaseThr-320Sugarα helixThr/Ala/Ser/LeuArg-504BaseLoopArgTyr-535Sugar, baseβ strandTyr/PheLeu-542Baseβ strandVarious Open table in a new tab In total, 47 altered helicases containing a single amino acid substitution were overproduced. The proteins were purified as a fusion protein containing six histidine residues at the N terminus using Ni-NTA affinity column chromatography. The presence of the histidine tag did not affect protein function as judged by phage complementation assay and DNA unwinding assays (data not shown). Unwinding activity of the altered helicases was examined in the presence of specific NTP(s) (Fig. 4). As the wild-type helicase did not efficiently use NTPs other than dTTP and dATP, we used mixtures of the less used NTPs in the initial screening. The results of the screening assay for each of the four residues mutated are presented below. Substitutions of non-charged residues for this position gave rise to helicases that exhibit an NTP use profile similar to that of wild-type helicase. Particularly, replacement with a small aliphatic residue (Ala or Gly) demonstrated almost no change from the wild-type protein. It is noteworthy that gp4-T320S uses dATP as efficiently as it does dTTP and also uses nucleotides that are poor substrates for the wild-type enzyme as evidenced by its use of the A + U mixture and the G + C + dG + dC mixture. The only exception to NTP use unaffected by replacement with a neutral residue was observed with gp4-T320P. This altered protein could not use any NTP and thus could not support growth of T7 phage lacking gene 4 (T7Δ4). Likewise, replacement with a basic residue (Lys or Arg) also abrogated the ability to use any nucleotide for unwinding and to complement T7Δ4 phage. These results suggest the requirement for a hydrophobic environment at this position. The remainder of the substitutions produced proteins whose unwinding activities were more or less similar to that of wild-type protein in the presence of dTTP. However, these altered helicases did not use NTPs other than dTTP as efficiently as did the wild-type protein. Replacement of Arg-504 with a small aliphatic residue (Cys, Gly, Ser, or Val) led to a preference of dATP over dTTP. However, this shift in NTP use was not observed with larger aliphatic residues (Ile and Leu). Most striking is the finding that the R504G alteration gave rise to a helicase that catalyzed unwinding with the mixture of CTP, dCTP, GTP, and dGTP. Wild-type gene 4 protein could not use this nucleotide mixture to catalyze unwinding of DNA. gp4-R504C used dATP but no longer used dTTP. On the other hand, replacement with l"

However, few studies have documented time to different developmental stages of embryonic Chinook salmon and no reference color photographs are available. The objectives of this study were to construct an index relating developmental stages of hatchery-reared fall Chinook salmon embryos to time and temperature (e.g., degree days) and provide high-quality color photographs of each identified developmental stage.Fall Chinook salmon eggs were fertilized in a hatchery environment and sampled approximately every 72 h post-fertilization until 50% hatch. Known embryonic developmental features described for sockeye salmon were used to describe development of Chinook salmon embryos. A thermal sums model was used to describe the relationship between embryonic development rate and water temperature. Mean water temperature was 8.0 degrees C (range; 3.9-11.7 degrees C) during the study period. Nineteen stages of embryonic development were identified for fall Chinook salmon; two stages in the cleavage phase, one stage in the gastrulation phase, and sixteen stages in the organogenesis phase. The thermal sums model used in this study provided similar estimates of fall Chinook salmon embryonic development rate in water temperatures varying from 3.9-11.7 degrees C (mean=8 degrees C) to those from several other studies rearing embryos in constant 8 degrees C water temperature.The developmental index provides a reasonable description of timing to known developmental stages of Chinook salmon embryos and was useful in determining developmental stages of wild fall Chinook salmon embryos excavated from redds in the Columbia River. This index should prove useful to other researchers who wish to approximate fertilization dates of Chinook salmon eggs from natural redds, assuming the thermal history of embryos is known."

The impact of European guidelines was assessed by comparing the efficiency of the process between applications started before and after the decree introducing in Italy the Clinical Trial Application form (MD-CTA). Outcomes of the descriptive analyses were the time to EC opinion, the time to administrative agreement signature after a positive EC opinion, and the cumulative percentage of submissions that came to closure (either positive or negative) within four subsequent time cohorts.From March 2007 to October 2009, 202 applications were submitted to 107 centres. Forty-four (59%) applications of those submitted before were successful, compared to 71 (55%) of those submitted after MD-CTA. Most of the failures were due to missing EC response (27% and 22%) or administrative reasons (10% and 16%, before and after, respectively); very few (4% and 7%) were due to EC refusal. The impact of the MD-CTA on time to EC opinion looked positive (median 4.1 vs 2.4 months, before and after, respectively) but a subgroup analysis revealed that the impact was limited to a comparison biased by the selection of EC. After a positive EC opinion, there was no difference before and after MD-CTA in the time to administrative agreement signature (median 3.6 and 3.8 months, respectively). A trend to shortening time to closure of the whole submission process over the time was evident, with 58% of the applications coming to closure within 6 months from submission in the most recent cohort.In our experience there is reassuring evidence of a trend toward shortening the time spent to activate non-profit clinical trials in Italy, but the whole process still remains inefficient. Efforts should be made to improve the process, also focusing on administrative procedures."
