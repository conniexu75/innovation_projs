https://openalex.org/W2963423786,"An iPhone 6 using the Avenza software for capturing horizontal positions was employed to understand relative positional accuracy in an urban environment, during two seasons of the year, two times of day, and two perceived WiFi usage periods. On average, time of year did not seem to influence the average error observed in horizontal positions when GPS-only (no WiFi) capability was enabled, nor when WiFi was enabled. Observations of average horizontal position error only seemed to improve with time of day (afternoon) during the leaf-off season. During each season and during each time of day, horizontal position error seemed to improve in general during perceived high WiFi usage periods (when more people were present). Overall average horizontal position accuracy of the iPhone 6 (7-13 m) is consistent with the general accuracy levels observed of recreation-grade GPS receivers in potential high multi-path environments."
https://openalex.org/W2964207048,"Introduction Health effects of social isolation are well-studied at older age, in English-speaking countries, for individual health conditions, and based on unidimensional measures of isolation. Hardly any evidence exists for younger ages, for continental European and particularly German-speaking countries and based on multidimensional measures of isolation. This study therefore aimed to examine prevalence rates and associations of social isolation with various health conditions and behaviors in the entire Swiss population and across different age groups. Methods Nationally representative cross-sectional data from the Swiss Health Survey collected in 2012 were used and analyzed. The study sample covered 21,597 randomly selected adolescents and adults living in Switzerland and aged 15 and older. A multifactorial five-item social integration index was used to assess social disconnectedness and perceived isolation. Results Social isolation has been found to steadily increase with age and almost consistently to be strongly associated with poor health conditions and unfavorable behaviors across all ages. Nearly a quarter of the general population could be categorized as either only partly integrated or even poorly integrated and largely isolated. The socially isolated people independent of their age showed strongly elevated relative risks of poor self-rated health (aOR = 4.0), musculoskeletal disorders (aOR = 2.8), moderate to severe depression (aOR = 11.5), and multiple health problems (aOR = 5.0). They were also found to be at comparably high risk of behaving unhealthy with regard to physical inactivity (aOR = 2.2), poor diet (aOR = 1.9) and use of psychotropic medications (aOR = 3.6). Although prevalence rates of poor health conditions and behaviors differed greatly between the studied age groups, strong associations and clear dose-response relationships have been found separately for all age groups and particularly for the youngest. A fairly weak or no association at all (depending on the age group) with the degree of social integration was observed only for daily smoking. Conclusions Social isolation may be less prevalent at younger ages, but is then even more strongly associated with poor health conditions and behaviors than at older ages."
https://openalex.org/W2963327097,"The global obesity epidemic constitutes a major cause of morbidity and mortality challenging public health care systems worldwide. Thus, a better understanding of its pathophysiology and the development of novel therapeutic options are urgently needed. Recently, alterations of the intestinal microbiome in the obese have been discussed as a promoting factor in the pathophysiology of obesity and as a contributing factor to related diseases such as type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. The present pilot study investigated the effect of a structured weight loss program on fecal microbiota in obese type 2 diabetics. Twelve study subjects received a low-calorie formula diet for six weeks, followed by a nine week food reintroduction and stabilization period. Fecal microbiota were determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing of stool samples at baseline, after six weeks and at the end of the study after fifteen weeks. All study subjects lost weight continuously throughout the program. Changes in fecal microbiota were most pronounced after six weeks of low-calorie formula diet, but reverted partially until the end of the study. However, the gut microbiota phylogenetic diversity increased persistently. The abundance of Collinsella, which has previously been associated with atherosclerosis, decreased significantly during the weight loss program. This study underlines the impact of dietary changes on the intestinal microbiome and further demonstrates the beneficial effects of weight loss on gut microbiota. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02970838."
https://openalex.org/W2964096641,"Purpose To classify the risk factors that contribute to the development versus progression of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Methods The medical records of premature infants born with a birth weight (BW) less than 1501 g or a gestational age (GA) of 32 weeks or less were retrospectively reviewed. Twenty potential risk factors that may influence the development or progression of ROP were analyzed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. The progression of ROP was defined as type 1 ROP, threshold ROP, or aggressive posterior ROP for which treatment was recommended. Results A total of 324 eyes were included; 157 eyes (48.5%) showed ROP development, and 48 eyes exhibited ROP progression (14.8% of all eyes and 30.6% of the ROP-developed eyes). According to the univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, prenatal steroid use, GA, the duration of mechanical ventilation, and respiratory distress syndrome were associated with the development of ROP. However, GA, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, the number of red blood cell units transfused, intraventricular hemorrhage, and periventricular leukomalacia were significantly correlated with ROP progression. Conclusion The risk factors that influenced ROP development versus ROP progression were not identical. Evaluating these risk factors during screening of high-risk premature infants will help determine the appropriate timing of examinations and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2962951970,"Purpose To assess the superficial retinal vessel density (SRVD) and foveal avascular zone (FAZ) in myopic children using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). Methods 174 eyes of 89 subjects with myopia and 101 eyes of 54 age-matched, emmetropic volunteers (control group) were enrolled in this study. The mean age of the subjects and controls was 13.9 (SD ± 2.3) and 13.1 (SD ± 2.4), respectively. Myopia was defined as spherical equivalent <– 1.0 diopter. Emmetropic subjects were defined as having spherical equivalent from + 0.5 to − 0.5 diopter. The mean axial length (AL) in myopic patients was 24.58 mm (SD ± 1.22) and 22.88 mm (SD ± 0.65) in the controls. Every patient underwent a complete ophthalmological examination and OCTA, using AngioVue (Optovue). The FAZ area and superficial retinal vessel density, including whole SRVD, fovea SRVD and parafovea SRVD, were analyzed. Foveal thickness (FT) and parafoveal thickness (PFT) were also taken into consideration. Results Whole SRVD, parafovea SRVD and PFT were significantly higher in controls than in the myopic subjects (p < 0.001, p = 0.007, p < 0.01, respectively). The FAZ area was significantly larger in the myopic group compared to the controls (p = 0.010). Fovea SRVD and FT did not differ significantly between the groups (p = 0.740, p = 0.795 respectively). In overall subjects we found significant correlation between axial length and all the investigative parameters: age, FAZ area, whole SRVD, parafovea SRVD, fovea SRVD, PFT, FT (p < 0.001, p = 0.014, p = 0.008, p < 0.005, p = 0.014, p = 0.010, p = 0.024, respectively). Analyzing only myopic group we confirmed that AL was significantly correlated with age, whole SRVD and parafovea SRVD (p < 0.001, p = 0.014, p = 0.009, respectively). Similarly, in this group the spherical equivalent also correlated with age, whole SRVD and parafovea SRVD (p < 0.001, p = 0.007, p = 0.005, respectively). Such correlations were not confirmed in the non–myopic group. Conclusions Our results suggest that superficial retinal vessel density is decreased and FAZ area is enlarged in the entire group of the myopic children compared to emmetropic subjects. Longitudinal observation of these young patients is needed to determine the relevance of the microvascular alterations in future."
https://openalex.org/W2962928268,"The study was conducted to determine the effects of genotype (G), environment (E), their interaction (GEI) and genetic gain on yield and grain quality traits in Turkish spring wheat cultivars released between 1964 and 2010. We conducted a multi-environment trial at three testing locations: Adana, Adapazarı, and Izmir, during the 2009, 2011 and 2013 cropping seasons and tested 35 cultivars released by the respective breeding programs. Allelic variations of high and low molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS and LMW-GS) and 1B/1R translocation was also determined and evaluated in all cultivars. Comparing yield across three locations, Adana (6416 kg ha-1) yield was relatively higher than in Izmir (5887 kg ha-1) and Adapazarı (5205 kg ha-1) (P<0.001). Overall, GY was influenced by the varieties, testing location and breeding programs (P<0.001). Cultivars from Izmir breeding program performed relatively better (6174 kg ha-1) than those from Adana (5996 kg ha-1) and Adapazarı (5351 kg ha-1) (<0.001). We recommend Ziyabey-98, Menemen, and Basribey-95, for stable grain yield in spring wheat production across the studied regions because of their wide adaptability, and Pamukova-97 for future breeding to improve grain quality parameters. We found three breeding programs have successfully increased the grain yield and quality traits for 46 years. As a group, cultivars released after 2000 had the highest yield indicating breeding progress. Genetic gain for GY was 30.9 kg ha-1 per year from 1964 with annual increase compared to the yield of older cultivar Akova B-2 (4102 kg ha-1) which constitutes a 0.75% rate of genetic gain. Improvement in grain quality was related to change in protein composition rather than an increase in protein content whereas yield improvement seems to mainly be related to increases in test weight and 1000 kernel weight. High molecular weight glutenin subunit (HMW-GS) 5+10 showed an increase in frequency whereas 2+12 showed a decrease over the breeding period."
https://openalex.org/W2962981520,"Sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) has a complex genome with variable ploidy and frequent aneuploidy, which hampers the understanding of phenotype and genotype relations. Despite this complexity, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) may be used to identify favorable alleles for target traits in core collections and then assist breeders in better managing crosses and selecting superior genotypes in breeding populations. Therefore, in the present study, we used a diversity panel of sugarcane, called the Brazilian Panel of Sugarcane Genotypes (BPSG), with the following objectives: (i) estimate, through a mixed model, the adjusted means and genetic parameters of the five yield traits evaluated over two harvest years; (ii) detect population structure, linkage disequilibrium (LD) and genetic diversity using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers; (iii) perform GWAS analysis to identify marker-trait associations (MTAs); and iv) annotate the sequences giving rise to SSR markers that had fragments associated with target traits to search for putative candidate genes. The phenotypic data analysis showed that the broad-sense heritability values were above 0.48 and 0.49 for the first and second harvests, respectively. The set of 100 SSR markers produced 1,483 fragments, of which 99.5% were polymorphic. These SSR fragments were useful to estimate the most likely number of subpopulations, found to be four, and the LD in BPSG, which was stronger in the first 15 cM and present to a large extension (65 cM). Genetic diversity analysis showed that, in general, the clustering of accessions within the subpopulations was in accordance with the pedigree information. GWAS performed through a multilocus mixed model revealed 23 MTAs, six, three, seven, four and three for soluble solid content, stalk height, stalk number, stalk weight and cane yield traits, respectively. These MTAs may be validated in other populations to support sugarcane breeding programs with introgression of favorable alleles and marker-assisted selection."
https://openalex.org/W2963419923,"Expansin is a type of cell wall elongation and stress relaxation protein involved in various developmental processes and stress resistances in plant. In this study, we identified 36 potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) genes belonging to the expansin (StEXP) gene family from the genome reference. These genes included 24 α-expansins (StEXPAs), five β-expansins (StEXPBs), one expansin-like A (StEXLA) and six expansin-like B (StEXLBs). The RNA-Seq analysis conducted from a variety of tissue types showed 34 expansins differentially expressed among tissues, some of which only expressed in specific tissues. Most of the StEXPAs and StEXPB2 transcripts were more abundant in young tuber compared with other tissues, suggesting they likely play a role in tuber development. There were 31 genes, especially StEXLB6, showed differential expression under the treatments of ABA, IAA and GA3, as well as under the drought and heat stresses, indicating they were likely involved in potato stress resistance. In addition, the gene co-expression analysis indicated the StEXLBs likely contribute to a wider range of stress resistances compared with other genes. We found the StEXLA and six StEXLBs expressed differently under a range of abiotic stresses (salt, alkaline, heavy metals, drought, heat, and cold stresses), which likely participated in the associated signaling pathways. Comparing with the control group, potato growing under the drought or heat stresses exhibited up-regulation of the all six StEXLB genes in leaves, whereas, the StEXLB3, StEXLB4, StEXLB5 and StEXLB6 showed relatively higher expression levels in roots. This suggested these genes likely played a role in the drought and heat tolerance. Overall, this study has shown the potential role of the StEXP genes in potato growth and stress tolerance, and provided fundamental resources for the future studies in potato breeding."
https://openalex.org/W2963092795,"Background Axl is a cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase, and activation of the Axl attenuates inflammation induced by various stimuli. Growth arrest-specific 6 (Gas6) has high affinity for Axl receptor. The role of Gas6/Axl signaling in ischemia-reperfusion-induced acute lung injury (IR-ALI) has not been explored previously. We hypothesized that Gas6/Axl signaling regulates IR-induced alveolar inflammation via a pathway mediated by suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3). Methods IR-ALI was induced by producing 30 min of ischemia followed by 90 min of reperfusion in situ in an isolated and perfused rat lung model. The rats were randomly allotted to a control group and IR groups, which were treated with three different doses of Gas6. Mouse alveolar epithelium MLE-12 cells were cultured in control and hypoxia-reoxygenation (HR) conditions with or without Gas6 and Axl inhibitor R428 pretreatment. Results We found that Gas6 attenuated IR-induced lung edema, the production of proinflammatory cytokines in perfusates, and the severity of ALI ex vivo. IR down-regulated SOCS3 expression and up-regulated NF-κB, and Gas6 restored this process. In the model of MLE-12 cells with HR, Gas6 suppressed the activation of TRAF6 and NF-κB by up-regulating SOCS3. Axl expression of alveolar epithelium was suppressed in IR-ALI but Gas6 restored phosphorylation of Axl. The anti-inflammatory effect of Gas6 was antagonized by R428, which highlighted that phosphorylation of Axl mediated the protective role of Gas6 in IR-ALI. Conclusions Gas6 up-regulates phosphorylation of Axl on alveolar epithelium in IR-ALI. The Gas6/Axl signaling activates the SOCS3-mediated pathway and attenuates IR-related inflammation and injury."
https://openalex.org/W2963234714,"Hypoxia is an important cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) in various conditions because kidneys are one of the most susceptible organs to hypoxia. In this study, we investigated whether nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 3-phosphate (NADPH) oxidase 4 (Nox4) plays a role in hypoxia induced AKI in a cellular and animal model. Expression of Nox4 in cultured human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2) was significantly increased by hypoxic stimulation. TGF-β1 was endogenously secreted by hypoxic HK-2 cells. SB4315432 (a TGF-β1 receptor I inhibitor) significantly inhibited Nox4 expression in HK-2 cells through the Smad-dependent cell signaling pathway. Silencing of Nox4 using Nox4 siRNA and pharmacologic inhibition with GKT137831 (a specific Nox1/4 inhibitor) reduced the production of ROS and attenuated the apoptotic pathway. In addition, knockdown of Nox4 increased cell survival in hypoxic HK-2 cells and pretreatment with GKT137831 reproduce these results. This study demonstrates that hypoxia induces HK-2 cell apoptosis through a signaling pathway involving TGF-β1 via Smad pathway induction of Nox4-dependent ROS generation. In an ischemia/reperfusion rat model, pretreatment of GKT137831 attenuated ischemia/reperfusion induced acute kidney injury as indicated by preserved kidney function, attenuated renal structural damage and reduced apoptotic cells. Therapies targeting Nox4 may be effective against hypoxia-induced AKI."
https://openalex.org/W2956226931,"Background The gap between fertility outcomes and fertility ideals is notably higher in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) than elsewhere, relating to both under- and overachievement of fertility ideals. We consider the extent to which the relationship between fertility ideals and fertility outcomes is related to educational achievement. Further, we consider if these educational differentials are the same or different in SSA, and thereby consider the extent to which increasing levels of education in SSA may decrease fertility. Data and methods We use 227 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHSs) from 58 countries worldwide to look at population- level measures of the mismatch between fertility ideals and fertility outcomes. Population level measures are used to assess whether the correspondence between fertility intentions and achievements differ by level of education. We then look at the individual-level determinants of both under- and overachieving fertility intentions. Data from the most recent DHS in 54 of the original countries is used for the individual level analysis, with five countries excluded due to the most recent available survey being out of date. Results An average of 40% of women in SSA underachieve their stated fertility intentions compared to 26% in non-SSA countries. Furthermore, compared to other LMICs, higher levels of education are not related to better correspondence between fertility intentions and outcomes in SSA. In Middle/Western Africa countries, on average, 48% of women with secondary or higher education have fewer children than their ideal, compared to just 24% who have more children than their ideal. Conclusion We argue that the phenomenon of underachieving fertility ideals (or unrealized fertility) may be of particular importance for the ongoing fertility transition throughout SSA, especially as more highly educated groups do not appear to be following the patterns observed elsewhere."
https://openalex.org/W2963781036,"In 2017, the WHO identified Acinetobacter baumannii as the top priority for the development of new antibiotics. Despite the need for new antibiotics, there remains a lack of well validated preclinical tools for A. baumannii. Here, we characterize and validate a mouse model for A. baumannii translational research. Antibiotic sensitivity for meropenem, amikacin, and polymyxin b was determined by the broth microdilution MIC assay. LD100 inoculums, in both blood and lung infection models, were determined in male and female C3HeB/FeJ mice that were challenged with various A. baumannii clinical isolates. Blood (blood infection model) or blood and lung tissue (lung infection model) were collected from infected mice at 2 and 18 hours and the bacterial burden was determined by quantitative culture. Blood chemistry was analyzed using the iStat system. Cytokines (IL-1ß, TNF, IL-6, and IL-10) were measured in the blood and lung homogenate by ELISA assay. Lung sections (H&E stains) were scored by a pathologist. In the blood infection model, the cytokines and physiological data indicate that mice become moribund due to sepsis (low blood pH, falling bicarbonate, and a rising base deficit), whereas mice become moribund due to respiratory failure (low blood pH, rising bicarbonate, and a falling base deficit) in the oral aspiration pneumonia model. We also characterized the timing of changes in various clinical and biomarker endpoints, which can serve as a basis for future interventional studies. Susceptibility was generally similar across gender and infection route. However, we did observe that female mice were approximately 2-fold more sensitive to LAC-4 ColR in the blood infection model. We also observed that female mice were more than 10-fold more resistant to VA-AB41 in the oral aspiration pneumonia model. These results establish parameters to follow in order to assess efficacy of novel preventative and therapeutic approaches for these infections."
https://openalex.org/W2963552917,"In chronically infected HCV patients emergence and evolution of fibrosis, as a consequence of virus persistence, can be considered as an indicator of disease advancement. Therefore the aim of this study was to correlate alterations of immune response in chronic HCV patients with liver histopathology. Sera cytokine levels and frequency of circulating and liver infiltrating cells were evaluated using 13plex Kit Flow Cytomix, flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. We found that the number of circulating T lymphocytes (including CD4+, CD8+ and Treg) and B lymphocytes, as well as DCs, was higher in patients with no fibrosis than in healthy subjects. In patients with fibrosis frequency of these cells decreased, and contrarily, in the liver, number of T and B lymphocytes gradually increased with fibrosis. Importantly, in patients with advanced fibrosis, liver infiltrating regulatory T cells and DC-SIGN+ mononuclear cells with immunosuppressive and wound-healing effector functions were abundantly present. Cytokine profiling showed predominance of proinflammatory cytokines in patients with no fibrosis and a tendency of decline in level of all cytokines with severity of liver injury. Lower but sustained IL-4 production refers to Th2 predominance in higher stages of fibrosis. Altogether, our results reveal graduall alterations of immunological parameters during fibrosis evolution and illustrate the course of immunological events through disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W2963619385,"If the brain is a complex network of functionally specialized areas, it might be expected that mental representations could also behave in a similar way. We propose the concept of ‘psychonectome’ to formalize the idea of psychological constructs forming a dynamic network of mutually dependent elements. As a proof-of-concept of the psychonectome, networks analysis (NA) was used to explore structural changes in the network of constructs resulting from a psychological intervention. NA was applied to explore the effects of an 8-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program in healthy participants (N = 182). Psychological functioning was measured by questionnaires assessing five key domains related to MBSR: mindfulness, compassion, psychological well-being, psychological distress and emotional-cognitive control. A total of 25 variables, covering the five constructs, were considered as nodes in the NA. Participants significantly improved in most of the psychological questionnaires. More interesting from a network perspective, there were also significant changes in the topological relationships among the elements. Expected influence and strength centrality indexes revealed that mindfulness and well-being measures were the most central nodes in the networks. The nodes with highest topological change after the MBSR were attentional control, compassion measures, depression and thought suppression. Also, cognitive appraisal, an adaptive emotion regulation strategy, was associated to rumination before the MBSR program but became related to mindfulness and well-being measures after the program. Community analysis revealed a strong topological association between mindfulness, compassion, and emotional regulation, which supports the key role of compassion in mindfulness training. These results highlight the importance of exploring psychological changes from a network perspective and support the conceptual advantage of considering the interconnectedness of psychological constructs in terms of a ‘psychonectome’ as it may reveal ways of functioning that cannot be analyzed through conventional analytic methods."
https://openalex.org/W2963114299,"The adverse consequences of herbicide drift towards sensitive crops have been extensively reported in the literature. However, little to no information is available on the consequences of herbicide drift onto weed species inhabiting boundaries of agricultural fields. Exposure to herbicide drift could be detrimental to long-term weed management as several weed species have evolved herbicide-resistance after recurrent selection with sublethal herbicide rates This study investigated the deposition of glyphosate, 2,4-D, and dicamba spray particle drift from applications with two different nozzles in a low speed wind tunnel, and their impact on growth and development of Amaranthus spp. Herbicide drift resulted in biomass reduction or complete plant mortality. Inflection points (distance to 50% biomass reduction) for Amaranthus tuberculatus were 7.7, 4.0, and 4.1 m downwind distance for glyphosate, 2,4-D, and dicamba applications with the flat-fan nozzle, respectively, whereas these values corresponded to 2.8, 2.5, and 1.9 m for applications with the air-inclusion nozzle. Inflection points for Amaranthus palmeri biomass reduction were 16.3, 10.9, and 11.5 m for glyphosate, 2,4-D, and dicamba applications with the flat-fan nozzle, respectively, whereas these values corresponded to 7.6, 5.4, and 5.4 m for applications with the air-inclusion nozzle. Plants were more sensitive to glyphosate at higher exposure rates than other herbicides, whereas plants were more sensitive to 2,4-D and dicamba at lower exposure rates compared to glyphosate. Applications with the flat-fan nozzle resulted in 32.3 and 11.5% drift of the applied rate at 1.0 and 3.0 m downwind, respectively, whereas the air-inclusion nozzle decreased the dose exposure in the same distances (11.4 and 2.7%, respectively). Herbicide drift towards field boundaries was influenced by nozzle design and exposed weeds to herbicide rates previously reported to select for herbicide-resistant biotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2963761329,"From the perspective of Central and South America, the peopling of the New World was a complex process lasting thousands of years and involving multiple waves of Pleistocene and early Holocene period immigrants entering into the neotropics. These Paleoindian colonists initially brought with them technologies developed for adaptation to environments and resources found in North America. As the ice age ended across the New World people adapted more generalized stone tools to exploit changing environments and resources. In the neotropics these changes would have been pronounced as patchy forests and grasslands gave way to broadleaf tropical forests. We document a late Pleistocene/early Holocene stone tool tradition from Belize, located in southern Mesoamerica. This represents the first endogenous Paleoindian stone tool technocomplex recovered from well dated stratigraphic contexts for Mesoamerica. Previously designated Lowe, these artifacts share multiple features with contemporary North and South American Paleoindian tool types. Once hafted, these bifaces appear to have served multiple functions for cutting, hooking, thrusting, or throwing. The tools were developed at a time of technological regionalization reflecting the diverse demands of a period of pronounced environmental change and population movement. Combined stratigraphic, technological, and population paleogenetic data suggests that there were strong ties between lowland neotropic regions at the onset of the Holocene."
https://openalex.org/W2964131310,"Fusarium wilt of watermelon, caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum (FON), occurs worldwide and is responsible for substantial yield losses in watermelon-producing areas of the southeastern United States. Management of this disease largely relies on the use of integrated pest management (i.e., fungicides, resistant cultivars, crop rotation, etc.). Knowledge about race structure and genetic diversity of FON in the southeastern US is limited. To determine genetic diversity of the pathogen, FON isolates were collected from symptomatic watermelon plants in commercial fields in Georgia and Florida, USA, and identified based on morphological characteristics and PCR analysis using FON-specific primers. Discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) of 99 isolates genotyped with 15 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers grouped the isolates in eight distinct clusters with two prominent clusters (clusters 1 and 8). Cluster 1 consisted of a total of 14 isolates, out of which 85.7% of the isolates were collected in Florida. However, most of the isolates (92.4%) in cluster 8 were collected in Georgia. Both DAPC and pairwise population differentiation analysis (ФPT) revealed that the genetic groups were closely associated with geographical locations of pathogen collection. Three races of FON (races 0, 2 and 3) were identified in the phenotypic analysis; with race 3 identified for the first time in Georgia. Overall, 5.1%, 38.9% and 55.9% of the isolates were identified as race 0, race 2 and race 3, respectively. The majority of the isolates in cluster 1 and cluster 8 belonged to either race 2 (35.6%) or race 3 (45.8%). Additionally, no relationship between genetic cluster assignment and races of the isolates was observed. The information obtained on genotypic and phenotypic diversity of FON in the southeastern US will help in development of effective disease management programs to combat Fusarium wilt."
https://openalex.org/W2963028780,"Objectives HIV/AIDS has become the leading cause of death by infectious disease in China since 2009. However, the trend of gender disparities in HIV/AIDS has not been reported in China since 1990. Our study aimed to explore the secular trend of HIV/AIDS mortality in China from 1990 to 2016 and to identify its gender disparities over the past 27 years. Method The mortality data of HIV/AIDS were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 (GBD 2016). Logistic regression was used to estimate the prevalence odds ratio (POR) of gender for HIV/AIDS mortality in different surveys. Results The standardized mortality of HIV/AIDS in China rose dramatically from 0.33 per 100,000 people in 1990 to 2.50 per 100,000 people in 2016. The rate of HIV/AIDS mortality increased more quickly in men than in women, and the sex gap of mortality of HIV/AIDS widened. By 2016, the HIV/AIDS mortality in men was 3 times that in women and was 5.74 times that in women within the 75- to 79-year-old age group. Conclusions The mortality of HIV/AIDS in China is increasing, with a widening gender disparity. It is critical for policymakers to develop policies to eliminate these disparities and to ensure that everyone can live a long life in full health."
https://openalex.org/W2963767814,"This paper attempts to design an automated, efficient and intelligent tomato grading method that facilitates the graded selling of the fruit. Based on machine vision, the color images of tomatoes with different morphologies were studied, and the color, shape and size were selected as the key features. On this basis, an automated grading classifier was created based on the surface features of tomatoes, and a grading platform was set up to verify the effect of the classifier. Specifically, the Hue value distributions of tomatoes with different maturities were investigated, and the Hue value ranges were determined for mature, semi-mature and immature tomatoes, producing the color classifier. Next, the first-order Fourier descriptor (1D- FD) was adopted to describe the radius sequence of tomato contour, and an equation was established to compute the irregularity of tomato contour, creating the shape classifier. After that, a linear regression equation was constructed to reflect the relationship between the transverse diameters of actual tomatoes and tomato images, and a classifier between large, medium and small tomatoes was produced based on the transverse diameter. Finally, a comprehensive tomato classifier was built based on the color, shape and size diameters. The experimental results show that the mean grading accuracy of the proposed method was 90.7%. This means our method can achieve automated real-time grading of tomatoes."
https://openalex.org/W2963463333,"Background Geospatial data are important in monitoring many aspects of healthcare development. Geographically linking health facility data with population data is an important area of public health research. Examining healthcare problems spatially and hierarchically assists with efficient resource allocation and the monitoring and evaluation of service efficacy at different levels. This paper explored methodological issues associated with geographic data linkage, and the spatial and multilevel analyses that could be considered in analysing maternal health service data. Methods The 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey and the 2014 Ethiopia Service Provision Assessment data were used. Two geographic data linking methods were used to link these two datasets. Administrative boundary link was used to link a sample of health facilities data with population survey data for analysing three areas of maternal health service use. Euclidean buffer link was used for a census of hospitals to analyse caesarean delivery use in Ethiopia. The Global Moran’s I and the Getis-Ord Gi* statistics need to be carried out for identifying hot spots of maternal health service use in ArcGIS software. In addition to this, since the two datasets contain hierarchical data, a multilevel analysis was carried out to identify key determinants of maternal health service use in Ethiopia. Results Administrative boundary link gave more types of health facilities and more maternal health services as compared to the Euclidean buffer link. Administrative boundary link is the method of choice in case of sampled health facilities. However, for a census of health facilities, the Euclidean buffer link is the appropriate choice as this provides cluster level service environment estimates, which the administrative boundary link does not. Applying a False Discovery Rate correction enables the identification of true spatial clusters of maternal health service use. Conclusions A service environment link minimizes the methodological issues associated with geographic data linkage. A False Discovery Rate correction needs to be used to account for multiple and dependent testing while carrying out local spatial statistics. Examining maternal health service use both spatially and hierarchically has tremendous importance for identifying geographic areas that need special emphasis and for intervention purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2963502484,"Background Acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are common syndromes associated with significant morbidity, mortality and cost. The extent to which repeated AKI episodes may cumulatively affect the rate of progression of all-cause CKD has not previously been investigated. In this study, we explored the hypothesis that repeated episodes of AKI increase the rate of renal functional deterioration loss in patients recruited to a large, all-cause CKD cohort. Methods Patients from the Salford Kidney Study (SKS) were considered. Application of KDIGO criteria to all available laboratory measurements of renal function identified episodes of AKI. A competing risks model was specified for four survival events: Stage 1 AKI; stage 2 or 3 AKI; dialysis initiation or transplant before AKI event; death before AKI event. The model was adjusted for patient age, gender, smoking status, alcohol intake, diabetic status, cardiovascular co-morbidities, and primary renal disease. Analyses were performed for patients’ first, second, and third or more AKI episodes. Results A total of 48,338 creatinine measurements were available for 2287 patients (median 13 measures per patient [IQR 6–26]). There was a median age of 66.8years, median eGFR of 28.4 and 31.6% had type 1 or 2 diabetes. Six hundred and forty three (28.1%) patients suffered one or more AKI events; 1000 AKI events (58% AKI 1) in total were observed over a median follow-up of 2.6 years [IQR 1.1–3.2]. In patients who suffered an AKI, a second AKI was more likely to be a stage 2 or 3 AKI than stage 1 [HR 2.04, p 0.01]. AKI events were associated with progression to RRT, with multiple episodes of AKI progressively increasing likelihood of progression to RRT [HR 14.4 after 1 episode of AKI, HR 28.4 after 2 episodes of AKI]. However, suffering one or more AKI events was not associated with an increased risk of mortality. Conclusions AKI events are associated with more rapid CKD deterioration as hypothesised, and also with a greater severity of subsequent AKI. However, our study did not find an association of AKI with increased mortality risk in this CKD cohort."
https://openalex.org/W2961218707,"Scientific research—especially high-impact research—is increasingly being performed in teams that are interdisciplinary and demographically diverse. Nevertheless, very little research has investigated how the climate on these diverse science teams affects data sharing or the experiences of their members. To address these gaps, we conducted a quantitative study of 266 scientists from 105 NSF-funded interdisciplinary environmental science teams. We examined how team climate mediates the associations between team diversity and three outcomes: satisfaction with the team, satisfaction with authorship practices, and perceptions of the frequency of data sharing. Using path analyses, we found that individuals from underrepresented groups perceived team climate more negatively, which was associated with lower satisfaction with the team and more negative perceptions of authorship practices and data sharing on the team. However, individuals on teams with more demographic diversity reported a more positive climate than those on teams with less demographic diversity. These results highlight the importance of team climate, the value of diverse teams for team climate, and barriers to the full inclusion and support of individuals from underrepresented groups in interdisciplinary science teams."
https://openalex.org/W2964018305,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of different infant feeding habits on the occurrence of malnutrition, Plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia and anaemia in children ≤5 years in the Mount Cameroon area.A total of 1227 children ≤5 years of age were recruited in a descriptive cross-sectional study. Socio demographic data and information on the different infant feeding habits was obtained by the use of semi-structured questionnaire. Nutritional status was assessed by the use of anthropometric measurements. Plasmodium was detected by light microscopy and haemoglobin was measured by use of an auto-haematology analyser. Anaemia as well as its severity was classified based on WHO standards. The associations between variables were assessed using logistic regression analysis.The prevalence of exclusive breast feeding (EBF) was 22.6%, mixed feeding (MF) was 60.1% and those not breastfed (NBF) at all was 17.3%. The prevalence of malnutrition, P. falciparum parasitaemia and anaemia was 32.6%, 30.4% and 77.3% respectively. Children who had EBF had significantly lower (P <0.001) prevalence of malaria parasite (16.2%) than those NBF at all (61.3%). The prevalence of anaemia was significantly higher (P <0.001) in children who had MF (80.5%) while, severe and moderate anaemia was highest in those NBF at all (6.6%, 67.1% respectively; P = 0.029) than their counterparts. The significant predictors of anaemia were age group (P <0.001), marital status (P <0.001) and educational level of parent (P <0.001), that for malaria parasitaemia was infant feeding habit (MF: P< 0.001 and NBF: P <0.001) and malnutrition was age group (≤2 years: P <0.008 and 2.1-4.0 years: P = 0.028).The infant feeding habit significantly influenced the occurrence of malaria parasite infection and not malnutrition and anaemia, hence EBF should be encouraged in malaria endemic zones."
https://openalex.org/W2964180227,"The purpose of our study is to assess the diagnostic performance of quantitative evaluation of tissue stiffness around lesion by Sound Touch Elastography (STE) in distinguishing between benign and malignant breast lesions. A total number of 160 breast lesions from 160 female patients were examined by STE. Resona 7 was equipped with ""shell"" function to measure elastic modulus values of tissue in the region of surrounding lesion quantitatively. The contours of the lesion were required to be delineated. The elastic modulus values of tissue in the region of 1mm, 2mm, and 3mm outside the boundary were acquired. The elastic modulus values included maximum elastic modulus (Emax), mean elastic modulus (Emean), minimum elastic modulus (Emin), and elastic modulus standard deviation (Esd). All lesions were confirmed by histopathology. We compared the differences of the above elastic modulus values between benign and malignant groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn with the histological diagnostic results as the gold standard. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated to evaluate the diagnostic performance of STE. Operator consistency was also analyzed. Among the 160 lesions, 100 (62.5%) were benign and 60 (37.5%) were malignant. In the region of 1mm, 2mm, and 3mm surrounding the lesion, Emax, Emean, and Esd of malignant group were significantly higher than those of the benign group (all P<0.05). When the ""shell"" was 3mm, Emax had the highest AUROC value (AUROC = 0.998). Regarding the measurement of elastic modulus values, all the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) values of the inter-operator consistency were greater than 0.75 for Emax, Emean, and Esd. Therefore, quantitative evaluation of tissue stiffness around lesion by STE has the potential to distinguish between benign and malignant breast lesions."

To increase accessibility, national guidelines recommend delivering diabetes prevention programmes in primary care settings, including community pharmacy. This study aimed to explore the English community pharmacy setting as an option for delivering diabetes prevention services.Two focus groups and nine semi-structured interviews were conducted with stakeholders including, community pharmacists, general practitioners and commissioners. The topic guide was framed using the COM-B theoretical model for behaviour change to elicit practitioners' capability, opportunity and motivation to engage with providing or referring to community pharmacy diabetes prevention services. Data were analysed thematically, and barriers/facilitators mapped to the COM-B framework.Five themes were identified: 'Pre-diabetes management and associated challenges', 'The community pharmacy setting', 'Awareness of community pharmacy services', 'Relationships and communication' and 'Delivery of community pharmacy services'. Community pharmacy was highlighted as an accessible setting for delivering screening and follow-on lifestyle interventions. Key factors for enhancing the capability of community pharmacy teams to deliver the interventions included training and appropriate use of skill mix. Delivering diabetes prevention services in collaboration with general practices was identified as key to the provision of integrated primary care services. Whilst financial incentives were identified as a motivating factor for delivery, service promotion to patients, public and healthcare professionals was perceived as crucial for enhancing engagement.This research highlights a role for community pharmacy in diabetes prevention. New service models should seek to integrate community pharmacy services in primary care to facilitate patient engagement and better communication with general practices."
https://openalex.org/W2963703116,"Philadelphia chromosome-like (Ph-like) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a genetically heterogeneous subtype of B-cell ALL characterized by chromosomal rearrangements and mutations that result in aberrant cytokine receptor and kinase signaling. In particular, chromosomal rearrangements resulting in the overexpression of cytokine receptor-like factor 2 (CRLF2) occur in 50% of Ph-like ALL cases. CRLF2 overexpression is associated with particularly poor clinical outcomes, though the molecular basis for this is currently unknown. Glucocorticoids (GCs) are integral to the treatment of ALL and GC resistance at diagnosis is an important negative prognostic factor. Given the importance of GCs in ALL therapy and the poor outcomes for patients with CRLF2 overexpression, we hypothesized that the aberrant signal transduction associated with CRLF2 overexpression might mediate intrinsic GC insensitivity. To test this hypothesis, we exposed Ph-like ALL cells from patient-derived xenografts to GCs and found that CRLF2 rearranged (CRLF2R) leukemias uniformly demonstrated reduced GC sensitivity in vitro. Furthermore, targeted inhibition of signal transduction with the MEK inhibitor trametinib and the Akt inhibitor MK2206, but not the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib, was sufficient to augment GC sensitivity. These data suggest that suboptimal GC responses may in part underlie the poor clinical outcomes for patients with CRLF2 overexpression and provide rationale for combination therapy involving GCs and signal transduction inhibitors as a means of enhancing GC efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2959822804,"In this study we analyzed the microbiota composition of fecal samples from the lesser-long nosed bat Leptonycteris yerbabuenae in different reproductive stages (juveniles and adult bats of both sexes as well as pregnant and lactating females). The V4 region of the 16s rRNA gene from 33 individuals was analyzed using alpha and beta diversity metrics. We found that microbiota diversity (expressed in Amplicon Sequence Variants) is higher in pregnant and lactating females. The microbiota of the juveniles and non-reproductive adults was dominated by Gammaproteobacteria and Firmicutes. Reproductive females had a much more diverse microbiota, with a significant increase in phyla such as Bacteroidetes and Alphaproteobacteria. There was no difference in fecal microbiota diversity between pregnant and lactating females and juveniles and non-reproductive adults. Results suggest that differences in microbiota diversity are related to reproduction. We infer that males maintain stable microbiota composition because they do not undergo the large physiological changes that females do during reproduction and maintain a more specialized diet throughout all life stages."
https://openalex.org/W2964143624,"The snow crab (Chioneocetes opilio) fishery in the Barents Sea is carried out by large offshore vessels, as the fishing grounds are located far from shore and the gear must be transported back and forth over long distances. Therefore, fishers use stackable conical pots that allow large numbers of pots to be carried on deck for each trip. One of the drawbacks of using stackable pots is that the entrance is at the vertex of the conical pot, which fishers claim does not provide the desired fishing efficiency. Thus, the goal of this study was to determine whether a different pot design would improve the catch efficiency of snow crabs. We investigated the efficiency of a new type of pot called the moon pot, which provides continuous increased bait odour intensity as snow crabs make their way towards the entrance of the pot. This alteration was expected to increase catch efficiency compared to that of the conical pots used by the fleet today. However, experimental fishing results showed that the modified pots had significantly lower catch efficiency than the standard conical pots, as only ~66% of the number of crabs caught by the conical pots were caught in the moon pots. The main reason for this reduced catch efficiency likely was the initial steepness of the moon pot, which may have made it difficult for crabs to reach the pot entrance. These results demonstrated that pot design can dramatically affect catch efficiency of snow crabs."
https://openalex.org/W2961797851,"Long-term growth in HIV-infected infants treated early in resource-limited settings is poorly documented. Incidence of growth retardation, instantaneous risk of death related to malnutrition and growth parameters evolution during the first five years of life of uninfected and early treated HIV-infected children were compared and associated factors with growth retardation were identified.Weight-for-age (WAZ), weight-for-length (WLZ), and length-for-age (LAZ) Z-scores were calculated. The ANRS-PEDIACAM cohort includes four groups of infants with three enrolled during the first week of life: HIV-infected (HI, n = 69), HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU, n = 205) and HIV-unexposed uninfected (HUU, n = 196). The last group included HIV-infected infants diagnosed before 7 months of age (HIL, n = 141). The multi-state Markov model was used to describe the incidence of growth retardation and identified associated factors.During the first 5 years, 27.5% of children experienced underweight (WAZ<-2), 60.4% stunting (LAZ<-2) and 41.1% wasting (WLZ<-2) at least once. The instantaneous risk of death observed from underweight state (35.3 [14.1-88.2], 84.0 [25.5-276.3], and 6.0 [1.5-24.1] per 1000 person-months for 0-6 months, 6-12 months, and 12-60 months respectively) was higher than from non-underweight state (9.6 [5.7-16.1], 20.1 [10.3-39.4] and 0.3 [0.1-0.9] per 1000 person-months). Compared to HEU, HIL and HI children were most at risk of wasting (adjusted HR (aHR) = 4.3 (95%CI: 1.9-9.8), P<0.001 and aHR = 3.3 (95%CI: 1.4-7.9), P = 0.01 respectively) and stunting for HIL (aHR = 8.4 (95%CI: 2.4-29.7). The risk of underweight was higher in HEU compared to HUU children (aHR = 5.0 (CI: 1.4-10.0), P = 0.001). Others associated factors to growth retardation were chronic pathologies, small size at birth, diarrhea and CD4< 25%.HIV-infected children remained at high risk of wasting and stunting within the first 5 years period of follow-up. There is a need of identifying suitable nutritional support and best ways to integrate it with cART in pediatric HIV infection global care."
https://openalex.org/W2962858477,"Comparative studies in Xanthomonas have provided a vast amount of data that enabled to deepen in the knowledge of those factors associated with virulence and Xanthomonas plant interaction. The species of this genus present a wide range of host plants and a large number of studies have been focused to elucidate which mechanism are involved in this characteristic. In this study, comparative genomic and phenotypic analysis were performed between X. citri subsp. citri (Xcc), one of the most studied pathogens within Xanthomonas, and X. arboricola pv. pruni (Xap), a pathogen which has aroused great interest in recent time. The work was aimed to find those elements that contribute to their host divergence despite the convergence in the symptoms that each species cause on Citrus spp. and Prunus spp., respectively. This study reveals a set of genes that could be putatively associated with the adaptation of these pathogens to their hosts, being the most remarkable those involved in environmental sensing systems such as the case of the TonB-dependent transporters, the sensors of the two-component system and the methyl accepting chemotaxis proteins. Other important variants were found in processes related to the decomposition of the cell wall as could be appreciated by their dissimilar set of cell-wall degrading enzymes. Type three effectors, as one of the most important factors in delineating the host specificity in Xanthomonas, also showed a different array when comparing both species, being some of them unique to each pathogen. On the other hand, only small variations could be connected to other features such as the motility appendages and surface adhesion proteins, but these differences were accompanied by a dissimilar capacity to attach on host and non-host leaf surface. The molecular factors found in this work provide the basis to perform a more in-depth functional analyses that unveil those actual factors associated with pathogenesis and host specificity in Xcc and Xap."
https://openalex.org/W2963510170,"Background Anxiety and depressive disorders are increasingly being viewed as chronic conditions with fluctuating symptom levels. Relapse prevention programmes are needed to increase self-management and prevent relapse. Fine-tuning relapse prevention programmes to the needs of patients may increase uptake and effectiveness. Materials and methods A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted amongst patients with a partially or fully remitted anxiety or depressive disorder. Patients were presented 20 choice tasks with two hypothetical treatment scenarios for relapse prevention, plus a “no treatment” option. Each treatment scenario was based on seven attributes of a hypothetical but realistic relapse prevention programme. Attributes considered professional contact frequency, treatment type, delivery mode, programme flexibility, a personal relapse prevention plan, time investment and effectiveness. Choice models were estimated to analyse the data. Results A total of 109 patients with a partially or fully remitted anxiety or depressive disorder completed the DCE. Attributes with the strongest impact on choice were high effectiveness, regular contact with a professional, low time investment and the inclusion of a personal prevention plan. A high heterogeneity in preferences was observed, related to both clinical and demographic characteristics: for example, a higher number of previous treatment episodes was related to a preference for a higher frequency of contact with a professional, while younger age was related to a stronger preference for high effectiveness. Conclusions This study using a DCE provides insights into preferences for a relapse prevention programme for anxiety and depressive disorders that can be used to guide the development of such a programme."
https://openalex.org/W2962886510,"One of the earliest steps during the development of the nervous system is the establishment of neuronal polarity and the formation of an axon. The intrinsic mechanisms that promote axon formation have been extensively analyzed. However, much less is known about the extrinsic signals that initiate axon formation. One of the candidates for these signals is Insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1) that acts through the Igf1 (Igf1R) and insulin receptors (InsR). Since Igf1R and InsR may act redundantly we analyzed conditional cortex-specific knockout mice that are deficient for both Igf1r and Insr to determine if they regulate the development of the cortex and the formation of axons in vivo. Our results show that Igf1R/InsR function is required for the normal development of the embryonic hippocampus and cingulate cortex while the lateral cortex does not show apparent defects in the Igf1r;Insr knockout. In the cingulate cortex, the number of intermediate progenitors and deep layer neurons is reduced and the corpus callosum is absent at E17. However, cortical organization and axon formation are not impaired in knockout embryos. In culture, cortical and hippocampal neurons from Igf1r;Insr knockout embryos extend an axon but the length of this axon is severely reduced. Our results indicate that Igf1R/InsR function is required for brain development in a region-specific manner and promotes axon growth but is not essential for neuronal polarization and migration in the developing brain."
https://openalex.org/W2964214702,"The spatial organization of DNA is mediated by the Par protein system in some bacteria. ParB binds specifically to the parS sequence on DNA and orchestrates its motion by interacting with ParA bound to the nucleoid. In the case of plasmids, a single ParB bound plasmid is observed to execute oscillations between cell poles while multiple plasmids eventually settle at equal distances from each other along the cell’s length. While the potential mechanism underlying the ParA-ParB interaction has been discussed, it remains unclear whether ParB-complex oscillations are stable limit cycles or merely decaying transients to a fixed point. How are dynamics affected by substrate length and the number of complexes? We present a deterministic model for ParA-ParB driven DNA segregation where the transition between stable arrangements and oscillatory behaviour depends only on five parameters: ParB-complex number, substrate length, ParA concentration, ParA hydrolysis rate and the ratio of the lengthscale over which the ParB complex stimulates ParA hydrolysis to the lengthscale over which ParA interacts with the ParB complex. When the system is buffered and the ParA rebinding rate is constant we find that ParB-complex dynamics is independent of substrate length and complex number above a minimum system size. Conversely, when ParA resources are limited, we find that changing substrate length and increasing complex number leads to counteracting mechanisms that can both generate or subdue oscillatory dynamics. We argue that cells may be poised near a critical level of ParA so that they can transition from oscillatory to fixed point dynamics as the cell cycle progresses so that they can both measure their size and faithfully partition their genetic material. Lastly, we show that by modifying the availability of ParA or depletion zone size, we can capture some of the observed differences in ParB-complex positioning between replicating chromosomes in B. subtilis cells and low-copy plasmids in E. coli cells."
https://openalex.org/W2961284279,"Coal and gas outburst is a common coal-rock dynamic disaster. Such accidents frequently occur, and the mechanism underlying the occurrence of these outbursts is complex. As a typical failure mode of a gas-filled and pressure-relieved coal body, the spallation mechanism should be investigated to reveal the mechanism of coal and gas outburst and guide outburst-prevention strategies. In this paper, a fluid-solid coupling model for coal seam gas flow is established. This model considers the adsorption characteristics of coal. Numerical calculations are used to simulate the stress field distribution and evolution of gas-filled coal bodies under different boundary conditions. The mechanical mechanism of the spallation occurrence after the pressure relief of coal is explained from the perspective of seepage breaking coal. The control of the flow and stress state of the gas to the spallation failure is analyzed. The mechanical-quantitative conditions for the initial failure of the coal body under seepage and the mechanical-qualitative conditions for the continuous advancement and termination of spallation are studied based on numerical solution results. The numerical calculation results show that the formation of a flow field after pressure relief will apply a drag force (tensile stress) on the porous media of coal. The presence of this force plays a crucial role in promoting the spallation and cracking of coal and, thus, the promotion of spallation. The tensile strength, initial adsorption pressure, and pressure relief rate of the coal body jointly control whether the initial failure can occur and the thickness of the fracture layer cracks. Spallation propulsion is mainly determined by the pressure relief conditions of the undestroyed coal body and pressure changes in the spallation space; the former can be quantitatively obtained by numerical calculations, whereas the latter is related to the thickness of the spalled layer and the degree of the layer-crack structure."
https://openalex.org/W2962786972,"Aim Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are at high risk of developing CF-related diabetes (CFRD). In non-CF patients, liver disease, specifically steatosis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is strongly associated with type 2 diabetes. We compared glycemic status and metabolic profiles in CF patients according to a biomarker of hepatic injury, alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study among 273 adult CF patients recruited from the Montreal CF Cohort. A 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed to collect glucose and insulin measures every 30 minutes. Fasting ALT levels and anthropometric measures were also obtained. Patients were categorized into 2 groups based on ALT cut-off of 25 U/L. Results Patients in the high ALT group were mostly men (83%), had higher mean weight and BMI (p<0.001) and showed elevated glucose levels throughout OGTT (p≤0.01). When stratified by sex, only men with high ALT showed significantly higher weight (p<0.001), higher glycemic values at 60, 90 and 120 minutes of OGTT (p≤0.01), higher frequency of de novo CFRD (20.5% vs 8.2%, p = 0.04) as well as lower insulin sensitivity than men with normal ALT (p = 0.03). ALT levels were strongly associated with HOMA-IR in CFRD patients (p = 0.001, r2 = 0.28). Conclusions Adult CF men with higher ALT show an increased frequency of dysglycemia and de novo CFRD, lower insulin sensitivity and higher eight. Our data suggests that ALT levels could be an interesting tool to guide targeted diabetes screening, particularly among CF men. Prospective studies are needed to confirm these observations."

The objective of this study was to analyse possible risk factors for increased TSH that could distort its validity as a marker of iodine status. The clinical relevance of this research question is that if the factors associated with iodine deficiency are known, iodine supplementation can be introduced in risk groups, both during pregnancy and in newborns.A case-control study was carried out in a sample of 46,622 newborns in 2002-2015 in Spain. Of these, 45,326 had a neonatal TSH value ≥5 mIU/L. The main variable was having TSH ≥5 mIU/L and the secondary variables were: sex, gestational age, day of sample extraction and maternal origin. Associated factors were analysed through a logistic regression model, calculating the odds ratio (OR).The factors associated with this outcome were: male sex (OR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.20-1.50, p<0.001), originating from an Asian/Oceanic country (OR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.54-1.20, p = 0.536) or Europe (OR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.66-0.96, p = 0.285) (including Spain, OR = 1) [p<0.001 for America (OR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.44-0.68) and p = 0.025 for Africa (OR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.62-0.97)] and fewer days from birth to sampling (OR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.77-0.82, p<0.001).The risk of high neonatal TSH without congenital hypothyroidism is higher in males, decreases with a greater number of days from birth to extraction, and is dependent on maternal ethnicity but not on gestational age."

It was necessary to obtain more comprehensive data about the relationships between the lateral mass, pedicle, and transverse foramen for cervical pedicle screwing (CPS) and paravertebral foramen screwing (PVFS), a new technique. The purpose of this study was to describe the relationships between the lateral mass, pedicle, and transverse foramen. This study analyzed computed tomography images from 77 patients (42 female, 35 male; mean age: 63.95 years). The anatomical pedicle transverse angle (PTA) and linear parameters of the lateral mass were measured, and the relationship between the calculated angles and the anatomical PTA was investigated. θp was defined as the convergence angle from the posterolateral edge of the lateral mass to the pedicle, and θc was defined as the convergence angle from the posterolateral edge of the lateral mass to the anterolateral corner of the vertebral foramen. The thickness of the cortical bone of the medial wall of the lateral mass (cT) and the medial (mT) and lateral (lT) walls of the pedicle at C3–7 were also measured. The PTA was similar to θp and θc at C3–6, but different at C7. In all cases, the transverse foramen was located more anterior to the posterior wall of the cervical body at C3–6, but not at C7. mT and cT were significantly thicker than lT at all levels. Lateral fluoroscopic images show that when the probe is inserted along θc, it meets the counter corner of the lateral mass at C3–6 without invasion of the transverse foramen if it does not cross the posterior wall of the vertebral body. This can be significant when performing CPS and PVFS."
https://openalex.org/W2963521154,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-protein coding RNAs and post-transcriptionally regulate cellular gene expression. In animal development, miRNAs play essential roles such as stem cell maintenance, organogenesis, and apoptosis. Using gain-of-function (GOF) screening with 160 miRNA lines in Drosophila melanogaster, we identified a set of miRNAs which regulates body fat contents and named them microCATs (microRNAs Controlling Adipose Tissue). Further examination of egg-to-adult developmental kinetics of selected miRNA lines showed a negative correlation between fat content and developmental time. Comparison of microCATs with loss-of-function miRNA screening data uncovered miR-969 as an essential regulator of adiposity. Subsequently, we demonstrated adipose tissue-specific knock-down of gustatory receptor 47b (Gr47b), a miR-969 target, greatly reduced the amount of body fat, recapitulating the miR-969 GOF phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2963680999,"Gene-environment (GxE) interaction is one potential explanation for the missing heritability problem. A popular approach to genome-wide environment interaction studies (GWEIS) is based on regression models involving interactions between genetic variants and environment variables. Unfortunately, GWEIS encounters systematically inflated (or deflated) test statistics more frequently than a marginal association study. The problematic behavior may occur due to poor specification of the null model (i.e. the model without genetic effect) in GWEIS. Improved null model specification may resolve the problem, but the investigation requires many time-consuming analyses of genome-wide scans, e.g. by trying out several transformations of the phenotype. It is therefore helpful if we can predict such problematic behavior beforehand. We present a simple closed-form formula to assess problematic behavior of GWEIS under the null hypothesis of no genetic effects. It requires only phenotype, environment variables, and covariates, enabling quick identification of systematic test statistic inflation or deflation. Applied to real data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), our formula identified problematic studies from among hundreds GWEIS considering each metabolite as the environment variable in GxE interaction. Our formula is useful to quickly identify problematic GWEIS without requiring a genome-wide scan."
https://openalex.org/W2963777281,"Mathematical models of the natural history of disease can predict incidence rates based on prevalence data and support simulations of populations where thyroid function affects other aspects of physiology. We developed a Markov chain model of functional thyroid disease status over the lifetime. Subjects were in one of seven thyroid disease states at any given point in their lives [normal, subclinical hypothyroidism, overt hypothyroidism, treated thyroid disease (ever), subclinical hyperthyroidism, overt hyperthyroidism, and reverted to normal thyroid status]. We used a Bayesian approach to fitting model parameters. A priori probabilities of changing from each disease state to another per unit time were based on published data and summarized using meta-analysis, when possible. The probabilities of changing state were fitted to observed prevalence data based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007-2012. The fitted model provided a satisfactory fit to the observed prevalence data for each disease state, by sex and decade of age. For example, for males 50-59 years old, the observed prevalence of ever having treated thyroid disease was 4.4% and the predicted value was 4.6%. Comparing the incidence rates of treated disease predicted from our model with published values revealed that 82% were within a 4-fold difference. The differences seemed to be systematic and were consistent with expectation based on national iodine intakes. The model provided new and comprehensive estimates of functional thyroid disease incidence rates for the U.S. Because the model provides a reasonable fit to national prevalence data and predicts thyroid disease status over the lifetime, it is suitable for simulating populations, thereby making possible quantitative bias analyses of selected epidemiologic data reporting an association of thyroid disease with serum concentrations of environmental contaminants."

Previously, overexpression of muscarinic M2 receptors and acetylcholinesterase was found in particular in the heart and in lymphocytes of rabbits with vagal overactivity as well as in hearts of Sudden Infant Death Syndromes. The aim of this present study was to look at M2 receptor expression in blood of patients with reflex syncope. The second objective was to measure acetylcholinesterase expression in these patients. Methods and results 136 subjects were enrolled. This monocenter study pooled 45 adults exhibiting recurrent reflex syncope compared with 32 healthy adult volunteers (18–50 years) and 38 children exhibiting reflex syncope requiring hospitalization compared with 21 controls (1–17 years). One blood sample was taken from each subject and blood mRNA expression of M2 receptors was assessed by qRT-PCR. Taking into account the non-symmetric distributions of values in both groups, statistical interferences were assessed using bayesian techniques. A M2 receptor overexpression was observed in adult and pediatric patients compared to controls. The medians [q1;q3] were 0.9 [0.3;1.9] in patients versus 0.2 [0.1;1.0] in controls; the probability that M2 receptor expression was higher in patients than in controls (Pr[patients>controls]) was estimated at 0.99. Acetylcholinesterase expression was also increased 0.7 [0.4;1.6] in patients versus 0.4 [0.2;1.1] in controls; the probability that acetylcholinesterase expression was higher in patients than in controls (Pr[patients>controls]) was estimated at 0.97. Both in adults and children, the expression ratio of M2 receptors over acetylcholinesterase was greater in the patient group compared with the control group. Conclusion M2 receptor overexpression has been detected in the blood of both, adults and children, exhibiting reflex syncope. As in our experimental model, i.e. rabbits with vagal overactivity, acetylcholinesterase overexpression was associated with M2 receptor overexpression. For the first time, biological abnormalities are identified in vagal syncope in which only clinical signs are, so far, taken into account for differential diagnosis and therapeutic management. Further work will be needed to validate potential biomarkers of risk or severity associated with the cholinergic system."
https://openalex.org/W2964004285,"Although people with a psychotic disorder are approximately four to six times more often victimized than the general population, victimization is not routinely assessed in mental healthcare. This study investigates prevalence, context and risk factors of victimization in patients with a psychotic disorder in the Northern, relatively rural region of the Netherlands. Moreover, disclosure rates and awareness of psychiatrists are examined.Information on personal crime (threats, assaults and sexual violence), property and other forms of crime, the context of victimization and disclosure was routinely assessed in 353 patients with a psychotic disorder who received care at a mental health facility. In addition, involved psychiatrists reported on last year's victimization incidents in their patients.One third of the patients reported victimization in the previous year. More than half of the crimes were committed by someone acquainted and took place in the victim's own home or a place familiar to the victim. Younger age, having a comorbid disorder, drug use and perpetration of a crime were all positively associated with victimization. Approximately half of the reported personal crimes were disclosed to a health care professional but only in 16% of the cases the involved psychiatrist report to know about the incident.This study confirms that people with a history of psychosis have an increased risk of becoming the victim of a crime. Although our results suggest that in fifty percent of cases the patients did share the information with professionals, a substantial proportion of incidents appear to go still unnoticed."
https://openalex.org/W2962708448,"This paper investigates a particular type of non-canonical construction in Mandarin Chinese displaying an apparent semantics-syntax mismatch. We conducted an acceptability judgment experiment on native Mandarin speakers to evaluate whether such sequences could stand out of context as acceptable fragments. Analyses on experimental results revealed that: both semantic and syntactic acceptability of these sequences were significantly lower than those of canonical nominal classifier phrases; whereas if contextualized, the syntactic acceptability of those sequences became similar to that of canonical nominal phrases. This suggests that the non-canonical sequences are grammatically not on the same footing as canonical expressions; and it is the sentential context that makes these sequences appear structurally well-formed. These findings contribute to general discussions on relationship between constituency and grammaticality by demonstrating the gradient nature of grammaticality, and advocate a dynamic perspective in linguistic analysis that looks at a sequence of words in interaction with other elements in a sentence."
https://openalex.org/W2962915638,"We describe a network-based method to obtain a subset of representative variables from clinical data of subjects of the second Singapore Longitudinal Aging Study (SLAS-2), while preserving to a good extent the predictive performance of the full set with regards to a multi-faceted index of successful aging, SAGE. To examine differences in predictive performance of high-degree nodes (“hubs”) and high-centrality ones (“cores”), we implement four subsetting strategies (two degree-based, two centrality-based) and obtain four surrogate sets of variables, which we use as input features for machine learning models to predict the SAGE index of subjects. All four models have variables belonging to the physical, cardiovascular, cognitive and immunological domains among their fifteen most important predictors. A fifth domain (leisure-time activities, LTA) is also present in some form. From a comparison of the surrogate sets’ size and predictive performance, a centrality-based approach (selection of the most central variable-nodes within each cluster) yielded the smallest-sized surrogate set, while having high prediction accuracy (measured by its model’s area-under-curve, AUC) in comparison to its analogous degree-based strategy (selection of the highest-degree nodes per cluster). Inclusion of the next most-central variables yielded negligible changes in predictive performance while more than doubling the surrogate set size. The centrality-based approach thus yields a surrogate set which offers a good balance between number of variables and prediction performance, and can act as a representative subset of the SLAS-2 clinical dataset."
https://openalex.org/W2956553438,"The identification of risk factors for acute rejection (AR) may lead to strategies to improve success of kidney transplantation. Ectonucleotidases are ectoenzymes that hydrolyze extracellular nucleotides into nucleosides, modulating the purinergic signaling. Some members of the Ectonucleotidase family have been linked to transplant rejection processes. However, the association of Ectonucleotide Pyrophosphatase / Phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1) with AR has not yet been evaluated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between the K121Q polymorphism of ENPP1 gene and AR in kidney transplant patients. We analyzed 449 subjects without AR and 98 with AR from a retrospective cohort of kidney transplant patients from Southern Brazil. K121Q polymorphism was genotyped using allelic discrimination-real-time PCR. Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate freedom of AR in kidney transplant patients according to genotypes. Q allele frequency was 17.6% in recipients without AR and 21.9% in those with AR (P = 0.209). Genotype frequencies of the K121Q polymorphism were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in non-AR patients (P = 0.70). The Q/Q genotype (recessive model) was associated with AR (HR = 2.83, 95% CI 1.08-7.45; P = 0.034) after adjusting for confounders factors. Our findings suggest a novel association between the ENPP1 121Q/Q genotype and AR in kidney transplant recipients."
https://openalex.org/W2962977835,"Nucleotides ratcheted through the biomolecular pores of nanopore sequencers generate raw picoamperage currents, which are segmented into step-current level signals representing the nucleotide sequence. These ‘squiggles’ are a noisy, distorted representation of the underlying true stepped current levels due to experimental and algorithmic factors. We were interested in developing a simulation model to support a white-box approach to identify common distortions, rather than relying on commonly used black box neural network techniques for basecalling nanopore signals. Dynamic time warped-space averaging (DTWA) techniques can generate a consensus from multiple noisy signals without introducing key feature distortions that occur with standard averaging. As a preprocessing tool, DTWA could provide cleaner and more accurate current signals for direct RNA or DNA analysis tools. However, DTWA approaches need modification to take advantage of the a-priori knowledge regarding a common, underlying gold-standard RNA / DNA sequence. Using experimental data, we derive a simulation model to provide known squiggle distortion signals to assist in validating the performance of analysis tools such as DTWA. Simulation models were evaluated by comparing mocked and experimental squiggle characteristics from one Enolase mRNA squiggle group produced by an Oxford MinION nanopore sequencer, and cross-validated using other Enolase, Sequin R1_71_1 and Sequin R2_55_3 mRNA studies. New techniques identified high inserted but low deleted base rates, generating consistent x1.7 squiggle event to base called ratios. Similar probability density and cumulative distribution functions, PDF and CDF, were found across all studies. Experimental PDFs were not the normal distributions expected if squiggle distortion arose from segmentation algorithm artefacts, or through individual nucleotides randomly interacting with individual nanopores. Matching experimental and mocked CDFs required the assumption that there are unique features associated with individual raw-current data streams. Z-normalized signal-to-noise ratios suggest intrinsic sensor limitations being responsible for half the gold standard and noisy squiggle DTW differences."
https://openalex.org/W2963052783,"Despite being a key concept in rehabilitation, controlling weight-bearing load while walking, following lower limb injury is very hard to achieve. Walking in water provides an opportunity to prescribe load for people who have pain, weakness or weight bearing restrictions related to stages of healing. The aim of this experimental study was to evaluate and validate regression models for predicting ground reaction forces while walking in water. One hundred and thirty seven individuals (24±5 years, 1.71±0.08 m and 68.7±12.5 kg) were randomly assigned to a regression group (n = 113) and a validation group (n = 24). Trials were performed at a randomly assigned water depth (0.75 to 1.35 m), and at a self-selected speed. Independent variables were: immersion ratio, velocity, body mass, and waist, thigh and leg circumferences. Stepwise regression was used for the prediction of ground reaction forces and validation included agreement and consistency statistical analyses. Data from a force plate were compared with predicted data from the created model in the validation group. Body mass, immersion ratio, and velocity independently predicted 95% of the vertical and resultant ground reaction force variability, while, together, velocity and thigh circumference explained 81% of antero-posterior ground reaction force variability. When tested against the data measured in validation samples, the models output resulted in statistically similar values, intraclass correlation coefficients ranging from 0.88 to 0.90 and standard errors of measurement, 11.8 to 42.3 N. The models introduced in this study showed good predictive performance in our evaluation procedures and may be considered valid in the prediction of vertical, antero-posterior and resultant ground reaction forces while walking in water. All predictive variables can be easily determined in clinical practice. Future studies should focus on the validation of these models in specific populations."
