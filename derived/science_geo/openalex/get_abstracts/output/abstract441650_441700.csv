https://openalex.org/W2136503478,"Concentrations of acetyl-coenzyme A and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) affect histone acetylation and thereby couple cellular metabolic status and transcriptional regulation. We report that the ketone body d-β-hydroxybutyrate (βOHB) is an endogenous and specific inhibitor of class I histone deacetylases (HDACs). Administration of exogenous βOHB, or fasting or calorie restriction, two conditions associated with increased βOHB abundance, all increased global histone acetylation in mouse tissues. Inhibition of HDAC by βOHB was correlated with global changes in transcription, including that of the genes encoding oxidative stress resistance factors FOXO3A and MT2. Treatment of cells with βOHB increased histone acetylation at the Foxo3a and Mt2 promoters, and both genes were activated by selective depletion of HDAC1 and HDAC2. Consistent with increased FOXO3A and MT2 activity, treatment of mice with βOHB conferred substantial protection against oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2073453074,"Epigenetic Controls Germ cells in mammals give rise to sperm and eggs. During their development, germ cells undergo extensive epigenetic reprogramming, including global DNA demethylation, which is vital for the totipotency of the developing embryo. Hackett et al. (p. 448 ) show that the enzymes Tet1 and Tet2 are involved in the demethylation of individual genes and in imprinted gametic differentially methylated regions. The enzymes were also responsible for the global conversion of CpG methylation to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, which then progressively declines. The findings suggest that demethylation can occur by replication-coupled dilution, although active mechanisms cannot be excluded. A small number of loci escape demethylation, providing a possible mechanistic basis for transgenerational inheritance."

Proinflammatory, M1 phenotype macrophages and the c-jun NH 2 terminal kinases (JNK) are central players in this process. But whether JNK expression is specifically required inside macrophages is unclear. In mice containing a macrophage-specific deletion in both Jnk1 and Jnk2 , Han et al. (p. 218 , published online 6 December; see the Perspective by Ferrante Jr. ) found that the mice were protected against many of the diet-induced metabolic changes, including insulin resistance, despite similar weight gain as control mice on a high-fat diet. This protection was associated with a decrease in the presence of M1 macrophages in adipose tissue."

To avoid this problem, atomic-layer deposition (ALD) can be used whereby alternating self-termination reactions stop the layer growth. Electrochemical approaches to ALD use surface alloys to slow film growth, but often lead to film contamination. Yihua Liu et al. (p. 1327 ; see the Perspective by Switzer ) show that for platinum films, controlling surface potential can lead to adsorbed hydrogen on the surface, which can terminate film growth at one layer, leaving platinum species in solution available for further reduction. Rapid changes in applied potential can oxidize the hydrogen, which allows efficient contamination-free growth of an additional atomic layer."

Similar pathways—which can be mutagenic—are known in yeast and human cells and have the potential to accelerate evolution. Sixteen proteins are known to be required for the pathway in E. coli. Al Mamun et al. (p. 1344 ) analyzed the E. coli pathway to determine the full complement of protein contributions to the pathway. Ninety-three genes were found to be required for stress-induced DNA break repair. One-third of the proteins identified in the network were involved in electron transfer, functioning in oxidative phosphorylation, and acting through the σ s stress response pathway, which thus represents a critical hub in the network."

The beneficial effects of exercise are mediated in large part by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator (PGC) 1α, whereas its loss correlates with propagation of local and systemic inflammatory markers. We examined the influence of PGC-1α and the related PGC-1β on inflammatory cytokines upon stimulation of muscle cells with TNFα, Toll-like receptor agonists, and free fatty acids. PGC-1s differentially repressed expression of proinflammatory cytokines by targeting NF-κB signaling. Interestingly, PGC-1α and PGC-1β both reduced phoshorylation of the NF-κB family member p65 and thereby its transcriptional activation potential. Taken together, the data presented here show that the PGC-1 coactivators are able to constrain inflammatory events in muscle cells and provide a molecular link between metabolic and immune pathways. The PGC-1s therefore represent attractive targets to not only improve metabolic health in diseases like type 2 diabetes but also to limit the detrimental, low-grade inflammation in these patients.Background: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1 (PGC) α and PGC-1β are metabolic coactivators that are dysregulated in muscle in many chronic diseases.Results: PGC-1α and PGC-1β differentially suppress expression of proinflammatory cytokines induced by various stimuli.Conclusion: In muscle cells, PGC-1α and PGC-1β modulate the NF-κB pathway thus profoundly affecting inflammatory processes.Significance: Targeting PGC-1α and PGC-1β in chronic diseases might reduce inflammation and thereby reverse disease progression.

https://openalex.org/W1979209913,"Platelets restrict the growth of intraerythrocytic malaria parasites by binding to parasitized cells and killing the parasite within. Here, we show that the platelet molecule platelet factor 4 (PF4 or CXCL4) and the erythrocyte Duffy-antigen receptor (Fy) are necessary for platelet-mediated killing of Plasmodium falciparum parasites. PF4 is released by platelets on contact with parasitized red cells, and the protein directly kills intraerythrocytic parasites. This function for PF4 is critically dependent on Fy, which binds PF4. Genetic disruption of Fy expression inhibits binding of PF4 to parasitized cells and concomitantly prevents parasite killing by both human platelets and recombinant human PF4. The protective function afforded by platelets during a malarial infection may therefore be compromised in Duffy-negative individuals, who do not express Fy."

These probes achieve maximum enhancement only in the tip-substrate gap mode, which can yield large near-field signals, but only for a metallic substrate and for very small tip-substrate gap distances. Bao et al. (p. 1317 ) designed a probe that unites broadband field enhancement and confinement with bidirectional coupling between far-field and near-field electromagnetic energy. Their tips primarily rely on the internal gap modes of the tip itself, thereby enabling it to image nonmetallic samples."

https://openalex.org/W1995082852,"T cells mediate the inflammatory responses observed in asthma among genetically susceptible individuals and have been suspected to be prone to epigenetic regulation. However, these relationships are not well established from past clinical studies that have had limited capacity to control for the effects of variable genetic predisposition and early environmental exposures. Relying on a cohort of monozygotic twins discordant for asthma we sought to determine if epigenetic modifications in T cells were associated with current asthma and explored whether such modifications were associated with second hand smoke exposures. Our study was conducted in a monozygotic twin cohort of adult twin pairs (n = 21) all discordant for asthma. Regulatory T cell (Treg) and effector T cell (Teff) subsets were assessed for levels of cellular function, protein expression, gene expression and CpG methylation within Forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) and interferon gamma-γ (IFNγ) loci. Comparisons by asthma and current report of exposure to second hand smoke were made. Treg from asthmatic discordant twins demonstrated decreased FOXP3 protein expression and impaired Treg function that was associated with increased levels of CpG methylation within the FOXP3 locus when compared to their non-asthmatic twin partner. In parallel, Teff from discordant asthmatic twins demonstrated increased methylation of the IFNγ locus, decreased IFNγ expression and reduced Teff function when compared to Teff from the non-asthmatic twin. Finally, report of current exposure to second hand smoke was associated with modifications in both Treg and Teff at the transcriptional level among asthmatics. The results of the current study provide evidence for differential function of T cell subsets in monozygotic twins discordant for asthma that are regulated by changes in DNA methylation. Our preliminary data suggest exposure to second hand smoke may augment the modified T cell responses associated with asthma."

This phase II study was conducted by the SWOG cooperative group to evaluate the efficacy of sorafenib in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel (CP) in metastatic uveal melanoma.Twenty-five patients with stage IV uveal melanoma who had received 0-1 prior systemic therapy were enrolled. Treatment included up to 6 cycles of carboplatin (AUC = 6) and paclitaxel (225 mg/m(2)) administered IV on day 1 plus sorafenib (400 mg PO twice daily), followed by sorafenib monotherapy until disease progression. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR); a two-stage design was used with the study to be terminated if no confirmed responses were observed in the first 20 evaluable patients. Secondary efficacy endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).No confirmed objective responses occurred among the 24 evaluable patients (ORR = 0% [95% CI: 0-14%]) and the study was terminated at the first stage. Minor responses (tumor regression less than 30%) were seen in eleven of 24 (45%) patients. The median PFS was 4 months [95% CI: 1-6 months] and the 6-month PFS was 29% [95% CI: 13%-48%]. The median OS was 11 months [95% CI: 7-14 months].In this study, the overall efficacy of CP plus sorafenib in metastatic uveal melanoma did not warrant further clinical testing when assessed by ORR, although minor tumor responses and stable disease were observed in some patients.ClinicalTrials.govNCT00329641."
https://openalex.org/W2091878800,"Decreasing body size has been suggested as the third universal biological response to global warming after latitudinal/altitudinal range shifts and shifts in phenology. Size shifts in a community can be the composite result of intraspecific size shifts and of shifts between differently sized species. Metabolic explanations for the size shifts dominate in the literature but top down effects, i.e. intensified size-selective consumption at higher temperatures, have been proposed as alternative explanation. Therefore, we performed phytoplankton experiments with a factorial combination of warming and consumer type (protist feeding mainly on small algae vs. copepods mainly feeding on large algae). Natural phytoplankton was exposed to 3 (1st experiment) or 4 (2nd experiment) temperature levels and 3 (1st experiment: nano-, microzooplankton, copepods) or 2 (2nd experiment: microzooplankton, copepods) types of consumers. Size shifts of individual phytoplankton species and community mean size were analyzed. Both, mean cell size of most of the individual species and mean community cell size decreased with temperature under all grazing regimes. Grazing by copepods caused an additional reduction in cell size. Our results reject the hypothesis, that intensified size selective consumption at higher temperature would be the dominant explanation of decreasing body size. In this case, the size reduction would have taken place only in the copepod treatments but not in the treatments with protist grazing (nano- and microzooplankton)."

We hypothesized that measuring several putative inflammatory biomarkers simultaneously will augment specificity and sensitivity of the biomarker to the clinically useful range. Based on our pilot experiment in which we measured 18 inflammatory biomarkers in 10-fold concentrated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) derived from 16 untreated patients with highly active multiple sclerosis (MS) we selected a combination of three CSF biomarkers, IL-12p40, CXCL13 and IL-8, for further validation.Concentrations of IL-12p40, CXCL13 and IL-8 were determined in a blinded fashion in CSF samples from an initial cohort (n = 72) and a confirmatory cohort (n = 167) of prospectively collected, untreated subjects presenting for a diagnostic work-up of possible neuroimmunological disorder. Diagnostic conclusion was based on a thorough clinical workup, which included laboratory assessment of the blood and CSF, neuroimaging and longitudinal follow-up. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis in conjunction with principal component analysis (PCA), which was used to combine information from all three biomarkers, assessed the diagnostic value of measured biomarkers.Each of the three biomarkers was significantly increased in MS and other inflammatory neurological disease (OIND) in comparison to non-inflammatory neurological disorder patients (NIND) at least in one cohort. However, considering all three biomarkers together improved accuracy of predicting the presence of intrathecal inflammation to the consistently good to excellent range (area under the ROC curve = 0.868-0.924).Future clinical studies will determine if a combinatorial biomarker consisting of CSF IL-12p40, CXCL13 and IL-8 provides utility in determining the presence of active intrathecal inflammation in diagnostically uncertain cases and in therapeutic development and management."
https://openalex.org/W2002473696,"How neural circuits associated with sexually dimorphic organs are differentially assembled during development is unclear. Here, we report a sexually dimorphic pattern of mouse mammary gland sensory innervation and the mechanism of its formation. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), emanating from mammary mesenchyme and signaling through its receptor TrkB on sensory axons, is required for establishing mammary gland sensory innervation of both sexes at early developmental stages. Subsequently, in males, androgens promote mammary mesenchymal expression of a truncated form of TrkB, which prevents BDNF-TrkB signaling in sensory axons and leads to a rapid loss of mammary gland innervation independent of neuronal apoptosis. Thus, sex hormone regulation of a neurotrophic factor signal directs sexually dimorphic axonal growth and maintenance, resulting in generation of a sex-specific neural circuit."
https://openalex.org/W2015754725,"Generation of meiotic crossovers in many eukaryotes requires the elimination of anti-crossover activities by using the Msh4-Msh5 heterodimer to block helicases. Msh4 and Msh5 have been lost from the flies Drosophila and Glossina, but we identified a complex of minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins that functionally replace Msh4-Msh5. We found that REC, an ortholog of MCM8 that evolved under strong positive selection in flies, interacts with MEI-217 and MEI-218, which arose from a previously undescribed metazoan-specific MCM protein. Meiotic crossovers were reduced in Drosophila rec, mei-217, and mei-218 mutants; however, removal of the Bloom syndrome helicase (BLM) ortholog restored crossovers. Thus, MCMs were co-opted into a novel complex that replaced the meiotic pro-crossover function of Msh4-Msh5 in flies."

Stable isotope studies of modern analogues are an important prerequisite for such reconstructions from fossil mammal remains. While numerous studies have investigated modern large- and medium-sized mammals, comparable studies are rare for small mammals. Due to their high abundance in terrestrial ecosystems, short life spans and small habitat size, small mammals are good recorders of local environments.The δ(18)O and δ(13)C values of teeth and bones of seven sympatric modern rodent species collected from owl pellets at a single locality were measured, and the inter-specific, intra-specific and intra-individual variations were evaluated. Minimum sample sizes to obtain reproducible population δ(18)O means within one standard deviation were determined. These parameters are comparable to existing data from large mammals. Additionally, the fractionation between coexisting carbonate (δ(18)O(CO3)) and phosphate (δ(18)O(PO4)) in rodent bioapatite was determined, and δ(18)O values were compared to existing calibration equations between the δ(18)O of rodent bioapatite and local surface water (δ(18)O(LW)). Specific calibration equations between δ(18)O(PO4) and δ(18)O(LW) may be applicable on a taxonomic level higher than the species. However, a significant bias can occur when bone-based equations are applied to tooth-data and vice versa, which is due to differences in skeletal tissue formation times. δ(13)C values reflect the rodents' diet and agree well with field observations of their nutritional behaviour.Rodents have a high potential for the reconstruction of palaeoenvironmental conditions by means of bioapatite δ(18)O and δ(13)C analysis. No significant disadvantages compared to larger mammals were observed. However, for refined palaeoenvironmental reconstructions a better understanding of stable isotope signatures in modern analogous communities and potential biases due to seasonality effects, population dynamics and tissue formation rates is necessary."
https://openalex.org/W2063643984,"Improvements to sequencing protocols and the development of computational phylogenetics have opened up opportunities to study the rapid evolution of RNA viruses in real time. In practical terms, these results can be combined with field data in order to reconstruct spatiotemporal scenarios that describe the origin and transmission pathways of viruses during an epidemic. In the case of notifiable diseases, such as foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), these analyses provide important insights into the epidemiology of field outbreaks that can support disease control programmes. This study reconstructs the origin and transmission history of the FMD outbreaks which occurred during 2011 in Burgas Province, Bulgaria, a country that had been previously FMD-free-without-vaccination since 1996. Nineteen full genome sequences (FGS) of FMD virus (FMDV) were generated and analysed, including eight representative viruses from all of the virus-positive outbreaks of the disease in the country and 11 closely-related contemporary viruses from countries in the region where FMD is endemic (Turkey and Israel). All Bulgarian sequences shared a single putative common ancestor which was closely related to the index case identified in wild boar. The closest relative from outside of Bulgaria was a FMDV collected during 2010 in Bursa (Anatolia, Turkey). Within Bulgaria, two discrete genetic clusters were detected that corresponded to two episodes of outbreaks that occurred during January and March-April 2011. The number of nucleotide substitutions that were present between, and within, these separate clusters provided evidence that undetected FMDV infection had occurred. These conclusions are supported by laboratory data that subsequently identified three additional FMDV-infected livestock premises by serosurveillance, as well as a number of antibody positive wild boar on both sides of the border with Turkish Thrace. This study highlights how FGS analysis can be used as an effective on-the-spot tool to support and help direct epidemiological investigations of field outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W2091609255,"CD146 is a highly glycosylated junctional adhesion molecule, expressed on human vascular endothelial cells and involved in the control of vessel integrity. Galectin-1 is a lectin produced by vascular cells that can binds N- and O-linked oligosaccharides of cell membrane glycoproteins. Because both CD146 and Galectin-1 are involved in modulation of cell apoptosis, we hypothesized that Galectin-1 could interact with CD146, leading to functional consequences in endothelial cell apoptosis. We first characterized CD146 glycosylations and showed that it is mainly composed of N-glycans able to establish interactions with Galectin-1. We demonstrated a sugar-dependent binding of recombinant CD146 to Galectin-1 using both ELISA and Biacore assays. This interaction is direct, with a K(D) of 3.10(-7) M, and specific as CD146 binds to Galectin-1 and not to Galectin-2. Moreover, co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that Galectin-1 interacts with endogenous CD146 that is highly expressed by HUVEC. We observed a Galectin-1-induced HUVEC apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner as demonstrated by Annexin-V/7AAD staining. Interestingly, both down-regulation of CD146 cell surface expression using siRNA and antibody-mediated blockade of CD146 increase this apoptosis. Altogether, our results identify Galectin-1 as a novel ligand for CD146 and this interaction protects, in vitro, endothelial cells against apoptosis induced by Galectin-1."
https://openalex.org/W2096030971,"Heart and Skeletal Muscle Inflammation (HSMI), recently associated with a novel Atlantic salmon reovirus (ASRV), is currently one of the most prevalent inflammatory diseases in commercial Atlantic salmon farms in Norway. Mortality varies from low to 20%, but morbidity can be very high, reducing growth performance and causing considerable financial impact. Clinical symptoms, including myocarditis, myocardial and red skeletal muscle necrosis, correlate with the intensity of the inflammatory response. In the present study, the effects of two functional feeds (FF1 and FF2) were compared to a standard commercial reference feed (ST) in Atlantic salmon subjected to an ASRV challenge. The functional feeds had reduced levels of total lipid and digestible energy, and different levels and proportions of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA). The objective was to determine whether these feeds could provide effective protection by decreasing the inflammatory response associated with HSMI. Histopathology, viral load, fatty acid composition and gene expression of heart tissue were assessed over a period of 16 weeks post-infection with ASRV. The viral load and histopathology scores in heart tissue in response to ASRV infection were reduced in fish fed both functional feeds, with FF1 showing the greatest effect. Microarray hierarchical cluster analysis showed that the functional feeds greatly affected expression of inflammation/immune related genes over the course of the ASRV infection. Viral load correlated with up-regulation of pro-inflammatory genes at the early-mid stages of infection in fish fed the ST diet. Expression of inflammatory genes 16-weeks after ASRV challenge reflected the difference in efficacy between the functional feeds, with fish fed FF1 showing lower expression. Thus, severity of the lesions in heart tissue correlated with the intensity of the innate immune response and was associated with tissue fatty acid compositions. The present study demonstrated that dietary modulation through clinical nutrition had major influences on the development and severity of the response to ASRV infection in salmon. Thus, HSMI was reduced in fish fed the functional feeds, particularly FF1. The modulation of gene expression between fish fed the different feeds provided further insight into the molecular mechanisms and progression of the inflammatory and immune responses to ASRV infection in salmon."
https://openalex.org/W2030574465,"In multiple sclerosis (MS), treatment with the monoclonal antibody natalizumab effectively reduces the formation of acute lesions in the central nervous system (CNS). Natalizumab binds the integrin very late antigen (VLA)-4, expressed on the surface of immune cells, and inhibits VLA-4 dependent transmigration of circulating immune-cells across the vascular endothelium into the CNS. Recent studies suggested that natalizumab treated MS patients have an increased T-cell pool in the blood compartment which may be selectively enriched in activated T-cells. Proposed causes are sequestration of activated T-cells due to reduced extravasation of activated and pro-inflammatory T-cells or due to induction of VLA-4 mediated co-stimulatory signals by natalizumab. In this study we examined how natalizumab treatment altered the distribution of effector and memory T-cell subsets in the blood compartment and if T-cells in general or myelin-reactive T-cells in particular showed signs of increased immune activation. Furthermore we examined the effects of natalizumab on CD4(+) T-cell responses to myelin in vitro. Natalizumab-treated MS patients had significantly increased numbers of effector-memory T-cells in the blood. In T-cells from natalizumab-treated MS patients, the expression of TNF-α mRNA was increased whereas the expression of fourteen other effector cytokines or transcription factors was unchanged. Natalizumab-treated MS patients had significantly decreased expression of the co-stimulatory molecule CD134 on CD4(+)CD26(HIGH) T-cells, in blood, and natalizumab decreased the expression of CD134 on MBP-reactive CD26(HIGH)CD4(+) T-cells in vitro. Otherwise CD4(+) T-cells from natalizumab-treated and untreated MS patients showed similar responses to MBP. In conclusion natalizumab treatment selectively increased the effector memory T-cell pool but not the activation state of T-cells in the blood compartment. Myelin-reactive T-cells were not selectively increased in natalizumab treated MS."

https://openalex.org/W2067690753,"The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae undergoes a mitochondrial-dependent programmed cell death in response to different stimuli, such as acetic acid, with features similar to those of mammalian apoptosis. However, the upstream signaling events in this process, including those leading to mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, are still poorly characterized. Changes in sphingolipid metabolism have been linked to modulation of apoptosis in both yeast and mammalian cells, and ceramides have been detected in mitochondria upon apoptotic stimuli. In this study, we aimed to characterize the contribution of enzymes involved in ceramide metabolism to apoptotic cell death induced by acetic acid. We show that isc1Δ and lag1Δ mutants, lacking inositol phosphosphingolipid phospholipase C and ceramide synthase, respectively, exhibited a higher resistance to acetic acid that was associated with lower levels of some phytoceramide species. Consistently, these mutant cells displayed lower levels of ROS production and reduced mitochondrial alterations, such as mitochondrial fragmentation and degradation, and decreased translocation of cytochrome c into the cytosol in response to acetic acid. These results suggest that ceramide production contributes to cell death induced by acetic acid, especially through hydrolysis of complex sphingolipids catalyzed by Isc1p and de novo synthesis catalyzed by Lag1p, and provide the first in vivo indication of its involvement in mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization in yeast."
https://openalex.org/W2049579888,"Temporal or delay discounting refers to the phenomenon that the value of a reward is discounted as a function of time to delivery. A range of models have been proposed that approximate the shape of the discount curve describing the relationship between subjective value and time. Recent evidence suggests that more than one free parameter may be required to accurately model human temporal discounting data. Nonetheless, many temporal discounting studies in psychiatry, psychology and neuroeconomics still apply single-parameter models, despite their oftentimes poor fit to single-subject data. Previous comparisons of temporal discounting models have either not taken model complexity into account, or have overlooked particular models. Here we apply model comparison techniques in a large sample of temporal discounting datasets using several discounting models employed in the past. Among the models examined, an exponential-power model from behavioural economics (CS model, Ebert & Prelec 2007) provided the best fit to human laboratory discounting data. Inter-parameter correlations for the winning model were moderate, whereas they were substantial for other dual-parameter models examined. Analyses of previous group and context effects on temporal discounting with the winning model provided additional theoretical insights. The CS model may be a useful tool in future psychiatry, psychology and neuroscience work on inter-temporal choice."
https://openalex.org/W2019316275,"Abnormally enhanced tissue factor (TF) activity is related to increased thrombosis risk in which oxidative stress plays a critical role. Human cytosolic thioredoxin (hTrx1) and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), also secreted into circulation, have the power to protect against oxidative stress. However, the relationship between hTrx1/TrxR and TF remains unknown. Here we show reversible association of hTrx1 with TF in human serum and plasma samples. The association is dependent on hTrx1-Cys-73 that bridges TF-Cys-209 via a disulfide bond. hTrx1-Cys-73 is absolutely required for hTrx1 to interfere with FVIIa binding to purified and cell-surface TF, consequently suppressing TF-dependent procoagulant activity and proteinase-activated receptor-2 activation. Moreover, hTrx1/TrxR plays an important role in sensing the alterations of NADPH/NADP(+) states and transducing this redox-sensitive signal into changes in TF activity. With NADPH, hTrx1/TrxR readily facilitates the reduction of TF, causing a decrease in TF activity, whereas with NADP(+), hTrx1/TrxR promotes the oxidation of TF, leading to an increase in TF activity. By comparison, TF is more likely to favor the reduction by hTrx1-TrxR-NADPH. This reversible reduction-oxidation reaction occurs in the TF extracellular domain that contains partially opened Cys-49/-57 and Cys-186/-209 disulfide bonds. The cell-surface TF procoagulant activity is significantly increased after hTrx1-knockdown. The response of cell-surface TF procoagulant activity to H(2)O(2) is efficiently suppressed through elevating cellular TrxR activity via selenium supplementation. Our data provide a novel mechanism for redox regulation of TF activity. By modifying Cys residues or regulating Cys redox states in TF extracellular domain, hTrx1/TrxR function as a safeguard against inappropriate TF activity."

Dyn2 is proposed to dimerize and stabilize the Nup82-Nsp1-Nup159 complex of the nuclear pore assembly through its interaction with nucleoporin Nup159. Nup159 has six LC8 recognition motifs separated by short linkers. NMR experiments reported here show that the Dyn2 binding domain of Nup159 is intrinsically disordered and that binding of one equivalent of Dyn2 dimer aligns two Nup159 chains along the full Dyn2 binding domain to form a bivalent scaffold that promotes binding of other Dyn2 dimers. Isothermal titration calorimetry of Dyn2 binding to Nup constructs of increasing lengths determine that the third LC8 recognition motifs does not bind Dyn2. A new approach to identifying active LC8 recognition motifs based on NMR-detected β-sheet propensities is presented. Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments also show that, due to unfavorable entropy changes, a Nup-Dyn2 complex with three Dyn2 dimers is more stable than the wild-type complex with five Dyn2 dimers. The calorimetric results argue that, from a thermodynamics perspective, only three Dyn2 dimers are needed for optimal stability and suggest that the evolutionary adaptation of multiple tandem LC8 recognition motifs imparts to the complex other properties such as rigidity and a kink in the rod-like structure.

Significance: Multiple recognition sites provide entropy/enthalpy balance to a stable yet entropically unfavorable rigid complex. Intrinsically disordered proteins, a class of proteins lacking a well defined structure, are often at the organizational center of biological complexes where they act as flexible scaffolds presenting multiple binding domains and promoting spatial orientations that facilitate protein-protein interactions (reviewed in Ref. 1Cortese M.S. Uversky V.N. Dunker A.K. Intrinsic disorder in scaffold proteins: getting more from less.Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2008; 98: 85-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Intrinsically disordered proteins in such complexes have some regions that fold upon binding (2Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. Linking folding and binding.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2009; 19: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar), whereas other regions retain their disordered structure, a phenomenon referred to as fuzziness (3Fuxreiter M. Tompa P. Fuzzy complexes: a more stochastic view of protein function.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2012; 725: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Dynamic and adaptable intrinsically disordered protein-partner complexes require chaperones or regulators that aid the coordination of assembly and disassembly of their higher order structures. Nucleoporin Nup159, a subunit at the cytoplasmic end of the yeast nuclear pore complex, functions both as a structural component of the nuclear pore complex and as a docking site for transiently associated nuclear transport factors (4Hoelz A. Debler E.W. Blobel G. The structure of the nuclear pore complex.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2011; 80: 613-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). In studies of the assembly of Nup159-Nup82-Nsp1 nucleoporin subcomplex, Hurt and co-workers (5Stelter P. Kunze R. Flemming D. Höpfner D. Diepholz M. Philippsen P. Böttcher B. Hurt E.

Dyn2 and Drosophila melanogaster LC8 are very closely related, with 48% sequence identity and essentially the same three-dimensional structure (6Romes E.M. Tripathy A. Slep K.C.

The interplay of ligand binding and quaternary structure in the diverse interactions of dynein light chain LC8.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 384: 954-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). LC8, a dynein light chain that also binds numerous other non-dynein partners, has been identified as a versatile hub protein that in diverse systems binds to disordered protein segments and assists folding, assembly, and regulation of multiprotein complexes (8Barbar E. Dynein light chain LC8 is a dimerization hub essential in diverse protein networks.Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). As a dimer with two symmetrical binding grooves, LC8 has an inherent tendency to bind two chains of the same protein and create a bivalent scaffold that promotes either self-association or docking of other bivalent ligands or both (9Hall J. Karplus P.A. Barbar E. Multivalency in the assembly of intrinsically disordered dynein intermediate chain.J. Biol.

For example, binding of LC8 to the intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain of dynein intermediate chain (IC) 2The abbreviations used are: ICintermediate chainDIDDyn2 interacting domainNupnucleoporinLC8dynein light chain 8. promotes both IC self-association and increased affinity for the other dimeric light chains (9Hall J.

A common feature among LC8 binding partners, including dynein IC, is that the LC8 recognition motif is disordered in the apo form but is ordered in the LC8-bound form where it packs as a β-strand that spans the length of LC8 dimer interface (6Romes E.M.

Other LC8 binding partners that have multiple LC8 recognition motifs include the following: the C-terminal domain of ATM-interacting protein 18 SQ/TQ LC8 recognition motifs spanning a 400-amino acid stretch, of which 11 bind LC8 by pepscan analysis (21Rapali P.

Cell Biol. 2012; 198: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). There are notable similarities in domain organization between the more extensively studied LC8 binding partner, dynein IC, and Nup159. Similarities include a β-propeller domain at the N-terminal of Nup159 and the C-terminal of IC, a middle unstructured segment, and a predicted coiled-coil at the N-terminal of IC and the C-terminal of Nup159. However, although Nup159 binds five Dyn2 dimers, D. melanogaster IC binds one LC8 dimer and an LC8-like dimer (Tctex1) (9Hall J. Karplus P.A. Barbar E. Multivalency in the assembly of intrinsically disordered dynein intermediate chain.J. Biol.

Cell. 2011; 22: 2690-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This raises interesting questions, such as why multiple Dyn2 dimers associate with Nup159. Are all needed for complex stability, or similar to IC, are two sufficient? Equally relevant is why Dyn2 binds only five of the six LC8 consensus recognition motifs; bringing to the fore the question of how recognition motifs are specified and whether the presence of such a motif implies an actual binding event. In this study, we use NMR and isothermal titration calorimetry to identify which Nup159 recognition motifs indeed bind Dyn2, to characterize the collapsed and aligned Nup-Dyn2 complex at low levels of Dyn2, and to rationalize the function of multiple recognition motifs in Nup159. Recombinant Dyn2 and constructs of Nup159 that include residues 891–1264 (hereafter referred to as QT1–6CC1), 1154–1210 (QT5–6), 1166–1210 (QT6) were gifts (Ed Hurt, Biochemie-Zentrm der Universitat, Heidelberg, Germany). QT1–6CC1 was used as the template in polymerase chain reactions to generate amplified DNA fragments corresponding to residues 1075–1115 (QT1), 1075–1128 (QT1–2), 1075–1140 (QT1–3), 1075–1153 (QT1–4), 1075–1165 (QT1–5), and 1075–1178 (QT1–6), which were subsequently cloned into a pMCSG9 vector (27Stols L. Gu M. Dieckman L. Raffen R. Collart F.R. Donnelly M.I. A new vector for high-throughput, ligation-independent cloning encoding a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site.Protein Expr.

Mark I.D. A family of LIC vectors for high-throughput cloning and purification of proteins.Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 498: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). QT1–6CC1 was subcloned in a pET Sumo vector (Invitrogen), and QT5–6 and QT6 were subcloned in pET 15b vectors (Novagen). Recombinant vectors were transformed into BL21(DE3) or Rosetta cell lines for protein expression. Recombinant proteins were produced by growing cell lines at 37 °C in Luria broth or 13C or 12C glucose/15N ammonia-enriched MJ9 media. At a cell density (A600) of 0.6–0.8, protein expression was induced for 3 h by adding 0.1–0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested, lysed, centrifuged to remove all cell debris, and soluble recombinant proteins purified using Qiagen nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography protocol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The His6 maltose-binding protein fusion, part of the pMCSG9 vector of each Nup159 construct was removed with tobacco etch virus protease. All proteins were further purified on a SuperdexTM 75 (GE Healthcare) size exclusion chromatography column, resulting in purity > 95%. For constructs used in NMR studies, an additional anion exchange chromatography purification step resulted in purity > 98%. Proteins were dialyzed against appropriate buffers, and their concentrations were determined from absorbances at 280 nm and computed (ExPASy) molar extinction coefficient values (QT, 1490 m−1 cm−1; QT1–2, QT1–3, QT1–4, QT1–5, QT1–6, and QT1–6CC1, 2980 m−1 cm−1; QT5–6 and QT6, 5960 m−1 cm−1; Dyn2, 12950 m−1 cm−1). Reported concentrations are those for the monomeric proteins. The computed Dyn2 molar extinction coefficient takes into account the polyhistidine sequence from the expression vector. The proteins were subsequently stored at 4 °C and used within a week. NMR samples were prepared in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm NaCl, pH 6.0 buffer containing 1 mm DSS, 10% D2O, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Data were acquired on a Bruker Avance 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a cryogenic 1H/13C/15N TCI probehead with the z axis gradient coil at 25 °C.

Interaction of unlabeled Dyn2 with isotopically labeled QT1–6 was characterized by collecting HSQC spectra with Dyn2 at final molar ratios (Nup:Dyn2) of 1:0.8, 1:2, and 1:6. The three-dimensional HNCO spectrum was processed using Multidimensional Fourier Transform (31Kazimierczuk K. Zawadzka A. Koźmiński W. Zhukov I.

Titration data were processed with NMRpipe (35Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. NMRpipe: a multidimensional spectral processing system based on UNIX pipes.J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11529) Google Scholar). All spectra were analyzed with the graphical NMR assignment and integration software Sparky 3.115 (36Goddard, T. D., Kneller, D. G., SPARKY, version 3, San Francisco, California.Google Scholar). The CD spectrum of QT1–6 was acquired at 25 °C, on a JASCO 720 spectropolarimeter, using a 1-mm path length cell. The protein, at a concentration of 20 μm was prepared in 10 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm NaCl, pH 6.0. ITC experiments using Microcal VP-ITC microcalorimeter (North Hampton, MA), were performed at 25 °C (unless otherwise stated) in buffer composed of 50 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm sodium azide, pH 7.5. A typical experiment involved an initial 2 μl injection, followed by 26 10-μl injections of Dyn2 to Nup159 constructs in the concentration range of 9–100 μm, accompanied by stirring at a constant rate of 351 rpm. Added Dyn2 was in the concentration range of 0.4–1.2 mm. The heats of dilution were measured by titrating Dyn2 into buffer and subtracting the resulting enthalpies from the data set. Data were analyzed using Origin (version 7.0) and fit to a single-site binding model. Recorded data are the average of two independent experiments, with the uncertainty reported as the difference between the experimental value and the average. The carboxyl-terminal half of Nup159 includes a Dyn2 binding domain (DID in Fig. 1) adjacent to a predicted coiled-coil domain. Within the DID are six putative LC8 recognition motifs (QT) each composed of a 10-residue sequence ending in QTX where X is any amino acid. Nup159 constructs were designed to include one (QT1), two (QT1–2), three (QT1–3), four (QT1–4), five (QT1–5), last two (QT5–6), last (QT6), or all six (QT1–6, QT1–6CC1) recognition motifs. QT1–6CC1 includes the first part of the predicted coiled-coil domain (Fig. 1). The DID domain QT1–6 is a monomer by multi-angle laser light scattering criteria (observed and calculated molecular masses of 11.97 kDa and 11.69 kDa, respectively). A 1H -15N HSQC spectrum (Fig. 2A) shows limited amide proton dispersion characteristic of a predominantly unstructured protein. Backbone assignments for all 101 non-proline residues were determined using five dimensional HN(CA)CONH and HabCabCONH experiments (29Kazimierczuk K. Zawadzka-Kazimierczuk A. Koźmiński W. Non-uniform frequency domain for optimal exploitation of non-uniform sampling.J. Magn. Reson. 2010; 205: 286-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) optimized for predominantly unstructured proteins. A CD spectrum characteristic of a protein with limited secondary structure (Fig. 2B) confirms the disorder observed by NMR. Local conformational propensities of residues were experimentally derived from the deviation of Cα and Cβ chemical shifts from standard random coil values (37Schwarzinger S. Kroon G.J. Foss T.R.

Fig. 2C identifies secondary structure propensities with β-strand propensities for residues 1101–1109, 1150–1156, 1159–1166, and 1168–1174, and some helical propensity for residues 1126–1134, also shown in hatched arrows and a bar below the sequence in Fig. 3E. For comparison, β-sheet propensities predicted by sequence-based algorithms are shown in Fig. 3E as open arrows, whereas the rest of the sequence is predicted as disordered.FIGURE 3Residue-specific titrations of Nup159-DID.

MoRFpred, which identifies short molecular recognition features located within intrinsically disordered regions that bind to protein partners via disorder-to-order transitions, identified the 5th binding segment as a putative binding region (red highlighted regions). ANCHOR, which finds disordered regions that become ordered when bound to a globular partner identified the 1st, 2nd, part of the 4th, and the 5th binding segments (black bars) as potential binding sites. The experimentally determined binding segments highlighted in yellow correspond to Nup159 residues 1103–1112, 1116–1125, 1141–1150, 1153–1162, and 1165–1174.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Plots of normalized intensities of “random coil” peaks with Dyn2 added to 1H-15N or 13C-15N-labeled QT1–6 at molar ratios (Nup:Dyn2) of 1:0.8, 1:2, and 1:6 are shown in Figs. 3, A–C, respectively. Fig. 3E shows which residues have peaks that fully disappear at the various molar ratios. At the lowest concentration of Dyn2 (Fig. 3A), peaks that completely disappear are denoted by blue bars above the plot; they correspond to residues 1109–1117 (a stretch that includes the last four residues of QT1, the three residues between QT1 and QT2, and the first two residues of QT2), 1142–1149 (all within QT4) and 1168–1169. The majority of the other peaks lose more than half of their intensities. Increasing the concentration of Dyn2 to twice the concentration of QT1–6 (Fig. 3B) results in the complete disappearance of the majority of the peaks (green portions of the bar above the plot). With a 6-fold molar excess of Dyn2 (Fig. 3C), the only visible peaks correspond to N-terminal residues 1075–1100, which precede the first recognition motif (red peaks in Fig. 3D), whereas all others in the sequence 1101–1178 disappear (denoted magenta in the bar above the plot in Fig. 3C). Why do Nup “random coil” peaks disappear when QT1–6 and Dyn2 interact? Random coil peaks are reporters of NH groups in residues whose local disorder is equivalent to the same residue in a random coil. When proteins interact, peak disappearance can be due to line broadening associated with intermediate exchange processes and/or to longer rotational correlation time and correspondingly faster transverse relaxation as molecula"
https://openalex.org/W1992002214,"The autoinflammatory disorder, Neonatal-onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease (NOMID) is the most severe phenotype of disorders caused by mutations in CIAS1 that result in increased production and secretion of active IL-1β. NOMID patients present with systemic and organ-specific inflammation of the skin, central nervous system and bone, and respond dramatically to treatment with IL-1 blocking agents. We compared the cellular infiltrates and transcriptome of skin biopsies from patients with NOMID (n = 14) before treatment (lesional (LS) and non-lesional (pre-NL) skin) and after treatment (post-NL) with the IL-1 blocker anakinra (recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist, Kineret®, Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB, SOBI), to normal skin (n = 5) to assess tissue responses in the context of untreated and treated disease. Abundant neutrophils distinguish LS skin from pre-NL and post-NL skin. CD11c+ dermal dendritic cells and CD163+ macrophages expressed activated caspase-1 and are a likely source of cutaneous IL-1 production. Treatment with anakinra led to the disappearance of neutrophils, but CD3+ T cells and HLA-DR+ cells remained elevated. Among the upregulated genes IL-6, IL-8, TNF, IL-17A, CCL20, and the neutrophil defensins DEFA1 and DEFA3 were differentially regulated in LS tissues (compared to normal skin). Important significantly downregulated pathways in LS skin included IL-1R/TLR signaling, type I and II cytokine receptor signaling, mitochondrial dysfunction, and antigen presentation. The differential expression and regulation of microRNAs and pathways involved in post-transcriptional modification were suggestive of epigenetic modification in the chronically inflamed tissue. Overall, the dysregulated genes and pathways suggest extensive “adaptive” mechanisms to control inflammation and maintain tissue homeostasis, likely triggered by chronic IL-1 release in the skin of patients with NOMID."
https://openalex.org/W2093804830,"Theoretical models suggest that gene silencing at the nuclear periphery may involve ""closing"" of chromatin by transcriptional repressors, such as histone deacetylases (HDACs). Here we provide experimental evidence confirming these predictions. Histone acetylation, chromatin compactness, and gene repression in lamina-interacting multigenic chromatin domains were analyzed in Drosophila S2 cells in which B-type lamin, diverse HDACs, and lamina-associated proteins were downregulated by dsRNA. Lamin depletion resulted in decreased compactness of the repressed multigenic domain associated with its detachment from the lamina and enhanced histone acetylation. Our data reveal the major role for HDAC1 in mediating deacetylation, chromatin compaction, and gene silencing in the multigenic domain, and an auxiliary role for HDAC3 that is required for retention of the domain at the lamina. These findings demonstrate the manifold and central involvement of class I HDACs in regulation of lamina-associated genes, illuminating a mechanism by which these enzymes can orchestrate normal and pathological development."
https://openalex.org/W1995439209,"The diagnosis of gastrointestinal (GI) involvement in Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is important to make because the need for treatment depends on the extent of the disease. Moreover, severe GI lesions can cause serious complications. Endoscopy with biopsy is an extremely useful method to diagnose GI-KS. However, determining the indications for endoscopy is difficult because KS can occur without GI symptoms or cutaneous KS. This study sought to clarify predictive clinical factors for GI-KS and its severity on endoscopy.A total of 1,027 HIV-infected patients who underwent endoscopy were analyzed. Sexual behavior, CD4 count, HIV RNA, history of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), GI symptoms, and cutaneous KS were assessed. Endoscopic severity including bulky tumor, ulceration, and number of lesions were evaluated. Thirty-three patients had GI-KS and 46 patients cutaneous KS. Among the GI-KS patients, 78.8% (26/33) had no GI symptoms and 24.2% (8/33) had no cutaneous KS. Univariate analysis identified men who have sex with men (MSM), CD4 <100 cells/µL, HIV RNA ≥10,000 copies/mL, no history of HAART, and cutaneous KS were significantly associated with GI-KS. Among these factors, cutaneous KS was closely related to GI-KS on multivariable analysis. Among patients without cutaneous KS, MSM and CD4 count <100 cells/µL were the only independent clinical factors related to GI-KS. Bulky tumor was significantly associated with CD4 <100 cells/µL and large number of lesions was significantly associated with HIV-RNA ≥10,000 copies/mL.To diagnose GI-KS, clinical factors need to be considered before endoscopy. The presence of GI symptoms is not useful in predicting GI-KS. MSM and CD4 count <100 cells/µL are predictive factors among patients without cutaneous KS. Caution should be exercised especially in patients with low CD4 counts or high HIV viral loads as they are more likely to develop severe GI-KS lesions."

https://openalex.org/W2142725140,"Accumulating evidence suggests a contribution of T cell-derived IL-17, IL-21 and IL-22 cytokines in skin immune homeostasis as well as inflammatory disorders. Here, we analyzed whether the cytokine-producing T lymphocytes could be induced by the different subsets of human skin dendritic cells (DCs), i.e., epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs), dermal CD1c+CD14− and CD14+ DCs (DDCs). DCs were purified following a 2-day migration from separated epidermal and dermal sheets and co-cultured with allogeneic T cells before cytokine secretion was explored. Results showed that no skin DCs could induce substantial IL-17 production by naïve CD4+ or CD8+T lymphocytes whereas all of them could induce IL-17 production by memory T cells. In contrast, LCs and CD1c+CD14−DDCs were able to differentiate naïve CD4+T lymphocytes into IL-22 and IL-21-secreting cells, LCs being the most efficient in this process. Intracellular cytokine staining showed that the majority of IL-21 or IL-22 secreting CD4+T lymphocytes did not co-synthesized IFN-γ, IL-4 or IL-17. IL-21 and IL-22 production were dependent on the B7/CD28 co-stimulatory pathway and ICOS-L expression on skin LCs significantly reduced IL-21 level. Finally, we found that TGF-β strongly down-regulates both IL-21 and IL-22 secretion by allogeneic CD4+ T cells. These results add new knowledge on the functional specialization of human skin DCs and might suggest new targets in the treatment of inflammatory skin disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1970973817,"Scoring goals in a soccer match can be interpreted as a stochastic process. In the most simple description of a soccer match one assumes that scoring goals follows from independent rate processes of both teams. This would imply simple Poissonian and Markovian behavior. Deviations from this behavior would imply that the previous course of the match has an impact on the present match behavior. Here a general framework for the identification of deviations from this behavior is presented. For this endeavor it is essential to formulate an a priori estimate of the expected number of goals per team in a specific match. This can be done based on our previous work on the estimation of team strengths. Furthermore, the well-known general increase of the number of the goals in the course of a soccer match has to be removed by appropriate normalization. In general, three different types of deviations from a simple rate process can exist. First, the goal rate may depend on the exact time of the previous goals. Second, it may be influenced by the time passed since the previous goal and, third, it may reflect the present score. We show that the Poissonian scenario is fulfilled quite well for the German Bundesliga. However, a detailed analysis reveals significant deviations for the second and third aspect. Dramatic effects are observed if the away team leads by one or two goals in the final part of the match. This analysis allows one to identify generic features about soccer matches and to learn about the hidden complexities behind scoring goals. Among others the reason for the fact that the number of draws is larger than statistically expected can be identified."
https://openalex.org/W1981489918,"Macroporous chitosan spheres encapsulating superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles were synthesized by a facile and effective one-step fabrication process. Ferro-gels containing ferrous cations, ferric cations and chitosan were dropped into a sodium hydroxide solution through a syringe pump. In addition, a sodium hydroxide solution was employed for both gelation (chitosan) and co-precipitation (ferrous cations and ferric cations) of the ferro-gels. The results showed that the in-situ co-precipitation of ferro-ions gave rise to a radial morphology with non-spheroid macro pores (large cavities) inside the chitosan spheres. The particle size of iron oxide can be adjusted from 2.5 nm to 5.4 nm by tuning the concentration of the sodium hydroxide solution. Using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction spectra, the synthesized nanoparticles were illustrated as Fe3O4 nanoparticles. In addition, the prepared macroporous chitosan spheres presented a super-paramagnetic behaviour at room temperature with a saturation magnetization value as high as ca. 18 emu/g. The cytotoxicity was estimated using cell viability by incubating doses (0∼1000 µg/mL) of the macroporous chitosan spheres. The result showed good viability (above 80%) with alginate chitosan particles below 1000 µg/mL, indicating that macroporous chitosan spheres were potentially useful for biomedical applications in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2034479458,"The plant type III polyketide synthases (PKSs), which produce diverse secondary metabolites with different biological activities, have successfully co-evolved with land plants. To gain insight into the roles that ancestral type III PKSs played during the early evolution of land plants, we cloned and characterized PpORS from the moss Physcomitrella. PpORS has been proposed to closely resemble the most recent common ancestor of the plant type III PKSs. PpORS condenses a very long chain fatty acyl-CoA with four molecules of malonyl-CoA and catalyzes decarboxylative aldol cyclization to yield the pentaketide 2'-oxoalkylresorcinol. Therefore, PpORS is a 2'-oxoalkylresorcinol synthase. Structure modeling and sequence alignments identified a unique set of amino acid residues (Gln(218), Val(277), and Ala(286)) at the putative PpORS active site. Substitution of the Ala(286) to Phe apparently constricted the active site cavity, and the A286F mutant instead produced triketide alkylpyrones from fatty acyl-CoA substrates with shorter chain lengths. Phylogenetic analysis and comparison of the active sites of PpORS and alkylresorcinol synthases from sorghum and rice suggested that the gramineous enzymes evolved independently from PpORS to have similar functions but with distinct active site architecture. Microarray analysis revealed that PpORS is exclusively expressed in nonprotonemal moss cells. The in planta function of PpORS, therefore, is probably related to a nonprotonemal structure, such as the cuticle."
https://openalex.org/W2055305002,"In breast carcinomas, increased levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) can act as a mitogen to augment tumorigenesis through the regulation of MAPK and AKT signaling pathways. Signaling through these two pathways allows IGF-1 to employ mechanisms that favor proliferation and cellular survival. Here we demonstrate a subset of previously described tumor suppressor and oncogenic microRNAs (miRNAs) that are under the direct regulation of IGF-1 signaling. Additionally, we show that the selective inhibition of either the MAPK or AKT pathways prior to IGF-1 stimulation prevents the expression of previously described tumor suppressor miRNAs that are family and cluster specific. Here we have defined, for the first time, specific miRNAs under the direct regulation of IGF-1 signaling in the estrogen receptor positive MCF-7 breast cancer cell line and demonstrate kinase signaling as a modulator of expression for a small subset of microRNAs. Taken together, these data give new insights into mechanisms governing IGF-1 signaling in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2031351060,"Gene expression data, collected from ASPS tumors of seven different patients and from one immortalized ASPS cell line (ASPS-1), was analyzed jointly with patient ASPL-TFE3 (t(X;17)(p11;q25)) fusion transcript data to identify disease-specific pathways and their component genes. Data analysis of the pooled patient and ASPS-1 gene expression data, using conventional clustering methods, revealed a relatively small set of pathways and genes characterizing the biology of ASPS. These results could be largely recapitulated using only the gene expression data collected from patient tumor samples. The concordance between expression measures derived from ASPS-1 and both pooled and individual patient tumor data provided a rationale for extending the analysis to include patient ASPL-TFE3 fusion transcript data. A novel linear model was exploited to link gene expressions to fusion transcript data and used to identify a small set of ASPS-specific pathways and their gene expression. Cellular pathways that appear aberrantly regulated in response to the t(X;17)(p11;q25) translocation include the cell cycle and cell adhesion. The identification of pathways and gene subsets characteristic of ASPS support current therapeutic strategies that target the FLT1 and MET, while also proposing additional targeting of genes found in pathways involved in the cell cycle (CHK1), cell adhesion (ARHGD1A), cell division (CDC6), control of meiosis (RAD51L3) and mitosis (BIRC5), and chemokine-related protein tyrosine kinase activity (CCL4)."
https://openalex.org/W2017413410,"Somatic Nucleophosmin (NPM1) mutation frequently occurs in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but its role in leukemogenesis remains unclear. This study reports the first ""conventional"" knock-in mouse model of Npm1 mutation, which was achieved by inserting TCTG after nucleotide c.857 (c.854_857dupTCTG) to mimic human mutation without any ""humanized"" sequence. The resultant mutant peptide differed slightly different from that in humans but exhibited cytoplasmic pulling force. Homozygous (Npm1(c+/c+)) mice showed embryonic lethality before day E8.5, wheras heterozygous (Npm1(wt/c+)) mice appeared healthy at birth and were fertile. Approximately 36% of Npm1(wt/c+) mice developed myeloproliferative disease (MPD) with extramedullary hematopoiesis. Those Npm1(wt/c+) mice that did not develop MPD nevertheless gradually developed monocytosis and showed increased numbers of marrow myeloid precursors. This second group of Npm1(wt/c+) mice also showed compromised cobblestone area formation, suggesting pathology in the hematopoietic niche. Microarray experiments and bioinformatic analysis on mice myeloid precursor cells and 227 human samples revealed the expression of CXCR4/CXCL12-related genes was significantly suppressed in mutant cells from both mice and humans. Thus, our mouse model demonstrated that Npm1 mutation can result in MPD, but is insufficient for leukemogenesis. Perturbation of hematopoietic niche in mutant hematopoietic stem cells (implied by underrepresentation of CXCR4/CXCL12-related genes) may be important in the pathogenesis of NPM1 mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2008035364,"G protein-coupled receptors contain selectively important residues that play central roles in the conformational changes that occur during receptor activation. Asparagine 111 (N111(3.35)) is such a residue within the angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor. Substitution of N111(3.35) for glycine leads to a constitutively active receptor, whereas substitution for tryptophan leads to an inactivable receptor. Here, we analyzed the AT(1) receptor and two mutants (N111G and N111W) by molecular dynamics simulations, which revealed a novel molecular switch involving the strictly conserved residue D74(2.50). Indeed, D74(2.50) forms a stable hydrogen bond (H-bond) with the residue in position 111(3.35) in the wild-type and the inactivable receptor. However, in the constitutively active mutant N111G-AT(1) receptor, residue D74 is reoriented to form a new H-bond with another strictly conserved residue, N46(1.50). When expressed in HEK293 cells, the mutant N46G-AT(1) receptor was poorly activable, although it retained a high binding affinity. Interestingly, the mutant N46G/N111G-AT(1) receptor was also inactivable. Molecular dynamics simulations also revealed the presence of a cluster of hydrophobic residues from transmembrane domains 2, 3, and 7 that appears to stabilize the inactive form of the receptor. Whereas this hydrophobic cluster and the H-bond between D74(2.50) and W111(3.35) are more stable in the inactivable N111W-AT(1) receptor, the mutant N111W/F77A-AT(1) receptor, designed to weaken the hydrophobic core, showed significant agonist-induced signaling. These results support the potential for the formation of an H-bond between residues D74(2.50) and N46(1.50) in the activation of the AT(1) receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2084607251,"Epidemiological studies suggest a possible association between BMI, diagnosis and clinical-pathological breast cancer characteristics but biological bases for this relationship still remain to be ascertained. Several biological mechanisms play a role in the genesis and progression of breast cancer. This study aimed to investigate relationships between BMI and breast cancer diagnosis/progression in a Southern Italian population and to try to interpret results according to the serum proteomic profile of healthy and breast cancer patients. BMI, presence or absence of breast cancer and its clinical-pathological characteristics were analyzed in a series of 300 breast cancer women and compared with those of 300 healthy women prospectively. To investigate whether obesity is associated with alterations in serum protein profile, SELDI-ToF approach was applied.Alcohol consumption (22.7% vs 11.3%; p<0.001) and postmenopausal status (65.7% vs 52%; p<0.001) but not BMI resulted significantly different in patients vs controls. Conversely, BMI was significantly associated with a larger-tumour size (BMI> = 30 respect to normal weight: OR = 2.49, 95% CI 1.25-4.99, p = 0.0098) and a higher probability of having positive axillary lymph node (OR = 3.67, CI 95% 2.16-6.23, p<0.0001). Multivariate analysis confirmed the association of breast cancer diagnosis with alcohol consumption (OR = 2.28;CI 1.36-3.83; p<0.0018). Serum protein profile revealed the presence of significant (p-value <0,01) differentially expressed peaks m/z 6934, m/z 5066 in high BMI breast cancer patients vs healthy subjects and m/z 6934, m/z 3346 in high vs low BMI breast cancer patients.The analysis of pathological features of cancer indicates that normal weight women have a significantly higher probability of having a smaller breast cancer at time of diagnosis and negative axillary lymph nodes while increased BMI is associated with an altered protein profile in breast cancer patients. Further studies to identify specific proteins found in the serum and their role in breast cancerogenesis and progression are in progress."
https://openalex.org/W2077599263,"Pasteurella multocida toxin (PMT) is a potent mitogen known to activate several signaling pathways via deamidation of a conserved glutamine residue in the α subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins. However, the detailed mechanism behind mitogenic properties of PMT is unknown. Herein, we show that PMT induces protein synthesis, cell migration, and proliferation in serum-starved Swiss 3T3 cells. Concomitantly PMT induces phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K1) and its substrate, ribosomal S6 protein (rpS6), in quiescent 3T3 cells. The extent of the phosphorylation is time and PMT concentration dependent, and is inhibited by rapamycin and Torin1, the two specific inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Interestingly, PMT-mediated mTOR signaling activation was observed in MEF WT but not in Gα(q/11) knock-out cells. These observations are consistent with the data indicating that PMT-induced mTORC1 activation proceeds via the deamidation of Gα(q/11), which leads to the activation of PLCβ to generate diacylglycerol and inositol trisphosphate, two known activators of the PKC pathway. Exogenously added diacylglycerol or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, known activators of PKC, leads to rpS6 phosphorylation in a rapamycin-dependent manner. Furthermore, PMT-induced rpS6 phosphorylation is inhibited by PKC inhibitor, Gö6976. Although PMT induces epidermal growth factor receptor activation, it exerts no effect on PMT-induced rpS6 phosphorylation. Together, our findings reveal for the first time that PMT activates mTORC1 through the Gα(q/11)/PLCβ/PKC pathway. The fact that PMT-induced protein synthesis and cell migration is partially inhibited by rapamycin indicates that these processes are in part mediated by the mTORC1 pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2058666334,"In a context of pesticide use reduction, alternatives to chemical-based crop protection strategies are needed to control diseases. Crop and plant architectures can be viewed as levers to control disease outbreaks by affecting microclimate within the canopy or pathogen transmission between plants. Modeling and simulation is a key approach to help analyze the behaviour of such systems where direct observations are difficult and tedious. Modeling permits the joining of concepts from ecophysiology and epidemiology to define structures and functions generic enough to describe a wide range of epidemiological dynamics. Additionally, this conception should minimize computing time by both limiting the complexity and setting an efficient software implementation. In this paper, our aim was to present a model that suited these constraints so it could first be used as a research and teaching tool to promote discussions about epidemic management in cropping systems. The system was modelled as a combination of individual hosts (population of plants or organs) and infectious agents (pathogens) whose contacts are restricted through a network of connections. The system dynamics were described at an individual scale. Additional attention was given to the identification of generic properties of host-pathogen systems to widen the model's applicability domain. Two specific pathosystems with contrasted crop architectures were considered: ascochyta blight on pea (homogeneously layered canopy) and potato late blight (lattice of individualized plants). The model behavior was assessed by simulation and sensitivity analysis and these results were discussed against the model ability to discriminate between the defined types of epidemics. Crop traits related to disease avoidance resulting in a low exposure, a slow dispersal or a de-synchronization of plant and pathogen cycles were shown to strongly impact the disease severity at the crop scale."
https://openalex.org/W2034971929,"Genetic exchange between isolated populations, or introgression between species, serves as a key source of novel genetic material on which natural selection can act. While detecting historical gene flow from DNA sequence data is of much interest, many existing methods can be limited by requirements for deep population genomic sampling. In this paper, we develop a scalable genealogy-based method to detect candidate signatures of gene flow into a given population when the source of the alleles is unknown. Our method does not require sequenced samples from the source population, provided that the alleles have not reached fixation in the sampled recipient population. The method utilizes recent advances in algorithms for the efficient reconstruction of ancestral recombination graphs, which encode genealogical histories of DNA sequence data at each site, and is capable of detecting the signatures of gene flow whose footprints are of length up to single genes. Further, we employ a theoretical framework based on coalescent theory to test for statistical significance of certain recombination patterns consistent with gene flow from divergent sources. Implementing these methods for application to whole-genome sequences of environmental yeast isolates, we illustrate the power of our approach to highlight loci with unusual recombination histories. By developing innovative theory and methods to analyze signatures of gene flow from population sequence data, our work establishes a foundation for the continued study of introgression and its evolutionary relevance."
https://openalex.org/W2162199196,"Traditional quantitative genetics assumes that an individual's phenotype is determined by both genetic and environmental factors. For many animals, part of the environment is social and provided by parents and other interacting partners. When expression of genes in social partners affects trait expression in a focal individual, indirect genetic effects occur. In this study, we explore the effects of indirect genetic effects on the magnitude and range of phenotypic values in a focal individual in a multi-member model analyzing three possible classes of interactions between individuals. We show that social interactions may not only cause indirect genetic effects but can also modify direct genetic effects. Furthermore, we demonstrate that both direct and indirect genetic effects substantially alter the range of phenotypic values, particularly when a focal trait can influence its own expression via interactions with traits in other individuals. We derive a function predicting the relative importance of direct versus indirect genetic effects. Our model reveals that both direct and indirect genetic effects can depend to a large extent on both group size and interaction strength, altering group mean phenotype and variance. This may lead to scenarios where between group variation is much higher than within group variation despite similar underlying genetic properties, potentially affecting the level of selection. Our analysis highlights key properties of indirect genetic effects with important consequences for trait evolution, the level of selection and potentially speciation."
https://openalex.org/W2074759703,"Ants of the genus Solenopsis Westwood in the Arabian Peninsula are revised. Six species are treated: Solenopsis elhawagryi Sharaf & Aldawood sp. n., S. geminata (Fabricius, 1804), S. omana Collingwood & Agosti, 1996, S. saudiensis Sharaf & Aldawood, 2011, S. sumara Collingwood & Agosti, 1996, and S. zingibara Collingwood & Agosti, 1996. Solenopsis elhawagryi is described from Beljorashi Governorate, Al Baha Province, Saudi Arabia, based on worker castes and the queen with notes on this species biology and ecology. Solenopsis sumara workers are redescribed and illustrated for the first time and a lectotype is designated. An identification key to the Arabian and Egyptian species is provided with scanning electron micrographs to facilitate species recognition."
