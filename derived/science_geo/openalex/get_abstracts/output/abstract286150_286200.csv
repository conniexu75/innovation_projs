https://openalex.org/W1982446111,"A device configuration for light emission from electroactive polymers is described. In these light-emitting electrochemical cells, a p-n junction diode is created in situ through simultaneous p-type and n-type electrochemical doping on opposite sides of a thin film of conjugated polymer that contains added electrolyte to provide the necessary counterions for doping. Light-emitting devices based on conjugated polymers have been fabricated that operate by the proposed electrochemical oxidation-reduction mechanism. Blue, green, and orange emission have been obtained with turn-on voltages close to the band gap of the emissive material."

A vinyl monomer will undergo self-polymerization if it contains a pendant group that can be transformed into an initiating moiety by the action of an external stimulus. The self-polymerization combines features of a classical vinyl polymerization process with those of a polycondensation because growth is accomplished by the coupling of reactive oligomers. Highly branched, irregular dendritic structures with a multiplicity of reactive functionalities are obtained by polymerization of 3-(1-chloroethyl)-ethenylbenzene."
https://openalex.org/W1967904569,"Measurements of the concentrations and carbon-13/carbon-12 isotope ratios of atmospheric carbon dioxide can be used to quantify the net removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by the oceans and terrestrial plants. A study of weekly samples from a global network of 43 sites defined the latitudinal and temporal patterns of the two carbon sinks. A strong terrestrial biospheric sink was found in the temperate latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere in 1992 and 1993, the magnitude of which is roughly half that of the global fossil fuel burning emissions for those years. The challenge now is to identify those processes that would cause the terrestrial biosphere to absorb carbon dioxide in such large quantities."
https://openalex.org/W2039945745,"Interferometric near-field optical microscopy achieving a resolution of 10 angstroms is demonstrated. The scattered electric field variation caused by a vibrating probe tip in close proximity to a sample surface is measured by encoding it as a modulation in the optical phase of one arm of an interferometer. Unlike in regular near-field optical microscopes, where the contrast results from a weak source (or aperture) dipole interacting with the polarizability of the sample, the present form of imaging relies on a fundamentally different contrast mechanism: sensing the dipole-dipole coupling of two externally driven dipoles (the tip and sample dipoles) as their spacing is modulated."
https://openalex.org/W2046472353,"In two summertime mesoscale convective systems (MCSs), mesospheric optical sprite phenomena were often coincident with both large-amplitude positive cloud-to-ground lightning and transient Schumann resonance excitations of the entire Earth-ionosphere cavity. These observations, together with earlier studies of MCS electrification, suggest that sprites are triggered when the rapid removal of large quantities of positive charge from an areally extensive charge layer stresses the mesosphere to dielectric breakdown."
https://openalex.org/W2059076299,"A sample of 55 South African cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus jubatus) from two geographically isolated populations in South Africa were found to be genetically monomorphic at each of 47 allozyme (allelic isozyme) loci. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of 155 abundant soluble proteins from cheetah fibroblasts also revealed a low frequency of polymorphism (average heterozygosity, 0.013). Both estimates are dramatically lower than levels of variation reported in other cats and mammals in general. The extreme monomorphism may be a consequence of a demographic contraction of the cheetah (a population bottleneck) in association with a reduced rate of increase in the recent natural history of this endangered species."
https://openalex.org/W2064549353,"Supercritical fluids (SCFs), compounds heated and pressurized beyond the critical point, have many unusual properties. Homogeneous molecular catalysts, which have far greater control over selectivity than heterogeneous solid catalysts, are now being tested in SCFs, and early results show that high rates, improved selectivity, and elimination of masstransfer problems can be achieved. As industry moves away from toxic or environmentally damaging solvents, supercritical carbon dioxide may be an ideal replacement medium for nonpolar or weakly polar chemical processes. More than simply substitutes for nonpolar solvents, SCFs can radically change the observed chemistry. Supercritical carbon dioxide is also an excellent medium for its own fixation, as demonstrated by studies of its hydrogenation."
https://openalex.org/W2000737793,"A survey of hydrothermal activity along the superfast-spreading (approximately 150 millimeters per year) East Pacific Rise shows that hydrothermal plumes overlay approximately 60 percent of the ridge crest between 13 degrees 50' and 18 degrees 40'S, a plume abundance nearly twice that known from any other rige portion of comparable length. Plumes were most abundant where the axial cross section is inflated and an axial magma chamber is present. Plumes with high ratios of volatile ((3)He, CH(4), and H(2)S) to nonvolatile (Mn and Fe) species marked where hydrothermal circulation has been perturbed by recent magmatic activity. The high proportion of volatile-rich plumes observed implies that such episodes are more frequent here than on slower spreading ridges."
https://openalex.org/W2001082888,"In experiments in which nest boxes were switched, colony foundresses of the social wasp Polistes fuscatus accepted sisters' combs with little brood destruction but destroyed younger brood in the combs of less closely related females and sometimes deserted these combs. Discrimination between related and unrelated brood does not appear to depend on prior brood contact or environmentally acquired cues."

https://openalex.org/W1992004218,"A new analysis of data obtained from water treatment plants on Lake Michigan fails to support published contentions, based on such data, that the silica content of the lake has declined during the last five decades. The purported silica decline appears to have been due to changes in analytical methods and laboratories. Had such changes been avoided, an invaluable record of the silica content of the lake could have been obtained."
https://openalex.org/W2023620843,"Radio astronomical observations of Uranus show that the radio emission spectrum is evolving in time. Ammonia vapor must be depleted in the Uranian atmosphere as Gulkis and his co-workers previously suggested. Since 1965, ammonia either has been decreasing in time or is a decreasing function of latitude, or both, provided that the radio emission is atmospheric in origin. If Uranus has an observable low-emissivity ""surface,"" these trends may be reversed. The microwave observations made in 1965, at the time when the spin axis of Uranus was nearly perpendicular to the sun-Uranus line, are consistent with an atmospheric opacity profile that would be produced by saturated ammonia vapor in a predominantly hydrogen atmosphere. At the present time, when the spin axis of Uranus is nearly aligned with the sun-Uranus line, the measurements require an opacity that would be produced by saturated water vapor. A large thermal gradient between the pole and equator is ruled out."
https://openalex.org/W2001980422,"Fossil medusoids identified as Cyclomedusa davidi?, Beltanelliformis brunsae, and cf. Sekwia excentrica are reported from Late Precambrian strata in the Wernecke Mountains. They are representatives of the Ediacaran fauna, the oldest assemblage of cosmopolitan metazoans, and are only the third such occurrence in Canada. In addition, specimens broadly resembling the problematic structure Rugoinfractus ovruchensis, previously known only from the Precambrian of the Ukraine, are reported from the Lower Cambrian of the nearby Mackenzie Mountains."

https://openalex.org/W1997680331,"Two isolated solar wind disturbances about 5 minutes in duration were detected aboard the Russian spacecraft Phobos-2 upon its crossing the wake of the martian moon Deimos about 15,000 kilometers downstream from the moon on 1 February 1989. These plasma and magnetic events are interpreted as the inbound and outbound crossings of a Mach cone that is formed as a result of an effective interaction of the solar wind with Deimos. Possible mechanisms such as remanent magnetization, cometary type interaction caused by heavy ion or charged dust production, and unipolar induction resulting from the finite conductivity of the body are discussed. Although none of the present models is fully satisfactory, neutral gas emission through water loss by Deimos at a rate of about 10(23) molecules per second, combined with a charged dust coma, is favored."
https://openalex.org/W2072060965,"Although enstatite is a major constituent of the Earth's upper mantle and subducting lithosphere, most kinetic studies of olivine phase transformations have typically involved single-phase polycrystalline aggregates. Transmission electron microscopy investigations of olivine to spinel and modified spinel (beta phase) reactions in the (Mg, Fe)(2)SiO(4)-(Mg,Fe)SiO(3) system show that transformation of olivine in the stability field of spinel plus phase begins with coherent nucleation of spinel on high-clinoenstatite grains. These observations demonstrate that high clinoenstatite can catalyze the transformation by enhancing nucleation kinetics and therefore imply that secondary phases can influence reaction kinetics during high-pressure mineral transformations."

https://openalex.org/W2055388821,"THE investigation of the spectrum of helium in the extreme ultra-violet, on which I have been long engaged, and which had pretty nearly come to a standstill for want of an untarnished diffraction grating, has recently been set in motion again by the energy and kindness of Prof. R. W. Wood, who has furnished me with several instruments from the engine at Johns Hopkins University. As a result I am able to make some additions to the facts already announced."
