https://openalex.org/W2077890483,"The crystal structure has been determined at 2.8 A resolution for a chemically-trapped covalent reaction intermediate between the HhaI DNA cytosine-5-methyltransferase, S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine, and a duplex 13-mer DNA oligonucleotide containing methylated 5-fluorocytosine at its target. The DNA is located in a cleft between the two domains of the protein and has the characteristic conformation of B-form DNA, except for a disrupted G-C base pair that contains the target cytosine. The cytosine residue has swung completely out of the DNA helix and is positioned in the active site, which itself has undergone a large conformational change. The DNA is contacted from both the major and the minor grooves, but almost all base-specific interactions between the enzyme and the recognition bases occur in the major groove, through two glycine-rich loops from the small domain. The structure suggests how the active nucleophile reaches its target, directly supports the proposed mechanism for cytosine-5 DNA methylation, and illustrates a novel mode of sequence-specific DNA recognition."
https://openalex.org/W1981570640,"A gene encoding a protein related to the serpin family of protease inhibitors was identified as a candidate tumor suppressor gene that may play a role in human breast cancer. The gene product, called maspin, is expressed in normal mammary epithelial cells but not in most mammary carcinoma cell lines. Transfection of MDA-MB-435 mammary carcinoma cells with the maspin gene did not alter the cells' growth properties in vitro, but reduced the cells' ability to induce tumors and metastasize in nude mice and to invade through a basement membrane matrix in vitro. Analysis of human breast cancer specimens revealed that loss of maspin expression occurred most frequently in advanced cancers. These results support the hypothesis that maspin functions as a tumor suppressor."
https://openalex.org/W1975647987,"Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is associated with a t(15; 17) translocation that creates the promyelocyte-retinoic acid receptor α (PML-RARα) fusion gene. Immunohistochemistry demonstrates that PML is a part of a novel macromolecular organelle (including at least three other nuclear proteins) referred to as PML oncogenic domains (PODs). In APL cells, the POD is disrupted into a microparticulate pattern as a consequence of the expression of the PML-RAR oncoprotein. RA treatment of APL cells triggers a reorganization of PML to generate normal-appearing PODs. We propose that PML-RAR is a dominant negative oncoprotein that exerts its putative leukomogenic effect by inhibiting assembly of the POD. According to this proposal, not only is the POD a novel structure, but it can be ascribed an imputed function such that its disruption leads to altered myeloid maturation; this may represent a novel oncogenic target."
https://openalex.org/W2171204713,"Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is characterized by a specific t(15;17) translocation that fuses the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR alpha) to a novel gene product, PML. The involvement of RAR alpha is particularly intriguing in view of the efficient therapeutic effect of retinoic acid (RA) in this disease. In this report, we show that PML is specifically localized within a discrete subnuclear compartment corresponding to nuclear bodies recognized by patient autoimmune sera. In APL cells, the PML-RAR alpha hybrid displays an abnormal localization and directs RXR and other nuclear antigens into aberrant structures that are tightly bound to chromatin. This suggests that the hybrid could exert a dominant negative effect by diverting a subset of proteins from their natural sites of action. Interestingly, treatment of APL cells with RA induces a complete relocalization of each of these proteins. We propose that the beneficial role of RA in promoting myeloid differentiation in APL might be related to its ability to restore a normal subnuclear organization."
https://openalex.org/W1979945257,"Activation of the phospholipase D (PLD) pathway is a widespread response when cells are activated by agonists that bind receptors on the cell surface. A 16-kD cytosolic component can reconstitute guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-mediated activation of phospholipase D in HL60 cells depleted of their cytosol by permeabilization. This factor was purified and identified as two small GTP-binding proteins, ARF1 and ARF3. Recombinant ARF1 substituted for purified ARF proteins in the reconstitution assay. These results indicate that phospholipase D is a downstream effector of ARF1 and ARF3. The well-established role of ARF in vesicular traffic would suggest that alterations in lipid content by PLD are an important determinant in vesicular dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2028310026,"Although objects that have just been seen may persist in memory automatically for a time and interact passively with incoming stimulation, some tasks require that the memory be actively maintained and used. To test for the existence of separate automatic and volitional mechanisms of short-term memory, recordings were made from neurons in the inferior temporal cortex of monkeys while the monkeys held a sample picture ""in mind"" and signaled when it was repeated in a sequence of pictures, ignoring other stimulus repetitions. Some neurons were suppressed by any picture repetition, regardless of relevance, whereas others were enhanced, but only when a picture matched the sample. Short-term memory appears to reflect the parallel operation of these two mechanisms--one being automatic and the other active."
https://openalex.org/W1984637659,"Changes in intermediate filament gene expression occur at key steps in the differentiation of cell types in the mammalian CNS. Neuroepithelial stem cells express the intermediate filament protein nestin and down-regulate it sharply at the transition from proliferating stem cell to postmitotic neuron. Nestin is also expressed in muscle precursors but not in mature muscle cells. We show here that in transgenic mice, independent cell type-specific elements in the first and second introns of the nestin gene consistently direct reporter gene expression to developing muscle and neural precursors, respectively. The second intron contains an enhancer that functions in CNS stem cells, suggesting that there may be a single transcriptional mechanism regulating the CNS stem cell state. This enhancer is much less active in the PNS. The identification of these elements facilitates analysis of mechanisms controlling the switch in gene expression that occurs when muscle and brain precursors terminally differentiate."
https://openalex.org/W1968563729,"It has been proposed that membrane fusion events such as virus-cell fusion proceed through a hemifusion intermediate, a state where lipids but not contents of the fusing compartments mix. We engineered the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) such that it would be anchored in membranes via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) tail. GPI-anchored HA forms a trimer that can bind red blood cells (RBCs) and change conformation under fusion-inducing conditions. Using RBCs labeled with fluorescent lipid or fluorescent soluble content probes, we found that GPI-anchored HA mediated lipid mixing with similar time course and efficiency as wt-HA, yet did not mediate transfer of soluble contents. Hence, GPI-anchored HA appears to initiate, but not complete, a fusion reaction. We interpret our results as evidence for uncoupling a physiological fusion reaction, for trapping a hemifusion intermediate, and for assigning a role to a transmembrane domain in a fusion event."
https://openalex.org/W1988306770,"Double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) occur at recombination hotspots during Saccharomyces cerevisiae meiosis and are thought to initiate exchange at these loci. Analysis of DSB sites in three regions of the yeast genome indicated that breaks occur at or near many potential transcription promoters and that DSBs initiate most, if not all, meiotic recombination. DSB sites displayed deoxyribonuclease I hypersensitivity in chromatin from mitotic and meiotic cells, and changes in chromatin structure produced parallel changes in the occurrence of DSBs. Thus, features of chromatin structure that are established before meiosis play a role in determining where meiotic recombination events initiate."

https://openalex.org/W2087982057,"A consistent rat model for the study of the consequences of congophilic and fibrillar A beta-amyloid in brain has been developed. One hundred percent of animals receiving infusions of synthetic beta-amyloid protein (A beta 1-40) plus a specific heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) for 1 week or 7 weeks (following 2 week infusions) demonstrated Congo red and thioflavin S-positive deposits adjacent to the infusion site. Extracellular amyloid fibrils were identified by electron microscopy and were immunogold decorated with A beta antibody. Significant increases in Congo red staining were observed in animals infused with A beta plus HSPG versus those infused with only A beta. Infusion of A beta alone was variable with respect to congophilic amyloid persistence, which occurred in 50% of animals and only when endogenous HSPGs accumulated at A beta deposition sites. By 7 weeks, only animals infused with A beta plus HSPG demonstrated compaction of the Congo red material from amorphous, wispy deposits (at 1 week) to stellate deposits resembling a Maltese cross. These spherical amyloid deposits were very similar to Congo red-stained amyloid plaques in human Alzheimer's disease brain, and in vitro data suggest that they were probably formed in vivo following interactions with endogenous brain components."
https://openalex.org/W2074990246,We have examined GABAA receptor activation by making rapid applications of GABA to outside-out patches excised from cultured postnatal rat cerebellar neurons. The rate of development of current increases with increasing GABA concentration from a low to a high concentration asymptote. The low concentration asymptote is about 10 s-1 for patches taken from granule cells and 4 s-1 for patches from Purkinje cells. The high concentration asymptote is about 6000 s-1 for patches taken from either granule cells or Purkinje cells. The high concentration asymptote gives an estimate of the fastest rate at which these channels can open and indicates that agonist binding steps are not rate limiting. The concentration dependence of the development of current indicates that more than one GABA molecule is bound to most receptors with open channels and that the final binding step is of low affinity (about 500 microM). A comparison with GABA-mediated postsynaptic currents suggests that the properties of the GABAA receptor play a major role in determining the shape of inhibitory synaptic responses and that the cleft concentration of GABA reaches at least 500 microM.
https://openalex.org/W2036661971,"The mechanism by which nucleosome cores are displaced and re-formed during transcription in vitro has been investigated. A nucleosome core was assembled on a short linear DNA template (227 bp) containing an SP6 RNA polymerase promoter and a nucleosome-positioning sequence. Transcription induced the translocation of the nucleosome core over 75 or 80 bp to two positions at the other end of the template, blocking the promoter. At low rNTP concentrations, transfer occurred only on the same template molecule, even in the presence of large excesses of competitor DNA. On a longer template (262 bp), nucleosome core position after transcription depended on its position before transcription. The data suggest that the octamer transfers without dissociation from DNA and provide strong evidence for a translocation mechanism in which DNA ahead of the polymerase uncoils from the octamer as the DNA behind coils around it. In this way, the octamer steps around the transcribing polymerase."
https://openalex.org/W1486363145,"Plasma membranes of several mammalian tissues are highly permeable to water due to the presence of CHIP, the 28-kDa channel-forming integral protein which is the archetypal member of the aquaporin family of water channel proteins. To define its native structure, purified red cell CHIP protein was reconstituted into lipid bilayers at a high protein-to-lipid ratio, and the resulting 3-microns diameter membrane vesicles were examined by high resolution electron microscopy. The reconstituted membranes contained highly ordered two-dimensional crystalline lattices of p422(1) symmetry in which each CHIP tetramer contained a central depression extending from the outer and inner surfaces of the membrane into the transbilayer domain of the molecule. The reconstituted membranes also exhibited extremely high osmotic water permeability, Pf = 0.472 cm/s, corresponding to the sum of activities of all incorporated CHIP molecules. These studies report the first two-dimensional crystallization of a biologically active water channel and provide direct evidence of the structure responsible for its pore-like behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1525229360,"A point mutation in the heavy chain of cardiac myosin, resulting in replacement of an arginine (Arg) with glutamine (Gln), has been linked to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in humans (Geisterfer-Lowrance, A. A. T., Kass, S., Tanigawa, G., Vosberg, H.-P., McKenna, W., Seidman, J. G., and Seidman, C. E. (1990) Cell 62, 999-1006). To determine the functional impact of this mutation, baculovirus-driven coexpression of myosin heavy and light chains has been developed. The Arg-403-->Gln mutation resulted in cardiac myosin with normal ATPase activity in the absence of actin. However, in the presence of actin, ATPase activity was greatly reduced (Vmax decreased > 3.5-fold and K(app) increased > 3-fold). In vitro motility was reduced nearly 5-fold by this single amino acid mutation. Thus, Arg-403 likely contributes to an important interaction at the actin interface of myosin. Replacement of Arg-403 with Gln leads to decreased rate(s) of transition within the actin-myosin crossbridge cycle. In humans, this mutation will result in decreased power output per unit area of cardiac muscle, likely providing a stimulus for hypertrophy."
https://openalex.org/W1509595973,"The balance between several components of the antioxidant defenses appears to be important for the cellular resistance to oxidative stress. While Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) transfectants of mouse epidermal cells JB6 clone 41 were sensitized to oxidants produced by xanthine/xanthine oxidase (X/XO) consecutive transfection with catalase corrected their hypersensitivity (Amstad, P., Peskin, A., Shah, G., Mirault, M. E., Moret, R., Zbinden, I., and Cerutti, P. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 9305-9313). We studied the effect of the transfection of bovine selenoglutathione peroxidase (GPx) on the sensitivity of JB6 clone 41 and its SOD transfectants. Sensitivity to DNA strand breakage and killing by X/XO was reversely related to the activity ratios GPx over SOD. A GPx-transfectant of JB6 clone 41 cells with a GPx/SOD ratio of 3.8 was very strongly protected. The hypersensitivity of the SOD clones with GPx/SOD ratios of 0.4 was corrected or overcorrected by secondary transfection with bovine Se-GPx resulting in increased activity ratios GPx/SOD of 1 to 2.4. Our results indicate that small deviations from the physiological activity ratios of GPx/SOD have a dramatic effect on the resistance of cells to oxidant-induced damage to the genome and cell killing."
https://openalex.org/W1496549373,"Integrin-associated protein (IAP) is a 50-kDa membrane protein with an amino-terminal immunoglobulin domain and a carboxyl-terminal multiply membrane-spanning region. It is physically and functionally associated with the integrin alpha v beta 3 vitronectin receptor and is involved in the increase in intracellular calcium concentration, which occurs upon cell adhesion to extracellular matrix. Oxidative burst in neutrophils can be induced or inhibited via IAP. Surprisingly, IAP is also expressed on erythrocytes, which have no known integrins. IAP has been shown to be identical to OA3, an ovarian carcinoma antigen. We now show that IAP expression is reduced on Rhnull erythrocytes. The IAP structural gene is mapped to q13.1-2 on human chromosome 3, within a region known to contain a gene encoding the Rh-associated 1D8 antigen. By expression studies on human erythrocytes and IAP transfectants, IAP is shown to be identical to the 1D8 antigen and to CD47, a cell surface protein with broad tissue distribution, reduced in expression on Rhnull erythrocytes. Two CD47 antibodies recognize the immunoglobulin domain of IAP, as does antibody 1D8. These studies suggest the possibility that IAP and the Rh polypeptides may share a pathway for membrane expression on erythrocytes. Furthermore, decreased expression of IAP on Rhnull cells may contribute to the these cells' abnormal cation permeabilities. These studies demonstrate an unexpected link between integrin signal transduction and erythrocyte membrane structure."
https://openalex.org/W1549865113,"Binding of interleukin-2 (IL-2) to the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) stimulates Src family kinases, tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins, conversion of Ras to its active GTP-bound form, and eventually c-fos, c-jun, and c-myc induction. The IL-2R beta chain plays a crucial role in IL-2R signaling. Within the cytoplasmic domain of the beta chain, a region essential for mitogenesis and another involved in binding the Src family kinase Lck have been defined. The beta chain itself is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon IL-2 stimulation. Since the adapter protein Shc acts upstream of Ras and is involved in T cell receptor-mediated Ras activation, we examined the role of Shc in IL-2 signaling. Shc was found to be tyrosine-phosphorylated upon IL-2 stimulation in CTLL-20 cells. After its phosphorylation, Shc interacted with another adapter protein, Grb2, and, via Grb2, with the Ras GTP/GDP exchange factor mSOS. After IL-2 stimulation, Shc also associated with the IL-2R beta chain. Thus, during IL-2 signaling, the interaction of Shc with the IL-2R beta chain and its simultaneous association with Grb2 and mSOS may couple IL-2R stimulation to Ras signaling."

The rotational correlation time range covered is from picoseconds to milliseconds. These rates are quantitatively explained by isotropic rotational Brownian dynamics, which modulate the interactions between the electron spin and the molecular angular momentum; the nitrogen and electron spins; and the solvent protons with both the electron and the nitrogen spins. This solves a 20-year-old problem that has limited scientific applications of nitroxides."
https://openalex.org/W2067334833,"High KCI or NMDA treatment promotes the survival of cultured neonatal cerebellar granule cells, and these cells become sensitive to NMDA toxicity after prolonged K+ depolarization. Following both treatments, the NMDA receptor increases, as assessed by fura-2 fluorescence analysis of NMDA receptor-mediated intracellular Ca2+ increase. Northern analysis indicates that both treatments specifically up-regulate NMDAR2A subunit mRNA through an increase in resting intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Antisense oligonucleotide analysis further indicates that NMDAR2A mRNA up-regulation is responsible for NMDA receptor induction. Our results demonstrate that regulation of a specific NMDA receptor subunit mRNA governs NMDA receptor induction, which is thought to play an important role in granule cell survival and death."

https://openalex.org/W2050231827,"The time courses of the γ-aminobutyric acid type B (GABAB) receptor-mediated inhibition of excitatory synaptic transmission and of action potential-evoked calcium currents were studied in hippocampal neurons in vitro with step-like changes of a saturating baclofen concentration. Inhibition mediated by postsynaptic GABAB receptors was excluded pharmacologically. Both presynaptic inhibition and reduction of calcium currents developed and declined exponentially with similar time constants of about 0.2 and 3 s, respectively. The close correlation of the time courses indicates that fast, G protein-mediated depression of voltage-gated calcium channels and thus direct reduction of the presynaptic 0calcium influx may contribute to the GABAB receptor-induced inhibition of excitatory synaptic transmission in hippocampal neurons in vitro."

https://openalex.org/W1965058295,"The gene poxn codes for a transcriptional regulator that specifies poly-innervated (chemosensory), as opposed to mono-innervated (mechanosensory), organs in Drosophila. The ectopic expression of poxn during metamorphosis results in a transformation of the morphology and central projection of adult mechanosensory organs toward those of chemosensory organs. Here we show, by electron microscopy analysis of normal and transformed bristles and by Dil labeling of the innervating neurons, that poxn also controls the number of neurons. To determine whether poxn can transform not only the sense organ precursor cells but also their daughter cells, we examine the effects of the ectopic expression of poxn at different stages of the lineage, and we conclude that poxn can act at a late stage to affect the fate of the undifferentiated neuron."
https://openalex.org/W1979451628,"We have cloned the gene for a potassium channel, Aplysia Shab, that is expressed in the bag cell neurons of Aplysia. The voltage dependence and kinetics of the Aplysia Shab current in oocytes match those of IK2, one of the two delayed rectifiers in these neurons. Like IK2, but in contrast with other members of the Shab subfamily, the Aplysia Shab current inactivates within several hundred milliseconds. This inactivation occurs by a process whose properties do not match those previously described for C-type and N-type mechanisms. Neither truncation of the N-terminus nor block by tetraethylammonium alters the time course of inactivation. By incorporating the characteristics of Aplysia Shab into a computational model, we have shown how this current contributes to the normal enhancement of action potentials that occurs in the bag cell neurons at the onset of neuropeptide secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1480136149,"The 9-cis-retinoic acid receptors (RXRs), belonging to the members of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily, act as auxiliary proteins, heterodimerizing with other nuclear receptors such as retinoic acid receptors (RARs), vitamin D receptor, thyroid hormone receptors, and peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor, thereby transactivating target genes in a ligand-dependent manner. We have previously reported that in the rat, thyroid hormone (TH) positively and negatively regulates the hepatic mRNA levels of RXR beta and RXR gamma, respectively. In the present study, we have tried to elucidate the level at which TH regulates the gene expression of RXR beta and RXR gamma in the rat. A RNA synthesis inhibitor (actinomycin D), but not a protein synthesis inhibitor (cycloheximide), blocked the induction of RXR beta mRNA by TH. On the other hand, none of these drugs inhibited the decrease of RXR gamma mRNA levels caused by TH. Nuclear run-on assays showed that the transcription rate of the RXR beta gene was positively regulated by TH, whereas the transcription of RXR gamma gene was not controlled by TH. Taken together, these results indicate that the gene expression of RXR beta is positively regulated by TH at transcriptional level, while the negative regulation of the RXR gamma gene expression by TH may occur at a post-transcriptional level in intact rat. Thus, the RXR-mediated signal transductions may be modulated in part through TH control of the levels of RXR beta and RXR gamma."
https://openalex.org/W1526215972,"Interleukin-1 (IL-1) plays a central role in mediating immune and inflammatory responses. Binding of IL-1 to the type I 80-kDa receptor results in generation of intracellular signals and activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa B. However, the nature of the signals required to generate NF-kappa B binding activity remains unclear. In this paper, we show that NF-kappa B1 (p50) and RelA (p65) were specifically translocated to the nucleus following activation of intact type I IL-1 receptor (IL-1R). The C-terminal region of the type I IL-1R is required for this effect, and deletion of its cytoplasmic domain abrogates the activation of NF-kappa B by IL-1. These results provide evidence that IL-1 modulates the activity of NF-kappa B through the type I IL-1 receptor and identifies a domain required for signal transduction to this specific transcription factor."
https://openalex.org/W2006483501,"In NG108-15 cells, bradykinin (BK) activates a potassium current (IK,BK) and inhibits the voltage-dependent calcium current (ICa,V). BK also stimulates a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC). The subsequent release of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and increase in intracellular calcium contribute to IK,BK, through activation of a calcium-dependent potassium current. In membranes from these cells, stimulation of PI-PLC by BK is mediated by Gq and/or G11, two homologous, pertussis toxin-insensitive G proteins. Here, we have investigated the role of Gq/11 in the electrical responses to BK. GTP gamma S mimicked and occluded both actions of BK, and both effects were insensitive to pertussis toxin. Perfusion of an anti-Gq/11 alpha antibody into the pipette suppressed IK,BK, but not the inhibition of ICa,V by BK. Thus, BK couples to IK,BK via Gq/11, but coupling to ICa,V is most likely via a different, pertussis toxin-insensitive G protein."

https://openalex.org/W1583172966,"While much is known about the mechanisms by which members of the receptor tyrosine kinase family effect mitogenic signal transduction, much less is known about such mechanisms for members of the hematopoietic cytokine receptor family. In an effort to determine the extent to which the signal transduction mechanisms of these two receptor families may be related, we constructed and tested interfamily hybrid receptors. Two hybrid receptors consisting of the ligand-binding domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR), as well as the parental EPOR or EGFR, were introduced into interleukin-3-dependent 32D cells. Part of the EPOR extracellular region containing a conserved WSXWS amino acid motif was present in one of the hybrid receptors but not in the other. Cells expressing EGFR grew only poorly in response to EGF, whereas cells expressing either of the EGFR/EPOR hybrid receptors or EPOR grew robustly in epidermal growth factor or erythropoietin, respectively. This is the first demonstration of a chimera between these two unrelated receptor families that responds to ligand stimulation. The results indicate that the mechanisms by which receptor tyrosine kinases and cytokine receptors propagate mitogenic signals are sufficiently similar to allow interchange of their ligand binding domains and that generation of an efficient mitogenic signal by a cytokine receptor depends primarily on its cytoplasmic and/or transmembrane regions."

In vitro, the expression of this gene immediately precedes terminal differentiation, as measured by the synthesis of those proteins that make up the contractile apparatus. However, during mammalian development, expression of myogenin and the appearance of sarcomeres are separated by at least 1 week. The observation that early embryos (10.5 days post coitum) do not possess myogenin protein despite the fact that transcripts are detected (Cusella-De Angelis et al. (1992) J.

Using polymerase chain reaction and in situ analyses, we report here that the mouse embryo accumulates a significant pool of unprocessed myogenin RNA in the developing somites (10.5 days post coitum). These results indicate that post-transcriptional regulation of myogenin may occur at the RNA processing level."
