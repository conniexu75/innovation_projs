https://openalex.org/W2072585523,"Analysis of the cell culture fluid from two new human hepatoma-derived cell lines reveals that 17 of the major human plasma proteins are synthesized and secreted by these cells. One of these cell lines, Hep 3B, also produces the two major polypeptides of the hepatitis B virus surface antigen. When Hep 3B in injected into athymic mice, metastatic hepatocellular carcinomas appear. These cell lines provide experimental models for investigation of plasma protein biosynthesis and the relation of the hepatitis B viru genome to tumorigenicity."
https://openalex.org/W2139129258,"The unique properties of agonist binding to the frog erythrocyte beta-adrenergic receptor include the existence of two affinity forms of the receptor. The proportion and relative affinity of these two states of the receptor for ligands varies with the intrinsic activity of the agonist and the presence of guanine nucleotides. The simplest model for hormone-receptor interactions which can explain and reproduce the experimental data involves the interaction of the receptor R with an additional membrane component X, leading to the agonist-promoted formation of a high affinity ternary complex HRX. Computer modeling of agonist binding data with a ternary complex model indicates that the model can fit the data with high accuracy under conditions where the ligand used is either a full or a partial agonist and where the system is altered by the addition of guanine nucleotide or after treatment with group-specific reagents, e.g. p-hydroxymercuribenzoate. The parameter estimates obtained indicate that the intrinsic activity of the agonist is correlated significantly with the affinity constant L of the component X for the binary complex HR. The major effect of adding guanine nucleotides is to destabilize the ternary complex HRX from which both the hormone H and the component X can dissociate. The modulatory role of nucleotides on the affinity of agonists for the receptor is consistent with the assumption that the component X is the guanine nucleotide binding site. The ternary complex model was also applied successfully to the turkey erythrocyte receptor system. The model provides a general scheme for the activation by agonists of adenylate cyclase-coupled receptor systems and also of other systems where the effector might be different."

https://openalex.org/W1510153624,"A small heat-stable polypeptide, ATP-dependent proteolysis factor 1 (APF-1), is an essential component of the ATP-dependent proteolytic system of rabbit reticulocytes (Ciechanover, A., Hod, Y., and Hershko. A. (1978) Biochem. Biophys. Res Commun. 81, 1100-1105). The following evidence supports the view that APF-1 is ubiquitin, a highly conserved heat-stable polypeptide found universally in nature: 1) APF-1 and ubiquitin (generously given by G. Goldstein) yield co-migrating bands on five polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis systems and in isoelectric focusing; 2) amino acid analysis shows excellent agreement between the two proteins; 3) APF-1 and ubiquitin give similar specific activity, in activating the ATP-dependent proteolysis system; 4) 125I-APF-1 and 125I-ubiquitin form electrophoretically identical covalent conjugates with endogenous reticulocyte proteins. Recently, such conjugates have been proposed as the active intermediates in ATP-dependent proteolysis (Ciechanover, A., Heller, H., Hershko, A., Haas, A.L., and Rose, I.A. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 77, 1783-1786). Thus, ubiquitin is an essential component of the ATP-dependent system in reticulocytes and a similar role in degradation and proteolytic processing in other cells is likely."

https://openalex.org/W1584190876,"The regulatory subunits of both isozymes of cAMP-dependent protein kinase bind 2 mol of cAMP/mol of monomer. cAMP dissociation studies indicate similar cAMP binding behavior for each isozyme. Each has two different intrachain cAMP binding components present in approximately equal amounts and the rate of cAMP dissociation is 5- to 10-fold slower from one site (Site 1) than from the other (Site 2). Equilibrium [3H]cAMP binding is inhibited by several competing cyclic nucleotides. Following equilibrium binding using saturating [3H]cAMP in the presence of competing nucleotide, the pattern of release of [3H]cAMP, monitored in the presence of an excess of nonradioactive cAMP, suggests site-specific selectivity of some of the cyclic nucleotides. As compared with cAMP, cIMP prefers Site 2 for both regulatory subunits, whereas N6, O2-dibutyryl-cAMP shows a similar preference only with isozyme II regulatory subunit. 8-Bromo-cAMP, 8-bromo-cGMP, and 8-azido-cAMP prefer Site 1 of both proteins. The results indicate that for each isozyme the two intrachain binding sites have different analogue specificities and cAMP dissociation rates. Site 1 or Site 2 of one isozyme has a similar but not identical cyclic nucleotide specificity and cAMP dissociation rate to the corresponding site of the other isozyme."

https://openalex.org/W1907162842,"The basal activity of tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (EC-1.13.11.11) in primary cultured rat hepatocytes decreased during culture, but addition of either tryptophan (2.5 x 10(-3) M) or dexamethasone (1 x 10(-6) M) could prevent the decrease. Addition of both compounds caused severalfold induction of activity. Glucagon (1 x 10(-8) M) alone did not induce the activity, but its inductive effect in combination with tryptophan was similar to that of tryptophan plus dexamethasone. The effect of glucagon was additive with those of tryptophan and dexamethasone and hence the highest induction (7-fold) was achieved by addition of all three inducers. Glucagon could be replaced by dibutyryl cyclic AMP (1 x 10(-5) M). Insulin (1 x 10(-8) M) inhibited the inductions by glucagon and dexamethasone, but not that by tryptophan. Cycloheximide inhibited the inductions by all three inducers, but actinomycin D inhibited only the induction by dexamethasone. These results suggest that the three compounds have different mechanisms of induction of tryptophan oxygenase activity: tryptophan prevents enzyme inactivation, dexamethasone may stimulate enzyme synthesis at the level of transcription, and glucagon may enhance the synthesis at the translational level."

https://openalex.org/W1484384142,"Incubation of the 125I-labeled apoprotein, prepared from 125I-labeled iso-1-cytochrome c, with a yeast mitochondrial fraction in the presence of hemin, NADPH, and an extract of the postmitochondrial fraction at 32 +/- 1 degree C for 30 min has resulted in formation of cytochrome c-like species in yields of up to 35%. This radioactive synthesized species contains a functional group which responds to reduction with ascorbate and oxidation with K3Fe(CN)6 in that it is resistant in the reduced form and susceptible in the oxidized form to trypsin action in a manner characteristic of native cytochrome c. The functional group cannot be removed from the protein by cold HCl-acetone or 8 M urea treatment. The reduced form of the synthesized species exhibits resistance against autoxidation and the oxidized form can be reduced also by cytochrome b2. The synthesized species exhibits the same compact hydrodynamic volume of native cytochrome c. Treatment with silver sulfate followed by incubation with dithiothreitol converts the synthesized species to the original apoprotein as judged by an increase in the hydrodynamic volume. Thus, the synthesized species is indistinguishable from the original labeled iso-1-cytochrome c by these measurements; i.e. the synthesized species consists of the apoprotein to which heme is covalently attached through the thioether bond(s). The active factor of the mitochondrial fraction is heat-labile. The synthetic activity is strongly dependent on pH with a maximum approximately at pH 7.0. Hemin (or heme) appears to be required for this synthesis. The postmitochondrial fraction is inactive by itself. However, its addition markedly increases the synthetic activity. This factor is heat-stable, soluble in 80% methanol (or 75% ethanol), and insoluble in ethyl ether or ethyl acetate. Addition of NADP(H) (or NAD(H)) also increases the synthetic activity, the reduced form being more effective than the oxidized form. The postmitochondrial factor and the pyridine nucleotides appear to enhance the effect of each other. Thus, it seems that cytochrome c or a cytochrome c-like species is formed from the apoprotein and heme (or hemin) by an enzyme, cytochrome c synthetase, present in mitochondria."

https://openalex.org/W2008667545,"The chemotaxis of leukocytes appears to be initiated by the binding of chemotactic factors to the surface of these cells. N-Formylated peptides induce chemotaxis and lysosomal enzyme secretion of leukocytes; because these peptides are available in a purified radiolabeled form, they have been useful in the characterization of receptors for chemotactic factors. Equine polymorphonuclear leukocytes secrete lysosomal enzymes but do not exhibit chemotaxis in response to the N-formylated peptides, even though they have a high-affinity cell surface receptor for these agents. The specificity of the equine receptor resembles the specificity of the receptor on chemotactically responsive leukocytes from other species. Equine polymorphonuclear leukocytes may thus be an excellent model for the study of the events that lead to a biological response following receptor occupancy."

The larger proteolytic fragment represents the COOH-terminal portion of the enzyme and contains the catalytic site along with the cGMP binding site.

https://openalex.org/W1556023594,"The rotational mobility of spin-labeled bovine heart mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase in purified form, and incorporated into lipid vesicles was studied. A rigidly attached short chain maleimide spin label permitted mobility by saturation transfer electron paramagnetic resonance. A long chain maleimide spin label was used to detect the fluidity of the lipid hydrocarbon region adjacent to the protein by conventional EPR. One method of preparing the purified enzyme resulted in a high degree of protein rotational mobility at 4/sup 0/C both in the purified detergent-solubilized enzyme (effective rotational correlation time of 100 ns) and in reconstituted membranes (correlation time of 40 ..mu..s). By contrast, another purification procedure resulted in little or no submillisecond protein rotational mobility both in purified form and in reconstituted membranes, suggesting the presence of large protein aggregates. Thus, the state of aggregation of cytochrome oxidase in membranes appears to depend on the state of aggregation prior to reconstitution. The mobile and immobile enzymes had the same high activity. In both reconstituted preparations, the bulk of the lipid was quite fluid at 4/sup 0/C, as probed by a free fatty acid spin label. The lipid hydrocarbon region adjacent to the protein, as probed by the long chain more » maleimide spin label, was also quite fluid in the membranes containing mobile enzyme,but was strongly immobilized in the membranes containing immobile enzyme. Thus, the strong immobilization of lipid in our preparations of cytochrome oxidase is apparently caused by protein-protein interactions, not by rigidity at the protein-lipid boundary. « less"
https://openalex.org/W1513061804,"We have recently demonstrated that cytosol from mouse kidney contains a receptor-like binding protein for 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25-(OH)2D3). The present studies were undertaken to investigate whether this component undergoes nuclear translocation, thus adding support to the contention that this binding moiety represents a receptor for 1,25-(OH)2D3. Kidney slices from vitamin D-deficient mice were incubated with 1,25-(OH)2[3H]D3 and specific binding was assessed in cytosol and 0.3 M KCl extracts of isolated nuclei. The appearance of specific nuclear-bound 1,25-(OH)2[3H]D3 exhibited a saturation time course and the increase in nuclear binding was accompanied by a concomitant decrease in cytoplasmic binding such that, by 120 min, approximately 80% of specifically bound 1,25-(OH)2[3H]D3 was associated with the nuclear fraction and approximately 20% remained in the cytoplasmic compartment. The nuclear transfer was found to be temperature-dependent and specific for the dihydroxy metabolite. Both the cytoplasmic and nuclear receptors sedimented at 3.2 S in 0.3 M KCl sucrose density gradients. However, under low salt conditions, the cytoplasmic receptor was transformed to yield an approximately 5.4 S peak while the nuclear receptor sedimented unchanged t 3.2 S. In summary, the cytoplasmic 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor in mammalian kidney undergoes temperature-dependent nuclear translocation and the cytoplasmic and nuclear forms of the receptor can be distinguished by their sedimentation properties."

The molecular weight of this protein has been estimated to be about 3000 by urea/sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis and amino acid analysis. The isolated protein has been shown to have high affinity and high specificity for Ca2+ (Jeng, A. Y., Ryan T. E., and Shamoo, A. E. (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 75, 2125-2129). However, the protein was found to be contaminated with a large amount of phospholipids. There are 150 mol of phospholipids associated with each mole of the protein. The protein is delipidated using Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography. The contaminating phospholipids can be reduced to 0.1 mol of phospholipids/mol of protein. There are no detectable free fatty acids, hexosamines, or sialic acids associated with the delipidated protein. This protein is named calciphorin, meaning calcium ionophore protein."
https://openalex.org/W1561293384,"During the course of studying the soluble cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases of a developing insect, three different enzymes were isolated. Two of these were found to be cAMP-dependent enzymes eluting from DEAE-cellulose in a manner identical with protein kinases I and II found in vertebrate muscle. The third enzyme appears to be unique. It has high affinity for either cAMP or cGMP (KA of 43 nM and 25 nM, respectively), the only cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinase described, to have this property. The enzyme has lower affinity for cIMP and cCMP (KA of 160 nM and 340 nM, respectively). Binding to cyclic nucleotide does not alter enzyme size. The KM for ATP is 86 microM, and among several types of histones tried, the slightly lysine-rich subgroup f2a was the best phosphate acceptor. Maximum activity was obtained with 1 mM Mg2+ while Mn2+ was completely ineffective. This new enzyme was purified to homogeneity on a cAMP affinity column as judged by two-dimensional electrophoresis. On the basis of molecular sieving and sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis we have reached the preliminary conclusion that the native enzyme is a dimer of identical subunits with a molecular weight of 180,000. If the mammalian cAMP and cGMP enzymes are indeed homologous proteins, perhaps we have in this new kinase a species that represents a common ancestral protein."

The carboxymethylated enzyme consists of a single polypeptide chain of 98 amino acid residues with an acetyl group blocking the NH2 terminus and a tyrosine at the COOH terminus. The calculated molecular weight of the native protein, a mixed disulfide with glutathione, is 11,365. The carboxymethylated protein was cleaved by cyanogen bromide. The three expected fragments were purified; moreover, an additional fragment, derived from a partial failure of cleavage at methionine-24, was purified and characterized. The structures of the cyanogen bromide fragments were established by subfragmentation with endopeptidases, and the sequences of the overlapping subfragments were determined. From the results, it was possible to order the peptides within the sequence and then to establish the complete primary structure of the enzyme."

The compounds designed have been shown to have biological activity in guinea pig ileum tests.

Affinity to and inactivation of the opiate receptor is obtained with two of the compounds which have affinities and activities comparable to morphine.
https://openalex.org/W1546723275,"Micromolar concentrations of GDP or GTP stimulate protein synthesis by isolated yeast mitochondria 3- to 10-fold even if alpha-ketoglutarate and an ATP-regenerating system are present. No stimulation is observed with GMP, UTP, CTP, TTP, and the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogues guanyl(beta, gamma-methylene) diphosphate and guanyl imidodiphosphate. This stimulatory effect of exogenously added guanyl nucleotides may answer the long standing question why protein synthesis by isolated mitochondria is so slow. It can also explain previous reports by two other laboratories that a high speed supernatant from yeast cells stimulates protein synthesis by isolated mitochondria. The supernatant contains nondialyzable GMP which is converted to GDP under the conditions used for assaying mitochondrial protein synthesis. The stimulatory effect of high speed supernatants is abolished by 5'-nucleotidase (which degrades GMP) or by trypsin (which destroys supernatant protein(s) necessary for converting GMP to GDP). No evidence was obtained that the stimulatory effect of high speed supernatants was caused by precursors to cytoplasmically made cytochrome c oxidase subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1586385600,"An acute chick kidney tubule model was used to evaluate the molecular specificity of steroids which act to inhibit kidney 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-1-hydroxylase and induce 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-24-hydroxylase enzyme activities. Such hydroxylase-regulatory activity was confined to the vitamin D family of secosteroids. Vitamin D3 per se was not active. Rather, expression of hydroxylase-regulatory activity required acquisition of a C-25 hydroxyl grouping. Of the metabolites tested, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 demonstrated the greatest hydroxylase-regulatory activity. Metabolites of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 which contained hydroxyl groups at carbon atoms 1, or 24, or both, were also active in regulating the kidney hydroxylase enzymes. The hydroxylase-regulatory action of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 was blocked by inhibitors of RNA or protein synthesis, implicating a requirement for de novo protein synthesis. It was suggested that the regulatory process involves both hydroxylase-enzyme synthesis and turnover as well as enzyme-level modulation of endogenous enzyme activities."

P. (1979) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 90,634-640). In this paper, free and tRNA-bound 60 S subunits were treated with increasing concentrations of LiCl to obtain information on tRNA binding site. The rationale for using deacylated tRNA was that it is assumed to bind to the peptidyl donor site. We observed that tRNA has a strong protective effect on subunit modifications produced by LiCl: tRNA prevents subunit inactivation as measured by puromycin reaction and polyphenylalanine synthesis and it shifts the Li+/Mg2+ ratio value needed to reach 50% inactivation, from 60 to 250; it also prevents ribosomal protein and 5 S RNA release and large sedimentation changes of subunits, induced by LiCl. To explain the mechanism of 60 S subunit stabilization by tRNA, two hypotheses are considered: stabilization can be consequent on direct interaction of tRNA with specific proteins, or on maintenance on subunits of essential cations which are otherwise displaced by Li+, or both."

The purified inhibitor had a molecular weight in the range from 2,000 to 3,500 and an absorption maximum at 260 nm at pH 7.0. When the inhibitor was digested by snake venom phosphodiesterase, the inhibitory potency was lost, yielding 5'-AMP and 2'-(5'-phosphoribosyl)-5'-AMP as the digestion products which were identified by high pressure liquid chromatography. The inhibitory potency was neutralized specifically by anti-poly(ADP-ribose) antiserum. The profile of inhibition by the isolated inhibitor was nearly identical with that produced by authentic poly(ADP-ribose). It was therefore concluded that the inhibitor isolated was identical with poly(ADP-ribose), whose chain length ranged from 4 to 7 ADP-ribosyl units. This is the first demonstration that a intracellular protease inhibitor can be endogenous poly(ADP-ribose)."
https://openalex.org/W1650963173,"T5 DNA polymerase catalyzes both 5' leads to 3' polymerization and 3' leads to 5' hydrolysis in a processive fashion. This knowledge has been utilized to obtain evidence indicating that the enzyme has a single primer-template binding which can function as either polymerase or exonuclease, perhaps with the cooperation of additional or different side groups. Template-dependent conversion of dNTP leads to dNMP was observed with an excess of either primer-template or enzyme. With primer-template excess, practically all the enzymes were functional as polymerase; with enzyme excess, all primer-templates were extended during the first cycle of catalysis. These observations suggest that turnover takes place at the points of chain growth. Evidence is also provided which demonstrates that the enzyme is capable of switching its direction of catalysis from 3' leads to 5' to 5' leads to 3' without leaving the primer-template. A clear correspondence between the relative amount of hydrolysis of a terminally labeled residue on the primer and the relative amount of turnover suggests that (a) the probability of hydrolysis of a given type of residue in contact with the active site is constant, and (b) during each turnover episode enzyme usually takes only one step in the 3' leads to 5' direction. A simple probabilistic model of turnover is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1564464101,"Abstract We have studied the linear electric field effect in pulsed EPR of the EPR-detectable signal of beef heart cytochrome c oxidase and have compared our results with those for a variety of square planar and tetrahedral Cu(II) model compounds and with Cu(II) proteins containing either type 1 or type 2 copper. The electric field induced g shifts (linear electric field effect) for cytochrome oxidase are comparable in magnitude to those for simple Cu(II) complexes and for some copper proteins containing type 2 sites. The shifts are smaller than those for tetrahedral copper complexes and for type 1 copper sites. However, the magnetic field dependence of the linear electric field effect does not resemble that observed for any Cu(II) complex studied nor for type 1 copper.

The NH2- and COOH-terminal amino acid sequences of p27 and p27(0) and their mild acid-cleavage fragments have been determined. These results show the existence of an identical cleavage site and a similar NH2- and COOH-terminal amino acid sequence in both the polypeptides. Furthermore they indicate that the difference in the molecular weights of p27 and p27(0) results from an insertion of amino acids in the COOH-terminal peptide of p27(0) rather than a shift in the scission site of the precursor molecule."

The ESR spectra of the labeled enzyme derivatives suggested that this essential sulfhydryl residue is located in a pocket, whereas the nonessential sulfhydryl residues are probably located near the surface. By varying the length of the nitroxide spin-labeled N-ethylmaleimide derivatives, it was determined that the liberated essential cysteine residues are in a restricted environment. The ESR spectral data also suggested that the nitroxide radical and the essential copper in the enzyme do not interact with one another. The effect of ionic strength, pH, and urea denaturation on the environment of the essential sulfhydryl residue were also investigated."

VS virus released from infected CHO MI sterol auxotroph cells grown in delipidated serum had a 50% lower ratio of cholesterol to phospholipid and an 80% drop in infectivity measured by plaque formation on L-929 cells compared with VS virus released from infected CHO MI cells grown in fetal calf serum. When VS virus was harvested from infected BHK-21 cells fed the choline analogue dimethylethanolamine, 29% of the membrane phospholipids were phosphatidyldimethylethanolamine (PDME); 87% of the PDME was located in the external monolayer of the virus membrane as determined by phospholipase C hydrolysis. Exogenous fatty acids added to the medium of cells infected with VS virus comprised up to 30% of the fatty acyl chains of the viral glycerophospholipids. The presence of PDME or unusual fatty acyl chains in the viral membrane had no effect on viral infectivity.

https://openalex.org/W1521460339,"The guanidinium chloride-unfolded state of ribonuclease A was found to be an equilibrium mixture of slow- and fast-refolding forms of the protein chain, as has been suggested. Both forms appear to have the same spectroscopic observables as judged by the relative changes in fluorescence emission and polarization. The equilibrium between them is thermally dependent, with deltaHapp equal to -1.4 kcal/mol. The activation energy Ea is equal to 18 kcal/mol. These findings are consistent with the proposal that cis-trans isomerism of peptide bonds that are NH2-terminal to proline residues is responsible for the slow phase of RNase A refolding. However, the actual dependence of the magnitude of the slow reaction on initial, prefolding temperature cannot be explained by a model in which the proline configurations of the fast refolding form must be identical to those of the native protein, as has been suggested. Instead, the data reveal that, although the native structure of RNase A contains two cis prolines, cis isomers need not be present in the fast-refolding form in order for folding to occur."

This new oxidase form is postulated to be the intermediate in the catalytic cycle of the oxidase that results in the formation of the 418-nm form of the oxidized oxidase; it is further postulated that the 445-nm form is the intermediate in the catalytic cycle that results in the 428-nm form of the oxidized oxidase. The relevance of the 443-nm, 603-nm form to the conformational cycle of the oxidase as well as its possible involvement in energy transduction at Site II of oxidative phosphorylation are discussed."
