https://openalex.org/W2563361853,"Using a metagenomic approach, three types of CRISPR–Cas systems have been discovered in uncultivated bacterial and archaeal hosts from a variety of different environments. Current CRISPR–Cas technology is based on systems identified from cultured bacteria, whereas the enzymes from the numerous prokaryotes that have not been cultured have remained unexplored. By using cultivation-independent genome-resolved metagenomics, Jillian Banfield, Jennifer Doudna and colleagues identify and then functionally characterize new CRISPR–Cas systems. These include the first reported Cas9 in the archaeal domain of life, which was thought to lack such systems, as well as compact CRISPR–CasX and CRISPR–CasY systems. Genomic exploration of environmental microbial communities gives access to unprecedented genome diversity with the potential to revolutionize microbe-based biotechnologies. CRISPR–Cas systems provide microbes with adaptive immunity by employing short DNA sequences, termed spacers, that guide Cas proteins to cleave foreign DNA1,2. Class 2 CRISPR–Cas systems are streamlined versions, in which a single RNA-bound Cas protein recognizes and cleaves target sequences3,4. The programmable nature of these minimal systems has enabled researchers to repurpose them into a versatile technology that is broadly revolutionizing biological and clinical research5. However, current CRISPR–Cas technologies are based solely on systems from isolated bacteria, leaving the vast majority of enzymes from organisms that have not been cultured untapped. Metagenomics, the sequencing of DNA extracted directly from natural microbial communities, provides access to the genetic material of a huge array of uncultivated organisms6,7. Here, using genome-resolved metagenomics, we identify a number of CRISPR–Cas systems, including the first reported Cas9 in the archaeal domain of life, to our knowledge. This divergent Cas9 protein was found in little-studied nanoarchaea as part of an active CRISPR–Cas system. In bacteria, we discovered two previously unknown systems, CRISPR–CasX and CRISPR–CasY, which are among the most compact systems yet discovered. Notably, all required functional components were identified by metagenomics, enabling validation of robust in vivo RNA-guided DNA interference activity in Escherichia coli. Interrogation of environmental microbial communities combined with in vivo experiments allows us to access an unprecedented diversity of genomes, the content of which will expand the repertoire of microbe-based biotechnologies."
https://openalex.org/W2569236205,"Most psychological studies rely on student samples. Students are usually considered as more homogenous than representative samples both within and across countries. However, little is known about the nature of the differences between student and representative samples. This is an important gap, also because knowledge about the degree of difference between student and representative samples may allow to infer from the former to the latter group. Across 59 countries and 12 personality (Big-5) and attitudinal variables we found that differences between students and general public were partly substantial, incoherent, and contradicted previous findings. Two often used cultural variables, embeddedness and intellectual autonomy, failed to explain the differences between both groups across countries. We further found that students vary as much as the general population both between and within countries. In summary, our results indicate that generalizing from students to the general public can be problematic when personal and attitudinal variables are used, as students vary mostly randomly from the general public. Findings are also discussed in terms of the replication crisis within psychology."
https://openalex.org/W2564082370,"The 1S–2S transition in magnetically trapped atoms of antihydrogen is observed, and its frequency is shown to be consistent with that expected for hydrogen. Testing to high precision whether matter behaves like antimatter could provide clues to one of the biggest puzzles in modern physics: why does the observable Universe consist almost entirely of matter? After all, the Standard Model predicts that after the Big Bang the Universe should have been made up of equal amounts of matter and antimatter. Antimatter is difficult to produce and characterize because it annihilates when it comes in contact with matter. But recent advances at CERN's Antiproton Decelerator have allowed researchers to trap and measure both antiprotons and antihydrogen. Now the ALPHA Collaboration at CERN reports the first spectroscopic characterization of antihydrogen, exciting the 1S to 2S transition with laser light. The transition frequency is consistent with that of hydrogen. The spectrum of ordinary hydrogen has been characterized to extremely high precision, so improvements in antihydrogen spectroscopy will yield highly sensitive tests of matter–antimatter symmetry. The spectrum of the hydrogen atom has played a central part in fundamental physics over the past 200 years. Historical examples of its importance include the wavelength measurements of absorption lines in the solar spectrum by Fraunhofer, the identification of transition lines by Balmer, Lyman and others, the empirical description of allowed wavelengths by Rydberg, the quantum model of Bohr, the capability of quantum electrodynamics to precisely predict transition frequencies, and modern measurements of the 1S–2S transition by Hänsch1 to a precision of a few parts in 1015. Recent technological advances have allowed us to focus on antihydrogen—the antimatter equivalent of hydrogen2,3,4. The Standard Model predicts that there should have been equal amounts of matter and antimatter in the primordial Universe after the Big Bang, but today’s Universe is observed to consist almost entirely of ordinary matter. This motivates the study of antimatter, to see if there is a small asymmetry in the laws of physics that govern the two types of matter. In particular, the CPT (charge conjugation, parity reversal and time reversal) theorem, a cornerstone of the Standard Model, requires that hydrogen and antihydrogen have the same spectrum. Here we report the observation of the 1S–2S transition in magnetically trapped atoms of antihydrogen. We determine that the frequency of the transition, which is driven by two photons from a laser at 243 nanometres, is consistent with that expected for hydrogen in the same environment. This laser excitation of a quantum state of an atom of antimatter represents the most precise measurement performed on an anti-atom. Our result is consistent with CPT invariance at a relative precision of about 2 × 10−10."
https://openalex.org/W2563999700,"Chicoric acid (CA), a natural phenolic acid extracted from chicory and the echinacea (purple coneflower) plant (Echinacea purpurea), has been regarded as a nutraceutical that has powerful antioxidant and antiobesity activities. We investigated the inhibitory effects of CA on systemic inflammation-induced neuroinflammation, amyloidogenesis, and cognitive impairment. C57BL/6J mice were treated with 0.05% CA in the drinking water for 45 d. The mice were then treated by intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). It was found that CA prevented LPS-induced memory impairment and neuronal loss through behavioral tests and histological exam-ination. Furthermore, amyloidogenesis in the CNS was detected. The results showed that CA prevented LPS-induced increases in amyloid β (1–42 specific) (Aβ1–42) accumulation, levels of amyloid precursor protein, and neuronal β-secretase 1 (BACE1), as well as the equilibrium cholinergic system in mouse brain. Moreover, CA down-regulated LPS-induced glial overactivation by inhibiting the MAPK and NF-κB pathway. Consequently, CA reduced the levels of NF-κB transcriptionally regulated inflammatory mediators and cytokines such as iNOS, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), IL-1β, and TNF-α in both mouse brain and BV2 microglial cells. These results demonstrated that CA alleviated memory impairment and amyloidogenesis triggered by LPS through suppressing NF-κB transcriptional pathway, suggesting that CA might be a plausible therapeutic intervention for neuroinflammation-related diseases such as Alzheimer disease. —Liu, Q., Chen, Y., Shen, C., Xiao, Y., Wang, Y., Liu, Z., Liu, X.

https://openalex.org/W2562121859,"Research on the human microbiome, the microbiota that live in, on, and around the human person, has revolutionized our understanding of the complex interactions between microbial life and human health and disease. The microbiome may also provide a valuable tool in forensic death investigations by helping to reveal the postmortem interval (PMI) of a decedent that is discovered after an unknown amount of time since death. Current methods of estimating PMI for cadavers discovered in uncontrolled, unstudied environments have substantial limitations, some of which may be overcome through the use of microbial indicators. In this project, we sampled the microbiomes of decomposing human cadavers, focusing on the skin microbiota found in the nasal and ear canals. We then developed several models of statistical regression to establish an algorithm for predicting the PMI of microbial samples. We found that the complete data set, rather than a curated list of indicator species, was preferred for training the regressor. We further found that genus and family, rather than species, are the most informative taxonomic levels. Finally, we developed a k-nearest- neighbor regressor, tuned with the entire data set from all nasal and ear samples, that predicts the PMI of unknown samples with an average error of ±55 accumulated degree days (ADD). This study outlines a machine learning approach for the use of necrobiome data in the prediction of the PMI and thereby provides a successful proof-of- concept that skin microbiota is a promising tool in forensic death investigations."
https://openalex.org/W2567083946,"Cement is one of the mostly used construction materials due to its high durability and low cost, but it suffers from brittle fracture and facile crack initiation. This article describes the use of naturally-derived renewable cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) to reinforce cement. The effects of CNFs on the mechanical properties, degree of hydration (DOH), and microstructure of cement pastes have been studied. It is found that an addition of 0.15% by weight of CNFs leads to a 15% and 20% increase in the flexural and compressive strengths of cement paste. The enhancement in mechanical strength is attributed to high DOH and dense microstructure of cement pastes after adding CNFs."
https://openalex.org/W2561368645,"Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) are the key transcription factors that modulate lipid biosynthesis. SREBPs are synthesized as endoplasmic reticulum-bound precursors that require proteolytic activation in the Golgi apparatus. The stability and maturation of precursor SREBPs depend on their binding to SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), which escorts the SCAP-SREBP complex to the Golgi apparatus. In this study, we identified heat shock protein (HSP) 90 as a novel SREBP regulator that binds to and stabilizes SCAP-SREBP. In HepG2 cells, HSP90 inhibition led to proteasome-dependent degradation of SCAP-SREBP, which resulted in the down-regulation of SREBP target genes and the reduction in intracellular triglyceride and cholesterol levels. We also demonstrated in vivo that HSP90 inhibition decreased SCAP-SREBP protein, down-regulated SREBP target genes, and reduced lipids levels in mouse livers. We propose that HSP90 plays an indispensable role in SREBP regulation by stabilizing the SCAP-SREBP complex, facilitating the activation of SREBP to maintain lipids homeostasis."

The goal of this study was to determine the transcriptomic profile of the spleen (S), cecal tonsils (CT), and large intestine (LI) of adult chickens injected with prebiotics and synbiotics in ovo. On day 12 of embryo development, incubating eggs were injected with prebiotics: inulin alone (P1) or in combination with Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis IBB2955 (S1), galactooligosaccharides (GOS) alone (P2) or in combination with Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris IBB477 (S2); control group (C) was mock injected with physiological saline. Gene expression analysis was conducted using an Affymetrix Chicken Gene 1.1 ST Array Strip. Most of the differentially expressed genes (DEG) were detected in the cecal tonsils of P2 (378 DEG), and were assigned to gene ontology categories: lymphocyte proliferation, activation and differentiation, and cytokine production. Ingenuity pathway analysis of the DEG (CT of P2) indicated the inhibition of humoral and cellular immune responses, e.g., role of NFAT in regulation of immune responses, phagocytosis, production of nitric oxide, NF-κB, IL-8, and CXCR4 signaling. The DEG with the highest up-regulation from S1 and P2 were involved in gene expression (PAPOLA, RPL27A, RPLP1, and RPS29) from P1 and P2 in transport (BEST4, SLC9A3, and SLC13A2), metabolism (OGT, ALPP, CA4, and CA7), signaling (FGG, G3BP2, UBB, G3BP2, CACNA1G, and ATP6V0A4), and immune responses (MSMB, LGALS3, CABIN1, CXCR5, PAX5, and TNFRSF14). Two DEG influencing the complement system (SERPING1 and MIR1674) were down-regulated in P2 and S1. In conclusion, GOS injected in ovo provided the most potent stimulation of the host transcriptome. This is likely due to its strong bifidogenic effect, which triggers proliferation of indigenous embryonic microflora in ovo, and indirectly influences gene expression regulation in host tissues, especially cecal tonsils."
https://openalex.org/W2562326542,"Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is an important mediator of hormonal stimulation of cell growth and differentiation through its activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade. Two small G proteins, Ras and Rap1 have been proposed to mediate this activation. Using HEK293 cells as a model system, we have recently shown that both Ras and Rap1 are required for cAMP signaling to ERKs. However, cAMP-dependent Ras signaling to ERKs is transient and rapidly terminated by PKA phosphorylation of the Raf isoforms C-Raf and B-Raf. In contrast, cAMP-dependent Rap1 signaling to ERKs and Rap1 is potentiated by PKA. We show that this is due to sustained binding of B-Raf to Rap1. One of the targets of PKA is Rap1 itself, directly phosphorylating Rap1a on serine 180 and Rap1b on serine 179. We show that these phosphorylations create potential binding sites for the adaptor protein 14-3-3 that links Rap1 to the scaffold protein KSR. These results suggest that Rap1 activation of ERKs requires PKA phosphorylation and KSR binding. Because KSR and B-Raf exist as heterodimers within the cell, this binding also brings B-Raf to Rap1, allowing Rap1 to couple to ERKs through B-Raf binding to Rap1 independently of its Ras-binding domain.

https://openalex.org/W2564692358,"Background Approximately 40% of patients diagnosed with stroke experience some degree of aphasia. With limited health care resources, patients’ access to speech and language therapies is often delayed. We propose using mobile-platform technology to initiate early speech-language therapy in the acute care setting. For this pilot, our objective was to assess the feasibility of a tablet-based speech-language therapy for patients with communication deficits following acute stroke. Methods We enrolled consecutive patients admitted with a stroke and communication deficits with NIHSS score ≥1 on the best language and/or dysarthria parameters. We excluded patients with severe comprehension deficits where communication was not possible. Following baseline assessment by a speech-language pathologist (SLP), patients were provided with a mobile tablet programmed with individualized therapy applications based on the assessment, and instructed to use it for at least one hour per day. Our objective was to establish feasibility by measuring recruitment rate, adherence rate, retention rate, protocol deviations and acceptability. Results Over 6 months, 143 patients were admitted with a new diagnosis of stroke: 73 had communication deficits, 44 met inclusion criteria, and 30 were enrolled into RecoverNow (median age 62, 26.6% female) for a recruitment rate of 68% of eligible participants. Participants received mobile tablets at a mean 6.8 days from admission [SEM 1.6], and used them for a mean 149.8 minutes/day [SEM 19.1]. In-hospital retention rate was 97%, and 96% of patients scored the mobile tablet-based communication therapy as at least moderately convenient 3/5 or better with 5/5 being most “convenient”. Conclusions Individualized speech-language therapy delivered by mobile tablet technology is feasible in acute care."
https://openalex.org/W2565634983,"In the last years, nanostructured biomaterials have raised a great interest as platforms for delivery of drugs, genes, imaging agents and for tissue engineering applications. In particular, hydrogel nanoparticles (HNP) associate the distinctive features of hydrogels (high water uptake capacity, biocompatibility) with the advantages of being possible to tailor its physicochemical properties at nano-scale to increase solubility, immunocompatibility and cellular uptake. In order to be safe, HNP for biomedical applications, such as injectable or ophthalmic formulations, must be sterile. Literature is very scarce with respect to sterilization effects on nanostructured systems, and even more in what concerns HNP. This work aims to evaluate the effect and effectiveness of different sterilization methods on chitosan (CS) hydrogel nanoparticles. In addition to conventional methods (steam autoclave and gamma irradiation), a recent ozone-based method of sterilization was also tested. A model chitosan-tripolyphosphate (TPP) hydrogel nanoparticles (CS-HNP), with a broad spectrum of possible applications was produced and sterilized in the absence and in the presence of protective sugars (glucose and mannitol). Properties like size, zeta potential, absorbance, morphology, chemical structure and cytotoxicity were evaluated. It was found that the CS-HNP degrade by autoclaving and that sugars have no protective effect. Concerning gamma irradiation, the formation of agglomerates was observed, compromising the suspension stability. However, the nanoparticles resistance increases considerably in the presence of the sugars. Ozone sterilization did not lead to significant physical adverse effects, however, slight toxicity signs were observed, contrarily to gamma irradiation where no detectable changes on cells were found. Ozonation in the presence of sugars avoided cytotoxicity. Nevertheless, some chemical alterations were observed in the nanoparticles."

Aberrant TG2 activity is thought to play a role in celiac disease, suggesting that a better understanding of TG2 regulation could help to elucidate the mechanistic basis of this malady. Structural and biochemical analysis has led to the hypothesis that extracellular TG2 activation involves reduction of an allosteric disulfide bond by thioredoxin-1 (TRX), but cellular and in vivo evidence for this proposal is lacking. To test the physiological relevance of this hypothesis, we first showed that macrophages exposed to pro-inflammatory stimuli released TRX in sufficient quantities to activate their extracellular pools of TG2. By using the C35S mutant of TRX, which formed a metastable mixed disulfide bond with TG2, we demonstrated that these proteins specifically recognized each other in the extracellular matrix of fibroblasts. When injected into mice and visualized with antibodies, we observed the C35S TRX mutant bound to endogenous TG2 as its principal protein partner in the small intestine. Control experiments showed no labeling of TG2 knock-out mice. Intravenous administration of recombinant TRX in wild-type mice, but not TG2 knock-out mice, led to a rapid rise in intestinal transglutaminase activity in a manner that could be inhibited by small molecules targeting TG2 or TRX.

https://openalex.org/W2567878884,"Recovery of large carnivores remains a challenge because complex spatial dynamics that facilitate population persistence are poorly understood. In particular, recovery of the critically endangered red wolf (Canis rufus) has been challenging because of its vulnerability to extinction via human-caused mortality and hybridization with coyotes (Canis latrans). Therefore, understanding red wolf space use and habitat selection is important to assist recovery because key aspects of wolf ecology such as interspecific competition, foraging, and habitat selection are well-known to influence population dynamics and persistence. During 2009-2011, we used global positioning system (GPS) radio-telemetry to quantify space use and 3rd-order habitat selection for resident and transient red wolves on the Albemarle Peninsula of eastern North Carolina. The Albemarle Peninsula was a predominantly agricultural landscape in which red wolves maintained spatially stable home ranges that varied between 25 km2 and 190 km2. Conversely, transient red wolves did not maintain home ranges and traversed areas between 122 km2 and 681 km2. Space use by transient red wolves was not spatially stable and exhibited shifting patterns until residency was achieved by individual wolves. Habitat selection was similar between resident and transient red wolves in which agricultural habitats were selected over forested habitats. However, transients showed stronger selection for edges and roads than resident red wolves. Behaviors of transient wolves are rarely reported in studies of space use and habitat selection because of technological limitations to observed extensive space use and because they do not contribute reproductively to populations. Transients in our study comprised displaced red wolves and younger dispersers that competed for limited space and mating opportunities. Therefore, our results suggest that transiency is likely an important life-history strategy for red wolves that facilitates metapopulation dynamics through short- and long-distance movements and eventual replacement of breeding residents lost to mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2568105191,"The objective of this study was to identify the clinical characteristics of Clostridium difficile infections (CDIs) caused by toxin A-negative/toxin B-positive (A-B+) PCR ribotype 017 (R017) and A+B+ ribotype 018 (R018) strains, prevalent in Asian countries. From February 2010 through January 2013, all CDI patients in our hospital were enrolled; their medical records were retrospectively reviewed, and the isolates were characterized by toxigenic culture and PCR ribotyping. Based on the ribotypes, a total of 510 cases were categorized as R017 (139, 27.3%), R018 (157, 30.8%) and other ribotypes groups (214, 42.0%), and clinical variables were compared between R017 and other ribotypes, R018 and other ribotypes and R018 and R017 groups. The patients with R017 infections had a higher mean Charlson's comorbidity index (OR 1.1, 1-1.21, p = 0.05), lower serum albumin (OR 0.47, 0.31-0.73, p = 0.001) and lower CRP levels (OR 0.96, 0.92-0.99, p = 0.022) than those with other ribotypes. R018 infections caused more azotemia (OR 4.06, 1.28-12.91, p = 0.018) and more frequent severe CDI (OR 1.87, 1.12-3.13, p = 0.016) than the other ribotypes infections. R017 and R018 infections were more often associated with toxin positive stools (OR 2.94, 1.65-4.09, p<0.001; OR 4.55, 2.82-7.33, p<0.001). In terms of treatment outcomes, R017 infections caused a marginally higher 30-day mortality than other ribotypes infection. In a final multiple logistic regression model, 30-day mortality was associated with leukocytosis (OR 2.45, 1.0-6.01, p = 0.05) and hypoalbuminemia (OR 4.57, 1.83-11.39, p = 0.001), but only marginally with R017 infection (OR 2.14, 0.88-5.22, p = 0.094). In conclusion, infections by C. difficile R018 strains tend to cause more severe disease, while there was a trend for higher mortality with R017 infections."
https://openalex.org/W2564588200,"Recent genome-wide studies found that patients with hypotonia, developmental delay, intellectual disability, congenital anomalies, characteristic facial dysmorphic features, and low cholesterol levels suffer from Kaufman oculocerebrofacial syndrome (KOS, also reported as blepharophimosis-ptosis-intellectual disability syndrome). The primary cause of KOS is autosomal recessive mutations in the gene UBE3B. However, to date, there are no studies that have determined the cellular or enzymatic function of UBE3B. Here, we report that UBE3B is a mitochondrion-associated protein with homologous to the E6-AP C terminus (HECT) E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Mutating the catalytic cysteine (C1036A) or deleting the entire HECT domain (amino acids 758–1068) results in loss of UBE3B's ubiquitylation activity. Knockdown of UBE3B in human cells induces changes in mitochondrial morphology and physiology, a decrease in mitochondrial volume, and a severe suppression of cellular proliferation. We also discovered that UBE3B interacts with calmodulin via its N-terminal isoleucine-glutamine (IQ) motif. Deletion of the IQ motif (amino acids 29–58) results in loss of calmodulin binding and a significant increase in the in vitro ubiquitylation activity of UBE3B. In addition, we found that changes in calcium levels in vitro disrupt the calmodulin-UBE3B interaction. These studies demonstrate that UBE3B is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and reveal that the enzyme is regulated by calmodulin. Furthermore, the modulation of UBE3B via calmodulin and calcium implicates a role for calcium signaling in mitochondrial protein ubiquitylation, protein turnover, and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2568783480,"Lake metabolism is a key factor for the understanding of turnover of energy and of organic and inorganic matter in lake ecosystems. Long-term time series on metabolic rates are commonly estimated from diel changes in dissolved oxygen. Here we present long-term data on metabolic rates based on diel changes in total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) utilizing an open-water diel CO2-technique. Metabolic rates estimated with this technique and the traditional diel O2-technique agree well in alkaline Lake Illmensee (pH of ~8.5), although the diel changes in molar CO2 concentrations are much smaller than those of the molar O2 concentrations. The open-water diel CO2- and diel O2-techniques provide independent measures of lake metabolic rates that differ in their sensitivity to transport processes. Hence, the combination of both techniques can help to constrain uncertainties arising from assumptions on vertical fluxes due to gas exchange and turbulent diffusion. This is particularly important for estimates of lake respiration rates because these are much more sensitive to assumptions on gradients in vertical fluxes of O2 or DIC than estimates of lake gross primary production. Our data suggest that it can be advantageous to estimate respiration rates assuming negligible gradients in vertical fluxes rather than including gas exchange with the atmosphere but neglecting vertical mixing in the water column. During two months in summer the average lake net production was close to zero suggesting at most slightly autotrophic conditions. However, the lake emitted O2 and CO2 during the entire time period suggesting that O2 and CO2 emissions from lakes can be decoupled from the metabolism in the near surface layer."
https://openalex.org/W2571198680,"Modulating key dynamics of plant growth and development, the effects of the plant hormone cytokinin on animal cells gained much attention recently. Most previous studies on cytokinin effects on mammalian cells have been conducted with elevated cytokinin concentration (in the μM range). However, to examine physiologically relevant dose effects of cytokinins on animal cells, we systematically analyzed the impact of kinetin in cultured cells at low and high concentrations (1nM-10μM) and examined cytotoxic and genotoxic conditions. We furthermore measured the intrinsic antioxidant activity of kinetin in a cell-free system using the Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power assay and in cells using the dihydroethidium staining method. Monitoring viability, we looked at kinetin effects in mammalian cells such as HL60 cells, HaCaT human keratinocyte cells, NRK rat epithelial kidney cells and human peripheral lymphocytes. Kinetin manifests no antioxidant activity in the cell free system and high doses of kinetin (500 nM and higher) reduce cell viability and mediate DNA damage in vitro. In contrast, low doses (concentrations up to 100 nM) of kinetin confer protection in cells against oxidative stress. Moreover, our results show that pretreatment of the cells with kinetin significantly reduces 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide mediated reactive oxygen species production. Also, pretreatment with kinetin retains cellular GSH levels when they are also treated with the GSH-depleting agent patulin. Our results explicitly show that low kinetin doses reduce apoptosis and protect cells from oxidative stress mediated cell death. Future studies on the interaction between cytokinins and human cellular pathway targets will be intriguing."
https://openalex.org/W2562470456,"The adhesion molecule CD99 is essential for the transendothelial migration of leukocytes. In this study, we used biochemical and cellular assays to show that CD99 undergoes ectodomain shedding by the metalloprotease meprin β and subsequent intramembrane proteolysis by γ-secretase. The cleavage site in CD99 was identified by mass spectrometry within an acidic region highly conserved through different vertebrate species. This finding fits perfectly to the unique cleavage specificity of meprin β with a strong preference for aspartate residues and suggests coevolution of protease and substrate. We hypothesized that limited CD99 cleavage by meprin β would alter cellular transendothelial migration (TEM) behavior in tissue remodeling processes, such as inflammation and cancer. Indeed, meprin β induced cell migration of Lewis lung carcinoma cells in an in vitro TEM assay. Accordingly, deficiency of meprin β in Mep1b−/− mice resulted in significantly increased CD99 protein levels in the lung. Therefore, meprin β could serve as a therapeutic target, given that in a proof-of-concept approach we showed accumulation of CD99 protein in lungs of meprin β inhibitor-treated mice.—Bedau, T., Peters, F., Prox, J., Arnold, P., Schmidt, F., Finkernagel, M., Köllmann, S., Wichert, R., Otte, A., Ohler, A., Stirnberg, M., Lucius, R., Koudelka, T., Tholey, A., Biasin, V., Pietrzik, C.

https://openalex.org/W2571325396,"Since the insulin-like growth factor 3 (igf3) gene was recently discovered in fish ovary, its function in the gonads has received much attention. In this study, we isolated two igf3 subtypes from common carp (Cyprinus carpio), which comprised full-length cDNA of 707 and 1153 nucleotides encoding 205 and 198 amino acids (aa), respectively. The Igf3 aa sequence had the highest gene homology of 72% with the corresponding sequence in zebrafish (Danio rerio). Phylogenetic tree construction revealed that the C. carpio igf3 gene was first clustered with D. rerio and then with other teleost species. Igf3 mRNA was widely expressed, with expression being highest in the gonads and blood. In the gonad development stage, igf3a mRNA expression was highest in the maturity and recession stage of the ovary, and decline phase of the testis, while igf3b was highest in the recession and fully mature periods of the ovaries and testes, respectively. Western blotting of testis protein samples showed two bands of approximately 21 kDa and 34 kDa corresponding to the calculated molecular mass of the two Igf3 subtypes; no signal was detected in the ovary. The Igf3 protein was localized in the ovary granulosa cells and testis spermatogonium and spermatids. 17β-Ethinylestradiol treatment increased both ovary and testis igf3 mRNA expression. These findings suggest that Igf3 may play an important role in C. carpio gonadal development."

SWVs were measured fifteen times for each child at a 4 cm depth for the right lobe using a 1-6 MHz convex transducer. Mean SWVs from three, five, and seven acquisitions were compared to the mean SWV from fifteen measurements, using an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) analyzed with the 1,000 times bootstrap method.Total eighty-eight children were included (25 children in group A, 30 children in group B, 21 children in group C, and 12 children in group D). The mean SWVs from fifteen measurements in FB status were 5.5 ± 1.3 kPa for groups A-C together and 8.0 ± 2.2 kPa for group D. For all groups together, mean SWVs from the three (ICC 0.944 and 0.937), five (ICC 0.958 and 0.938) and seven (ICC 0.969 and 0.941) acquisitions demonstrated almost perfect agreement with the reference of fifteen acquisitions in both FB and BH status, respectively. A subgroup analysis showed three measurements were in almost perfect agreement during FB for groups B-D and strong agreement (ICC 0.675) for group A.Three acquisitions can be enough for hepatic SWVs in children more than 6 years old regardless of breathing status or hepatic pathology. More acquisitions are recommended for children under the age of 5 years during FB."

In this study we use the 2013 National Health Interview Survey to examine the constellation of conditions referred to as musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) for Veterans and non-veterans with health conditions that limit their daily activities. Multivariate logistic regression analysis reveal that Veterans are more likely to report MSDs like neck and back problems, fracture bone and joint problems as an activity limiting problem compared to non-veterans. The relationship between age and reports of activity limiting MSDs is moderated by Veteran status. Veterans in this sample report more activity limiting MSDs at younger ages compared to non-veterans and fewer MSDs at older ages. This research contributes to our understanding of potentially limiting health conditions at earlier ages for Veterans."
https://openalex.org/W2562348661,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease of complex etiology. A characteristic feature of a subset of RA is the presence of anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA), which correlate with a progressive disease course. In this study, we employed streptavidin capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to analyze ACPA reactivity. Using the pro-filaggrin peptide HQCHQEST-Cit-GRSRGRCGRSGS, as template, we analyzed the reactivity of RA sera and healthy donor sera to various peptides in order to determine the physical characteristics of the citrullinated pro-filaggrin epitope and to examine whether biotin labelling influence antibody recognition. The full-length cyclic pro-filaggrin peptide and a linear form with a N-terminal biotin, was recognized to the same level, whereas, a notable difference in ACPA reactivity to the linear peptides with a C-terminal biotin was found, probably due to steric hindrance. Screening of linear and cyclic truncated peptides, revealed that small cyclic peptides containing 10-12 amino acids are favored over the linear. Moreover, the charged amino acids C-terminal to citrulline were found to be essential for antibody reactivity, most important was the charged amino acid in position 4 C-terminal to citrulline. Collectively, peptide structure, length, the presence of charged amino acids and biotin labelling markedly influence antibody reactivity. In relation to the clinical diagnostics of ACPA, these findings may reflect the differences in diagnostic assays used for detection of ACPA, which relates to differences in sensitivity and specificity dependent on the assay applied."
https://openalex.org/W2569670857,"Objectives This study aimed to explore the service needs and preferences of frequent emergency department users with mental health and addictions concerns who participated in a brief intensive case management intervention. Methods We conducted semi-structured individual interviews with 20 frequent emergency department users with mental health and addictions challenges, 13 service providers involved in the delivery of a brief case management intervention, and a focus group with intervention case managers. Thematic analysis was used to explore perceived service user profiles, service needs and preferences of care. Results Service users experienced complex health and social needs and social isolation, while exhibiting resilience and the desire to contribute. They described multiple instances of stigmatization in interactions with healthcare professionals. Components of the brief intensive case management intervention perceived to be helpful included system navigation, advocacy, intermediation, and practical needs assistance. Frequent service users valued relational responsiveness, a non-judgmental stance, and a recovery orientation in case managers. Conclusion Interventions for frequent service users in mental health may be enhanced by focusing on the engagement of formal and informal social supports, practical needs assistance, system navigation, advocacy and intermediation, and attention to the recovery goals of service users."
https://openalex.org/W2567391952,"ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10) is the α-secretase that is involved in APP (β-amyloid precursor protein) processing. Enhancement of the nonamyloidogenic APP pathway by ADAM10 provides therapeutic potential for Alzheimer's disease (AD). By using high-throughput screening that targeted ADAM10, we determined that apicidin-an inhibitor of HDACs (histone deacetylases)-significantly increased mRNA and protein levels of ADAM10 in SH-SY5Y cells. A luciferase assay revealed that the nucleotides -444 to -300 in the ADAM10 promoter were sufficient to mediate this effect. In addition, knockdown of USF1 (upstream transcription factor 1) and HDAC2/3 prevented apicidin regulation of ADAM10. Moreover, USF1 acetylation was increased by apicidin, which enhanced the association of USF1 with HDAC2/3 and with the ADAM10 promoter. We further found that apicidin did not affect the phosphorylation of ERK or USF1; however, ERK inhibitor U0126 blocked the effect of apicidin on ADAM10. Finally, apicidin increased the level of α-site C-terminal fragment from APP and reduced the production of β-amyloid peptide 1-42. Collectively, our study provides evidence that ADAM10 expression can be regulated by HDAC2/3 inhibitor apicidin via USF1-dependent mechanisms in which ERK signaling plays an important role. Thus, HDAC regulation of ADAM10 might shed new light on the understanding of AD pathology.-Hu, X.-T., Zhu, B.-L., Zhao, L.-G., Wang, J.-W., Liu, L., Lai, Y.-J., He, L., Deng, X.-J., Chen, G.-J.

We have reported that the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and guanylate kinase-like domain containing, isoform (LRGUK)-1 is essential for sperm head shaping, via the manchette, and the initiation of sperm tail growth from the centriole/basal body, and thus, male fertility. Within this study we have used a yeast 2-hybrid screen of an adult testis library to identify LRGUK1-binding partners, which were then validated with a range of techniques. The data indicate that LRGUK1 likely achieves its function in partnership with members of the HOOK family of proteins (HOOK-1–3), Rab3-interacting molecule binding protein (RIMBP)-3 and kinesin light chain (KLC)-3, all of which are associated with intracellular protein transport as cargo adaptor proteins and are localized to the manchette. LRGUK1 consists of 3 domains; an LRR, a guanylate kinase (GUK)-like and an unnamed domain. In the present study, we showed that the GUK-like domain is essential for binding to HOOK2 and RIMBP3, and the LRR domain is essential for binding to KLC3. These findings establish LRGUK1 as a key component of a multiprotein complex with an essential role in microtubule dynamics within haploid male germ cells.—Okuda, H., DeBoer, K., O'Connor, A.

Insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) signal through the scaffold protein insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1). In diabetes, IRS-1 is down-regulated, and cells become resistant to insulin. Under these conditions, the IGF-I receptor signals through an alternate scaffold protein, SHPS-1, resulting in pathophysiologic stimulation of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) migration and proliferation. These studies were undertaken to determine whether IRS-1 is functioning constitutively to maintain VSMCs in their differentiated state and, thereby, inhibit aberrant signaling. Here we show that deletion of IRS-1 expression in VSMCs in non-diabetic mice results in dedifferentiation, SHPS-1 activation, and aberrant signaling and that these changes parallel those that occur in response to hyperglycemia. The mice showed enhanced sensitivity to IGF-I stimulation of VSMC proliferation and a hyperproliferative response to vascular injury. KLF4, a transcription factor that induces VSMC dedifferentiation, was up-regulated in IRS-1−/− mice, and the differentiation inducer myocardin was undetectable. Importantly, these changes were replicated in wild-type mice during hyperglycemia. These findings illuminate a new function of IRS-1: that of maintaining cells in their normal, differentiated state.

https://openalex.org/W2565071135,"Background Millions of women have been vaccinated with one of two first-generation human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines. Both vaccines remain in use and target two oncogenic types (HPVs 16 and 18); however, if these types naturally compete with others that are not targeted, type replacement may occur following reductions in the circulating prevalence of targeted types. To explore the potential for type replacement, we evaluated natural HPV type competition in unvaccinated females. Methods Valid HPV DNA typing information was available from five epidemiological studies conducted in Canada and Brazil (n = 14,685; enrollment across studies took place between1993 and 2010), which used similar consensus-primer PCR assays, capable of detecting up to 40 HPV types. A total of 38,088 cervicovaginal specimens were available for inclusion in our analyses evaluating HPV type-type interactions involving vaccine-targeted types (6, 11, 16, and 18), and infection with each of the other HPV types. Results Across the studies, the average age of participants ranged from 21.0 to 43.7 years. HPV16 was the most common type (prevalence range: 1.0% to 13.8%), and in general HPV types were more likely to be detected as part of a multiple infection than as single infections. In our analyses focusing on each of the vaccine-targeted HPV types separately, many significant positive associations were observed (particularly involving HPV16); however, we did not observe any statistically significant negative associations. Conclusions Our findings suggest that natural HPV type competition does not exist, and that type replacement is unlikely to occur in vaccinated populations."

https://openalex.org/W2569457773,"Lung cancer, primarily non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States and worldwide. While early detection significantly improves five-year survival, there are no reliable diagnostic tools for early detection. Several exosomal microRNAs (miRs) are overexpressed in NSCLC, and have been suggested as potential biomarkers for early detection. The present paper develops a mathematical model for early stage of NSCLC with emphasis on the role of the three highest overexpressed miRs, namely miR-21, miR-205 and miR-155. Simulations of the model provide quantitative relationships between the tumor volume and the total mass of each of the above miRs in the tumor. Because of the positive correlation between these miRs in the tumor tissue and in the blood, the results of the paper may be viewed as a first step toward establishing a combination of miRs 21, 205, 155 and possibly other miRs as serum biomarkers for early detection of NSCLC."

The enzyme was stimulated by its product, glucose; consequently, the Bg10 activity against 50 and 100 mM of glucose were increased by 36.8% and 22%, respectively, while half of the activity was retained at 350 mM. Moreover, the Bg10 was able to hydrolyse 55% (milk sample) and 100% (purified sugar) of the lactose at low (6°C) and optimum (37°C) temperatures, respectively, suggesting the possibility of further optimization of the reaction for lactose-free dairy production. In addition, the enzyme was able to fully hydrolyse 40 mM of cellobiose at one hour and was tolerant to ethanol up to concentrations of 500 mM (86% of activity), while a 1 M concentration still resulted in 41% residual activity, which could be interesting for biofuel production."

Tree height-diameter dynamics was examined with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck family mixed effects SDEs. Dynamics of a tree height, volume and their coefficients of variation, quantile regression curves of the tree height, and height-diameter ratio were demonstrated using newly developed tree height distributions for a given diameter. The parameters were estimated by considering a discrete sample of the diameter and height and by using an approximated maximum likelihood procedure. All models were evaluated using a validation dataset. The dataset provided by the LNFI (2006–2010) of Scots pine trees is used in this study to estimate parameters and validate our modeling technique. The verification indicated that the newly developed models are able to accurately capture the behavior of tree height distribution corresponding to a given diameter.

https://openalex.org/W2564125808,"ADP-ribosylation factor GTPases are activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors including Gbf1 (Golgi brefeldin A-resistant factor 1) and play important roles in regulating organelle structure and cargo-selective vesicle trafficking. However, the developmental role of Gbf1 in vertebrates remains elusive. In this study, we report the zebrafish mutant line tsu3994 that arises from N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-mediated mutagenesis and is characterized by prominent intracerebral and trunk hemorrhage. The mutant embryos develop hemorrhage accompanied by fewer pigments and shorter caudal fin at day 2 of development. The hemorrhage phenotype is caused by vascular breakage in a cell autonomous fashion. Positional cloning identifies a T → G nucleotide substitution in the 23rd exon of the gbf1 locus, resulting in a leucine → arginine substitution (L1246R) in the HDS2 domain. The mutant phenotype is mimicked by gbf1 knockouts and morphants, suggesting a nature of loss of function. Experimental results in mammalian cells show that the mutant form Gbf1(L1246R) is unable to be recruited to the Golgi apparatus and fails to activate Arf1 for recruiting COPI complex. The hemorrhage in tsu3994 mutants can be prevented partially and temporally by treating with the endoplasmic reticulum stress/apoptosis inhibitor tauroursodeoxycholic acid or by knocking down the proapoptotic gene baxb. Therefore, endothelial endoplasmic reticulum stress and subsequent apoptosis induced by gbf1 deficiency may account for the vascular collapse and hemorrhage."

https://openalex.org/W2570217080,"Historically, it has been difficult to balance conservation goals and yield objectives when managing multispecies fisheries that include stocks with various vulnerabilities to fishing. As managers try to maximize yield in mixed-stock fisheries, exploitation rates can lead to less productive stocks becoming overfished. In the late 1990s, population declines of several U.S. West Coast groundfish species caused the U.S. Pacific Fishery Management Council to create coast-wide fishery closures, known as Rockfish Conservation Areas, to rebuild overfished species. The fishery closures and other management measures successfully reduced fishing mortality of these species, but constrained fishing opportunities on abundant stocks. Restrictive regulations also caused the unintended consequence of reducing fishery-dependent data available to assess population status of fished species. As stocks rebuild, managers are faced with the challenge of increasing fishing opportunities while minimizing fishing mortality on rebuilding species. We designed a camera system to evaluate fishes in coastal habitats and used experimental gear and fishing techniques paired with video surveys to determine if abundant species could be caught in rocky habitats with minimal catches of co-occurring rebuilding species. We fished a total of 58 days and completed 741 sets with vertical hook-and-line fishing gear. We also conducted 299 video surveys in the same locations where fishing occurred. Comparison of fishing and stereo-video surveys indicated that fishermen could fish with modified hook-and-line gear to catch abundant species while limiting bycatch of rebuilding species. As populations of overfished species continue to recover along the U.S. West Coast, it is important to improve data collection, and video and fishing surveys may be key to assessing species that occur in rocky habitats."
https://openalex.org/W2563425316,"Introduction Returning veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan experience high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and suicidal behavior. Suicidal ideation is among the strongest risk factors for completed suicide. Some research suggests an association between PTSD and suicidal ideation, and that health-promoting behaviors—behaviors that sustain or increase well-being—play a role in this association. The current study examined whether health-promoting behaviors moderate the association between PTSD severity and suicidal ideation. Methods Veterans of Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF; N = 108) completed measures of PTSD symptoms, trauma exposure, suicidal ideation, and health-promoting behaviors. Results Moderated regression was used to test the hypothesis. Results indicated that health promoting behaviors, β = -.06, p = .001, and PTSD symptoms, β = .36, p < .001, were significantly related to suicidal ideation. Consistent with our main hypothesis, the health promoting behaviors x PTSD interaction term was significantly associated with suicidal ideation, β = -.09, p = .001. The overall model accounted for 13% of the variance in suicidal ideation. Among individuals with high PTSD symptom severity, those who engaged in more health promoting behaviors reported less suicidal ideation than those who engaged in fewer health promoting behaviors. Conclusions Health-promoting behaviors could be important for reducing suicidal ideation among veterans with high levels of PTSD symptoms. It is recommended that future research examine health promotion interventions as a means of reducing suicidal ideation."
https://openalex.org/W2570307402,"The neural crest (NC) is a stem cell-like embryonic population that is essential for generating and patterning the vertebrate body, including the craniofacial skeleton and peripheral nervous system. Defects in NC development underlie many birth defects and contribute to formation of some of the most malignant cancers in humans, such as melanoma and neuroblastoma. For these reasons, significant research efforts have been expended to identify genes that control NC development, as it is expected to lead to a deeper understanding of the genetic mechanisms controlling vertebrate development and identify new treatments for NC-derived diseases and cancers. However, a number of inconsistencies regarding gene function during NC development have emerged from comparative analyses of gene function between mammalian and non-mammalian systems (chick, frog, zebrafish). This poses a significant barrier to identification of single genes and/or redundant pathways to target in NC diseases. Here, we determine whether technical differences, namely morpholino-based approaches used in non-mammalian systems, could contribute to these discrepancies, by examining the extent to which NC phenotypes in fascin1a (fscn1a) morphant embryos are similar to or different from fscn1a null mutants in zebrafish. Analysis of fscn1a morphants showed that they mimicked early NC phenotypes observed in fscn1a null mutants; however, these embryos also displayed NC migration and derivative phenotypes not observed in null mutants, including accumulation of p53-independent cell death. These data demonstrate that morpholinos can cause seemingly specific NC migration and derivative phenotypes, and thus have likely contributed to the inconsistencies surrounding NC gene function between species. We suggest that comparison of genetic mutants between different species is the most rigorous method for identifying conserved genetic mechanisms controlling NC development and is critical to identify new treatments for NC diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2562788847,"Objective There is little information on the type of early care provided to children with traumatic brain injury (TBI) in low middle income countries. We benchmarked early prehospital [PH] and emergency department [ED] pediatric TBI care in Argentina. Methods We conducted a secondary analysis of data from patients previously enrolled in a prospective seven center study of children with TBI. Eligible participants were patients 0–18 years, and had diagnosis of TBI (admission Glasgow Coma scale score [GCS] < 13 or with GCS 14–15 and abnormal head CT scan within 48 hours of admission, and head AIS > 0). Outcomes were transport type, transport time, PH and ED adherence to best practice, and discharge Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category Scale (PCPC) and Pediatric Overall Performance category Scale (POPC). Results Of the 366 children, mean age was 8.7 (5.0) years, 58% were male, 90% had isolated TBI and 45.4% were transported by private vehicle. 50 (34.7%) of the 144 children with severe TBI (39.3% of all TBI patients) were transported by private vehicle. Most (267; 73%) patients received initial TBI care at an index hospital prior to study center admission, including children with severe (81.9%) TBI. Transport times were shorter for those patients who were directly transported by ambulance to study center than for the whole cohort (1.4 vs.5.5 hours). Ambulance blood pressure data were recorded in 30.9%. ED guideline adherence rate was higher than PH guideline adherence rate (84.8% vs. 26.4%). For patients directly transferred from scene to study trauma centers, longer transport time was associated with worse discharge outcome (PCPC aOR 1.10 [1.04, 1.18] and (POPC aOR 1.10 [1.04, 1.18]). There was no relationship between PH or ED TBI guideline adherence rate and discharge POPC and PCPC. Conclusion This study benchmarks early pediatric TBI care in Argentina and shows that many critically injured children with TBI do not receive timely or best practice PH care, that PH guideline adherence rate is low and that longer transport time was associated with poor discharge outcomes for patients with direct transfer status. There is an urgent need to improve the early care of children with TBI in Argentina, especially timely transportation to a hospital."

In this study, the catalytic mechanism of this rare type of decarboxylase is re-investigated by structural and mutagenic studies on the enzyme from a thermoacidophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus. The crystal structures of the archaeal enzyme in complex with (R)-5-diphosphomevalonate and adenosine 5′-O-(3-thio)triphosphate or with (R)-5-diphosphomevalonate and ADP are newly solved, and theoretical analysis based on the structure suggests the inability of proton abstraction by the conserved aspartate residue, Asp-281. Site-directed mutagenesis on Asp-281 creates mutants that only show diphosphomevalonate 3-kinase activity, demonstrating that the residue is required in the process of phosphate elimination/decarboxylation, rather than in the preceding phosphorylation step. These results enable discussion of the catalytic roles of the aspartate residue and provide clear proof of the involvement of a long predicted intermediate, (R)-3-phospho-5-diphosphomevalonate, in the reaction of the enzyme.

https://openalex.org/W2568609539,"Background Nutrition in the school-aged child matters for brain development and public policy investments globally. Our group previously conducted a trial in urban schools of Haiti to examine the effects of a fortified peanut butter snack, Vita Mamba, with limited findings for anemia. Objective We aimed to test the hypothesis that Vita Mamba, with systematic deworming in both study arms, would significantly reduce anemia among rural, school-aged children. Methods A cluster, randomized longitudinal study was conducted in two rural communities of the North-East Department of Haiti, 2014–2015. Healthy children ages 3–16 years were enrolled (n = 321) and assigned by school to intervention (Vita Mamba and deworming) and control (deworming). Vita Mamba contains 260 kcal and meets >75% of the Recommended Dietary Allowance for critical micronutrients. Multivariate regression analyses including propensity score matching techniques to correct for potential group imbalance (Kernel-based Matching and Propensity Score Weighting) were applied to examine difference-in-difference intervention effects. Results At baseline, 51% of the children were anemic with no significant differences between study groups. Vita Mamba supplementation showed a consistent, positive effect across regression models on increasing Hb concentration and reducing the odds of anemia compared to the control group after adjusting for child age, vitamin A supplementation, milk consumption, and height-for-age z score. The average treatment effect for the treated in the Propensity Score Weighting models was 0.62±0.27 grams per 100 milliliters (g/dL) for Hb concentration (F = 4.64, P = 0.001), and the odds of anemia were reduced by 88% (Wald χ² = 9.77, P = 0.02). No differences in change in anthropometric markers were evident. Conclusions School feeding programs that integrate fortified foods with deworming could reduce anemia burden with important implications for learning, health, and well-being. The rural-urban differences in anemia require further study."
https://openalex.org/W2564711023,"HER2-positive breast cancer (BC) is a heterogeneous group of aggressive breast cancers, the prognosis of which has greatly improved since the introduction of treatments targeting HER2. However, these tumors may display intrinsic or acquired resistance to treatment, and classifiers of HER2-positive tumors are required to improve the prediction of prognosis and to develop novel therapeutic interventions.We analyzed 2893 primary human breast cancer samples from 21 publicly available datasets and developed a six-metagene signature on a training set of 448 HER2-positive BC. We then used external public datasets to assess the ability of these metagenes to predict the response to chemotherapy (Ignatiadis dataset), and prognosis (METABRIC dataset).We identified a six-metagene signature (138 genes) containing metagenes enriched in different gene ontologies. The gene clusters were named as follows: Immunity, Tumor suppressors/proliferation, Interferon, Signal transduction, Hormone/survival and Matrix clusters. In all datasets, the Immunity metagene was less strongly expressed in ER-positive than in ER-negative tumors, and was inversely correlated with the Hormonal/survival metagene. Within the signature, multivariate analyses showed that strong expression of the ""Immunity"" metagene was associated with higher pCR rates after NAC (OR = 3.71[1.28-11.91], p = 0.019) than weak expression, and with a better prognosis in HER2-positive/ER-negative breast cancers (HR = 0.58 [0.36-0.94], p = 0.026). Immunity metagene expression was associated with the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs).The identification of a predictive and prognostic immune module in HER2-positive BC confirms the need for clinical testing for immune checkpoint modulators and vaccines for this specific subtype. The inverse correlation between Immunity and hormone pathways opens research perspectives and deserves further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2565549923,"In recent years, Apolygus lucorum has caused increasing damage to cotton and fruit trees in China. The salivary enzymes secreted by A. lucorum when sucking on host plants induce a series of biochemical reactions in plants, and the pre-oral digestion benefits the bug feeding. In this study, the food intake of A. lucorum from 1st instar nymphs to adults was measured, and the corresponding salivary activity of pectinase, amylase, cellulase, protease, polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase was determined. Daily food intake varied with developmental stage, peaking in 3rd and 4th instar nymphs. Pectinase, amylase, cellulase and protease were detected in both nymphal and adult saliva of A. lucorum, while neither polyphenol oxidase nor peroxidase was detected. Protease activity varied with food intake peaking at the 3rd-4th instar, and then slightly decreasing at the 5th instar. Levels of pectinase, amylase and cellulase increased significantly with the daily feeding level until the 3rd instar, corresponding with increasing damage to host plants. The activity of both cellulase and protease had a significant linear relationship with the average daily food intake. The increasing activity of enzymes in saliva explain stage-specific impacts of A. lucorum on the host plants, and suggest that optimal management of A. lucorum would be confined to its control threshold prior to the peak of daily feeding in the 3rd instar."
https://openalex.org/W2570235013,"Objectives 
To examine the relationship between key functional impairments, co-morbid conditions and driving performance in a sample of cognitively normal older adults.


Design 
Prospective observational study


Setting 
The Knight Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center, Washington University at St. Louis


Participants 
Individuals with normal cognition, 64.9 to 88.2 years old (N = 129), with a valid driver’s license, who were currently driving at least once per week, and who had participated in longitudinal studies at the Knight Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center


Measurements 
Static visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, physical frailty measures, motor skills, total medical conditions, and the modified Washington University Road Test.


Results 
When controlling for age, race, gender, APOE, and education the total number of medical conditions was unassociated with both road test scores (pass vs. marginal + fail) and the total driver error count. There were marginal associations of our measure of physical frailty (p = 0.06) and contrast sensitivity score (p = 0.06) with total driving error count.


Conclusion 
Future research that focuses on older adults and driving should consider adopting measures of physical frailty and contrast sensitivity, especially in samples that may have a propensity for disease impacting visual and/or physical function (e.g. osteoarthritis, Parkinson’s, eye disorders, advanced age >80 years, etc.)."

However, the role of STIM1 in insulin-secreting β-cells is unresolved. We report that lowering expression of STIM1, the gene that encodes STIM1, in insulin-secreting MIN6 β-cells with RNA interference inhibits SOCE and ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channel activation. The effects of STIM1 knockdown were reversed by transduction of MIN6 cells with an adenovirus gene shuttle vector that expressed human STIM1. Immunoprecipitation studies revealed that STIM1 binds to nucleotide binding fold-1 (NBF1) of the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) subunit of the KATP channel. Binding of STIM1 to SUR1 was enhanced by poly-lysine. Our data indicate that SOCE and KATP channel activity are regulated by STIM1. This suggests that STIM1 is a multifunctional signaling effector that participates in the control of membrane excitability and Ca2+ signaling events in β-cells.

https://openalex.org/W2571022115,"We have developed a combinatory antibody–antigen microarray for direct screening of multiple single-chain fragment variable (scFv) clones with no need for pre-purification or enrichment before screening. The straightforward workflow allows for early selection of binders to predefined peptide and glycopeptide targets. A capture antibody is contact printed on microarray slides, side by side with the antigens of interest. A large number of scFv clones, in supernatants, are printed on top of the capture antibody and the antigen in a “spot-on-spot” print. The printed scFv clones, which bind to the capture antibody, are detected using biotinylated antigen, while the binding of scFv clones to the printed antigen is detected through a mouse anti-tag antibody. Two different analyses are thus performed on the same slide, generating two kinds of information: one on the ability of an individual scFv clone to bind to the soluble form of the antigen, which may favour selection for higher affinity rather than avidity, while the other allows the identification of large numbers of clones, simultaneously, due to the binding of scFv clones to densely presented antigens, thus providing an overall increased hit rate. The functionality of the new screening approach was illustrated through the generation of antibodies against peptides from the chaperone complex Ku70/Ku80 and the GalNAcα-serine/threonine epitope on the IgA1 alpha chain hinge region. In total, 659 scFv clones were screened with a hit rate of approximately 20%. This approach allowed the identification of functional antibodies in both cases, illustrating the usefulness and capacity of this combinatory microarray screening technique for efficient analysis and validation of antibodies at an early stage of antibody generation."
https://openalex.org/W2563456010,"Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a multidomain membrane protein that functions as a phosphorylation-regulated anion channel. The interface between its two cytosolic nucleotide binding domains and coupling helices conferred by intracellular loops extending from the channel pore domains has been referred to as a transmission interface and is thought to be critical for the regulated channel activity of CFTR. Phosphorylation of the regulatory domain of CFTR by protein kinase A (PKA) is required for its channel activity. However, it was unclear if phosphorylation modifies the transmission interface. Here, we studied purified full-length CFTR protein using spectroscopic techniques to determine the consequences of PKA-mediated phosphorylation. Synchrotron radiation circular dichroism spectroscopy confirmed that purified full-length wild-type CFTR is folded and structurally responsive to phosphorylation. Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence studies of CFTR showed that phosphorylation reduced iodide-mediated quenching, consistent with an effect of phosphorylation in burying tryptophans at the transmission interface. Importantly, the rate of phosphorylation-dependent channel activation was compromised by the introduction of disease-causing mutations in either of the two coupling helices predicted to interact with nucleotide binding domain 1 at the interface. Together, these results suggest that phosphorylation modifies the interface between the catalytic and pore domains of CFTR and that this modification facilitates CFTR channel activation."
https://openalex.org/W2568390610,"The surge in arterial pressure during arousal in the waking period is thought to be largely due to activation of the sympathetic nervous system. In this study we compared in SHR the effects of chronic administration of the centrally acting sympatholytic agent rilmenidine with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril on the rate of rise and power of the surge in mean arterial pressure (MAP) that occurs with arousal associated with the onset of night. Recordings were made using radiotelemetry in 17 adult SHR before and after treatment with rilmenidine (2mg/kg/day), perindopril (1mg/kg/day) or vehicle in the drinking water for 2 weeks. Rilmenidine reduced MAP by 7.2 ± 1.7mmHg while perindopril reduced MAP by 19 ± 3mmHg. Double logistic curve fit analysis showed that the rate and power of increase in systolic pressure during the transition from light to dark was reduced by 50% and 65%, respectively, but had no effect on diastolic pressure. Rilmenidine also reduced blood pressure variability in the autonomic frequency in the active period as assessed by spectral analysis which is consistent with reduction in sympathetic nervous system activity. Perindopril had no effect on the rate or power of the arousal surge in either systolic or diastolic pressure. These results suggest that the arousal induced surge in blood pressure can largely be reduced by an antihypertensive agent that inhibits the sympathetic nervous system and that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition, while effective in reducing blood pressure, does not alter the rate or power of the surge associated with arousal."
https://openalex.org/W2568134043,"Accurate diagnosis of fibrosis is of paramount clinical importance. A human fibrosis classifier based on metzincins and related genes (MARGS) was described previously. In this investigation, expression changes of MARGS genes were explored and evaluated to examine whether the MARGS-based algorithm has any diagnostic value in a rat model of lithium nephropathy. Male Wistar rats (n = 12) were divided into 2 groups (n = 6). One group was given a diet containing lithium (40 mmol/kg food for 7 days, followed by 60mmol/kg food for the rest of the experimental period), while a control group (n = 6) was fed a normal diet. After six months, animals were sacrificed and the renal cortex and medulla of both kidneys removed for analysis. Gene expression changes were analysed using 24 GeneChip® Affymetrix Rat Exon 1.0 ST arrays. Statistically relevant genes (p-value<0.05, fold change>1.5, t-test) were further examined. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2), CD44, and nephroblastoma overexpressed gene (NOV) were overexpressed in the medulla and cortex of lithium-fed rats compared to the control group. TGFβ2 was overrepresented in the cortex of lithium-fed animals 1.5-fold, and 1.3-fold in the medulla of the same animals. In Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), both the medulla and cortex of lithium-fed animals showed an enrichment of the MARGS, TGFβ network, and extracellular matrix (ECM) gene sets, while the cortex expression signature was enriched in additional fibrosis-related-genes and the medulla was also enriched in immune response pathways. Importantly, the MARGS-based fibrosis classifier was able to classify all samples correctly. Immunohistochemistry and qPCR confirmed the up-regulation of NOV, CD44, and TGFβ2. The MARGS classifier represents a cross-organ and cross-species classifier of fibrotic conditions and may help to design a test to diagnose and to monitor fibrosis. The results also provide evidence for a common pathway in the pathogenesis of fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2571462886,"Purpose To find differential CT features of colorectal schwannomas from gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). Materials and Methods CT features of 13 pathologically proven colorectal schwannomas and 21 GISTs were retrospectively reviewed. The following CT items were analyzed: size, longitudinal and transverse location, shape, margin, homogeneity, necrosis, surface ulceration, calcification, degree of attenuation, the presence of enlarged lymph node (LN), and metastasis. Among the features, significant variables were evaluated using univariate statistical tests. The optimal cut-off point of tumor size was obtained by ROC analysis. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to find the most independent CT variables. Results Small size, non-rectum location, smooth margin, homogeneous high attenuation without necrosis, and the presence of enlarged LNs were found to be significant variables to differentiate schwannomas from GISTs (P<0.05). The optimized cut-off point for tumor size in distinguishing GISTs from schwannomas was 3.9 cm (AUC = 0.808, sensitivity = 66.7%, specificity = 92.3%, P<0.0001). Binary regression analysis revealed that only non-rectum location remained independent predictor for schwannomas differentiated from GISTs (odds ratio = 31.667, P = 0.001). Conclusion Colorectal schwannomas usually located in non-rectum and appear as small subepithelial nodules showing homogeneous high attenuation and smooth margin. Schwannomas exclusively accompany with enlarged LNs."
https://openalex.org/W2571489055,"When analyzing pathogen transcriptomes during the infection of host cells, the signal-to-background (pathogen-to-host) ratio of nucleic acids (NA) in infected samples is very small. Despite the advancements in next-generation sequencing, the minute amount of pathogen NA makes standard RNA-seq library preps inadequate for effective gene-level analysis of the pathogen in cases with low bacterial loads. In order to provide a more complete picture of the pathogen transcriptome during an infection, we developed a novel pathogen enrichment technique, which can enrich for transcripts from any cultivable bacteria or virus, using common, readily available laboratory equipment and reagents. To evenly enrich for pathogen transcripts, we generate biotinylated pathogen-targeted capture probes in an enzymatic process using the entire genome of the pathogen as a template. The capture probes are hybridized to a strand-specific cDNA library generated from an RNA sample. The biotinylated probes are captured on a monomeric avidin resin in a miniature spin column, and enriched pathogen-specific cDNA is eluted following a series of washes. To test this method, we performed an in vitro time-course infection using Klebsiella pneumoniae to infect murine macrophage cells. K. pneumoniae transcript enrichment efficiency was evaluated using RNA-seq. Bacterial transcripts were enriched up to ~400-fold, and allowed the recovery of transcripts from ~2000-3600 genes not observed in untreated control samples. These additional transcripts revealed interesting aspects of K. pneumoniae biology including the expression of putative virulence factors and the expression of several genes responsible for antibiotic resistance even in the absence of drugs."
