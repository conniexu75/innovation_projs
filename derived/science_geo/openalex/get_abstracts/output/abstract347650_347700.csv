https://openalex.org/W1964106002,"From the standpoints of both basic research and biotechnology, there is considerable interest in reaching a clearer understanding of the diversity of biological mechanisms employed during lignocellulose degradation. Globally, termites are an extremely successful group of wood-degrading organisms and are therefore important both for their roles in carbon turnover in the environment and as potential sources of biochemical catalysts for efforts aimed at converting wood into biofuels. Only recently have data supported any direct role for the symbiotic bacteria in the gut of the termite in cellulose and xylan hydrolysis. Here we use a metagenomic analysis of the bacterial community resident in the hindgut paunch of a wood-feeding 'higher' Nasutitermes species (which do not contain cellulose-fermenting protozoa) to show the presence of a large, diverse set of bacterial genes for cellulose and xylan hydrolysis. Many of these genes were expressed in vivo or had cellulase activity in vitro, and further analyses implicate spirochete and fibrobacter species in gut lignocellulose degradation. New insights into other important symbiotic functions including H2 metabolism, CO2-reductive acetogenesis and N2 fixation are also provided by this first system-wide gene analysis of a microbial community specialized towards plant lignocellulose degradation. Our results underscore how complex even a 1-microl environment can be."

https://openalex.org/W2093127955,"High-temperature superconductivity in copper oxides occurs when the materials are chemically tuned to have a carrier concentration intermediate between their metallic state at high doping and their insulating state at zero doping. The underlying evolution of the electron system in the absence of superconductivity is still unclear, and a question of central importance is whether it involves any intermediate phase with broken symmetry. The Fermi surface of the electronic states in the underdoped 'YBCO' materials YBa2Cu3O(y) and YBa2Cu4O8 was recently shown to include small pockets, in contrast with the large cylinder that characterizes the overdoped regime, pointing to a topological change in the Fermi surface. Here we report the observation of a negative Hall resistance in the magnetic-field-induced normal state of YBa2Cu3O(y) and YBa2Cu4O8, which reveals that these pockets are electron-like rather than hole-like. We propose that these electron pockets most probably arise from a reconstruction of the Fermi surface caused by the onset of a density-wave phase, as is thought to occur in the electron-doped copper oxides near the onset of antiferromagnetic order. Comparison with materials of the La2CuO4 family that exhibit spin/charge density-wave order suggests that a Fermi surface reconstruction also occurs in those materials, pointing to a generic property of high-transition-temperature (T(c)) superconductors."
https://openalex.org/W2068030382,"Nuclear processes such as transcription, DNA replication and recombination are dynamically regulated by chromatin structure. Eukaryotic transcription is known to be regulated by chromatin-associated proteins containing conserved protein domains that specifically recognize distinct covalent post-translational modifications on histones. However, it has been unclear whether similar mechanisms are involved in mammalian DNA recombination. Here we show that RAG2--an essential component of the RAG1/2 V(D)J recombinase, which mediates antigen-receptor gene assembly--contains a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger that specifically recognizes histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me3). The high-resolution crystal structure of the mouse RAG2 PHD finger bound to H3K4me3 reveals the molecular basis of H3K4me3-recognition by RAG2. Mutations that abrogate RAG2's recognition of H3K4me3 severely impair V(D)J recombination in vivo. Reducing the level of H3K4me3 similarly leads to a decrease in V(D)J recombination in vivo. Notably, a conserved tryptophan residue (W453) that constitutes a key structural component of the K4me3-binding surface and is essential for RAG2's recognition of H3K4me3 is mutated in patients with immunodeficiency syndromes. Together, our results identify a new function for histone methylation in mammalian DNA recombination. Furthermore, our results provide the first evidence indicating that disrupting the read-out of histone modifications can cause an inherited human disease."

However, the signal transduction mechanisms that link glutamate receptor activation to intracellular effectors that accomplish structural and functional plasticity are not well understood. Here we report that NMDA receptor activation in pyramidal neurons causes CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) kalirin-7 at residue threonine 95, regulating its GEF activity, leading to activation of small GTPase Rac1 and rapid enlargement of existing spines. Kalirin-7 also interacts with AMPA receptors and controls their synaptic expression. By demonstrating that kalirin expression and spine localization are required for activity-dependent spine enlargement and enhancement of AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission, our study identifies a signaling pathway that controls structural and functional spine plasticity.

How central excitatory synapses change during plasticity is a central question in neuroscience because knowledge of the mechanisms of this process will help us understand normal brain functions such as cognition, and learning and memory, as well as pathological conditions such as mental retardation, mental illness, and addiction. In the last decade, enormous progress has been made in understanding the phenomenology and mechanisms of functional plasticity of central synapses. However, much less is known about the mechanisms that control synaptic structural plasticity of existing synapses. Such structural changes of spines complement functional changes, and it is becoming clear that synapse structure and function are tightly correlated (Kasai et al., 2003Kasai H. Matsuzaki M.

Svoboda K. Malinow R. Experience strengthening transmission by driving AMPA receptors into synapses.Science. 2003; 299: 1585-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent activation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is necessary for induction of both structural and functional plasticity (Matsuzaki et al., 2004Matsuzaki M.

Bron C.R. Muller D. LTP promotes formation of multiple spine synapses between a single axon terminal and a dendrite.Nature. 1999; 402: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). CaMKII is a serine/threonine kinase regulated by Ca2+/calmodulin, which is highly abundant in spines. CaMKII is activated and autophosphorylated during LTP, and its activation is necessary and sufficient for the induction of LTP (Lisman et al., 2002Lisman J. Schulman H. Cline H.

CaMKII is required for experience-dependent cortical plasticity (Glazewski et al., 1996Glazewski S. Chen C.M. Silva A. Fox K. Requirement for α-CaMKII in experience-dependent plasticity of the barrel cortex.Science. 1996; 272: 421-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and learning and memory in vivo (Giese et al., 1998Giese K.P.

Nevertheless, the substrates of CaMKII necessary for induction of activity-dependent structural plasticity of mature synapses are not known. At the effector end of the postsynaptic signaling cascades, increased synaptic expression of AMPA receptors (Kopec et al., 2006Kopec C.D. Li B. Wei W. Boehm J. Malinow R.

Honkura N. Ellis-Davies G.C. Kasai H. Structural basis of long-term potentiation in single dendritic spines.Nature. 2004; 429: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar) underlie the maintenance of synaptic potentiation and the associated spine enlargement. On the other hand, the intracellular signaling mechanisms that functionally link NMDA receptor (NMDAR) activation to actin dynamics and receptor trafficking to the synaptic surface are not well understood (Tada and Sheng, 2006Tada T. Sheng M. Molecular mechanisms of dendritic spine morphogenesis.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2006; 16: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). The brain-specific neuronal guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) kalirin-7, an activator of the small GTPase Rac1 and regulator of actin cytoskeletal dynamics, is enriched in dendritic spines through interactions of its C tail with postsynaptic scaffolding proteins including PSD-95, SAP-102, and SAP97, where it controls spine morphogenesis (Penzes et al., 2000Penzes P. Johnson R.C. Alam M.R. Kambampati V. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. An isoform of kalirin, a brain-specific GDP/GTP exchange factor, is enriched in the postsynaptic density fraction.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6395-6403Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, Penzes et al., 2001Penzes P. Johnson R.C. Sattler R. Zhang X. Huganir R.L. Kambampati V. Mains R.E.

For these reasons, kalirin-7 is in an optimal position to relay signals initiated by NMDAR activation to the intracellular machinery that drives cytoskeletal rearrangements and receptor trafficking, to control activity-dependent structural and functional spine plasticity in mature spines. Importantly, Rho GTPases including the kalirin-7 target Rac1 are key regulators of spine morphogenesis, Rac1 specifically inducing spine formation and enlargement (Tashiro et al., 2000Tashiro A. Minden A. Yuste R. Regulation of dendritic spine morphology by the rho family of small GTPases: antagonistic roles of Rac and Rho.Cereb. Cortex. 2000; 10: 927-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Mutations in genes encoding several components of the Rho GTPase signaling pathway cause mental retardation (Ramakers, 2002Ramakers G.J. Rho proteins, mental retardation and the cellular basis of cognition.Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 191-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), demonstrating a key role for proteins in these pathways in human cognitive development. To understand the mechanisms that control activity-dependent plasticity of existing spines and coordinate it with synaptic functional plasticity, in this study we investigated the signal transduction mechanisms that functionally link activation of glutamate postsynaptic receptors with the machinery that controls rapid spine structural and functional modifications that maintain plasticity. We report that in developed pyramidal neurons, activation of NMDARs causes rapid spine enlargement, associated with activation of Rac1 and CaMKII. In turn, CaMKII interacts with kalirin-7 in spines and phosphorylates it. Activity-dependent phosphorylation of kalirin-7 and Rac1 activation require the association of kalirin-7 with the postsynaptic density, as well as active CaMKII. We show that kalirin-7 also interacts with the GluR1 subunit of AMPARs, controlling their synaptic expression and maintenance and AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission. We demonstrate that CaMKII activity, kalirin expression, and spine localization of kalirin are required for activity-dependent insertion of GluR1 into spines, spine enlargement, and enhancement of AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission. Taken together, our study identifies a signaling pathway that controls structural and functional spine plasticity. Rapid enlargement of dendritic spines, induced by specific patterns of synaptic stimulation and occurring in parallel with enhancement of synaptic transmission, is thought to contribute to the establishment of long-lasting synapse potentiation (Maletic-Savatic et al., 1999Maletic-Savatic M.

Malinow R. Glutamate receptor exocytosis and spine enlargement during chemically induced long-term potentiation.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2000-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). However, the intracellular mechanisms that control activity-dependent rapid spine enlargement are not known. To induce activity-dependent spine remodeling we activated synaptic NMDARs on cultured cortical pyramidal neurons by acutely unmasking receptors previously inhibited with APV (Xie et al., 2005Xie Z. Huganir R.L. Penzes P. Activity-dependent dendritic spine structural plasticity is regulated by small GTPase Rap1 and its target AF-6.Neuron. 2005; 48: 605-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We examined neurons at DIV28, when the majority of synapses are mature and the formation and elimination of synapses reach equilibrium (Holtmaat et al., 2005Holtmaat A.J. Trachtenberg J.T. Wilbrecht L. Shepherd G.M. Zhang X. Knott G.W. Svoboda K. Transient and persistent dendritic spines in the neocortex in vivo.Neuron. 2005; 45: 279-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). This treatment induced rapid spine enlargement: average spine areas were 30%–70% larger (basal, 0.62 ± 0.04; 5 min activated, 0.78 ± 0.054; 30 min activated, 0.95 ± 0.055 μm2, p < 0.001; Figure 1A and see Figures S6A and S6B in the Supplemental Data available with this article online), while inducing significant spine elongation at later time points (Xie et al., 2005Xie Z.

Activity-dependent dendritic spine structural plasticity is regulated by small GTPase Rap1 and its target AF-6.Neuron. 2005; 48: 605-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We confirmed this activity-dependent rapid spine enlargement in live neurons using time-lapse imaging (Figure 1B). Activation of synaptic NMDARs using an independent protocol in neurons cultured in the absence of APV by a short treatment with the coagonist glycine (Lu et al., 2001Lu W. Man H. Ju W. Trimble W.S.

These changes in spine morphology have a comparable time course to those associated with induction of LTP or caused by glutamate uncaging in other studies (Kopec et al., 2006Kopec C.D. Li B. Wei W. Boehm J. Malinow R. Glutamate receptor exocytosis and spine enlargement during chemically induced long-term potentiation.J.

Structural basis of long-term potentiation in single dendritic spines.Nature. 2004; 429: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar). This enlargement of spines was also associated with functional enhancement of synaptic transmission, indicated by increased average AMPA-mediated mEPSC frequency (basal, 3.11 ± 0.17/s; activated, 5.05 ± 0.75/s; p < 0.05; Figure 1C). To investigate the molecules that link NMDAR activation with structural remodeling of spines, we examined the activation of the small GTPase Rac1. This G protein is a central regulator of the actin cytoskeleton, spine enlargement, activity-dependent dendrite growth (Sin et al., 2002Sin W.C. Haas K. Ruthazer E.S. Cline H.T.

Rac1 induces the clustering of AMPA receptors during spinogenesis.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 10627-10636Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We found that, in pyramidal neurons, activation of NMDARs also resulted in activation of Rac1 with the same temporal dynamics as spine morphogenesis (5 min, 1.92 ± 0.23; 30 min, 4.42 ± 0.74; p < 0.005; Figure 1D), suggesting that activation of Rac1 may underlie activity-dependent spine enlargement as well as AMPAR synaptic expression. CaMKII is required for the induction of LTP, spine enlargement associated with potentiation, and multiple forms of plasticity and learning and memory (Glazewski et al., 1996Glazewski S. Chen C.M.

Structural basis of long-term potentiation in single dendritic spines.Nature. 2004; 429: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar); hence, we reasoned that it may also be crucial for mediating downstream signaling from NMDARs to the actin cytoskeleton. To determine whether NMDAR activation induced activation of CaMKII, we examined the phosphorylation of CaMKII in neurons in which we activated NMDARs, as compared to untreated control neurons (p < 0.001; Figures 1E and 1F). As expected, activation of NMDARs resulted in rapid phosphorylation of CaMKII (within 30 min), which was blocked by the CaMKII inhibitor KN-62 (Matsuzaki et al., 2004Matsuzaki M. Honkura N. Ellis-Davies G.C. Kasai H. Structural basis of long-term potentiation in single dendritic spines.Nature. 2004; 429: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar) (p < 0.005; Figure 1G). Importantly, preincubation with KN-62 also blocked activity-dependent spine enlargement and increase in linear spine density (area: basal, 0.65 ± 0.04; activated, 0.98 ± 0.03; activated + KN-62, 0.62 ± 0.05 μm2, p < 0.001; Figures 1G and 1H and Figure S6C), demonstrating that NMDAR activity-dependent spine enlargement requires CaMKII activation. The downstream targets of CaMKII that may regulate spine enlargement are not known. We reasoned that this function may be fulfilled by GEFs for Rac1, which could catalyze CaMKII-dependent activation of Rac1 leading to actin remodeling. We have previously reported that the brain-specific Rac1-GEF kalirin-7 is enriched in dendritic spines and regulates spine morphogenesis (Penzes et al., 2000Penzes P. Johnson R.C. Alam M.R. Kambampati V. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. An isoform of kalirin, a brain-specific GDP/GTP exchange factor, is enriched in the postsynaptic density fraction.J. Biol.

Bioinformatics algorithms indicate that kalirin-7 contains several putative CaMKII phosphorylation sites (Figure S1B). Hence, kalirin-7 may relay signals from NMDARs, via CaMKII, to control activity-dependent spine remodeling. To test whether CaMKII and kalirin-7 interacted functionally, we examined their physical association in rat forebrain homogenates and cultured pyramidal neurons. CaMKII coimmunoprecipitated with kalirin-7 and PSD-95 from rat forebrain homogenates (Figure 2A), suggesting that these proteins participate in the same multiprotein complex. Indeed, in dissociated cultures of cortical neurons, kalirin-7 and CaMKII colocalized in spines (Figure 2B). These results place kalirin-7 in proximity of CaMKII in spines, potentially enabling it to phosphorylate kalirin-7. To test whether CaMKII can phosphorylate kalirin-7, we coexpressed them in hEK293 cells and examined the phosphorylation of kalirin-7 by western blotting with a phospho-threonine (Thr) antibody (Lisman et al., 2002Lisman J. Schulman H. Cline H. The molecular basis of CaMKII function in synaptic and behavioural memory.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 175-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). While kalirin-7 alone was not phosphorylated, its coexpression with CaMKIIα (constitutively active, -CA, or wild-type) resulted in its phosphorylation (Figure 2C). This was dependent on the presence of phosphatase inhibitors and was blocked by KN-62 (Figures 2C and 2D). These results suggest that activation of NMDARs may induce Thr phosphorylation of kalirin-7. Indeed, activation of NMDARs in cortical neuronal cultures resulted in Thr phosphorylation of kalirin-7 (Figure 2E), suggesting that kalirin-7 phosphorylation by CaMKII may occur in synapses upon NMDAR activation. To identify the region of kalirin sequence that contained the CaMKII phosphorylation sites, we coexpressed truncated forms of kalirin containing or lacking specific domains with CaMKIIα and examined the phosphorylation of kalirin-7 (Figure 2F). While full-length kalirin-7 was phosphorylated on Thr residues, a mutant lacking the N terminus (kalirin-5) or mutants containing only the DH-PH or spectrin domains were not. This indicates that the CaMKII phosphorylation site is within the N-terminal 300 amino acids of kalirin-7, in agreement with the predicted CaMKII phosphorylation site at Thr 95 (T95) (Figure S1B). Remarkably, purified CaMKII/calmodulin phosphorylates purified kalirin-7 in vitro (Figure 2G), and the presence of inhibitors of PKA, P"

https://openalex.org/W2130432173,"Acetylcholine is a ubiquitous cortical neuromodulator implicated in cognition. In order to understand the potential for acetylcholine to play a role in visual attention, we studied nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) localization and function in area V1 of the macaque. We found nAChRs presynaptically at thalamic synapses onto excitatory, but not inhibitory, neurons in the primary thalamorecipient layer 4c. Furthermore, consistent with the release enhancement suggested by this localization, we discovered that nicotine increases responsiveness and lowers contrast threshold in layer 4c neurons. We also found that nAChRs are expressed by GABAergic interneurons in V1 but rarely by pyramidal neurons, and that nicotine suppresses visual responses outside layer 4c. All sensory systems incorporate gain control mechanisms, or processes which dynamically alter input/output relationships. We demonstrate that at the site of thalamic input to visual cortex, the effect of this nAChR-mediated gain is an enhancement of the detection of visual stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2089468762,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are seven transmembrane domain proteins that transduce extracellular signals across the plasma membrane and couple to the heterotrimeric family of G proteins. Like most intrinsic membrane proteins, GPCRs are capable of oligomerization, the function of which has only been established for a few different receptor systems. One challenge in understanding the function of oligomers relates to the inability to separate monomeric and oligomeric receptor complexes in membrane environments. Here we report the reconstitution of bovine rhodopsin, a GPCR expressed in the retina, into an apolipoprotein A-I phospholipid particle, derived from high density lipoprotein (HDL). We demonstrate that rhodopsin, when incorporated into these 10 nm reconstituted HDL (rHDL) particles, is monomeric and functional. Rhodopsin·rHDL maintains the appropriate spectral properties with respect to photoactivation and formation of the active form, metarhodopsin II. Additionally, the kinetics of metarhodopsin II decay is similar between rhodopsin in native membranes and rhodopsin in rHDL particles. Photoactivation of monomeric rhodopsin·rHDL also results in the rapid activation of transducin, at a rate that is comparable with that found in native rod outer segments and 20-fold faster than rhodopsin in detergent micelles.

They recognize a wide variety of extracellular stimuli (e.g. light, tastes, odors, hormones, neurotransmitters, and cytokines, etc.) leading to direct activation of intracellular and membrane-associated G proteins that in turn regulate various downstream effectors (e.g. adenylyl cyclase, phospholipase Cβ, and ion channels, etc.) (2Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4700) Google Scholar).

To complicate the pharmacology of these targets, GPCRs associate as oligomers of two or more receptors in cellular membranes (3Angers S. Salahpour A. Bouvier M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 409-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). The growing list of GPCRs that form either hetero- or homomeric complexes implies that oligomerization is important. However, an essential role of oligomerization for GPCR function has not been established. Evidence that an isolated, monomeric GPCR in a biological membrane is fully capable of stimulating nucleotide exchange by G proteins has been difficult to demonstrate. Intuitively, detergent solubilization and monodispersion of membrane proteins into micelles should represent a suitable substitute for a phospholipid bilayer. However, mounting evidence suggests otherwise, as detergents can have profound deleterious effects on the structure and function of membrane proteins (4Cha K. Reeves P.J. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl.

The HDL platform represents a dramatic improvement over detergent micelles for maintaining GPCRs in a monomeric, monodispersed, but more importantly, functionally intact state. Here we report the isolation of bovine rhodopsin, a prototypical GPCR (13Ridge K.D. Palczewski K. J. Biol.

Biochem. 2006; 75: 743-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), in reconstituted HDL (rHDL) particles (Fig. 1). We take advantage of the unique spectral qualities of rhodopsin to demonstrate that it exists as a monomer in rHDL and to follow its activity and behavior compared with rhodopsin in native membranes isolated from rod outer segments (ROS). We find that the rates of formation and decay of metarhodopsin II (meta II), the active form of the receptor, for monomeric rhodopsin are identical to those observed in ROS. We also show that monomeric rhodopsin is capable of stimulating rapid nucleotide exchange on Gt transducin, a photoreceptor-specific G protein, at rates comparable with those observed in ROS. These data show that monomeric rhodopsin is fully functional with regard to G protein activation and suggest that receptor oligomerization does not play an essential role in this process. Expired human sera were generously donated by Dr. Bert La Du (University of Michigan). All lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). N-Dodecyl β-d-maltoside (DDM) was obtained from Dojindo Molecular Technologies (Gaithersburg, MD). Concanavalin A (ConA)-Sepharose, Triton X-100, and sodium cholate were purchased from Sigma. Frozen bovine retina were obtained from J. A. Lawson Co. (Lincoln, NE). All other reagents were of analytical grade. Purification of Human ApoA-I–ApoA-I was purified from human serum essentially as described by Gan et al. (15Gan K.N. Smolen A. Eckerson H.W. La Du B.N. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1991; 19: 100-106PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, clarified serum was diluted into a conditioning buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm CaCl2, 3 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) and added to an equal volume of Cibacron Blue F3GA-agarose (Sigma) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm CaCl2, 3 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA (Buffer A). The slurry was stirred for 30 min and then batch washed by filtration through a Whatman No. 1 filter in a Büchner funnel five times with Buffer A or until the absorbance (λ = 280 nm) of the filtrate was less than 0.025 OD. The resin was then washed with 2 additional volumes of Buffer A without NaCl (Buffer B). The residual cake was resuspended in an equal volume of Buffer B and transferred to a column. ApoA-I was then eluted with Buffer B containing 5 mm cholate, yielding fractions with purities typically between 80 and 90%. Peak fractions were pooled, concentrated, and then diluted 1:1 in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100 and loaded on to a Q-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) column. The column was washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100 (Buffer C) and eluted with a shallow linear gradient with Buffer C, containing 1 m NaCl. Peak fractions (>95% purity) were buffer exchanged into 100 mm potassium acetate, pH 5.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100 and applied to an SP-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 25 mm potassium acetate, pH 5.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100 (Buffer D). The column was washed in Buffer D, and apoA-I was eluted with a linear gradient of Buffer D containing 1 m NaCl. Residual contaminants were removed by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) in 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm cholate, at 4 °C. ApoA-I fractions were pooled and concentrated (∼10 mg/ml), then dialyzed at 4 °C against 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm cholate, and stored at -80 °C until further use. Purification of Bovine Rhodopsin–Rhodopsin was purified from ROS isolated from bovine eyes as described previously (16Okada T. Tsujimoto R. Muraoka M. Funamoto C. Haga T. G Protein-coupled Receptors: Structure, Function, and Ligand Screening. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL2005: 245-261Google Scholar), a procedure that yielded rhodopsin with an A280 nm/A500 nm absorbance ratio of 1.63. ZnSO4 was removed by dialysis in the presence of 0.1% DDM (final) to avoid precipitation of added cholate during the subsequent rHDL preparation. In Vitro Reconstitution of HDL–HDL was reconstituted in vitro essentially as described by Jonas (17Jonas A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 553-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) and palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylglycerol were used in combination at a 3:2 molar ratio to mimic the zwitterionic environment of a cell membrane (18Cerione R.A. Ross E.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 329-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Lipids were dried under argon (or nitrogen) from a chloroform solution and desiccated under vacuum for 30-60 min to remove residual chloroform. Then briefly, lipids were solubilized in 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1mm EDTA (Buffer A) containing 50 mm detergent (DDM or cholate) and added to purified rhodopsin. ApoA-I was then added and the mixture incubated for 1-2 h on ice. The final concentrations of the components were 1 μm rhodopsin, 24 mm detergent, 8 mm lipids, and 100 μm apoA-I. This mixture was added to Bio-Beads (Bio-Rad) to remove the detergents. Samples were stored on ice until used. All of the above procedures were performed under dim red light λ > 640 nm. Analytical Size Exclusion Chromatography–Analytical size exclusion chromatography was performed on an HR10/30 column (GE Healthcare) packed with about 20 ml of Superdex 200 preparative resin (GE Healthcare) (V0 = 7 ml). The column was calibrated with thyroglobulin (molecular mass of 669 kDa, Stokes diameter 17.2 nm, elution volume (Ve) 9.1 ml, apoferritin (432 kDa, Stokes diameter 12.2 nm, Ve 10.6 ml), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa, Stokes diameter 9.1 nm, Ve 13.2 ml), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa, Stokes diameter 7.2 nm, Ve 14.7 ml), and carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa, Stokes diameter 4 nm, Ve 17.8 ml). Samples were loaded in 100-500-μl static loops and run at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min using the BioLogic DuoFlow system (Bio-Rad) at 4 °C. Column fractions, 200 μl each, were collected in a 96-well plate for further analysis. Chromatography of rhodopsin samples was performed under dim red light. UV-visible Absorbance Assays–All UV-visible absorbance assays were performed in UV-transparent 96-well plates (Corning Glass) on a SpectraMax 190 plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The PathCheck™ feature was used for normalizing path lengths to 1 cm. Rhodopsin concentrations were determined by the absorbance change at λ = 500 nm before and after bleaching with 40,600 m-1 cm-1 used as the extinction coefficient (19Wald G. Science. 1968; 162: 230-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Rhodopsin photoactivation was achieved by illuminating samples for 15 s with a 500-watt halogen lamp affixed with a 495 nm long pass filter (Melles Griot, Rochester, NY). Meta II Formation and Decay Spectra–Rhodopsin samples were adjusted to pH 6.0 and photoactivated as described above. Subsequent absorbance spectra were recorded at 0, 5, 10, 15, and 30 min. The meta II decay rate was measured by the tryptophan fluorescence (λexcitation = 295 nm and λemission = 330 nm) method of Farrens and Khorana (20Farrens D.L. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5073-5076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). All measurements were performed with 10 nm rhodopsin in a buffer consisting of 10 mm BisTris-HCl, pH 6.0 (or 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, where indicated), containing 100 mm NaCl, which favors the formation of the meta II state. Similar meta II decay measurements were made at pH 8.0 using a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 100 mm NaCl. An LS 55 luminescence spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used to measure the intrinsic fluorescence increase because of Trp residues that correlates with the decrease in the protonated Schiff base concentration (data not shown but consistent with Refs. 20Farrens D.L.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9165-9171Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Rhodopsin·rHDL or ROS membranes were bleached by a Fiber-Lite illuminator for 15 s immediately before the fluorescence measurements. Bleaching was carried out from a distance of 15 cm, to prevent heat accumulation, and a thermostat was applied to stabilize the temperature of the cuvette at 20 °C. Fluorometer slit settings were 2.5 nm at λ = 295 nm for excitation and 8.0 nm at λ = 330 nm for emission. Purification of Rhodopsin-rHDL Particles by ConA-Sepharose Chromatography–Prior to use, the ConA-Sepharose resin was cross-linked with glutaraldehyde as described previously (23De Grip W.J. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 197-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The cross-linked resin was then poured into a column and pre-washed with 5 column volumes of 1 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, and then equilibrated with 10 column volumes 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2. The sample was then loaded onto the column and continuously passed through until at least 90% had bound as determined by A500 (five passes were usually sufficient). The column was then washed with at least 10 column volumes of the equilibration buffer. Rhodopsin·rHDL particles were eluted with the equilibration buffer containing 200 mm α-methylmannose. All procedures were performed at 4 °C in the dark. Rhodopsin·rHDL Purification by 1D4 Immunoaffinity Chromatography–Reconstituted rhodopsin·rHDL was loaded on a 1D4-coupled CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated with a buffer consisting of 10 mm BisTris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. The flow-through fraction was reloaded onto the same column two additional times. The beads were washed with the equilibration buffer until the absorbance at 280 nm was below 0.01. Purified rhodopsin·rHDL was eluted with 100 μm nonapeptide TETSQVAPA (from the rhodopsin C-terminal sequence) in the above buffer at room temperature. The purified rhodopsin concentration was determined using a Cary 50 (Varian) UV-visible spectrophotometer. All procedures were performed in the dark. Rhodopsin:ApoA-I Molar Ratio–Rhodopsin:apoA-I ratios were determined from ConA-Sepharose or 1D4 affinity-purified rhodopsin·rHDL preparations using the known extinction coefficients for rhodopsin (40,600 m-1 cm-1 at λ = 500 nm) (19Wald G. Science. 1968; 162: 230-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar) and apoA-I (31,720 m-1 cm-1 at λ = 280 nm) (24Pownall H.J. Massey J.B.

Activation of Transducin–Photoactivation of Gt was performed as described previously (25Jastrzebska B. Fotiadis D. Jang G.F. Stenkamp R.E. Engel A. Palczewski K. J. Biol.

Rhodopsin concentrations were determined by the absorbance change at λ = 500 nm before and after bleaching using the extinction coefficient of 40,600 m-1 cm-1 for purified rhodopsin (19Wald G. Science. 1968; 162: 230-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Gt concentration was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Purified, native bovine Gt heterotrimer (Gtα, β1, γ1) was added to rhodopsin in sonicated bovine ROS membranes before the measurement or rhodopsin·rHDL. Photoactivation was done at a Gt:rhodopsin ratio of 8.3:1 at a concentration of 250 nm and rhodopsin at 30 nm, within the linear range of fluorescence change and protein concentration. The measurement was performed in a buffer consisting of 20 mm BisTris-HCl, pH 6.0, containing 120 mm NaCl and 6 mm MgCl2. The sample was bleached for 15 s with a Fiber-Lite using a long pass wavelength filter (λ > 490 nm) and followed by a 400-s incubation with continuous low speed stirring. Transducin activation was initiated by the addition of GTPγS(5 μm final). Activation was monitored by following the intrinsic fluorescence increase from Gtα using an LS 55 luminescence spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) employing excitation and emission wavelengths of λ = 300 nm and λ = 345 nm, respectively, at 20 °C (21Heck M.

Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). No signals from rhodopsin without transducin were detected in control experiments (not shown). Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)–Reconstituted HDL samples were placed on a carbon-coated copper grid and stained with 1% phosphotungstic acid, pH 6.5. Samples were imaged with a Philips CM-100 TEM operating at 60 kV. Purified (either ConA or 1D4 immunoaffinity) rhodopsin·rHDL particles were adsorbed for 10 s to parlodion carbon-coated copper grids rendered hydrophilic by glow discharge at low pressures. Grids were washed with double distilled water and stained with 0.75% uranyl formate. Electron micrograph images of rhodopsin·rHDL particles were recorded with a Hitachi H-7000 TEM operated at 100 kV. Photoactivation of rhodopsin results in the isomerization of its covalently bound ligand 11-cis-retinal (absorbance maximum, λ = 500 nm) to all-trans-retinal, creating meta II (λ = 380 nm), a spectroscopically distinct form (19Wald G. Science. 1968; 162: 230-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Successful reconstitution of rhodopsin into HDL particles was observed using a mixture of POPC and palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylglycerol at a 3:2 ratio, consistent with the notion that optimal photoisomerization to the meta II state requires unsaturated lipids of 16 carbons or greater (28O'Brien D.F. Costa L.F. Ott R.A. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1295-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). POPC alone was also used successfully (data not shown). Incorporation of rhodopsin into rHDL, in the presence of excess rHDL, yielded particles with Stokes diameters of 10.5 nm based on detection at λ = 280 nm as assessed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC), whereas the peak at absorbance at λ = 500 nm eluted with an estimated diameter of 11 nm (Fig. 2a). No absorbance at λ = 500 nm was observed with empty HDL particles (not shown). Analysis of the peak SEC fraction by spectroscopy indicates that rhodopsin in rHDL is functional as it photoisomerized to the active meta II state (Fig. 2b). It is important to note that removal of the detergent in the absence of lipid and/or apoA-I severely alters the integrity of rhodopsin. If either component is excluded, most of the rhodopsin precipitates and pellets after brief sedimentation in a microcentrifuge (16,000 × g for 2 min). Any rhodopsin that seemed not to sediment migrated in the void volume of the size exclusion column, suggesting that it formed large protein aggregates or was contained in proteoliposomes (data not shown). When both components were included, we routinely observed reconstitution efficiencies of 70-90%, based on absorbance at λ = 500 nm. To determine the rhodopsin:rHDL stoichiometry, we utilized the known extinction coefficients of rhodopsin (at λ = 280 and λ = 500 nm) and apoA-I (at λ = 280 nm) to calculate the molar ratio of [rhodopsin]:[apoA-I] in purified rhodopsin·rHDL preparations. Rhodopsin·rHDL purified by either ConA-Sepharose (taking advantage of the glycosylated rhodopsin) (Table 1) or by 1D4 immunoaffinity chromatography (data not shown) and then resolved by SEC (Fig. 3a). The average [rhodopsin]:[apoA-I] molar ratio of the SEC peak fractions was determined to be 0.47 ± 0.05 (Table 1 and Fig. 3a). Note that the A280:A500 ratio of rhodopsin is unaltered by reconstitution in phospholipids in comparison with detergent micelles (see supplemental Fig. 7). Taking into consideration that there are two apoA-I proteins per rHDL particle (17Jonas A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 553-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 29Jonas A. Wald J.H. Toohill K.L. Krul E.S. Kezdy K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22123-22129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these data suggest that only one rhodopsin molecule is reconstituted per rHDL. The purified rhodopsin·rHDL complexes also had a Stokes diameter of 11 nm based on their elution volume from the SEC column (Fig. 3a). This rules out the possibility that larger rHDL particles were formed (i.e. two rhodopsins to four molecules of apoA-I, still in a 0.5:1 ratio). Moreover, TEM of the 1D4-immunopurified rhodopsin·rHDL complexes shows a monodispersed and homogeneous rhodopsin·rHDL particle morphology with an estimated diameter of 13.7 ± 1.4 nm (n = 105; Fig. 3b). We attribute the slightly larger diameter compared with those estimated by SEC and the previously reported HDL sizes (30Segrest J.P. Li L. Anantharamaiah G.M. Harvey S.C. Liadaki K.N. Zannis V. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2000; 11: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) to a commonly observed flattening artifact of particles by surface tension during drying of the stain (31Forte T.M.

Exposure to light resulted in a rapid and almost complete conversion of the absorbance spectra of rhodopsin·rHDL from λ = 500 nm (rhodopsin) to λ = 380 nm (meta II). Over a time course of 30 min at pH 6.0 (Fig. 4a), meta II slowly decayed to both free all-trans-retinal (as observed in the slight red-shift of the λ = 380 nm peak) and meta III (as observed in the increase of the λ = 465 nm peak). This sequence is identical to that observed for rhodopsin in native ROS membranes (19Wald G. Science. 1968; 162: 230-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar) as well as for rhodopsin reconstituted in long chain phospholipid-containing vesicles (28O'Brien D.F. Costa L.F. Ott R.A.

Photoactivation under higher pH conditions (pH 8.0) was rapid; however, progression out of meta I (λmax ∼ 480 nm) appears slower (Fig. 4b), consistent with previously established biophysical properties of rhodopsin (35Matthews R.G. Hubbard R. Brown P.K. Wald G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1963; 47: 215-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Using the method of Farrens and Khorana (20Farrens D.L. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5073-5076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), we determined that the time constant, τ, for the meta II decay for rhodopsin in rHDL was 19.2 ± 0.75 min (Fig. 4d), nearly identical to the decay rate for rhodopsin from ROS (20 ± 2.4 min) (Fig. 4c) and similar to previously observed values (25Jastrzebska B.

Unlike other members of the heterotrimeric G protein family, transducin (Gt) can be suspended in solution in the absence of detergent (36Baehr W. Morita E.A. Swanson R.J. Applebury M.L. J. Biol.

Transducin activation may be accomplished by simply adding the heterotrimer to rhodopsin preparations, whether in ROS membranes or as a purified protein. Fig. 5a illustrates that activation of transducin by photoactivated rhodopsin from ROS membranes, at 8.3:1 Gt:rhodopsin ratio, occurred with a rate constant of ∼1.7 × 10-2 s-1, comparable with previously reported values (22Fahm"

Its extreme adaptations for herbivory at ground-level challenge current hypotheses regarding feeding function and feeding strategy among diplodocoids, the larger clade of sauropods that includes Nigersaurus. We used high resolution computed tomography, stereolithography, and standard molding and casting techniques to reassemble the extremely fragile skull. Computed tomography also allowed us to render the first endocast for a sauropod preserving portions of the olfactory bulbs, cerebrum and inner ear, the latter permitting us to establish habitual head posture. To elucidate evidence of tooth wear and tooth replacement rate, we used photographic-casting techniques and crown thin sections, respectively. To reconstruct its 9-meter postcranial skeleton, we combined and size-adjusted multiple partial skeletons. Finally, we used maximum parsimony algorithms on character data to obtain the best estimate of phylogenetic relationships among diplodocoid sauropods. Nigersaurus taqueti shows extreme adaptations for a dinosaurian herbivore including a skull of extremely light construction, tooth batteries located at the distal end of the jaws, tooth replacement as fast as one per month, an expanded muzzle that faces directly toward the ground, and hollow presacral vertebral centra with more air sac space than bone by volume. A cranial endocast provides the first reasonably complete view of a sauropod brain including its small olfactory bulbs and cerebrum. Skeletal and dental evidence suggests that Nigersaurus was a ground-level herbivore that gathered and sliced relatively soft vegetation, the culmination of a low-browsing feeding strategy first established among diplodocoids during the Jurassic."

https://openalex.org/W2034174370,"Episodes of nonvolcanic tremor and accompanying slow slip recently have been observed in the subduction zones of Japan and Cascadia. In Cascadia, such episodes typically last a few weeks and differ from “normal” earthquakes in their source location and moment-duration scaling. The three most recent episodes in the Puget Sound/southern Vancouver Island portion of the Cascadia subduction zone were exceptionally well recorded. In each episode, we saw clear pulsing of tremor activity with periods of 12.4 and 24 to 25 hours, the same as the principal lunar and lunisolar tides. This indicates that the small stresses associated with the solid-earth and ocean tides influence the genesis of tremor much more effectively than they do the genesis of normal earthquakes. Because the lithostatic stresses are 10 5 times larger than those associated with the tides, we argue that tremor occurs on very weak faults."

High n-3 PUFA dietary consumption completely prevented the MPTP-induced decrease of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-labeled nigral cells (P<0.01 vs. MPTP mice on control diet), Nurr1 mRNA (P<0.01 vs. MPTP mice on control diet), and dopamine transporter mRNA levels (P<0.05 vs. MPTP mice on control diet) in the substantia nigra. Although n-3 PUFA dietary treatment had no effect on striatal dopaminergic terminals, the high n-3 PUFA diet protected against the MPTP-induced decrease in dopamine (P<0.05 vs. MPTP mice on control diet) and its metabolite dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (P<0.05 vs. MPTP mice on control diet) in the striatum. Taken together, these data suggest that a high n-3 PUFA dietary intake exerts neuroprotective actions in an animal model of Parkinsonism."
https://openalex.org/W2110520657,"To discover new genes involved in axon navigation, we conducted a forward genetic screen for recessive alleles affecting motor neuron pathfinding in GFP reporter mice mutagenized with ENU. In Magellan mutant embryos, motor axons were error prone and wandered inefficiently at choice points within embryos, but paradoxically responded to guidance cues with normal sensitivity in vitro. We mapped the Magellan mutation to the Phr1 gene encoding a large multidomain E3 ubiquitin ligase. Phr1 is associated with the microtubule cytoskeleton within neurons and selectively localizes to axons but is excluded from growth cones. Motor and sensory neurons from Magellan mutants display abnormal morphologies due to a breakdown in the polarized distribution of components that segregate between axons and growth cones. The Magellan phenotype can be reversed by stabilizing microtubules with taxol or inhibiting p38MAPK activity. Thus, efficacious pathfinding requires Phr1 activity for coordinating the cytoskeletal organization that distinguishes axons from growth cones."

https://openalex.org/W2170310896,"Trafficking of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) is regulated by specific interactions of the subunit intracellular C-terminal domains (CTDs) with other proteins, but the mechanisms involved in this process are still unclear. We have found that the GluR1 CTD binds to cGMP-dependent protein kinase II (cGKII) adjacent to the kinase catalytic site. Binding of GluR1 is increased when cGKII is activated by cGMP. cGKII and GluR1 form a complex in the brain, and cGKII in this complex phosphorylates GluR1 at S845, a site also phosphorylated by PKA. Activation of cGKII by cGMP increases the surface expression of AMPARs at extrasynaptic sites. Inhibition of cGKII activity blocks the surface increase of GluR1 during chemLTP and reduces LTP in the hippocampal slice. This work identifies a pathway, downstream from the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) and nitric oxide (NO), which stimulates GluR1 accumulation in the plasma membrane and plays an important role in synaptic plasticity."

Nature. 2007; 445: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (3703) Google Scholar). The dataset provides both mRNA in situ hybridization (ISH) data and a detailed reference atlas. This resource represents a comprehensive platform for exploring gene expression in the brain and can be used to examine and compare expression of all selenoprotein genes. A bioinformatics algorithm has also been developed that allows semi-automatic searches for genes showing similar hybridization patterns (27Liu Z. Yan S.F. Walker J.R. Zwingman T.A. Jiang T. Li J. Zhou Y. BMC Syst. Biol. 2007; 1: 19Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this work, we extracted expression information for various brain regions based on the ISH image data provided by ABA for all mammalian selenoprotein genes as well as for the Sec machinery genes (i.e. the genes involved in Sec biosynthesis and incorporation). We normalized and quantified the original gene expression data and clustered them by hierarchical cluster analysis to identify linkages among selenoproteins and between selenoproteins and the Sec machinery. Our analysis identified neurons in hippocampus, olfactory area, cerebellar cortex, and isocortex as the sites with increased selenoprotein gene expression. Cluster analysis allowed us to identify functional links among selenoproteins and their biosynthetic machinery. The results of this study open new opportunities for research on Se, an essential trace element, and are important for understanding the relationship between Se and brain function. The ABA Resources and Query Proteins—The ABA provides an automated platform for high throughput ISH that supports systematic analysis of gene expression in young adult (8-week-old) mouse brain (26Lein E.S.

We also used a subsequent software tool, Brain Explorer version 1.3 (downloaded from the ABA website), for viewing ABA gene expression data in the framework of the Allen Reference Atlas (ARA) in three dimensions, comparing expression data for multiple genes and navigating two-dimensional ISH images from the ABA. Both coronal and sagittal datasets were analyzed for each gene of interest if available. We analyzed expression data for 24 known mouse selenoprotein genes and for genes coding for known Sec machinery components. Except for SelH, ISH data were available for all examined genes (each was manually selected and viewed through the publicly accessible ABA application) as follows: (i) selenoproteins (total of 23) GPx1, GPx2, GPx3, GPx4, TR1 (Txnrd1), TGR (Txnrd3), TR3 (Txnrd2), Dio1, Dio2, Dio3, SelI (D5Wsu178e), SelK, SelM, SelN (Sepn1), SelO (1300018J18Rik), SelP (Sepp1), SelR (or MsrB1, Sepx1), SelS (H47), SelT (2810407C02Rik), SelV (BC089491), SelW (Sepw1), SPS2 (Sephs2), and Sep15; and (ii) Sec machinery (total of 5): Sec synthase (D5Ertd135e), PSTK, Secp43 (Trspap1), SBP2 (Secisbp2), and EF-Sec (Eefsec). It should be noted that SPS2 is both a Sec-containing protein and a component of the Sec insertion machinery. In addition, we also included a recently identified SelP receptor, ApoER2 (28Olson G.E. Winfrey V.P. Nagdas S.K. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12290-12297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Several housekeeping genes were also examined, including β-actin (Actb), α-tubulin (Tuba1), hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (Hprt), ribosomal protein L11 (Rpl11), dynein cytoplasmic 1 heavy chain 1 (Dync1h1), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh), and cytochrome c1 (Cyc1). These genes served as controls, and for quantification purposes (see below), Hprt was used. Brain Regions of ARA—ARA provides an anatomic framework for brain regions. When selecting an ISH image pane, the relevant ARA automatically updates to the nearest corresponding reference atlas section. In our work, we selected 159 regions, including major parts of the brain: cerebral cortex (25 regions), cerebral nuclei (14 regions), cerebellar cortex (18 regions), cerebellar nuclei (3 regions), interbrain (including thalamus and hypothalamus, 22 and 18 regions, respectively), midbrain (23 regions), hindbrain (33 regions), and non-neuron regions (3 regions). A complete list of these regions is shown in supplemental Table S1. Definition of Gene Expression Signals in Different Regions of Mouse Brain—To extract the expression information for each gene (including controls) and for different brain regions from the original ISH images, we used both the ABA on-line tool and Brain Explorer to visually examine expression signals based on the relative measurement of gene expression provided by ABA (hereafter RMABA). RMABA is labeled on a discrete eight-color scale of increasing level of expression (from low to high: blue-aqua-turquoise-bright green-yellow-gold-light orange-orange), as the ISH process is not strongly quantitative in the sense of measuring transcript copy number (26Lein E.S. Hawrylycz M.J. Ao N. Ayres M. Bensinger A. Bernard A. Boe A.F. Boguski M.S. Brockway K.S. Byrnes E.J. Chen L. Chen L. Chen T.-M. Chin M.C. Chong L.J. Crook B.E. Czaplinska A. Dang C.N. Datta S.

Young R.C. Youngstrom B.L. Yuan X.F. Zhang B. Zwingman T.A. Jones A.R. Nature. 2007; 445: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (3703) Google Scholar). In addition, the range of expression (Rex, percentage of expressing area in a given region normalized by the whole area) was considered. We used the following tags to manually define the gene expression signal in each region: (i) -, no signal observed in the area; (ii) +/-, RMABA is blue, and Rex < 5%; (iii) +,RMABA is blue to aqua, and Rex < 25%; (iv) +∼++,RMABA is aqua to turquoise, and Rex ≥ 25%; (v) ++,RMABA is green or yellow, and Rex ≥ 50%; (vi) ++∼+++,RMABA is yellow to gold, and Rex ≥ 50%; (vii) +++,RMABA is light orange or orange, and Rex ≥ 50%; (viii) ++++,RMABA is orange, and Rex ≥ 75%. A series of increasing integers from 0 to 7 were then assigned to the above tags, and the initial gene expression signal profiles were obtained for each gene. We repeated this procedure twice for both the ABA on-line tool and Brain Explorer software. Finally, four independent datasets (or replicates) were obtained. Gene Expression Signal Normalization and Quantification—The gene expression signals defined above could not be directly used to measure the abundance of selenoprotein mRNAs. Instead, we utilized experimental mRNA levels for different selenoprotein genes and Sec machinery genes in the whole mouse brain, which were determined using real time PCR (29Hoffmann P.R. Höge S.C. Li P.A. Hoffmann F.W. Hashimoto A.C. Berry M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 3963-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), to quantify gene expression. The reported mRNA levels of different selenoproteins and Sec machinery in whole mouse brain were normalized to the Hprt gene, whose levels were most consistent, among housekeeping genes, when different tissues and animals were considered (29Hoffmann P.R. Höge S.C. Li P.A. Hoffmann F.W. Hashimoto A.C. Berry M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 3963-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This gene was also used to normalize the ABA expression signals within brain regions. Given the observed expression signal Xg,i of a query gene g and Xh,i of a control gene h in region i, the normalized expression signal could be calculated as shown in Equation 1, Es(g,i)=Xg,i+qgXh,i+qg(Eq. 1) where qg is an “artificial” value (or pseudocount) to avoid zero-probability expression when no signal of a particular gene was observed in certain region. In this study, we defined qg = 0.1. The average expression signal E¯s(g) among 159 brain regions was then calculated as shown in Equation 2, E¯s(g)=∑iEs(g,i)Ni(Eq. 2) where Ni is the number of brain regions (159 in this study). Here, E¯s(g) was regarded as measure of the mRNA levels for selenoproteins and Sec machinery in the whole mouse brain (designated E(g)). Based on the correlation between E¯s(g) and E(g), the abundance of mRNA (normalized by Hprt) in a given brain region E(g,i) could then be inferred as indicated in Equation 3, E(g,i)=Es(g,i)E(g)E¯s(g)(Eq. 3) The final E(g,i) was calculated as the average of replicates. Gene Expression Profile Clustering—To investigate the relationship among expression patterns of different genes, normalized expression values were further quantified as shown in Equation 4, Mg,i=∑tilnE(g,i,ti)E(g,0,ti)ti(Eq. 4) where ti is the number of available replicates for region i, and (g,0,ti) is the average expression value of gene g in all regions in the tith replicate. If the expression value was not available, Equation 5 was used, Mg,i=∑tilnEs(g,i,ti)Es(g,0,ti)ti(Eq. 5) where Es(g,0,ti) is the average expression signal of gene g in all regions in the tith replicate. Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed with CLUSTER software (30Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13234) Google Scholar). We chose the complete linkage clustering algorithm in the software for gene clustering, and the final results were represented graphically using the Java TreeView tool (31Saldanha A.J. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2004; 20: 3246-3248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2343) Google Scholar). Cells with log ratios of 0 (unchanged compared with the average level) were colored black, increasingly positive log ratios with red of increasing intensity, and increasingly negative log ratios with green of increasing intensity, respectively. In Situ Hybridization of SelM and SelH—The expression of SelM and SelH genes at different developmental stages and adult rat brain was studied by in situ hybridization. For this purpose, three brains per time point were dissected and frozen in the gaseous phase of liquid nitrogen. Frontal and horizontal sections (10-15 μm) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (w/v), washed in 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4), and dehydrated. For in situ hybridization, the following antisense (and corresponding sense) oligonucleotides were used: 5′-gag ctt tcg tgg agg gcc ctt ctt aat acc agt cca gag ttc aac ac-3′ (SelH, GenBank™ accession number EST235143_R), and 5′-gga ggt gct tca tca cca ggt tgt ggt aca gtt gaa tgt cct gag tga ca-3′ (SelM, GenBank™ accession number XM_223554). The chosen oligonucleotides showed no significant cross-matches with other nonredundant and EST nucleotide sequences by BLAST analyses. Immunofluorescence Confocal Microscopy Analysis of SelM—Whole mouse brains were dissected from adult mice immediately after decapitation and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 2 h (all procedures were carried out at room temperature). After three washes in PBS (15 min each), the samples were dehydrated through an ethanol series and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin sections of the brain samples (∼5 μm thick) were processed using standard de-paraffin and re-hydration methods, blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h, and incubated for 2 h in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and rabbit anti-SelM antibodies (1:100 dilution). Brain sections were then washed three times (15 min each) in PBS-T and incubated in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS-T containing Cy5-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgGs (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1:100) for 1 h. After three rinses in PBS-T, the samples were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, mounted, and examined with an Olympus FV500 confocal system. Western Blot Analyses—Different brain parts, including the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, hypothalamus, cerebral cortex and cerebellar cortex, were isolated from freshly dissected mouse brains. These brain parts, along with the other tissues from the same mouse (liver and testis), were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at -80 °C. Samples were homogenized in PBS containing complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), sonicated, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min. Supernatants were collected, and the lysates were normalized with regard to protein concentration. 10% BisTris NOVEX gels (Invitrogen) were used, and each well was loaded with 25 μg of indicated tissue homogenate. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Invitrogen), and probed with specific antibodies described previously by our laboratories (also shown in the Supplemental Material). Secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were from Amersham Biosciences, and chemiluminescent peroxidase substrate was from Sigma. Global Analysis of Selenoprotein and Sec Machinery Gene Expression in Mouse Brain—Original ISH image data could be identified in the ABA dataset for 23 selenoprotein genes and 5 Sec machinery genes. The remaining mouse selenoprotein gene (SelH), was not represented in the ABA dataset, but it was detected in mouse brain in previous studies (29Hoffmann P.R. Höge S.C. Li P.A. Hoffmann F.W. Hashimoto A.C. Berry M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 3963-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and we experimentally verified its expression during development in rat brain. Thus, all mouse (rodent) selenoprotein genes appear to be expressed in the brain. Whether a full selenoproteome is also expressed in other organs is not known. We further analyzed expression profiles of all detected selenoprotein genes across 159 brain regions. The corresponding expression levels for each selenoprotein gene were then calculated using absolute mRNA levels for whole mouse brains (based on real time PCR data) that were recently reported by Berry and co-workers (29Hoffmann P.R. Höge S.C. Li P.A. Hoffmann F.W. Hashimoto A.C. Berry M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 3963-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We utilized a common control gene (Hprt) to link the two datasets, and all data were normalized to this gene. Based on the normalized mRNA expression values, gene expression levels of all examined genes for each brain region were divided into four groups as follows: undetectable (<0.05), low expression (0.05-0.5), medium expression (0.5-2), and high expression (>2). Distribution and general features of selenoprotein gene expression are shown in Fig. 1. Six (GPx4, SelK, SelM, SelP, SelW, and Sep15) of 23 selenoprotein genes showed at least a medium expression level in more than half and a high expression level in one-third of brain regions. These genes were designated as highly expressed genes. Of these six genes, GPx4, SelP, and SelW genes were expressed at a high level in over 90% of brain regions. These observations are consistent with previous studies that found high SelP and SelW gene expression in rodent brain (15Nakayama A. Hill K.E. Austin L.M. Motley A.K. Burk R.F. J.

On the other hand, many selenoprotein genes, including those coding for essential proteins, e.g. cytosolic and mitochondrial TRs, and those expressed at high levels in certain organs, e.g. GPx2, GPx3, and TGR, were expressed at low levels or had undetectable mRNA in most brain regions. Moreover, GPx1 and TR1, the best characterized and most abundant selenoproteins in liver and many other organs, were not among the highly expressed selenoprotein genes. It is also interesting that the three Dio genes (Dio1-3), which were previously reported to be significantly expressed in the developing brain of mammals (33Guadaño-Ferraz A. Obregón M.J.

https://openalex.org/W2081901194,"NEIL1 and NEIL2 compose a family of DNA glycosylases that is distinct from that of the other two DNA glycosylases, OGG1 and NTH1, all of which are involved in repair of oxidized bases in mammalian genomes. That the NEIL proteins, unlike OGG1 and NTH1, are able to excise base lesions from single-stranded DNA regions suggests their preferential involvement in repair during replication and/or transcription. Previous studies showing S phase-specific activation of NEIL1, but not NEIL2, suggested NEIL1 involvement in the repair of replicating DNA. Here, we show that human NEIL1 stably interacts both in vivo and in vitro with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), the sliding clamp for DNA replication. PCNA stimulates NEIL1 activity in excising the oxidized base 5-hydroxyuracil from single-stranded DNA sequences including fork structures. PCNA enhances NEIL1 loading on the substrate. In contrast, although present in the NEIL2 immunocomplex, PCNA does not stimulate NEIL2. NEIL1 interacts with PCNA via a domain that is located in a region near the C terminus, dispensable for base excision activity. The interacting sequence in NEIL1, which lacks the canonical PCNA-binding motif, includes a sequence conserved in DNA polymerase delta and implicated in its PCNA binding. Mammalian two-hybrid analysis confirmed PCNA interaction with NEIL1. The G127A mutation in PCNA reduces its stimulatory activity, suggesting that the interdomain connector loop, a common binding interface of PCNA, is involved in NEIL1 binding. These results strongly support in vivo function of NEIL1 in preferential repair of oxidized bases in DNA prior to replication."
https://openalex.org/W2008841770,"We identified seven locations on or near the transform plate boundary in California where nonvolcanic tremor was triggered by the 2002 Denali earthquake. This result implies that the conditions essential for nonvolcanic tremor exist in a range of tectonic environments. Models explaining tremor typically require conditions endemic to subduction zones, that is, high temperatures and fluid pressures, because previously tremor was nearly exclusively documented in subduction zones. The absence of tremor in geothermal areas is inconsistent with such models. Additionally, we found no correlation between creeping or locked faults and tremor, contrary to predictions of frictional models of tremor."

We examined the potential of bone marrow-derived (BMD) progenitor cells to contribute to repair and remodeling of lung and heart in a rat monocrotaline (MCT) model of pulmonary hypertension. Bone marrow from green fluorescent protein (GFP)-transgenic male rats was transplanted into GFP-negative female rats. The chimeric animals were injected with MCT to produce pulmonary hypertension. Significant numbers of male GFP-positive BMD cells engrafted in the lungs of MCT-treated rats. Microarray analyses and double-immunohistochemistry demonstrated that many of the cells were interstitial fibroblasts or myofibroblasts, some of the cells were hematopoietic cells, and some were pulmonary epithelial cells (Clara cells), vascular endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells. A few BMD cells fused with pulmonary cells from the host, but the frequency was low. In the hypertrophied hearts of MCT-treated rats, we found a significant increase in the relative numbers of BMD cells in the right ventricle wall as compared with the left ventricle. Some of the BMD cells in the right ventricle were vascular cells and cardiomyocytes. We report BMD cardiomyocytes with a normal chromosome number, fusion of BMD cells with host cardiomyocytes, and, in some cases, nuclear fusion."
https://openalex.org/W1985505057,"White dwarfs represent the endpoint of stellar evolution for stars with initial masses between approximately 0.07 and 8-10, where is the mass of the Sun (more massive stars end their life as either black holes or neutron stars). The theory of stellar evolution predicts that the majority of white dwarfs have a core made of carbon and oxygen, which itself is surrounded by a helium layer and, for approximately 80 per cent of known white dwarfs, by an additional hydrogen layer. All white dwarfs therefore have been traditionally found to belong to one of two categories: those with a hydrogen-rich atmosphere (the DA spectral type) and those with a helium-rich atmosphere (the non-DAs). Here we report the discovery of several white dwarfs with atmospheres primarily composed of carbon, with little or no trace of hydrogen or helium. Our analysis shows that the atmospheric parameters found for these stars do not fit satisfactorily in any of the currently known theories of post-asymptotic giant branch evolution, although these objects might be the cooler counterpart of the unique and extensively studied PG 1159 star H1504+65 (refs 4-7). These stars, together with H1504+65, might accordingly form a new evolutionary sequence that follows the asymptotic giant branch."

https://openalex.org/W2047997122,"Symmetric cell divisions have been proposed to rapidly increase neuronal number late in neurogenesis, but how critical this mode of division is to establishing a specific neuronal layer is unknown. Using in vivo time-lapse imaging methods, we discovered that in the laminated zebrafish retina, the horizontal cell (HC) layer forms quickly during embryonic development upon division of a precursor cell population. The precursor cells morphologically resemble immature, postmitotic HCs and express HC markers such as ptf1a and Prox1 prior to division. These precursors undergo nonapical symmetric division at the laminar location where mature HCs contact photoreceptors. Strikingly, the precursor cell type we observed generates exclusively HCs. We have thus identified a dedicated HC precursor, and our findings suggest a mechanism of neuronal layer formation whereby the location of mitosis could facilitate rapid contact between synaptic partners."
https://openalex.org/W1991145039,"Development of appropriate dendritic arbors is crucial for neuronal information transfer. We show, using seizure-related gene 6 (sez-6) null mutant mice, that Sez-6 is required for normal dendritic arborization of cortical neurons. Deep-layer pyramidal neurons in the somatosensory cortex of sez-6 null mice exhibit an excess of short dendrites, and cultured cortical neurons lacking Sez-6 display excessive neurite branching. Overexpression of individual Sez-6 isoforms in knockout neurons reveals opposing actions of membrane-bound and secreted Sez-6 proteins, with membrane-bound Sez-6 exerting an antibranching effect under both basal and depolarizing conditions. Layer V pyramidal neurons in knockout brain slices show reduced excitatory postsynaptic responses and a reduced dendritic spine density, reflected by diminished punctate staining for postsynaptic density 95 (PSD-95). In behavioral tests, the sez-6 null mice display specific exploratory, motor, and cognitive deficits. In conclusion, cell-surface protein complexes involving Sez-6 help to sculpt the dendritic arbor, in turn enhancing synaptic connectivity."
https://openalex.org/W2004093231,"Enoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductase catalyzes the last step of the fatty acid elongation cycle. The paradigm enoyl-ACP reductase is the FabI protein of Escherichia coli that is the target of the antibacterial compound, triclosan. However, some Gram-positive bacteria are naturally resistant to triclosan due to the presence of the triclosan-resistant enoyl-ACP reductase isoforms, FabK and FabL. The genome of the Gram-negative bacterium, Vibrio cholerae lacks a gene encoding a homologue of any of the three known enoyl-ACP reductase isozymes suggesting that this organism encodes a novel fourth enoyl-ACP reductase isoform. We report that this is the case. The gene encoding the new isoform, called FabV, was isolated by complementation of a conditionally lethal E. coli fabI mutant strain and was shown to restore fatty acid synthesis to the mutant strain both in vivo and in vitro. Like FabI and FabL, FabV is a member of the short chain dehydrogenase reductase superfamily, although it is considerably larger (402 residues) than either FabI (262 residues) or FabL (250 residues). The FabV, FabI and FabL sequences can be aligned, but only poorly. Alignment requires many gaps and yields only 15% identical residues. Thus, FabV defines a new class of enoyl-ACP reductase. The native FabV protein has been purified to homogeneity and is active with both crotonyl-ACP and the model substrate, crotonyl-CoA. In contrast to FabI and FabL, FabV shows a very strong preference for NADH over NADPH. Expression of FabV in E. coli results in markedly increased resistance to triclosan and the purified enzyme is much more resistant to triclosan than is E. coli FabI. Enoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductase catalyzes the last step of the fatty acid elongation cycle. The paradigm enoyl-ACP reductase is the FabI protein of Escherichia coli that is the target of the antibacterial compound, triclosan. However, some Gram-positive bacteria are naturally resistant to triclosan due to the presence of the triclosan-resistant enoyl-ACP reductase isoforms, FabK and FabL.

Fatty acid synthesis is essential for the formation of membranes and hence for the viability of all cells excepting the Archaea. The bacterial fatty acid synthesis system (FAS II) 2The abbreviations used are: FASfatty acid synthesisACPacyl carrier proteinORFopen reading frameSDRshort chain dehydrogenase reductase. 2The abbreviations used are: FASfatty acid synthesisACPacyl carrier proteinORFopen reading frameSDRshort chain dehydrogenase reductase. differs significantly from the mammalian and fungal system (FAS I). Whereas FAS I systems use complex multifunctional proteins to synthesize fatty acids, bacteria use separate discrete proteins for each step of the biosynthesis pathway (1Cronan J.E. Cell. 2006; 126: 641-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 2Cronan J.E. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 232-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In the FAS II systems of bacteria, chloroplasts, apicoplasts, and mitochondria, each acyl intermediate is channeled among enzymes as an acyl carrier protein (ACP) thioester. The differences between the FAS I and FAS II systems make the FAS II enzymes good targets for antibacterial inhibitors (3Campbell J.W. Cronan Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 305-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 4Heath R.J. Rock C.O. Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2004; 5: 146-153PubMed Google Scholar, 5Payne D.J. Warren P.V. Holmes D.J.

Chem. 2006; 281: 17541-17544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The paradigm FAS II system is that of Escherichia coli and this has provided an excellent model system. Most FAS II enzymes are relatively conserved among bacteria and some domains of the FAS I proteins are clearly derived from FAS II proteins (7Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7927-7931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An exception is the last step of the elongation cycle (Fig. 1) formation of a saturated acyl-ACP by an NAD(P)H-dependent reduction of the enoyl-ACP double bond. In E. coli this reaction is catalyzed by the product of the fabI gene, which was discovered as the target for the antibacterial action of a set of diazaborine compounds. FabI was later shown to also be the site of action of triclosan (8McMurry L.M. Oethinger M. Levy S.B. Nature. 1998; 394: 531-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar), an antibacterial compound used in hand soaps and a large variety of other everyday products. Although FabI homologues are widely distributed in bacteria and other FAS II-containing organisms, the existence of a number of bacterial species naturally resistant to triclosan was soon recognized. In these bacteria triclosan resistance was due to the presence of other enoyl-ACP reductase isozymes of varying resistance to triclosan. Bacillus subtilis contains two isozymes, a FabI homologue and a somewhat triclosan-resistant isozyme called FabL (9Heath R.J. Su N. Murphy C.K. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40128-40133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) that, like FabI, is a member of the short chain dehydrogenase reductase superfamily. Streptococcus pneumoniae contains a single enoyl-ACP reductase, FabK, that is refractory to triclosan and is a flavoprotein unrelated to the short chain dehydrogenase reductase isozymes (10Heath R.J. Rock C.O. Nature. 2000; 406: 145-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar).Vibrio cholerae is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes cholera in humans. When we began our work only a single genome sequence was available for this organism (11Heidelberg J.F. Eisen J.A. Nelson W.C. Clayton R.A. Gwinn M.L. Dodson R.J. Haft D.H. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Umayam L. Gill S.R. Nelson K.E. Read T.D. Tettelin H. Richardson D. Ermolaeva M.D. Vamathevan J. Bass S. Qin H. Dragoi I. Sellers P. McDonald L. Utterback T. Fleishmann R.D. Nierman W.C. White O. Salzberg S.L. Smith H.O. Colwell R.R. Mekalanos J.J. Venter J.C. Fraser C.M. Nature. 2000; 406: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar) and this sequence argued that V. cholerae did not encode a convincing homologue of any of the known enoyl-ACP reductase isozymes (FabI, FabK, or FabL). This conclusion was recently confirmed by shotgun genome sequences of a large number of V. cholerae strains now available from the NCBI genomes data base. Moreover, the genome sequences of other Vibrio species also show the lack of known enoyl-ACP reductase homologues. The lack of a FabI homologue was especially surprising because otherwise the Vibrio FAS proteins are very similar to those of E. coli. Indeed, the major FAS II gene clusters of E. coli and V. cholerae have almost identical organizations. We report the isolation of the gene that encodes a fourth enoyl-ACP reductase isozyme that we have named FabV and some properties of the new enzyme.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—E. coli strain JP1111, which carried the temperature-sensitive (Ts) fabI392 allele, was obtained from the Coli Genetic Stock Center, Yale University. The mutation, which will be called fabI(Ts), allows growth at 30 °C but blocks growth at 42 °C. The temperature-sensitive activity of the mutant enzyme has been directly demonstrated (12Bergler H. Fuchsbichler S. Hogenauer G. Turnowsky F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and is due to a single point mutation (13Bergler H. Hogenauer G. Turnowsky F. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 2093-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Strain EPI300 (genotype recA1 endA1 araD139 Δ(ara,leu)7697 trfA, with the trfA gene being under arabinose regulation) (14Wild J. Hradecna Z. Szybalski W. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 1434-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) was made temporarily proficient in homologous recombination by introducing plasmid pEAK2, which carries a functional recA gene on an unstable plasmid (15Kouzminova E.A. Kuzminov A. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1279-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To move the fabI(Ts) mutation from JP1111 into this strain a closely linked Tn10 transposon insertion was introduced into the JP1111 chromosome by transduction to tetracycline resistance at 30 °C with a phage P1vir stock grown on the trpC::Tn10 strain CAG18455 (16Nichols B.P. Shafiq O. Meiners V. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6408-6411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Singer M. Baker T.A. Schnitzler G. Deischel S.M. Goel M. Dove W. Jaacks K.J. Grossman A.D. Erickson J.W. Gross C.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 53: 1-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) followed by screening for recombinants that remained temperature sensitive. A phage P1vir stock grown on one of these recombinants was then used to transduce the EPI300 (pEAK2) strain to tetracycline resistance at 30 °C with screening for temperature sensitivity and loss of the pEAK2 antibiotic resistance determinant to give strain PMT03. For plasmid constructions the primers listed in supplemental Table 1S were used to amplify the fabV gene from the complementing cosmid using Pfu Turbo® DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The PCR products were directly cloned into the expression vectors as given in supplemental Table 1S using the EcoRI and PstI restriction sites included in the primer sequences. Cloning into pET101 was performed using the Champion pET101 Directional TOPO expression kit (Invitrogen). Plasmids expressing the native form of FabV were obtained by use of primers CtagVcfor and NtagVcREV for insertion into pET101 and primers EcoVCfor and PstVCREV for insertion into pBAD322. The plasmids expressing the C-terminal His6-tagged form of FabV were obtained by use of primers CtagVcfor and NtagVcREV for insertion into pET101 and primers EcoVCfor and pBADCtagVc rev for insertion into pBAD322. The pBAD322-derived plasmid that expressed the N-terminal His6-tagged form of FabV were obtained by use of primers pBADNtagVc and PstVCREV. The plasmid constructions were verified by DNA sequencing performed by the Keck Genomics Center of this institution.Cosmid Library Production and Subcloning—The CopyControl Fosmid Library Production Kit from Epicentre (Madison, WI) was used to generate an unbiased V. cholerae genomic library. The pCC1FOS vector carries two origins of replication, a single copy origin (ori2) and an inducible high copy origin (oriV) (14Wild J. Hradecna Z. Szybalski W. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 1434-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA from cells of the V. cholerae biotype albensis strain ATCC 14547 was extracted using the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega, Madison, WI). The DNA fragments were obtained by mechanically shearing genomic DNA by 20 passages through a 200-μl pipette tip. The resulting DNA fragments were end-repaired to 5′-phosphorylated blunt ends and then separated on a 0.8% low melting point-agarose gel run overnight at 30 V. Sheared DNA fragments of about 40 kb were size selected, gel-purified, ligated to the dephosphorylated pCC1FOS vector, and then packaged into λ phage particles. This was used to transduce the fabI(Ts) E. coli recipient strain PMT03 to chloramphenicol resistance at 30 °C under conditions where the entering plasmids would replicate at single copy. The resulting transductants were then tested for the ability to grow at 42 °C, the nonpermissive temperature of the fabI(Ts) allele. A complementing clone that grew well at 42 °C was obtained. The purified complementing cosmid was again transformed into the fabI(Ts) strain PMT03 to confirm the complementation. This strain was then induced with arabinose to induce the cosmid to high copy number and large quantities of the complementing cosmid DNA were obtained using the Qiagen Large-construct Kit (Valencia, CA). The cosmid was then partially sequenced using vector-specific primers to localize the insert DNA on the V. cholerae genome. To obtain smaller complementing clones 50 μg of the 40-kb cosmid was sonicated for 5 s, and the DNA fragments were end-repaired before ethanol precipitation in the presence of glycogen. Fragments larger than 3 kb were gel-purified, cloned into the pCC1FOS vector. The resulting plasmids were then transformed into mutant strain PMT03 and screened for complementation at 42 °C and for triclosan resistance at 30 °C. Each complementing subclone was completely sequenced and its genomic location identified by a BLAST search against the V. cholerae El Tor N16961 genome (11Heidelberg J.F. Eisen J.A. Nelson W.C. Clayton R.A. Gwinn M.L. Dodson R.J. Haft D.H. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Umayam L. Gill S.R. Nelson K.E. Read T.D. Tettelin H. Richardson D. Ermolaeva M.D. Vamathevan J. Bass S. Qin H. Dragoi I. Sellers P. McDonald L. Utterback T. Fleishmann R.D. Nierman W.C. White O. Salzberg S.L. Smith H.O. Colwell R.R. Mekalanos J.J. Venter J.C. Fraser C.M. Nature. 2000; 406: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar) using the TIGR Comprehensive Microbial Resource website (cmr.tigr.org).Enzyme Purification—Primers were designed for cloning the candidate gene into a pET101 expression vector from the Invitrogen Champion pET101 Directional TOPO Expression Kit (Carlsbad, CA). Six histidine codons were added at the 3′-end of the gene to produce a His tag at the C-terminal end of the protein. The gene was PCR-amplified using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The PCR fragment was cloned into pET101, sequenced, then transformed into BL21 Star (DE3) chemically competent cells from Invitrogen. The expression of the cloned fragment was induced with 150 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The crude extract was then applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid spin column from Qiagen (Valencia, CA), washed with the lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole), and the reductase eluted with 250 mm imidazole in the same buffer. Similarly, the native protein (lacking a histidine-tag) was also cloned and overexpressed from the pET101 vector. Purification was first performed through a Vivapure D maxi H spin column from Vivascience (Sartorius). The protein was washed with 4 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8) lysis buffer, discontinuously eluted with a 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 700, or 1000 mm NaCl. Most of the reductase was eluted with 400 mm NaCl. The fractions eluted at 400 and 500 mm NaCl were pooled, then desalted by overnight dialysis before passing through a Blue Sepharose column from using the ÅKTA purification apparatus (GE Healthcare). Elution from the affinity column was achieved using a 2 m LiCl buffer solution after washing with 15 column volumes of 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7). Finally the protein was concentrated by ultracentrifugation using a 30,000 MWCO Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter device from Millipore.Fatty Acid Synthesis Assays—The ability of the new gene to restore in vivo fatty acid synthesis was tested by transforming the fabI(Ts) mutant strain, JP1111 with a plasmid in which the gene encoding the putative V. cholerae enoyl-ACP reductase had been inserted into the arabinose inducible pBAD322 vector (18Cronan J.E. Plasmid. 2006; 55: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The cultures were grown at permissive temperature, induced with arabinose, shifted to 42 °C, and then [1-14C]acetate (specific activity, 55 mCi/mmol) from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. (St Louis, MO) was added as described in Lai and Cronan (19Lai C.Y. Cronan J.E. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1869-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Labeled phospholipids were extracted, run on a thin layer chromatography plate, and visualized after overnight exposure to x-ray film (19Lai C.Y. Cronan J.E. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1869-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The in vitro fatty acid synthesis assay was performed using a mixture of 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7), 0.1 m LiCl, 50 μm acetyl-CoA, 25 μm holo-ACP, 150 μm NADH, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 200 μg of ammonium sulfate fraction of a cell extract (7Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7927-7931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 5 μg of pure C-terminal His6-tagged FabV protein (when added). Following addition of 25 μm [2-14C]malonyl-CoA (specific activity, 51 mCi/mmol), the 200-μl reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 45 min (19Lai C.Y. Cronan J.E. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1869-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled malonyl-CoA was purchased from Moravia Biochemicals, Inc. (Brea, CA). Free fatty acids were extracted by saponification followed by acidification and petroleum ether extraction as reported by Gelmann and Cronan (20Gelmann E.P. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 112: 381-387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Cell-free Extract Preparation—Cell cultures of wild type E. coli and the fabI mutant strain JP1111 were centrifuged and resuspended in lysis buffer (0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA) before lysis through a French pressure cell. Partial purification of fatty acid synthetic enzymes was performed by gradual protein precipitation of each lysate with ammonium sulfate. The same procedure was used to prepare V. cholerae extracts. In the case of strain JP1111 the cultures were shifted from 30 to 42 °C for 15 min before harvesting to inactivate the mutant FabI protein.Preparation of Holo-ACP, Apo-ACP, and Crotonyl-ACP—Holo-ACP was purified following the procedure described by Thomas and Cronan (21Thomas J. Cronan J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34675-34683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The purification of apo-ACP was identical to that of holo-ACP, except that AcpH, rather than AcpS, was overexpressed along with AcpP to convert the holo-ACP species to apo-ACP. 3J. Thomas and J. Cronan, unpublished data. Crotonyl-ACP was enzymatically synthesized from crotonyl-CoA purchased from Sigma using B. subtilus Sfp phosphopantetheinyl transferase (22Quadri L.E. Weinreb P.H. Lei M. Nakano M.M. Zuber P. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1585-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar) expressed from pNRD136. In a 30-ml reaction volume, 25 mg of crotonyl-CoA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 30 mg of apo-ACP, and 2 mg of Sfp enzyme were mixed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 10 mm MgCl2 and then incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. The reaction mixture was then precipitated with 5% trichloroacetic acid and 0.02% deoxycholate resuspended, dialyzed, and concentrated with an Amicon ultracentrifugation filter device from Millipore (5,000 MWCO) (21Thomas J. Cronan J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34675-34683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Crotonyl-ACP synthesis was verified on a 20% native gel containing 2.5 m urea and by electrospray mass spectrometry (observed mass 8915.39; calculated mass 8915.09).NADH Oxidation Assay—Enoyl-ACP reductase activity was monitored spectrophotometrically by decrease in absorbance at 340 nm using an NADH extinction coefficient of 6220 m–1. Each 100-μl reaction was performed in disposable UV-transparent microcuvettes obtained from BrandTech Scientific, Inc. The activity assays contained varying concentrations of NADH, 1 pg of the purified native FabV, varying substrate concentrations (crotonyl-CoA or crotonyl-ACP), and 0.1 m LiCl in a 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7). Kinetic constants were determined using GraphPad PRISM version 4 software. The Km values for NADH and NADPH were determined at a crotonyl-ACP concentration of 80 μm. The Km values for crotonyl-ACP and crotonyl-CoA was determined using 150 μm NADH. Triclosan was purchased from KIC Chemicals, Inc. (Armonk, NY).Size Exclusion Chromatography—The native FabV was chromatographed on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column in a 0.15 m NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7 on the AKTA purifier (GE Healthcare). The calibration curve was prepared using chymotrypsinogen, ovalbumin, bovine serum albumin, aldolase, ferritin, and thyroglobulin as standards ranging from 25,000 to 669,000 Da. The FabV peak was detected by absorbance at 280 nm and the reductase activity in the fraction was confirmed by spectrophotometric assay and the size of the monomer was confirmed by 8% SDS-PAGE of the peak fractions.RESULTSIdentification of a V. cholerae Gene Encoding a Novel Enoyl-ACP Reductase—A cosmid was selected from the V. cholerae genomic library that consistently complemented growth of the fabI(Ts) strain PMT03 at 42 °C (Fig. 2A). The large V. cholerae genomic fragment (about 40 kb) carried by the cosmid was fragmented and the fragments were cloned into the same vector to obtain smaller complementing plasmids. Four of these subclones were able to complement growth of the fabI(Ts) mutant strain at 42 °C and only those clones also allowed growth on triclosan at 30 °C (Fig. 2B). Upon partial sequencing, all four clones were found to contain a common genomic region that contained only three open reading frames (ORFs) by comparison with the genome sequence of V. cholerae O1 biovar El Tor. N16961, the only sequenced V. cholerae genome then available. One of the three ORFs (VC1737) was annotated as encoding protein synthesis initiation factor IF-1, whereas the other two ORFs, VC1738 and VC1739, were annotated as hypothetical proteins (supplemental Fig. 1S). The latter two ORFs had been predicted to be in a single transcriptional unit (www.BioCyc.org). To identify these ORFs, a BLAST search of each of the ORFs was performed against all of the bacterial genomes in the data base. Both VC1738 and VC1739 showed homology to a single ORF found in a number of bacterial genomes. These were (accession number follows the species name) Xanthomonas campestris (YP361851) Vibrio parahemeolyticus (NP797610), Vibrio vulnificus (NP761639), Vibrio fischeri (YP204271), Shewanella oneidensis (NP717408, Shewanella denitrificans (YP_563490), Aeromonas hydrophila (YP857138, Xylella fastidiosa (NP779243), and Photobacterium profundum (YP130609). That is, when one of the V. cholerae N16961 ORFs aligned with an ORF of one of these bacteria, the other V. cholerae N16961 ORF aligned with that same ORF without overlap. Hence, the original V. cholerae genomic sequence seemed to contain a frameshift introduced by a sequencing error that had cut a single ORF into two ORFs. We fully sequenced the insert of one of the complementing V. cholerae subclones and found that the VC1738 and VC1739 ORFs were indeed a single ORF consistent with a prediction by the Swiss-Prot data base. The error was omission of a single base within a run of six adenine bases on the coding strand (supplemental Fig. 1S). This was confirmed by the finding that the genome fragment containing the putative VC1738 and VC1739 ORFs expressed only one protein of the molecular mass (45 kDa) expected from elimination of the frameshift (see below). Our sequencing data were subsequently confirmed upon submission of shotgun genomic sequences of a large number of V. cholerae strains to the NCBI Whole Genome Shotgun (wgs) data base. All show that the original VC1738 and VC1739 ORFs lie within a single protein. The comparative analysis of the protein sequence encoded by our candidate gene extended the presence of homologues of our candidate protein to Xanthomonas oryzae (YP449055) Xanthomonas axonopodis (NP640497), Pseudomonas putida (NP746744), Pseudomonas entomophila (YP610084), Yersinia pestis (NP407525), Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (YP072425), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (NP251640), Saccharophagus degradans (YP528097), Methylobacillus flagellatus (YP545785), Burkholderia species (e.g. YP443187) Cytophaga hutchinsonii, Pseudoalteromonas species (e.g. NC008228), Clostridium species (NC008261), Idiomarina loihiensis (NZAAMX01000026), Treponema denticola (NC002967), and Streptomyces avermitilis (NC003155). These alignments range from 96.5% protein identity for the V. fischeri homologue, to 52.9% residue similarity for the Streptomyces avermitilis homologue. We have named the gene fabV and the encoded protein FabV because it is predominately found in Vibrio species and closely related organisms where it seems to be the sole enoyl-ACP reductase. However, due to the diverse reactions catalyzed by the enzymes of the short chain dehydrogenase reductase (SDR) superfamily some of the more poorly aligned proteins may not be enoyl-ACP reductases. Several of the above bacteria are human pathogens and others infect plants and marine organisms. There may be bacteria that have both FabV and FabK such as various of the Clostridia such as Clostridium tetani. However, like FabV various putative FabK homologues may not posses enoyl-ACP reductase activity (23Marrakchi H. Dewolf Jr., W.E. Quinn C. West J. Polizzi B.J. So C.Y. Holmes D.J. Reed S.L. Heath R.J. Payne D.J. Rock C.O. Wallis N.G. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 1055-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2The cosmid complements growth of a E. coli fabI(Ts) strain and also imparts resistance to triclosan. Panel A shows the growth of the E. coli fabI(Ts) mutant strain PMT03 at either the permissive temperature of 30 °C or the nonpermissive temperature of 42 °C when transformed with either the fabV cosmid pMT18 or the vector pCC1fos. Panel B shows the growth of the E. coli fabI(Ts) mutant strain PMT03 at the permissive temperature of 30 °C in the presence or absence of 2 μg/ml triclosan. The medium used was LB medium containing 12 μg/ml chloramphenicol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FabV, like FabI and FabL, is a member of the SDR superfamily (24Duax W.L. Griffin J.F. Ghosh D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 813-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 25Persson B. Kallberg Y. Oppermann U. Jornvall H. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2003; (271–278): 143-144Google Scholar) although FabV aligns only weakly with FabI or FabL even when many gaps are allowed (Fig. 3). FabV does not contain the Tyr-(Xaa)3-Lys motif typical of most members of the SDR superfamily. FabI and FabL also lack this motif and instead use a Tyr-(Xaa)6-Lys active site motif. In FabV another variation is seen, a Tyr-(Xaa)8-Lys motif (Fig. 3). Given the conservation of residues that neighbor the key tyrosine and lysine residues this seems likely to be the FabV active site although this remains to be tested by mutagenesis. Despite the low homology scores FabV can be modeled on the crystal structures of known SDR enoyl-ACP reductases by the Geno3D server (geno3d-pbil.ibcp.fr), which takes into account known protein structures as well as predicted geometrical restraints (26Combet C.

However, at rest these nuclei appear silent due to inhibitory input from extrathalamic regions, and it has therefore remained unclear how sensory gating of these nuclei takes place. In the rodent, the ventral division of the zona incerta (ZIv) serves as a relay station within the paralemniscal thalamocortical projection pathway for whisker-driven motor activity. Most, perhaps all, ZIv neurons are GABAergic, and recent studies have shown that these cells participate in a feedforward inhibitory circuit that blocks sensory transmission in the thalamus. The present study provides evidence that the stimulation of the vibrissa motor cortex suppresses vibrissal responses in ZIv via an intra-incertal GABAergic circuit. These results provide support for the proposal that sensory transmission operates via a top-down disinhibitory mechanism that is contingent on motor activity."

The starkest form of such amplification is categorical perception. In speech, for example, a continuum of phonetic stimuli gets carved into perceptually distinct categories. We used fMRI to measure the degree to which this process of selective amplification takes place. The most categorically processing area was the left supramarginal gyrus: stimuli from different phonetic categories, when presented together in a contrasting pair, were neurally amplified more than two-fold. Low-level auditory cortical areas, however, showed comparatively little amplification of changes that crossed category boundaries.

The approach presented here provides a quantitative way to measure the degree to which such processing is taking place. Although functional neuroimaging studies have yielded a great deal of information about the human brain, the activation maps that are the end result face a fundamental problem. Such maps can show that a specific area is active during a given task, but they do not tell us what type of information processing is reflected by that activity. Neural activity does not come with labels attached. In the present study, we sought to measure the degree to which a specific computational task is being carried out across the brain: the selective amplification of behaviorally significant stimulus differences. An ideally selective amplification would exaggerate only a small set of differences along a given stimulus dimension and would suppress all the others. This is exactly the case in categorical perception. We drew our stimuli from speech perception, the domain in which categorical perception was first demonstrated (Liberman et al., 1957Liberman A.M. Harris K.S. Hoffman H.S. Griffith B.C. The discrimination of speech sounds within and across phoneme boundaries.J. Exp. Psychol. 1957; 54: 358-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). The stimulus continuum consisted of speech sounds, with the phoneme /ba/ at one end and /da/ at the other. These two stop consonants differ only in place of articulation, with the articulatory difference reflected by different starting frequencies for the transitions of the second and third formants. A continuum of ten stimuli was synthesized, evenly spread along the /ba/-/da/ continuum. These stimuli will be referred to by their positions along the continuum, with “1” being the stimulus at the far /ba/ end and “10” being the extreme /da/. Consider two stimuli along that continuum, e.g., items 4 (an impure mix of /ba/ and /da/, but closer to the /ba/ end) and 7 (an impure stimulus, closer to /da/). If these stimuli are presented back-to-back as a contrasting pair, 4-then-7 (henceforth written as 4&7), then we can measure the neural response elicited by the pair, using fMRI. Comparing the neural activity elicited by the contrasting pair to the sum of the activities elicited by its constituent subparts, there are three possibilities. The neural response to the pair may be equal to the sum of its parts, or, in the present shorthand, 4&7 = 4 + 7. This result would suggest that the two stimuli do not neurally interact. Alternatively, the response may be less than the sum of its parts, e.g., 4&7 < 4 + 7. One circumstance that would produce this result would be if a single population of neurons is responding to both stimuli, first to 4 and then, more weakly due to neural adaptation, to stimulus 7. In that situation, the neurons would be treating changes along the 4-to-7 section of the stimulus continuum as invariant (Grill-Spector and Malach, 2001Grill-Spector K. Malach R. fMR-adaptation: a tool for studying the functional properties of human cortical neurons.Acta Psychol. (Amst.). 2001; 107: 293-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). However, other explanations are also possible: the neurons may respond poorly to any sequence of stimuli, habituating nonspecifically, or the reduced fMRI response to the AB pair may be due to rate-limited blood flow rather than neural effects (Boynton and Finney, 2003Boynton G. Finney E. Orientation-specific adaptation in human visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8781-8787PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we looked for cases in which the neural response is greater than the sum of its parts, e.g., 4&7 > 4 + 7. A supralinear response of this kind suggests that an active amplification process is occurring. However, such an amplification is of interest only if it is specific: such increased activity must be elicited not by just any pairing of two stimuli along the continuum, but only by stimuli that lie on opposite sides of a particular boundary. To address this, we need to measure neural responses along the length of the continuum. If a brain area is found not only to amplify stimulus differences but also to do so with specificity, then a third question arises: is that neural amplification correlated with perception and behavior? The phenomenon of categorical perception has all three properties: stimulus differences that do not cross the boundary are suppressed, whereas differences that straddle the category boundary are amplified, with a stimulus on one side of the boundary being perceived as very different from one on the other side, even though the two may be acoustically quite similar. For a continuum of auditory phonetic stimuli, a brain area that responds in this manner is processing the sounds as something more than just raw acoustic waveforms. This need not imply that the stimuli are being processed fully as speech, since nonhuman primates also show sensitivity to phonetic boundaries (Kuhl and Padden, 1983Kuhl P.K. Padden D.M. Enhanced discriminability at the phonetic boundaries for the place feature in macaques.J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 1983; 73: 1003-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). However, selective amplification of this kind is likely to be a necessary property of any neural coding system that is rich enough to represent phonetic categories. The aim of this study was to measure the degree to which brain activity parallels behavior, where the neural process is the selective amplification of stimulus differences and the behavioral phenomenon is categorical phonetic perception. Therefore, to find brain areas that process speech sounds categorically involves two steps. First, behaviorally measure how the subjects perceive stimulus differences along the continuum, to see which differences result in a change of phonetic category and which do not. Second, look for brain activity that selectively amplifies those stimulus differences in a parallel manner, such that differences that cause a phonetic change are neurally amplified, whereas nonphonetic differences are not. Before laying out the details of the experimental design, it may be useful to outline which properties are intended to be measured by our behavioral and neural tests and which properties are not. In particular, the aim of the behavioral tests is to measure the degree to which a particular stimulus difference is perceived as a phonetic difference, e.g., how often a subject hears the stimulus pair 4&7 as consisting of two different phonemes. This same/different phoneme question is subtly different from asking what a subject's sensitivity is to a given acoustic difference. Although acoustic discriminability and phonetic difference tend to go hand-in-hand, a link that is at the core of categorical perception, the two are not identical; acoustic differences can be discriminable even without constituting phonetic differences, and phonetic differences do not always aid acoustic discrimination (Gerrits and Schouten, 2004Gerrits E. Schouten M.E.H. Categorical perception depends on the discrimination task.Percept. Psychophys. 2004; 66: 363-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In the present study, we are seeking neural amplification that tracks phonetic differences. Although other stimulus differences may exist that are acoustically discriminable without being phonetically distinct, our fMRI measures do not attempt to track them. The goal of the fMRI tests is to determine the degree to which the differences between stimuli are amplified, as we wish to find brain areas that specifically amplify differences that cross the perceptual category boundary. Measuring the response to the difference between two stimuli of course involves also measuring the responses to the two stimuli themselves, but it requires an extra step. For each contrasting stimulus pair, we must calculate two measures: the activation elicited by pairing the different stimuli together, and the activation elicited by the same individual phonemes recombined into noncontrasting identical pairs. For example, for the stimuli 4 and 7, we would measure the responses to 4&7 and 7&4 and the responses to 4&4 and 7&7. By subtracting the second measure from the first, i.e., (4&7 + 7&4) − (4&4 + 7&7), we are left with the amount of stimulus amplification caused by the contrast itself, over and above the activation elicited by the constituent subparts. Although such a subtraction, of the form (A&B + B&A) − (A&A + B&B), provides us with a measure of how the pairwise difference between A and B is amplified, it does not tell us what the overall pattern of amplification is along the stimulus continuum. In particular, we are interested in finding patterns of selective amplification that would signify the occurrence of categorical processing: such processing would amplify not just any acoustic difference, but specifically only those differences that the subject perceives as phonetic. To search for such processing, we can compare each subject's behavioral same/different scores to their levels of neural amplification for each A/B pair. If the stimulus differences that a given brain area most strongly amplifies are the ones that the subject perceives as most different, then that constitutes evidence linking that brain area to perception. More precisely, the best match between behavior and a given brain area will occur when the subject's behavioral same/different curve is parallel to that area's neural amplification curve. We can construct a general linear model contrast to measure this by weighting each neural amplification value, of the form (A&B + B&A) − (A&A + B&B), by the percentage of “different” responses that the subject made when presented with the A/B pair, and summing across all such three-step pairs. The overall construction of this contrast is illustrated in Figure 3, and the arithmetical details are described in the Experimental Procedures section. A given voxel in the brain will score a large value on this contrast if it amplifies stimulus differences that cross the person's perceptual phonetic category boundary and also fails to amplify differences that do not cross the category boundary. The brain, at the location of that voxel, is processing the sounds categorically. In order to score a large value, the voxel therefore needs to meet two conditions simultaneously, one neural and one behavioral. The neural condition is that it must amplify some differences along the phonetic continuum. The behavioral condition is that those differences that are neurally amplified must also be the ones that are perceptually amplified by crossing the phonetic category boundary. It is important to consider a difference between the logic of the present design and that of more typical adaptation-fMRI designs. In studies seeking evidence for the occurrence of neural adaptation, the experimentally meaningful signal change is a reduction in neural activity. The presence or absence of such a reduction serves as the logical starting point for claims about neural function (Grill-Spector and Malach, 2001Grill-Spector K. Malach R. fMR-adaptation: a tool for studying the functional properties of human cortical neurons.Acta Psychol. (Amst.). 2001; 107: 293-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). In the present study, the reasoning follows a different path. The signal change that, we will argue, is demonstrated in the data below is not a reduction in neural activity, nor is it an adaptation-release-induced absence of such reduction. Instead, it is an active amplification of neural activity, in particular of activity elicited by stimulus pairs that straddle the phonetic category boundary. The essence of such amplification is that it yields strong overall activation out of weak raw ingredients. These raw ingredients are the individual stimuli that are combined together into the contrasting pair. The less activation these stimuli individually elicit, the weaker are the raw ingredients and the more neural amplification is required if the pair is to elicit strong activation when presented together. The logic underlying neuroimaging of selective amplification could be viewed as the methodological converse of habituation-based methods that are used to look for invariances, such as fMRI-adaptation (Grill-Spector and Malach, 2001Grill-Spector K. Malach R. fMR-adaptation: a tool for studying the functional properties of human cortical neurons.Acta Psychol.

In behavioral testing, subjects were presented with the synthesized speech stimuli and were asked to classify them as either /ba/ or /da/. As is shown in Figure 1A, subjects judged stimulus 1 to be /ba/ and 10 to be /da/ with very high consistency. The subjects' perceptual crossover point between /ba/ and /da/ was clustered around stimulus 5. In order to test for sensitivity to phonetic boundaries that is independent of raw acoustic differences, subjects were presented with stimulus pairs separated by three steps on the /ba/-/da/ continuum, e.g., 1&4, 6&3, 7&10, etc., and asked to say whether they sounded like the same phoneme or different phonemes. Randomly interspersed among the three-step contrasting pairs were equal numbers of pairs of identical stimuli (e.g., 1&1, 4&4, 6&6, etc.) to serve as controls. To prevent possible auditory masking effects, the two stimuli within a pair were separated by 500 ms of silence. As is shown in Figure 1B, subjects' psychophysical responses showed the classical categorical perception effect of classifying stimulus pairs as different if they straddle the category boundary, e.g., 4&7 and 3&6, and as the same if they both fall on the same side of the boundary, even though the acoustic difference is constant across all pairs. The stimulus ordering was not an effect of interest for the purposes of this study, so responses to 4&7 and 7&4, etc., were collapsed together. Note that the quantity plotted along the y axis is the proportion of times the subjects said that a given three-step pair sounded as though it consisted of two different phonemes, i.e., one /ba/ and one /da/. In signal-detection terms, this is the number of “hits.” This quantity was used to construct a behaviorally weighted fMRI contrast, as described in detail below. Because the aim of the study was to see how stimulus differences that count as phonetic differences are neurally amplified, the proportion of “different phoneme” responses was the behavioral measure used to weight the fMRI data. Sensitivity, or d′, showed a similar pattern, consistent with the fact that false-alarm rates remained relatively constant across stimulus conditions (see Figure 2). However, d′ was not used to construct the fMRI contrast, as the resulting measure would be influenced by false-alarm neural processing of identical stimuli mistakenly perceived to be different. Although such false-alarm processing is of considerable interest, it was not the focus of the present study. The same stimuli as were used in the behavioral testing were presented to the subjects in an event-related fMRI design in order to identify brain areas that selectively amplified the stimulus differences in a way that paralleled subjects' categorical perception. To prevent auditory masking by scanner noise, all stimuli were played during silent gaps between scan volumes, using the MRI technique of “clustered volume acquisition.” The neural process that we were interested in was categorical perception, as opposed to decision making, attention, motor-responses, and so on. Although such processes will to some unavoidable extent occur spontaneously, we sought to minimize them by not giving the subjects any phonetic discrimination task while they were in the scanner. Instead, and in order to maintain alertness in the subjects, we randomly interspersed some infrequent catch trials among the three-step pairs and identical-pairs. In these catch trials, both phoneme stimuli were the same, e.g., 6&6, but the second stimulus in the pair was quieter. The subjects' task was to press a button whenever such a trial occurred. This ensured that the subjects listened to all the stimuli, without needing to attend to any phonetic features. In order to construct the behaviorally weighted contrast illustrated in Figure 3, we of course needed to collect the subjects' behavioral identification and discrimination curves at some point. These behavioral tests, described above, were conducted outside of the scanner, a few minutes after each subject had finished their scan. The behaviorally weighted contrast was constructed in order to quantify the degree to which any given brain area is processing speech categorically, such that phonetic differences are selectively amplified and nonphonetic differences are not. After having calculated the contrast for each of the 12 subjects, these contrast images were passed into a random-effects group analysis. Six regions were found to process speech categorically, as measured by this selective-amplification contrast (corrected for multiple comparisons at the cluster level, at p < 0.05). The most significant of these activated regions was the left inferior supramarginal gyrus (shown in Figure 4A), consistent with lesion studies showing that the integrity of this region was more predictive than any other area of preserved ability to discriminate phonemes (Caplan et al., 1995Caplan D. Gow D. Makris N. Analysis of lesions by MRI in stroke patients with acoustic-phonetic processing deficits.Neurology. 1995; 45: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Although the supramarginal gyrus is less often thought of as involved in phonetic processing than the nearby Wernicke's area, a number previous functional imaging studies have highlighted this area as important (Benson et al., 2001Benson R.R. Whalen D.H. Richardson M. Swainson B. Clark V.P. Lai S. Liberman A.M.

Pallier C. LeBihan D. Dehaene S. Dupoux E. Phonological grammar shapes the auditory cortex: a functional magnetic resonance imaging study.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 9541-9546PubMed Google Scholar). The other regions showing this phonetic selective-amplification effect are not “classical speech areas,” although some have been previously implicated in higher-order aspects of speech perception. Activation was found in the right cerebellum (Figure 4B), consistent with the results of Ackermann and colleagues (Mathiak et al., 2002Mathiak K. Hertrich I. Grodd W. Ackermann H. Cerebellum and speech perception: a functional magnetic resonance imaging study.J. Cogn. Neurosci. 2002; 14: 902-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), who found that a nearby right cerebellar locus was sensitive to differences in voice onset time, as opposed to the /ba/-/da/ contrast based on place of articulation. The anterior cingulate cortex also showed the phonetic-adaptation release effect (Figure 4C). This activity may correspond to attentional alerting to sounds crossing the perceptual category boundary (Benedict et al., 2002Benedict R.H. Shucard D.W. Santa Maria M.P. Shucard J.L. Abara J.P. Coad M.L. Wack D. Sawusch J. Lockwood A. Covert auditory attention generates activation in the rostral/dorsal anterior cingulate cortex.J. Cogn. Neurosci. 2002; 14: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We also found a large activation cluster in the left posterior parietal cortex (Figure 4D), extending down the intraparietal sulcus. The more inferior part of this activation cluster is close to a left parietal/supramarginal area reported by Celsis et al., 1999Celsis P. Boulanouar K. Doyon B. Ranjeva J. Berry I. Nespoulous J. Chollet F. Differential fMRI responses in the left posterior superior temporal gyrus and left supramarginal gyrus to habituation and change detection in syllables and tones.Neuroimage. 1999; 9: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar to be sensitive to phonetic change. Other areas that we found to treat sounds as the same or different depending upon whether they crossed the perceptual category boundary were the left middle frontal cortex (Figure 4E) and the right prefrontal cortex (Figure 4F). By looking for regions that neurally amplify stimulus differences crossing the category boundary, it is possible, we have argued, to identify brain areas that are carrying out categorical processing. A simpler question is whether these regions respond more to the three-step pairs that are perceived as different than to the three-step pairs that are perceived as the same, i.e., whether these regions respond more to across-category than to within-category pairs. Such a pattern of responses would be expected from categorically processing regions, although it would not in itself be sufficient evidence that categorical processing is taking place, as it does not distinguish between activation due to a stimulus pair's crossing of the category boundary and activation elicited individually by the separate phonemes that together make up the pair. Nonetheless, the comparison is one worth making, as a “reality check” that our six categorically processing regions are behaving as they would be expected to. The relevant data, verifying that the expected behavior does indeed take place, is shown in Figure S1 of the Supplemental Data available with this article online. Having found these categorically processing regions, we wished to ask how their phonetic representations were structured, and to probe in more detail how they related to perception. In particular, we investigated how the continuum of individual stimulus types from /ba/ to /da/ was represented, the pattern of how stimulus changes along that continuum were amplified or suppressed, and the relation between this neural activity and people's perceptual discrimination. To that end, we derived “neurometric curves,” plotting how neural activity varies as a function of position along the stimulus continuum, and compared them to subjects' psychometric curves, measured behaviorally. We derived two types of neurometric curves: “position curves,” plotting the responses to stimuli at individual locations along the continuum, and “contrast-response” curves, plotting the responses to pairs of stimuli that were three steps apart. The neurometric curves for the six categorically processing areas are shown in Figure 4. Note that these curves plot the actual BOLD responses, without any behavioral weighting. A challenge in relating neurometric curves from multiple subjects to behavior is the fact that a given physical stimulus can be perceived differently by different people. Although, as Figure 1 shows, the /ba/-/da/ crossover points and same-different peaks showed fairly high consistency across subjects, one person's /ba/ nearer the to center of the continuum can be another person's /da/. Thus, in order to average like with like, each individual's neurometric curve was plotted as a function of stimulus position with respect to each subject's behavioral threshold, and it was these perceptually aligned curves that were averaged across subjects. Thus, for the neurometric curve of “position responses” to the identical-stimulus pairs located at different positions along the /ba/-/da/ continuum (1&1, 2&2, etc.), each subject's neurometric curve was aligned with respect to the position on the continuum at which that individual behaviorally crossed over from perceiving /ba/ to perceiving /da/. Therefore, the “0” point on the x axis for these curves is the phonetic category boundary for every individual subject. The negative x axis values to the left are the /ba/ sounds, becoming progressively perceptually purer as they move away from the category boundary, and the positive x axis values to the right are the /da/ sounds. Thus, a V-shaped curve indicates that an area responds weakly to stimuli near the category boundary and strongly to phonetically purer stimuli at the category centers. For the neurometric curve of “contrast responses” to three-step pairs (1&4, 9&6, etc.), the curves were aligned with respect to the peak of each subject's behavioral same-different curve, so that the “0” point again corresponds to the phonetic category boundary. Here, an inverted-V shape indicates that an area responds strongly to stimulus pairs that straddle the category boundary, and which are hence perceived as different, and that the area responds weakly to stimuli that are perceived as the same. A key aspect of the categorically processing areas' neurometric curves, as seen in Figure 4, is that they respond very weakly to individual stimulus types near the category boundary, but nonetheless respond strongly to contrasting pairs made out of those same stimuli. For example, in Figure 4A, the left supramarginal gyrus averages a response close to zero for pairs of identical stimuli near to each subject's category boundary (the x axis zero in the blue curve of “position-responses” to identical pairs). However, the three-step pairs that straddle the category boundary are constructed out of exactly these stimuli drawn from near the middle of the continuum, yet they elicit the strongest responses (as shown by the sharp peak at the category boundary in the red “contrast-response” curve). The neurometric curves thus graphically illustrate the fact that large neural responses to behaviorally important stimulus differences are amplified out of much smaller responses to their constituent subparts. The converse pattern also holds true: many of the areas, again most notably the left supramarginal gyrus, respond strongly to individual stimulus types at the ends of the /ba/-/da/ continuum. However, contrasting three-step pairs made out of these phonemes induce only weak neural responses (the low activity at the far left and far right ends of the red “contrast-response” curves), even though the pairs are made out of stimuli that induce strong responses indi"

Genome-wide RNAi screening in Caenorhabditis elegans.Methods. 2003; 30: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar) and gene knockout methods (Liu et al., 1999Liu L.X. Spoerke J.M. Mulligan E.L. Chen J. Reardon B. Westlund B. Sun L. Abel K. Armstrong B. Hardiman G. et al.High-throughput isolation of Caenorhabditis elegans deletion mutants.Genome Res. 1999; 9: 859-867Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar) in C. elegans have allowed rapid reverse genetic analysis of known genes and identification of novel genes that function in synaptic transmission and modulation (Deken et al., 2005Deken S.L. Vincent R. Hadwiger G. Liu Q. Wang Z.W. Nonet M.L. Redundant localization mechanisms of RIM and ELKS in Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5975-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, Sieburth et al., 2005Sieburth D. Ch'ng Q. Dybbs M. Tavazoie M. Kennedy S. Wang D. Dupuy D. Rual J.F. Hill D.E. Vidal M. et al.Systematic analysis of genes required for synapse structure and function.Nature. 2005; 436: 510-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In-depth functional analysis of C. elegans mutants, combined with comparative studies in other model organisms such as Drosophila and mouse, will ultimately lead to a full understanding of the molecular events that control neurosecretion. Neuropeptides are packed into dense core vesicles (DCVs) and play critical roles in synaptic signaling. The many differences in the properties of DCVs and synaptic vesicles (SVs) suggest that these two classes of secretory organelles employ different molecules during secretion. Relatively little is known, however, about the factors that differentially participate in SV and DCV release. Ca2+-dependent activator protein for secretion (CAPS) was proposed to function specifically in DCV exocytosis (Walent et al., 1992Walent J.H. Porter B.W. Martin T.F. A novel 145 kd brain cytosolic protein reconstitutes Ca2+-regulated secretion in permeable neuroendocrine cells.Cell. 1992; 70: 765-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, a genetic study in mouse chromaffin cells suggests an unpredicted function for CAPS1 in regulating the uptake or storage of monoamines in DCVs (Speidel et al., 2005Speidel D. Bruederle C.E. Enk C. Voets T. Varoqueaux F. Reim K. Becherer U. Fornai F. Ruggieri S. Holighaus Y. et al.CAPS1 regulates catecholamine loading of large dense-core vesicles.Neuron. 2005; 46: 75-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, the exact role of CAPS1 cannot be directly inferred in the presence of the redundant CAPS2. In C. elegans, in which a single gene (unc-31) encodes the ortholog of mammalian CAPS, recent studies have revealed a remarkable reduction in peptide release but not in SV recycling (Sieburth et al., 2007Sieburth D. Madison J.M. Kaplan J.M. PKC-1 regulates secretion of neuropeptides.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, Speese et al., 2007Speese S. Petrie M. Schuske K. Ailion M. Ann K. Iwasaki K. Jorgensen E.M. Martin T.F. UNC-31 (CAPS) is required for dense-core vesicle but not synaptic vesicle exocytosis in Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 6150-6162Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Despite the controversy over the role(s) of CAPS in vesicular exocytosis, the challenge remains to elucidate where and how CAPS acts in DCV exocytosis. Vesicular exocytosis is subject to regulation by various second messenger pathways, e.g., PKA, PKC, diacylglycerol (DAG) and its analogs, the phorbol esters, which have been shown to enhance the readily releasable pool (RRP) of both SVs and DCVs in various cell types (Chen and Regehr, 1997Chen C. Regehr W.G. The mechanism of cAMP-mediated enhancement at a cerebellar synapse.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8687-8694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Gillis et al., 1996Gillis K.D. Mossner R. Neher E.

Phorbol esters potentiate evoked and spontaneous release by different presynaptic mechanisms.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7863-7870Crossref Google Scholar). Although an array of exocytotic proteins have been identified in vitro as targets for these regulatory mechanisms, conclusive tests of these hypotheses in vivo with the aid of genetic manipulations are still necessary. As an example, the employment of Munc13-1 knockout mice has identified Munc13 proteins, in parallel to PKC, as major targets of DAG in neurotransmitter and peptide hormone release (Kang et al., 2006Kang L. He Z. Xu P. Fan J. Betz A. Brose N. Xu T.

Interestingly, activating the Gαs pathway, which turns on cAMP and PKA, restored the paralysis phenotype in the unc-31 null mutant to hyperactive, coordinated locomotion (Charlie et al., 2006Charlie N.K. Schade M.A. Thomure A.M. Miller K.G. Presynaptic UNC-31 (CAPS) is required to activate the Gas pathway of the Caenorhabditis elegans synaptic signaling network.Genetics. 2006; 172: 943-961Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that UNC-31 acts upstream of the Gαs pathway via regulation of DCV exocytosis. Little is known, however, of how Gαs activation rescues the uncoordinated phenotype in the absence of UNC-31. Conclusive testing of various hypotheses in DCV exocytosis will greatly benefit from the fast genetics of C. elegans. An obstacle in this promising direction is the lack of suitable functional assays for DCV exocytosis in C. elegans. One recent piece of progress is the ability of quantifying GFP-labeled peptide release by its endocytic accumulation in coelomocyte cells (Sieburth et al., 2007Sieburth D. Madison J.M. Kaplan J.M. PKC-1 regulates secretion of neuropeptides.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, Speese et al., 2007Speese S. Petrie M. Schuske K. Ailion M. Ann K. Iwasaki K. Jorgensen E.M. Martin T.F. UNC-31 (CAPS) is required for dense-core vesicle but not synaptic vesicle exocytosis in Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 6150-6162Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). This method, however, does not provide the resolution to distinguish multiple stages of DCV trafficking along the exocytotic pathway. Hence, it is desirable to develop direct assays to monitor the release process at high resolution. Only with these tools can the power of genetic manipulation in C. elegans model systems be fully exploited to decipher the complex network that regulates DCV exocytosis and endocytosis. The small size of most somatic worm cells makes high-resolution cellular assays technically challenging. Electrophysiological analysis has been applied to only limited numbers of neurons and muscle cells in C. elegans (Francis and Maricq, 2006Francis M.M. Maricq A.V. Electrophysiological analysis of neuronal and muscle function in C. elegans.Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 351: 175-192Google Scholar, Goodman et al., 1998Goodman M.B. Hall D.H. Avery L. Lockery S.R. Active currents regulate sensitivity and dynamic range in C. elegans neurons.Neuron. 1998; 20: 763-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Direct monitoring of the release process using high resolution membrane capacitance (Cm) and optical measurements has not been performed in C. elegans cells. We describe here the first attempt to apply these methods to monitor exocytosis and endocytosis in primary cultured C. elegans neurons. The identity of the recorded cells is assured by cell-specific GFP reporters. We performed Cm measurement combined with Ca2+-uncaging stimuli to monitor both the amplitudes and the kinetics of exocytosis. The release kinetics of single vesicles was monitored using refined carbon fiber amperometry. Through employing total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM), we have been able to quantify the docking and fusion of single DCVs labeled with a DCV-specific GFP marker. Through a combination of these methods, we investigated the action site of UNC-31 in DCV exocytosis. Our results suggest that UNC-31 is required for the docking of DCVs and that PKA activation can abrogate this requirement for UNC-31. Furthermore, we demonstrate a functional interaction between UNC-31 and UNC-13 in augmenting DCV exocytosis. The development of primary cultures of C. elegans embryonic cells has paved the path to access individual somatic cells (Christensen et al., 2002Christensen M. Estevez A. Yin X. Fox R. Morrison R. McDonnell M. Gleason C. Miller 3rd, D.M. Strange K. A primary culture system for functional analysis of C. elegans neurons and muscle cells.Neuron. 2002; 33: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Cultured cells are readily accessible for patch clamp studies. Due to the relatively small size of worm cells, whole-cell patch clamp recording has so far been limited to large cells, such as body muscle cells and intestine cells (Estevez et al., 2003Estevez A.Y. Roberts R.K. Strange K. Identification of store-independent and store-operated Ca2+ conductances in Caenorhabditis elegans intestinal epithelial cells.J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 207-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, Fawcett et al., 2006Fawcett G.L. Santi C.M. Butler A. Harris T. Covarrubias M. Salkoff L. Mutant analysis of the Shal (Kv4) voltage-gated fast transient K+ channel in Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30725-30735Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Our aim is to record exocytosis from small neurons using Cm measurements in whole-cell patch clamp mode. To ensure stable whole-cell patch clamp recording and to minimize the access resistance (Rs) of the patch pipette, we utilized the so-called “pressure polishing” method to make high cone angle pipettes with submicron tip openings and resistances <4 MΩ (Goodman and Lockery, 2000Goodman M.B. Lockery S.R. Pressure polishing: a method for re-shaping patch pipettes during fire polishing.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2000; 100: 13-15Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We found that a low Rs (<20 MΩ) after break-in was critical to ensure proper voltage clamp and low noise capacitance recording. A low Rs was also necessary for dialyzing Ca2+ caging compounds and fluorescent Ca2+ indicators into the cells. The step-like [Ca2+]i increase generated by flash photolysis of caged-Ca2+ has been successfully used to measure both the amplitude and the kinetics of exocytosis (Sorensen, 2004Sorensen J.B. Formation, stabilisation and fusion of the readily releasable pool of secretory vesicles.Pflugers Arch. 2004; 448: 347-362Crossref Google Scholar, Xu et al., 1998Xu T. Binz T. Niemann H. Neher E. Multiple kinetic components of exocytosis distinguished by neurotoxin sensitivity.Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 192-200Crossref Scopus (285) Google Scholar). To make sure of the type of cells being recorded, we made primary cultures from the available transgenic lines in which specific cell types are marked by GFP expression driven by cell-specific promoters. The tph-1::GFP reporter is expressed in serotonergic neurons, including NSMs, ADFs, and HSN (Sze et al., 2000Sze J.Y. Victor M. Loer C. Shi Y. Ruvkun G. Food and metabolic signalling defects in a Caenorhabditis elegans serotonin-synthesis mutant.Nature. 2000; 403: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). We observed that GFP fluorescence was much brighter in NSM neurons than in the other cell types of strain GR1366, which expresses tph-1::GFP. We restricted our recording to brightly fluorescent cells prepared from strain GR1366. The GFP-expressing neurons selected for recording had a diameter of 3–4 μm, as shown in Figure 1A. Pressure-polished patch pipettes (Figure 1A) normally had a resistance of 2–4 MΩ, and after forming whole-cell configuration, the Rs averaged 12.2 ± 0.57 MΩ (n = 37). Under these conditions, the whole-cell recording was stable for ∼10 min, and we could observe the dialysis of a fluorescent indicator (furaptra) into the cytosol by monitoring the fluorescence increase. As shown in the Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online, both outwardly rectifying K+ currents and high-voltage-activated inward currents could be recorded from these cells. The averaged resting Cm of tph-1::GFP-expressing neurons was 0.57 ± 0.03 pF (n = 37 cells), consistent with the small size of these cells. Following flash photolysis, which evoked a step-like [Ca2+]i elevation to several tens of μM, the Cm trace increased rapidly, with an initial burst followed by a slow, sustained component (Figure 1B), similar to what has been reported in other mammalian cell types (Voets, 2000Voets T. Dissection of three Ca2+-dependent steps leading to secretion in chromaffin cells from mouse adrenal slices.Neuron. 2000; 28: 537-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (189) Google Scholar, Xu et al., 1998Xu T. Binz T. Niemann H. Neher E. Multiple kinetic components of exocytosis distinguished by neurotoxin sensitivity.Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 192-200Crossref Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Different kinetic components of the Cm trace are usually interpreted as release from discrete vesicle pools (Sorensen, 2004Sorensen J.B. Formation, stabilisation and fusion of the readily releasable pool of secretory vesicles.Pflugers Arch. 2004; 448: 347-362Crossref Google Scholar). Analogous to mammalian cells, we interpret the burst component as exocytosis from a fusion-competent or RRP of vesicles, whereas we interpret the sustained linear increase as recruitment from a reserve pool to the RRP. The amplitude of the burst component was as small as ∼10 fF, corresponding to ∼354 vesicles based on an average vesicle size of 30 nm in diameter (Nonet et al., 1999Nonet M.L. Holgado A.M. Brewer F. Serpe C.J. Norbeck B.A. Holleran J. Wei L. Hartwieg E. Jorgensen E.M. Alfonso A. UNC-11, a Caenorhabditis elegans AP180 homologue, regulates the size and protein composition of synaptic vesicles.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2343-2360Crossref Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and a specific membrane capacitance of 10 fF/μm2 (Cole, 1968Cole K.S. Membranes, Ions and Impulses. University of California Press, Berkeley, CA1968Google Scholar). Next, we tried to record GFP-labeled neurons cultured from transgenic worms expressing IDA-1::GFP. ida-1 encodes the C. elegans homolog of insulinoma-associated protein 2 (IA-2). IDA-1/CeIA-2 has been suggested to associate with the membranes of DCVs in neural and endocrine-specific cells (Cai et al., 2004Cai T. Fukushige T. Notkins A.L. Krause M. Insulinoma-associated protein IA-2, a vesicle transmembrane protein, genetically interacts with UNC-31/CAPS and affects neurosecretion in Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 3115-3124Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). IDA-1::GFP expression is strongest in ALA neurons, although it can also be detected in additional neurons. We selected large IDA-1::GFP-labeled cells with bright fluorescence (mostly ALA neurons) for recording. These neurons had an averaged resting Cm of 0.66 ± 0.03 pF (n = 23 cells), slightly greater than in the aforementioned serotonin neurons. Interestingly, most of the IDA-1::GFP-labeled neurons exhibited endocytosis following the exocytotic burst in response to flash photolysis, as shown in Figure 1C. Ca2+ plays a pivotal role in triggering exocytosis. Direct measurements of the relationship between the rate of exocytosis and the concentration of Ca2+ near release sites in a variety of neurons and endocrine cells have suggested a third- or fourth-order cooperative nature for Ca2+-dependent exocytosis (Beutner et al., 2001Beutner D.

Dissection of three Ca2+-dependent steps leading to secretion in chromaffin cells from mouse adrenal slices.Neuron. 2000; 28: 537-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (189) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the fourth- or higher order relationship between Ca2+ and exocytosis may be a unique feature of SV release, whereas DCV exocytosis exhibits a shallower dependence on Ca2+. We have compared the Ca2+-dependence of exocytosis from tph-1::GFP- and IDA-1::GFP-labeled neurons. We fitted the burst components with exponentials to obtain the rate constants and plotted the averaged rate constants against averaged post-flash [Ca2+]i levels, as shown in Figure 1D. Interestingly, exocytosis from tph-1::GFP-expressing neurons displays a higher-order [Ca2+]i-dependence than that from IDA-1::GFP-labeled neurons. The [Ca2+]i-dependence of exocytosis from tph-1::GFP- and IDA-1::GFP-labeled neurons can be best fitted with four-step and a three-step Ca2+-binding models (Yang et al., 2005Yang H. Liu H. Hu Z. Zhu H. Xu T. PKC-induced sensitization of Ca2+-dependent exocytosis is mediated by reducing the Ca2+ cooperativity in pituitary gonadotropes.J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 125: 327-334Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar), respectively, suggesting that exocytosis from these two types of neurons is composed of two different vesicles with different Ca2+-binding properties during triggering. Taken together, the above results demonstrate that worm cells are amenable to whole-cell Cm recording and that the highly cooperative nature of Ca2+-triggered exocytosis is conserved in C. elegans. Recent studies have suggested that UNC-31 is required for the release of neuropeptides (Sieburth et al., 2007Sieburth D. Madison J.M. Kaplan J.M. PKC-1 regulates secretion of neuropeptides.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, Speese et al., 2007Speese S. Petrie M. Schuske K. Ailion M. Ann K. Iwasaki K. Jorgensen E.M. Martin T.F. UNC-31 (CAPS) is required for dense-core vesicle but not synaptic vesicle exocytosis in Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 6150-6162Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). However, the exact sites of UNC-31 action remain to be demonstrated. With the development of Cm recording in worm neurons, it is now possible to directly assess the impact of losing UNC-31 on exocytosis. We carried out Cm recording from IDA-1::GFP-labeled ALA neurons because IDA-1 is a specific DCV marker (Cai et al., 2004Cai T. Fukushige T. Notkins A.L. Krause M. Insulinoma-associated protein IA-2, a vesicle transmembrane protein, genetically interacts with UNC-31/CAPS and affects neurosecretion in Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 3115-3124Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Flash photolysis in these cells evoked an averaged RRP size (measured from the amplitude of the exocytotic burst component) of 13.4 ± 1.5 fF (n = 23), as shown in Figure 2A. We crossed the ida-1::gfp transgene into the unc-31 null (e928) background. In Figure 2A, we compared the averaged Cm traces recorded from wild-type and unc-31(e928) ALA neurons in response to similar step-like [Ca2+]i elevations. The RRP size was significantly reduced to 5.9 ± 1.1 fF (n = 25) in unc-31 null mutant cells, demonstrating a reduction of 56%. To further validate whether the Ca2+-dependent Cm increase represents bona fide vesicular exocytosis, we tested whether genetic ablation of essential genes for exocytosis could abolish the Cm response. The unc-18 gene is absolutely required for the docking and priming of secretory vesicles (Weimer et al., 2003Weimer R.M. Richmond J.E. Davis W.S. Hadwiger G. Nonet M.L. Jorgensen E.M. Defects in synaptic vesicle docking in unc-18 mutants.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 1023-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Ablation of the unc-18 gene severely abolished the evoked Cm response, resulting in an ∼85% reduction in the RRP size. The endocytic Cm decay following the burst component was also completely obliterated. It was also important to test whether SNARE proteins that typically participate in DCV exocytosis are involved. For this purpose, we recorded the Cm response in the unc-64(e246) background. The C. elegans unc-64 gene encodes a syntaxin homolog with strong similarity to rat syntaxin 1, a plasma membrane SNARE protein that is essential for DCV exocytosis (Ohara-Imaizumi et al., 2007Ohara-Imaizumi M. Fujiwara T. Nakamichi Y. Okamura T. Akimoto Y. Kawai J. Matsushima S. Kawakami H. Watanabe T. Akagawa K. Nagamatsu S. Imaging analysis reveals mechanistic differences between first- and second-phase insulin exocytosis.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 695-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 2A, the RRP size was largely reduced by 70% (n = 17) in unc-64(e246) mutant ALA neurons. The remaining Cm signal could be due to the non-null mutation of the e246 allele (Saifee et al., 1998Saifee O. Wei L. Nonet M.L. The Caenorhabditis elegans unc-64 locus encodes a syntaxin that interacts genetically with synaptobrevin.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1235-1252Crossref Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Lysosomes are implicated to undergo Ca2+-triggered exocytosis, a process in which SNAP-23 is involved (Rao et al., 2004Rao S.K. Huynh C. Proux-Gillardeaux V. Galli T. Andrews N.W. Identification of SNAREs involved in synaptotagmin VII-regulated lysosomal exocytosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20471-20479Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The Cm response was not affected by ablation of the tag-81 gene, the C. elegans SNAP-23 homolog, suggesting that SNAP-23-mediated exocytosis does not contribute to the total Cm response from IDA-1::GFP-labeled ALA neurons (see inset of Figure 2A). Munc13 s/UNC-13 is essential for the priming of SVs, and the lack of Munc13-1/UNC-13 causes complete loss of fusion-competent SVs (Augustin et al., 1999Augustin I. Rosenmund C. Sudhof T.C. Brose N. Munc13–1 is essential for fusion competence of glutamatergic synaptic vesicles.Nature. 1999; 400: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, Richmond et al., 1999Richmond J.E. Davis W.S. Jorgensen E.M. UNC-13 is required for synaptic vesicle fusion in C. elegans.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 959-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). To demonstrate the requirement of UNC-13 for DCV exocytosis, we characterized exocytosis in ALA neurons of unc-13 mutants. Two major isoforms, which are named LR and MR according to their domain structures, are encoded by the unc-13 gene (Richmond et al., 1999Richmond J.E. Davis W.S. Jorgensen E.M. UNC-13 is required for synaptic vesicle fusion in C. elegans.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 959-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The e51 mutation represents a null allele of the LR isoform; the s69 mutation is a null mutation in both the LR and MR isoforms. Figure 2B compares the averaged Cm responses recorded from ALA neurons isolated from wild-type (n = 23) and two unc-13 mutant (e51 and s69) worms. In contrast to the unc-31 mutant, both unc-13 mutations exert no impact on the RRP size. Interestingly, Cm response after the exocytotic burst is reduced in the unc-13(s69) mutant. Because the Cm response represents the balance between exocytosis and endocytosis, the slow sustained component is probably masked by the fast endocytosis after the exocytotic burst. It is thus likely that the reduction in the overall Cm response after the exocytotic burst is due to inhibition of the sustained component by the unc-13(s69) mutation. The increased inhibition in the s69 mutation than in the e51 mutation correlates with the more severe behavioral defects seen in s69 mutant worms, suggesting that the MR isoform could be partially functional in the sustained component. This interpretation is in consistent with our previous finding that Munc13-1 is required for the sustained component but not for the maintenance of RRP (Kang et al., 2006Kang L. He Z. Xu P. Fan J. Betz A. Brose N. Xu T. Munc13-1 is required for the sustained release of insulin from pancreatic beta cells.Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 463-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To determine whether UNC-31 acts in the final fusion process, we compared the kinetics of the exocytotic burst at similar post-flash [Ca2+]i levels. As summarized in Figure S2, the time courses and the averaged rate constants of the burst component are not significantly different between cells with different genetic backgrounds. These results suggest UNC-31 is unlikely to be involved in the final Ca2+-triggering reaction. Important processes such as transmitter loading and fusion pore dynamics can be assessed by amperometry (Chow et al., 1992Chow R.H. von Ruden L. Neher E.

https://openalex.org/W2155254399,"Based on recent evidence that fatty acid synthase and endogenously produced fatty acid derivatives are required for adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we conducted a small interfering RNA-based screen to identify other fatty acid-metabolizing enzymes that may mediate this effect. Of 24 enzymes screened, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 2 (SCD2) was found to be uniquely and absolutely required for adipogenesis. Remarkably, SCD2 also controls the maintenance of adipocyte-specific gene expression in fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, including the expression of SCD1. Despite the high sequence similarity between SCD2 and SCD1, silencing of SCD1 did not down-regulate 3T3-L1 cell differentiation or gene expression. SCD2 mRNA expression was also uniquely elevated 44-fold in adipose tissue upon feeding mice a high fat diet, whereas SCD1 showed little response. The inhibition of adipogenesis caused by SCD2 depletion was associated with a decrease in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) mRNA and protein, whereas in mature adipocytes loss of SCD2 diminished PPARγ protein levels, with little change in mRNA levels. In the latter case, SCD2 depletion did not change the degradation rate of PPARγ protein but decreased the metabolic labeling of PPARγ protein using [35S]methionine/cysteine, indicating protein translation was decreased. This requirement of SCD2 for optimal protein synthesis in fully differentiated adipocytes was verified by polysome profile analysis, where a shift in the mRNA to monosomes was apparent in response to SCD2 silencing. These results reveal that SCD2 is required for the induction and maintenance of PPARγ protein levels and adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells. Based on recent evidence that fatty acid synthase and endogenously produced fatty acid derivatives are required for adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we conducted a small interfering RNA-based screen to identify other fatty acid-metabolizing enzymes that may mediate this effect. Of 24 enzymes screened, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 2 (SCD2) was found to be uniquely and absolutely required for adipogenesis. Remarkably, SCD2 also controls the maintenance of adipocyte-specific gene expression in fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, including the expression of SCD1. Despite the high sequence similarity between SCD2 and SCD1, silencing of SCD1 did not down-regulate 3T3-L1 cell differentiation or gene expression.

The ability of adipocytes to sense and respond to circulating fatty acid levels is important in maintaining the proper balance between fatty acid storage and fatty acid release for energy utilization. In the case of energy excess, fatty acids are stored in the form of triglyceride, and new adipocytes are generated to efficiently metabolize amino acids, glucose, and fatty acids to triglyceride (1Kintscher U.

Cultured mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes are an excellent model system for the study of adipogenesis. These cells differentiate into adipocytes with multilocular lipid droplets through a transcriptional cascade beginning with the rapid and transient expression of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ (3Rosen E.D.

The up-regulation of these transcription factors precedes the expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα, which are critical for the completion of adipogenesis as well as the maintenance of adipocyte-specific gene expression in fully differentiated cells (3Rosen E.D.

However, because PPARγ controls the expression of large sets of genes required to maintain the adipocyte phenotype, including C/EBPα itself, a loss in the activity or expression of PPARγ leads to a loss in adipocyte function (7Tamori Y.

In addition, it appears that differentiating adipocytes can fully synthesize a PPARγ ligand, since preadipocytes will differentiate and produce a PPARγ ligand in the absence of exogenous fatty acids (14Tzameli I.

Furthermore, overexpression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP1) in adipocytes apparently increases ligand production (19Kim J.B. Wright H.M. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4333-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar), whereas inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) (20Levert K.L. Waldrop G.L. Stephens J.M. J. Biol.

Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 1073-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) inhibits adipogenesis. SREBP1 is a transcription factor that controls the expression of many fatty acid metabolizing enzymes, including ACC and FAS. Because ACC and FAS work sequentially to produce palmitate, it is possible that sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 promotes PPARγ ligand production through a pathway involving ACC and FAS. Although there may be several explanations for the requirement of SREBP1, ACC, or FAS for adipogenesis apart from PPARγ ligand production, these studies do support the notion that endogenously synthesized fatty acids are required for adipogenesis. Because adipocytes express multiple fatty acid-metabolizing enzymes, these cells apparently produce highly diverse lipid species that may affect cellular signaling events, including PPARγ activation. Thus, the aim of the present study was to identify enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis or metabolism that may mediate such signaling pathways through their fatty acid products. To achieve this goal, we set up a screen in which 24 fatty acid-metabolizing enzymes were individually depleted using siRNA oligonucleotides to identify enzymes that are required for adipocyte-specific gene expression. Through this siRNA screen, we identified the fatty acid Δ9-desaturase, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 2 (SCD2), as a required enzyme for 3T3-L1 cell adipogenesis and for the maintenance of adipocyte-specific gene expression in fully differentiated cells. Importantly, SCD2 was found to be required for PPARγ induction during differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells and for PPARγ expression in fully differentiated adipocytes. Related to this latter effect, SCD2 expression was found to promote protein translation, secondarily affecting PPARγ protein levels. Surprisingly, although SCD1 and SCD2 exhibit high sequence similarity, are both expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum of the adipocyte, and are predicted to produce the same products, SCD1 depletion failed to attenuate PPARγ expression or adipogenesis. Therefore, these results identify SCD2 as a key regulator of adipocyte function by promoting PPARγ protein synthesis and reveal a novel and specific role for SCD2 versus SCD1 in the adipocyte.

Proprietary SMART-pool siRNA duplexes were used to target all other transcripts. Cell Culture and Electroporation—3T3-L1 fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 units/ml penicillin (22Jiang Z.Y.

For experiments performed during differentiation, fibroblasts were cultured for 7 days, and 5 × 106 cells were electroporated with 20 nmol of siRNA. The electroporation was performed using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II at the setting of 0.18 kV and 960 microfarads. Immediately after electroporation, the cells were reseeded into 2 wells of a 6-well plate. After 24 h, differentiation media consisting of 2.5 μg/ml insulin, 0.25 μm dexamethasone, and 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine in the culture media described above was added for 72 h in the absence or presence of 1 μm rosiglitazone. After 72 h, differentiation media was replaced with culture media for an additional 24 h, and then RNA or protein was collected. For experiments in mature adipocytes, fibroblasts were cultured for 8 days, differentiated into mature adipocytes as described above, and cultured for an additional 7 days. Adipocytes were then electroporated (20 nmol of siRNA/5 × 106 cells) as described above. After electroporation, cells were reseeded into multiple-well plates, and RNA or protein was collected 4-72 h post-electroporation. Affymetrix Gene Chip Analysis—Total RNA was collected from day 10 adipocytes after 72 h of siRNA treatment or from preadipocyte fibroblasts, adipocytes, and primary fat tissue as described (23Wilson-Fritch L.

Immunoblotting—Cells were solubilized with lysis buffer containing 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 12.5 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Protein was quantified using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) and then resolved on a 8% SDS-PAGE gel, electrotransferred to nitrocellulose, blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin and 5% nonfat milk in TBST (0.05% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline), washed with TBST, and incubated with specific antibody at 4 °C overnight. The blots were then washed with TBST, and a horseradish peroxidase anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibody was applied. Proteins were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescent substrate kit (Amersham Biosciences), and immunoblot band intensities were quantified by scanning densitometry using Photoshop. Oil Red O Staining—Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 1 h at room temperature, washed 3 times with PBS, permeabilized with P-buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 1% fetal bovine serum, and 0.05% sodium azide) for 20 min, incubated with Oil Red O solution (5 mg/ml Oil Red O solid dissolved in isopropanol then diluted to a 60% working solution with double-distilled H20) for 30 min, washed 3 times with distilled water, and analyzed by light microscopy or visual inspection. [35S]Methionine/Cysteine Labeling and Immunoprecipitation of PPARγ—Seventy-two hours after electroporation of cells with siRNA, one 100-mm plate of cells was starved of methionine and cysteine for 2 h and then labeled with 500 μCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine for 4 h. Cells were then lysed in ice-cold buffer containing 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 12.5 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Total cell lysates of 1 mg of protein were immunoprecipitated overnight with 20 μg of mouse monoclonal antibody against PPARγ followed by incubation with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed 5 times with lysis buffer before boiling for 5 min in Laemmli buffer. Protein was then separated on an 8% SDS gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and exposed to a phosphor screen for 60 h. The screen was then visualized with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The nitrocellulose was then immunoblotted as described above using goat polyclonal antibody against PPARγ to detect the efficiency of the immunoprecipitation. Polysome Profile and Reverse Transcription-PCR—Polysome profiles were generated as described previously (26Nottrott S. Simard M.J. Richter J.D. Nat. Struct. Mol.

After 24 or 72 h, cycloheximide (Sigma) was added at a final concentration of 100 mg/ml for 10 min. Cells were then washed with PBS, trypsinized, pelleted, and resuspended in polysome buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2) containing 150 μg/ml cycloheximide and 100 units/ml RNasin (Promega). After determining the cell number in each sample, Triton X-100 was added to the cell suspension at a final concentration of 0.3% (v/v), and cells were passed through a 27-gauge needle 5 times to ensure lysis. The nuclei were then pelleted by centrifugation at 4 °C and 12,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was then layered on a linear 10-50% sucrose gradient in polysome buffer containing 10 μg/ml cycloheximide and 3.3 units/ml RNasin, and the gradients were centrifuged in a Beckmann SW41Ti Rotor at 141,000 × g at 4 °C for 4 h. The gradients were fractionated into 1-ml fractions, and the UV absorption at A254 was recorded. Twelve fractions were collected, and RNA was then extracted from each fraction using TRIzol (Invitrogen). Equal volumes of each fraction were then reverse-transcribed, and real time PCR was performed as already described (24Tang X. Guilherme A. Chakladar A. Powelka A.M. Konda S. Virbasius J.V.

Expression of Fatty Acid Metabolizing Enzymes in Cultured Adipocytes and Primary Adipose Tissue—To establish a siRNA-based screen of broad scope, we first identified key enzymes in the major pathways of fatty acid metabolism that are clearly expressed in both mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes and primary mouse adipose tissue. Fig. 1 illustrates eight pathways of fatty acid metabolism that were considered for our studies, which include ω-oxidation, β-oxidation, α-oxidation, elongation, desaturation, nitration, epoxygenation/hydroxylation, and isomerization. Identification of the enzymes shown in Fig. 1 was accomplished by Affymetrix GeneChip microarray analysis of samples obtained from 3T3-L1 preadipocytes versus 3T3-L1 adipocytes (6 days after initiation of differentiation) and from the adipose tissue of mice fed a normal diet versus a high fat diet for 16 weeks. Table 1 presents the list of specific genes we selected by this analysis, all of which were found to be significantly expressed in both model systems. Boldface shows values for -fold change in expression for genes that are significantly up-regulated or down-regulated in response to 3T3-L1 differentiation (Table 1). The values obtained for SCD1 and SCD2 are highlighted within the rectangle.TABLE 1Affymetrix Gene Chip analysis of fatty acid metabolizing enzymes in differentiating 3T3-L1 adipocytes and primary adipocytes from mice fed a normal chow or high fat diet Open table in a new tab The fatty acid-metabolizing enzymes shown in Table 1 and Fig. 1 allow the generation of many different fatty acid products and derivatives from the same initial fatty acid substrate. A saturated fatty acid such as palmitate may be 1) ω-oxidized by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP4f16, forming a dicarboxylic acid, 2) β-oxidized in peroxisomes by the acyl-CoA oxidases ACOX1 and ACOX2 or in the mitochondria by the acyl-CoA dehydrogenases ACADl and ACADvl, cleaving two carbons per cycle from the fatty acid, 3) α-oxidized in peroxisomes by phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase, cleaving one carbon per cycle from the fatty acid, 4) elongated by ELOVL1, ELOVL3, ELOVL5, and ELOVL6, which are present in the endoplasmic reticulum, adding two carbons per cycle to the fatty acid, or 5) desaturated by various enzymes found in the endoplasmic reticulum, including stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 or stearoyl-CoA desaturase 2, forming a cis double bond between the 9 and 10 carbons, or fatty acid desaturase 1, fatty acid desaturase 2, or fatty acid desaturase 3, forming a cis double bond between 5 and 6, 6 and 7, and possibly the 4 and 5 carbons, respectively. In addition, the double bond in an unsaturated fatty acid may change position through the isomerase, ALOXe3, found in the cytoplasm, be nitrated by nitric oxide species produced by nitric-oxide synthase, found in the cytoplasm, or be oxidized by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2f2, CYP2c55, CYP20a1, CYP26b1, CYP1b1, found in the endoplasmic reticulum, adding an epoxide, hydroxyl, or peroxyl group to the fatty acid. An epoxide may then be further metabolized by the epoxide hydrolase, EPHX1, present in the endoplasmic reticulum, or EPHX2, present in the cytoplasm, producing dihydrodiols. Additionally, these pathways can operate in tandem, changing the carbon length or position of a side group or double bond within the fatty acid. Because a fatty acid produced from any one of these pathways may affect cell signaling events or other processes, these enzymes listed in Table 1 were targeted in a siRNA-based screen to determine whether they affect adipocyte gene expression in 3T3-L1 cells. SCD2, but Not SCD1, Is Required for 3T3-L1 Adipogenesis—To identify fatty acid metabolizing enzymes that are required for 3T3-L1 adipogenesis, siRNA oligonucleotides directed against each of the enzymes identified by the microarray analysis in Table 1 were electroporated into 3T3-L1 preadipocytes before differentiation. Because PPARγ appears to be activated by an endogenous ligand during adipogenesis (8Camp H.S. Chaudhry A. Leff T.

Thus, in our screen the enzymes were also depleted in the presence of the PPARγ specific ligand, rosiglitazone, as a control. The initial screen monitored the mRNA transcript levels by real time PCR of the differentiation-induced proteins PPARγ and GLUT4 (Fig. 2). As expected, the well established required factors for adipocyte differentiation, PPARγ and FAS (21Schmid B. Rippmann J.F. Tadayyon M. Hamilton B.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 1073-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), did indeed attenuate PPARγ and GLUT4 expression in this screen when depleted by siRNA and acted as positive controls. In addition, rosiglitazone treatment did not restore PPARγ or GLUT4 levels upon siRNA-based depletion of PPARγ (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. 1). Importantly,"

To understand the carcinogenic mechanism of hepatitis B virus-encoded oncoprotein HBx, we explored the function of HBx interaction with its cellular target HBXIP. Previously, we demonstrated that viral HBx and cellular HBXIP control mitotic spindle formation, regulating centrosome splitting. By using various fragments of HBx, we determined that residues 137CRHK140 within HBx are necessary for binding HBXIP. Mutation of the 137CRHK140 motif in HBx abolished its ability to bind HBXIP and to dysregulate centrosome dynamics in HeLa and immortal diploid RPE-1 cells. Unlike wild-type HBx, which targets to centrosomes as determined by subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence microscopy, HBx mutants failed to localize to centrosomes. Overexpression of viral HBx wild-type protein and knockdown of endogenous HBXIP altered centrosome assembly and induced modifications of pericentrin and centrin-2, two essential proteins required for centrosome formation and function, whereas HBXIP nonbinding mutants of HBx did not. Overexpression of HBXIP or fragments of HBXIP that bind HBx neutralized the effects of viral HBx on centrosome dynamics and spindle formation. These results suggest that HBXIP is a critical target of viral HBx for promoting genetic instability through formation of defective spindles and subsequent aberrant chromosome segregation.

HBV is a small ∼3.4-kb DNA virus containing four partially overlapping open reading frames, encoding the C, S, and X proteins, and a viral DNA polymerase (1Birrer R.B. Birrer D. Klavins J.V. Ann. Clin. Lab. Sci. 2003; 33: 39-54PubMed Google Scholar). Among these four proteins, only the X protein (known as HBx) is clearly associated with tumorigenesis. Viral HBx is a multifunctional protein, which appears to dysregulate cell division and cell death through unclear mechanisms (reviewed in Ref. 4Murakami S. J. Gastroenterol. 2001; 36: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Although HBx lacks acute transforming activity, transgenic mice expressing HBx in the liver in susceptible strain backgrounds develop hepatocellular carcinoma (5Kim C-M. Koike K. Saito I. Miyamura T.

Mammalian HBXIP is a conserved ∼18-kDa protein of unknown function, which was originally identified because of its interaction with viral HBx (6Melegari M. Scaglioni P.P. Wands J.R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1737-1743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HBXIP sequences are well conserved among mammalian species, with close orthologs found in all vertebrate species where sequence data exist thus far. An overexpression of HBXIP suppresses HBV virus replication in HepG2 cells, in addition to suppressing the transactivation phenotype of HBx (6Melegari M. Scaglioni P.P. Wands J.R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1737-1743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HBXIP has been identified as an adaptor for Survivin, a BIR family chromosomal passenger protein involved in controlling apoptosis and cell division (7Adams R.R. Carmena M. Earnshaw W.C. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 49-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), with HBXIP collaborating with cytosolic Survivin to suppress apoptosis (8Marusawa H. Matsuzawa S. Welsh K. Zou H. Armstrong R. Tamm I. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2729-2740Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that HBXIP also plays a critical role in mitosis, particularly in centrosome duplication to form a bipolar spindle during prometaphase and in cytokinesis where replicating cells split to form two daughter cells at telophase (9Fujii R. Zhu C. Wen Y. Marusawa H. Bailly-Maitre B. Matsuzawa S. Zhang H. Kim Y. Bennett C.F. Jiang W. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 9099-9107Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In addition, we observed that antisense-mediated knockdown of HBXIP expression in vivo severely impaired liver regeneration, causing reduced cell replication and massive apoptosis (9Fujii R. Zhu C. Wen Y. Marusawa H. Bailly-Maitre B. Matsuzawa S. Zhang H. Kim Y. Bennett C.F. Jiang W. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 9099-9107Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Overexpressing HBXIP induced multipolar spindles in cultured cells, with excess production of centrosomes, whereas experimentally reducing HBXIP expression caused cell cycle arrest with monopolar spindles (9Fujii R. Zhu C. Wen Y. Marusawa H. Bailly-Maitre B. Matsuzawa S. Zhang H. Kim Y. Bennett C.F. Jiang W. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 9099-9107Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of HBx in cultured cells mimicked the effects of HBXIP overexpression, producing cells with multipolar spindles. Cytokinesis defects were also occasionally observed in HBx-expressing cells, mimicking HBXIP deficiency (9Fujii R. Zhu C. Wen Y. Marusawa H. Bailly-Maitre B. Matsuzawa S. Zhang H. Kim Y. Bennett C.F. Jiang W. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 9099-9107Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These recent findings have raised the possibility that interaction of viral HBx with HBXIP dysregulates the normal function of HBXIP during prometaphase, affecting centrosome replication or activity, leading to mitotic spindle defects and thus causing chromosome segregation defects, resulting in genetic instability (9Fujii R. Zhu C. Wen Y. Marusawa H. Bailly-Maitre B. Matsuzawa S. Zhang H. Kim Y. Bennett C.F. Jiang W. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 9099-9107Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Here we explored the molecular basis of HBx interaction with HBXIP performing a mutagenesis analysis to identify the domains within cellular HBXIP and viral HBx viral proteins required for their interactions. Noninteracting mutants of HBx were then used to test the hypothesis that binding to HBXIP is critical for the dysregulatory effects of HBx on mitotic spindle formation. Plasmids and RNAi Reagents—Full-length human HBXIP cDNA (GenBank™ accession number NM_006402) in pcDNA3 (8Marusawa H. Matsuzawa S. Welsh K. Zou H. Armstrong R. Tamm I. Reed J.C.

Various fragments of HBXIP cDNA were PCR-amplified from pGEX4T-1-HBXIP full-length plasmids. The gene encoding HBx was synthesized by PCR from DNA obtained from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (10Marusawa H. Uemoto S. Hijikata M. Ueda Y. Tanaka K. Shimatohno K. Chiba T. Hepatology. 2000; 31: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar).

The resulting products were subcloned into pcHA expression vector derived from pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Various fragments of pcHA-HBx cDNA were PCR-amplified from pcHA-HBx wild-type plasmid. The pEYFP-tubulin and pECFP-histone 2B plasmids have been described (11Zhu C. Zhao J. Bibikova M. Leverson J.D. Bossy-Wetzel E. Fan J.B. Abraham R.T. Jiang W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3187-3199Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). RNAi reagents targeting the coding regions of luciferase (538-983 bp) and HBXIP (GenBank™ accession number NM_006402; 522 bp) were synthesized by in vitro transcription of plasmids, as described previously (9Fujii R.

The plasmids encoding full-length p300 were provided by Neuveut and co-workers (12Cougot D. Wu Y. Cairo S. Caramel J. Renard C.A. Levy L. Buendia M.A. Neuveut C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4277-4287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The pCRE-Luc reporter containing four consensus CBP-responsive element sites and the plasmids encoding protein kinase A (PKA) were purchased from Stratagene. For secondary protein structure prediction, we employed the PSIPred tool (13McGuffin L.J. Bryson K. Jones D.T. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2000; 16: 404-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2633) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfections—HeLa cells and telomerase-immortalized human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE-1) cells (Clontech) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), seeded at 20,000 cells per well of 24-well dishes (6 mm diameter). Cells were transfected at 60-70% confluence with either 1 μl per well Lipofectamine 2000™ for plasmids or 1 μl of Oligofectamine for siRNA (Invitrogen), using 1.0 μg of total plasmid DNA (100 μm) or 1.0 μg of RNAi (40 μm). For cell cycle synchronization, HeLa CS cells were plated at a density of 2 × 106 cells in 100-mm2 tissue culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FBS. 24 h after co-transfection with plasmids encoding HA-tagged HBx (WT and AAAA or ADDD mutants) in combination with plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged HBXIP (FL and mutants), cell cycle synchronization was achieved by a thymidine/nocodazole double-block protocol. To obtain cells in the G2/M stage, cells were cultured in medium containing 2.5 mm thymidine for 16 h, washed with fresh medium three times, and released from the thymidine block for 6 h, and then incubated in medium containing 100 ng/ml nocodazole for another 16 h. Cells were collected, washed, and released from the second block by culturing in fresh normal medium overnight. Reporter Gene Assays—For transcription assays, HeLa cells, 5 × 105 cells in 96 wells, were transfected with various combinations of pFC-PKA (1.0 μg), plasmids encoding HBx WT or AAAA or ADDD mutants (1.5 μg), or p300 plasmids (1.5 μg) for 24 h, together with 1.0 μg of pCRE-Luc reporter plasmids (Stratagene) by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Luciferase activity was determined 24 h after transfection, and the results are the average of six independent repeats. Luciferase activities in cell lysates were measured by a dual luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega), and luciferase activity was normalized with firefly activity or Renilla luciferase activity. Preparation of GST and GST Fusion Proteins—Transformants of Escherichia coli BL21 carrying plasmid pGEX-4T-1 (containing GST) or derivatives containing various GST-HBXIP fusion proteins were cultured at 37 °C in LB medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin for 4-6 h until the absorbance at 600 nm reached ∼0.5. Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 1.0 mm and incubated at 24 °C for 2-3 h to induce the expression of GST and GST fusion proteins. Cells were harvested with CelLytic™ B cell lysis reagent (Sigma) with 0.1 mm PMSF, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 ml/10 ml (per volume) of protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). GST and GST fusion proteins were purified from bacterial extracts using glutathione-agarose beads as described previously (14Johnson J.C.S. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 20. Wiley Interscience, New York1996: 2.1-2.10Google Scholar), with the modification that after the protein-containing glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were washed, the proteins were eluted with elution buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 100 mm glutathione), dialyzed against buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and stored at -80 °C. In Vitro Transcription and Translation and GST Binding Assays—In vitro transcription and translation with 35S-labeled methionine were carried out by use of the TnT™ T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) according to the vendor's instructions. In vitro translated HBx WT and mutant viral proteins were incubated with the GST-HBXIP fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads The beads were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% SDS, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm PMSF, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 tablet of protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and resuspended in the same buffer. Then 15 μl (Fig. 1B, top panel) or 30 μl (Fig. 1B, bottom panel) of in vitro translated 35S-labeled HBx WT or mutant proteins prepared as described above for binding assays were added to beads (10-μl bed volume) containing 20 μg of bound GST fusion proteins, and the volume was increased to 200 μl with washing buffer. The mixtures were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h or overnight with thorough mixing. The beads were collected by brief centrifugation at 1,000 rpm, 4 °C for 5 min, washed three times with 800 μl of washing buffer, resuspended in 50 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (Invitrogen), and fractionated by SDS-PAGE. For detecting 35S-labeled proteins, the gels were fixed with destaining buffer (25% isopropyl alcohol and 10% acetic acid), treated with NAMP100 (Amersham Biosciences) for 15-30 min, and subjected to fluorography at -80 °C. The gels also were stained with Coomassie Blue to assess loading of each GST protein applied in each reaction. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy analysis of cells were performed after 48 h of transfection and stained as protocol described previously (9Fujii R. Zhu C. Wen Y. Marusawa H. Bailly-Maitre B. Matsuzawa S. Zhang H. Kim Y. Bennett C.F. Jiang W. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 9099-9107Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) with rabbit polyclonal anti-HBXIP (1:200 dilution, affinity-purified from the antiserum reported previously (8Marusawa H. Matsuzawa S. Welsh K. Zou H. Armstrong R. Tamm I. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2729-2740Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) using column-immobilized glutathione S-transferase/HBXIP-(83-173) fusion protein); mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin (clone B-5-1-2, 1:1000 dilution; Sigma); rabbit anti-pericentrin antiserum (1:2000 dilution; Abcam Inc.); and rat monoclonal anti-HA high affinity antibodies (1 μg/ml; Roche Applied Science) followed by 1:200 dilution of various fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch and Southern Biotech). Cell imaging was performed using a Zeiss Axiovert 100M microscope. Data acquisition for quantification of immunofluorescence channels was performed using Simple PCI version 6.2 image software system (Compix Inc.) and a Radiance 2100/AGR-3Q Bio-Rad multiphoton laser point scanning confocal microscope. Images were analyzed by MetaMorph/MetaFluor version 7.0. Time-lapse Microscopy—HeLa cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of pEYFP-α-tubulin and pECFP-Histone2B plasmids together with 200 nm of siRNAs using Oligofectamine™. Alternatively, cells were transfected with 50 ng of pEYFP-α-tubulin and pECFP-Histone2B plasmids together with 0.5 μg of HBx expression plasmid (HBx WT) (15Kanda T. Yokosuka O. Imazeki F. Yamada Y.

Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4524) Google Scholar) using Lipofectamine™ 2000. After 24 h, cells were cultured with CO2-independent medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS overnight. The dishes were then transferred to a heated stage (37 °C) on a Zeiss Axiovert 100M microscope and observed under a ×63 lens. Phase contrast and fluorescence images of live cells were collected at 1-min intervals for 7-10 h. Isolation of Centrosomes—Centrosomes were isolated from HeLa cells using an established protocol (17Mitchison T.J. Kirschner M.W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cells were grown in 10 150-mm plastic dishes until ∼60% confluent and then treated with nocodazole (0.1 μg/ml) for 12 h to enrich the population of metaphase cells. Mitotic cells were collected by a mitotic shake off procedure and incubated with nocodazole (10 μg/ml) and cytochalasin D (1 μg/ml) for 90 min to disrupt tubulin and actin cytoskeleton. Cells were lysed in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1% Triton X-100, proteinase inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 1 mm PMSF, 5 mm MgSO4, 5 mm EGTA, 1 μg/ml nocodazole, and 1 μg/ml cytochalasin D. Cell lysates were sedimented at 1500 × g to pellet the nuclei and cell fragments. The supernatant fraction was filtered through a nylon filter (40-μm pore size) and centrifuged on a 20% w/w Ficoll-400 cushion at 10,000 × g for 1 h. The crude centrosomal fraction (localized at the Ficoll-water interface) was collected, diluted 3-fold in cell lysis buffer, and further purified by a 20-70% sucrose gradient (1 ml each) centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The individual 1-ml fractions, including the centrosome fraction (at ∼55-60% sucrose), were collected, diluted 3-fold in cell lysis buffer, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm in a tabletop Eppendorf centrifuge to pellet the centrosomes. The collected samples were immediately subjected for SDS-PAGE separation. Monoclonal anti-γ-tubulin antibody was purchased as mouse IgG from Sigma. Anti-centrin-2 (S-19) affinity-purified goat polyclonal antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Molecular Basis of Interaction between HBx Viral Protein and HBXIP—To map the region within HBXIP required for binding viral HBx, we conducted in vitro protein binding assays with GST fusion proteins composed of full-length HBXIP or truncated mutants of HBXIP constructed with guidance from the predicted secondary structure of this cellular protein (18Jones D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (4342) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). These GST fusion proteins were tested for binding with in vitro translated 35S-labeled HBx. Full-length GST-HBXIP-(1-173) and N-terminal fragments composed of residues 1-99, 1-81, and 1-64 bound to HBx in vitro, thus suggesting that the N-terminal region of HBXIP is sufficient for HBx binding. In contrast, C-terminal and interior fragments of HBXIP comprising residues 23-99, 46-99, 82-144, and 82-163 failed to bind HBx viral (Fig. 1B). We reasoned that if HBXIP is the cellular target of HBx that is relevant to HBx-mediated spindle defects (9Fujii R. Zhu C. Wen Y. Marusawa H. Bailly-Maitre B. Matsuzawa S. Zhang H. Kim Y. Bennett C.F. Jiang W. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 9099-9107Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), then overexpression of HBXIP should neutralize HBx, as should fragments of HBXIP that bind HBx. To test this hypothesis, we transfected HeLa cells with HBx in combination with full-length HBXIP, a fragment of HBXIP composed of residues 1-64 that retains HBx binding activity, or a pcFLAG vector then determined the percentage of cells with aberrant spindles among mitotic cells. Expression of FLAG epitope-tagged HBXIP full-length and the HBXIP-(1-64) fragment were confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Fig. 1C). To test the effects of HBXIP and HBXIP-(1-64) on spindle formation, HeLa cells were fixed at 48 h after transfection with plasmids encoding HBx WT viral protein, in combination with FLAG-tagged HBXIP full-length FLAG-HBXIP-(1-64) fragment, or pcFLAG vector and stained with anti-α-tubulin (green) anti-pericentrin (red) antibodies, and with DNA-binding fluorochrome (DAPI). The percentages of cells with multipolar or unipolar or bipolar spindles were enumerated among mitotic cells, counting the number of centrosomes per cell (Fig. 1D). Untransfected control HeLa cells rarely demonstrated any spindle abnormalities (≥98% bipolar spindles (data not shown)). In contrast, cells transfected with HBx showed marked spindle abnormalities, with approximately one-third of prometaphase/metaphase cells having multipolar spindles with three or more centrosomes, as well as an increase in cells with unipolar spindles (Fig. 1D) consistent with previous reports (9Fujii R. Zhu C. Wen Y. Marusawa H. Bailly-Maitre B. Matsuzawa S. Zhang H. Kim Y. Bennett C.F. Jiang W. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 9099-9107Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 19Forgues M.

Co-expressing HBXIP full-length protein or the HBXIP-(1-64) fragment with HBx viral protein reduced the percentage of cells with abnormal spindles, thus confirming our predictions. By themselves, in the absence of HBx, overexpression of HBXIP or HBXIP-(1-64) induced ≈5% multipolar/unipolar spindles (data not shown), as published previously (9Fujii R. Zhu C. Wen Y. Marusawa H.

Representative images of cells are presented in Fig. 1E, showing an HBx-expressing cell with tripolar spindle and bipolar spindle in cells expressing HBx and in combination with HBXIP full-length or HBXIP-(1-64). Next we determined which residues within hepatitis X virus oncoprotein (HBx) are necessary for binding to HBXIP using the same approach. Using the predicted secondary structure (13McGuffin L.J.

Biol. 1999; 292: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (4342) Google Scholar) to guide construction of HBx truncation mutants (Fig. 2A), we compared full-length and truncated HBx proteins (Fig. 2B) for binding to HBXIP in vitro. For these experiments, in vitro protein-binding assays were performed with single-form GST fusions containing HBXIP full-length protein or the HBXIP N-terminal 1-64 fragment (Fig. 2C), testing binding to 35S-labeled full-length HBx and various C-terminal truncation mutants of HBx. As expected, the 35S-labeled full-length HBx protein bound to both GST-HBXIP-(1-173) and GST-HBXIP-(1-64) at levels greater than observed for GST control protein (Fig. 2D). Similarly, 35S-HBx-(1-140) maintained its binding activity. In contrast, 35S-HBx-(1-136), which has just four amino acids fewer than HBx-(1-140) displayed weak binding to GST-HBXIP (FL) and no binding to GST-HBXIP-(1-64), suggesting this portion of HBx makes important contributions to HBXIP binding. The HBx-(1-117) truncation mutant completely lost its ability to bind to either GST-HBXIP (FL) or GST-HBXIP-(1-64) (Fig. 2D). Because these results implicated the four residues corresponding to amino acids 137-140 in the interaction of HBx with HBXIP, we produced an alanine substitution mutant replacing 137CRHK140 with AAAA. Also, because the 137CRHK140 sequence is rich in basic amino acids, we generated a mutant containing acidic residue replacements, namely ADDD (Fig. 3A). In vitro protein binding assays demonstrated that the AAAA and ADDD mutants failed to bind GST-HBXIP or GST-HBXIP-(1-64) (Fig. 3B). To determine whether residues 137-140 are also important for HBx binding to HBXIP in cells, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments using transfected HeLa cells. Accordingly, cDNAs encoding HBx WT or mutant HBx proteins were subcloned into a mammalian expression plasmid with HA epitope tags and co-expressed in HeLa cells with GFP-tagged HBXIP. Immunoprecipitations were performed with either control mouse IgG or antibody directed against the HA-epitope tagged on HBx, and the immune complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting using anti-GFP to detect GFP-tagged HBXIP. These co-immunoprecipitation studies showed that only HA-HBx WT protein associated with GFP-HBXIP, but not the two HA-HBx mutants (Fig. 3C). Immunoblotting analysis of the lysates showed that all of the HBx variants were expressed at comparable levels in HeLa cells (see below), thus excluding a trivial explanation for the differential recovery of GFP-HBXIP with immunoprecipitates containing WT versus mutants of HBx. We therefore conclude that residues 137-140 of HBx are critical for interactions with HBXIP in vitro and in cells. Finally, we performed additional co-immunoprecipitation experiments using an alternative tag on HBXIP (FLAG instead of GFP) and synchronizing the cells in G2/M-phase to enrich for the phase of the cell cycle where HBXIP plays its intrinsic role in bipolar spindle formation (9Fujii R. Zhu C. Wen Y. Marusawa H. Bailly-Maitre B. Matsuzawa S. Zhang H. Kim Y. Bennett C.F. Jiang W. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 9099-9107Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Moreover, in addition to full-length HBXIP, the ability of HBx (wild type), HBx (ADDD), and HBx (AAAA) to bind the HBXIP-(1-64) N-terminal fragment and HBXIP-(64-173) C-terminal fragment was compared. Immunoprecipitation of wild-type HA-tagged HBx revealed the presence of associated full-length HBXIP and HBXIP-(1-64), but not HBXIP-(64-173) C-terminal fragment (Fig. 4). In contrast, the HBx (AAAA) and HBx (ADDD) proteins did not associate with HBXIP or HBXIP fragments. Immunoblotting analysis confirmed production of all HBx mutants and all HBXIP fragments (Fig. 4, A and B). Thus, the N-terminal 1-64 region of HBXIP is necessary and sufficient for binding HBx, and the 137CRHK140 motif of HBx is required for binding to the N-terminal domain of HBXIP. Abnormal Spindle Formation Induced by HBx Viral Protein Depends on the 137CRHK140 Motif—Previously we showed by RNAi experiments that HBXIP is essential for bipolar spindle formation in dividing HeLa cells and mouse embryo fibroblast cells (9Fujii R.

If the interaction of HBx with cellular HBXIP is important for the ability of HBx to disrupt normal centrosome dynamics and bipolar spindle formation, we predicted that the HBx mutants that fail to bind HBXIP would display a loss of function phenotype. To test this hypothesis, we exp"
https://openalex.org/W2103515555,"Due to fixational eye movements, the image on the retina is always in motion, even when one views a stationary scene. When an object moves within the scene, the corresponding patch of retina experiences a different motion trajectory than the surrounding region. Certain retinal ganglion cells respond selectively to this condition, when the motion in the cell's receptive field center is different from that in the surround. Here we show that this response is strongest at the very onset of differential motion, followed by gradual adaptation with a time course of several seconds. Different subregions of a ganglion cell's receptive field can adapt independently. The circuitry responsible for differential motion adaptation lies in the inner retina. Several candidate mechanisms were tested, and the adaptation most likely results from synaptic depression at the synapse from bipolar to ganglion cell. Similar circuit mechanisms may act more generally to emphasize novel features of a visual stimulus."

Taken together, these studies suggest a novel mechanism for flavonoid-induced cytoprotection in SH-SY5Y cells involving SREBP-2-mediated sterol synthesis that decreases lipid peroxidation by maintaining membrane integrity in the presence of oxidative stress. Cholesterol, phospholipids, and sphingolipids are major structural components of the eukaryotic plasma membrane that play an essential role in maintaining membrane integrity. In the hydrophobic region of the membrane bilayer, sterols fill the spaces created by the acyl chains of phospholipids, thereby conferring rigidity and decreasing permeability (1Yeagle P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 822: 267-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). The biological function of membrane proteins is influenced by cholesterol in a number of ways (2Yeagle P.L. Biochimie (Paris). 1991; 73: 1303-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Cholesterol levels can regulate the activity of enzymes involved in the biosynthetic pathway of this lipid and form membrane rafts that participate in signal transduction (3Incardona J.P. Eaton S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The importance of raft-associated cholesterol in cancer cell proliferation, migration, and cell survival has been well documented (4Zhuang L. Kim J. Adam R.M. Solomon K.R. Freeman M.R. J. Clin.

Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4566) Google Scholar). The synthesis and uptake of cholesterol are regulated by the transcription factors sterol regulatory element-binding proteins SREBPs (6Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3029) Google Scholar). Alternate splicing of SREBP-1 gives rise to SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c, which activates genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, whereas SREBP-2 activates genes critical to cholesterol synthesis (6Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3029) Google Scholar). SREBP-2 is synthesized as a 125-kDa precursor protein. When cholesterol levels are low, SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) escorts SREBP-2 from the endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi, where SREBP-2 is proteolytically cleaved by proteases into a mature form (65 kDa) that translocates to the nucleus and binds to the sterol regulatory element, triggering the transcription of genes necessary for cholesterol synthesis (7Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Cell. 2006; 124: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). If cholesterol levels exceed cellular demands, the SCAP·SREBP complex is sequestered in the endoplasmic reticulum by the insulin-induced gene product known as Insig-1 (8Yang T. Espenshade P.J.

Recently, plasma membrane compartments rich in cholesterol have been reported to participate in cell survival pathways that reduce the injurious oxidative stress (9Yang B. Oo T.N. Rizzo V.

Oxidative stress is a pathophysiological state that occurs when free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) exceed the ability of antioxidant small molecules and proteins to neutralize them (10Chance B. Sies H. Boveris A. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 527-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (4851) Google Scholar). Oxidative stress has been implicated in a number of pathological conditions (11Ames B.N. Science. 1983; 221: 1256-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar, 12Halliwell B. Haemostasis. 1993; 23: 118-126PubMed Google Scholar, 13Yagi K. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1987; 45: 337-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). The injurious events triggered by ROS are thought to include lipid peroxidation (14Girotti A.W. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1529-1542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ion channel modification, DNA damage, and protein oxidation (15Gutteridge J.M. Halliwell B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 899: 136-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Lipids are susceptible to oxidative damage because of their high degree of unsaturation and abundance in cell membranes. Neurons in the central nervous system are highly susceptible to oxidative stress due to their high rate of aerobic metabolism, presence of catalysts such as heavy metals that generate free radicals, excitotoxic amino acids, and low levels of antioxidants (16Montine K.S.

Hence, we used the neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells as an in vitro model to assess the effects of oxidative stress on a neuronal-like cell line. Oxidative stress generated by free radicals is counteracted by sophisticated antioxidant defense systems (19Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3226) Google Scholar, 20Sies H. Exp. Physiol. 1997; 82: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (2492) Google Scholar); however, the excessive production of ROS during pathological conditions may overwhelm endogenous antioxidant defenses resulting in tissue injury. Antioxidants derived from dietary sources have been shown to reduce oxidative tissue damage (21Youdim K.A. Spencer J.P. Schroeter H. Rice-Evans C. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 503-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Among the most potent dietary free radical scavengers identified to date are a class of polyphenolic compounds known as flavonoids found in wine, fruits, vegetables, and teas (21Youdim K.A. Spencer J.P. Schroeter H. Rice-Evans C. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 503-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Epidemiological data suggest that apple flavonoids reduce the risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disorders (22Boyer J. Liu R.H. Nutr. J. 2004; 3: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Quercetin and its glycoside derivatives are the most abundantly consumed flavonoids in the diet, reaching levels of 30–40 mg/day (23Spencer J.P. Abd-el-Mohsen M.M. Rice-Evans C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 423: 148-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Flavonoids are known to scavenge free radicals, inhibit a variety of kinases, reduce lipid peroxidation, inhibit apoptosis, prevent platelet aggregation, and exhibit anti-proliferative effects (24Williams R.J. Spencer J.P. Rice-Evans C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 838-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar, 25Peng I.W. Kuo S.M. J.

Several flavonoids have been documented to cross the blood-brain barrier and to protect neurons from cell death in both in vitro and in vivo models of neurodegenerative diseases (27Dajas F. Rivera-Megret F. Blasina F. Arredondo F. Abin-Carriquiry J.A. Costa G. Echeverry C. Lafon L. Heizen H. Ferreira M. et al.Braz. J. Med. Biol.

Med. 2004; 37: 1683-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). In the present study, we first demonstrate cytoprotective effects of Q3G against hydrogen peroxide injury associated with oxidative stress in SH-SY5Y cells. In order to determine if Q3G-mediated cytoprotection against oxidative stress is applicable to other cell lines that are not neuronal in origin, we also determined that Q3G protects the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 and the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 from oxidative injury. Then using cDNA microarrays to profile changes in gene expression associated with Q3G-mediated cytoprotection in SH-SY5Y cells, we report that only in cells pretreated with Q3G and then subjected to oxidative stress was the expression of numerous genes implicated in cholesterol biosynthesis elevated. Since the transcriptional regulating factor SREBP-2 plays a critical role in this biosynthesis and was activated in cells pretreated with Q3G and subjected to oxidative stress, cholesterol synthesis was blocked using siRNA technology to knock down SREBP-2 expression and chemical inhibitors to block the biosynthetic enzymes HMG-CoA reductase and 2,3-oxidosqualene:lanosterol cyclase (OSC). We show using these approaches that Q3G-induced de novo cholesterol synthesis plays a pivotal role in the cytoprotective effects of this flavonoid in SH-SY-5Y cells perhaps by enhancing membrane integrity that resists lipid peroxidation in the face of oxidative stress. Materials—Q3G was purchased from ChromaDex Inc. (Santa Ana, CA). The purity of Q3G was greater than 99.0% as determined by high pressure liquid chromatography/UV, NMR, and mass spectrometry. Caspase-3-cleaved spectrin antibody was generously provided by Dr. Donald Nicholson (Merck). Oxidosqualene:lanosterol cyclase inhibitor (OSCi), designated as RO0714565 (IC50 = 10 nm), was generously provided by Hoffman-La Roche (Pharmaceutical Division, Basal, Switzerland). [14C]Acetate, sodium salt (55 mCi/mmol; 1.66–2.22 GBq/mmol), and [14C]cholesterol (58.0 mCi/mmol; 2.15 GBq/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer and Amersham Biosciences, respectively. Cell culture reagents were obtained from Hyclone. All other chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma. Plasmids—The LDLp-588luc and TK-LXRE3-luc plasmids were gifts from Dr. D. S. Ory (30Frolov A. Zielinski S.E. Crowley J.R. Dudley-Rucker N. Schaffer J.E. Ory D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25517-25525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). LDLp-588luc contains the human LDL receptor (LDLr) promoter upstream of the luciferase reporter gene. The β-galactosidase construct was generously provided by Dr. C. Sinal (Department of Pharmacology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada). Cell Culture—The human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y), human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293), and human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. SH-SY5Y, MCF-7, and HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% serum (10% fetal bovine serum for SH-SY5Y and MCF-7 cells; 10% horse serum for HEK293 cells), 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. These cell lines were seeded at an initial density of 5 × 105 cells/ml in a 75-cm2 flask and passaged every third day. SH-SY5Y cells doubled every 48 h, whereas HEK293 and MCF-7 cells doubled every 24 h. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium Bromide (MTT) Assay—Cell viability was determined using the MTT assay (supplemental Fig. 1, A–D). SH-SY5Y, HEK293, and MCF-7 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at a density of 1 × 104 cells/100 μl and treated with varying concentrations of Q3G (0.01–100 μm), quercetin dihydrate (0.01–100 μm), or Me2SO vehicle for 6 or 18 h. Following a rinse in PBS, the cells were subjected to an H2O2 insult (500 μm for 15 min for SH-SY5Y cells, 500 μm for 3 h for HEK293 cells, and 800 μm for 24 h for MCF-7 cells, respectively). After several washes, the cells were maintained in the growth medium for 18 h. The cells were then incubated with 0.5 mg/ml MTT (Sigma) at 37 °C for 4 h. The formazan crystals generated by viable mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase from MTT were extracted using an equal volume of the solubilizing buffer (0.01 n HCl and 10% SDS). Absorbance was measured at 562 nm in an ELx800uv microplate reader (Bio-tek Instruments, Inc.). The resultant data were expressed as the percentage of viable cells relative to untreated controls. Cell Death ELISA—A cell death ELISA kit that detects cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments in cell lysates was used to assess cell death according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Briefly, cells were seeded in a 24-well plate at a density of 5 × 104 cells/500 μl and treated with Q3G (10 μm) or tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) (5 μm) for 18 h. Following a rinse in PBS, the cells were subjected to an H2O2 insult (500 μm for 15 min). After several washes, the cells were maintained in the growth medium for 18 h. The positive control was prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Absorbance was read at 405 nm using an ELx800uv microplate reader (Bio-tek Instruments). DNA fragmentation was expressed as an enrichment factor, a measure of specific enrichment of mono- and oligonucleosomes in the cell lysates. The enrichment factor was calculated as a ratio of the absorbance of the test sample to that of the untreated control. Cytotoxicity Assay—Cell membrane integrity was assayed by measuring the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) using the CytoTox nonradioactive kit (Promega). A positive control was prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Cells were plated in a 96-well plate at a density of 1 × 104 cells/100 μl in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 2 mm l-glutamine. After 18 h, cells were incubated with Q3G (10 μm) for 6 h. The medium was replaced, and cells were subjected to an H2O2 insult (500 μm for 15 min). After washing, the cells were incubated with mevastatin (1 μm) for 18 h. The cells were then centrifuged at 250 × g for 4 min, and 50 μl of medium was removed from each well of the plate and transferred to another 96-well plate. An equal volume of substrate solution containing 2-(p-iodophenyl)-3-(p-nitrophenyl)-5-phenyl-2H-tetrazolium chloride salts and diaphorase was added to the medium and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 50 μl of stop solution to each of the wells. Absorbance was measured at 490 nm using an ELx800uv microplate reader (Bio-tek Instruments). The background value was subtracted, and the result was expressed as a percentage of LDH release compared with the positive control. Terminal Deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated Deoxyuridine Triphosphate Nick End in Situ Labeling (TUNEL)—TUNEL labeling was performed to detect damaged cells by labeling the nicked end of DNA with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase using the Apo Tag kit as per the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science) (supplemental Fig. 2A). Cells seeded on a coverslip in a 24-well plate at a density of 5 × 104 cells/500 μl were treated with Q3G (10 μm) for 18 h. Following a rinse in PBS, the cells were subjected to H2O2 insult (500 μm for 15 min). After several washes, the cells were maintained in growth medium for 18 h. We included both a positive control (cells treated with 10 units of DNase for 20 min) and a negative control (cells not treated with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase enzyme) in the assay. TUNEL staining was then performed, and slides were mounted with DakoCytomation fluorescent mounting medium (DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA). The images were captured on a Zeiss inverted microscope using a Nikon camera. Determination of ROS—ROS was measured using 5-(and 6-)carboxy-2,7-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (Molecular Probes) as substrate that is oxidized to a fluorescent product in the presence of ROS (supplemental Fig. 2B). Cells were seeded in a 24-well plate at a density of 5 × 105 cells/500 μl in phenol red free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 2 mm l-glutamine. Cells were then incubated with Q3G, tBHQ, or vehicle (0.01 and 0.05% Me2SO) for 18 h. Following a rinse in PBS, the cells were subjected to the H2O2 insult (500 μm for 15 min) and treated with 0.11 mg/ml horseradish peroxidase for 15 min. 5-(and 6-)Carboxy-2,7-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (10 μm) was added to the cells immediately after the insult and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Subsequently, the cells were washed with PBS and lysed in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 0.5% Tween 20. The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was added to an opaque 96-well plate (Costar). Fluorescence was measured using Flx800 microplate fluorescence reader (Bio-tek Instruments) with an excitation wavelength (485 nm) and an emission wavelength (528 nm). ROS was expressed as -fold induction compared with untreated cells that received no oxidative insult. cDNA Microarray Studies—cDNA microarray studies were performed by the Southern Alberta Microarray Facility (SAMF) using human 14K microarray slides (GEO Platform accession numbers GPL3963 and GPL3964), printed at the University of Calgary. These arrays contain 13,972 70-mer oligonucleotides designed against the UniGene data base (Operon version 1.0) spotted in duplicate. For further information concerning the genes represented on these microarray chips and the microarrays used in these experiments, please see the SAMF site on the World Wide Web. RNA Extraction—In the first experiment, SH-SY5Y cells were treated with Q3G (10 μm) or Me2SO vehicle (0.05%) for 6 h. In a second experiment, SH-SY5Y cells were treated with Q3G (10 μm) or Me2SO vehicle (0.05%) for 6 h and subjected to an H2O2 insult (500 μm for 15 min) and allowed to recover for 6 h in growth medium before RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy minicolumn (Qiagen). The integrity of total RNA was determined on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel, and the absorbance of RNA was measured at 260 and 280 nm using a spectrophotometer. RNA samples having a 260/280 absorbance ratio of 1.9–2.0 were subsequently used for microarray analysis. cDNA Synthesis, Purification, and Hybridization—cDNA microarray studies were carried out by the SAMF at the University of Calgary. cDNA labeling was performed using the Fair-Play Microarray Labeling Kit II (catalog number 252006; Stratagene). For the detailed protocol, please see the Web site). Meaurement of Microarray Data and Specification—The scans were saved as image files in TIFF format and imported into QuantArray™ version 3.0 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) microarray analysis software used for spot identification, quantification, and background estimation. The quantified and imaged gpr files were then loaded into Gene Traffic Duo™ (Iobion) for microarray data management and analysis. The data were filtered to flag spots with intensities of less than 100 units, or less than twice the average background. The data were normalized according to the Lowess method resident in the Gene Traffic software (31Yang Y.H. Dudoit S. Luu P. Lin D.M. Peng V. Ngai J. Speed T.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In order to identify genes that were differentially expressed and statistically significant, Significance Analysis of Microarray (SAM) version 2.2 software was used (available on the World Wide Web). The data set created in Gene Traffic 4.0 was analyzed by SAM using the following criteria: one class analysis, median center arrays, and 100 permutations. SAM plots (supplemental Fig. 3, A and B) and SAM tables were generated at corresponding Δ values. The number of significant genes with a -fold change greater than 1.5 and a false discovery rate of <7% were determined. These significant genes were further analyzed through Panther software (available on the World Wide Web) to delineate the potential biological processes involved (supplemental Fig. 3C). The pathways defined by this set of genes were analyzed using Pathway Architect (Stratagene). Quantitative Real Time PCR—Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the DNA Engine Opticon 2 System (MJ Research) (supplemental Figs. 4, A–E, and 5, A and B). Total RNA was isolated from Q3G-, Q dihydrate-, and Me2SO-treated SH-SY5Y, HEK293, and MCF-7 cells that were subjected to oxidative stress using the RNeasy minicolumn (Qiagen). Briefly, 3 μg of DNase-treated total RNA was reverse transcribed using a First Strand cDNA synthesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Superarray Incorporation Inc.). The 20-μl RT reaction mix was diluted 5-fold in RNase-free water. In order to validate up-regulated genes, cDNA from Q3G-treated cells was serially diluted 10-fold (5 points in duplicates), and the standard curve was generated for GAPDH and the genes of interest (SCD1 and HMG-CoA reductase and SREBP-2, respectively). To validate a down-regulated gene (sestrin 1), cDNA from Me2SO-treated cells was serially diluted 10-fold (5 points in duplicates), and standard curves were generated for GAPDH and sestrin 1, respectively. A negative (no RT control) was included in all of the experiments. Triplicates of control and experimental cDNA samples were included in the experiment at an appropriate dilution. PCR master mix was prepared using an RT2 Real-Time™ PCR kit using gene-specific primers in 25 μl/well of a 96-well plate as per the manufacturer's instructions (Superarray Incorporation Inc.). The cycling parameter included activation of Taq polymerase at 95 °C for 15 min. This step was followed by denaturation at 95 °C/15 s, annealing for SCD1 at 60 °C/30 s with the primers 5′-TACCGCTGGCACATCAACTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TTGGAGACTTTCTTCCGGTCA-3′ (antisense) (32Wang J. Yu L. Schmidt R.E. Su C. Huang X. Gould K. Cao G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 332: 735-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) (product size, 87 bp); annealing for HMG-CoA reductase at 55 °C/30 s with the primers 5′-TACCATGTCAGGGGTACGTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAAGCCTAGAGACATAATCATC-3′ (antisense) (33Skarits C. Fischer S. Haas O.A. Clin. Chim.

Fischer S. Haas O.A. Clin. Chim. Acta. 2003; 336: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) (product size, 401 bp) and primer extension at 72 °C/30 s for a total of 40 cycles. The GAPDH Amplimer set (Clontech) was used to amplify GAPDH (450 bp). The melting curve analysis was performed to verify the accurate amplification of target amplicon. Data analysis was performed using Opticon software version 2.02. Using the standard curve generated for SCD1, HMG-CoA reductase, SREBP-2, sestrin 1, and GAPDH, respectively, the relative -fold increase in gene expression in the Q3G-treated sample over the Me2SO control was calculated using the comparative CT method (ΔΔCT) (34Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (127160) Google Scholar) and was quantified using 2-ΔΔCT with GAPDH as the internal control. The data were expressed as the relative -fold increase or decrease in gene expression compared with the Me2SO control. Lipid Peroxidation Assay—Lipid peroxidation is the method of choice for detecting phospholipid oxidation in cells either by measuring the initial products of oxidative attack, such as the lipid hydroperoxides and conjugated dienes, or by measuring the breakdown products of polyunsaturated fatty acid, namely malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxynonenal. A lipid peroxidation kit (Calbiochem) was used to measure lipid hydroperoxides generated by lipid oxidation utilizing a redox reaction with ferrous ions. The reaction of hydroperoxides with ferrous ions resulted in the generation of ferric ions that were detected using thiocyanate as a chromogen. Briefly, cells were seeded in a 6-well plate at a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml and incubated with Q3G (10 μm) or Me2SO (0.05%) for 6 h. The cells were then rinsed with PBS and subjected to H2O2 insult (500 μm for 15 min). The medium was replaced, and after 6 h, the lipid hydroperoxides were extracted from the cells using Extract R-saturated methanol and deoxygenated chloroform as per the manufacturer's instructions (Calbiochem). For the lipid peroxidation assay, a standard curve was generated. Briefly, standard and test samples were diluted in deoxygenated chloroform/methanol mixture (2:1) in a reaction volume of 950 μl in a glass tube. Chromogen substrate was freshly prepared, added to the samples (50 μl), and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. A volume of 300 μl was transferred from the glass tube to a glass 96-well plate, and absorbance was read at 490 nm using an ELx800uv microplate reader (Bio-tek Instruments). The lipid hydroperoxides in the test sample were extrapolated from a standard curve and expressed as nm/mg of protein. Cholesterol Assay—SH-SY5Y cells were seeded in a 6-well plate at a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml. Cells were incubated with Q3G (10 μm) or Me2SO vehicle (0.05%) for 6 h and exposed to H2O2 insult (500 μm for 15 min). After washing and incubation in growth medium for 6 h, the cells were counted.

https://openalex.org/W2154803112,"Extensive tissue remodeling occurs in breast tissue during pregnancy, resulting in growth and development of the mammary gland associated with extensive vascular remodeling, which is thought to be dependent on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). We show here that the endogenous antiangiogenic splice isoform of VEGF, VEGF(165)b, is normally expressed in nonlactating human and mouse breast, and is down-regulated in WT mice during lactation. To demonstrate the physiological role of VEGF(165)b in mammary tissue, we generated transgenic (TG) mice expressing VEGF(165)b, under the control of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) enhancer/promoter. These mice increase expression of VEGF(165)b in mammary tissue during mammary development. The offspring of TG mothers, but not TG fathers, die shortly after birth. The female TG mice have fewer blood vessels, less blood in the mammary tissue, and impaired alveolar coverage of the fat pad, and do not produce sufficient milk for nourishment of their pups. These findings demonstrate that endogenous overexpression of VEGF(165)b in the mammary gland inhibits physiological angiogenesis and that the regulation of the balance of VEGF isoforms is a requirement for mammary alveolar development and milk production. This study provides the first evidence for the role of endogenous antiangiogenic VEGF isoforms in normal physiology--their down-regulation is required for effective milk production."

The enzymes responsible for production of Aβ, BACE1 and γ-secretase, are therapeutic targets for treatment of Alzheimer disease. Two presenilin (PS) homologues, referred to as PS1 and PS2, comprise the catalytic core of γ-secretase. In comparing presenilin selectivity of several classes of γ-secretase inhibitors, we observed that sulfonamides in general tend to be more selective for inhibition of PS1-comprising γ-secretase, as exemplified by ELN318463 and BMS299897. We employed a combination of chimeric constructs and point mutants to identify structural determinants for PS1-selective inhibition by ELN318463. Our studies identified amino acid residues Leu172, Thr281, and Leu282 in PS1 as necessary for PS1-selective inhibition by ELN318463. These residues also contributed in part to the PS1-selective inhibition by BMS299897. Alanine scanning mutagenesis of areas flanking Leu172, Thr281, and Leu282 identified additional amino acids that affect inhibitor potency of not only these sulfonamides but also nonsulfonamide inhibitors, without affecting Aβ production and presenilin endoproteolysis. Interestingly, many of these same residues have been identified previously to be important for γ-secretase function. These findings implicate TM3 and a second region near the carboxyl terminus of PS1 aminoterminal fragment in mediating the activity of γ-secretase inhibitors. Our observations demonstrate that PS-selective inhibitors of γ-secretase are feasible, and such inhibitors may allow differential inhibition of Aβ peptide production and Notch signaling.

Inhibition of Notch signaling by nonselective γ-secretase inhibitors is a potentially limiting issue for the clinical development of this class of therapeutics. Hence, a major objective of inhibitors targeting γ-secretase for treatment of AD is the development of selective inhibitors that can reduce Aβ peptide production, without significantly interfering with the processing of other substrates of γ-secretase, principally Notch. Two presenilin homologues, referred to as PS1 and PS2, comprise the catalytic core of γ-secretase. Observations from KO mice show that Presenilin 1 containing γ-secretase contributes to ∼80% of total Aβ production in brain, whereas PS2 containing γ-secretase contributes to ∼20% of total Aβ (16De Strooper B.

We exploited this observation to map determinants for PS1 selectivity of these sulfonamides using chimeric constructs and point mutants. The results of our studies identify 3 residues as necessary and sufficient for the observed PS-1 selectivity of sulfonamide ELN318463: Leu172, Thr281, and Leu282 in PS1. These residues also contribute in part to the observed selectivity of BMS299897. We performed alanine scanning mutagenesis in regions flanking these residues to identify additional residues in PS1 that affect the inhibitor potency of the two sulfonamides as well as that of DAPT and L-685,458. Our findings provide insights into the possible binding sites of these inhibitors and, furthermore, demonstrate that selective targeting of presenilins is a feasible strategy for inhibiting γ-secretase in an isoform-specific manner for treatment of AD.

Polymer-supported borohydride (40 g; Aldrich on Amberlite IRA-400) was added in one portion, and a slight exotherm and some bubbling was observed. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 20 h, and the resin was then filtered off and thoroughly washed with methanol. The combined filtrates were evaporated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate, and the organic phase was washed with water, saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate, water, and brine. The organic phase was then dried with sodium sulfate. Solids were filtered off, filtrate was evaporated, and residue was recrystallized from hot ethyl acetate (20 ml) and hexane (150 ml).

Solvent was removed, and residue was chromatographed with silica gel eluting with 1:1 hexane in ethyl acetate to obtain 2.61 g of (R)-N-(4-bromobenzyl)-4-chloro-N-(2-oxoazepan-3-yl)benzenesulfonamide having m/z = 473.0. BMS299897 was synthesized as described by Smith et al. (30Smith, D. W., Munoz, B., Srinivasan, K., Bergstrom, C. P., Prasad, V., Chaturvedula, P. V., Milind, S., Deshpande, M. S., Keavy, D.

Presenilin chimeras were constructed by blunt end ligation of PCR-amplified fragments (Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase kit; Stratagene), and sequence was verified prior to transfection into transformed fibroblasts derived from PS1/PS2 double knock-out mice. Alanine scanning mutagenesis of the C2 and C5 subregions was carried out with mutagenic primers and the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Cell Culture and Transfection—Mouse fibroblasts derived from the PS1-/-/PS2-/- double knock-out cells (dKO cells; gift from Dr. Bart De Strooper) (23Herreman A. Serneels L. Annaert W. Collen D.

Transfections were performed using Nucleofector II (Amaxa GmbH, Germany) with about 1-10 million of PS1-/-PS2-/- cells, using transfection reagents supplied by the manufacturer.

Electroporated cells were first suspended into 1 ml of warm RPMI and then transferred (within 2-5 min after the addition of RPMI) into 5-10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, for plating into 96-well plates. For experiments using PS2, cells were plated at a density of ∼50,000/well in 96-well plates; for experiments involving PS1, cells were plated at a density of ∼15,000/well in 96-well plates. The cells were treated overnight (14-20 h) with different concentrations of γ-secretase inhibitors 1-3 h following plating. During the initial phases of this work, transfection efficiencies were monitored using green fluorescent protein reporter plasmid (∼90%) in conjunction with Aβ production from parallel transfections. The levels of Aβ produced were normalized for APP expression levels as well as PS expression levels, using Western blot analysis (see Figs. S1 and 9). Since the level of Aβ produced was highly consistent and reproducible across experiments with Nucleofector-mediated transfection under the experimental conditions described above (as illustrated in Fig. 8), in subsequent experiments with point mutant PS constructs shown in Figs. 5 and 6 and Tables 1 and 2, Aβ production from transfected cultures was used as a surrogate for transfection efficiency.FIGURE 8Activity of alanine scanning mutants as assessed by Aβ production. The graphs above show the relative Aβ levels of the mutants, expressed as a ratio of Aβ produced from the mutant relative to wild type PS1. The activity of alanine scanning mutants in the C2 and C5 regions of PS was assessed by measuring total Aβ produced (1-x) from the mutant compared with total Aβ from wild type PS1 within the same experiment.

Aβ40 ELISA employed antibodies 266 as capture and 2G3 (specific for Aβ40) as detection, respectively. Aβ42 ELISA employed antibodies 266 as capture and 21F12 (specific for the carboxyl terminus of Aβ 42) as detection, respectively (34Johnson-Wood K. Lee M. Motter R. Hu K. Gordon G. Barbour R. Khan K.

Aβ peptide (California Peptide Research, Napa, CA) was used as concentration standard in the ELISA. ELISAs were performed at room temperature using 50 μl of diluted or original conditioned medium from overnight culture of transfected cells, treated with γ-secretase inhibitors or Me2SO control. Following a 1-h incubation to capture Aβ peptide, the plates were incubated sequentially (45 min/incubation) with biotinylated detecting antibody (0.5 mg/ml), followed by horseradish peroxidase-strepavidin and horseradish peroxidase substrate (one-step slow TMB-Elisa; Pierce; catalogue number 34024). Plates were washed between incubations with Tris-buffered saline plus 0.05% Tween 20. Substrate reactions were terminated with 2 NH2SO4, for absorbance readings with a SpectraMax Plus (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Determination of Inhibitor Potencies and Statistical Analyses—Dose-response curves and corresponding EC50 values for the inhibitors described in this report were derived by curve fitting of secreted Aβ levels (determined by ELISA) from cells treated with a range of inhibitor concentrations using the ELfit program (IDBS, Alameda, CA). Due to experimental limitations involving transient transfection of a large number of constructs per experiment, the inhibitor potencies against a given construct or chimera were determined from individual experiments. Conclusions regarding the effect of a chimera or a mutation on inhibitor potency were based on average EC50 values from replicate experiments. Drift in the absolute value of an inhibitor's potency between experiments over time is evident (e.g. compare ELN318463 potency in Fig. 1 with Fig. 4). However, despite this experimental drift in EC50 values, the rank order of PS1 selectivity (ELN318463 > BMS299897) remained invariant. Furthermore, our conclusions from early studies with chimeric construct were corroborated by subsequent studies with point mutants as elaborated under “Results” and “Discussion.” For the alanine scanning mutagenesis of the C2 and C5 subregions, the statistical significance of compound potency against a particular alanine mutant was determined using an unpaired t test (GraphPad Prism software package) by comparing the EC50 of the compound against the mutant versus wild type PS1 (n = 2-4 each).FIGURE 4PS1 C2 and C5 subregions in the middle third of presenilin-1 are dominant contributors of selective inhibition of γ-secretase by sulfonamides.

https://openalex.org/W2012120489,"Inflammatory leukocyte accumulation is a common feature of major ocular diseases, such as uveitis, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration. Vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1), a cell surface and soluble molecule that possesses semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO) activity, is involved in leukocyte recruitment. However, the expression of VAP-1 in the eye and its contribution to ocular inflammation are unknown. Here, we investigated the role of VAP-1 in an established model of ocular inflammation, the endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU), using a novel and specific inhibitor. Our inhibitor has a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of 0.007 microM against human and 0.008 microM against rat SSAO, while its IC(50) against the functionally related monoamine oxidase (MAO) -A and MAO-B is >10 microM. In the retina, VAP-1 was exclusively expressed in the vasculature, and its expression level was elevated during EIU. VAP-1 inhibition in EIU animals significantly suppressed leukocyte recruitment to the anterior chamber, vitreous, and retina, as well as retinal endothelial P-selectin expression. Our data suggest an important role for VAP-1 in the recruitment of leukocytes to the immune-privileged ocular tissues during acute inflammation. VAP-1 inhibition may become a novel strategy in the treatment of ocular inflammatory diseases."

Sequence considerations suggested that 5β-POR is a member of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family of proteins but at the same time revealed that the sequence motifs that in standard SDRs contain the catalytically important residues are missing. Here we present crystal structures of 5β-POR from Digitalis lanata in complex with NADP+ at 2.3Å and without cofactor bound at 2.4Å resolution together with a model of a ternary complex consisting of 5β-POR, NADP+, and progesterone. Indeed, 5β-POR displays the fold of an extended SDR. The architecture of the active site is, however, unprecedented because none of the standard catalytic residues are structurally conserved. A tyrosine (Tyr-179) and a lysine residue (Lys-147) are present in the active site, but they are displayed from novel positions and are part of novel sequence motifs. Mutating Tyr-179 to either alanine or phenylalanine completely abolishes the enzymatic activity. We propose that the distinct topology reflects the fact that 5β-POR reduces a conjugated double bond in a steroid substrate via a 1–4 addition mechanism and that this requires a repositioning of the catalytically important residues. Our observation that the sequence motifs that line the active site are conserved in a number of bacterial and plant enzymes of yet unknown function leads us to the proposition that 5β-POR defines a novel class of SDRs.

The beneficial effects of cardenolides, also known as cardiac glycosides or cardiotonic steroids, are well documented, and they have been applied for the treatment of cardiac insufficiencies for centuries (1Withering W.

Ahern K.G. Biochemistry. 3rd Ed. Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., San Francisco2000: 340-342Google Scholar). Digitalis plants are still the major source for cardenolides, and as a step in the biosynthetic pathway, the Digitalis enzyme progesterone 5β-reductase (5β-POR) 2The abbreviations used are: 5β-POR, progesterone 5β-reductase; SDR, short chain dehydrogenase/reductase; AKR, aldo-keto-reductase; 17β-HSD, 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; GMD, GDP mannose-4,6-dehydratase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; r.m.s., root mean square; PDB, Protein Data Bank. catalyzes the stereospecific NADPH-dependent reduction of the Δ4-double bond in progesterone to 5β-pregnane-3,20-dione. Because all Digitalis cardenolides share the characteristic 5β-configuration, the enzyme 5β-POR catalyzes a central step during their biosynthesis (5Herl V. Fischer G. Muller-Uri F. Kreis W. Phytochemistry. 2006; 67: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 6Gärtner D.E. Wendroth S. Seitz H.U. FEBS Lett. 1990; 271: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 7Caspi E.

NADH/NADPH-dependent reductases as well as the related dehydrogenases, dehydratases, and epimerases can be classified into two major protein families: the (α/β)8-barrel containing aldo-keto-reductases (AKRs) (8Jez J.M. Penning T.M. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2001; 130–132: 499-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and the Rossman fold containing short chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDRs) (9Rossman M.G.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6003-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). Additional families such as the long and medium chain dehydrogenases/reductases are related to SDRs because they share with the latter the dinucleotide-binding double Rossman fold (12Edwards K.J.

SDRs are about 250 residues long and form a large family with over 2000 members (15Kallberg Y. Oppermann U. Jornvall H. Persson B. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 636-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Because their central feature consists of an all-parallel β-sheet and their catalytic mechanism evolves around a tyrosine residue, they are also referred to as 7-stranded tyrosine-dependent oxidoreductases (16Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5595) Google Scholar). The dinucleotide-binding double Rossman fold motif is contained within the N-terminal six β-strands of the seven-stranded β-sheet (strands βAto βG). Insertions of up to 100 residues in length occur in many SDRs and are predominantly accommodated within the left-handed crossover connection between strands βF and βG as well as after strand βG toward the C terminus of the protein. These two segments are often collectively referred to as the ligand-binding domain of SDRs, and they are considered the prime determinants of substrate specificity (17Webb N.A. Mulichak A.M. Lam J.S. Rocchetta H.L. Garavito R.M. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The SDR family members can be identified at the sequence level based on several conserved motifs, and variations in these motifs have been used to define SDR subfamilies (15Kallberg Y. Oppermann U. Jornvall H. Persson B. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 636-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 18Persson B. Kallberg Y. Oppermann U. Jornvall H. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2003; 143–144: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). These motifs are either involved in NADH/NADPH cofactor binding or cluster around the substrate-binding pocket. SDRs contain in their active site a highly conserved amino acid triad consisting of a serine, tyrosine, and lysine residue, with a possible fourth conserved asparagine residue (19Filling C. Berndt K.D. Benach J. Knapp S. Prozorovski T. Nordling E. Ladenstein R. Jornvall H. Oppermann U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25677-25684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). The conservation of the catalytic triad in almost all SDRs indicates that SDRs share a common reaction mechanism. Moreover, this mechanism seems also to extend to AKRs because they have the conserved tyrosine and lysine in common with SDRs (20Bennett M.J. Schlegel B.P. Jez J.M. Penning T.M. Lewis M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10702-10711Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Based on sequence alignments, 5β-POR from Digitalis plants has been predicted to be an SDR family member (5Herl V. Fischer G. Muller-Uri F. Kreis W. Phytochemistry. 2006; 67: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 21Gavidia I. Tarrio R. Rodriguez-Trelles F. Perez-Bermudez P. Seitz H.U. Phytochemistry. 2006; 68: 853-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to mammalian steroid 5β-reductase, which is a member of the AKR family (22Penning T.M. Ma H. Jez J.M. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2001; 130–132: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Plant 5β-POR shares the typical NADPH/NADH-binding sequence motifs with other SDRs (18Persson B. Kallberg Y. Oppermann U. Jornvall H. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2003; 143–144: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), but intriguingly, none of the sequence motifs that cluster around the substrate-binding site and that contain the catalytically important residues are conserved. The sequence motif that displays the conserved active site serine residue in SDRs, namely GXXXXXSS (or SSXXXXG in some SDRs) (10Kallberg Y. Oppermann U. Jornvall H. Persson B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4409-4417Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 18Persson B. Kallberg Y. Oppermann U. Jornvall H. Chem. Biol.

Biochem. 2002; 269: 4409-4417Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 18Persson B. Kallberg Y. Oppermann U. Jornvall H. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2003; 143–144: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) that displays the active site tyrosine and lysine residue is absent, and a conserved NFYYXXED motif can be found instead (5Herl V. Fischer G. Muller-Uri F. Kreis W. Phytochemistry. 2006; 67: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 21Gavidia I. Tarrio R. Rodriguez-Trelles F. Perez-Bermudez P. Seitz H.U. Phytochemistry. 2006; 68: 853-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although it has been suggested that one of the tyrosines in this motif corresponds to the typical SDR active site tyrosine, it is not possible to locate the additionally required lysine residue in any of the adjacent sequence segments. Hence, the question arises whether 5β-POR defines a novel class of SDRs with a different set of sequence motifs and conserved residues in the catalytic site and that might be characterized by a distinct reaction mechanism. We previously reported the purification and crystallization of 5β-POR from Digitalis lanata (5Herl V. Fischer G. Muller-Uri F. Kreis W.

The crystal structures show that although 5β-POR displays the standard SDR fold, the architecture of the active site is unprecedented. Protein Production and Purification—To produce recombinant 5β-POR from D. lanata, we slightly modified previously published protocols (5Herl V. Fischer G. Muller-Uri F. Kreis W. Phytochemistry. 2006; 67: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 23Egerer-Sieber C. Herl V. Muller-Uri F. Kreis W. Muller Y.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst.

In the pQE-30 expression plasmid (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), the first 13 residues of the 389-residue-long protein were missing and were replaced by a 6-residue-long N-terminal His tag instead. The best expression levels were obtained in Escherichia coli strain M15[pREP4] at low temperatures. Therefore, two 1-liter LB medium bacteria cultures that were initially grown at 37 °C to an OD of 0.50 were transferred to 12 °C. 5β-POR production was induced at an OD of 0.7 upon addition of 0.3 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the bacteria cultures were incubated for an additional 48 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet was dissolved in 5 ml of lysis buffer (NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm (2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, pH 8.0), and the solution was sonicated. Following centrifugation, the filtrated supernatant was loaded onto a 1-ml nickel-Sepharose HP affinity column (GE Healthcare). The protein was eluted with a 20–500 mm imidazole gradient prepared with the lysis buffer described above. 5β-POR was further purified by an additional gel filtration step using a Superdex 75 HiLoad 16/60 column (GE Healthcare) with a 20 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0 buffer. The protein eluted in two separate peaks. Although the first peak contained high molecular weight disulfide cross-linked oligomers that could be visualized in a nonreducing electrophoretic gel and that failed to crystallize, the fractions covering the low molecular weight peak were pooled and concentrated to a final concentration of 21 mg/ml for subsequent crystallization. During the last step, the buffer components were diluted to 6 mm Tris/HCl and 45 mm NaCl, pH 8.0. The overall protein yield was about 1.5 mg of pure protein from 2 liters of bacterial cell culture. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Analysis of Variant 5β-POR—Selective mutants of 5β-POR were constructed by PCR using the Phusion™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Finnzymes, Finland) with the following primer pairs (substituted amino acids are underlined): Ala-179dir (5′-TGAAGTACATGAACTTTGCCTATGATTTAGAG-3′) and Ala-179rev (5′-ACCTGGGCAAATCCTCAGTGT-3′) for the Y179A mutant; sense Phe-179dir (5′-TGAAGTACATGAACTTTTTCTATGATTTAGAGG-5′) and Ala-179rev for the Y179F mutant. All primers were purchased in a reverse phase-HPLC-purified quality from Eurogentec S.A. (Belgium). The pQE-30 expression plasmid containing wild-type 5β-POR was used as a template (5Herl V. Fischer G. Muller-Uri F. Kreis W. Phytochemistry. 2006; 67: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). PCR was performed in a Personal Cycler 20 (Biometra GmbH, Göttingen, Germany) as follows: 30 s at 98 °C (denaturation), 25 cycles of 10 s at 98 °C (denaturation), 30 s at 68 °C (annealing), and 90 s at 72 °C (extension), finally 5 min at 72 °C (extension). Mutated genes were sequenced 4–6 times (MWG AG, Martinsried, Germany), and the proteins were produced in E. coli (strain M15[pREP4]) as described above for the wild-type protein. To analyze 5β-POR activity, the method described by Stuhlemmer and Kreis (24Stuhlemmer U. Kreis W. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1996; 34: 85-91Google Scholar) was used and slightly modified (5Herl V. Fischer G. Muller-Uri F. Kreis W. Phytochemistry. 2006; 67: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The assay contained the following in a final volume of 1000 μl: 945 μl of purified protein fraction (0.2 mg/ml), 6.4 mm NADP+, 32.1 mm glucose 6-phosphate, 42 nanokatals of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and 0.3 mm progesterone as substrate. Heat-inactivated (10 min, 100 °C) samples served as controls. The mixtures were kept in 2-ml Eppendorf tubes and incubated at 30 °C and 550 rpm for 2 h prior to extraction, using 1000 μl of dichloromethane. Y179F and Y179A mutants were incubated under standard conditions and prolonged conditions (4 h). The organic phase was evaporated and the pellet dissolved in 50 μl of methanol for subsequent HPLC and TLC analysis. Enzyme activity was calculated using the HPLC method published previously (5Herl V. Fischer G. Muller-Uri F. Kreis W. Phytochemistry. 2006; 67: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The detection limit was shown to be 80 ng of pregnane-3,20-dione. In addition, the TLC system described by Herl et al. (5Herl V. Fischer G. Muller-Uri F. Kreis W. Phytochemistry. 2006; 67: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), which is about 10 times more sensitive than the HPLC method, was used to check enzyme activity qualitatively. Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals of 5β-POR with no cofactor bound were grown using the hanging drop method as described earlier (23Egerer-Sieber C. Herl V. Muller-Uri F. Kreis W. Muller Y.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2006; 62: 186-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). 1 μl of protein solution was mixed with 1 μl of reservoir solution (15% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m ammonium acetate, 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.6), and the droplet was suspended over 700 ml of reservoir solution. After 2 days the octahedral crystals with lengths of about 250 μm could be isolated from droplets that were covered by a dense protein skin. The crystals were soaked for 5 min in a cryoprotection solution prepared from 80% (v/v) reservoir solution and 20% (v/v) ethylene glycol prior to being shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The binary complex between 5β-POR and NADP+ was prepared by mixing 60 μl of protein solution with an 8-fold molar excess of NADP+. In an attempt to produce the ternary complex consisting of protein, substrate, and cofactor, we incubated the protein solution in addition with 1.8 mg of solid progesterone for 48 h. However, we later did not find any evidence for the presence of progesterone in the structure of the binary complex. After removal of insoluble progesterone by centrifugation, crystals of 5β-POR in complex with NADP+ were grown using the containerless batch method (25Chayen N.E. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 927-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). 300 μl of high density fluorinated silicon oil (FS-1265 Fluid 10000 CST, Dow Corning, Wiesbaden, Germany) were transferred into a well of a cell culture plate and overlaid with 500 μl of regular silicon oil (silicon oil M 5, Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany). At the interface between the two liquids, a droplet was deposited that was obtained by mixing 0.4 μl of H2O, 2.2 μl of the binary 5β-POR complex solution (see above), and 1.8 μl of a crystallization solution consisting of 22.9% 2-methyl-2,4-petanediol, 3.5% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.05 m sodium acetate, 0.02 m CaCl2, pH 5.8. Crystals appeared within 48 h and were shock-frozen after being soaked for 5 min in a cryoprotection mixture consisting of the crystallization solution (80%, v/v) supplemented with ethylene glycol (20%, v/v). Highly redundant diffraction data sets of 5β-POR alone and in complex with the cofactor were collected at BESSY synchrotron in Berlin covering a total oscillation range of 180°. Data indexing and processing were accomplished with program XDS (26Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1988; 21: 916-924Crossref Scopus (1683) Google Scholar). Diffraction data statistics are summarized in Table 1. Both crystals belonged to the tetragonal space group P43212 with cell axes almost identical to those previously observed for the selenomethionine-derivatized crystals of 5β-POR (23Egerer-Sieber C.

Herl V. Muller-Uri F. Kreis W. Muller Y.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2006; 62: 186-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Because the crystals of 5β-POR alone and in complex with the cofactor NADP+ were isomorphous to the selenomethionine-derivatized 5β-POR, the model built into the MAD-derived density map could be readily transferred to the new diffraction data and completed for missing residues, side chain placements, the bound cofactor, and solvent molecules. An identical set of reflections was used in all structures to validate model building and refinement using Rfree (27Brunger A.T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1993; 49: 24-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Model building was performed using program COOT, and σA-weighted electron density maps were used for guidance (28Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23387) Google Scholar, 29Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1986; 42: 140-149Crossref Scopus (2036) Google Scholar). The model was refined with program REFMAC (30Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar), and during the final stages of the refinement, rigid body anisotropic B-factors were introduced using TLS refinement (31Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). Two different rigid body groups were outlined, namely the double Rossman fold that consists of 5β-POR residues 25–208, 250–279, and 353–368, and the substrate-binding helical domain formed by residues 209–249, 280–352, and 369–389. In both structures a number of solvent-exposed side chains, namely six in the complex structure and 10 in the structure of 5β-POR alone, lacked any electron density and were therefore modeled with atom occupancies of zero. Model building was halted after the refinement of 5β-POR alone and of 5β-POR in complex with NADP+ converged to a final crystallographic Rfactor of 20.2 and 17%, respectively (Table 1). Residual density at position 298 prompted us to resequence the expression construct, thereby confirming that the amino acid at this position was glutamic acid and not glycine (5Herl V. Fischer G. Muller-Uri F. Kreis W. Phytochemistry. 2006; 67: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A glutamic residue at this position is also present in other 5β-POR orthologs (data not shown). At two positions we observed strong electron density in the cofactor-bound 5β-POR structure that could not be explained by water molecules. One of these could be satisfactorily modeled by a sodium ion and the other as a chloride ion that interacts with Tyr-179 in the enzyme active site. Molecular Modeling of the Ternary Protein Cofactor Substrate Complex—Because any attempts to produce crystals of 5β-POR in complex with either progesterone, cortisol, or 4-androstene-3,17-dione remained unsuccessful regardless whether the cofactor NADP+ was present or not, we computationally docked the substrate progesterone into the binding site. For this purpose, the protein design algorithms of the in-house program MUMBO were supplemented with a flexible ligand-handling routine to identify the energetically most favorable interaction between progesterone and the protein (32Stiebritz M.T. Muller Y.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 648-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In a first step a backbone-dependent rotamer library was used to build multiple side chain conformations into the model (33Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Cohen F.E. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1661-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). In addition, up to several thousand random ligand orientations and positions were generated, starting from the coordinates of a manually placed ligand. In the next step, the energetically most favorable combination of side chain conformations and ligand position were identified using either the dead end elimination or the Metropolis Monte Carlo search algorithm in combination with an empirical force field. The force field included in addition to standard terms also a solvation free energy estimate and an empirical H-bond energy term (32Stiebritz M.T. Muller Y.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 648-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 34Lazaridis T. Karplus M. Proteins. 1999; 35: 133-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar, 35Kortemme T. Morozov A.V. Baker D. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 1239-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The docking procedure resembles that described by Leach (36Leach A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 345-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). A more detailed description of the method and validation calculations are provided in supplemental Figs. 1 and 2 and supplemental Tables I and II). The Structure of 5β-POR—The structure of 5β-POR from D. lanata was solved in complex with the cofactor NADP+ at a resolution of 2.3 Å (Rfactor = 17.0%, Rfree = 21.3%) and with no cofactor bound at 2.4 Å resolution (Rfactor = 20.2%, Rfree = 24.9%) (Table 1). In both structures, no electron density was visible for the N-terminal residues 14–25. At present it cannot be decided whether the entire 25-residue-long N terminus in 5β-POR is highly flexible or whether these residues lack any ordered structure because of the deletion of wild-type residues 1–13 in the expression plasmid. Although in the cofactor-bound structure the main chain could be traced contiguously from residues 26–389, in the cofactor-free structure, the segments 68–72 and 155–158 could not be built. All residues in both structures lie within allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot with 93.7 and 92.8% of the residues in the mostly favored regions (37Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). 5β-POR exhibits a typical SDR fold (10Kallberg Y. Oppermann U. Jornvall H. Persson B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4409-4417Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), and the N terminus contains the standard dinucleotide-binding double Rossman fold (9Rossman M.G. Liljas A. Branden C.-I. Banaszak L.J. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, New York1975: 61-102Google Scholar, 38Rossman M.G. Argos P. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 105: 75-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). A short insertion that is present in the loop connecting strands βE and βF as well as two long insertions that occur between the sixth and the seventh β-strand (strands βF and βG) and following strand βG are typical for the extended members of the SDR family (18Persson B. Kallberg Y. Oppermann U. Jornvall H. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2003; 143–144: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The latter two insertions are almost exclusively formed by α-helices and accommodate close to 130 residues of the total 389 residues of 5β-POR. Because of the size of these insertions and because the segments that connect them to the central double Rossman fold shape the steroid-bin"
https://openalex.org/W2148696436,"Binocular rivalry has been extensively studied to understand the mechanisms that control switches in visual awareness and much has been revealed about the contributions of stimulus and cognitive factors. Because visual processes are fundamentally adaptive, however, it is also important to understand how experience alters the dynamics of perceptual switches. When observers viewed binocular rivalry repeatedly over many days, the rate of perceptual switches increased as much as 3-fold. This long-term rivalry speeding exhibited a pattern of image-feature specificity that ruled out primary contributions from strategic and nonsensory factors and implicated neural plasticity occurring in both low- and high-level visual processes in the ventral stream. Furthermore, the speeding occurred only when the rivaling patterns were voluntarily attended, suggesting that the underlying neural plasticity selectively engages when stimuli are behaviorally relevant. Long-term rivalry speeding may thus reflect broader mechanisms that facilitate quick assessments of signals that contain multiple behaviorally relevant interpretations."
https://openalex.org/W2055057864,"Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is a rare disorder characterized by impaired ventricular filling with decreased diastolic volume. We are reporting the functional effects of the first cardiac troponin T (CTnT) mutation linked to infantile RCM resulting from a de novo deletion mutation of glutamic acid 96. The mutation was introduced into adult and fetal isoforms of human cardiac TnT (HCTnT3-ΔE96 and HCTnT1-ΔE106, respectively) and studied with either cardiac troponin I (CTnI) or slow skeletal troponin I (SSTnI). Skinned cardiac fiber measurements showed a large leftward shift in the Ca2+ sensitivity of force development with no differences in the maximal force. HCTnT1-ΔE106 showed a significant increase in the activation of actomyosin ATPase with either CTnI or SSTnI, whereas HCTnT3-ΔE96 was only able to increase the ATPase activity with CTnI. Both mutants showed an impaired ability to inhibit the ATPase activity. The capacity of the CTnI·CTnC and SSTnI·CTnC complexes to fully relax the fibers after TnT displacement was also compromised. Experiments performed using fetal troponin isoforms showed a less severe impact compared with the adult isoforms, which is consistent with the cardioprotective role of SSTnI and the rapid onset of RCM after birth following the isoform switch. These data indicate that troponin mutations related to RCM may have specific functional phenotypes, including large leftward shifts in the Ca2+ sensitivity and impaired abilities to inhibit ATPase and to relax skinned fibers. All of this would account for and contribute to the severe diastolic dysfunction seen in RCM.

Cardiomyopathies are diseases that primarily affect muscle function and are associated with varying degrees of cardiac dysfunction. Morphological and pathophysiological differences of the diseased myocardium have led to the classification of three distinct types of cardiomyopathies: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), 2The abbreviations used are: HCMhypertrophic cardiomyopathyTnTtroponin TTnItroponin ITnCtroponin CRCMrestrictive cardiomyopathyRLCregulatory light chainTmtropomyosinMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidDDTdithiothreitolCTnTcardiac troponin TCtnIcardiac troponin ISSTnIslow skeletal troponin IHCTnThuman cardiac TnTWTwild type. 2The abbreviations used are: HCMhypertrophic cardiomyopathyTnTtroponin TTnItroponin ITnCtroponin CRCMrestrictive cardiomyopathyRLCregulatory light chainTmtropomyosinMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidDDTdithiothreitolCTnTcardiac troponin TCtnIcardiac troponin ISSTnIslow skeletal troponin IHCTnThuman cardiac TnTWTwild type. dilated cardiomyopathy, and restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM). HCM and dilated cardiomyopathy can be primarily classified by their morphologies, whereas RCM has a more complicated phenotype (1Ammash N.M. Seward J.B. Bailey K.R. Edwards W.D. Tajik A.J.

Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is a rare cardiomyopathic disorder that is characterized by abnormal diastolic function that results from impaired ventricular filling, increased ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and dilated atria. RCM is initially manifested by reduced ventricular compliance or increased stiffness (2Huang X.P. Du J.F. Acta Pharmacol. Sin. 2004; 25: 1569-1575PubMed Google Scholar). However, patients with RCM generally have normal to near normal systolic function until the later stages of the disease that eventually leads to heart failure. The prognosis of RCM is poor, especially in pediatric cases where patients often require heart transplantation and have average survival rates of (<50%) after diagnosis (3Chen S.C. Balfour I.C.

Smith E.O. Towbin J.A. Denfield S.W. Circulation. 2000; 102: 876-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Pediatric RCM is most commonly idiopathic in origin and is noninfiltrative, and an associated interstitial fibrosis is often the sole detectable histopathologic abnormality of the myocardium (6Kushawaha S.S. Fallon J.T. Fuster V. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Recently, the first case of infantile RCM because of a mutation in CTnT was discovered (7Peddy S.B. Vricella L.A. Crosson J.E. Oswald G.L. Cohn R.D. Cameron D.E. Valle D. Loeys B.L. Pediatrics. 2006; 117: 1830-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Genetic analysis of the proband revealed a novel in-frame 285–287 GGA deletion in exon 9 of the cardiac TnT gene (TNNT2), resulting in a deletion of glutamic acid in position 96 (it was determined that the mutation had initially been reported in error as a glutamine). 3B. L. Loeys, personal communication. 3B. L. Loeys, personal communication. Previously, it was shown that the genetic component of RCM was mainly found in the cardiac TnI gene (TNNI3) and the cardiac desmin gene (DES) (8Zhang J. Kumar A. Stalker H.J. Virdi G. Ferrans V.J. Horiba K. Fricker F.J. Wallace M.R. Clin. Genet. 2001; 59: 248-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The genetic evaluation revealed that the mutation arose de novo in the patient as both parents tested negative for this deletion in TNNT2. The patient presented with symptoms at 12 months of age and upon examination revealed a structurally normal heart with severely dilated atria. Moderate hypertrophy of the myocytes was found with significant disarray and fibrosis (7Peddy S.B. Vricella L.A. Crosson J.E. Oswald G.L. Cohn R.D. Cameron D.E. Valle D. Loeys B.L. Pediatrics. 2006; 117: 1830-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In vitro studies have indicated that TnT mutations can impart a vast array of functional defects, including reduced actomyosin ATPase activity, reduced inhibitory abilities, cross-bridge kinetics, myocyte contractility, and altered Ca2+ sensitivity (9Gomes A.V. Barnes J.A. Harada K. Potter J.D. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 263: 115-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 10Marian A.J. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2003; 41: 994-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The functional region of TnT affected by the RCM-associated deletion mutation of glutamic acid 96 is found in the main Tm-binding region located in the N-terminal half of TnT. This segment is highly conserved, and the acidic amino acids appear to be preserved across several species, indicating that they may play an essential role. Most TnT HCM mutations occur between residues 79 and 170, a region known to bind to Tm, thereby forming the link between the Tn complex and the thin filament (11Palm T. Graboski S. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Greenfield N.J. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2827-2837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In general, mutations that occur within this region do not drastically affect the basal force or ATPase activity (12Szczesna D. Zhang R. Zhao J. Jones M. Guzman G. Potter J.D. J. Biol.

Mutations within residues 92–110 impair Tm-dependent functions of TnT and most likely affect cooperativity of the thin filament (9Gomes A.V. Barnes J.A. Harada K. Potter J.D. Mol. Cell.

Activation of the actomyosin ATPase activity is mediated by a direct interaction between amino acids 77 and 191 of sTnT with tropomyosin and actin (14Oliveira D.M. Nakaie C.R. Sousa A.D. Farah C.S.

The effects of the RCM TnT mutation were examined in both the adult and fetal human cardiac TnT isoforms (HCTnT3 and HCTnT1, respectively) to evaluate the disease progression after birth when the isoform switch occurs. HCTnT3-ΔE96 and HCTnT1-ΔE106 were incorporated into porcine cardiac skinned fibers together with either CTnI·CTnC or SSTnI·CTnC complexes using the CTn displacement method (12Szczesna D. Zhang R.

The Ca2+ sensitivity, maximal isometric force, and the ability of TnI·TnC to inhibit unregulated force were evaluated. Both mutant isoforms showed a large increase in Ca2+ sensitivity when compared with their respective wild type (WT). There was no significant change in force recovery in any of these experiments. The ability of Tn to inhibit both ATPase activity and Ca2+-unregulated force in the presence of the HCTnT3-ΔE96 and HCTnT1-ΔE106 mutants was impaired. Interestingly, experiments carried out with SSTnI showed smaller effects when compared with CTnI, suggesting a protective role of the slow skeletal isoforms that could explain why the affected infant did not display any RCM phenotype during early heart development. The adult and fetal isoforms of HCTnT (HCTnT3 and HCTnT1, respectively), which had already been cloned in our laboratory (15Gomes A.V. Guzman G. Zhao J. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35341-35349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), were used as templates for PCR using primers designed to delete 3-bp codon GAA for glutamic acid that results in the TnT-RCM mutants (HCTnT3-ΔE96 and HCTnT1-ΔE106). All subcloned DNA sequences were inserted into the pET3d expression plasmid and sequenced to verify that they were correct prior to expression and purification. Standard methods previously used in this laboratory were utilized for expression and purification of the various HCTnTs (16Gomes A.V. Venkatraman G. Davis J.P. Tikunova S.B. Engel P. Solaro R.J.

Briefly, recombinant TnT3, TnT1, and the TnT-RCM mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) codon plus bacterial cells (Stratagene). The bacterially expressed TnTs were passed over a fast flow S-Sepharose column and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.6 m KCl. The fractions containing TnT were loaded onto a fast flow Q-Sepharose column and eluted using a 0–0.6 m salt gradient. To obtain optimum purity, the proteins were further purified by passage over a DEAE-Sephacel column, which gave >97% pure protein as verified by SDS-PAGE. All steps were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise indicated. The cDNAs for human CTnI, SSTnI, and CTnC were previously cloned in our laboratory by reverse transcription-PCR using human heart total RNA (Stratagene), sequence-specific primers, and an Omniscript reverse transcription kit (Qiagen) (16Gomes A.V.

E. coli BL21 (DE3) codon plus bacterial cells were transformed with pET-3d constructs containing CTnI, SSTnI, or CTnC. The TnIs were first purified by column chromatography on a fast flow S-Sepharose column at 4 °C and eluted with a linear KCl gradient of 0–0.6 m. Semi-pure HCTnI and HSSTnI were dialyzed against a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm DTT and loaded onto an HCTnC affinity column. Pure HCTnI and HSSTnI were eluted using a gradient of 0–1 mm EDTA and 0–6 m urea. The purity of the TnI proteins was determined by SDS-PAGE. CTnC was first applied onto a fast flow Q-Sepharose column and eluted with 0–0.6 m salt gradient. The cleanest fractions were then dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. CTnC was removed following; ammonium sulfate was added to a final concentration of 0.5 m, and the protein was loaded onto a pre-equilibrated phenyl-Sepharose column. Pure CTnC was directly eluted using a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5. Fractions of >98% purity as determined by SDS-PAGE were pooled, dialyzed against 5 mm ammonium bicarbonate, and then lyophilized. The purified individual troponin subunits were first dialyzed against 3 m urea, 1 m KCl, 10 mm MOPS, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and then twice against the same buffer excluding urea. At this point the protein concentrations of the individual subunits were determined using the Coomassie Plus kit (Pierce) and then mixed in a 1.3:1.3:1 TnT: TnI:TnC molar ratio. After 1 h, the complexes were successively dialyzed against decreasing KCl concentrations (0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0.1, 0.05, and 0.025 m). The excess TnT and TnI that precipitated during complex formation was removed by centrifugation. Proper stoichiometry was verified by SDS-PAGE before storage of troponin complexes at -80 °C. The following troponin complexes were formed: HCTnT1 or HCTnT1-ΔE106·HCTnI·HCTnC; HCTnT1 or HCTnT1-ΔE106·HSSTnI·HCTnC; HCTnT3 or HCTnT3-ΔE96·HCTnI·HCTnC; and HCTnT3 or HCTnT3-ΔE96·HSSTnI·HCTnC. Porcine cardiac myosin, rabbit skeletal F-actin, and porcine cardiac Tm were prepared as described previously (17Lang R. Gomes A.V. Zhao J. Housmans P.R. Miller T. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11670-11678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations used for actomyosin ATPase assays were as follows: 0.6 μm porcine cardiac myosin, 3.5 μm rabbit skeletal F-actin, 1 μm porcine cardiac tropomyosin, and 0–2 μm of pre-formed Tn complexes as described above (15Gomes A.V. Guzman G. Zhao J. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35341-35349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The ATPase inhibitory assay was performed in a 0.1-ml reaction mixture of 75 mm KCl, 3.4 mm MgCl2, 0.1 μm CaCl2, 1.5 mm EGTA, 3.5 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT, 11.5 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, at 25 °C. The ATPase activation assay was performed using the same 0.1-ml buffer mixture with 3.3 mm MgCl2 and 1.7 mm CaCl2. The ATPase reaction was initiated with the addition of ATP and quenched after 20 min using trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 5%. The precipitated assay proteins were removed by centrifugation, and the inorganic phosphate concentration of the supernatant, which was released by ATP hydrolysis, was determined according to the method of Fiske and SubbaRow (18Fiske C.H. SubbaRow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Porcine Skinned Cardiac Fiber Preparation—Skinned papillary muscles were prepared from the left ventricles of freshly slaughtered porcine hearts. Small bundles of fibers were isolated and treated overnight with a pCa 8.0 relaxing solution (10-8 m [Ca2+]free, 1 mm [Mg2+]free, 7 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm MgATP2-, 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 20 mm creatine phosphate, and 15 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, I = 150 mm) containing 1% Triton X-100 and including 50% glycerol at -20 °C. Fibers were then transferred to a similar solution without Triton X-100 and kept at -20 °C. Measurement of the Ca2+ Dependence of Force Development—The porcine muscle fiber bundles (a bundle of three to five fibers isolated from a batch of glycerinated fibers) with the length and diameter varying between 1.2 and 1.5 mm and 120 and 150 μm, respectively, were attached to tweezer clips connected to a force transducer. The fibers were treated with pCa 8.0 containing 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min to ensure complete membrane removal, which allows better access to the myofilament proteins. After extensively washing the fibers with pCa 8.0 without Triton X-100, the initial maximal force was determined by transferring the fiber into pCa 4.0 solution (identical to pCa 8.0 solution except the [Ca2+]free is 10-4 m). To determine the Ca2+ sensitivity of force development, the fibers were gradually exposed to solutions of increasing Ca2+ concentration from pCa 8.0 to 4.0. Data were analyzed using the following equation: % change in force = 100 × [Ca2+]n/([Ca2+]n + [Ca2+50]n), where “[Ca2+50]” is the free [Ca2+] that produces 50% force and “n” is the Hill coefficient. The various pCa solutions were calculated using the computer program (pCa Calculator) recently developed in our laboratory (19Dweck D. Reyes-Alfonso Jr., A. Potter J.D. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 347: 303-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Endogenous Tn Complex Displacement—To displace the endogenous Tn complex, skinned fibers were incubated with 0.8 mg/ml HCTnT isoform 1, 3, or RCM mutants for 2.5 h at room temperature after a brief 10-min exposure to a preincubation buffer without protein (250 mm KCl, 20 mm MOPS, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, pH 6.2). The TnT-treated fibers were then washed with preincubation buffer, and the displacement was evaluated by the level of unregulated force development measured in both pCa 8 and pCa 4 solutions. The Ca2+ regulation of steady-state force was restored using pre-formed human CTnI·CTnC or SSTnI·CTnC. The fibers were reconstituted using 25 μm of the binary complex in pCa 8.0 solution for ∼1 h at room temperature until the force reaches a stable level. The Ca2+ dependence of force was determined before and after performing the displacement and reconstitution as described above. After the Ca2+ sensitivity assays, all skinned fibers were dissolved in 1% SDS and 10% β-mercaptoethanol and stored at -20 °C until electrophoretic analysis. Skinned fiber samples were boiled for 2 min and electrophoresed on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. SDS-PAGE was used to determine protein incorporation into skinned fibers utilizing ¾ and ¼ of the total sample volume for Coomassie staining and Western blot analysis, respectively. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for Western blot (Bio-Rad) using standard protocols (20Wang Y. Szczesna-Cordary D. Craig R. Diaz-Perez Z. Guzman G. Miller T. Potter J.D. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 2205-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes were first immersed and incubated for 5 min in Tris-buffered saline alone and then incubated overnight in primary specific antibodies in a 50% Tris-buffered saline, 50% Rockland blocking buffer for Odyssey fluorescence detection. Specific antibodies to detect TnT (1A11; Research Diagnostic Inc, Flanders, NJ), TnI (6F9; Fitzgerald Industries International Inc., Concord, MA), and RLC (rabbit polyclonal anti-RLC serum developed in this laboratory) were used at 1:2000 dilution. After primary antibody incubation, blots were washed three times (5 min each), placed in covered boxes for 1 h, and incubated with secondary fluorescent antibody. The specific primary antibodies were detected using a 1:4000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG antibody labeled with IR800 or CY5.5 fluorescent dye. Reaction signals were measured by scanning the blot with the Odyssey Infrared Imager (LI-COR Biosciences), and the band intensities were quantified using Odyssey software. The experimental results were reported as x ± S.E., and analyzed for significance using Student's t test at p < 0.05, paired or unpaired depending on the experimental design. Effect of HCTnT RCM Mutant Isoforms on the Ca2+ Sensitivity of Force Development—To address the functional consequences of the newly discovered TnT-RCM related mutation during fetal and adult developmental stages, we inserted the mutation into two different isoforms of human cardiac TnT (HCTnT) as follows: HCTnT isoform 3 found in adult hearts with a glutamic acid deletion at position 96 (HCTnT3-ΔE96) and HCTnT isoform 1 with a glutamic acid deletion at position 106 (HCTnT1-ΔE106), the corresponding position in the fetal TnT isoform. The different numbering of these two isoforms is because of the fact that exon 5 is present in isoform 1 but not in isoform 3 (Fig. 1). To measure the Ca2+ sensitivity of force development, the endogenous porcine troponin complex was displaced using established methods by our laboratory (12Szczesna D. Zhang R. Zhao J. Jones M. Guzman G. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 624-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Fibers were treated with excess exogenous HCTnT and reconstituted with either human CTnI·CTnC or SSTnI·CTnC, and the Ca2+ sensitivity of force development was measured as a function of increasing Ca2+ concentration (see Fig. 2 and “Experimental Procedures” above).FIGURE 2Diagram for TnT displacement and TnI·TnC reconstitution protocol. The scheme depicts the methods utilized in measuring the TnT displacement and the ability of the TnI·TnC complex to restore the fiber relaxation. Incubation of the fiber with HCTnT WT or RCM mutant isoforms (0.8 mg/ml) for 1.5 h at room temperature resulted in a complete loss of the Ca2+ dependence of force. The fibers became insensitive to Ca2+ and were not able to relax because of the absence of the TnI·TnC complex. Tn displaced fibers were incubated with a pre-formed HCTnI·CTnC or HSSTnI·CTnC complex (1 mg/ml), dissolved in the relaxation solution (pCa 8.0). They underwent a gradual relaxation that was monitored by the decrease of force in the absence of Ca2+ (pCa 8.0). The dotted line represents the ability of TnI·TnC to fully relax the fibers when displaced with WT-HCTnT, and the black line represents the incapacity of TnI·TnC complex to completely relax the fibers when displaced with TnT RCM mutant isoforms (HCTnT3-ΔE96 or HCTnT1-ΔE106). X indicates maximal unregulated tension at pCa 8.0 after TnT treatment; Y indicates tension remaining after complete TnI·TnC complex reconstitution.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As shown in Fig. 3, drastic changes in the Ca2+ sensitivity of force development were observed between fibers displaced by the TnT RCM mutant and the TnT WT isoforms. Fig. 3, A and C, shows a significant and pronounced leftward shift in fibers containing HCTnT3-ΔE96 and reconstituted with CTnI·CTnC (pCa50 = 6.16) or SSTnI·CTnC (pCa50 = 6.19) compared with their controls (pCa50 = 5.73 and pCa50 = 5.84, respectively). In the next series of experiments, porcine cardiac fibers were treated with HCTnT1-ΔE106 or HCTnT1-WT and also reconstituted with either CTnI·CTnC or SSTnI·CTnC. Results depicted in Fig. 3B with CTnI·CTnC show that the Ca2+ sensitivity increases in fibers treated with HCTnT1-ΔE106 (pCa50 = 6.23 ± 0.08) compared with HCTnT1-WT (pCa50 = 5.81 ± 0.02). However, fibers treated with HCTnT1-ΔE106 and reconstituted with SSTnI·CTnC (Fig. 3D) do not show as large a leftward shift compared with its control (ΔpCa50 =+0.20). HCTnT3-ΔE96 in the presence of CTnI mimics the biological environment of the adult troponin complex, and under these conditions the most pronounced leftward shift was produced (ΔpCa50 =+0.43). Interestingly, HCTnT1-ΔE106 in the presence of SSTnI mimics the Tn fetal heart environment and presented a smaller leftward shift in the Ca2+ sensitivity of force development. The mean values of pCa50 and the Hill coefficient (nH) for each condition are summarized in the Table 1.TABLE 1Summary of pCa force relationship curves in fibers reconstituted with either cardiac or slow skeletal TnI·TnC complex at pH 7.0 The pCa50, nH, and %Ca2+ unregulated force values are the average of many independent fiber experiments, and the errors are the S.E. values. The Ca2+-unregulated force was calculated by the following equation: (FpCa8/FpCa4) × 100, where the FpCa8 and FpCa4 are the force at pCa 8.0 and pCa 4.0 solutions, respectively. p values compare the RCM mutant in TnT3 and TnT1 against their respective TnT-WT with the same TnI isoform.TnTTnI isoformpCa50Hill coefficientΔpCa50aFor ΔpCa50, TnT-RCM pCa50 – TnT-WT pCa50, subtraction of the RCM mutant values in TnT3 and TnT1 from their respective WT and matching TnI isoform% Ca2+ unregulated forceNo. of experimentsHCTnT3Cardiac5.73 ± 0.022.34 ± 0.3484.5 ± 5.24HCTnT3-ΔE96aCardiac6.16 ± 0.06bp < 0.0011.30 ± 0.31cp < 0.05+0.4393.0 ± 1.14HCTnT3Slow skeletal5.84 ± 0.031.78 ± 0.2381.2 ± 4.96HCTnT3-ΔE96Slow skeletal6.19 ± 0.03bp < 0.0011.38 ± 0.25cp < 0.05+0.3586.6 ± 3.14HCTnT1Cardiac5.81 ± 0.021.77 ± 0.2284.8 ± 2.76HCTnT1-ΔE106aCardiac6.23 ± 0.08bp < 0.0011.21 ± 0.33cp < 0.05+0.4290.4 ± 3.06HCTnT1Slow skeletal5.91 ± 0.021.86 ± 0.2783.9 ± 5.65HCTnT1-ΔE106Slow skeletal6.11 ± 0.07dp < 0.011.09 ± 0.30+0.2091.0 ± 1.06a For ΔpCa50, TnT-RCM pCa50 – TnT-WT pCa50, subtraction of the RCM mutant values in TnT3 and TnT1 from their respective WT and matching TnI isoformb p < 0.001c p < 0.05d p < 0.01 Open table in a new tab Fig. 3, A and C, insets, shows that porcine fibers treated with HCTnT1-WT and reconstituted with either human CTnI·CTnC or SSTnI·CTnC complex have an increased Ca2+ sensitivity of force development compared with HCTnT3-WT-treated fibers. This effect of different HCTnT isoforms on the Ca2+ sensitivity of force development has been reported several times by our laboratory (15Gomes A.V. Guzman G. Zhao J. Potter J.D. J. Biol.

We have also observed an additive increase of Ca2+ sensitivity in fibers reconstituted with SSTnI·CTnC compared with the CTnI·CTnC. This is because of the well known effect of SSTnI that lowers the threshold for Ca2+ activation of force development. After the HCTnT RCM mutant isoforms were incorporated, the Hill coefficient values decreased indicating lowered cooperativity. To eliminate the possibility that the changes in pCa50 and cooperativity were an artifact from our method of analysis, we have plotted the data normalized to the maximal force in the fibers after treatment with HCTnT WT, according to Lang et al. (17Lang R. Gomes A.V. Zhao J. Housmans P.R. Miller T. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11670-11678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We observed increased tension at lower Ca2+ concentrations and decreased tension at higher Ca2+ concentrations (see supplemental Fig. 1), but the difference in pCa50 values and Hill coefficients still remained. To address whether the TnT RCM mutants have altered affinity for the thin filament and poor incorporation in the fibers, we measured the unregulated tension at low Ca2+ concentration (pCa 8.0) after the displacement (see scheme in Fig. 2). No changes were observed in the ability of the HCTnT RCM mutants to displace the endogenous CTn complex compared with their respecti"
https://openalex.org/W2118792521,"Prostacyclin synthase (PGIS) is a cytochrome P450 (P450) enzyme that catalyzes production of prostacyclin from prostaglandin H(2). PGIS is unusual in that it catalyzes an isomerization rather than a monooxygenation, which is typical of P450 enzymes. To understand the structural basis for prostacyclin biosynthesis in greater detail, we have determined the crystal structures of ligand-free, inhibitor (minoxidil)-bound and substrate analog U51605-bound PGIS. These structures demonstrate a stereo-specific substrate binding and suggest features of the enzyme that facilitate isomerization. Unlike most microsomal P450s, where large substrate-induced conformational changes take place at the distal side of the heme, conformational changes in PGIS are observed at the proximal side and in the heme itself. The conserved and extensive heme propionate-protein interactions seen in all other P450s, which are largely absent in the ligand-free PGIS, are recovered upon U51605 binding accompanied by water exclusion from the active site. In contrast, when minoxidil binds, the propionate-protein interactions are not recovered and water molecules are largely retained. These findings suggest that PGIS represents a divergent evolution of the P450 family, in which a heme barrier has evolved to ensure strict binding specificity for prostaglandin H(2), leading to a radical-mediated isomerization with high product fidelity. The U51605-bound structure also provides a view of the substrate entrance and product exit channels."
https://openalex.org/W2058110544,"Clostridial botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) causes a neuroparalytic condition recognized as botulism by arresting synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Although the crystal structures of full-length BoNT/A and BoNT/B holotoxins are known, the molecular architecture of the five other serotypes remains elusive. Here, we present the structures of BoNT/A and BoNT/E using single particle electron microscopy. Labeling of the particles with three different monoclonal antibodies raised against BoNT/E revealed the positions of their epitopes in the electron microscopy structure, thereby identifying the three hallmark domains of BoNT (protease, translocation, and receptor binding). Correspondingly, these antibodies selectively inhibit BoNT translocation activity as detected using a single molecule assay. The global structure of BoNT/E is strikingly different from that of BoNT/A despite strong sequence similarity. We postulate that the unique architecture of functionally conserved modules underlies the distinguishing attributes of BoNT/E and contributes to differences with BoNT/A."

Insect-derived growth factor (IDGF), the first ADGF to be cloned, is a secretory ADGF purified from the conditioned medium of NIH-Sape-4, an embryonic cell line of Sarcophaga peregrina (flesh fly) (1Homma K. Matsushita T. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13770-13775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). IDGF stimulates the growth of NIH-Sape-4 cells with a specific activity comparable with mammalian growth factors. Site-directed mutagenesis has demonstrated that the ADA activity of IDGF is essential for its growth factor activity (3Homma K.J. Tanaka Y. Matsushita T. Yokoyama K. Matsui H. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43761-43766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 15Tanaka Y. Yamaguchi S. Fujii-Taira I. Iijima R. Natori S. Homma K.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 350: 334-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). So far, ADGF families have been reported in various invertebrates. In Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly), Male-specific IDGF was identified as a transmembrane-type ADGF and is suggested to participate in spermatogenesis (7Matsushita T. Fujii-Taira I. Tanaka Y. Homma K.J. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36934-36941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Recently, six ADGFs have been identified in Drosophila, one of which (Adgf-A2) encodes Male-specific IDGF (8Maier S.A. Podemski L. Graham S.W. McDermid H.E. Locke J. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 280: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 16Dolezal T. Gazi M. Zurovec M. Bryant P.J. Genetics. 2003; 165: 653-666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, ADGF families have been identified in other fruit flies, sand flies, sea slugs, tsetse flies, mosquitoes, fungi, and slime mold (2Maier S.A. Galellis J.R. McDermid H.E. J. Mol. Evol. 2005; 61: 776-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). ADGF families have also been identified in vertebrates, with human CECR1 first identified as a member of the ADGF family (17Riazi M.A. Brinkman-Mills P. Nguyen T. Pan H. Phan S. Ying F. Roe B.A. Tochigi J. Shimizu Y. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Buchwald M. McDermid H.E. Genomics. 2000; 64: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The human CECR1 is a candidate gene responsible for “cat eye syndrome” (17Riazi M.A. Brinkman-Mills P. Nguyen T. Pan H. Phan S. Ying F. Roe B.A. Tochigi J. Shimizu Y. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Buchwald M. McDermid H.E. Genomics. 2000; 64: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Cat eye syndrome is a human developmental disorder characterized by a variety of congenital defects, including ocular coloboma (hence the name “cat eye”), heart and kidney defects, and mental retardation (18Freedom R.M. Gerald P.S. Am. J. Dis. Child. 1973; 126: 16-18PubMed Google Scholar, 19Schinzel A. Schmid W. Fraccaro M. Tiepolo L. Zuffardi O. Opitz J.M. Lindsten J. Zetterqvist P. Enell H. Baccichetti C. Tenconi R. Pagon R.A. Hum. Genet. 1981; 57: 148-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Cat eye syndrome is associated with duplication of the proximal long arm of human chromosome 22, which contains CECR1, suggesting that the syndrome might be due to the overexpression of CECR1 (20Footz T.K. Brinkman-Mills P. Banting G.S. Maier S.A. Riazi M.A. Bridgland L. Hu S. Birren B. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Pan H. Nguyen T. Fang F. Fu Y. Ray L. Wu H. Shaull S. Phan S. Yao Z. Chen F. Huan A. Hu P. Wang Q. Loh P. Qi S. Roe B.A. McDermid H.E. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1053-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). CECR1 homologues have also been identified in the genomes of other vertebrate species, such as chimp, baboon, pig, chicken, frog, zebrafish, and pufferfish (2Maier S.A. Galellis J.R. McDermid H.E. J. Mol. Evol. 2005; 61: 776-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), indicating that the ADGF/CECR1 genes represent a family of evolutionally conserved genes. Interestingly, no obvious CECR1 homologue has yet been identified in rodents (20Footz T.K. Brinkman-Mills P. Banting G.S. Maier S.A. Riazi M.A. Bridgland L. Hu S. Birren B. Minoshima S. Shimizu N.

Gene (Amst.). 2001; 267: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 10Zurovec M. Dolezal T. Gazi M. Pavlova E. Bryant P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. 2005; 391: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), including IDGF (3Homma K.J. Tanaka Y. Matsushita T. Yokoyama K. Matsui H. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43761-43766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), where the Km, Vmax, and kcat values are comparable with those of mammalian cytoplasmic ADAs (21Wiginton D.A. Coleman M.S. Hutton J.J. Biochem. J. 1981; 195: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As IDGF was originally identified as a growth factor in an embryonic cell line (1Homma K. Matsushita T. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13770-13775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and ADA activity was shown to be indispensable for growth factor activity (3Homma K.J. Tanaka Y. Matsushita T. Yokoyama K. Matsui H. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43761-43766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), it is plausible that the ADGF/CECR1 family plays a role in cell proliferation during morphogenesis and organogenesis via its ADA activity. In Drosophila, the lack of Adgf-a leads to precocious metamorphic changes during metamorphosis, including the differentiation of macrophage-like cells, fat body disintegration and developmental delay (16Dolezal T. Gazi M. Zurovec M. Bryant P.J. Genetics. 2003; 165: 653-666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Dolezal T. Dolezelova E. Zurovec M. Bryant P.J. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: 1213-1224Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Transgenic expression of human CECR1 in mice results in abnormal heart and kidney development, suggesting a possible role in mammalian development (23Riazi A.M. Arsdell G.V. Buchwald M. Transgenic Res. 2005; 14: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The in vivo function of the CECR1 family in vertebrates, however, remains unclear, as there is no known CECR1 homologue in mice. In the present study, we analyzed the molecular properties and in vivo functions of Xenopus CECR1s to increase our understanding of the roles of the ADGF/CECR1 family in vertebrates. The results demonstrate a key role of Xenopus CECR1s in embryonic development via their ADA activity. Embryos and Their Culture—Xenopus laevis embryos were collected and cultured as described previously (24Shiokawa K. Koga C. Ito Y. Shibata M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 62: 247-270PubMed Google Scholar). The embryos were staged according to the method described by Nieuwkoop and Faber (25Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis (Daudin). North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1956Google Scholar). cDNA Cloning for Xenopus cecr1s—To isolate Xenopus cecr1 cDNA, PCR was performed using Xenopus cDNA library (embryo, stage 30, Stratagene). The nucleotide sequences of the degenerated primers used for the PCR were 5′-GT(G/T)GGI(C/A)(G/A)IGA(A/G)GA(C/T)ACIGG-3′ and 5′-CCA(A/G)TCNAT(T/C)TCICCIGC (G/A)TG(G/A)AA-3′, which correspond to 325VGHEDTG331 and 355FHAGETDW362, respectively. A 114-bp cDNA fragment was amplified and used as a probe for subsequent cDNA cloning. Two hybridization-positive clones were isolated from 1.3 × 105 clones of a Xenopus embryo (stage 30) cDNA library (Stratagene) by plaque hybridization, and their sequences determined. Phylogenetic Analysis—Deduced amino acid sequences encoded by the vertebrate CECR1-like genes were aligned using CLUSTAL W (26Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55638) Google Scholar). The molecular tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method (27Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar) and displayed using TreeviewPPC (28Page R.D. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar). Accession numbers for each gene are: Hs_CECR1 (AF190746), Ss_CECR1 (AF384216), Gg_CECR1 (AY902779), Dr_CECR1-1 (AF384217), Dr_CECR1-2 (Genomic BX323558), Tn_CECR1-1 (Genomic CAAE01014566), and Tn_CECR1-2 (Genomic CAAE01014691). Preparation of Recombinant Xl_CECR1s—The recombinant Xl_CECR1-1 and Xl_CECR1-2 proteins were produced in Escherichia coli BL21 star (DE3) using a pET100 directional TOPO expression kit (Invitrogen) as well as in Xenopus A6 cells (American Type Culture Collection). In the first method, the coding regions of Xl_cecr1-1 and -2 were amplified by PCR and subcloned into a pET100/D-TOPO vector. His-tagged fusion proteins were then produced in E. coli. Purification was performed using a HiTrap Chelating HP column (GE Healthcare BioSciences). In the second method, the amplified coding regions of Xl_cecr1-1 and -2 were subcloned and transfected to Xenopus A6 cells with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics). The recombinant proteins were used for assaying ADA and growth factor activities. Preparation of Antibodies against Xl_CECR1s—To prepare antibodies against Xl_CECR1-1 and Xl_CECR1-2, the synthetic peptides CEDLAMNPEASEREL and CKFIKDLAMN-WKKEL, which are specific to Xl_CECR1-1 and Xl_CECR1-2, respectively, were conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and injected separately into an albino rabbit with Complete Freund adjuvant. After three booster injections with Incomplete Freund adjuvant, each antiserum was affinity-purified using the recombinant Xl_CECR1-1 or -2, produced in E. coli. Assay of the ADA Activity of Xl_CECR1s—The ADA activity of Xl_CECR1s was assayed as described by Iwaki-Egawa et al. (29Iwaki-Egawa S. Watanabe Y. Matsuno H. J. Rheumatol. 2001; 28: 485-489PubMed Google Scholar). Enzymatic activity was determined by quantifying inosine liberated from adenosine. Inosine is converted by purine nucleoside phosphorylase into hypoxanthine; the latter is then converted into uric acid and diformazan by xanthine oxidase and nitro blue tetrazolium. Thus, the optical density at 540 nm of diformazan was measured. In brief, the recombinant Xl_CECR1s were preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C in a reaction mixture containing 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8), 1 unit/ml xanthine oxidase, 0.24 unit/ml purine nucleoside phosphorylase, and 1 mm nitro blue tetrazolium. Following incubation, the ADA assay was initiated by adding adenosine, and the mixture was further incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 1/4 volume of 50% acetic acid. The absorption at 540 nm diformazan was then measured. One unit of ADA activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that produced 1 μmol of inosine/min. Assay of Growth Factor Activity—The growth factor activity assay was performed as described previously by assessing cell proliferation (7Matsushita T. Fujii-Taira I. Tanaka Y. Homma K.J. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36934-36941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). NIH-Sape-4 cells were cultured in M-M medium (30Mitsuhashi J. Maramorosch K. Contrib. Boyce Thompson Inst. 1964; 22: 435-460Google Scholar) at 25 °C, as described previously (31Komano H. Kasama E. Nagasawa Y. Nakanishi Y. Matsuyama K. Ando K. Natori S. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, NIH-Sape-4 cells were suspended at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/ml in M-M medium, and then 100 μl of the cell suspension was poured into each well of a 96-well microtiter plate. Cell proliferation was assessed by measuring the enhancement of cellular metabolism using the Alamar Blue assay, after the addition of 1 ng of recombinant Xl_CECR1-1 and 10 ng of Xl_CECR1-2 (32Ahmed S.A. Gogal Jr., R.M. Walsh J.E. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 170: 211-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar, 33Page B. Page M. Noel C. Int. J. Oncol. 1993; 3: 473-476PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were then incubated for 2 days at 25 °C in the presence or absence of the test sample. Following this, 15 μl of Alamar Blue (Alamar Biosciences, Inc.) was added, and changes in the color of the culture medium were determined by measuring A570 and A610. One unit of growth factor activity was defined as the amount giving half-maximal stimulation of cell proliferation. Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)—Total RNA was extracted from Xenopus embryos using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RT-PCR was performed using the ProStar First Strand RT-PCR kit (Stratagene). The oligonucleotide primers used to detect Xl_cecr1s mRNA were 5′-CATACTTCTTCCATGCAGGAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-ACCGAAGATGGATGGGTCATC-3′ (antisense). These primers are designed to detect both Xl_cecr1-1 and Xl_cecr1-2. As an internal control, ornithine decarboxylase mRNA was detected using the oligonucleotide primers (5′-GTCAATGATGGAGTGTATGGATC-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCCATTCCGCTCTCCTGAGCAC-3′ (antisense)). Whole Mount in Situ Hybridization—Whole mount in situ hybridization of Xenopus embryos was performed as described previously (34Fukui A. Noda M. Asashima M. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 203: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The Xl_cecr1 probe consisted of digoxigenin-labeled RNA corresponding to a 605-bp fragment (+904 to +1508) of Xl_cecr1-2 cDNA. The Xmyod probe consisted of digoxigenin-labeled RNA corresponding to a 350-bp fragment (+157 to +506) of Xmyod cDNA (35Dosch R. Gawantka V. Delius H. Blumenstock C. Niehrs C. Development. 1997; 124: 2325-2334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Xa2a probe consisted of digoxigenin-labeled RNA corresponding to a 457-bp fragment (+479 to +935) of Xa2a cDNA clone (MGC:85585) (36Klein S.L. Strausberg R.L. Wagner L. Pontius J. Clifton S.W. Richardson P. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 225: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The Xmyf-5 probe consisted of digoxigenin-labeled RNA corresponding to a 405-bp fragment (+29 to +433) of Xmyf-5 cDNA clone (GenBank™ accession number X56738) (35Dosch R. Gawantka V. Delius H. Blumenstock C. Niehrs C. Development. 1997; 124: 2325-2334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Microinjection of Adenosine, DCF, and Adenosine/P1 Receptor Agonists—Microinjection was carried out via the modified method of Skoglund and Keller (37Skoglund P. Keller R. Dev. Biol. 2007; 301: 404-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Solutions injected were 10 mm adenosine, 10 mm DCF (2′-deoxycoformycin), 20 μm 5′-N-ethylcarboxamido adenosine, 1 mm cyclopentyl adenosine, 1 mm CGS-21680 hydrochloride in MMR buffer (0.1 m NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm Hepes (pH 7.5)). Approximately 100 nl of each solution was injected into late gastrula archenteron at stage 12. Injected embryos were incubated in 0.1 × Steinberg solution at 20 °C up to stage 35/36. Microinjection of Morpholino Oligonucleotides (MO)—MO microinjections were performed on two-cell stage embryos immobilized in a plastic mold. The MO was diluted in MMR buffer and 5 nl of 1 mm solution was injected into each blastomere of two-cell stage embryos. After injection, the embryos were cultured in 0.1 × Steinberg solution at 20 °C up to stage 35/36. MOs designed to be antisense specific to Xl_cecr1-1 or Xl_cecr1-2 were purchased from GeneTools, LLC (Philomath, OR). To knock down both the Xl_CECR1-1 and Xl_CECR1-2 simultaneously, a mixture of both MOs was used in the experiments. The control MOs were four nucleotide-substituted versions of experimental MOs. The MO sequences containing the initiation codon were as follows (with substituted nucleotides underlined): Xl_cecr1-1 MO, ATGCACGTCATCTTAATTCTCTCAG; 4-mis-Xl_cecr1-1 MO, ATGGACGTGATCTTAATACTCACAG; Xl_cecr1-2 MO, GCAACCAATGGGAGACGCACGCCAT; 4-mis-Xl_cecr1-2 MO, GCTACCTATGGGAGACGGACGGCAT. To confirm that the phenotype caused by the injection of the first pair of MOs is due to a specific knock down of CECR1s, we designed a second pair of MOs from a 5′-untranslated region sequence of Xl_CECR1s. MOs were diluted in MMR and 5 nl of 0.1 mm solution was injected into each blastomere of two-cell stage embryos. MO sequences were as follows: Xcecr1-1-5′UTR MO, ATTCTCTCAGTCTCCTCTAATCCTG and Xcecr1-2-5′UTR MO, TAATTCTCTCTCTCCTCTAATCCTG. Semiquantitative RT-PCR Using Primers for Various Developmental Marker Genes—Total cellular RNA was isolated from each embryo using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA (1.4 μg) was treated with RNase-free DNase I (Invitrogen) and reverse-transcribed using SuperScript III (Invitrogen) with oligo(dT) primers. The ornithine decarboxylase transcript was amplified to normalize the cDNA content of the samples. Equal amounts of cDNA were subsequently used for the amplification of marker genes with gene-specific primers. The linear range of amplification was determined for each primer set. For semiquantitative determination of relative gene expression levels, 10-μl samples of the amplificates were collected during PCR after the completion of three different cycle numbers in the linear range. The amplicons were analyzed on a 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. The primers (5′ to 3′) and cycle numbers used were: Xmyf5 (35Dosch R. Gawantka V. Delius H. Blumenstock C. Niehrs C.

Identification and Characterization of X. laevis cecr1 cDNAs—To investigate the role of the ADGF/CECR1 family in vertebrates, we attempted to isolate cDNA (s) for the X. laevis homologue of CECR1. For this, we first amplified a cDNA fragment of the Xenopus cecr1 homologue using degenerate primers designed according to the amino acid sequences conserved among human, pig, and zebrafish CECR1s; this was due to the lack of information regarding the nucleotide sequence of the Xenopus homologue of CECR1 on commencement of this study. We identified two cDNAs that encode relevant but distinct proteins, named Xl_CECR1-1 and Xl_CECR1-2. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of Xl_CECR1-1 and -2 revealed that they shared ∼40% sequence identities with Sarcophaga IDGF and human CECR1, respectively (Fig. 1A). Based on their high sequence identities (91%), Xl_CECR1-1 and -2 were considered as isoforms. The Xl_CECR1-2 nucleotide sequence was almost identical to that of a clone (accession number AY902778) deposited in the NCBI data base. Both Xl_CECR1-1 and -2 contained putative signal sequences in their N termini, suggesting that they are secretory ADGFs (51Neilsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref Scopus (4928) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that Xl_CECR1-1 and -2 are members of the CECR1 family and that their closest relative is the chicken Gg_CECR1 (Fig. 1B). Consensus amino acids in the active site of cellular classical ADA were conserved in many CECR1s including Xl_CECR1"

Kinetic and isotope effect studies have been carried out to determine the kinetic mechanism of TβM for comparison with the homologous mammalian enzymes, dopamine β-monooxygenase and peptidylglycine α-hydroxylating monooxygenase. A new and distinctive feature of TβM is very strong substrate inhibition that is dependent on the level of the co-substrate, O2, and reductant as well as substrate deuteration. This has led to a model in which tyramine can bind to either the Cu(I) or Cu(II) forms of TβM, with substrate inhibition ameliorated at very high ascorbate levels. The rate of ascorbate reduction of the E-Cu(II) form of TβM is also reduced at high tyramine, leading us to propose the existence of a binding site for ascorbate to this class of enzymes. These findings may be relevant to the control of octopamine production in insect cells. Tyramine β-monooxygenase (TβM) catalyzes the synthesis of the neurotransmitter, octopamine, in insects.

The copper hydroxylases are a unique class of enzymes that are found in eukaryotes and play a critical role in the biosynthesis of neurotransmitters and hormones. The most studied enzymes in this family are peptidylglycine α-hydroxylating monooxygenase (PHM) 3The abbreviations used are: PHMpeptidylglycine α-hydroxylating monooxygenaseTβMtyramine β-monooxygenaseDβMdopamine β-monooxygenaseascascorbatetyrtyraminetyr-d2β,β-dideuterated tyramine. 3The abbreviations used are: PHMpeptidylglycine α-hydroxylating monooxygenaseTβMtyramine β-monooxygenaseDβMdopamine β-monooxygenaseascascorbatetyrtyraminetyr-d2β,β-dideuterated tyramine. and dopamine β-monooxygenase (DβM) (1Klinman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3013-3016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). PHM catalyzes the conversion of C-terminal glycine-extended peptides to their α-hydroxylated products, the first step in the amidation of peptide hormones, required for a range of biological activities (2Prigge S.T. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Amzel L.M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1236-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). DβM catalyzes the hydroxylation of dopamine to yield norepinephrine and, thus, is vital for the regulation of these neurotransmitters (3Kim C-H. Zabetian C.P. Cubells J.F. Cho S. Biaggioni I.

More recently, a third member of this enzyme family was identified, tyramine β-monooxygenase (6Monastirioti M. Linn Jr., C.E. White K. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3900-3911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TβM is the insect homolog of DβM, sharing 39% identity and 55% similarity with the mammalian enzyme. TβM similarly catalyzes the hydroxylation of tyramine at the β-carbon position (Scheme 1). Although tyramine plays no role in mammalian physiology, the product of TβM, octopamine, has been shown to act as a neurotransmitter in invertebrates, regulating physiological functions such as neuromuscular transmission, behavioral development, and ovulation (7Roeder T. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 2005; 50: 447-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 8Lehman H.K. Schulz D.J. Barron A.B. Wraight L. Hardison C. Whitney S. Takeuchi H. Paul R.K. Robinson G.E. J. Exp.

One advantage to studies with TβM is the much more facile expression system for this enzyme in relation to DβM (10Gray E.E. Small S.N. McGuirl M.A. Protein Expression Purif. 2006; 47: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), which makes it possible to pursue structure/function relationships. In this paper, we report a detailed analysis of the kinetic behavior of the wild type TβM, an essential first step in understanding this complex enzyme system. peptidylglycine α-hydroxylating monooxygenase tyramine β-monooxygenase dopamine β-monooxygenase ascorbate tyramine β,β-dideuterated tyramine. peptidylglycine α-hydroxylating monooxygenase tyramine β-monooxygenase dopamine β-monooxygenase ascorbate tyramine β,β-dideuterated tyramine. All three of the copper hydroxylases employ two non-coupled, mononuclear Cu centers for oxygenase activity, termed CuM and CuH. Structural information pertaining to the active site of the enzymes is derived primarily from the crystal structure for PHM and extended X-ray absorption fine structure studies with both DβM and PHM (11Prigge S.T.

Chem. 1991; 266: 23120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each copper site assumes a unique coordination environment and a distinct mechanistic function. CuM serves as the site of dioxygen binding and activation, whereas the CuH site functions as an electron transfer site in the reaction mechanism (1Klinman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3013-3016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 14Blackburn N.J. Pettingill T.M. Trudie M. Seagraves K.S. Shigeta R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15383-15386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CuM site is coordinated by two histidine residues, a weakly bound methionine, and one or two water molecules, depending on the oxidation state. In the oxidized state, CuH is ligated by three histidine residues and a water molecule in a tetrahedral geometry. Loss of a water molecule at CuH accompanies reduction of the copper center, as for the CuM site. The ligands to both copper centers are fully conserved among all three enzymes. Although little structural information is available for TβM, the sequence and EPR spectra support an active site ligation identical to DβM and PHM (10Gray E.E. Small S.N. McGuirl M.A. Protein Expression Purif. 2006; 47: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A mechanism for substrate hydroxylation by this class of enzymes has been proposed based on extensive kinetic characterization of DβM and PHM (Scheme 2) (1Klinman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3013-3016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Product formation is coupled to the 2e– oxidation of substrate and the 4e– reduction of dioxygen to water, with one atom of O2 incorporated into the final product. The copper atoms supply the two remaining electrons for this process. Ascorbate is required as a co-substrate to regenerate the reduced Cu(I) form of enzyme during turnover, with 2 mol of ascorbate converted to semidehydroascorbate during the one-electron reduction of each Cu(II) site. In the absence of direct evidence for an ascorbate binding site, an outer sphere electron transfer to both CuM and CuH has appeared to be the most likely mechanism for the reductive process. In the oxidative half-reaction, dioxygen reacts with the reduced CuM center. The initial product of this reaction is believed to be a Cu(II)-superoxide species that subsequently abstracts a hydrogen atom from the bound substrate (15Evans J.P. Ahn K. Klinman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49691-49698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 16Chen P. Solomon E.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 4991-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). A long range electron transfer from CuH to CuM is required to complete the reaction cycle, leading to formation of the hydroxylated product (17Francisco W.A. Wille G. Smith A.J. Merkler D.J. Klinman J.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 13168-13169Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and reoxidation of both copper centers. Based on the high sequence similarity and initial reactivity studies (10Gray E.E. Small S.N. McGuirl M.A. Protein Expression Purif. 2006; 47: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the reaction mechanisms of DβM and TβM were predicted to be identical. The detailed kinetic characterization of TβM presented herein, including an examination of the dioxygen and ascorbate dependence in the oxygenase reaction and kinetic isotope effects, reveals several significant differences between the mechanisms of the insect TβM and the mammalian DβM. Substrate inhibition observed in the reaction mechanism of TβM implies tighter regulation of neurotransmitter levels by the insect enzyme. The dependence of the rate of TβM reduction by ascorbate on substrate level suggests, for the first time, a site for reductant binding within this class of enzymes. MaterialsDrosophila S2 cell growth medium was obtained from Invitrogen. Chromatography medium was purchased from GE Healthcare, except Talon affinity resin, which was purchased from BD Biosciences. 4-hydroxy-β,β-[2-2H2]phenethylamine hydrochloride (dideuterated tyramine) was synthesized as previously described (18Miller S.M. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2114-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and the deuterium content was verified by NMR. Catalase was purchased from Roche Applied Science. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Enzyme Preparation and PurificationTβM was expressed in Drosophila Schneider 2 (S2) cells (Invitrogen) according to methods described previously (10Gray E.E. Small S.N. McGuirl M.A. Protein Expression Purif. 2006; 47: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The protein was purified using anion exchange, His tag affinity, and size exclusion chromatography methods as reported (10Gray E.E. Small S.N. McGuirl M.A. Protein Expression Purif. 2006; 47: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), with the following modification. The TβM-containing DEAE fractions were dialyzed against 10 mm KPi + 0.25 m NaCl, pH 8.0, prior to binding to the Talon resin. Protein concentrations were determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm (ϵ280 = 1.34 ml mg–1 cm–1) using a monomer mass of 68,580 Da. Purified TβM (at 3–5 mg/ml) was frozen in 50–100-μl aliquots in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until further use. Enzyme Kinetic AssaysThe rates of oxygen consumption by TβM were measured on a Yellow Springs Instruments model 5300 biological oxygen electrode. Assay conditions were similar to those described previously in kinetic assays with DβM (19Stewart L.C. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5302-5309Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (1 ml) contained 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6), 0.1 m KCl (to maintain ionic strength), 2 μm CuSO4, and 40 μg/ml catalase, T = 35 °C. Assay mixtures for the measurement of enzyme specific activities contained 250 μm tyramine, 10 mm ascorbate, 0.16 μm TβM, and 222 μm oxygen (air-saturated). An average specific activity for TβM was determined for each set of experiments and used to standardize data collected over numerous days. The concentration of TβM in the assay solutions varied from 0.1 to 0.4 μm. The concentrations of tyramine (0.025–10 mm), ascorbate (2–200 mm) and dioxygen (11 μm to 1.067 mm) were otherwise varied as indicated under “Results.” The dioxygen concentration in assay solutions was varied by stirring reaction mixtures under a mixed O2/N2 atmosphere of the appropriate proportion for ∼10 min. The amount of dioxygen in solution was recorded as a voltage by the oxygen electrode and converted to units of molarity based on the known concentration of dissolved oxygen in air-saturated water (222 μm at 35 °C) or O2-saturated water (1067 μm at 35 °C). All reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme. Initial velocities of dioxygen consumption by the enzyme were corrected for the ascorbate background rate and fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation, using the program Kaleidagraph. In cases where substrate inhibition was observed, the data were fitted to Equation 1, which includes a term for the inhibition constant, Ki (20Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady State Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993: 273-345Google Scholar). v=kcat[ET][S]Km+S(1+S/Ki)(Eq. 1) The values for kcat and Km and Ki and errors in these values were derived from the resultant fits. The error in kcat/Km or KIE values was obtained through error propagation according to standard methods (21Miller S.M. Klinman J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 711-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Initial kinetic studies indicated that the reaction of TβM with tyramine followed simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics; a kcat of 1 s–1 and an apparent Km,tyr of 161 μm were reported (10Gray E.E. Small S.N. McGuirl M.A. Protein Expression Purif. 2006; 47: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Ferrocyanide was used as the reductant in these experiments. Ferrocyanide is an alternate electron donor for the copper monooxygenases and provides a convenient spectroscopic assay for determining enzyme activities (19Stewart L.C. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5302-5309Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, ascorbate is the anticipated in vivo reductant as reported for DβM and PHM (2Prigge S.T. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Amzel L.M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1236-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 19Stewart L.C. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5302-5309Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the present studies, all kinetics of TβM were pursued using ascorbate as the reductant. This allows the direct comparison of kinetic data obtained with TβM with values previously reported in the DβM and PHM reactions. The use of ascorbate also provides a frame of reference for understanding the physiological properties of TβM. Initial velocities were measured by the rate of O2 consumption by TβM at varied tyramine (25 μm to 10 mm) and 10 mm ascorbate in air-saturated solutions at 35 °C. From the fit of the data, the apparent Km for tyramine was determined as 87.6 ± 12.7 μm, comparable with the value reported previously for the ferrocyanide assays (10Gray E.E. Small S.N. McGuirl M.A. Protein Expression Purif. 2006; 47: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and to the Km obtained in previous activity assays of TβM-containing homogenates from different organisms, using ascorbate (8Lehman H.K. Schulz D.J. Barron A.B. Wraight L. Hardison C. Whitney S. Takeuchi H. Paul R.K. Robinson G.E. J. Exp. Biol. 2006; 209: 2774-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The maximum turnover rate under these conditions was calculated as 3.91 ± 0.22 s–1, ∼4-fold greater than the initial value reported. A surprising result was the decrease in rates observed at tyramine concentrations of >250 μm (Fig. 1A), indicative of substrate inhibition. This behavior was not evident in the preliminary studies using ferrocyanide; nor has substrate inhibition ever been demonstrated in kinetic studies with the analogous enzymes, DβM or PHM. The fit of the initial rate data to Equation 1 yielded an apparent substrate inhibition constant, Ki,tyr, of 3.5 ± 0.56 mm. The effect of fumarate on the reaction also was investigated, since fumarate acts as an anion activator in the DβM reaction mechanism (22Ahn N. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3096-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Consistent with the initial findings (10Gray E.E. Small S.N. McGuirl M.A. Protein Expression Purif. 2006; 47: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), fumarate had no effect, within experimental error, on either kcat, Km,tyr, or Ki,tyr and was subsequently omitted from all assay solutions. Ascorbate DependenceThe early kinetic characterization demonstrated a higher substrate specificity for TβM in comparison with DβM (10Gray E.E. Small S.N. McGuirl M.A. Protein Expression Purif. 2006; 47: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This fact and the comparatively low observed kcat value (DβM = 12.7 ± 0.5 s–1 (dopamine); PHM = 39.1 ± 0.5 s–1 (hippuric acid) (18Miller S.M. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2114-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 23Francisco W.A. Merkler D.J. Blackburn N.J. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8244-8252Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar)) prompted us to investigate the ascorbate dependence on the TβM reaction rates. Initial rates of oxygen consumption by the enzyme were measured as a function of tyramine, at fixed ascorbate concentrations ranging from 2 to 200 mm (Fig. 1B and Table 1). The rate of turnover, kobs, increases nearly 10-fold in this range, from a value of 1.3 s–1 at low ascorbate to a maximum value of 12 s–1 at 100 mm ascorbate. The latter value more closely approximates the substrate turnover rates determined for DβM. The effect of increasing ascorbate on kobs and Km,tyr results in a minor descending trend in the apparent kcat/Km,tyr (Table 1). However, with the exception of the data at 2 mm ascorbate, kcat/Km,tyr appears to be independent of ascorbate concentrations, indicative of a ping-pong mechanism, where ascorbate and tyramine interact with different forms of enzyme, Cu(II) and Cu(I), respectively. The slightly inflated value at 2 mm ascorbate probably reflects the poorer signal/noise ratio of the rate data at such low ascorbate concentrations.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters for TβM as a function of ascorbate; air-saturated solutions, 50 mm KPi, pH 6, 35 °CAscorbatekobsKm,tyrKi,tyrkcat/Km,tyr(app)mms-1μmmmmm-1 s-121.31 ± 0.1225.2 ± 6.92.1 ± 0.852 ± 1543.2 ± 0.296 ± 121.3 ± 0.233 ± 4.6103.91 ± 0.2288 ± 133.5 ± 0.5645 ± 7508.9 ± 0.3235 ± 134.15 ± 0.4137.8 ± 2.510011.9 ± 1.2367 ± 603.6 ± 1.132.4 ± 6.22008.5 ± 0.5265 ± 3610.3 ± 231.9 ± 4.7 Open table in a new tab Noteworthy is the effect of ascorbate on substrate inhibition. Increasing ascorbate attenuates the observed inhibition at high tyramine concentrations (Table 1). The tyramine Ki(app) varies from ∼1–2 mm at low ascorbate to 10 mm at high ascorbate. Since the role of ascorbate is to regenerate the reduced form of the enzyme during turnover, the effect of ascorbate on Ki,tyr implies that the inhibitory pathway is minimized when more enzyme is present in the reduced state. Initial velocity data were obtained in experiments with varied ascorbate (2–200 mm) at fixed tyramine concentrations ranging from 50 to 700 μm. The resultant fit of the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation provided an estimated limiting Km for ascorbate of ≥16 mm (Fig. 2 and Table 2). This value represents a lower approximation due to difficulties in attaining levels of saturating tyramine, as a result of the substrate inhibition. However, substrate inhibition is negligible in the chosen range of tyramine concentrations. The inhibitory region is already reached at 1 mm tyramine, regardless of the ascorbate concentration. Therefore, the Km,asc value obtained from these experiments provides a reasonable estimate.TABLE 2Kinetic parameters for TβM as a function of tyramine; air-saturated solutions, 50 mm KPi, pH 6, 35 °CTyraminekobsKm,ascKi,asckcat/Km,asc(app)μms-1mmmmm-1 s-1501.28 ± 0.070.93 ± 0.231.1 ± 0.71.38 ± 0.351002.27 ± 0.071.98 ± 0.261.8 ± 1.21.14 ± 0.163004.52 ± 0.175.6 ± 10.8 ± 0.157008.74 ± 0.2716.0 ± 1.80.55 ± 0.06 Open table in a new tab A small decrease in rates also is observed at high ascorbate concentrations. The kinetic data obtained at 300 and 700 μm tyramine can be fit easily to the Michaelis-Menten equation. However, at lower tyramine, the data are best fit to Equation 1 containing the additional term for Ki. Thus, although elevated ascorbate mitigates the observed inhibition by tyramine, the reductant itself can act as an inhibitor. The inhibition by ascorbate is not very strong, however, with a Ki,asc of >1 m even at low tyramine. A more significant trend is evident in the apparent kcat/Km,asc, which decreases by a factor of 2.5 in the range of tyramine concentrations examined, showing that high levels of tyramine interfere with the second order reaction between the Cu(II) form of TβM and reductant. A plot of Km/kcat,asc versus tyramine concentration yields a good correlation (r = 0.995) and an estimate for Ki,tyr = 0.43 mm in the limit of very low ascorbate. Oxygen DependenceThe kinetics of the reaction with tyramine at several fixed dioxygen concentrations in the range of 5–100% O2 subsequently were examined (cf. Fig. 3 for data in the presence of 10 mm ascorbate). These experiments allowed us to ascertain the dependence of the apparent kinetic parameters kcat, Km,tyr, and kcat/Km,tyr on dioxygen and to establish a Km for O2. The full range of oxygen-dependent kinetic studies focused on two different ascorbate concentrations, 10 and 50 mm (Table 3), since the dependence of the reaction rates on the reductant concentration already had been established.TABLE 3Kinetic parameters for TβM as a function of dioxygen at 10 and 50 mm ascorbate; 50 mm KPi, pH 6, 35 °COxygenkobsKm,tyrKi,tyrkcat/Km,tyr(app)μms-1μmmmmm-1 s-110 mm ascorbate data581.9 ± 0.194 ± 147.82 ± 1.4520.7 ± 3.31032.9 ± 0.17113 ± 153.33 ± 0.4725.5 ± 3.72123.9 ± 0.287.6 ± 12.73.5 ± 0.5644.7 ± 7.05125.7 ± 0.498 ± 152.07 ± 0.4258.1 ± 9.98859.8 ± 1.3159 ± 37.98 ± .2361.7 ± 16.410407.25 ± 0.9297.6 ± 25.71.23 ± 0.3274.3 ± 21.750 mm ascorbate data592.86 ± 0.09188 ± 1410.2 ± 1.115.4 ± 1.3995.86 ± 0.09215 ± 153.97 ± 0.4627.2 ± 1.92148.88 ± 0.27235 ± 13.54.15 ± 0.4137.8 ± 2.539511.5 ± 0.5242 ± 202.46 ± 0.2847.7 ± 4.560815.0 ± 1.5256 ± 421.9 ± 0.458.6 ± 11.385418.6 ± 2.7387 ± 901.57 ± 0.3848.2 ± 13.2104016.1 ± 1.3230 ± 342.03 ± 0.3270.0 ± 11.8 Open table in a new tab The apparent kcat was obtained from the fit of the initial velocity data as a function of tyramine, at each concentration of O2, to Equation 1. A plot of kcat(app) versus O2 (Fig. 4) demonstrates that the near maximal turnover rate is obtained in reactions with O2-saturated solutions. A value for Km,O2 was calculated as ∼350 μm (determined from the fit of k cat(app) versus O2 for data collected with tyramine as the substrate) (Fig. 4) and appears to be independent of ascorbate. This value is comparable with the Km,O2 obtained for DβM (18Miller S.M. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2114-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Increasing dioxygen results in a regular increase in the apparent kcat/Km,tyr, consistent with a ternary complex mechanism. Contrary to the effect of ascorbate, dioxygen amplifies substrate inhibition. Ki,tyr varies from 8 mm at 5% O2 (60 μm) to 1 mm at 98% O2 (850 μm) in reactions with 10 mm ascorbate. A 6-fold reduction in Ki,tyr is observed in experiments using 50 mm ascorbate. This result is consistent with the premise that elevated ascorbate concentrations diminish tyramine inhibition due to a decrease in the amount of oxidized enzyme present. In contrast to ascorbate, higher oxygen concentrations favor formation of the oxidized, Cu(II) form of the enzyme and result in greater inhibition via formation of the abortive, E-Cu(II)-tyramine complex. Kinetic Studies with Tyramine-d2To obtain further insight into the kinetic mechanism of TβM, initial velocities were measured as a function of dioxygen and dideuterated tyramine. A range of dideuterated tyramine concentrations (25 μm to 10 mm) and oxygen concentrations (60 μm to ∼1040 μm) were analogous to those in experiments with protiated tyramine. Data were collected at 10 and 50 mm ascorbate (Table 4). Replots of the data provided the limiting Dkcat = 2.58 ± 0.64 (10 mm ascorbate) and 2.75 ± 0.5 (50 mm ascorbate). A value of 1.85 ± 0.5 was calculated for Dkcat/Km,tyr (50 mm ascorbate, 97% O2). The substrate inhibition made it difficult to obtain Dkcat/Km,O2 with any great accuracy, but values appear to be in the range of values obtained for Dkcat/Km,tyr. The deuterium isotope effect on kcat appears somewhat larger than the Dkcat/Km value. These trends are different from DβM, where Dkcat < Dkcat/Km in the absence of the anionic activator (22Ahn N. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3096-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).TABLE 4Kinetic parameters for TβM as a function of dioxygen at 10 and 50 mm ascorbate, using β,β-dideuterated tyramine as substrate; 50 mm KPi, pH 6, 35 °COxygenKobsKm,tyr-d2Ki,tyr-d2kcat/Km,tyr-d2(app)μms-1μmmmmm-1 s-110 mm ascorbate data561.14 ± 0.17231 ± 673.35 ± 1.24.95 ± 1.61191.93 ± 0.15177 ± 292.8 ± 0.510.9 ± 22152.55 ± 0.26178 ± 362.1 ± 0.514.3 ± 3.33952.8 ± 0.4145 ± 432.4 ± 0.819.4 ± 6.45874.08 ± 0.68203 ± 591.25 ± 0.3820.1 ± 6.79073.57 ± 0.6390.6 ± 37.42.0 ± 0.939.4 ± 17.750 mm ascorbate data632.0 ± 0.1341 ± 377.4 ± 1.265.8 ± 0.71102.5 ± 0.2257 ± 436.0 ± 1.59.6 ± 1.82143.3 ± 0.2245 ± 327.8 ± 1.713.5 ± 1.94166.37 ± 0.5328 ± 442.8 ± 0.519.4 ± 35987.8 ± 0.7316 ± 523.3 ± 0.724.6 ± 4.69076.8 ± 0.7233 ± 474.0 ± 1.029.2 ± 6.510397.45 ± 0.7193 ± 372.86 ± 0.638.6 ± 8.2 Open table in a new tab An isotope effect on Ki,tyr is evident as well. A decrease in Ki is observed as a result of increasing oxygen in reaction mixtures containing deuterated tyramine, similar to the effect observed using protiated tyramine. However, the Ki value for tyramine-d2 displays a narrower range than Ki,tyr. Under conditions where dioxygen is increased by ∼16-fold (∼60 μm to 1 mm), Ki,tyr-d2 varies from 3 to 2 mm at 10 mm ascorbate and from 7 to 3 mm at 50 mm ascorbate. This represents a smaller decrease in Ki,tyr-d2, compared with the 6–8-fold decrease in Ki,tyr observed under analogous conditions. The isotope effect on Ki can be interpreted in the context of a reduced steady state concentration of the Cu(II) form of enzyme, due to the slower abstraction of deuterium from the labeled substrate and, hence, an elevated level of the E-Cu(I)-tyr-O2 complex. Oxidative MechanismThe TβM oxidative half-reaction seems to proceed in accord with the mechanisms established for the mammalian enzymes, as determined from isotope effect studies. An isotope effect on kcat of ∼2.7 indicates that hydrogen abstraction from the substrate is partially rate-limiting, as demonstrated for DβM and PHM (23Francisco W.A. Merkler D.J. Blackburn N.J. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8244-8252Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 24Miller S.M. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3091-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Values for Dkcat/Km,tyr appear to be virtually independent of ascorbate, which again points to an irreversible step separating reduction of the enzyme and the subsequent chemistry. A plot of the dependence of Dkcat/Km,tyr on dioxygen is shown in Fig. 5 as a compilation of data at 50 mm ascorbate. Although the errors are fairly large, there is a decreasing trend as the O2 concentration increases from ∼60 μm to 1 mm. The fact that Dkcat/Km,tyr remains above unity at the highest oxygen concentration is consistent with an ability of tyramine to dissociate from the E-Cu(II)-tyr-O2 complex (21Miller S.M. Klinman J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 711-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The intercepts of the 1/v versus 1/O2 reciprocal plots at varied tyramine intersect to the left of the 1/v axis (Fig. 6 for 50 mm ascorbate data), in support of a random mechanism where either tyramine or O2 can bind first to the reduced enzyme. It would appear that there is no obligatory binding of substrate before O2 in the TβM reaction. The observed dependence of Dkcat/Km,tyr on O2 also is consistent with a random mechanism. The full expression for the isotope effect in a random kinetic mechanism is illustrated in Scheme 3 and Equation 2, where k5H/k5D = Int represents the intrinsic isotope effect (25Klinman J.P.

Methodology/Principal Findings Here we used genetic and pharmacologic approaches to elucidate the transcriptomes of NSCLC cell lines. We transcriptionally profiled a panel of EGFR-mutant and -wild-type NSCLC cell lines cultured in the presence or absence of an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Hierarchical analysis revealed that the cell lines segregated on the basis of EGFR mutational status (mutant versus wild-type), and expression signatures were identified by supervised analysis that distinguished the cell lines based on mutational status (wild-type versus mutant) and type of mutation (L858R versus Δ746-750). Using an EGFR mutation-specific expression signature as a probe, we mined the gene expression profiles of two independent cohorts of NSCLC patients and found the signature in a subset. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment regulated the expression of multiple genes, and pharmacologic inhibition of the protein products of two of them (PTGS2 and EphA2) inhibited anchorage-independent growth in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells. Conclusions/Significance We have elucidated genes not previously associated with EGFR-mutant NSCLC, two of which enhanced the clonogenicity of these cells, distinguishing these mediators from others previously shown to maintain cell survival. These findings have potential clinical relevance given the availability of pharmacologic tools to inhibit the protein products of these genes."
https://openalex.org/W2007723586,"The function of HIV-1 HXB2 envelope (Env) glycoprotein (gp) was investigated by surface plasmon resonance and fluorescence imaging techniques. Strikingly, it was found that gp120 shedding requires the presence of the X4 coreceptor. A similar coreceptor requirement was observed for the membrane mixing and the Env recruitment on the cell surface. However, exposure and membrane penetration of the fusion peptide do not require X4 and occur within the first minute after incubation of Env with CD4 and/or X4. Analogously X4 was not required but enhanced binding of the fusion inhibitor. In contrast, bundle formation of the gp41 ectodomain, as monitored by NC-1, was accelerated by the presence of X4. The kinetics of these key post-Env binding events as determined in real time by fluorescence microscopic imaging, coupled with the differential coreceptor requirement, led to the proposition that gp120 shedding, which takes place from 1 to 10 min after engagement of receptor and coreceptor to Env, is a primary function of the coreceptor. The shedding of the surface subunits is needed for the subsequent processes including hemifusion, full fusion, and Env recruitment. The temporal order of these fusogenic steps allows construction of a refined model on the Env-mediated cell fusion event."
https://openalex.org/W1999983764,"We investigated structural and functional properties of bovine cytochrome P450 steroid 21-hydroxylase (P450c21), which catalyzes hydroxylation at C-21 of progesterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone. The uncoupled H2O2 formation was higher in the hydroxylation of progesterone (26% of NADPH consumed) than that of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone (15% of NADPH consumed), indicating that 17α-hydroxyprogesterone can better facilitate the O–O bond scission. In relation to this, it is noted that the O–O stretching mode (νO–O) of the oxygen complex of P450c21 was sensitive to the substrate; the progesterone- or 17α-hydroxyprogesterone-bound enzyme gave single (at 1137 cm–1) or split νO–O bands (at 1124 and 1138 cm–1), respectively, demonstrating the presence of two forms for the latter. In contrast to νO–O, no corresponding difference was observed for the Fe-O2 stretching mode between two different substrate-bound forms. The Fe-S(Cys) stretching mode in the ferric state was also identical (349 cm–1) for each substrate-bound form, suggesting that modulation through the axial thiolate by the substrate is unlikely. Therefore, it is deduced that the hydroxyl group at C-17 of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone forms a hydrogen bond with the terminal oxygen atom of the FeOO complex in one form, yielding a lower νO–O frequency with higher reactivity for O–O cleavage, whereas the other form in which the substrate does not provide a hydrogen bond to the oxygen ligand is essentially the same between the two kinds of substrates.

P450c21 catalyzes hydroxylation at C-21 of progesterone (Prog) and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OH-prog) to produce 11-deoxycorticosterone and 11-deoxycortisol, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1. These C-21 hydroxylation steps are essential for the biosynthesis of aldosterone and cortisol. Deficiency in P450c21 found in ∼1:10,000 newborn babies results in impaired steroid synthesis in which adrenal androgens are overproduced in addition to the lack of aldosterone and cortisol, as shown in Fig. 1 (3White P.C. Speiser P.W. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 245-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). The P450c21 deficiency accounts for more than 90% of a common genetic disease, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, with symptoms of salt wasting, simple virilizing, and nonclassical phenotypes (3White P.C. Speiser P.W. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 245-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). The enzyme deficiency can be attributed to mutations in the CYP21B gene encoding P450c21 (4White P.C.

The structural and functional studies have been carried out with use of bovine P450c21 purified from adrenal cortex (6Kominami S. Ochi H. Kobayashi Y. Takemori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3386-3394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). P450c21 shows higher hydroxylation activity with 17-OH-prog than that of Prog in the steady state condition (7Higuchi A. Kominami S. Takemori S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1084: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Subsequent mechanistic study by Kominami et al. (8Kominami S. Owaki A. Iwanaga T.

Chem. 2001; 276: 10753-10758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) found that the rate-limiting step was different in the hydroxylation reactions of two substrates and proposed that this difference could cause higher reactivity with 17-OH-prog in P450c21. However, from the structural viewpoint, the difference between the two physiological substrate-bound forms has been poorly understood. Although the sample purified from bovine adrenal cortex was stable in the presence of detergents or lipids, its hydrophobic nature and difficulty in obtaining qualities of the purified samples have hampered further mechanistic and structural studies. Actually, despite the fact that P450c21 is known as the first functional P450 (9Estabrook R.W. Cooper D.Y. Rosenthal O. Biochem. Z. 1963; 338: 741-755PubMed Google Scholar), the structure-based study on P450c21 has hardly progressed. Recently, Kagawa et al. (10Arase M. Waterman M.R. Kagawa N. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In this study, we attempted to elucidate the structure-function relationship in P450c21 by using the high quality sample purified from the E. coli expression system. To get insight into the functional property of P450c21, we estimated the uncoupled H2O2 formation during the hydroxylation of two different physiological substrates, which should reflect efficiency of the step of O–O bond scission (14Nickerson D.P.

To examine the structural properties related to the function, we characterized the environment of the heme of P450c21 with and without the substrate by using resonance Raman (RR) spectroscopy, a powerful tool to explore the environment of the heme in the solution state (18Uchida T. Kitagawa T. Acc. Chem. Res. 2005; 38: 662-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 19Rousseau D.L. Li D. Couture M. Yeh S.R. J. Inorg.

We found that there was less H2O2 production in the hydroxylation of 17-OH-prog than that of Prog and that the νO–O mode of the oxygen complex of P450c21 (oxy-P450c21) was sensitive to the structure of the substrate. On the basis of the current data, we discuss the factor determining the structural and functional difference between two physiological substrate-bound P450c21s. Sample Preparation–The E. coli expression and purification of the N-terminal membrane anchor truncated bovine P450c21 with His tag were carried out according to a previous report (10Arase M. Waterman M.R. Kagawa N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 344: 400-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The purified ferric substrate-free P450c21 in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 20% glycerol, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1.0% sodium cholate was stored at –80 °C. Each substrate (Prog or 17-OH-prog) was dissolved in 45% (w/v) 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin in water as a ∼20 mm stock solution. Spectroscopic Measurements–UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded on a Lambda 18 UV-visible spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or U-3310 spectrophotometer (Hitachi). Substrates (50 μl of the stock solution) were added to 450 μl of the substrate-free P450c21 (10 μm) solution to generate the substrate-bound ferric forms. Ferrous P450c21 was prepared by the addition of 10 μl of ∼20 mm sodium dithionite solution to ferric P450c21 under unaerobic condition. Oxy-P450c21 was prepared according to the method for the preparation of the oxygen adduct of P450cam (21Peterson J.A. Ishimura Y. Griffin B.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 149: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In brief, oxy-P450c21 was produced by mixing ferrous P450c21 (20Smulevich G. Feis A. Howes B.D. Acc. Chem. Res. 2005; 38: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar μm), which was prepared by a minimal addition of ∼20 mm sodium dithionite solution to ferric P450c21 with equal volume of air-saturated buffer on ice. The measurements of optical absorption spectra were performed at room temperature for the ferric and ferrous samples and at 4 °C for oxy-P450c21. RR spectra were obtained with a single polychrometer (Jobin Yvon SPEX750M) equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled CCD detector (Spec10:400B/LN; Roper Scientific). The 406.7- and 413.1-nm lines from a Kr+ laser (BeamLok 2060; Spectra Physics) and the 363.8-nm line from an Ar+ laser (BeamLok 2080; Spectra Physics) were used for the Raman excitation. Raman shifts were calibrated with indene, acetone, and carbon tetrachloride. All of the measurements were performed at ∼4°C with a quartz spinning cell (2000 rpm). The Raman samples were prepared by a method similar to those for the UV-visible absorption measurements except for oxy-P450c21. Oxy-P450c21 for the Raman measurement was prepared by incorporation of oxygen gas (16O2 or 18O2) into the Raman cell containing ferrous P450c21 after its degassing on ice. The sample concentration was adjusted to 20 μm. Enzymatic Activity–The formation of H2O2 from the uncoupling reaction of P450 was determined as described (22Jameson G.N. Jin W. Krebs C. Perreira A.S. Tavares P. Liu X. Theil E.C. Huynh B.H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13435-13443Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. The reaction mixture (100 μl) containing P450c21 (2.2 μm), NADPH-dependent P450 reductase (1.5 μm), 2.5 mm Prog or 17-OH-prog, 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 20% glycerol, and 0.025% Cymal 5 was preincubated at 30 °C for 2 min. The hydroxylation reaction was initiated with the addition of NADPH (final 50–200 μm). After a 5-min reaction at 30 °C, 20 μl of reaction mixture was transferred, mixed with 0.5 μl of 20% SDS and 0.5 μl of 10 mg/ml proteinase K, and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The mixture was added with a 140 μl H2O2 assay solution that contains 200 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 200 mm sodium chloride, 5 mm 4-aminoantipyrine, 10 mm vanillic acid, and 40 units/ml horseradish peroxidase. The formation of a red quinone imine dye (ϵ490 = 6.99 mm–1 cm–1) was measured by optical spectroscopy. The consumption of NADPH was confirmed by monitoring the absorption at 340 nm (ϵ340 = 6.21 mm–1 cm–1). Uncoupled H2O2 Formation by P450c21–A previous study by Arase et al. (10Arase M. Waterman M.R. Kagawa N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 344: 400-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) demonstrated that bovine P450c21 shows different reactivity with its alternative substrates, Prog and 17-OH-prog, under the steady state condition but provides no information on the elementary steps. Here, to further characterize the enzymatic property in terms of the reactivity with different substrates, the efficiency of the hydroxylation for Prog and 17-OH-prog was estimated by the amount of H2O2 from the uncoupling reaction of P450c21. Fig. 2 displays the formation of H2O2 against NADPH consumed during the hydroxylation of Prog or 17-OH-prog by P450c21. As seen in Fig. 2, NADPH was more efficiently consumed for the 21-hydroxylation of 17-OH-prog compared with that of Prog. Under the experimental conditions, the percentage of uncoupled H2O2 formation per NADPH consumption was 26 ± 1.1 and 15 ± 0.7% for Prog and 17-OH-prog, respectively. 17-OH-prog is a better substrate for P450c21 than Prog from the catalytic coupling with consumption of NADPH. Raman Characterization of Ferric P450c21–To elucidate the reason for the different reactivity with two substrates, Prog and 17-OH-prog, in bovine P450c21, we explored the heme active site structure of P450c21 with the substrates along the catalytic cycle. Because the first step of the P450-catalyzed reaction is the binding of the substrate to the ferric enzyme (23Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. 3rd Ed. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York2005Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar), we have focused on the characterization of the environment of the heme of ferric P450c21 with Prog and 17-OH-prog as well as the substrate-free form by RR spectroscopy. Fig. 3A displays the high frequency region of RR spectra for ferric P450c21 in the absence and presence of the substrates with 406.7-nm excitation. The assignments (Table 1) of the porphyrin marker lines, ν4, ν3, ν2, and ν10, sensitive to the oxidation state, spin state, and coordination structure (24Abe M. Kitagawa T. Kyogoku Y. J. Chem.

Kagawa N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 344: 400-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), substrate-free ferric heme adopts a six-coordinate/low spin structure, which is indicated by the ν4, ν3, ν2, and ν10 modes at 1371, 1501, 1581, and 1637 cm–1, respectively. A water molecule probably ligates to the heme as a sixth ligand in the substrate-free enzyme.TABLE 1Frequencies (cm-1) of the heme marker lines for P450c21Samplev4v3v2v10StateFerric P450c21 Substrate-free1371150115811637Six-coordinate/low spinWith Prog1368aThe v4 line for the five-coordinate/high spin state was detected at 1368 cm-1 upon excitation at 363.8 nm (data not shown).

Kagawa N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 344: 400-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the binding of Prog or 17-OH-prog induces the structural transition of the heme from six-coordinate/low spin to five-coordinate/high spin, which was evident from the appearance of the Raman lines at 1487, 1567, and 1624 cm–1 assignable to ν3, ν2, and ν10 modes, respectively, for a five-coordinate/high spin heme (Fig. 3A, b and c). It should be noted here that the six-coordinate/low spin heme is still observed in Prog-bound P450c21 (Fig. 3A, b), contrary to the almost complete spin conversion observed in 17-OH-prog-bound P450c21 (Fig. 3A, c). Further addition of Prog to the enzyme did not increase the population of the high spin species (data not shown), suggesting that the remaining low spin species did not arise from the substrate-free enzyme. It is plausible that the additional 17-hydroxyl group in 17-OH-prog could be in proximity to the water ligand and facilitate the dissociation of the water ligand from the heme iron. Raman lines observed in the low frequency region involve the bending vibrations of heme peripheral groups as well as the porphyrin skeletal vibrations (28Hu S. Morris I.K. Singh J.P. Smith K.M. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 12446-12458Crossref Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 29Hu S. Smith K.M. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1997-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). On the basis of the complete assignment for myoglobin (29Hu S. Smith K.M. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 12638-12646Crossref Scopus (473) Google Scholar), the Raman lines at 344, 379, 423, and 676 cm–1 were assigned to the ν8, δ(CβCcCd) (bending mode of the heme propionate groups), δ(CβCaCb) (bending mode of the heme vinyl groups), and ν7 modes, respectively, for substrate-free P450c21 (Fig. 3B, a). As seen in Fig. 3B (b), the binding of substrate, Prog, did not alter the peak positions of the bending vibrations of heme peripheral groups. In addition, the spectrum for 17-OH-prog-bound P450c21 is almost indistinguishable from that of Prog-bound P450c21 (Fig. 3B (c)). The substrate binding would not perturb the structure of the heme peripheral group in ferric P450c21. The iron-thiolate stretching vibration (νFe–S) was reported to be also detectable in the low frequency region around ∼350 cm–1 for ferric five-coordinate/high spin species upon excitation at the iron-thiolate charge-transfer band (33Champion P.M. Stallard B.R. Wagner G.C. Gunsalus I.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 5469-5472Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 34Bangcharoenpaurpong O. Champion P.M. Hall K.S. Hager L.P. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2374-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The νFe–S mode should serve as a structural marker at the heme proximal site. Fig. 4 displays the low frequency region of the RR spectra for ferric P450c21 in the absence and presence of the substrates with 363.8-nm excitation corresponding to the ironthiolate charge transfer band. The intensities of almost all Raman lines were drastically decreased upon 363.8-nm excitation in the substrate-free form (Fig. 4a) as compared with that with 406.7 nm excitation (Fig. 3A, a). In contrast to this, a new Raman line at 349 cm–1 was detected for substrate-bound P450c21 (Fig. 4, b and c). This Raman line at 349 cm–1 was not observed by 406.7-nm excitation as shown in Fig. 4 (inset). The fact that the Raman line at 349 cm–1 was detectable only with 363.8-nm excitation for the five-coordinate/high spin heme enables us to assign this Raman line to the νFe–S mode. The νFe–S mode at 349 cm–1 is within the range of those of P450s (νFe–S = 344 ∼356 cm–1) (13Tosha T. Kagawa N. Ohta T. Yoshioka S. Waterman M.R. Kitagawa T. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5631-5640Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 27Chen Z. Ost T.W. Schelvis J.P.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2542-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and higher than those of nitric oxide synthases (NOSs) (νFe–S = 337–342 cm–1) (36Schelvis J.P. Berka V. Babcock G.T. Tsai A.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5695-5701Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 37Santolini J. Roman M. Stuehr D.J. Mattioli T.A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 1480-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The environment around the axial thiolate ligand of P450c21 could be of the typical P450 type. It should be stressed that the νFe–S mode was insensitive to the structures of the substrates. We therefore suggest that the environment around the proximal thiolate ligand is essentially the same between Prog- and 17-OH-prog-bound ferric P450c21. Raman Characterization of Ferrous P450c21–In the catalytic cycle of P450, the substrate-induced structural transition from the six-coordinate/low spin form to the five-coordinate/high spin form would elevate the redox potential of the heme, allowing the ferric enzyme to accept an electron to generate a ferrous enzyme (23Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. 3rd Ed. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York2005Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The ferrous state is the next target for the characterization of the environment of the heme. Although the substrate-free ferrous enzyme is off the pathway for catalysis, we examine its environment of the heme for comparison with that of the substrate-bound enzyme. Despite the addition of an ∼100-fold molar excess amount of dithionite to ferric substrate-free P450c21, we could not obtain a completely reduced form of P450c21 but produced a partially reduced form, as judged from the absorption spectrum (data not shown). Therefore, the RR spectrum of ferrous substrate-free P450c21 (Fig. 5a) was obtained by subtracting the contribution of the ferric enzyme. The ν4 vibration is observed in the lower frequency at 1344 cm–1 than those of other heme proteins whose axial ligand is histidine (ν4; 1354–1359 cm–1), indicating a strong Fe2+dπ back bonding to the porphyrin ring and a presence of the strong electron donation from axial thiolate to the heme iron (38Ozaki Y. Kitagawa T. Kyogoku Y. Imai Y. Hashimoto-Yutsudo C. Sato R. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 5826-5831Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The ν3, ν2, and ν10 modes at 1467, 1561, and 1602 cm–1, respectively, indicate that the heme adopts a five-coordinate/high spin structure and is typical of P450 in the ferrous state (26Wells A.V. Li P. Champion P.M. Martinis S.A. Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4384-4393Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 27Chen Z. Ost T.W. Schelvis J.P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1798-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The substrate-bound forms were easily reduced by the addition of dithionite solution. As reported in the P450cam study (39Sligar S.G. Gunsalus I.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 1078-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), the redox potential of the Fe3+/Fe2+ couple of the substrate-bound form with a high spin heme is supposed to be higher than that of the substrate-free form with a low spin heme. The RR spectra of both ferrous Prog- and 17-OH-prog-bound P450c21 are superimposable to that of substrate-free P450c21 (Fig. 5A) and are characteristic of ferrous five-coordinate/high spin heme. There is no clear difference between the RR spectra of Prog- and 17-OH-prog-bound ferrous P450c21s. We also measured the low frequency region of the RR spectra for ferrous P450c21 (Fig. 5B). As described above, the RR spectrum of ferrous substrate-free P450c21 was obtained by subtracting the contribution of the ferric enzyme. The ν8, δ(CβCcCd) (bending mode of the heme propionate groups), δ(CβCaCb) (bending mode of the heme vinyl groups) and ν7 modes were observed at 347, 381, ∼410, and 677 cm–1, respectively, for ferrous substrate-free P450c21. Contrary to the ferric state, the Raman lines observed in the low frequency region were shifted by substrate binding, as shown in Fig. 5B. Because the δ(CβCaCb) mode is sensitive to the hydrogen bonding interaction between heme propionate groups and surroundings (31Peterson E.S. Friedman J.M. Chien E.Y. Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12301-12319Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 32Hildebrand D.P. Burk D.L. Maurus R. Ferrer J.C. Brayer G.D. Mauk A.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1997-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the substrate-induced downshift of the δ(CβCaCb) mode by 5 cm–1 indicates that the substrate could alter the environment around the heme peripheral groups in the ferrous state. The substrate-induced frequency shifts were also detected in the δ(CβCaCb) mode. In the substrate-bound form, the δ(CβCaCb) modes were observed at 408 and 419 cm–1, whereas the peak position was ∼410 cm–1 in substrate-free P450c21. These observations indicate that the substrate affects the environment of the heme peripheral groups in the ferrous state but not in the ferric state. Although this oxidation state-dependent response to the substrate binding is an interesting issue, we have no clear explanation for it at this moment. On the basis of the fact that the substrate approaches closer to the heme iron upon reduction from the ferric to ferrous state in CYP102 (40Modi S. Sutcliffe M.J. Primrose W.U. Lian L.Y. Roberts G.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), we"
