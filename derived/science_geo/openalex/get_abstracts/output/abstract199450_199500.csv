A test to confirm the usefulness of the method in the field was made in January 1957, with Glossina swynnertoni Austen, at Shinyanga, Lake Province, Tanganyika."

https://openalex.org/W2081512359,"A LARGE number of mutations (more than 20) have been demonstrated in the complex locus T in linkage group IX of the house mouse1. Those mutations which have been studied embryologically appear to affect processes concerned with the formation and subsequent differentiation of the notochord–mesoderm system and its developmental dependent, the neural tube. The T\T embryos develop essentially normally through early somite stages, but at about the 4-somite stage there begin prothannic changes which result in an embryo entirely lacking the posterior portion of the body, and having no notochord, only remnants of somites and a neural tube both structurally and cellularly abnormal. This condition is clearly due to some interference with the processes of axial organization, but it has been impossible to define with descriptive methods which of these developmentally related structures is primarily affected by the mutation."

https://openalex.org/W2006188170,"WHEN diaphragm muscle is suspended in oxygenated Krebs solution at 38° C., it remains viable for many hours. Analysis, however, has shown that prolonged immersion of the muscle in physiological saline is associated with a small loss of potassium from the tissue and a considerable increase in sodium1. Preliminary experiments suggested that this increase in tissue sodium could be largely avoided if the muscle was suspended in rat serum instead of in saline. Later, reconstituted human freeze-dried serum was found to be as effective as rat serum, and has been used in the experiments reported here."
https://openalex.org/W2046024928,A FUNDAMENTAL problem of biochemistry is the mechanism by which the sequence of amino-acids in peptides and proteins is determined. We are studying the formation by Bacillus brevis of gramicidin-S—a cyclic decapeptide in which the sequence valyl–ornithyl-leucyl-D-phenylalanyl-prolyl occurs twice1.

https://openalex.org/W1995093383,"IN the course of study of the factors responsible for the low recoveries of chlorpromazine from brain tissue, it was observed that N sodium hydroxide, which is commonly used in the extraction procedure1,2, caused singular changes which could be followed spectrophotometrically. Readings at 2750 A., an absorption peak characteristic of chlorpromazine, steadily decreased with time, accompanied by immediate increased readings at 2750 A., which is characteristic of the sulphoxide2. These latter readings reached a maximum within 10–15 min., and began to decrease progressively, indicating further changes in the molecule (Fig. 1). No such changes were evidenced in 0.05 N sodium hydroxide (final concentration)."

https://openalex.org/W1985404574,"As results of various surveys on the occurrence of hæmoglobinopathies in different countries become available it appears that the number of carriers of one of these hereditary aberrations is relatively high among the populations of many countries: Central and North Africa, Italy, Greece, the Middle Eastern countries, Iran, India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Burma, Thailand and Indonesia. In many of these countries malaria is common. There are positive indications that the presence of hæmoglobins S and F lowers the mortality-rate of young children infected with malaria. For the other abnormal hæmoglobins such a relation has not yet been established. Lie Injo Luan Eng1 found among the Sudanese and Javanese populations of Java respectively that 2.5 and 4.5 per cent were carriers of hæmoglobin E. Lehmann et al.2 found 13.1 and 5 per cent respectively in the Malaysian Malays of two districts. In the Dyaks of Sarawak the number of hæmoglobin E carriers was found to be very low3. Farther east, in the Celebes, the percentage of carriers of hæmoglobin E was found to be low (1 per cent). Lie Injo Luan Eng1 and Lehmann et al.4 found no abnormal hæmoglobin in the Australian aborigines."

https://openalex.org/W2086868802,"IN a recent communication, Marsh and Thompson1 showed that strips of sheep muscle frozen before the onset of rigor mortis could be made to shorten by different amounts by varying the rate of thawing. They further showed that if the muscle shortened by more than 50 per cent of its original length it exuded much fluid, and they concluded that the cell membranes had been ruptured by the excessive contraction, the muscle entering what has been called the delta state."

A large amount of light is lost in this way, and Doncaster2 noted that with high powers (4-mm. objective) of the microscope, high-speed film had to be used with the consequent disadvantage of large grain. In the method to be described, the electronic flash as illuminant is incorporated in an optical bench and an attempt has been made to concentrate the flash on to the microscope mirror so that fairly critical illumination is attained."
https://openalex.org/W1964983835,"Bensley and Hoerr1 showed in 1934 that a certain proportion of the cytoplasm of animal cells was insoluble in salt solutions. More recently, Smith and his collaborators2 have shown that as much as 45 per cent of the material which remains after liver cells have been repeatedly extracted with molar salt solutions is lipid; they suggest that this is a complex lipo-protein. Histochemical studies, using sudan colouring agents and the acid haematein test for phospholipids, do not seem to indicate the presence of such large amounts of reactive lipids in many cells. These tests do not, however, exclude the possibility that the lipid is present in a ‘masked’ condition, a fact which was recognized by Ciaccio3, who published techniques for detecting lipids when they are combined with other substances."
https://openalex.org/W2027187094,"THE bacterial L forms, which may arise when normal bacteria are subjected to an unusual or unfavourable environment, are highly pleomorphic: they may consist of granular, vesicular and branched structures. Probably the L forms (reviewed by, among others, Klieneberger-Nobel1, Dienes and Weinberger2 and Tulasne3) have a structural organization that is different in several respects from that of normal bacteria. Thus some workers2,3 have described composite structures in L forms consisting of granular elements inside large vesicles. According to Klieneberger-Nobel4 these granules may fuse with each other. Tulasne3 assumes that the various morphological structures found in cultures of bacterial L forms represent stages of a complicated life-cycle. This has, however, been questioned by other investigators5,6. The observations reported below may be of some interest in connexion with a general discussion of the nature of the bacterial L forms."

https://openalex.org/W2000615665,"MORE than half the total acidity of milk is due to casein. This casein, which occurs in the form of calcium caseinate, can be removed by curdling the milk with rennet. The amount of calcium bound to casein is related to the acidity of the milk; the higher the acidity, the lower the calcium content of the casein. We therefore conclude that the casein content can be determined on the basis of milk acidity and of acidity of whey obtained by rapid precipitation of the calcium caseinate with rennet; it will be proportional to the difference between total milk acidity and acidity of whey. Moreover, for a given milk in which the casein content does not change, this difference will be higher, the higher the milk acidity at the moment of adding rennet. Hence the coefficient used for multiplying the difference between milk and whey acidity for determining the casein content must be lower the higher the acidity of the milk under investigation. This determination should not be affected by the development of microflora in the milk (as is the case with the formol method), since amino- and carboxyl-groups are liberated equally."
