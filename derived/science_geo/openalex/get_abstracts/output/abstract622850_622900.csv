https://openalex.org/W2902555008,"The DNA mutation produced by cellular repair of a CRISPR-Cas9-generated double-strand break determines its phenotypic effect. It is known that the mutational outcomes are not random, but depend on DNA sequence at the targeted location. Here we systematically study the influence of flanking DNA sequence on repair outcome by measuring the edits generated by >40,000 guide RNAs (gRNAs) in synthetic constructs. We performed the experiments in a range of genetic backgrounds and using alternative CRISPR-Cas9 reagents. In total, we gathered data for >109 mutational outcomes. The majority of reproducible mutations are insertions of a single base, short deletions or longer microhomology-mediated deletions. Each gRNA has an individual cell-line-dependent bias toward particular outcomes. We uncover sequence determinants of the mutations produced and use these to derive a predictor of Cas9 editing outcomes. Improved understanding of sequence repair will allow better design of gene editing experiments."

Although astrocytes are poised to integrate signals from synapses and the vasculature to perform their functional roles, it remains unclear what dictates astrocyte responses during neurovascular coupling under realistic conditions. We examined peri-arteriole and peri-capillary astrocytes in the barrel cortex of active mice in response to sensory stimulation or volitional behaviors. We observed an AMPA and NMDA receptor-dependent elevation in astrocyte endfoot Ca2+ that followed functional hyperemia onset. This delayed astrocyte Ca2+ signal was dependent on the animal's action at the time of measurement as well as a neurovascular pathway that linked to endothelial-derived nitric oxide. A similar elevation in endfoot Ca2+ was evoked using vascular chemogenetics or optogenetics, and opto-stimulated dilation recruited the same nitric oxide pathway as functional hyperemia. These data show that behavioral state and microvasculature influence astrocyte Ca2+ in active mice. VIDEO ABSTRACT."
https://openalex.org/W2903324234,"Past research suggests that religion and science may conflict on which is a better tool for explaining the world. This conflict implies that religiosity might negatively impact both attitudes toward science and science knowledge. However, past research has focused mostly on religious affiliation and has not consistently identified such a relation using a general religiosity measure that assesses religious beliefs and religious practice. Using two large, nationally representative datasets as well as two original datasets, and controlling for relevant demographic variables, four studies (N = 9,205) showed that general measures of religiosity are negatively associated with science knowledge, a relation that was partially mediated by an association between religiosity and negative attitudes toward science. Study 2 also showed that parents' reports about their religiosity and its role in their children's upbringing predicted, some 20 years later, their children's attitudes toward science. The studies are correlational but the longitudinal relations in Study 2 suggests that religiosity might undermine science literacy."
https://openalex.org/W2903505766,"Persian or English walnut (Juglans regia L.), the walnut species cultivated for nut production, is one of the oldest food sources known and is grown worldwide in temperate areas. France is the 7th leading producer as of 2016 with 39 kt. Deciphering walnut genetic diversity and structure is important for efficient management and use of genetic resources. In this work, 253 worldwide accessions from the INRA walnut germplasm collection, containing English walnut and several related species, were genotyped using 13 SSR (Single Sequence Repeat) markers selected from the literature to assess diversity and structure. Genetic diversity parameters showed a deficiency of heterozygotes and, for several SSRs, allele-specificities among the accessions tested. Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) showed the 253 accessions clustered in largely in agreement with the existing botanical classification of the genus. Among the 217 J. regia accessions, two main clusters, accessions from Eastern Europe and Asia, and accessions from Western Europe and America, were identified using STRUCTURE software. This was confirmed by Principal Coordinate Analysis and supported by Neighbor-Joining tree construction using DARwin software. Moreover, a substructure was found within the two clusters, mainly according to geographical origin. A core collection containing 50 accessions was selected using the maximum length sub-tree method and prior knowledge about their phenotype. The present study constitutes a preliminary population genetics overview of INRA walnut genetic resources collection using SSR markers. The resulting estimations of genetic diversity and structure are useful for germplasm management and for future walnut breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W2902937687,"The present work determines the chemical and thermal characteristics as well as the phytochemical and antioxidant potential of the polar extractives of the Picea abies bark from an industrial mill, their wood and bark components and also different bark fractions obtained by mechanical fractionation (fine B1, Φ<0.180 mm, medium B3, 0.450 < Φ<0.850 mm and coarse B6, 2 < Φ<10 mm). The aim is to increase the knowledge on the Picea abies bark to better determine possible uses other than burning for energy production and to test an initial size reduction process to achieve fractions with different characteristics. Compared to wood, bark presented similar lignin (27%), higher mineral (3.9% vs 0.4%) and extractives (20.3% vs 3.8%) and lower polysaccharides (48% vs 71%) contents. Regarding bark fractions the fines showed higher ash (6.3%), extractives (25%) and lignin (29%) than the coarse fraction (3.9%, 19% and 25% respectively). Polysaccharide contents increased with particle size of the bark fractions (38% vs 52% for B1 and B6) but showed the same relative composition. The phytochemical profile of ethanol and water extracts presented higher contents for bark than wood of total phenols (2x higher), flavonoids (3x higher) and tannins (4-10x higher) with an increasing tendency with particle size. Bark antioxidant activity was higher than that of wood for ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP, 10 vs 6 mmolFe2+/gExt for the ethanol extract) and free radical scavenging activity (DPPH, 6 vs 18 mg/L IC50 for the ethanol extract) methods. The different bark fractions antioxidant activity was very similar. Bark thermal properties showed a much lower volatiles to fixed carbon ratio (V/FC) than wood (3.1 vs 5.2) although the same higher heating value (20.3 MJ/kg). The fractions were quite similar. Bark presented chemical features that point to their possible upgrade, whether by taking advantage of the high extractives with bioactive compounds or the production potential for hemicellulose-derived oligomers with possible use in nutraceutical and pharmaceutical industries."
https://openalex.org/W2902225857,"Accumulating evidence suggests that the abnormal aggregation of amyloid-β (Αβ) peptide in Alzheimer's disease (AD) begins intraneuronally, within vesicles of the endosomal-lysosomal pathway where Aβ is both generated and degraded. Metalloproteases, including endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE)-1 and -2, reside within these vesicles and normally limit the accumulation of intraneuronally produced Aβ. In this study, we determined whether disruption of Aβ catabolism could trigger Aβ aggregation within neurons and increase the amount of Aβ associated with exosomes, small extracellular vesicles derived from endosomal multivesicular bodies. Using cultured cell lines, primary neurons, and organotypic brain slices from an AD mouse model, we found that pharmacological inhibition of the ECE family of metalloproteases increased intracellular and extracellular Aβ levels and promoted the intracellular formation of Aβ oligomers, a process that did not require internalization of secreted Aβ. In vivo, the accumulation of intraneuronal Aβ aggregates was accompanied by increased levels of both extracellular and exosome-associated Aβ, including oligomeric species. Neuronal exosomes were found to contain both ECE-1 and -2 activities, suggesting that multivesicular bodies are intracellular sites of Aβ degradation by these enzymes. ECE dysfunction could lead to the accumulation of intraneuronal Aβ aggregates and their subsequent release into the extracellular space via exosomes.-Pacheco-Quinto, J., Clausen, D., Pérez-González, R., Peng, H., Meszaros, A., Eckman, C.

https://openalex.org/W2902597669,"Administrating antibiotics to young piglets may have short- and long-term consequences on the gut microbiota. We hypothesised that these consequences may be alleviated by concurrent probiotic administration. The study objective was to investigate the effect of administrating gentamicin and a mixture of Bacillus (B.) licheniformis, B. subtilis and B. amyloliquefaeceans spores on the gut microbiota of piglets pre- and post-weaning. Twenty-four sows and their litters were randomly allocated to four treatment groups receiving; a) Bacillus spore mixture (six B. subtilis, two B. amyloliquefaeceans, and one B. licheniformis) fed to sows and piglets (PRO); b) gentamicin (5 mg per day) administered to piglets on day 4, 5, and 6 of age (AB); c) Bacillus spore mixture fed to sows and piglets, and gentamicin to piglets (PRO+AB); or d) no administration of probiotics or antibiotics (CTRL). Faecal and digesta samples were collected repeatedly during the study. Selected samples were subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing, culture counts, and organic acid, biogenic amine and tissue gene expression analysis. Treatment had a significant effect on the faecal microbial community composition on day 28 and 42, and colonic community on day 28. Faecal species richness (observed and estimated) and Shannon index, and colonic species richness, were higher in AB compared to PRO piglets on day 28, and were not significantly different from day 42. PRO piglets had the highest faecal concentration of iso-butyric acid on day 7 and a higher butyric acid concentration compared to CTRL piglets. We conclude that gentamicin and Bacillus spores influence the gut microbial diversity of piglets, although administration of gentamicin did not result in dysbiosis as hypothesised."
https://openalex.org/W2898289988,"Hippocampal ripple oscillations likely support reactivation of memory traces that manifest themselves as temporally organized spiking of sparse neuronal ensembles. However, the network mechanisms concurring to achieve this function are largely unknown. We designed a multi-compartmental model of the CA3-CA1 subfields to generate biophysically realistic ripple dynamics from the cellular level to local field potentials. Simulations broadly parallel in vivo observations and support that ripples emerge from CA1 pyramidal spiking paced by recurrent inhibition. In addition to ripple oscillations, key coordination mechanisms involve concomitant aspects of network activity. Recurrent synaptic interactions in CA1 exhibit slow-gamma band coherence with CA3 input, thus offering a way to coordinate CA1 activities with CA3 inducers. Moreover, CA1 feedback inhibition controls the content of spontaneous replay during CA1 ripples, forming new mnemonic representations through plasticity. These insights are consistent with slow-gamma interactions and interneuronal circuit plasticity observed in vivo, suggesting a multifaceted ripple-related replay phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W2902304229,"Autotaxin (ATX or ENPP2) is a secreted lysophospholipase D that produces lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a pleiotropic lipid mediator acting on specific GPCRs. ATX and LPA have been implicated in key (patho)physiologic processes, including embryonic development, lymphocyte homing, inflammation, and cancer progression. Using LPA receptor knockout mice, we previously uncovered a role for LPA signaling in promoting colitis and colorectal cancer. Here, we examined the role of ATX in experimental colitis through inducible deletion of Enpp2 in adult mice. ATX expression was increased upon induction of colitis, whereas ATX deletion reduced the severity of inflammation in both acute and chronic colitis, accompanied by transient weight loss. ATX expression in lymphocytes was strongly reduced in Rag1-/- and μMT mice, suggesting B cells as a major ATX-producing source, which was validated by immunofluorescence and biochemical analyses. ATX secretion by B cells from control, but not Enpp2 knockout, mice led to ERK activation in colorectal cancer cells and promoted T cell migration. We conclude that ATX deletion suppresses experimental colitis and that B cells are a major source of ATX in the colon. Our study suggests that pharmacological inhibition of ATX could be a therapeutic strategy in colitis.-Lin, S., Haque, A., Raeman, R., Guo, L., He, P., Denning, T. L., El-Rayes, B., Moolenaar, W.

https://openalex.org/W2808899944,"This work presents a nonparametric statistical test, S-maup, to measure the sensitivity of a spatially intensive variable to the effects of the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP). To the best of our knowledge, S-maup is the first statistic of its type and focuses on determining how much the distribution of the variable, at its highest level of spatial disaggregation, will change when it is spatially aggregated. Through a computational experiment, we obtain the basis for the design of the statistical test under the null hypothesis of non-sensitivity to MAUP. We performed an exhaustive simulation study for approaching the empirical distribution of the statistical test, obtaining its critical values, and computing its power and size. The results indicate that, in general, both the statistical size and power improve with increasing sample size. Finally, for illustrative purposes, an empirical application is made using the Mincer equation in South Africa, where starting from 206 municipalities, the S-maup statistic is used to find the maximum level of spatial aggregation that avoids the negative consequences of the MAUP."
https://openalex.org/W2817071602,"Insect metamorphosis is triggered by a decrease in juvenile hormone (JH) in the final juvenile instar. What induces this decrease is therefore a relevant question. Working with the cockroach Blattella germanica, we found that myoglianin (Myo), a ligand in the TGF-β signaling pathway, is highly expressed in the corpora allata (CA, the JH-producing glands) and the prothoracic gland [(PG), which produce ecdysone] during the penultimate (fifth) nymphal instar (N5). In the CA, high Myo levels during N5 repress the expression of juvenile hormone acid methyl transferase, a JH biosynthesis gene. In the PG, decreasing JH levels trigger gland degeneration, regulated by the factors Krüppel homolog 1, FTZ-F1, E93, and inhibitor of apoptosis-1. Also in the PG, a peak of myo expression in N5 indirectly stimulates the expression of ecdysone biosynthesis genes, such as neverland, enhancing the production of the metamorphic ecdysone pulse in N6. The Myo expression peak in N5 also represses cell proliferation, which can enhance ecdysone production. The data indicate that Myo triggers the premetamorphic nymphal instar in B. germanica and possibly in other hemimetabolan insects.—Kamsoi, O., Belles, X.

https://openalex.org/W2902186954,"Biogenesis of membrane proteins is controlled by the protein homeostasis (proteostasis) network. We have been focusing on protein quality control of γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter-gated ion channels in mammalian central nervous system. Proteostasis deficiency in GABAA receptors causes loss of their surface expression and thus function on the plasma membrane, leading to epilepsy and other neurological diseases. One well-characterized example is the A322D mutation in the α1 subunit that causes its extensive misfolding and expedited degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), resulting in autosomal dominant juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. We aimed to correct misfolding of the α1(A322D) subunits in the ER as an approach to restore their functional surface expression. Here, we showed that application of BIX, a specific, potent ER resident HSP70 family protein BiP activator, significantly increases the surface expression of the mutant receptors in human HEK293T cells and neuronal SH-SY5Y cells. BIX attenuates the degradation of α1(A322D) and enhances their forward trafficking and function. Furthermore, because BiP is one major target of the two unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways: ATF6 and IRE1, we continued to demonstrate that modest activations of the ATF6 pathway and IRE1 pathway genetically enhance the plasma membrane trafficking of the α1(A322D) protein in HEK293T cells. Our results underlie the potential of regulating the ER proteostasis network to correct loss-of-function protein conformational diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2902966106,"Heightened pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell (PA-SMC) proliferation and migration and dynamic remodeling of the extracellular matrix are hallmark pathogenic features of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Pirfenidone (PFD) is an orally bioavailable pyridone derivative with antifibrotic, antiinflammatory, and antioxidative properties currently used in the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. We therefore evaluated the efficacy of curative treatments with PFD in the sugen/hypoxia (SuHx) rat model of severe pulmonary hypertension. Treatment with PFD (30 mg/kg per day by mouth 3 times a day for 3 wk) started 5 wk after sugen injection partially reversed established pulmonary hypertension, reducing total pulmonary vascular resistance and remodeling. Consistent with these observations, we found that continued PFD treatment decreases PA-SMC proliferation and levels of extracellular matrix deposition in lungs and right ventricles in SuHx rats. Importantly, PFD attenuated the proproliferative and promigratory potentials of cultured PA-SMCs from patients with idiopathic PAH and their capacity to produce extracellular matrix components. Finally, we found that PFD dose dependently enhanced forkhead box O1 protein levels and its nuclear translocation in cultured idiopathic PAH PA-SMCs and in PFD-treated SuHx rats. PFD appears to be a potential therapy for PAH worthy of investigation and evaluation for clinical use in conjunction with current PAH treatments.-Poble, P.-B., Phan, C., Quatremare, T., Bordenave, J., Thuillet, R., Cumont, A., Huertas, A., Tu, L., Dorfmüller, P., Humbert, M., Ghigna, M.-R., Savale, L., Guignabert, C.

https://openalex.org/W2902555901,"Asthma is an airway inflammatory disease characterized by epithelial barrier dysfunction and airway remodeling. Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a pleiotropic cytokine shown to contribute to features of airway remodeling. We have previously demonstrated that IL-13 is an important mediator of normal airway epithelial repair and health. The role of IL-13 signaling via its receptor subunits (IL-13Rα1/IL-4Rα and IL-13Rα2) in airway epithelial repair and restoration of intact barrier function is not well understood and was investigated in this study using in vitro models. The blocking of IL-13 signaling via IL-13Rα2 significantly reduced airway epithelial repair by 24 h post-mechanical wounding in 1HAEo− cells. Expression and release of repair-mediating growth factor, heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like growth factor (HB-EGF), and subsequent activation of EGF receptor (EGFR) were also significantly reduced in response to wounding when IL-13Rα2 was blocked. Our data support that IL-13 signals via IL-13Rα2 to mediate normal airway epithelial repair via HB-EGF-dependent activation of EGFR. In human donor lung tissues, we observed that airway epithelium of asthmatics expressed significantly decreased levels of IL-13Rα2 and increased levels of IL-13Rα1 compared with nonasthmatics. Dysregulated expression of IL-13 receptor subunits in the airways of asthmatics may thus contribute to the epithelial barrier dysfunction observed in asthma.—Yang, S.

https://openalex.org/W2582426340,"Background Traffic crashes are a major cause of global morbidity and mortality disproportionately affecting low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Motorcycle taxi (boda boda) drivers are particularly vulnerable because they are exposed to traffic risks with limited safety equipment. This study aims to characterize injury prevalence and safety habits among boda boda drivers, as well as ways to improve road traffic safety in LMICs. Methods A cross-sectional mixed methods study was conducted with 300 boda boda drivers between 24 March and 3 April 2014 in urban Moshi, Tanzania. A convenience sample of participants was drawn from 25 of 58 registered boda boda stands and 2 of 31 unregistered stands. Data were analyzed using R, and content thematic analysis was performed and agreed upon by three investigators. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between boda boda characteristics and injury risk. Results In total, 300 drivers participated, of whom 148 (49.3%) had experienced a crash during their lifetime, and 114 (77.0%) sustained at least one injury. Only 27 of those injured (23.4%) were hospitalized. Of all participants, 220 (73.3%) reported consistent helmet usage, despite 285 participants (95.0%) agreeing that helmet usage reduces injury severity. From the 280 helmets observed, 231 (82.5%) were either damaged or fit improperly. Having a cracked helmet was associated with higher risk of being involved in a traffic crash. Owning a helmet with a proper fit was associated with reduced risk for a traffic crash (OR = 0.06) and road traffic injuries (OR = 0.07). A thematic analysis of boda boda drivers’ suggestions to increase road safety identified four intervention areas: 1) roadway infrastructure and traffic regulation, 2) road user attitudes and safe driving behaviors, 3) education and training, and 4) law enforcement. Conclusion Our study demonstrates boda boda drivers’ safety behaviors and identifies four intervention areas that can be leveraged to increase overall road traffic safety. Unfortunately, while boda boda drivers are aware of ways to improve safety, adherence to safety habits remains low. Successful multi-sectoral interventions are needed to improve road safety for boda boda drivers in Tanzania."
https://openalex.org/W2901987869,"Adenomatous polyps are a common precursor lesion for colorectal cancer. ColonFlag is a machine- learning-based algorithm that uses basic patient information and complete blood cell counts (CBC) to identify individuals at elevated risk of colorectal cancer for intensified screening. The purpose of this study was to determine whether ColonFlag is also able to predict the presence of high risk adenomatous polyps at colonoscopy. This study was conducted at a large colon cancer screening center in Calgary, Alberta. The study population included asymptomatic individuals between the ages of 50 and 75 who underwent a screening colonoscopy between January 2013 and June 2015. All subjects had at least one CBC result within the year prior to colonoscopy. Based on age, sex, red blood cell parameters, inflammatory cells and platelets, the ColonFlag algorithm generated a score from 0 to 100. We compared the ability of the ColonFlag test result to discriminate between individuals who were found to have a high risk polyp and those with a normal colonoscopy. Among the 17,676 individuals who underwent a screening colonoscopy there were 1,014 found to have a high risk precancerous lesion (5.7%) and 60 were found to have colorectal cancer (0.3%). At a specificity of 95%, the odds ratio for a positive ColonFlag was 2.0 for those with an advanced precancerous lesion compared with those with a normal colonoscopy. The odds ratio did not vary according to patient subgroup, colorectal cancer location or stage. ColonFlag is a passive test that can use routine blood test results to help identify individuals at elevated risk for high risk precancerous polyps as well as frank colorectal cancer. These individuals may be targeted in an effort to achieve greater compliance with conventional screening tests."
https://openalex.org/W2902589067,"After sequential treatment with first- and third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancers frequently harbor multiple resistance mutations in exon 20 of EGFR including T790M, mediating resistance to first-generation TKIs, and at codons 792, 796, or 797 mediating resistance to third-generation TKIs. However, whether these resistance mutations are in cis or trans has therapeutic implications for patients. We analyzed a cohort of 29 patients with NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations at codons 792, 796, or 797 to establish the configuration of these mutations. We performed hybrid capture-based, next-generation sequencing on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded biopsy tissue or liquid biopsy. 27 samples had both a T790M mutation and a mutation at codons 792, 796, or 797. In all of these cases, the mutations were found in the cis configuration; the trans configuration was not observed. Two patients' samples harbored a mutation at codon 797 but no T790M mutation. In these two cases, longitudinal analysis showed earlier biopsies harbored EGFR T790M, which was undetectable following osimertinib treatment. Treatment of one these patients with both first- and third-generation EGFR TKIs resulted in a mixed response. Here we describe multiple configurations of EGFR T790M and third-generation TKI resistance mutations at codons 792, 796, and 797. These mutations are most commonly found in cis, which confers resistance to all current EGFR TKIs. We also describe two patients that exhibited T790M loss with acquisition of a mutation at codon 797. In addition, one of these patients, with an EGFR C797S in a lung biopsy was subsequently found to have EGFR C797N in a later biopsy of pleural fluid, highlighting the dynamic multiclonal nature of advanced NSCLC."

In a sample of 1,302 highly-disadvantaged mothers and their preschoolers, we evaluated the factor structure and reliability of the parent-report version of the SDQ in rural Pakistan. Confirmatory factor analyses suggested that the original structure of the SDQ was not appropriate for our data. We created conceptually- and empirically-coherent measures of children’s externalizing behavior problems and prosocial skills. Child and family correlates of social-emotional behaviors were similar to those found in other countries, supporting the validity of our new composites. Girls and children with more siblings had fewer externalizing behavior problems and more prosocial behaviors at four years. Further, maternal depressive symptoms and food insecurity were uniquely linked to more externalizing behavior problems at four years. In contrast, maternal education, home environment quality, and social-emotional skills at two years were associated with more prosocial behaviors at four years."

The selection of suitable reference genes for data normalization is a precondition for credible measurements of gene expression levels using RT-qPCR. Propylea japonica is one of the most common pests of many crop systems throughout East Asia, and has often been used in the testing of non-target impacts during environmental risk assessments of genetically engineered plants. The present study assessed the suitability of nine frequently used reference genes for comparisons of P. japonica gene expression. Expression stability was compared across developmental stages, sex, a range of tissues, and following exposure to different temperatures. Data were analyzed using RefFinder, which integrated the results obtained using NormFinder, geNorm, BestKeeper, and the ΔCt method. This led to the identification of unique sets of reference genes for each experimental condition: ribosomal protein S18 (RPS18) and elongation factor 1 α (EF1A) for developmental stage comparisons, RPS18 and EF1A for sex comparisons, EF1A and ribosomal protein L4 for tissue comparisons, and RPS18 and EF1A for analyses of temperature-mediated effects. These reference genes will help to enhance the accuracy of RT-qPCR analyses of P. japonica gene expression. This work represents an initial move towards building a standardized system for RT-qPCR analysis of P. japonica, providing a basis for the ecological risk assessment of RNAi-based insect control products."
https://openalex.org/W2902668452,"The recent availability of digital traces generated by cellphone calls has significantly increased the scientific understanding of human mobility. Until now, however, based on low time resolution measurements, previous works have ignored to study human mobility under various time scales due to sparse and irregular calls, particularly in the era of mobile Internet. In this paper, we introduced Mobile Flow Records, flow-level data access records of online activity of smartphone users, to explore human mobility. Mobile Flow Records collect high-resolution information of large populations. By exploiting this kind of data, we show the models and statistics of human mobility at a large-scale (3,542,235 individuals) and finer-granularity (7.5min). Next, we investigated statistical variations and biases of mobility models caused by different time scales (from 7.5min to 32h), and found that the time scale does influence the mobility model, which indicates a deep coupling of human mobility and time. We further show that mobility behaviors like transportation modes contribute to the diversity of human mobility, by exploring several novel and refined features (e.g., motion speed, duration, and trajectory distance). Particularly, we point out that 2-hour sampling adopted in previous works is insufficient to study detailed motion behaviors. Our work not only offers a macroscopic and microscopic view of spatial-temporal human mobility, but also applies previously unavailable features, both of which are beneficial to the studies on phenomena driven by human mobility."

A purposive sample of thirty-one intervention and usual care participants were interviewed up to three interviews over a year. Thematic analysis was carried out, incorporating concepts from the Trans-Theoretical Model of change.The PATH trial reports a clinically relevant improvement in mental health outcomes for women receiving the intervention compared to usual advocacy. The qualitative study reveals which elements of the intervention were beneficial or problematic, which outcomes were most meaningful and relevant to participants and highlights reasons for variations in adherence. Women valued the educational, psychological and emotional elements of the intervention, they felt safe to explore repressed emotions for the first time and experienced a reduction in self-blame, improved sense of identity and greater self-esteem. They also incorporated new skills and self-help techniques to enable sustainable change. Women receiving usual advocacy reported un-met needs for psychological and emotional support. Adherence was affected by women's 'psychological 'readiness' to engage, the competing demands of practical issues such as housing insecurity, legal proceedings or the availability of child care, and breaks in the continuity of professional care.Continuity and regularity of sessions with a trained specialist worker was key to women's recovery. Individual assessment of 'readiness' would optimise the timing of delivery to maximise adherence and benefit."

In this study detailed prospectively obtained sequences from field adenovirus strains, NVRI, Poland have been analyzed.Overall hundred and thirty seven adenovirus strains were collected, evaluated, and examined of hyper variable loop L1 region HVRs1-4 of the hexon gene for the presence of similarity, mutations, tertiary structure, and spinal conformation.Sequences were characterized, and divided for five species and seven types, FAdV-A-E/FAdV-1/2/4/5/7/8a/8b/11. The presence of predicted tertiary structure depending on type/species were determined. Analysis of specific selected sequences: GQMTN 1/A, 7/E, and 8b/E, GQMTT 2/11/D, GQLSN 4/C, GQMTH 5/B, and GQMSN 8a/E in examined HVRs1-4 Loop L1 region of hexon gene compared to tertiary structure indicated that this visibly conservative region represents the antigenic binging activity.This is the first molecular study on tertiary structure on HVRs1-4 region in adenovirus genome conducted in Poland. Analysis indicated specific sequence in Loop L1 HVR1-4 region which is strictly responsible for antibodies binding. This information could assist during the process connected with specific preventive strategies based on their molecular genome investigation and new facilitate studies. This study will help to better understand the mechanisms of pathogenicity of adenovirus strains provide a guide for disease control in birds."
https://openalex.org/W2902395035,"Radio-frequency (RF) field inhomogeneities and higher levels of specific absorption rate (SAR) still present great challenges in ultrahigh-field (UHF) MRI. In this study, an in-depth analysis of the eigenmodes of a 20-channel transmit Tic-Tac-Toe (TTT) RF array for 7T neuro MRI is presented. The eigenmodes were calculated for five different Z levels (along the static magnetic field direction) of the coil. Four eigenmodes were obtained for each Z level (composed of 4 excitation ports), and they were named based on the characteristics of their field distributions: quadrature, opposite-phase, anti-quadrature, and zero-phase. Corresponding finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations were performed and experimental B1+ field maps were acquired using a homogeneous spherical phantom and human head (in-vivo). The quadrature mode is the most efficient and it excites the central brain regions; the opposite-phase mode excites the brain peripheral regions; anti-quadrature mode excites the head periphery; and the zero-phase mode excites cerebellum and temporal lobes. Using this RF array, up to five eigenmodes (from five different Z levels) can be simultaneously excited. The superposition of these modes has the potential to produce homogeneous excitation with full brain coverage and low levels of SAR at 7T MRI."
https://openalex.org/W2903185016,"The threatened thin-spined porcupine (Chaetomys subspinosus), a forest-specialist endemic to the Brazilian Atlantic forest, was rarely detected in the wild during the 20th century. Previous geographic distribution assessments were carried out nearly three decades ago and were based on interview data. We performed extensive field surveys (based on active search and interviews), a literature review, and species distribution modeling to predict and validate a more reliable picture of its geographic distribution and environmental suitability gradient. We identified the main predictors of species’ incidence, its conservation status, and pinpointed key areas for species conservation. Our results indicated that C. subspinosus is distributed continuously in the Atlantic forest from southeastern Espirito Santo to central-eastern Sergipe state, totaling 104,326 km2 of occurrence area, although only 3,299 km2 (13.3%) is currently represented by native forests (species habitat). C. subspinosus was absent or at least so rare that it was not detected in more than half of the locations sampled by interviews (53.5%). Our results suggest that populations are sensitive to climatic conditions and habitat loss, becoming abruptly rarer when the remaining forest cover reaches less than 10% area within a region (~ 5,000 km2 scale). This result indicates that the high deforestation level of the Atlantic forest is already close to the limit of regional species resistance. Bahia state still harbors the bulk of the remaining forest with high climatic suitability, and generally under low levels of legal protection. Herein we highlight priority areas and research gaps that could guide decision makers to promote conservation strategies for this threatened species."

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of surgical treatment for this disease. From 2009 to 2015, 13 patients underwent tumor resection at our hospital, with an average age of 49.5 years (27–68 years). Four patients underwent en bloc resection, and 9 patients underwent piecemeal resections. A Chi-square test was used to compare the postoperative recurrence rates between the en bloc resection and the piecemeal resection groups (p = 0.68), and no significant difference was found between the benign and malignant solitary fibrous tumor groups (p = 0.44). The 5-year survival rate of the patients in this study was 83.3%, and the 5-year progression-free survival rate was 63.5%. The progression-free survival rate was not significantly different between the en bloc resection and piecemeal resection groups (p = 0.97). Piecemeal resection can also achieve acceptable local control, particularly for patients with sacral tumors, as they may achieve even better postoperative function with sacral nerve preservation. Recurrence and metastasis occur relatively late in the course of this disease. Therefore, long-term follow-up is required."
https://openalex.org/W2950860150,"Genetic characterization of southern African cichlids has not received much attention. Here, we describe the mitogenome sequences and phylogenetic positioning of Oreochromis andersonii and O. macrochir among the African cichlids. The complete mitochondrial DNA sequences were determined for O. andersonii and O. macrochir, two important aquaculture and fisheries species endemic to southern Africa. The complete mitogenome sequence lengths were 16642 bp and 16644 bp for O. andersonii and O. macrochir respectively. The general structural organization follows that of other teleost species with 13 protein–coding genes, 2 rRNAs, 22 tRNAs and a non-coding control region. Phylogenetic placement of the two species among other African cichlids was performed using Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC). The consensus trees confirmed the relative positions of the two cichlid species with O. andersonii being very closely related to O. mossambicus and O. macrochir showing a close relation to both species. Among the 13 mitochondrial DNA protein coding genes ND6 may have evolved more rapidly and COIII was the most conserved. There are signs that ND6 may have been subjected to positive selection in order for these cichlid lineages to diversify and adapt to new environments. More work is needed to characterize the southern Africa cichlids as they are important species for capture fisheries, aquaculture development and understanding biogeographic history of African cichlids. Bio-conservation of some endangered cichlids is also essential due to the threat by invasive species."
https://openalex.org/W2902262220,"The alpha regulator subunit B'' of protein phosphatase 2 (PPP2R3A), a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), was reported to present a special subcellular localization in cardiomyocytes and elevate in non-ischemia failing hearts. PPP2R3A has two transcriptions PR72 and PR130. PR72 acts as a negative regulator of the Wnt signaling cascade, while the Wnt signaling cascade plays a pivotal role in cardiac development. And PR130 was found to be involved in cardiac development of zebrafish in our previous study. Thus, to investigate the function of PR72 in heart, two stable pr72 knockout (KO) zebrafish lines were generated using Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nuclease (TALEN) technology. Homozygous pr72 KO fish struggled to survive to adulthood and exhibited cardiac developmental defects, including enlarged ventricular chambers, reduced cardiomyocytes and decreased cardiac function. And the defective sarcomere ultrastructure that affected mitochondria, I bands, Z lines, and intercalated disks was also observed. Furthermore, the abnormal heart looping was detected in mutants which could be rescued by injection with wild type pr72 mRNA. Additionally, it was found that Wnt effectors were elevated in mutants. Those indicated that deletion of pr72 in zebrafish interrupted cardiac development, probably through activation of the Wnt pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2902377800,"Stereotactic body radiation therapy with CyberKnife for prostate cancer has long treatment times compared with conventional radiotherapy. This arises the need for designing treatment plans with short execution times. We propose an objective function for plan quality evaluation, which was used to determine an optimal combination between small and large collimators based on short treatment times and clinically acceptable dose distributions. Data from 11 prostate cancer patients were used. For each patient, 20 plans were created based on all combinations between one small (⌀ 10-25 mm) and one large (⌀ 35-60 mm) Iris collimator size. The objective function was assigned to each combination as a penalty, such that plans with low penalties were considered superior. This function considered the achievement of dosimetric planning goals, tumor control probability, normal tissue complication probability, relative seriality parameter, and treatment time. Two methods were used to determine the optimal combination. First, we constructed heat maps representing the mean penalty values and standard deviations of the plans created for each collimator combination. The combination giving a plan with the smallest mean penalty and standard deviation was considered optimal. Second, we created two groups of superior plans: group A plans were selected by histogram analysis and group B plans were selected by choosing the plan with the lowest penalty from each patient. In both groups, the most used small and large collimators were assumed to represent the optimal combination. The optimal combinations obtained from the heat maps included the 25 mm as a small collimator, giving small/large collimator sizes of 25/35, 25/40, 25/50, and 25/60 mm. The superior-group analysis indicated that 25/50 mm was the optimal combination. The optimal Iris combination for prostate cancer treatment using CyberKnife was determined to be a collimator size between 25 mm (small) and 50 mm (large)."
https://openalex.org/W2902666962,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex metabolic disease associated with alterations in glucose, lipid and protein metabolism. In order to characterize the biochemical phenotype of the Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat, the most common animal model for the study of T2D, and the impact of the insulin sensitizer pioglitazone, a global, mass spectrometry-based analysis of the metabolome was conducted. Overall, 420 metabolites in serum, 443 in the liver and 603 in the intestine were identified at study end. In comparison to two control groups, obese diabetic ZDF rats showed characteristic metabolic signatures that included hyperglycemia, elevated β-oxidation, dyslipidemia-featured by an increase in saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids and a decrease of medium chain and of polyunsaturated fatty acids in serum-and decreased amino acid levels, consistent with their utilization in hepatic gluconeogenesis. A 13-week treatment with the PPARγ agonist pioglitazone reversed most of these signatures: Pioglitazone improved glycemic control and the fatty acid profile, elevated amino acid levels in the liver, but decreased branched chain amino acids in serum. The hitherto most comprehensive metabolic profiling study identified a biochemical blueprint for the ZDF diabetic model and captured the impact of genetic, nutritional and pharmacological perturbations. The in-depth characterization on the molecular level deepens the understanding and further validates the ZDF rat as a suitable preclinical model of diabetes in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2903227690,"Dehumanization and infrahumanization involve decreasing the humanity attributed to others. Despite the existence of a large body of work on these topics, little is known about how to increase outgroup humanization. Across two experiments, we examined the effects of intergroup and intragroup helping on dehumanization and infrahumanization. In Study 1, we showed that news of an outgroup helping the ingroup after a natural disaster reduced infrahumanization, but not dehumanization. Reduced infrahumanization emerged regardless of the amount of aid given by the outgroup. By contrast, learning about ingroup helping the outgroup following a natural disaster did not decrease dehumanization or infrahumanization, regardless of amount of aid offered by the ingroup. Study 2 replicated and extended these findings by demonstrating that only intergroup helping by the outgroup to the ingroup reduced dehumanization. Intragroup helping, by either the ingroup or outgroup had no influence on outgroup perceptions. We report all measures, manipulations, and exclusions in each study. Implications of recent research on intergroup helping as a means to outgroup humanization are considered."

A survey was undertaken by the Italian Society of Human Genetics (SIGU). Forty-two laboratories participated. For most molecular techniques, the most time-consuming steps are those requiring an intensive manual intervention or in which the human bias can affect the global process time-performances. For NGS, for which the study surveyed also the interpretation time, the latter represented the step that requiring longer times. We report the first survey describing the hands-on times requested for different molecular diagnostics procedures, including NGS.

https://openalex.org/W2902497544,"Nordic walking (NW) is a total body version of walking increasingly used as a health-promoting activity by middle-aged and older adults. The present study examined the relationship between force exerted through the pole and physiological response during NW. In this non-randomized exercise trial, 17 participants comprising 8 middle-aged and older recreationally trained Nordic walkers (NWrec: 63.7 ± 8.1 years) and 9 experienced NW instructors (NWinstr: 57.5 ± 7.8 years) underwent outdoor ordinary walking (OW) and NW bouts as fast as possible for 12 minutes. Walking distance, speed, heart rate (HR), energy expenditure (METs and J/kg/m) and upper and lower limb muscle activities using surface electromyogram (EMG) were assessed. A pole with a built-in load cell measured force applied to the pole with peak pole force, pole contact time, % of pole contact time with respect to the gait cycle, and pole impulse derived. We conducted two-way analysis of covariance adjusted for age and BMI. There was a significant group and walking type interaction for walking distance and speed (P = 0.04), METs (P < 0.01), and HR (P = 0.04) with higher values in the NWinstr group during NW than OW. As expected, upper limb EMG activities increased (P < 0.01) with NW in both groups. All pole force measures were significantly higher in NWinstr than NWrec (P ≤ 0.01). Change in walking distance and speed were correlated with pole peak force (r = 0.67, P < 0.01) and pole impulse (r = 0.63, P = 0.01). Similarly, change in METs was associated with peak pole force (r = 0.66, P < 0.01) and pole impulse (r = 0.56, P = 0.02). These results indicate that planting the pole on the ground more forcefully and for longer periods to derive a driving force in NW enhances the effectiveness of the exercise and potentially the health-derived benefits."

Because sleep disturbances are common in delirium, melatonin has been an area of interest in the treatment of delirium. The rs10830963 single nucleotide polymorphism of the melatonin receptor 1B gene can cause pathological dysfunction of this receptor and is associated with delayed morning offset of melatonin. We hypothesized patients undergoing aortic cardiac surgery who have the risk genotype of a melatonin receptor 1B polymorphism would have a higher incidence of postoperative delirium.Ninety-eight patients undergoing aortic root or valve surgery underwent analysis for melatonin receptor 1B single nucleotide polymorphism, rs10830963. Using a validated method, CHART-DEL, all charts were retrospectively reviewed and scored for the presence of delirium while blinded to the results of the melatonin receptor 1B gene polymorphism.Genotyping for melatonin receptor 1B polymorphism was acceptable in 76 subjects of European descent of which 18 (23.7%) had delirium. Four of seven subjects with the risk genotype had delirium versus only 20.3% of subjects without the risk genotype. This carried an odds ratio of 5.2 (1.0, 26.1), p = 0.050.This observation suggests a role of the risk genotype of a melatonin receptor 1B polymorphism in the development of postoperative delirium. These hypotheses generating results warrant further prospective studies in a larger cohort group with delirium, circadian rhythm and melatonin assessments."
https://openalex.org/W2902846245,"Salmonella infections remain an important public health issue in Canada and worldwide. Although the majority of Salmonella cases are self-limiting, some will lead to severe symptoms and occasionally severe invasive infections, especially in vulnerable populations such as seniors. This study was performed to assess temporal trends of Salmonella cases in seniors over 15 years (2014–2028) and assess possible impact of demographic shift on national incidence; taking into account of trends in other age groups. The numbers of reported Salmonella cases in seniors (60 years and over) in eight provinces and territories for a period of fifteen years were analysed (1998–2013) using a time-adjusted Poisson regression model. With the demographic changes predicted in the age-structure of the population and in the absence of any targeted interventions, our analysis showed the incidence of Salmonella cases in seniors could increase by 16% by 2028 and the multi-provincial incidence could increase by 5.3%. As a result, the age distribution amongst the Salmonella cases is expected to change with a higher proportion of cases in seniors and a smaller proportion in children (0–4 years old). Over the next decades, cases of infection, hospitalizations and deaths associated with Salmonella in seniors could represent a challenge to public health due to an aging population in Canada. As life expectancy increases in Canada, identification of unique risk factors and targeted prevention in seniors should be pursued to reduce the impact of the demographic shift on disease incidence."
https://openalex.org/W2902892088,"Magicians use deception to create effects that allow us to experience the impossible. More recently, magicians have started to contextualize these tricks in psychological demonstrations. We investigated whether witnessing a magic demonstration alters people’s beliefs in these pseudo-psychological principles. In the classroom, a magician claimed to use psychological skills to read a volunteer’s thoughts. After this demonstration, participants reported higher beliefs that an individual can 1) read a person’s mind by evaluating micro expressions, psychological profiles and muscle activities, and 2) effectively prime a person’s behaviour through subtle suggestions. Whether he was presented as a magician or psychologist did not influence people’s beliefs about how the demonstration was achieved, nor did it influence their beliefs in pseudo-psychological principles. Our results demonstrate that pseudo-psychological demonstrations can have a significant impact on perpetuating false beliefs in scientific principles and raise important questions about the wider impact of scientific misinformation."
https://openalex.org/W2903361378,"Pleiotropic protein promoting DNA repair A (PprA) is a key protein facilitating the extreme radiation resistance of Deinococcus radiodurans. PprA is a unique protein to the genus Deinococcus and exists as an oligomer ranging from a tetramer to an ∼100-mer depending on protein concentrations. Here, the X-ray crystal structure of PprA was determined to clarify how PprA confers radiation resistance. The tertiary structure of dimeric PprA was elucidated by using mutants obtained with random and site-directed mutagenesis methods (W183R and A139R); these mutants have disabled DNA binding and polymerization functions. Because the mutant A139R and W183R proteins have dimeric assemblies with 2 different interfaces (Interfaces 1 and 2), the linear and oligomerized PprA model was constructed as a left-handed face-to-face periodic screw structure. In addition, the linear structure in solution was confirmed by small-angle scattering experiments. The site-directed mutational analysis identified essential basic amino acids for DNA binding. These analytical data support the hypothesis that a complex assembly of PprA molecules, which are extended and have a screw structure, surrounds and stretches the DNA strand, acting as a novel guide to colocalize the DNA strands for efficient DNA repairs.-Adachi, M., Shimizu, R., Shibazaki, C., Satoh, K., Fujiwara, S., Arai, S., Narumi, I., Kuroki, R.

https://openalex.org/W2903400658,"Traffic assignment and management objectives are considered as two significant parts in developing the emergency evacuation plan, which can directly influence the evacuation performance and efficiency. From the perspective of disaster response operators, the evacuation objective frequently is to minimize the total evacuation time to reduce losses, which may lead to an unreasonable and unfair phenomenon where people in highest risk areas may be forced to sacrifice their priorities of evacuation to improve the system evacuation efficiency. In this paper, considering both efficiency and social fairness in emergency evacuation, a weight function consisting of risk evaluation index as variable and the emphasis degree of managers on social fairness principle as coefficient was initially proposed and embedded in system optimal (SO) objective function. Combining the weight function and other constraints based on an extended cell transmission model (CTM), the linear program (LP) model was established to realize the simulation of dynamic traffic assignment in emergency evacuation. Employing this model, the impact of the management strategy of balancing both efficiency and social fairness on evacuation results was studied in the “Tianjin Explosions” case. In the end, the conclusion of “balancing social fairness is valuable during evacuation” was obtained."
https://openalex.org/W2903491445,"Non-native plants can impact riparian ecosystem function through diverse terrestrial and aquatic pathways, with cascading effects on food webs. Invasion-mediated vegetation changes can depress terrestrial arthropod communities and alter arthropod flux across the aquatic-terrestrial interface. We investigated the effects of a non-native woody plant, Robinia neomexicana, on insect contributions to riparian songbird diets. This plant was introduced over 100 years ago to the Clear Creek drainage in northwestern Colorado (USA) from its native range, which extends into southern Colorado. We used stable isotope analysis of insects and avian feces to 1) assess whether the relative contributions of aquatic- and terrestrial-derived arthropod prey differed between reference sites and sites invaded by R. neomexicana, and 2) quantify the amount of aquatic- and terrestrial-derived resources consumed by an insectivorous songbird assemblage. Two species of insectivorous songbirds consumed more aquatic insects in invaded sites compared to reference sites. This change in terrestrial- and aquatic-derived prey in bird diets in response to a near-range plant invasion suggests that the introduction of novel species from more distant native ranges could produce similar or stronger effects. Overall, the songbird community consumed approximately 34% aquatic resources, which highlights the importance of these subsidies to riparian consumers. Our investigation of insect subsidies demonstrates how introduced species can indirectly affect food webs and provides insight into the plasticity of riparian consumer responses."

Here, we identified deoxi-phorbol esters present in E. umbellata latex alcoholic extract that are able to increase HIV transcription and reactivate virus from latency models. This activity is probably mediated by NF-kB activation followed by nuclear translocation and binding to the HIV LTR promoter. In addition, E. umbellata latex extract induced the production of pro inflammatory cytokines in vitro in human PBMC cultures. This latex extract also activates latent virus in human PBMCs isolated from HIV positive patients as well as latent SIV in non-human primate primary CD4+ T lymphocytes. Together, these results indicate that the phorbol esters present in E. umbellata latex are promising candidate compounds for future clinical trials for shock and kill therapies to promote HIV cure and eradication."

We aimed to study the association between serum concentration of anti-CMV IgG and ischaemic stroke in HIV-infected Malawians.Our sample was derived from a case-control stroke study in Malawi. Serum concentration of anti-CMV IgG was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Multivariable logistic regression was used to study the association between high concentrations of anti-CMV IgG (above the third tertile) and ischaemic stroke while adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors.Overall, 139 HIV-positive adults (48.2% women; 48 ischaemic stroke cases and 91 controls; median age: 45 years) were included. The median CD4+ count was 136 and 401 cell/mm3 (IQR: [75-278] and [230-533]) in cases and controls, respectively. High concentration of anti-CMV IgG was associated with ischaemic stroke in the univariable model (OR = 2.56 [1.23-5.34]) but not after adjusting for duration of antiretroviral therapy (ART), CD4+ count, and other cardiovascular risk factors (OR = 0.94 [0.29-3.08]). Low CD4+ count was an independent predictor of stroke. There was a negative correlation between serum concentration of anti-CMV IgG and CD4+ count (rho = -0.30, p < 0.001).High concentration of anti-CMV IgG is not independently associated with ischaemic stroke in HIV-infected Malawians.

https://openalex.org/W2902670162,"Dot-probe studies consistently show that high trait anxious individuals have an attentional bias towards threatening faces. However, little is known about the influence of perceptual confounds of specific emotional expressions on this effect. Teeth-exposure was recently recognized as an important factor for the occurrence of attentional bias towards angry faces in a closely related paradigm (the face-in-the-crowd paradigm). Therefore, we investigated the effect of exposed teeth on attentional bias towards angry faces in the dot-probe task. Participants (N = 74) were asked to classify probe stimuli that were preceded by two simultaneously presented face cues, one angry and the other neutral. Half of the angry faces had exposed teeth, the other half had concealed teeth. Afterwards, participants completed the trait anxiety scale of the STAI. For angry faces with non-exposed teeth, we found the expected positive correlation (r = .441) of trait anxiety with the attentional bias score (reaction times for probes replacing the neutral face minus reaction times for probes replacing the angry face). However, we found no influence of trait anxiety on attentional bias towards angry faces with exposed teeth. These results suggest that natural low-level stimulus confounds of emotional faces like exposed teeth can affect the manifestation of anxiety-related attentional biases towards angry faces in the dot-probe task."
https://openalex.org/W2902004472,"Over 12% of women in the United States have reduced fertility and/or fecundity. Environmental factors, such as temperature, and socioeconomic factors have been implicated in reducing female fecundity. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of environmental factors coupled with socioeconomic factors on birth rate at the country-level. We use birth rate as a proxy for female fecundity. This will enable us to identify the most important factors affecting female fecundity.Using country-specific data from 182 countries, we constructed a regression model of the effects of environmental and socioeconomic factors on birth rate at the country-level. Our model assesses the role of temperature, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, fine air particulate matter (PM 2.5), and prevalence of male and female Body Mass Index (BMI) > = 25 (age-standardized) on birth rate per country. Because many of these factors are inter-dependent, we include all possible two-way interaction terms to assess the role of individual factors and interactions between multiple factors in the model.In the full regression model, we found that GDP per capita along with 5 interaction terms were significant after adjusting for multiple testing. Female BMI was only nominally significant. GDP per capita was independently associated with birth rate (adjusted p-value <0.001). Prevalence of BMI > = 25 age-standardized in males and females were also significant when interacting with air pollution or GDP on female fecundity (birth rate). Temperature did not affect birth rate either independently or as an interaction unless BMI was removed from the model.A country's economic wealth was the most significant factor in predicting birth rate in a statistical model that includes environmental and socioeconomic variables. This is important for future studies investigating environmental factors involved in increasing or decreasing female fecundity."

Pregnancy in women is associated with physiologic changes that may influence the risk of cardiovascular disease. Comparing the association between number of children and cIMT in men and women can provide insights on whether the association may be due to pregnancy. We investigated the association between number of children and cIMT among 718 female (mean age 37.5 years) and 417 male participants (mean age 41.3 years), randomly selected from the Health Effect of Arsenic Longitudinal Study (HEALS), a population-based cohort study in Bangladesh. Multivariate linear regression was used to assess the association and to control for education attainment, history of diabetes, age, smoking, betel use, BMI, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure. The average number of children was 4.43 for women and 3.74 for men. There were no nulliparous women. We observed a positive association between number of children and cIMT in women. Mean cIMT increased by 4.5 μm (95% CI, 0.8-8.1) per increment of one birth (P = 0.02). Compared to women with two children, cIMT in women with 4 children and ≥5 children was 23.6μm (95%CI, 2.6-44.7; P = 0.03) and 25.1 μm (95%CI, 3.5-46.6; P = 0.02) greater, respectively. The association was not modified by BMI, SBP, betel use or age. Data in men showed no evidence of association (P = 0.4). The finding suggests a role of high parity in atherosclerosis in women of a low-income, high parity population."
https://openalex.org/W2902670961,"Motivation The recent revolution in new sequencing technologies, as a part of the continuous process of adopting new innovative protocols has strongly impacted the interpretation of relations between phenotype and genotype. Thus, understanding the resulting gene sets has become a bottleneck that needs to be addressed. Automatic methods have been proposed to facilitate the interpretation of gene sets. While statistical functional enrichment analyses are currently well known, they tend to focus on well-known genes and to ignore new information from less-studied genes. To address such issues, applying semantic similarity measures is logical if the knowledge source used to annotate the gene sets is hierarchically structured. In this work, we propose a new method for analyzing the impact of different semantic similarity measures on gene set annotations. Results We evaluated the impact of each measure by taking into consideration the two following features that correspond to relevant criteria for a “good” synthetic gene set annotation: (i) the number of annotation terms has to be drastically reduced and the representative terms must be retained while annotating the gene set, and (ii) the number of genes described by the selected terms should be as large as possible. Thus, we analyzed nine semantic similarity measures to identify the best possible compromise between both features while maintaining a sufficient level of details. Using Gene Ontology to annotate the gene sets, we obtained better results with node-based measures that use the terms’ characteristics than with measures based on edges that link the terms. The annotation of the gene sets achieved with the node-based measures did not exhibit major differences regardless of the characteristics of terms used."

Consecutive 5 mm proximal left coronary artery segments were Movat stained, and the atherosclerotic burden for each segment was graded (revised AHA-classification).Non-CVD and CVD groups showed steep increase of atherosclerosis severity beyond the age of 40, resulting in an endemic presence of advanced atherosclerosis in men over 40 and women over 50 years. In fact, only 19% of the non-CVD and 6% of the CVD donors over 40 years were classified with a normal LCA or a so called non-progressive lesion type. Fibrous calcified plaques (FCP), the consolidated remnants of earlier ruptured lesions, dominated in both non-CVD and CVD donors. Estimates of the atherosclerosis burden (i.e. average lesion grade, proportion of FCPs, and average number of FCPs per cross-section) were all higher in the CVD group (p<1.10-16, p<0.0001, and p<0.05, respectively).Dominance of consolidated FCP lesions in males over 40 and females over 50 years, show that plaque ruptures in the left coronary artery are common. However, the majority of these ruptures remain asymptomatic. This implies that the atherosclerotic process is repetitive. A relative difference in disease burden between CVD and non-CVD donors supports the concept that complications of atherosclerotic disease involve a stochastic element."
https://openalex.org/W2903515088,"Because parental care is costly, conflict between mates over their roles in reproduction seems unavoidable unless they both benefit from parental labour split equally between partners. In the current paper we analyse the division of parental investment in the Blackcap (Sylvia atricapilla), a species that experiences high nest predation. We show that both sexes invest in the incubation of eggs as well as feeding and brooding nestlings at a similar level. We also found that pairs which divided feeding duties more equally produced nestlings that grew faster. Faster nestling development enables earlier fledging in case of predation attempts at the end of nesting period. Thus parents who more evenly participate in provisioning may benefit from higher breeding success. Our findings suggest that in species under high risk of nest predation disparity in parental investment may not provide much benefit to parent’s residual reproductive value and that equality in parental duties constitutes a winning strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2902256195,"Biological invasions are one of the major causes of biodiversity loss worldwide. In spite of human aided (anthropogenic) dispersal being the key element in the spread of invasive species, no framework published so far accounts for its peculiar characteristics, such as very rapid dispersal and independence from the existing species distribution. We present a new method for modelling biological invasions using historical spatio-temporal records. This method first discriminates between data points of anthropogenic origin and those originating from natural dispersal, then estimates the natural dispersal kernel. We use the expectation-maximisation algorithm for the first step; we then use Ripley’s K-function as a spatial similarity metric to estimate the dispersal kernel. This is done accounting for habitat suitability and providing estimates of the inference precision. Tests on simulated data show good accuracy and precision for this method, even in the presence of challenging, but realistic, limitations of data in the invasion time series, such as gaps in the survey times and low number of records. We also provide a real case application of our method using the case of Litoria frogs in New Zealand. This method is widely applicable across the field of biological invasions, epidemics and climate change induced range shifts and provides a valuable contribution to the management of such issues. Functions to implement this methodology are made available as the R package Biolinv (https://cran.r-project.org/package=Biolinv)."
