https://openalex.org/W2971220345,"Cancer-induced immune responses affect tumour progression and therapeutic response. In multiple murine models and clinical datasets, we identified large variations of neutrophils and macrophages that define 'immune subtypes' of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), including neutrophil-enriched (NES) and macrophage-enriched subtypes (MES). Different tumour-intrinsic pathways and mutual regulation between macrophages (or monocytes) and neutrophils contribute to the development of a dichotomous myeloid compartment. MES contains predominantly macrophages that are CCR2-dependent and exhibit variable responses to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). NES exhibits systemic and local accumulation of immunosuppressive neutrophils (or granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells), is resistant to ICB, and contains a minority of macrophages that seem to be unaffected by CCR2 knockout. A MES-to-NES conversion mediated acquired ICB resistance of initially sensitive MES models. Our results demonstrate diverse myeloid cell frequencies, functionality and potential roles in immunotherapies, and highlight the need to better understand the inter-patient heterogeneity of the myeloid compartment."

https://openalex.org/W2970844958,"The exact etiology of dementia is still unclear, but both genetic and lifestyle factors are thought to be key drivers of this complex disease. The recognition of familial patterns of dementia has led to the discovery of genetic factors that have a role in the pathogenesis of dementia, including the apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype and a large and still-growing number of genetic variants1,2. Beyond genetic architecture, several modifiable risk factors have been implicated in the development of dementia3. Prevention trials of measures to halt or delay cognitive decline are increasingly recruiting older individuals who are genetically predisposed to dementia. However, it remains unclear whether targeted health and lifestyle interventions can attenuate or even offset increased genetic risk. Here, we leverage long-term data on both genetic and modifiable risk factors from 6,352 individuals aged 55 years and older in the population-based Rotterdam Study. In this study, we demonstrate that, in individuals at low and intermediate genetic risk, favorable modifiable-risk profiles are related to a lower risk of dementia compared to unfavorable profiles. In contrast, these protective associations were not found in those at high genetic risk."
https://openalex.org/W2971103725,"Nervous system function relies on complex assemblies of distinct neuronal cell types that have unique anatomical and functional properties instructed by molecular programs. Alternative splicing is a key mechanism for the expansion of molecular repertoires, and protein splice isoforms shape neuronal cell surface recognition and function. However, the logic of how alternative splicing programs are arrayed across neuronal cells types is poorly understood. We systematically mapped ribosome-associated transcript isoforms in genetically defined neuron types of the mouse forebrain. Our dataset provides an extensive resource of transcript diversity across major neuron classes. We find that neuronal transcript isoform profiles reliably distinguish even closely related classes of pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons in the mouse hippocampus and neocortex. These highly specific alternative splicing programs selectively control synaptic proteins and intrinsic neuronal properties. Thus, transcript diversification via alternative splicing is a central mechanism for the functional specification of neuronal cell types and circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2970317380,"A major limitation of current humanized mouse models is that they primarily enable the analysis of human-specific pathogens that infect hematopoietic cells. However, most human pathogens target other cell types, including epithelial, endothelial and mesenchymal cells. Here, we show that implantation of human lung tissue, which contains up to 40 cell types, including nonhematopoietic cells, into immunodeficient mice (lung-only mice) resulted in the development of a highly vascularized lung implant. We demonstrate that emerging and clinically relevant human pathogens such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Zika virus, respiratory syncytial virus and cytomegalovirus replicate in vivo in these lung implants. When incorporated into bone marrow/liver/thymus humanized mice, lung implants are repopulated with autologous human hematopoietic cells. We show robust antigen-specific humoral and T-cell responses following cytomegalovirus infection that control virus replication. Lung-only mice and bone marrow/liver/thymus-lung humanized mice substantially increase the number of human pathogens that can be studied in vivo, facilitating the in vivo testing of therapeutics. Implantation of lung tissue into humanized mice enables in vivo study of the human immune response to pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2971086850,"Sensory photoreceptor proteins underpin light-dependent adaptations in nature and enable the optogenetic control of organismal behavior and physiology. We identified the bacterial light-oxygen-voltage (LOV) photoreceptor PAL that sequence-specifically binds short RNA stem loops with around 20 nM affinity in blue light and weaker than 1 µM in darkness. A crystal structure rationalizes the unusual receptor architecture of PAL with C-terminal LOV photosensor and N-terminal effector units. The light-activated PAL-RNA interaction can be harnessed to regulate gene expression at the RNA level as a function of light in both bacteria and mammalian cells. The present results elucidate a new signal-transduction paradigm in LOV receptors and conjoin RNA biology with optogenetic regulation, thereby paving the way toward hitherto inaccessible optoribogenetic modalities."
https://openalex.org/W2971054914,"Reduction of tetrazolium salts to colored formazan products by metabolically active cells is widely used for assessment of cell viability. Among the tetrazolium compounds most commonly used is MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide]. Numerous studies about sites and mechanisms of cellular reduction of MTT, performed in mammalian cell cultures, have identified various parameters that affect formazan production and can lead to overestimation/underestimation of viable cells or effects of treatment. Irrespective of lack of such data for prokaryotic cells, the MTT assay is commonly used for microbiological studies, which often leads to contradictory results or misinterpretation of data. The aim of this study was to investigate how components of growth media and conditions of growth, affect formazan formation by microbial cells. Results showed that MTT reduction depended on the amino acid composition of the medium. Several amino acids potentiated formazan production by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, with histidine having the strongest effect. Results of this study demonstrate that data obtained with the MTT test should be interpreted with caution, particularly when different growth media are used or treatments affect metabolic pathways, and that evaluation of the reliability of the MTT assay under specific conditions should be performed, to avoid erroneous results. Performing the assay with cells suspend in glucose-supplemented buffer would eliminate the effects of metabolites and will limit cell division during incubation with MTT. Another critical element to be considered is the choice of a proper solvent for dissolution of formazan crystals."
https://openalex.org/W2970461004,"Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) selectively deliver chemotherapeutic agents to target cells and are important cancer therapeutics. However, the mechanisms by which ADCs are internalized and activated remain unclear. Using CRISPR-Cas9 screens, we uncover many known and novel endolysosomal regulators as modulators of ADC toxicity. We identify and characterize C18ORF8/RMC1 as a regulator of ADC toxicity through its role in endosomal maturation. Through comparative analysis of screens with ADCs bearing different linkers, we show that a subset of late endolysosomal regulators selectively influence toxicity of noncleavable linker ADCs. Surprisingly, we find cleavable valine-citrulline linkers can be processed rapidly after internalization without lysosomal delivery. Lastly, we show that sialic acid depletion enhances ADC lysosomal delivery and killing in diverse cancer cell types, including with FDA (US Food and Drug Administration)-approved trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) in Her2-positive breast cancer cells. Together, these results reveal new regulators of endolysosomal trafficking, provide important insights for ADC design and identify candidate combination therapy targets."
https://openalex.org/W2970797228,"The Chinese Big Five Personality Inventory (CBF-PI), a 134-item self-report scale, and its 40-item brief version (CBF-PI-B) are sound psychometric instruments used to measure the Big Five personality domains in the Chinese population. However, their applicability is limited by their length, as well as restricted by assessment conditions. In this study, we developed and validated a new shortened version with 15 items (CBF-PI-15) through exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis in a large sample (Sample 1) of 10,738 Chinese adults (mean = 33.90 years, SD = 9.39 years, range 17-57 years). Measurement invariance results suggested the CBF-PI-15 were invariant across gender and age groups. Convergent, discriminant and criterion validities were tested in Sample 2 (N = 256, mean = 21.62 years, SD = 3.06 years, range 18-35 years) and findings showed an expected correlational pattern with external variables. Results revealed positive correlations of Neuroticism with the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale Brief Version (BIS-Brief), the Patient Health Questionnaire, and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener, as well as a strongly negative correlation between Conscientiousness and BIS-Brief. Additionally, Conscientiousness positively correlated with academic performance as expected. In conclusion, the CBF-PI-15 holds promise as an informative alternative for the original CBF-PI-B when administration time or conditions are limited, and our findings provide preliminary support for the utility of the CBF-PI-15."

https://openalex.org/W2970060476,"DNA methylation has frequently been implicated in sex determination and differentiation in teleost species. In order to detect the DNA methylation patterns established during sexual differentiation in tiger pufferfish T. rubripes, we performed comprehensive whole genome methylation sequencing and analyses of the gonads of male, female, and pseudo male. We obtained a total of 33.12, 32.44, and 31.60 Gb clean data for male, female, and pseudo male, with a sequencing depth of 66.44×, 60.47× and 54.86×, respectively. The methylation level of cytosine (C) residues in the genomic DNA from gonads was 11.016%, 10.428%, and 11.083% in male, female, and pseudo male, respectively. More than 65% of C methylation was at CpG sites, and less than 1% was at CHG and CHH sites. In each regulatory element, there were low methylation levels on both sides of the transcription start site, and higher methylation levels in exons, introns, and downstream of genes. The highest mCpG was on chromosome 8 and the lowest mCpG was on chromosome 5. Comparisons of whole-genome DNA methylation between pairs of samples revealed that there were 3,173 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between female and male, and 3,037 DMRs between male and pseudo male, corresponding to 0.232% and 0.223% of the length of the genome, respectively. There were only 1,635 DMRs between female and pseudo male, representing 0.127% of the length of the genome. A number of differentially methylated genes (DMGs) related to sex determination and differentiation were selected, such as amhr2 and pfcyp19a. After Bisulfite Sequencing PCR (BSP) verification, amhr2 was exhibited low methylation level in normal males and pseudo male, and high methylation level in normal females but pfcyp19a showed low methylation level in normal females and high methylation level in normal males and pseudo males. These results provide information about the molecular epigenetic mechanisms of DNA methylation during low-temperature induced masculinization of tiger pufferfish, and increase our understanding of the mechanisms of sex determination and differentiation in this important aquaculture fish species."
https://openalex.org/W2970611269,"We have developed a diagnostic technique to evaluate hepatic steatosis using the attenuation coefficient (ATT) in ultrasound B mode imaging. A controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) by vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) has also been used to evaluate hepatic steatosis. As that method uses ultrasound A mode, visualizing the liver in real time is difficult. We designed this clinical study to evaluate the diagnostic advantage of our technique using ATT compared to CAP.The study group included 94 patients with chronic liver disease who had undergone both ATT and CAP assessment at the time of liver biopsy. The M-probe and XL-probe were used for CAP measurement. Data for ATT and CAP were compared as a function of the steatosis grade.The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROCs) for ATT and PAC as a function of the steatosis grade were as follows: grade 1, 0.74 and 0.81; grade 2, 0.80 and 0.85; and grade 3, 0.96 and 0.98, respectively.The accuracy of steatosis grade diagnosis using ATT was the same as that using CAP, with no significant differences and with the added advantage of B mode ultrasound being more convenient and rapid, compared to A mode ultrasound, particularly for patients with subcutaneous fat thickness ≥2 cm."
https://openalex.org/W2971163061,"The impact of black cumin usage on some qualitative properties and formation of heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs) in meatball production was investigated. It was found that black cumin usage rate, cooking process and temperature had a significant effect (p<0,01) on the water content, pH, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) values of meatballs. On the other hand, black cumin usage significantly (p<0,01) reduced the water content and cooking loss. The water content and cooking loss of the meatballs decreased with increases in the usage rate. While IQx, IQ, MeIQ, 7,8-DiMeIQx, 4,8-DiMeIQx, AαC, and MeAαC could not be detected in meatballs, varying amounts of MeIQx (up to 1,53 ng/g) and PhIP (up to 1,22 ng/g) were determined. The total amounts of HAAs ranged between non-detected (nd) to 2,75 ng/g. Both the usage rate and cooking temperature had a very significant effect (p<0,01) on the total contents of HAAs. The total amounts of HAAs were decreased in correlation with the increases in the usage rate; the proportion which is increased when the cooking temperature increased as well. Results of the present study suggested that addition of black cumin may have a substantial role in decreasing the TBARS value, cooking loss, and HAA contents during meatball production. Therefore, using of black cumin in meatball production has been suggested."
https://openalex.org/W2971209630,"The discovery of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor (PHI) has revolutionized the treatment strategy for renal anemia. However, the presence of multiple transcription targets of HIF raises safety concerns regarding HIF-PHI. Here, we explored the dose-dependent effect of MK-8617 (MK), a kind of HIF-PHI, on renal fibrosis. MK was administered by oral gavage to mice for 12 wk at doses of 1.5, 5, and 12.5 mg/kg. In vitro, the human proximal tubule epithelial cell line HK-2 was treated with increasing doses of MK administration. Transcriptome profiling was performed, and fibrogenesis was evaluated. The dose-dependent biphasic effects of MK on tubulointerstitial fibrosis (TIF) were observed in chronic kidney disease mice. Accordingly, high-dose MK treatment could significantly enhance TIF. Using RNA-sequencing, combined with in vivo and in vitro experiments, we found that Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) expression level was significantly increased in the proximal tubular cells, which could be transcriptionally regulated by HIF-1α with high-dose MK treatment but not low-dose MK. Furthermore, our study clarified that HIF-1α-KLF5-TGF-β1 signaling activation is the potential mechanism of high-dose MK-induced TIF, as knockdown of KLF5 reduced TIF in vivo. Collectively, our study demonstrates that high-dose MK treatment initiates TIF by activating HIF-1α-KLF5-TGF-β1 signaling. These findings provide novel insights into TIF induction by high-dose MK (HIF-PHI), suggesting that the safety dosage window needs to be emphasized in future clinical applications.-Li, Z.-L., Lv, L.-L., Wang, B., Tang, T.-T., Feng, Y., Cao, J.-Y., Jiang, L.-Q., Sun, Y.-B., Liu, H., Zhang, X.-L., Ma, K.-L., Tang, R.-N., Liu, B.-C.

https://openalex.org/W2971242326,"Sustainable management of leachate produced from the dumpsite is one of the major concerns in developing countries Aquatic plants such as duckweed have the potential to remove pollutants from wastewater which can also be cost-effective and feasible options for leachate treatment. Therefore, the objective of our present study was to examine the growth and nutrient removal efficiency of duckweed (Lemna minor) on leachate. Three tests were performed each by growing lemna minor on synthetic leachate under controlled conditions and on dumpsite leachate under natural conditions. During each test, duckweed was grown in 300 ml plastic containers with a surface area of 25.8 cm2. About 60 mg of fresh mass of duckweed was grown on 250 ml leachate at an internal depth of 9.5 cm. Results revealed that, in comparison to synthetic leachate, duckweed removed Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), nitrogen (N), and phosphorous (P) more efficiently from dumpsite leachate under natural climatic conditions. However, the amounts of N and P absorbed into duckweed body mass were about 16% and 35% respectively more at synthetic leachate under controlled conditions. Maximum growth rate of duckweed (7.03 g m-2 day-1) was also observed for synthetic leachate in comparison to the growth rate of 4.87 g m-2 day-1 at dumpsite leachate. Results of this study provide a useful interpretation of duckweed growth and nutrient removal dynamics from leachate under natural and laboratory conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2970013364,"Fosmidomycin and related molecules comprise a family of phosphonate natural products with potent antibacterial, antimalarial and herbicidal activities. To understand the biosynthesis of these compounds, we characterized the fosmidomycin producer, Streptomyces lavendulae, using biochemical and genetic approaches. We were unable to elicit production of fosmidomycin, instead observing the unsaturated derivative dehydrofosmidomycin, which we showed potently inhibits 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase and has bioactivity against a number of bacteria. The genes required for dehydrofosmidomycin biosynthesis were established by heterologous expression experiments. Bioinformatics analyses, characterization of intermediates and in vitro biochemistry show that the biosynthetic pathway involves conversion of a two-carbon phosphonate precursor into the unsaturated three-carbon product via a highly unusual rearrangement reaction, catalyzed by the 2-oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenase DfmD. The required genes and biosynthetic pathway for dehydrofosmidomycin differ substantially from that of the related natural product FR-900098, suggesting that the ability to produce these bioactive molecules arose via convergent evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2970710421,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has been reported to have a positive effect on sleep-wake disturbance in Parkinson's disease (PD). We aimed to investigate the long-term effects of STN DBS on sleep in patients with PD.Sixty-one patients with PD who had undergone bilateral STN DBS were followed for 3 years with assessments including the Parkinson's disease sleep scale (PDSS), Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), total sleep hours per day, Unified PD Rating Scale part I-III, Hoehn & Yahr stage, levodopa equivalent dose, quality of life measure, and depression scale measured preoperatively and at 6 months after postoperatively, and annually thereafter.Among the 61 patients at baseline, 46 patients completed the last follow-up assessment. The total PDSS score significantly improved after STN DBS from baseline up to 3 years after STN DBS (79.0±30, 100.0±23.3, 98.8±23.0, 97.1±29.6, and 93.3±28.0 at baseline, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively, p = 0.006 for the change over time). Among the eight PDSS domains, the domains for overall quality of a night's sleep, sleep onset and maintenance insomnia, and nocturnal motor symptoms showed significant improvement after STN DBS (p = 0.036, 0.029, and < 0.001, respectively, for the change over time). The total sleep hours per day were increased, but the total ESS score did not show significant change after STN DBS (p = 0.001 and 0.055, respectively, for the change over time). Changes in the total PDSS were associated with changes in the depression and motivation items in the Unified PD Rating Scale part I, depression scale, and quality of life measure, but those variables at baseline were not predictive of changes in the total PDSS after STN DBS.In the largest systematic long-term follow-up study, the improvement in subjective sleep quality after bilateral STN DBS was sustained in PD patients. Improved nocturnal sleep and nocturnal motor symptoms were correlated with an improved mood and quality of life. However, STN DBS did not reduce excessive daytime sleepiness despite reductions in antiparkinsonian medications."
https://openalex.org/W2971322914,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of butyrolactone-I (A6) on type 2 diabetes (T2D) in db/db mice because A6 was found to inhibit α-glucosidase activities and TNF-α release, which were associated with improving T2D. Male db/db mice were divided into 6 groups and given an equivalent volume of olive oil, acarbose, or different doses of A6 for 4 wk (n = 8/group). In this study, 11 butenolide derivatives were screened for their α-glucosidase and TNF-α suppressive activity in vitro. A6, an efficient α-glucosidase inhibitor, exerts hypoglycemic and multiple activities in reducing weight, improving glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, increasing short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) levels, activating SCFA-induced increases in glucagon-like peptide 1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ expression, enhancing intestinal mucosal barrier function and mitigating endoxemia in db/db mice. These effects may result from mediation of gut microbiota by A6. Meanwhile, A6, with potent TNF-α-lowering properties, was demonstrated to have multiple salutary effects with excellent structural stability and long-term safety in vivo. A6, an effective α-glucosidase inhibitor with high security and stability, exerted potent antidiabetic effects in vivo. Furthermore, the modulation of gut microbiota of A6 was demonstrated to be one of the mechanisms contributing to anti-inflammation properties and improving endoxemia. Our work confirms that the compound A6 is a prospective drug candidate for T2D.-Wu, W., Liu, L., Zhu, H., Sun, Y., Wu, Y., Liao, H., Gui, Y., Li, L., Liu, L., Sun, F., Lin, H.

https://openalex.org/W2970492920,"For the evaluation of infectious-diseases interventions, the transmissible nature of such diseases plays a central role. Agent-based models (ABM) allow for dynamic transmission modeling but publications are limited. We aim to provide an overview of important characteristics of ABM for decision-analytic modeling of infectious diseases. A case study of dengue epidemics illustrates model characteristics, conceptualization, calibration and model analysis. First, major characteristics of ABM are outlined and discussed based on ISPOR and ISPOR-SMDM Good Practice guidelines. Second, in our case study, we modeled a dengue outbreak in Cebu City (Philippines) to assess the impact interventions to control the relative growth of the mosquito population. Model outcomes include prevalence and incidence of infected persons. The modular ABM simulates persons and mosquitoes over an annual time horizon considering daily time steps. The model was calibrated and validated. ABM is a dynamic, individual-level modeling approach that is capable to reproduce direct and indirect effects of interventions for infectious diseases. The ability to replicate emerging behavior and to include human behavior or the behavior of other agents is a distinguishing modeling characteristic (e.g., compared to Markov models). Modeling behavior may, however, require extensive calibration and validation. The analyzed hypothetical effectiveness of dengue interventions showed that a reduced human-mosquito ratio of 1:2.5 during rainy seasons leads already to a substantial decrease of infected persons. ABM can support decision-analyses for infectious diseases including disease dynamics, emerging behavior, and providing a high level of reusability due to modularity."
https://openalex.org/W2970794632,"According to the coordination control of a dynamic voltage restorer (DVR) and an inductive fault current limiter (FCL), this paper proposes an efficient low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) scheme for a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) based wind turbine. The DVR is located to the DFIG’s stator circuit for stabilizing the terminal voltage and decreasing the generator current. The inductive FCL is connected to the DFIG’s rotor circuit for suppressing the rotor overcurrent and protecting the converter. Theoretical discussions on structure, principle and scale criterion of the combined DVR-FCL are conducted, and simulation analyses of the proposed approach to handle symmetrical and asymmetrical faults are done in MATLAB/Simulink. In this study, the dynamic characteristics of the DFIG during the faults are analyzed from multiple aspects, and a detailed comparison of the proposed approach and the single action of DVR or FCL is carried out. From the simulation results, the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach are well demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W2971062436,"The development of efficacious and safe drugs for the treatment of neurological diseases related to glutamate toxicity has been a focus in neuropharmacological research. Specifically, discovering antagonists to modulate the activity and kinetics of AMPA receptors, which are the fastest ligand-gated ion channels involved in excitatory neurotransmission in response to glutamate. Thus, the current study investigated novel curcumin derivatives on the biophysical properties of AMPA receptors, specifically on the homomeric GluA2 and the heteromeric GluA2/A3 subunits and assessed for inhibitory actions. The biophysical parameter (i.e., desensitization, deactivation, and peak currents) were measured by using whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology with and without the administration of the derivatives onto HEK293 cells. CR-NN, CR-NNPh, CR-MeNH, and CR-NO of the tested derivatives showed inhibition on all AMPA receptors up to 6 folds. Moreover, the inhibitory derivatives also increased desensitization and deactivation, which further intensifies the compounds’ neuroprotective effects. However, CR-PhCl, CR-PhF, and CR-PhBr did not show any significant changes on the peak current, deactivation or desensitization rates. By comparison to other discovered and widely used antagonist, the prepared curcumin derivatives are not selective to a specific AMPA subunit, instead implement its effect in the same way between all types of AMPA receptors. Additionally, the obtained results provide derivatives that not only noncompetitively inhibit AMPARs but also decrease its biophysical kinetics, specifically desensitization and deactivation rates. Hence, to potentially serve as a new AMPAR inhibitor with therapeutic potential, the current study provides compounds that are non-selective and non-competitive antagonist, which also effect the desensitization and deactivation rates of the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2970827999,"Objective To determine the impact of sleeve gastrectomy in patients suffering from depression compared with those who are not in a depressive state. Introduction Obesity is considered a global epidemic. Often patients with obesity suffer from depressive state. Depressive disorders may be both a cause and a consequence of obesity. Material and methods The study includes 300 consecutives patients that underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Out of the 300 patients, 253 (84.33%) of them completed the follow up for three years. Results Out of the 300-patients, with the average age of 41.65±11.05 years old, the ratio of males to females was 1:2. The average baseline BMI was 42.02 kg/m2. A total of 105 (35.33%) of the patients suffer from depression, which was more common in male (43%) than in female (31.5%), with statistically significant difference (p = .05). Comparing the weight loss after surgery in both groups, the mean weight loss in the depression-group was 12.0 ΔBMI and in the non-depression group was 13.03 ΔBMI, (p< .001). After three years, 94 (88.68%) patients of the depression group responded as they were optimistic and satisfied with the results of the operation, with positive changes in their lives, 8 (7.55%) did not experience change and 4 (3.77%) expressed to have worsened their depressive state. Conclusion Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is successful and leads to weight loss even in subjects who are affected by depression syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2970218859,"China is facing severe pressure on its water resources and water environments. Calculating the industrial water efficiency of each province is an important index for the central government to evaluate local governments. In the traditional water resources evaluation index, the industrial water use efficiency and pollutant discharge are evaluated separately. In this paper, we collected industrial input data, output data and pollutant discharge data with a four-stage data envelopment analysis to calculate China's industrial water use efficiency with and without considering pollutant discharge, and then analyzed the factors influencing the industrial water use efficiency. The results show that the eastern coastal provinces of China have the highest water use efficiency and are less affected by pollutant discharge than other provinces. The industrial water use efficiency of the central and western provinces is lower than that of the other provinces, and the industrial water use efficiency in the central provinces is greatly affected by pollutant discharge. Factor endowment, economic development level, scientific and technological progress, industrial structure, proportion of foreign investment, water consumption per 10000 yuan of value-added by industry, industrial sewage treatment capacity and educational investment have a significant influence on the industrial water use efficiency of China. We suggest that the government strengthen the construction of sewage plants and other related infrastructure in central provinces when conducting the industrial transfer of heavy polluting enterprises."
https://openalex.org/W2970327300,"Ozone is an asthma trigger. In mice, the gut microbiome contributes to ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness, a defining feature of asthma, but the mechanistic basis for the role of the gut microbiome has not been established. Gut bacteria can affect the function of distal organs by generating metabolites that enter the blood and circulate systemically. We hypothesized that global metabolomic profiling of serum collected from ozone exposed mice could be used to identify metabolites contributing to the role of the microbiome in ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness. Mice were treated for two weeks with a cocktail of antibiotics (ampicillin, neomycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin) in the drinking water or with control water and then exposed to air or ozone (2 ppm for 3 hours). Twenty four hours later, blood was harvested and serum analyzed via liquid-chromatography or gas-chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Antibiotic treatment significantly affected 228 of the 562 biochemicals identified, including reductions in the known bacterially-derived metabolites, equol, indole propionate, 3-indoxyl sulfate, and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate, confirming the efficacy of the antibiotic treatment. Ozone exposure caused significant changes in 334 metabolites. Importantly, ozone-induced changes in many of these metabolites were different in control and antibiotic-treated mice. For example, most medium and long chain fatty acids declined by 20–50% with ozone exposure in antibiotic-treated but not control mice. Most taurine-conjugated bile acids increased with ozone exposure in antibiotic-treated but not control mice. Ozone also caused marked (9-fold and 5-fold) increases in the polyamines, spermine and spermidine, respectively, in control but not antibiotic-treated mice. Each of these metabolites has the capacity to alter airway responsiveness and may account for the role of the microbiome in pulmonary responses to ozone."
https://openalex.org/W2970449971,"Although the distribution of cellular membrane phospholipid composition is well characterised in human erythrocytes, in-vivo turnover and dynamic flux of phospholipids between plasma and erythrocytes in physiological and in particular during disease states are mostly unknown. Erythrocyte mass primarily consisted of lipids and phosphatidylcholine (PC) contributes to the significant proportion of phospholipid membrane composition. Esterified membrane PC can be utilised during pathological processes to generate pro and anti-inflammatory lipid mediators, which can contribute to the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In this study, utilising isotope labelling of choline and analytical methods with electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS), we characterised individual molecular composition and dynamic exchange of PC, sphingomyelins (SM) and lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC) between plasma and erythrocytes. In ARDS patients, there were significant alterations in PC molecular composition, coupled with a continuous loss of arachidonoyl-PC species over time. Infusion of methyl-D9-choline chloride resulted in enrichment of labelled choline into plasma PC and LPC via CDP-choline pathway with subsequent incorporation into erythrocyte PC. As expected, erythrocyte methyl-D9 PC enrichment is much slower than plasma. Patients had much faster and higher fractional enrichment of all PC and LPC molecules suggesting increased flux between plasma and erythrocytes. There was a particular pattern of incorporation, where the arachidonoyl-PC species achieved equilibrium with plasma rapidly and retained highest concentrations of enrichment compared to the other PC species.

https://openalex.org/W2970189298,"Background Despite the increasing number of homecare workers, a reliable and valid tool with which to measure burnout among Korean homecare workers is still lacking. The aim of this study was to examine the reliability and construct validity of the Korean version of the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI-K). Methods The study population consisted of 465 homecare workers. Data were collected in 2016 through a self-administered questionnaire including the three subscales of the CBI-K, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD-10), a measure of work–life conflict, and questions about respondents’ sociodemographic characteristics. Results The confirmatory factor analyses results showed that the model fit indices of the refined three-factor model, in which the PB, WRB, and CRB subscales each contained six items, were acceptable (CFI = 0.924, SRMR = 0.049, RMSEA = 0.091). Furthermore, based on the results for construct reliability, discriminant validity of the refined three-factor model and job characteristics of homecare workers, we proposed that an abbreviated two-factor scale using the PB and CRB subscales could be used, with appropriate model fit indices (CFI = 0.950, SRMR = 0.047, RMSEA = 0.084). Each of the PB, WRB, and CRB subscales of CBI-K were associated with depressive symptoms even after controlling for covariates. Conclusions The CBI-K has adequate reliability and validity for use with homecare workers. To increase its practicality, we suggest a refined form comprising only PB and CRB subscales can be used rather than a three-factor model."
https://openalex.org/W2971260380,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) infection in lung causes pulmonary fibrosis, which leads to the irreversible reduction of pulmonary function. Fibrotic protein connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) expression has been confirmed to play a crucial role in lung fibrosis. However, the underlying signal pathway and effect of M.tb on CTGF expression in human lung fibroblasts are unclear. Our results revaled that M.tb caused time- and concentration-dependent increases in CTGF expression in human lung fibroblasts. A mechanistic investigation revealed that M.tb induced CTGF expression through TLR2 but not TLR4. The promoter activity assay indicated that M.tb-induced CTGF activity was mainly controlled by the promoter region at -747 to -184 bp, which contained signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and activator protein 1 (AP-1) binding sites. Moreover, curcumin (AP-1 inhibitor) restrained M.tb-induced CTGF expression. M.tb also induced increases in AP-1 luciferase activity and DNA binding activity of c-Jun and c-Fos on the CTGF promoter. Furthermore, the knockdown of c-Jun by small interfering RNA attenuated M.tb-induced CTGF expression and AP-1 luciferase activity. A JNK inhibitor (SP600125) and a JNK dominant-negative mutant suppressed M.tb-induced CTGF expression. We also discovered that M.tb could induce the phosphorylation of JNK and c-Jun. Furthermore, SP600125 inhibited M.tb-induced c-Jun phosphorylation and AP-1- luciferase activity. M.tb-induced fibronectin expression was inhibited by anti-CTGF antibody. These results demonstrate that M.tb is activated through TLR2 to induce JNK activation, further increasing the DNA binding activity of c-Jun and c-Fos and finally inducing CTGF expression and extracellular matrix production.-Lee, H.-S., Hua, H.-S., Wang, C.-H., Yu, M.-C., Chen, B.-C., Lin, C.-H.

https://openalex.org/W2970270322,"Suppressor interacting 3a (Sin3a) is a scaffold component of the chromatin repressive complex Sin3/histone deacetylase (Hdac). Sin3a has been shown as a hub gene driving preimplantation development in both mice and humans. However, its precise functions during preimplantation development remain unclear. Here, we show that the embryos arrested at morula stage upon specific depletion of Sin3a in mouse early embryos. Given the reduced cell number in Sin3a-depleted embryos, blocked cell proliferation is observed, likely because of the increased level of Trp53 acetylation at lysine 379. Moreover, we found that Sin3a depletion reduces Cdx2 and Tir Na Nog (Nanog), suggesting a failure of the first cell fate decision. In addition, we noted a striking increase of genome-wide DNA methylation, likely attributed to the increased nuclear DNA methyltransferase 1 observed in Sin3a-depleted embryos. Notably, RNA sequencing analyses showed 717 genes are differentially expressed, and Gene Ontology analysis of down-regulated genes (e.g., Hdac1) revealed top enriched terms involving protein deacetylation. Consistently, we confirmed a significant decrease of Hdac1 mRNA and protein abundance. Importantly, the development and Trp53 acetylation in Sin3a-depleted embryos could be rescued by expression of Hdac1 but not Hdac2. In summary, our results indicate a vital role of Sin3a in safeguarding the developmental progression through the morula-to-blastocyst transition via Hdac1.-Zhao, P., Li, S., Wang, H., Dang, Y., Wang, L., Liu, T., Wang, S., Li, X., Zhang, K.

https://openalex.org/W2970777948,"Background This study aims at assessing the validity and reliability of the Spanish version of the Lysholm score, a widely used instrument for assessing knee function and activity level after ligament injuries. Methods Ninety-five participants (67.4% male, 22±5 years) completed the questionnaire twice within 7 days and a subsample of 42 participants completed a test-retest reliability. Reliability, validity and feasibility psychometric properties were studied. The validity of the questionnaire was analysed using ceiling and floor effects. Factor structure and construct validity were analysed with the SF-36, the Hip and Knee Questionnaire (HKQ) and one leg jump test (OLJT). Results Criterion validity with the SF-36 Physical State was moderate (r = 0.50 and p<0.01), poor and inverse relationship (r = -0.31, p<0.01) with HKQ and positive moderate (r = 0.59, p<0.01) with OLJT. Measurement error from MDC90 was 3.9%. Exploratory factor analysis demonstrated a one-factor solution explaining 51.5% of total variance. The x2 test for the one-factor model was significant (x2 = 29.58, df = 20, p < 0.08). Test-retest reliability level was high (ICC2.1 = 0.92, p<0.01) and also the internal consistency (α = 0.77). Conclusion The Spanish Lysholm score demonstrated that it is a reliable and valid instrument that can be used to assess knee function after ligament injuries."
https://openalex.org/W2971185846,"Knock-in (KI) gene targeting can be employed for a wide range of applications in stem cell research. However, vectors for KI require multiple complicated processes for construction, including multiple times of digestion/ligation steps and extensive restriction mapping, which has imposed limitations for the robust applicability of KI gene targeting. To circumvent this issue, here we introduce versatile and systematic methods for generating KI vectors by molecular cloning. In this approach, we employed the Multisite Gateway technology, an efficient in vitro DNA recombination system using proprietary sequences and enzymes. KI vector construction exploiting these methods requires only efficient steps, such as PCR and recombination, enabling robust KI gene targeting. We show that combinatorial usage of the KI vectors generated using this method and site-specific nucleases enabled the precise integration of fluorescent protein genes in multiple loci of human and common marmoset (marmoset; Callithrix jacchus) pluripotent stem cells. The methods described here will facilitate the usage of KI technology and ultimately help to accelerate stem cell research."
https://openalex.org/W2971307037,"Antibody titers against a viral pathogen are typically measured using an antigen binding assay, such as an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which only measures the ability of antibodies to identify a viral antigen of interest. Neutralization assays measure the presence of virus-neutralizing antibodies in a sample. Traditional neutralization assays, such as the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), are often difficult to use on a large scale due to being both labor and resource intensive. Here we describe an Ebola virus fluorescence reduction neutralization assay (FRNA), which tests for neutralizing antibodies, that requires only a small volume of sample in a 96-well format and is easy to automate. The readout of the FRNA is the percentage of Ebola virus-infected cells measured with an optical reader or overall chemiluminescence that can be generated by multiple reading platforms. Using blinded human clinical samples (EVD survivors or contacts) obtained in Liberia during the 2013–2016 Ebola virus disease outbreak, we demonstrate there was a high degree of agreement between the FRNA-measured antibody titers and the Filovirus Animal Non-clinical Group (FANG) ELISA titers with the FRNA providing information on the neutralizing capabilities of the antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W2970112632,"Intrarenal Doppler ultrasonography is a non-invasive method to evaluate the renal blood flow in patients with renal arterial stenosis as well as chronic kidney diseases (CKD). Until recently, the relationship between ultrasonography findings and CKD stage has not been fully understood. Overall, 162 patients with CKD without apparent renal arterial stenosis were included in this study, and the pulsed-wave Doppler ultrasonography findings were evaluated in terms of the following parameters: peak systolic velocity (PSV), end-diastolic velocity (EDV), and resistive index (RI) at the renal arterial trunk, hilum, segmental, and interlobar regions. Age showed a significant negative correlation with the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), kidney size, and aortic PSV. Additionally, age showed a significant positive correlation with RI in all 4 regions. The eGFR showed a positive correlation with the aortic PSV and kidney size, but a negative correlation with RI. Both age and eGFR were found to be independently associated with aortic blood flow. On the intrarenal ultrasound, EDV and RI showed stronger correlations with eGFR than PSV, suggesting that the former indices would be better markers of renal function. In particular, the interlobar EDV was found to be the best index that reflects renal function. Although the RI is also a good marker of renal function, it is confounded by age; thus, its utility would be weaker than that of the EDV. In conclusion, intrarenal pulsed-wave Doppler ultrasonography is a useful tool to estimate and evaluate the renal function; the interlobar EDV may be the best index to estimate the effective perfusion and filtration of the kidneys."
https://openalex.org/W2970468155,"The mathematical models used in predictive microbiology contain parameters that must be estimated based on experimental data. Due to experimental uncertainty and variability, they cannot be known exactly and must be reported with a measure of uncertainty (usually a standard deviation). In order to increase precision (i.e. reduce the standard deviation), it is usual to add extra sampling points. However, recent studies have shown that precision can also be increased without adding extra sampling points by using Optimal Experiment Design, which applies optimization and information theory to identify the most informative experiment under a set of constraints. Nevertheless, to date, there has been scarce contributions to know a priori whether an experimental design is likely to provide the desired precision in the parameter estimates. In this article, two complementary methodologies to predict the parameter precision for a given experimental design are proposed. Both approaches are based on in silico simulations, so they can be performed before any experimental work. The first one applies Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the standard deviation of the model parameters, whereas the second one applies the properties of the Fisher Information Matrix to estimate the volume of the confidence ellipsoids. The application of these methods to a case study of dynamic microbial inactivation, showing how they can be used to compare experimental designs and assess their precision, is illustrated. The results show that, as expected, the optimal experimental design is more accurate than the uniform design with the same number of data points. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that, for some heating profiles, the uniform design does not ensure that a higher number of sampling points increases precision. Therefore, optimal experimental designs are highly recommended in predictive microbiology."
https://openalex.org/W2970135643,"Although low-back pain is considered to be associated with cigarette smoking, the influence of cigarette smoking on the intervertebral discs (IVD) has not been confirmed. We established a rat model of passive cigarette smoking-induced IVD degeneration, and investigated the cytohistological changes in the IVD and the accompanying changes in gene expression. IVD from rats exposed to 8 weeks of passive cigarette smoking were stained with Elastica van Gieson, and exhibited marked destruction of the supportive structure of the reticular matrix in the nucleus pulposus (NP). Positive signals on safranin O, alcian blue, type II collagen and aggrecan staining were decreased in the destroyed structure. Safranin O and type II collagen signals were also decreased in the cartilage end-plate (CEP) after 4- and 8-weeks of cigarette smoking. In the CEP, the potential for apoptosis was increased significantly, as demonstrated by staining for single-strand DNA. However, there were no signs of apoptosis in the NP or annulus fibrosus cells. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that passive cigarette smoking-induced stress stimuli first affect the CEP through blood flow due to the histological proximity, thereby stimulating chondrocyte apoptosis and reduction of the extracellular matrix (ECM). This leads to reduction of the ECM in the NP, destroying the NP matrix, which can then progress to IVD degeneration."

https://openalex.org/W2970932458,"Sampling approaches used to census and monitor populations of flora and fauna are diverse, ranging from simple random sampling to complex hierarchal stratified designs. Usually the approach taken is determined by the spatial and temporal distribution of the study population, along with other characteristics of the focal species. Long-term monitoring programs used to assess seabird population trends are facilitated by their high site fidelity, but are often hampered by large and difficult to access colonies, with highly variable densities that require intensive survey. We aimed to determine the sampling effort required to (a) estimate population size with a high degree of confidence, and (b) detect different scenarios of population change in a regionally important species in the Atlantic, the Manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus). Analyses were carried out using data collected from tape-playback surveys on four islands in the North Atlantic. To explore how sampling effort influenced confidence around abundance estimates, we used the heuristic approach of imagining the areas sampled represented the total population, and bootstrapped varying proportions of subsamples. This revealed that abundance estimates vary dramatically when less than half of all plots (n dependent on the size of the site) is randomly subsampled, leading to an unacceptable lack of confidence in population estimates. Confidence is substantially improved using a multi-stage stratified approach based on previous information on distribution in the colonies. In reality, this could lead to reducing the number of plots required by up to 80%. Furthermore, power analyses suggested that random selection of monitoring plots using a matched pairs approach generates little power to detect overall population changes of 10%, and density-dependent changes as large as 50%, because variation in density between plots is so high. Current monitoring programs have a high probability of failing to detect population-level changes due to inappropriate sampling efforts. Focusing sampling in areas of high density with low plot to plot variance dramatically increases the power to detect year to year population change, albeit at the risk of not detecting increases in low density areas, which may be an unavoidable strategy when resources are limited. We discuss how challenging populations with similar features to seabirds might be censused and monitored most effectively."
https://openalex.org/W2971224914,"Changing environmental conditions, including those caused by human activities, reshape biological communities through both loss of native species and establishment of non-native species in the altered habitats. Dynamic interactions with the abiotic environment impact both immigration and initial establishment of non-native species into these altered habitats. The repeated emergence of disease systems in urban areas worldwide highlights the importance of understanding how dynamic migratory processes affect the current and future distribution and abundance of pathogens in urban environments. In this study, we examine the pattern of invasion of Trypanosoma cruzi-the causative agent of human Chagas disease-in the city of Arequipa, Peru. Phylogenetic analyses of 136 T. cruzi isolates from Arequipa and other South American locations suggest that only one T. cruzi lineage established a population in Arequipa as all T. cruzi isolated from vectors in Arequipa form a recent monophyletic group within the broader South American phylogeny. We discuss several hypotheses that may explain the limited number of established T. cruzi lineages despite multiple introductions of the parasite."
https://openalex.org/W2970344472,"Tongue mobility has shown to be a clinically interesting parameter on functional results after tongue cancer treatment which can be objectified by measuring the Range Of Motion (ROM). Reliable measurements of ROM would enable us to quantify the severity of functional impairments and use these for shared decision making in treatment choices, rehabilitation of speech and swallowing disturbances after treatment.Nineteen healthy participants, eighteen post-chemotherapy patients and seventeen post-surgery patients were asked to perform standardized tongue maneuvers in front of a 3D camera system, which were subsequently tracked and corrected for head and jaw motion. Indicators, such as the left-right tongue range and the deflection angle with the horizontal axis were extracted from the tongue trajectory to serve as a quantitative measure for the impaired tongue mobility.The range and deflection angle showed an excellent intra- and interrater reliability (ICC 0.9) The repeatability experiment showed an average standard deviation of 2.5 mm to 3.5 mm for every movement, except the upward movement. The post-surgery patient group showed a smaller tongue range and higher deflection angle overall than the healthy participants. Post-chemoradiation patients showed less difference in tongue ROM compared with healthy participants. Only a few patients showed asymmetrical movement after treatment, which could not always be explained by T-stage or the side of treatment alone.We introduced a reliable and reproducible method for measuring the ROM and to quantify for motion impairments, that was able to show differences in tongue ROM between healthy subjects and patients after chemoradiation or surgery. Future research should focus on measuring patients with oral cancer pre- and post-treatment in combination with the collection of detailed information about the individual tongue anatomy, so that the full ROM trajectory can be used to identify changes over time and to quantify functional impairment."

They threaten about 100 million people in Shandong Province, and cause illness in thousands of people each year. However, information on the epidemiological characteristics of natural-focal diseases in Shandong Province has been limited. The purpose of the study was to describe and analyze the epidemiological characteristics of natural-focal diseases in Shandong Province, 2009-2017.We describe the incidence and distribution of four natural-focal diseases in Shandong Province using surveillance data from 2009-2017.From 2009-2017, 11123 cases of four natural-focal diseases including 257 deaths were reported in Shandong Province, China. The four natural-focal diseases were severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), typhus, and scrub typhus. The high-risk groups of the four diseases were farmers and the elderly. The incidence rate of scrub typhus was significantly higher in females. However, this difference was not seen in the other three diseases. The four diseases were mainly clustered in the middle-southern part of Shandong Province and the Shandong Peninsula. The annual incidence of SFTS and scrub typhus increased, typhus was relatively stable, and HGA declined. However, the range of SFTS expanded, while HGA shrunk, and typhus and scrub typhus were unchanged. The epidemic period of SFTS and HGA was from May to October, typhus was from October to November, and scrub typhus was from September to November. The fatality rates of SFTS, typhus, scrub typhus, and HGA were 9.19%, 0%, 0.01%, and 2.24%, respectively.Our study described and analyzed the prevalence of natural-focal diseases in Shandong Province, and confirmed that age was closely related to the SFTS fatality rate. This study may help to improve the understanding of the prevalence of natural-focal diseases in Shandong Province in recent years and to better develop accurate prevention and control strategies for natural-focal diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2970558880,"Biological rhythms regulate innumerable physiological processes, yet little is known of factors that regulate many of these rhythms. Disruption in the timing of these rhythms can have devastating impacts on population sustainability. We hypothesized that the timing of the molt infradian rhythm in the crustacean Daphnia magna is regulated by the joint action of the protein E75 and nitric oxide. Further, we hypothesized that disruption of the function of E75 would adversely impact several physiological processes related to growth and reproduction. Analysis of mRNA levels of several genes, involved in regulating the molt cycle in insects, revealed the sequential accumulation of E75, its dimer partner HR3, FTZ-F1, and CYP18a1 during the molt cycle. Exposure to the nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside early in the molt cycle had no effect on E75 or HR3 mRNA levels, but delayed the peak accumulation of FTZ-F1 and CYP18a1 mRNA. The subsequent exuviation was also delayed consistent with the delay in peak accumulation of FTZ-F1 and CYP18a1. These results supported our assertion that nitric oxide binds E75 rendering it incapable of binding HR3. Excess HR3 protein then enhanced the accumulation of the downstream products FTZ-F1 and CYP18a1. Similarly, suppression of E75 mRNA levels, using siRNA, had no effect on mRNA levels of HR3 but elevated mRNA levels of FTZ-F1. Consistent with these molecular responses, the suppression of E75 using siRNA increased the duration of the molt cycle and reduced the number of offspring produced. We conclude that the molt cycle of daphnids is regulated in a manner similar to insects and disruption of E75 results in a lengthening of the molt cycle and a reduction the release of viable offspring."

The present study estimates the shape of pelvis and femur using a principal component analysis (PCA) based method with a limited number of palpable anatomical landmarks (ALs) as predictors. A leave-one-out experiment was designed using 38 pelvises and femurs from a same sample of adult specimens. As expected, prediction errors decrease with the number of ALs. Using the maximum number of easily palpable ALs (13 for pelvis and 4 for femur), average errors were 5.4 and 4.8 mm respectively for pelvis and femur. Better prediction was obtained when the shapes of pelvis and femur were predicted separately without merging the data of both bones. Results also show that the PCA based method is a good alternative to predict hip and lumbosacral joint centers with an average error of 5.0 and 9.2 mm respectively."

We conducted a Web-based survey on sexual contact in Japan to collect data on cumulative (total) heterosexual partners and the number of recent (in the last three or previous three months) heterosexual partners. To determine whether the number of heterosexual contacts in Japan has a power-law tail, we used maximum likelihood fitting methods and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests.

Among married young women aged 20–24 years about 9.1 million are nulliparous. This group remains relatively less reached in maternal nutrition programs. Current estimates of their nutritional status and predictors of body mass index (BMI) are unavailable. Thinness (BMI <18.5 kg/m2), severe thinness (BMI <16 kg/m2), overweight or obesity (BMI ≥ 23kg/m2) prevalence estimates are presented based on a sample of 11,265 married nulliparous adolescents (15–19 years, married, no parity) and 15,358 young women (20–24 years, married, no parity) drawn from the National Family Health Surveys 2005–06 and 2015–16. Trends by age, time and state were analysed. Predictors of BMI were investigated using linear regression. Using BMI for age z score (BAZ) as standard reference, BMI cut-off was calculated for thinness (-2SD) and overweight or obesity (+1SD) among married nulliparous adolescents as recommended for population under 19 years. 35% sampled adolescents and 26% young women were thin; 4%-5% severely thin. Overweight or obesity was higher among married nulliparous young women than married nulliparous adolescents (21% versus 11%). Eight in 1000 were short, thin and young and six in 1000 were short, thin, anemic and young. At 15 years of age, prevalence of thinness based on BMI was 46.5% while based on BAZ, 7.6%. At 24 years of age thinness was 22.5%. Decadal reduction in thinness was half among married nulliparous adolescents (4% points) compared with married nulliparous young women (8% points). Decadal increase in overweight/ obesity ranged from 4% to 5% in both age groups. Western states had high prevalence of thinness; Tamil Nadu had highest prevalence of overweight or obesity. Incremental increase in age and wealth increased BMI among young women more than adolescents. BMI was lower among adolescents and young women wanting a child later than soon [β -0.28 (CI -0.49- -0.07), β -0.33(CI -0.56- -0.093), respectively]. BMI cut-off 16.49 kg/m2 and 24.12 kg/m2 had a high sensitivity (100%, 99.7%) and specificity (98.9%, 98.5%) to screen thin and overweight or obese adolescents, respectively. Owing to the high prevalence of both thinness and overweight/obesity among nulliparous married adolescents and women, nutritional anthropometry based screening should be initiated for this target group, along with a treatment package in states with high and persistent malnutrition. Family planning services should be integrated in nutrition programs for this target group to achieve normal nutritional status before conception."

We and others have reported that LFABP−/− mice become more obese than wildtype (WT) mice upon high-fat feeding. Here, we show that despite increased body weight and fat mass, LFABP−/− mice are protected from a high-fat feeding–induced decline in exercise capacity, displaying an approximate doubling of running distance compared with WT mice. To understand this surprising exercise phenotype, we focused on metabolic alterations in the skeletal muscle due to LFABP ablation. Compared with WT mice, resting skeletal muscle of LFABP−/− mice had higher glycogen and intramuscular triglyceride levels as well as an increased fatty acid oxidation rate and greater mitochondrial enzyme activities, suggesting higher substrate availability and substrate utilization capacity. Dynamic changes in the respiratory exchange ratio during exercise indicated that LFABP−/− mice use more carbohydrate in the beginning of an exercise period and then switch to using lipids preferentially in the later stage. Consistently, LFABP−/− mice exhibited a greater decrease in muscle glycogen stores during exercise and elevated circulating free fatty acid levels postexercise.

STEM learning was hypothesized to be more challenging for impulsive students, since it requires the practice and repetition of tasks as well as concerted attention to task performance. Impulsivity was assessed in a cross-sectional sample of 2,476 students in grades 6–12. Results show impulsivity affects a larger population of students, not limited to students with learning disabilities. Impulsivity was associated with lower sources of self-efficacy for science (SSSE), interest in most STEM domains (particularly math), and self-reported STEM skills. The large negative effect size observed for impulsivity was opposed by higher mindset, which describes a student’s belief in the importance of effort when learning is difficult. Mindset had a large positive effect size associated with greater SSSE, STEM interest, and STEM skills. When modeled together, results offer that mindset interventions may benefit impulsive students who struggle with STEM. Together, these data suggest important interconnected roles for impulsivity and mindset that can influence secondary students’ STEM trajectories."
https://openalex.org/W2970924957,"Path planning for electric vehicles (EVs) can alleviate the limited cruising range and ""range anxiety"". Many existing path optimization models cannot produce satisfactory solutions due to the imposition of too many assumptions and simplifications. The targeted optimal-path problem for electric vehicles (EV-TOP), which is proposed in the paper, aims at identifying the targeted optimal path for EVs under the limited battery level. It minimizes the travel cost, which is composed of the travel time and the total time that is spent at charging stations (CSs). The model is much more realistic due to the prediction and the consideration of the waiting times at CSs and more accurate approximations of the electricity consumption function and the charging function. Charging station information and the road traffic state are utilized to calculate the travel cost. The EV-TOP is decomposed into two subproblems: a constrained optimal path problem in the network (EV1-COP) and a shortest path problem in the meta-network (EV2-SP). To solve the EV1-COP, the Lagrangian relaxation algorithm, the simple efficient approximation (SEA) algorithm, and the Martins (MS) deletion algorithm are used. The EV2-SP is solved using Dijkstra's algorithm. Thus, a polynomial-time approximation algorithm for the EV-TOP is developed. Finally, two computational studies are presented. The first study assesses the performance of the travel cost method. The second study evaluates the performance of our EV-TOP by comparing it with a well-known method."
https://openalex.org/W2970918833,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can act as second messengers in various signaling pathways, and abnormal oxidation contributes to multiple diseases, including cancer. Detecting and quantifying protein oxidation is crucial for a detailed understanding of reduction-oxidation reaction (redox) signaling. We developed an Activated Thiol Sepharose-based proteomic (ATSP) approach to quantify reversible protein oxidation. ATSP can enrich H2O2-sensitive thiol peptides, which are more likely to contain reactive cysteines involved in redox signaling. We applied our approach to analyze hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC), a type of kidney cancer that harbors fumarate hydratase (FH)-inactivating mutations and has elevated ROS levels. Multiple proteins were oxidized in FH-deficient cells, including many metabolic proteins such as the pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2). Treatment of HLRCC cells with dimethyl fumarate or PKM2 activators altered PKM2 oxidation levels. Finally, we found that ATSP could detect Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-2 and PKM2 oxidation in cells stimulated with platelet-derived growth factor. This newly developed redox proteomics workflow can detect reversible oxidation of reactive cysteines and can be employed to analyze multiple physiologic and pathologic conditions.-Xu, Y., Andrade, J., Ueberheide, B., Neel, B.

Methods We conducted MRI experiments in four healthy volunteers, and obtained series of short-axis cardiac images acquired with snapshot balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) and snapshot gradient echo (GRE) using a broad range of spatial resolutions and parallel imaging acceleration factors commonly used in quantitative cardiac MR. We measured regional SNR and TSNR in these datasets and fit the measurements to the PNC model for PN, which assumes that PN scales with signal strength. Results The relationship between SNR and TSNR in human cardiac MR without contrast preparation was well modeled by the PNC model. SNR consistently decreased as the spatial resolution (matrix size) and acceleration factor (R) increased for both GRE and bSSFP imaging. TSNR varied linearly with SNR using GRE imaging, when SNR was low (SNR < 20), and approached an asymptotic limit using bSSFP imaging, when SNR was high (SNR > 40). Conclusions The PNC model can be used to guide the choice of matrix size and acceleration factor to optimize TSNR in stable contrast cardiac MR, such as T2-prepared Blood-Oxygen-Level-Dependent (BOLD) and several variants of Arterial Spin Labeled (ASL) cardiac MR."
