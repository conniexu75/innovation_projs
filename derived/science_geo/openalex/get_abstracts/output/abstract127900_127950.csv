https://openalex.org/W2042716629,"Huntington's disease (HD) is one of an increasing number of human neurodegenerative disorders caused by a CAG/polyglutamine-repeat expansion. The mutation occurs in a gene of unknown function that is expressed in a wide range of tissues. The molecular mechanism responsible for the delayed onset, selective pattern of neuropathology, and cell death observed in HD has not been described. We have observed that mice transgenic for exon 1 of the human HD gene carrying (CAG)115 to (CAG)156 repeat expansions develop pronounced neuronal intranuclear inclusions, containing the proteins huntingtin and ubiquitin, prior to developing a neurological phenotype. The appearance in transgenic mice of these inclusions, followed by characteristic morphological change within neuronal nuclei, is strikingly similar to nuclear abnormalities observed in biopsy material from HD patients."
https://openalex.org/W1981022538,"We report here the identification of a novel cofactor, ACTR, that directly binds nuclear receptors and stimulates their transcriptional activities in a hormone-dependent fashion. ACTR also recruits two other nuclear factors, CBP and P/CAF, and thus plays a central role in creating a multisubunit coactivator complex. In addition, and unexpectedly, we show that purified ACTR is a potent histone acetyltransferase and appears to define a distinct evolutionary branch to this recently described family. Thus, hormonal activation by nuclear receptors involves the mutual recruitment of at least three classes of histone acetyltransferases that may act cooperatively as an enzymatic unit to reverse the effects of histone deacetylase shown to be part of the nuclear receptor corepressor complex."
https://openalex.org/W2079250951,"The mechanism by which an elongated polyglutamine sequence causes neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease (HD) is unknown. In this study, we show that the proteolytic cleavage of a GST-huntingtin fusion protein leads to the formation of insoluble high molecular weight protein aggregates only when the polyglutamine expansion is in the pathogenic range. Electron micrographs of these aggregates revealed a fibrillar or ribbon-like morphology, reminiscent of scrapie prions and beta-amyloid fibrils in Alzheimer's disease. Subcellular fractionation and ultrastructural techniques showed the in vivo presence of these structures in the brains of mice transgenic for the HD mutation. Our in vitro model will aid in an eventual understanding of the molecular pathology of HD and the development of preventative strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2066108933,"BRCA1 localizes to discrete nuclear foci (dots) during S phase. Hydroxyurea-mediated DNA synthesis arrest of S phase MCF7 cells led to a loss of BRCA1 from these structures. Ultraviolet light, mitomycin C, or gamma irradiation produced a similar effect but with no concurrent arrest of DNA synthesis. BARD1 and Rad51, two proteins associated with the BRCA1 dots, behaved similarly. Loss of the BRCA1 foci was accompanied by a specific, dose-dependent change(s) in the state of BRCA1 phosphorylation. Three distinct DNA damaging agents preferentially induced this change in S phase. The S phase BRCA1 phosphorylation response to DNA damage occurred in cells lacking, respectively, two DNA damage-sensing protein kinases, DNA-PK and Atm, implying that neither plays a prime role in this process. Finally, after BRCA1 dot dispersal, BRCA1, BARD1, and Rad51 accumulated, focally, on PCNA+ replication structures, implying an interaction of BRCA1/BARD1/Rad51 containing complexes with damaged, replicating DNA. Taken together, the data imply that the BRCA1 S phase foci are dynamic physiological elements, responsive to DNA damage, and that BRCA1-containing multiprotein complexes participate in a replication checkpoint response."
https://openalex.org/W2052999464,"Using quick-freeze/deep-etch electron microscopy of recombinant proteins adsorbed to mica, we show that NSF, the oligomeric ATPase involved in membrane fusion, is a hollow 10 x 16 nm cylinder whose conformation depends upon nucleotide binding. Depleted of nucleotide, NSF converts to a ""splayed"" protease-sensitive conformation that reveals its subunit composition. NSF's synaptic membrane substrate, the ternary SNARE complex containing syntaxin, SNAP-25, and synaptobrevin, is a 4 x 14 nm rod with a ""tail"" at one end, corresponding to the N-terminus of syntaxin. Using epitope tags, antibodies, and maltose-binding protein markers, we find that syntaxin and synaptobrevin are aligned in parallel in the complex, with their membrane anchors located at the same end of the rod. This SNARE rod binds with alpha-SNAP to one end of the NSF cylinder to form an asymmetric ""20S"" complex. Together, these images suggest how NSF could dissociate the SNARE complex and how association and dissociation of the complex could be related to membrane fusion."
https://openalex.org/W2015186773,"Many protozoans of the phylum Apicomplexa are invasive parasites that exhibit a substrate-dependent gliding motility. Plasmodium (malaria) sporozoites, the stage of the parasite that invades the salivary glands of the mosquito vector and the liver of the vertebrate host, express a surface protein called thrombospondin-related anonymous protein (TRAP) that has homologs in other Apicomplexa. By gene targeting in a rodent Plasmodium, we demonstrate that TRAP is critical for sporozoite infection of the mosquito salivary glands and the rat liver, and is essential for sporozoite gliding motility in vitro. This suggests that in Plasmodium sporozoites, and likely in other Apicomplexa, gliding locomotion and cell invasion have a common molecular basis."
https://openalex.org/W1985253447,"The global transcriptional regulator CtrA controls multiple events in the Caulobacter cell cycle, including the initiation of DNA replication, DNA methylation, cell division, and flagellar biogenesis. CtrA is a member of the response regulator family of two component signal transduction systems and is activated by phosphorylation. We report here that this phosphorylation signal enters the cell cycle at mid S phase. In addition, CtrA function is modulated by temporally and spatially controlled proteolysis. When an active CtrA protein is present at the wrong time in the cell cycle, owing to expression of a mutant CtrA derivative that is active in the absence of phosphorylation and is not turned over during the cell cycle, the G1-to-S transition is blocked and the cell cycle aborts. Thus, both phosphorylation and proteolysis are critical determinants of bacterial cell cycle control in a manner that is analogous to the control of the eukaryotic cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2098665638,"The quantitative contribution of chaperonin GroEL to protein folding in E. coli was analyzed. A diverse set of newly synthesized polypeptides, predominantly between 10–55 kDa, interacts with GroEL, accounting for 10%–15% of all cytoplasmic protein under normal growth conditions, and for 30% or more upon exposure to heat stress. Most proteins leave GroEL rapidly within 10–30 s. We distinguish three classes of substrate proteins: (I) proteins with a chaperonin-independent folding pathway; (II) proteins, more than 50% of total, with an intermediate chaperonin dependence for which normally only a small fraction transits GroEL; and (III) a set of highly chaperonin-dependent proteins, many of which dissociate slowly from GroEL and probably require sequestration of aggregation-sensitive intermediates within the GroEL cavity for successful folding."
https://openalex.org/W2077638073,"Asymmetric division of Drosophila neuroblasts, sensory organ precursor cells, and cells in the procephalic neurogenic region involves the segregation of Numb and Prospero proteins into one of the two daughter cells. We have isolated a novel gene, miranda, based on the ability of its gene product to interact with the Prospero asymmetric localization domain. miranda expression coincides spatially and temporally with asymmetric cell divisions and asymmetric localization of Prospero. Miranda protein is localized asymmetrically, along with Prospero, to the basal cell membrane during mitosis. Loss of miranda gene function abolishes asymmetric Prospero localization during mitosis. The asymmetric localization of Miranda protein requires inscuteable. Our results suggest that miranda functions downstream of inscuteable and works as an adapter that connects Prospero to the basal cell membrane during asymmetric cell division."
https://openalex.org/W1965894414,"The cap structure, m7GpppN, is present at the 5′-end of all eukaryotic cellular (except organellar) mRNAs. Initiation of translation is mediated by the multisubunit initiation factor eIF4F, which binds the cap structure via its eIF4E subunit and facilitates the binding of mRNA to ribosomes. Here, we used recombinant proteins to reconstitute the cap recognition activity of eIF4F in vitro. We demonstrate that the interaction of eIF4E with the mRNA 5′-cap structure is dramatically enhanced by eIF4G, as determined by a UV-induced cross-linking assay. Furthermore, assembly of the eIF4F complex at the cap structure, as well as ATP hydrolysis, is shown to be a requisite for the cross-linking of another initiation factor, eIF4B, to the cap structure. In addition, the stimulatory effect of eIF4G on the cap recognition of eIF4E is inhibited by the translational repressor, 4E-BP1. These results suggest that eIF4E initially interacts with the mRNA cap structure as part of the eIF4F complex.

Lawson T.G. Kramer J.C. Cladaras M.H. Grifo J.A. Abramson R.D. Merrick W.C. Thach R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7651-7658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Rozen F. Edery I.

Lee, unpublished data.. eIF4E activity is regulated by two proteins, termed 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 (8Lin T.A. Kong X. Haystead T.A. Pause A. Belsham G. Sonenberg N. Lawrence Jr., J.

Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). Interaction of 4E-BP1 with eIF4E inhibits specifically cap-dependent translation (9Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.C. Donze O. Lin T.A. Lawrence Jr., J. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). 4E-BPs are rapidly hyperphosphorylated in cells following treatment with insulin and growth factors (10Belsham G.J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 23185-23191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of 4E-BPs decreases the association of 4E-BP1 with eIF4E (9Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.C. Donze O. Lin T.A. Lawrence Jr., J. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). Consequently, phosphorylation of 4E-BPs leads to stimulation of translation. 4E-BP1 competes with eIF4G for binding to eIF4E through similar sequence motifs (12Haghighat A. Mader S. Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5701-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the association of 4E-BP1 with eIF4E prevents the in vitrophosphorylation of eIF4E by protein kinase C, raising the possibility of a temporal relationship between eIF4E binding to 4E-BPs and eIF4E phosphorylation (13Whalen S.G.

Two models were proposed for the pathway of eIF4F assembly and subsequent ribosome binding. One model posits that the first step of ribosome binding is the interaction between eIF4F and the mRNA cap structure (1245270Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory PressCold Spring Harbor, NYSonenberg, N. (ed) (1996) in Translational Control(Hershey, J. W. B., Mathews, M. B., and Sonenberg, N., eds) pp. 245–270, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY.Google Scholar). According to this model, eIF4F in combination with eIF4B and eIF4A, unwinds secondary structure in the 5′-untranslated region of the mRNA, to create a single-stranded region of RNA, which serves as a binding site for the 43 S preinitiation complex. eIF4B and eIF4A were shown to cross-link to the cap structure only in the presence of eIF4F in a process that requires ATP hydrolysis (14Sonenberg N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 1643-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 15Grifo J.A. Tahara S.M. Morgan M.A. Shatkin A.J. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5804-5810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Edery I. Humbelin M. Darveau A. Lee K.A. Milburn S. Hershey J.W. Trachsel H. Sonenberg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11398-11403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Joining of the 43 S ribosomal complex is thought to be mediated through an interaction of the eIF4G subunit and eIF3, the latter being part of the 43 S preinitiation complex. An alternative model for cap recognition postulates that eIF4E alone binds first the cap structure, which is then complexed with eIF4G that is already associated with the ribosome (17Joshi B. Yan R. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2048-2055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This model is based on the finding that in vitrotranslated eIF4G is bound to the 43 S preinitiation complex (17Joshi B. Yan R. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2048-2055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Support for the first model stems from the observation that eIF4F cross-linked much more efficiently to the cap structure than did eIF4E alone (18Lee K.A. Edery I. Sonenberg N. J. Virol. 1985; 54: 515-524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, eIF4E in extracts prepared from poliovirus-infected cells, where the eIF4G subunit is cleaved and as a result eIF4E is associated with the NH2-terminal fragment of eIF4G, cross-links extremely inefficiently to the cap structure (19Lee K.A. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3447-3451Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar,20Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3222-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These results suggest an important function played by eIF4G in the cap recognition process. In this report we reconstituted the eIF4F cap recognition activityin vitro using recombinant components. In a photochemical cross-linking assay, we demonstrate directly that eIF4G increases the affinity of eIF4E for the cap structure. Binding of the eIF4F complex to the cap structure, as well as ATP hydrolysis, is shown to be a requisite for the cross-linking of eIF4B to the cap structure. In addition, 4E-BP1 is shown to inhibit cap binding activity of the eIF4E-eIF4G complex. Murine eIF4E protein was expressed inEscherichia coli K38 and purified as described previously (21Edery I. Altmann M. Sonenberg N. Gene ( Amst .). 1988; 74: 517-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Recombinant flag-eIF4G was expressed in Sf9 insect cells and purified as described previously (22Haghighat A. Svitkin Y. Novoa I. Kuechler E. Skern T. Sonenberg N. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8444-8450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GlutathioneS-transferase (GST) 2The abbreviation used is: GST, glutathioneS-transferase. fusion proteins of HMK-4E-BP1 and HMK-4E-BP1Δ were expressed in E. coli BL21 and purified as described previously (6Mader S. Lee H. Pause A. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4990-4997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant eIF4B was expressed in Sf9 insect cells as follows: for the construction of the baculovirus transfer vector, eIF4B cDNA was excised from the plasmid pGEM3-eIF4B (23Methot N. Pause A. Hershey J.W. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2307-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) with BamHI and subcloned blunt into the NheI site of the p10 transfer vector (24Vialard J. Lalumiere M. Vernet T. Breidis D. Alkhatib G. Henning D. Levin D. Richardson C. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 37-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant baculovirus was generated by cationic liposome cotransfection of p10eIF4B construct with the linearized genomic AcMNPV DNA according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Recombinant virus was isolated (25Summers M.D. Smith G.E. A Manual of Methods for Baculovirus Vectors and Insect Cell Culture Procedures. Texas Agricultural Experiment Station and Texas A & M University, College Station, TX1987Google Scholar), and eIF4B was purified as described previously (26Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2643-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Uncapped RNA encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase was capped and methylated with 6 units of vaccinia virus guanylyltransferase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in the presence of 0.4 mm S-adenosyl-l-methionine and [α-32P]GTP (100 μCi). UV-induced cross-linking was performed in the presence of 1 mm ATP as described previously (20Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3222-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 104 cpm of [32P]mRNA was incubated with initiation factors in a total volume of 20 μl in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 3% glycerol, 100 mm potassium acetate at 30 °C for 10 min. Reaction mixtures were irradiated at 4 °C at a distance of 4 cm with a G15T8 germicidal lamp for 45 min. The RNA was next digested for 30 min at 37 °C with 20 μg of RNase A. Samples were analyzed on acrylamide gels followed by autoradiography. Quantitations were performed using a Fuji BAS2000 phosphorimager. To study the requirements for the interaction of eIF4E with the mRNA cap structure, purified recombinant initiation factors (Fig. 1) were used in a photochemical cross-linking assay (20Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3222-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). mRNA labeled with32P in the cap structure was incubated with protein factors, irradiated with UV light, and RNase-digested. Labeled proteins were then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. In the photochemical cross-linking experiments, RNA is the limiting component in the reaction mixtures. No detectable signal was observed in the absence of protein (Fig. 2 A, lane 1). Similarly, no cross-linking of eIF4E to the cap-labeled mRNA was observed with 10 and 50 ng of purified eIF4E (lanes 2 and 3, respectively). Cross-linking was observed with 100 ng of eIF4E, albeit very inefficient (lanes 4), consistent with previous data (18Lee K.A. Edery I. Sonenberg N. J. Virol. 1985; 54: 515-524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3222-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 27Sonenberg N. Rupprecht K.M. Hecht S.M. Shatkin A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4345-4349Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). We next examined the effect of eIF4G on the cross-linking of eIF4E to the cap structure. No cross-linking of eIF4G to the cap structure was observed (lane 5). Cross-linking of eIF4E to the cap structure was dramatically enhanced in the presence of eIF4G (lanes 6–8). As little as 10 ng of eIF4E was efficiently cross-linked to the cap structure in the presence of flag-eIF4G. Comparison of lanes 4 and 8 reveals a ∼7-fold increase in the cross-linking of eIF4E to the cap structure in the presence of eIF4G. The cross-linking of eIF4E was cap-specific as the interaction was inhibited with 0.6 mm m7GDP (lane 9). To determine the stoichiometry between eIF4E and eIF4G required for efficient cap binding, 10 ng of eIF4E was preincubated with increasing amounts of flag-eIF4G before the addition of the other components (Fig. 2 B). While eIF4E alone did not cross-link to the cap structure (lane 1), addition of Increasing amounts of flag-eIF4G enhanced eIF4E cross-linking to the cap structure in a dose-dependent fashion (lanes 2–6). Under these conditions, ∼10 ng of flag-eIF4G enhanced significantly the cross-linking of eIF4E to the cap (lane 2), with optimum binding occurring at a stoichiometry of 1:1 (lane 4). Cross-linking was inhibited by m7GDP (lane 7), but not by GDP (lane 8).Figure 2eIF4G enhances the cross-linking of eIF4E to mRNA cap structure. eIF4E was cross-linked to32P-cap-labeled RNA (∼2 × 104 cpm) in the presence or absence of flag-eIF4G. A, reactions contained the following amounts of eIF4E: lanes 2 and6, 10 ng; lanes 3 and 7, 50 ng;lanes 4 and 8, 100 ng. Where indicated flag-eIF4G (200 ng) was preincubated with eIF4E. m7GDP (0.6 mm) was included where indicated. B, eIF4E (10 ng) was preincubated with the following amounts of flag-eIF4G:lane 2, 10 ng; lane 3, 20 ng; lane 4, 60 ng; lane 5, 120 ng; lane 6, 240 ng. GDP or m7GDP (0.6 mm each) was included where indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next analyzed the effect of other initiation factors on the cross-linking of eIF4E to the cap structure (Fig. 3). eIF4E alone did not cross-link to the cap structure (Fig. 3, lane 1), as observed above. The interaction of eIF4E with the cap structure was not affected by the presence of eIF4A (lane 5), eIF4B (lane 6), or a combination of eIF4B and eIF4A (lane 7). Cross-linking of eIF4A alone was not observed either (lane 3). Cross-linking of eIF4A to the cap structure can be detected only when using the chemical cross-linking assay, where periodate oxidized mRNA is used (14Sonenberg N.

Similarly, eIF4B failed to cross-link to the cap structure under these conditions (lanes 2, 6, and7). As expected, cross-linking of eIF4E to the cap structure was dramatically enhanced in the presence of flag-eIF4G (lane 8). Flag-eIF4G did not promote, however, the cross-linking of either eIF4A or eIF4B when present alone (lanes 9 and10, respectively), or in combination (lane 11), to the mRNA cap structure. Furthermore, a combination of flag-eIF4G and eIF4E failed to promote cross-linking of eIF4B (lane 12) or eIF4A (lane 13) to the cap structure. Cross-linking of eIF4B was observed only in the presence of all the subunits of the eIF4F complex (eIF4A, eIF4E, and flag-eIF4G; lane 14), as shown earlier (18Lee K.A. Edery I. Sonenberg N. J. Virol. 1985; 54: 515-524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, the specific interaction of eIF4E and eIF4B with the cap structure was insensitive to 0.6 mm GDP (lane 15) and was inhibited by 0.6 mmm7GDP (lane 16). This confirms earlier findings that cross-linking of eIF4B to the cap structure is dependent on eIF4F and ATP hydrolysis (16Edery I. Humbelin M. Darveau A. Lee K.A. Milburn S. Hershey J.W.

Taken together, these results provide direct evidence for the stimulatory effect of eIF4G on the interaction of eIF4E with the cap structure. The activity of eIF4E is inhibited by 4E-BP1, which binds to eIF4E and prevents its interaction with eIF4G to form the eIF4F cap-binding protein complex (8Lin T.A. Kong X. Haystead T.A. Pause A.

Earlier reports showed that binding of 4E-BP1 to eIF4E did not prevent the interaction of eIF4E with a cap-bound matrix (9Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.C. Donze O. Lin T.A. Lawrence Jr., J. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar, 12Haghighat A. Mader S. Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5701-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). However, the effect of 4E-BP1 on eIF4E binding to the cap structure as part of the mRNA has not been determined. As we have shown above, the interaction of eIF4E with the mRNA cap structure is dramatically enhanced when it is bound to eIF4G. This is consistent with the finding that following poliovirus infection, which leads to the cleavage of eIF4G, the cross-linking of eIF4E to the mRNA cap structure is drastically reduced (18Lee K.A. Edery I. Sonenberg N. J. Virol. 1985; 54: 515-524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lee K.A. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3447-3451Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar,20Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3222-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, eIF4E complexed to the amino-terminal cleavage product of eIF4G binds a cap-bound matrix (18Lee K.A. Edery I. Sonenberg N. J. Virol. 1985; 54: 515-524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, eIF4E complexed to 4E-BP1 can efficiently bind the cap affinity column (9Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.C. Donze O. Lin T.A. Lawrence Jr., J. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). Based on the above observations, it is predicted that the cross-linking of eIF4E in an extract (where it binds tightly as part of eIF4F) should be diminished in the presence of 4E-BP1 (12Haghighat A. Mader S. Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5701-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). To examine this, photochemical cross-linking to the mRNA cap structure was performed in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Cross-linking was done in the presence of Mg2+-ATP to detect also eIF4B binding. UV irradiation induced cross-linking of polypeptides of 24, 65, and 80 kDa (Fig. 4 A, lane 1), as shown previously (20Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3222-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The 24- and 80-kDa polypeptides correspond to eIF4E and eIF4B, respectively, while the identity of the 65-kDa polypeptide is not known (20Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3222-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The cross-linking of eIF4E and eIF4B was insensitive to 0.6 mm GDP (lane 2), but was inhibited by the same concentration of m7GDP (lane 3). In contrast, the cross-linking of the 65-kDa polypeptide was not affected by either nucleotide. Strikingly, preincubation of the reticulocyte lysate with GST-4E-BP1 drastically reduced the cross-linking of eIF4E and eIF4B to the cap structure (lane 4). Since eIF4B cross-linking is dependent on eIF4F, it is inhibited in the presence of 4E-BP1, which prevents eIF4F complex formation. These results indicate that eIF4E as a complex with 4E-BP1 interacts weakly with the cap structure, as compared with eIF4E as a subunit of eIF4F. To further substantiate these conclusions, the UV-induced cross-linking assay was performed using purified components as in Figs. 2 and 3. eIF4E alone did not cross-link to the cap structure (Fig. 4 B, lane 1). To examine the effect of 4E-BP1 on the cross-linking of eIF4E to the mRNA cap structure in this reconstituted system, 4E-BP1 was preincubated with eIF4E before the addition of the other components. 4E-BP1 prevented the efficient eIF4E cross-linking that occurs in the presence of flag-eIF4G (lane 2). To verify that the inhibitory effect was a result of a direct interaction between GST-4E-BP1 and eIF4E, a mutant of 4E-BP1 (GST-4E-BP1Δ) was used. GST-4E-BP1Δ contains a deletion of the 4E binding domain and does not repress translation (6Mader S. Lee H. Pause A. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4990-4997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Haghighat A. Mader S. Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5701-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Preincubation of eIF4E with GST-4E-BP1Δ had no effect on the stimulatory effect of eIF4G on the cross-linking of eIF4E to the cap structure (lane 3). The cross-linking of eIF4E to the cap structure in the presence of flag-eIF4G was sensitive to inhibition by 0.6 mm m7GDP (lanes 5). Taken together, these results demonstrate that 4E-BP1 prevents the facilitative effect of eIF4G on the interaction of eIF4E with the mRNA cap structure. In summary, we have reconstituted the cap recognition step of eukaryotic translation initiation in vitro using purified components. We have demonstrated that eIF4G significantly enhances the cap recognition activity of eIF4E, suggesting that eIF4G plays an important role in the mechanism of mRNA cap recognition during eukaryotic translation initiation. Furthermore, 4E-BP1 inhibited the stimulatory effect of eIF4G on the cap binding activity of eIF4E. However, a 4E-BP1·eIF4E complex can be isolated by a cap affinity column (9Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.C. Donze O. Lin T.A. Lawrence Jr., J. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar, 12Haghighat A. Mader S. Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5701-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that eIF4G, because of its RNA binding activity (28Pestova T.V. Shatkin I.N. Hellen C.U.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6870-6878Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), 3H. Lee and C. Goyer, unpublished data.interacts with the RNA in the vicinity of the cap structure and facilitates a stable association between eIF4E and the mRNA 5′-cap structure. Indeed, eIF4F binds much more avidly to RNA than either eIF4E or eIF4A (7Jaramillo M. Dever T.E. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5992-5997Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Our results also indicate that eIF4B can gain access to the cap structure only in the presence of an intact eIF4F complex and ATP hydrolysis. In support of this conclusion, disruption of eIF4F complex by 4E-BP1 interfered with the efficient cross-linking of eIF4B to the cap structure. Taken together, our results indicate that eIF4E initially interacts with the cap structure as a subunit of eIF4F. Several other observations support the hypothesis that eIF4F complex assembly occurs prior to the cap recognition step of translational initiation (18Lee K.A. Edery I. Sonenberg N. J. Virol. 1985; 54: 515-524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lee K.A. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3447-3451Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 20Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3222-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The equilibrium constant (keq) of m7GpppG·eIF4E (mammalian) complex formation has been determined by spectroscopic studies to be 4.8 × 10−5m (29Carberry S.E. Rhoads R.E. Goss D.J.

( Tokyo ). 1991; 109: 882-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This indicates a weak interaction between eIF4E and the cap structure that is unlikely to be favored in vivo. eIF4E as a subunit of eIF4F cross-links 20-fold better to the cap structure than eIF4E alone (31335366Plenum PressNew YorkEdery, I., Lee, K.

Furthermore, Pelletier and Sonenberg (20Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3222-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 32Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Cell. 1985; 40: 515-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) showed that insertion of secondary structures 38 nucleotides downstream from the cap structure had no effect on UV cross-linking of initiation factors to the cap structure, whereas binding of ribosomes to mRNA was impaired, suggesting that eIF4F interaction with the cap structure precedes ribosome binding to mRNA. Based on our results and the studies cited above (19Lee K.A. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3447-3451Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 20Pelletier J. Sonenberg N.

Cell. 1985; 40: 515-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), we favor the model where some localized unwinding of the 5′-untranslated region of mRNA precedes ribosome attachment. Other important parameters have also been implicated in effecting the interaction between eIF4E and the cap structure. Phosphorylation of both eIF4E and eIF4G is enhanced following treatment of cells with growth factors and insulin (33Morley S.J. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10611-10616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). eIF4E is more phosphorylated as a subunit of eIF4F (34Lamphear B.J. Panniers R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 4975-4978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, phosphorylated eIF4E was reported to bind better to the cap structure relative to its unphosphorylated form (37Minich W.B. Balasta M.L. Goss D.J. Rhoads R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7668-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), and only the phosphorylated form of eIF4E is present in the 48 S preinitiation complex (38Joshi-Barve S. Rychlik W. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2979-2983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the association of 4E-BP1 with eIF4E in vitro prevents the phosphorylation of eIF4E (13Whalen S.G.

Phyllopod (PHYL) acts to antagonize this repression by a mechanism that requires Seven In Absentia (SINA) and is associated with decreased TTK88 protein levels, but not reduced ttk88 gene transcription or mRNA stability. We present evidence that SINA, PHYL, and TTK88 physically interact and that SINA interacts genetically and physically with UBCD1, a component of the ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation pathway. Our results suggest a model in which activation of the Sevenless receptor tyrosine kinase induces PHYL expression, which then acts with SINA to target the transcriptional repressor TTK88 for degradation, thereby promoting R7 cell fate specification."

We demonstrate that prospero RNA is also asymmetrically localized and partitioned during neuroblast cell divisions, a process requiring both inscuteable and staufen. Inscuteable and Staufen interact and colocalize with prospero RNA on the apical cortex of interphase neuroblasts. Staufen binds prospero RNA in its 3′UTR. Our findings suggest that Inscuteable nucleates an apical complex and is required for protein localization, spindle orientation, and RNA localization. Stau, as one component of this complex, is required only for RNA localization. Hence staufen also acts zygotically, downstream of inscuteable, to effect aspects of neuroblast asymmetry."

We show that down-regulation of TTK expression occurs in photoreceptor cells and is required for their fate determination. Down-regulation requires the presence of Phyllopod (PHYL), which is induced by the RAS pathway, and Seven In Absentia (SINA). Loss of either gene causes accumulation of TTK in photoreceptor cells, and TTK does not accumulate in cone cells if both PHYL and SINA are present. We report that SINA and PHYL promote ubiquitination and rapid degradation of TTK by the proteasome pathway in cell culture, and both SINA and PHYL bind to the N-terminal domain of TTK. These results argue that photoreceptor differentiation is regulated by the RAS pathway through targeted proteolysis of the TTK repressor."

Here, we identified cis-acting VEGF promoter elements and trans-acting factors which are involved in PDGF-stimulated VEGF expression. By 5′-deletion and transient transfection analysis, a G+C-rich region at −85 to −50 of the human VEGF promoter was shown to be necessary and sufficient for both PDGF inducible and basal expression. The region contains three potential recognition sites for Sp1 transcription factors, which overlap with two Egr-1 sites. Mutations that abolish the ability of Sp1 to interact with the VEGF promoter element also abrogate expression induced by PDGF. Mutations of the potential Egr-1 binding sites did not affect PDGF responsiveness. Gel shift and antibody supershift analyses showed that Sp1 and Sp3 interact constitutively with the VEGF promoter element. Our data strongly suggest that enhanced VEGF gene expression in PDGF-induced NIH3T3 cells is mediated by Sp1 and/or Sp3 transcription factors bound to the −85 to −50 promoter region of the VEGF gene."
https://openalex.org/W2003757684,"The stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs), also known as c-Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNKs), are activated in response to diverse stimuli including DNA damage, heat shock, interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor-α and Fas. Although all these inducers cause apoptosis, whether SAPK/JNK activation is required for apoptosis is controversial. In this study, we demonstrate that ionizing radiation (IR) and dexamethasone (Dex) induce apoptosis in multiple myeloma (MM) derived cell lines, as well as in patient cells. IR-induced apoptosis is associated with activation of SAPK/JNK and p38 kinase, in contrast to Dex-induced apoptosis, which is not associated with activation of stress kinases. Moreover, Dex-induced apoptosis is associated with a significant decrease in the activities of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and p70S6K, whereas IR-treatment does not alter the activity of these kinases. Both IR and Dex induce poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, a signature event of apoptosis. Finally, interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibits Dex-induced apoptosis, downregulation of MAP and p70S6K growth kinases and PARP cleavage; in contrast, IL-6 does not inhibit IR-induced apoptosis, activation of SAPK/JNK, and PARP cleavage. Taken together, our findings suggest that SAPK/JNK activation is not required for apoptosis in MM cells, and that there are at least two distinct apoptotic signaling pathways: (i) SAPK/JNK-associated, which is induced by IR and unaffected by IL-6; and (ii) SAPK/JNK-independent, which is induced by Dex, associated with downregulation of MAPK and p70S6K and inhibited by IL-6."

https://openalex.org/W2334464812,"The ability of p53 to function as a tumor suppressor is linked to its function as a transcriptional activator, since p53 mutants that do not transactivate are unable to suppress tumor cell growth. Previous studies identified an activation domain in the amino terminal 40 residues of the protein, a region that binds to several general transcription factors and to some oncogene products. For example, mdm-2, a cellular oncoprotein, binds to this region and represses p53 transactivation. Here we describe a new activation domain within the amino terminus of p53 that maps between amino acids 40 – 83, and whose residues trp-53 and phe-54 are critical for function both in yeast and in mammalian cells. In vivo studies in yeast show that the new activation subdomain, unlike the previously described, is mdm-2 independent. Both p53 activation subdomains (1 – 40 and 40 – 83) require the yeast adaptor complex ADA2/ADA3/GCN5 for transcriptional activation. Moreover, since activation by p53 requires GCN5's enzymatic histone acetyltransferase domain, p53 may regulate gene expression by influencing chromatin modification."

The RFB is polar and modularly organized, requiring both the Sal box transcription terminator and specific flanking sequences. Mutations within the terminator element, depletion of the RNA polymerase I-specific transcription termination factor TTF-I, or deletion of the termination domain of TTF-I abolishes RFB activity.

It enhances protein-protein interactions and may be necessary for the bioactivity of secreted proteins and peptides.

Tyrosine sulfation is a posttranslational modification of secretory, plasma membrane, and lysosomal proteins occurring in all multicellular organisms (1Huttner W.B. Baeuerle P.A. Satir B.

Sulfation is catalyzed using 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate as the sulfate donor by the tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase (TPST), 1The abbreviations used are: TPST, tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase; CCK, cholecystokinin; ab, antibody.1The abbreviations used are: TPST, tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase; CCK, cholecystokinin; ab, antibody. a transmembrane protein residing in the trans Golgi network (5Niehrs C.

However, in many sulfated proteins neither the exact position of the sulfated tyrosine nor the biological role is known. To facilitate sulfation site prediction, certain consensus features have been proposed that are based on sequence homologies of known sites (1Huttner W.B. Baeuerle P.A. Satir B. Modern Cell Biology.

Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The resulting consensus emphasizes the presence of acidic residues on the amino-terminal side of the tyrosine and suggests that turn-inducing residues may contribute to sulfation (1Huttner W.B.

In contrast, basic residues are thought to be excluded from the region because they rarely occur adjacent to known sulfation sites. Nevertheless, in several proteins the sites of sulfation deviate from the general consensus. Among these are members of the gastrin/CCK peptide hormone family. Gastrin, an important regulator of gastric acid secretion and growth of the gastrointestinal mucosa (for review, see Ref. 18Walsh J.H. Johnson L.R. Christensen J. Jackson M.J. Jacobson E.D. Walsh J.H. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. Raven Press, New York1987: 181-253Google Scholar), is synthesized mainly in G-cells of the antral mucosa. Progastrin matures to gastrin-17 and gastrin-34, the predominant bioactive forms, which are carboxy-amidated and partially tyrosine sulfated (Fig. 1). Receptor binding of gastrin and its homologue, CCK, requires carboxy-amidation, but contrary to CCK, sulfation of gastrin is not necessary for binding to the gastrin (CCK-B) receptor. Sulfation has, however, been shown to affect both intracellular processing of progastrin (19Bundgaard J.R. Vuust J. Rehfeld J.F.

Mammalian gastrins display a complex expression pattern with tissue-specific proteolytic processing and sulfation. However, since plasma gastrin originates mainly from antral G-cells where sulfation is incomplete, circulating gastrin is only partially sulfated (20Pauwels S. Dockray G.J. Walker R.

The incomplete sulfation has been ascribed to the lack of an acidic residue in position −1, which contains an alanine. Five glutamic acid residues amino-terminally hereof, however, are thought to direct sulfation (see Table I for sulfation site structure). In support of this hypothesis, we have shown that substitution of alanine in position −1 with aspartate completes sulfation (19Bundgaard J.R. Vuust J. Rehfeld J.F.

We have used site-directed mutagenesis of the human gastrin gene followed by transient expression in an endocrine cell line known to sulfate gastrin-17 and gastrin-34 partially after transfection (27Bundgaard J.R. Cowland J.B. Vuust J. Rehfeld J.F. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The results show that the neighboring residues contribute only moderately to sulfation and that a high degree of sulfation is obtained despite dramatic changes in the charge distribution of the neighboring residues. One critical position appears to be −1, which should be a neutral or acidic residue. Surprisingly, we found that not only are basic residues allowed around sulfation sites, but they even enhance sulfation. Hence, our data suggest that secondary structures may play an important role as determinants of tyrosine sulfation. The hamster insulinoma cell line HIT (28Santerre R.F. Cook R.A.

Site-directed mutagenesis was performed in a PCR with primers carrying the mutations using the Pwo polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) and cloned directly into this expression vector except for the KAY-gastrin mutant which was constructed using the method of Kunkel (31Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4881) Google Scholar), both methods as described previously (27Bundgaard J.R. Cowland J.B. Vuust J. Rehfeld J.F.

Cells were counted and stored at −20 °C as pellets. Pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of boiling water and boiled for 30 min. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and extracts were stored at −20 °C. Anion-exchange chromatography was performed using a MonoQ column in a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Pharmacia). Buffer A was Tris-HCl, pH 8.2 (Sigma), with 10% acetonitrile (Rathburn Chemicals Ltd.). Buffer B was equivalent to buffer A with 1 m NaCl (Sigma). Peptides were eluted at a flow of 1 ml/min for 60 min in a linear gradient of NaCl, the gradient depending on the number of negative charges in the expressed construct. The gradients used were from 0–50% buffer B up to 10–70% buffer B. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and, after dilution, analyzed directly in radioimmunoassays. Radioimmunoassays were performed using a library of monospecific antibodies, most specific for gastrin but some cross-reacting with the related peptide, CCK. However, endogenous CCK expression in HIT cells is much lower than gastrin expression after transfection and result in negligible background (27Bundgaard J.R. Cowland J.B. Vuust J. Rehfeld J.F. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Ab.2609 recognizes both sulfated and nonsulfated carboxy-amidated gastrin (32Rehfeld J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4016-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas ab.2605 is specific for the nonsulfated, amidated forms (24Andersen B.N. De Magistris L. Rehfeld J.F. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1983; 127: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Similarly, ab.7270 recognizes both sulfated and nonsulfated glycine-extended gastrin in contrast to ab.5284, which is specific for the corresponding nonsulfated forms (33Hilsted L. Rehfeld J.F. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 152: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Ab.8017 and ab.2145 are specific for the amino terminus of human gastrin-17 and gastrin-34, respectively, regardless of carboxyl-terminal processing (34Bardram L. Rehfeld J.F. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1989; 49: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 35van Solinge W.W. Rehfeld J.F. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1990; 192: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The radioimmunoassays were performed as described in the references. Data from radioimmunoassays of the chromatograms were plotted using GraphPad Prism 2.0 software (GraphPad Software Inc.). The sulfation ratios was calculated from area determination under the curve generated by the program. Differences in cross-reactivity of the various antibodies with different gastrin forms were taken into account during calculations. Hence, ab.2609 cross-reacts 131% with sulfated gastrin-17 but only 63% with gastrin-34. Likewise, ab.7270 cross-reacts 133% with sulfated gastrin-17-Gly and 78% with gastrin-34-Gly (data not shown). To determine the requirements for tyrosine sulfation of progastrin, a number of mutations were introduced around the sulfation site (Table I). Wild type gastrin and the mutants were then expressed transiently in the β-cell line, HIT. The expression levels of the individual constructs varied <50% compared with wild type gastrin. In each transfection series control transfection with wild type gastrin displayed identical processing patterns. Thus, the expression system is reliable in terms of both expression and peptide processing. The effect on tyrosine sulfation of peptides arising from the mutant constructs was determined by anion-exchange chromatography of cell extracts followed by quantitation using sequence-specific radioimmunoassays. Previous analysis has shown identical sulfation ratios of gastrin peptides in cell extracts and culture media of transfected HIT cells, at least under steady state conditions (data not shown); therefore, only cell extracts were analyzed. Fig. 2shows a representative chromatogram from transfected cells expressing the KAY-gastrin mutant analyzed with antisera specific for amidated or glycine-extended gastrins. Acidic residues constitute the most important consensus feature of tyrosine sulfation, and in human gastrin a stretch of 5 glutamates are present in positions −2 to −6. To determine the individual contributions to sulfation of these residues, we sequentially replaced each glutamate with alanine (Fig. 3 and Table I). Surprisingly, we found that substitution of glutamate in position −2 increased sulfation from 72% to 91%, whereas a moderate decrease in sulfation to 61% was observed by substitution of position −3. In contrast, substitutions of positions −4, −5, or −6 gave no effect. Moreover, when three of the glutamates are removed by a 9-base pair deletion or substituted with uncharged residues (ΔE-gastrin and IGEG-gastrin, respectively), gastrin is still at least 50% sulfated. Because the various forms of these two mutants were not completely separated by ion-exchange chromatography, their sulfation ratios can only be estimated from analysis using several different radioimmunoassays. To examine whether acidic residues are required at all, we substituted all 5 glutamates with alanines. However, the expression level of this construct was extremely low compared with normal expression levels, indicating that the highly charged region of the peptide is necessary for correct expression. Taken together our data imply a less strict requirement of acidic residues than suggested by the previous accepted sulfation consensus. Moreover, the data indicate that charged or hydrophilic residues within the gastrin-17 fragment are necessary for expression of progastrin. The effect of an acidic residue on the carboxyl-terminal side of the tyrosine was examined by substitution of the glycine in position +1 with a glutamate (YE-gastrin). This substitution decreases sulfation to 60%, a decrease possibly inflicted by the removal of a turn-inducing residue. Turn-inducing residues have been proposed to affect tyrosine sulfation, and in progastrin the only turn-inducing residue, a glycine, is found in the +1 position. Substituting this residue with a glutamate (YE-gastrin) results in a minor decrease in sulfation, but it also alters the elution profile on an anion-exchange column (27Bundgaard J.R. Cowland J.B. Vuust J. Rehfeld J.F. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The difference could be due to changes in secondary structures masking the additional negative charge. To examine this possibility, we substituted the glycine with an alanine (YA-gastrin). This substitution increased sulfation from 72 to 90% (see Fig. 4 A) and resulted in an elution profile similar to that of wild type gastrin in both anion-exchange chromatography and gel chromatography (data not shown). Thus, neither the glycyl residue nor an acidic residue in position +1 enhance sulfation. Basic residues are generally thought to be excluded around sulfation sites. We have analyzed the effect of basic residues in the proximal amino-terminal region of the sulfation site. We have previously shown that substituting the alanine in the −1 position of wild type gastrin with an aspartate leads to complete sulfation (19Bundgaard J.R. Vuust J. Rehfeld J.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3073-3079Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). When alanine is substituted with an arginine, sulfation is completely abolished, see Fig. 4 B. However, when the proximal glutamate in position −2 is substituted with a lysine (KAY-gastrin), sulfation increases to 87%, similar to that of the substitution of an alanine (AAY-gastrin) (Fig. 4 C). Hence, both a neutral and a basic residue in position −2 is preferable to an acidic residue. Gastrin has been isolated from a number of vertebrate species that display individual sulfation patterns (36Andersen B.N. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 1985; 58: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For instance, neither turtle nor horse antral G-cells sulfate gastrin. Although turtle gastrin is structurally different from human gastrin (37Johnsen A.H. Rehfeld J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 419-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), horse gastrin is similar 2A. H. Johnsen, A. Sandin, I. J. Rourke, J. R. Bundgaard, G. Nilsson, and J. F. Rehfeld, submitted for publication. (Table I). However, turtle gastrin has two histidines in positions −2 and −4 which could account for the lack of sulfation. When a similar structure was introduced into human gastrin (HDHDY-gastrin), the resulting peptide was found to be completely sulfated (Fig. 4 D). Even when aspartate in position −1 was changed to an alanine (HDHAY-gastrin), sulfation was more complete than in wild type gastrin. This again suggests that basic residues residing elsewhere than position −1 do not inhibit sulfation. When a structure is introduced that is identical with that of horse gastrin-17, peptides expressed in HIT cells are 88% sulfated, i.e. to an even higher level than wild type gastrin. Thus, it appears that peptide structures resembling human gastrin that are not sulfated on eutopic expression are substrates for TPST when they are expressed in HIT cells. Gastrin is an excellent model system for studies of tyrosine sulfation for several reasons. First, sulfation of the peptide varies in a tissue specific manner, and since gastrin is partially sulfated it should be possible to identify both positive and negative factors influencing sulfation. Second, libraries of monospecific antibodies against various molecular forms and sequences of gastrin, including sulfation-specific antisera, are available. Third, we have established a transient expression system for mutational studies of progastrin biosynthesis that facilitates expression of a large number of mutants. Using this system, we have introduced mutations in the residues neighboring the sulfated tyrosine and examined the effect on sulfation. We find that tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase has a considerably broader substrate specificity than determined by previous studies using synthetic peptides or structural homologies between known sulfation sites (1Huttner W.B. Baeuerle P.A. Satir B. Modern Cell Biology. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1988: 97-140Google Scholar, 12Hortin G.L. Folz R. Gordon J.I. Strauss A.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 141: 326-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 17Niehrs C. Beisswanger R. Huttner W.B. Chem.-Biol. Interact. 1994; 92: 257-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In contrast to most known TPST substrates, progastrin lacks an acidic residue in the amino-terminal position (−1) of the tyrosine. Wild type gastrin is ∼72% sulfated when expressed in HIT cells, and we have previously shown that substitution of the neutral residue in position −1 with an aspartate led to complete sulfation (19Bundgaard J.R. Vuust J. Rehfeld J.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3073-3079Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, in agreement with the sulfation consensus, an acidic residue in this position is important. To compensate for the neutral residue in position −1, 5 acidic residues present on the amino-terminal side hereof are thought to determine the partial sulfation pattern of the peptide. We have substituted these residues sequentially with alanines and examined the effect on sulfation. Surprisingly, we find that an alanine in position −2 of the tyrosine enhances sulfation, whereas alanine in position −3 decreases sulfation. No effect was observed by substitutions of positions −4 to −6. These findings are surprising in relation to the previously published consensus sequence for sulfation. In comparison, Niehrs et al. (14Niehrs C. Kraft M. Lee R.W.H. Huttner W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8525-8532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that adjacent acidic residues are more important than distal ones, which agrees with our findings that the adjacent positions are the most important. However, Lin et al. (15Lin W. Larsen K. Hortin G.L. Roth J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2876-2879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that acidic residues in the −5 to +5 region contribute quantitatively and independently to the overall affinity between peptide and TPST in a position-dependent manner. Combined with our study, this would imply that positions −1 and possibly −3 are the only positions where acidic residues enhance sulfation, but that they are not required to obtain a partial sulfation. To examined whether acidic residues are required for sulfation at all, we substituted all 5 glutamates in position −2 to −6 with alanines, but expression resulted in very low levels of expression, indicating that the acidic stretch is necessary for expression of progastrin. We then addressed the effect of a basic residue in position −1 by substituting alanine with arginine. The mutant was not sulfated at all, demonstrating that a basic residue in position −1 prevents sulfation. This is in conflict with a previous report that leuenkephalin in the brain is sulfated on a tyrosine preceded by a dibasic motif (38Unsworth C.D. Hughes J. Morley J.S. Nature. 1982; 295: 519-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, the existence of sulfated enkephalin has not been confirmed and might be an artifact. In contrast to previous assumptions, we have found that basic residues in positions other than −1 do not reduce sulfation. On the contrary, they may even enhance sulfation. Thus, a basic residue in position −2 grossly enhances sulfation, and substitutions of both acidic residues in positions −2 and −4 with histidines (HDHAY-gastrin) also increases sulfation. Turn-inducing residues are frequently found in tyrosine sulfation sites and have been suggested to affect sulfation (1Huttner W.B. Baeuerle P.A. Satir B. Modern Cell Biology. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1988: 97-140Google Scholar). However, little influence was found on sulfation of synthetic peptides (14Niehrs C. Kraft M. Lee R.W.H. Huttner W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8525-8532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and we did not see any correlation between sulfation and the only turn-inducing residue in the sulfation site of progastrin, i.e. the glycine in position +1. In contrast, sulfation increased when glycine was substituted with an alanine. Hence, turn-inducing residues may be necessary only for sulfation of proteins, in which their absence otherwise would impose secondary structures that inhibit sulfation. On the basis of this work we can then ask: What is the true determinant of tyrosine sulfation of human progastrin and is it possible to predict the occurrence? Possibly sulfation is directed by a combination of charge distribution around the sulfation site (especially in position −1) and the accessibility of the site to the TPST, the latter criteria being the most important. Human growth hormone contains the structural motif (-Gln-Glu-Phe-Glu-Glu-Ala-Tyr-Ile-Pro-) which judged from the present data includes a putative sulfation site. However, there have been no reports of tyrosine sulfation of growth hormone. In contrast to human gastrin, the crystal structure of growth hormone is known (39Abdel-Meguid S.S. Shieh H.-S. Smith W.W. Dayringer H.E. Violand B.N. Bentle L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6434-6437Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) and shows that the potential sulfation site is surface exposed and situated immediately after an α-helix (ending on Glu-Glu-). Thus, the presence of the α-helix may mask the sulfation site, indicating that secondary structures may act as determinants of sulfation sites. This would also explain the frequent presence of turn-inducing residues in sulfation sites. Thus, information of linear sequences should be combined with structural data for exact prediction of sulfation. Another sulfated protein that deviates from the sulfation consensus is the neuropeptide precursor procionin. Cionin is related to gastrin and shares the bioactive carboxyl-terminal pentapeptide sequence but is otherwise structurally distinct from gastrin (40Johnsen A.H. Rehfeld J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3054-3058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Monstein H.-J. Thorup J.U. Folkesson R. Johnsen A.H. Rehfeld J.F. FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 60-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In cionin, the most proximal acidic residue to the two neighboring tyrosines comprising the sulfation site, is located in position −3 and there is a basic and a neutral residue located in the −2 and −1 positions, respectively (Table I). When cionin is expressed in HIT cells, the peptide is doubly sulfated, whereas substitution of either of the tyrosines with phenylalanine results in partial sulfation, 3J. U. Thorup, J. R. Bundgaard, and J. F. Rehfeld, manuscript in preparation. as observed with gastrin in our study. Hence, our data on requirements of sulfation can substantiate predictions of the sulfation pattern observed in procionin. Tyrosine sulfation is a widespread modification and is believed to occur in all animal tissues and in many cell lines (reviewed in Refs. 1Huttner W.B. Baeuerle P.A. Satir B. Modern Cell Biology. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1988: 97-140Google Scholarand 17Niehrs C. Beisswanger R. Huttner W.B. Chem.-Biol. Interact. 1994; 92: 257-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Our transfection studies indicate that relatively profound changes in charge distribution and structure around the sulfation site do not affect sulfation dramatically. Nevertheless, eutopically expressed gastrin is completely nonsulfated in pituitary corticotrophs (42Rehfeld J.F. Nature. 1978; 271: 771-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 43Rehfeld J.F. Larsson L.-I. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10426-10429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in ileal mucosa cells (44Friis-Hansen L. Rehfeld J.F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Moreover, antral gastrin is not sulfated either in the horse2 or in the structurally more remote turtle gastrin (37Johnsen A.H. Rehfeld J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 419-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), although both proteins are readily sulfated in HIT cells. Considering the broad substrate specificity of TPST, we have described here in HIT cells, it seems unlikely that structural differences are the reason for the lack of sulfation. It appears most likely that certain cell types do not sulfate potential substrates although all tissues examined display TPST activity. It has been proposed that more than one TPST may exist, and it is possible that HIT cells express several forms with different substrate specificities. Our data strongly suggest that TPST or its isoforms are expressed in a cell-specific manner. In conclusion, we have shown that TPST activity in HIT cells has a broad substrate specificity and that basal sulfation levels may be determined by a combination of linear amino acid sequences and secondary structures. Considering the overlapping substrate specificity between TPST and tyrosine kinases (14Niehrs C. Kraft M. Lee R.W.H. Huttner W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8525-8532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the fact that the tyrosine sulfation site in gastrin can be phosphorylated in vitro(45Baldwin G.S. Knesel J. Monckton J.M. Nature. 1983; 301: 435-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), it would be interesting to investigate whether the same recognition pattern is valid for certain tyrosine kinases. Finally, experimental data suggest that certain cell types are incapable of sulfating gastrin forms that are sulfation targets in HIT cells, indicating a cell-specific expression pattern of TPST activity.

https://openalex.org/W1972146864,"A catalytically active fragment of the Rap-specific guanine-nucleotide exchange factor C3G was expressed in E coli. It was purified and its interaction with GTP-binding proteins was investigated using fluorescence spectroscopy. C3G stimulates GDP dissociation from Rap1, but not from Rap2, neither from Bud1, which is believed to be the yeast homologue of Rap1 nor from all other proteins of the human Ras-subfamily. Like the corresponding fragment from CDC25Mm, the increase in the GDP dissociation rate is linear with increasing concentration of Rap1A • GDP up to 100 μM, indicating an apparent KM higher than 100 μM. Unlike the Ras-CDC25Mm system, the Rap1A(S17N) mutant does not inhibit the C3G-activated guanine nucleotide dissociation from wild-type Rap1A in vitro. These data suggest that Rap1A(S17N) is unlikely to titrate away C3G in vivo, the proposed mechanism by which S17N-mutants exert their dominant negative effects."
https://openalex.org/W2021194016,"Gastric acid secretion is mediated by the H/K-ATPase of parietal cells. Activation of acid secretion involves insertion of H/K-ATPase into the parietal cell plasmalemma, while its cessation is associated with reinternalization of the H/K-ATPase into an intracellular storage compartment. The cytoplasmic tail of the H/K-ATPase β subunit includes a four residue sequence homologous to tyrosine-based endocytosis signals. We generated transgenic mice expressing H/K- ATPase β subunit in which this motif's tyrosine residue is mutated to alanine. Gastric glands from animals expressing mutant β subunit constitutively secrete acid and continuously express H/K-ATPase at their cell surfaces. Thus, the β subunit's tyrosine-based signal is required for the internalization of H/K-ATPase and for the termination of acid secretion. As a consequence of chronic hyperacidity, the mice develop gastric ulcers and a hypertrophic gastropathy resembling Menetrier's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2021166572,"A panel of antibodies to the αIIbβ3 integrin was used to promote adhesion of Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with the αIIbβ3 fibrinogen receptor. While some αIIbβ3 antibodies were not able to induce p125 focal adhesion kinase (p125FAK) tyrosine phosphorylation, all the antibodies equally support cell adhesion but not spreading and assembly of actin stress fibers. Absence of stress fibers was also obtained by plating on antibodies directed to the hamster β1 integrin. In contrast, cells plated on matrix proteins spread organizing actin stress fibers.

These data show that: 1) matrix proteins and antibodies differ in their ability to induce integrin-dependent actin cytoskeleton organization (while matrix induced stress fibers formation, antibodies did not); 2) p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation is insufficient per se to trigger actin stress fibers formation since antibodies that activate p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation did not lead to actin stress fibers assembly; and 3) the inability of anti-integrin antibodies to trigger stress fibers organization is overcome by concomitant activation of the protein kinase C (PKC) and Rho pathways; PKC activation leads to cell spreading and Rho activation is required to organize actin stress fibers.

Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 12: 463-519Crossref Scopus (1646) Google Scholar). The relevance of tyrosine phosphorylation to the assembly of focal adhesion and actin stress fibers has been determined by using phosphotyrosine kinase inhibitors. Herbimycin A and genistein, two known inhibitors of kinase activity, prevent focal adhesion formation and actin stress fibers assembly in cells plated on fibronectin (10Burridge C.A. Turner C. Romer L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar, 12Defilippi P. Bozzo C. Volpe G. Romano G. Venturino M. Silengo M. Tarone G. Cell Adhesion & Commun. 1994; 2: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Moreover treatment of cells with phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitors leads to increased integrin-dependent organization of focal adhesion and actin stress fibers (16Defilippi P. Retta F.S. Olivo C. Palmieri M. Venturino M. Silengo L. Tarone G. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In addition to tyrosine kinases, small GTPases have been involved in the assembly of the actin cytoskeleton in response to neuropeptides and growth factors (17Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 31-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). In the Rho-dependent pathway, the tyrosine kinases inhibitor genistein blocks the assembly of stress fibers, suggesting a role for tyrosine kinases downstream to Rho (18Ridley A.J. Hall A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2600-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Several tyrosine kinases located in the focal adhesions, including Src and p125FAK, are potential candidates (7Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar, 15Burridge C.A. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 12: 463-519Crossref Scopus (1646) Google Scholar). The exact role of p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation in the assembly of actin stress fibers induced by the Rho pathway remains to be determined.To assess the ability of integrins to regulate cell spreading and actin cytoskeleton organization, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with the human αIIbβ3 receptor were plated on anti-human αIIbβ3 or anti-hamster α5β1 antibodies, and the roles of p125FAK kinase, protein kinase C and small GTPase Rho were analyzed. We report here that antibodies directed either to the αIIbβ3 or α5β1 trigger the organization of actin in filapodia-like structures but do not lead to actin stress fibers formation. The inability to organize stress fibers on anti-integrin antibodies is overcome by concomitant activation of PKC and Rho. Since some of the antibodies induce p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation while others are ineffective, our data also show that p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation is not sufficient for stress fibers organization.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we transfected the human αIIbβ3 integrin in CHO cells, and we used a panel of monoclonal antibodies directed either to the human αIIbβ3 or to the endogenous hamster α5β1 integrin complexes to dissect the signaling pathways involved in actin organization. We found that while most of the antibodies induce p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation, some of them were ineffective. All the antibodies, however, support adhesion and partial actin organization but not full spreading and stress fibers polymerization. In contrast, cells spread and organize stress fibers on fibrinogen. We found that the combined action of PKC activator PMA and Rho activator CNF1 is required to trigger stress fibers organization following adhesion to anti-integrin antibodies. These results allow us to draw the following conclusions. 1) Different integrin ligands trigger different actin organization; matrix proteins, such as fibrinogen, are able to induce actin stress fibers formation, while antibodies to integrins induce filopodia and lamellipodia but not stress fibers. 2) Actin organization in filopodia- and lamellipodia-like structures does not require p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation. 3) Tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK in response to integrin occupancy is not sufficient per se to lead to stress fibers organization. 4) To obtain integrin-dependent full cell spreading and actin stress fibers organization, at least two events are required, activation of PKC and Rho.In this work, we found that the phosphorylation of p125FAK kinase can be driven only by antibody binding to specific epitopes of the αIIbβ3 integrin. The antibodies described in Table I bind to distinct epitopes of the receptor, some of them (mAbs P9.1.1, P8.2.1, P4.1.1) inhibit ligand binding (24Trapani-Lombardo V.T. Hodson E. Roberts J.R. Kunicki T.J. Zimmerman T.S. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 1950-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 25Niiya K. Hodson E. Bader R. Byers-Ward V. Koziol J.A. Plow E.F. Ruggeri Z.M. Blood. 1987; 70: 472-483Crossref Google Scholar), while others (D33C, CS3) induce fibrinogen binding mimicking αIIbβ3 activation via ADP (22Gulino D. Ryckewaert J.-J. Andrieux A. Rabiet M.-J. Marguerie G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9575-9581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability to trigger p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation does not depend on the ability of the antibodies to block ligand binding. On the other hand, two of the antibodies that were ineffective at inducing p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation, D33C and CS3, are activating antibodies (22Gulino D. Ryckewaert J.-J. Andrieux A. Rabiet M.-J. Marguerie G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9575-9581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inability of these mAbs to trigger p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation was observed both in clustering in suspension and in adhesion to antibodies-coated dishes. Similar data were reported by Pelletieret al. (39Pelletier A.J. Kunicki T. Ruggeri Z.M. Quaranta V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18133-18140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Shattil and co-workers showed that an antibody with properties comparable with D33C and CS3 induces p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation in platelets only in the presence of a second stimulus (40Shattil S.J. Haimovich B. Cunningham M. Lipfert L. Parsons J.T. Ginsberg M.H. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14738-14745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is similar to our data showing that PMA and CNF1 are necessary to obtain p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation in cells plated on mAb D33C. In addition, however, we show that using different antibodies, clustering of the αIIbβ3 is sufficient to trigger p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation in CHO cells expressing this receptor. Phosphorylation of the p125FAK in αIIbβ3-transfected cells has also been very recently described (41Leong L. Hughes P.E. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Shattil S.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3817-3825PubMed Google Scholar). These data and the present work indicate clearly that the αIIbβ3 integrin is able to trigger the cytoplasmic pathway leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of the p125FAK kinase in response to integrin ligand binding. The requirement of a co-stimulus in αIIbβ3-induced p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation in platelets may be due either to the properties of the specific activating antibody used or to a platelet-specific signaling mechanism.The data presented here indicate that antibodies to either α5β1 or αIIbβ3 integrins are able to support cell adhesion, but they are incapable of triggering stress fibers formation. This experimental system allows us to test biological pathways implicated in integrin-mediated cells adhesion and cytoskeletal organization. Cells plated on the different antibodies were poorly spread, and F-actin was organized in small patches and in peripheral thin filopodia-like structures. Similar structures have been previously described in the early phases of cell adhesion, as a peculiar actin organization during focal adhesion formation, in a step which precedees accumulation of cytoskeletal elements (42Rinnerthaller G. Geiger B. Small J.V. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 747-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 43DePasquale J.A. Izzard C.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1351-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Assembly of short bundles of actin filaments to produce microspikes and filopodia have also been previously demonstrated in motile cells and at the end of neuron growth cones (44O'Connor T.P. Bentley D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1581-1595Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The formation of filopodia and lamellipodia is induced by Cdc42 and Rac, belonging to the Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins (17Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 31-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 45Nobes C.A. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3696) Google Scholar). We can hypothesize that interaction with monoclonal antibodies leads to integrin-dependent activation of Cdc42 and Rac. Thus, cell adhesion to the monoclonal antibodies to integrin receptors leads to an initial level of actin organization, but it is insufficient to drive redistribution of cytoskeletal components to organize actin in stress fibers.We found that concomitant treatment with PMA and CNF1, activators of PKC and Rho respectively, is required to obtain cell spreading and actin stress fibers organization in cells plated on anti-integrin antibodies. These pathways need to be activated in cells plated on antibodies directed either to β1 or β3 integrin subunits, indicating that both β1- or β3-mediated integrin clustering requires similar intracellular pathways to trigger actin stress fibers formation.PKC and Rho appear to play different roles in controlling these processes, while PKC controls cell spreading and Rho in combination with PKC regulates organization of stress fibers. In the presence of the phorbol ester PMA, filopodia disappear, and the cells become round, well spread with large lamellipodia. Short and thin bundles of actin filaments, however, were visible, located at the periphery of the cells, and actin was mainly organized in small patches inside the cytoplasm. Since this effect was blocked by the PKC inhibitors RO 31–8220 and calphostin C, these data strongly suggest that cell spreading on integrin antibodies is regulated by PKC. PKC involvment in spreading and focal adhesion formation has been demonstrated in cells plated on matrix proteins (31Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 277-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21459-21462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Haimovich B. Kaneshiki N. Ping J. Blood. 1996; 87: 152-161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using specific inhibitors or activators, it has been shown that PKC regulates spreading of platelets on fibrinogen (46Haimovich B. Kaneshiki N. Ping J. Blood. 1996; 87: 152-161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and of fibroblasts on fibronectin (32Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21459-21462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the ability of fibroblasts to organize focal adhesions on fibronectin (31Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 277-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been recently reported that syndecan 4, a proteoglycan localized in the focal adhesions in a PKC dependent manner, can activate PKC and thus may function as a co-receptor with integrins, interacting with the heparin binding domain exposed on the fibronectin molecule (47Oh E.-S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11805-11811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar).Our results show that stress fibers formation requires additional treatment with the Rho activator CNF1. The action of CNF1 is specific for Rho since this toxin activates Rho by specifically deamidating glutamine at position 63 (38Flatau G. Lemichez E. Gauthier M. Chardin P. Paris S. Fiorentini C. Boquet P. Nature. 1997; 387: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Interestingly in our system, we can show that Rho, although essential, is not sufficient to drive actin stress fibers formation. In fact, cells treated with CNF1 remained round and did not organize stress fibers on antibodies-coated dishes. A dose-response experiment, where cells were treated with decreasing doses of CNF1, did not allow us to find a condition in which CNF1-treated cells were able to spread on anti-integrin antibodies. Since activation of Rho has been shown to stimulate cell contractility (48Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. J. Cell. Biol. 1996; 133: 1403-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar), it is possible that in cells where Rho has been constitutively activated by CNF1, cell contractility may antagonize cell spreading. In contrast, cells plated on vitronectin respond to CNF1 by organizing thick and prominent stress fibers, further showing that matrix proteins and integrin antibodies elicit distinct intracellular signaling responses.The data reported in this work suggest that, in addition to PKC and Rho activation, tyrosine kinases are likely to be important in regulation of stress fibers formation. The results presented here support the idea that tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK per se is not sufficient to induce organization of stress fibers since cells adhering to antibodies able to trigger p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation do not organize actin stress fibers. PKC and Rho activation, however, induces tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK kinase in cells plated on antibodies that are not able per se to activate this phosphorylation event. According to these data, we and others have previously shown that protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitors blocked formation of stress fibers (10Burridge C.A. Turner C. Romer L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar, 12Defilippi P. Bozzo C. Volpe G. Romano G. Venturino M. Silengo M. Tarone G. Cell Adhesion & Commun. 1994; 2: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), thus suggesting that PTKs are required in addition to PKC and Rho to achieve organization of actin stress fibers in response to integrin ligand binding (Fig. 9). Contrasting results on the role of p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation in stress fibers and focal adhesion assembly have been presented (49Otey C.A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1996; 167: 161-183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells deriving from p125FAK knock-out mice assemble focal adhesions in the absence of p125FAK but reduce their motility (50Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Omura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. et al.Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). Gilmore and Romer (51Gilmore A.P. Romer L.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1209-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), using a dominant negative form of p125FAK, found a decreased cell motility but not interference on focal adhesion organization. These results suggest that p125FAK or its tyrosine phosphorylation, rather than playing a structural role, may be crucial in regulating turn-over of stress fibers and focal adhesions.Involvment of PKC and Rho in p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation is in agreement with findings showing that PMA can trigger p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation in cells plated on matrix proteins (32Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21459-21462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Haimovich B. Kaneshiki N. Ping J. Blood. 1996; 87: 152-161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of Rho to trigger p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation has been recently reported, following scraping of activated Rho into cells (52Flinn H.M. Ridley A.J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1133-1141PubMed Google Scholar).The data presented above indicate that p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation is not able to trigger PKC or Rho activation since antibodies capable of inducing p125FAK phosphorylation did not lead to cell spreading or actin stress fibers, processes which require PKC and Rho pathways. At the same time, PKC does not trigger Rho activation and vice versa, as shown by the fact that stimulation by PMA only leads to cell spreading but not to stress fibers organization. CNF1-mediated Rho activation is also unable to drive actin cytoskeleton organization to stress fibers. Thus p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation and PKC and Rho activation are three independent pathways, which are all required to trigger full cell spreading and actin stress fibers. In our system, anti-integrin antibodies are able to trigger only the pathway leading to p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation, while fibrinogen is likely to activate all three pathways.Our data show that organization of filopodia-like structures does not require induction of p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation by αIIbβ3. In fact, the αIIbβ3-dependent organization of filopodia-like structures occurs also with antibodies that are incapable of activating this signaling event. Moreover, the ability of the αIIbβ3 integrin to organize F-actin independently from p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation was demonstrated by clustering of the αIIbβ3 integrin on the surface of cells in suspension. In these cells, in fact, clustering with an antibody incapable of triggering p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation, leads to actin co-clustering. Thus, actin aggregation under the clusterized receptor or formation of filopodia-like structures in adhesion to antibodies-coated dishes are events independent from p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation. Whether other tyrosine kinases are involved is not known at present. Tyrosine kinase activity is required for accumulation of F-actin and other focal adhesion proteins in the clustering site (53Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Burbelo P.D. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). The data presented here indicate that p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation is not involved in this step.In conclusion, the data reported in this paper indicate that PKC and Rho are required in cell spreading and actin stress fibers assembly following integrin-dependent signaling. Although PKC involvment in spreading or focal adhesion formation on fibronectin has been previously shown (31Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 277-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21459-21462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Rho activation has been demonstrated to regulate actin stress fibers formation following mitogen stimulation in mouse fibroblasts (35Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3796) Google Scholar, 45Nobes C.A. Hall A.

The second mode of excision repair is specific for the nontranscribed strand and for genomic regions that are transcriptionally inactive. Interestingly, in the rad7 and rad16 mutants of S. cerevisiae, the nontranscribed strand is not repaired, while the repair of the transcribed strand is not affected (9Verhage R.

Thus, the repair of the nontranscribed strand has a specific dependence on the RAD7and RAD16 genes.Here we describe our biochemical studies that help elucidate the molecular function of the Rad7 and Rad16 proteins in the repair of the nontranscribed strand. We show by co-immunoprecipitation that Rad7 and Rad16 proteins exist as a stable complex in yeast cells. The Rad7-Rad16 complex, which we have named NEF4, has been purified to near homogeneity from extract of a yeast strain co-expressing the two proteins. Using a DNA mobility shift assay, we demonstrate that NEF4 binds with high specificity and avidity to UV lesions and that this damage binding reaction has a strong dependence on ATP. Importantly, the addition of NEF4 to the reconstituted NER reaction results in a marked stimulation of damage-specific incision. Taken together, our results suggest that NEF4 is an ATP-dependent DNA damage sensor that functions specifically to target the basic NER machinery (viz. NEF1, NEF2, NEF3, and RPA) to the repair of nontranscribed DNA.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe RAD7-encoded protein was overproduced in yeast by placing the RAD7 gene under the control of theGAL-PGK promoter-yielding plasmid pR7.8 (Fig. 1 A). To overproduce the Rad16 protein in yeast, the RAD16 gene was fused to the alcohol dehydrogenase I (ADC1) promoter, yielding plasmid pR16.15 (Fig. 1 A). When extract from the protease-deficient yeast strain LY2 co-harboring pR7.8 and pR16.15 was subjected to immunoprecipitation with protein A-agarose beads containing covalently conjugated anti-Rad7 and anti-Rad16 antibodies, co-precipitation of the Rad7 and Rad16 proteins was observed (Fig. 1 A, lanes 8 and9); no precipitation of either Rad7 or Rad16 protein was seen with beads containing antibodies specific for the Rad57 protein (Fig. 1 A, lane 7), which functions in recombinational repair (13Sung P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Control experiments showed that the precipitation of Rad7 by the anti-Rad16 immunobeads requires the presence of Rad16 protein and, likewise, that the precipitation of Rad16 protein by anti-Rad7 immunobeads is dependent upon Rad7 protein (Fig. 1 A). In immunoprecipitation experiments using extract from wild type yeast cells, co-precipitation of the Rad7 and Rad16 proteins was again observed. Thus, Rad7 and Rad16 proteins are complexed to each other in yeast cells.For purifying the Rad7-Rad16 protein complex, extract from LY2 co-overexpressing Rad7 and Rad16 proteins was subjected to the chromatographic fractionation scheme described under “Materials and Methods.” The Rad7 and Rad16 proteins remained quantitatively associated throughout all the purification steps, even in column fractions that contained as little as 4 × 10−10m of the protein complex, indicating a dissociation constant of the complex that is considerably lower than this protein concentration. When the Rad7-Rad16 protein complex from the last step of purification in Mono S (Fraction VI) was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and staining with Coomassie Blue, only the Rad7 and Rad16 bands were seen (Fig. 1, B andC), indicating a high degree of purity of the complex. Image analysis of the gel in Fig. 1 B revealed a one to one stoichiometry of the Rad7 and Rad16 proteins in the complex.We speculated that NEF4 might effect the repair of transcriptionally inactive DNA by sensing the DNA damage located in such regions and then recruiting the basic NER machinery to initiate the repair reaction. As a first test of this hypothesis, we examined whether NEF4 would bind UV-damaged DNA using a DNA mobility shift assay. The DNA fragment was labeled with 32P, irradiated with UV doses ranging from 1 to 12 kJ/m2, and then incubated with NEF4 in the presence of ATP and an excess of unlabeled φX174 DNA at 30 °C. After running the reaction mixtures in polyacrylamide gels under nondenaturing conditions, the gels were dried and exposed to x-ray films to reveal the radiolabeled DNA species. As shown in Fig. 2, incubation of the UV-irradiated DNA probe with NEF4 resulted in the formation of slower migrating forms of DNA, indicating binding of the damaged DNA by NEF4; no binding of NEF4 to the undamaged DNA was seen. The level of nucleoprotein complex formation was proportional to the amount of NEF4 (Fig. 2, Aand B) and to the UV dose (Fig. 2, C andD). Multiple nucleoprotein complexes were detected in these experiments, with the slower migrating nucleoprotein species being more prevalent at higher UV doses and with increasing concentrations of NEF4 (Fig. 2), suggesting that these species contained multiple NEF4 molecules bound to different damage sites in the DNA probe. Importantly, when ATP was omitted from the reaction, binding of the UV-damaged DNA decreased dramatically, such that only ∼6% of the UV-irradiated DNA was bound by NEF4 in the absence of the nucleotide, as compared with greater than 50% binding in its presence (Fig. 2 E). Although NEF4 possesses an ATPase activity that is activated by either single-stranded or double-stranded DNA, 2S. N. Guzder, unpublished observations. ATP binding by NEF4 is apparently sufficient for damage recognition, because the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue ATPγS is nearly as effective as ATP in promoting damage binding (Fig. 2 E).Figure 2ATP-dependent binding of UV-damaged DNA by Rad7-Rad16 complex.

To do this, we examined the rate of incision of supercoiled M13 DNA that had been exposed to 30 J/m2 UV light to introduce on average 1.8 photoproducts per plasmid DNA molecule (approximately 7.3 kilobase pairs long) by the basic NER machinery with or without added purified NEF4. Interestingly, addition of NEF4 to the in vitro NER reaction resulted in a marked stimulation of the conversion of the UV-irradiated supercoiled M13 plasmid DNA to the open circular form (Fig. 3, A and B), while no incision of the nondamaged M13 DNA was observed whether or not NEF4 was added to the repair reaction (Fig. 3 A). These observations indicate that NEF4 helps promote the damage-specific incision reaction. We also subjected the NER reaction to labeling with [α-32P]ddATP and calf thymus terminal transferase to detect the excision DNA fragments (3Guzder S.N. Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J.

NEF4, an ATP-dependent damage recognition factor, is essential for the repair of the nontranscribed strand, whereas the products of theCSA and CSB/RAD26 genes are essential for preferential repair of the transcribed strand. NEF4 may be pivotal in locating the damage on the nontranscribed strand and in transcriptionally inactive regions of the genome, and it may do so by a tracking mechanism that utilizes the energy of ATP hydrolysis. Subsequent to binding the DNA lesion, NEF4 may serve as the nucleation site for the assembly of the other repair components for dual incision to occur. An additional role of NEF4 in the turnover of the incision enzyme complex is also possible.

When the Rad7-Rad16 protein complex from the last step of purification in Mono S (Fraction VI) was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and staining with Coomassie Blue, only the Rad7 and Rad16 bands were seen (Fig. 1, B andC), indicating a high degree of purity of the complex. Image analysis of the gel in Fig. 1 B revealed a one to one stoichiometry of the Rad7 and Rad16 proteins in the complex.We speculated that NEF4 might effect the repair of transcriptionally inactive DNA by sensing the DNA damage located in such regions and then recruiting the basic NER machinery to initiate the repair reaction. As a first test of this hypothesis, we examined whether NEF4 would bind UV-damaged DNA using a DNA mobility shift assay. The DNA fragment was labeled with 32P, irradiated with UV doses ranging from 1 to 12 kJ/m2, and then incubated with NEF4 in the presence of ATP and an excess of unlabeled φX174 DNA at 30 °C. After running the reaction mixtures in polyacrylamide gels under nondenaturing conditions, the gels were dried and exposed to x-ray films to reveal the radiolabeled DNA species. As shown in Fig. 2, incubation of the UV-irradiated DNA probe with NEF4 resulted in the formation of slower migrating forms of DNA, indicating binding of the damaged DNA by NEF4; no binding of NEF4 to the undamaged DNA was seen. The level of nucleoprotein complex formation was proportional to the amount of NEF4 (Fig. 2, Aand B) and to the UV dose (Fig. 2, C andD). Multiple nucleoprotein complexes were detected in these experiments, with the slower migrating nucleoprotein species being more prevalent at higher UV doses and with increasing concentrations of NEF4 (Fig. 2), suggesting that these species contained multiple NEF4 molecules bound to different damage sites in the DNA probe. Importantly, when ATP was omitted from the reaction, binding of the UV-damaged DNA decreased dramatically, such that only ∼6% of the UV-irradiated DNA was bound by NEF4 in the absence of the nucleotide, as compared with greater than 50% binding in its presence (Fig. 2 E). Although NEF4 possesses an ATPase activity that is activated by either single-stranded or double-stranded DNA, 2S. N. Guzder, unpublished observations. ATP binding by NEF4 is apparently sufficient for damage recognition, because the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue ATPγS is nearly as effective as ATP in promoting damage binding (Fig. 2 E).Having established that NEF4 has high affinity for UV-damaged DNA, we then tested if NEF4 might improve the efficiency of the damage-specific incision reaction mediated by the basic NER machinery comprising NEF1, NEF2, NEF3, and RPA (2Guzder S.N.

To do this, we examined the rate of incision of supercoiled M13 DNA that had been exposed to 30 J/m2 UV light to introduce on average 1.8 photoproducts per plasmid DNA molecule (approximately 7.3 kilobase pairs long) by the basic NER machinery with or without added purified NEF4. Interestingly, addition of NEF4 to the in vitro NER reaction resulted in a marked stimulation of the conversion of the UV-irradiated supercoiled M13 plasmid DNA to the open circular form (Fig. 3, A and B), while no incision of the nondamaged M13 DNA was observed whether or not NEF4 was added to the repair reaction (Fig. 3 A). These observations indicate that NEF4 helps promote the damage-specific incision reaction. We also subjected the NER reaction to labeling with [α-32P]ddATP and calf thymus terminal transferase to detect the excision DNA fragments (3Guzder S.N. Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J.

In agreement with the results from the agarose gel method, the amount of excision fragments generated was also higher when NEF4 was included in the repair reaction (data not shown).Figure 3NEF4 promotes incision of UV-damaged DNA. A, M13mp18 DNA not treated (−UV) or treated with 30 J/m2 of UV (+UV) was incubated with NEF1, NEF2, and NEF3 (NEF1,2,3), with or without NEF4 at 30 °C for different times; RPA was added to all the repair reactions except the no protein controls in lanes 1 and 4. Reaction mixtures were run in a 0.8% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide to visualize the supercoiled (SC) and open circular DNA (OC), which was generated as a result of the damage-specific incision of the supercoiled form by the NER factors.B, graphical representation of the results in A.

NEF4, an ATP-dependent damage recognition factor, is essential for the repair of the nontranscribed strand, whereas the products of theCSA and CSB/RAD26 genes are essential for preferential repair of the transcribed strand. NEF4 may be pivotal in locating the damage on the nontranscribed strand and in transcriptionally inactive regions of the genome, and it may do so by a tracking mechanism that utilizes the energy of ATP hydrolysis. Subsequent to binding the DNA lesion, NEF4 may serve as the nucleation site for the assembly of the other repair components for dual incision to occur. An additional role of NEF4 in the turnover of the incision enzyme complex is also possible. The RAD7-encoded protein was overproduced in yeast by placing the RAD7 gene under the control of theGAL-PGK promoter-yielding plasmid pR7.8 (Fig. 1 A). To overproduce the Rad16 protein in yeast, the RAD16 gene was fused to the alcohol dehydrogenase I (ADC1) promoter, yielding plasmid pR16.15 (Fig. 1 A). When extract from the protease-deficient yeast strain LY2 co-harboring pR7.8 and pR16.15 was subjected to immunoprecipitation with protein A-agarose beads containing covalently conjugated anti-Rad7 and anti-Rad16 antibodies, co-precipitation of the Rad7 and Rad16 proteins was observed (Fig. 1 A, lanes 8 and9); no precipitation of either Rad7 or Rad16 protein was seen with beads containing antibodies specific for the Rad57 protein (Fig. 1 A, lane 7), which functions in recombinational repair (13Sung P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Control experiments showed that the precipitation of Rad7 by the anti-Rad16 immunobeads requires the presence of Rad16 protein and, likewise, that the precipitation of Rad16 protein by anti-Rad7 immunobeads is dependent upon Rad7 protein (Fig. 1 A). In immunoprecipitation experiments using extract from wild type yeast cells, co-precipitation of the Rad7 and Rad16 proteins was again observed.

https://openalex.org/W2323892674,"Neogenin is a member of the N-CAM family of cell adhesion molecules and is closely related to the DCC tumor suppressor gene product. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the DCC/Neogenin subfamily plays a key role in axonal guidance within the embryonic nervous system, however little is known about the function of DCC or Neogenin in non-neuronal tissues in vertebrates. To gain an understanding of Neogenin function outside of the nervous system we have cloned and sequenced the mouse homologue of Neogenin. We describe three alternatively spliced exons within the extracellular domain of Neogenin and a fourth alternatively spliced exon within the cytoplasmic domain. We further demonstrate that three of these alternatively spliced exons are developmentally regulated. Analysis of Neogenin mRNA expression showed that two distinct Neogenin transcripts are expressed at significant levels in a broad spectrum of adult mouse tissues and throughout the mid to late stages of embryogenesis. In situ hybridization studies on day 15.5 mouse embryos revealed that Neogenin is expressed widely throughout the developing mouse embryo, in both neuronal and non-neuronal tissues. These observations suggests that Neogenin may play an integral role in regulating differentiation programmes and/or cell migration events within many embryonic and adult tissues."

Multiprotein redox enzyme systems such as methane monooxygenase, cytochrome P450s, and diooxygenases of similar molecular architecture are being investigated as biocatalysts for conversion of organic substrates with no functional groups into oxygen-bearing compounds with high regio- or stereo-selectivity. Maximizing the catalytic efficiency of such systems requires knowledge of the pathways of electron transfer and of the surface regions and amino acid residues involved in the interaction of the redox partner subunits. Cytochrome P450cam (CYP101) has been intensively investigated for over 20 years as a model P450 system (1Mueller E.J. Loida P.J. Sligar S.G. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450 Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. Plenum Press, New York1995: 83-124Crossref Google Scholar). This soluble P450 (from Pseudomonas putida) consists of three subunits: putidaredoxin reductase (PdR, 1The abbreviations used are: PdR, putidaredoxin reductase; camphor, (1R)-camphor; 5-exo-hydroxycamphor, (1R)-5-exo-hydroxycamphor; Pdx, putidaredoxin; WT, wild type.

Electron transfer in this system proceeds from NADH via the flavin group of PdR to the 2Fe-2S center of Pdx and then to the heme iron of CYP101 which accepts one electron at a time from Pdx. Because the details of the electron transfer pathway from one subunit to the next are missing, it is not known exactly how the subunits bind for the transfer of electrons. Ionic strength is well known to have an effect on binding and electron transfer suggesting that salt bridges are important in these interactions (12Hintz M.J. Peterson J.A. J. Biol.

Residues involved in the PdR-Pdx interaction are not necessarily the same as those in the Pdx·CYP101 complex. Site-directed mutagenesis of amino acid residues on adrenodoxin, a mitochondrial analog to the camphor hydroxylase, has implicated overlapping but not identical sites for binding of adrenodoxin to its redox partners in the P450ssc system (19Coghlan V.M.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) developed a functional biocatalyst from a multienzyme system by preparing fusion proteins of the CYP101 system. They linked the three genes in two different sequence orders (PdR-CYP101-Pd and PdR-Pdx-CYP101). Their results showed that the system was not optimal with respect to the rate of product formation. They noted that details of subunit interaction were still obscure. Information on surface interaction sites will lead to further optimization of such self-sufficient systems. In this study we have used site-directed mutagenesis to alter surface residues of Pdx and tested the effect of these mutations in the reconstituted complete CYP101 system as well as on interactions of Pdx with specific redox partners. The purpose is to identify residues that are important for binding and electron transfer and to probe the degree of overlap of the binding sites of PdR-Pdx and Pdx-CYP101. The three protein subunits of the P450cam system were obtained by heterologous expression of the genes in separateEscherichia coli (DH5α) clones. The clones were kindly provided by Dr. J. A. Peterson (University of Texas Southwest Medical Center, Dallas, TX). The gene for Pdx along with some 5′- and 3′-flanking DNA was cloned between a HindIII andSmaI site in the polycloning region of pIBI25 (5Peterson J.A. Lorence M.C. Amarneh B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6066-6073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutants of the Pdx gene were obtained by a site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Transformer™, CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). 2Certain commercial instruments, reagents, or materials are identified in this paper to specify adequately the experimental procedures. Such identification does not imply recommendation by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, nor does it imply that the materials are necessarily the best available for the purpose. Mutations in the Pdx gene were identified by sequencing both strands of the gene. Sequencing reactions were performed using dye-linked deoxy terminator chemistry (Prism™ Dye-Deoxy Terminator kit, Perkin-Elmer) in a thermocycler (Perkin-Elmer model 9600). The products of the reaction were separated by electrophoresis and analyzed using a DNA sequencer (ABI model 373A DNA Sequencer, Perkin-Elmer). Individual clones, expressing PdR, CYP101, plus wild type and mutant Pdx, were grown in batch culture on undefined rich medium. Protein was released into the supernatant by lysis of the harvested cells, purified in two to three chromatographic steps, and the purity of every batch was monitored spectrophotometrically. The purity of some mutants were confirmed with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The details of the above procedures have been recently described (24Grayson D.A. Tewari Y.B. Mayhew M.P. Vilker V.L. Goldberg R.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 332: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Purified protein subunits were stored at −80 °C. Protein preparations were concentrated using centrifugal membrane concentrators (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), and the buffer was exchanged using a Sephadex G-10 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) column prior to analysis. Mass spectra were recorded on a Finnigan MAT (San Jose, CA) TSQ-70 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer upgraded with a TSQ-700 operating system and equipped with an Analytica (Branford, CT) electrospray source. In the positive ion mode, mass spectra were obtained by scanning the first quadrupole from 1000 to 2000m/z in 2 s at a sampling rate of five data points per mass unit. The charge state ion distribution observed in the electrospray mass spectra were deconvoluted using Finnigan's BIOMASS software. Samples were introduced into the electrospray source by capillary reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography using a 0.32- × 1200-mm column packed with Vydac C8, 30-nm pore size (The Separations Group, Hesperia, CA). The capillary column was slurry-packed with the aid of a stainless steel pressure vessel (25Moseley M.A. Deterding L.J. Tomer K.B. Jorgenson J.W. Anal. Chem. 1991; 63: 1467-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) pressurized to 8300 kilopascal with helium. An Ultra-Plus binary gradient micro-LC pump (Microtech Scientific, Sunnyvale, CA) was used to produce the solvent gradients needed for the capillary reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The pump was operated at 40 μl/min, but the column flow rate of 1–2 μl/min was obtained by pre-injector splitting. A Rheodyne (Cotati, CA) model 7520 injector with a 1-μl rotor was used. Prior to LCMS analysis, desalted Pdx samples were diluted to approximately 0.2 g/liter with water. The complete camphor monooxygenase reaction was conducted with all three subunits. The reaction contained Pdx (5 μmol/liter), PdR (0.5 μmol/liter), CYP101 (0.5 μmol/liter), NADH (330 μmol/liter), camphor (550 μmol/liter), KCl (100 mmol/liter) in potassium phosphate buffer (20 mmol/liter), pH 7.4. All components were prepared as stock solutions in the phosphate/KCl buffer. The reaction was started with the addition of NADH. The oxidation of NADH was monitored at 340 nm, and the oxidation of NADH was based on a molar absorptivity of 6.22 (mmol/liter)−1 cm −1. Kinetic studies were done with the complete system keeping the Pdx concentration constant at 5 μmol/liter. The concentration of the redox partner under investigation was varied, and the other partner was present at 0.5 μmol/liter. The kinetic data was analyzed using nonlinear regression analysis (Sigmaplot, Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). Two partial reaction assays, 1) the reduction of Pdx by PdR and 2) the oxidation of reduced Pdx by CYP101, were also performed. These were based on the absorbance difference between oxidized and reduced Pdx at 455 nm (molar absorptivity at 455 nm of reduced Pdx, ε = 2.6 mmol/liter−1 cm−1; and of oxidized Pdx, ε = 10.4 mmol/liter−1 cm−1). A large amount of Pdx was combined with a catalytic amount of PdR or CYP101. This allowed the reaction to proceed at a linear rate measurable over 0.2 min to 0.6 min. Because of the sensitivity of the reaction to small differences in the quantities of redox partners (PdR or CYP101), the results with mutant Pdx proteins were always compared with assays done with the WT Pdx performed on the same day and with the same preparations of other reaction components. The reaction mixture for Pdx reduction consisted of Pdx (100 μmol/liter), NADH (100 μmol/liter), and PdR (10 nmol/liter) in the phosphate/KCl buffer. The reaction was started with the addition of NADH. Absorbance changes were monitored at 455 nm. In the assay monitoring Pdx oxidation, it was necessary to reduce Pdx prior to adding CYP101 and camphor. This was accomplished by using the same reaction mixture that was used for the Pdx reduction assay, raising the concentration of PdR to 20 nmol/liter. After an initial decrease in absorbance of Pdx was observed, resulting from the reduction of Pdx, a steady state absorbance reading was maintained for 1 to 2 min until NADH had been depleted. Then reoxidation of Pdx was observed by linear rate of increase in Pdx absorbance. The rate of nonenzymatic reoxidation remained linear over 0.5 to 1 min and was the same for mutants and WT Pdx, except for W106E (1.5 × WT), and for D38N (2 × WT). Once the pattern and rate of nonenzymatic reoxidation was established for WT and mutant Pdx, assays were started and observed to the point where NADH had been depleted. Then CYP101 (10 nmol/liter) and camphor (200 μmol/liter) were added, and the linear portion of the resulting PdX reoxidation was measured. All values for total reoxidation were corrected for nonenzymatic reoxidation to determine the enzymatic rate of PdX reoxidation. A ribbon model of the structure of Pdx, as proposed by Pochapskyet al. (10Pochapsky T.C. Ye X.M. Ratnaswamy G. Lyons T.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6424-6432Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and based on NMR studies, is shown in Fig. 1. The side chains of the residues mutated in this study are also indicated. The 2Fe-2S cluster, at the middle portion of the molecule as depicted, has four cysteine ligands as follows: Cys-39, Cys-45, Cys-48, and Cys-86 (26Gerber N.C. Horiuchi T. Koga H. Sligar S.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 169: 1016-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The first three lie on a loop leading from the helix on the right (amino acid residues 23–31). The fourth cysteine ligand (Cys-86) is present on another strand coming off a helix, which ends at Cys-73, on the left hand side of the molecule. This helix (residues 65–73) has several acidic residues that were shown in chemical modification studies to be involved in the binding of Pdx to the reductase (27Geren L. Tuls J. O'Brien P. Millett F. Peterson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15491-15495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We chose to mutagenize Cys-73 at the end of this helix. The loop containing three of the four cysteine ligands for the 2Fe-2S center has two acidic residues, Asp-34 and Asp-38. These would be candidates for electrostatic interaction with the series of basic residues in the vicinity of the heme group of CYP101. Recently, Pochapsky et al. (28Pochapsky T.A. Lyons T.A. Kazanis S. Arakaki T. Rasnaswamy G. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1996; 78: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) proposed that these two aspartates and the C-terminal carboxylate of Trp-106 interact with three arginines (Arg-72, Arg-109, and Arg-112) of CYP101. In our studies the acidic residues at positions 34 and 38 were replaced with the amide forms, which neutralized the charge, but did not change the overall size of the side chain. A second substitution of a nonpolar residue was done at position 38 (D38I), and cysteine was substituted for serine at position 42 which is also in the region near the Fe-S center of Pdx. Trp-106 has already been shown to have an important role in the Pdx·CYP101 complex with the most important aspect involving the aromatic nature of the amino acid (14Davies M.D. Qin L. Beck J.L. Suslick K.S. Koga H. Horiuchi T. Sligar S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 7396-7398Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar,15Davies M.D. Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11383-11389Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The mutant W106E is similar to one (W106D) previously studied by Davies and co-workers (14Davies M.D. Qin L. Beck J.L. Suslick K.S. Koga H. Horiuchi T. Sligar S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 7396-7398Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 15Davies M.D. Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11383-11389Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In addition, three residues were chosen to test the hypothesis that they lie outside the interaction surface of Pdx with its redox partners and therefore could serve as controls: the charge was neutralized on His-8 by replacement with a tyrosine; the charge was reversed on Asp-95 by replacement with a histidine; and the size of the side chain at Ala-55 was increased by replacement with a valine. Mutant Pdx species were produced by a site-directed mutagenesis protocol. The identity of all of the mutations were verified two ways: 1) both strands of the mutated gene were sequenced and 2) the molecular weight of each mutant Pdx protein species was determined by electrospray mass spectrometry (Table I). The mutated Pdx proteins were expressed in E. coli (DH5α) cells on the plasmid PIBI25 as was used for expression of the WT. The level of expression of the mutants in E. coli varied from the wild type. In most cases, the yield of protein (after purification) was somewhat lower than WT Pdx (3.6 mg of pure protein/g of cell FW). However, C73R expressed at higher levels than WT. The mutant proteins were purified by the same protocol as used for the WT, and purity was monitored spectroscopically according to Gunsalus and Wagner (29Gunsalus I.C. Wagner G.C. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 166-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Wavelength scans of the mutants were identical to the WT with the exceptions noted below. Based on the ratio of absorbances at 455 and 275 nm, the mole fraction purity of WT and mutants was greater than 0.99. The purity of two mutants, W106E and H8Y, was verified by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis because the absorbance at 275 nm was altered by the mutation, invalidating the 455/275 ratio. Although no specific study of the stability of the mutant protein species was made, there was no detectable degeneration of the mutant or WT Pdx protein over the period of hours when assays were conducted.Table IMolecular mass of native and mutant putidaredoxin species determined by electrospray mass spectrometryPutidaredoxinMr(calculated)Mr (measured)Wild type11,419.011,418 ± 2C73S11,402.911,404 ± 2C73G11,372.911,371 ± 2C73R11,472.111,471 ± 3S42C11,435.111,434 ± 4D34N11,418.011,416 ± 2D38N11,418.011,416 ± 2D38I11,417.111,414 ± 4W106E11,361.911,360 ± 2D95H11,441.111,442 ± 2H8Y11,445.011,442 ± 2A55V11,447.111,447 ± 2The calculated and observed values of Mr are for the apoprotein of the Pdx species.

Numbers for the observed values are ±95% confidence limits of the average observed Mr. The complete camphor P450 hydroxylase system was reconstituted, and the activity of the mutant Pdx species, measured as camphor-dependent NADH oxidation, was compared with that of the WT protein (Table II). All three substitutions made at Cys-73 proved to have a significant effect on activity. The substitution of serine for cysteine resulted in loss of half of the activity. The glycine and arginine mutants at Cys-73 proved even more disruptive, producing 36 and 5% WT Pdx activity, respectively. In contrast to the substitution of serine for cysteine at position 73 (C73S), the opposite mutation at position 42 (S42C) was less detrimental (64% WT). The two substitutions at Asp-38 were dramatic in their effects, with the substitution of isoleucine resulting in almost complete loss of activity (<1%), whereas the D38N mutant had 10% WT activity, much less than the D34N mutant (70% WT). The result seen with the W106E substitution was the same (3%) as observed by Davies et al. (14Davies M.D. Qin L. Beck J.L. Suslick K.S. Koga H. Horiuchi T. Sligar S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 7396-7398Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar) with a W106A mutant (2% WT activity). The remaining mutations, D95H, H8Y, and A55V, had no effect on activity, suggesting that these residues are likely to be outside of the interaction sites, and the change in charge of two of these was of no consequence.Table IINADH oxidation by the complete P-450cam system in the presence of camphorMutant putidaredoxinWild type putidaredoxin, NADH oxidationIdentityNADH oxidationMutant Pdx as a % of WT activitys −1%s −1C73S5.6 (0.4)4213.2 (1.1)C73G4.7 (0.6)3613.2 (0.4)C73R0.7 (0.03)613.3 (1.3)S42C8.8 (1.6)6413.8 (1.8)D34N9.1 (0.3)7013.1 (0.3)D38N1.1 (0.1)814.1 (0.2)D38I0.04 (0.02)<114.7 (0.6)W106E0.4 (0.04)314.1 (0.4)D95H14.6 (0.6)10114.5 (0.6)H8Y14.0 (0.6)10213.7 (0.4)A55V14.2 (0.8)9814.5 (0.8)Overall average13.9 (0.9)Multiple assays of each mutant Pdx were conducted on at least two separate occasions according to the protocol outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” Assays with WT Pdx were also conducted on the same day with the same preparations of proteins and substrates as were used to determine the activity of the mutant Pdx.

To do these measurements, we took advantage of the absorbance difference in Pdx at 455 nm as a function of redox state (Fig. 2). We separately measured 1) rates of Pdx reduction by PdR and NADH (Table III) and 2) rates of camphor and CYP101-dependent oxidation of reduced Pdx (Table IV).Table IIIPutidaredoxin reduction by putidaredoxin reductase and NADHMutant putidaredoxinWild type putidaredoxin, Pdx reducedIdentityPdx reducedMutant Pdx activity as a % of WT activitynmol min −1%nmol min −1C73S23.3 (2.1)7730.2 (0.7)C73G17.4 (1.8)6029.2 (0.5)C73R4.3 (0.2)1527.7 (2.1)S42C31.2 (1.7)10031.1 (1.1)D34N30.6 (1.1)11227.3 (1.4)D38N33.0 (4.0)12126.4 (2.4)D38I7.9 (0.3)2729.1 (2.0)W106E18.1 (1.1)6727.1 (2.8)D95H29.7 (0.7)10029.8 (1.1)H8Y32.4 (1.2)10431.2 (1.0)A55V28.3 (2.2)10127.9 (2.4)Overall average28.5 (2.5)See legend for Table II.

Open table in a new tab See legend for Table II. See legend for Table II. Overall, the pattern of activity differences of the mutant Pdx proteins with respect to WT Pdx that was observed in the half-assay reactions was consistent with the differences seen in the complete assay. The three mutant Pdx proteins (D95H, H8Y, and A55V), which showed no changes in the complete camphor-dependent NADH oxidation reaction (Table II), were either the same or not statistically different from the wild type values for the partial reactions. The effect of the mutations at Cys-73 was seen in the interaction of Pdx with PdR but not with CYP101 (Tables III and IV). The primary effect of the mutations at Asp-38, Ser-42, and Trp-106 was on the interaction of Pdx with the CYP101. The W106E mutant exhibited a low rate of activity with CYP101 as would be expected from other studies where substitution of tryptophan with anything other than another aromatic residue reduced activity to very low levels (14Davies M.D. Qin L. Beck J.L. Suslick K.S. Koga H. Horiuchi T. Sligar S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 7396-7398Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 15Davies M.D. Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11383-11389Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The substitution of asparagine for aspartic acid at residue 38 had a significant negative effect on the interaction with CYP101 reducing the activity to 22% WT. Substituting the non-polar residue isoleucine for Asp-38 was even more detrimental, nearly eliminating activity with CYP101. The S42C mutation clearly affected the interaction of Pdx with CYP101, whereas that with PdR was 100% WT. The results of the partial assay measurements with the D34N Pdx mutant presented an anomaly in that there appeared to be a small effect on the interaction of reduced D34N Pdx with CYP101, whereas the activity of this mutant in the total camphor reaction was 30% lower than WT. The effects of the mutation of residues Asp-38, Asp-34, and Trp-106 were not restricted just to interaction with the CYP101 subunit, which provides some evidence for overlap of binding sites on Pdx for PdR and CYP101. The substitution of asparagine at Asp-34 and Asp-38 appeared to result in a small enhancement of activity with respect to PdR. However, the positive effect disappeared with the substitution of the non-polar isoleucine for Asp-38, which resulted in the loss of activity. W106E had somewhat impaired interaction with PdR (67% WT activity), although not to the same degree as its interaction with CYP101. A Michaelis-Menten kinetic analysis was conducted on some of the mutant Pdx species to investigate further the nature of the changes in the interaction between redox partners. These studies were done with the complete camphor assay, measuring NADH oxidation (Table V and Fig. 3). In kinetic studies the reacting substrates are maintained in nonlimiting quantities except for the substrate under investigation. But in this study, the protein subunits were being treated as substrates. It was not possible, for example, to provide unlimited quantities of CYP101 while investigating the kinetics of the reaction with regard to PdR and still be able to measure a linear rate of NADH oxidation over a reasonable period. Therefore, the kinetic parameter values are somewhat specific to this particular assay reaction. The value of the measurements rests not in the absolute numbers but in the comparison with the WT Pdx values.Table VDetermination of apparent kinetic parameters of redox partners for mutant and wild type putidaredoxinPutidaredoxinPdRP450camKmVmaxKmVmaxμ mNADH Ox. s −1μ mNADH Ox. s −1Wild type0.53 (0.03)31 (0.9)0.33 (0.04)24 (2.0)D95H0.55 (0.01)30 (2.8)0.42 (0.12)27 (2.3)C73S2.26 (0.24)33 (3.6)C73G2.24 (0.25)29 (2.9)C73R9.23 (0.72)18 (0.8)S42C1.33 (0.1)30 (3.7)D38N5.96 (1.9)12 (1.3)D34N0.65 (0.2)22 (3.8)W106E20.1 (4.8)11 (2.8)For these experiments the camphor-dependent NADH oxidation was measured with the complete P450cam monooxygenase system as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The concentration of the redox partner under investigation was varied, whereas the concentration of Pdx and the other redox partner was held constant.

Six synthetic chromogenic tPA substrates of the typeR-Xaa-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide, in whichR is an N-terminal protection group, were synthesized to test this property. Although changing the residue Xaa (in itsl or d form) at position P3 from the hydrophobic Phe to an acidic residue, Asp or Glu, gave no improvement in catalytic efficiency, comparative analysis of the substrates indicated a preference for an acidic substituent occupying the S3 site when the S4 site contains a hydrophobic or basic moiety. The 2.9 Å structure determination of the catalytic domain of human tPA in complex with the bis-benzamidine inhibitor 2,7-bis-(4-amidinobenzylidene)-cycloheptan-1-one reveals a three-site interaction, salt bridge formation of the proximal amidino group of the inhibitor with Asp189 in the primary specificity pocket, extensive hydrophobic surface burial, and a weak electrostatic interaction between the distal amidino group of the inhibitor and two carbonyl oxygens of the protein. The latter position was previously occupied by the guanidino group of Arg174, which swings out to form the western edge of the S3 pocket. These data suggest that the side chain of Arg174 is flexible, and does not play a major role in the S4 specificity of tPA.

Recombinant tPA is used therapeutically as a fibrinolytic agent in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism. Its fibrin dependent activity has attracted particular interest as it allows targeting of enzymatic activity to its natural substrate plasminogen (2Rijken D.C. Hoylaerts M. Collen D. J. Biol.

Bauer M. Huber R. Fischer S. Rudolph R. Kohnert U. Bode W. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 117-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Compared with chymotrypsin, tPA contains a deletion of three residues at the C terminus of the A-chain, two single residue deletions in the B-chain, and insertions at six different positions totaling 24 residues. Five of these insertions are noteworthy: one forms a helix, the “intermediate helix” (Pro164–Leu171), 2Residues in this publication are numbered using the chymotrypsinogen numbering, based on the topological equivalence of the proteolytic domain of human tPA with α-chymotrypsinogen (4Lamba D.

Most of these surface loops cluster around the active site cleft and are involved in specific interactions of the molecule with its substrates and inhibitors. tPA exhibits remarkable specificity, a single bond of plasminogen (Arg560–Val561) is the only known substrate cleavage site of tPA in vivo. While the role of the specificity pocket S1 of tPA (and trypsin-like serine proteinases in general) in determining its preference for P1 Arg residues is known, both the location and mechanism of additional specificity determinants remain uncertain (5Madison E.L. Coombs G.S. Corey D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7558-7562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In contrast to its high in vivoactivity and specificity toward plasminogen, tPA shows low activity toward small peptides, peptide substrates modelled according to the cleavage sequence of plasminogen are cleaved by trypsin with much higher activity (>104-fold) (5Madison E.L. Coombs G.S. Corey D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7558-7562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Optimization of the most labile peptide using phage display (6Coombs G.S. Dang A.T. Madison E.L. Corey D.R. J. Biol.

This suggests that tPA recognizes complex or multiple elements on the surface of plasminogen distant from the cleavage site. This might not only represent an increased binding affinity, but also a subtle alteration of the catalytic machinery of the protease domain of tPA. On the other hand, tPA is able to cleave the more labile amide bond ofp-nitroanilide substrates, for example MeSO2-d-HHT-Gly-Arg-pNA (spectrozyme tPA) and Boc-Leu-Gly-Arg-pNA with a catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) only 6.5–18-fold lower than that of trypsin (5Madison E.L.

One of the few non-serpin proteinase inhibitors that block tPA with high affinity is the Erythrina trypsin inhibitor (ETI) (12Heussen C. Joubert F. Dowdle E.B. J. Biol.

Biol. 1996; 258: 117-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Synthetic inhibitors for enzymes of the trypsin family such as tPA have largely been based on Arg and Lys derivatives and the structurally related benzamidines. Remarkable variations are seen in the structure-activity relationships for the inhibition of trypsin family members with benzamidine-type inhibitors (15Markwardt F. Stürzebecher J. Design of Enzyme Inhibitors as Drugs. Oxford University Press, Oxford, New York1989: 619-649Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of tPA (4Lamba D. Bauer M. Huber R. Fischer S. Rudolph R. Kohnert U. Bode W. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 117-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) reveals some special features of the active site region, suggesting a strategy for obtaining more selective p-nitroanilide substrates and inhibitors. Adjacent to the catalytic triad, His57 (322), Asp102 (371), Ser195 (478) (the tPA numbering for the residues of the catalytic triad are given in parentheses), and the oxyanion hole, the specificity pocket S1 is bordered by the segment Ile213–Cys220, including the residue Trp215 (the entrance of the pocket), Asp189–Ser195 (the base of the pocket), Pro225–Tyr229 (the back of the pocket), and the disulfide bridge Cys191–Cys220 (the south of the pocket). Asp189 at the base of the S1 pocket allows salt bridge formation with basic residues. tPA shows a preference for S1 Arg over Lys, explained by the size of the S1 pocket and its lack of other polar residues (4Lamba D. Bauer M. Huber R. Fischer S. Rudolph R. Kohnert U. Bode W. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 117-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 16Ding L. Coombs G.S. Strandberg L. Navre M. Corey D.R. Madison E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7627-7631Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The S2 subsite of tPA is restricted by the imposing phenolic side chain of Tyr99, leading to a preference for small residues such as Gly at position P2 as seen for factor Xa (17Padmanabhan K. Padmanabhan K.P. Tulinsky A. Park C.H. Bode W. Huber R. Blankenship D.T. Cardin A.D. Kisiel W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 947-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Next to the S2 site is a hydrophobic surface, the S4 pocket, with Trp215 at the base and Tyr99 to the east. The pocket is delimited to the west by the side chain of Arg174 and to the north by the main chain atoms of Asp97, Thr98, and Thr175. The side chain of Arg174 in the b-tPA structure (4Lamba D. Bauer M. Huber R. Fischer S. Rudolph R. Kohnert U. Bode W. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 117-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), which points toward the S4 pocket and partially occupies it, has drawn our attention. Its position suggested that it could influence the binding of substrates containing acidic P4 residues for all l-amino acid peptides, or acidic P3 peptides when the P3 residue is in thed-configuration (18Bode W. Mayer I. Baumann U. Huber R. Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3467-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar, 19Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). In the following, we shall use the terms “S3” and “S4” to denote the sites on tPA that would be occupied by a natural extended substrate. For a peptide of the formd-Xaa-Gly-Arg, the P3 side chain would occupy the S4 site, while an amino-terminal substituent would occupy the S3 site. We have constructed and synthesized a series of substrates of the typeR-Xaa-Gly-Arg-pNA. In addition, we have solved the structure of the catalytic domain of two-chain tPA (Fig. 1) in complex with 2,7-bis-(4-amidinobenzylidene)-cycloheptan-1-one, a bis-benzamidine derived inhibitor (see Fig. 2). The inhibitor 2,7-bis-(4-amidinobenzylidene)-cycloheptan-1-one (Pefabloc Xa/tPA, Fig. 2) was kindly provided by the Pentapharm Ltd., Basel, Switzerland. The inhibitory activity was characterized as described elsewhere (20Stürzebecher J. Markwardt F. Wagner G. Walsmann P. Pharmazie. 1982; 37: 281-283PubMed Google Scholar, 21Stürzebecher J.

Six substrates of the type Xaa-Gly-Arg-pNA with d- and l-Phe, d- and l-Glu andd- and l-Asp as Xaa residue where synthesized as described previously (23Svendsen, L. G. (1983) European Patent 0 034 122 B1.Google Scholar). The substrates Boc-Gly-Gly-Arg-pNA, Cbo-l-Val-Gly-Arg-pNA (chromozyme Try), Cmo-d-Val-Gly-Arg-pNA, Cmo-d-Nle-Gly-Arg-pNA (chromozyme X), Cmo-d-Leu-Gly-Arg-pNA, MeSO2-d-Phe-Gly-Arg-pNA (chromozyme tPA), H-CHG-Gly-Arg-pNA, H-d-CHG-Gly-Arg-pNA, Cmo-d-CHG-Gly-Arg-pNA (spectrozyme Xa), H-d-HHT-Gly-Arg-pNA (chromozyme XII), Cmo-d-HHT-Gly-Arg-pNA (spectrozyme LAL), Cmo-d-CHA-Gly-Arg-pNA (pefachrome Xa) and H-d-Lys-Gly-Arg-pNA were kindly provided by Lars Svendsen, Pentapharm Ltd., Basel, Switzerland. Cbo-d-Arg-Gly-Arg-pNA (S-2765) and pGlu-Gly-Arg-pNA (S-2444) were obtained from Hemochrom Diagnostica GmbH, Essen, Germany. Single-chain CHO-tPA, used for kinetic studies, was purified from CHO cells by affinity chromatography on red Sepharose and lysine-Sepharose (24Macartney, H. W., and Menhardt, J.

Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The enzyme concentration (in mg/ml) was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm with ε = 1.81 ml/mg × cm. The molar concentration was calculated with a molecular weight of 60 kDa. The substrates were dissolved in distilled water or dimethyl sulfoxide as necessary. Fifty microliters of the substrate solutions (six concentrations between 20 and 1 mm) were mixed with 0.2 ml HEPES buffer, pH 8.0 (0.1 mm, 0.154 NaCl, 0.1% human serum albumin), and prewarmed to 25 °C. The assays were started by the addition of 25 μl of tPA (34 μg/ml) prewarmed to 25 °C. Determination of the substrate cleavage was performed on microplates using a MR 5000 reader (Dynatech, Denkendorf, Germany). The amidolytic activity was calculated from the absorbance at 405 nm (ε = 6.480 l/mmol × s). The velocity was plotted against the substrate concentration, and the data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation with a nonlinear regression analysis program. Thekcat was calculated fromVmax/enzyme concentration. The des(Val4–Cys261)tPA variant (27Pannekoek H. Lijnen H.R. Loskutoff D.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1990; 64: 600-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) used for crystallization studies was expressed as inclusion bodies inEscherichia coli (strain K12 C600+, containing the helper plasmid pUBS520 with the DNA Y gene). Isolation and solubilization of the inclusion bodies, derivatization and refolding were transformed as described elsewhere (28Kohnert U. Hellerbrand K. Martin U. Stern A. Popp F. Fischer S.

Briefly, E. coli cells were lysed by the addition of lysozyme and subsequent sonification, and the inclusion bodies isolated by centrifugation. Solubilization was achieved by incubation with 6 mguanidium, HCl, and 0.1 m dithioerythriol at pH 8.5. After dialysis against 6 m guanidium HCl, the thiol groups were derivatized with glutathione by incubating the solubilized protein in 0.05 m Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 6 m guanidine, and 0.1 m oxidized glutathione. After dialysis against 3m guanidine, refolding was performed by stepwise addition of 300 ml of protein solution (mixed disulfide) to 10 liter of refolding buffer (0.7 ml-arginine/HCl, pH 8.6, 2 mm GSH, 1 mm EDTA) (31Rudolph, R., and Fischer, S. (1990) United States Patent 4 933 434.Google Scholar, 32Rudolph, R., Fischer, S., and Mattes, R. (1987) European Patent Application 219874.Google Scholar). The refolded protein was purified by affinity chromatography on anErythrina trypsin inhibitor-Sepharose column. The two-chain form was prepared from the refolded and purified tPA protein sample (more than 95% in single-chain form) by incubation with plasmin-Sepharose at room temperature under gentle agitation (27Pannekoek H. Lijnen H.R. Loskutoff D.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1990; 64: 600-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The plasmin-Sepharose was removed by centrifugation. Crystals were grown using the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method. 3 μl of the protein (2.8 mg/ml in 10 mm acetate buffer, pH 5, and 0.8 mm inhibitor) and 1.5 μl of the reservoir solution (0.1 m acetate buffer, pH 5.0, 0.1 m(NH4)2SO4, 25% polyethylene glycol 4000) were mixed and equilibrated at 23 °C against 1 ml of reservoir solution. Plate shaped crystal bushels grew within 1 week. A crystal of 0.2×0.15×0.04 mm3 was mounted and belonged to the monoclinic space group C2 with cell constants a = 151.83 Å, b = 60.50 Å, c = 62.61 Å, α = 90.0°, β = 110.5°, γ = 90.0°. Estimation of the solvent content indicated that the crystals contain 2 molecules per asymmetric unit with a fractional solvent content of 45% (Vm = 2.24 Å3/dalton). Data to 2.8 Å were collected on a multiwire Centronix area detector (Siemens) mounted on a Rigaku rotating anode x-ray generator and processed using XDS (33Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1988; 21: 916-924Crossref Scopus (1681) Google Scholar) (see Table I for crystallographic data). The structure was solved using Patterson search techniques with the program AMoRe (34Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. 1994; A 50,: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5026) Google Scholar) (integration radius 30 Å; resolution range, 15.0–3.5 Å).

Biol. 1996; 258: 117-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The rotation function gave two peaks with 19.8 and 18.3 correlation, the next best angle triplet was less than 50% of the highest correlation value and not included in further translational searches. The translation function corresponding to the two highest peaks yielded correlation values of 25.5 (20.4 for next highest peak) and 27.5 (18.8 for next highest peak). After rigid body refinement with both molecules in the asymmetric unit, the correlation was 60.0 and the R-factor 35.7%.Table ICrystal data and refinement parameters for the bis-benzamidine-tPA complexSpacegroupC2Cell constants (Å) a151.83 b60.50 c62.61 β110.5°Significant measurements25355Independent reflections12586Limiting resolution (Å)2.8Completeness94.4% (∞–2.8 Å) outermost shell86.2% (3.1–2.8 Å)Rmerge1-aRmerge = Σ(I − 〈I〉)/ΣI.8.8% outermost shell25.2% (3.1–2.8 Å)Number of atoms per asymmetric unit Non-hydrogen protein atoms4066 Non-hydrogen inhibitor atoms56 Solvent molecules91Resolution range (Å)7.0–2.9Reflections used for refinement9017Completeness (2ς cutoff)81.2% outermost shell60.4% (3.0–2.9 Å)Rvalue1-bRvalue = Σ(∣Fobs∣ − ∣Fcalc∣)/Σ∣Fobs∣.19.8%Root mean square standard deviation Bond lengths (Å)0.008 Bond angles (degrees)1.428 RMSB (Å2)1-cRMSB = root mean square deviation of the B-factor of bonded atoms.2.2021-a Rmerge = Σ(I − 〈I〉)/ΣI.1-b Rvalue = Σ(∣Fobs∣ − ∣Fcalc∣)/Σ∣Fobs∣.1-c RMSB = root mean square deviation of the B-factor of bonded atoms.

Disordered residues (Tyr6, Gly36A–Gly37E, Asp110A–Ser110C and Arg243–Pro244 of both molecules in the asymmetric unit) and side-chains were excluded from phasing but included in the coordinate set (except the N-terminal and the C-terminal residues of the A-chain, Ser1E–Ser1B and Ser7–Phe11 of both molecules in the asymmetric unit).

One striking feature of b-tPA's active site region is Arg174, which suggests that acidic residues at P3 or P4 might provide additional stabilizing energies. To test this hypothesis, the P3 residue ofp-nitroanilide substrates of the typeR-Xaa-Gly-Arg-pNA was varied, and the kinetic constants for their cleavage by single chain tPA were determined and compared with known chromogenic substrates of this type (see Table II). In general, a clear preference is observed for d-configured amino acids at P3. Substitution of Xaa for the acidic residues d-Asp or d-Glu failed to produce the desired improvement in catalytic efficiency; indeed, these substrates were among the worst tested. On the other hand, the P3 residue l-Asp exhibited the lowestKm value of all l-configured P3 residues. In this case, however, catalysis by tPA was impaired, suggesting that l-Asp-Gly-Arg-pNA does not interact with the active site region of tPA in a suitable conformation for cleavage.Table IIKinetic data for the hydrolysis of p-nitroanilide substrates of the type R-Xaa-Gly-Arg-pNA, where R is an N-terminal protection group, by full-length single-chain tPARP3Kmkcatkcat/Kmmml/sl/mmol × sBocGly3.501.290.37CboVal1.361.691.24Cmod-Val0.80 2-aKm values <1,kcat values >5.0, andkcat/Km values >10 are emphasized in bold.5.777.22Cmod-Nle0.996.826.89Cmod-Leu0.626.9211.2HPhe2.002.791.40Hd-Phe0.707.4610.7Cbod-Phe0.308.9619.9MeSO2d-Phe0.107.3673.6HCHG5.321.360.26Hd-CHG1.536.744.40Cmod-CHG0.425.0211.9Hd-HHT0.8310.612.8Cmod-HHT0.398.3121.3Cmod-CHA0.347.7622.8HAsp0.860.280.32CboAsp0.720.350.49CboAsp(O-t-BU)2.301.840.80Hd-Asp1.700.430.25Cbod-Asp(O-t-BU)1.804.982.77HGlu3.200.130.041CboGlu2.200.750.34CboGlu(O-t-BU)0.901.291.43Hd-Glu2.903.981.37Cbod-Glu2.607.462.87Cbod-Glu(O-t-BU)1.204.483.73pGlu3.154.041.28Hd-Lys2.106.323.01Cbod-Arg0.528.5316.4AcAcetyl-CO-CH3Boctert-Butoxycarbonyl-CO-O-C(CH3)CboBenzyloxycarbonyl-CO-O-CH2-C6H5CHACyclohexylalanyl-NH-CH-(CH2-C6H11)-CO-CHGCyclohexylglycyl-NH-CH-(C6H11)-CO-HHTHexahydrotyrosyl-NH-CH-(CH2-C6H10-OH)-CO-MeSO2Methylsulfonyl-SO2-CH3pNAp-Nitroanilide-NH-C6H4-NO2∣∣pGluPyroglutamic acidCH2-CH2-CO-NH-CH-CO-t-BUtert-Butyl-C(CH3)32-a Km values <1,kcat values >5.0, andkcat/Km values >10 are emphasized in bold. Open table in a new tab The substrates with the highest specificity constant (kcat/Km) were of the formR-d-Xaa-Gly-Arg-pNA, where Xaa is an hydrophobic (phenylalanine or hexahydrotyrosine) or basic (Arg or Lys) residue. Among these substrates, a further gradation in catalytic efficiency was observed according to the protection group of the amino terminus (R-). In each case, a free amino terminus was suboptimal. The kinetic constants of all measured chromogenic substrates of the type R-Xaa-Gly-Arg-pNA are given in Table II. Many specific features of tPA involve interaction with surface elements of the catalytic domain, in particular the surface loops (see Fig. 1). Their role in substrate recognition, cofactor binding and inhibition under physiological conditions has been discussed comprehensively elsewhere (4Lamba D. Bauer M. Huber R. Fischer S. Rudolph R.

In that study, some of the surface loops were not defined by electron density and therefore termed flexible.

https://openalex.org/W2024293060,"In response to low doses of ultraviolet (U.V.) radiation, cells undergo a G2 delay. In this study we have shown that the G2 delay results in the accumulation of inactive forms of cyclin B1/cdc2 and both the G2 and mitotic complexes of cyclin A/cdk. This appears to be through a block in the cdc25-dependent activation of these complexes. The expression and localisation of cyclin A and cyclin B1/cdk complexes are similar in U.V.-induced G2 delay and normal early G2 phase cells. Cdc25B and cdc25C also accumulate to normal G2 levels in U.V. irradiated cells, but the mitotic phosphorylation associated with increased activity of both cdc25B and cdc25C is absent. The cdc25B accumulates in the nucleus of U.V. irradiated cells and in normal G2 phase cells. Thus the block in cyclin B/cdc2 activation is in part due to the physical separation of cyclin B/cdc2, localised in the cytoplasm, from the cdc25B and cdc25C phosphatases localised in the nucleus. The data positions the U.V.-induced G2 checkpoint at either the S/G2 transition or early G2 phase, prior to the activation of cyclin A/cdk2."
https://openalex.org/W2325897517,"Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) is a dual-specificity protein phosphatase encoded by an immediate-early gene responsive to growth factors and stress. The MKP-1 protein selectively inactivates MAP kinases in vitro by dephosphorylation of the regulatory Thr and Tyr residues. Little is known on the mechanisms that regulate MKP-1 gene expression. Here, we demonstrate that Ca2+ is both necessary and sufficient for the induction of MKP-1 gene expression. Treatment of Rat1 fibroblasts with the Ca2+ chelating agent BAPTA completely suppressed serum-induced MKP-1 expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The inhibitory effect of BAPTA was observed at the level of the protein and the mRNA. Importantly, Ca2+ chelation blocked the induction of MKP-1 expression in response to all stimuli tested and in different cell types. Increasing the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ with the ionophore A23187 was sufficient to induce MKP-1 mRNA and protein expression in rat fibroblasts. We also provide evidence that activation of MAP kinases is not an absolute requirement for induction of the MKP-1 gene. Exposure of rat fibroblasts to A23187 induced MKP-1 expression without activating the JNK and p38 MAP kinase pathways. Also, inhibition of the ERK pathway with the selective MEK inhibitor PD98059 did not interfere with serum-stimulated MKP-1 mRNA expression. These results will help define the regulatory mechanisms that govern MKP-1 gene transcription in target cells."

APC localizes to the microtubular network in vivo, while purified APC proteins promote the polymerization of tubulin into microtubules in vitro (8Smith K.J. Levy D.B. Maupin P. Pollard T.D.

In one patient, a frameshift mutation has been identified at nucleotide 7935 of the APC cDNA that results in the loss of 200 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of APC (15Groden J. Gelbert L.

Expression of a similarly truncated mutant protein in cells lacking normal APC protein is sufficient to down-regulate the β-catenin/Tcf signal (14Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3480) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the patient with this germline mutation has a phenotype similar to that of other patients whose mutations have been shown to disrupt this down-regulation function. Therefore, this minimal region of APC must also harbor additional elements that facilitate the function or stability of this tumor suppressor. In addition to binding the DLG protein, these 200 amino acids in the predicted human APC protein sequence include two phosphorylation sites that are identical to the consensus target sequence for the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) family of serine and threonine kinases. Such kinases catalyze the addition of phosphate to their substrates in a cell cycle-specific manner. APC, a phosphoprotein, has been shown to be modified exclusively on serine and threonine residues (16Bhattacharya G. Boman B.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 17Bhattacharjee R.N. Hamada F. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar); therefore this modification could be the result of CDK activity. In this report, we investigated the relationship between APC phosphorylation and the CDKs.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe final 200 carboxyl-terminal residues of APC contain two consensus phosphorylation sites usually targeted by the CDKs (Fig. 1 A). Analysis of the peptide sequence of the full-length APC molecule revealed an additional nine consensus sites, for a total of 11 (Fig. 1 B); each of these is conserved in the predicted mouse and rat APC sequences (data not shown). The majority of these sites are located in the region that is frequently deleted in mutant APC proteins. Populations of asynchronous, G1/S boundary-synchronized, and M-phase-synchronized HCT116 colon carcinoma cells (which express a normal, full-length APC protein) were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate in vivoto look for cell cycle specificity in the incorporation of the isotope in immunoprecipitated APC protein. APC was found to be phosphorylated in each of these cell populations (Fig. 1 C), with no apparent cell cycle-specific incorporation of phosphate into the protein.We subsequently employed the histone H1 kinase assay to evaluate potential CDK modification of APC. Histone H1 is an in vivoand in vitro substrate of CDKs, with the amount of phosphate incorporated in the protein a quantitative indicator of CDK activity. Immunoprecipitates from lysates of asynchronous populations of HCT116 cells contain an H1 kinase activity that coprecipitates with APC-specific antibodies but not with the control antibody (Fig. 2). To ascertain whether this kinase activity is cell cycle-regulated, HCT116 cells were synchronized into G1/S boundary and M-phase populations, and the experiments were repeated. The APC-associated kinase activity was most pronounced during M-phase, with only a low level of activity found in G1/S. Such mitosis-restricted H1 kinase activity is most characteristic of the CDK p34 cdc2-cyclin B complex. In vitro kinase assays using p34 cdc2-specific immunoprecipitates isolated from similar cell lysates revealed that the kinase activity associated with APC and that of p34 cdc2 are most active in the same cell cycle periods. This cell cycle-specific kinase activity is not the result of differential expression of the APC protein, since the protein is present in equivalent quantities throughout the cell cycle as shown by anti-APC immunoblots (Fig. 2 B), nor is it a consequence of a generalized reduction in cellular H1 kinase activity in the examined populations of cells (data not shown). A similar series of H1 kinase assays were performed using immunoprecipitates from the colon carcinoma cell line SW480. This cell line produces an APC protein truncated at residue 1338 (20Nishisho I. Nakamura Y. Miyoshi Y. Miki Y. Ando H. Horii A. Koyama K. Utsunomiya J. Baba S. Hedge P. Science. 1991; 253: 665-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar) and is predicted to contain only one CDK consensus site. The SW480 IgG- and p34-specific immunoprecipitates display associated H1 kinase activity profiles similar to those of HCT116. However, the immunoprecipitates of truncated APC molecules show greatly reduced levels of kinase activity when isolated from asynchronous and mitotic cell lysates (Fig. 2 A), establishing a positive correlation between the presence of APC-associated H1 kinase activity and the carboxyl-terminal region of APC, which contains 10 additional CDK consensus phosphorylation sites.Figure 2Association of APC with a cell cycle-regulated kinase activity.

Phosphorylation of histone H1 was used to measure the level of kinase activity associated in vivo with the complexes immunoprecipitated with normal mouse IgG (IgG), a p34 cdc2-specific antibody (p34), or an APC-specific antibody (APC) from HCT116 or SW480 cell lysates.

To test this, immunoprecipitates from nocodazole-synchronized HCT116 cell lysates were incubated with increasing concentrations of olomoucine, a nucleotide analog that specifically and competitively inhibits several CDKs, including p34 cdc2 (14Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3480) Google Scholar). As expected, olomoucine inhibited the phosphorylation of H1 histone catalyzed by the p34 cdc2immunoprecipitates and a purified recombinant p34 cdc2-cyclin B1 enzyme complex (Fig. 3). The APC-associated kinase activity also was inhibited by olomoucine at a concentration equivalent to that required for inhibition of p34 cdc2 (Fig. 3), suggesting the physical association of an active and inhibitable CDK with APC.Figure 3Olomoucine inhibits APC-associated kinase activity. Recombinant p34 cdc2-cyclin B1 enzyme (p34 enzyme) or p34-specific immunoprecipitates (p34 IP) and APC-specific immunoprecipitates (APC IP) from HCT116 mitotic cell lysates were used in H1 kinase assays in the presence of increasing concentrations of olomoucine. Each data point represents the mean ± S.D. of five independent kinase experiments and is derived from the quantitation of H1 autoradiography relative to an uninhibited control (represented as 0 μm olomoucine).

Quantitation was performed with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Finally, to determine whether APC and p34 cdc2 are associated within the same complex, APC protein was immunoprecipitated from lysates of asynchronous, G1/S boundary, and M-phase HCT116 cells and analyzed by Western blotting for associated p34 cdc2(Fig. 4). Immunoprecipitations with a control antibody (IgG) from mitotic lysates or APC-specific antibodies from asynchronous and G1/S lysates failed to detect associated p34 cdc2. Immunoprecipitation of APC from M-phase lysates, however, revealed that p34 cdc2 coimmunoprecipitated with APC. The presence of p34 cdc2 consensus sites in APC, its association with an olomoucine-inhibitable H1 kinase activity, and the physical interaction of APC and p34 cdc2 strongly indicate that the H1 kinase activity present in APC immunoprecipitates is attributable to p34 cdc2 kinase.Figure 4APC associates with p34 cdc2 in vivo. Immunoprecipitates isolated with normal mouse IgG (IgG), a p34 cdc2-specific antibody (p34), or an APC-specific antibody (APC) from asynchronous (AS), mimosine-treated (G1/S), or nocodazole-treated (M) HCT116 cell lysates were resolved on a 10% acrylamide gel by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using the monoclonal antibody cdc2 (17Bhattacharjee R.N.

Microtubules, for example, associate both with APC (8Smith K.J. Levy D.B. Maupin P. Pollard T.D. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3672-3675PubMed Google Scholar, 9Munemitsu S. Souza B. Müller O. Albert I. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3676-3681PubMed Google Scholar) and p34 cdc2 (21Tombes R.M. Peloquin J.G. Borisy G.G. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 861-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 22Ookata K. Hinsanaga S. Okumura E. Kishimoto T. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 873-881PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, the presence and activity of p34 cdc2 may be required for the activation of another coimmunoprecipitated kinase which may modify APC. Therefore, the capacity of APC to act as a direct substrate of the human p34 cdc2-cyclin B1 active kinase complex was evaluated. A fragment of APC encoding the residues 2141–2844 was cloned in-frame with a FLAG epitope (FLAG-APC) and introduced into bacteria. This region of APC contains 8 of the 11 putative CDK consensus sites (Fig. 5 A). Bacterially expressed FLAG-APC protein was recovered by immunoprecipitation and incubated with recombinant human p34 cdc2-cyclin B1. The FLAG-APC protein was phosphorylated by the kinase (Fig. 5, Band C).Figure 5In vitro phosphorylation of APC by p34 cdc2. Control antibody (IgG) and FLAG-PROBE (FLAG) immunoprecipitates from uninduced (−) and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced (+) lysates of bacteria harboring the FLAG-APC expression construct were incubated with recombinant human p34 cdc2-cyclin B1 complex in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and resolved by SDS-PAGE on an 8% gel.

Numbers on theright indicate approximate molecular masses in kDa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Although p34 cdc2 is best recognized for its role in the G2/M transition, we have now shown that its activity is associated with APC during M-phase of the cell cycle. This kinase not only phosphorylates APC in vitro but likely targets this tumor suppressor as a substrate in vivo. Our data (Fig. 1 C), as well as that of another recent study (17Bhattacharjee R.N. Hamada F. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), have demonstrated that APC is phosphorylated throughout the cell cycle and that APC becomes hyperphosphorylated during M-phase, suggesting that additional kinases may be responsible for phosphorylating APC. Indeed, APC is known to be phosphorylated by two other kinases in vitro: protein kinase A and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (23Rubinfeld B. Albert I. Porfini E. Fiol C. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Science. 1996; 272: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of APC by these kinases regulates the binding, turnover, and subsequent degradation of β-catenin in association with APC and therefore controls β-catenin-transduced signaling. The interaction of β-catenin with APC is unchanged in the G1/S boundary and M-phase populations of HCT116 cells, suggesting that modification of APC by p34 cdc2 does not directly affect this association quantitatively 2C. Trzepacz and J. Groden, unpublished data. although the rate of APC-mediated β-catenin degradation may be influenced. It also remains possible that phosphorylation of APC at CDK consensus sites alters its ability to interact with other proteins, and that a cell cycle-specific change in such interactions mediates some of the tumor-suppressing effects of APC.Substrates of the CDK family include diverse proteins, both nuclear and cytoplasmic, that are critically involved in the regulation or mechanics of the cell cycle (24Nigg E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Furthermore, their phosphorylation by CDKs often dictates functional status. By extension, the phosphorylation of APC by p34 cdc2 may result in similar cell cycle-regulated modulations of APC-mediated tumor suppression by altering a domain of APC that is frequently deleted by mutation. It remains to be determined whether the loss of CDK consensus phosphorylation sites is sufficient to disrupt APC function. The tumor suppressor protein APC 1The abbreviations used are: APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; DLG, discs large protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.1The abbreviations used are: APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; DLG, discs large protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. is inactivated by mutation in over 80% of all colorectal cancers, both sporadic and familial.

To ascertain whether this kinase activity is cell cycle-regulated, HCT116 cells were synchronized into G1/S boundary and M-phase populations, and the experiments were repeated. The APC-associated kinase activity was most pronounced during M-phase, with only a low level of activity found in G1/S. Such mitosis-restricted H1 kinase activity is most characteristic of the CDK p34 cdc2-cyclin B complex. In vitro kinase assays using p34 cdc2-specific immunoprecipitates isolated from similar cell lysates revealed that the kinase activity associated with APC and that of p34 cdc2 are most active in the same cell cycle periods. This cell cycle-specific kinase activity is not the result of differential expression of the APC protein, since the protein is present in equivalent quantities throughout the cell cycle as shown by anti-APC immunoblots (Fig. 2 B), nor is it a consequence of a generalized reduction in cellular H1 kinase activity in the examined populations of cells (data not shown). A similar series of H1 kinase assays were performed using immunoprecipitates from the colon carcinoma cell line SW480. This cell line produces an APC protein truncated at residue 1338 (20Nishisho I. Nakamura Y. Miyoshi Y. Miki Y. Ando H. Horii A. Koyama K. Utsunomiya J. Baba S. Hedge P. Science. 1991; 253: 665-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar) and is predicted to contain only one CDK consensus site. The SW480 IgG- and p34-specific immunoprecipitates display associated H1 kinase activity profiles similar to those of HCT116. However, the immunoprecipitates of truncated APC molecules show greatly reduced levels of kinase activity when isolated from asynchronous and mitotic cell lysates (Fig. 2 A), establishing a positive correlation between the presence of APC-associated H1 kinase activity and the carboxyl-terminal region of APC, which contains 10 additional CDK consensus phosphorylation sites.The p34 cdc2-cyclin B complex is active during M-phase; its association with APC may be one source of the H1 kinase activity associated with APC in this segment of the cell cycle. To test this, immunoprecipitates from nocodazole-synchronized HCT116 cell lysates were incubated with increasing concentrations of olomoucine, a nucleotide analog that specifically and competitively inhibits several CDKs, including p34 cdc2 (14Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3480) Google Scholar). As expected, olomoucine inhibited the phosphorylation of H1 histone catalyzed by the p34 cdc2immunoprecipitates and a purified recombinant p34 cdc2-cyclin B1 enzyme complex (Fig. 3). The APC-associated kinase activity also was inhibited by olomoucine at a concentration equivalent to that required for inhibition of p34 cdc2 (Fig. 3), suggesting the physical association of an active and inhibitable CDK with APC.Figure 3Olomoucine inhibits APC-associated kinase activity. Recombinant p34 cdc2-cyclin B1 enzyme (p34 enzyme) or p34-specific immunoprecipitates (p34 IP) and APC-specific immunoprecipitates (APC IP) from HCT116 mitotic cell lysates were used in H1 kinase assays in the presence of increasing concentrations of olomoucine. Each data point represents the mean ± S.D. of five independent kinase experiments and is derived from the quantitation of H1 autoradiography relative to an uninhibited control (represented as 0 μm olomoucine). Values for each point are: p34 enzyme, 100, 94 ± 14, 76.6 ± 5.1, 65.4 ± 14.1, 49.7 ± 28.2, 26.8 ± 14.3, 24.5 ± 8.8, 11.6 ± 2.4; p34 IP, 100, 86.7 ± 18.7, 73.4 ± 26.2, 55.9 ± 17.1, 46.5 ± 19.1, 29.6 ± 14.6, 34.8 ± 3.5, 23.6 ± 9.5; APC IP, 100, 82.6 ± 22.2, 66.2 ± 19.7, 74.2 ± 25.4, 45.1 ± 18.4, 30.7 ± 3.6, 30.9 ± 6.7, 24.0 ± 12.9. Quantitation was performed with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Finally, to determine whether APC and p34 cdc2 are associated within the same complex, APC protein was immunoprecipitated from lysates of asynchronous, G1/S boundary, and M-phase HCT116 cells and analyzed by Western blotting for associated p34 cdc2(Fig. 4). Immunoprecipitations with a control antibody (IgG) from mitotic lysates or APC-specific antibodies from asynchronous and G1/S lysates failed to detect associated p34 cdc2. Immunoprecipitation of APC from M-phase lysates, however, revealed that p34 cdc2 coimmunoprecipitated with APC. The presence of p34 cdc2 consensus sites in APC, its association with an olomoucine-inhibitable H1 kinase activity, and the physical interaction of APC and p34 cdc2 strongly indicate that the H1 kinase activity present in APC immunoprecipitates is attributable to p34 cdc2 kinase.Figure 4APC associates with p34 cdc2 in vivo. Immunoprecipitates isolated with normal mouse IgG (IgG), a p34 cdc2-specific antibody (p34), or an APC-specific antibody (APC) from asynchronous (AS), mimosine-treated (G1/S), or nocodazole-treated (M) HCT116 cell lysates were resolved on a 10% acrylamide gel by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using the monoclonal antibody cdc2 (17Bhattacharjee R.N.

Microtubules, for example, associate both with APC (8Smith K.J. Levy D.B. Maupin P. Pollard T.D. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3672-3675PubMed Google Scholar, 9Munemitsu S.

Alternatively, the presence and activity of p34 cdc2 may be required for the activation of another coimmunoprecipitated kinase which may modify APC. Therefore, the capacity of APC to act as a direct substrate of the human p34 cdc2-cyclin B1 active kinase complex was evaluated. A fragment of APC encoding the residues 2141–2844 was cloned in-frame with a FLAG epitope (FLAG-APC) and introduced into bacteria. This region of APC contains 8 of the 11 putative CDK consensus sites (Fig. 5 A). Bacterially expressed FLAG-APC protein was recovered by immunoprecipitation and incubated with recombinant human p34 cdc2-cyclin B1. The FLAG-APC protein was phosphorylated by the kinase (Fig. 5, Band C).Figure 5In vitro phosphorylation of APC by p34 cdc2. Control antibody (IgG) and FLAG-PROBE (FLAG) immunoprecipitates from uninduced (−) and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced (+) lysates of bacteria harboring the FLAG-APC expression construct were incubated with recombinant human p34 cdc2-cyclin B1 complex in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and resolved by SDS-PAGE on an 8% gel.

This kinase not only phosphorylates APC in vitro but likely targets this tumor suppressor as a substrate in vivo. Our data (Fig. 1 C), as well as that of another recent study (17Bhattacharjee R.N. Hamada F. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), have demonstrated that APC is phosphorylated throughout the cell cycle and that APC becomes hyperphosphorylated during M-phase, suggesting that additional kinases may be responsible for phosphorylating APC. Indeed, APC is known to be phosphorylated by two other kinases in vitro: protein kinase A and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (23Rubinfeld B. Albert I. Porfini E. Fiol C. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Science. 1996; 272: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of APC by these kinases regulates the binding, turnover, and subsequent degradation of β-catenin in association with APC and therefore controls β-catenin-transduced signaling. The interaction of β-catenin with APC is unchanged in the G1/S boundary and M-phase populations of HCT116 cells, suggesting that modification of APC by p34 cdc2 does not directly affect this association quantitatively 2C. Trzepacz and J. Groden, unpublished data. although the rate of APC-mediated β-catenin degradation may be influenced. It also remains possible that phosphorylation of APC at CDK consensus sites alters its ability to interact with other proteins, and that a cell cycle-specific change in such interactions mediates some of the tumor-suppressing effects of APC.Substrates of the CDK family include diverse proteins, both nuclear and cytoplasmic, that are critically involved in the regulation or mechanics of the cell cycle (24Nigg E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Furthermore, their phosphorylation by CDKs often dictates functional status. By extension, the phosphorylation of APC by p34 cdc2 may result in similar cell cycle-regulated modulations of APC-mediated tumor suppression by altering a domain of APC that is frequently deleted by mutation. It remains to be determined whether the loss of CDK consensus phosphorylation sites is sufficient to disrupt APC function. The final 200 carboxyl-terminal residues of APC contain two consensus phosphorylation sites usually targeted by the CDKs (Fig. 1 A). Analysis of the peptide sequence of the full-length APC molecule revealed an additional nine consensus sites, for a total of 11 (Fig. 1 B); each of these is conserved in the predicted mouse and rat APC sequences (data not shown). The majority of these sites are located in the region that is frequently deleted in mutant APC proteins. Populations of asynchronous, G1/S boundary-synchronized, and M-phase-synchronized HCT116 colon carcinoma cells (which express a normal, full-length APC protein) were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate in vivoto look for cell cycle specificity in the incorporation of the isotope in immunoprecipitated APC protein. APC was found to be phosphorylated in each of these cell populations (Fig. 1 C), with no apparent cell cycle-specific incorporation of phosphate into the protein. We subsequently employed the histone H1 kinase assay to evaluate potential CDK modification of APC. Histone H1 is an in vivoand in vitro substrate of CDKs, with the amount of phosphate incorporated in the protein a quantitative indicator of CDK activity. Immunoprecipitates from lysates of asynchronous populations of HCT116 cells contain an H1 kinase activity that coprecipitates with APC-specific antibodies but not with the control antibody (Fig. 2).

https://openalex.org/W2019570564,"Sequence-specific transactivation of target genes is one of the most important molecular properties of the tumor suppressor p53. Binding of p53 to its target DNAs is tightly regulated, with modifications in the carboxy-terminal regulatory domain of the p53 protein playing an important role. In this study we examined the possible influence of DNA structure on sequence-specific DNA binding by p53, by analysing its binding to p53 consensus elements adopting different conformations. We found that p53 has the ability to bind to consensus elements which are present in a double-helical form, as well as to consensus elements which are located within alternative non-B-DNA structures. The ability of a consensus element to adopt either one of these conformations is dependent on its sequence symmetry, and is strongly influenced by its sequence environment. Our data suggest a model according to which the conformational status of the target DNA is an important determinant for sequence-specific DNA binding by p53. Modifications in the carboxy-terminal regulatory region of p53 possibly determine the preference of p53 for a given DNA conformation."

D., and Taylor, S. I. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 26286–26294). The aim of the present study was to further investigate the exact mechanism of this control process. Constitutive and insulin-induced HIR internalizations were studied biochemically and morphologically in NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing either a double alanine (amino acid residues 986–987) mutant HIR (HIR AA1) or HIR truncated at either amino acid residue 981 (HIR Δ981) or 1000 (HIR Δ1000). Data collected indicate that: (a) the three mutant HIR show a reduced association with microvilli as compared with HIR wild-type; (b) the two receptors containing the dileucine motif (HIR WT and HIR Δ1000) show the highest propensity to associate with clathrin-coated pits, independently of kinase activation; (c) the two receptors lacking the dileucine motif but containing two tyrosine-based motifs, previously described as participating in clathrin-coated pit segregation, associate with these surface domains with a lower affinity than the two others, (d) in the presence of the kinase domain, an unmasking of the tyrosine-based motifs mediated by kinase activation is required.These results indicate that the dileucine motif is not sufficient by itself, but participates in anchoring HIR on microvilli and that another sequence, located downstream from position 1000 is crucial for this event. This dileucine motif also plays a role in HIR segregation in clathrin-coated pits.

The activated receptor then moves in the plane of the plasma membrane, and gains access to the non-villous domains of the cell surface, where it is internalized via the clathrin-coated pits. Very little information is available regarding the receptor domain(s) involved in the retention of unoccupied receptors on microvilli or about the cellular component(s) that anchor(s) the insulin receptor on microvilli. The mechanism(s) allowing kinase activation to induce the release of the insulin receptor to migrate away from microvilli are also unresolved. In contrast, some light was shed on the subsequent surface steps. The speed of the surface shift has been shown to depend at least in part on the structure of the receptor transmembrane domain (7Goncalves E. Yamada K. Thatte H.S. Backer J.M. Golan D.E. Kahn C.R.

Cell. 1990; 63: 1061-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Recently, a dileucine motif present within exon 17 (Leu986and Leu987) has been shown to participate in the control of insulin receptor internalization and sorting inside the cell (20Renfrew Haft C. Klausner R.D. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26286-26294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of these two leucines for alanines indeed results in a decreased insulin-induced internalization of the mutant receptor. In addition, the direct fusion of this dileucine motif (together with four neighboring amino acids) to the carboxyl terminus of Tac to form a chimeric molecule identified this motif as a lysosomal sorting sequence (20Renfrew Haft C. Klausner R.D. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26286-26294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present work was designed to further investigate the role of this dileucine motif encoded by exon 17. To that end, two truncated receptors (at positions 981 and 1000, respectively) were prepared in addition to the dileucine mutant receptor previously described. Constitutive as well as insulin-induced internalization processes were analyzed both biochemically and morphologically at the electron microscopic level. Results collected indicate that the sequence anchoring the unoccupied insulin receptors on microvilli is located downstream from Glu1000 and that the dileucine motif at positions 986–987 participates in the control of this anchoring. In addition, our observations reveal that this dileucine motif plays a role in the segregation of the insulin receptor in clathrin-coated pits. This latter function of the dileucine motif is additive with that of the tyrosine-based motifs present in exon 16 but the role of the dileucine motif predominates. Receptor tyrosine kinase is not required for this function of the dileucine motif. In contrast, the function of tyrosine-based motifs to segregate receptors in clathrin-coated pits requires kinase activation. The plasmids containing either the mutant insulin receptor with 2 alanines substituted for the Leu-Leu pair at positions 986–987 or the insulin receptor truncated at position 981 were previously described (20Renfrew Haft C.

The receptor truncated at position 1000 was constructed as follows. A fragment containing nucleotides 2289–3265 of the human insulin receptor cDNA (23Ebina Y. Ellis L. Jarnagin K. Edery M. Graf L. Clauser E. Ou J.-H. Masiarz F. Kan Y.W. Goldfine I.D. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J.

The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with AvrII and BfrI to yield a 858-base pair fragment. This fragment was substituted for the AvrII/BfrI segment (2298–4326) of the wild-type insulin receptor cDNA. This construction was verified by nucleotide sequencing and subcloned into a bovine papilloma virus-based expression vector pBPV (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), in which insulin receptor cDNA expression was driven by the murine metallothionin promoter. NIH 3T3 cells (∼750,000 cells) in Petri dishes (10 cm in diameter) were transfected using 40 μl of Lipofectin (Life Sciences Technologies Inc.) and a mixture of 1 μg of pRSV-Neo (a plasmid encoding neomycin resistance) and 5 μg of pBPV-HIR Δ1000. After selection for resistance to the antibiotic G418 (800 μg/ml) (Life Technologies, Inc.), stable transfectants were isolated by FACS (fluorescence-activated cell sorter). Cells were recovered by EDTA treatment and incubated for 30 min with 500 μl of biotinylated anti-HIR 1The abbreviations used are: HIR, human insulin receptor; WT, wild-type; mAb, monoclonal antibody. antibody (1:500 in phosphate-buffered saline, 1% bovine serum albumin) at 4 °C, After three washes, 100 μl of streptavidin R-phycoerytherin conjugate (1:20) (Caltag Laboratories Inc., San Franscico, CA) were added for 30 min in the dark. Flow cytometry was performed on a Becton Dickinson FACScan. Cell surface expression was verified by125I-insulin binding. Confluent monolayers of NIH 3T3 cells expressing either the wild-type or mutant receptors were first incubated for 2 h at 4 °C in the presence of 5 pm125I-mAb 83-14 (constitutive internalization) or 50 pm125I-insulin (insulin-induced internalization) then transferred to 37 °C for various periods of time. At each time point studied, the unbound 125I-ligand was removed and cells were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then subjected to three 5-min washes with cold phosphate-buffered saline at pH 1.5 to release the125I-ligand bound at the cell surface. Finally, cells were lysed in 1 n NaOH and all samples (acid washes and lysates) were counted in a γ-counter to determine the internalized radioactivity versus total radioactivity. Confluent monolayers of NIH 3T3 cells were grown up in Petri dishes (10 cm in diameter). Cell surface proteins were biotinylated as described in Ref.24Levy-Toledano R. Caro L.H.P. Hindman N. Taylor S.I. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1803-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar. Briefly, cells were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5 mg/ml N-hydroxysuccinimide long chain biotin (Pierce) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were then incubated in 5 ml of binding buffer in the absence or presence of 10−7m insulin for 15 min at 37 °C. Cell surface proteins were subjected to Pronase digestion (2.5 mg/ml, Boehringer Mannheim) for 1 h at 4 °C. Thereafter, cells were washed and solubilized in 500 μl of lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors. Insulin receptors were immunoprecipitated with a mixture of rabbit antibodies (B7 and B10) or with a monoclonal antibody (83-14) directed against the α-subunits of the human insulin receptor. After SDS-polyacrylamide (6.5%) gel electrophoresis and electroblotting, nitrocellulose sheets were probed with horseradish peroxidase-linked streptavidin (Amersham) at a dilution of 1:500. After extensive washes, enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham). Signals were analyzed by densitometry (Molecular Dynamics). After incubation at 37 °C in the presence of tracer amount of 125I-insulin (10−11m), cells were fixed, dehydrated, and quantitated as described previously (1Carpentier J.L. Paccaud J.P. Gorden P. Rutter W.J. Orci L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For each time point studied, three Epon blocks were prepared and sectioned. About 450–600 grains were analyzed from morphologically intact cells. Grains within a distance of 1 ± 250 nm from the plasma membrane were considered associated with cell surface; grains inside the cytoplasm and >250 nm from the plasma membrane were considered internalized. Grains present at the plasma membrane fell into the following classes: microvilli, clathrin-coated pits, non-villous nonclathrin-coated pit segments, and uninterpretable. Grains were considered associated with microvilli or clathrin-coated pits if the center was <250 nm from the surface domains. NIH 3T3 fibroblast cell lines were transfected with an expression vector encoding wild-type or one of three mutant insulin receptors: HIR with a pair of alanines in place of the dileucines normally present at positions 986 and 987 (AA1) (20Renfrew Haft C. Klausner R.D. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26286-26294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), HIR truncated at position 981 (Δ981) or truncated at position 1000 (Δ1000) (Fig. 1). HIR AA1 exhibited close to normal β-subunit phosphorylation as well as insulin-induced phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (20Renfrew Haft C. Klausner R.D. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26286-26294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while, as expected, HIR Δ981 and HIR Δ1000, were not autophosphorylated (data not shown). HIR cytoplasmic domain contains several dileucine motifs, one of which (leucines 986–987) has been proposed to play a role in HIR internalization (20Renfrew Haft C. Klausner R.D. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26286-26294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In an attempt to clarify the exact function of this dileucine motif in the internalization process, the internalization previously reported defect was studied by comparing constitutive and insulin-induced insulin receptor internalizations in HIR AA1 and HIR WT cells by various methodological approaches. First, comparison of the constitutive internalization (i.e. in the absence of insulin) of the two receptors was carried out by using a monoclonal anti-human insulin receptor antibody (83-14) coupled to125I as a ligand (25Paccaud J.-P. Siddle K. Carpentier J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13101-13106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions, constitutive HIR internalization observed in AA1 cells and in WT cells were identical (Fig. 2). Second, insulin-induced internalization was compared in WT and AA1 cells by tracking 125I-insulin internalization both by the acid wash technique and by quantitative EM autoradiography. Both techniques confirmed an inhibition of the internalization rate and a decrease in the total amount of radioactivity recovered inside AA1 cells at each time point studied (Fig. 2 and data not shown). Third, we compared constitutive and insulin-induced internalization in the same experiment by analyzing internalization of biotinylated receptors. According to this procedure, cell surface proteins were labeled with biotin, and cells further incubated at 37 °C in the presence or absence of insulin (10−7m) for 15 min to promote receptor internalization. At the end of this incubation, biotinylated receptors at the cell surface were digested with Pronase. Internalized insulin receptors were protected from digestion. After cells were solubilized, biotinylated receptors were immunoprecipitated with anti-insulin receptor antibody (mAb 83-14). Biotinylated receptors were quantitated in a blotting experiment using horseradish peroxidase-labeled streptavidin (Figs. 3,A and B). Under these circumstances, the slow constitutive internalization of AA1 receptors was accelerated by insulin, but this stimulation was smaller in magnitude than that observed in WT cells, where more than 70% of biotinylated receptors became resistant to Pronase digestion by 15 min of incubation at 37 °C (Fig. 3). Taken together, these internalization studies demonstrate that insulin-stimulated HIR internalization is inhibited when the two leucines present at positions 986 and 987 are replaced by alanines, while constitutive internalization is relatively normal in this mutant receptor.Figure 3Internalization of biotinylated insulin receptors in the absence or presence of insulin. Cell surface proteins of confluent NIH 3T3 cells expressing either WT or mutant insulin receptors were biotinylated as described under “Materials and Methods.” Cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 100 nm insulin for 15 min at 37 °C and then subjected to Pronase digestion at 4 °C to remove any biotinylated receptors remaining at the cell surface. Insulin receptors were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and subjected to 6.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. After electroblotting, nitrocellulose sheets were probed with horseradish peroxidase-linked streptavidin. Signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence and analyzed by densitometry.

These two receptors (HIR Δ981 and HIR Δ1000) have in common the absence of the kinase domain but they differ by the presence (HIR Δ1000) or absence (HIR Δ981) of the dileucine motif. Following biotinylation of the cell surface, constitutive internalization of HIR Δ981 and HIR Δ1000 was more rapid than in the case of HIR WT (Fig. 3). Moreover, insulin did not accelerate internalization of either truncated receptors, confirming that these two mutant receptors were internalized in a constitutive way (Fig. 3). Based on these observations, further studies of these two truncated receptors were performed by measuring receptor-mediated endocytosis of 125I-mAb 83-14. In both cases, the internalization rate as well as the maximal amount of radioactive material internalized were significantly higher than those recorded in WT cells (Fig. 4). The highest values were obtained in Δ1000 cells, where >55% of total cell associated radioactivity was found inside the cells by 15 min of incubation at 37 °C (Fig. 4). In the case of Δ981 cells, both the internalization rate and the maximal amount of radioactivity internalized were intermediate between those obtained in Δ1000 cells and in WT cells (Fig. 4). Thus, HIR Δ1000 contains, in its native and unoccupied state, all the elements allowing the optimal internalization of HIR while HIR Δ981 appears to lack one or more of these elements. To further understand why the two truncated receptors differ in terms of their internalization capacities and in an attempt to shed some light on how the 986–987 dileucine motif participates in HIR internalization, a morphological ultrastructural analysis of the surface distribution of the above described mutants was carried out. As determined by quantitative EM autoradiography analysis, in conditions revealing the localization of unoccupied receptors (2 h of incubation at 4 °C in the presence of 125I-mAb 83-14), HIR WT preferentially associated with microvilli on the surface of NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 5). In contrast, in the case of receptors truncated at position 981 and 1000 and constitutively internalized, such preferential initial localization was not observed (Fig. 5). These observations confirm and extend the previously described lack of association with microvilli of a receptor truncated at position 965 (6Carpentier J.-L. McClain D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5001-5006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). HIR AA1 behaved similarly to the truncated receptors: at the end of a 4 °C incubation in the presence of either125I-mAb 83-14 or 125I-insulin, it did not preferentially associate with microvilli (Figs. 5 and6).Figure 6Surface redistribution of125I-insulin and 125I-mAb 83-14 in transfected NIH 3T3 cells. After incubation at 37 °C in the presence of a tracer amount of 125I-insulin (A) or125I-mAb 83-14 (B) for various periods of time, cells were processed for EM autoradiography. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. of the analysis of three different Epon blocks from two individual experiments (n = 6). They represent the percentage of the total number of grains associated with the cell surface (±250 nm from the plasma membrane) whose centers were within a distance of 250 nm from a microvillus.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As a function of incubation time at 37 °C, 125I-insulin moved in the plane of the plasma membrane of WT cells so that by 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, ≈70% of the autoradiographic grains were scored as associated with non-villous domains of the cell surface, indicating a preferential association with these surface regions (Fig. 6 A). In the case of AA1 cells, although HIR AA1 did not preferentially associate with microvilli (see above), a surface redistribution of 125I-insulin was observed, attesting to a preferential association of the mutant receptor with the non-villous domains of the cell surface (Fig. 6 A). In contrast, the two receptors containing an active kinase (HIR WT and HIR AA1), did not redistribute in the sole presence of 125I-mAb 83-14 (Fig. 6) although these two receptors did undergo internalization in response to insulin binding. In the case of the two truncated receptors tagged with 125I-mAb 83-14, a redistribution reflecting a progressive concentration of the receptors in the non-villous domains of the cell surface was noted (Fig. 6 B). Taken together with the biochemical observations (see above), these morphological data demonstrate that the receptor signal sequence responsible for HIR anchoring on microvilli is located downstream from amino acid 1000. The dileucine motif present at positions 986–987 also participates in this anchoring process although it is not sufficient to maintain the unoccupied receptor on microvilli. In the presence of insulin, normal insulin receptors are classically segregated in the internalization gates present on the non-villous surface domains: the clathrin-coated pits (26Carpentier J.L. Brown D. Iacopetta B.J. Orci L. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 887-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 27Carpentier J.L.

A. 1982; 79: 7788-7791Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A rapid concentration of HIR WT in clathrin-coated pits was similarly observed in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts in the presence of insulin (Fig. 7 B). As described previously (25Paccaud J.-P. Siddle K. Carpentier J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13101-13106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), even in the absence of insulin (125I-mAb 83-14 experiments) a progressively increasing proportion of HIR WT was associated with clathrin-coated pits (Fig. 7 A). However, association with clathrin-coated pits remained significantly lower than that observed when 125I-insulin was used as ligand (Fig. 7,A and B). Under similar experimental conditions (125I-mAb 83-14 experiments), HIR AA1 association with clathrin-coated pits remained low at all time points studied (Fig. 7 A). In the presence of 125I-insulin, HIR AA1 progressively associated with clathrin-coated pits but with a lower affinity for these surface domains than HIR WT under the same conditions (Fig. 7 B). HIR Δ981, which undergoes ligand-independent internalization (see above and Fig. 3), also associated with clathrin-coated pits but with a low affinity, similar to that of HIR AA1 in the presence of insulin (Fig. 7 B). In contrast, HIR Δ1000, which also undergoes constitutive internalization but at a higher rate than HIR Δ981 (see above and Fig. 3), showed the highest association with clathrin-coated pits at all time points studied. By 2 h of incubation at 4 °C, 13% of the radioactive ligand was already present within these surface domains (in contrast to ≈5% in all other cell lines), and this value reached a maximum of 23% by 30 min of incubation at 37 °C) (Fig. 7 A). To better discriminate the propensity of the various HIR to associate with clathrin-coated pits independently of their capacity to anchor to microvilli, the morphological quantitative analysis was limited to the autoradiographic grains present on the non-villous domains of the cell surface. In this analysis, both HIR WT (+insulin) and HIR Δ1000 showed the highest affinity for clathrin-coated pits (Fig. 8). In contrast, the two mutant receptors which lack the 986–987 dileucine motif (HIR AA1 (+insulin) and HIR Δ981), showed a comparable propensity to associate with these surface invagination gates but their affinity for clathrin-coated pits was half that noted for the two first receptors (Fig. 8). Based on these observations, it can be concluded that the dileucine motif is involved in HIR anchoring on clathrin-coated pits. Moreover, since a significant residual association with clathrin-coated pits is detected in both HIR AA1 (+insulin) and HIR Δ981, it is evident that (an)other motif(s) is(are) additive to the dileucine motif in this function. The GPLY and NPEY motifs, present in the juxtamembrane domain of HIR and retained in both HIR AA1 and HIR Δ981, have been demonstrated previously to play such a role (11Thies R.S. Webster N.J.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5974-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 19Grauschopf U. Winther J.R. Korber P. Zander T. Dallinger P. Bardwell J.C.A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 189-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The low pKa of Cys30 qualitatively explains that reduced DsbA is more stable than oxidized DsbA (21Zapun A. Bardwell J.C.A. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5083-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 22Wunderlich M. Jaenicke R. Glockshuber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), that it is the strongest oxidant in the family of disulfide oxidoreductases (21Zapun A. Bardwell J.C.A. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5083-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 23Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and that it undergoes extremely fast reactions with thiol substrates (21Zapun A. Bardwell J.C.A. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5083-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 24Wunderlich M. Otto A. Seckler R. Glockshuber R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12251-12256Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Although the residues of the XX dipeptide have been shown to influence the pKa of DsbA Cys30 thiol (19Grauschopf U. Winther J.R. Korber P. Zander T. Dallinger P. Bardwell J.C.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 947-955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), it is still unclear whether charged residues in the vicinity of the active-site helix or the helix dipole alone are responsible for the low pKa of Cys30 in reduced wild type DsbA. In the case of thioredoxin, values between 6.7 and ∼9 have been published for the pKa of the nucleophilic cysteine Cys32 (10Kallis G.-B. Holmgren A. J. Biol.

Besides charged residues in the vicinity of the active-site helix, other explanations have been proposed for a lowered pKa of the nucleophilic thiol in human and E. coli thioredoxin such as the dipole of the α-helix (29Hol W.G.J.

Thioredoxin, PDI, and DsbA homologues possess a conserved amino acid pair (Asp26/Lys57 in E. colithioredoxin, Glu47/Lys80 and Glu391/Lys424 in human PDI, and Glu24/Lys58 in E. coli DsbA (Fig. 2)) that is likely to form a buried salt bridge in the vicinity of the active-site disulfide (17Martin J.L.

The hydrophobic environment of the salt bridges gave rise to speculation that they may directly or indirectly contribute to the lowered pKa values of the nucleophilic cysteines by electrostatic interactions (38Gane P.J. Freedman R.B. Warwicker J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 376-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition, elevated pKa values of 7.5 and ≥9 were determined for Asp26 of both oxidized and reduced thioredoxin in the presence or absence of the salt bridge, respectively (35Langsetmo K.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), which was assumed to be directly linked to the redox properties of thioredoxin. Fig. 2 shows the conserved charged residues near the redox-active center of proteins with the thioredoxin fold. Despite a low overall sequence homology, the charges of the side chains corresponding to Glu24 and Lys58 of E. coli DsbA are invariant in the known DsbA sequences and are also conserved in thioredoxins (with very few exceptions, e.g.human thioredoxin, which lacks a corresponding lysine) and PDIs. To study the influence of the Glu24/Lys58 salt bridge on the physicochemical properties of DsbA from E. coli, we constructed the DsbA variants E24Q, K58M, and E24Q/K58M. In contrast to thioredoxin, a second acidic residue, Glu37, is located close to the Lys58 side chain in the structure of E. coli DsbA (Fig. 1). An acidic residue corresponding to Glu37 of E. coliDsbA is present in 6 of the 10 known DsbA sequences (Fig. 2). In the x-ray structure of oxidizedE. coli DsbA, Glu37 is even closer to the Lys58 side chain than Glu24 (the nearest carboxylate oxygen of Glu37 is 3.4 Å apart from the ε-amino group of Lys58 compared with 4.0 Å in the case of Glu24). We recently characterized the physicochemical properties of the DsbA variant E37Q, which are similar to those of DsbA wild type (20Hennecke J. Spleiss C. Glockshuber R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 189-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To further analyze the function of Glu37 in the context of the neighboring residues Glu24 and Lys58, we now investigated the properties of the double variant E37Q/K58M, the triple variant E24Q/E37Q/K58M, and the quadruple variant E24Q/E37Q/E38Q/K58M, which lacks all negatively charged residues less than 13 Å apart from the sulfur of Cys30. Oligonucleotides were purchased from MWG-Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany), and restriction enzymes were obtained from Boehringer (Mannheim, Germany) or New England Biolabs (Schwalbach, Germany). The plasmid pTHZ11 and E. coli THZ2 were kindly provided by T. Zander (University Regensburg, Germany). Recombinant hirudin was a gift from Hoechst AG (Frankfurt/Main, Germany). RNase A was purchased from Boehringer or Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). DE52 and CM52 cellulose were from Whatman (Maidstone, United Kingdom), and PD-10 Sephadex columns were from Pharmacia (Freiburg, Germany). Tryptone and yeast extract were from Difco, guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) was from ICN (Meckenheim, Germany), and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was from AGS (Heidelberg, Germany). 1,4-Dithio-dl-threitol (DTT), reduced glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), dithionitrobenzoic acid, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal), and polymyxin B sulfate were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Deisenhofen, Germany). All other chemicals were of analytical grade. The plasmid pDSBA2 was derived from plasmid pTHZ11 by deletion of the rop gene after digestion with NspI and religation. pDSBA2 contains the dsbA wild type gene under the control of thetrc promotor, the f1 and colE1origins, the gene coding for ampicillin resistance, and thelacI q gene. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with single-stranded, uridylated DNA from pDSBA2 according to Kunkel et al. (43Kunkel T.A. Robert J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar) using the Muta-Gene phagemid kit from Bio-Rad (Glattbrugg, Switzerland). The following oligonucleotides were used for mutagenesis (S corresponds to C or G): E24Q, 5′-GAAGAAAGAGAAAAACTGCAGCACTTGCGGCGC-3′; E37Q/E38Q, 5′-CATTATCAGAAATATGCAGGACCTSTTSGAATTGATAGCAGTGCGGGCAG-3′; K58M, 5′-CCCATGAAGTTCACGTGATACATAGTCATCTTTACGCCTTCCG-3′. Mutations were identified by restriction analysis and verified by dideoxy sequencing using the Thermo Sequenase™ sequencing kit from Amersham (Zürich, Switzerland). Cells ofE. coli THZ2 (dsbA::kan,recA::cam,λmalF-lacZ102) 2T. Zander, unpublished data.were transformed with pDSBA2 harboring the respective dsbAmutations. 4.5-liter cultures were grown in 2 × YT medium supplemented with 100 mg/liter ampicillin and 50 mg/liter kanamycin at 30 °C. Production of DsbA was induced with 1 mm IPTG at an optical density at 546 nm (A546) of 1.0, and the cells were grown for another 6 h (finalA546 = 3–3.5). The cells were harvested by centrifugation and suspended in 150 ml of buffer (10 mmMOPS/NaOH, pH 7.0, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mg/ml polymyxin B sulfate). After gentle stirring on ice for 2 h and centrifugation (35,000 × g for 30 min), the supernatant (periplasmic extract) was dialyzed against 10 mm MOPS/NaOH, pH 7.0, or, in case of the variants E24Q/E37Q and E24Q/E37Q/E38Q/K58M, against 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.6. The extracts were applied to a DE52 cellulose column (40 ml). Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient (500 ml) from 0 to 250 mm NaCl in the same buffers. Fractions containing DsbA were pooled, dialyzed against 10 mm acetic acid/NaOH, pH 4.5, and applied to a CM52 cellulose column (40 ml). Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient (500 ml) of 0–200 mm NaCl or 0–500 mm NaCl (in case of the variants E24Q/E37Q and E24Q/E37Q/E38Q/K58M). Fractions containing DsbA were pooled, dialyzed against distilled water, and stored at −20 °C. The yield of pure DsbA was 10–15 mg/liter·A546. The molecular mass of each DsbA variant was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry (accuracy ±2). The amino acid replacements E24Q, E37Q, and E38Q were also confirmed by N-terminal sequencing of residues 1–40. All DsbA variants were completely oxidized after purification, since no free thiols were detectable by Ellman's assay (44Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21624) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by absorbance (A280, 1 mg/ml, 1 cm = 1.05). dsbAmutations were tested for complementation of E. coli THZ2 cells (dsbA −) with respect to motility (45Dailey F.E. Berg H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1043-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and formation of white colonies on agar plates containing X-gal (15Bardwell J.C.A.

Cell. 1995; 83: 947-955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The ability to swarm was tested at 37 °C on 0.3% LB-agar plates containing 100 mg/liter ampicillin and 50 mg/liter kanamycin. β-Galactosidase activity was tested at 37 °C on LB-agar plates containing 0.4% maltose, 0.004% X-gal, 100 mg/liter ampicillin, and 50 mg/liter kanamycin. Spectroscopic measurements were performed with a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer, a Varian Cary3E spectrophotometer, and a Jasco J-710 spectropolarimeter. A temperature of 25 °C was applied for all measurements, and buffer solutions were filtered before use (0.2-μm pore size). Far-UV and near-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectra of oxidized and reduced DsbA were recorded as described elsewhere (20Hennecke J. Spleiss C. Glockshuber R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 189-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 23Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Unfolding/refolding experiments were essentially performed as described by Henneckeet al. (20Hennecke J. Spleiss C. Glockshuber R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 189-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The exact GdmCl concentrations were determined from the refractive index of the solutions according to Nozaki (46Nozaki Y. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 26: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). The original data of the transitions were analyzed according to the two-state model of folding using the six-parameter fit according to Santoro and Bolen (47Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar). For determination of the equilibrium constants between DsbA and glutathione-oxidized DsbA (1 μm) was incubated with GSSG (100 μm) and different concentrations of GSH (0–900 μm) in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA under nitrogen atmosphere for 16 h at 25 °C. The equilibrium redox state of DsbA was measured by its fluorescence at 330 nm (excitation at 280 nm; Ref. 23Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The equilibrium constant between DsbA and glutathione (Keq) was calculated by fitting the data according to Equation 1, where R is the fraction of reduced DsbA at equilibrium.R=([GSH]2/[GSSG])/(Keq+[GSH]2/[GSSG])Equation 1 The pH-dependent ionization of the Cys30 thiol was followed by the specific absorbance of the thiolate anion at 240 nm (18Nelson J.W. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5974-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 48Benesch R.E. Benesch R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1955; 77: 5877-5881Crossref Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 49Polgar L. FEBS Lett. 1974; 38: 187-190Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As a control, the pH-dependent absorbance of the oxidized form of each DsbA variant was recorded. To avoid precipitation artifacts and to minimize buffer absorbance, a buffer system consisting of 10 mm K2HPO4, 10 mm boric acid, 10 mm sodium succinate, 1 mm EDTA, and 200 mm KCl (containing 100 μm β-mercaptoethanol for the reduced proteins) was used. The pH (initial value, 8.5) was lowered to 2.2 by stepwise addition of aliquots of 0.1 m HCl, and the absorbance at 240 and 280 nm was recorded and corrected for the volume increase. Samples had an average initial protein concentration of 25 μm. The pH dependence of the thiolate-specific absorbance signal (S = (A240/A280)reduced/(A240/A280)oxidized) was fitted according to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation,S=SAH+(SA­−SAH)/(1+10pKa−pH),Equation 2 in which SAH is the corrected signal of the fully protonated and SA− is that of the fully deprotonated form. Evaluation of the pKaof Cys30 of DsbA yielded reliable results between pH 7.8 and 2.2, and further acidification resulted in denaturation of DsbA. Deviations above pH 7.8 may have resulted from increasing deprotonation of tyrosine residues. Reduced, unfolded RNase A and hirudin (A280, 1 mg/ml, 1 cm = 0.56 and 0.37, respectively) were prepared as described previously (24Wunderlich M. Otto A. Seckler R. Glockshuber R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12251-12256Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The quantitative reduction of the proteins was verified by Ellman's assay (44Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21624) Google Scholar). Oxidation of RNase A and hirudin by DsbA was analyzed fluorometrically at 25 °C with an SX-17MV stopped-flow reaction analyzer (Applied Photophysics) using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm and emission wavelengths ≥320 nm. Pseudo-first-order conditions were applied using 1 μm oxidized DsbA and 200 μm free thiols of the respective substrate protein or DTT. Buffer conditions were 100 mm formic acid/NaOH, pH 3.0, 100 mm formic acid/NaOH, pH 4.0, 100 mmacetic acid/NaOH pH 5.0, 100 mm MES/NaOH, pH 6.0, 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm Bicine/NaOH, pH 9.0, and 100 mmglycine/HCl, pH 10.0. All buffers contained 1 mm EDTA and were degassed and flushed with nitrogen before use. Polypeptide specificity is defined as the ratio between the apparent second-order rate constant of the oxidation of the respective substrate protein and the apparent second-order rate constant of the oxidation of DTT. We constructed the plasmid pDSBA2, which contains the dsbA wild type gene under control of the IPTG-inducible trc promotor, thelacI q gene, and the phage f1 origin (see “Experimental Procedures”). Thus, the plasmid combines features necessary for in vivo complementation, efficient overexpression of dsbA, and production of single-stranded DNA for site-directed mutagenesis (43Kunkel T.A. Robert J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). The following DsbA variants were generated: E24Q, K58M, E24Q/K58M, E24Q/E37Q, E37Q/K58M, E24Q/E37Q/K58M, and E24Q/E37Q/E38Q/K58M. All variants could be overproduced in the dsbA-deficient E. coli strain THZ2 (see below) to approximately the same extent as the wild type protein. They were purified to homogeneity by conventional chromatographic techniques in the absence of reducing agents and were all obtained in the oxidized form with yields of about 50 mg/liter bacterial culture. We used the E. coli strain THZ2 to characterize the in vivo function of the DsbA variants. This strain has aTn10::kan insertion in the chromosomaldsbA gene and possesses a gene coding for a MalF-β-galactosidase fusion protein (15Bardwell J.C.A. McGovern K. Beckwith J. Cell. 1991; 67: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 19Grauschopf U. Winther J.R. Korber P. Zander T. Dallinger P. Bardwell J.C.A.

A. 1993; 90: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The following criteria were used to determine the ability of the DsbA variants to complement the dsbA − phenotype of THZ2 after transformation with the respective dsbA expression plasmids: (i) restoration of motility on agar plates containing 0.3% agar, since THZ2 is immotile due to the lack of disulfide bonds in the P-ring protein of the flagellar motor (45Dailey F.E. Berg H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1043-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), and (ii) generation of a Lac− phenotype due to oxidative inactivation of periplasmic β-galactosidase by functional DsbA (15Bardwell J.C.A. McGovern K. Beckwith J. Cell. 1991; 67: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 19Grauschopf U. Winther J.R. Korber P. Zander T. Dallinger P. Bardwell J.C.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 947-955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), which results in white colonies on agar plates containing X-gal. Even in the absence of IPTG, all DsbA variants yielded a DsbA+phenotype of transformed THZ2 cells, which was indistinguishable from the phenotype of cells harboring the expression plasmid for wild type DsbA. Like for DsbA wild type (23Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), a 3-fold increase in tryptophan fluorescence was observed for the variants E24Q, K58M, E24Q/K58M, and E37Q/K58M when the active-site disulfide bond was reduced. However, all variants in which two or three negative charges had been exchanged (E24Q/E37Q, E24Q/E37Q/K58M, and E24Q/E37Q/E38Q/K58M) exhibited an approximately 2-fold higher fluorescence of the oxidized form compared with oxidized wild type. Therefore, their fluorescence increased only about 1.5-fold upon reduction. This difference was still sufficient to determine their thermodynamic stabilities and redox equilibria with glutathione by fluorescence spectroscopy (see below). The emission maxima of all oxidized and reduced variants were identical to those of wild type DsbA (data not shown). Far-UV and near-UV CD spectra were recorded to detect possible conformational changes in the DsbA variants. The spectra of the oxidized and reduced variants were identical to those of oxidized and reduced wild type (data not shown). Thus, the native tertiary structure of oxidized and reduced DsbA was essentially not affected in any of the variants. The free energies of stabilization of the oxidized and reduced forms of the variants were measured fluorometrically by GdmCl-induced equilibrium transitions assuming a two-state model of folding (Fig. 3; Table I). All transitions were fully reversible, with cooperativities of 20–27 kJ/mol·m for the oxidized variants and 22–27 kJ/mol·m for the reduced variants.

https://openalex.org/W2044708419,"Amongst the human astrocytic tumours, the commonest of primary brain tumours, the clinical outcome of astrocytoma (AS) is significantly better than anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Often, low grade tumours can progress to or recur with a more malignant phenotype. Recent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) reports suspect the involvement of a tumour suppressor gene, different from p53, in the 17p13.3 region of the human chromosome. However, the effect of LOH of 17p13.3 region on tumour histology at presentation and prognosis is as yet undefined. As a first step to define the role of this putative oncogene in astrocytic tumour progression, we correlated the LOH of a locus, D17S379, in 17p13.3 region and the p53 locus in 17p13.1 region with the histopathology of astrocytic tumours by PCR based microsatellite and restriction fragment length polymorphism of DNA extracted from microdissected paraffin sections of 45 astrocytic tumours of different histopathological grades. LOH of D17S379 was significantly associated (P=0.02) with AA and GBM (high grade malignancy), while no such preferential association was found with LOH of p53. There were no mutations in the exons 5 to 9 of p53 gene in the five tumours with LOH of D17S379 but not of p53 region. In a case of AA with a heterogenous microscopic appearance, heterozygosity of D17S379 was lost only in the area with a more malignant histology while both areas had no LOH or mutation of p53. A locus at the 17p13.3 region, independent of the p53 locus, is involved in a large subset of astrocytic tumours during transformation into a more malignant phenotype, and thus may be a link in the chain of genetic events occurring in astrocytic tumour progression."
https://openalex.org/W2035872189,"The bHLHZip protein Max interacts with both the Myc and Mad family proteins forming heterodimers which specifically bind certain E-box DNA recognition sequences, thereby regulating transcription. Whereas Myc proteins actively promote cell proliferation, Mad complexes have the opposite function. Although the main regulation of this network seems to be the control of myc- and mad family gene expression, regulation at the level of DNA-binding and transactivation may also be in operation. Few studies on the DNA-binding activity of native Myc : Max or Max : Mad complexes have been reported mainly due to technical difficulties. To overcome these problems we have developed a specific and sensitive solid phase DNA-binding assay based on partial purification of native Myc, Max and Mad1 complexes by immunological methods. Using this technique we report that the DNA-binding activity of c-Myc-containing complexes is reduced during induced differentiation of U-937 monoblasts and F9 embryonic teratocarcinoma cells. In contrast, the DNA-binding of Mad1-containing complexes increases during monocytic differentiation. In general, the DNA-binding activity of c-Myc and Mad1 correlate with their expression. However, our studies of early kinetics of TPA-induced differentiation of U-937 cells as well as of late events during F9 differentiation suggest that post-translational regulation of Myc and Max DNA-binding may also occur. The solid phase DNA-binding assay may thus provide a tool to study the regulation of DNA-binding in more detail."
https://openalex.org/W2079036515,"The cAMP pathway plays a central role in the response to hormonal signals for cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. In IPC-81 leukaemia cells, activation of the cAMP pathway by prostaglandin E1 treatment, or other cAMP-elevating agents, induces apoptosis within 4 – 6 h. Inhibition of mRNA or protein synthesis during the first 2 h of cAMP induction protects cells from apoptosis, suggesting a requirement for early gene expression. cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylates a class of nuclear factors and thereby regulates the transcription of a specific set of genes. Here we show that CREM (cAMP Responsive Element Modulator) expression is induced rapidly upon prostaglandin E1 treatment of IPC-81 cells. The induced transcripts correspond to the early product ICER (Inducible cAMP Early Repressor). ICER expression remains elevated until the burst of cell death. Protein synthesis inhibitors which prevent cAMP-induced apoptosis also block de novo ICER synthesis. Transfected IPC-81 cell lines, constitutively expressing high level of ICER are resistant to cAMP-induced cell death. In these transfected cells, cAMP fails to upregulate the ICER transcripts demonstrating that ICER exerts strongly its repressor function on CRE-containing genes. That an early expression of ICER blocks apoptosis, suggests that gene repression by endogenous ICER in IPC-81 is unsufficient or occurs too late to protect cells against death. ICER transfected cells rescued from cAMP-induced apoptosis are growth arrested. It shows for the first time that CREM activation directly participates to the decision of the cell to die. ICER, by sequentially repressing distinct sets of CRE-containing genes could modulate cell fate."
https://openalex.org/W2046570296,"We have previously shown that the human ETS1 protein (p51-ETS1), when ectopically expressed in colon cancer cell lines, is able to reduce its tumorigenicity without affecting its growth properties. To understand the mechanism of tumor reduction, we have expressed two different forms of ETS1 in colon cancer cell lines. Data presented in this paper indicate that the naturally occurring spliced variant protein, p42-ETS1, lacking the region encoded by ETS1 exon VII, represses the tumorigenicity, while p51-ETS1 reduces the tumorigenicity. Repression of tumorigenicity mediated by p42-ETS1 appears to be caused by its ability to induce apoptosis in epithelial cancer cells. This work can have profound medical significance in that it may open up new insights into the potential role of the p42-ETS1 in the induction of apoptosis in epithelial cell cancers and may provide a rationale for its use for potential gene therapy experiments to initiate cell death in cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2319234258,"The Pebpb2/Cbfb gene encodes the non-DNA binding beta subunit of the heterodimeric transcription factor, PEBP2/CBF, and has been implicated in a subtype of human acute myeloid leukemia, as well as being indispensable for the development of definitive hematopoiesis in the murine fetal liver. By examining a subcellular localization of the PEBP2beta/CBFbeta protein in tissue culture cells, we could reveal an additional aspect of the protein other than to be a subunit of a transcription factor. Immunoblot and immunocytochemical staining showed that PEBP2beta/CBFbeta was mostly present in the cytoplasm. This PEBP2beta/CBFbeta was free from its DNA-binding partner, the alpha subunit of PEBP2/CBF, as judged by the electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Furthermore, a significant amount of PEBP2beta/CBFbeta was retained in the cytoskeleton preparation after detergent extraction of the cells and was found by double immunofluorescence to colocalize with the F-actin on stress fibers and the vinculin in membrane processes. Thus, the present study extends PEBP2beta/CBFbeta to be a cytoskeleton-affinitive as well as nuclear protein. The implications of these results are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2320721906,"The transcription factors p53 and E2F-1 play important roles in the control of cell cycle progression. In transient transfection experiments, expression of E2F-1, other E2F family members, or p53 squelched transcription from cotransfected plasmids in a dose-dependent manner. Although the proteasome inhibitors MG-132 and lactacystin markedly increased the level of expression of E2F-1 and p53, these inhibitors completely alleviated squelching by both proteins. Several observations indicate MG-132 alleviates squelching by influencing the conformation of newly synthesized p53 and E2F-1: MG-132 increased the fraction of wild type p53 bound by a monoclonal antibody which preferentially recognizes mutant conformers of p53, increased binding of hsp70 to p53 and inhibited nuclear accumulation of both p53 and E2F-1, but not the pocket protein p107. The protease inhibitors ALLN and ALLM did not influence expression of E2F-1 or p53, nor did they alleviate squelching by either transcription factor. Because MG-132 and lactacycstin are highly specific inhibitors of the proteasome protease, our results suggest that the proteasome influences post-translational processes involved in proper folding and cytoplasmic clearing of E2F-1 and p53."

In contrast to FGFR2-WT, receptors with C-terminal truncations induced ligand-independent transformation of NIH3T3 cells and transfectants expressing these mutant receptors efficiently formed colonies in semisolid medium. Introduction of point mutations (Y to F) into the C-terminus of FGFR2 at positions 813, 784 or 780 revealed that these mutant receptors also displayed activities similar to that of C-terminally truncated receptors. C-terminally altered FGF receptors did not show an increase in the basal level of receptor phosphorylation compared to that of FGFR2-WT suggesting that elevated receptor phosphorylation does not underlie the transforming activity of these receptors. Interestingly, expression of transforming FGFR2 derivatives, unlike H-Ras transformed cells, did not result in the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), p42/ERK2 and p44/ERK1, indicating that this pathway is not constitutively active in FGFR2-transformed cells. Finally, we report the overexpression of FGFR2 mRNA and protein in several human tumor cell lines suggesting activation of the receptor in these tumors."

https://openalex.org/W2324940902,"Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were used to analyse the pattern of E2F transcription factor complexes containing pRB and related `pocket' proteins associated with changes in growth of monkey CV-1 cells. Little change was noted in pRB/E2F complexes following growth arrest or serum stimulation. Serum starvation induced the formation of a novel slowly-migrating p130/E2F complex, termed C7, which was comparable to one reported previously in terminally differentiated C2C12 mouse cells (Corbeil et al., 1995, Oncogene 11, 909 – 920) and thought to contain one or more additional unidentified proteins. After serum stimulation, C7 complex disappeared in S-phase but returned during mitosis. A major E2F complex containing p107 appeared during S-phase but was undetectable at other times. It appeared likely that regulation of pRB, p107 and p130 occurs by several mechanisms. First, phosphorylation has previously been proposed to be involved. All pRB-related proteins were found to be highly phosphorylated during S-phase when E2F activity was highest, and hypophosphorylated in arrested cells when E2F activity was low. Second, the absolute levels of some members of the RB family varied during the cell cycle. Levels of pRB protein and pRB/E2F complexes changed little; however, the amounts of both p107/E2F and p130/E2F complexes varied according to the overall levels of p107 and p130 proteins. Formation of the novel C7 complex in serum arrested cells suggested a third regulatory mechanism mediated by interactions with additional proteins. Our studies indicated that binding of such proteins with p130/E2F occurred via a site in the `pocket' similar to that utilized by adenovirus E1A proteins. Such proteins could function as additional regulators of E2F-driven transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2162751272,"Comparisons of the tertiary structures of the GDP-bound and guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) (GTPγS)-bound forms of the α subunit of transducin (αT) indicate that there are three regions that undergo changes in conformation upon αT activation. Two of these regions, Switch I and Switch II, were originally identified in Ras, while Switch III appears to be unique to trimeric GTP-binding proteins (G proteins). We find that replacement of the Switch III region (aspartic acid 227 through asparagine 237) with a single alanine residue yields an αT subunit that fully binds and hydrolyzes GTP but no longer stimulates the activity of the cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase (PDE), the physiological target for transducin. We also show that changing glutamic acid 232 of αT to a leucine (E232L) had no effect on rhodopsin-stimulated GTP-GDP exchange nor on the GTP hydrolytic activity of αT. However, the GTPγS-bound form of the αTE232L mutant was unable to stimulate the activity of the cyclic GMP PDE. The lack of stimulation was not due to an inability of the αTE232L mutant to bind to the target. Taken together, these results indicate that glutamic acid 232 mediates a conformational coupling between Switch II and Switch III, which is essential for converting GTP-dependent G protein-target interactions into a stimulation of target/effector activity.

GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) serve as molecular switches in a wide variety of biological response systems. Two large families, the Ras-related small G proteins and the trimeric G proteins, have received a great deal of attention because of their central role in signal transduction. The trimeric G proteins serve as intermediate signal transducers for seven-transmembrane-spanning (also called heptahelical or serpentine) receptors that are involved in responses to sensory, hormonal and neurotransmitter signals (1Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4993-4996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4728) Google Scholar). These G proteins consist of two functional units, the guanine nucleotide-binding α subunit (Gα) and the βγ complex (Gβγ). The molecular switch capability of a trimeric G protein is mediated through the Gα subunit, which cycles between the GDP-bound (inactive) and GTP-bound (active) states. A signal received from a receptor promotes the activation of a trimeric G protein by catalyzing the exchange of GTP for GDP on Gα. This results in the dissociation of the GTP-bound Gα from the Gβγ complex, thereby enabling these subunits to regulate the activities of downstream target/effectors. GTP hydrolysis on the Gα subunit promotes its re-association with Gβγ, thus terminating the signal. The vertebrate phototransduction system represents one of the best characterized G protein-coupled signaling cascades. In this system, the photoreceptor rhodopsin activates a trimeric G protein, transducin, generating a GTP-bound α subunit (αT-GTP), which stimulates the target/effector enzyme, the cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase (PDE). 1The abbreviations used are: PDE, phosphodiesterase; ROS, rod outer segment(s); DTT, dithiothreitol; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O(thiotriphosphate). The three-dimensional structures for αT in different guanine nucleotide-bound states, and more recently for the αT-βγTholotransducin complex, have been solved by x-ray crystallography (3Noel J.P.

This structural information now provides the foundation for understanding the molecular basis of many aspects of G protein-mediated signaling. Three distinct regions on trimeric G protein α subunits have been shown to undergo conformational changes in response to GTP/GDP exchange (4Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 5Sondek J. Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Two of these regions, designated Switch I (Ser173to Thr183 in αT) and Switch II (Phe195 to Thr215), are structurally analogous to the two conformationally-sensitive regions found in Ras (10Pai E.F. Kabsch W. Krengel U. Holmes K.C. John J. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1989; 341: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar) and EF-Tu (11Jurnak F. Science. 1985; 230: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), whereas the third region, designated Switch III (Arg227 to Arg238 in αT), is unique to the α subunits of trimeric G proteins. The various available x-ray crystallographic structures of G proteins show that the conformational changes in Switch I and II are the direct result of GTP binding to residues within these regions. Specifically, the structural changes in Switch I are induced by the interaction of the γ-phosphate of GTP with Thr177, while the changes in Switch II result from a hydrogen bond between Gly199 and the γ-phosphate (4Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). However, Switch III does not directly contact GTP. Rather, it was shown to respond to Switch II through a series of polar interactions that were mediated and/or promoted by GTP-induced conformational changes in Switch II (4Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). At present, the functional role of the Switch III domain or the importance of its conformational coupling to Switch II is not known. The fact that the residues proposed to be responsible for this conformational coupling are conserved in all trimeric G protein α subunits (4Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 7Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R.

In the present work, we have examined the importance of Switch III in G protein function and find that a conserved glutamic acid residue within the Switch III domain of αT is essential for the regulation of target/effector activity. Purification of Retinal Proteins—Rod outer segments (ROS) were prepared as described previously (12Gierschik P. Simons C. Woodward C. Somers R. Spiegel A.

Chem. 1989; 264: 16679-16688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transducin and the cyclic GMP PDE were purified by exposing ROS to room light and repeated washings with 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 100 mm NaCl (isotonic buffer) and then with 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 6 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT (hypotonic buffer). The cyclic GMP PDE is released into the hypotonic wash and is further purified by hydroxyapatite chromatography (13Phillips W.J. Trukawinski S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16679-16688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transducin is released from ROS by washing with hypotonic buffer in the presence of 0.1 mm GTP or 0.1 mm GTPγS. The αT and βγTsubunit complexes are then resolved by Blue Sepharose chromatography (14Pines M. Gierschik P. Milligan G. Klee W. Spiegel A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4095-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Dark-adapted ROS membranes containing hydroxyapatite-purified cyclic GMP PDE were assayed for cyclic GMP hydrolysis by measuring proton release, as originally described by Yee and Liebman (15Yee R. Liebman P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8902-8909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assays are performed at room temperature in a buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 60 mm KCl, 30 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 5 mm MgCl2, together with the protein components described in the legend to Fig. 3. The assays were initiated by the addition of cyclic GMP (5 mm), with the pH being recorded for 1–2 min at one determination/s. The PDE activity (nanomole/s) was calculated as the ratio of the slope of the pH change (millivolts) and the buffering capacity of the medium (millivolt/nmol) (16Cerione R.A. Kroll S. Rajaram R. Unson C. Goldsmith P. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9345-9352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The coding region of the bovine αT was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using primers that create a 5′-endNdeI site and a 3′-end BamHI site. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with NdeI andBamHI and ligated into pET15b (Novagen). The resultant vector was digested with NcoI and PstI to release the coding region of αT with its 5′-end fused in-frame to the hexa-His tag present in the vector pET15b. This released fragment was then blunt-ended using T4 DNA polymerase and ligated into pVL1393. To generate the αTΔI2 deletion mutant (Asp227 through Asn237 replaced by a single Ala), and the αTE232L point mutant (Glu232replaced by Leu), we employed a single-stranded DNA-based mutagenesis strategy (17Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour K.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 367-382Crossref Scopus (4560) Google Scholar), using synthetic oligonucleotide primers containing the indicated deletion or point mutation (αTΔI2: 5′-CAGGCTCTCGTGCATTCGAGCGTAGGCGCTCAG-3′; and αTE232L: 5′-CACTTCGTCCTCGAGCACCAGC-3′). The pVL1393 vector carrying either the wild type, αTΔI2, or αTE232L gene was introduced into Sf9 insect cells using the Baculogold transfection kit (PharMingen). The recombinant extracellular virus (rECV) was purified by a limiting dilution procedure (18Goswami B.B. Glazer R.I. BioTechniques. 1991; 5: 626-630Google Scholar). For production of the recombinant proteins, Sf9 insect cells were infected at 80% confluence with the purified rECVs at a multiplicity of infection of 5 and harvested typically 60 h post-infection. The His-tagged αT proteins were purified through Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography following a protocol provided by Qiagen. The purified proteins were finally dialyzed against HMDN buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT) containing 40% of glycerol and stored at −20 °C. The original finding that a third region on heterotrimeric G protein α subunits undergoes structural changes upon GTP-GDP exchange (i.e. in addition to the Switch I and Switch II regions originally identified in Ras and EF-Tu (10Pai E.F. Kabsch W. Krengel U. Holmes K.C. John J. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1989; 341: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 11Jurnak F. Science. 1985; 230: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar)) suggests that it may play a critical role in a GTP-dependent G protein function. To obtain experimental support for this suggestion, we examined the properties of an αT deletion mutant in which the entire Switch III domain (residues Asp227 through Asn237) was replaced by a single alanine residue. The deletion mutant, designated αTΔI2, was expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells as a hexahistidine (His)-tagged fusion protein and purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography. This results in a rapid and highly effective purification of the recombinant αTsubunit, as shown in Fig. 1. The first three lanes in A show the Coomassie Blue-stained profiles for the αT subunit purified from bovine retina, the recombinant wild type His-tagged αT purified from Sf9 cells (which has a slightly slower mobility on SDS gels because of the His-tag), and the His-tagged αTΔI2 mutant purified from Sf9 cells. B shows the corresponding Western blots that were obtained using a specific antibody raised against the carboxyl-terminal 10 amino acids of αT (16Cerione R.A. Kroll S. Rajaram R. Unson C. Goldsmith P. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9345-9352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We first examined whether the deletion of the Switch III domain from αT affected rhodopsin- and βγT-promoted [35S]GTPγS/GDP exchange. Fig. 2 A shows that as has been documented previously (19Wessling-Resnick M. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3697-3705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Wessling-Resnick M. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12444-12447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), when αT purified from bovine retina was added to urea-stripped ROS containing light-activated rhodopsin, there was a marked increase in [35S]GTPγS binding that was strongly stimulated by the addition of purified retinal βγT. Virtually identical results were obtained with the Sf9-expressed, His-tagged wild type αT and the His-tagged αTΔI2 deletion mutant. Likewise, the αTΔI2 mutant was able to fully hydrolyze [γ-32P]GTP (Fig. 2 B). Taken together, the results presented in Fig. 2, A andB, indicated that the deletion of the Switch III domain did not impair the ability of αT to interact with rhodopsin nor with the βγT subunit complex and that removal of Switch III did not interfere with the GTP-binding/GTP hydrolytic cycle of the G protein. We then examined the ability of the αTΔI2mutant to functionally couple to the cyclic GMP PDE, by first loading the αTΔI2 mutant with GTPγS (by incubation with ROS and bovine retinal βγT) and then assaying cyclic GMP PDE activity, by measuring the H+ release that accompanies cyclic GMP hydrolysis. The results presented in Fig. 3 A illustrate that the bovine retinal αT subunit and the recombinant wild type αT were essentially equivalent in their abilities to stimulate cyclic GMP hydrolysis. However, the αTΔI2 deletion mutant was unable to stimulate PDE activity (relative to the basal activity measured in the absence of added αT). Thus, these results suggested that the integrity of the Switch III domain was essential for αT-mediated regulation of its target/effector enzyme. An interesting possibility that was originally proposed following an examination of the x-ray crystallographic structure of the αT·GTPγS complex (3Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 366: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar) was that the acidic amino acid residues, Asp233, Asp234, and Glu235 formed a potential binding site for a basic stretch of amino acids on the γPDE subunit. If this were the case, it would then explain why the deletion of the Switch III domain yields an αT subunit that is unable to stimulate effector activity. However, we have expressed and purified an αTmutant from Sf9 cells in which the three acidic amino acids were replaced by alanine residues and found that this triple mutant was fully active, not only in its ability to bind and hydrolyze GTP, but also in its ability to stimulate cyclic GMP PDE activity (data not shown). This then led us to examine another possibility, namely that a conserved glutamic acid residue in the Switch III region, Glu232, is responsible for mediating the conformational communication between the Switch II and Switch III domains (4Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). To test this, we generated a mutant of αT in which a leucine residue was substituted for Glu232 (αTE232L) and expressed it in S. frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells as a hexahistidine (His)-tagged protein (see lane 4 in Fig. 1,A and B). Like the αTΔI2 deletion mutant, we found that the αTE232L mutant was able to functionally couple to rhodopsin and/or βγT, as read-out by its ability to undergo [35S]GTPγS/GDP exchange and GTP hydrolysis in a rhodopsin- and βγT-dependent manner (Fig. 2, Aand B). Moreover, just as was the case for the Switch III deletion mutant, the αTE232L mutant was unable to stimulate target/effector (PDE) activity (Fig. 3 A), even when using amounts of the mutant that were in 10-fold excess relative to the retinal or recombinant wild type αT proteins (data not shown). Thus, the mutation of the single conserved Glu232 residue appeared to fully mimick the effects obtained upon the removal of the entire Switch III domain. We used the αTE232L mutant to further examine the importance of Switch II domain-Switch III domain coupling in the stimulation of target/effector activity. We found that the inability of the αTE232L mutant to stimulate PDE activity cannot be attributed to its inability to bind to its PDE target. This was determined through competition experiments. Fig. 3 B shows that like the GDP-bound wild type αT subunit (open bar in column 2), the GDP-bound form of the αTE232L mutant (open bars in columns 3 and 4) did not competitively inhibit the PDE stimulatory activity of the GTPγS-bound retinal αTsubunit (shown as the solid bar in column 1). This was as expected, since the GDP-bound form of αT has only a weak affinity for the γPDE subunit. However, the GTPγS-bound form of αTE232L showed a dose-dependent inhibition (hatched bars incolumns 3 and 4 in Fig. 3 B), thus indicating that the αTE232L mutant can bind to γPDE in a GTPγS-dependent manner. The fact that the GTPγS-bound wild type αT subunit did not competitively inhibit the stimulatory activity of the retinal GTPγS-bound αT (column 2, hatched bar, in Fig. 3 B) illustrates that the activated wild type αT subunit can fully substitute for the activated retinal αT. Moreover, these results demonstrate that the inhibitory effects are specific for the GTPγS-bound αTE232L mutant, such that the αTE232L molecule can act as a dominant-negative mutant. Thus, GTPγS can both bind and induce the appropriate conformational changes within the αTE232L mutant that enable it to specifically interact with the target/effector molecule. This is further indicated by the results of limited trypsin treatment (Fig. 4). It has been well documented that trypsin treatment of the retinal αT subunit gives rise to defined proteolytic patterns that are absolutely dependent on the guanine nucleotide-bound state of αT (21Fung B.K.K. Nash C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10503-10510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Bigay J. Deterre Ph Pfister C. Chabre M. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2907-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Trypsin treatment of the GDP-bound wild type αT yields two stable fragments, an ∼23-kDa fragment (shown in lane 2 under αTwt in Fig. 4) and an ∼9-kDa fragment (not shown), whereas trypsin treatment of the GTPγS-bound wild type αT yields a stable 32-kDa (precursor) fragment (lane 3 under αT wt in Fig. 4). Based on the information provided from the tertiary structures for the different nucleotide forms of αT (4Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 5Sondek J. Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), it is now clear that the protection afforded by GTPγS directly reflects a GTPγS-dependent conformational change that occurs within the Switch II domain and effectively moves the trypsin-sensitive Arg204 residue from a solvent-exposed environment to a less accessible position (by virtue of its interaction with Glu241). Thus, the protection against trypsin proteolysis afforded by GTPγS serves as a highly sensitive read-out for GTPγS-induced conformational changes within the Switch II domain and has frequently been used as a monitor for αT activation (23Hurley J.B. Simon M.I. Teplow D.B. Robishaw J.D. Gilman A.G. Science. 1984; 226: 860-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The results presented in Fig. 4 (lanes 2 and3 under αT E232L) show that GTPγS binding to the αTE232L mutant provides a similar protection against trypsin proteolysis, as observed with the wild type αT subunit. Therefore, the mutation of Glu232neither perturbs GTPγS binding nor the GTPγS-induced conformational alteration of Switch II. However, mutation of Glu232, while preserving the GTP-dependent binding of the αT subunit to the cyclic GMP PDE, completely uncouples this binding from target/effector stimulation. The location of Glu232 in the loop connecting the β4 strand and α3 helix of αTplaces it in a prime position to couple conformational transitions between Switch II and Switch III. In particular, x-ray crystallographic analysis shows that upon GTPγS binding, Glu232 is engaged in direct interactions with Arg201 and Arg204of Switch II and in a water-mediated interaction with Gly199 of Switch II (5Sondek J. Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Given our findings, we conclude that the conformational coupling between Switch II and Switch III is responsible for converting a primary binding interaction between activated αT and its target (γPDE), perhaps involving residues in Switch II (24Faurobert E. Otto-Bruc A. Chardin P. Chabre M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4191-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) or in other regions of αT (25Cunnick J. Twamley C. Udovichenko I. Gonzalez K. Takemoto D.J.

Artemyev N.O. Hamm H.E. Science. 1992; 256: 1031-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Moreover, these results indicate that Glu232 plays an essential role in mediating this conformational coupling, thereby translating αT-target (PDE) interactions into a specific regulatory event. The fact that this glutamic acid residue is conserved in all trimeric Gα subunits further suggests that it plays a fundamental role in converting target binding into target/effector regulation in a wide variety of G protein-coupled signaling pathways.

https://openalex.org/W2328718173,"The p21CIP1/WAF1 protein is considered a downstream effector of tumor suppression by p53. We have previously demonstrated that p53 null keratinocytes have lower basal p21CIP1/WAF1 mRNA levels and that tumors derived from these cells following transduction with the v-rasHa oncogene grow faster than wildtype keratinocytes and rapidly progress to undifferentiated carcinomas (Cancer Res 54: 5584 – 5592, 1994). In this study, primary keratinocytes differing in p21CIP1/WAF1 gene dose were transduced with v-rasHa encoding retrovirus and grafted to nude mouse hosts to test whether the p53 null phenotype is mediated through p21CIP1/WAF1. Resulting tumors from all genotypes were well differentiated papillomas; focal carcinomas were observed in 43, 30 and 44% of papillomas derived from +/+, +/− and −/− keratinocytes, respectively. p21CIP1/WAF1 deficient keratinocytes expressing v-rasHa do not display the degree of increased growth observed in p53 deficient tumors in vivo or the decreased responsiveness to negative growth regulation by Ca2+ in vitro. These results suggest that p21CIP1/WAF1 does not regulate the differentiated phenotype or malignant progression of v-rasHa initiated keratinocytes and that additional functions of the p53 protein other than transcriptional regulation of the p21CIP1/WAF1 gene are required for p53 mediated tumor suppression."

Molecular analysis of growth factor regulation of cell growth in mammalian cells has led to the identification of a new class of molecules that are involved in controlling cell cycle transition. Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) 1The abbreviations used are: Cdk(s), cyclin-dependent kinase(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.1The abbreviations used are: Cdk(s), cyclin-dependent kinase(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. are key regulators of cell cycle progression (1Pines J. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 305-313PubMed Google Scholar, 2Pines J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1995; 66: 181-212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and their activities are positively regulated by their activating subunits, the cyclins. Cyclin molecules identified to date include cyclins A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. These molecules bind to Cdks with differential affinities and contribute to their enzymatic activation. Accumulating evidence indicates that the G1/S transition is regulated by D-type cyclins (D1, D2, D3) and cyclin E activating the Cdk4/Cdk6 and Cdk2, respectively (3Sherr C.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 187-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar, 4Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2576) Google Scholar), while cyclins A and B have been shown to play a role in the G2/M transition by activating Cdk1 (Cdc2) (5King R.W. Jackson P.K. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1994; 79: 563-571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 6Pines J. Hunter T. New Biol. 1990; 2: 389-401PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of Cdks is also negatively regulated by a family of proteins collectively designated as cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (7Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3200) Google Scholar, 8Hunter T. Pines J. Cell. 1994; 79: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2147) Google Scholar, 9Peter M.

Polyak K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). On the basis of structural features, these inhibitors can be divided into two subfamilies, namely the p16INK4a/p15INK4b/p18INK4c/p19INK4d, and the p21Cip1/p27Kip1/p57Kip2. The main targets for p16 and related proteins are Cdk4 and Cdk6, and p16 family members act by inhibiting complex formation between these Cdks and D-type cyclins (12Hall M. Bates S. Peters G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1581-1588PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, p21, p27, and p57 inhibit the function of multiple Cdk-cyclin complexes, including Cdk2, Cdk3, Cdk4, Cdk6, and Cdc2 without dissociating the Cdk-cyclin complex (13Harper J.W.

Bai C. Parker S. Zhang P. Baldini A. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 650-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the amino-terminal domains of p21, p27, and p57 have been shown to contain a conserved region that interacts with cyclin E-Cdk2, thereby inhibiting its activity (16Luo Y. Hurwitz J. Massague J. Nature. 1995; 375: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). In contrast, the COOH-terminal domains of p21, p27, and p57 do not exhibit any structural or functional similarity. Indeed, the COOH-terminal domain of p21, unlike its counterparts in p27 and p57, has been shown to contain a binding site for proliferating cell nuclear antigen, a major factor required for DNA synthesis during G2/M cell cycle progression (17Chen J. Jackson P.K. Kirschner M.W. Dutta A. Nature. 1995; 374: 386-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). In view of these observations, and lack of any data concerning the role of COOH-terminal region of p27 or p57, we sought to investigate the biochemical effect of different regions of p27 on activation of Cdc2 kinase activity. Our data provides evidence for a mechanism by which p27 may regulate Cdc2 kinase activity in vivo. Human p27, Np27, Cp27, p27del, and Cp27delcDNAs were made by PCR using the following oligonucleotide pairs; I-II, I-IV, II-III, I-V, and III-V, respectively, listed as follows: I, ATGAGAGCAGGATCCATGTCAAACGTGCGAGTGTCT; II, ATGAGAGCAGTCGACCGTTTGACGTCTTCTGAGGCC; III, ATGAGAGCAGGATCCGTGCCGGCGCAGGAGAGCCAG; IV, ATGAGAGCAGTCGACCGCCGGCACCTTGCAGGCACC; V, ATGAGAGCAGTCGACCTGCTCCACAGAACCGGCATTTGG. The PCR products were cloned into a bacterial expression vector (pQE9). Proteins were expressed in M15prep4 bacteria and purified under denaturing conditions as described earlier (18Mahadevan D. Yu J.C. Saldanha J.W. Thanki N. McPhie P. Uren A. LaRochelle W.J. Heidaran M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27595-27600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Antibodies except p21 (OP76, Oncogene Science, Cambridge, MA) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) (cyclin A, sc-596; cyclin B, sc-245; cyclin D1, sc-753; cyclin D2, sc-593; cyclin D3, sc-182; cyclin E, sc-481; Cdc2, sc-54; Cdk2, sc-163; Cdk4, sc-260; Cdk5, sc-173; Cdk6, sc-177; p27, sc-528 and sc-527). Recombinant human CDC2p34-cyclin B was obtained from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). Western blot analyses were performed as described previously (19Heidaran M.A. Fleming T.P. Bottaro D.P. Bell G.I. Di Fiore P.P. Aaronson S.A. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1265-1270PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro kinase assays were performed essentially as described previously (20Jakus J. Yeudall W.A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2369-2376PubMed Google Scholar) in 20-μl volume by using 1 unit of enzyme and 2.5 μm histone H1 (Boehringer Mannheim) at 30 °C for 30 min in the presence or absence of recombinant p27 constructs. Reactions were terminated by adding an equal volume of 2 × sample buffer. The reaction mixtures were electrophoretically separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried and autoradiographed. For enzyme kinetic studies, autoradiograms were scanned, and data were quantitated using QS30 software. To better understand the molecular mechanisms of cell cycle progression in murine fibroblasts, quiescent NIH3T3 cells were treated with 10% fetal calf serum for varying periods of time, and the levels of key cell cycle regulators were analyzed by Western blot analysis. The results, summarized in Fig. 1, demonstrate that expression levels of Cdk2 and Cdk-4 increased significantly around 4–6 h and remained high throughout the cell cycle. In parallel experiments cyclin E, cyclin D2, and cyclin D3 levels showed a similar increase, while the levels of Cdk5, Cdk6, and cyclin D1 stayed almost constant. Most notably the levels of cyclin A, cyclin B, and Cdc2 increased markedly at 12–14 h after serum stimulation. This coincided with increased cellular DNA content as detected by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (data not shown). In parallel, we also investigated changes in the level of the Cdk inhibitors, p21 and p27 (Fig. 2). Western blot analysis showed an increase in p21 levels starting at 6–8 h, which remained high thereafter (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, p27 levels showed a dramatic increase at 30 min poststimulation, followed by a gradual decrease to a minimal level at 12–14 h (Fig. 2,B and C). Surprisingly, the antibody generated to the COOH-terminal domain of p27 could detect not only the full-length p27, but also an additional protein of apparent molecular mass of around 22 kDa (Fig. 2 C), which could not be detected by the antibody generated to the NH2-terminal domain of p27 (Fig. 2 B). The steady state level of this form of p27 normalized for similar levels of full-length p27 reached its maximum levels at 22–24 h, around the same time the DNA content was the highest (data not shown). The specificity of the antibody to the COOH-terminal domain of p27 was determined by competition studies using excess peptide corresponding to amino acid residues 181–198 of p27 (Fig. 2 D). Together, the data indicate that first, a novel NH2-terminal truncated form of p27 is induced during cell cycle progression in NIH3T3 cells, and second, the appearance of this form of p27 coincides with increased DNA synthesis and expression of Cdc2, cyclin A, and cyclin B proteins.Figure 2Detection of p21 and p27 during cell cycle progression. NIH3T3 cells were treated as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Total cell lysates were electrophoretically separated on 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P. Filters were then immunoblotted with antibodies generated against p21 (A), the NH2-terminal domain of p27 (peptide antibody raised against amino acids 2–21 of human p27, B), or the COOH-terminal domain of p27 (peptide antibody raised against amino acids 181–198 of human p27, C). Full-length p27 is indicated byarrows, while variant forms of p27 are indicated byarrowheads. To verify the specificity of variant forms identified by anti-p27(C-19), the antibody was preincubated with excess antigenic peptide corresponding to amino acids 181–198 of human p27 (D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The members of the p21 family of Cdk inhibitors have a common amino-terminal region that inhibits the activity of Cdks (16Luo Y. Hurwitz J. Massague J. Nature. 1995; 375: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). In contrast, the carboxyl-terminal domain of this family of Cdk inhibitors has evolved to become structurally distinct. Structure function analysis has provided evidence that amino-terminal domains of p21, p27, and p57 have Cdk-inhibiting properties (16Luo Y. Hurwitz J. Massague J. Nature. 1995; 375: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). In contrast, the search for a common biological activity for the carboxyl-terminal domains for these molecules has not been successful. Although, accumulating evidence indicates that the carboxyl-terminal domain of p21 binds to proliferating cell nuclear antigen and inhibit its activity (16Luo Y. Hurwitz J. Massague J. Nature. 1995; 375: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar); as yet, no biological activity has been elucidated for the carboxyl-terminal domains of p27 and p57. In view of our finding indicating that the appearance of a variant form of p27 consisting of the carboxyl-terminal region correlated well with Cdc2 activity, we next sought to investigate a possible role for distinct structural domains of p27 in regulating Cdc2 activity in vitro. Accordingly, the carboxyl-terminal domain (Cp27, amino acids 101–198), amino-terminal domain (Np27, amino acids 1–100) and full-length p27 (amino acids 1–198) were bacterially expressed and purified (Fig. 3). The effects of purified recombinant p27 proteins on the activity of recombinant CDC2-cyclin B were examined by in vitro kinase assays using histone H1 as the substrate. As shown in Fig. 4 A, full-length p27 exhibited a potent inhibitory effect on histone H1 phosphorylation by CDC2. As predicted, Np27 had a similar effect (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, Cp27 unexpectedly stimulated the CDC2 kinase activity (Fig. 4 C). When CDC2 kinase activity was assayed in the presence of different substrate concentrations, similar results were obtained (Fig. 4 D). We observed a 5-fold induction in the maximal level of CDC2 kinase activity when incubated in the presence of Cp27. Together, these findings suggest that both p27 and Np27 contain the inhibitory region for CDC2 kinase activity, while the COOH-terminal region functions as a CDC2 activator.Figure 4Effect of distinct structural domains of p27 on CDC2 kinase activity. The recombinant CDC2-cyclin B complex (1 IU) was coincubated with histone H1 (2.5 μm) and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in the absence or the presence of indicated amounts of p27, Np27, and Cp27 for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction mixture was then electrophoretically separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and the gel dried and autoradiographed. InD, the CDC2-cyclin B complex was incubated with increasing concentrations of histone H1 in the presence (+) or the absence of 3 μm Cp27 (−). The reaction mixture was treated as described above and the level of histone H1 phosphorylation was quantitated using QS30 software following scanning of the autoradiographs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) During routine experiments to examine the effect of p27 on CDC2-cyclin B kinase activity, we also observed phosphorylation of the recombinant p27 and the COOH-terminal domain of p27 by CDC2 kinase. Under these conditions, the NH2-terminal domain was not phosphorylated by CDC2 (Fig. 5 A). Since the carboxyl-terminal domain of p27 contains a consensus sequence for CDC2 kinase (amino acid residue 187) (14Toyoshima H. Hunter T. Cell. 1994; 78: 67-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1925) Google Scholar, 21Moreno S. Nurse P. Cell. 1990; 61: 549-551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 22Nigg E.A. Semin. Cell Biol. 1991; 2: 261-270PubMed Google Scholar), we next sought to determine the phosphorylation site in p27 by CDC2 kinase. Accordingly, p27 and Cp27, which lacked a portion (amino acid residues 187–198) of the COOH-terminal domain, were engineered. The recombinant proteins, designated p27del and Cp27del, respectively, were bacterially expressed, purified, and tested for their ability to be phosphorylated by CDC2 kinase. As shown in Fig. 5 A, both p27del and Cp27del failed to serve as a substrate for CDC2 kinase in vitro. These results indicate that p27 is phosphorylated within its carboxyl-terminal region (amino acid residues 187–198), which contains a consensus motif for CDC2 kinase. As the biochemical functions of many cell cycle proteins are thought to be regulated by phosphorylation-dephosphorylation events (1Pines J. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 305-313PubMed Google Scholar), we next sought to investigate the role of p27 phosphorylation on its ability to modulate CDC2 kinase activity. As shown in Fig. 5 B, loss of the phosphorylation site in wild type p27 did not affect its ability to inhibit CDC2 kinase activity. In contrast, deletion of the phosphorylation site from Cp27 completely abolished its activating effect on CDC2 (Fig. 5 C). Together, these results makes it possible to speculate that phosphorylation of p27 regulates only its activating, but not inhibitory, function. Further mutation analysis of putative phosphorylation site of p27 should allow us to investigate the role of phosphorylation in regulating its activating function. Investigation of the contribution of p27 to cell cycle regulation has been limited to its role during the G1/S transition. p27 was first described as an inhibitor of cyclin E-Cdk2 in transforming growth factor-β-treated cells, which were contact-inhibited. Overexpression of p27 results in a G1 cell cycle arrest (23Polyak K. Kato J.Y. Solomon M.J. Sherr C.J. Massague J. Roberts J.M. Koff A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1813) Google Scholar). In vitro, p27 inhibits cyclin E-Cdk2 kinase activity more effectively than other Cdk-cyclin holoenzymes, and this raises the question as to whether p27 may have differential specificity for regulating distinct cyclin-Cdk complexes (14Toyoshima H. Hunter T. Cell. 1994; 78: 67-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1925) Google Scholar, 24Polyak K. Lee M.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Koff A. Roberts J.M. Tempst P. Massague J. Cell. 1994; 78: 59-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar). The level of p27 is also regulated during the cell cycle. Accumulating evidence indicates that p27 reaches its maximal level in quiescent cells and gradually decreases as cells approach S phase, likely as a result of increased degradation through the ubiquitin proteosome complex and the translational regulation of p27 mRNA (25Pagano M. Tam S.W. Theodoras A.M. Beer-Romero P. Del Sal G. Chau V. Yew P.R. Draetta G.F. Rolfe M. Science. 1995; 269: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). Investigation of a possible role for p27 during the G2/M transition has been hampered by G1 arrest of cells overexpressing this molecule and the lack of a reliable inducible system to study the effects of this cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors on the activity of different cyclin-Cdk holoenzymes. In the present report, we have taken advantage of the availability of recombinant p27 and CDC2-cyclin B complex to study the role of p27 in regulation of cell cycle progression through G2/M phase. Our results indicate that a variant form of p27, which lacks the NH2-terminal region, is expressed during G2/M, and the expression pattern of this protein is temporally similar to that of CDC2 and cyclin B in vivo. We have shown that p27 regulates CDC2 kinase activity in vitro via an NH2-terminal inhibitory region and a COOH-terminal activating region. Furthermore the COOH-terminal domain (amino acid residues 187–198) of p27 and Cp27 is phosphorylated by CDC2 kinase, which could be important in the CDC2-activating function of this molecule. Taken together, these findings suggest that regulation of p27 degradation and p27 phosphorylation play a major role in controlling cell cycle progression. Although the exact physiochemical properties of the variant form of p27 expressed in vivo remains unknown, our findings indicate that further investigation of the role of the carboxyl-terminal domains of p27 in regulating G2/M cell cycle progression is highly warranted."

All mutant receptors constitutively stimulated adenylyl cyclase. The biological activity, measured as cAMP production relative to the wild type receptor, was specific for each mutant in transient and stable transfection assays. Cells expressing these mutants proliferated in the absence of TSH. The rate of growth in the absence of TSH paralleled basal cAMP production for each mutant receptor. Low TSH concentrations stimulated the growth of mutant receptor-expressing cells, and not of the cells expressing the wild type receptor. Also, the entry in the cell cycle and the plating efficiency were markedly stimulated by the expression of the mutant receptors. These data provide a molecular link between the occurrence of TSH receptor mutations and thyroid autonomously functioning adenomas."
