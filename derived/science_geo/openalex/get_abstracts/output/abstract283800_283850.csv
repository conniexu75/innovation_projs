https://openalex.org/W2069853751,"The concept of a spatial-velocity hodograph is introduced to describe quantitatively the extrusion of a carbon tubule from a catalytic particle. The conditions under which a continuous tubular surface can be generated are discussed in terms of this hodograph, the shape of which determines the geometry of the initial nanotube. The model is consistent with all observed tubular shapes and explains why the formation process induces stresses that may lead to ""spontaneous"" plastic deformation of the tubule. This result is due to the violation of the continuity condition, that is, to the mismatch between the extrusion velocity by the catalytic particle, required to generate a continuous tubular surface, and the rate of carbon deposition."
https://openalex.org/W2029866745,"Many differences in the ring-width growth within a tree may be attributed to changing supplies of food and hormones. In moist sites or during periods of favorable climate, there may be sufficient food for the production of wide rings throughout the tree. But in dry sites or during years of low moisture and high temperatures, food competition within the tree is likely to be greater and the cambium at the base of the stem is likely to receive a limited food supply and may produce narrow rings. The cambium at the stem base depends upon the entire crown for food, hence ring growth reflects the tree's ambient climate. But, the cambium in the top of the tree or in the upper branches depends upon a more restricted portion of the crown for its food and hormone supplies. The rings produced by the cambium vary greatly from branch to branch and are less reliable indicators of the climate surrounding the entire tree than rings at the tree base. Therefore, ring series at the base of trees in semiarid sites provide the most reliable, as well as the longest, record of macroclimatic variation."

This technique verified also that fullerenes are produced in similar amounts in the soots of common flames under ambient atmospheric conditions. Therefore, the C60 in the K-T boundary layer may have originated in the extensive wildfires that were associated with the cataclysmic impact event that terminated the Mezozoic era about 65 million years ago."
https://openalex.org/W2068033855,X-ray and optical studies of single crystals of carbon tetrachloride have established the existence of a previously unreported rhombohedral modification stable between the melting point and the transition temperature. The discovery of this phase emphasizes the need for a careful reinterpretation of available measurements of the thermal properties of solid carbon tetrachloride.
https://openalex.org/W2031549690,An early tetrapod fossil from the Upper Devonian of Pennsylvania (Catskill Formation) extends the temporal range of tetrapods in North America and suggests that they attained a virtually global equatorial distribution by the end of the Devonian. Derived features of the shoulder girdle indicate that appendicular mechanisms of support and propulsion were well developed even in the earliest phases of tetrapod history. The specialized morphology of the pectoral skeleton implies that the diversity of early tetrapods was great and is suggestive of innovative locomotor patterns in the first tetrapods.

Heating at a rate of several degrees per second gives a measurable signal which shows that green plants can store energy at very low temperatures. The absorption cross section for the unit which carries out the photoreaction is several hundred times larger than that for one chlorophyll molecule, an indication that these are the ""photosynthetic units"" of photosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2081479582,"In the experiments described the following observations have been made: (1) The toxic and diabetogenic action of alloxan increases in rats fed a low protein diet and even more so in the case of a high lard or ox fat diet. (2) The action of these fat diets was corrected by the addition of methionine, thiouracil, or coconut oil, but there was no modification either by addition of choline or sulfonamide or by increase in the protein proportion. (3) In rats fed other high fat diets (olive oil, butter) the actions of alloxan were not modified, but there was a slight diminution when high oleomargarine or corn oil diets were fed. However, complete protection was observed when a high coconut oil diet was administered. (4) The unfavorable effect of the high lard diet was observed also on the initiation and evolution of diabetes due to subtotal pancreatectomy. Contrarily, feeding a high protein diet and especially treatment with thiouracil had a favorable effect. (5) Diabetes appeared first in subtotal pancreatectomized rats which were overfed, then in those which ate ad libitum, and finally in those which were underfed. Diabetes appeared in rats fed a single meal before it did in those eating the same amount of food divided into three meals."
https://openalex.org/W1978793100,"Nocturnal accumulations of carbon dioxide during 40 temperature inversions in 1 year were used as an index of the metabolic activity of a forest. Rates of CO2 production varied with temperature and with season. Spring and summer rates were 2 to 3 times higher than winter rates at the same temperature. Mean monthly temperatures, averaged over 15 years, were used with the curves of respiration on temperature to compute annual gross respiration of the Brookhaven oak-pine forest. The forest was estimated to have a yearly release of approximately 3400 grams of CO2 per square meter, theoretically equivalent to 2104 grams of dry matter (carbohydrate)."

https://openalex.org/W2105658598,"1. The basic principle in Mendel's discoveries is that of the purity of t. he germcells; in accordance with this a cross-bred animal or plant produces germ-cells bearing only one of each pair of characters in which its parents differ. From it follows the occurrence in the second and later hybrid generations of a definite number of forms in definite numerical proportions. 2. Mendel's principle of dominance is realized in the heredity of a considerable number of characters among both animals and plants. In accordance with this principle, hybrid offspring have visibly the character of only one parent or the other, though they transmit those of both parents. 3. In other cases the hybrid has a distinctive character of its own. This may approximate more or less closely the character of one parent or the other, or it may be entirely different from both. Frequently the distinctive hybrid character resembles a lost ancestral character. In some cases of this sort, as in coat-color of mammals, the hybrid character probably results from a recomibination of the characters seen in one or both parents, with certain Other characters latent (that is, recessive) in one parent or the other. 4. There have been observed the following exceptions to the principle of dominance, or to the principle of purity of the germ-cells, or to both: (a) Mosaic inheritance, in which a pair of characters ordinarily related as dominant and recessive occur in a balanced relationship, side by side in the hybrid individual and frequently in its germ-cells also. This balanced condition, once obtained, is usually stable under close breeding, but is readily disturbed by cross-breeding, giving place then to the normal dominance. (b) Stable (self-perpetuating) hybrid forms result from certain crosses. These constitute an exception to both the law of dominance and to that of purity of the germ-cells. For the hybrid is like neither parent, but the characters of both parents exist in a stable union in the mature germcells produced by the hybrid. (c) Coupling, i. e., complete correlation may exist between two or more characters, so that they form a compound unit not separable in heredity, at least in certain crosses. (d) Disintegration of characters apparently simple may take place in consequence of cross-breeding. (e) Departures from the expected ratios of dominants to recessives may be explained in some cases as due to inferior vigor, and so greater mortality, on the part of dominants or recessives respectively. (f) Cases of apparent reversal of dominance may arise from 'false hybridization' (induced lparthenogenesis). Possibly in other cases the determination of dominance rests with circumstances as yet unknown. 5. Mendel's principles strengthen the view that species arise by discontinuous variation. They explain why new types are especially variable, how one variation causes others, and why certain variations are so persistent in their Occurrence."

https://openalex.org/W2067463242,"The emission of 20 to 60 kev x-rays by an astronomical object in the constellation of Cygnus has been observed with a balloon-borne x-ray telescope flown from Hyderabad, India. The balloon data, used in conjunction with data pertaining to the flux in the wavelength range from 2 to 10 A can be fitted by a power law in photon energy varying as (h(v))-(1.7). The Cygnus object is the brightest object in the sky in the hard x-ray wavelength range and has the hardest spectrum of all observed objects that emit x-rays. The astronomical object should be capable of accelerating protons up to energies of the order of 10(18) electron volts. Upper limits to the hard x-ray fluxes from Sco XR-1, Cyg XR-2, Oph XR-1, and Ser XR-1 are established; it is shown that the Sco XR-1 spectrum is very soft."
