In lithium cells, only the octahedral structure forms, but in sodium cells, trigonal prismatic structures are also possible. However, there is a lack of understanding about how to predict and control the formation of each structure. Zhao et al. used the simple properties of ions, namely their charge and their radius appropriately weighted by stoichiometry, to determine whether sodium in the interlayers between the transition metal or other ion-oxide layers remain octahedral rather than switching over to trigonal prismatic coordination.

Clark et al. show that even if fossil fuel emissions were eliminated immediately, emissions from the global food system alone would make it impossible to limit warming to 1.5°C and difficult even to realize the 2°C target. Thus, major changes in how food is produced are needed if we want to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. Science , this issue p. 705"

Data from the Indian states of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh provide a detailed view into severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission pathways and mortality in a high-incidence setting. Reported cases and deaths have been concentrated in younger cohorts than would be expected from observations in higher-income countries, even after accounting for demographic differences across settings. Among 575,071 individuals exposed to 84,965 confirmed cases, infection probabilities ranged from 4.7 to 10.7% for low-risk and high-risk contact types, respectively. Same-age contacts were associated with the greatest infection risk. Case fatality ratios spanned 0.05% at ages of 5 to 17 years to 16.6% at ages of 85 years or more. Primary data from low-resource countries are urgently needed to guide control measures."
https://openalex.org/W3096751000,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus enters host cells via an interaction between its Spike protein and the host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). By screening a yeast surface-displayed library of synthetic nanobody sequences, we developed nanobodies that disrupt the interaction between Spike and ACE2. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) revealed that one nanobody, Nb6, binds Spike in a fully inactive conformation with its receptor binding domains locked into their inaccessible down state, incapable of binding ACE2. Affinity maturation and structure-guided design of multivalency yielded a trivalent nanobody, mNb6-tri, with femtomolar affinity for Spike and picomolar neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 infection. mNb6-tri retains function after aerosolization, lyophilization, and heat treatment, which enables aerosol-mediated delivery of this potent neutralizer directly to the airway epithelia."

By contrast, single-domain antibodies called nanobodies can be produced in bacteria or yeast, and their stability may enable aerosol delivery. Two papers now report nanobodies that bind tightly to spike and efficiently neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in cells. Schoof et al. screened a yeast surface display of synthetic nanobodies and Xiang et al. screened anti-spike nanobodies produced by a llama. Both groups identified highly potent nanobodies that lock the spike protein in an inactive conformation. Multivalent constructs of selected nanobodies achieved even more potent neutralization.

https://openalex.org/W3096331199,"We developed a de novo protein design strategy to swiftly engineer decoys for neutralizing pathogens that exploit extracellular host proteins to infect the cell. Our pipeline allowed the design, validation, and optimization of de novo human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) decoys to neutralize severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The best monovalent decoy, CTC-445.2, bound with low nanomolar affinity and high specificity to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) showed that the design is accurate and can simultaneously bind to all three RBDs of a single spike protein. Because the decoy replicates the spike protein target interface in hACE2, it is intrinsically resilient to viral mutational escape. A bivalent decoy, CTC-445.2d, showed ~10-fold improvement in binding. CTC-445.2d potently neutralized SARS-CoV-2 infection of cells in vitro, and a single intranasal prophylactic dose of decoy protected Syrian hamsters from a subsequent lethal SARS-CoV-2 challenge."

In our work, we experimentally demonstrate a topological system, using a photonic platform, in which the very existence of the topological phase is brought about by nonlinearity. Whereas in the linear regime, the lattice structure remains topologically trivial, light beams launched above a certain power threshold drive the system into its transient topological regime, and thereby define a nonlinear unidirectional channel along its edge. Our work studies topological properties of matter in the nonlinear regime, and may pave the way towards compact devices that harness topological features in an on-demand fashion."

This area of research has been hampered by the difficultly in identifying functional conservation. Wong et al. now show that despite low sequence conservation, enhancer function is strongly conserved through the animal kingdom (see the Perspective by Harmston). Transgenic expression of sponge enhancers in zebrafish and mice demonstrates that these sequences can drive cell type–specific gene expression across species. These results suggest an unexpectedly deep level of conservation of gene regulation across the animal kingdom maintained over the course of metazoan evolution.

These results reveal that ACC is a critical node in model-based control, with a specific role in predicting future states given chosen actions. Behavior is not a unitary phenomenon but rather is determined by partly parallel control systems that use different computational principles to evaluate choices (Balleine and Dickinson, 1998Balleine B.W.

Goals and habits in the brain.Neuron. 2013; 80: 312-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). A model-based controller learns to predict the specific consequences of actions (i.e., the states and rewards they immediately lead to) and evaluates their long-run utility by simulating behavioral trajectories. This confers behavioral flexibility, as the distant implications of new information can be evaluated using the model rather than learned through trial and error. However, the required simulations are computationally expensive and slow. Well-practiced actions in familiar environments are instead controlled by a habitual system, thought to involve model-free reinforcement learning (RL) (Sutton and Barto, 1998Sutton R.S. Barto A.G. Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1998Google Scholar). This uses reward prediction errors to cache preferences between actions, allowing quick and computationally cheap decision making, at the cost of reduced behavioral flexibility. Though model-based decision making is fundamental to flexible behavior, its implementation in the brain remains poorly understood. Mechanistically dissecting model-based control necessitates dissociating it from simpler model-free systems. This requires tasks in which each system recommends a different course of action. Historically, tasks that achieved this, such as outcome devaluation (Adams and Dickinson, 1981Adams C.D. Dickinson A. Instrumental responding following reinforcer devaluation.Q. J. Exp. Psychol. Sect. B. 1981; 33: 109-121Crossref Scopus (442) Google Scholar), were poorly suited to neurophysiology as they generated only a limited number of informative trials. More recently, sequential decision tasks for humans have been developed that disambiguate model-based and model-free control in a stable way over many trials. The most popular of these is the so-called two-step task (Daw et al., 2011Daw N.D. Gershman S.J. Seymour B. Dayan P. Dolan R.J.

Building on this work, we developed a novel two-step task for mice designed to dissociate state prediction from reward prediction in neural activity and model-based from model-free control in behavior. The task was additionally designed to prevent subjects from using alternative strategies that can otherwise complicate the interpretation of two-step task behavior in extensively trained animals (Akam et al., 2015Akam T. Costa R. Dayan P. Simple plans or sophisticated habits? State, transition and learning interactions in the two-step task.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2015; 11: e1004648Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We used this task to probe the involvement of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in model-based decision making. The ACC is a critical contributor to reward guided decision making (Rushworth and Behrens, 2008Rushworth M.F.S. Behrens T.E.J. Choice, uncertainty and value in prefrontal and cingulate cortex.Nat.

Rushworth M.F.S. Gaffan D. Passingham R.E. The anterior cingulate and reward-guided selection of actions.J.

Neurosci. 2008; 28: 13775-13785Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Diverse theoretical accounts have been offered for ACC function (Ebitz and Hayden, 2016Ebitz R.B. Hayden B.Y. Dorsal anterior cingulate: a Rorschach test for cognitive neuroscience.Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19: 1278-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), but an influential computational model proposes that many of the underlying observations can be accounted for by ACC generating precisely the type of specific action-outcome predictions required for model-based RL (Alexander and Brown, 2011Alexander W.H. Brown J.W. Medial prefrontal cortex as an action-outcome predictor.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 1338-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar).

Goal-oriented and habitual decisions: neural signatures of model-based and model-free learning.Neuroimage. 2020; 215: 116834Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), tasks designed to dissociate model-based and model-free control have not to our knowledge been combined with single-unit recordings or causal manipulations in ACC. Combining a sequential decision task with calcium imaging and optogenetics, our data demonstrate a rich set of task representations in ACC, including action-state predictions and surprise signals, and a causal role in using observed action-state transitions to guide subsequent choices. These results reveal that ACC is a critical component of the model-based controller and uncover a neural basis for predicting future states given chosen actions. As in the original two-step task (Daw et al., 2011Daw N.D. Gershman S.J. Seymour B. Dayan P. Dolan R.J. Model-based influences on humans’ choices and striatal prediction errors.Neuron. 2011; 69: 1204-1215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar), our task consisted of a choice between two “first-step” actions that led probabilistically to one of two “second-step” states in which reward could be obtained. Each first-step action commonly led to one second-step state and rarely to the other. However, whereas in the original task these action-state transition probabilities were constant, we introduced occasional reversals in the transition probabilities (i.e., transitions that were previously common became rare and vice versa). Transition probability reversals have two desirable consequences. First, if both reward and action-state transition probabilities change independently over time, it is possible to dissociate state prediction and reward prediction in neural activity. Second, reversals in the transition probabilities prevent subjects from using habit-like strategies consisting of mappings from the second-step state in which rewards have recently been obtained to specific actions at the first step. This can in principle generate behavior that looks very similar to model-based control, despite not using forward planning (Akam et al., 2015Akam T. Costa R. Dayan P. Simple plans or sophisticated habits? State, transition and learning interactions in the two-step task.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2015; 11: e1004648Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Transition probability reversals break the long-run predictive relationship between where rewards are obtained and which first-step action is correct, preventing these strategies while still permitting model-based RL. We directly compared versions of the task with fixed and changing action-state transition probabilities (Figure S1) and found that subject’s behavior was radically different in each, suggesting that they recruit different strategies. To simplify the task for mice, we used a single action available in each second-step state rather than the choice between two actions in the original task. We also increased the contrast between good and bad options, as in the original task the stochasticity of state transitions and reward probabilities causes both model-based and model-free control to obtain rewards at a rate negligibly different from random choice at the first step (Akam et al., 2015Akam T. Costa R. Dayan P. Simple plans or sophisticated habits? State, transition and learning interactions in the two-step task.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2015; 11: e1004648Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar; Kool et al., 2016Kool W. Cushman F.A. Gershman S.J. When does model-based control pay off?.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2016; 12: e1005090Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To promote task engagement, we therefore used a block-based reward probability distribution rather than the random walks used in the original and increased the probability of common relative to rare state transitions. We physically implemented the task using a set of four nose-poke ports: top and bottom ports in the center, flanked by left and right ports (Figure 1A). Each trial started with the central ports lighting up, requiring a choice between top and bottom ports. The choice of a central port led probabilistically to a “left-active” or “right-active” state, in which respectively the left or right port was illuminated. The subject then poked the illuminated left or right port to gain a probabilistic water reward (Figures 1A and 1B). Pokes to non-illuminated ports were ignored, so at the first step only pokes to the top or bottom ports, and at the second step only pokes to the illuminated side port, affected the task. A 1 second inter-trial interval started when the subject exited the side port. Subjects rarely poked either side port at the time of first-step choice, or the inactive side port at the second step (Figure S2), indicating that they understood the trial structure. Each block was defined by the state of both the reward and transition probabilities (Figure 1C). There were three possible states of the reward probabilities for the left/right ports: respectively good/bad, neutral/neutral, and bad/good, where good/neutral/bad reward probabilities were 0.8/0.4/0.2. There were two possible states of the transition probabilities: top → left/bottom → right and top → right/bottom → left (Figure 1C), where, for example, top → right indicates that the top port commonly (0.8 of trials) led to the right port and rarely (0.2 of trials) to the left port. At block transitions, the reward and/or transition probabilities changed (see STAR Methods). Reversals in which first-step action (top or bottom) had higher reward probability could therefore occur because of reversals in either the reward or transition probabilities. Block transitions were triggered on the basis of a behavioral criterion (see STAR Methods) that resulted in block lengths of 63.6 ± 31.7 (mean ± SD) trials. Subjects learned the task in 3 weeks with minimal shaping and performed an average of 576 ± 174 (mean ± SD) trials per day thereafter (Table 1). Our behavioral dataset used data from day 22 of training onward (n = 17 mice, 400 sessions, 230,237 trials). Subjects tracked which first-step action had higher reward probability (Figures 1D and 1E), choosing the correct option at the end of non-neutral blocks with probability 0.68 ± 0.03 (mean ± SD). Choice probabilities adapted faster following reversals in the action-state transition probabilities (exponential fit tau = 17.6 trials), compared with reversals in the reward probabilities (tau = 22.7 trials, p = 0.009, bootstrap test; Figure 1E).Table 1Two-Step Task Parameter Changes over TrainingSession NumberReward Size (μl)Transition Probabilities (Common/Rare)Reward Probabilities (Good/Bad Side)1100.9/0.1first 40 trials all rewarded, subsequently 0.9/0.12–4100.9/0.10.9/0.15–66.50.9/0.10.9/0.17–840.9/0.10.9/0.19–1240.8/0.20.9/0.1≥1340.8/0.20.8/0.2 Open table in a new tab Reaction times to enter the second-step port were faster following common than rare transitions (p = 2.8 × 10−8, paired t test) (Figure 1F). However, in our task (unlike the original), the motor action associated with a given second-step state is fixed, and hence second-step reaction time differences may reflect preparatory activity at the motor level and so may not provide strong evidence about subjects’ decision strategy. To assess ACC’s involvement in model-based and model-free control, we require that the task recruit both systems and disambiguate the contribution of each to behavior. In the original two-step task, the contribution of each systems can be assessed by examining the so-called stay probabilities of repeating the first-step choice as a function of subsequent trial events. Model-based control causes the interaction of state transition (common or rare) and outcome (rewarded or not) to determine stay probabilities (Daw et al., 2011Daw N.D. Gershman S.J. Seymour B. Dayan P. Dolan R.J. Model-based influences on humans’ choices and striatal prediction errors.Neuron. 2011; 69: 1204-1215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). This is because rewards following common transitions promote repeating the same choice on the next trial, but rewards following rare transitions increase the value of the state commonly accessed via the not-chosen first-step action and hence promote switching. Model-free control by contrast causes the outcome, but not transition, to determine stay probabilities, because rewards directly reinforce actions that precede them irrespective of the transition that occurred. We expect this picture to be somewhat different in the present task. In the original two-step task, it is assumed that subjects do not update their estimates of the transition probabilities in light of experienced state transitions, because the transition probabilities are fixed, and subjects are explicitly told this. In our task the transition probabilities change over time, so a model-based controller must update transition probability estimates on the basis of experience. We have previously shown that when such model learning is included, the influence of transition-outcome interaction on stay probability is reduced, but common transitions themselves become reinforcing (Akam et al., 2015Akam T. Costa R. Dayan P. Simple plans or sophisticated habits? State, transition and learning interactions in the two-step task.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2015; 11: e1004648Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This is because a model-based agent chooses the first-step action it believes will reach the better of the two second-step states. Common transitions confirm the agent in its belief that the chosen action reaches the desired state, while rare transitions make it appear more likely that the not-chosen action reaches the better state. We quantified how transition, outcome, and their interaction predicted stay probability in the present task (Figure 2A) using a logistic regression analysis (Figure 2B), with additional predictors to capture choice biases and correct for cross-trial correlations which can otherwise can give a misleading picture of how trial events influence subsequent choice (Akam et al., 2015Akam T. Costa R. Dayan P. Simple plans or sophisticated habits? State, transition and learning interactions in the two-step task.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2015; 11: e1004648Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar; Table 2). Positive loading on the outcome predictor indicated that reward was reinforcing (i.e., predicted staying) (p < 0.001, bootstrap test). Positive loading on the transition predictor indicated that common transitions were also reinforcing (p < 0.001), as expected for model-based control with transition probability learning. Loading on the transition-outcome interaction predictor was not significantly different from zero (p = 0.79). To understand the implications of this, we simulated the behavior of a model-based and a model-free RL agent, with the parameters of both fit to the behavioral data, and ran the logistic regression analysis on data simulated from both models (Figures 2D–2I). The RL agents used in these simulations included forgetting about actions not taken and states not visited, as RL model comparison indicated this greatly improved fits to mouse behavior (see below). Data simulated from a model-free agent showed a large loading on the outcome predictor (i.e., rewards were reinforcing) but little loading on the transition predictor or transition-outcome interaction predictors (Figure 2E). In contrast, data simulated from the model-based agent showed a large loading on both outcome and transition predictors (i.e., both rewards and common transitions were reinforcing) (Figure 2H) and a smaller loading on the interaction predictor. Therefore, in our data the transition predictor loaded closer to the model-based strategy, and the interaction predictor loaded closer to the model-free strategy.Table 2RL and Logistic Regression Model Variables and ParametersVariables and ParametersDescriptionLogistic Regression Model PredictorsBias: top/bottomchoose top-pokeBias: clockwise/counterclockwisechoose top if previous trial ended at left poke, bottom if at rightChoicerepeat choiceCorrectrepeat correct choiceOutcomerepeat rewarded choiceTransitionrepeat choice followed by common transitionTransition-outcome interactionrepeat choice followed by rewarded common and non-rewarded rare transitionsRL Model Variablesrreward (0 or 1)cchoice taken at first step (top or bottom poke)c′choice not taken at first step (top or bottom poke)ssecond-step state (left-active or right-active)s′state not reached at second step (left-active or right-active)Qmf(c)model-free action value for choice cQmo(c,st−1)motor-level model-free action value for choice c following second-step state st−1Qmb(c)model-based value of choice cV(s)value of state sP(s|c)estimated transition probability of reaching state s after choice cc‾choice historym‾(st−1)motor action history (i.e., choice history following second-step state st−1)RL Model ParametersαQvalue learning ratefQvalue forgetting rateλeligibility trace parameterαTtransition learning ratefTtransition forgetting rateαclearning rate for choice perseverationαmlearning rate for motor-level perseverationGmfmodel-free action value weightGmomotor-level model-free action value weightGmbmodel-based action value weightBcchoice bias (top/bottom)Brrotational bias (clockwise/counterclockwise)Pcchoice perseveration strengthPmmotor-level perseveration strength Open table in a new tab The above analysis considers only the influence of the most recent trial’s events on choice. However, the slow time course of adaptation to reversals (Figure 1E) indicates that choices must be influenced by a longer trial history. To better understand these long-lasting effects, we used a lagged regression analysis assessing how the current choice was influenced by past transitions, outcomes, and their interaction (Figure 2C). Predictors were coded such that a positive loading on, for example, the outcome predictor at lag x indicates that reward on trial t increased the probability of repeating the trial t choice at trial t + x. Past outcomes significantly influenced current choice up to lags of seven trials, with a smoothly decreasing influence at larger lags. Past state transitions influenced the current choice up to lags of four trials with, unexpectedly, a somewhat larger influence at lag 2 compared with lag 1. Also unexpectedly, although the transition-outcome interaction on the previous trial did not significantly influence the current choice, the interaction at lag 2 and earlier did, with the strongest effect at lag 2. To understand how these patterns relate to RL strategy, we analyzed the behavior of model-based and model-free agents using the lagged regression (Figures 2F and 2I). Subjects behavior did not closely resemble either pure strategy, nor did it appear to be a simple mixture, suggesting the presence of additional features. To assess how behavior diverged from these models, we performed an in-depth model comparison, detailed in Figure S3. The best fitting model used a mixture of model-based and model-free control but also incorporated additional features not typically used to model two-step task behavior: forgetting about values and state transitions for not-chosen actions, perseveration effects spanning multiple trials, and representation of actions both at the level of the choice they represent (e.g., top port) and the motor action they require (e.g., left port → top port). Taken together, the additional features substantially improved fit quality (Δ integrated Bayes information criterion [iBIC] = 11,018), and data simulated from the best fitting RL model better matched mouse behavior (Figures 2J–2L). These data indicate that the novel task recruits both model-based and model-free RL mechanisms, providing a tool for mechanistic investigation into mechanism of flexible and automatic behavior in the mouse.

How non-covalent agonists activate the channel and whether covalent and non-covalent agonists elicit the same physiological responses are not understood. Here, we report the discovery of a non-covalent agonist, GNE551, and determine a cryo-EM structure of the TRPA1-GNE551 complex, revealing a distinct binding pocket and ligand-interaction mechanism. Unlike the covalent agonist allyl isothiocyanate, which elicits channel desensitization, tachyphylaxis, and transient pain, GNE551 activates TRPA1 into a distinct conducting state without desensitization and induces persistent pain. Furthermore, GNE551-evoked pain is relatively insensitive to antagonist treatment. Thus, we demonstrate the biased agonism of TRPA1, a finding that has important implications for the discovery of effective drugs tailored to different disease etiologies."

One such parameter is the elements needed to build proteins and molecules to maintain cells. Examining the underlying carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen content for different amino acids, Shenhav et al. examined the selective pressure resulting from nutrient limitation (see the Perspective by Polz and Cordero). The authors identified “resource-driven” selection as a purifying selective force associated with environmental nutrient availability, particularly nitrogen, and determined the impact of mutations on the organismal nutritional budget. From this constraint, the authors have proposed that the structure of the genetic code across organisms reflects the mutational impact on elemental resources.

Performing single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of 179,632 cells across 23 teratomas from 4 cell lines, we found that teratomas reproducibly contain approximately 20 cell types across all 3 germ layers, that inter-teratoma cell type heterogeneity is comparable with organoid systems, and teratoma gut and brain cell types correspond well to similar fetal cell types. Furthermore, cellular barcoding confirmed that injected stem cells robustly engraft and contribute to all lineages. Using pooled CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens, we showed that teratomas can enable simultaneous assaying of the effects of genetic perturbations across all germ layers. Additionally, we demonstrated that teratomas can be sculpted molecularly via microRNA (miRNA)-regulated suicide gene expression to enrich for specific tissues. Taken together, teratomas are a promising platform for modeling multi-lineage development, pan-tissue functional genetic screening, and tissue engineering."

We know little about this group because amphibian fossils are poorly preserved, and previous specimens from this group are both rare and mostly badly damaged.

https://openalex.org/W3095223578,"Background Nearly half of people with HIV in the United States are 50 years or older, and this proportion is growing. Between 2012 and 2016, the largest percent increase in the prevalence rate of HIV was among people aged 65 and older, the eligibility age for Medicare coverage for individuals without a disability or other qualifying condition. Previous work suggests that older people with HIV may have higher rates of chronic conditions and develop them more rapidly than older people who do not have HIV. This study compared the health status of older people with HIV with the older US population not living with HIV by comparing: (1) mortality; (2) prevalence of certain conditions, and (3) incidence of these conditions with increasing age. Methods and findings We used a sample of Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 and older from the Medicare Master Beneficiary Summary File for the years 2011 to 2016, including 100% of individuals with HIV (N = 43,708), as well as a random 1% sample of individuals without diagnosed HIV (N = 1,029,518). We conducted a survival analysis using a Cox proportional hazards model to assess mortality and to determine the need to adjust for differential mortality in our analyses of the incidence of certain chronic conditions. These results showed that Medicare beneficiaries living with HIV have a significantly higher hazard of mortality compared to older people without diagnosed HIV (3.6 times the hazard). We examined the prevalence of these conditions using logistic regression analysis and found that people with HIV have a statistically significant higher odds of depression, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), osteoporosis, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, diabetes, chronic hepatitis, end-stage liver disease, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer. To look at the rate at which older people are diagnosed with conditions as they age, we used a Fine-Gray competing risk model and showed that for individuals without diagnosis of a given condition at age 65, the future incidence of that condition over the remaining study period was higher for people with HIV even after adjusting for differential hazard of mortality and for other demographic characteristics. Many of these results also varied by personal characteristics including Medicaid dual enrollment, sex, and race and ethnicity, as well as by condition. Conclusions Increasing access to care and improving health outcomes for people with HIV is a critical goal of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy 2020. It is important for clinicians and policymakers to be aware that despite significant advances in the treatment and care of people with HIV, older people with HIV have a higher odds of having multiple chronic conditions at any point in time, a higher incidence of new diagnoses of these conditions over time, and a higher hazard of mortality than Medicare beneficiaries without HIV."

This study was aimed at identifying the anthropometric parameters more strongly associated with the majority of cardio-metabolic risk factors. Methods This study included 1214 subjects (840 women), with a body-mass-index (BMI) ≥ 25 Kg/m2, aged 39.2 ± 13 years. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), triglycerides (TG), total, HDL- and LDL-cholesterol, uric acid, vitamin D, high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), white blood cells (WBC), platelets, insulin and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), smoking habit and snoring were evaluated as cardio-metabolic risk factors.We also included the Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) to estimate cardiovascular risk in our study population. BMI, waist circumference (WC), waist-to-height-ratio (WHtR) and neck circumference (NC) were evaluated as anthropometric parameters. Results All four anthropometric parameters were positively associated to SBP, DBP, TG, FBG, insulin, HOMA-IR, WBC, and snoring (p&lt;0.001), and negatively associated with HDL-cholesterol (p&lt;0.001). NC showed a positive association with LDL-cholesterol (β = 0.76; p = 0.01; 95% C.I. 0.19 to 1.32), while vitamin D was negatively associated to WC (β = -0.16; p&lt;0.001; 95% C.I. -0.24 to -0.09), BMI (β = 0.42); p&lt;0.001; 95% C.I. -0.56 to -0.28) and WHtR (β = -24.46; p&lt;0.001; 95% C.I. -37 to -11.9).

https://openalex.org/W3094425847,"Association of G protein-coupled receptors into heterodimeric complexes has been reported for over 50 receptor pairs in vitro but functional in vivo validation remains a challenge. Our recent in vitro studies defined the functional fingerprint of heteromers composed of Gi -coupled melatonin MT2 receptors and Gq -coupled serotonin 5-HT2C receptors, in which melatonin transactivates phospholipase C (PLC) through 5-HT2C . Here, we identified this functional fingerprint in the mouse brain. Gq protein activation was probed by [35 S]GTPγS incorporation followed by Gq immunoprecipitation, and PLC activation by determining the inositol phosphate levels in brain lysates of animals previously treated with melatonin. Melatonin concentration-dependently activated Gq proteins and PLC in the hypothalamus and cerebellum but not in cortex. These effects were inhibited by the 5-HT2C receptor-specific inverse agonist SB-243213, and were absent in MT2 and 5-HT2C knockout mice, fully recapitulating previous in vitro data and indicating the involvement of MT2 /5-HT2C heteromers. The antidepressant agomelatine had a similar effect than melatonin when applied alone but blocked the melatonin-promoted Gq activation due to its 5-HT2C antagonistic component. Collectively, we provide strong functional evidence for the existence of MT2 /5-HT2C heteromeric complexes in mouse brain. These heteromers might participate in the in vivo effects of agomelatine."
https://openalex.org/W3095213717,"Escherichia coli is the most frequent agent of urinary tract infections in humans. The emergence of uropathogenic multidrug-resistant (MDR) E . coli strains that produce extended spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL) has created additional problems in providing adequate treatment of urinary tract infections. We have previously reported the antimicrobial activity of 1,8-cineole, one of the main components of Rosmarinus officinalis volatile oil, against Gram negative bacteria during planktonic growth. Here, we evaluated the antibiofilm activity of 1,8-cineole against pre-formed mature biofilms of MDR ESBL-producing uropathogenic E . coli clinical strains by carrying out different technical approaches such as counting of viable cells, determination of biofilm biomass by crystal violet staining, and live/dead stain for confocal microscopy and flow cytometric analyses. The plant compound showed a concentration- and time-dependent antibiofilm activity over pre-formed biofilms. After a 1 h treatment with 1% (v/v) 1,8-cineole, a significant decrease in viable biofilm cell numbers (3-log reduction) was observed. Biofilms of antibiotic-sensitive and MDR ESBL-producing E . coli isolates were sensitive to 1,8-cineole exposure. The phytochemical treatment diminished the biofilm biomass by 48–65% for all four E . coli strain tested. Noteworthy, a significant cell death in the remaining biofilm was confirmed by confocal laser scanning microscopy after live/dead staining. In addition, the majority of the biofilm-detached cells after 1,8-cineole treatment were dead, as shown by flow cytometric assessment of live/dead-stained bacteria. Moreover, phytochemical-treated biofilms did not fully recover growth after 24 h in fresh medium. Altogether, our results support the efficacy of 1,8-cineole as a potential antimicrobial agent for the treatment of E . coli biofilm-associated infections."
https://openalex.org/W3095164015,"Introduction There are few studies describing colonisation with extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-PE) and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) among children in sub-Saharan Africa. Colonisation often precedes infection and multi-drug-resistant Enterobacterales are important causes of invasive infection. Methods In this prospective cross-sectional study, conducted between April and June 2017, 200 children in a tertiary academic hospital were screened by rectal swab for EBSL-PE and CRE. The resistance-conferring genes were identified using polymerase chain reaction technology. Risk factors for colonisation were also evaluated. Results Overall, 48% (96/200) of the children were colonised with at least one ESBL-PE, 8.3% (8/96) of these with 2 ESBL-PE, and one other child was colonised with a CRE (0.5% (1/200)). Common colonising ESBL-PE were Klebsiella pneumoniae (62.5%, 65/104) and Escherichia coli (34.6%, 36/104). The most frequent ESBL-conferring gene was blaCTX-M in 95% (76/80) of the isolates. No resistance- conferring gene was identified in the CRE isolate ( Enterobacter cloacae ). Most of the Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam (86.2%) and amikacin (63.9%). Similarly, 94.4% and 97.2% of the Escherichia coli isolates were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam and amikacin, respectively. Hospitalisation for more than 7 days before study enrolment was associated with ESBL-PE colonisation. Conclusion Approximately half of the hospitalised children in this study were colonised with ESBL-PE. This highlights the need for improved infection prevention and control practices to limit the dissemination of these microorganisms."

In this study, we show that IDOL can be modified by small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 at the K293 residue at least. The SUMOylation of IDOL counteracts its ubiquitination and augments IDOL protein levels. SUMOylation and the associated increase of IDOL protein are effectively reversed by SUMO-specific peptidase 1 (SENP1) in an activity-dependent manner. We further demonstrate that SENP1 affects LDLR protein levels by modulating IDOL. Overexpression of SENP1 increases LDLR protein levels and enhances LDL uptake in cultured cells. On the contrary, loss of SENP1 lowers LDLR levels in an IDOL-dependent manner and reduces LDL endocytosis. Collectively, our results reveal SUMOylation as a new regulatory posttranslational modification of IDOL and suggest that SENP1 positively regulates the LDLR pathway via deSUMOylation of IDOL and may therefore be exploited for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.

The low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR)-mediated uptake of circulating LDL particles is a prototype of receptor-mediated endocytosis and plays a key role in regulating cholesterol homeostasis at both cellular and whole-body levels (1Luo J. Yang H. Song B.L. Mechanisms and regulation of cholesterol homeostasis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2020; 21: 225-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The LDLR pathway begins with LDL binding to LDLR, followed by clathrin-dependent internalization of the LDL–LDLR complex. In the acidic endosomes, LDLR is induced to dissociate from LDL, allowing the latter to be further delivered to late endosomes/lysosomes, where LDL-carried cholesteryl esters are hydrolyzed to release cholesterol (2Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. The LDL receptor.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2009; 29: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). LDLR is either directed to the cell surface for reutilization or targeted to lysosome for degradation. Mutations in LDLR as well as genes encoding apolipoprotein B and LDLR adaptor protein 1 (also known as autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia), which are involved in LDL–LDLR binding and LDL–LDLR complex endocytosis, respectively, confer elevated levels of plasma LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) that eventually increase the risk for cardiovascular disease (3Henderson R.

The gain-of-function mutations in proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9)—which binds and targets LDLR for lysosomal degradation—also underlie a subclass of familial hypercholesterolemia. Blocking PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation using the anti-PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies has emerged as an effective strategy to lower LDL-C levels in familial hypercholesterolemia patients or those intolerant to statins (5Sabatine M.S.

Biol. 2019; 39: 2468-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These results highlight the importance of IDOL stabilization in modulating LDLR expression and blood LDL-C levels. SUMOylation resembles ubiquitination in that substrate proteins are covalently modified with small molecules in single entities or polymeric chains via the E1-E2-E3 enzymatic cascade (14Denuc A. Marfany G. SUMO and ubiquitin paths converge.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2010; 38: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 15Wilkinson K.A. Henley J.M. Mechanisms, regulation and consequences of protein SUMOylation.Biochem. J. 2010; 428: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). However, unlike simple addition of ubiquitin to target proteins, small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO, also called sentrin)—which comprises five paralogues in mammals—is initially synthesized as a precursor and undergoes proteolytic processing to become active (16Flotho A. Melchior F. Sumoylation: a regulatory protein modification in health and disease.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2013; 82: 357-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 17Liang Y.C. Lee C.C. Yao Y.L.

The maturation of SUMO1–3 requires a C-terminal cleavage mediated by SUMO-specific peptidases (SENPs) (18Hickey C.M. Wilson N.R. Hochstrasser M. Function and regulation of SUMO proteases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13: 755-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Humans have six SENPs that exhibit distinct substrate preferences and subcellular distributions (19Nayak A. Muller S. SUMO-specific proteases/isopeptidases: SENPs and beyond.Genome Biol. 2014; 15: 422Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 20Kunz K. Piller T. Muller S. SUMO-specific proteases and isopeptidases of the SENP family at a glance.J. Cell Sci. 2018; 131jcs211904Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These cysteine proteases can also reverse SUMOylation by deconjugating SUMO from substrates. The SUMOylation–deSUMOylation cycle governs many biological processes by affecting protein stability, activity, localization as well as their interaction with other proteins (21Hendriks I.A. Vertegaal A.C. A comprehensive compilation of SUMO proteomics.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2016; 17: 581-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Deregulation of SUMOylation or deSUMOylation has been implicated in various cancers and neurodegenerative diseases (22Sarge K.D. Park-Sarge O.K. Sumoylation and human disease pathogenesis.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2009; 34: 200-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 23Yang Y. He Y. Wang X. Liang Z. He G. Zhang P. Zhu H. Xu N. Liang S. Protein SUMOylation modification and its associations with disease.Open Biol. 2017; 7: 170167Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, there has been a paucity of reports on how SUMO modification modulates cholesterol metabolism. The nuclear form of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) 2, the master transcriptional regulator of cholesterol biosynthesis and uptake, can be SUMOylated at the K464 residue for decreased transcriptional activity (24Hirano Y. Murata S. Tanaka K. Shimizu M. Sato R. Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins are negatively regulated through SUMO-1 modification independent of the ubiquitin/26 S proteasome pathway.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16809-16819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). SUMOylation is also reported to promote the nuclear receptor liver receptor homolog 1 to interact with its co-repressor prosperso homeobox protein 1, leading to reduced transcription of the target genes involved in reverse cholesterol transport (25Stein S. Oosterveer M.H. Mataki C. Xu P. Lemos V. Havinga R. Dittner C. Ryu D. Menzies K.J. Wang X. Perino A. Houten S.M. Melchior F. Schoonjans K. SUMOylation-dependent LRH-1/PROX1 interaction promotes atherosclerosis by decreasing hepatic reverse cholesterol transport.Cell Metab. 2014; 20: 603-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Whether SUMO can modify and regulate other players of the cholesterol pathway is largely unknown. In the current study, we report for the first time that IDOL is a SUMO1 target protein. SUMOylation occurs at multiple lysine residues including K293, which is also a key ubiquitination site. SUMOylation stabilizes IDOL by competing against its autoubiquitination, thus increasing IDOL protein level and its potency in degrading LDLR. Moreover, we show that SENP1 can deSUMOylate and destabilize IDOL. Overexpression of SENP1 increases LDLR protein level and LDL uptake, whereas knockdown or knockout of SENP1 has opposite effects. Together, these results reveal SUMOylation as a new posttranslational modification that modulates IDOL abundance and suggest a role of SENP1 in regulating the LDLR pathway. SUMOylation can occur on a lysine residue within the inverted SUMOylation consensus motif E/DxKψ (where x stands for any amino acid and ψ for a hydrophobic amino acid) (26Matic I. Schimmel J. Hendriks I.A. van Santen M.A. van de Rijke F. van Dam H. Gnad F. Mann M. Vertegaal A.C. Site-specific identification of SUMO-2 targets in cells reveals an inverted SUMOylation motif and a hydrophobic cluster SUMOylation motif.Mol. Cell. 2010; 39: 641-652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Analysis of the human IDOL sequence revealed EAK20A and DLK293G, both of which are highly conserved in vertebrates, that matched the criteria (Fig. 1A). To examine whether IDOL is modified by SUMO, we transiently transfected human hepatocellular carcinoma Huh7 cells with the plasmid expressing Flag-tagged IDOL alone or together with the plasmids expressing Myc-tagged UBC9, the SUMO-conjugating enzyme E2, and His-tagged SUMO1. Lysates were pulled down by the nickel beads and examined for the presence of IDOL. We detected a dose-dependent increase in the high-molecular-weight smears when SUMOylation machinery was present (Fig. 1B). However, substitution of SUMO2 or SUMO3 for SUMO1 yielded negative results (Fig. 1C). These data suggest that IDOL is specifically conjugated with SUMO1. To determine the potential SUMOylation site(s) on IDOL, we performed the SUMOylation assay using IDOL mutants in which K20 and K293 were individually or simultaneously replaced by arginine. Contrasting to the wild-type (WT) form of IDOL that was extensively modified by SUMO1, the K293R and K20R/K293R mutants were apparently less SUMOylated, whereas the K20R mutant had a similar level of SUMO1 conjugates (Fig. 1D). Quantitative analysis showed that the K293R mutation indeed caused significant decreases in IDOL SUMOylation (Fig. 1E). These results suggest that IDOL is SUMOylated by SUMO1 mainly at the K293 residue. However, other SUMOylation site(s) might also exist because the K293R mutation did not completely abolish SUMO1-conjugation of IDOL. IDOL is unstable, and the overexpressed IDOL protein has a half-life of about 2 h (8Zelcer N. Hong C. Boyadjian R. Tontonoz P.

Because there have been no commercial antibodies that can effectively detect endogenous IDOL (10Scotti E. Calamai M. Goulbourne C.N. Zhang L. Hong C. Lin R.R. Choi J. Pilch P.F. Fong L.G. Zou P.

Res. 2016; 118: 410-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we examined the level of transfected protein in the absence or presence of UBC9 and SUMO1 in Huh7 cells. The expression of IDOL protein was proportionally elevated with increasing concentrations of SUMO1 (Fig. 2A). Single mutation of the K20 residue failed to alter the responsiveness of IDOL to UBC9 and SUMO1, whereas arginine substitution of the K293 residue, which is also the primary ubiquitination site (6Calkin A.C.

A. 2011; 108: 20107-20112Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), resulted in an increased basal level of IDOL protein that was resistant to further augmentation by UBC9 and SUMO1 (Fig. 2, B–C). We next treated Huh7 cells transfected with IDOL and UBC9 plus SUMO1 with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 to exclude the possibility that enhanced IDOL protein expression may result from reduced ubiquitination. MG132 caused parallel increases in the amounts of SUMOylated (Fig. 2D) and total (Fig. 2E) IDOL proteins. SENP1 that can deconjugate SUMO1-modified proteins (20Kunz K. Piller T. Muller S.

These results imply a possible competition between the two posttranslational modifications. To directly demonstrate that IDOL SUMOylation can antagonize its ubiquitination, we co-expressed IDOL and ubiquitin in the absence or presence of UBC9 plus SUMO1 in Huh7 cells. As shown in Figure 2G, ubiquitination of IDOL was greatly reduced when SUMOylation components were provided. These results suggest that SUMOylation and ubiquitination regulate IDOL protein levels in a competitive manner. To further investigate the effects of SENP1 on IDOL, we prepared the recombinant SENP1-Flag protein from HEK293T cells (Fig. 3A). The deubiquitinating enzyme USP19 that deconjugates ubiquitin but not SUMO1 was included as a control. The Flag-tagged SENP1 displayed a high potency in hydrolyzing SUMO1-AMC (7-amino-4-methylcoumarin) as the substrate (Fig. 3B). As expected, USP19 but not SENP1 was able to hydrolyze ubiquitin-AFC (7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin) (Fig. 3C). We next applied increasing concentrations of WT or catalytically inactive (C603S) SENP1 in the IDOL SUMOylation assay. The SUMO1-modified species of IDOL were dose-dependently reduced by the active SENP1 but not the C603S mutant (Fig. 3D). The level of IDOL protein was significantly reduced by higher concentrations of WT SENP1 but remained unresponsive to the inactive SENP1 (Fig. 3, E–F). So far, our results suggest that SUMO1-mediated SUMOylation and SENP1-mediated deSUMOylation are two opposing processes regulating IDOL protein levels. IDOL negatively modulates LDLR stability by targeting its degradation in lysosomes (6Calkin A.C. Goult B.T. Zhang L. Fairall L. Hong C. Schwabe J.W.R. Tontonoz P.

We next sought to determine whether SENP1 affects IDOL-mediated degradation of LDLR. USP2 can counteract the degradative effect of IDOL on LDLR (12Nelson J.K. Sorrentino V. Avagliano Trezza R. Heride C. Urbe S. Distel B. Zelcer N. The deubiquitylase USP2 regulates the LDLR pathway by counteracting the E3-ubiquitin ligase IDOL.Circ. Res. 2016; 118: 410-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and was used as a control. As shown in Figure 4, A–B, SENP1 prevented degradation of the transfected LDLR protein induced by IDOL to a similar extent as USP2. Inactivation of the protease activity completely abolished the stimulatory effect of SENP1 on LDLR (Fig. 4C). We also generated two individual lines of CRL1601 cells stably expressing SENP1 (hereinafter refer to as the stable cells). We found these cells had elevated levels of endogenous LDLR protein compared with the parental cells (Fig. 4D). The mRNA abundance of Ldlr and Idol was not altered by SENP1 overexpression (Fig. 4E). PCSK9 is another potent LDLR degrader aside from IDOL (28Horton J.D. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. PCSK9: a convertase that coordinates LDL catabolism.J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: S172-S177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 29Lagace T.A. PCSK9 and LDLR degradation: regulatory mechanisms in circulation and in cells.Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2014; 25: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To rule out the possibility that PCSK9 was involved in LDLR elevation upon SENP1 overexpression, CRL1601 and stable cells were incubated with the purified PCSK9 protein at various concentrations in cholesterol-depleting medium containing lipoprotein-deficient serum, lovastatin and minimal amount of mevalonate, a condition in which the SREBP pathway and thus LDLR expression are activated (2Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. The LDL receptor.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2009; 29: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Cells grown under normal cholesterol-rich conditions were used as controls. Despite higher basal levels of LDLR in the stable cells, PCSK9 was capable of inducing LDLR degradation at a similar rate as in WT cells (Fig. S1). We next examined the effects of SENP1 on LDLR-mediated uptake of DiI (1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate)-labeled LDL. CRL1601 and stable cells were deprived of cholesterol and pulsed with DiI-LDL for 1 h. Cells were then shifted to 37 °C to allow DiI-LDL endocytosis to occur. We observed time-dependent increases of DiI-positive puncta in the cytosol of both control and stable cells (Fig. 4F). However, the internalization of DiI-LDL was much faster in the stable cells than that in control cells (Fig. 4G). To corroborate the positive role of SENP1 on LDLR levels and LDL uptake, we knocked down SENP1 in Huh7 cells with two different small interfering RNA duplexes (siSENP1-1, siSENP1-2). Contrary to the findings under the conditions where SENP1 was overexpressed (Fig. 4), silencing of SENP1 decreased the endogenous LDLR protein level (Fig. 5A) without affecting the mRNA expression of LDLR or IDOL (Fig. 5B). Of note, IDOL knockout cells (Fig. 5C) had constitutively high levels of LDLR protein even when SENP1 was depleted (Fig. 5D). These results suggest an absolute requirement of IDOL for LDLR downregulation upon SENP1 deficiency. Consistently, in CRISPR/Cas9-mediated SENP1 knockout cells, we detected profoundly reduced expression of LDLR protein but not that of LDLR or IDOL mRNA (Fig. 5, E–F). The pulse-chase experiment showed that in SENP1 knockout cells, the internalized DiI-LDL was about half of that in control cells following a 1-h pulse (Fig. 5, G–H). Altogether, these results demonstrate that SENP1 increases LDLR protein and LDL uptake through deSUMOylating IDOL. IDOL mediates ubiquitination and degradation of LDLR, and its mutations are tightly associated with abnormal plasma LDL-C levels in human populations (13Adi D. Lu X.Y. Fu Z.Y. Wei J. Baituola G.

Heart J. 2013; 34: 1292-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). So far, self-catalyzed ubiquitination has been the only known posttranslational modification of IDOL. In this study, we present evidence for the first time that IDOL can be conjugated by SUMO1 at several lysine residues including the major autoubiquitination site K293 (Fig. 1). SUMOylation elevates IDOL protein levels by competing against its autoubiquitination (Fig. 2). SENP1 can reverse IDOL SUMOylation and reduce IDOL protein abundance (Fig. 3). This SENP1-mediated deSUMOylation of IDOL attenuates its potency in degrading LDLR and, consequently, increases LDLR expression and LDL endocytosis (Figs. 4 and 5). The proposed model for SUMOylation and SENP1-mediated deSUMOylation of IDOL in regulating the LDLR pathway is depicted in Figure 6. Our findings position SENP1 as a potential regulator of the LDLR pathway and suggest that overexpression of SENP1 may serve as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. IDOL is a well-characterized transcriptional target of the liver X receptors (LXRs) (8Zelcer N. Hong C. Boyadjian R. Tontonoz P.

Interestingly, LXRs as the oxysterol-sensitive nuclear receptors become SUMOylated in the presence of endogenous and/or synthetic ligands, thereby repressing the transcription of inflammatory target genes in multiple cell types (33Lee J.H.

https://openalex.org/W3097599008,"The critical role of bacterial biofilms in chronic human infections calls for novel anti-biofilm strategies targeting the regulation of biofilm development. However, the regulation of biofilm development is very complex and can include multiple, highly interconnected signal transduction/response pathways, which are incompletely understood. We demonstrated previously that in the opportunistic, human pathogen P . aeruginosa , the PP2C-like protein phosphatase SiaA and the di-guanylate cyclase SiaD control the formation of macroscopic cellular aggregates, a type of suspended biofilms, in response to surfactant stress. In this study, we demonstrate that the SiaABC proteins represent a signal response pathway that functions through a partner switch mechanism to control biofilm formation. We also demonstrate that SiaABCD functionality is dependent on carbon substrate availability for a variety of substrates, and that upon carbon starvation, SiaB mutants show impaired dispersal, in particular with the primary fermentation product ethanol. This suggests that carbon availability is at least one of the key environmental cues integrated by the SiaABCD system. Further, our biochemical, physiological and crystallographic data reveals that the phosphatase SiaA and its kinase counterpart SiaB balance the phosphorylation status of their target protein SiaC at threonine 68 (T68). Crystallographic analysis of the SiaA-PP2C domain shows that SiaA is present as a dimer. Dynamic modelling of SiaA with SiaC suggested that SiaA interacts strongly with phosphorylated SiaC and dissociates rapidly upon dephosphorylation of SiaC. Further, we show that the known phosphatase inhibitor fumonisin inhibits SiaA mediated phosphatase activity in vitro . In conclusion, the present work improves our understanding of how P . aeuruginosa integrates specific environmental conditions, such as carbon availability and surfactant stress, to regulate cellular aggregation and biofilm formation. With the biochemical and structural characterization of SiaA, initial data on the catalytic inhibition of SiaA, and the interaction between SiaA and SiaC, our study identifies promising targets for the development of biofilm-interference drugs to combat infections of this aggressive opportunistic pathogen."

https://openalex.org/W3094990762,"Objective Intraoperative microelectrode recording (MER) and test-stimulation are regarded as the gold standard for proper placement of subthalamic (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes in Parkinson’s disease (PD), requiring the patient to be awake during the procedure. In accordance with good clinical practice, most attending neurologists will request the clinically most efficacious trajectory for definite lead placement. However, the necessity of microelectrode-test-stimulation is disputed, as it may limit the access to DBS therapy, excluding those not willing or incapable of undergoing awake surgery. Methods We retrospectively analyzed the MERs and microelectrode-test-stimulation results with regard to the decision on definite lead placement and clinical outcome in a cohort of 67 PD-patients with STN-DBS. All patients received bilateral quadripolar ring electrodes. To ascertain overall procedural efficacy, we calculated the surgical index (SI) by comparing preoperative motor improvement induced by levodopa to that induced by stimulation 7 to 18 months after surgery, measured as the relative difference between ON and OFF-states on the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale motor part (UPDRS-3). Additionally, a side-specific surgical index (SSSI) was calculated using the unilateral assessable items of the UPDRS-3. The SSSI where microelectrode-test-stimulation overruled MER were compared to those where the result of microelectrode-test-stimulation was congruent to MER results. Results A total of 134 electrodes were analyzed. For final lead placement, the central trajectory was chosen in 54% of patient hemispheres. The mean SI was 0.99 (± 0.24). SSSI averaged 1.04 (± 0.45). In 37 lead placements, microelectrode-test-stimulation overruled MER in the final trajectory selection, in 27 of these lead placements adverse effects during microelectrode-test-stimulation were decisive. Neither the number of test electrodes used nor the STN-signal length had an impact on the SSSI. The SSSI did not differ between lead placements with MER/microelectrode-test-stimulation congruency and those where the results of microelectrode-test-stimulation initiated lead placement in a trajectory with shorter STN signal. Conclusion Intraoperative testing is mandatory to ensure an optimal motor outcome of STN DBS in PD-patients when using quadripolar ring electrodes. However, we also demonstrated that neither the length of the STN-signal on MER nor the number of test electrodes influenced the motor outcome."
https://openalex.org/W3095831759,"In recent years, personalized gene regulatory networks have received significant attention, and interpretation of the multilayer networks has been a critical issue for a comprehensive understanding of gene regulatory systems. Although several statistical and machine learning approaches have been developed and applied to reveal sample-specific regulatory pathways, integrative understanding of the massive multilayer networks remains a challenge. To resolve this problem, we propose a novel artificial intelligence (AI) strategy for comprehensive gene regulatory network analysis. In our strategy, personalized gene networks corresponding specific clinical characteristic are constructed and the constructed network is considered as a second-order tensor. Then, an explainable AI method based on deep learning is applied to decompose the multilayer networks, thus we can reveal all-encompassing gene regulatory systems characterized by clinical features of patients. To evaluate the proposed methodology, we apply our method to the multilayer gene networks under varying conditions of an epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. From the comprehensive analysis of multilayer networks, we identified novel markers, and the biological mechanisms of the identified genes and their reciprocal mechanisms are verified through the literature. Although any biological knowledge about the identified genes was not incorporated in our analysis, our data-driven approach based on AI approach provides biologically reliable results. Furthermore, the results provide crucial evidences to reveal biological mechanism related to various diseases, e.g., keratinocyte proliferation. The use of explainable AI method based on the tensor decomposition enables us to reveal global and novel mechanisms of gene regulatory system from the massive multiple networks, which cannot be demonstrated by existing methods. We expect that the proposed method provides a new insight into network biology and it will be a useful tool to integrative gene network analysis related complex architectures of diseases."

These include Vimentin, tubulin beta chain protein, Actin related protein 2/3 complex subunit 2, coffilin 1 (Structural), PDZ LIM domain protein, Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor, Ras related protein Rab (signaling), superoxide dismutase, dCTPpyrophosphatase 1, Transcription initiation factor TFIID subunit 12, three isoforms of Peptidylprolylcis-trans isomerase A, SH3 domain containing protein (metabolism), three isoforms of Protein S100A9 and S100A8 (cell cycle progression/growth regulation). Conclusion Proteins identified to be differentially expressed in TBDM patient can act as potent biomarkers and as predictors for copathogenesis of tuberculosis and diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W3097824365,"Toxicodendron vernicifluum Stokes has long been used as a food supplement and traditional herbal medicine in East Asia. We applied a new extraction method to produce Toxicodendron vernicifluum Stokes extract (TVSE), that doesn’t contain urushiol (an allergenic toxin) but dose have higher levels of some flavonoids such as fustin and fisetin. This study was conducted to investigate the anticancer effects of TVSE in an in vivo system. Fifty BALB/c mice were acclimated for one week and then injected with 4T1 murine mammary carcinoma cells in mammary fat pads. After 7 days, the mice were randomly divided into 5 groups, and orally administered with 0, 50, 100, 200 or 400 mg of TVSE/kg body weight (BW)/day for 20 days. TVSE reduced tumor volume and weight dose-dependently. The expression of Ki67 was significantly reduced and the number of TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells was significantly increased in the TVSE-treated group over 100 mg/kg BW/day. While tumor nodules were not found in the liver, but only in lungs, the number of tumor nodules was reduced in a dose-dependent manner in the TVSE treated groups compared to the control group. In breast tumors, expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was reduced by TVSE treatment. TVSE treatment significantly suppressed mRNA expression in tumors of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 while increasing plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1. These results suggest that TVSE is potentially beneficial for the suppression of breast cancer growth and its-associated lung metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W3097830722,"The angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) signaling pathway is reported to modulate glucose metabolism. Targeting AT1R, our group invented ATRQβ-001 vaccine, a novel immunotherapeutic strategy to block the activation of AT1R. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of ATRQβ-001 vaccine in insulin resistance, and investigated the mechanism. Our results showed that ATRQβ-001 vaccine and specific monoclonal antibody against epitope ATR-001 (McAb-ATR) decreased fasting serum insulin concentration and improved glucose and insulin tolerance in ob/ob mice. These beneficial effects were verified in high-fat diet-induced obese mice. McAb-ATR activated insulin signaling in skeletal muscle and insulin-resistant C2C12 myotubes without affecting liver or white adipose tissue of ob/ob mice. Mechanistically, the favorable impact of McAb-ATR on insulin resistance was abolished in db/db mice and in C2C12 myotubes with leptin receptor knockdown. AT1R knockdown also eradicated the effects of McAb-ATR in C2C12 myotubes. Furthermore, McAb-ATR treatment was able to activate the leptin receptor-mediated JAK2/STAT3 signaling in skeletal muscle of ob/ob mice and C2C12 myotubes. Additionally, angiotensin II downregulated the leptin signaling in skeletal muscle of ob/ob and diet-induced obese mice. We demonstrated that ATRQβ-001 vaccine and McAb-ATR improved whole-body insulin resistance and regulated glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle in a leptin receptor-dependent manner. Our data suggest that immunotherapy targeting AT1R is a novel strategy for treating insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W3097312621,"Aggregation of α-synuclein (α-syn) has been implicated in multiple neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson’s disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and multiple system atrophy (MSA), collectively grouped as synucleinopathies. Recently, recombinant antibody fragments (Fab, scFvs and diabodies) against α-syn have emerged as an alternative to the traditional full-length antibody in immunotherapeutic approaches owing to their advantages including smaller size and higher stability, specificity and affinity. However, most of the recombinant antibody fragments tend to be expressed as inclusion bodies (IBs) making its purification extremely challenging. In the current study, a single-chain variable fragment (scFv-F) antibody, targeting the pathogenic α-syn fibrils, was engineered and expressed in E. coli. Majority of the expressed scFv-F accumulated in insoluble aggregates as IBs. A variety of mild and harsh solubilizing conditions were tested to solubilize IBs containing scFv-F to obtain the active protein. To preserve secondary structure and bioactivity, a mild solubilizing protocol involving 100 mM Tris, pH 12.5 with 2 M urea was chosen to dissolve IBs. Slow on-column refolding method was employed to subsequently remove urea and obtain active scFv-F. A three-dimensional (3D) model was built using homology modeling and subjected to molecular docking with the known α-syn structure. Structural alignment was performed to delineate the potential binding pocket. The scFv-F thus purified demonstrated high specificity towards α-syn fibrils compared to monomers. Molecular modeling studies suggest that scFv-F shares the same structural topology with other known scFvs. We present evidence through structural docking and alignment that scFv-F binds to α-syn C-terminal region. In conclusion, mild solubilization followed by slow on-column refolding can be utilized as a generalized and efficient method for hard to purify disease relevant insoluble proteins and/or antibody molecules from IBs."
https://openalex.org/W3095268450,"Our knowledge of the Solar System has been greatly advanced by exploration with robotic spacecraft, but there are many limitations on the instruments those can carry. More detailed information can be extracted by analyzing samples of Solar System bodies in Earth laboratories. Meteorites provide some natural samples, but the body they came from is often unknown, and they may not represent typical material. Recent years have seen increased interest in directly retrieving samples from other worlds and bringing them back to Earth, a process known as sample return.

The most primitive carbonaceous asteroids preserve information about the formation and early evolution of the Solar System and thus have been a high priority for sample return. The Hayabusa mission collected 1500 dust particles from asteroid (25143) Itokawa and returned them to Earth in 2010. A successor mission, Hayabusa2, visited asteroid (162173) Ryugu with the goal of obtaining a larger mass of sample, which is due to arrive on Earth in December 2020. Meanwhile, on 31 December 2018, the OSIRIS-REx (Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security–Regolith Explorer) spacecraft arrived at another primitive asteroid, (101955) Bennu, with plans to return at least 60 grams of material.

Writing in Science and Science Advances , members of the OSIRIS-REx team present results from the survey and reconnaissance phases of the mission. Detailed maps of surface properties were used to identify promising sites for sample collection and provide the necessary scientific context. These data provide information on Bennu's composition, constrain its formation process, and show how its surface evolved. They show that Bennu's surface material has been modified by exposure to space weathering, contains abundant organic material, and has evidence of past alteration by liquid water. OSIRIS-REx successfully collected its sample of Bennu on 20 October 2020; it is due to arrive on Earth in 2023."

Finding that these flows are in several dimensions quite different, we then explore the implications of these differences more formally. Since several studies within the international trade literature report findings based on the self-reported export values in financial datasets, we discuss these findings in light of the departure of financial dataset-based exports from “true” (HMRC) export values."
https://openalex.org/W3095599882,"The gap-prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle reflex has been widely used as a behavioral method for tinnitus screening in animal studies. The cortical-evoked potential gap-induced inhibition has also been investigated in animals as well as in human subjects. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of age on the cortical N1-P2 complex in the gap-prepulse inhibition paradigm. Fifty-seven subjects, aged 20 to 68 years, without continuous tinnitus, were tested with two effective gap conditions (embedded gap of 50- or 20-ms duration). Retest sessions were performed within one month. A significant gap-induced inhibition of the N1-P2 complex was found in both gap durations. Age differently affected the inhibition, depending on gap duration. With a 50-ms gap, the inhibition decreased significantly with the increase in age. This age-inhibition relationship was not found when using a 20-ms gap. The results were reproducible in the retest session. Our findings suggest that the interaction between age and gap duration should be considered when applying the gap-induced inhibition of the cortical-evoked potential as an objective measure of tinnitus in human subjects. Further studies with tinnitus patients are warranted to identify gap duration that would minimize the effects of age and maximize the difference in the inhibition between those with and without tinnitus."

They were directors of tech startups, unaccustomed to mingling with geoscientists like me. I desperately needed some breathing space away from the pressures of university life, but I wasn't totally convinced it would work out. I needn't have worried. The co-working space turned out to be the perfect environment for rebooting my flailing research career."

https://openalex.org/W3097358416,"The most common cause of death worldwide is noncommunicable diseases. A cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate the adequacy of the work process among family health teams and compare differences in regional adequacy in the state of Tocantins, in the Amazonian Region, Brazil. Categorical principal components analysis was used, and scores of each principal component extracted in the analysis were compared among health regions in Tocantins. A post hoc analysis was performed to compare the heath region pairs. The adequacy of family health teams’ work process was evaluated with respect to the Strategic Action Plan to Tackle NCDs. The results showed that the family health teams performed actions according to the Strategic Action Plan to Tackle NCDs. However, overall, the adequacy percentages of these actions according to the axes of the Plan are very uneven in Tocantins, with large variations among health regions. The family health teams in the Bico do Papagaio (Region 1), Médio Norte Araguaia (Region 2), Cantão (Region 4) and Capim Dourado (Region 5) regions have adequacy percentages ≥ 50% with the Strategic Action Plan to Tackle NCDs, whereas all other regions have percentages &lt;50%. Health teams perform surveillance actions, health promotion, and comprehensive care for NCDs in accordance with the guidelines of the Strategic Action Plan to Tackle NCDs. The challenge of NCDs in primary care requires a care model that is tailored to users’ needs and has the power to reduce premature mortality and its determinants."
https://openalex.org/W3097533593,"Purpose The gold-standard for reconstruction of large mandibular defects is the use of free flaps of vascularized autologous bone with the fibula as the preferred donor site. The use of ""custom cutting guides"" for this indication is becoming increasingly prevalent. But cost of the procedure averages around 2,500 dollars per patient excluding treatment and entails selection criteria. We think it is possible to standardize mandibular reconstructions from an anatomical mean. The objective of this study was to perform a mandibular morphometric analysis in order to obtain a set of ""mean"" measurements, which can be used by all surgeons interested in mandibular reconstruction. Methods We performed a morphometric analysis consisting of three-dimensional mandibular reconstructions of 30 men and 30 women. Several reference points were set and defined to evaluate specific lengths and angles of interest. We conducted an intra and inter-sexual descriptive analysis of measurements obtained. Results We did not identify any major intra-sexual differences within each group. The gonial angle is more open in women and the measurements characterizing the basilar contour are more prominent in men. We did not identify any differences in alveolar region parameters. Conclusion The results of this study constitute a morphological tool for surgeons, from bone graft to free flap. These results also confirm us that the use of «custom cutting guides» for mandibular reconstruction may be excessive. It is pertinent to examine the value of ""custom made"" mandibular reconstructions since the differences observed are of the order of millimeters."
