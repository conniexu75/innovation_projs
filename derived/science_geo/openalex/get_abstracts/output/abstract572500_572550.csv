https://openalex.org/W2547187744,"Assessing smoke damage in cancer genomes We have known for over 60 years that smoking tobacco is one of the most avoidable risk factors for cancer. Yet the detailed mechanisms by which tobacco smoke damages the genome and creates the mutations that ultimately cause cancer are still not fully understood. Alexandrov et al. examined mutational signatures and DNA methylation changes in over 5000 genome sequences from 17 different cancer types linked to smoking (see the Perspective by Pfeifer). They found a complex pattern of mutational signatures. Only cancers originating in tissues directly exposed to smoke showed a signature characteristic of the known tobacco carcinogen benzo[ a ]pyrene. One mysterious signature was shared by all smoking-associated cancers but is of unknown origin. Smoking had only a modest effect on DNA methylation. Science , this issue p. 618 ; see also p. 549"

Many such problems defined as computationally difficult can be mathematically mapped onto the so-called Ising problem, which looks at finding the minimum energy configuration for an array of coupled spins. Inagaki et al. and McMahon et al. show that an optical processing approach based on a network of coupled optical pulses in a ring fiber can be used to model and optimize large-scale Ising systems.

Sinatra et al. analyzed the publications of 2887 physicists, as well as data on scientists publishing in a variety of fields. When productivity (which is usually greatest early in the scientist's professional life) is accounted for, the paper with the greatest impact occurs randomly in a scientist's career. However, the process of generating a high-impact paper is not an entirely random one. The authors developed a quantitative model of impact, based on an element of randomness, productivity, and a factor Q that is particular to each scientist and remains constant during the scientist's career.

Simulations of the timing of summer sea-ice loss differ substantially, making it difficult to evaluate the pace of the loss.

https://openalex.org/W2547204916,"Fibrosis, driven by inflammation, marks the transition from benign to progressive stages of chronic liver diseases. Although inflammation promotes fibrogenesis, it is not known whether other events, such as hepatocyte death, are required for the development of fibrosis. Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) regulates hepatocyte apoptosis and production of type I IFNs. In the liver, IRF3 is activated via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling or the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) adapter, stimulator of interferon genes (STING). We hypothesized that IRF3-mediated hepatocyte death is an independent determinant of chemically induced liver fibrogenesis. To test this, we performed acute or chronic CCl4 administration to WT and IRF3-, Toll/Interleukin-1R (TIR) domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF)-, TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM)-, and STING-deficient mice. We report that acute CCl4 administration to WT mice resulted in early ER stress, activation of IRF3, and type I IFNs, followed by hepatocyte apoptosis and liver injury, accompanied by liver fibrosis upon repeated administration of CCl4. Deficiency of IRF3 or STING prevented hepatocyte death and fibrosis both in acute or chronic CCl4. In contrast, mice deficient in type I IFN receptors or in TLR4 signaling adaptors, TRAM or TRIF, upstream of IRF3, were not protected from hepatocyte death and/or fibrosis, suggesting that the pro-apoptotic role of IRF3 is independent of TLR signaling in fibrosis. Hepatocyte death is required for liver fibrosis with causal involvement of STING and IRF3. Thus, our results identify that IRF3, by its association with STING in the presence of ER stress, couples hepatocyte apoptosis with liver fibrosis and indicate that innate immune signaling regulates outcomes of liver fibrosis via modulation of hepatocyte death in the liver.

Fibrosis represents a late stage of liver disease that is common to all chronic liver diseases including viral hepatitis, alcoholic, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, biliary liver diseases, and some genetic liver disease. Despite their specific etiologies, common denominators of fibrosis are shared among all these liver diseases, including liver inflammation and hepatocyte death. Fibrosis results from chronic unresolved liver inflammation and may progress from fibrotic scarring to cirrhosis that ultimately leads to liver failure. Inflammation triggers liver fibrosis via a signaling event in which liver resident macrophages (Kupffer cells, KC) activate hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) 2The abbreviations used are: HSC, hepatic stellate cell; IRF3, interferon regulatory factor 3; STING, stimulator of interferon genes; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; α-SMA, α-smooth muscle actin; IFNAR1, type I IFN receptor; TIR, Toll/interleukin-1R; TRIF, TIR domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β; TRAM, TRIF-related adaptor molecule; TBK1, Tank-binding kinase 1; TLR, Toll-like receptor; LMNC, liver mononuclear cell; H&E, hematoxylin and eosin. to deposit collagen (1.Seki E.

Liver dysfunction results from the fibrotic tissue distorting the liver parenchyma. This process involves a dynamic and complex series of multicellular events, involving inflammation and HSC activation. The hepatocyte is primarily responsible for metabolism and detoxification, and as such, it is often exposed to damage because of toxic metabolites and reactive oxygen species. However, the role of hepatocyte death in liver fibrosis has been only partially elucidated. The currently available data demonstrate that hepatocyte apoptosis activates HSCs via paracrine mechanisms. Alternatively, HSCs can be directly activated by apoptotic bodies (3.Malhi H. Gores G.J. Cellular and molecular mechanisms of liver injury.Gastroenterology. 2008; 134: 1641-1654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Apoptosis in hepatocytes results from displacement or down-regulation of the Bcl-2 family of anti-apoptotic proteins and subsequent activation of pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins such as Bax and Bak (4.Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell death: critical control points.Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4024) Google Scholar). These events lead to oligomerization of Bax and Bak, resulting in permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane and execution of the intrinsic apoptotic process (5.Jiang X. Wang X. Cytochrome c-mediated apoptosis.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 87-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). Recently, IRF3, a transcription factor that induces IFN-β, has been shown to play a major role in cell death by way of its newly characterized BH3-only domain. IRF3 associated with the pro-apoptotic adaptor Bax and triggered apoptosis in murine embryonic fibroblasts and murine hepatocytes (6.Chattopadhyay S. Marques J.T. Yamashita M. Peters K.L. Smith K.

U.S.A. 2013; 110: 16544-16549Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether other key signal transduction events in hepatocytes are required for the pathogenesis of fibrosis. For this reason, we sought to understand the nature of pro-fibrogenic hepatocyte damage and specifically assess the potential role of hepatocyte apoptosis in determining the onset of fibrosis. In this study, we investigated the role of IRF3 in hepatocyte death and liver fibrosis. We used CCl4, a chemical that, in the short term, induces hepatocyte apoptosis (9.Shi J. Aisaki K. Ikawa Y. Wake K. Evidence of hepatocyte apoptosis in rat liver after the administration of carbon tetrachloride.Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 515-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), which is followed by secondary necrosis (10.Zakim D. Boyer T.D. Hepatology: A Texbook of Liver Diseases. 4th Ed. Saunders, Philadelphia, PA2002: 746Google Scholar, 11.Sun F. Hamagawa E. Tsutsui C. Ono Y. Ogiri Y. Kojo S. Evaluation of oxidative stress during apoptosis and necrosis caused by carbon tetrachloride in rat liver.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1535: 186-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). When administered repetitively, CCl4 induces liver fibrosis (12.Nakatsukasa H. Nagy P. Evarts R.P. Hsia C.C. Marsden E. Thorgeirsson S.S. Cellular distribution of transforming growth factor-β1 and procollagen types I, III, and IV transcripts in carbon tetrachloride-induced rat liver fibrosis.J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1833-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Using two models of CCl4-induced liver injury, we investigated the complex multicellular events associated with fibrosis in a chronic model, as well as the tightly controlled signal transduction events associated with early disruption of homeostasis and cell death in the acute model. We report that hepatocyte-specific endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activation of IRF3 occurs and is mediated by the ER adaptor, STING. Activated IRF3 associates with the pro-apoptotic adaptor Bax and induces hepatocyte death. We initially hypothesized that IRF3 will utilize established pathways of antiviral response, including type I IFNs, to induce hepatocyte apoptosis. However, our results demonstrate that the pro-apoptotic role of IRF3 is independent of its function to induce type I IFNs such as IFN-β. Taken together, our data demonstrate that hepatocyte death is indispensable in liver fibrosis and that the pathogenic role of IRF3 in liver fibrosis is mediated via its pro-apoptotic effect in hepatocytes. Repetitive episodes of liver injury, such as those induced by administration of CCl4 (a chemical inducer of hepatocyte death), result in the development of liver fibrosis, which is a hallmark of advanced and often irreversible liver disease in humans. We previously showed that IRF3-deficient mice were protected from alcohol-induced liver disease and that IRF3 deficiency in hepatocytes prevented fibrogenesis in the liver in alcoholic liver disease (8.Petrasek J. Iracheta-Vellve A. Csak T. Satishchandran A. Kodys K. Kurt-Jones E.A. Fitzgerald K.A. Szabo G. STING-IRF3 pathway links endoplasmic reticulum stress with hepatocyte apoptosis in early alcoholic liver disease.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 16544-16549Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). We evaluated this hypothesis using a mouse model of liver injury and fibrosis using CCl4 or vehicle, in a 6-week regimen of biweekly intraperitoneal injections. Deficiency of IRF3 significantly attenuated liver damage, as demonstrated by significantly lower levels of serum ALT and substantially improved histological findings compared with CCl4-treated wild-type controls (Fig. 1, A and B). IRF3-deficient mice had decreased TUNEL-positive staining in the liver compared with WT mice, suggestive of decreased apoptosis (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, TUNEL-positive staining was predominantly present in hepatocytes. IRF3-deficient mice showed significant protection from liver fibrosis, indicated by reduced α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) immunohistochemistry and Sirius Red staining compared with WT mice (Fig. 1, D and E). The protection from liver fibrosis in IRF3-deficient mice was accompanied by significantly lower expression of Acta2 and Col1a2 (Fig. 1F), encoding α-SMA and type I collagen, and by decreased expression of Ifnb and Isg15, two commonly used markers of IRF3-mediated transcriptional response (Fig. 1G). Disruption of intracellular homeostasis can lead to an accumulation of misfolded proteins associated with the unfolded protein response in the ER, also known as ER stress. Excessive ER stress is associated with pro-apoptotic signaling and can be pathogenic (13.Maurel M. Chevet E. Tavernier J. Gerlo S. Getting RIDD of RNA: IRE1 in cell fate regulation.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2014; 39: 245-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 14.Upton J.-P. Wang L. Han D. Wang E.S. Huskey N.E. Lim L. Truitt M. McManus M.T. Ruggero D. Goga A.

To test whether CCl4-induced acute hepatocyte injury induces an early ER stress response, we analyzed livers of mice at various time points after a single administration of CCl4. We found an early up-regulation of Xbp1 mRNA splicing (sXbp1), a marker of early ER stress (15.Walter P. Ron D. The unfolded protein response: from stress pathway to homeostatic regulation.Science. 2011; 334: 1081-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (3881) Google Scholar, 16.Schröder M. Kaufman R. The mammalian unfolded protein response.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 739-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2432) Google Scholar), at 1 and 2 h after administration of CCl4 (Fig. 2A). Analysis of cell populations from murine livers showed that CCl4 selectively up-regulated Xbp1 mRNA splicing in hepatocytes but not in liver mononuclear cells (LMNCs) (Fig. 2B). Previous reports have shown that ER stress results in IRF3 activation in mouse embryonic fibroblast and that Xbp1 splicing enhances the IFN-β response in immune cells (17.Liu Y.-P. Zeng L. Tian A. Bomkamp A. Rivera D. Gutman D. Barber G.N. Olson J.K. Smith J.A. Endoplasmic reticulum stress regulates the innate immunity critical transcription factor IRF3.J. Immunol. 2012; 189: 4630-4639Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 18.Hu F. Yu X. Wang H. Zuo D. Guo C. Yi H. Tirosh B. Subjeck J.R. Qiu X. Wang X.-Y. ER stress and its regulator X-box-binding protein-1 enhance polyIC-induced innate immune response in dendritic cells.Eur. J. Immunol. 2011; 41: 1086-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In our study, acute administration of CCl4 led to an early activation of IRF3, a pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein, as seen by the phosphorylation in whole cell liver lysates (Fig. 2C), at the same time as splicing of Xbp1 mRNA (Fig. 2A). The phosphorylation of IRF3 had a functional effect, because liver Ifnb1 mRNA and serum IFN-β, transcriptional targets of IRF3, showed an early up-regulation (Fig. 2D). To test whether direct induction of ER stress can lead to IRF3 phosphorylation, we treated primary hepatocytes with thapsigargin in vitro and found an early increase in phosphorylated IRF3 (Fig. 2E). Furthermore, inhibition of Tank-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), a kinase responsible for IRF3 phosphorylation, with BX795 showed a dose-dependent reduction in IRF3 phosphorylation in thapsigargin-treated hepatocytes (Fig. 2E). Building upon previous findings, our data indicate that acute administration of CCl4 results in hepatocyte-specific ER stress and phosphorylation of IRF3 in vivo and that in vitro inhibition of a kinase upstream of IRF3 inhibited phosphorylation of IRF3 induced by ER stress. Our data support the hypothesis that CCl4 activates IRF3 in hepatocytes via ER stress. Next, we asked whether IRF3 plays a role in liver injury after acute CCl4 administration. We found that IRF3-KO mice were partially protected from liver injury after acute CCl4 administration, as indicated by the significant attenuation in serum ALT compared with WT controls (Fig. 3A) and caspase-3 cleavage in the liver (Fig. 3B). To test whether the pathogenic phenotype of IRF3 involvement was mediated by its function as a transcription factor, we tested mice deficient in type I IFN receptor (IFNAR1) that lack type I IFN signaling and found that IFNAR1-KO mice had no protection from CCl4-mediated liver injury, phosphorylation of IRF3, or apoptotic signaling in the liver compared with WT mice (Fig. 3, C and D). These data suggested that the pathogenic role of IRF3 may be independent of its transcriptional role. CCl4-induced liver fibrosis activates hepatic stellate cells via TLR4 (19.Paik Y.-H. Schwabe R.F. Bataller R. Russo M.P. Jobin C. Brenner D.A.

Pimentel-Nunes P. Roncon-Albuquerque R. Leite-Moreira A. The role of lipopolysaccharide/toll-like receptor 4 signaling in chronic liver diseases.Hepatol. Int. 2010; 4: 659-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), enhanced by signal transduction emanating from the TLR4 complex induced by gut bacterial products and LPS (1.Seki E. De Minicis S. Osterreicher C.H. Kluwe J. Osawa Y. Brenner D.A. Schwabe R.F. TLR4 enhances TGF-β signaling and hepatic fibrosis.Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 1324-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar). To investigate whether activation of IRF3 in acute CCl4 liver injury was mediated by the intracellular MyD88-independent TLR4 adaptors TRIF and TRAM), or the kinase TBK1, we first inhibited activity of their downstream kinase, TBK1, by the chemical inhibitor BX795 in vivo. Pretreatment of mice with BX795 significantly attenuated the extent of liver injury and apoptotic signaling in the liver after administration of CCl4 (Fig. 3, E and F). The decrease in phosphorylated IRF3 (Fig. 3F) with BX795 pretreatment further suggests that IRF3 requires activation and phosphorylation of TBK1 to exert a pathogenic effect in CCl4-induced liver injury. In contrast, TRAM- and TRIF-KO mice were each equally as susceptible to acute CCl4 damage and apoptosis in the liver as WT mice (Fig. 3, G and H). Importantly, TRAM- and TRIF-KO mice had similar levels of phosphorylated IRF3 compared with WT mice (Fig. 3H), suggesting that IRF3 activation by acute CCl4 occurs independent of the TLR4 receptor complex and its adaptors. Together, these data suggested that TBK1-mediated activation of IRF3 is pathogenic, leading to increased liver injury. Furthermore, type I IFNs do not have a significant role in acute liver injury after CCl4 administration despite being activated by IRF3. Lastly, activation of IRF3 by acute CCl4 is independent of the canonical MyD88-independent TLR4 adaptor-mediated receptor signaling. Therefore, we hypothesized that activation of IRF3 in the liver by acute CCl4 likely involves different signaling pathways. Given the robust protection from acute or chronic CCl4-induced liver injury in mice deficient in IRF3, we next investigated subcellular localization and mechanisms of early IRF3 activation. First, we evaluated the kinetics of IRF3 activation in WT mice upon acute CCl4-mediated injury and found an early phosphorylation of IRF3 at 2 and 4 h in whole cell liver lysates (Fig. 4A). Next, we analyzed the intracellular distribution of IRF3. Analysis of subcellular liver fractions revealed that administration of CCl4 resulted in localization of phosphorylation of IRF3 not only in the cytoplasmic (Fig. 4B) and nuclear extracts (Fig. 4C), but also in the ER (Fig. 4D) and mitochondrial fractions (Fig. 4E). The finding of phosphorylated IRF3 in cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts (Fig. 4, A and B) was consistent with the transcriptional role of IRF3 in induction of Ifnb. However, the finding of phosphorylated IRF3 in the ER (Fig. 4D) and mitochondria (Fig. 4E) was unexpected and prompted us to search for ER- and mitochondria-specific binding partners of IRF3. It has been reported that during viral infections, IRF3 associates with ER via binding to Stimulator of IFN Gene (STING, alias Tmem173 or MPYS), an adaptor protein residing in the ER membrane. We found that a single administration of CCl4 in vivo resulted in a significant increase in STING in whole cell liver lysates (Fig. 4F) and in ER extracts (Fig. 4H) after a pulldown with IRF3 antibody, suggesting an association between IRF3 and STING in the liver of mice exposed to CCl4. Based on the recent report that IRF3 plays a key role in virally mediated apoptosis mediated by Bax (6.Chattopadhyay S. Marques J.T. Yamashita M. Peters K.L. Smith K. Desai A. Williams B.R. Sen G.C. Viral apoptosis is induced by IRF-3-mediated activation of Bax.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 1762-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and on our previous report data that IRF3 is required for hepatocyte apoptosis triggered by FasL (8.Petrasek J. Iracheta-Vellve A. Csak T. Satishchandran A. Kodys K. Kurt-Jones E.A. Fitzgerald K.A. Szabo G. STING-IRF3 pathway links endoplasmic reticulum stress with hepatocyte apoptosis in early alcoholic liver disease.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 16544-16549Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that IRF3 would associate with pro-apoptotic proteins involved in the intrinsic, mitochondrial pathway of hepatocytes apoptosis. We found an increased association between IRF3 and Bax at 2 h after administration of CCl4 (Fig. 4I), followed by Casp-8 activation and apoptosis (Fig. 4, J and K). The timing of this association correlates with the increased presence of phosphorylated IRF3 in the mitochondrial fraction, suggesting that only active and phosphorylated IRF3 has a pro-apoptotic role when found in the mitochondria. Moreover, the presence of phosphorylated IRF3 in the mitochondria and its association with BAX coincided with activation and cleavage of the initiator caspase-8 and the executioner caspase-3 (Fig. 4J). Our data suggest that ER stress and phosphorylation of IRF3 (Fig. 2, A and C), which occurred within 1 h, was followed by pro-apoptotic signaling and hepatocyte damage (Fig. 4, I, J, and K), which were established within 2 h. Taken together, our data indicated that following acute administration of CCl4, IRF3 interacts with the ER-associated protein, STING, and with the pro-apoptotic molecule, Bax. Importantly, the association of IRF3 with STING or phospho-TBK1 in the ER occurred within the first 2 h after CCl4 administration (Fig. 4, F–H), concurrent with phosphorylation of IRF3 and up-regulation of Ifnb in the liver (Fig. 2, C and D); all of these events occurred prior to the development of significant liver injury (Fig. 3). Acute CCl4-induced liver injury resulted in ER stress and IRF3 activation, as well as early localization of IRF3 in the ER in association with STING, an ER-adaptor protein. Furthermore, IRF3 demonstrated a pathogenic role, independent of the TLR4-adaptor complex, in models of acute or chronic CCl4-induced liver injuries, we then hypothesized that activation of IRF3 was through STING after chronic CCl4 administration in mice. In support of this hypothesis, we observed that Tmem173Gt mice, which lack the STING protein (21.Sauer J.-D. Sotelo-Troha K. von Moltke J. Monroe K.M. Rae C.S. Brubaker S.W. Hyodo M. Hayakawa Y.

Further, STING-deficient mice (Tmem173Gt) showed protection from liver fibrosis (Fig. 5C), as well as a decrease in deposition α-SMA and type 1 collagen protein in the liver (Fig. 5, D and E) and expression of pro-fibrogenic markers (Fig. 5F). IRF3 is the transcription factor responsible for type I IFN production, a pro-inflammatory cytokine important in creating an antiviral state. In addition to IRF3, IRF7 is another major regulator of type I IFN production (22.Servant M.J. Tenoever B. Lin R. Overlapping and distinct mechanisms regulating IRF-3 and IRF-7 function.J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Administration of CCl4 resulted in significantly up-regulated Ifnb1 and the IFN-inducible gene Isg15 in the liver in WT mice, whereas IRF3-deficient mice lacked induction of type I IFN genes (Fig. 1F). However, IRF7 or type I IFNs did not mediate the pathogenic effect of IRF3 in the liver as demonstrated by a lack of protection from liver injury (Fig. 5, H and I) and fibrosis (Fig. 5, J and K) in IRF7- or IFNAR1-KO mice, respectively. The lack of type I IFN induction or signaling in INFAR1-KO mice resulted in aggravated liver fibrosis, as demonstrated by increased Sirius Red area (Fig. 5J) and augmented expression of Acta2 and Col1a2 (Fig. 5K) compared with WT mice, which is consistent with the previously reported anti-fibrotic role of type I IFNs (23.Roh Y.S. Park S. Kim J.W. Lim C.W. Seki E. Kim B.

Taken together, these data implied that IRF3, but not IRF7 or type I IFN signaling, plays a pathogenic role in chronic liver injury and fibrosis induced by chronic CCl4 administration. In addition, the data demonstrate the pathogenic role of STING, a binding partner of IRF3 (Fig. 4 and Ref. 25.Liu S. Cai X. Wu J. Cong Q. Chen X. Li T. Du F. Ren J. Wu Y.-T.T. Grishin N.V. Chen Z.J. Phosphorylation of innate immune adaptor proteins MAVS, STING, and TRIF induces IRF3 activation.Science. 2015; 347: aaa2630Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar), as a determinant in the development of liver injury and fibrosis in this model. To further characterize the role of STING in mediating the CCl4-induced liver injury in the chronic CCl4 model, we evaluated phosphorylation of TBK1 and IRF3. After 6 weeks of exposure to CCl4, STING-deficient mice had decreased phosphorylation of TBK1 (Fig. 6A), as well as decreased phosphorylation of IRF3 (Fig. 6B) compared with WT mice. Previous reports have studied the pro-apoptotic association of IRF3 with Bax. To test whether STING-mediated activation of IRF3 results in pro-apoptotic signaling, we tested caspase activation in STING-deficient mice using the chronic CCl4-mediated liver injury model. We found that STING-deficient mice (Tmem173Gt) given a 6-week regimen of CCl4 exhibited a significant reduction in the cleavage and activation of the apoptosis initiator caspase-8 (Fig. 6C) and the apoptosis executioner caspase-3 (Fig. 6D) compared with WT mice. These data were consistent with the association between IRF3, STING, and Bax that we found in the liver following a single exposure to CCl4 (Fig. 4, H and I) and indicated the possibility that ER stress may be a source of IRF3 activation in this model. In addition, these data also supported the possibility that in the chronic model of CCl4-induced liver injury and fibrosis, IRF3 represents an activator of pro-apoptotic signaling in the liver. To further explore the mechanism of cell death and liver injury and to test whether induction of cell death in the acute CCl4 liver injury model was mediated by STING, we evaluated activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3 in mouse livers. We found that caspase-8 and -3 were both activated at 8 and 12 h after CCl4 injection in WT mice (Fig. 7, A and B), whereas the STING-deficient mice (Tmem173Gt) had a complete absence of cleaved caspases (Fig. 7, C and D). To better understand the underlying mechanism behind the protection observed in mice deficient in either IRF3 or STING in a chronic CCl4 injury, we tested the dynamics of hepatocyte damage by comparing WT mice with Tmem173Gt mice during an acute CCl4 liver injury. We found protection from liver injury in STING-deficient mice (Tmem173Gt) after CCl4 administration as seen by serum ALT and H&E histology (Fig. 7, E and F). WT mice exhibited extensive necrosis at 12 h, peaking at 24 h, as seen by irregular histological morphology, whereas the STING-deficient mice did not (Fig. 7F). Surprisingly, we found that one dose of CCl4 was sufficient to elicit a pro-fibrogenic response in WT mice as early as 24 h after injection (Fig. 7, G and H). In comparison with WT mice, the STING-deficient mice (Tmem173Gt) were protected from this early pro-fibrogenic response in the liver. Our data established that CCl4-mediated ER stress occurred primarily in hepatocytes and that phospho-IRF3 after ER stress occurs in primary hepatocytes (Fig. 2, B and C). To assess which liver cell type is responsible for IRF3 phosphorylation and caspase activation after CCl4 administration in vivo, we isolated LMNCs, HSCs, and primary hepatocytes from mouse livers 9 h post CCl4 injection. We found that phosphorylation of IRF3 occurred predominantly in hepatocytes and not in LMNCs or HSCs (Fig. 7I). In assessing cell type-specific contribution to apoptotic signaling, we found increased Casp-8 cleavage in hepatocytes but not in HSCs or LMNCs. Similarly, there was an increase in cas"

Skeletal muscle is a major site of glucose disposal, and the role of aging-associated inflammation in skeletal muscle insulin resistance remains unclear. To investigate, we examined glucose metabolism in 18-mo-old transgenic mice with muscle-specific overexpression of IL-10 (MIL10) and in wild-type mice during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamping. Despite similar fat mass and energy balance, MIL10 mice were protected from aging-associated insulin resistance with significant increases in glucose infusion rates, whole-body glucose turnover, and skeletal muscle glucose uptake (~60%; P <0.05), as compared to age-matched WT mice. This protective effect was associated with decreased muscle inflammation, but no changes in adipose tissue inflammation in aging MIL10 mice. These results demonstrate the importance of skeletal muscle inflammation in aging-mediated insulin resistance, and our findings further implicate a potential therapeutic role of anti-inflammatory cytokine in the treatment of aging-mediated insulin resistance.—Dagdeviren, S., Jung, D.

https://openalex.org/W2537202170,"The functional integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier relies on tight coordination of cell proliferation and migration, with failure to regulate these processes resulting in disease. It is not known whether cell proliferation is sufficient to drive epithelial cell migration during homoeostatic turnover of the epithelium. Nor is it known precisely how villus cell migration is affected when proliferation is perturbed. Some reports suggest that proliferation and migration may not be related while other studies support a direct relationship. We used established cell-tracking methods based on thymine analog cell labeling and developed tailored mathematical models to quantify cell proliferation and migration under normal conditions and when proliferation is reduced and when it is temporarily halted. We found that epithelial cell migration velocities along the villi are coupled to cell proliferation rates within the crypts in all conditions. Furthermore, halting and resuming proliferation results in the synchronized response of cell migration on the villi. We conclude that cell proliferation within the crypt is the primary force that drives cell migration along the villus. This methodology can be applied to interrogate intestinal epithelial dynamics and characterize situations in which processes involved in cell turnover become uncoupled, including pharmacological treatments and disease models.—Parker, A., Maclaren, O.

https://openalex.org/W2546853087,"The ability to adapt cellular metabolism to nutrient availability is critical for survival. The liver plays a central role in the adaptation to starvation by switching from glucose-consuming processes and lipid synthesis to providing energy substrates like glucose to the organism. Here we report a previously unrecognized role of the tumor suppressor p53 in the physiologic adaptation to food withdrawal. We found that starvation robustly increases p53 protein in mouse liver. This induction was posttranscriptional and mediated by a hepatocyte-autonomous and AMP-activated protein kinase-dependent mechanism. p53 stabilization was required for the adaptive expression of genes involved in amino acid catabolism. Indeed, acute deletion of p53 in livers of adult mice impaired hepatic glycogen storage and induced steatosis. Upon food withdrawal, p53-deleted mice became hypoglycemic and showed defects in the starvation-associated utilization of hepatic amino acids. In summary, we provide novel evidence for a p53-dependent integration of acute changes of cellular energy status and the metabolic adaptation to starvation. Because of its tumor suppressor function, p53 stabilization by starvation could have implications for both metabolic and oncological diseases of the liver.-Prokesch, A., Graef, F.

However, its poor water solubility and it sensitivity to several environmental factors avoid its use in applications like pharmaceutical and cosmetic. In this work, we synthetized morin-modified mesoporous silica nanoparticles (AMSNPs-MOR) as useful material to be used as potential nanoantioxidant. To achieve this, we characterized its adsorption kinetics, isotherm and the antioxidant capacity as hydroxyl radical (HO•) scavenger and singlet oxygen (1O2) quencher. The experimental data could be well fitted with Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin isotherm models, besides the pseudo-second order kinetics model. The total quenching rate constant obtained for singlet oxygen deactivation by AMSNPs-MOR was one order of magnitude lower than the morin rate constant reported previously in neat solvents and lipid membranes. The AMSNPs-MOR have good antioxidant properties by itself and exhibit a synergic effect with morin on the antioxidant property against hydroxyl radical. This effect, in the range of concentrations studied, was increased when the amount of morin adsorbed increased."

Whereas current data support the notion that, in pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs), expression of transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is increased, the role of HIF-1α in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) remains controversial. This study investigates the hypothesis that, in PASMCs from patients with PAH, decreases in HIF-1α expression and activity underlie augmented pulmonary vascular contractility. PASMCs and tissues were isolated from nonhypertensive control patients and patients with PAH. Compared with controls, HIF-1α and Kv1.5 protein expression were decreased in PAH smooth muscle cells (primary culture). Myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation and MLC kinase (MLCK) activity-major determinants of vascular tone-were increased in patients with PAH. Cofactors involved in prolyl hydroxylase domain activity were increased in PAH smooth muscle cells. Functionally, PASMC contractility was inversely correlated with HIF-1α activity. In PASMCs derived from patients with PAH, HIF-1α expression is decreased, and MLCK activity, MLC phosphorylation, and cell contraction are increased. We conclude that compromised PASMC HIF-1α expression may contribute to the increased tone that characterizes pulmonary hypertension.-Barnes, E. A., Chen, C.-H., Sedan, O., Cornfield, D. N.

We aimed to develop a screening model to effectively differentiate pregnancies post-conization into low- and high-risk for preterm birth, and to evaluate the impact of suture material on the efficacy of ultrasound indicated cervical cerclage. We analysed longitudinal cervical length (CL) data from 725 pregnant women post-conization attending preterm surveillance clinics at three London university Hospitals over a ten year period (2004-2014). Rates of preterm birth <37 weeks after targeted cerclage for CL<25mm were compared with local and national background rates and expected rates for this cohort. Rates for cerclage using monofilament or braided suture material were also compared. Of 725 women post-conization 13.5% (98/725) received an ultrasound indicated cerclage and 9.7% (70/725) delivered prematurely, <37weeks; 24.5% (24/98) of these despite insertion of cerclage. The preterm birth rate was lower for those that had monofilament (9/60, 15%) versus braided (15/38, 40%) cerclage (RR 0.7, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.94, P = 0.008). Accuracy parameters of interval reduction in CL between longitudinal second trimester screenings were calculated to identify women at low risk of preterm birth, who could safely discontinue surveillance. A reduction of CL <10% between screening timepoints predicts term birth, >37weeks. Our triage model enables timely discharge of low risk women, eliminating 36% of unnecessary follow-up CL scans. We demonstrate that preterm birth in women post-conization may be reduced by targeted cervical cerclage. Cerclage efficacy is however suture material-dependant: monofilament is preferable to braided suture. The introduction of triage prediction models has the potential to reduce the number of unnecessary CL scan for women at low risk of preterm birth."

In this study, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based screening of ~4800 druggable genes in 3-dimensional CSLC cultures in comparison to 2-dimensional bulk cultures of U87 glioma cells revealed 3 groups of genes essential for the following: survival of the CSLC population only, bulk-cultured population only, or both populations. While diverse biologic processes were associated with siRNAs reducing the bulk-cultured population, CSLC-eliminating siRNAs were enriched in a few functional categories, such as lipid metabolism, protein metabolism, and gene expression. Interestingly, siRNAs that selectively reduced CSLC only were found to target genes for cholesterol and unsaturated fatty acid synthesis. The lipidomic profile of CSLCs revealed increased levels of monounsaturated lipids. Pharmacologic blockage of these target pathways reduced CSLCs, and this effect was eliminated by addition of downstream metabolite products.

The expression of pox (pyruvate oxidase) and cydABCD operon (cytochrome bd oxidase complex) was quantified by quantitative Real Time polymerase chain reaction. Respiration increased biomass production compared to anaerobiosis and unsupplemented aerobiosis, and altered the central metabolism rerouting pyruvate away from lactate accumulation. All enzymatic activities, except lactate dehydrogenase, were higher in respiratory cultures, while unsupplemented aerobiosis with 60% of DO promoted H2O2 and free radical accumulation. Respiration improved the survival to oxidative and freeze-drying stresses, while significant numbers of dead, damaged and viable but not cultivable cells were found in unsupplemented aerobic cultures (60% DO). Analysis of gene expression suggested that the activation of aerobic and respiratory pathways occurred during the exponential growth phase, and that O2 and hemin induced, respectively, the transcription of pox and cydABCD genes.

However, there is no evidence of this association in a free-living population. Objectives We assessed the association between the altitude where each participant of a Spanish cohort (the SUN Project) was living and the incidence of overweight/obesity. Methods The SUN Project is a dynamic, prospective, multipurpose cohort of Spanish university graduates with a retention rate of 89%. We included in the analysis 9 365 participants free of overweight/obesity at baseline. At the baseline questionnaire, participants reported their postal code and the time they had been living in their city/village. We imputed the altitude of each postal code according to the data of the Spanish National Cartographic Institute and categorized participants in tertiles. We used Cox regression models to adjust for potential confounding variables. Results During a median follow-up of 10 years, we identified 2 156 incident cases of overweight/obesity. After adjusting for sex, age, time of residence at current city, baseline body mass index, physical activity, sedentarism and years of education (≤ 3 years, ≥ 4 years, Master/PhD), those participants in the third tertile (>456 m) exhibited a statistically significant 14% reduction in the risk of developing overweight/obesity in comparison to those in the first tertile (<124 m) (adjusted HR = 0.86; 95% CI: 0.77, 0.96).

Understanding how our brain works—and how we use this to tackle a myriad of brain diseases—is one of the biggest challenges facing humanity. Beyond the long-standing genomics and proteomics databases, large-scale federal initiatives, like the BRAIN initiative and the Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI), are stimulating innovative research producing complex datasets containing the unique patterns that hold the clues to our understanding of human disease and brain function (Bargmann and Newsome, 2014Bargmann C.I. Newsome W.T. JAMA Neurol. 2014; 71: 675-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Significant computational power and expertise are required to tackle this growing big data challenge, and modelers are working around the clock to stay ahead of the staggering amount of data being generated globally (Sejnowski et al., 2014Sejnowski T.J. Churchland P.S. Movshon J.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 1440-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Bioinformaticians and modelers emerging from the systems’ biology, math, and physics communities—coupled with the expansion of the technology sector in the last decade—have produced tools to help us begin to crack the brain code. However, they have yet to span the sizeable gulf between the scientists producing the data and the planet full of people who may be capable of helping to analyze it. Overcoming the challenge of data hosting and storage developing of an international cloud interface is proposed elsewhere (Neuro Cloud Consortium, 2016Neuro Cloud ConsortiumNeuron. 2016; 92 (this issue): 621-627Google Scholar). Here, we are more concerned with how we will find needles of understanding in the data haystack. Advice on how to get there comes from a popular source, President Barack Obama (Obama, 2016, Frontiers conference): “The most important curator to be able to sort through what’s true and false and sustain those scientific values is the human brain.” Historically, solving large-scale data challenges has required relying on a highly trained data science and computational workforce. A new global workforce is now emerging that reaches out to tap into the ingenuity of people who are interested in solving scientific problems but whose talents often lie beyond the fringes of classical academic disciplinary training. This idea of “crowdsourcing” to develop new access routes to engage anyone with motivation and a computer to help science tackle its biggest scientific challenges is finally entering the mainstream across multiple disciplines (reviewed in Saez-Rodriguez et al., 2016Saez-Rodriguez J. Costello J.C. Friend S.H. Kellen M.R. Mangravite L. Meyer P. Norman T. Stolovitzky G. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2016; 17: 470-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This idea of using crowdsourcing talent to bring “non-traditional experts” together with experts and finding unexpected talent to discover novel solutions to scientific challenges is not new. The award-winning novel Longitude depicts the story of unknown clockmaker John Harrison, who was awarded the British Board of Longitude Prize (in 1714) for inventing the prototype of the marine chronometer, solving what was undoubtedly the most important technological challenge in navigation for the British Empire—determining the longitude of a ship at sea. Similarly (depicted in Oscar-winning film The Imitation Game), the development of the Enigma machine occurred after Alan Turing recruited creative problem solvers (many of whom were women whose career paths had not allowed them access to the hallowed halls of academia) by placing puzzles in newspapers to recruit “lay” alternative thinkers to the teams of mathematicians he had assembled. Collectively, experts and non-experts collaborated and were instrumental in turning the tide in WWII. We all know talented people who could probably change the world if only they had the opportunity; insight and inventiveness are not the exclusive domain of those tenacious enough to be awarded a Ph.D. The broad global reach of the internet has opened up a superhighway of opportunity to people previously excluded from academic science and allowed us to design ways to take large-scale science challenges to the global marketplace instead of hoping they will find us. This growing field—citizen science—engages people from beyond the traditional academic arena either to collect and generate data or to contribute as individuals or teams to analyze it. In the US, the charge to expand citizen science (people-powered research science [PPRS]) to fuel innovation has been led by President Obama. In addition to installing a rain gauge for a citizen science climate project in the First Lady’s garden, the Office of Science Technology Policy (OSTP) has developed a toolkit to assist scientists in entering citizen science (https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/12/02/designing-citizen-science-and-crowdsourcing-toolkit-federal-government) and a website (https://www.citizenscience.gov/) for expanding the practice. This website hosts links to over 300 different citizen science projects in extremely diverse areas, such as astronomy, environmental conservation, genomics, and technology innovation. A forum hosted by the OSTP at the White House, “Open Science and Innovation: Of the People, By the People, For the People,” recently drew together a diverse array of scientists representing projects in conservation, climate science, environmental monitoring, proteomics, and neuroscience to share approaches, tools, challenges, and best practices and to combine expertise to create a synergy that could bring crowdsourcing more broadly into the scientific mainstream (https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/09/30/accelerating-use-citizen-science-and-crowdsourcing-address-societal-and-scientific). This forum highlighted how science and society can progress on multiple levels symbiotically if we build the inroads that empower learners of all ages to engage in solving society’s biggest problems, and we re-direct their findings back into the scientific mainstream. At the White House Frontiers conference on October 13, 2016 that he hosted as the guest editor of Wired magazine, the President also highlighted how opening big data into the right hands can drive progress in scientific, educational, and economic ways:Whether it’s releasing big data—and the easiest example, I think, for the general public to think about is all the apps that now give us the weather over our phones, and those are all generated from inside government, but what used to be closed data now we let out there. Well, it turns out that we’ve got huge data sets on all kinds of stuff. And the more we’re opening that up and allowing businesses, individuals, to work with that information I think the more they feel empowered. And that makes a huge difference.—President Barack Obama By taking scientific challenges online in stimulating ways, we tap into the intellectual energy of the planet by creating access to people of all ages who have the potential for making discoveries from open shared data. In doing so, the brightest minds from all societies and vocations have the chance to contribute, vastly expanding the diverse talent pool that we need to come up with new solutions to our biggest questions. As a result of creating online avenues, we level the scientific playing field, science progresses faster, and everyone gets to play a role and learn, reflected again in the words of President Obama (on online science tools and STEM, October 2016): “We are working to help all of our children understand that they, too, have a place in science and tech—not just boys in hoodies, but girls on Native American reservations and kids whose parents can’t afford personal tutors. We want Jamal and Maria sitting right next to Jimmy and Johnny—because we don't want them overlooked for a job of the future.” Two pioneering approaches to accelerate and expand scientific discoveries in astronomy (Galaxy Zoo; https://www.galaxyzoo.org/) and protein folding (Foldit; http://www.fold.it) have led the way in taking crowdsourcing in the hard science arena to a new level. Galaxy Zoo—launched in 2007 by Chris Lintott (Oxford University) and colleagues—originally began by taking almost one million images generated from the Sloan Sky survey and making them available to participants to begin to classify. By engaging renowned astronomers in developing a tutorial of identification and morphological tracing and classification, players across the globe were able to become adept at identifying different classes of galaxies depicted by celestial images (Clery, 2011Clery D. Science. 2011; 333: 173-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Initially, simply aimed at identification and classification, the site received a deluge of over 70,000 classifications/hr within 24 hr of launch, and—with multiple eyes on each galaxy—classifications were deemed equal or superior to those of professional astronomers. The type of problem was ideally suited for crowdsourcing because people can easily observe images and find specific features with minimal training. The entire community continues to rapidly piece together an understanding of the universe, accelerating the pace of discovery far beyond the capabilities of the astronomy community. The project has since enabled people to view different types of datasets contributed from a wider variety of sources using different technologies (including recent publications from the Hubble telescope). Galaxy Zoo has produced over 50 publications from crowdsourced data, opened new avenues of discovery for astronomers, and inspired a whole new generation of amateur astronomers with the power to explore the universe through the eye of digital data without needing high-tech telescopes (https://www.zooniverse.org/about/publications). The Galaxy Zoo team has now branched out to host a variety of scientific crowdsourcing challenges on their Zooniverse website (https://www.zooniverse.org/). Many other scientific problems require sophisticated problem-solving skills that are honed through years of training during college and graduate school. Foldit, a biochemistry scientific discovery game, has shown that very deep expertise can be collectively developed with people without any prior knowledge of the scientific discipline. While the path to expertise is drastically decreased compared to the standard academic track, people still need time to hone highly specialized skills aimed at solving a specific science problem. To enable this expertise development, Foldit was developed as an online game to maximize the long-term engagements of “solvers” who collaborate on solving problems in proteomics in order to develop their expertise (Horowitz et al., 2016Horowitz S.

Commun. 2016; 7: 12549https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms12549Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). By using game design elements to provide a personalized and scaffolded way to build scientific skills, Foldit has developed experts that outperform world-class laboratories in predicting protein structures and even designing new proteins not yet invented by nature. Developed at the Center for Game Science at the University of Washington (UW) with proteomics expertise from the lab of David Baker, a UW Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) investigator, the Foldit game is continually evolving to maximize the collective problem-solving ability of its community. Foldit players have been successful in solving a range of proteomics challenges that predict the three-dimensional state of proteins. The game presents protein-folding problems as weekly puzzles for players to solve and gives players a variety of computational tools, collaboration mechanisms, and visualizations at their disposal. Updates to the game allow the development team to quickly react to the analysis of the results of scientific experiments in the game as well as player engagement metrics. The game is effectively allowing co-adaptation of computational tools (Foldit game) and game-developed experts so that together they can solve increasingly more challenging scientific problems. The game was released in 2008 and since then has had over a half million players. The success of Foldit has depended on the active and ongoing engagement of the scientific community—an active protein-folding community of experts and “new experts” is centered on the game, some members of which have been involved for years. The game has attracted and retained players from a wide variety of science and non-science backgrounds; 18 of the 20 highest-ranked Foldit players had not had any experience with biochemistry prior to playing the game, attesting to the game’s ability to develop experts from novices. It also produces results that continue to have impact even years later: 57,000 of Foldit’s players have produced useful results that matched or outperformed algorithmically computed solutions. Foldit players have achieved and led a number of significant discoveries, many of which have been published in some of the most respected scientific journals (e.g., Nature and PNAS) (Cooper et al., 2010Cooper S. Khatib F. Treuille A. Barbero J. Lee J. Beenen M. Leaver-Fay A. Baker D. Popović Z. Players F. Nature. 2010; 466: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar, Gilski et al., 2011Gilski M. Kazmierczyk M. Krzywda S. Zábranská H. Cooper S. Popović Z. Khatib F. DiMaio F. Thompson J. Baker D. et al.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

USA. 2011; 108: 18949-18953Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). For example, game-based experts resolved a long-standing scientific problem: in less than 10 days, the Foldit community was able to resolve the structure of an HIV coat protein that had remained unsolved by scientists for 15 years (Khatib et al., 2011bKhatib F.

Biol. 2011; 18: 1175-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Perhaps more importantly, computational strategies from the teams engaged have been shown to be on par with state-of-the-art biochemistry optimization methods. Both of these are evidence that a well-designed science gaming platform can be truly revolutionary beyond its initial goals by creating a new cadre of domain experts to solve complex problems, in which human intuition and learning can outperform computer algorithms. By some estimates, Foldit has increased the worldwide proteomics research community by a factor of four. Increasing awareness of the prevalence of brain disorders in society has produced a potential global workforce that is highly motivated to learn about the brain and contribute to brain research, but most have little or no direct access to the corridors of neuroscience power that would give them the chance to do this. On the other hand, neuroscientists are generating terabytes a day of imaging, transcriptomic, and physiology data that they are increasingly willing to share openly. But there is a growing backlog in progress because of the lack of effective or freely available programs or manpower for analysis. Bringing these sides together around questions best suited for human insight and intuition will not only reduce the bottleneck and fuel progress, but also give us the chance to develop a whole new generation of neuroscientists of all ages. Global neuroscience becomes not just about sharing each other’s data, but combining our shared talents to decipher and understand it. Eyewire (http://eyewire.org/explore) was the first neuroscience game to achieve success in engaging an international community. Players were originally given densely detailed sequential electron microscopy (EM) images of the retina and had to move from one image to another, following the contour of neurons and labeling different parts to illuminate them within the matrix of the electron micrograph. Despite the relatively laborious nature of the task, since 2010, Eyewire has attracted the attention of over 250,000 players from 145 different countries, who have helped contribute to the first-ever 3D reconstruction of high-resolution networks of cells within the mouse retina (Helmstaedter et al., 2013Helmstaedter M. Briggman K.L. Turaga S.C. Jain V. Seung H.S. Denk W. Nature. 2013; 500: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Over time, improved gaming techniques have enhanced this process to make the game more interactive and increase player retention. In doing so, Eyewire laid the groundwork for public online engagement in neuroscience research and developed the “ground truth” data needed to develop a new generation of artificial intelligence (AI) tools that are now a core essential component of large-scale projects to produce micro-scale mapping of the cortex. The early scientific success of Eyewire is not only because it engaged a broad community of people, but because its original data was produced using highly standardized protocols from a renowned lab. The next generation of Eyewire, Neo—due to be released in 2017—will move on from its success in the light-sensing retinal circuit to the termination of the visual pathway—V1 of the visual cortex. Clinical neuroscience has also benefited from crowdsourcing in the form of challenges (collaborative competitions), where the computational community is challenged to devise and submit proposed analyses to expert-provided patient-centric big data problems. The large databanks for challenges are made up of openly shared clinical data sourced from multiple sites hosted on a common platform and used to attract a broader community charged with developing new ways to find the gold in the midst of the data mines. In the biomedical research arena, this approach has been pioneered by the team at Sage Bionetworks (http://sagebase.org/), who has used its Synapse Open Data sharing platform to collaborate with IBM’s Gustavo Stolovitzky to host DREAM challenges (http://sagebase.org/challenges/). Their wide range of health data-driven challenges have recently included neurological disease. In two distinct DREAM ALS challenges to help advance our understanding of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) progression, participants were challenged to develop new models to predict not just the future progression of disease in ALS patients based on the patient’s current disease status, but also to stratify (tinyurl.com/DREAMALS) based on clinical sub-criteria. Data were provided from more than 9,000 patient histories, including demographics, medical and family history data, functional measures, vital signs, and lab data. In total, this project comprised more than 100 scientists (about 20 organizers and 80 participants in 30 teams). Algorithms developed from these challenges have successfully produced predictive machine learning models that perform substantially better than clinical experts and can reduce the variance of the disease predictability so that new drugs that slow ALS can potentially be identified with smaller trials (Küffner et al., 2015Küffner R. Zach N. Norel R. Hawe J. Schoenfeld D. Wang L. Li G. Fang L. Mackey L. Hardiman O. et al.Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). By finding new ways to analyze massive clinical data from 20 finished trials, the challenges also detected new biomarkers and defined new subgroups for stratification, i.e., to assign a patient to a disease subtype and determine perhaps whether he/she would be a responder or no responder for a given treatment. Their Alzheimer’s disease (AD) DREAM challenge, however, revealed some of the inevitable problems with using disparate datasets. Designed to provide an unbiased assessment of our current capability for estimating cognition and prediction of cognitive decline using genetic and imaging data from public data resources, 527 individuals from around the world registered to participate. 56 teams (each with one or more people) submitted models to the leaderboards, but—unlike the ALS challenge—predictive performance across all criteria was modest and less definitive (Allen et al., 2016Allen G.I. Amoroso N. Anghel C. Balagurusamy V. Bare C.J. Beaton D. Bellotti R. Bennett D.A. Boehme K.L. Boutros P.C. et al.Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging InitiativeAlzheimers Dement. 2016; 12: 645-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Rather than a failure of the submitted modeling methods, the analyses suggested that data used to address these questions were inadequate to support the tasks. A cautionary tale for assuming that all clinical data can be put into one pot, the challenge confirmed that mandates and guidelines on data sharing, considerations of standardized data collection and processing, and mechanisms to integrate heterogeneous data will be necessary to address issues related to highly complex diseases. How many different cells exist in a mouse or human brain? Although Santiago Ramón y Cajal was awarded the Nobel Prize over 100 years ago for his pioneering work in neuroanatomy, we still lack a modern classification of neuronal cell types based on a deep understanding of their 3D structure and related function (DeFelipe et al., 2013DeFelipe J. López-Cruz P.L. Benavides-Piccione R. Bielza C. Larrañaga P. Anderson S. Burkhalter A. Cauli B. Fairén A. Feldmeyer D. et al.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2013; 14: 202-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Led by the BRAIN initiative (Jorgenson et al., 2015Jorgenson L.A. Newsome W.T. Anderson D.J. Bargmann C.I. Brown E.N. Deisseroth K. Donoghue J.P. Hudson K.L. Ling G.S. MacLeish P.R. et al.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2015; 370: 370Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar), new technologies from a variety of different global brain projects are fueling the production of many terabytes of data a day to answer this question, but neuroscientists are hitting successive roadblocks in combining and analyzing these datasets. Eyewire developed an approach for the highest (EM) resolution level of connectomics, but many other types of mega-data hold the answers to more extensive questions in brain structure and function; however, there are significant obstacles in the analysis and integration of these different data modalities. Even with new federal funding now available from multiple sources (e.g., BD2K, BRAIN) to support integrating data analysis efforts, the neuroscience community is not currently equipped to perform all the ground truth validation needed for basic data analysis before feeding it into more complex models. Can we begin by using a game-based neuroscience community approach to figure out how we bring together complex 3D morphologies of different neurons with their distinct genetic programs and activity of the circuits to which they belong? We believe that many neuroscience questions are amenable to a community-based approach to analysis, but given its novelty, a series of challenges must be overcome to make this practice more widespread (see Box 1).Box 1ChallengesNeuroscience problems that are amendable to the crowdsourcing approach fit into two main categories: (1) reconstruction of models from massive amounts of raw data, addressing the issue of increasing disparity between data collection speed and reconstruction speed, and (2) development of functional models of neural structures that use the structure and messaging information between neurons to explain different aspects of how brain works. Both of these require new experts to gain experience and expertise in many aspects of neuroscience scientific research pipeline so it is not enough to just attract new citizen scientists into the community, but to develop them over time into strong contributors to discovery. For either of these, we need to build a common infrastructure that can help every current neuroscience project with the new citizen neuroscience community. Since these two categories touch practically all aspects of neuroscience, they will require dedicated funding to realize. This includes:•The development of open common data sharing platforms that are easily accessible and navigable by experts and non-experts alike.•Establishment of data standards for “acceptability” of data from content partners that can be reviewed and applied in an unbiased way.•Fast feedback loops on the outcomes through open sharing of best practices across projects so that mistakes don’t get made, and repeated, and so that promising directions get pursued in parallel by the entire community.•The creation of a new apprenticeship and accreditation pathways for expertise developed and proven through contributions by citizen neuroscientists. There is no reason why strong citizen contributors should not get a paid for their amazing productivity and contribution to discoveries.•The creation of more rapid scaffolding and learning structures that can speed up expertise acquisition.•Development of a new breed of computer algorithms that symbiotically use the best of human and computer skills toward solving problems that neither humans nor computers can currently address.•The opening up of restrictions on equal internet access to people of all countries to ensure the success of crowdsourced science and global science.

The 3D shape of a neuronal soma with dendritic and axonal arbors is a core representation of its identity (phenotype), connectivity, synaptic integration, firing properties, and—ultimately—its role in the neural circuit, but we still lack robust ways to analyze even “normal” neurons in sufficient quantities to develop a frame of reference for when things are not working. This has certainly been aided by online resources, like Neuromorpho (http://neuromorpho.org/), that have provided a place for individual labs to upload their images and reconstructions, but we still lack a common platform for robust comparative analysis. Understanding neuronal diversity through capturing 3D morphology in vivo, and classifying each neuron according to form and function, will make a fundamentally important contribution toward our understanding of brain function and dysfunction. This is why a detailed classification of neuronal subtypes—including morphology and transcriptomics—is one of the lead programs of the BRAIN initiative"
https://openalex.org/W2548462833,"The pyruvate kinase (PK) is a rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme catalyzing the dephosphorylation of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate, yielding one molecule of ATP. The M2 isoform of PK (PKM2) is predominantly expressed in normal proliferating cells and tumors, and both metabolic and non-metabolic activities for the enzyme in promoting tumor cell proliferation have been identified. However, the exact roles of PKM2 in tumor initiation, growth and maintenance are not yet fully understood. Using immunoprecipitation-coupled LC-MS/MS in MCF7 cells exposed to DNA-damaging agent, we report that the nuclear PKM2 interacts directly with P53 protein, a critical safeguard for genome stability. Specifically, PKM2 inhibits P53-dependent transactivation of the P21 gene by preventing P53 binding to the P21 promoter, leading to a nonstop G1 phase. As a result, PKM2 expression provides a growth advantage for tumor cells in the presence of a DNA damage stimulus. In addition, PKM2 interferes with phosphorylation of P53 at serine 15, known to stimulate P53 activity by the ATM serine/threonine kinase. These findings reveal a new role for PKM2 in modulating the DNA damage response and illustrate a novel mechanism of PKM2 participating in tumorigenesis."

Activists opposed to the use of animals in scientific research are increasingly dominating the public discourse and pressuring government officials to severely limit the scope of the work. Polls show that public support for animal research is in decline. Scientists must respond by engaging with the public and policymakers to explain their research and its importance and by addressing moral concerns and objections. Sound public policy ought to be based on the best knowledge science has to offer. This noble goal is hampered by major gaps between public and scientists’ views on a number of important societal issues (http://www.pewinternet.org/interactives/public-scientists-opinion-gap/). We live in times when large segments of the public deny that humans have evolved over time, that vaccines offer protection against disease, that climate change is mostly due to human activity, or that the use of animals in research can advance the health and well-being of humans, other animals, society, and the environment. Such views are not restricted to the general population. Today, policymakers have no qualms about mocking the value of basic scientific research (https://www.aaas.org/news/basic-research-often-mocked-targeted-budget-cuts-due-lack-public-understanding). A member of the House Committee on Space, Science, and Technology, Rep. Paul Broun, readily announces that “all that stuff I was taught about evolution and embryology and the Big Bang Theory, all that is lies straight from the pit of Hell” (http://articles.latimes.com/2012/oct/07/nation/la-na-nn-paul-broun-evolution-hell-20121007). The latest primary season offered several political candidates who spoke against childhood vaccinations or declared global warming to be a hoax. Pseudo-scientific views increasingly permeate society, including universities, where we now encourage magical thinking by offering patients therapies, such as Reiki, which purportedly work through “vibrational energy … facilitated by light touch, on or slightly off the body, that balances the human biofield” (http://rehab.ucla.edu/body.cfm?id=49). It is against this backdrop of ebullient anti-science that activists opposed to the use of animals in research are increasingly challenging the validity of the science and the ethics of animal research. Opinion polls on the public perception of the use of animals in scientific research suggest that they are making inroads. A Pew Research study from 2015 shows that the general public is now closely divided on this issue: 47% support animal research while 50% oppose it (http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/07/01/chapter-7-opinion-about-the-use-of-animals-in-research/). An identical poll in 2009 revealed 52% in support and 43% in opposition. Thus, support appears to be in decline. In sharp contrast, the scientific consensus is overwhelming and steady—about 90% of scientists support the use of animals in medical research. Remedies that can help alleviate the situation have been offered many times before but have fallen largely on deaf ears. Cornelia Dean, a science writer for the New York Times, rightly complains that “we need to adopt a broader view of what it means for researchers to fulfill their obligations to society. It is not enough for them to make findings and report them in the scholarly literature. As citizens in a democracy, they must engage, and not just when their funding is at stake” (Dean, 2009Dean C. Am I Making Myself Clear? A Scientist’s Guide to Talking to the Public. Harvard University Press, 2009Crossref Google Scholar). John Porter, a former Republican congressman, begged an audience at the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) meeting that “… if the public and policymakers never hear your voices, never see science, never understand its methods, the chance of it being high on the list of national priorities will be very low … You can sit on your fingers or you can go outside your comfort zone and get into the game and make a difference for science … Science needs you. Your country needs you. America needs you fighting for science!” Along similar lines, Alan Alda, an actor who also works to improve scientific communication, lamented during one of his talks at UCLA that “life runs on science, but neither the public nor policymakers know that. Why?” These science commentators are all politely trying to make one central point: the failure of the scientific community to engage in public life is largely to blame for the situation. The good news is that the solution to the problem may rest within our own community. Indeed, when it comes to the debate on animal research, there are some hopeful signs that we have reached a point where an increasing number of scientists are deciding to get out of the laboratory and contribute to the job of educating the public about science, connecting with our representatives, and responding forcefully when the work is mischaracterized, lies propagated, and the character of our scientists smeared. In what follows, we highlight some advances in this direction and propose a number of additional opportunities (summarized in Box 1) where neuroscientists at all levels, from students to principal investigators, can engage in this effort.Box 1Future Directions/Recommendations•Scientists must engage with the public and policymakers to explain their research and its importance and to address moral concerns and objections.•In communicating new findings, we must explain how animals are used, the care they receive, and the ethical considerations embedded in the regulations and the approval process.•In describing new medical breakthroughs, we must explain the basic research that made it possible and provide an idea of the timescales involved in bringing new knowledge into the clinic.•Scientists must organize to provide timely, accurate scientific information when opponents of research misrepresent the science or the nature of animal research.•Scientists must become familiar with the moral arguments against the work and engage in philosophical debate. •Scientists must engage with the public and policymakers to explain their research and its importance and to address moral concerns and objections.•In communicating new findings, we must explain how animals are used, the care they receive, and the ethical considerations embedded in the regulations and the approval process.•In describing new medical breakthroughs, we must explain the basic research that made it possible and provide an idea of the timescales involved in bringing new knowledge into the clinic.•Scientists must organize to provide timely, accurate scientific information when opponents of research misrepresent the science or the nature of animal research.•Scientists must become familiar with the moral arguments against the work and engage in philosophical debate. Explaining the role of animal research in neuroscience may not be as difficult as it may appear. In fact, there is great public interest in science and its discoveries. That interest is on display in movies, on the news, in social media, and in great public curiosity about the brain, about other animals’ cognition and emotions, and about health problems that plague society and ways to address them. It is also the case that most scientists enjoy talking about their work. Telling our students and others about the scientific discoveries from their research is among the “day jobs” of scientists. Good scientists regularly share their work, their findings, and their excitement about why their ideas and the new knowledge they have produced are important. They communicate about research as a matter of course, of training, and of expectation. Published papers, presentations at conferences, departmental seminars, informal discussions with peers and students, funding proposals, teaching, blogging, and speaking to the media—a wide range of communication venues—are full of examples of scientists sharing news about their research. Many scientists are committed to education, and they have both the motivation and skill set to successfully engage in dialog with the public at large and the media. When it comes to animal research, however, there is another layer of information that is critically important to discuss but is not commonly brought to the public. This information includes explaining how animals are cared for in research, the role of the attending veterinarian, how a multi-leveled ethical review system aims to ensure that scientific objectives are balanced with consideration of animal well-being, and why potential alternatives would not provide the same kind of information. While such basic concepts may be obvious to scientists, it is a mistake to assume that they are obvious to others or are unimportant. To appreciate this point, it suffices to ask whether a typical public communication reporting on a scientific finding mentions the basic science behind the work, whether it depicts animals in laboratories (instead of merely pipettes and beakers), or whether it explains why studies of nonhuman animals were necessary and without alternatives. Consider the opportunities missed in stories reported on the development of neural prostheses. Here, we often fail to convey the rich body of basic research conducted in non-human primates that was required for these advances, such as the feasibility of operant conditioning in single cells in motor cortex (Fetz, 1969Fetz E.E. Science. 1969; 163: 955-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), studies of the coding of movement by neuronal populations (Georgopoulos et al., 1986Georgopoulos A.P. Schwartz A.B. Kettner R.E. Science. 1986; 233: 1416-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (1913) Google Scholar), and the emphasis that the initial goal of these studies was to acquire basic knowledge about brain function without a clear medical application in sight. When fundamental points about the need, role, ethical consideration, and care for research animals are neglected in presentation and public communication about scientific discoveries, the context for those discoveries is difficult for others to understand. In absence of understanding, there can be little hope of appreciation for the role of animal studies or basic research in our quest to advance human health. Whose job is it to provide this broader context and basic information? Scientists themselves, many of them educators, are well positioned to act deliberately and thoughtfully in their public communications in order to ensure that the points highlighted above are given an integral place and priority. Scientists should not leave it to chance that professional communicators, press officers, and journalists will view a story with an eye toward including the basic points that make the case for animal studies. It is scientists who can best draw from their knowledge and expertise to share with the public the reasons that animal studies are, and have always been, critically important to discoveries in neuroscience. In doing so, they will meet other critical objectives that must be addressed in order to turn the tide of public understanding and public opinion. Aside from making an effort to highlight the role of animals in research, there is a need to refute various scientific misconceptions that are commonly expressed by opponents of the work. One commonly expressed view is that animal research cannot, even in principle, be used to improve human health. Such complaints are usually accompanied by catchy slogans, such as “if society funds mouse models of cancer, we will find more cures for cancer in mice,” a statement that falls on its face given that recent breakthroughs to treat breast cancer, such as Herceptin, consists of a humanized mouse antibody. Belief in such ideas has driven online petitions that gathered tens of thousands of signatures and demanded investigators to “justify your science” (https://www.change.org/p/animal-experimenters-justify-your-science-claims). The petition is based on the notion that the physiology of animals and humans are too different to allow results from animal research to be extrapolated to humans. Of course, basic knowledge of medical history facts refutes such claim. Unfortunately, it is too often that animal rights activists insist on rewriting history (Morrison, 2002Morrison A.R. Perspect. Biol. Med. 2002; 45: 606-619Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, it is important for members of the scientific community to communicate the history behind their fields and explain how the use of animals in research has contributed to it. Linking the dots for the public, and explaining how new developments are based on the basic knowledge that we gathered over decades, typically through the use of animals in research, is critical to convey the nature of biomedical research. A second infuriating claim made by opponents of animal research is that modern methods exist that can replace the use of animals in research. Of course, it is rather insulting because it implies that scientists know of alternatives but nevertheless prefer to use animals to support their careers and the so-called “vivisection industrial complex” (Almiron and Khazaal, 2015Almiron N. Khazaal N. Am. Behav. Sci. 2015; 60: 256-275Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). As a concrete example, consider the recent letter signed by Jane Goodall and David Attenborough that called for an end to the use of primates in neuroscience research (http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/letters/testing-on-non-human-primates-in-neuroscience-research-is-no-longer-justifiable-a7230071.html). They state that “there has now been sufficient progress in human-based alternatives to call into serious question whether further research of this type is necessary.” In support of their position, they cite an article published by members of Cruelty Free International (CFI), formerly known as the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection, and the same organization that put together the letter. In this article, it is argued that methods like fMRI, EEG, MEG, ECoG, DBS, and electrophysiological recordings in epileptic human patients are sufficient to serve as replacement to any invasive research done with non-human primates. A response by researchers was almost immediate—they responded: “We are disappointed to see that David Attenborough and a number of scientists have been misled by the pseudoscience in the paper by CFI, an organization intent on ending research with all animals, not just primates” (http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/david-attenborough-call-to-end-animal-testing-experiments-on-monkeys-primates-apes-animal-cruelty-a7235771.html). They added, “They have been deceived by the number of animals used in neuroscience procedures, which are a very small proportion of the numbers stated by CFI, and also by the erroneous claim that NHP neuroscience is useless and that recording from seriously ill patients they are being monitored for surgery is somehow a replacement for research in non-human animals.” A separate response, signed by Nobel laureates and other scientists, offered the view that:If we are to effectively combat the scourge of neurodegenerative and other crippling diseases, we will require the careful and considered use of nonhuman primates. Stringent regulations across the developed world exist to ensure that primates are only used where there is no other available model—be that the use of a mouse or a non-animal alternative—and to protect the well-being of those animals still required. The use of primates is not undertaken lightly. However, while not all primate research results in a new treatment, it nonetheless plays a role in developing both the basic and applied knowledge that is crucial for medical advances (https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/sep/13/primate-research-is-crucial-if-we-are-to-find-cures-for-diseases-like-parkinsons). Such strong reaction of the scientific community to misrepresentations of opponents of research should serve as a model. The response came quickly and directly from prominent scientists and in numbers that reflected a clear scientific consensus. Moreover, it appears to have been effective. Scientific organizations can serve to facilitate such responses and provide the media expertise required to offer an effective response. Posting such responses in public view also provides an ongoing resource for those with questions and for those responding to such questions. The phrase “animal rights” can have a number of different meanings. The weakest interpretation is that non-human animals do not exist solely for human use but deserve our moral consideration. It would be, of course, very difficult to find scientists that would disagree with such statement. In fact, the strict regulations and guidelines that govern the work, including the principles established by the three Rs (replacement, reduction, and refinement), amply demonstrate that animals used in research are not considered “another piece of laboratory equipment” as often claimed by opponents. A stronger view of animal rights, encapsulated in the “equal consideration principle,” is that we must give equal moral weight to the “comparable interests” of all living beings independent of species membership. Thus, the “comparable pain” experienced by a mouse and a human child should receive exactly the same moral consideration. It is precisely under the equal consideration principle that Peter Singer declares that, if we consider it morally permissible to study monkeys in order to develop deep brain stimulation (DBS) as a treatment for Parkinson’s disease in humans, then it should also be equally permissible to develop DBS using disabled human beings having cognitive capabilities comparable to monkeys. Finally, the strongest version of “animal rights” claims that all living beings have a basic right to life and liberty that should not be infringed, even if their use can provide tremendous benefits to society. This is sometimes summarized by animal rights activists with the slogan “a rat is a pig is a dog is a boy.” It is under such a strong view of animal rights that some animal rights activists see no moral difference between chickens caged in a farm and Jews in concentration camps. It is under such theory, as well, that they argue that if violence was justified in freeing Jews from concentration camps, so it must be justified in freeing chickens from a farm or animals from medical laboratories—a logical conclusion if one accepts the moral equivalence of the two situations. We think that scientists should become familiar with the philosophical objections, participate in the philosophical debates, and guard against being quickly dismissive of such views. While some animal rights extremists prefer to defend these views by the use of Molotov cocktails, moral philosophers (whom we count as our own colleagues) are ready to defend their views by debating them in the academic arena. We should engage them. A number of introductory texts that explain the different positions are available and easily accessible (Taylor, 2009Taylor A. Animal and Ethics: An Overview of the Philosophical Debate.Third Edition. Broadview Press, 2009Google Scholar, DeGrazia, 2012DeGrazia D. Animal Rights: A Very Short Introduction. Oxford University Press, 2012Google Scholar). In our experience, being knowledgeable about these philosophical views is important when engaging in public debates about animal research (Ringach, 2011Ringach D.L. Am. J. Med. Sci. 2011; 342: 305-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We expect the opposition to be knowledgeable and factual about the science and its benefits. Similarly, scientists have an intellectual obligation to understand and address the ethical arguments brought up against the work. Members of the public can also have legitimate concerns about the welfare of animals, which is aggravated when opponents of animal research portray scientists as showing disregard for animals’ well-being. Over the years, such propaganda has perpetuated the notion that scientists and the animal research community are opposed to any advancements that can improve the welfare of animals in laboratories. Scientists are increasingly perceived as being incapable of giving full consideration of the moral dilemmas posed by animal research. Instead, the public seems to believe that it is the bioethicists, philosophers, and animal activists who are the true experts on animal welfare. The narrow conceptualization of ethical consideration, one that essentially assumes a two-party system in which science is pitted against animal welfare, is the foundation for a wide range of misconceptions about the process for decisions about animal research. For example, some critics claim that there is a complete absence of ethical deliberation or concern for animal welfare within the scientific community. Others claim that the current system for review is faulty because it does not require animal rights campaigners, philosophers, and bioethicists in equal weight on committees, such as the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), or grant review panels. Unaddressed, such views are harmful for a number of reasons. Perhaps foremost, they deny the reality that ethical evaluation is inherent and central in the current process for conducting scientific research with nonhuman animals. Thus, a critical objective for the scientific community is to provide a clear, unambiguous view of the many ways in which ethical consideration is given to inform serious, thoughtful decisions about animal studies. In fact, ethical consideration occurs throughout the process; it is in our choice of research projects, the review of research proposals and protocols, the standards for animal care and treatment, and its oversight and regulation. The polarized view also denies the reality that scientists themselves contribute the knowledge and expertise that informs our understanding of animal welfare and that is the basis of evidence-based practices and policies to improve animal welfare. Many scientists already have the skill sets to advance these objectives and to participate more fully in public communication. Yet there are factors that limit their enthusiasm or their ability to take on a greater role. Among those are time and energy. Public outreach and engagement must compete with a host of demands for scientists’ time—conducting science, writing papers, teaching and mentoring students, funding the science, writing grant proposals, and doing administrative work. Among the ways to address this obstacle is for scientists themselves to realize that public engagement can be accomplished with a range of efforts and time commitment that are small (i.e., less time than a game of golf). Others involve change in the professional expectations for the scientific community. Years ago, the National Science Foundation (NSF) put into place an explicit requirement for “Broader Impacts” activities within NSF grant proposals. By doing so, NSF signaled not only that it expected and supported public engagement, but also that such work is of central value. Similarly, public outreach and education activities are viewed not as “extracurricular” but as core and expected responsibilities of scientists within some universities and institutes. Such changes in metrics for funding, promotion, tenure, and other review deliver an unambiguous message: public communication and public education are valued by the scientific community, by the institutions in which they work, by funding agencies, and by society. However, it is not only scientists who must receive the message and support for public engagement and transparency. Universities, institutes, companies, and charities can also play a far greater role in public education and dialog than they do currently. In fact, we would argue, all the institutions that engage in animal research have a moral obligation to do so. Public transparency about their research programs includes not only promoting the discoveries, but also making clear statements and engaged educational efforts to share how the work is conducted, how the animals are cared for, what the process of review and oversight is, and why the institution and its leadership believe it is ethical, humane, and important to the public that supports and receives the benefits of the research. Every scientist should expect that their institutions, administrations, funders, and scientific organizations engage publicly and transparently in providing responsive information to inform the public, journalists, and policy makers about animal research. Ongoing and new initiatives and programs should proactively, and as a matter of course, contain specific plans and support for effective, sustained, and inclusive public education and engagement about animal research. Major international funding programs, such as the US BRAIN, the European Union’s Human Brain Project, and parallel programs in China and Japan, could all play a critical role in this effort. Such initiatives are positioned to be effective leaders in highlighting to the public, media, policy makers, and the broad scientific community that there is a critical connection of neuroscience research programs to foundational, current, and future studies that depend on nonhuman animal studies. Furthermore, these international efforts and the scientists working within them are also well aware of how rises and declines in public support for animal research shape not only what kind of research can be done, but also where that work will occur. We must be mindful that in today’s global world the consequences of public support and decisions in one country or region of the world often reaches to others. Rises and declines in primate research, for example, in Asia, Europe, and the US—while stemming from a range of factors—provide examples of both interdependency and cause for reflection. The future of global neuroscience research will undoubtedly be affected by continuing changes in public perception of animal research. Highly organized and well-funded groups opposing animal research are acutely aware of the international interdependency. They use events in one country or region in order to influence public views in another. Chimpanzee research provides the most recent example, where bans in Europe were prominently featured in campaigns to ban the same in the US (Bennett and Panicker, 2016Bennett A.J. Panicker S. Am. J. Primatol. 2016; https://doi.org/10.1002/ajp.22582Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The campaigns failed to note that European scientists were conducting chimpanzee research in the US or that European countries had previously banned the work with full confidence that US centers would continue to provide viable avenues for continuing research. When limits on research are imposed in one country, opponents of the work readily declare it proof that the research was not scientifically necessary to begin with. Such a message is then used to mount campaigns in other countries. Instead, it would be helpful to develop mechanisms that will achieve some consensus on questions of scientific necessity. Individual countries may then decide to engage or not in specific lines of work due to a myriad of other factors. At the same time, the process of consideration could provide the broad public and others with a more integrative view of the consequences of such decisions. For example, the scientific community could estimate the impact of decisions on training future scientists, on a nation’s ability to conduct research, and on their dependence on science conducted in other nations or world regions. In turn, the scientific community would provide critical public service given that understanding the broader and far-ranging consequences of decisions that affect science at local and global levels is a key basis for informing decision making that protects the public’s interests. To succeed, efforts to encourage greater public transparency and engagement from scientists, organizations, and institutions must also effectively address another common obstacle. That obstacle is the general perception of risk. Perceived risks run the gamut: the risk of drawing negative attention, the risk of becoming targets of high-profile and time-consuming campaigns by animal rights groups, the risk of violence and harassment directed against individuals, and the risk of losing the support of donors, funders, and other community partners. Those risks are real. They are also risks that can be addressed and minimized through proactive work and timely responses that directly counter campaigns of misinformation with fact. It is critical to also realize that the individual risks are inversely proportional to the number of people engaging in defense of science. Thus, in many ways, a choice to not engage while others are doing so also has the consequence of increasing risk for others. A more principled reason to face these risks is that they are nothing compared to the long-term harms that successful opposition to the work can do to public interests, human and animal health, and the environment. The likely outcomes of sustained campaigns against research must also be weighed as a central consideration. Those outcomes are not simply an end to animal research. The outcomes also include those we already have encountered: truncating avenues for research, shifting studies to animal models that are not as effective for particular questions (such as mice or fish rather than monkeys), declines in the number of future scientists, and increases in regulatory burden without compensatory increases in animal welfare. All of these outcomes have impact far beyond the scientific community. The impact extends to the public, to patients, and to future generations. Scientists, organizations, institutions, families, and patient groups interested in committing themselves to building better public understanding and dialog about animal research can find many existing resources to support their efforts. We encourage our colleagues to engage more in public life. After all, it is truly our duty as scientists and responsible citizens to do so. Dario L.

Maternal tuberculosis disease spectrum and tuberculosis-exposed newborns were characterized by maternal HIV status. Maternal tuberculosis treatment outcomes were documented and a multivariable regression model identified predictors of unfavourable tuberculosis treatment outcomes. Infant outcomes were also described.Seventy-four women with tuberculosis, 53 (72%) HIV-infected, were consecutively enrolled; 35 (47%) were diagnosed at delivery or postpartum and 22 (30%) of women reported previous antituberculosis treatment. HIV-infected women were 5.67 times more likely to have extrapulmonary tuberculosis (95% CI 1.18-27.25, p = 0.03). All 5 maternal deaths were amongst HIV-infected women. Birth outcomes were available for 75 newborns (2 sets of twins, missing data for 1 stillbirth). Of the 75 newborns, 49 (65%) were premature and 44 (59%) were low birth weight (LBW; <2500 grams). All 6 infants who died and the 4 stillbirths were born to HIV-infected women. Unfavourable tuberculosis treatment outcomes were documented in 33/74 (45%) women. Unfavourable maternal tuberculosis outcome was associated with delivery of LBW infants (OR 3.83; 95% CI 1.40-10.53, p = 0.009).A large number of pregnant women with tuberculosis presented at a provincial referral hospital. All maternal and infant deaths occurred in HIV-infected women and their newborns. Maternal tuberculosis treatment outcomes were poor."

Although considerable effort has been devoted to understanding how conformational dynamics within enzymes affect catalysis, the role of conformational dynamics within protein substrates has not been addressed. Here, we examine the importance of substrate dynamics in the cleavage of Kunitz-bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor protease inhibitors by mesotrypsin, finding that the varied conformational dynamics of structurally similar substrates can profoundly impact the rate of catalysis. A 1.4-Å crystal structure of a mesotrypsin-product complex formed with a rapidly cleaved substrate reveals a dramatic conformational change in the substrate upon proteolysis. By using long all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of acyl-enzyme intermediates with proteolysis rates spanning 3 orders of magnitude, we identify global and local dynamic features of substrates on the nanosecond-microsecond time scale that correlate with enzymatic rates and explain differential susceptibility to proteolysis. By integrating multiple enhanced sampling methods for molecular dynamics, we model a viable conformational pathway between substrate-like and product-like states, linking substrate dynamics on the nanosecond-microsecond time scale with large collective substrate motions on the much slower time scale of catalysis. Our findings implicate substrate flexibility as a critical determinant of catalysis.

Protein function is determined by macromolecular geometry conferred by the folded state, as noted by Anfinsen nearly 40 years ago (1.Anfinsen C.B. Principles that govern the folding of protein chains.Science. 1973; 181: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (5135) Google Scholar); however, recent years have brought fresh meaning to this paradigm with an increasing appreciation of the temporal dependence of protein structure. Proteins constantly sample varied conformational fluctuations about the time-averaged structures that we observe crystallographically or spectroscopically, and these conformational dynamics are in many cases closely coupled to protein function (2.Frauenfelder H. Sligar S.G. Wolynes P.G. The energy landscapes and motions of proteins.Science. 1991; 254: 1598-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (2609) Google Scholar, 3.Leeson D.T. Wiersma D.A.

Nowhere is this clearer than for enzymes, proteins evolved to accelerate biological chemical reactions. Varied examples have revealed that enzyme conformational dynamics can facilitate substrate binding, progression along the catalytic reaction coordinate, and product release (5.Wolf-Watz M. Thai V.

Most studies of protein dynamics in enzyme catalysis have naturally focused on conformational changes within the enzyme. However, for the many enzymes that catalyze reactions of protein substrates, an overlooked source of potentially relevant dynamics lies within the substrate. Trypsins are serine proteases, a class of proteolytic enzymes that have been well characterized and used to dissect and understand catalysis, most often using short oligopeptide model substrates as proxies for natural protein substrates. Following formation of a noncovalent Michaelis complex, the catalytic mechanism proceeds through two sequential steps (Scheme 1) (11.Hedstrom L. Serine protease mechanism and specificity.Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4501-4524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar). In the first step, the enzyme serine nucleophile attacks the carbonyl of a substrate peptide bond, forming a covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate, and displacing the peptide product composed of residues C-terminal to the cleavage site (the “primed side” residues according to the nomenclature of Schechter and Berger (12.Schechter I. Berger A. On the size of the active site in proteases. I. Papain.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4753) Google Scholar)). In the second step, a nucleophilic water molecule hydrolyzes the acyl-enzyme, releasing the nonprimed side peptide product. Classic studies using unstructured oligopeptide substrates have shown substrate discrimination to occur at the acylation step; for specific peptide substrates, acylation is fast, and acyl-enzyme hydrolysis is rate-determining (13.Hedstrom L. Szilagyi L. Rutter W.J. Converting trypsin to chymotrypsin: the role of surface loops.Science. 1992; 255: 1249-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 14.Radisky E.S. Lee J.M. Lu C.J. Koshland Jr., D.E. Insights into the serine protease mechanism from atomic resolution structures of trypsin reaction intermediates.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 6835-6840Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Much less is known about cleavage kinetics for structured protein substrates, but overall rates of catalysis are often several orders of magnitude slower than for oligopeptide substrates (15.Salameh M.A. Robinson J.L. Navaneetham D. Sinha D. Madden B.J. Walsh P.N. Radisky E.S. The amyloid precursor protein/protease nexin 2 Kunitz inhibitor domain is a highly specific substrate of mesotrypsin.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 1939-1949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), suggesting that substrate structure may variably impede progression of the reaction pathway. Furthermore, modeling studies have implicated a requirement for local unfolding of a protein chain around the cleavage site to enable proteolysis (16.Hubbard S.J. Eisenmenger F. Thornton J.M. Modeling studies of the change in conformation required for cleavage of limited proteolytic sites.Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems plausible that substrate conformational dynamics (i.e. the dynamical behavior of a protein substrate during catalysis) may influence serine protease catalytic rates. An ideal model to examine protein substrate dynamics and their impact on proteolysis is provided by the canonical (Laskowski mechanism) serine protease inhibitors (17.Krowarsch D. Cierpicki T. Jelen F. Otlewski J. Canonical protein inhibitors of serine proteases.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 2427-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). These inhibitors are highly specific limited proteolysis substrates for their target enzymes, yet they differ from ordinary substrates in being bound many orders of magnitude more tightly and cleaved many orders of magnitude more slowly (18.Laskowski Jr., M. Kato I. Protein inhibitors of proteinases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 593-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1940) Google Scholar). They interact with an enzyme by mimicking an ideal substrate, using an exposed binding loop, which is complementary to the active site for recognition, and presenting a “reactive site” peptide bond for cleavage (19.Bode W. Huber R. Natural protein proteinase inhibitors and their interaction with proteinases.Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 433-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar, 20.Radisky E.S. Koshland Jr., D.E. A clogged gutter mechanism for protease inhibitors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 10316-10321Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, short peptides that recapitulate the sequence surrounding the reactive site behave as ideal substrates, not inhibitors, and thus the slow cleavage and inhibitory nature of canonical inhibitors are conferred by structural context and perhaps consequent constraints on dynamics (21.Radisky E.S. King D.S. Kwan G. Koshland Jr., D.E. The role of the protein core in the inhibitory power of the classic serine protease inhibitor, chymotrypsin inhibitor 2.Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6484-6492Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).

Chem. 2014; 289: 32783-32797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The Kunitz domain, typified by BPTI, possesses a compact pear-shaped protein fold that is stabilized by a hydrophobic core and three conserved disulfide bonds (Fig. 1) (25.Salameh M.A. Soares A.S.

Surprisingly, despite close conservation of these structural features, different Kunitz family members vary widely in their rates of cleavage by mesotrypsin; human amyloid precursor protein inhibitor (APPI) and amyloid precursor-like protein 2 Kunitz domain (APLP2-KD) are cleaved nearly 3 orders of magnitude faster than BPTI, with substrate-like kinetics (Fig. 1) (15.Salameh M.A. Robinson J.L.

Mutagenesis experiments have demonstrated that sequence variation within the binding loops of these inhibitors does not fully account for their differential proteolysis rates; rather, sequence differences in the scaffold, far removed from the enzyme interface, have a profound effect on proteolysis (25.Salameh M.A. Soares A.S. Navaneetham D. Sinha D. Walsh P.N. Radisky E.S. Determinants of affinity and proteolytic stability in interactions of Kunitz family protease inhibitors with mesotrypsin.J. Biol.

Furthermore, in a recent combinatorial protein engineering effort, we identified an APPI variant, APPI-3M, in which only three amino acid substitutions (Fig. 1A) produced a striking ∼100-fold reduction of the proteolysis rate, despite very minimal impact of the mutations on protein structure (Fig. 1B) (27.Cohen I. Kayode O. Hockla A. Sankaran B. Radisky D.C. Radisky E.S. Papo N. Combinatorial protein engineering of proteolytically resistant mesotrypsin inhibitors as candidates for cancer therapy.Biochem. J. 2016; 473: 1329-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These differences in catalysis, not easily explained by sequence or static X-ray crystal structures, may be reflective of distinct protein dynamics within the Kunitz domains or at the enzyme interface. In this work, we investigate the structure of the most rapidly cleaved natural Kunitz domain identified to date, APLP2-KD, in complex with mesotrypsin. Unlike prior solved Kunitz domain crystal structures, here APLP2-KD is trapped in a product-like complex, revealing a remarkable conformational transformation after cleavage. This snapshot reveals an unprecedented structural plasticity in the substrate that may be key to its comparatively rapid proteolysis, a hypothesis that we probe through both free (unbiased) and stepwise guided molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Our results implicate conformational motions within the protein substrate as a determinant of proteolytic rates; this example shows that we must look beyond the enzyme to fully appreciate the importance of protein dynamics in enzyme catalysis. To gain insight into the interaction between rapidly cleaved protein substrate APLP2-KD and mesotrypsin, we cocrystallized the substrate with the catalytically inactive mesotrypsin-S195A variant. The complex crystallized in the P21212 space group with one copy of the dimeric complex in the asymmetric unit, and the structure was solved and refined to 1.4 Å resolution with the statistics described in Table 1. To our surprise, APLP2-KD in this complex displayed hydrolysis of the Arg-15–Ala-16 peptide bond. We will refer to this two-chain form of the substrate as APLP2-KD*, where the asterisk denotes a modified form of APLP2-KD cleaved at the reactive site bond (18.Laskowski Jr., M. Kato I. Protein inhibitors of proteinases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 593-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1940) Google Scholar). Clear electron density revealed the new C terminus of Arg-15, still positioned in the specificity pocket of the enzyme active site (Fig. 2A). However, as the result of a large conformational change in the Kunitz domain, primed side substrate residues 16 and 17 were disordered, whereas residue Met-18, for which only the backbone was visible, was now located >27 Å from Arg-15, near the opposite end of the molecule (Fig. 2B). Continuous electron density was observed throughout the rest of the protein substrate and throughout the mesotrypsin chain. As examination of the active site clearly showed distinct density for the mesotrypsin S195A inactivating mutation (Fig. 2A), it was initially unclear how the substrate reactive site bond had become hydrolyzed. Subsequent analysis of the enzyme preparation used for the crystallographic studies uncovered a small amount (∼0.1%) of enzymatic activity that could be quenched by serine-modifying inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, revealing minor contamination with nonmutant active mesotrypsin (data not shown). Apparently, the trace amount of active mesotrypsin catalyzed complete limited proteolysis of APLP2-KD at the reactive site; the processed APLP2-KD* then bound to mesotrypsin-S195A, and this product-like complex preferentially crystallized out of solution.TABLE 1X-ray data collection and refinement statisticsMesotrypsin-APLP2-KD* complexPDB code5JBTData collectionSpace groupP21212Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)99.01, 54.58, 56.60α, β, γ (°)90, 90, 90Resolution (Å)50–1.40 (1.42–1.40)Rmerge0.064 (0.231)Rmeas0.080 (0.278)Rp.i.m.0.021 (0.102)CC½ND (0.970)I/σI27.2 (6.76)Completeness (%)99.3 (99.8)Redundancy12.8 (7.3)RefinementResolution (Å)50–1.40No. of reflections57,667Rwork/Rfree16.3/19.9No. of atomsProtein2125Ligand/ion5Water259B-factorsProtein19Ligand/ion35Water30Ramachandran statisticsFavored (%)98Allowed (%)2Outliers (%)0r.m.s.d.Bond lengths (Å)0.0219Bond angles (°)2.0874 Open table in a new tab Although subsequent extensive efforts to cocrystallize highly purified mesotrypsin-S195A with intact APLP2-KD were not successful, we are able to gain insight into the APLP2-KD* conformational change through comparisons with the structure of mesotrypsin bound to intact APLP2-KD homolog APPI (Protein Data Bank code 3L33) (25.Salameh M.A. Soares A.S.

Superposition reveals that although the enzyme is essentially static, the substrate has undergone a massive conformational change upon cleavage, in which the α-helix has rotated nearly 180° to the opposite side of the molecule, and the β-hairpin has become nearly inverted and traverses the center of the Kunitz domain (Fig. 2C). The conformational transformation has little impact on the substrate's nonprimed side residues 11–15, which remain firmly fixed at the enzyme interface with little deviation from their pre-cleavage positions. By contrast, the primed side substrate residues are evacuated from the enzyme active site cleft as a result of the conformational change. Prior studies have suggested that dissociation of primed side residues from the enzyme active site may represent a common rate-limiting step during proteolysis of canonical inhibitors (20.Radisky E.S.

While acyl-enzyme formation can proceed rapidly, inter- and intramolecular interactions that tether the primed side leaving group can favor peptide bond resynthesis over acyl-enzyme hydrolysis, slowing reaction progress (20.Radisky E.S.

The motions evidenced by the new crystal structure of cleaved APLP2-KD* appear to facilitate primed side residue dissociation from the enzyme, and thus might help to explain the more rapid proteolysis of this Kunitz domain compared with others. Notably, the only prior reported crystal structure of a post-cleavage Kunitz domain, cleaved BPTI* (where BPTI* is BPTI cleaved at the Lys-15–Ala-16 reactive-site bond) bound to rat anionic trypsin, revealed a native-like structure in which the P1′–P3′ residues were retained in the trypsin active site, poised for peptide bond resynthesis (29.Zakharova E. Horvath M.P. Goldenberg D.P. Structure of a serine protease poised to resynthesize a peptide bond.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 11034-11039Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). As BPTI is proteolyzed orders of magnitude more slowly than APLP2-KD (Fig. 1), it would appear from these limited data that post-cleavage substrate dynamics may correlate with proteolysis rates. We reasoned that perhaps the conformation observed in the APLP2-KD* complex mimics a productive “open” conformation of the acyl-enzyme, required along the reaction trajectory, which promotes forward reaction progress by allowing water to enter the active site and hydrolyze the acyl-enzyme. Alternatively, the specific conformation stabilized by the crystal lattice may be merely reflective of globally increased substrate motions of APLP2-KD relative to BPTI that may accelerate proteolysis by acting at this or other steps along the reaction pathway. To gain further insight into the potential role of substrate dynamics in governing rates of proteolysis, we next employed free (unbiased) all-atom MD simulations for a series of mesotrypsin-Kunitz domain complexes. The complexes of APPI, APPI-3M, and BPTI with mesotrypsin span a broad range of known catalytic rates (Fig. 1), and for each there was an available experimental X-ray structure of the pre-cleavage Michaelis complex on which to base a starting model (23.Salameh M.A. Soares A.S.

After energy minimization, the initial positioning of the P1′ residue in all acyl-enzyme models was consistent with the positioning of the P1′ residue of cleaved BPTI* from the previously reported experimental structure (29.Zakharova E. Horvath M.P. Goldenberg D.P. Structure of a serine protease poised to resynthesize a peptide bond.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 11034-11039Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Because of the anticipated slow time scale of large substrate motions such as those evidenced in the APLP2-KD* complex, multiple long simulations (1000+ ns/replicate) were conducted for each acyl-enzyme, along with several 100–200-ns replicates for convergence. The results reported for free simulations are based on analyses of an aggregate of >20 μs of trajectory data. To evaluate differences among the complexes in the overall magnitude of global conformational dynamics, we aligned frames on backbone atoms and compared root-mean-square deviation (r.m.s.d.) plots of backbone atom deviation from average positions for all protein residues over the course of the simulations. We observed that the complex involving the more rapidly cleaved APPI substrate sampled a considerably wider range of global conformational states than the complexes with slower proteolyzed substrates APPI-3M or BPTI (Fig. 3A). These differences can be attributed largely to conformational fluctuations of the substrate chain, and comparisons based on r.m.s.d. calculations for the substrate backbone atoms only show yet greater differences in the range of conformational states sampled (Fig. 3B). The per residue root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) plots of the individual substrate chains display peak magnitudes that correlate with proteolysis rates observed biochemically; these plots also reveal which residues within each substrate demonstrate the greatest positional deviation over the duration of the simulation (Fig. 3C). By mapping the RMSF values onto the protein structures, we observed that the positional fluctuations of the largest magnitude were evidenced by the α-helix and β-turn regions of the substrate, distal to the point of contact with the enzyme (Fig. 3D). These observations could result from large local conformational fluctuations within these elements of the Kunitz domain secondary structure or, alternatively, from changes in orientation of the substrate at the enzyme interface, where the apparent magnitude of distal fluctuations might be amplified by their greater distance from a pivot point or hinge region. To distinguish between these possibilities, we superposed selected frames from each MD simulation representing a subset of struct"
https://openalex.org/W2549035706,"This study examined adaptive changes of eye-hand coordination during a visuomotor rotation task under the use of terminal visual feedback. Young adults made reaching movements to targets on a digitizer while looking at targets on a monitor where the rotated feedback (a cursor) of hand movements appeared after each movement. Three rotation angles (30°, 75° and 150°) were examined in three groups in order to vary the task difficulty. The results showed that the 30° group gradually reduced direction errors of reaching with practice and adapted well to the visuomotor rotation. The 75° group made large direction errors of reaching, and the 150° group applied a 180° reversal shift from early practice. The 75°and 150° groups, however, overcompensated the respective rotations at the end of practice. Despite these group differences in adaptive changes of reaching, all groups gradually adapted gaze directions prior to reaching from the target area to the areas related to the final positions of reaching during the course of practice. The adaptive changes of both hand and eye movements in all groups mainly reflected adjustments of movement directions based on explicit knowledge of the applied rotation acquired through practice. Only the 30° group showed small implicit adaptation in both effectors. The results suggest that by adapting gaze directions from the target to the final position of reaching based on explicit knowledge of the visuomotor rotation, the oculomotor system supports the limb-motor system to make precise preplanned adjustments of reaching directions during learning of visuomotor rotation under terminal visual feedback."
https://openalex.org/W2546515588,"Here, we show that a partner-switching system of the aquatic Proteobacterium Shewanella oneidensis regulates post-translationally σS (also called RpoS), the general stress response sigma factor. Genes SO2118 and SO2119 encode CrsA and CrsR, respectively. CrsR is a three-domain protein comprising a receiver, a phosphatase, and a kinase/anti-sigma domains, and CrsA is an anti-sigma antagonist. In vitro, CrsR sequesters σS and possesses kinase and phosphatase activities toward CrsA. In turn, dephosphorylated CrsA binds the anti-sigma domain of CrsR to allow the release of σS. This study reveals a novel pathway that post-translationally regulates the general stress response sigma factor differently than what was described for other proteobacteria like Escherichia coli. We argue that this pathway allows probably a rapid bacterial adaptation."

Framework descriptors were established across five levels of statistical reasoning and four key constructs. The former consisted of idiosyncratic reasoning, verbal reasoning, transitional reasoning, procedural reasoning, and integrated process reasoning. The latter include describing data, organizing and reducing data, representing data, and analyzing and interpreting data. In contrast to earlier studies, this initial framework formulated a complete and coherent statistical reasoning framework. A statistical reasoning assessment tool was then constructed from this initial framework. The tool was administered to 10 tenth-grade students in a task-based interview. The initial framework was refined, and the statistical reasoning assessment tool was revised. The ten students then participated in the second task-based interview, and the data obtained were used to validate the framework. The findings showed that the students’ statistical reasoning levels were consistent across the four constructs, and this result confirmed the framework’s cohesion. Developed to contribute to statistics education, this newly developed statistical reasoning framework provides a guide for planning learning goals and designing instruction and assessments."

https://openalex.org/W2546543590,"Aldehyde dehydrogenase typically performs oxidation of aldehydes to their corresponding carboxylic acid while reducing NAD(P)+ to NAD(P)H via covalent catalysis mediated by an active-site cysteine residue. One member of this superfamily, the enzyme 2-aminomuconate-6-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (AMSDH), is a component of the kynurenine pathway, which catabolizes tryptophan in mammals and certain bacteria. AMSDH catalyzes the NAD+-dependent oxidation of 2-aminomuconate semialdehyde to 2-aminomuconate. We recently determined the first crystal structure of AMSDH and several catalytic cycle intermediates. A conserved asparagine in the oxyanion hole, Asn-169, is found to be H-bonded to substrate-derived intermediates in the active site of AMSDH during catalysis, including both the covalently bound thiohemiacetal and thioacyl intermediates. To better interrogate the significance of the hydrogen bond provided by Asn-169 to the reaction mechanism of AMSDH, we created Ala, Ser, Asp, and Gln mutants and studied them using biochemical, kinetic, crystallographic, and computational studies. The in crystallo chemical reaction of the primary substrate with the co-crystalized complex of the N169D mutant and NAD+ led to the successful trapping of a new catalytic intermediate that was not previously seen. The structural and computational data are consistent with a substrate imine/enol tautomer intermediate being formed prior to the formation of the covalent bond between the substrate and the active-site cysteine. Thus, AMSDH surprisingly includes an isomerization process within its known catalytic mechanism. These data establish a hidden intrinsic isomerization activity of the dehydrogenase and allow us to propose a pitcher-catcher type of catalytic mechanism for the isomerization."

https://openalex.org/W2546584604,"It can hit as a piercing jolt, or sometimes as a dull ache that radiates through the body. Pain can be exquisite, or debilitating and chronic, which can destroy one’s quality of life. Pain starts with a stimulus at the periphery of the body, which then travels through neurons to the brain. But the process is far more complex. A number of neuronal circuits are involved in pain transmission. Most of these circuits are plastic and can change when something goes awry. Once we understand these circuits, we can interfere and block them at the right level.

However, pain is not only a matter of neurons. The tissue around them plays an important role, too. Other cells—such as skin, immune, or glia cells, to name just a few—participate in the pathogenesis and also the resolution of pain. Nor is there a simple one-way street from the periphery to the brain. Powerful cognitive processes shape the way that we perceive pain. This perception is determined by our expectations and the situation in which we fi nd ourselves. Clinicians need this knowledge to develop techniques for personalized treatment of chronic pain and to prevent pain from spiraling out of control.

Failed attempts to manage pain have contributed to the opioid epidemic in the United States. Understanding how opioids work, and how in some circumstances they might actually amplify pain, should lead to alternatives. As many states legalize the medical use of marijuana, hints are emerging that cannabis could be one, but research is complicated by strict federal regulations."
