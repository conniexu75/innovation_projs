https://openalex.org/W1972927903,"Erythropoietin (EPO) regulates the proliferation and differentiation of erythroid cells through interaction with its receptor (EPOR). Although EPOR is a member of the cytokine receptor superfamily and lacks a kinase domain, EPO induces tyrosine phosphorylation, which is correlated with gene transcription and mitogenesis. Here we demonstrate that EPO induces tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 kinase and activates its in vitro autophosphorylation. Using EPOR mutants, phosphorylation and activation of kinase activity correlate with the induction of mitogenesis. Furthermore, JAK2 physically associates with a membrane-proximal region of the EPOR cytoplasmic domain that is required for biological activity. The results support the hypothesis that JAK2 is the kinase that couples EPO binding to tyrosine phosphorylation and mitogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2145297890,"Mice with mutations at the microphthalmia (mi) locus have some or all of the following defects: loss of pigmentation, reduced eye size, failure of secondary bone resorption, reduced numbers of mast cells, and early onset of deafness. Using a transgenic insertional mutation at this locus, we have identified a gene whose expression is disrupted in transgenic animals. This gene encodes a novel member of the basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLH-ZIP) protein family of transcription factors, is altered in mice carrying two independent mi alleles (mi and miws), and is expressed in the developing eye, ear, and skin, all anatomical sites affected by mi. The multiple spontaneous and induced mutations available at mi provide a unique biological resource for studying the role of a bHLH-ZIP protein in mammalian development."
https://openalex.org/W2012293213,"The retinoblastoma gene product (Rb) can interact efficiently with two of three D-type G1 cyclins (D2 and D3) in vitro. Binding depended upon the minimal regions of Rb necessary for its growth-suppressive activity, as well as upon the D-type cyclin sequence motif shared with Rb-binding DNA tumor virus oncoproteins. Coexpression of the three D-type cyclins with the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk4) in insect cells generated Rb kinase activity. By contrast, cyclins D2 and D3, but not D1, activated another such kinase, cdk2. Introduction of cyclin D2 and Rb into the Rb-deficient cell line SAOS-2 led to overt Rb hyperphosphorylation, whereas Rb, expressed alone or together with cyclin D1, remained unphosphorylated. Cyclin D2-dependent phosphorylation inhibited its binding to the transcription factor E2F and reversed the Rb G1 exit block in the cell cycle. Thus, all D-type cyclins do not function equivalently, and one of them plays a major role in reversing the cycle-blocking function of a known tumor suppressor."
https://openalex.org/W1974656027,"Growth hormone receptor (GHR) forms a complex with a tyrosine kinase, suggesting involvement of a ligand-activated tyrosine kinase in intracellular signaling by growth hormone (GH). Here we identify JAK2, a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, as a GHR-associated tyrosine kinase. Immunological approaches were used to establish GH-dependent complex formation between JAK2 and GHR, activation of JAK2 tyrosine kinase activity, and tyrosyl phosphorylation of both JAK2 and GHR. The JAK2-GHR and JAK2-erythropoietin receptor interactions described here and in the accompanying paper provide a molecular basis for involvement of tyrosyl phosphorylation in physiological responses to these ligands and suggest a shared signaling mechanism among members of the cytokine/hematopoietin receptor family."
https://openalex.org/W2000051743,"Cytochrome P450BM-3, a bacterial fatty acid monoxygenase, resembles the eukaryotic microsomal P450's and their flavoprotein reductase in primary structure and function. The three-dimensional structure of the hemoprotein domain of P450BM-3 was determined by x-ray diffraction and refined to an R factor of 16.9 percent at 2.0 angstrom resolution. The structure consists of an alph and a beta domain. The active site heme is accessible through a long hydrophobic channel formed primarily by the beta domain and the B' and F helices of the alpha domain. The two molecules in the asymmetric unit differ in conformation around the substrate binding pocket. Substantial differences between P450BM-3 and P450cam, the only other P450 structure available, are observed around the substrate binding pocket and the regions important for redox partner binding. A general mechanism for proton transfer in P450's is also proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2000939708,"We have immunolabeled human and mouse metaphase chromosomes with antibodies specific for the acetylated isoforms of histone H4. All chromosomes were labeled in regions corresponding to conventional R bands (regions enriched in coding DNA), except for a single chromosome in female cells, which was largely unlabeled and which we have identified as the inactive X (Xi). Three sharply defined immunofluorescent bands, enhanced by butyrate pretreatment, were observed in homologous positions on the human and mouse Xi, showing limited, regional persistence of H4 acetylation. Two of these bands are in cytogenetic regions known to contain genes expressed on Xi. We propose that H4 hyperacetylation defines regions of the genome containing potentially transcriptionally active chromatin, while virtual absence of H4 acetylation defines both constitutive and facultative heterochromatin."
https://openalex.org/W2071692669,"Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules present peptides derived from nuclear and cytosolic proteins to CD8+ T cells. These peptides are translocated into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to associate with class I molecules. Two MHC-encoded putative transporter proteins, TAP1 and TAP2, are required for efficient assembly of class I molecules and presentation of endogenous peptides. Expression of TAP1 and TAP2 in a mutant cell line resulted in the delivery of an 11-amino acid oligomer model peptide to the ER. Peptide translocation depended on the sequence of the peptide, was adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent, required ATP hydrolysis, and was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2027128159,"The lin-12 gene of C. elegans and the Notch gene of D. melanogaster encode structurally related transmembrane proteins that mediate intercellular signaling. We show that truncated forms of these proteins consisting of only the intracellular domains cause cell fate transformations associated with constitutive activity in their respective organisms. This activity does not depend on endogenous gene function. Our results indicate that the intracellular domains of Lin-12 and Notch have intrinsic activity and that the principal role of the extracellular domains in the intact proteins is to regulate this activity. Our results also suggest that equivalent truncated forms of lin-12/Notch family members in vertebrates, including known oncogenes, are similarly active."
https://openalex.org/W1990045619,"The Notch gene of Drosophila plays an important role in cell fate specification throughout development. To investigate the functions of specific structural domains of the Notch protein in vivo, a series of deletion mutants have been ectopically expressed under the hsp70 heat shock promoter. Two classes of dominant phenotypes are observed, one suggestive of Notch loss-of-function mutations and the other of Notch gain-of-function mutations. Dominant activated phenotypes result from overexpression of a protein lacking most extracellular sequences, while dominant negative phenotypes result from overexpression of a protein lacking most intracellular sequences. These results support the notion that Notch functions as a receptor whose extracellular domain mediates ligand binding, resulting in the transmission of developmental signals by the cytoplasmic domain. Finally, the phenotypes observed suggest that the cdc 10/ankyrin repeat region within the intracellular domain plays an essential role in the postulated signal transduction events."
https://openalex.org/W1994162276,"The first three-dimensional structure of a DNA methyltransferase is presented. The crystal structure of the DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase, M.HhaI (recognition sequence: GCGC), complexed with S-adenosyl-L-methionine has been determined and refined at 2.5 A resolution. The core of the structure is dominated by sequence motifs conserved among all DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferases, and these are responsible for cofactor binding and methyltransferase function."
https://openalex.org/W2086170256,"Mutations in the unc-17 gene of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans produce deficits in neuromuscular function. This gene was cloned and complementary DNAs were sequenced. On the basis of sequence similarity to mammalian vesicular transporters of biogenic amines and of localization to synaptic vesicles of cholinergic neurons in C. elegans, unc-17 likely encodes the vesicular transporter of acetylcholine. Mutations that eliminated all unc-17 gene function were lethal, suggesting that the acetylcholine transporter is essential. Molecular analysis of unc-17 mutations will allow the correlation of specific parts of the gene (and the protein) with observed functional defects. The mutants will also be useful for the isolation of extragenic suppressors, which could identify genes encoding proteins that interact with UNC-17."
https://openalex.org/W2133697422,"Using gene targeting in embryonic stem cells, we have generated mice with one or two null p53 germ line alleles. Mice with both p53 alleles inactivated are developmentally normal but highly susceptible to the early development of spontaneous tumors. Initial studies were performed in mice with a mixed inbred genetic background (75% C57BL/6 and 25% 129/Sv) (Donehower et al., Nature (London) 356, 215-221, 1992). To study the effect of genetic background on tumorigenesis in p53-deficient mice, we have put the p53 null allele into a pure 129/Sv background and monitored tumor development. 129/Sv mice with two p53 null alleles developed tumors sooner than the mixed genetic background p53-deficient animals. The most frequently observed tumor in p53 null mice of both genetic backgrounds was a malignant lymphoma. Because the 129/Sv strain has a low incidence of lymphoma, the frequent occurrence of lymphomas in all p53 null mice suggests that this particular tumor type may be a direct result of p53 loss and not a result of a particular genetic background. In addition to malignant lymphomas, the 129/Sv p53-deficient mice showed an increased incidence of aggressive teratocarcinomas (8 of 18 tumor-bearing males), a tumor type rare in virtually all inbred mice except for 129 strains. Thus, it appears that loss of p53 may accelerate a prior tumor predisposition and that genetic background can play a role in mediating both the rate and spectrum of tumor development in these mice."
https://openalex.org/W1600007560,"Abnormalities of zinc metabolism occur in Alzheimer's disease (AD), a condition where pathological catabolism of the amyloid protein precursor (APP) causes cerebral beta A4 amyloidosis. An association between zinc and APP metabolism was sought by studying the binding of 65Zn2+ to APP. 65Zn2+ bound in a rapid, saturable, and specific manner (KD = 764 nM). A novel zinc binding motif, strongly conserved between members of the APP family, was located between the cysteine-rich and negatively charged domains of the protein. Zinc increased binding of APP to heparin and has been shown to potentiate the inhibition of coagulation factor XIa by an APP isoform containing a Kunitz-type inhibitory domain (Komiyama, Y., Murakami, T., Egawa, H., Okubo, S., Yasunaga, K., and Murata, K. (1992) Thromb. Res. 66, 397-408) situated near the zinc binding region. Zinc is a factor that modulates the functional properties of the substrate for beta A4 amyloidogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1583559371,"The changes in gene expression leading to tail resorption that are initiated by thyroid hormone (TH) were studied in Xenopus laevis. Four of the less than 10 genes that are down-regulated during this period have been isolated; their mRNAs decay with identical kinetics. Twenty of the approximately 35 genes that are up-regulated in the first 48 h have been isolated. The up-regulated genes fall into two kinetic patterns. After a lag of several hours, the direct response genes (including thyroid hormone receptor beta) increase their mRNA level steadily for 24-48 h. The delayed genes respond mainly in the second 24 h after TH addition. The importance of these genes for tail resorption is supported by the fact that they are all regulated developmentally during normal metamorphosis in tail and respond to hormone induction when the tail becomes competent to respond to TH. The relatively simple gene expression program leading to tail resorption is contrasted with the complex and multiple periods of gene expression during limb development. The gene expression screen defines the tail resorption program and has isolated the majority of TH-regulated genes."
https://openalex.org/W1718629903,"A line of transgenic mice was constructed in which the human Glut1 glucose transporter is overexpressed in skeletal muscle. Overexpression of Glut1 protein was evident in epitrochlearis, extensor digitorum longus (EDL), and quadriceps muscles, and resulted in 6.6-7.4-fold elevations in basal glucose transport activity as measured in isolated muscles in vitro. The elevated glucose transporter activity in the skeletal muscles of transgenic mice was associated with a 10-fold increase in glycogen concentration in EDL and quadriceps muscles that was not due to an increase in muscle glycogen synthase activity or a decrease in glycogen phosphorylase activity. The increased glucose transport activity also resulted in a 2-fold increase in muscle lactate concentration, with no increase in muscle glucose 6-phosphate. Despite a slight (10%) increase in muscle hexokinase activity, there was a 4-fold increase in total muscle free glucose in transgenic mice, indicating that hexokinase becomes rate-limiting for glucose uptake when the rate of glucose transport is very high. These results demonstrate that the muscle glycogen content can be dramatically elevated by increasing the muscle Glut1 protein level and that glucose transport is a rate-limiting step for muscle glucose disposal in normal, resting mice."
https://openalex.org/W2094055083,"Invariant chain (li) is a nonpolymorphic glycoprotein that associates with major histocompatibility complex class II molecules and has been shown to mediate several functions in class II-restricted antigen presentation. A small proportion of li is modified by the addition of chondroitin sulfate (li-CS), and this form of li is associated with class II on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. In this report we show that expression of li-CS dramatically enhanced the ability of class II-positive EL4 transfectants to stimulate class II-dependent allogeneic and mitogenic T cell responses. Antibody blocking studies and the ability of CD44 to bind directly to li-CS suggest that li-CS can function as an accessory molecule during T cell responses through interactions with CD44."
https://openalex.org/W2049041716,"Fission yeast cut5 mutants cause cytokinesis in the absence of normal nuclear division. We show here that cut5+ is required for both the onset of S phase and the restraint of M phase before the completion of S phase. The primary defects in cut5 mutants occur prior to S phase, but cells suffer lethal damage during M phase. Mitosis and cytokinesis occur in the presence of hydroxyurea or in the double mutant cdc10-cut5 (the cdc10 mutation alone blocks progression from G1 to S). Gene cloning shows that cut5+ is identical to the fission yeast rad4+ gene, which is similar to human XRCC1. The rad4+/cut5+ gene is unique in its positive role for replication/repair and in its negative role for mitosis/cytokinesis. We propose a single/twin chromatid marking model for rad4+/cut5+ function in cell cycle control."
https://openalex.org/W2137428149,"The tumor suppressor p53 protein binds to the products of several viral oncogenes, including SV40 large T antigen. We reconstructed the p53-T antigen interaction in the yeast two-hybrid system, a genetic assay that uses the reconstitution of the activity of a transcriptional activator to detect protein-protein interactions. Using mutants of T antigen known to be defective in binding to p53, we demonstrate that the two-hybrid system is more sensitive than immunoprecipitation in the detection of weak interactions. We mutagenized the murine p53 gene and screened in the yeast assay for decreased reporter gene expression indicative of the failure of p53 to bind T antigen. This screen identified 34 p53 mutants, almost all of which contain at least one mutation in the conserved domains frequently found mutated in human cancers. These results support the idea that the function of the wild-type p53 protein requires residues involved in binding to T antigen, and indicate that this approach may be generally applicable in the analysis of protein-protein interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1566896910,"Rev-ErbA alpha (Rev-Erb) is a nuclear hormone receptor-related transcriptional activator that is encoded on the noncoding strand of the alpha-thyroid hormone receptor (TR) gene. The similarities between Rev-Erb and receptors for differentiating agents, as well as the abundance of Rev-Erb mRNA in fat, led us to study Rev-Erb gene expression during adipogenesis. Remarkably, Rev-Erb mRNA levels increased dramatically during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells into adipocytes. Rev-Erb was similarly induced in the related 3T3-F442A cell line but not in nondifferentiating 3T3-C2 cells. The time course of Rev-Erb induction was similar to that of C/EBP alpha, an important transcriptional regulator in adipocytes, and Rev-Erb mRNA was superinduced by cycloheximide. Nuclear run-on assays indicated that an increased rate of Rev-Erb mRNA synthesis accounted for the increased steady state mRNA levels; the half-life of Rev-Erb mRNA was indistinguishable in preadipocytes and adipocytes. Treatment of preadipocytes with retinoic acid inhibited adipocyte differentiation and also prevented Rev-Erb induction. Thus, there is a correlation between Rev-Erb gene expression and differentiation, and transcriptional regulation by Rev-Erb could play an important role in the generation and/or maintenance of the adipocyte phenotype. Interestingly, and possibly related to the overlap between the Rev-Erb gene and the exon specific for TR alpha 2, the induction of Rev-Erb was also associated with a 3-fold increase in the ratio of TR alpha 1 to TR alpha 2 mRNA levels, indicating that Rev-Erb expression has the potential to modulate adipocyte gene expression by multiple mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2010934068,"The structure of the bifunctional, pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme dialkylglycine decarboxylase was determined to 2.1-angstrom resolution. Model building suggests that a single cleavage site catalyzes both decarboxylation and transamination by maximizing stereoelectronic advantages and providing electrostatic and general base catalysis. The enzyme contains two binding sites for alkali metal ions. One is located near the active site and accounts for the dependence of activity on potassium ions. The other is located at the carboxyl terminus of an alpha helix. These sites help show how proteins can specifically bind alkali metals and how these ions can exert functional effects."
https://openalex.org/W1584647394,A thrombin-specific inhibitor with an apparent molecular mass of 11 kDa has been purified from the insect Rhodnius prolixus. Amino-terminal protein sequence analysis allowed the molecular cloning of the corresponding cDNA. The open reading frame codes for a protein of about 103 amino acid residues and displays an internal sequence homology of residues 6-48 with residues 57-101 indicating a two-domain structure. Based on the amino acid sequence the two domains exhibit high homology to protease inhibitors belonging to the Kazal-type family. Model building suggests that the first domain binds to the active site with residue His10 pointing into the specificity pocket. From gel filtration and tight-binding inhibition experiments the inhibitor appears to form 1:1 complexes with thrombin. Periplasma-directed heterologous expression of the rhodniin cDNA in Escherichia coli yields the intact thrombin inhibitor. Natural and recombinant rhodniin both display inhibition constants of about 2 x 10(-13) M.
https://openalex.org/W1516078935,"The activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) by a dual specific kinase, MEK (MAPK or ERK kinase), is a critical event in the mitogenic signal transduction pathway. However, little is known about the mechanism of ERK inactivation, which occurs after stimulation. In this report, we demonstrated that a dual specific protein phosphatase, HVH1 (human VH1 phosphatase homolog) whose expression is induced by mitogenic growth factors, specifically inactivates ERK. When several phosphoproteins were tested for recombinant HVH1, only MEK-activated ERK1 was dephosphorylated. HVH1 selectively dephosphorylated threonine and tyrosine residues but not serine residues of the activated ERK1. Inactivation of ERK1 by HVH1 could be reversed by MEK, suggesting that HVH1 dephosphorylates the same residues that are recognized and phosphorylated by MEK. Our results suggest that mitogenic growth factors transiently activate ERK (peak at 5 min followed by a rapid decline) by temporally activating MEK (the on signal) and inducing the expression of HVH phosphatase (the off signal)."
https://openalex.org/W2009706172,"Transcription-dependent DNA melting on the yeast GAL1 and GAL10 promoters was found to be more closely correlated with the TATA box than the transcription start site. On both these genes, melting begins about 20 base pairs downstream of the TATA box. Physical and genetic analyses suggest that RNA polymerase II associates with this region. Thus, the distance between promoter melting and the TATA box in yeast may be similar to that in higher eukaryotes, even though transcription initiates in a region about 10 to 90 base pairs farther downstream in yeast."
https://openalex.org/W1775527315,"A new method of differential expression cloning called differential display (DD) has been used to screen for novel tumor suppressor genes involved in breast cancer. The screen is based on positive selection at the mRNA level for genes expressed in normal mammary epithelial cells but decreased or lost in corresponding tumor cells. A candidate tumor suppressor gene recovered by DD is integrin alpha-6 (α6), a component of the heterodimeric integrin receptors α6β1 and α6β4. Loss of α6 expression was confirmed in total RNAs by Northern blot analysis and by immunostaining with α6 antibodies. Consistent with these cell culture findings, previous immunostaining of mammary tissue sections has identified decreased α6 protein expression during breast tumor progression. Southern blot analysis demonstrated that α6 gene is present in tumor cell lines, suggesting that re-expression may be inducible by pharmacological intervention. The likelihood that α6 may have tumor suppressing activity is supported by growing evidence of a central role for integrins in transducing growth control and differentiation signals from growth factors and the extracellular matrix (ECM).—Sager, R., Anisowicz, A., Neveu, M., Liang, P., Sotiropoulou, G.

https://openalex.org/W1550160409,Low starch mutants of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii were isolated after x-ray mutagenesis of wild-type strain 137C. The mutants accumulated 20-40% of the normal amount and displayed a 2-fold decrease of the total glycogen-primed soluble starch synthase activity. Three different mutant alleles of the st-3 gene were isolated that were characterized by similar defects and displayed a net increase in amylose content. Amylose-primed synthesis of glucan in native gels revealed a complete wipe out of one of the soluble starch synthases. Zymograms and kinetic analyses performed both in the mutant and in partially purified wild type extracts reveal at least two distinct activities that are partly analogous to higher plant soluble starch synthases I and II (SSI and II). The st-3 mutants were defective for SSII. Methylation and debranching of the purified amylopectin fraction clearly show a decrease in the number of intermediate size glucans (dp8 to 50) and an absolute and relative increase of very short glucans (dp2 to 7). These results suggest that a soluble starch synthase may be necessary for the synthesis or maintenance of intermediate size glucans that are the main component of the branched clusters of amylopectin.
https://openalex.org/W1554786089,"We have demonstrated that a single intraperitoneal injection of cationic liposomes complexed to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene expression plasmid can transfect the majority of splenic Thy 1.2+ T lymphocytes, as well as significant numbers of bone marrow-derived hematopoietic cells, in adult mice. CAT activity was detected in the spleen for at least 2 weeks, and there was no evidence of treatment-related toxicity. Some degree of tissue-specific transgene expression was achieved by varying the cationic lipid used."
https://openalex.org/W2135726266,"Anterior body pattern in Drosophila is specified by the graded distribution of the bicoid protein (bcd), which activates subordinate genes in distinct anterior domains. Subsequently, transcription of these target genes is repressed at the anterior pole owing to the activity of the receptor tyrosine kinase torso (tor). We show that both activation by bcd and repression by tor can be reproduced by a minimal promoter containing only bcd-binding sites upstream of a naive transcriptional start site. Repression requires the D-raf kinase and is associated with phosphorylation of bcd protein. Repression does not require either tailless or huckebein, which were previously thought to constitute the sole zygotic output of the tor signaling system. Finally, addition of a heterologous transcriptional activation domain to bcd renders the protein insensitive to tor-mediated repression. We propose that phosphorylation resulting from the activity of the tor signal transduction cascade down-regulates transcriptional activation by the bcd morphogen."
https://openalex.org/W1537196537,"The immunosuppressant rapamycin selectively abolishes phosphorylation and activation of p70s6k/p85s6k at concentrations that either block or suppress cell growth. The four sites of phosphorylation associated with p70s6k/p85s6k activation all display Ser/Thr-Pro motifs and are closely clustered within a putative autoinhibitory domain of the enzyme. To produce a constitutively active, rapamycin-resistant form of the kinase, these four sites were converted to either Asp or Glu. When overexpressed in human 293 cells, the activity of the mutant is similar to that of the parent enzyme, under conditions where the parent is phosphorylated and active. Unexpectedly, however, the mutant remains sensitive to rapamycin and is inactivated in vitro by protein phosphatase 2A. Peptide maps reveal that rapamycin abolishes the activity of the overexpressed p70s6k through the dephosphorylation of a novel set of sites distinct from those associated with mitogenic activation."
https://openalex.org/W1491633359,"To investigate the role of the alpha subunit cytoplasmic domain in the regulation of VLA-2 functional activity, we expressed several chimeric and deleted forms of the alpha 2 subunit in two different human cell lines, K562 and RD. Each mutant construct formed surface VLA-2 heterodimers as efficiently as wild type alpha 2 subunit, except for a construct (X2CO1127) truncated just before the consensus GFFKR cytoplasmic domain motif, that was not expressed at the cell surface. Truncation of the alpha 2 cytoplasmic domain just after the GFFKR motif resulted in a complete loss of constitutive activity of VLA-2 in RD cells. If the integrin was already constitutively inactive, as in K562 cells, the cytoplasmic domain deletion had no effect. In both K562 and RD cells, cytoplasmic tail deletion eliminated up-regulation of adhesion in response to the phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). In comparison, exchange of the alpha 2 cytoplasmic domain with the alpha 4 or alpha 5 cytoplasmic domains had no effect on constitutive activity (in RD cells), or on constitutive inactivity (in K562 cells) and did not eliminate PMA-stimulated activity (in K562 or RD cells). These results clearly demonstrate that the cytoplasmic domain of an alpha chain (not necessarily from alpha 2 itself) is required to maintain VLA-2 constitutive activity and to allow a responsiveness to PMA stimulation. In cases where VLA-2 was either constitutively inactive (as in K562 cells) or inactive due to cytoplasmic domain deletion (e.g. in RD cells), agents such as Mn2+ or the anti-beta 1 monoclonal antibody TS2/16 caused a marked increase in adhesive function, thus proving that the integrins were not irreversibly inactive, and that cellular regulatory constraints could be bypassed by extracellular stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2029502046,"MDCK cells expressing the polymeric immunoglobulin (poly-Ig) receptor, cocultured with IgA-producing hybridoma cells, transported dimeric IgA (dIgA) from the basolateral into the lumenal compartment, where it was recovered as secretory component-dIgA complexes. The tail of the receptor was phosphorylated on serines 664 and 726. Each serine was mutated to alanine. Appearance of A726 receptor at the basolateral surface was reduced approximately 5-fold. This was accompanied by a approximately 5-fold reduction in dIgA transcytosis. Basolateral delivery of receptor was not affected by mutation A664, and in the absence of dIgA, the receptor accumulated in recycling basolateral endosomes. In coculture, however, dIgA transcytosis by A664 receptor was normal. Thus, entry of receptor into the transcytotic pathway requires Ser-664 phosphorylation only in the absence of dIgA."
https://openalex.org/W1493045353,"R-phycoerythrin is the major light-harvesting pigment protein of most red algal phycobilisomes. It is composed of three pigmented polypeptide subunits, the alpha, beta, and gamma. While alpha and beta phycoerythrin subunits are each unique in the red alga Aglaothamnion neglectum, there are two different gamma subunits with distinct molecular masses. Both gamma subunits are pigmented by virtue of covalently attached linear tetrapyrroles. The amino acid sequence of one of the gamma subunits, as deduced from the nucleotide sequence of a cDNA clone, has no significant similarity to any known sequence in the data bases. This result is surprising, since the gamma subunit of phycoerythrin is thought to have a function that is similar to cyanobacterial linker polypeptides. The A. neglectum gamma subunit is synthesized as a 36-kDa precursor protein that is processed at the amino terminus to yield a 33-kDa mature protein. The amino-terminal extension was able to direct the pea small subunit of Rubisco into isolated pea chloroplasts. This result suggests that red algae transport proteins into the plastid by a mechanism similar to that of higher plants. There are significant changes in levels of mRNA encoding the gamma 33 subunit when A. neglectum is grown under different conditions of illumination and in nitrogen-deficient medium. These changes parallel those previously observed for transcripts encoding the alpha and beta phycoerythrin subunits. Hence, there may be coordinated expression of nuclear and plastid-encoded phycoerythrin subunit genes."
https://openalex.org/W1513453028,"The sopI gene, which encodes the phototaxis receptor sensory rhodopsin I (SR-I), was expressed in Halobacterium salinarium strains with chromosomal deletions of (i) sopI only or of (ii) the region containing sopI and htrI. The htrI gene encodes a transducer protein for SR-I signals. Transformation of the sopI deletion mutant containing the htrI gene by a multicopy expression plasmid for sopI results in normal physiological and photochemical properties of SR-I. Transformation by the same plasmid of the mutant lacking the htrI gene as well as sopI results in production of pigment with a normal absorption spectrum but altered photochemical properties, and no phototaxis by the transformants. Analysis of flash-induced absorbance changes shows that the transducer protein increases light-induced production of the photocycle intermediate S373, the SR-I signaling conformation, and modulates the rate of S373 return to the prestimulus state, rendering this return pH-independent. These effects are interpreted in terms of receptor/transducer interactions that influence proton transfer reactions occurring in the photoactive site."
https://openalex.org/W1549302862,"The membrane lipid composition in several strains of Acholeplasma laidlawii is regulated upon a change in the growth conditions. Monoglucosyldiacylglycerol (MGlcDAG) and diglucosyldiacylglycerol (DGlcDAG) are the most abundant lipids in the A. laidlawii membrane. A third glucolipid, 3-O-acyl-monoglucosyldiacylglycerol (MAMGlcDAG) is synthesized by strain A-EF22 when the membrane lipids contain large amounts of saturated acyl chains. The lipid regulation can be understood from a simple theoretical model, in which the cells strive to maintain a balance between the lipids constituting a bilayer and those forming reversed non-lamellar liquid crystalline phases. Thus, the physical chemistry of membrane lipids, in particular their ability to form different aggregate structures, constitutes the basis for the lipid regulation, and therefore an understanding of the phase equilibria of membrane lipids is crucial. MGlcDAG and MAMGlcDAG isolated from A. laidlawii strain A-EF22 membranes were studied mainly by 2H NMR, 1H NMR, and 1H NMR diffusion measurements. MAMGlcDAG, containing 96 mol % saturated acyl chains formed a gel/crystalline phase up to about 80 degrees C, where a transition occurred to a reversed micellar (L2) phase. This is an unexpected finding for a membrane lipid. However, this lipid homogeneously mixes with the other membrane lipids at physiological temperatures. Previous and new data on MGlcDAG show that the lamellar phase is stabilized when the length and the degree of unsaturation of the acyl chains are decreased. The physicochemical properties of MAMGlcDAG and MGlcDAG were compared and found to be of great significance for the physiological regulation of the lipids in the membrane. MAMGlcDAG is synthesized under conditions when the phase equilibria of MGlcDAG are shifted from a non-lamellar toward a lamellar phase. Apart from MAMGlcDAG, MGlcDAG is the major lipid in A. laidlawii strain A-EF22 which is able to form reversed aggregate structures. MAMGlcDAG probably assists MGlcDAG in maintaining an optimal molecular packing, or negative curvature, of the lipids in the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W306028978,"Phorbol ester-sensitive and -resistant EL4 thymoma cell lines differ in their ability to activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in response to phorbol ester. Treatment of wild-type EL4 cells with phorbol ester results in the rapid activations of MAPK and pp90rsk kinase, a substrate for MAPK, while neither kinase is activated in response to phorbol ester in variant EL4 cells. This study examines the activation of MAPK kinase (MAPKK), an activator of MAPK, in wild-type and variant EL4 cells. Phosphorylation of a 40-kDa substrate, identified as MAPK, was observed following in vitro phosphorylation reactions using cytosolic extracts or Mono Q column fractions prepared from phorbol ester-treated wild-type EL4 cells. MAPKK activity coeluted with a portion of the inactive MAPK upon Mono Q anion-exchange chromatography, permitting detection of the MAPKK activity in fractions containing both kinases. This MAPKK activity was present in phorbol ester-treated wild-type cells, but not in phorbol ester-treated variant cells or in untreated wild-type or variant cells. The MAPKK from wild-type cells was able to activate MAPK prepared from either wild-type or variant cells. MAPKK activity could be stimulated in both wildtype and variant EL4 cells in response to treatment of cells with okadaic acid. These results indicate that the failure of variant EL4 cells to activate MAP kinase in response to phorbol ester is due to a failure to activate MAPKK. Therefore, the step that confers phorbol ester resistance to variant EL4 cells lies between the activation of protein kinase C and the activation of MAPKK."
https://openalex.org/W1594989334,"Small-angle x-ray scattering and computer modeling have been used to study the effects of ligand binding to the leucine/isoleucine/valine-binding protein, an initial component of the high-affinity active transport system for branched-chain aliphatic amino acids in Escherichia coli. Measurements were made with no ligand present and with either L-leucine or L-valine present. Upon binding of either leucine or valine, there is a decrease in the radius of gyration, from 23.2 +/- 0.2 to 22.2 +/- 0.2 A, and in the maximum particle dimension, from 82 +/- 3 to 73 +/- 3 A. The x-ray structure of the unbound form has been determined and gives a radius of gyration and a maximum dimension consistent with the values found for the solution structure in this study (Sack, J. S., Saper, M. A., and Quiocho, F. A. (1989) J. Mol. Biol. 206, 171-191). The reduction in the radius of gyration and maximum dimension upon ligand binding can be accounted for by a substrate-induced cleft closure in a combined hinge-twist motion. Modeling of the substrate-bound state was done by comparison of this protein with another periplasmic binding protein (L-arabinose-binding protein), which possesses a similar two-lobe structure and for which the x-ray structure is known in its ligand-bound form."
https://openalex.org/W1948721092,"Mutational inactivation of p53, a tumor suppressor gene, is the most common genetic alteration found in human cancer. Most mutated p53s either lose tumor suppressor function or gain oncogenic activity. We recently reported the detection of a heterozygous point mutation of p53 at codon 280 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) (1), a high-incidence malignancy in southern China and southeast Asia. Given its heterozygous state, in which both wild-type and mutated p53 gene were expressed, p53-thr280 should function dominantly in the presence of the wild-type form if it is to play a role in nasopharynx carcinogenesis. We tested this dominance hypothesis in the cells of two model systems: 1) human Saos-2 cells lacking endogenous p53, and 2) mouse JB6 tumor promotion-resistant cells (P−) expressing endogenous wild-type p53. The results showed dosage-dependent dominance of p53-thr280 in controlling WT p53-driven transcriptional activity; in governing cell growth; and in progressing P− phenotype to tumor promotion-sensitive (P−) phenotype. This dominant negative effect was seen at a 1:1 (WT:MU) ratio and was more striking at a ratio of 1:3. A model is proposed to explain the dominant negative effect of mutant p53. We conclude from this study that p53-thr280 is likely to be dominant in the heterozygous state found in NPC and that this dominant-negative mutated p53 may contribute to the genesis of NPC or of other carcinomas in which both mutant and wild-type p53 are expressed.—Sun, Y., Dong, Z., Nakamura, K., Colburn, N. H. Dosage-dependent dominance over wild-type p53 of a mutant p53 isolated from nasopharyngeal carcinoma. FASEB J. 7: 944-950; 1993."
https://openalex.org/W1551343703,"The reaction of (E)-4,5-epoxy-(E)-2-heptenal with butylamine and glycine methyl ester produced brown macromolecular pigments, which showed fluorescent characteristics similar to lipofuscins. This polymerization reaction implies in the first step the formation of 1-alkyl-2-(1'-hydroxyalkyl)pyrroles (IV, VI). Compounds IV and VI have been isolated and characterized from the above reactions, and their structures confirmed with the synthesis of 2-(1'-hydroxyethyl)-1-methylpyrrole (V). Compounds IV-VI resulted very unstable and even diluted solutions of them polymerized with time. The first step was the production of a dipyrrymethane VIII, which evolved more stable dipyrrylmethenes IX and X by intramolecular dehydration. These dimers continued polymerizing to produce 16H-tripyrrin derivatives XI and XII, and, in the next step, hexahydroglobins XIII and XIV. All these compounds have been characterized by 1H NMR and/or gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry or mass spectrometry. Additional polymerization produced higher molecular weight polymers that were the responsible for the brown color and the fluorescence. The above results suggest that the fluorescence produced by reaction between some oxidized lipids and amino acids may be related to polymerization more than to the formation of single structures."
https://openalex.org/W1531447696,"A unique property of the liver-type member of the family of fatty acid-binding proteins is the heterogeneic pattern observed upon isolation, which can only partly be ascribed to the state of lipidation. Here we unraveled the structural basis of the heterogeneity of delipidated liver-type fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP). Charge fractions of L-FABP focusing at pH 6.0 and at pH 7.0/7.1 were first isolated from bovine liver. Upon reduction, however, two distinct isoforms, namely pI 6.0 L-FABP and pI 7.0 L-FABP, were observed. From these isoforms peptides were generated enzymically and chemically by four independent methods. Peptides were separated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography and analyzed by Edman degradation and plasma desorption mass spectrometry. The complete amino acid sequences of the isoforms were established; they consist of 127 amino acids and each is N-terminally blocked with an acetyl group. The difference between pI 6.0 L-FABP and pI 7.0 L-FABP was attributed to an asparagine-aspartate exchange at position 105. When tryptic peptides of the pH 7.0/7.1 fraction were analyzed, discrepancies between sequence and mass data of the peptides containing at position 69 the sole cysteine of L-FABP led to the disclosure of a cysteinylation occurring at this position and giving rise to the slightly more basic pH 7.1 species. Moreover, chemical modification studies revealed that a part of the pH 6.0 fraction was pI 7.0 L-FABP that was glutathionylated at Cys69. Neither modification, however, prevented the binding of fatty acids. Together amino acid exchange and covalent modification of cysteine entirely explain the heterogeneity of L-FABP from bovine liver."
https://openalex.org/W1712332855,"The pattern of human retinoblastoma (RB1) gene protein expression was directly examined in normal and malignant human colorectal tissues and in seven colorectal carcinoma cell lines by immunohistochemistry using the mouse monoclonal antibody (RB-MAb-1) directed against the retinoblastoma protein (RB). This is the first demonstration of RB immunostaining in adult human colonic epithelium and colorectal carcinomas. Specificity using RB-MAb-1 was confirmed by western blot analysis, which showed bands of 110-116 kDa corresponding to the sizes of unphosphorylated and phosphorylated RB. RB staining of normal adult colonic epithelium was confined to the nucleus and was most intense in the transitional zone of the crypt, whereas lumenal cells (fully differentiated) were RB negative. Primary colorectal carcinomas and all the colon cancer cell lines stained positively for nuclear RB, but the expression was heterogeneous with varying fractions of RB negative cells present. Because we and others have previously shown that loss or inactivation of the RB1 gene is infrequent in colorectal carcinomas, reduced RB expression in such cells is probably due to a cellular regulatory mechanism. For example, RB negative cells may be those in early-G1 phase (known to have reduced RB levels) or growth-arrested cells that have differentiated. The ability to directly detect RB in primary colorectal carcinomas will permit assessment of whether heterogeneous expression of the RB1 gene product has prognostic significance for survival of patients with this cancer.—Ali, A.

https://openalex.org/W1563225730,"The interaction of circulating factor VII/VIIa with tissue factor presented by cells in extravascular tissues represents the initial event in the extrinsic pathway of blood coagulation. To determine the tissue factor binding domains in human factor VIIa, we have subjected recombinant human factor VIIa to tryptic digestion and isolated two proteolytic fragments (molecular mass = 32 and 20 kDa) by a combination of immunoaffinity chromatography and reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) which strongly inhibits the tissue factor-enhanced amidolytic activity of factor VIIa and inhibits the activation of factor X by factor VIIa in the presence of tissue factor. The 32-kDa factor VIIa fragment consisted of residues 1-137/143 from the light chain of factor VIIa connected by a disulfide bond to residues 153-277 from the heavy chain. The 20-kDa factor VIIa fragment consisted of residues 1-137 of the light chain of factor VIIa in disulfide linkage with residues 248-266 of the heavy chain. The 32- and 20-kDa factor VIIa fragments inhibited the tissue factor apoprotein-enhanced factor VIIa amidolytic activity with Ki values of 35 and 65 nM, respectively. The Ki values for the inhibition of relipidated tissue factor apoprotein-enhanced factor VIIa amidolytic activity by the 32- and 20-kDa factor VIIa fragments were 70 and 610 nM, respectively. Factor X activation by factor VIIa-relipidated tissue factor was inhibited half-maximally by the 32- and 20-kDa factor VIIa fragments at 65 and 680 nM concentrations, respectively. Equilibrium binding studies indicated that the 32- and 20-kDa factor VIIa fragments interacted with cell surface tissue factor expressed on J82 cells in a specific and saturable manner with Kd values of 30 and 64 nM, respectively. In addition, a peptide consisting of residues 1-109 from the light chain of factor VIIa obtained by reduction and HPLC of the 20-kDa factor VIIa fragment retained inhibitory activity, but the selective removal of the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid domain from the 20-kDa factor VIIa fragment by cathepsin G cleavage resulted in the complete loss of inhibitory activity in this fragment. Our data strongly suggest that the epidermal growth factor-like domains covalently linked to the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid domain in factor VIIa constitute the high affinity tissue factor binding domain in this molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1502991557,"Activating mutations within the p53 gene cause stabilization and therefore increased steady-state levels of the p53 protein; some, but not all, also result in the generation of an epitope recognized by the antibody pAB240. We have shown here that in 70% of Burkitt lymphoma cell lines, but not in normal EBV transformed B cell lines, p53 protein is readily detectable by Western blot analysis using either an antibody directed against the 240 epitope or an antibody against wild-type p53. Genomic analysis of these BL cell lines demonstrated the presence of mutations within the p53 gene in all cell lines with detectable p53 protein. We have also shown that in the cell lines ST486, Raji, and TE 110, which are heterozygous for a neutral sequence codon polymorphism (Arg/Pro) that causes altered migration of an otherwise normal protein and also contain a heterozygous mutation, only the protein derived from the mutated allele is stabilized. Thus the dominant effect of the mutations present in these cell lines apparently does not result from sequestering of the normal protein by the abnormal protein, and therefore presumably is a consequence of a gain-of-function resulting from the mutation. Although all cell lines with stabilized p53 also contained p53 mutations, three lymphoid tumors (two cell lines and one fresh B-CLL) with a heterozygous mutation at codon 248 did not express elevated levels of p53. In contrast, p53 was readily detectable in Western blot analysis from cell lines KK124, Namalwa, and CA46, which had homo- or hemizygous mutations at codon 248, and from PP1084, a cell line with a codon 273 mutation and a carboxyl-terminal truncation in the other allele. These results suggest that mutations at codon 248, unlike those in cell lines ST486 and TE110, are stabilizing only in the absence of the wild-type p53. Heterozygous mutations at codons 248 have been described in the germline of individuals belonging to cancer-prone families described by Li and Fraumeni (see ref 18), but tumors detected in such individuals are homozygous, i.e., contain only mutated p53. This is consistent with the possibility that such mutations exert a pathogenetic effect only in the absence of the wild-type protein, and are coupled to our findings that stabilization of p53 is a necessary component of the oncogenic pathways relevant to p53. However, whereas some mutations are stabilizing in the presence of the normal p53 protein, others are stabilizing only in the homozygous state."
https://openalex.org/W2223601361,"During short incubations of a Golgi apparatus-enriched subcellular fraction from rat liver with UDP-[3H]GlcNAc, label is efficiently transferred to endogenous acceptors. Most of the macromolecular radioactivity is specifically released by peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase, indicating that it is mainly associated with N-linked oligosaccharides. The glycoprotein acceptors are resistant to proteases unless detergent is added in amounts greater than the critical micellar concentration. This shows that the acceptors are within the lumen of intact compartments, which have the correct topological orientation expected for the Golgi apparatus in intact cells. Structural characterization of the radiolabeled N-linked oligosaccharides shows a variety of distinct neutral and anionic species. The neutral chains include bi-, tri-, and tetra-antennary molecules with terminal beta-[3H] GlcNAc residues. In vitro sialylation shows that some of the tetra-antennary chains have beta 1,3-linked Gal residues on their unlabeled antennae. An unknown modification appears to block the action of beta-galactosidase on these galactosylated oligosaccharides. Chasing the labeling reaction with a mixtures of UDP-Gal, CMP-Neu5Ac, and adenosine 3'-phosphate,5'-phosphosulfate causes an increase in the percent of radiolabeled anionic oligosaccharides. Most of the negative charge is due to sialic acid (Sia), and some appears to be in phosphodiester-linked [3H]GlcNAc. The sialylated oligosaccharides are a mixture of bi-, tri-, and tetra-antennary species with 1-3-Sia residues, and some of the [3H]GlcNAc residues are directly covered with unlabeled Gal and Sia residues. This in vitro approach should recapitulate reactions that occur in the biosynthesis of N-linked oligosaccharides in the Golgi apparatus of the intact cell. Since the conditions during labeling do not permit inter-compartmental transport, the oligosaccharides produced should represent the biosynthetic capabilities of individual Golgi compartments. Evidence is presented for a functional association of GlcNAc transferases I, II, and alpha-mannosidase II, with separation from GlcNAc transferase IV and/or V. The structures also indicate co-compartmentalization of several GlcNAc transferase(s) with beta-galactosyltransferase(s) and sialyltransferase(s). The compartmental organization of the Golgi apparatus is discussed in light of these findings."
https://openalex.org/W1541832142,"Proinsulin is converted to equimolar amounts of insulin and connecting peptide (C-peptide) in pancreatic beta cell secretory granules. The fate of C-peptide, which remains soluble in granules while insulin is crystallized, was studied in a rat insulinoma cell line (INS cells). A pulse-chase approach demonstrated that insulin to C-peptide ratios (I/CP) began to rise in INS cells as soon as conversion took place, reaching 2.2:1 at 6 h of chase, and 5.3:1 by 24 h. During the first 4 h of chase, this ratio was inverted in the medium under basal conditions, possibly reflecting preferential secretion of C-peptide via the post granular constitutive-like pathway. However, the amount of C-peptide secreted to the medium (1.4%/h) was trivial compared with the net loss of C-peptide from the INS cells, estimated to be approximately 33% during the 1st h. As no extracellular degradation of insulin or C-peptide was observed, the data show progressive, extensive intracellular degradation of C-peptide. Stimulation of INS granule exocytosis revealed that the I/CP ratio in secretory granules is representative of that of cell extracts, indicating that C-peptide, but not insulin, is lost from functionally competent granules with time. This particular degradative route for C-peptide is thus distinct from crinophagy (fusion of granules and lysosomes) and was found to be much more active in INS cells than in primary islet beta cells."
https://openalex.org/W1507611783,"When stimulated, endothelial cells release arachidonic acid from phospholipids and oxidize it to eicosanoids. The rate-limiting step in this pathway is the initial release step, catalyzed by phospholipase(s), a process that exhibits growth-dependent changes. We examined the role of protein kinase C (PKC) as a regulator of this process. Activators and inhibitors of protein kinase C, used at different growth states, demonstrated distinct differences in their effects on arachidonic acid release, consistent with a growth-dependent change in PKC activity (with greater activity in proliferating cells compared with quiescent cells). Although immunoreactive PKC was slightly greater in the proliferating cells, there was a more striking redistribution of PKC activity between cytosol and membrane. To identify the cause, we measured the diacylglycerol (DG) content and found that DG concentrations decreased as cells progressed from preconfluence to confluence. Further studies demonstrated increases in DG kinase and DG lipase in confluent compared with preconfluent cells, consistent with the alterations in DG content. These findings suggest that growth-dependent changes in DG lipase and DG kinase activities regulate basal DG levels and PKC activity. The consequent alteration in PKC activity regulates the growth-dependent changes in arachidonic acid release."
https://openalex.org/W1500366283,"When a rat liver Golgi apparatus-enriched subcellular fraction is incubated with UDP-[3H]Gal, CMP-[3H] Neu5Ac, or [acetyl-3H]acetyl (Ac)-CoA, label is efficiently transferred to endogenous acceptors, which are resistant to added proteases, unless detergent is added at a sufficiently high concentration. Thus, the acceptors are within the lumen of intact compartments of correct topological orientation, which are likely to be similar to those of the Golgi apparatus in the intact cell. In each case, approximately 90% of the macromolecular radioactivity is specifically released by peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase digestion, as labeled N-linked oligosaccharides. Label from UDP-[3H]Gal is transferred to several distinct N-linked oligosaccharides, and many of these carry sialic acid (Sia) residues. This amount increases if the transfer reaction is chased with CMP-Neu5Ac. A major fraction of the [3H]Gal is directly ""covered"" with Sia residues, indicating that at least a portion of the beta-galactosyltransferase(s) are co-localized with one or more sialyltransferases. The majority of the [3H]Gal is found in a beta 1,3-linkage, rather than the more common beta 1,4-linkage. The N-linked oligosaccharides labeled by CMP-[3H] Neu5Ac carry labeled Sia residues in either alpha 2,3 or alpha 2,6 linkage, and showed a range of charge distribution. The transferred [3H]Neu5Ac is not O-acetylated even when Ac-CoA is added at saturating concentrations, implying that the sialyltransferases and the O-acetyltransferase(s) are not functionally co-localized. However, approximately 20% of label released from N-linked oligosaccharides by sialidase does not co-migrate with authentic Neu5Ac in high performance liquid chromatography analysis, indicating that transferred [3H] Neu5Ac is modified by unknown enzymes in the Golgi. Most of the [3H]acetate transferred from [acetyl-3H] Ac-CoA to N-linked oligosaccharides is on Sia residues that are exclusively alpha 2,6-linked, and is enriched on tri- and tetra-antennary chains that do not appear to carry any 2,3-linked Sia residues. These data indicate a restricted substrate preference of the O-acetyltransferase(s). About one-quarter of the [3H]acetate transferred is sialidase-resistant, indicating either transfer to monosaccharides other than sialic acid, or to sialidase-resistant sialic acids. While most of these sialidase-resistant oligosaccharides remain negatively charged, about 10% are neutralized by sialidase, confirming transfer of [3H]acetate to monosaccharides other than sialic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1576403388,"Endogenous acceptors in a Golgi apparatus-enriched subcellular fraction from rat liver were labeled with UDP-[3H]GalNAc. The great majority of these acceptors were protected from protease degradation in the absence of detergent. These molecules are therefore present in intact vesicles of the correct topological orientation, which are likely to be similar to the Golgi compartments of the intact cell. Several distinct glycoproteins are labeled, but most are different from those labeled with UDP-[3H]GlcNAc. The enzyme peptide-N4(N-acetyl-beta-glucosiminyl)asparagine amidase releases label from a few specific proteins, indicating that [3H]GalNAc is transferred to N-linked oligosaccharides. Both neutral and anionic N-linked oligosaccharides are found, the great majority of which do not bind to ConA-Sepharose. Most of the [3H]GalNAc found in neutral oligosaccharides is terminal and beta-linked. The negative charge on the anionic molecules is due to sialic acid, and phosphate. A major portion of the [3H] GalNAc in this fraction is acid labile, and is released with kinetics consistent with it being in a phosphodiester linkage. These results show the existence of a whole new class of GalNAc-containing N-linked oligosaccharides, and demonstrates that this in vitro approach can detect previously undescribed structures. O-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis was also studied in the same labeled rat liver Golgi apparatus preparations. beta-Elimination releases approximately 95% of the peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase (PNGase F)-resistant label which, in the absence of other added nucleotides, is almost exclusively [3H] GalNAcitol. If other unlabeled sugar nucleotides and adenosine 3'-phosphate,5'-phosphosulfate are added during the chase period two anionic O-linked oligosaccharides are synthesized, indicating that the UDP-GalNAc:peptide-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase is at least in part functionally co-localized with enzymes that extend and modify O-linked oligosaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W2413688649,"Abstract A truncated form of the methionyl-tRNA synthetase (delta MTS), which has been cloned, overproduced, and characterized, was used in an attempt to better understand the role of the enzyme-bound zinc in the amino-acylation process. Apo-, Zn(2+)-, Co(2+)-, and 113Cd(2+)-substituted delta MTS proteins were prepared in vivo and purified to homogeneity. Apo-delta MTS was devoid of enzymatic activity in the aminoacylation of tRNA(fMet) and in the methionine-dependent ATP-pyrophosphate exchange reactions. Kinetic constants in both the aminoacylation and ATP-pyrophosphate exchange reactions for the Co(2+)- and 113Cd(2+)-substituted delta MTS proteins were found to be identical with those of the native Zn2+ protein. The low energy absorption spectrum of Co(2+)-substituted delta MTS resembles the d-d transition bands characteristic of tetrahedrally coordinated Co(2+)-substituted proteins. A strong S-->Co2+ charge transfer absorption at 350 nm was clearly evident having a molar absorptivity consistent with four thiolate ligands. The environment of the metal center was further probed by measuring the 113Cd chemical shift of 113Cd(2+)-substituted delta MTS. A single resonance at 759.6 ppm was observed. This chemical shift is consistent with Cd2+ coordinated to four thiolate ligands. The Escherichia coli methionyl-tRNA synthetase contains a potential metal binding sequence Cys-X2-Cys-X9-Cys-X2-Cys in a connecting polypeptide within the nucleotide fold. Titration of a 21-amino acid peptide corresponding to this putative metal binding site, Cys145-Cys161, was shown to bind Co2+ with a Kd of 120 +/- 11 microM. These results demonstrate that the isolated zinc finger binding domain is capable of specifically forming a stoichiometric complex with the divalent cation. Taken together, our studies identify the 4 cysteine residues in the zinc finger-like domain as the metal binding ligands in the E. coli methionyl-tRNA synthetase. The role of the enzyme-bound metal appears to be structural and not directly involved in catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1807620654,"Transcription initiation from eukaryotic protein-coding genes is a complex process that minimally requires RNA polymerase (pol) II (B) and at least seven general transcription factors. The 38-kDa subunit (TBP) of the human general transcription factor TFIID recognizes the TATA sequence element and initiates the assembly of the other general transcription factors and RNA pol II. It is believed, based on experiments with yeast recombinant protein, that TBP binds as a monomer to DNA. Using purified recombinant human TBP protein we find that TBP interacts with the TATA element as both a monomer and a dimer. The multimeric binding of TBP to DNA revealed by this study has important implications for the role of TBP in transcription initiation and suggests novel mechanisms whereby other transcription factors may interact with a RNA pol II preinitiation complex."
https://openalex.org/W1511009415,"A novel clathrin assembly protein (designated cardiac AP-3) has been isolated from dog heart which forms a K+ channel in planar lipid bilayers. AP-3 facilitated the in vitro formation of clathrin cages, which is diagnostic for clathrin assembly proteins. AP-3 consists mainly of 100-, 97-, and 55-kDa bands. A GTP-binding protein of approximately 25 kDa also co-purifies. The 100-kDa band was recognized by a monoclonal antibody to the gamma-adaptin of bovine brain clathrin assembly protein AP-1. A polyclonal antibody to the approximately 100-kDa doublet (alpha- and beta-adaptins) of bovine brain AP-2 did not cross-react with the purified protein. Western blot analysis of cardiac subcellular fractions showed that anti-AP-1 immunoreactivity was strongest in a sarcolemma-enriched fraction. Little immunoreactivity was detected in other cardiac subfractions, including sarcoplasmic reticulum, intercalated discs, and mitochondria. When reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers, AP-3 displays ion channel activity. Permeability ratios were PK/PCl approximately 16 and PK/PNa approximately 3, indicating a cation-selective channel somewhat selective for K+ versus Na+. The K+ channel displays several subconductance states (9 and 12 picosiemens in the main) and was blocked by CaCl2 (mM), inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (20 microM), inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate) (40 microM), and guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotrisphosphate) (mM). Thus, the cardiac AP-3 appears to act as a K+ channel modulated by inositol polyphosphates and a small GTP-binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W1532583633,"The light-regulated mRNA and polypeptide accumulation of the nuclear encoded subunit II (PsaD) of the photosystem I reaction center was studied during the greening of etiolated spinach seedlings. Upon exposure to continuous white light, the mRNA, detected at low levels in etiolated seedlings, accumulated in a specific pattern. In contrast, the PsaD subunit could not be detected in the etiolated seedlings; the polypeptide could first be detected in thylakoid membranes approximately 4 h after exposure to continuous light. A pulse of red light induced the expression of the PsaD mRNA, but the polypeptide could not be detected unless the seedlings were exposed to light. In the light (but not in the dark), the PsaD mRNA was found associated with the polysomal fraction. Taken together, the data suggest a dual regulatory mechanism in which both the level of mRNA and the presence of light control the accumulation of the PsaD polypeptide."
