All ancient civilizations, no matter how enlightened or creative, rested on slavery and on grinding human labor, because human and animal muscle power were the principal forms of energy available for mechanical work. The discovery of ways to use less expensive sources of energy than human muscles made it possible for men to be free. The men and women of rural India are tied to poverty and misery because they use too little energy and use it inefficiently, and nearly all they use is secured by their own physical efforts. A transformation of rural Indian society could be brought about by increasing the quantity and improving the technology of energy use."

Distribution of macroinfauna in the bight is limited to bottom areas not subjected to periodic anoxic conditions."

The X chromosome of some cells reacts differently from the autosome to the protozoan infection. Some chromosomes show specific, easily traceable points after infection by the virus. Some of the effects of these infections may be similar to the effects of infective agents in other organisms."

The latest and most active encounter, in June 1975, is interpreted as a meteoroid c(loud of diameter 0.1 astronomical unit and total mass 10(l3) to 10(14) grams."

This indicates that these meteorites were exposed to cosmic rays for unusually short periods of time. These exposure times are one or two orders of magnitude shorter than those for the average iron meteorite, and they overlap the periods found for chondrites. It is suggested that perhaps 20 percent of the iron meteorites have similarly short exposure periods."

https://openalex.org/W1978074622,"Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the problems related to increasing slum area in developing countries. The slum and squatter area has symbolized the main urban problem in developing countries for decades. Its dilapidated shanties and inadequate services reflect the inability of urban authorities to cope with city problems. There are numerous variations of the site and services approach but the World Bank broadly divides projects into site and services lots and squatter upgrading. Intensive studies of slum and squatter communities found vigorous organizational capacity, good construction and production skills, and strong community and personal motivations that could be translated into positive developmental programs. In large projects where preparation of the site, digging of ditches for sewage and water systems, and construction of core housing units are required within specific time periods, communal efforts have been found wanting. Community resources and mutual help are extremely difficult to fit into water supply and sewerage systems that require a certain scale for effectiveness and efficiency. Efforts to find alternative water and sewerage systems using low or intermediate technology have not yielded satisfactory results."

https://openalex.org/W2089663562,The stable human habitat of the future will be urban in the sense of the maintenance of a dense viable association of plants animals humans machines and vehicles and not necessarily in the current Western concept mainly because no alternative means of supporting large numbers of people has been produced. However if cities especially those in the 3rd world are to successfully accommodate greater numbers vital resources must be conserved and overall population growth reduced. Technologies for needed conservation already exist and though all necessary innovations are not at hand have achieved enough sophistication to point the way. The significance of 3rd world innovations is demonstrated by a case study on Java chosen because it is tropical typical of the largest class of urbanizing regions open to investigation and has data of a reasonable quality. Javanese contributions include: 1) vigorous fertility control programs including family planning and socioeconomic measures e.g. raising age at marriage and encouraging females to enter the work force; 2) resource-conserving settlements that restrict automobile imports and rely on low horsepower vehicles model dwellings on traditional space conscious designs instead of oversized expensive Western types (a fully integrated water center which Java lacks would be especially beneficial in that context) and make round-the-clock use of services; 3) techniques for intensive food production in towns combined with waste recycling including traditional gardening use of the urban periphery to increase the efficiency of the recycling process and the making of raw foodstuffs into nutritious snacks and specialty dishes readily available thanks to use of plastic bags in food processing thereby saving as much as 20% of the caloric intake in a culture where rice is the staple. In initiating new growth in urban settlements distribution of and access to services creation of water economy and progressive self-organization of the social function of urbanization are of paramount importance. In the latter context intermediate level organizations are seriously lacking in Indonesia and provision of a broad range of services is thus inhibited. To arrive at a stable urban ecosystem in any country critical deficiencies must be identified and acceptable relevant steps must be taken to meet them.

The great discontinuity in temperature across the sedimnent-water interface and the lack of agreement with the normal temperature structure indicate that the layer was a transient feature. This abnormal condition may be related to the passage of a hurricane 3 days earlier."
