Constitutive expression of HIF1α and HIF2α has been linked to a number of human cancers, especially renal cell carcinoma (RCC), in which HIF2α expression is the more important contributor. Expression of HIF1α is dependent on the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and is sensitive to rapamycin. In contrast, there have been no reports linking HIF2α expression with mTOR. mTOR exists in two complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, which are differentially sensitive to rapamycin. We report here that although there are clear differences in the sensitivity of HIF1α and HIF2α to rapamycin, both HIF1α and HIF2α expression is dependent on mTOR. HIF1α expression was dependent on both Raptor (a constituent of mTORC1) and Rictor (a constitutive of mTORC2). In contrast, HIF2α was dependent only on the mTORC2 constituent Rictor. These data indicate that although HIF1α is dependent on both mTORC1 and mTORC2, HIF2α is dependent only on mTORC2. We also examined the dependence of HIFα expression on the mTORC2 substrate Akt, which exists as three different isoforms, Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3. Interestingly, the expression of HIF2α was dependent on Akt2, whereas that of HIF1α was dependent on Akt3. Because HIF2α is apparently more critical in RCC, this study underscores the importance of targeting mTORC2 and perhaps Akt2 signaling in RCC and other proliferative disorders in which HIF2α has been implicated.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 627-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 2.Shaw R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 598-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Under non-stressful conditions, HIFα is ubiquitinated by the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene product pVHL, a substrate-conferring component of a ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase that targets HIFα for degradation by the proteasome (3.Ohh M. Neoplasia (N. Y.). 2006; 8: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Loss of the VHL gene results in a variety of pathologies, most significantly renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (4.Maynard M.A. Ohh M. Am. J. Nephrol. 2004; 24: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 5.Maxwell P.H. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 16: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 6.Kaelin Jr., W.G. Clin. Cancer Res. 2007; 13: 680s-684sCrossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In the absence of pVHL, there is an up-regulation of HIFα, and elevated expression of HIFα has been strongly implicated in VHL disease and RCC (4.Maynard M.A. Ohh M. Am. J. Nephrol. 2004; 24: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 5.Maxwell P.H. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 16: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 6.Kaelin Jr., W.G. Clin. Cancer Res. 2007; 13: 680s-684sCrossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). HIFα dimerizes with HIFβ to form a transcription factor HIF that stimulates the transcription of genes that regulate angiogenesis and other factors important for responding to hypoxic and other stressful conditions such as vascular endothelial growth factor and glycolytic enzymes (2.Shaw R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 598-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 7.Semenza G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar, 8.Hickey M.M. Simon M.C. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2006; 76: 217-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). There are several distinct α-subunits, but it is the expression of HIF1α and HIF2α that is most frequently elevated in human cancers (4.Maynard M.A. Ohh M. Am. J. Nephrol. 2004; 24: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 9.Maynard M.A. Ohh M. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2007; 64: 2170-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Whereas HIF1α has both pro- and anti-proliferative properties, HIF2α lacks the anti-proliferative properties and is more strongly implicated in tumorigenesis (10.Gordan J.D. Simon M.C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2007; 17: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The somewhat overlapping and antagonistic effects of HIF1α and HIF2α are poorly understood, but it is clear that in RCC, HIF2α is a critical factor in that suppression of HIF2α blocks tumor formation by renal cancer cells (11.Kondo K. Klco J. Nakamura E. Lechpammer M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 237-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 12.Kondo K. Kim W.Y. Lechpammer M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. PLoS Biol. 2003; 1: 439-444Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It is believed that the elevated expression of HIF2α contributes to the survival signals in renal cancer cells that protect against apoptosis and facilitate angiogenesis (10.Gordan J.D. Simon M.C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2007; 17: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar).There have been several reports that HIF1α is sensitive to rapamycin (13.Land S.C. Tee A.R. J. Biol.

Med. 2006; 12: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar), indicating that HIF1α expression is dependent upon mTORC1. In contrast, HIF2α expression has not been linked to either mTORC1 or mTORC2. We recently reported that elevated expression of both HIF1α and HIF2α in VHL-deficient RCC cell lines is dependent on phospholipase D (PLD) (17.Toschi A. Edelstein J. Rockwell P. Ohh M. Foster D.A. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 2746-2753Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Like HIFα, PLD has been implicated in stress responses (18.Zheng Y. Rodrik V. Toschi A. Shi M. Hui L. Shen Y. Foster D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15862-15868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and has been shown to provide a survival signal in several human cancer cell lines (17.Toschi A. Edelstein J. Rockwell P. Ohh M. Foster D.A. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 2746-2753Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 18.Zheng Y. Rodrik V. Toschi A. Shi M. Hui L. Shen Y. Foster D.A. J. Biol.

Lee E. Garcia A. Toschi A. Foster D.A. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 2840-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Notably, the PLD metabolite phosphatidic acid has been reported to interact with the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in a manner that is competitive with rapamycin in association with FKBP12 (FK506-binding protein-12) (23.Fang Y. Vilella-Bach M. Bachmann R. Flanigan A. Chen J. Science. 2001; 294: 1942-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar, 24.Chen Y. Zheng Y. Foster D.A. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3937-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Consistent with reports that suppression of HIF2α blocks tumor formation by renal cancer cells (11.Kondo K. Klco J. Nakamura E. Lechpammer M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 237-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 12.Kondo K. Kim W.Y. Lechpammer M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. PLoS Biol. 2003; 1: 439-444Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar), suppression of PLD activity in RCC cell lines leads to apoptosis when the cells are deprived of serum (17.Toschi A. Edelstein J. Rockwell P. Ohh M. Foster D.A. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 2746-2753Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, like HIF2α, PLD is able to provide a “survival signal” that suppresses apoptosis in RCC cells.A common node for survival signals in cancer cells is mTOR (25.Sawyers C.L. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 343-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 26.Foster D.A. Expert Rev.

Cancer. 2006; 6: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). mTOR exists in two distinct complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2 (27.Guertin D.A. Sabatini D.M. Cancer Cell. 2007; 12: 9-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2390) Google Scholar, 28.Sabatini D.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar), that differ in their subunit composition and sensitivity to rapamycin. mTORC1 consists of a complex that includes mTOR and a protein known as Raptor (regulatory-associated protein of mTOR), whereas mTORC2 consists of a complex that includes mTOR and a protein known as Rictor (rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR) (27.Guertin D.A. Sabatini D.M. Cancer Cell. 2007; 12: 9-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2390) Google Scholar). Although there have been several reports linking mTOR and HIF1α expression, there has been no link made between mTOR and HIF2α expression. The link between mTOR and HIF1α is based largely on the sensitivity of HIF1α to rapamycin (13.Land S.C. Tee A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20534-20543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 14.Bernardi R. Guernah I. Jin D. Grisendi S. Alimonti A. Teruya-Feldstein J. Cordon-Cardo C.

Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). However, it was recently reported that long-term exposure to rapamycin prevents the formation of mTORC2 complexes and blocks the phosphorylation of the mTORC2 substrate Akt at Ser473 (29.Sarbassov D.D. Guertin D.A. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M. Science. 2005; 307: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (5160) Google Scholar, 30.Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. Sengupta S. Sheen J.H. Hsu P.P. Bagley A.F. Markhard A.L.

Because HIF2α expression is critical for RCC tumorigenesis, this study indicates that targeting mTORC2 signals represents a viable therapeutic strategy in RCC and perhaps other cancers in which HIF2α is critical for tumorigenesis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells, Cell Culture Conditions, and Transfection—RCC4 and 786-O cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. All cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen) for plasmid transfection and Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) for small interfering RNA (siRNA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection efficiency was determined by transfection of pEGFP-C1, which expresses green fluorescent protein. The percentage of green cells was determined microscopically and was routinely in excess of 90%.Materials—Antibodies against mTOR, Rictor, Raptor, HIF2α, and actin were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); antibodies against pan-Akt, Akt1, Akt2, Akt3, phospho-Akt (Ser473), S6 kinase (S6K), and phospho-S6K (Thr389) were obtained from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). The antibody to HIF1α was from BD Biosciences. siRNAs targeting Raptor, Rictor, mTOR, and Akt1 were obtained from Sigma. The siRNA targeting Akt2 was from Cell Signaling, and the siRNA for Akt3 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rapamycin was obtained from Calbiochem.Western Blot Analysis—Extraction of proteins from cultured cells and Western blot analysis of extracted proteins were performed using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (17.Toschi A. Edelstein J. Rockwell P. Ohh M. Foster D.A. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 2746-2753Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).siRNA—Cells were plated on 12-well plates at 30% confluence in medium containing 10% serum without antibiotics. After 1 day, cells were transfected with siRNA using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX according to the manufacturer's directions. After 24 h, the medium was changed to fresh medium containing 10% serum, and 2 days later, cells were lysed and analyzed by Western blotting.RESULTSDifferential Effect of Rapamycin on HIF1α and HIF2α—Although several laboratories have reported that the expression of HIF1α is dependent upon mTOR (13.Land S.C. Tee A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20534-20543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 14.Bernardi R. Guernah I. Jin D. Grisendi S. Alimonti A. Teruya-Feldstein J.

Giaccia A.J. Abraham R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7004-7014Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar, 16.Thomas G.V. Tran C. Mellinghoff I.K. Welsbie D.S. Chan E. Fueger B. Czernin J. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar), there have been no reports implicating mTOR in the expression of HIF2α. However, both HIF1α and HIF2α are dependent upon PLD activity in RCC cells (17.Toschi A. Edelstein J. Rockwell P. Ohh M. Foster D.A. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 2746-2753Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Because PLD activity has been widely implicated in the activation of mTOR (32.Foster D.A. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), we investigated the effect of rapamycin on the expression of HIF2α in VHL-null 786-O RCC cells, which have elevated expression of HIF2α, and in VHL-null RCC4 cells, which express both HIF1α and HIF2α. A 24-h treatment with 20 μm rapamycin partially suppressed the expression of HIF2α in both 786-O and RCC4 cells, but completely suppressed the expression of HIF1α in RCC4 cells (Fig. 1A). Phosphorylation of the mTORC1 substrate S6K was also evaluated to ensure that rapamycin was able to suppress mTORC1. We performed a shorter term kinetic analysis of the effect of rapamycin on HIF1α and HIF2α in the RCC4 cells, in which both HIF1α and HIF2α are expressed, and as shown in Fig. 1B, suppression of HIF1α could be detected by 2 h, whereas there was no detectable drop in HIF2α levels by 8 h. A rapamycin dose-response experiment for HIF2α expression in 786-O cells (Fig. 1C) and for HIF1α and HIF2α expression in RCC4 cells (Fig. 1D) was also performed. The sensitivity of HIF1α corresponded to the sensitivity of S6K phosphorylation, with an IC50 of between 20 and 200 nm, corresponding to an effect of rapamycin on mTORC1, which phosphorylates S6K. These data reveal that despite a similar dependence of HIF1α and HIF2α on PLD activity, there was a clear difference in the sensitivity of HIF1α and HIF2α to rapamycin.Sensitivity of HIF1α and HIF2α to Suppressed Expression of mTOR—The partial sensitivity of HIF2α expression upon long-term rapamycin treatment is consistent with recent reports from Sabatini and co-workers (30.Sarbassov D.D.

Blood. 2007; 109: 3509-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) indicating that mTORC2 can be suppressed by long-term rapamycin treatment by preventing the formation of a complex between mTOR, Rictor, and other components of mTORC2. To begin to determine whether the partial sensitivity of HIF2α to rapamycin is due to an mTORC2 requirement, we examined the effect of suppressing mTOR expression using siRNA for mTOR. In the 786-O cells, siRNA for mTOR strongly suppressed the expression of mTOR and, notably, also suppressed the expression of HIF2α (Fig. 2A). In the RCC4 cells, siRNA for mTOR suppressed the levels of both HIF1α and HIF2α (Fig. 2B). Depleting cells of mTOR also suppressed phosphorylation of the mTORC1 substrate S6K and phosphorylation of Akt at the mTORC2 site at Ser473 (Fig. 2, A and B) (30.Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. Sengupta S.

These data indicate that although HIF1α is more sensitive to rapamycin compared with HIF2α, both HIF1α and HIF2α are dependent upon the expression of mTOR.FIGURE 2Both HIF1α and HIF2α are sensitive to suppression of mTOR expression. A, 786-O cells were plated at 30% confluence. 24 h later, the cells were transfected with mTOR siRNA or a scrambled siRNA as indicated. 24 h later, the cells were treated with fresh medium containing 10% serum for an additional 48 h. The control cells were treated with transfection medium, but without the transfection. The cells were then harvested and analyzed for levels of HIF2α, mTOR, Akt phosphorylated at Ser473 (P-Akt S473), Akt, phosphorylated S6K (P-S6K), and S6K by Western blotting as described in the legend to Fig. 1. B, RCC4 cells were prepared and transfected with mTOR siRNA as described for A. The cells were evaluated by Western blot analysis as described for A except that HIF1α levels were also evaluated. All data shown are representative of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Dependence of HIF1α and HIF2α Expression on Raptor and Rictor—The data showing a differential sensitivity of HIF1α and HIF2α to rapamycin but equal sensitivity to mTOR depletion could be explained if HIF2α were dependent upon mTORC2, which is relatively resistant to rapamycin, and HIF1α were dependent upon mTORC1. To test this hypothesis, the 786-O and RCC4 cells were depleted of Raptor, which is a component of mTORC1, and Rictor, which is a component of mTORC2. As shown in Fig. 3A, HIF2α expression in 786-O cells was sensitive to the depletion of Rictor, but not Raptor. These data are consistent with a dependence of HIF2α expression on mTORC2, but not mTORC1. We also examined the effect of depleting the expression of Raptor and Rictor on HIF1α and HIF2α in RCC4 cells, and as shown in Fig. 3B, suppression of Rictor, but not Raptor, suppressed the expression of HIF2α, as was observed in the 786-O cells. The expression of HIF1α was dependent upon both Raptor and Rictor (Fig. 3B). Consistent with the roles of Raptor and Rictor in regulating mTORC1 and mTORC2, respectively, suppression of Raptor reduced S6K phosphorylation at the mTORC1 site at Thr389, and suppression of Rictor reduced Akt phosphorylation at the mTORC2 site at Ser473. These data indicate that the expression of HIF1α is dependent upon both mTORC1 and mTORC2, whereas the expression of HIF2α is dependent only upon mTORC2. Thus, the differential sensitivity of HIF1α and HIF2α to rapamycin is due to a differential dependence on mTORC1 and mTORC2.FIGURE 3Dependence of HIF1α and HIF2α expression on Raptor and Rictor. A, 786-O cells were plated as described in the legend to Fig. 2. 24 h later, the cells were transfected with Raptor or Rictor siRNA or a scrambled siRNA as indicated. 24 h later, the cells were treated with fresh medium containing 10% serum for an additional 48 h.

Cell. 2006; 22: 159-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2153) Google Scholar). Consistent with the previous reports, suppression of Rictor, but not Raptor, suppressed Akt phosphorylation at Ser473 (Fig. 3). We therefore examined whether the expression of either HIF1α or HIF2α is dependent on Akt expression. There are three Akt isoforms, Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3. Akt1-deficient mice have developmental defects, Akt2-deficient mice have defects in glucose homeostasis, and Akt3-deficient mice have defects in brain development (33.Manning B.D. Cantley L.C. Cell. 2007; 129: 1261-1274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4620) Google Scholar). The 786-O cells were treated with siRNAs for the Akt isoforms, and the levels of HIF2α were evaluated by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 4A, depleting cells of Akt2, but not Akt1, abolished HIF2α expression. There was no detectable expression of Akt3 in the 786-O cells (Fig. 4A, lower panel). We also examined the effect of depleting cells of the Akt isoforms in the RCC4 cells, which express both HIF1α and HIF2α. In contract with the 786-O cells, the RCC4 cells expressed all three Akt isoforms. As shown in Fig. 4B, depleting cells of Akt2, but not Akt1 or Akt3, suppressed the expression of HIF2α, as was observed in the 786-O cells. Suppression of either Akt1 or Akt2 had no effect on HIF1α expression; however, suppression of Akt3 completely abolished HIF1α in the RCC4 cells (Fig. 4B, lower panel). These data indicate that Akt2 is a critical downstream target of mTORC2 for HIF2α expression and that Akt3 is a critical downstream target of mTORC2 for HIF1α expression.FIGURE 4Dependence of HIFα expression on Akt. 786-O (A) and RCC4 (B) cells were plated as described in the legend to Fig. 2. 24 h later, the cells were transfected with Akt1, Akt2, or Akt3 siRNA or a scrambled siRNA as indicated. 24 h later, the cells were treated with fresh medium containing 10% serum for an additional 48 h. The cells were then harvested and analyzed for levels of HIF1α, HIF2α, Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3 by Western blotting as described in the legend Fig. 2. The data shown are representative of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONWe previously reported that the expression of both HIF1α and HIF2α is dependent on PLD activity (17.Toschi A. Edelstein J. Rockwell P. Ohh M. Foster D.A. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 2746-2753Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The PLD metabolite phosphatidic acid has been implicated in the activation of mTOR (26.Foster D.A. Expert Rev. Anticancer Ther. 2004; 4: 691-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 32.Foster D.A. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, there is a clear differential sensitivity of HIF1α and HIF2α to rapamycin. In this work, we have demonstrated that although there is a differential sensitivity of HIF1α and HIF2α to rapamycin, both HIF1α and HIF2α are dependent upon mTOR. This observation is explained by a dependence of HIF2α expression on the rapamycin-resistant mTORC2, whereas there is a dependence of HIF1α expression on both mTORC1 and mTORC2. This study reveals an mTORC2 requirement for the expression of HIF2α.Akt2, which is a downstream target of mTORC2, is also required for the expression of HIF2α. Of interest here is that Akt2 has been implicated in the regulation of glycolysis (33.Manning B.D. Cantley L.C. Cell. 2007; 129: 1261-1274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4620) Google Scholar), as has HIF2α (10.Gordan J.D. Simon M.C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2007; 17: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). HIF1α, which is also dependent on mTORC2, is dependent on Akt3, which has been implicated in melanoma and ovarian cancer (34.Davies M.A. Stemke-Hale K. Tellez C. Calderone T.L. Deng W. Prieto V.G.

At this point, it is difficult to determine the link between Akt and HIFα expression in that the regulation is very complicated (33.Manning B.D. Cantley L.C. Cell. 2007; 129: 1261-1274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4620) Google Scholar). The impact of phosphorylating Akt at Ser473 by mTORC2 is not clear. Although this phosphorylation leads to increased kinase activity (36.Alessi D.R. Andjekovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P.

Adipocytes and other cells secrete a protein called extracellular nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (eNampt; also known as pre-B cell colony enhancing factor or visfatin), and plasma levels of eNampt increase in obesity. Herein we tested the hypothesis that eNampt could promote cell survival in macrophages subjected to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, a process associated with obesity and obesity-associated diseases. We show that eNampt potently blocks macrophage apoptosis induced by a number of ER stressors. The mechanism involves a two-step sequential process: rapid induction of interleukin 6 (IL-6) secretion, followed by IL-6-mediated autocrine/paracrine activation of the prosurvival signal transducer STAT3. The ability of eNampt to trigger this IL-6/STAT3 cell survival pathway did not depend on the presence of the Nampt enzymatic substrate nicotinamide in the medium, could not be mimicked by the Nampt enzymatic product nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), was not blocked by the Nampt enzyme inhibitor FK866, and showed no correlation with enzyme activity in a series of site-directed mutant Nampt proteins. Thus, eNampt protects macrophages from ER stress-induced apoptosis by activating an IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway via a nonenzymatic mechanism. These data suggest a novel action and mechanism of eNampt that could affect the balance of macrophage survival and death in the setting of obesity, which in turn could play important roles in obesity-associated diseases.

These data suggest a novel action and mechanism of eNampt that could affect the balance of macrophage survival and death in the setting of obesity, which in turn could play important roles in obesity-associated diseases. Macrophage biology is intimately related to obesity-associated pathology. For example, inflammatory macrophages are numerous in adipose tissue of obese individuals (1.Weisberg S.P. McCann D. Desai M. Rosenbaum M. Leibel R.L. Ferrante Jr., A.W. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1796-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (7456) Google Scholar, 2.Xu H. Barnes G.T. Yang Q. Tan G. Yang D. Chou C.J. Sole J. Nichols A.

J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 1111-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (3190) Google Scholar). Macrophages also play a critical role in the progression of atherosclerosis, which is the process behind the leading cause of death in obese and insulin-resistant subjects, atherothrombotic vascular disease (4.Wilson P.W. D'Agostino R.B. Parise H. Sullivan L. Meigs J.B. Circulation. 2005; 112: 3066-3072Crossref PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar). Obesity is associated with an increased risk for certain cancers, and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) 3The abbreviations used are: TAM, tumor-associated macrophage; CHOP, C/EBP-homologous protein; CM, conditioned medium; eNampt, extracellular Nampt; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; IL, interleukin; LDL, low density lipoprotein; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; PBEF, pre-B cell colony-enhancing factor; PRR, pattern recognition receptor; UPR, unfolded protein response; siRNA, small interfering RNA; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling.3The abbreviations used are: TAM, tumor-associated macrophage; CHOP, C/EBP-homologous protein; CM, conditioned medium; eNampt, extracellular Nampt; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; IL, interleukin; LDL, low density lipoprotein; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; PBEF, pre-B cell colony-enhancing factor; PRR, pattern recognition receptor; UPR, unfolded protein response; siRNA, small interfering RNA; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling. play a critical role in the development of these tumors (5.Irigaray P.

In all processes involving macrophages, a critical determinant of outcome is the survival-death balance of the cells. For example, macrophage apoptosis, when coupled with effective phagocytic clearance (efferocytosis) of the dead cells, suppresses inflammation (8.Vandivier R.W. Henson P.M. Douglas I.S. Chest. 2006; 129: 1673-1682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). In atherosclerosis, macrophage apoptosis limits plaque progression in relatively early lesions, where efferocytosis is intact (9.Liu J. Thewke D.P. Su Y.R. Linton M.F. Fazio S. Sinensky M.S.

Res. 2007; 73: 470-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In cancer, targeted apoptosis of TAMs suppresses tumor development (7.Miselis N.R. Wu Z.J. Van R.N. Kane A.B. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2008; 7: 788-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus, increased macrophage survival in obesity, perhaps mediated by circulating bioactive proteins whose levels change with increased body mass index (“adipocytokines”) (13.Matarese G. Mantzoros C. La C.A. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2007; 13: 3676-3680Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 14.Tilg H. Moschen A.R. Clin. Sci. (Lond.). 2008; 114: 275-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), may promote the aforementioned obesity-associated diseases. An adipocytokine that has received much recent attention is a secreted form of an enzyme called nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt; also known as pre-B cell colony enhancing factor (PBEF) or visfatin), which converts nicotinamide to nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) (15.Luk T. Malam Z. Marshall J.C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2008; 83: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 16.Revollo J.R. Grimm A.A. Imai S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50754-50763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, intracellular Nampt plays an essential role in the biosynthesis of NAD from nicotinamide (17.Revollo J.R. Grimm A.A. Imai S. Curr. Opin. Gastroenterol. 2007; 23: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). However, adipocytes and other cells secrete Nampt through a nonclassical, brefeldin A-independent pathway into the extracellular medium in vitro and into the circulation in vivo (18.Samal B. Sun Y. Stearns G. Xie C. Suggs S. McNiece I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1431-1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Jia S.H. Li Y. Parodo J. Kapus A. Fan L. Rotstein O.D. Marshall J.C. J. Clin.

Recent studies have shown that plasma levels of circulating Nampt/PBEF/visfatin, referred to here as extracellular Nampt (eNampt), are elevated in obese humans, including those with type 2 diabetes (21.Berndt J. Kloting N. Kralisch S. Kovacs P. Fasshauer M. Schon M.R. Stumvoll M. Bluher M. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 2911-2916Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 22.Haider D.G. Holzer G. Schaller G.

Metab. 2006; 91: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). eNampt has been implicated in a number of biological processes. For example, eNampt was initially identified as a cytokine, called PBEF, that can promote the maturation of B cell precursors and inhibit neutrophil apoptosis (19.Jia S.H. Li Y. Parodo J. Kapus A. Fan L. Rotstein O.D. Marshall J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 1318-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Later work revealed proinflammatory actions of the protein in vitro and in mice, as well as a positive association among obesity, eNampt plasma levels, and inflammation in humans (14.Tilg H. Moschen A.R. Clin. Sci. (Lond.). 2008; 114: 275-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 25.Moschen A.R. Kaser A. Enrich B. Mosheimer B. Theurl M. Niederegger H. Tilg H. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 1748-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). The issue as to whether these cytokine-like effects of eNampt depend on Nampt enzymatic activity has generally not been investigated, although a recent study has implicated Nampt enzymatic activity in enhancing the inflammatory response of macrophages to LPS (26.Busso N. Karababa M. Nobile M. Rolaz A. Van G.F. Galli M. Leo O. So A. De S.T. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In another set of studies in which eNampt was named “visfatin,” a group of investigators reported that the protein could activate insulin receptor signaling in cultured cells and in vivo through direct interaction with the insulin receptor (27.Fukuhara A. Matsuda M. Nishizawa M. Segawa K. Tanaka M. Kishimoto K. Matsuki Y. Murakami M. Ichisaka T. Murakami H. Watanabe E. Takagi T. Akiyoshi M. Ohtsubo T. Kihara S. Yamashita S. Makishima M. Funahashi T. Yamanaka S. Hiramatsu R. Matsuzawa Y. Shimomura I. Science. 2005; 307: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar). However, the authors have recently retracted the publication due to problems reproducing these results (28.Fukuhara A. Matsuda M. Nishizawa M. Segawa K. Tanaka M. Kishimoto K. Matsuki Y. Murakami M. Ichisaka T. Murakami H. Watanabe E. Takagi T. Akiyoshi M. Ohtsubo T. Kihara S. Yamashita S. Makishima M. Funahashi T. Yamanaka S. Hiramatsu R. Matsuzawa Y. Shimomura I. Science. 2007; 318: 565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, Revollo et al. (20.Revollo J.R. Korner A. Mills K.F. Satoh A. Wang T. Garten A. Dasgupta B. Sasaki Y. Wolberger C. Townsend R.R. Milbrandt J. Kiess W. Imai S. Cell Metab. 2007; 6: 363-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar) showed that eNampt enhances glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in pancreatic β cells in vitro and in nonobese mice. This effect of the protein was shown not to be mediated through activation of insulin receptor signaling but rather involved the extracellular enzymatic conversion of nicotinamide to NMN by eNampt, leading to increased NAD biosynthesis in β cells (20.Revollo J.R. Korner A. Mills K.F. Satoh A. Wang T. Garten A. Dasgupta B. Sasaki Y. Wolberger C. Townsend R.R. Milbrandt J. Kiess W. Imai S. Cell Metab. 2007; 6: 363-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Given that eNampt levels are increased in obesity and that macrophages play important roles in obesity-associated diseases, we questioned at a cell biological level whether eNampt might influence the survival-death balance of macrophages. In particular, increased macrophage survival might enhance the proposed inflammatory effects of eNampt (see above). We focused on an apoptosis inducer, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, that occurs in obesity and is likely to be relevant to obesity-associated diseases. For example, ER stress is a critical process in obesity-associated insulin resistance and inflammation (29.Ozcan U. Cao Q. Yilmaz E. Lee A.H. Iwakoshi N.N. Ozdelen E. Tuncman G. Gorgun C.

Circulation. 2007; 116: 1226-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), particularly in the setting of insulin resistance (36.Han S. Liang C.P. DeVries-Seimon T. Ranalletta M. Welch C.L. Collins-Fletcher K. Accili D. Tabas I. Tall A.R. Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 257-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). ER stress is also prominent in tumors, where it may affect TAMs (37.Lee A.S. Hendershot L.M. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2006; 5: 721-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Using models of ER stress-induced apoptosis, we show here that eNampt potently blocks macrophage apoptosis. The cell survival pathway is mediated by STAT3, which is activated in an autocrine/paracrine manner by eNampt-induced IL-6. The ability of eNampt to activate STAT3 involves neither insulin receptor signaling nor the nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase activity of the protein, suggesting a nonenzymatic signaling role for the protein in this pathway. These findings have potential implications for how obesity might affect macrophage apoptosis-survival balance, with potential implications for macrophage-mediated obesity-associated diseases as well as for the mechanisms of action of eNampt.

Preparation of Mouse Peritoneal Macrophages and Bone Marrow-derived Macrophages—Unless otherwise noted, the mice used in this study were female C57BL6/J mice, 8–10 weeks of age. Peritoneal macrophages were elicited by intraperitoneal injection of methyl-bovine serum albumin in mice previously immunized with this antigen as previously described (40.Cook A.D. Braine E.L.

Mouse bone marrow cells were collected by flushing femurs with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The suspension was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min, and the cell pellet was resuspended in macrophage medium (above) and cultured for 9–11 days to allow differentiation into mature macrophages.

For simultaneous UPR/PRR activation, macrophages were incubated for 20 h with 50 μg/ml acetyl-LDL plus 10 μg/ml acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase inhibitor, SA 58-035. For separate UPR/PRR activation, macrophages were incubated for 24 h with 5 μg/ml tunicamycin plus 25 μg/ml fucoidan. At the end of the incubation period, macrophages were assayed for externalization of phosphatidylserine, a marker of early to mid-stage apoptosis, by staining with Alexa-488-labeled annexin V. Late stage apoptosis, as indicated by increased membrane permeability, was assayed by staining with propidium iodide (43.Yao P.M. Tabas I. J. Biol.

For Figs. 3 and 4F, the annexin data were verified by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) analysis, using the in situ cell death detection kit, TMR red, from Roche Applied Science. Cells were viewed immediately with an Olympus IX-70 inverted fluorescence microscope, and four representative fields (∼1,000 cells) for each condition were counted. The data are expressed as the percentage of apoptotic cells per total cells.FIGURE 3eNampt-induced survival of ER-stressed macrophages requires STAT3.

Right blot, for these experiments, CM from control or eNampt-treated macrophages was transferred to fresh macrophages. The cells were then incubated in this medium for the indicated periods of time, after which cell lysates were immunoblotted for tyrosine-phosphorylated and total STAT3. B, macrophages were incubated in the absence or presence of 100 ng/ml eNampt for 5 h. The cells were washed and then incubated in fresh medium for 12 h. This “chase” conditioned medium (CM) was then transferred onto fresh macrophages. After 30 min of incubation, cell lysates were immunoblotted for tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 (pY-STAT3) and β-actin. C, macrophages were incubated in the absence or presence of 100 ng/ml eNampt for the indicated times. The culture media were collected and cleared of cell debris by centrifugation, and concentrations of IL-6 and IL-10 were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. D, eNampt-conditioned media were prepared as in A and then transferred to recipient macrophages that had been pretreated for 30 min with 1 μg/ml anti-IL-10 receptor IgG, anti-IL-6 receptor IgG, or nonimmune IgG control. The recipient cells were incubated for 30 min with the conditioned medium plus the respective IgGs. Cells were lysed, and the extracts were immunoblotted for tyrosine-phosphorylated and total STAT3. E, eNampt or control “chase” CM were prepared as in B. The CM was incubated with or without 1 μg/ml anti-IL-6 antibody for 30 min. The media were then added to recipient macrophages and incubated for 30 min. 100 pg/ml recombinant IL-6 and IL-6 plus anti-IL-6 antibody were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Cells were lysed, and the extracts were immunoblotted for tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 and β-actin. F, in both experiments shown, cholesterol-induced apoptosis was assayed in control or eNampt-pretreated macrophages exactly as in Fig. 1A, except some of the cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml anti-IL-6 antibody, anti-IL-10 antibody, or both throughout both the 24-h eNampt pretreatment period and the 20-h cholesterol-loading period. In experiment 1, p < 0.01 for cholesterol versus control and for the eNampt groups treated with anti-IL-6 or anti-IL-6 + anti-IL-10 antibody versus no antibody or anti-IL-10 alone. In Experiment 1, p < 0.01 for cholesterol versus control and for the eNampt groups treated with anti-IL-6 versus control IgG.

The lysates were electrophoresed on 4–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to 0.22-μm nitrocellulose membranes. The membrane was blocked for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) containing 5% (w/v) nonfat milk and then incubated for 18 h with the primary antibody in TBST containing 5% (w/v) nonfat milk or 5% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C. The blots were then incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase, and proteins were detected by ECL chemiluminescence (Pierce). Stat3 siRNA Experiments—Scrambled and Stat3 siRNA (50 pg/well) were transfected into 50% confluent monolayers of peritoneal macrophages using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 4 h of transfection, the media were replaced, and 60 h later the indicated experiments were conducted. In Vivo Administration of eNampt—Male C57BL/6J mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1 ml of 3% thioglycollate to elicit peritoneal macrophages. Four days later, the mice were injected intravenously with 5 μg of eNampt in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline or with phosphate-buffered saline alone as control. Peritoneal macrophages were harvested 12 h after the eNampt injection and then immediately assayed for phospho-STAT3 by immunoblotting.

Depending on different catalytic abilities, different amounts of His-Nampt were used for the wild type and the mutants. Catalytic constants Km and kcat were determined for His-tagged mutant and wild-type proteins by analyzing plots of initial rate measurements at 25 °C under varying nicotinamide concentrations using the KaleidaGraph version 3.6 program (Synergy Software), which calculates constants Km and kcat automatically.

https://openalex.org/W2081805772,"The onset of vision occurs when neural circuits in the visual cortex are immature, lacking both the full complement of connections and the response selectivity that defines functional maturity. Direction-selective responses are particularly vulnerable to the effects of early visual deprivation, but it remains unclear how stimulus-driven neural activity guides the emergence of cortical direction selectivity. Here we report observations from a motion training protocol that allowed us to monitor the impact of experience on the development of direction-selective responses in visually naive ferrets. Using intrinsic signal imaging techniques, we found that training with a single axis of motion induced the rapid emergence of direction columns that were confined to cortical regions preferentially activated by the training stimulus. Using two-photon calcium imaging techniques, we found that single neurons in visually naive animals exhibited weak directional biases and lacked the strong local coherence in the spatial organization of direction preference that was evident in mature animals. Training with a moving stimulus, but not with a flashed stimulus, strengthened the direction-selective responses of individual neurons and preferentially reversed the direction biases of neurons that deviated from their neighbours. Both effects contributed to an increase in local coherence. We conclude that early experience with moving visual stimuli drives the rapid emergence of direction-selective responses in the visual cortex."

In particular, O-fucose glycans are reported to regulate the functions of EGF domain-containing proteins such as Notch receptors. In the course of mass spectrometric analysis of O-glycans displayed on Drosophila Notch receptors expressed in S2 cells, we found an unusual O-linked N-acetylhexosamine (HexNAc) modification which occurs at a site distinct from those of O-fucose and O-glucose glycosylations. Modification site mapping by mass spectrometry and amino acid substitution studies revealed that O-HexNAc modification occurs on a serine or threonine located between the fifth and sixth cysteines within the EGF domain. This modification occurs simultaneously along with other closely positioned O-glycosylations. This modification was determined to be O-β-GlcNAc by galactosyltransferase labeling and β-N-acetyl-hexosaminidase digestion experiments and by immunoblotting with a specific antibody. O-GlcNAc modification occurs at multiple sites on Notch epidermal growth factor repeats. O-GlcNAc modification was also found on the extracellular domain of Delta, a ligand for Notch receptors. Although the O-GlcNAc modification is known to regulate a wide range of cellular processes, the list of known modified proteins has previously been limited to intracellular proteins in animals.

Protein glycosylation is a common co- and post-translational modification that has critical biological functions at both the cellular and organismal levels. In addition to the generally observed types of glycosylation such as N-glycosylation and mucin-type O-glycosylation, several unusual glycans have recently been found to play important roles in specific biological processes. Such unusual glycosylations are often observed as specific modifications on certain protein domains.

In the course of mass spectrometric analysis to confirm the expression of the assumed O-glycans displayed on Notch EGF repeats, we unexpectedly discovered a novel O-β-GlcNAc modification that modifies a Ser/Thr residue located between the fifth and sixth cysteines within the EGF domain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of extracellularly O-GlcNAcylated proteins in animals. Materials—pMT-Bip/EGF20-V5His, pMT-Bip/EGF20ΔFuc-V5His, pMT-WB/N:AP, pMT-WB/N:AP-EGF1–10, and pMT-WB/Fc:AP were obtained from Ken Irvine (Rutgers University). A plasmid containing rumi cDNA was obtained from Hugo Bellen (Baylor College of Medicine). The expression vector encoding the intracellular domain of Notch (pMT-Nic) was obtained from Drosophila Genomics Resource Center. pRmHa3/N-CD2 was obtained from Stephen Cohen (European Molecular Biology Laboratory). The following antibodies were used: mouse anti-Notch intracellular domain (C17.9C6; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (DSHB)), mouse anti-Notch extracellular domain (C458.2H; DSHB), mouse anti-V5 (Invitrogen), goat anti-placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP; Santa Cruz), mouse anti-α-tubulin (DM1A; Sigma), mouse anti-FLAG (M2; Sigma), mouse RL2 (Abcam), and mouse anti-O-β-GlcNAc (CTD110.6; Abcam). Plasmid Construction—In vitro mutagenesis was performed according to the protocol of the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit using pMT-Bip/EGF20-V5His as a template. The details of the mutated constructs are illustrated in supplemental Fig. S1, and the complementary primer sets utilized for mutagenesis are shown in supplemental Fig. S2. Double and triple mutants were generated by repeating the mutagenesis process. The coding sequence of each construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. pMT-WB/N:AP-EGF6–10 was constructed using the BspEI-EGF6-Fw and BspEI-EGF10-Rv primers, and pMT-WB/N:AP-EGF22–32 was constructed using BspEI-EGF22-Fw and BspEI-EGF32-Rv primers, as described previously (20Xu A.

For constructing pRmHA/ECN:FLAG, fragments encoding a transmembrane domain for PDGFR and 3×FLAG epitopes were amplified by PCR using BspEI-myc-Fw primer (5′-TCCGGAGAACAAAAACTCATCTCA-3′), PstI-3×FLAG-TM-Rv primer (5′-CTGCAGCTACTTGTCGTCATCGTCTTTGTAGTCGATGTCATGATCTTTATAATCACCGTCATGGTCTTTGTAGTCACGTGGCTTCTTCTGCCA-3′), and pDisplay (Invitrogen) as a template.

To prepare unglycosylated EGF20-V5His, the EGF20-V5His fragment was inserted into the XhoI/NotI sites of pKLAC1, and a Kluyveromyces lactis protein expression kit (New England Biolabs) was used for the production of recombinant proteins. Transfection—S2 cells were cultured in Sf-900 II medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5! fetal bovine serum. Transient transfection was performed using Cellfectin (Invitrogen) as described previously (10Okajima T. Irvine K.D.

To establish stable cell lines for EGF20, the pMT-Bip-EGF20-V5His vector was transfected together with pMK33/hygromycin in a 10:1 molar ratio. Stably transformed polyclonal cell populations were isolated after 4 weeks of selection with 300 μg/ml hygromycin B. Protein expression was under the control of an inducible metallothionein promoter and was induced in Sf-900 II supplemented with 0.7 mm CuSO4. RNA-mediated Interference in S2 Cells—S2 cell RNA-mediated interference was performed as described previously (10Okajima T. Irvine K.D.

For the production of double-stranded RNA, transcription templates were generated by PCR such that they contained T7 promoters on each end of the template. The primer sets used for PCR are described in supplemental Fig. S2. Purification of EGF Domains—Notch EGF domains secreted in the culture media were affinity-purified under native conditions using nickel-magnetic beads (Promega) or anti-Hi-tag beads (Medical & Biological Laboratories). Ni-magnetic beads were washed twice with 100 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm imidazole and twice with 30! ethanol, and then the bound proteins were eluted with 100 μl of 0.1! trifluoroacetic acid. For purification with anti-His-tag beads, bound proteins were eluted with 0.1 m NH3 following the manufacturers instruction. The eluates were dried in a SpeedVac concentrator. Reduction, S-Carbamidomethylation, and Trypsin Digestion—For trypsin digestion, nickel affinity-isolated EGF20 was further purified by reverse-phase HPLC with a Cadenza CD-C18 column (2 × 150 mm, Imtakt) at room temperature at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. A linear gradient formed between solvent A (H2O, 0.1! trifluoroacetic acid) and solvent B (CH3CN, 0.1! trifluoroacetic acid) was used for the separation. The gradient of solvent B was as follows: 0–2 min, 25!; 2–20 min, 25–45!; 20–25 min, 45–90!; 25–28 min, 90!. Peptide separation was monitored continuously at 220 nm. HPLC-purified Notch EGF20 was neutralized by the addition of 1 m NH4HCO3 to achieve a final pH of 7.0 and concentrated to a final volume of 10 μl in a SpeedVac concentrator. For reduction and S-carbamidomethylation, 15 μl of 50 mm NH4HCO3 and 1.5 μl of 100 mm dithiothreitol were added to the solution. After incubation for 5 min at 95 °C, 3 μl of 100 mm iodoacetamide was added, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min in the dark. Trypsin digestion was carried out overnight at 37 °C by the addition of 1 μl of 0.1 mg/ml trypsin solution (Trypsin Gold; Sigma). Additional trypsin solution was added after 2 h. Separation of the tryptic digest was performed by reverse-phase HPLC with the following gradient of solvent B: 0–2 min, 15!; 2–30 min, 15–40!; 30–35 min, 40–90!; 35–38 min, 90!. Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and MS/MS Analysis—MALDI-TOF-MS was performed using 4700 Proteomic Analyzer with TOF/TOF optics (Applied Biosystems) or Perseptive Voyager-DE Elite and Voyager DE-Pro spectrometers (Applied Biosystems). For the analysis of intact proteins with the 4700 Promeomic Analyzer, spectra were obtained in the linear positive ion mode using sinapinic acid as a MALDI matrix. Samples were resuspended in 1 μl of 0.1! trifluoroacetic acid and spotted on the sample plate; 1 μl of sinapinic acid (Sigma) in 0.05! trifluoroacetic acid was subsequently spotted on the sample plate and air-dried. MS spectra were recorded as the average of 3000 laser shots with the laser intensity within the range 4700–5000. External calibration was performed using bovine insulin and ubiquitin (Sigma) and human parathyroid hormone (Peptide Institute). The mass range was set at 7500–8500 m/z, with the focus mass at 8500 m/z. For the analysis of intact proteins with the Perseptive Voyager-DE Elite, spectra were obtained in the linear positive ion mode with delayed extraction and an acceleration voltage of 20 kV. The sample preparation and external calibration were performed as described above. For the analysis of small peptides, spectra were obtained in the positive reflector mode using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as a MALDI matrix. HPLC-purified peptides were concentrated in a SpeedVac concentrator and spotted on the sample plate. Subsequently, 1 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 0.05! trifluoroacetic acid, 50! CH3CN was spotted and air-dried. Each MS spectrum comprised an average of 4800 laser shots with a laser intensity of 4400. External calibration was performed using a 4700 Proteomics Analyzer Calibration Mixture (Applied Biosystems). Tandem MS (MS/MS) spectra were recorded using the 1-kV MS-MS positive mode with an average of 6000 laser shots and collision-induced dissociation off. Glycosyltransferase Assay—Nickel-magnetic beads loaded with acceptor substrates were equilibrated with glycosylation buffer (200 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). For the β4GalT-1 assay, the beads were incubated in glycosylation buffer containing 1 mm UDP-Gal and 0.4 units/ml bovine β4GalT-1 (Sigma). After incubation overnight at 30 °C, the reaction was terminated by washing the beads 3 times with 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm imidazole. A GlcNAc transferase assay was performed in the glycosylation buffer containing 1.6 μm UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (60 Ci mmol–1; American Radiolabeled Chemicals), 2 μg of EGF20-V5His produced in K. lactis, and 0.2 μg of membrane fraction proteins isolated from S2 cells as described previously (21Okajima T. Nakamura Y. Uchikawa M. Haslam D.B. Numata S.I. Furukawa K. Urano T. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40498-40503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). After incubation overnight at 25 °C, the beads were washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Glycosidase Treatment—Glycosidase digestion of glycopeptides was performed in 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 4.5, containing 2 units/ml bovine β-N-acetylhexosaminidase (Sigma). After 1 h at 37 °C, the reaction solution was desalted with a C18 microcolumn (Zip Tip; Millipore) and subjected to MALDI-TOF-MS analysis. Glycosidase digestion for N-EGF:AP was performed for 3 h at 37 °C under denaturing conditions according to the protocol of the Enzymatic Protein Deglycosylation kit (Sigma) using recombinant β-N-acetylhexosaminidase (0.1 units/μl; New England Biolabs) or α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (0.4 units/μl; New England Biolabs). Lectin Blotting and Western Blotting—After electroblotting to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and blocking with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1! Triton X-100 (TBST: 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1! Tween 20), the membrane was incubated with TBST containing 5 μg/ml Erythrina crista galli lectin (ECL; Vector Laboratories) for 1 h. After washing 3 times with TBST, the blot was incubated with Vectastain ABC reagent (Vector) for 30 min. After washing 3 times with PBS, the bound lectin was visualized in PBS containing 0.05! 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Sigma), 0.03! H2O2, and 2 mm NiCl2. Western blotting with anti-O-GlcNAc antibody was performed as described previously (22Whelan S.A. Hart G.W. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 415: 113-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting with antibodies other than the anti-O-GlcNAc antibody, the membrane was incubated with blocking buffer (NETG solution: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.05! Triton X-100 containing 0.25! gelatin) and then with the primary antibodies followed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted in the blocking buffer. For immunoblotting with an anti-O-GlcNAc antibody, 4! bovine serum albumin in TBST (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05! Tween 20) was used as the blocking buffer. The bound antibody was visualized using a chemiluminescent substrate (ECL or ECL plus; GE Healthcare). The image was captured by using a densitometer (ATTO Cool Saver) or by exposing to x-ray films. Immunoprecipitation and Glycopeptidase F Treatment—For the immunoprecipitation of PLAP-fused proteins, the spent culture media was incubated with anti-PLAP antibody-conjugated agarose (Sigma). After washing with PBS, the bound proteins were eluted by boiling in 0.5! SDS supplemented with 90 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. For peptide glycopeptidase F treatment, the denatured proteins were incubated at 37 °C for 20 h in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, 0.1! SDS, and 1! Nonidet P-40 containing 40 milliunits/ml glycopeptidase F (Takara). For the immunoprecipitation of endogenous Notch receptors, Kc cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer containing 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5! Nonidet P-40, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). After centrifugation, the cleared supernatant was immunoprecipitated at 4 °C for 2 h using Dynabeads Protein G (Invitrogen), which were preincubated with 2 μg of anti-Notch antibodies. Trypsin Treatment—Kc cells were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution and incubated with 0.05! trypsin, 0.53 mm EDTA solution (Invitrogen) for 3 min. After rinsing with Sf-900 II containing 0.1! sodium azide, the cells were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.1! sodium azide and lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer as described above. EDTA Treatment—Kc cells were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution and incubated in PBS containing 0.5 mm EDTA for 30 min at room temperature. After sequential centrifugation at 400 × g and 20,000 × g, the conditioned media were supplemented with CaCl2 to a final concentration of 2 mm and subjected to the immunoprecipitation analysis. Identification of a Novel O-HexNAc Modification on Notch EGF20—To perform the mass spectrometric analysis of glycans displayed on the EGF repeats of Notch receptors, the 20th EGF domain (Notch EGF20) was selected based on the observation that its amino acid sequence conforms to the consensus sequences of both O-fucose and O-glucose modifications (Fig. 1A). Notch EGF20 was transiently expressed in S2 cells, purified from the culture media using nickel-affinity beads, and subjected to MALDI-TOF-MS analysis (Fig. 1B). Six major peaks were observed. Peak 1 at m/z 8438 corresponds to the unglycosylated EGF20 peptide with three disulfide bonds. The mass increment by 146 from peak 1 to peak 2 (m/z 8584; +146) indicated the presence of deoxyhexose. This peak was interpreted as that corresponding to the peptide with O-fucose based on the observation that RNA-mediated interference for Ofut1 significantly decreased the intensity of the peak (supplemental Fig. S3). The mass increments from peak 2 to peak 3 (m/z 8788; +204), peak 3 to peak 5 (m/z 8950; 162), and peak 5 to peak 6 (m/z 9082; +132) indicated the presence of HexNAc, hexose, and pentose, respectively. The presence of HexNAc could be interpreted as a GlcNAc modification on O-fucose. To test this possibility, a stable cell line for EGF20 was established to obtain large amounts of recombinant proteins. Notch EGF20 in the media was purified from the culture media using Ni-affinity beads followed by reverse phase HPLC. After reduction and S-carbamidomethylation, EGF20 was enzymatically digested with trypsin. The tryptic digest was analyzed by mass spectrometry (Fig. 1C). MS/MS analysis of ions at m/z 3125.4 and 3419.5 revealed that both ions were derived from the same tryptic peptide EGF20(1–25). The theoretical mass of the peptide is 2979.2. Thus, the ion at m/z 3125.4 (+146.2) corresponds to the peptide with O-fucose. The ion at m/z 3419.5 (+440.3) can be interpreted as the O-fucosylated peptide further modified with hexose and pentose (+294.1). In the MS/MS spectrum glycosylated fragment ions with additional mass corresponding to hexose and pentose were observed (not shown). As expected, those glycosylated fragment ions always include an O-glucosylation site but not an O-fucosylation site. Thus, the ion at m/z 3419.5 was interpreted to be glycans containing both O-fucose monosaccharides and O-glucose disaccharides based on the proposed O-glycan structure in mammals. Because the O-fucose glycans appeared to be terminated with monosaccharides, all the other peaks were subjected to MS/MS analysis; however, none were identified as peptides with HexNAc modification, with the exception of the m/z 2065.1 ions, which generated complicated MS/MS spectra due to the presence of multiple ions derived from different peptides. To isolate the peptide corresponding to the m/z 2065.1 ion, the tryptic peptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC (supplemental Fig. S4); all the fractionated peptides were subjected to MALDI-TOF-MS/MS analysis. We isolated the peptide P2 that showed a major peak at m/z 2064.8 (Fig. 2A). The minor peak at m/z 1861.7 matches the calculated mass of the peptide EGF20-(26–41) (monoisotopic mass, 1861.8), the sequence of which was further confirmed by subsequent MS/MS analysis (not shown). Thus, the mass difference of 203.1 atomic mass units is consistent with the monoisotopic mass of HexNAc. MS/MS analysis of the ion at m/z 2064.8 yielded a major product ion at m/z 1862.0, which corresponds to the unglycosylated peptide mass (Fig. 2B). The neutral loss of the sugar moiety upon MS/MS is a characteristic feature of labile sugar modifications such as O-GlcNAc and O-fucose (22Whelan S.A. Hart G.W. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 415: 113-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 23Nita-Lazar A. Haltiwanger R.S. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 417: 93-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar); this further suggests the presence of HexNAc modification on the EGF20-(26–41). Determination of a Modification Site—To locate the Hex-NAc modification site, the MS/MS spectrum of the P2 peptide was further analyzed. In the spectrum, fragment ions corresponding to both glycosylated and deglycosylated peptides were observed (Fig. 2A; supplemental Fig. S5). For example, the y4 fragment occurs as deglycosylated (m/z 433.3) and glycosylated (m/z 636.4) ions. In contrast, the b12 fragment only occurs as deglycosylated ions (m/z 1429.6). This result narrowed down the HexNAc modification site to 38TGQK41. In the course of HPLC purification of the tryptic digest, a derivative of the EGF20-(26–41) peptide was obtained (P1 peptide in supplemental Fig. S4). MS/MS analysis of the P1 peptide indicated that this peptide contains a decomposed derivate of S-carbamidomethylated methionine; this decreased the mass of the"

The myxopyronins are possibly the first structurally characterized class of antibiotics known to act on this decisive step in gene expression control. A crystal structure of the antibiotic myxopyronin bound to bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) reveals insights into how the antibiotic binds to the transcription initiation complex and the mechanism of open complex formation. Structural studies of antibiotics not only provide a shortcut to medicine allowing for rational structure-based drug design, but may also capture snapshots of dynamic intermediates that become ‘frozen’ after inhibitor binding1,2. Myxopyronin inhibits bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) by an unknown mechanism3. Here we report the structure of dMyx—a desmethyl derivative of myxopyronin B4—complexed with a Thermus thermophilus RNAP holoenzyme. The antibiotic binds to a pocket deep inside the RNAP clamp head domain, which interacts with the DNA template in the transcription bubble5,6. Notably, binding of dMyx stabilizes refolding of the β′-subunit switch-2 segment, resulting in a configuration that might indirectly compromise binding to, or directly clash with, the melted template DNA strand. Consistently, footprinting data show that the antibiotic binding does not prevent nucleation of the promoter DNA melting but instead blocks its propagation towards the active site. Myxopyronins are thus, to our knowledge, a first structurally characterized class of antibiotics that target formation of the pre-catalytic transcription initiation complex—the decisive step in gene expression control. Notably, mutations designed in switch-2 mimic the dMyx effects on promoter complexes in the absence of antibiotic. Overall, our results indicate a plausible mechanism of the dMyx action and a stepwise pathway of open complex formation in which core enzyme mediates the final stage of DNA melting near the transcription start site, and that switch-2 might act as a molecular checkpoint for DNA loading in response to regulatory signals or antibiotics. The universally conserved switch-2 may have the same role in all multisubunit RNAPs."
https://openalex.org/W2062936856,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha) is a master transcriptional regulator of beta-oxidation and a prominent target of hypolipidemic drugs. To gain deeper insights into the systemic consequences of impaired fat catabolism, we used quantitative, mass spectrometry-based metabolic profiling to investigate the fed-to-fasted transition in PPARalpha(+/+) and PPARalpha(-/-) mice. Compared to PPARalpha(+/+) animals, acylcarnitine profiles of PPARalpha(-/-) mice revealed 2- to 4-fold accumulation of long-chain species in the plasma, whereas short-chain species were reduced by as much as 69% in plasma, liver, and skeletal muscle. These results reflect a metabolic bottleneck downstream of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1, a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the first step in beta-oxidation. Organic and amino acid profiles of starved PPARalpha(-/-) mice suggested compromised citric acid cycle flux, enhanced urea cycle activity, and increased amino acid catabolism. PPARalpha(-/-) mice had 40-50% lower plasma and tissue levels of free carnitine, corresponding with diminished hepatic expression of genes involved in carnitine biosynthesis and transport. One week of oral carnitine supplementation conferred partial metabolic recovery in the PPARalpha(-/-) mice. In summary, comprehensive metabolic profiling revealed novel biomarkers of defective fat oxidation, while also highlighting the potential value of supplemental carnitine as a therapy and diagnostic tool for metabolic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2063629951,"Large-scale production of biopharmaceuticals by current bioreactor techniques is limited by low transgenic efficiency and low expression of foreign proteins. In general, a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) harboring most regulatory elements is capable of overcoming the limitations, but transferring BAC into donor cells is difficult. We describe here the use of cattle mammary bioreactor to produce functional recombinant human lactoferrin (rhLF) by a novel procedure of transgenic cloning, which employs microinjection to generate transgenic somatic cells as donor cells. Bovine fibroblast cells were co-microinjected for the first time with a 150-kb BAC carrying the human lactoferrin gene and a marker gene. The resulting transfection efficiency of up to 15.79 x 10(-2) percent was notably higher than that of electroporation and lipofection. Following somatic cell nuclear transfer, we obtained two transgenic cows that secreted rhLF at high levels, 2.5 g/l and 3.4 g/l, respectively. The rhLF had a similar pattern of glycosylation and proteolytic susceptibility as the natural human counterpart. Biochemical analysis revealed that the iron-binding and releasing properties of rhLF were identical to that of native hLF. Importantly, an antibacterial experiment further demonstrated that rhLF was functional. Our results indicate that co-microinjection with a BAC and a marker gene into donor cells for somatic cell cloning indeed improves transgenic efficiency. Moreover, the cattle mammary bioreactors generated with this novel procedure produce functional rhLF on an industrial scale."
https://openalex.org/W1964066509,"Autophagy is a lysosome-dependent degradative pathway that regulates the turnover of intracellular organelles, parasites, and long-lived proteins. Deregulation of autophagy results in a variety of pathological conditions, but little is known regarding the mechanisms that link normal cellular and pathological signals to the regulation of distinct stages in the autophagy pathway. Here we uncover a novel role for the Abl family kinases in the regulation of the late stages of autophagy. Inhibition, depletion, or knockout of of the Abl family kinases, Abl and Arg, resulted in a dramatic reduction in the intracellular activities of the lysosomal glycosidases α-galactosidase, α-mannosidase and neuraminidase. Inhibition of Abl kinases also reduced the processing of the precursor forms of cathepsin D and cathepsin L to their mature, lysosomal forms, which coincided with the impaired turnover of long-lived cytosolic proteins and accumulation of autophagosomes. Furthermore, defective lysosomal degradation of long-lived proteins in the absence of Abl kinase signaling was accompanied by a perinuclear redistribution of lysosomes and increased glycosylation and stability of lysosome-associated membrane proteins, which are known to be substrates for lysosomal enzymes and play a role in regulating lysosome mobility. Our findings reveal a role for Abl kinases in the regulation of late-stage autophagy and have important implications for therapies that employ pharmacological inhibitors of the Abl kinases."
https://openalex.org/W2008920608,"People sometimes claim with high confidence to remember events that in fact never happened, typically due to strong semantic associations with actually encoded events. Sleep is known to provide optimal neurobiological conditions for consolidation of memories for long-term storage, whereas sleep deprivation acutely impairs retrieval of stored memories. Here, focusing on the role of sleep-related memory processes, we tested whether false memories can be created (a) as enduring memory representations due to a consolidation-associated reorganization of new memory representations during post-learning sleep and/or (b) as an acute retrieval-related phenomenon induced by sleep deprivation at memory testing. According to the Deese, Roediger, McDermott (DRM) false memory paradigm, subjects learned lists of semantically associated words (e.g., ""night"", ""dark"", ""coal"",...), lacking the strongest common associate or theme word (here: ""black""). Subjects either slept or stayed awake immediately after learning, and they were either sleep deprived or not at recognition testing 9, 33, or 44 hours after learning. Sleep deprivation at retrieval, but not sleep following learning, critically enhanced false memories of theme words. This effect was abolished by caffeine administration prior to retrieval, indicating that adenosinergic mechanisms can contribute to the generation of false memories associated with sleep loss."

In an effort to determine its structural basis of hemimethylated DNA recognition, we solved a high resolution crystal structure of the SRA domain from human UHRF1. By using NMR structure-guided analysis and mutagenesis, we further identified the amino acid residues that are important for SRA domain recognition of hemimethylated DNA.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Preparation—The SRA domain (residues 414–617) of human UHRF1 was cloned into the pET28a plasmid as an N-terminal His6-tagged fusion protein. The fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli (strain BL21(DE3)). Uniformly 15N- and 15N/13C-labeled proteins were prepared by growing bacteria in minimal medium with 15NH4Cl and/or [13C6]glucose as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources. Deuterated protein was generated by cell growth in 90% 2H2O. The SRA domain proteins were purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity and size exclusion columns followed by Mono S ion exchange chromatography after thrombin cleavage of the His6 tag. Protein NMR samples (∼0.5 mm) were prepared in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 150 mm NaCl and 2 mm dithiothreitol-d10 in H2O/2H2O (9:1) or 2H2O.DNA Preparation—High pressure liquid chromatography-purified 5′-fluorescein-labeled, 5′-biotinylated, unmodified or hemimethylated CpG oligonucleotides were purchased from Fisher (supplemental Table 1). The lyophilized oligonucleotides were resuspended to 2.0 mm in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 100 mm NaCl. Complementary strands were mixed in equal molar amounts and annealed by heating to 368 K and then cooled to room temperature.Site-directed Mutagenesis—Human UHRF1 SRA domain mutants were generated using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) and cloned into the pGEX6p1 vector as an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. The presence of appropriate mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing.NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR spectra were acquired at 293 K on an 800, 600, or 500 MHz NMR spectrometer. 1H, 13C, and 15N backbone resonances of the protein were assigned with three-dimensional deuterium-decoupled triple-resonance HNCA, HN(CA)CB, HN(COCA)CB, and HN(CO)-CACB spectra recorded on a uniformly 15N/13C-labeled and fractionally deuterated protein (21.Yamazaki T. Lee W. Arrowsmith C.H. Mahandiram D.R. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 11655-11666Crossref Scopus (494) Google Scholar). DNA titration was performed by recording a series of two-dimensional 15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectra on uniformly 15N-labeled SRA domain (∼0.5 mm) in the presence of different amounts of DNA oligonucleotides ranging from 0 to 0.05 mm.Crystallization—Native crystals of the UHRF1 SRA domain were obtained at 293 K with the vapor diffusion hanging drop method by mixing 1 μl of the protein solution with 1 μl of crystallization solution (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 200 mm NaCl, 1 m ammonium sulfate, and 15% glycerol). For initial phasing, sodium selenate (Na2SeO4) heavy atom derivative was prepared by soaking native SRA domain protein crystals in mother liquor solution in which the ammonium sulfate was substituted with sodium selenate while maintaining all remaining components constant. The crystal soaking was carried out for at least 1 h at 293 K to ensure SO4/SeO4 substitution. All diffraction data were measured at 100 K at Brookhaven National Laboratory beamlines X4C and X6A. The heavy atom soaked crystal and the native crystal diffracted to 3.0 and 1.95 Å, respectively. All data were processed with HKL-2000 (22.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38366) Google Scholar). The crystals belong to space group P3121 with unit cell dimensions of a = b = 65.6 Å, c = 95.4 Å, and α = β = γ = 120°. During the phasing process, one family protein crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 3BI7) was released, which was used as a molecular replacement template. The molecular replacement solution was used subsequently for the structure refinement to 1.95 Å using REFMAC5 (23.Pannu N.S. Murshudov G.N. Dodson E.J. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Open table in a new tab Fluorescence Anisotropy—The SRA domain binding affinity for 5′-fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotides was determined at 293 K using a TECAN Safire fluorescence reader with excitation at 470 nm and emission at 525 nm. The 5′-fluorescein-labeled DNA (5 nm) was added to a series of the wild-type or mutant SRA domain proteins with varying concentrations of 5 nm to 0.5 mm. Anisotropy values were referenced against a blank sample of buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 50 mm NaCl and 1 mm dithiothreitol) at the beginning of each experiment to account for background correction. The anisotropy data were fitted by nonlinear least-squares regression to the following equation: A = Amin + ((E + D + Kd) – ((E + D + Kd)2 – 4DE)1/2)(Amax – Amin)/(2D), where A is the anisotropy, E is the total protein concentration, D is the total DNA concentration, Amin is the anisotropy of free DNA, Amax is the anisotropy of the DNA-protein complex, and Kd is the dissociation constant. A 1:1 stoichiometry for the DNA-protein complex was assumed.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—The SRA domain/5′-biotin-labeled DNA binding was carried out in 10 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5) containing 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 2.5% glycerol, 50 ng/μl poly(dI-dC), and varying amounts of protein (0–15 μg) and/or biotin-labeled methyl-DNA (2–10 ng). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 296 K for 40 min and then electrophoresed on a 10% Tris borate/EDTA gel (Invitrogen) at 100 V for 1.5 h in 100 mm Tris borate/EDTA buffer. The reactions were transferred to a nylon membrane. The biotin-labeled DNA was detected with the LightShift chemiluminescent electrophoretic mobility shift assay kit (Pierce).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe SRA domain from the human UHFR1 protein was purified to homogeneity and crystallized under the conditions described in detail under “Experimental Procedures.” The three-dimensional crystal structure of the SRA domain from human UHFR1 was determined to 1.95 Å resolution (Table 1). As shown in Fig. 1a, its compact architecture is built on an eight-stranded β-barrel core consisting of amino acid sequences conserved in the SRA domain family (supplemental Fig. 1). One side of the β-barrel is curved around helix α1 through interactions with the conserved residues Trp430 and Arg433, whereas the amphipathic helix α2 closes off one end of the barrel by Asn505, Leu508, and Asn511, interacting with the residues in the core of the barrel. Moreover, the C-terminal helix α5 ties together the short N-terminal β1, emphasizing the modular nature of the structure. Note that the loop connecting β4 and α2 is flexible, as residues 484–495 were invisible in the electron density map.Based on SCOP and DALI searches, the structural fold of the SRA domain is distinct topologically from any available protein structures, including the β-barrel OB fold known to interact with nucleic acids (25.Murzin A.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar) and the methylated or non-methylated CpG-binding domains (26.Ho K.L. McNae I.W. Schmiedeberg L. Klose R.J. Bird A.P. Walkinshaw M.D. Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 525-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 27.Allen M.D. Grummitt C.G. Hilcenko C. Min S.Y. Tonkin L.M. Johnson C.M. Freund S.M. Bycroft M. Warren A.J. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4503-4512Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 2).The structure exhibits a large, distinct, positively charged patch on the SRA domain surface (Fig. 1b) composed of Arg431, Arg433, Arg443, Lys540, and Arg452. At this positive patch, the electron density map reveals a well ordered sulfate anion (from the crystallization buffer) and a glycerol molecule (from the cryoprotectant solution) that form salt bridges with Arg431 and Arg433, respectively, and a sulfate anion that forms hydrogen bonds with the side chain of Arg443 (Fig. 1a, right panel).We characterized SRA domain/methyl-DNA binding with NMR spectroscopy. As shown in two-dimensional 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectra (Fig. 1c), upon addition of a 13-nucleotide hemimethylated DNA duplex, a large number of protein amide resonances underwent major chemical shift perturbations and conformation exchange-induced line broadening. To identify SRA residues that are important for methyl-DNA recognition, we obtained 90% backbone 1H, 15N, and 13C resonance assignment of the protein with triple-resonance NMR spectra, including residues 484–495 in the β4/α2 loop (supplemental Fig. 3), which are structurally flexible and missing in the electron density map of the crystal structure. Interestingly, the residues that show the most profound chemical shift perturbations or line broadening upon binding to hemimethylated DNA are those located in the β4/α2 loop: Arg431, Phe432, and Arg433 in the β1/α1 loop; Arg443, His445, and Val446 in the α1/β2 loop; and Gly465, Tyr466, Glu467, and Asp469 in the β3/β4 loop (Fig. 1a, right panel). These four loops are spatially clustered at the positive patch of the protein (28.Jones S. Shanahan H.P. Berman H.M. Thornton J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 7189-7198Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), supporting the notion that these residues likely constitute the DNA-binding site. It is worth noting that many residues in the β1/α1, α1/β2, and β3/β4 loops are highly conservative in the SRA domain family (supplemental Fig. 1).Using a DNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), 2The abbreviation used is: EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay. we further demonstrated that the SRA domain recognizes a 13-nucleotide singly or doubly hemimethylated DNA duplex and forms a stable complex, but only very weakly, if at all, with a 13-nucleotide non-methylated DNA (Fig. 2a, lanes 2 and 3 versus lane 1). To investigate the molecular determinants of methyl-DNA binding by the SRA domain, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of Arg433, Arg443, Tyr466, Asp469, and Arg491, which are located at the putative DNA-binding site as mapped out by NMR titration. Individual Ala mutation of Arg433 and Arg491 did not cause a significant reduction in DNA binding, whereas mutants R443A and Y466G resulted in markedly decreased DNA binding compared with the wild type (Fig. 2b). Moreover, mutant D469G almost totally lost the ability to form a complex with hemimethylated DNA in the gel. Note that the D469G mutation did not cause any significant perturbation of the protein structure as judged by its similar one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum to that of the wild-type protein (supplemental Fig. 4a). Given that Arg443, Tyr466, and Asp469 are highly conserved in the SRA domain family (supplemental Fig. 1), we argue that these residues are likely important for the SRA domain interactions with DNA.FIGURE 2Molecular determinants of SRA domain binding to hemimethylated DNA. a, EMSA showing SRA domain (15 μg) binding to a non-methylated or singly or doubly hemimethylated DNA duplex of 13 nucleotides(10ng)(lanes 1–3) and forming a stable complex with hemimethylated DNA(2ng) in a protein concentration-dependent manner (0, 6, 7.5, 9, 10.5, 12, 13.5, and 15 μg, respectively, in lanes 4–11). b, EMSA assessing the binding of the wild-type and mutant SRA domain proteins (15 μg) to a 20-nucleotide hemimethylated DNA (5 ng).

The faction of SRA-bound DNA is plotted as a function of the protein concentration (from 5 nm to 0.5 mm) to determine dissociation constants. The DNA sequences are listed in supplemental Table 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To verify quantitatively the mutation effects, we determined the dissociation constants for the binding of the wild-type SRA domain and its mutants to a 5′-fluorescein-labeled 13-nucleotide hemimethylated DNA duplex in a fluorescent anisotropy binding study. The wild type bound the hemimethylated DNA with a Kd of ∼0.2 μm, whereas the R433A, R443A, Y466G, and R491A mutants showed a major reduction in binding affinity by 6-, 19-, 16-, and 7-fold, respectively (Fig. 2c). The D469G mutant showed much more reduced binding to the hemimethylated DNA, with a Kd of ∼50 μm, as determined by fluorescent anisotropy binding, consistent with its nearly complete loss of DNA binding in EMSA. Interesting, the D469G mutation resulted in a much more dramatic reduction in SRA domain binding to hemimethylated DNA than to non-methylated DNA of the same sequence, i.e. 250-fold versus 50-fold (supplemental Fig. 4b). Moreover, D469 mutant binding to non-methylated DNA was ∼2-fold tighter than to hemimethylated DNA (Kd = 25 μm versus 50 μm). Collectively, these results suggest a critical role of Asp469 in SRA domain recognition of hemimethylated DNA.In conclusion, our new crystal structure of the human UHRF1 SRA domain reported here enabled us to identify key amino acid residues, including Arg443, Tyr466, and Asp469, at the opening of the β-barrel that contribute to hemimethylated DNA binding. As these residues are highly conserved within the SRA domain family, we expect that our findings reported in this study will yield a better understanding of the structure-function relationship of the SRA domain family in epigenetic gene regulation. Almost all DNA methylation in the mammalian genome occurs in the CpG dinucleotide motif carried out by the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 and is maintained through DNA replication (1.Bernstein B.E. Meissner A. Lander E.S. Cell. 2007; 128: 669-681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar). As a heritable epigenetic mark, CpG methylation works in concert with histone modifications to control gene transcriptional silencing and heterochromatin formation (2.Johnson L. Bostick M. Zhang X.

Signaling cascades initiated by growth factors and leading to mTORC1 activation have been extensively characterized. Growth factor stimulation results primarily in the phosphorylation of TSC2, a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rheb GTPase, in a phosphoinositide 3-kinase- and protein kinase B (PKB)-dependent manner, followed by inactivation of TSC2 GAP activity (6.Inoki K.

It has been proposed that the decreased GAP activity allows Rheb to stay in an “active” GTP-bound form, leading to mTORC1 activation. In contrast to the mechanism of the growth factor-initiated mTORC1 activation, little is known about the mechanism(s) by which mTORC1 activity is regulated by amino acid availability (10.Roccio M.

However, most of the amino acid-sensing signaling machinery, including the amino acid sensors themselves, is unknown, and the mechanism(s) underlying the nutrient-sensing process remains to be identified. RalA and RalB GTPases belong to the Ras superfamily and are known to participate in multiple cellular processes through binding to diverse effector proteins. RalA effectors described to date include Ral-binding protein 1, Sec5, Exo84, filamin, and ZO-1-associated nucleic acid-binding protein (19.Cantor S.B. Urano T. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell.

RalB is highly homologous to RalA and shares an identical effector domain with RalA. However, these two proteins are believed to have distinct functions in cells (23.Lim K.H. Baines A.T.

In addition, an accumulating body of evidence shows that both RalA and RalGDS, an activator of RalA, are crucial for Ras-induced oncogenic transformation of cells and that Ras in fact binds to RalGDS and induces RalA activation (23.Lim K.H.

These observations suggest that the RalGDS-RalA signaling unit plays a role in cell proliferation; however, how RalA controls cell proliferation and participates in oncogenic transformation remains unknown. In this report, we show that RalA is activated in response to extracellular amino acids and that both RalGDS and RalA are indispensable for nutrient-induced mTORC1 activation. The RalGDS-RalA signaling unit functions downstream of Rheb and participates selectively in the nutrient-sensing system. Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa cells (ATCC CCL-2) were maintained as described previously (29.Okahara F. Itoh K. Nakagawara A. Murakami M. Kanaho Y. Maehama T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4888-4895Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Amino acid-free RPMI1640 medium (30.Ijichi C. Matsumura T. Tsuji T. Eto Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 303: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and glucose-free RPMI1640 medium (Invitrogen) were used for amino acid and glucose deprivation, respectively. Amino acid and glucose stimulation were performed by the addition of normal RPMI1640 medium and RPMI1640 medium containing 25 mm glucose, respectively. Serum starvation was carried out in RPMI1640 medium containing 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Transfection of plasmid DNA was carried out using either FuGENE HD (Roche Applied Science) or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Lipofectamine RNAi Max (Invitrogen) was used for transfection of siRNA; a mixed siRNA mixture was used unless otherwise specified. Transfections were performed according to the manufacturers' protocols. Plasmids and siRNAs—SMARTpool siRNA against human Rheb was purchased from Dharmacon. Other siRNAs (Stealth RNAi), including negative control siRNA, were purchased from Invitrogen: RALA RNAi 1 (HSS109033), RALA RNAi 3 (HSS109035), RALB RNAi 1-3 (HSS109036 to -109038), RALGDS RNAi 1 (HSS109039), and RALGDS RNAi 2 (HSS109040). Full-length human Rheb (NP_005605, amino acids 1-184) cDNA was amplified from HeLa cell cDNA by PCR and cloned into the EcoRI site of pCAGGS (31.Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4583) Google Scholar) to generate Rheb/pCAGGS. Rheb mutations S16H (tct to cat) and S20N (tcc to aat) were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using a PCR-based strategy. Full-length human RalA (NP_005393, amino acids 1-206) cDNA was amplified from HeLa cell cDNA by PCR with the addition of Myc tag sequence at the 5′-end, followed by cloning into the EcoRI/SalI site of pCMV5 (gift from David W. Russell) to generate Myc-RalA/pCMV5. The Q72L mutation (cag to ctc) was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis employing a PCR-based strategy. The coding region of Sec5-RBD was amplified from the Sec5-RBD/pGEX vector (32.Kawato M. Shirakawa R. Kondo H. Higashi T. Ikeda T. Okawa K. Fukai S. Nureki O. Kita T. Horiuchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 166-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) (gift of Dr. Hisanori Horiuchi; Kyoto University) and tagged with a FLAG sequence at the 5′-end by PCR, followed by cloning into the BamHI/EcoRI site of pEF1-MycHisA (Invitrogen) to generate Sec5-RBD/pEF1-FLAG. PrimerSTAR DNA polymerase (Takara) was used for all PCR amplifications, and sequences were confirmed using the BigDye Terminator method (Applied Biosystems). Immunoblot—Immunoblot analyses were conducted as described previously (29.Okahara F. Itoh K. Nakagawara A. Murakami M. Kanaho Y. Maehama T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4888-4895Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Antibodies used were anti-phospho-p70S6K (recognizes Thr412 of the α1 isoform, which corresponds to Thr389 of the α2 isoform; Upstate Biotechnology), anti-p70S6K (Epitomics), anti-RalA (R&D Systems), anti-RalA/B (R&D Systems), anti-Akt H136 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phospho-4EBP1 (Ser65) (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-4EBP1 (Bethyl Laboratories), anti-Rheb (Abcam), anti-α-tubulin (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and anti-DDDDK-Tag (MBL). The relative intensities of immunoreactive phospho-S6K and S6K bands were measured using the Image J Java applet. Briefly, the signal intensity of a selected band or corresponding neighboring control area was measured. After the control value was subtracted from each experimental value as background, the ratio of phospho-S6K to S6K signal was determined. The calculated pS6K/S6K values were normalized to that of the control experiment, and the normalized values were represented in each figure. Typical images from repeated experiments are represented in each figure. Reverse Transcription-PCR—RNA was prepared from cultured cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and reverse-transcribed into cDNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Takara). In order to confirm the RNAi against RalGDS, PCR was conducted in a 10-μl reaction mixture using 0.1 μg of cDNA as template and Blend-Taq polymerase (Toyobo). RalGDS primer sequences were 5′-agtcggccctgaacctttat-3′ (forward) and 5′-tccggaggttgacagaaatc-3′ (reverse); actin primer sequences were 5′-ggagaaaatctggcaccacacct-3′ (forward) and 5′-aggaaggaaggctggaagagtg-3′ (reverse). RalA Activation Assay—The assay was essentially conducted as described previously (32.Kawato M. Shirakawa R. Kondo H. Higashi T. Ikeda T. Okawa K. Fukai S. Nureki O. Kita T. Horiuchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 166-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, HeLa cells were lysed in lysis buffer consisting of 25 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 78 mm KCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 μm microcystin LR, and protease inhibitor mixture (Nacalai Tesque). After removal of insoluble materials, the lysate was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) for 10 min. Beads were removed by centrifugation, and then glutathione beads that were conjugated to glutathione S-transferase-fused Sec5-RBD protein were added to the cleared lysate and incubated for 30 min to allow GTP-bound RalA to bind to the beads. Beads were washed with lysis buffer, and bound proteins and lysate were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Band intensity of the RalA blot was measured using Image J, as described under “Immunoblot.” Typical images from repeated experiments are represented. All Sepharose beads were pretreated with 5% bovine serum albumin prior to use to reduce nonspecific binding. All procedures were carried out at 4 °C unless otherwise specified. Glutathione S-transferase-fused Sec5-RBD protein was prepared as described previously (32.Kawato M. Shirakawa R. Kondo H. Higashi T. Ikeda T. Okawa K. Fukai S. Nureki O. Kita T. Horiuchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 166-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), with the exception that Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) Codon Plus RP (Clontech) was used. RalA Is an Indispensable Component of the Nutrient-sensing System—Cell proliferation is a dynamic event that requires highly coordinated multiple cellular processes, such as DNA replication and protein synthesis, which are controlled by growth factor-initiated growth/proliferation signals and nutrient-sensing signals. mTORC1 is a critical component in the organization of these signaling systems to regulate cell proliferation (1.Avruch J. Hara K. Lin Y. Liu M. Long X. Ortiz-Vega S. Yonezawa K. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6361-6372Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 2.Corradetti M.N. Guan K.L.

Cell. 2006; 124: 471-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4668) Google Scholar). In order to understand the biological significance of Ral GTPases in the mTORC1-driven signaling systems, we knocked down Ral GTPases using conventional siRNA technology and then analyzed the effects on growth factor- and nutrient-induced mTORC1 activation in HeLa cells (Fig. 1). We successfully achieved RNAi-mediated suppression of both RalA and RalB as assayed by immunoblot analysis using anti-RalA and anti-RalA/B antibodies, respectively (Fig. 1). It is of note that the anti-RalA/B antibody used in this study (lot WIS01) recognizes both RalA and RalB; however, the antibody shows ∼10 times higher affinity for RalB than for RalA (according to the manufacturer's data sheet). We monitored phosphorylation of human p70S6K at Thr389 as a measure of mTORC1 activity throughout this study, since the Thr389 residue has been identified as a direct mTORC1 phosphorylation site (33.Moser B.A. Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Pearson R.B. Williamson N.A. Wettenhall R.E. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5648-5655Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 34.Romanelli A. Dreisbach V.C. Blenis J. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 20104-20112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). When cells were incubated in amino acid-depleted medium, phosphorylation of Thr389 was reduced to an almost undetectable level within 2 h. Thr389 phosphorylation became detectable 5-10 min after the readdition of amino acids and reached a plateau within 60 min in HeLa cells (data not shown). RalA knockdown robustly (∼90%) inhibited S6K phosphorylation induced by the addition of amino acids, whereas knockdown of RalB showed a relatively low level (∼30%) of suppression of S6K phosphorylation (Fig. 1, A and D). A similar effect was observed when two individual siRNAs were used to knock down RalA (supplemental Fig. 1), indicating that the inhibition of mTORC1 activation was not due to an “off-target” effect of the RNAi. This conclusion was further supported by the rescue experiment in which an RNAi-resistant RalA mutant, bearing silent mutations at codons 150 and 151, restored Thr389 phosphorylation under conditions of endogenous RalA knockdown (supplemental Fig. 2). Knockdown of either RalA or RalB also showed inhibitory effects on glucose-induced S6K phosphorylation that were of similar magnitude to those observed for amino acid-induced inhibition (Fig. 1, B and D), suggesting that both the amino acid- and glucose-sensing systems share the Ral GTPase-dependent core signaling machinery. In contrast, when cells were stimulated by insulin, which is known to activate mTORC1 in a phosphoinositide 3-kinase/PKB-dependent manner, RalA knockdown resulted in partial (∼20%) inhibition of S6K phosphorylation, and RalB knockdown resulted in no inhibition (Fig. 1, C and D). It is noteworthy that incubation of the cells in the presence of insulin for 15 min resulted in a level of S6K phosphorylation that was almost comparable with that observed in a 30-min incubation with either amino acids or glucose. This partial inhibition caused by the RalA knockdown might be a reflection of the requirement for a nutrient signal for growth factor-induced mTORC1 activation as described previously (1.Avruch J. Hara K. Lin Y. Liu M. Long X. Ortiz-Vega S. Yonezawa K. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6361-6372Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In addition, the effects of RalA and RalB knockdown on the phosphorylation of 4EBP1, another well characterized readout for mTORC1 activation, were very similar to their effects on S6K phosphorylation (Fig. 1, A-C). These results suggest that the nutrient-sensing system employs Ral GTPases to activate mTORC1 and that RalA is an indispensable component, whereas the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/PKB-dependent mTORC1 activation pathway does not depend to a significant extent on Ral GTPases. The Nutrient-sensing System Requires the RalGDS-RalA Signaling Unit—RalGDS is a well characterized upstream activator of the Ral GTPases in context of its relevance for cell proliferation. We therefore used RNAi to inactivate RalGDS in HeLa cells in order to analyze its role in the amino acid-sensing system. Unfortunately, we were unable to confirm the knockdown using commercially available anti-RalGDS antibodies to detect endogenous RalGDS; however, two distinct siRNAs against RalGDS successfully reduced expression of the RalGDS transcript (Fig. 2A). Cells transfected with these siRNAs showed reduced S6K phosphorylation at Thr389 upon the addition of amino acids to the medium (Fig. 2B). Because Ral GTPases appear to preferentially participate in the nutrient-induced mTORC1 activation pathway, we next tested whether the RalGDS contribution was selective for the nutrient-sensing system. As shown in Fig. 2, C and D, results of the RalGDS knockdown were fundamentally consistent with those observed for RalA knockdown (i.e. robust inhibition of amino acid- and glucose-induced mTORC1 activation). These findings strongly suggest that RalGDS participates in the nutrient-sensing system, presumably as an activator of Ral GTPases. In contrast, insulin-induced mTORC1 activation was not inhibited by RalGDS knockdown (Fig. 2, C and D), indicating that insulin induces mTORC1 activation in a RalGDS-independent manner. Hao et al. (36.Hao Y. Wong R. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 2851-2859Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) recently reported that RalGDS forms a complex with PKB, a critical component in growth factor-regulated mTORC1 activation, and promotes PKB activation in breast cancer cell lines. We are not able to completely explain the conflict between those findings and the results of this study or the discrepancy in the requirement for RalA and RalGDS in insulin-induced mTORC1 activation. However, taken together, these results suggest that RalGDS has more diverse effects on signaling systems than RalA and potentially provides a feedback mechanism for RalA action under some conditions. RalA Is Activated in Response to Amino Acid Availability—The observation that knockdown of either RalA or RalGDS, which facilitates GDP-GTP exchange of RalA, inhibited the amino acid-sensing system prompted us to ask whether RalA was activated in response to amino acid availability. We assayed RalA activation in cells using the Sec5-RBD protein, which selectively binds to the GTP-bound form of Ral GTPases and, therefore, can be used as an “active” Ral GTPase probe (32.Kawato M. Shirakawa R. Kondo H. Higashi T. Ikeda T. Okawa K. Fukai S. Nureki O. Kita T. Horiuchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 166-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Fig. 3, A and B, show that levels of the active, GTP-bound form of RalA increased following a 15-min incubation of cells with amino acids, reaching a plateau within 40 min. In contrast, RalB activation was not observed under these conditions (data not shown). In addition, overexpression of Sec5-RBD, which may inhibit RalA-dependent signals by binding toward active RalA, clearly suppressed amino acid-induced Thr389 phosphorylation of S6K (Fig. 3, C and D). In contrast, insulin-induced Thr389 phosphorylation was not inhibited by Sec5-RBD overexpression (Fig. 3, C and D). On the basis of these results, we conclude that nutrient-induced activation of RalA is a critical step for the activation of mTORC1. RalA Functions as a Downstream Component of Rheb—Rheb is the small GTPase that plays a crucial role in the mTORC1 activation machinery. Although the action of Rheb remains controversial, an accumulating body of evidence places Rheb upstream of and in proximity to mTORC1 (11.Long X. Lin Y. Ortiz-Vega S. Yonezawa K. Avruch J. Curr.

Our question arising here is whether RalA acts upstream or downstream of Rheb in the nutrient-sensing system, because RalA may exert its effect on diverse processes, such as cytoskeletal reorganization and membrane dynamics (19.Cantor S.B.

Therefore, we first investigated the effect of RalA and RalGDS knockdown on nutrient uptake and confirmed that neither knockdown inhibited uptake of amino acids or glucose (supplemental Fig. 3). Ectopic expression of the hyperactive Rheb mutant S16H resulted in a robust increase in S6K phosphorylation (Fig. 4, A and B), consistent with a previous report (43.Yan L. Findlay G.M. Jones R. Procter J. Cao Y. Lamb R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19793-19797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). RalA knockdown resulted in significant (40-50%) suppression of S6K phosphorylation in S16H-Rheb-expressing cells (Fig. 4, A and B), raising the possibility that RalA functions downstream of Rheb. In order to explore this possibility, we next asked whether RalA expression induced mTORC1 activation in the absence of Rheb. Knockdown of Rheb abolished amino acid-induced mTORC1 activation, and expression of the constitutively active Q72L-RalA mutant partially restored mTORC1 activation (Fig. 4C). The dominant negative S20N-Rheb mutant also inhibited amino acid-induced mTORC1 activation by ∼30%, and Q72L-RalA restored the activity (Fig. 4D). In addition, it should be noted that neither RalA nor RalGDS knockdown altered the “activation” (guanine nucleotide-binding) status of Rheb (supplemental Fig. 4). These observations collectively suggest that RalA primarily functions as a downstream component of Rheb in the amino acid-sensing system and that RalA requires Rheb to achieve full activation of mTORC1. Cross-talk Occurs between RalA and Rheb in mTORC1 Activation—We then asked how RalA transduces the signal from Rheb to mTORC1. One plausible mechanism is direct activation of mTORC1 by RalA; however, we were unable to detect direct activation of immunopurified mTORC1 by recombinant RalA protein (data not shown). Further, we were not able to detect direct association of either RalA or RalGDS with mTORC1 (data not shown). These results indicate that RalA alone would not be sufficient to induce mTORC1 activation, and another factor(s) must be required. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that Q72L-RalA did not fully restore S6K phosphorylation in cells when Rheb was depleted (Fig. 4C). Taken together, these results suggest that RalA promotes the action of Rheb to activate mTORC1 in response to extracellular nutrients, although further study will be required to unravel the underlying biochemistry (Fig. 5). Rheb was shown to bind directly to and activate mTORC1 (11.Long X. Lin Y. Ortiz-Vega S. Yonezawa K. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 702-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar, 38.Long X. Ortiz-Vega S. Lin Y. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23433-23436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). In addition, a recent report (37.Bai X. Ma D. Liu A. Shen X. Wang Q.J. Liu Y. Jiang Y. Science. 2007; 318: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Rheb binds to FKBP38, an endogenous inhibitor of mTORC1, and sequesters it from mTORC1 (Fig. 5). Therefore, we next asked whether RalA acts on FKBP38 to regulate mTORC1 activity. To address this question, we first tested the interaction between ectopically expressed Myc-RalA and FLAG-FKBP38; however, we were unable to detect the interaction of these molecules in HeLa cells (supplemental Fig. 5). In addition, it should be noted that we could not reproduce the inhibitory effect of FKBP38 on mTORC1 activity. Both S6K and 4EBP1 phosphorylation remained unaffected by overexpression of FKBP38 (supplemental Fig. 5). Further, knockdown of FKBP38 affected neither S6K nor 4EBP1 phosphorylation (supplemental Fig. 5). These observations are supported by a recent report (44.Wang X. Fonseca B.D. Tang H. Liu R. Elia A. Clemens M.J. Bommer U.A. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 30482-30492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), which argued that FKBP38 did not inhibit mTORC1 signaling. Taking these results together, we conclude that RalA participates in mTORC1 regulation independently to FKBP38 (Fig. 5). Growth factor signaling cascades also include Rheb as an indispensable regulator of mTORC1 activity. However, in contrast to the pathway employed by nutrient-sensing systems, growth factor-induced mTORC1 activation employs TSC2, a Rheb-GAP, as a critical mediator (45.Garami A. Zwartkruis F.J.

Xu T. Guan K.L. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1829-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). Since the precise mechanism by which cells discriminate between nutrient- and growth factor-induced Rheb signals remains unknown, it would be difficult to incorporate a specific mechanism for the action of RalA in mTORC1 activation into a simple scheme. However, our observation that growth factor-induced mTORC1 activation does not require RalA (Fig. 1) suggests that Rheb, which is activated as a result of growth factor stimulation and TSC2-inactivation, drives a pathway distinct from the nutrient-dependent pathway to activate mTORC1. S16H-Rheb might activate both RalA-dependent and RalA-independent signals, presumably due to its hyperactive characteristics (43.Yan L. Findlay G.M. Jones R. Procter J. Cao Y. Lamb R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19793-19797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), providing an explanation for the observation that depletion of RalA did not result in complete inhibition of S6K phosphorylation in S16H-Rheb-expressing cells (Fig. 4, A and B). Biological Significance of RalA as a Component of the Nutrient-sensing System—RalGDS and RalA are known to be potential oncogenic factors that are required for Ras-induced transformation of cells. A number of studies have indicated that these two molecules are essential but not necessarily sufficient for the transformation (23.Lim K.H. Baines A.T. Fiordalisi J.J. Shipitsin M. Feig L.A.

Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 219-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar); however, the exact reason for the RalGDS-RalA requirement has been poorly understood to date. This study has demonstrated that the RalGDS-RalA signaling unit plays a critical role in nutrient-sensing systems that drive mTORC1 activation in the regulation of diverse intracellular processes. In order to achieve accelerated proliferation, a hallmark of transformed cells, cells require large amounts of extracellular nutrients, such as amino acids for protein synthesis and carbohydrates as a major energy source. In addition, networks of nutrient-initiated intracellular processes, such as protein synthesis and ATP production, should be up-regulated simultaneously; however, up-regulation of these systems alone may not directly induce transformation. Intriguingly, these characteristics also apply to the requirement for RalA and RalGDS in cell proliferation and oncogenic transformation. Although further studies will be required to confirm the biological significance of RalGDS and RalA in vivo, our findings on the participation of RalGDS-RalA in the mTORC1 activation pathway provide novel insight into roles of RalGDS and RalA in cell proliferation and oncogenic transformation.

https://openalex.org/W2069055532,"Exported proteases of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) are potentially involved in pathogen-associated disorders leading to gastric inflammation and neoplasia. By comprehensive sequence screening of the H. pylori proteome for predicted secreted proteases, we retrieved several candidate genes. We detected caseinolytic activities of several such proteases, which are released independently from the H. pylori type IV secretion system encoded by the cag pathogenicity island (cagPAI). Among these, we found the predicted serine protease HtrA (Hp1019), which was previously identified in the bacterial secretome of H. pylori. Importantly, we further found that the H. pylori genes hp1018 and hp1019 represent a single gene likely coding for an exported protein. Here, we directly verified proteolytic activity of HtrA in vitro and identified the HtrA protease in zymograms by mass spectrometry. Overexpressed and purified HtrA exhibited pronounced proteolytic activity, which is inactivated after mutation of Ser205 to alanine in the predicted active center of HtrA. These data demonstrate that H. pylori secretes HtrA as an active protease, which might represent a novel candidate target for therapeutic intervention strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2110985713,"Visual categorization may already start within the first 100-ms after stimulus onset, in contrast with the long-held view that during this early stage all complex stimuli are processed equally and that category-specific cortical activation occurs only at later stages. The neural basis of this proposed early stage of high-level analysis is however poorly understood. To address this question we used magnetoencephalography and anatomically-constrained distributed source modeling to monitor brain activity with millisecond-resolution while subjects performed an orientation task on the upright and upside-down presented images of three different stimulus categories: faces, houses and bodies. Significant inversion effects were found for all three stimulus categories between 70–100-ms after picture onset with a highly category-specific cortical distribution. Differential responses between upright and inverted faces were found in well-established face-selective areas of the inferior occipital cortex and right fusiform gyrus. In addition, early category-specific inversion effects were found well beyond visual areas. Our results provide the first direct evidence that category-specific processing in high-level category-sensitive cortical areas already takes place within the first 100-ms of visual processing, significantly earlier than previously thought, and suggests the existence of fast category-specific neocortical routes in the human brain."
https://openalex.org/W2088630760,"Background Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have a central role in the recognition of pathogens and the initiation of the innate immune response. Myeloid differentiation primary-response gene 88 (MyD88) and TIR-domain-containing adaptor protein inducing IFNβ (TRIF) are regarded as the key signaling adaptor proteins for TLRs. Melioidosis, which is endemic in SE-Asia, is a severe infection caused by the gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei. We here aimed to characterize the role of MyD88 and TRIF in host defense against melioidosis. Methodology and Principal Findings First, we found that MyD88, but not TRIF, deficient whole blood leukocytes released less TNFα upon stimulation with B. pseudomallei compared to wild-type (WT) cells. Thereafter we inoculated MyD88 knock-out (KO), TRIF mutant and WT mice intranasally with B. pseudomallei and found that MyD88 KO, but not TRIF mutant mice demonstrated a strongly accelerated lethality, which was accompanied by significantly increased bacterial loads in lungs, liver and blood, and grossly enhanced liver damage compared to WT mice. The decreased bacterial clearance capacity of MyD88 KO mice was accompanied by a markedly reduced early pulmonary neutrophil recruitment and a diminished activation of neutrophils after infection with B. pseudomallei. MyD88 KO leukocytes displayed an unaltered capacity to phagocytose and kill B. pseudomallei in vitro. Conclusions MyD88 dependent signaling, but not TRIF dependent signaling, contributes to a protective host response against B. pseudomallei at least in part by causing early neutrophil recruitment towards the primary site of infection."

MPK38 was originally identified as a murine counterpart for its human homolog, HPK38/hMelk/KIAA175, that may be involved in the proliferation of interleukin-4-induced normal human keratinocytes (9.Gil M.

However, the physiological regulation and functions of MPK38 have remained unclear.To explore a functional link between ASK1 and MPK38 signaling pathways, we investigated the effect of MPK38 on ASK1 and its downstream targets. We demonstrated that MPK38 physically interacts with ASK1. MPK38 phosphorylates Thr838 (corresponding to Thr845 in mice) within the activation loop of human ASK1, which subsequently leads to the stimulation of ASK1 kinase activity. Moreover, this interaction results in the enhancement of JNK-mediated transactivation and H2O2-induced apoptosis.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture, Plasmids, Reagents, and Cell Line Construction—HEK293, 293T, HaCaT, and SK-N-BE(2)C cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen).

For native PAGE to determine the in vitro binding between MPK38 and ASK1, the procedure was the same as that of denaturing SDS-PAGE, except that solutions did not contain SDS or β-mercaptoethanol, and samples were not boiled prior to loading (18.Jung H.

Cells transiently transfected with the indicated expression vectors were harvested and lysed with buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1 m KCl, and 0.3 m NaCl). The cleared lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation by incubation for 2 h at 4 °C with the appropriate antibodies. After washing the immunoprecipitate three times with lysis buffer, then twice with each kinase buffer (for ASK1, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm DTT, and 20 mm MgCl2; for MKK3/6, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 25 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm DTT, and 25 mm MgCl2; for p38, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.2 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm MgCl2), the immunoprecipitates were assayed for the indicated protein kinase activities in the presence of each kinase buffer containing 5 μg of recombinant GST-tagged substrates. The reaction mixtures were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and detected by autoradiography. Recombinant GST-tagged ZPR9, MKK6(K82A), p38, and ATF2 were used as substrates for MPK38, ASK1, MKK3 or MKK6, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), respectively. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay.Assays for MPK38 and JNK Activities—Cells were transiently transfected with GST-tagged MPK38 or JNK, along with indicated expression vectors, and solubilized with lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1 m KCl, and 0.3 m NaCl). The cleared lysates were precipitated by glutathione-Sepharose beads. The GST precipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (for MPK38, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT, and 10 mm MgCl2; for JNK, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 25 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm DTT, and 20 mm MgCl2), and then subjected to an in vitro kinase assay using recombinant ZPR9 (19.Seong H.-A. Gil M. Kim K.-T. Kim S.J. Ha H. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 597-604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or c-Jun as a substrate in the presence of 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Experiments—The MPK38 siRNAs of the oligonucleotide 1 (5′-CAGGCAGACAAUGGAGGAUTT-3′) targeting a coding region (amino acids 297–303) and oligonucleotide 2 (5′-AACCCAAGGGUAACAAGGATT-3′) targeting a coding region (amino acids 156–162) on MPK38 (GenBank™ accession number NM010790), as well as ASK1 siRNA (5′-GGUAUACAUGAGUGGAAUUTT-3′) (20.Ouyang M. Shen X. J. Neurochem. 2006; 97: 234-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), were synthesized from SamChully Pharm. Co., Ltd. (Seoul, Korea). The sense and antisense oligonucleotides for each siRNA were mixed and heated at 90 °C for 2 min, and the combined reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. HEK293 cells grown were plated in 6-well flat-bottomed microplates (Nunc) at a concentration of 2 × 105 cells per well the day before transfection. siRNA oligonucleotides with the indicated concentrations were transfected into cells using WelFect-Ex™ Plus. After 48 h of transfection, immunoblottings were carried out to confirm the down-regulation of target proteins.Luciferase Reporter Assay—293T cells were transfected according to the WelFect-Ex™ Plus method with the AP-1-Luc reporter plasmid, along with each expression vector as indicated. After 48 h, the cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was monitored with a luciferase assay kit (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. Light emission was determined with a Berthold luminometer (Microlumat LB96P). Total DNA concentration was kept constant by supplementing with empty vector DNAs. The values were adjusted with respect to expression levels of a cotransfected β-galactosidase reporter control, and experiments were repeated at least three times.Assays for Apoptosis—For cell death experiments using the green fluorescent protein (GFP) system (18.Jung H. Seong H.-A. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35293-35307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), HEK293 cells grown on sterile coverslips were transfected with pEGFP (a GFP-encoding expression vector) together with expression vectors as indicated. After 24 h of transfection, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated for 40 h in serum-free medium. The cells were fixed with ice-cold 100% methanol, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and then stained with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride. The 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride-stained nuclei of GFP-positive cells were analyzed for apoptotic morphology by fluorescence microscopy. The percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated as the number of GFP-positive cells with apoptotic nuclei divided by the total number of GFP-positive cells. Terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Cells exposed to 1 mm H2O2 for 9 h were used as a positive control.RESULTSDirect Interaction of MPK38 and ASK1 in Vivo and in Vitro—We initially performed in vitro kinase assays using 293T cells to identify MPK38-specific stimuli that modulate MPK38 kinase activity. Among the various stimuli tested, MPK38 precipitate from cell lysates treated with H2O2 at concentrations of more than 0.5 mm significantly induced MPK38 kinase activity compared with untreated MPK38 precipitate (Fig. 1A, left). We next analyzed the kinetics of MPK38 and ASK1 kinase activity in H2O2-stimulated 293T cells. The stimulation of MPK38 and ASK1 kinase activity was detected at 5 min after treatment with 2 mm H2O2, peaked at 30 min, and decreased thereafter (Fig. 1A, right). These results suggested that cross-talk between MPK38 and ASK1 signaling pathways may exist as H2O2 is well known to activate ASK1.FIGURE 1Direct interaction of MPK38 with ASK1 in vivo and in vitro. A, regulation of MPK38 and ASK1 kinase activity by H2O2. 293T cells transiently transfected with wild-type GST-MPK38 were incubated with increasing amounts of H2O2 for 30 min, and MPK38 was purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads. The GST precipitates were subjected to an in vitro kinase assay using ZPR9 as a substrate, followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (left). For H2O2 time-dependent regulation of MPK38 and ASK1 kinase activity, 293T cells were treated with 2 mm H2O2 for the indicated times. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated by the indicated antibodies, and the kinase activities of MPK38 and ASK1 were determined by in vitro kinase assays using ZPR9 and MKK6(K82A) as substrates (right). The circled P-ZPR9 and P-MKK6(K82A) indicate the phosphorylated ZPR9 and MKK6(K82A), respectively. The relative level of kinase activity was quantitated by densitometric analyses, and fold increase relative to untreated samples was calculated. IP, immunoprecipitation; WB, Westernblot. B, invivo and invitro association of MPK38 with ASK1. GST alone and GST-MPK38 were cotransfected with FLAG-ASK1 into 293T cells. GST fusion proteins were purified on glutathione-Sepharosebeads (GST Purification), and the amounts of complex formation and FLAG-ASK1 used for the in vivo binding assay were determined by anti-FLAG antibody immunoblot (left). Cell lysates from HEK293 cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation using either rabbit preimmune serum (Preimm.) or anti-MPK38 antibody (α-MPK38), followed by immunoblot analysis using an anti-ASK1 antibody to determine the complex formation between endogenous MPK38 and ASK1 (middle). As a control, the expression levels of MPK38 and ASK1 in the total cell lysate were analyzed by immunoblot using anti-MPK38 and anti-ASK1 antibodies, respectively. For native PAGE (8%) of the MPK38-ASK1 complex (right), purified recombinant MPK38 was autophosphorylated as described under “Materials and Methods.” Autophosphorylated MPK38 (2–3 μg) was incubated with unlabeled recombinant GST or GST-ASK1(K709R) (each 5 μg) at room temperature for 1 h. C, effect of MPK38 and ASK1 kinase activities on MPK38-ASK1 association. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with the appropriate expression plasmids, and MPK38-ASK1 complex formation was determined by Western blot analysis using anti-HA or anti-FLAG antibody as described in B. D, modulation of MPK38-ASK1(K709R), MPK38(K40R)-ASK1, or MPK38(K40R)-ASK1(K709R) complex formation by H2O2. HEK293 cells transfected with the indicated expression vectors were incubated with or without 2 mm H2O2 for 30 min. The level of MPK38-ASK1 complex was analyzed by immunoblot using an anti-HA antibody. E, H2O2 and TNF-α modulation of MPK38-ASK1 interaction. HEK293 cells transfected with the expression vectors indicated were treated with 2 mm H2O2 for 30 min or 500 ng/ml TNF-α for 30 min. Cell lysates were purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (GST Purification) and immunoblotted with an anti-FLAG antibody (upper). The endogenous level of MPK38-ASK1 complex in the presence or absence of H2O2 (or TNF-α) was also analyzed by immunoblot using an anti-ASK1 antibody (lower). The relative level of MPK38-ASK1 complex formation was quantitated by densitometric analyses and fold increase relative to untreated samples expressing wild-type MPK38 and ASK1 was calculated (C–E).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To test whether MPK38 is associated with ASK1 in cells, we performed cotransfection experiments using GST-MPK38 and FLAG-ASK1 expression vectors. The interactions between FLAG-tagged ASK1 proteins and GST-MPK38 fusion proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-FLAG antibody. ASK1 was detected in the coprecipitate only when coexpressed with GST-MPK38 but not with control GST alone, demonstrating that MPK38 physically interacts with ASK1 (Fig. 1B, left). To confirm the endogenous interaction between MPK38 and ASK1, we carried out coimmunoprecipitation experiments using endogenous MPK38 and ASK1 in HEK293 cells. Immunoprecipitation of endogenous MPK38 by anti-MPK38 antibody and then immunoblotting with an anti-ASK1 antibody led to the clear identification of an interaction between the two endogenous MPK38 and ASK1 proteins (Fig. 1B, middle). We have further determined this association using other cell lines, including NIH 3T3 cells and R1.1 hematopoietic cells highly expressing MPK38 (15.Yang Y. Gil M. Lee Y. Ha H. Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 1999; 80: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), and we confirmed that this association could occur in vivo (data not shown). We also analyzed the in vitro association of purified, recombinant ASK1 with MPK38 using nondenaturing PAGE. Autophosphorylated recombinant MPK38 was incubated with an unlabeled, recombinant kinase-dead form of ASK1 (ASK1(K709R)) or with GST as a nonspecific control. A shift in the mobility of 32P-labeled MPK38 was clearly evident upon incubation in the presence of ASK1(K709R), but it was undetectable when 32P-labeled MPK38 was incubated with GST alone or in the absence of ASK1(K709R), providing additional evidence of a physical association between MPK38 and ASK1 (Fig. 1B, right).To investigate whether the activity of both kinases was involved in the association between MPK38 and ASK1, we used an in vivo binding assay to examine the effects of the kinase-dead forms of MPK38 and ASK1 on MPK38-ASK1 complex formation. Expression of kinase-dead ASK1 (ASK1(K709R)) or ASK1(T838A), which is defective in ASK1 activation, resulted in a significant reduction of complex formation compared with expression of wild-type ASK1 (Fig. 1C, left and middle). Similar results were also observed with the kinase-dead MPK38 (MPK38(K40R)) in the analysis of the association between MPK38 and ASK1 (Fig. 1C, right). Consistent with this, the interaction was very weakly detected when the kinase-dead forms of both MPK38 and ASK1 were expressed (Fig. 1C, right, 6th lane). In addition, H2O2 treatment did not contribute to the modulation of the association between MPK38 and ASK1 containing kinase-dead MPK38 and/or ASK1 (Fig. 1D, 3rd and 4th lanes versus 5th to 10th lanes), indicating that the kinase activity of both MPK38 and ASK1 is important for H2O2-mediated modulation of MPK38-ASK1 complex formation.Modulation of MPK38-ASK1 Complex Formation by ASK1 Stimuli—We assessed whether H2O2, a stimulator of ASK1, can influence the MPK38-ASK1 complex formation in HEK293 cells transfected with plasmid vectors expressing GST-MPK38 and FLAG-ASK1. After 48 h of transfection, cells were incubated in media with or without 2 mm H2O2 for 30 min. MPK38 was precipitated and the coprecipitation of ASK1 was determined by anti-FLAG immunoblot. MPK38-ASK1 association was significantly increased by H2O2 treatment compared with untreated control (Fig. 1E, upper left). Similarly, the interaction of MPK38 and ASK1 appears to be increased by other ASK1 stimuli, including TNF-α, endoplasmic reticulum stress (thapsigargin), and calcium overload (ionomycin) (Fig. 1E, upper right, and data not shown). We also determined the effect of ASK1 stimulators on the physical interaction between endogenous MPK38 and ASK1 in HEK293 cells. Exposure of the cells ASK1 stimuli, such as H2O2, TNF-α, thapsigargin, and ionomycin resulted in a considerable increase in endogenous MPK38-ASK1 complex formation (Fig. 1E, lower, and data not shown), suggesting the involvement of MPK38 in the ASK1 signaling pathway.Mapping of the Binding Domain Required for the MPK38-ASK1 Interaction—We performed in vivo binding assays to determine which domain of ASK1 contributes to MPK38 binding. The carboxyl-terminal regulatory domain (ASK1-C, amino acids 941–1375) of ASK1 was found to be responsible for MPK38 binding, whereas the amino-terminal (ASK1-N, amino acids 1–648) and kinase (ASK1-K, amino acids 649–940) domains were unable to bind with MPK38 (Fig. 2A), indicating that ASK1 physically interacts with MPK38 through its carboxyl-terminal regulatory domain.FIGURE 2Mapping of the ASK1 and MPK38 interaction domains. The schematic structures of wild-type and deletion constructs of ASK1 (A) and MPK38 (B) are indicated. Numbers indicate the amino acid residues corresponding to the domain boundaries. 293T cells transiently transfected with the indicated expression vectors were lysed and then precipitated using glutathione-Sepharose beads (GST Purification), and immunoblotted with an anti-HA antibody to determine the level of MPK38-ASK1 complex formation. The same blot was re-probed with an anti-GST antibody to confirm the expression of GST fu"

We investigated the effects of disrupting PKA targeting to AKAPs in the heart by expressing the 24-amino acid regulatory subunit RII-binding peptide, Ht31, its inactive analog, Ht31P, or enhanced green fluorescent protein by adenoviral gene transfer into rat hearts in vivo. Ht31 expression resulted in loss of the striated staining pattern of type II PKA (RII), indicating loss of PKA from binding sites on endogenous AKAPs. In the absence of isoproterenol stimulation, Ht31-expressing hearts had decreased +dP/dtmax and -dP/dtmin but no change in left ventricular ejection fraction or stroke volume and decreased end diastolic pressure versus controls. This suggests that cardiac output is unchanged despite decreased +dP/dt and -dP/dt. There was also no difference in PKA phosphorylation of cardiac troponin I (cTnI), phospholamban, or ryanodine receptor (RyR2). Upon isoproterenol infusion, +dP/dtmax and -dP/dtmin did not differ between Ht31 hearts and controls. At higher doses of isoproterenol, left ventricular ejection fraction and stroke volume increased versus isoproterenol-stimulated controls. This occurred in the context of decreased PKA phosphorylation of cTnI, RyR2, and phospholamban versus controls. We previously showed that expression of N-terminal-cleaved cTnI (cTnI-ND) in transgenic mice improves cardiac function. Increased cTnI N-terminal truncation was also observed in Ht31-expressing hearts versus controls. Increased cTnI-ND may help compensate for reduced PKA phosphorylation as occurs in heart failure.

We investigated the effect of disrupting PKA targeting to AKAPs to determine the effect of AKAP targeting of PKA on regulation of cardiac function in vivo. Because the inotropic response to β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) stimulation is dependent upon PKA protein phosphorylation, we predicted an impaired response to β-AR stimulation upon disruption of PKA targeting to substrates in the heart. In addition to regulation by PKA-dependent phosphorylation, cardiac TnI (cTnI) (5Kentish J.C. McCloskey D.T. Layland J. Palmer S. Leiden J.M. Martin A.F. Solaro R.J. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 1059-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), is subject to proteolysis. Truncation of 28–31 amino acids from the cardiac-specific N-terminal of cTnI, most likely by calpain-dependent proteolysis (6Yu Z.B. Zhang L.F. Jin J.-P. J. Biol.

Thus, the inhibitory function of cTnI is not affected by N-terminal cleavage (6Yu Z.B. Zhang L.F. Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15753-15760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 7Barbato J.C. Huang Q.Q. Hossain M.M. Bond M. Jin J.-P. J. Biol.

Consistent with this idea, we previously showed that transgenic mice expressing low (16–30% of total cTnI) or high (41–82%) levels of cTnI-ND showed beneficial effects on cardiac function (Table 2 and Figs. 4 and 6 in Ref. 7Barbato J.C.

Chem. 2005; 280: 6602-6609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), thus mimicking the effects of PKA phosphorylation of N-terminal serines. Recapitulation of effects of PKA phosphorylation of cTnI by N-terminal truncation may be due to the fact that phosphorylation of serines 23 and 24 results in folding of the N-terminal away from the long axis of cTnI such that it no longer binds to the C terminus of TnC (9Dong W.-J. Chandra M. Xing J. Solaro R.J. Cheung H.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6745-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 10Dong W.-J. Chandra M. Xing J. She M. Solaro J. Cheung H.C.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7790-7800Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Proteolytic cleavage of the N terminus of cTnI, which eliminates interaction with cTnC, mimics this loss of binding. In addition, in vitro studies have shown that cleavage of the N terminus of cTnI occurs to a greater extent under conditions of decreased PKA phosphorylation of serines 23 and 24 (8Di Lisa F.

Biochem. 2003; 251: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). As indicated above, conformational changes in cTnI occur upon PKA phosphorylation. Thus, it is likely that when N-terminal serines are unphosphorylated, changes in the shape of cTnI alter accessibility of the N-terminal cleavage site to the protease. PKA phosphorylation of several PKA substrates is reduced in heart failure; thus, the observation of increased N-terminal cleavage of cTnI upon decreased PKA phosphorylation is of great clinical interest. We propose that N-terminal proteolysis of cTnI compensates for decreased activity of the β-adrenergic signaling pathway and avoids potentially deleterious effects of prolonged cAMP elevation. In this study we first tested whether increased PKA phosphorylation of cTnI in rat cardiac myocytes recapitulates PKA phosphorylation-dependent differences in proteolysis of cTnI observed in vitro. We predicted that PKA-dependent cTnI phosphorylation would be decreased by disruption of PKA targeting to AKAPs in the heart in vivo. If this hypothesis proved to be correct, we hypothesized that decreased PKA-dependent cTnI phosphorylation would then result in increased cleavage of the N terminus of cTnI. Cardiac function is improved with overexpression of cTnI-ND in transgenic mice (7Barbato J.C. Huang Q.Q. Hossain M.M. Bond M. Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6602-6609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Furthermore, impaired cardiac dysfunction in Gsα-deficient transgenic mice is partially restored by crossing Gsα mice with cTnI-ND-overexpressing mice (14Feng H. Chen M. Weinstein L.S. Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 33384-33393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We, therefore, hypothesize that disruption of PKA targeting to endogenous AKAPs in rat hearts in vivo has salutary effects on contractility, compensating for reduced PKA phosphorylation of other PKA substrates. We tested this hypothesis by introducing the 24 amino acid, RII-binding peptide, Ht31, by adenoviral gene transfer into rat hearts in vivo. This 24-amino acid peptide has been widely used to disrupt PKA/AKAP interaction; for example, Ht31 inhibits aquaporin-2 phosphorylation by PKA in renal cells (15Klussmann E. Maric K. Wiesner B.

Adenovirus Construction—Recombinant adenovirus encoding HA-tagged Ht31 peptide (Ad-HA-Ht31493–515; Ht31) or HA-tagged Ht31P (proline-substituted derivative) (Ad-HA-Ht31P493–515; Ht31P) were generated (19He T.C.

Ht31P, with a proline replacing an isoleucine in the RII binding domain, disrupts the amphipathic helix required for RII binding; thus, Ht31P expression does not block PKA/AKAP interaction and serves as a negative control. Using the AdEasy™ XL adenoviral vector system, the cDNA encoding either Ht31493–515 (residues 493–515) or Ht31P493–515 (residues 493–515; I507P) (kindly supplied by Dr. John Scott, Vollum Institute, Oregon Health Science University, Portland, OR) were cloned into the pShuttle-CMV vector. Adenoviral stock solutions (stored at -80 °C) were diluted with phosphate-buffered saline (1:1), thawed, and maintained at 37 °C until the time of injection. In all cases a viral solution was injected into rat hearts containing 250 μl of buffer containing 1.2 × 1012 particles/ml adenovirus or buffer alone, as described (20Matsui T. Tao J. del Monte F.

Biol. 2003; 219: 179-193PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to Ht31P, adenovirus encoding enhanced green fluorescence protein (Ad-eGFP) served as control. No significant differences were observed in cardiac function, protein phosphorylation, or cTnI proteolytic cleavage between Ht31P or eGFP-expressing hearts; thus, Ht31P and eGFP were together reported as controls. Adenoviral preparations (Ht31, Ht31P, eGFP) were obtained from the NIH/NHLBI-sponsored Preclinical Vector Core Facility, University of Pittsburgh. In Vivo Adenoviral Gene Transfer into Rat Hearts—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250–300 g) were used for gene transfer into rat hearts in vivo. Experiments were performed under the supervision of a full-time veterinarian. Veterinary care was maintained in Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care-approved facilities. The Animal Research Committee at the Cleveland Clinic approved all protocols and the methods of anesthesia, surgery, and euthanasia. Gene transfer of Ht31, Ht31P, or eGFP into rat hearts was performed as described (20Matsui T. Tao J. del Monte F. Lee K.H. Li L. Picard M. Force T.L. Franke T.F. Hajjar R.J. Rosenzweig A.

In brief, rats were anesthetized with 50 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital, placed in a supine position, intubated, and ventilated at 80 breaths per min. Mid-sternotomy was performed, the pericardium was opened, and a 7-0 suture was placed at the apex of the LV to secure the heart for catheter injection. A 24-gauge catheter containing 250 μl of adenovirus was advanced from the apex of the LV to the aortic root. Aorta and pulmonary arteries were clamped distal to the catheter, and then the adenoviral solution was injected. The clamp was maintained for 60 s. This allowed for perfusion at low pressure, and, thus, efficient adenoviral infection of the endocardium. Within 60 s of clamp release, heart rate and ventricular pressure quickly recovered to base line. The sternum and skin were then closed by creating a negative pressure gradient using a 10-ml syringe placed in the closed chest to reduce any residual pneumothorax. Once completed, the animals were ventilated for an additional 10–15 min, extubated, and transferred back to their cages. Cardiac Function—Transthoracic two-dimensional and M-mode echocardiography were performed using a 15-mHz linear-array transducer coupled with an Acuson Sequoia C256 (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) (22Askari A. Unzek S. Goldman C.K. Ellis S.G. Thomas J.D. DiCorleto P.E. Topol E.J. Penn M.S. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2004; 43: 1908-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 23Popovic Z.B. Richards K.E.

Animals were lightly sedated with ketamine (50 mg/kg; intraperitoneal injection) for basal echocardiographic measurements. For physiological evaluation during isoproterenol stimulation, animals were sedated in a chamber using 5% isoflurane/95% oxygen mixture, intubated, artificially ventilated with a pressure cycled rodent ventilator (Kent Scientific Corp., RSP1002) at 80 breaths per min and maintained under anesthesia (2.5% isoproterenol flurane, 97.5% O2). Cardiac dimensions were measured between the intraventricular septum wall thickness and posterior wall thickness from the short-axis view at the level of papillary muscles from at least three cardiac cycles. A second catheter was inserted into the left jugular vein to deliver incremental doses of isoproterenol, at 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 μg/kg of body weight/min. Base-line measurements were obtained before isoproterenol infusion, and then the effect of isoproterenol stimulation was determined 2 min after the start of isoproterenol infusion. Percent LV ejection fraction (LVEF) was calculated as (EDV - ESV)/EDV × 100, where EDV = end diastolic volume, and ESV = end systolic volume; stroke volume = EDV - ESV. Heart rate = 1/(R - R interval), expressed as beats/min. LV systolic and diastolic properties were measured in vivo (23Popovic Z.B. Richards K.E. Greenberg N.L. Rovner A. Drinko J. Cheng Y. Penn M.S.

A miniaturized impedance/micro-manometer microtip pressure-volume catheter (Millar Instruments) was inserted into the right carotid vein and advanced into the LV under pressure control. After evaluation of cardiac function, hearts were harvested for biochemical measurements, immediately stored in liquid N2, or placed in Cyro-O.C.T. compound (Tissue-Tek) and stored at -80 °C. Western Blot Analysis—PKA-dependent protein phosphorylation was measured 7-days after in vivo gene transfer of Ht31, Ht31P, or eGFP in LV homogenates (25McConnell B.K. Moravec C.S. Morano I. Bond M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H1440PubMed Google Scholar, 26McConnell B.K. Moravec C.S. Bond M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H385PubMed Google Scholar). Tissue was obtained immediately after maximal isoproterenol infusion or, in a subset of animals, under base-line conditions. For Western blot analysis of protein phosphorylation in homogenates of rat heart LV, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE: Tris-glycine 4–12% gradient gels for cTnI and PLB, Tris acetate 3–8% gradient NUPAGE gels for RyR2, Tris-glycine 12% gels for cTnI-ND/cTnI, and Tris-glycine 16% gels for lysates obtained from adult rat cardiac myocytes. Extent of PKA-dependent protein phosphorylation was assessed using antibodies recognizing total and phosphorylated PKA substrates (cTnI, RyR2, and PLB). The ratio of phosphorylated to total protein was then determined. Restore stripping buffer (Pierce) was used to remove the first primary antibody from the immunoblots (anti-phospho-TnI, anti-phospho-RyR2, and anti-phospho-PLB, respectively). After stripping, blots were reprobed with the new primary antibody (anti-TnI, anti-RyR2, and anti-PLB). Antibody description and dilution are as follows. (i) Phospho-TnI (cardiac) (Ser-23/24) rabbit polyclonal primary antibody (1:2500 dilution; Cell Signaling) recognizes cTnI phosphorylated at serines 23/24; cTnI rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:2500 dilution; Cell Signaling) recognizes total cTnI. Phospho-TnI and total-TnI antibodies were probed with anti-rabbit IgG, horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (1:2500 dilution; Cell Signaling). (ii) RyR2 phosphorylated at serine 2809 was measured with phospho-RyR2 (Ser-2809) rabbit monoclonal antibody (1:5000 dilution; Badrilla) and RyR2 mouse polyclonal antibody (1:2500 dilution; Affinity BioReagents; clone 34C). Phospho-RyR2 and total RyR2 antibodies were probed with anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked secondary antibody (1:2500 dilution; Cell Signaling) and anti-mouse IgG, HRP-linked secondary antibody (1:2500 dilution; Cell Signaling), respectively. (iii) PLB phosphorylated by PKA at serine 16 was determined with anti-phospho-PLB (Ser-16) rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:5000 dilution; Upstate) and PLB mouse monoclonal antibody to PLB (1:5000 dilution; Upstate). Phospho-PLB and total-PLB primary antibodies were then probed using the anti-rabbit IgG and anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution; Cell Signaling), respectively. Staining was detected with the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). Antibody-labeled proteins were quantified by densitometry using a Kodak Gel Logic 100 Imaging System. The amount of truncated cTnI was assessed in LV homogenates isolated 7 days after in vivo gene transfer and after isoproterenol infusion. Western blot analysis was performed using anti-TnI-1 monoclonal antibody (1:2000 dilution) (25McConnell B.K. Moravec C.S. Morano I. Bond M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H1440PubMed Google Scholar, 26McConnell B.K. Moravec C.S. Bond M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H385PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-TnI-1 antibody recognizes an epitope at the C terminus of cTnI and, thus, identifies N-terminal cTnI cleavage products (25McConnell B.K. Moravec C.S. Morano I. Bond M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H1440PubMed Google Scholar, 26McConnell B.K. Moravec C.S. Bond M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H385PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were probed using the anti-mouse IgG, alkaline phosphatase-linked secondary antibody (1:3000 dilution; Sigma) and subsequently detected by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate-nitro blue tetrazolium substrate reaction. Non-infected mouse heart control and cloned recombinant mouse cTnI-ND protein (∼21.5 kDa) serve as alignment or molecular weight marker for the expression of the N-terminal cTnI cleavage products on the Western blot. The ratio of truncated cTnI/total cTnI was determined in Ht31 (n = 4)- versus Ht31P (n = 4)-expressing hearts. Western blot analysis of N-terminal deleted cardiac TnI products was carried out using the anti-4H6 monoclonal antibody (25McConnell B.K. Moravec C.S. Morano I. Bond M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H1440PubMed Google Scholar, 26McConnell B.K. Moravec C.S. Bond M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H385PubMed Google Scholar), which recognizes an epitope specific to cTnI and, thus, identifies whether the TnI observed is a re-expression of skeletal muscle TnI isoforms or cardiac TnI cleavage products. Skeletal muscle was obtained from rat extensor digitorum longus muscle (expressing fast skeletal TnI) and rat soleus muscle (expressing slow skeletal TnI). Thus, the anti-4H6 antibody allowed us to determine that the N-terminal cTnI products were cardiac cleavage products and not skeletal isoforms. Morphology and Immunohistochemistry—Seven days after in vivo gene transfer and after functional evaluation in vivo, rats were sacrificed, and hearts were excised, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, and weighed. Cross-sections (5–6 μm) of Cyro-O.C.T. compound (Tissue-Tek)-embedded LV were transferred to glass slides (2Yang J. Drazba J.A. Ferguson D.G. Bond M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 511-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and stained with hematoxylin and eosin or fixed and immunostained with anti-CD45 antibody (1:50; BD Pharmingen clone OX-1) followed by visualization with polyclonal biotin conjugated anti-mouse IgG and Vectastain elite ABC reagent together with the DAB detection system. Rat liver served as a positive control. Sections were also fixed and immunostained with anti-RII antibody (1:500 dilution; Upstate) followed by the secondary Alexa 568 (red) antibody (1:500 dilution; Molecular Probes) or immunostained with fluorescein-conjugated (green) anti-HA antibody (1:500 dilution; Roche clone 12CA5), which recognizes the HA epitope-tagged Ht31 and Ht31P. Hearts infected with adenovirus and probed with secondary antibody (negative control) or hearts not infected with adenovirus and probed with either the fluorescein-conjugated or the secondary Alexa 568 antibodies (negative control) showed background fluorescence only (data not shown). Images were obtained using a TE 2000 Nikon inverted microscope equipped with a 10×, 40×, 60× objective, fluorescent filters, and a Diagnostic Instruments, Inc. SPOT camera (model 7.0.1). Statistical Analysis—All data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined using unpaired Student’s t test to evaluate the null hypothesis. Analysis was also performed using two-way repeated measures analysis of variance to compare means of multiple groups. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Cardiac Morphology and Immunohistochemistry—No significant differences in heart weight-to-body weight ratio (Table 1) or LV mass (Table 2) were observed between hearts expressing Ht31 and control hearts. After gene transfer, there was no evidence of an adverse inflammatory response (infiltration of inflammatory cells, indicated by a lack of anti-CD45 staining) (Fig. 1). Positive staining for anti-CD45 was verified using rat liver (Fig. 1, panel C). There was also no evidence of histological abnormalities (e.g. myocyte hypertrophy or myofibrillar disarray) in experimental hearts (Ht31) versus controls (Fig. 1, panels D–G). The thickness of the intraventricular septum and LV posterior wall was not significantly different (Table 1).TABLE 1Characteristics of Sprague-Dawley rats The echocardiographic parameters interventricular septum (IVS) thickness and posterior wall (PW) thickness were measured under base-line conditions in the absence of isoproterenol stimulation.

Ht31 or Ht31P expression is indicated by green immunolabeling of anti-HA (Fig. 2; panels A, A′, B, and B′). AKAP-Lbc, the parent protein of Ht31 and Ht31P, as well as other AKAPs expressed in the heart are localized to specific and unique subcellular locations (3Ruehr M.L. Russell M.A. Bond M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2004; 37: 653-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In contrast, Ht31 and Ht31P are short soluble 24 amino acid peptides lacking targeting domains and are, thus, free to diffuse throughout the cytoplasm as indicated in Fig. 2, panels panels A, A′, B, and B′. We previously showed co-localization of RII and mAKAP (previously called AKAP100) and co-localization of mAKAP andα-actinin in rat cardiac myocytes, as indicated by periodic cross-striated staining (2Yang J. Drazba J.A. Ferguson D.G. Bond M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 511-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In the current study, 7 days after expression of the control peptide, Ht31P, in vivo RII immunostaining was observed as periodic cross-striated staining (yellow arrows, Fig. 2, panels C and C′), demonstrating that binding of RII to endogenous AKAPs is not altered by introduction of the control Ht31P peptide by gene transfer in vivo. In contrast, 7 days post-infection with the active, RII binding peptide, Ht31, the striated p"

Recently, we found that the NHase of Rhodococcus erythropolis N771 exhibited an additional catalytic activity, converting tert-butylisonitrile (tBuNC) to tert-butylamine. Taking advantage of the slow reactivity of tBuNC and the photoreactivity of nitrosylated NHase, we present the first structural evidence for the catalytic mechanism of NHase with time-resolved x-ray crystallography. By monitoring the reaction with attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, the product from the isonitrile carbon was identified as a CO molecule. Crystals of nitrosylated inactive NHase were soaked with tBuNC. The catalytic reaction was initiated by photo-induced denitrosylation and stopped by flash cooling. tBuNC was first trapped at the hydrophobic pocket above the iron center and then coordinated to the iron ion at 120 min. At 440 min, the electron density of tBuNC was significantly altered, and a new electron density was observed near the isonitrile carbon as well as the sulfenate oxygen of αCys114. These results demonstrate that the substrate was coordinated to the iron and then attacked by a solvent molecule activated by αCys114-SOH.

First, nitriles directly bind to the metal to facilitate the nucleophilic attack of a water molecule on the nitrile carbon. In the other mechanisms, a water molecule activated by the metal directly or indirectly attacks nitriles trapped near the metal. In all cases, the metal is suspected to function as a Lewis acid. By reconstituting iron-type NHase from recombinant unmodified subunits, we demonstrated that the post-translational modifications of its cysteine ligands are essential for its catalytic activity (12Murakami T.

Later, by using a sulfenate-ligated iron complex, they showed that protonation/deprotonation states of the sulfenate oxygen were modulated by the unmodified Cys thiolate ligand (15Lugo-Mas P. Dey A.

(2008). 2008; 94: 3824-3838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), have been applied to the mechanisms described above. However, the detailed mechanism remains unclear because of a lack of direct information on the reaction intermediates.We recently found that an iron-type NHase from Rhodococcus erythropolis N771 (ReNHase) catalyzes the conversion of isonitriles to the corresponding amines (22Taniguchi K. Murata K. Murakami Y. Takahashi S. Nakamura T. Hashimoto K. Koshino K. Dohmae N. Yohda M. Hirose T. Maeda M. Odaka M. J. Bioeng. Biosci. 2008; 106: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Although the other product derived from the isonitrile carbon was not identified, the kinetic analyses revealed that the Km for tBuNC was comparable with that for methacrylonitrile, whereas kcat (1.8 × 10-2 s-1) was 1.8 × 105 times smaller. In this study, taking advantage of the slow reactivity of tBuNC as well as the photoreactivity of nitrosylated inactive ReNHase (3Noguchi T. Hoshino M. Tsujimura M. Odaka M. Inoue Y. Endo I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16777-16781Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 4Odaka M. Fujii K. Hoshino M. Noguchi T. Tsujimura M. Nagashima S. Yohda M. Nagamune T. Inoue Y. Endo I. J. Am. Chem.

Based on the results, we propose a reaction mechanism in which the sulfenate group of αCys114-SO- plays a key role in the catalysis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Nitrile hydratase from R. erythropolis N771 (ReNHase) was inactivated by endogenous NO molecules in living cells in the dark (4Odaka M. Fujii K. Hoshino M. Noguchi T. Tsujimura M. Nagashima S. Yohda M. Nagamune T. Inoue Y. Endo I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 3785-3791Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 23Tsujimura M. Odaka M. Nagashima S. Yohda M. Endo I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). ReNHase was purified in the nitrosylated form in the dark as described previously (23Tsujimura M. Odaka M. Nagashima S. Yohda M. Endo I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The purified nitrosylated ReNHase was stored in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at -80 °C in the dark at a concentration of 20 mg/ml. The concentration of the nitrosylated NHase was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm (ϵ280 = 1.7 ml mg-1 cm-1). tBuNC was purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). All the other reagents used in this study were of the highest grade available.ATR-FTIR Measurements—The nitrosylated ReNHase (70 mg/ml) in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, was loaded on the surface of a three-reflection silicon prism (3 mm in diameter) in the ATR accessory (DuraSamplIR II, Smiths Detection, Danbury, CT) and dried under nitrogen gas flow. Subsequently, 1.5 μl of water (H216O or H218 O) was added to the sample. The sample space was sealed with a CaF2 plate and a greased Teflon spacer (0.7 mm in thickness). The substrate, 0.5 μl of neat tBuNC, was also enclosed in this sealed space as a drop on the CaF2 plate, to be supplied to the ReNHase solution as a vapor. The sample was stabilized at room temperature in the dark for 4 h.FTIR spectra were measured on a Bruker IFS-66/S spectro-photometer equipped with an MCT detector (D313-L). All of the spectra were recorded at 4 cm-1 resolution. A single-beam spectrum was recorded for 100 s before illumination, and ten spectra (100 s scans) were successively recorded after 10 s of illumination by continuous white light from a halogen lamp (Hoya-Schott HL150; ∼60 milliwatt cm-2 at the sample).Light-induced difference spectra were calculated by subtracting the dark spectra from each spectrum after illumination. The base-line distortion was corrected by subtracting the corresponding spectra measured in the same manner but without illumination.For CO detection, 6 μl of hemoglobin (50 mg/ml) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, was lightly dried on a silicon ATR prism, and 6 μl of the nitrosylated ReNHase sample (70 mg/ml) in Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, was placed beside the hemoglobin. The sample space was sealed with a CaF2 plate, on which 0.5 μl of tBuNC was placed, and a greased Teflon spacer (Fig. 1). The ReNHase sample was photoactivated by white light illumination for 1 min. FTIR spectra with 10-s scans were recorded at 0, 20, 30, and 60 min after illumination.Crystallization of ReNHase—Crystals of the nitrosylated ReNHase were grown using the vapor diffusion hanging drop method at 20 °C. Two microliters of the nitrosylated ReNHase (20 mg/ml protein in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) was mixed with an equal amount of the precipitant solution (20% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.10 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.30 m MgCl2) and equilibrated against 0.40 ml of precipitant solution. Crystals with dimensions of approximately 0.4 × 0.3 × 0.3 mm3 grew within a day in the dark at 20 °C. When crystals of the nitrosylated NHase were dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, the enzyme solution exhibited trace amounts of methacrylonitrile hydration activity in the dark, but it had a specific activity of 7.3 × 102 units/mg after light-induced denitrosylation (10,000 l×) with a cold light illumination system (LG-PS2; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) for 15 min.Preparation of the ReNHase Crystals without or with tBuNC—Crystals of the nitrosylated ReNHase were first vapor-soaked with cryoprotectant solution (30% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.10 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.60 m MgCl2) for 1 day by being swapped in mother liquor. They were then vapor-soaked for a day with mother liquor solution containing tBuNC at a final concentration of 0.10 m. After being mounted, ReNHases in the crystals were activated by light-induced denitrosylation (10,000 l×) with a cold light illumination system (LG-PS2; Olympus), and the reaction proceeded for 18, 120, 340, and 440 min at 20 °C. At each elapsed time, the reaction was terminated by flash cooling with N2 gas at 95 K.X-ray Data Collections, Structure Determinations, and Refinements—Diffraction data were collected using a Quantum 315 CCD detector (Area Detector Systems Corporation, Poway, CA) at the beamline BL-5A (λ = 1.000 Å) of the Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan) at 95 K. Each data set was indexed, merged, and scaled with the HKL2000 program suite (24Otowinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38361) Google Scholar). The ReNHase crystals belonged to the C2 space group. One heterodimer of α and β subunits populated the asymmetric unit. Molecular replacement was performed with MOLREP (25Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J.

The obtained models were improved by iterative cycles of crystallographic refinement using REFMAC5 (27Murshudov G.N. Vargin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22799) Google Scholar). The models were cross-validated by the SigmaA-weighted electron density maps (29Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1986; 42: 140-149Crossref Scopus (2035) Google Scholar) calculated with both 2mFobs - DFcalc and mFobs - DFcalc coefficients. The refinements were performed using a maximum likelihood target with bulk solvent corrections. During the structure refinement, ∼5% of the amplitude data were set aside to monitor the progress of refinement using the Rfree factor. Solvent water molecules were gradually introduced if the peaks that were contoured at more than 4.0 σ in the mFobs - DFcalc electron density were in the range of a hydrogen bond. tert-Butyl groups of tBuNC were fit on the resultant difference electron density map by handling, and their coordinate data were then refined using REFMAC5 (27Murshudov G.N. Vargin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13776) Google Scholar). All of the structural figures were generated using PyMol.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIdentification of the Product from the Isonitrile Carbon by ATR-FTIR Measurements—To identify all products except for the amine, the reaction was monitored using ATR-FTIR. tBuNC was added as a vapor to nitrosylated NHase, and the enzyme was activated by light-induced denitrosylation. Several prominent positive peaks, all arising from tert-butylamine (tBuNH2), increased their intensities as the reaction proceeded, whereas no signals from other origins were detected (Fig. 2). Supposing that the other product possessing a carbon atom was CO, which escaped from the solution as a gas, we attempted CO detection by trapping using hemoglobin. Hemoglobin was located on a silicon ATR crystal, and nitrosylated ReNHase solution and tBuNC were separately placed in a sealed space (Fig. 1). A CO molecule-bound hemoglobin was monitored by ATR-FTIR after light activation of ReNHase (Fig. 3). The CO stretching signal of CO-hemoglobin was observed at 1953 cm-1, and its intensity increased with the reaction time. The CO peak appeared at a downshifted frequency of 1908 cm-1 when the ReNHase reaction was performed in an H218O buffer, confirming that CO was produced by the ReNHase-consuming water. Thus, we concluded that ReNHase hydrolyzed tBuNC to produce tBuNH2 and CO (tBuNC + H2O → tBuNH2 + CO).FIGURE 2ATR-FTIR difference spectra showing product formation by the NHase reaction with tBuNC. FTIR spectra of H216O(A) and H218O(B) solutions including NHase and tBuNC were recorded before and 100 (purple), 300 (blue), 500 (cyan), 700 (green), and 900 (red) s after illumination of ReNHase, and difference spectra were calculated relative to before illumination values. C, the spectrum of tBuNH2 in an aqueous solution (in a protonated tBuNH3+ form) after subtraction of water absorption is presented for comparison.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3The CO stretching region of the ATR-FTIR spectra of hemoglobin.

At 18, 120, 340, and 440 min, the reaction was stopped by flash cooling at 95 K, at which point the crystal structure was determined. Details of data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. Unfortunately, we could not collect data from the crystals that were incubated longer because those crystals were damaged. The overall structure at each elapsed time was essentially unchanged except for the pocket above the Fe3+ center (Fig. 4). αCys112-SO2− (αCSD112) and αCys114-SO- (αCSO114) modifications were clearly observed in all of the structures determined.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsNitrosylated NHaseaOne crystal was used to collect the data of each complex.0 minaOne crystal was used to collect the data of each complex.,b“0 min” represents nitrosylated NHase soaked with tBuNC.18 minaOne crystal was used to collect the data of each complex.120 minaOne crystal was used to collect the data of each complex.340 minaOne crystal was used to collect the data of each complex.440 minaOne crystal was used to collect the data of each complex.Data collection Space groupC2C2C2C2C2C2 Cell dimensionsa (Å)114.7114.0114.0114.1113.9114.0b (Å)60.560.060.060.160.260.2c (Å)81.981.781.781.781.481.5α, β, γ (°)125.0125.1125.1125.1125.1125.1 Wavelength (Å)1.000001.000001.000001.000001.000001.00000 Resolution (Å)50.0-1.3050.0-1.4850.0-1.4850.0-1.3950.0-1.5950.0-1.49 Resolution of highest resolution shell (Å)1.35-1.301.53-1.481.53-1.481.44-1.391.65-1.591.54-1.49 Rmerge0.0510.0350.0380.0380.0360.042 Rmerge of highest resolution shell0.2930.1180.1080.2710.2080.216 I/σI24.426.826.124.127.924.4 I/σI of highest resolution shell3.4910.510.83.714.043.97 Completeness (%)98.898.397.098.097.393.8 Completeness of highest resolution shell (%)97.293.693.190.285.375.9 Redundancy3.72.12.01.81.81.9Refinement Resolution (Å)7.96-1.308.00-1.488.00-1.487.98-1.397.99-1.598.00-1.49 No. reflections105,63469,87668,83184,85555,53665,146 Rwork/Rfree16.9/18.716.8/19.416.8/19.017.7/20.115.8/18.515.9/18.3 No. atomsProtein3,2883,2523,2553,2223,1853,185Ligand/ion45551213Water756663643601538545 B-factorsProtein11.713.414.114.511.211.7Ligand/ion18.716.620.929.818.620.4Water28.828.329.120.727.228.6 Root mean square deviationsBond length (Å)0.0070.0080.0080.0070.0090.007Bond angles (°)1.1511.1981.1881.1841.1841.160 Ramachandran plotMost favored (%)98.598.098.298.598.298.2 Additionally allowed region (%)1.52.01.81.51.81.8a One crystal was used to collect the data of each complex.b “0 min” represents nitrosylated NHase soaked with tBuNC.

The Fe-N(NO) distance is 0.6 Å longer than observed in the previous structure (Protein Data Bank code 2ahj) (7Nagashima S. Nakasako M. Dohmae N. Tsujimura M. Takio K. Odaka M. Yohda M. Kamiya N. Endo I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). In the previous structure, the NO was likely to be pushed toward Fe3+ by 1,4-dioxane, the co-precipitant used (7Nagashima S. Nakasako M. Dohmae N. Tsujimura M. Takio K. Odaka M. Yohda M. Kamiya N. Endo I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). After soaking with tBuNC, the electron density of tBuNC was clearly observed in the pocket (Fig. 4B) with the tert-butyl group facing the NO molecule coordinated to the Fe3+. Because of the limited space in the hydrophobic pocket, the bulky tert-butyl group must face the iron in its nitrosylated state. In addition to the original conformation (conformer A), Sγ of βMet40 took another conformation (conformer B) with occupancies of A:B = 0.25:0.75. Movement of Sγ of βMet40 to conformer B is likely due to the occupation of the hydrophobic pocket by tBuNC. We hypothesize that conformer B is less stable because of steric hindrance between Sγ and the amide oxygen of βMet40 (Fig. 5).FIGURE 5The steric hindrance at Sγ of βMet40 caused by tBuNC.

Sγ of βMet40 remained disordered, but the occupancy of conformer A increased to 0.55. At 120 min, the NO disappeared, and a tBuNC molecule was coordinated to Fe3+ with an Fe-C(-NC) length of 2.1 Å (Fig. 4D). βMet40 took conformer A again. The rotation of the tBuNC molecule could be driven by the recovery of βMet40 to conformer A.The Fo - Fc electron density at 340 (supplemental Fig. S1) and 440 min (Fig. 4E) were very similar to one another but distinct from those observed at 120 min. In both structures, the Fo - Fc electron density corresponding to the tert-butyl group was moved ∼1.0 Å away from the iron, and an extra electron density was observed near the isonitrile carbon as well as the sulfenate oxygen of αCys114. When the products, tBuNH2 and CO, were included in the calculation of the electron density at 440 min, the refined model of tBuNH2 was well fit on the 2Fo - Fc electron density, but that of CO was not (supplemental Fig. S2). In addition, two positive electron densities were observed near the CO molecule in the Fo - Fc electron density. Alternatively, we calculated the electron density at 440 min by assuming the presence of only tBuNH2. As shown in Fig. 4F, tBuNH2 was well fit on the 2Fo - Fc electron density, and two positive electron densities were observed above the iron ion and near Oδ of the sulfenate group, in the Fo - Fc electron density. We assigned the positive densities as the carbon of the isonitrile group and the solvent water molecule (named as H2Oa), respectively (Fig. 4F). All distances of Fe-C(-NC), C(-NC)-N(-NC), C(-NC)-O(H2Oa), N(-NC)-O(H2Oa), and O(H2Oa)-O(-SO) converged at less than 2.2 Å (Table 2). The O(H2Oa)-O(-SO) distance cannot be explained. These atoms may be disordered because the occupancies of H2Oa and Oδ of αCys114-SO- converged on 0.50. Interestingly, a positive difference density was observed below Sγ of αCys114-SO- in the 2Fo - Fc electron density map after coordination of tBuNC (Fig. 4, D-F). The distance between the density and Sγ of αCys114-SO- is 1.4 Å, and the angle Oδ(αCys114-SO-) - Sγ(αCys114-SO-) - the density was 133°. The positive density may represent an alternative position of Oδ of αCys114-SO-.TABLE 2Selected bond lengths for the complex of nitrosylated NHase with tBuNC after light irradiation for 440 minBond lengthsÅFe-C(-NC)2.1C(-NC)-N(-NC)1.4C(-NC)-O(H2Oa)2.3N(-NC)-O(H2Oa)1.8O(SO)-O(H2Oa)1.6 Open table in a new tab Proposed Catalytic Mechanisms of NHase—Based on the results, we propose the following catalytic mechanism: the tBuNC substrate binds the metal directly,"

Life Sci. 2006; 63: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). eEFSec and Sec-tRNASec do not suppress UGA termination codons, indicating that SBP2 and the SECIS work in concert to provide specificity for the appropriate UGA (Sec) codons. eEFSec and SBP2 have been shown to interact in what may be a Sec-tRNASec-dependent fashion by co-immunoprecipitation from transfected cells (2.Tujebajeva R.M.

Interestingly, this interaction is not detectable in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (4.Zavacki A.M. Mansell J.B. Chung M. Klimovitsky B. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. Mol Cell. 2003; 11: 773-781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), despite this system being fully competent for Sec incorporation (5.Mehta A. Rebsch C.M. Kinzy S.A. Fletcher J.E. Copeland P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37852-37859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This apparent discrepancy remains unresolved.Mammalian SBP2 has been ascribed three functions: 1) Sec incorporation, 2) SECIS binding, and 3) ribosome binding (6.Copeland P.R. Stepanik V.A. Driscoll D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1491-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Amino acids (aa) 1-398 (rat numbering is used throughout) are dispensable for Sec incorporation in vitro, whereas the C-terminal half of SBP2 (CT-SBP2; aa 399-846) comprises the minimum fully functional protein (7.Copeland P.R. Fletcher J.E. Carlson B.A. Hatfield D.L. Driscoll D.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 306-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Indeed, all eukaryotes more “primitive” than echinoderms lack the N-terminal domain of SBP2. 3J. Donovan and P. R. Copeland, unpublished data.3J. Donovan and P. R. Copeland, unpublished data. In addition, truncation analysis provided evidence that CT-SBP2 is comprised of an N-terminal “functional domain” (aa 399-516) and a C-terminal RNA-binding domain (aa 517-777). In terms of ribosome binding, both regions were shown to be required (6.Copeland P.R. Stepanik V.A. Driscoll D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1491-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).The SBP2 RNA-binding domain (RBD) contains an L7Ae RNA-binding domain that mediates SECIS interactions (6.Copeland P.R. Stepanik V.A. Driscoll D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1491-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 8.Allmang C. Carbon P. Krol A.

Two lines of evidence suggest that the SBP2 RBD is also important for ribosome binding. First, inclusion of SECIS elements in ribosome binding assays inhibits SBP2-ribosome interaction, suggesting that SBP2 may bind a kink-turn motif in the rRNA (10.Caban K. Kinzy S.A. Copeland P.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 6350-6360Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 11.Kinzy S.A. Caban K. Copeland P.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 5172-5180Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Further, mutations in the conserved core region of the L7Ae RBD eliminate ribosome binding (10.Caban K. Kinzy S.A. Copeland P.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 6350-6360Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Mutation of residues 647RFQDR651 upstream of the core L7Ae domain impaired ribosome binding and Sec incorporation but not SECIS binding. Because most mutations in the RBD impair SECIS or both SECIS and ribosome binding, the 647RFQDR651 mutation provided the first evidence that SBP2 ribosome binding may be essential for Sec incorporation (10.Caban K. Kinzy S.A. Copeland P.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 6350-6360Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). There were mutations, however, that resulted in ribosome binding defects without compromising Sec incorporation activity (i.e. 673VLKHL677), suggesting that the SBP2-ribosome interaction does not conform to a simple one-site model. Interestingly, the ribosomal protein L30, which also contains an L7Ae RNA-binding motif, has been reported to compete with SBP2 for SECIS element binding in vitro and stimulate Sec incorporation in transfected cells, but whether it is required for Sec incorporation remains unknown (12.Chavatte L. Brown B.A. Driscoll D.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 408-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar).In contrast to the RNA-binding domain, little is known of the SBP2 functional domain (hereafter referred to as the Sec incorporation domain (SID)). Structure/function studies of SBP2 showed that a truncation mutant comprised of residues 459-846 had reduced Sec incorporation activity but no loss in SECIS binding (6.Copeland P.R. Stepanik V.A. Driscoll D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1491-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Deletion of residues 399-516 from CT-SBP2 ablated Sec incorporation, did not affect SECIS binding, but resulted in a significant decrease in ribosome binding as assayed by gradient centrifugation (6.Copeland P.R. Stepanik V.A. Driscoll D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1491-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), suggesting that residues within the SID are also required for ribosome binding, thus adding further complexity to the SBP2-ribosome interaction.In this study, we sought to identify critical residues within the SBP2 SID using homology-driven scanning mutagenesis. This allowed us to identify two SID regions important for Sec incorporation: one contributing solely to Sec incorporation and another required for all three SBP2 functions. We also show that the SID and RBD, when expressed as separate proteins, are able to provide wild-type levels of Sec incorporation in vitro, thus indicating that these regions are independently folding domains. Together these data allowed us to redefine the domain boundaries of the SID (aa 399-535) and RBD (aa 615-777). SECIS binding studies indicated that the SID functions, in part, by modulating SECIS affinity. Further, in a novel interaction assay, we show that the RBD forms a stable complex with eEFSec.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstructs—Penta-alanine mutant constructs were made by site-directed mutagenesis using the coding region corresponding to the C-terminal half of rat SBP2 (aa 399-846) in pCR3.1 (Invitrogen; for in vitro translated protein) or pTrcHis (Invitrogen; for recombinant protein) as a template. Constructs for N-terminally Xpress-His (XH)-tagged recombinant proteins were generated by TOPO-TA cloning the coding regions for rat CT-SBP2, the SID (aa 399-585) and the RBD (aa 586-856) in pTrcHis. N-terminally FLAG-tagged rat RBD and mouse eEFSec were made by TOPO-TA cloning their respective coding regions with forward primers encoding a FLAG tag into pTrcHis2. All of the constructs were completely sequenced by automated DNA sequencing.Recombinant Proteins—All of the recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21. All of the XH-tagged proteins were purified as described by Kinzy et al. (11.Kinzy S.A. Caban K. Copeland P.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 5172-5180Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) except the purified protein was changed into PBSD (1× PBS + 2 mm DTT) by dialysis at 4 °C. Growth conditions and overexpression for FLAG-RBD were the same as for XH-tagged proteins. Bacteria were lysed by sonication in buffer A (1× PBS + 1% Tween with the final NaCl concentration adjusted to 500 mm). FLAG-RBD was affinity purified on a column packed with M2 α-FLAG resin (Sigma). The column was pre-equilibrated in buffer A, and a sample was loaded with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. After the sample was loaded, the column was washed with 15 column volumes of buffer A and then equilibrated in 1× PBS. FLAG-RBD was eluted with 3 column volumes of 100 μg/ml 3× FLAG peptide (Sigma) in PBS and collected in 1-ml fractions at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions containing FLAG-RBD were brought to 2 mm DTT FLAG-eEFSec was purified as described for FLAG-RBD, except bacteria were lysed in eEFSec buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 20 mm KCl, 25% glycerol) containing 500 mm NaCl and eluted in eEFSec buffer containing 100 μg/ml 3× FLAG peptide.In Vitro Translation—Plasmids encoding wild-type CT-SBP2 or penta-alanine mutants in pCR3.1 were linearized with XhoI and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase using the mMessage kit (Applied Biosystems). mRNAs were translated in nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL; Promega) in the presence of [35S]Met as directed by the manufacturer. Protein quantitation was performed by PhosphorImager analysis as described previously (10.Caban K. Kinzy S.A. Copeland P.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 6350-6360Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).Sec Incorporation Assay—Sec incorporation assays with in vitro translated protein were performed by adding 2 μl of in vitro translated CT-SBP2 to a luciferase reporter translation as described (10.Caban K. Kinzy S.A. Copeland P.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 6350-6360Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Sec incorporation assays with recombinant protein were 12.5-μl reactions containing 50 ng of luciferase reporter mRNA and the appropriate amount of 1.5 μm or 0.1 μm recombinant protein to achieve the concentrations indicated in the figures. All of the Sec incorporation reactions were incubated for 1 h at 30° and processed as previously described (10.Caban K. Kinzy S.A. Copeland P.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 6350-6360Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).Sucrose Cushion Assay—Ribosome purification and ribosome binding of in vitro translated proteins was assayed as described (10.Caban K. Kinzy S.A. Copeland P.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 6350-6360Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, in vitro translated proteins were incubated with 4 pmol of salt-washed rat testes ribosomes in 1× PBS containing an additional 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 40 mm NaCl. Eighty percent of this reaction was layered onto a 20% sucrose cushion containing the same salt concentrations plus 2 mm DTT and spun at 300,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. Five percent of supernatant and pellet fractions was resolved by SDS-PAGE and quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis.SECIS Probes and EMSA—32P-Labeled wild-type and mutant GPX4 SECIS elements were transcribed as described (10.Caban K. Kinzy S.A. Copeland P.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 6350-6360Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). SECIS binding of in vitro translated proteins was assayed by incubating equal saturating amounts (16 fmol) with 20 fmol of wild-type or mutant (ΔAUGA) SECIS probes in 1× PBS supplemented with 250 μg/ml yeast tRNA (Sigma), 10 mm DTT, and 5 μg of soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). Quantitation was performed with ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare) by calculating the percentage of shifted probe with local average background correction and then subtracting the amount of nonspecific shifting observed in the presence of RRL only. These values were then normalized to wild-type CT-SBP2. EMSAs with recombinant proteins contained 2-fold serial dilution series from 8 to 0.125 μm of the indicated proteins (see Fig. 6) in PBSD and adding 1 μl of each dilution to a reaction mixture as described for the in vitro translated proteins. Final reaction volumes were 20 μl. EMSA reactions were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, resolved on 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels, and visualized by PhosphorImaging. EMSA reactions using eEFSec were performed as described above except reactions were carried out in eEFSec buffer. eEF1A was a generous gift of T. G. Kinzy (Robert Wood Johnson Medical School).Co-immunoprecipitation—32P-Trace-labeled wild-type and ΔAUGA GPX4 SECIS elements used the same template as for EMSA SECIS elements but were transcribed with the T7 Ribomax kit (Promega) supplemented with 1 μl of 3000 Ci/mmol [α-32P]UTP. SECIS elements were phenol:chloroform-extracted, ethanol-precipitated twice, resuspended in water, and quantitated by UV spectrophotometry. Equimolar amounts (40 pmol) of XH-tagged SID, FLAG-RBD, and SECIS elements as indicated in Fig. 5 were mixed in a final volume of 60 μl of PBSD and incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. Following incubation, all of the reactions were diluted with 120 μl of PBS + 1 mm DTT and 40 μl of a 50% slurry of M2 α-FLAG beads (Sigma) in the same buffer and mixed for 1 h at 4 °C. Supernatants (50%) from SECIS-containing reactions were phenol:chloroform-extracted, precipitated, resolved on a 6 m urea 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, and visualized by PhosphorImaging. The pellets were washed four times with 1 ml PBS + 0.5% Tween. After the final wash all liquid was removed with a needle, and bound proteins were eluted in 30 μl of 1× SDS sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue). Prior to boiling the samples for SDS-PAGE, 1 μl from SECIS containing reactions was used for liquid scintillation counting. Amounts equal to 7.5% of the supernatants and 50% of the pellets were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting against SBP2.FIGURE 5The SECIS element promotes formation of a stable SID-RBD complex. Wild-type or penta-alanine mutant recombinant XH-SID (SID) was incubated with equimolar amounts of FLAG-RBD and 32P-trace-labeled wild-type (wt) or mutant (mt) SECIS elements. The proteins in the supernatant (top panel) and pellet (middle panel) fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blot using an anti-SBP2 antibody. Fifty percent of the supernatants from SECIS containing reactions were removed, and RNA was extracted, precipitated, and resolved on a 6% denaturing gel (bottom panel). Lanes 4 and 5 of the bottom panel show the starting RNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Formaldehyde Cross-linking—Messenger RNAs encoding CT-SBP2, SID, or RBD were in vitro translated in a 12.5-μl RRL reaction in the presence of [35S]Met as described above. After 30 min of translation at 30 °C, 1.4 μl of 2.5% formaldehyde (diluted in water) was added to the reactions followed by incubation at 30 °C for 10 min. The reactions were then supplemented with 14 μl of 4% SDS, 100 mm Tris, pH 6.8, and layered over a 178-μl cushion containing 20% sucrose, 2% SDS, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, followed by a 30-min spin at 300,000 × g at 18 °C in a Sorvall M20 ultracentrifuge. The supernatants were removed, and the pellets were resuspended in 1× SDS sample buffer. The pellet fraction (20%) and the supernatant fraction (5%) were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the radioactive proteins were detected by PhosphorImaging. Band quantitation was performed using ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare).RESULTSThe Sec Incorporation Domain Possesses Two Regions Critical for Sec Insertion—To identify the critical determinants within the rat SBP2 SID, we utilized a conservation-based approach to identify potentially important residues. Within blocks of high conservation, groups of five consecutive amino acids were changed to alanine in a CT-SBP2 background (hereafter referred to as penta-alanine mutations). The mutated residues are indicated in a multiple sequence alignment shown in Fig. 1. In vitro translated, [35S]Met-labeled penta-alanine mutant proteins (Fig. 2A) were added to the Sec incorporation assay that measures the SECIS-dependent translation of luciferase mRNA containing an in-frame UGA codon and GPX4 SECIS element in the 3′-untranslated region (5.Mehta A. Rebsch C.M. Kinzy S.A. Fletcher J.E. Copeland P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37852-37859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Sec incorporation activity was normalized first to the amount of mutant protein added and then to the amount of activity obtained with wild-type CT-SBP2. Although most of the mutant proteins retained significant levels of Sec incorporation activity, five of the fourteen penta-alanine mutations resulted in Sec incorporation defects below 20% of wild-type CT-SBP2 (Fig. 2B). These included 443LGGML447 in the N-terminal portion of the SID, which resulted in a reduction of Sec incorporation activity to ∼18% of wild-type CT-SBP2. In the C-terminal portion, 504PLMKK508, 511QREIP515, 521TSLKK525, and 526IILKE530 had Sec incorporation activities of 5, 12.5, 4.5, and 16%, respectively. These results indicate that only a small subset of the conserved residues within the SBP2 SID are required for Sec incorporation activity and that the important residues lie mainly in the C-terminal region of this domain between residues 504 and 530.FIGURE 1Alignment of the CT-SBP2 sequences. Alignment of human (Hs), rat (Rn), and chicken (Gg) SBP2 and the human SBP2 paralogue, SBP2-like protein (Hs SLP) is shown. Residues mutated to alanine in groups of five (boxed) are indicated above the alignment.

Stepanik V.A. Driscoll D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1491-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To determine the extent to which SECIS binding defects could account for the loss of Sec incorporation activity observed in Fig. 2, we screened CT-SBP2 mutants for defects in SECIS binding by incubating 16 pmol of in vitro translated wild-type or mutant proteins with 32P-labeled GPX4 SECIS elements and complexes resolved by EMSA. Although this method generated complexes that were more difficult to quantitate than those from recombinant proteins, it allowed us to rapidly screen the mutants for severe defects in SECIS binding and then perform detailed analysis of interesting mutants as recombinant proteins. None of the mutants N-terminal to 516KAKKP520 displayed a significant SECIS binding defect (Fig. 3A). At the C-terminal end of the SID, mutations 516KAKPP520, 521TSLKK525, and 526IILKE530 resulted in a nearly complete loss of detectable SECIS binding activity relative to wild-type CT-SBP2 (Fig. 3, A and C). None of the CT-SBP2 mutants were able to bind a mutant SECIS element in which the AUGA core motif is deleted (data not shown). These data show a clear correlation between SECIS binding and Sec incorporation for the residues downstream of Pro515. Interestingly, however, the nearly complete loss of Sec incorporation activity for the 504PLMKK508 and 511QREIP515 mutant proteins cannot be attributed to a concomitant loss in SECIS element binding.FIGURE 3Analysis of SECIS and ribosome binding for penta-alanine mutants. A, 16 fmol of [35S]Met labeled in vitro translated wild-type or mutant CT-SBP2, as indicated, was incubated with 32P-labeled wild-type GPX4 SECIS elements and resolved on 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (the last four mutants were evaluated in a separate experiment). B, [35S]Met-labeled in vitro translated CT-SBP2 was assayed for ribosome binding by pelleting complexes through a 20% sucrose cushion. Five percent of supernatants (S) and pellets (P) were resolved by SDS-PAGE (top panel) and visualized by PhosphorImaging. To control for nonspecific binding, the amount of pelleting observed for hnRNP F was subtracted and data were normalized to CT-SBP2. C, summary of Sec incorporation (black bars), ribosome binding (light gray bars), and SECIS binding (dark gray bars) data for the penta-alanine mutants expressed as the amount of each activity relative to that obtained with wild-type CT-SBP2 (means ± S.E., n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)SID Regions Affecting Sec Incorporation Activity and SECIS Binding Also Affect Ribosome Binding—To explore the potential role of ribosome binding defects in causing Sec incorporation defects in the penta-alanine mutant proteins, we analyzed their ability to bind ribosomes in a sucrose cushion assay where [35S]Met-labeled wild-type or mutant CT-SPB2 was incubated with excess salt-washed rat testis ribosomes, and protein-ribosome complexes were resolved by ultracentrifugation through a sucrose cushion. Supernatant and pellet fractions (5% of each) were resolved by SDS-PAGE. After normalizing to wild-type CT-SBP2 and subtracting the amount of pelleting observed with a nonspecific RNA-binding protein (hnRNP F), the mutants 516KAKKP520, 521TSLKK525, and 526IILKE530 showed 5, 0, and 0% pelleting relative to wild type, respectively (Fig. 3, B and C). These data establish a strong correlation between SECIS element binding and ribosome binding, but the mutations upstream of 516KAKKP520 do not allow a clear correlation to be made between Sec incorporation activity, SECIS element binding, and ribosome binding. A summary of these three parameters for all of the penta-alanine mutations is shown in Fig. 3C. Interestingly, 511QREIP515, which is greatly impaired for Sec incorporation but not SECIS binding, retained ∼87% ribosome binding activity. Similarly, 504PLMKK508 retained over 60% ribosome binding activity, retained wild-type levels of SECIS element binding, but displayed a loss of over 90% of its Sec incorporation activity. In addition, 478KDASS482, 485RGRRS489, and 495PHNPL499, all had wild-type levels of SECIS binding and 80% ribosome binding but showed a decreasing trend in Sec incorporation. Further, mutants such as 473VPVLS447 had wild-type SECIS and ribosome binding but showed only 44% Sec incorporation. The mutation at 443LGGML447 was unique in that it displayed slightly higher than wild-type levels of ribosome binding and slightly lower levels of SECIS binding, resulting in an ∼80% decrease in Sec incorporation activity. Together the analysis of these mutant proteins confirms the tight correlation between SECIS element binding and Sec incorporation activity and establishes the role of amino acids 504-515 in promoting Sec incorporation without contributing substantively to SECIS element binding or ribosome binding.The SID and RBD Are Independently Folding Domains—Having identified residues within the SID that are required for Sec incorporation but not SECIS and ribosome binding, we hypothesized that the primary function of the SID is distinct from any of the known biochemical activities of SBP2. In addition, two lines of evidence suggest that the SID and RBD may form independent domains. First, the sequence alignments clearly show two regions of conservation with a ∼70-amino acid spacer. Second, the RBD contains the entirety of a conserved L7Ae domain, which has been shown to bind SECIS RNA in the absence of the SID (6.Copeland P.R. Stepanik V.A. Driscoll D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1491-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To address this question directly, we subcloned the SID and RBD and expressed them as individual recombinant proteins with an N-terminal Xpress-His tag (XH-SID, aa 399-585; XH-RBD, aa 586-846) and tested their ability promote Sec incorporation in trans. We tested limiting (8 nm) or saturating (120 nm) amounts of either domain alone in rabbit reticulocyte lysate using the luciferase reporter described above. Individual domains were inactive (Fig. 4A, compare columns 2-5 with column 1). When combined, however, the domains were able to support Sec incorporation to 14% at 8 nm (versus 9% for limiting CT-SBP2) and 86% at 120 nm. To determine whether one of the domains could act as a transient activator of the other, we mixed limiting and saturating amounts of the SID and RBD in the Sec incorporation assay. When saturating levels of the SID were mixed with limiting amounts of RBD, Sec incorporation activity was ∼30%. Similarly, when saturating levels of the RBD are mixed with limiting amounts of SID, Sec incorporation activity was 36%. Thus, when compared with the 14% activity obtained when both domains were limiting, a ∼2-fold enhancement was observed particularly in the case when the RBD was saturating. We next sought to determine whether a similar enhancement could be obtained when saturating amounts of the each domain were mixed with a limiting amount of CT-SBP2. In this case, the RBD, but not the SID, was able to enhance the activity of limiting CT-SBP2 from 9% to 21% (Fig. 4A, column 12), suggesting that steric hindrance within the complete CT-SBP2 molecule prevents enhancement of Sec incorporation by the SID in trans (Fig. 4A, column 11). This finding allowed us to predict that two molecules of CT-SBP2, each lacking function in either the SID or RBD because of mutation, would be unable to promote Sec incorporation. To test this hypothesis, we combined 120 nm each of recombinant CT-SBP2 bearing a G669R mutation in the RBD together with CT-SBP2 bearing the 504PLMKK508 pentaalanine mutation. The G669R mutation has previously been shown to prevent SECIS element binding as well as Sec"

In this study, we have characterized the requirement for CCS in activating SOD1 from Drosophila. A CCS-null mutant (Ccsn29E) of Drosophila was created and found to phenotypically resemble Drosophila SOD1-null mutants in terms of reduced adult life span, hypersensitivity to oxidative stress, and loss of cytosolic aconitase activity. However, the phenotypes of CCS-null flies were less severe, consistent with some CCS-independent activation of Drosophila SOD1 (dSOD1). Yet SOD1 activity was not detectable in Ccsn29E flies, due largely to a striking loss of SOD1 protein. In contrast, human SOD1 expressed in CCS-null flies is robustly active and rescues the deficits in adult life span and sensitivity to oxidative stress. The dependence of dSOD1 on CCS was also observed in a yeast expression system where the dSOD1 polypeptide exhibited unusual instability in CCS-null (ccs1Δ) yeast. The residual dSOD1 polypeptide in ccs1Δ yeast was nevertheless active, consistent with CCS-independent activation. Stability of dSOD1 in ccs1Δ cells was readily restored by expression of either yeast or Drosophila CCS, and this required copper insertion into the enzyme. The yeast expression system also revealed some species specificity for CCS. Yeast SOD1 exhibits preference for yeast CCS over Drosophila CCS, whereas dSOD1 is fully activated with either CCS molecule. Such variation in mechanisms of copper activation of SOD1 could reflect evolutionary responses to unique oxygen and/or copper environments faced by divergent species.

The yeast expression system also revealed some species specificity for CCS. Yeast SOD1 exhibits preference for yeast CCS over Drosophila CCS, whereas dSOD1 is fully activated with either CCS molecule. Such variation in mechanisms of copper activation of SOD1 could reflect evolutionary responses to unique oxygen and/or copper environments faced by divergent species.

The cell must strictly limit concentrations of free copper, while simultaneously ensuring efficient delivery of copper to the SOD1 apoprotein. Copper is inserted into the SOD1 apoprotein by a specific chaperone, the copper chaperone for SOD1 (CCS). Initially identified in yeast as the protein product of the LYS7 gene (1Culotta V.C.

Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase Mn superoxide dismutase cytoplasmic aconitase copper chaperone for Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase Drosophila SOD1 Drosophila CCS human SOD1 mitochondrial aconitase tetramethylethylenediamine yeast CCS 6-hydroxydopamine CCS is composed of three separate protein domains that function in concert to activate SOD1 with copper (see Fig. 1B). At the N terminus of CCS, domain I resembles the ATX1 family of copper chaperones that harbor the well conserved CXXC Cu(I)-binding motif. The central domain II of CCS has significant homology to SOD1 and is important for forming a CCS-SOD1 heterodimer-docked complex as a prerequisite to copper transfer. Finally the C-terminal domain III contains a critical CXC copper-binding site that inserts copper and oxidizes the intramolecular disulfide in SOD1 (3Culotta V.C. Yang M. O'Halloran T.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 747-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 4Schmidt P.J. Rae T.D. Pufahl R.A. Hamma T. Strain J. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol.

Nersissian A.M. Valentine J.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5413-5421Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), although the role of domain I cysteines in SOD1 activation in vivo is uncertain. In addition to CCS, SOD1 can be activated by a so-called CCS-independent pathway that is currently of unknown nature but requires reduced GSH (7Carroll M.C. Girouard J.B. Ulloa J.L. Subramaniam J.R. Wong P.C. Valentine J.S. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5964-5969Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The mode of copper activation (CCS versus CCS-independent) can vary among different organisms. For example, the SOD1 of bakers' yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is totally dependent on CCS for activation, whereas that of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans only acquires copper through the CCS-independent pathway (8Jensen L.T. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41373-41379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In fact, C. elegans lacks an obvious CCS-encoding gene. Mammals express a CCS that is homologous to that of yeast, but mammalian SOD1 can acquire copper by either pathway (7Carroll M.C. Girouard J.B. Ulloa J.L. Subramaniam J.R. Wong P.C. Valentine J.S.

CCS-encoding genes have been identified in a wide array of metazoans, yet the biology of CCS from nonmammalian metazoans has not been investigated. The invertebrate, Drosophila melanogaster, has provided an ideal organism in which to explore the role of SOD1 in development, survival, and aging. Mutant Drosophila lacking SOD1 survive well as embryos and larvae but experience high rates of mortality as late pupae and early adults. Surviving adults exhibit a median life span about 10! of normal, severely reduced fertility, hypersensitivity to a variety of oxidative stress conditions (10Phillips J.P. Campbell S.D. Michaud D. Charbonneau M. Hilliker A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2761-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), retinal degeneration (11Phillips J.P. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D.

Genome. 2004; 47: 1029-1035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The high rate of early mortality in SOD1-null mutants is related to a general pattern of premature aging as reflected by the precocious onset and rapid progression of patterns of marker gene expression that typify normal senescence (13Rogina B. Helfand S.L. Biogerontology. 2000; 1: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Clearly, SOD1 plays a critical role in the biology and life history of Drosophila, but the biochemistry of the maturation process for this critical enzyme has not been explored. Here we describe a single CCS-encoding gene from Drosophila and the biological and biochemical consequences of losing the copper chaperone for SOD1. Drosophila Stocks, Culture Conditions—The Sod1n108 and ry+5 strains are described in Ref, 10Phillips J.P. Campbell S.D. Michaud D. Charbonneau M. Hilliker A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Dickinson D. Hilliker A.J. Phillips J.P. Boulianne G.L. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Stocks were maintained at 25 °C on standard cornmeal and agar medium unless otherwise stated. The copper chaperone coding region was amplified by PCR (primers CCS5 + CCS7) using DNA extracted from a Drosophila Canton S adult cDNA library (Stratagene catalog number 936603). The 930-bp PCR product was blunt-ended and subcloned into the SmaI site of pBluescriptIISK (Stratagene) to generate the vector pBCC. The transformation vector pUCC was constructed by subcloning the EcoRI-NotI fragment of pBCC into pUAST (15Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development (Camb.). 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Cells were propagated at 30 °C either in enriched yeast extract, peptone-based medium supplemented with 2! glucose (YPD), or in synthetic complete (SC) medium (19Sherman F. Fink G.R. Lawrence C.W. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1978Google Scholar). Solid medium was supplemented with 15 mg/liter ergosterol and 0.5! Tween 80 to enhance growth in anaerobic conditions. Yeast expression plasmids for dSOD1 and dCCS were produced using cDNA clone RE52090 (Open Biosystems) for dSOD1 and plasmid pUCC for dCCS. The coding sequences for dSOD1 and dCCS were PCR0-amplified introducing 5′ BglII and 3′ SnaBI sites in dSOD1 and 5′ MluI and 3′ RsrII sites in dCCS. The dSOD1 PCR product was digested with the appropriate enzymes and ligated into pLS108 (18Sturtz L.A. Diekert K. Jensen L.T. Lill R. Culotta V.C. J. Biol.

The digested dCCS PCR product was inserted into pLJ366 (a derivative of pLS113 (18Sturtz L.A. Diekert K. Jensen L.T. Lill R. Culotta V.C. J. Biol.

Both dSOD1 and dCCS were under control of their corresponding S. cerevisiae regulatory sequences. The sequence integrity of these plasmids was ensured by double-stranded DNA sequencing (DNA Analysis Facility, The Johns Hopkins University). Yeast CCS1 plasmids pHAL-413, pLS008 (C229S, C231S), and pLS010 (K136E, G137E) have been described previously (18Sturtz L.A. Diekert K. Jensen L.T. Lill R. Culotta V.C. J. Biol.

Domain I mutation in yCCS1 (C17S, C20S) was introduced using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using pHAL-413 as a template (4Schmidt P.J. Rae T.D. Pufahl R.A. Hamma T. Strain J.

SOD1 In-gel Activity Assay—To analyze SOD1 activity from Drosophila, five males were homogenized in 50 μl of 1! Triton X-100. 10 μl of supernatant was transferred to a tube containing an equal volume of loading buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20! glycerol, 0.01! bromphenol blue). 20 μl was run on a 10! polyacrylamide (4! stacking) gel. The gel was incubated in nitro blue tetrazolium (2 mg/ml) for 5 min followed by incubation in 36 mm K2HPO4, 0.035 mm riboflavin, 0.3! TEMED for 7 min and then washed several times in H2O as described (20Beauchamp C.O. Fridovich I. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 44: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (10014) Google Scholar). SOD enzymatic activity was assayed from yeast grown shaking in selected SC medium to an A600 of 1.5. Yeast lysates were generated by glass bead homogenization in a buffer containing 0.6 m sorbitol, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, and protease inhibitors. Analysis of SOD activity by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis using 12! pre-cast gel (Invitrogen) and staining with nitro blue tetrazolium was performed as described previously (21Flohe L. Otting F. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar) except that 10 mm EDTA was added to the native running buffer. SOD1 Spectrophotometric Assay—24–48-h-old males were homogenized in B1 (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA). The supernatant was extracted twice with chloroform (0.15 V), ethanol (0.25 V) with a 15-min incubation time for each extraction. SOD1 activity was determined spectrophotometrically by monitoring the autooxidation of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-HD) at 490 nm at 37 °C in 500 μl of B1 containing 0.1 mm 6-HD (22Heikkila R.E. Cabbat F. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 75: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Aconitase Activity Assay—30 adult males were homogenized in 120 μl of extraction buffer (0.6 mm MnCl2, 2 mm citric acid, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and centrifuged at 13,000 × g. Samples were electrophoresed on Sepraphore III membranes (Pall Corp.). Aconitase was detected by incubation of the membrane in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, 1 mm NADPH, 2 mm cis-aconitic acid, 1.2 mm 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, 0.3 mm phenazine methosulfate, 25 mm MgCl2, and 5 units/ml isocitrate dehydrogenase (23Gardner P.R.

The extracts were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was transferred to a tube containing an equal volume of loading buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 4! SDS, 10! mercaptoethanol, 20! glycerol, 0.01! bromphenol blue). Samples were boiled for 5 min, and 10 μg of total protein was separated on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel (4! stacking, 15! separating). The protein was transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (ECL) and probed with sheep anti-human Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (Cedarlane catalog number K9007C) and rabbit anti-sheep IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Chemicon catalog number AP147P). The ECL Western blotting detection reagents (RPN 2109, Amersham Biosciences) was used for detection. Immunoblot analysis of Cu,Zn-SOD expressed in yeast was carried out with cell lysates prepared as described above and a polyclonal antibody that displays strong reactivity with Cu,Zn-SODs from several species (JH765) at a 1:5000 dilution (8Jensen L.T. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41373-41379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Detection utilized an Alexa Fluor 680 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Invitrogen), and immunoblots were visualized using the Odyssey infrared imagining system (Licor Biosciences). Drosophila Life Span Determination—0–24-h-old males were collected, 25 males per vial, and kept on cornmeal food containing tegosept. 200 males of each line were used. The vials were kept at 25 °C. Flies were transferred to fresh food every 2–3 days. Drosophila Paraquat Resistance—0–24-h-old males were collected and kept on cornmeal food for 24 h, 10 males in each vial. They were then transferred to vials containing 3-mm paper filter disks saturated with 250 μl of 1! sucrose, 1! sucrose containing 2 mm paraquat (Sigma) or 1! sucrose and 5 mm paraquat. The vials were stored at 25 °C in the dark, and flies were enumerated after 24 h as originally described (10Phillips J.P. Campbell S.D. Michaud D. Charbonneau M. Hilliker A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2761-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). dCcs, the Copper Chaperone of SOD1 Gene of Drosophila—The Drosophila genomic homologue of yeast and mammalian Ccs was initially identified by isolation of a SOD1-like sequence from a Drosophila genomic library, later verified by sequence annotation in Flybase (CG17753, FBgn0010531, and confirmed by amplification of a Ccs cDNA from a D. melanogaster cDNA library (Fig. 1A). The architecture of the native Drosophila gene includes a 795-bp coding sequence interrupted by two small introns of 51 and 61 bp, respectively. The nearest open reading frame (CG11867) is ∼5 kb upstream from the 5′-transcription start site. The encoded sequence contains the expected region of high homology to SOD1 (2Field L.S. Luk E. Culotta V.C. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2002; 34: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) in the central domain II of CCS; the domain III CXC is conserved. Unexpectedly, the domain I CXXC copper-binding motif is absent (Fig. 1B). A comparison to all known CCS-like molecules in the data base revealed that the absence of a CXXC motif in Drosophila CCS is unique. Of 20 CCS sequences analyzed from fungi to humans, only D. melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae lack the MXCXXC copper-binding site (Table 1). However, all 20 CCS molecules retain the CXC copper site in domain III.TABLE 1Drosophila CCS lacks domain 1 MTCXXC Ccs Deletion Mutation—A loss of function mutation of Ccs (Ccsn29E), generated by an apparent imprecise excision of a P element located near Ccs in the autosomal enhancer-detector parent strain, H340 (25Boynton S. Tully T. Genetics. 1993; 131: 655-672Crossref Google Scholar), was identified by recovery of a strain, 29E, with reduced SOD1 activity and a set of phenotypes exhibited by known SOD1 deficiency mutants (see below). Sequence analysis of Ccs, restriction analysis by Southern hybridization, and SOD1 activity all indicated that Ccs is functionally and structurally intact in H340. The genomic deletion in Ccsn29E includes 1617 bp of 5′-upstream region and 1907 bp downstream from the transcription start site, including all of the first exon, the first intron, and 124 bp of the second exon (Fig. 1A). Ccs transcripts are relatively rare throughout normal development in H340 and are undetectable by Northern blot analysis in 29E (data not shown). Loss of SOD1 Enzymatic Activity in CCS-null Flies—Because the only known assay for CCS function is via its role in the activation of SOD1, we assayed SOD1 activity in extracts of H340 and 29E using two functionally different methods, the in-gel with nitro blue tetrazolium reduction interference assay and the spectrophotometric 6-hydroxydopamine reduction interference assay (Fig. 2, A and B). Using both methods, we were unable to detect significant SOD1 activity in 29E. Loss of CCS in 29E appears to have no effect on the activity of the mitochondrial manganese-containing SOD2 (see Fig. 4A). These results by themselves would suggest that CCS in Drosophila, as in yeast and mammals, is specifically required for activating SOD1.FIGURE 4Expression of hSOD1 in CCS-null Drosophila. A, hSOD1 expressed in Drosophila is enzymatically active in the absence of CCS. In-gel activity assay of SOD used extracts of young adult males. hSOD1 was expressed in Ccs+/+ and Ccs–/– flies using the GAL4/UAS system. Genotypes (by lane) are as follows: lane 1, Ccs+/Ccs+; dSod1+/dSod1+, daGAL4G32; lane 2, Ccs–/Ccs–; dSod1+/dSod1+; lane 3, Ccs–/Ccs–; dSod1+/dSod1+; daGAL4G32; lane 4, Ccs+/Ccs+, UAS-hSod1; dSod1+/dSod1+; lane 5, Ccs–/Ccs–, UAS-hSod1; dSod1+/dSod1+; lane 6, Ccs+/Ccs+, UAS-hSod1; dSod1+/dSod1+, daGAL4G32; lane 7, Ccs–/Ccs–, UAS-hSod1; dSod1+/dSod1+, daGAL4G32. The UAS-hSod1 transgene is on recombinant 2nd chromosomes carrying Ccs+ or Ccs–. Ccs– = Ccsn29E. B, human SOD1 rescues flies deficient in CCS. Genotypes are as follows: Ccs+/+,Ccs+/Ccs+; dSod1+/dSod1+, daGAL4G32. Ccs+/–, Ccs+/Ccsn29E; dSod1+/dSod+, daGAL4G32. Ccs–/–, Ccsn29E/Ccsn29E; dSod1+/dSod1+, daGAL4G32. Ccs+/–, hSod1(a), Ccs+/Ccsn29E, UAS-hSod1(a); dSod1+/dSod+, daGAL4G32. Ccs–/–, hSod1(a), Ccsn29E/Ccsn29E, UAS-hSod1(a); dSod1+/dSod1+, daGAL4G32. Ccs+/–, hSod1(b): Ccs+/Ccsn29E, UAS-hSod1(b); dSod1+/dSod1+, daGAL4G32. Ccs–/–, hSod1(b): Ccsn29E/Ccsn29E, UAS-hSod1(b); dSod1+/dSod1+, daGAL4G32. Note that all strains are homozygous for dSod1+ and hemizygous for daGAL4G32, the latter of which is known to impose a mild dominant reduction of adult life span (compare with Fig. 3A). hSod1(a), hSod1(b) are independently selected recombinant 2nd chromosomes carrying both Ccsn29E and UAS-hSod1. Note that hSOD1 appears to super-rescue in the absence of CCS.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) However, analysis of SOD1 protein levels revealed that the steady state level of SOD1 polypeptide in 29E is reduced to about one-quarter of its normal level in H340 (Fig. 2C). Thus, the loss of SOD1 activity in 29E probably arises primarily from the reduced level of SOD1 protein in the absence of CCS. Further analysis confirmed that the lack of SOD1 activity in 29E is not because of a mutation in the Sod1 gene. 4The possibility remained that the lack of SOD1 activity in the Ccs deletion strain, 29E, was actually caused by a cryptic loss-of-function mutation in the Sod1 gene itself. We tested this possibility by examining the SOD1 dimeric isoforms present in hybrids generated by crossing 29E to a strain bearing Sod1s, a mutant allele that encodes an electrophoretically slow but enzymatically active variant of SOD1. The capacity of the Sod1 gene in 29E to produce a functionally active SOD1 apoprotein can be diagnosed by the presence of a novel SOD1F/SOD1S dimeric protein in the 29E/Sod1S hybrid. The data in supplemental Fig. S1, showing the presence of an enzymatically active SOD1F/SOD1S hybrid, provides conclusive evidence that the lack of SOD1 activity in 29E is not because of a mutation in the Sod1 gene. We are therefore able to conclude with confidence that the lack of SOD1 activity and SOD1 protein in 29E is the indirect consequence of the loss of CCS and not because of a loss-of-function mutation in the Sod1 gene. Deficiency of CCS Reduces the Functional Level of Specific Iron-Sulfur Protein Sentinels—The cytosolic and mitochondrial aconitases both contain cubane [4Fe-4S] centers that are sensitive targets of inactivation by superoxide (23Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19328-19333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Gardner P.R. Nguyen D.-D. White C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12248-12252Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Steady state levels of these activities in Drosophila are significantly reduced in the absence of SOD1 and SOD2, respectively (24Missirlis F. Hu J. Kirby K. Hilliker A.J. Rouault T.A. Phillips J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47365-47369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Assay of cACON and mACON activities in 29E shows that cACON activity is selectively depleted by about 50! (H340 ∼1.6 × 29E), with no detectable affect on the activity of mACON (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these data indicate that at the biochemical level, the absence of dCCS is equivalent to a deficiency in SOD1. The important question then arises, does this parallel extend to whole organism phenotypes? Genetic Ablation of CCS Elicits Broad Phenotypic Consequences—At a minimum, the mutational loss of CCS should generate a set of phenotypes predicted by the loss of SOD1, including reduced adult life span with little or no overt effect on pre-adult development and hypersensitivity to applied oxidative stress. Both of these expected phenotypes are realized. Fig. 3A shows that the absence of CCS confers early onset adult mortality with an ∼30! reduction in the median adult life span. In contrast, 29E displays the extreme toxic hypersensitivity to the redox cycling agent, paraquat, exhibited by SOD1-null (Fig. 3B). In these respects, 29E appears to phenocopy a weakly expressing SOD1 hypomorphic mutant. Based on previous studies with RNA interference-mediated knockdown of SOD1 (27Hu J. Transgene-mediated RNAi and Reverse Genetic Analysis of the Aging-related Gene, Sod1, in Drosophila melanogaster Ph.D. thesis. University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada2004Google Scholar), and transgenic rescue of SOD1-null mutants (28Parkes T.L. Kirby K. Phillips J.P. Hilliker A.J. Genome. 1998; 41: 642-651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which show that paraquat toxicity is a more sensitive indicator of SOD1 deficiency than life span, the phenotype of 29E is consistent with the presence in 29E of a very small residual level of SOD1 activity which, although below the level of detection by conventional assays of whole-fly extracts, is sufficient to extend median adult life span (∼30 days) beyond the 10-day median life span of SOD1-null mutants. Such activity, if it were to occur, would have to arise via CCS-independent activation of apo-SOD1 (see below). Human SOD1 Is Active in CCS-null Drosophila and Restores Their Adult Life Span—In earlier work (14Parkes T.L. Elia A.J. Dickinson D. Hilliker A.J. Phillips J.P. Boulianne G.L. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar), we described the functional expression of human SOD1 (hSOD1) in Drosophila in a Ccs+ genetic background. Since then, the CCS-independent activation of hSOD1 has been described (7Carroll M.C. Girouard J.B. Ulloa J.L. Subramaniam J.R. Wong P.C. Valentine J.S. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5964-5969Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 9Corson L.B. Strain J.J. Culotta V.C. Cleveland D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6361-6366Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Here we investigated the activation of hSOD1 in flies in the absence of functional dCCS. As would be expected from this SOD1 capable of CCS independent activation, hSOD1 is quite active in CCS-null flies (Fig. 4A). Moreover, hSOD1 functions biologically to rescue the early mortality and reduced median life span of CCS-null flies (Fig. 4B). These results demonstrate the presence in Drosophila of a CCS-independent pathway capable of robust activation of heterologous hSOD1 while giving only weak activation of homologous dSOD1. CCS-independent Activation of Drosophila SOD1 Revealed in Yeast Expression System—Based on amino acid sequence alone, dSOD1 is predicted to acquire copper independently of CCS. Studies with yeast, human, and C. elegans SOD1 have identified a pair of prolines near the C terminus that can prohibit CCS-independent activation (7Carroll M.C. Girouard J.B. Ulloa J.L. Subramaniam J.R. Wong P.C. Valentine J.S. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5964-5969Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 8Jensen L.T. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41373-41379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Yeast SOD1 naturally contains these prolines and is incapable of CCS-independent activation, whereas mammalian and C. elegans SOD1 with nonproline residues at these positions can be activated independently of CCS. Drosophila SOD1 also lacks these prolines (Fig. 5A) leading us to predict that dSOD1 should not exhibit dependence on CCS for activity. And although from the phenotype of dCCS-nulls we inferred the presence of a residual level of SOD1 activity, the instability of dSOD1 in the absence of CCS obscures any measurable CCS-independent activation of dSOD1 that might occur in the Drosophila model."
https://openalex.org/W2092880998,"Previous studies have shown that glycolysis can oscillate periodically, driven by feedback loops in regulation of key glycolytic enzymes by free ADP and other metabolites. Here we show both theoretically and experimentally in cardiac myocytes that when the capacity of oxidative phosphorylation and the creatine kinase system to buffer the cellular ATP/ADP ratio is suppressed, glycolysis can cause large scale periodic oscillations in cellular ATP levels (0.02–0.067 Hz), monitored from glibenclamide-sensitive changes in action potential duration or intracellular free Mg2+. Action potential duration oscillations originate primarily from glycolysis, since they 1) occur in the presence of cyanide or rotenone, 2) are suppressed by iodoacetate, 3) are accompanied by at most very small mitochondrial membrane potential oscillations, and 4) exhibit an anti-phase relationship to NADH fluorescence. By uncoupling energy supply-demand balance, glycolytic oscillations may promote injury and electrophysiological heterogeneity during acute metabolic stresses, such as acute myocardial ischemia in which both oxidative phosphorylation and creatine kinase activity are inhibited."
https://openalex.org/W2019573595,"Circadian clocks regulate multiple rhythms in mammalian tissues. In most organs core clock gene expression is oscillatory, with negative components Per and Cry peaking in antiphase to Bmal1. A notable exception is the testis, where clock genes seem nonrhythmic. Earlier mammalian studies, however, did not examine clock expression patterns in accessory ductal tissue required for sperm maturation and transport. Previous studies in insects demonstrated control of sperm maturation in vas deferens by a local circadian system. Sperm ducts express clock genes and display circadian pH changes controlled by vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPase and carbonic anhydrase (CA-II). It is unknown whether sperm-processing rhythms are conserved beyond insects. To address this question in mice housed in a light-dark environment, we examined temporal patterns of mPer1 and Bmal1 gene expression and protein abundance in epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, and prostate. Results demonstrate variable tissue-specific patterns of expression of the two genes, with variations in levels of clock proteins and their nucleo-cytoplasmic cycling observed among examined tissues. Strikingly, mPer1 and Bmal1 mRNA and proteins oscillate in antiphase in the prostate, with similar peak-trough patterns as observed in the suprachiasmatic nuclei, the brain's central clock. Genes encoding CA and a V-ATPase subunit, which are rhythmically expressed in sperm ducts of moths, are also rhythmic in some segments of murine sperm ducts. Our data suggest that some sperm duct segments may contain peripheral circadian systems whereas others may express clock genes in a pleiotropic manner."
https://openalex.org/W2079611240,"Membrane-bound sialidase NEU3, often referred to as the “ganglioside sialidase,” has a critical regulatory function on the sialoglycosphingolipid pattern of the cell membrane, with an anti-apoptotic function, especially in cancer cells. Although other sialidases have been shown to be involved in skeletal muscle differentiation, the role of NEU3 had yet to be disclosed. Herein we report that NEU3 plays a key role in skeletal muscle differentiation by strictly modulating the ganglioside content of adjacent cells, with special regard to GM3. Induced down-regulation of NEU3 in murine C2C12 myoblasts, even when partial, totally inhibits their capability to differentiate by increasing the GM3 level above a critical point, which causes epidermal growth factor receptor inhibition (and ultimately its down-regulation) and an higher responsiveness of myoblasts to the apoptotic stimuli.

Skeletal muscle differentiation is a multistep process in which myoblasts, upon exit from the cell cycle, differentiate into myocytes and eventually fuse into multinucleated myotubes (1Walsh K. Perlman H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 597-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 2Yun K. Wold B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 877-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Muscle cell commitment to differentiation is strictly regulated by a group of transcription factors, referred to as the myogenic regulatory factors (3Berkes C.A. Tapscott S.J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 16: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 4Smith II, C.K. Janney M.J. Allen R.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 159: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). During differentiation, a profound remodeling of both cell plasma membrane and cytoskeleton takes place, which ultimately leads to the formation of multinucleated syncytia (myotubes) (5Formigli L. Meacci E. Zecchi-Orlandini S. Orlandini G.E. Eur. J. Histochem. 2007; 51: 21-28PubMed Google Scholar). These events have also been shown to be associated with modifications of the cell surface lipid composition, with a key role being played particularly by sialylated glycolipids (gangliosides) (6Barondes S.H. Cooper D.N. Gitt M.A. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20807-20810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Leskawa K.C. Erwin R.E. Buse P.E. Hogan E.L. Mol. Cell.

Along this line, sialidases (9Monti E. Preti A. Venerando B. Borsani G. Neurochem. Res. 2002; 27: 649-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), the enzymes that specifically remove sialic acid from sialylated glycoconjugates, have been shown to participate in the regulation of the myogenic event (10Sato K. Miyagi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 826-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 11Fanzani A. Giuliani R. Colombo F. Zizioli D. Presta M. Preti A. Marchesini S.

Cell Res. 2005; 311: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These findings further corroborate the evidence that sialidases, and their sialylated substrates, are fundamental in many physiological processes and that their de-regulation may lead to different pathologies, including cancer (13Miyagi T. Wada T. Yamaguchi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1780: 532-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 14Miyagi T. Wada T. Yamaguchi K. Hata K. Glycoconj.

Mammals possess four different sialidases (NEU1, NEU2, NEU3, NEU4) with different subcellular localization and substrate specificity, suggesting that each of them may possess a characteristic role. Actually, the cytosolic sialidase NEU2 and the lysosomal sialidase NEU1 seem to have different functions in skeletal muscle differentiation. In fact, the cytosolic sialidase gradually increases during muscle differentiation (10Sato K. Miyagi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 826-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and an induced down-regulation of the enzyme completely inhibits muscle differentiation, suggesting that NEU2 exerts its activity by desialylating key glycoconjugates involved in the process. On the other hand, lysosomal sialidase NEU1 shows an increase of both enzyme expression and activity only during the first stages of muscle differentiation, followed by their decrease, suggesting a possible regulatory role of NEU1 in the early stages of myogenesis (12Champigny M.J. Perry R. Rudnicki M. Igdoura S.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 311: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Moreover, the NEU1 promoter was proven to be highly up-regulated by MyoD and repressed by activated MEK 3The abbreviation used are: MEKmitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinaseEGFepidermal growth factorEGFRepidermal growth factor receptorMHCmajor histocompatibility complexRT-PCRreverse transcription-PCRPPMP1-phenyl-2-palmitoyl-3-morpholino-1-propanolGFPgreen fluorescent proteinshRNAsmall hairpin RNAHPTLChigh pressure thin layer chromatography 3The abbreviation used are: MEKmitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinaseEGFepidermal growth factorEGFRepidermal growth factor receptorMHCmajor histocompatibility complexRT-PCRreverse transcription-PCRPPMP1-phenyl-2-palmitoyl-3-morpholino-1-propanolGFPgreen fluorescent proteinshRNAsmall hairpin RNAHPTLChigh pressure thin layer chromatography kinase, further supporting NEU1 strong association with the differentiation process (12Champigny M.J. Perry R. Rudnicki M. Igdoura S.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 311: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, no data are available on a possible involvement of the plasma membrane-bound sialidase NEU3 (17Miyagi T. Wada T. Iwamatsu A. Hata K. Yoshikawa Y. Tokuyama S. Sawada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5004-5011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 18Zanchetti G. Colombi P. Manzoni M. Anastasia L. Caimi L. Borsani G. Venerando B. Tettamanti G. Preti A. Monti E. Bresciani R. Biochem. J. 2007; 408: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) in muscle differentiation. Nevertheless, the NEU3 role seems quite plausible, as the enzyme has a critical regulatory function on the sialoglycosphingolipid pattern of the cell plasma membrane (19Hakomori S. Handa K. Iwabuchi K. Yamamura S. Prinetti A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: xi-xixCrossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). For instance, NEU3 of COS-7 cells is able to modify the sialoglycosphingolipid pattern of adjacent cells (20Papini N. Anastasia L. Tringali C. Croci G. Bresciani R. Yamaguchi K. Miyagi T. Preti A. Prinetti A. Prioni S. Sonnino S. Tettamanti G. Venerando B. Monti E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16989-16995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), supporting its involvement in cell-cell interactions (see Fig. 1A). On these bases, we decided to investigate the effects of NEU3 on muscle differentiation by constitutively silencing NEU3 with small hairpin RNA (shRNA) using murine C2C12 myoblasts as the cell model. Our results show that (a) the induced down-regulation of the enzyme in murine C2C12 myoblasts completely inhibited their ability to enter the differentiation process; (b) upon induction of differentiation or when grown to confluence, NEU3-silenced myoblasts underwent a massive apoptotic cell death; (c) NEU3 silencing caused epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibition and down-regulation because of the increased levels of endogenous ganglioside GM3; (d) supplementation of GM3 in the culture medium of wild-type C2C12 strongly reduced their differentiation capability; and (e) NEU3-silenced myoblasts, when co-cultured with wild-type C2C12 cells, re-acquired the capability to differentiate and fused to form major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-expressing myotubes. mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase epidermal growth factor epidermal growth factor receptor major histocompatibility complex reverse transcription-PCR 1-phenyl-2-palmitoyl-3-morpholino-1-propanol green fluorescent protein small hairpin RNA high pressure thin layer chromatography mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase epidermal growth factor epidermal growth factor receptor major histocompatibility complex reverse transcription-PCR 1-phenyl-2-palmitoyl-3-morpholino-1-propanol green fluorescent protein small hairpin RNA high pressure thin layer chromatography Cell Cultures and Stable Silencing of NEU3 in C2C12 Myoblasts—Mouse C2C12 myoblasts (from American Type Culture Collection) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (proliferation medium). Muscle differentiation was induced when cells were at 70–80% confluence by replacing 10% fetal bovine serum with 2% horse serum in the culture medium (differentiation medium). All cell culture reagents were purchased from Sigma. Silencing of NEU3 in C2C12 cells was achieved by designing a short hairpin targeting the mouse NEU3 gene sequence 894–914 (5′-GCACCATGGCAAGTTCATTGA-3′), whereas the shRNA scrambled sequence used was 5′-GGATGATCACCGTAGTAGTAACCT-3′ (GenBank™ accession no. NM_016720) with the Block-iT RNA iDesigner Software (Invitrogen). Viral particles were formed by transfecting 3 μg of pLenti4/BLOCK-iT-shNEU3 vector and 9 μg of packaging vector mix (Invitrogen) in 293FT cells by Lipofectamine™ 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). After 48 h, the culture medium was collected and used to infect proliferating C2C12 cells (multiplicity of infection of 5) according to the manufacturer's procedure. Infected clones were isolated after selection with Zeocin (600 μg/ml). NEU3-silenced cells were named “iNEU3” cells, whereas control cells transduced with the scrambled sequence were named “SCR.” Metabolic Labeling of Cell Sphingolipids—[3-3H]Sphingosine (19.8 Ci/mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) dissolved in ethanol was transferred into a glass sterile tube and dried under a nitrogen stream; the residue was then dissolved in an appropriate volume of pre-warmed (37 °C) Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal bovine serum to obtain a final concentration of 0.25 μCi/100-mm dish (corresponding to 2.53 × 10-9 m). After a 2-h incubation (pulse), the medium was removed, and cells were incubated for 44 h with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal bovine serum not containing radioactive sphingosine (chase). At the end of the chase, cells were washed and harvested in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline by scraping. The cell suspensions were frozen and lyophilized. Extraction and Analysis of Radioactive Lipids—Total lipids from lyophilized cells were extracted twice with 20:10:1 (v/v) chloroform/methanol/water. Lipid extracts, dried under a nitrogen stream, were dissolved in 2:1 (v/v) chloroform/methanol and subjected to a two-phase partitioning 20% (v/v) water. The aqueous and organic phases obtained were counted for radioactivity, and the contained [3H]sphingolipids were analyzed by high performance thin layer chromatography (Kieselgel 60, 20 × 10 cm, Merck GmbH), the solvent system 55:20:3 (v/v) chloroform/methanol/water and 60:40:9 (v/v) chloroform/methanol/aqueous CaCl2 (0.2%) for the organic and aqueous phases, respectively (20Papini N. Anastasia L. Tringali C. Croci G. Bresciani R. Yamaguchi K. Miyagi T. Preti A. Prinetti A. Prioni S. Sonnino S. Tettamanti G. Venerando B. Monti E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16989-16995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Radioactive lipids were visualized with a Beta-Imager 2000 (Biospace) and identified by comparison with radiolabeled standards. The radioactivity associated with individual lipids was determined with the specific β-Vision software (Biospace). EGFR Phosphorylation—C2C12 and iNEU3 cells in proliferation and grown to confluence were starved overnight in serum-free medium and then stimulated for 15 min with 100 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Sigma). After stimulation, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline two times and then lysed for 15 min at 4 °C in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min, and supernatants were collected and assayed for protein concentration with Coomassie Protein Assay (Pierce). Samples were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-EGFR (Tyr1148) (Calbiochem). Gene expression, cell morphology, growth curve, proliferation and sialidase activity assays, immunofluorescences, Hoechst 33342 staining, caspase-3 activation, DNA laddering, treatment of C2C12 cells with GM3, treatment of iNEU3 cells with 1-phenyl-2-palmitoyl-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PPMP), Western blot analyses, and co-culture experiments of C2C12 and GFP-iNEU3 myoblasts are described in the supplemental “Experimental Procedures.” Silencing of NEU3 Sialidase in C2C12 Cells—C2C12 cells were transduced with a lentiviral vector engineered with a shRNA targeting the coding region of NEU3. Zeocin-resistant clones were expanded and tested to evaluate the ability of the designed shRNA to specifically inhibit NEU3 gene translation. For this purpose, cells were cultured at subconfluence levels in normal growth medium, and NEU3 expression levels were assayed by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and real-time PCR. Among eight different clones tested (Supplemental Fig. 1A), clone “4-4,” which from now on will be referred to as “iNEU3,” showed the lowest sialidase expression levels analyzed by real-time PCR and quantified as about 40% of that observed in normal proliferating C2C12 cells or in C2C12 cells transduced with a scrambled shRNA sequence (Fig. 1, B and C, and Supplemental Fig. S1). It is noteworthy that we could not detect any significant difference in the expression levels of the lysosomal sialidase NEU1, whereas sialidase NEU2 and NEU4 mRNAs were undetectable (data not shown) in both wild-type C2C12 and iNEU3 clones, as expected (10Sato K. Miyagi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 826-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 11Fanzani A. Giuliani R. Colombo F. Zizioli D. Presta M. Preti A. Marchesini S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 547: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Successively, NEU3 activity was determined on the artificial substrate 4′-MU-NeuAc, displaying a 3-fold decrease compared with proliferating wild-type C2C12 cells (Fig. 1E). Effects of NEU3 Silencing on C2C12—iNEU3 myoblasts revealed no significant macroscopic morphological differences compared with normal C2C12 cells (Fig. 1, F and G), but they showed a reduced proliferation rate, as confirmed by cell count (Fig. 1D) and tetrazolium hydroxide test (60% reduction, 48 h after plating) (data not shown). Successively, iNEU3 and control C2C12 cells were cultured to 75–80% confluence in growth medium and then cultured in differentiation medium (containing 2% horse serum). Upon differentiation stimulus, control C2C12 cells gradually fused to form multinucleated myotubes (Fig. 1H), as expected (4Smith II, C.K. Janney M.J. Allen R.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 159: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), whereas iNEU3 cells did not fuse, as essentially no myotube could be detected in the culture plate, whereas a substantial cell death occurred as soon as 1 day after the differentiation stimulus (Fig. 1I). At the end of differentiation, control C2C12 cells showed a 7-fold increase in sialidase expression by real-time PCR (Fig. 1C) and a 10-fold increase in enzymatic activity toward 4′-MU-Neu5Ac (Fig. 1E) compared with proliferating myoblasts. Instead, iNEU3 myoblasts showed low sialidase expression and activity (Fig. 1, C and E), comparable with those observed for proliferating myoblasts. Moreover, all myotubes originated from control C2C12 cells stained positive for differentiation markers MYOG and MHC (Fig. 2A, left panels), whereas iNEU3 cells remained mononucleated and did not stain at all for MYOG nor MHC (right panels). These results were confirmed by RT-PCR and real-time PCR, revealing an increasing expression of MYOG and MHC during differentiation in control C2C12 cells, whereas barely detectable levels of MYOG and MHC were found in iNEU3 cells (Fig. 2, B–D). Evaluation of Apoptosis after Induction of Muscle Differentiation—C2C12 and iNEU3 myoblasts were cultured to confluence and stained with Hoechst 33342 dye. The results indicated the presence of DNA condensation and fragmentation only in iNEU3 cells (Fig. 3A). This result was also supported by DNA laddering, which was only observed in iNEU3 cells grown to confluence or when they were induced to differentiate (Fig. 3D). Analogous results were obtained when subconfluent cultures (70–80%) of iNEU3 myoblasts were induced to differentiate. Western blot analysis with an antibody specific for the 17-kDa caspase-3 active fragment revealed high levels of the protein only in iNEU3 cells 24 and 48 h after differentiation induction, whereas only low amounts of the same fragment could be detected in control C2C12 cells (Fig. 3B). Caspase-Glo 3/7 luminescence assay in control C2C12 showed the occurrence of an activation of caspase-3/7 at the beginning of differentiation (first 2 days), followed by its decrease later on (Fig. 3C). Instead, iNEU3 cells showed a steady and continuous caspase-3/7 increase during the differentiation process (Fig. 3C). Ganglioside Pattern Modifications after NEU3 Silencing and GM3 Effects on EGFR—The glycosphingolipid profile of both control and iNEU3 myoblasts was determined by administration of [3-3H]sphingosine, which led to an extensive and stable labeling of the sphingolipids namely gangliosides, neutral glycosphingolipids, sphingomyelin, and ceramide, at steady-state conditions (20Papini N. Anastasia L. Tringali C. Croci G. Bresciani R. Yamaguchi K. Miyagi T. Preti A. Prinetti A. Prioni S. Sonnino S. Tettamanti G. Venerando B. Monti E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16989-16995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The ganglioside pattern analysis showed a 7–8-fold increase of GM3 absolute concentration, becoming 95% of total gangliosides, whereas no significant variation could be detected for the other major gangliosides, as shown in Fig. 4 (A and B). Conversely, no statistically significant differences were observed between the radioactive organic phase sphingolipid patterns of iNEU3 and C2C12 cells (data not shown). Exposure to EGF promoted a higher EGFR phosphorylation in wild-type C2C12 myoblasts compared with iNEU3 cells, as determined by Western blotting with phospho-EGFR-specific antibody (Fig. 4C). Surprisingly, Western blot analysis revealed that NEU3 silencing caused a marked decrease of total EGFR expression (Fig. 4D), which became almost undetectable in the membrane fraction. Moreover, barely detectable levels of EGFR mRNA could be found in iNEU3 cells by RT-PCR and real-time PCR (Fig. 4, E and F). As GM3 is known to inhibit EGFR activation (21Bremer E.G. Schlessinger J. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2434-2440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), wild-type C2C12 cells were preincubated for 24 h with 100 μm GM3 and then induced to differentiate for 7 days. At the end of the differentiation treatment, only a few myotubes could be detected in the culture plate, compared with control C2C12 cells without GM3 (Fig. 5, A and B), accompanied by low MHC expression levels, suggesting that GM3 is involved in the inhibition of C2C12 cells differentiation (Fig. 5C). Moreover, inhibition of ganglioside synthesis in iNEU3 cells with PPMP, a potent inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase, accompanied by concurrent stimulation of EGFR with EGF, partially restored their capability to undergo the differentiation process, as several MHC-expressing myotubes could be detected after 7 days in differentiation medium (Fig. 5D). Instead, in the same iNEU3 cells, PPMP treatment or EGF stimulation alone gave unsuccessful results (data not shown). NEU3-silenced Myoblast Differentiation by Co-culture with Wild-type C2C12 Cells—Initial attempts to induce iNEU3 cells differentiation with a pre-conditioned differentiation medium (obtained from cultures of wild-type C2C12 cells at the end of the differentiation treatment) were unsuccessful. Moreover, indirect co-cultures of iNEU3 and wild-type C2C12 myoblasts with a Transwell system, which would have had the advantage of allowing soluble molecules released by C2C12 cells to quickly reach and stimulate iNEU3 myoblasts to differentiate, were also uneffective. Finally, direct co-culture of iNEU3 cells and wild-type C2C12 cells was performed to verify if direct cell contact with C2C12 cells (expressing normal levels of NEU3) would induce iNEU3 cells to differentiate. To this end, iNEU3 cells were stably transfected with pEGFP-N1 vector (GFP-iNEU3) to discriminate them from wild-type C2C12 cells. The selected clone “EL2,” which expressed the highest levels of GFP, could not be induced to differentiate under normal differentiation conditions. On the other hand, when GFP-iNEU3 cells were directly co-cultured with C2C12 cells (Fig. 5E) and induced to differentiate, the formation of GFP- and MHC-positive myotubes was observed (Fig. 5F), supporting the co-differentiation of both GFP-iNEU3 and wild-type C2C12 cells. MHC-expressing myotubes that did not stain for GFP (Fig. 5F, single white arrowhead) were found in the culture plate, ruling out the possibility of an aspecific GFP staining. Moreover, few GFP-positive cells that did not stain for MHC (Fig. 5F, double white arrowhead) could also be detected, indicating that most, but not all, iNEU3 cells were induced to differentiate by co-culture with differentiating wild-type C2C12 cells. Moreover, few mononucleated GFP-iNEU3 myoblasts that stained positive for MHC (Fig. 5G) could also be detected, indicating that iNEU3 cells differentiated to myocytes before fusing into multinucleated myotubes. Mammalian sialidases have been shown to be implicated in many physiological processes, including skeletal muscle differentiation. Although some studies described the involvement of the lysosomal sialidase NEU1 (12Champigny M.J. Perry R. Rudnicki M. Igdoura S.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 311: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and the cytosolic sialidase NEU2 (10Sato K. Miyagi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 547: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) in the differentiation process, the role of the “ganglioside sialidase” NEU3, if any, had yet to be disclosed. The key role played in apoptosis suppression, especially in cancer cells, has been clearly demonstrated (22Wada T. Hata K. Yamaguchi K. Shiozaki K. Koseki K. Moriya S. Miyagi T. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 2483-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 23Ueno S. Saito S. Wada T. Yamaguchi K. Satoh M. Arai Y. Miyagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7756-7764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Actually, it is known that apoptosis has connections with cell differentiation (24Fernando P.

For instance, caspase-3 activation has been shown to be critically related to the differentiation of myoblasts (25Fernando P. Kelly J.F. Balazsi K. Slack R.S. Megeney L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Brain Res. 2005; 160: 130-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), suggesting the notion that the caspase apoptotic pathway regulates not only cell death but also cell differentiation. However, it is still a standing question what causes differentiation versus death phenotype, as caspases seem to target the same substrates in both processes. One possibility is that timing and intensity of the signal may be crucial to discriminate the two outcomes (24Fernando P. Megeney L.A. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 8-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 31Kuranaga E. Miura M. Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 135-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In this context, the observed increase of membrane sialidase activity, occurring in L6 myoblasts during differentiation (10Sato K. Miyagi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 826-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), was the stimulus to investigate in more details the involvement of NEU3 and its physiological substrate ganglioside GM3, in myoblast transition from proliferation to differentiation. To this purpose, the murine myoblast cell line C2C12, with normal expression of NEU3, was chosen for this study and compared with partially, but stably NEU3-silenced C2C12 clones the use of shRNA targeting the coding region of NEU3. Remarkably, control C2C12 cells gradually fused to form multinucleated myotubes, a clear sign of differentiation (Fig. 1H), whereas iNEU3 myoblasts not only failed to exhibit myotube formation, but extensively died (Fig. 1I). These results are consistent with the notion that a well defined “level” of NEU3 activity is required for C2C12 to enter the differentiation process and that NEU3 silencing elicits a massive process of cell death by apoptosis. Finally, efforts were made to investigate the possible molecular mechanism that underlies the effects of NEU3 down-regulation. Because NEU3 possesses a high specificity toward gangliosides, we compared the glycosphingolipid profile of iNEU3 myoblasts and wild-type C2C12 cells by steady-state metabolic labeling with [3-3H]sphingosine. Remarkably, in iNEU3 myoblasts, ganglioside GM3 underwent a 7–8-fold increase of absolute concentration, covering about 95% of the total gangliosides, possibly as the result of a biosynthetic flux not counterbalanced by adequate depletion. Thus, we hypothesized that the high levels of this ganglioside could be the basis of the new observed phenotype. Following the studies by Hakomori and coworkers (21Bremer E.G. Schlessinger J.

Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), showing that GM3 specifically inhibits activation of EGFR, which is known to play a central role in cell growth control (35Ciardiello F. Tortora G. N. Engl. J. Med. 2008; 358: 1160-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar), we verified the effects of NEU3 silencing on the functional state of EGFR. Previous studies have shown that GM3 affects EGFR activity through a direct interaction that requires receptor glycosylation, providing a hypothetical model of carbohydrate-carbohydrate interaction between EGFR and gangliosides in what is considered the “ganglioside signaling domain” (34Wang X.Q. Sun P. O'Gorman M. Tai T. Paller A.S. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In our experiments, we not only observed a marked decrease of the active, phosphorylated form of EGFR in iNEU3 myoblasts, but a substantial down-regulation of the EGFR itself. Furthermore, analysis of cell membranes alone revealed almost undetectable levels of EGFR, suggesting a possible internalization of the residual receptor present (36Wang X.Q. Yan Q. Sun P. Liu J.W.

Chem. 2002; 277: 47028-47034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, we propose that prolonged EGFR inhibition by persistent high levels of GM3, because of NEU3 silencing, may lead to internalization of the inhibited receptor (36Wang X.Q. Yan Q. Sun P. Liu J.W. Go L. McDaniel S.M. Paller A.S. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 9986-9995Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 37Yamaguchi K. Hata K. Wada T. Moriya S. Miyagi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 2002; 277: 47028-47034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and ultimately to a down-regulation of EGFR at the transcription level. This line of interpretation is supported by the observation that (a) the addition of GM3 in the culture medium strongly inhibited wild-type C2C12 capability to differentiate, and (b) the stimulation of the residual EGFR present in iNEU3 cells by direct administration of EGF in the culture medium, combined with inhibition of ganglioside biosynthesis with PPMP, caused a partial restoration of their capability to differentiate. Moreover, it has been shown that NEU3 co-immunoprecipitates with EGFR in cancer cells and that high levels of NEU3 in cancer cells suppress apoptosis by promoting EGFR phosphorylation probably through its association with EGFR and activation of Ras cascades (39Miyagi T. Wada T. Yamaguchi K. Hata K. Shiozaki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2008; 144: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Finally, as NEU3 has been shown to exert its catalytic activity on adjacent cells (20Papini N. Anastasia L. Tringali C. Croci G. Bresciani R. Yamaguchi K. Miyagi T. Preti A. Prinetti A. Prioni S. Sonnino S. Tettamanti G. Venerando B. Monti E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16989-16995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), we tested if iNEU3 myoblasts could be rescued and induced to differentiate by direct co-culture with wild-type C2C12 cells, in which NEU3 is expressed at normal levels. To this purpose, iNEU3 cells were marked by transfection with a GFP-expressing plasmid and co-cultured with differentiating wild-type C2C12 myoblasts (Fig. 5E). At the end of the differentiation process, we observed the formation of several GFP-expressing myotubes, indicating that wild-type C2C12 cells at least partially rescued iNEU3 cells, which differentiated and co-participated in myotube formation. Instead, the pre-conditioned medium of differentiating C2C12 myoblasts, or indirect co-cultures with Transwell systems, did not induce iNEU3 differentiation, suggesting that potential soluble factors released from wild-type C2C12 cells alone were not able, or sufficient, to restore the lost phenotype. At this point, we can envisage a plausible role of NEU3 in skeletal muscle differentiation. The gradual increase of NEU3 during differentiation may be responsible of directing cells toward the differentiating phenotype while protecting them from apoptosis. According to our view, because of its peculiar position on the outer cell membrane, NEU3 modulates the ganglioside content of adjacent cells with special regard to GM3 concentration, thus governing the cell-to-cell signaling program required for skeletal muscle differentiation. Decrease of NEU3 activity, even when only partial, causes a rise of GM3 concentration over a critical point, resulting in the inhibition of the EGFR activation, the down-regulation of the same receptor, and a higher responsiveness of myoblasts to the apoptotic stimuli. On the other hand, although expected, we did not observe any significant variation in lactosylceramide content after NEU3 silencing. This was presumably due to the fact that GM3 accumulation, in our stably NEU3-silenced cells, may result in a reduced biosynthesis of the ganglioside, thus explaining no appreciable variations in lactosylceramide content; therefore, we tend to exclude its involvement in the observed phenomena. On the other hand, it has been recently reported that pathological human fibroblasts in which GM3 synthase was mutated and not functional showed a complete depletion of gangliosides on the cell membrane and an inhibition of EGFR activation (40Liu Y. Su Y. Wiznitzer M. Epifano O. Ladisch S. Glycobiology. 2008; 18: 593-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This may be the result of the reduced levels of other key gangliosides such as GD1a, which is known to enhance autophosphorylation of EGFR (41Miljan E.A. Bremer E.G. Science's STKE. 2002; 2002: RE15Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus, whereas it is clear that each cell line may display a different ganglioside pattern and may respond differently to ganglioside pattern variations, evidences clearly indicate that individual gangliosides are directly and specifically involved in an array of physiological and pathological processes. In our cell model, after NEU3 silencing, GM3 becomes by far the most abundant ganglioside on the cell membrane, but we cannot exclude that it may also interact with different receptors, other than EGFR, as gangliosides are known to interact with functional membrane proteins, such as integrins, growth factor receptors, tetraspanins, and non-receptor cytoplasmatic protein kinases (42R. Todeschini A. Hakomori S.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1780: 421-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, to further verify our hypotheses, it would be interesting to study the effects of NEU3 overexpression in C2C12 cells. This issue is currently under investigation in our laboratories.

Without the first cleavage by DegS, RseP is unable to cleave full-length RseA. We previously showed that a PDZ-like domain in the RseP periplasmic region is essential for this negative regulation of RseP. We now isolated additional deregulated RseP mutants. Many of the mutations affected a periplasmic region that is N-terminal to the previously defined PDZ domain. We expressed these regions and determined their crystal structures. Consistent with a recent prediction, our results indicate that RseP has tandem, circularly permutated PDZ domains (PDZ-N and PDZ-C). Strikingly, almost all the strong mutations have been mapped around the ligand binding cleft region in PDZ-N. These results together with those of an in vitro reaction reproducing the two-step RseA cleavage suggest that the proteolytic function of RseP is controlled by ligand binding to PDZ-N.

In bacteria, abnormalities in cell envelope proteins are generally referred to as “extracytoplasmic stresses.” Such stress signals are transmitted across the cytoplasmic membrane to the cytoplasm by specific signal transduction systems, leading to the induced synthesis of a set of cell surface proteins that function to cope with the stresses. These responses are called extracytoplasmic stress response (1.Raivio T.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1119-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 2.Rowley G. Spector M. Kormanec J. Roberts M. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 4: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The σE pathway of extracytoplasmic stress response involves a proteolytic cascade that activates an alternative sigma factor (σE) responsible for transcription of stress-induced genes (1.Raivio T.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1119-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 2.Rowley G. Spector M. Kormanec J. Roberts M. Nat. Rev.

PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). σE is normally kept inactive by its tight binding to the cytoplasmic domain of the anti-σE protein, RseA, which has a type II (cytoplasmic N terminus, periplasmic C terminus) membrane topology (4.Missiakas D. Mayer M.P. Lemaire M. Georgopoulos C. Raina S. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 355-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 5.De Las Peñas A. Connolly L. Gross C.A. Mol.

Under stressed conditions, DegS, a cytoplasmic membrane-anchored protease, is activated to cleave the periplasmic side of RseA (7.Ades S.E. Connolly L.E. Alba B.M. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2449-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In this process, a peptide, conserved among many outer membrane proteins in their C termini, binds to the PDZ domain of DegS and induces a conformational change to activate its proteolytic function (8.Walsh N.P.

Cell. 2007; 131: 572-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). After the first cleavage by DegS, RseP, another membrane protease, cleaves RseA within its transmembrane segment and releases the complex of σE and the RseA cytoplasmic domain from the membrane (11.Kanehara K. Ito K. Akiyama Y. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2147-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 12.Alba B.M. Leeds J.A. Onufryk C. Lu C.Z. Gross C.A.

The RseA cytoplasmic domain is finally degraded by cytoplasmic ATP-dependent proteases, leading to the liberation of active σE (14.Chaba R. Grigorova I.L. Flynn J.M. Baker T.A. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 124-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). RseP is a family member of the S2P intramembrane proteases (15.Kinch L.N. Ginalski K. Grishin N.V. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Our biochemical studies (16.Koide K. Maegawa S. Ito K. Akiyama Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 2008; 283: 9562-9570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) suggested that the active site of RseP is sequestered within a proteinaceous domain that is partially embedded in the membrane, in agreement with the recently elucidated crystal structure of an S2P homolog from an archaeal species, Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (16.Koide K. Maegawa S. Ito K. Akiyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4553-4560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 17.Koide K. Ito K. Akiyama Y. J. Biol.

Science. 2007; 318: 1608-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). For RseP to cleave RseA, RseA must receive the prior cleavage by DegS (11.Kanehara K. Ito K. Akiyama Y. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2147-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 12.Alba B.M. Leeds J.A. Onufryk C. Lu C.Z. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2156-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Thus, there must be some mechanism by which proteolytic action of RseP against full-length RseA is suppressed. This negative regulation, which prevents unwanted expression of stress proteins, is an integral and essential part of the σE pathway regulation. Several lines of evidence suggest that multiple elements are involved in this apparently negative regulation; they include the “PDZ-like” domain of RseP (19.Kanehara K. Ito K. Akiyama Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6389-6398Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 20.Bohn C. Collier J. Bouloc P. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the Gln-rich sequences in the RseA periplasmic region (19.Kanehara K. Ito K. Akiyama Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6389-6398Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and the periplasmic RseB protein and DegS (21.Grigorova I.L. Chaba R. Zhong H.J. Alba B.M. Rhodius V. Herman C. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2686-2697Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The RseB function in the negative regulation is dependent on the RseP PDZ domain, whereas DegS acts independently of it (21.Grigorova I.L. Chaba R. Zhong H.J. Alba B.M. Rhodius V. Herman C. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2686-2697Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In this study we further explored the regulatory roles of the PDZ-like elements in the periplasmic region of RseP. PDZ (named after three eukaryotic proteins, in which these domains were first identified: PSD-95, DLG, and ZO-1) is one of the most widespread modular protein domains involved in protein-protein interaction and is shared by many proteins in organisms from prokaryotes to eukaryotes (22.Harris B.Z. Lim W.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3219-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Jeleñ F. Oleksy A. Smietana K. Otlewski J. Acta Biochim. Pol. 2003; 50: 985-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). PDZ domains consist of 80-100 amino acid residues and participate in a variety of signaling processes as well as degradation, transport, and localization of proteins by recognizing specific ligands, generally their C-terminal 3-5 residues (22.Harris B.Z. Lim W.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3219-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Jeleñ F. Oleksy A. Smietana K. Otlewski J. Acta Biochim.

Science. 2007; 317: 364-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, several cell surface proteases have this protein module presumably for specific substrate recognition and regulation of the proteolytic functions. Site-directed alterations of conserved residues in the RseP PDZ-like domain as well as deletion of this domain impaired the negative regulation, enabling RseP to cleave full-length RseP in the absence of DegS (19.Kanehara K. Ito K. Akiyama Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6389-6398Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 20.Bohn C. Collier J. Bouloc P. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear how the PDZ-like domain works in the modulation of RseP proteolytic function. Here we addressed the mechanism of PDZ-mediated regulation of RseP by combined genetic, biochemical, and structural approaches. Our results suggest that RseP carries, instead of the previously assigned PDZ-like domain (PDZ*), two circularly permutated PDZ domains (PDZ-N and PDZ-C) with differential functions in the regulation with the N-terminal domain (PDZ-N) playing a major role.

X-ray diffraction data sets for SeMet PDZ-N(L169M) were collected on beamline BL5A at Photon Factory, KEK (Tsukuba, Japan) with a Quantum 315 CCD detector at cryogenic temperature (100 K). Those for SeMet PDZ-C were collected on beamline BL44XU at SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan) with an image plate/CCD hybrid detector DIP6040 (Mac Science/Bruker AXS) at 100 K. All the data were indexed and scaled with HKL2000 (25.Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Acta Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The PDZ-N and the PDZ-C crystals contained three PDZ-N molecules and one PDZ-C molecule, respectively, in an asymmetric unit. Crystallographic data are summarized in Table 2. Phase determination was carried out from single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) data collected at the selenium-peak wavelength using the programs SHELXC/D/E (27.Shelderick G.

The electron density maps revealed a typical PDZ-fold for either PDZ domain (note that their primary-tertiary structure relationship exhibits a circular permutation when compared with a typical PDZ domain). The structures of PDZ-N and PDZ-C were refined against the 18.55-1.70 Å and 20.75-0.98 Å intensity data, respectively, using Refmac5 (26.Collaborative Computational Project N.

For assays of RseP cleavage of His6-MBP-RseA140 and His6-MBP-RseA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and 100 μg/ml E. coli phospholipids (Avanti) were also included. For all the assays, samples were withdrawn at intervals, mixed with an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and CBB staining. Isolation of Deregulated RseP Variants Capable of Cleaving the Full-length RseA Protein—Previous site-directed substitution and deletion analyses of the PDZ-like domain of RseP (PDZ* in Fig. 1A) showed that the integrity of this domain is required for the suppression of RseP action against full-length RseA (19.Kanehara K. Ito K. Akiyama Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6389-6398Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To identify RseP regions that are involved in the negative regulation more thoroughly, we mutagenized plasmid pKK11 carrying the resP-his6-myc gene as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Strain TR71 having rpoHP3-lacZ, which reports the σE activity as that of β-galactosidase, forms a blue colony on X-gal indicator plates when the intracellular σE activity is elevated. TR71 carrying the original plasmid pKK11 formed white colonies on X-gal plates (data not shown), indicating that overexpression of wild type RseP-HM did not itself activate σE. In contrast, the mutagenized pool of pKK11 yielded blue transformant colonies at appreciable frequencies. In the screening, we found 50 dark blue and pale blue colonies out of about 6.6 × 104 transformants. After elimination of plasmid-un-linked mutants by plasmid re-isolation and re-transformation, we obtained 23 plasmid clones which were then characterized by DNA sequencing. We, thus, identified 19 different rseP mutant clones (Figs. 1A and 2A). Most of them contained a single amino acid substitution in the central periplasmic region, whereas one (pYGF7) contained a TM3 alteration, and another (pYGF4) contained double mutations affecting TM2 and the periplasmic domain.FIGURE 2DegS-independent proteolysis of RseA by the PDZ mutant forms of RseP-HM in vivo. A, amino acid alterations and the domains affected in the RseP-HM mutants isolated by the genetic screening. B, reporter LacZ activities induced by expression of the RseP PDZ mutants. Cells of TR71 (rpoHP3-lacZ) carrying the indicated pYGF plasmid, pKK11 (RseP-HM; WT), pKK131 (RseP(ΔPDZ*)-HM; ΔPDZ*), pKK135 (RseP(ΔPDZ*/D402N)-HM; ΔPDZ*/D402N), pSTD999 (RseP(L151P/H22F)-HM; L151P/H22F), or pTWV228 (vector) were grown at 37 °C in L medium (containing 10 g bacto-tryptone, 5 g yeast extract, and 5 g NaCl per liter; pH was adjusted to 7.2 by NaOH) and assayed for β-galactosidase activity. C, cellular levels of HA-RseA upon co-expression of the RseP PDZ mutants. pYGF plasmids, pKK11, pSTD999, and vector were introduced into AD1840/pSD691 (HA-RseA). Cells were grown at 30 °C in L medium containing 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 1 mm cAMP for 2 h. Portions (containing ∼6 × 107 cells) of the cultures were withdrawn and mixed with an equal volume of 10% trichloroacetic acid for subsequent SDS-PAGE and anti-HA and anti-Myc immunoblotting analyses.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Expression of these mutant RsePs caused a 1.2-3.3-fold increase in the reporter LacZ activity as compared with wild type RseP (Fig. 2B). To examine whether the mutant RsePs have an ability to cleave full-length RseA in the absence of DegS, they were co-expressed with HA-tagged RseA (HA-RseA) in a strain deleted for rseA, rseP, and degS (Fig. 2C). Immunoblotting results indicated that all the mutant forms of RseP-HM accumulated as stably as wild type RseP-HM in the cell, suggesting that the mutations did not drastically affect the overall conformation of RseP. Although cellular abundance of HA-RseA was only marginally affected upon co-expression of wild type RseP-HM (Fig. 2C, WT), it was lowered significantly upon co-expression of most of the mutant forms of RseP-HM (Fig. 2C, pYGF). Accumulation levels of HA-RseA exhibited inverse correlation with the reporter activities conferred by the RseP mutants (Figs. 2, B and C). The proteolytic function of RseP was responsible for the concurrent occurrence of the decrease in the RseA levels and of the increase in the σE activities, which was demonstrated for RseP(L151P)-HM by introducing a protease active site mutation, H22F, into it; then the double mutant, RseP(L151P/H22F)-HM, neither induced the reporter expression nor decreased the HA-RseA accumulation (Figs. 2, B and C). These results strongly suggest that the mutant RseP enzymes catalyze DegS-independent proteolysis of intact RseA. Although the mutations could simply enhance the proteolytic activity that is intrinsic to RseP, a more interesting possibility would be that they affect the specific regulatory mechanism that prevents proteolysis of intact RseA. To address this point, the mutant proteins were expressed in the rseA, rseP, degS triple mutant cells together with a model protein HA-MBP-RseA(LacYTM1)140 (supplemental Fig. S1), which mostly lacks the periplasmic domain and, therefore, receives DegS-independent cleavage by RseP, yielding a stable cytoplasmic MBP domain as a cleavage product (13.Akiyama Y. Kanehara K. Ito K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4434-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Although about 75% of this model substrate was cleaved in cells expressing wild type RseP-HM, the cleavage efficiencies never exceeded this level in cells expressing the mutant forms of RseP. In fact, many of them were less active than wild type RseP-HM in cleaving this model substrate (the results for representative mutants are shown in supplemental Fig. S1). Similarly, other RseP mutants that we engineered and used below did not show any increased proteolytic activity against this substrate (supplemental Fig. S1 and data not shown). Thus, it is unlikely that the DegS-independent proteolysis of intact RseA by the mutant RseP enzymes was due to more efficient chemistry of catalysis. RseP Has Two Tandemly Positioned PDZ Domains with Different Roles—Our sequencing results revealed unexpectedly that many strong mutations affect amino acid residues that are outside the previously assigned PDZ-like domain (PDZ*) (19.Kanehara K. Ito K. Akiyama Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6389-6398Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). They cluster in a segment N-terminal to it. These results prompted us to re-examine the amino acid sequence features of RseP. The Pfam program indicated that the region N-terminal to PDZ* has sequence characteristics that exhibit low but significant similarity to those of the PDZ domains. In agreement with this notion, Kinch et al. (15.Kinch L.N. Ginalski K. Grishin N.V. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) proposed from bioinformatic analyses of the S2P family protein sequences that the central periplasmic region of RseP contains two tandemly positioned PDZ-like domains with a circularly permutated sequence arrangement. As described below, our structural analyses revealed that each of these two PDZ-like domains indeed assumes a PDZ-fold. Thus, we here-after call them PDZ-N and PDZ-C, respectively. Whereas PDZ-C has high sequence similarity to other PDZ domains (Pfam score, 2.3E-15), PDZ-N is much more limitedly related to PDZ (Pfam score, 0.21). All the strong mutations isolated in this study were found to affect residues within the PDZ-N domain (residues Ile-145, Leu-151, Trp-162, Leu-169, Leu-213, and Gly-214, shown in Fig. 1B). On the other hand, our screening yielded only weak mutations in PDZ-C. Structural Studies of PDZ-N and PDZ-C—We determined the structures of the PDZ-N and PDZ-C regions of RseP by x-ray crystallography. We expressed these domains separately as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins in the presence of SeMet and purified them. After proteolytic removal of the glutathione S-transferase moiety, the purified PDZ-N and PDZ-C domains were crystallized, and x-ray diffraction data were collected. We also obtained native crystals for both of the PDZ-domains, which exhibited resolutions that were comparable with SeMet-labeled crystals (data not shown). Crystal structures of PDZ-N (Fig. 1B) and PDZ-C (Fig. 1C) were solved at 1.70 and 0.98 Å resolutions, respectively, through single-wavelength anomalous dispersion experiments. Crystallographic parameters are compiled in Table 2. The overall structures of the PDZ-N and the PDZ-C domains and the configurations of their secondary structure elements are very similar to the third PDZ domain of PSD95 having a typical PDZ-fold (Fig. 1D). For the aligned residues, the root mean square deviation values between the Cα atoms of PDZ-N and PSD95 and between those of PDZ-C and PSD95 are 2"

SFK activity is modulated by several protein-tyrosine phosphatases, among which RPTPα and SHP2 are the best established. We studied how RPTPα affects substrate specificity and regulation of c-Src and Fyn in response to epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor. We find that RPTPα, in a growth factor-specific manner, directs the specificity of these kinases toward a specific subset of SFK substrates, particularly the focal adhesion protein Paxillin and the lipid raft scaffolding protein Cbp/PAG. A significant fraction of RPTPα is present in lipid rafts, where its targets Fyn and Cbp/PAG reside, and growth factor-mediated SFK activation within this compartment is strictly dependent on RPTPα. Forced concentration of RPTPα into lipid rafts is compatible with activation of Fyn. Finally, RPTPα-induced phosphorylation of Paxillin and Cbp/PAG induces recruitment of the SFK inhibitory kinase Csk, indicative of negative feedback loops limiting SFK activation by RPTPα.

The ubiquity of their involvement in signaling pathways (downstream of integrins, growth factor, antigen, and G protein-coupled receptors among others), and the multitude of substrates they can phosphorylate, generate a need for mechanisms that confer stimulus- and context-appropriate specificity. Src family kinase protein-tyrosine phosphatase receptor PTP epidermal growth factor platelet-derived growth factor wild type phosphate-buffered saline Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium signal transducers and activators of transcription SFK activity is regulated by intramolecular interactions that depend on an equilibrium between tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. In the unstimulated state, catalytic activity is constrained by intramolecular interactions, such as engagement of the SH2 domain by a phosphorylated C-terminal tyrosine (generically referred to here as Tyr527 after the chicken c-Src sequence). Disruption of these interactions, e.g. through engagement of SFK SH2 and SH3 domains by third proteins and by dephosphorylation of Tyr(P)527 results in SFK activation. Activation is characterized by autophosphorylation of a conserved tyrosine in the activation loop, generically referred to as Tyr416 (after the chicken c-Src sequence). Two kinases are firmly implicated in phosphorylation of Tyr527, C-terminal Src kinase Csk, and Ctk; expression of the former is ubiquitous, whereas the latter is more restricted (e.g. to neuronal and hemopoietic tissue, and breast cancer cell lines). In hemopoietic cells, the inhibitory effect of Csk on SFK activity is strengthened further through dephosphorylation of Tyr416 by the Csk-associated PTP PEP (3Chong Y.P. Mulhern T.D. Cheng H.C. Growth Factors. 2005; 23: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). By contrast, an increasing number of protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are being implicated in controlling Tyr527 phosphorylation and thus SFK activity. Such SFK-activating PTPs include both non-receptor (e.g. PTP1B, SHP1, and SHP2) and receptor PTPs (RPTPs, such as CD45, RPTPα, RPTPϵ, and LAR) (4Roskoski Jr., R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 331: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 5Yang T. Massa S.M. Longo F.M. J. Neurobiol. 2006; 66: 1420-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). PTP regulation of SFK function is rendered even more complex by the variety of underlying mechanisms. SHP2 reduces SFK Tyr527 phosphorylation indirectly, by dephosphorylating Cbp/PAG (an adaptor protein) and thus controlling Csk recruitment into the vicinity of SFKs, leading to net SFK activation (6Zhang S.Q. Yang W. Kontaridis M.I. Bivona T.G. Wen G. Araki T. Luo J. Thompson J.A. Schraven B.L. Philips M.R. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 341-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). CD45 likely dephosphorylates Tyr(P)527 of SFKs directly in hemopoietic cells but also acts on their conserved Tyr(P)416, thus combining positive and negative functions (7Huntington N.D. Tarlinton D.M. Immunol. Lett. 2004; 94: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We and others have shown that another PTP expressed more ubiquitously than CD45, RPTPα, activates c-Src and Fyn by reducing phosphorylation of Tyr(P)527; this activation is important for adhesion-related signaling in fibroblasts (8Su J. Muranjan M. Sap J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 505-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 9Ponniah S. Wang D.Z. Lim K.L. Pallen C.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 535-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Physical interaction between RPTPα and c-Src (10Zheng X.M. Resnick R.J. Shalloway D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 964-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) suggests that RPTPα dephosphorylates Tyr(P)527 directly, but the alternative possibility of Csk regulation by RPTPα has never been investigated. In unstimulated thymocytes, RPTPα suppresses Fyn by reducing not only phosphorylation of Fyn Tyr527 but also Tyr416 (11Maksumova L. Le H.T. Muratkhodjaev F. Davidson D. Veillette A. Pallen C.J. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 7947-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The involvement of multiple PTPs in SFK regulation generates a confusing picture, with two questions standing out. First, the multiplicity of co-expressed SFK-activating PTPs (e.g. fibroblasts express RPTPα, PTPϵ, SHP2, and PTP1B) raises the question of their respective individual contributions. SFKs can phosphorylate a very large number of substrates, such as focal adhesion proteins (focal adhesion kinase, Paxillin, and p130cas), cytoskeletal proteins (cortactin, catenins, and caveolin), enzymes (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, phospholipase Cγ, p190 RhoGAP, and Syk/ZAP), adaptors (Shc, Cbl, and DOK), and receptor proteins. Do these various PTPs all modulate SFK activity globally, or is their role distinct where these various SFK substrates are concerned? Second, how are the potential activating and inhibitory effects of PTPs on SFKs (through dephosphorylation of Tyr(P)527 and Tyr(P)416, respectively) on SFKs coordinated? SFKs are typically concentrated in specialized domains such as supramolecular activation clusters, focal adhesions, or lipid rafts. However, little is known about the intracellular distribution of PTPs and their dynamics in response to extracellular stimuli. It has been postulated that net activation of an SFK by a PTP requires a measure of physical segregation between both, to specifically favor dephosphorylation of Tyr(P)527, while allowing SFK-activating autophosphorylation on Tyr416 to occur in an unimpeded manner (12Thomas M.L. Brown E.J. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 406-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 13Roach T. Slater S. Koval M. White L. Cahir McFarland E.D. Okumura M. Thomas M.

Conversely, in this model, co-concentration in the same compartment of an SFK with its controlling PTP would favor net down-regulation of SFK activity. This hypothesis has received experimental support in the case of CD45 regulation of lipid microdomain-associated SFK activity and T-cell receptor signaling (15He X. Woodford-Thomas T.A. Johnson K.G. Shah D.D. Thomas M.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 2578-2587Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), but its wider relevance remains unknown. Here we address these questions in the case of RPTPα during growth factor stimulation of fibroblasts. We find that RPTPα enhances the basal and growth factor (EGF and PDGF)-induced kinase activities of c-Src and Fyn but differentially affects tyrosine phosphorylation of individual SFK substrates in a growth factor-specific manner. We demonstrate that one quarter of cellular RPTPα is found in lipid rafts. SFK activation by growth factors in this compartment is absolutely dependent on RPTPα and occurs concurrently with additional recruitment of RPTPα. Moreover, manipulative overconcentration of RPTPα into lipid rafts also preserves its ability to activate the lipid raft-associated SFK Fyn. Our findings suggest a model in which individual PTPs specifically shepherd SFK activity toward distinct local SFK pools and SFK substrate repertoires. They do not support a role for physical segregation between this PTP and its targets for achieving net activation of lipid raft-localized SFKs. Reagents—Enolase from rabbit muscle was purchased from Sigma. Recombinant human EGF was from Chemicon, and human PDGF-BB was from Peprotech. Protein A- and G-Sepharose were purchased from Amersham Biosciences and Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., respectively. Retroviral Constructs—pBabe-WT-RPTPα, a retroviral vector expressing human WT RPTPα, was a gift from Leslie Holzinger and Bahija Jallal (Sugen, Inc.). Lipid raft-targeted RPTPα (F-PTPα) was constructed as follows. A 5′ primer was designed containing a BamHI site, a Kozak sequence, a start codon, and the first 16 N-terminal amino acids of Fyn fused to the first 6 amino acids of RPTPα intracellular region (GCGGGATCCACCATGGGCTGTGTGCAATGTAAGGATAAAGAAGCAGCGAAACTGACGAGAGGTTTAAGAAATACAAGC). A 3′ primer that began 1420 bases from RPTPα start codon (GACATACTGCATATCGGTTTGCACCATCTG) was also designed. The PCR product generated from these two primers using pBabe-WT-RPTPα as template was digested by BamHI and used to replace the corresponding fragment in pBabe-WT-RPTPα. A retroviral vector expressing mouse Cbp/PAG (pBabe-Cbp/PAG) was also constructed as follows. An expressed sequence tag clone of mouse PAG (IMAGp998N023527Q1) cloned in pT7T3D-PacI was purchased from ImaGenes GmbH (Berlin, Germany). In a first step, the fragment BamHI-Cbp-EcoRI was cloned into pBabe. In parallel, the Cbp/PAG N terminus was amplified by PCR using the expressed sequence tag clone as template and ATTGCCGGCACCATGGGCCCTGCAGGAAGCGTACTGAGCAGT and CTCACAGCCAGGGCTGCAGACACG as 5′ and 3′ primers. After digestion by Nae1 and BamHI, the PCR product was inserted into pBabe containing the fragment BamHI-Cbp-EcoRI. Preparation of Embryonic Mouse Fibroblasts and Thymocytes—The RPTPα-deficient (Ptpra-/-) mice have been previously described (8Su J. Muranjan M. Sap J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 505-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), and the allele was maintained on a C57Bl6 background. To establish littermate-matched WT and Ptpra-/- mouse primary fibroblast cultures, heterozygote mice were mated. At embryonic day 13.5, embryos were extracted from pregnant females, placed in cold PBS, and processed and genotyped individually. Internal organs were discarded, and the head was used for genotyping. The remaining tissue was dissociated by three passages through a 16-gauge needle in 5 ml of 0.25! Trypsin-EDTA solution (Invitrogen), transferred into a sterile Erlenmeyer containing glass beads and a magnetic stirrer, and digested further for 5 min at 37 °C. 5 ml of DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10! fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin were added to the mixture. Cells from each embryo were seeded in two 10-cm dishes and cultured at 37 °C. Cells from multiple embryos of the same genotype were pooled. For thymocyte preparations, thymi from 9-week-old WT or Ptpra-/- mice were dissected and smashed between two sterile frosted glass slides in 5 ml of DMEM containing 10! fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin to obtain cell suspensions. Cell Cultures, Infections, and Stimulations—RPTPα-deficient spontaneously immortalized mouse fibroblasts have been previously described (8Su J. Muranjan M. Sap J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 505-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), and were maintained in DMEM with 10! fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. These cells were infected either with pBabe, pBabe-WT-RPTPα, pBabe-F-PTPα, or pBabe-CS-RPTPα to express WT, lipid raft-targeted, or catalytically inactive RPTPα, respectively. Infected cells were selected as pools and cultured with 4 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). Before stimulation, the cells were starved for 24 h in DMEM with 0.5! fetal bovine serum and stimulated for the times indicated with growth factors (50 ng/ml EGF or 25 ng/ml PDGF). When necessary, the cells were pretreated with 10 μm PP1 (Calbiochem) or SU6656 (provided by Dr. S. Courtneidge, Sugen Inc.) for 1 h at 37 °C before growth factor exposure. Western Blot and Immunoprecipitations—After stimulation, the cells were washed two times with cold PBS and lysed on ice in Triton lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10! glycerol, 1! Triton X-100, 1! n-octyl β-glucopyranoside, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Equal amounts of proteins from cleared lysates were subjected to standard immunoprecipitation or immunoblotting procedures. Primary antibodies used were: rabbit anti-phospho-SFK (Tyr416), anti-phospho-Stat3, anti-Stat3, anti-phospho-Paxillin (Tyr118), and monoclonal anti-PY100 from Cell Signaling; monoclonal anti-Src (clone 327) from Oncogene Research Products; rabbit anti-Vav2 (gift from Dr. C. Carpenter), monoclonal anti-Cbl, anti-Paxillin, anti-Csk, and anti-Caveolin-1 from BD Biosciences; rabbit anti-phospho-Paxillin (Tyr31) from BIOSOURCE; and rabbit anti-Csk, anti-SHP2, monoclonal anti-Fyn (sc-434) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit anti-Cbp/PAG and rabbit anti-RPTPα 443 have been previously described (8Su J. Muranjan M. Sap J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 505-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 16Kawabuchi M. Satomi Y. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Nada S. Nagai K. Tarakhovsky A. Okada M. Nature. 2000; 404: 999-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or rabbit antibodies were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc., and ECL reagent was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Band intensities were quantified with ImageJ (v.1.38x). In Vitro Src and Fyn Kinase Assays—After stimulation, the cells were washed two times with cold PBS and lysed on ice with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1! Triton X-100, 1! sodium deoxycholate, 0,1! SDS, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Equal amounts of proteins from cleared lysates were used to immunoprecipitate c-Src or Fyn. Immune complexes were washed four times with cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer followed by two washes with cold TBS (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) and reacted in 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 12.5 μg of acid-denatured enolase at 30 °C for 10 min. After electrophoresis and transfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, membranes were incubated for 1 h at 55 °C in 1 m KOH. Phosphorylation of enolase was quantified with a phosphorimaging device (Fujifilm). Lipid Raft Isolations—After stimulation, the cells were washed two times with cold PBS and lysed on ice in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.1, 150 mm NaCl, 1! Triton, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Equal amounts of proteins were adjusted to 2 ml with lysis buffer, placed in the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube (344060; Beckman Coulter), and mixed with an equal volume of 80! sucrose (w/v) in lysis buffer. The samples were overlaid with 6 ml of 35! sucrose and 2 ml of 15! sucrose in lysis buffer and centrifuged at 35,000 rpm in an SW40Ti rotor for 17–20 h at 4 °C. The gradients were separated into 12 fractions of 1 ml from the top. Equal aliquots of each fraction were precipitated with an equal volume of acetone for 15 min on ice and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min. at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended in Laemmli buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE for immunoblotting. RPTPα Is Required for Basal and Growth Factor-induced SFK Activity in Fibroblasts and Is Particularly Important for SFK Stimulation by EGF—We and others have previously reported that RPTPα activates SFKs during integrin-mediated responses in fibroblasts (8Su J. Muranjan M. Sap J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 505-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 9Ponniah S. Wang D.Z. Lim K.L. Pallen C.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 535-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 17von Wichert G. Jiang G. Kostic A. De Vos K. Sap J. Sheetz M.P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Because SFKs are also activated during growth factor stimulation, we investigated the possible role of RPTPα in this process by measuring basal and growth factor-induced c-Src and Fyn kinase activity in a spontaneously immortalized Ptpra-/- fibroblast cell line (8Su J. Muranjan M. Sap J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 505-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) rescued with either WT RPTPα or a vector alone (Fig. 1A). It has been reported that the SFK epitope against which antibodies are directed can affect the ability to detect changes in in vitro SFK kinase activity; for instance, antibodies against the C terminus detect the largest increases in SFK activity (18Kypta R.M. Goldberg Y. Ulug E.T. Courtneidge S.A. Cell. 1990; 62: 481-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). However, we feared that interpretations of experiments using such antisera could be biased by differential recognition of phosphorylated versus nonphosphorylated proteins. For our analysis, we used anti-Src and -Fyn antibodies directed against the N-terminal domains of the kinases. We found that RPTPα significantly increased both basal and growth factor-induced activity of c-Src (Fig. 1B) and Fyn (Fig. 1C). There were significant differences in the effect of RPTPα on activation of these kinases by PDGF versus EGF. Most particularly, RPTPα was required for the ability of EGF, but not PDGF, to activate Fyn (Fig. 1C). For c-Src (Fig. 1B), there was a similar tendency toward an obligate requirement for RPTPα in EGF-induced c-Src activation, although significance was at the borderline (p = 0.06). Under our conditions, we did not observe significant activation of c-Src by PDGF, neither in the absence nor in the presence of RPTPα; this discrepancy from findings by others (18Kypta R.M. Goldberg Y. Ulug E.T. Courtneidge S.A. Cell. 1990; 62: 481-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) may reflect the cell type used (spontaneously immortalized mouse fibroblasts) and/or the use of an antibody against the c-Src N terminus. To follow up on our findings using an independent approach, we performed additional experiments on primary mouse fibroblasts derived in parallel from WT and Ptpra-/- embryos. Furthermore, as an alternative way of investigating SFK kinase activity, we assessed phosphorylation of SFK Tyr416, which is autophosphorylated along with SFK activation (1Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar). A phosphospecific antibody reacting with this site mainly detects a single 60-kDa species, most likely c-Src, although because of the lack of gel resolution, this may also incorporate a component of the 59-kDa Fyn protein (Fig. 1D). Consistent with previous studies, in the absence of growth factor stimulation, basal Tyr416 phosphorylation of SFKs was lower in RPTPα-deficient than in WT fibroblasts. In response to EGF, Tyr416 phosphorylation was increased in the presence of RPTPα but not in its absence. To determine whether the RPTPα effect on SFK activation was dependent on PTP catalytic activity, we also examined the effect of expression of a catalytically inactive mutant of RPTPα on SFK Tyr416 phosphorylation. Expression of this mutant protein, in which the catalytic cysteine residues in both PTP domains have been mutated to serine, left the levels of basal and EGF-induced SFK activation comparable with empty vector-infected control cells, suggesting that the effect of RPTPα requires the catalytic activity of the protein (supplemental data Fig. S2). In response to PDGF, SFK activation occurred both in the presence and absence of RPTPα (Fig. 1D)(p values for induced versus uninduced in RPTPα-deficient cells: 0.226 (n = 6) for EGF and 0.022 (n = 7) for PDGF). Taken together, these data show an excellent correspondence between reconstituted immortalized cells and primary fibroblasts using two different assays for SFK function: the in vitro kinase assays and the Tyr416 phosphorylation levels. In both settings, RPTPα played a more important role in EGF-induced than in PDGF-induced SFK activation, indicating that its function in SFK activation is stimulus-specific. RPTPα Ablation Differentially Affects Tyrosine Phosphorylation of SFK Substrates—Next, we assessed the role of RPTPα for phosphorylation of various individual SFK substrates in vivo, by comparing WT and Ptpra-/- primary fibroblasts. We and others already reported that the absence of RPTPα compromises phosphorylation of various substrates involved in integrin signaling (8Su J. Muranjan M. Sap J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 505-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 9Ponniah S. Wang D.Z. Lim K.L. Pallen C.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 535-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Here, we focused on a series of signaling intermediates whose tyrosine phosphorylation in response to growth factors is known to be mediated by SFKs, i.e. STAT-3, Vav2, Cbl, Paxillin, and Cbp/PAG (19Bromann P.A. Korkaya H. Courtneidge S.A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7957-7968Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 20Turner C.E. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 21Kasai A. Shima T. Okada M. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 1175-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). As expected, we found that both EGF and PDGF enhanced phosphorylation of all five proteins in WT cells. Strikingly, tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 was entirely independent of RPTPα at all time points (Fig. 2A and data not shown). We confirmed that, consistent with the literature (19Bromann P.A. Korkaya H. Courtneidge S.A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7957-7968Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 was indeed SFK-dependent, because it could be entirely abolished by treatment with two established SFK inhibitors, PP1 and SU6656 (Fig. 2A). RPTPα ablation had only very minor effects on phosphorylation of Vav2 or Cbl. Following acute (10 min) stimulation with either EGF or PDGF, phosphorylation of these two proteins was indistinguishable between WT and RPTPα-deficient cells. In the basal state, a slight reduction in Vav2 phosphorylation was observed in the absence of RPTPα; this reduction reappeared at the late time points for EGF (60 min) but not for PDGF (60 or 120 min) (Fig. 2B). Cbl phosphorylation showed no differences between genotypes at the basal state or after acute (10 min) stimulation but a more transient phosphorylation in response to EGF in RPTPα-deficient cells (Fig. 2C). By contrast, the absence of RPTPα led to a significant reduction in tyrosine phosphorylation of the SFK substrate and focal adhesion protein Paxillin. Growth factor stimulation only marginally altered the level of Paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation in both cell types, and its tyrosine phosphorylation in RPTPα-deficient cells essentially was similarly reduced at all time points (Fig. 2D). Of note, the absence of RPTPα did not affect the growth factor-induced mobility shift of Paxillin, which is thought to reflect serine/threonine phosphorylation (22Schaller M.D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6459-6472Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). In contrast to Paxillin, tyrosine phosphorylation of the lipid raft Fyn substrate Cbp/PAG was clearly increased by growth factors in our hands, in WT as well as in RPTPα-deficient cells, and this increase persisted for at least 60 min. The absence of RPTPα lowered the level of Cbp/PAG phosphorylation to the same extent under all conditions and thus did not affect growth factor inducibility of Cbp/PAG phosphorylation per se (Fig. 2E). Taken together, this analysis shows that the impaired SFK activity seen in absence of RPTPα (Fig. 1) does not affect tyrosine phosphorylation of SFK substrates indiscriminately; rather, RPTPα is of selective importance for the control of phosphorylation of a specific subset of SFK targets. RPTPα Enhances Paxillin Phosphorylation on Tyr31 and Tyr118 and Recruitment of Csk to Paxillin—Paxillin is a scaffolding protein phosphorylated by SFKs on several tyrosines, among which Tyr31 and Tyr118 have been the best characterized (23Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Investigating how phosphorylation of these individual sites was dependent on SFK activation by RPTPα, we found that both Tyr31 and Tyr118 were hypophosphorylated in Ptpra-/- cells (Fig. 3A). Phosphorylated Paxillin Tyr31 and Tyr118 constitute, among others, binding sites for Csk (23Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), itself a key negative regulator of SFK activity via phosphorylation of SFK C-terminal tyrosine. Accordingly, we determined whether Csk recruitment on Paxillin was affected in the absence of RPTPα, by immunoprecipitating Csk from cell lysates and immunoblotting the membrane with an anti-Paxillin antibody. Under basal conditions, the amount of Paxillin bound to Csk was lower in RPTPα-deficient fibroblasts than in their WT counterparts. This difference persisted after growth factor stimulation (Fig. 3B). Taken together, our results indicate that enhancement of Paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation via RPTPα-activated SFKs causes Csk recruitment, resulting in a feedback loop that may limit SFK activation by RPTPα. RPTPα Is Localized in Fibroblast Lipid Rafts and Is Strictly Required for Activation of Raft-associated SFKs by Growth Factors—Both Fyn and its substrate, the scaffolding protein Cbp/PAG, are characteristically and highly enriched in the “lipid raft” compartment of the plasma membrane (24Yasuda K. Nagafuku M. Shima T. Okada M. Yagi T. Yamada T. Minaki Y. Kato A. Tani-Ichi S. Hamaoka T. Kosugi A. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 2813-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 25Shima T. Nada S. Okada M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14897-14902Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Co-localization with substrates is a well established mechanism for conferring specificity upon phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions. Overexpressed RPTPα has been observed in plasma membrane and in an intracellular vesicular compartment (26Tracy S. van der Geer P. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10587-10594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Mutant versions of RPTPα have been observed in focal adhesion plaques (27Lammers R. Lerch M.M. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3391-3396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Our own immunofluorescence analysis of WT RPTPα protein in fibroblasts reveals a diffuse membrane stain (data not shown). Whether and how localization affects RPTP target specificity is currently a matter of uncertainty and even contention. I"
https://openalex.org/W1964952095,"Insulin stimulation results in the activation of cyclin-dependent kinase-5 (CDK5) in lipid raft domains via a Fyn-dependent phosphorylation on tyrosine residue 15. In turn, activated CDK5 phosphorylates the Rho family GTP-binding protein TC10α on threonine 197 that is sensitive to the CDK5 inhibitor olomoucine and blocked by small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of CDK5. The phosphorylation deficient mutant T197A-TC10α was not phosphorylated and excluded from the lipid raft domain, whereas the phosphorylation mimetic mutant (T197D-TC10α) was lipid raft localized. Insulin resulted in the GTP loading of T197D-TC10α but not T197A-TC10α and in parallel, T197D-TC10α but not T197A-TC10α depolymerized cortical actin and inhibited insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. These data demonstrate that CDK5-dependent phosphorylation maintains TC10α in lipid raft compartments thereby disrupting cortical actin, whereas subsequent dephosphorylation of TC10α through inactivation of CDK5 allows for the re-assembly of F-actin. Because cortical actin reorganization is required for insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, these data are consistent with a CDK5-dependent TC10α cycling between lipid raft and non-lipid raft compartments.

Similar to fibroblasts, pre-differentiated adipocytes are elongated and relatively flat cells that contain well defined actin stress fibers. In contrast, following differentiation into mature adipocytes the cells become highly spherical with a relatively thick cortical actin lining the inner surface of the plasma membrane. This cortical actin structure in adipocytes is composed of patches of punctate F-actin that emanates from organized caveolae-rosettes containing the caveolin protein refered to as Cav-actin (1Kanzaki M. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25867-25869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This cortical organization of F-actin is dependent on caveolae-rosette organization as disruption of caveolae results in the dissolution of cortical actin, whereas depolymerization of cortical actin has no effect on caveolae-rosette organization (2Watson R.T. Shigematsu S. Chiang S.H. Mora S. Kanzaki M. Macara I.G. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 829-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 3Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Baldini G. Sargiacomo M. Mastick C.C. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Although insulin induces the rapid breakdown of stress fibers and the appearance of lamellipodia in pre-adipocytes, in differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes and primary rat adipocytes insulin primarily results in dynamic actin rearrangements in both the cortical and perinuclear regions (4Omata W. Shibata H. Li L. Takata K. Kojima I. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 321-328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Kanzaki M. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42436-42444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Caveolin-enriched domains in adipocytes have also been reported to associate with a variety of structural and functional proteins. For example, the structural protein flotillin is lipid raft localized and interacts with CAP, Cbl, and Fyn (6Liu J. Deyoung S.M. Zhang M. Dold L.H. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16125-16134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In particular, the unusual Rho family member GTP-binding protein TC10 appears also to be lipid raft localized in adipocytes and has been implicated in the regulation of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation through the assembly of membrane docking regulating proteins (7Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Traffic. 2003; 4: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In parallel, TC10 appears to differentially regulate two distinct compartmentalized actin populations. Overexpression of TC10 was found to disrupt cortical actin when lipid raft localized through its endogenous carboxyl-terminal domain that specifies both farnesylation and dual acylation but not when mis-targeted through mutations that directed TC10 to non-lipid raft plasma membrane domains (8Hou J.C. Pessin J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3578-3591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, expression of a constitutive active (GTP-bound) TC10 mutant (TC10/Q75L) disrupted both Cav-actin and cortical actin structures, but induces massive actin polymerization in perinuclear regions (9Kanzaki M. Watson R.T. Hou J.C. Stamnes M. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2334-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Recent studies using enhanced yellow fluorescent protein-tagged β-actin and real-time imaging also demonstrated insulin-regulated actin rearrangement in both cortical and perinuclear regions that was prevented by the Rho-specific toxin Clostridium difficile toxin B (5Kanzaki M. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42436-42444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Thus, several lines of evidence exist for both a direct action of TC10 in mediating insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation and indirect actions through modification of actin organization. In this regard, there are three TC10 isoforms, TC10α, TC10β, and long but only the constitutive over expression of TC10α inhibits insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (10Chiang S.H. Hou J.C. Hwang J. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13067-13073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These isoforms differ at their amino terminus and previous studies suggested that this domain is responsible for alterations of actin structure and the inhibitory effect on insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (8Hou J.C. Pessin J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3578-3591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in addition to the differences in the amino-terminal extension, we have observed that there are other differences in the carboxyl-terminal regions, in particular the presence of a CDK5 consensus phosphorylation site in TC10α but not in TC10β. We have therefore examined the CDK5-dependent phosphorylation of TC10α and demonstrated that this event is necessary for the regulation of TC10α function, localization, and reorganization of cortical F-actin in adipocytes.

CO2. Confluent cultures were induced to differentiate into adipocytes as previously described (11Yamada E. Okada S. Saito T. Ohshima K. Sato M. Tsuchiya T. Uehara Y. Shimizu H. Mori M. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Scraped frozen cells were rocked for 30 min at 4 °C with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10! glycerol, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 137 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin, 5 mg/ml leupeptin). Insoluble material was separated from the soluble extract by centrifugation for 30 min at 4 °C, and the total protein amount in the supernatant was determined by the BCA method. After the addition of 4.5 μg of antibody to the whole cell lysates, samples (typically 2–3 mg of lysates) were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Then 50 μl of protein A/G-agarose was added and samples were consistently rocked for 1 h at 4 °C. After the incubation, samples were extensively washed three times with the Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. The washed samples were resuspended in SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20! (v/v) glycerol, 4! (w/v) SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1! (w/v) bromphenol blue), and heated at 100 °C for 5 min. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The samples were immunoblotted with monoclonal or polyclonal specific antibody as indicated in the figures and legends. Subcellular Extraction—To analyze F-actin rearrangement, we first isolated cytoskeleton fractions by using the ProteoExtract Subcellular Proteome Extraction Kit. After cells were resuspended in Extraction Buffer I, cells were pelleted by centrifugation (300 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). The pellet was resuspended in Extraction Buffer II and rocked for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifuged for 10 min at 6,000 × g at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in Extraction Buffer III and rocked for 10 min at 4 °C. Then sample was centrifuged for 10 min at 7,000 × g at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in Extraction Buffer IV and this suspension was used as a cytoskeletal matrix protein extraction to analyze F-actin rearrangement condition. Namely, samples were applied on SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and F-actin and G-actin amounts were estimated by Western blotting. TC10 Activity Assay—EZ-Detect CDC42 activation kit was used. Cells were scraped with Lysis/Binding/Wash buffer and transferred into Eppendorf tubes. After rocking for 5 min at 4 °C, the sample was centrifuged for 15 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C. 20 μg of GST-Pak1-p21-binding domain (PBD) was applied to the supplied spin cup and 700 μg of lysate added. The sample was mixed well and rocked for 60 min at 4 °C. Then samples were washed with Lysis/Binding/Wash buffer three times. After the TC10α bound to GST-Pak1-PBD was eluted, samples were applied on SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and immunoblotted with TC10 antibody. Transfection of 3T3L1 Adipocytes—3T3L1 adipocytes were suspended by mild trypsinization and electroporated with a total of 1 mg of plasmid under low-voltage conditions (0.16 kV, 950 microfarads) (12Okada S. Mori M. Pessin J.E. Õzcan S. Diabetes Mellitus: Methods and Protocols 83. ed. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2003: 702-708Google Scholar). The cells were then allowed to adhere to collagen-coated tissue culture dishes for 30–48 h, and the adipocytes were then serum starved for 4 h prior to incubation in the absence or presence of 100 nm insulin at 37 °C for the various time periods indicated in each figure. In Vitro CDK5 Kinase Assay and TC10α Peptide Phosphorylation—The Omnia™ Ser/Thr Recombinant Kit (BioSource International) was used to assay CDK5 activity. CDK5 was immunoprecipitated from 2.0 mg of 3T3L1 adipocytes lysates in the absence or presence of insulin stimulation. Then, immunoprecipitated CDK5 or CDK5/p35 recombinant was mixed with either biotinylated S/T control peptide (250 μm) or biotinylated synthesized TC10α peptide (250 μm, SHIMAZU Biotech, Japan) in 1× kinase buffer containing ATP and dithiothreitol and the kinase reaction was performed at 30 °C for 60 min. The samples were transferred to the streptavidin-coated 96-well plate and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The samples were extensively washed with TBST and incubated with phospho-Thr MAPK/CDK substrate monoclonal antibody at room temperature for 60 min. The samples were extensively washed again with TBST and incubated with mouse IgM horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody at room temperature for 60 min. Then samples were extensively washed with TBST and Tris-buffered saline and incubated with 1-Step Ultra TMB-ELISA (Pierce) for 20 min and the reaction was stopped with STOP solution (Cell Signaling). The absorbance was measured at 450 nm with a microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Caveolae/Rafts Isolation—One ml of Lysis buffer (Caveolae/Rafts Isolation Kit, Sigma) containing 1! Triton X-100 was added for each 10-cm dish. After cells were scraped and transferred to an Eppendorf tube, the sample was rocked for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysate was mixed with OptiPrep and the final OptiPrep concentration was adjusted to 35! concentration. Then the density gradient was made of 5 layers of OptiPrep with 35, 30, 25, 20, and 0!. The volume of each layer was 2 ml except for 1 ml of 0! OptiPrep. Samples were centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 4 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, 1-ml fractions from the top to bottom of the ultracentrifuge tube were collected. As described in manufacturer's instruction, caveolin-1 fractions were found in fractions 2–4 (25–35! OptiPrep) counting from the top and for the data presented the immunoblots are shown for fraction 2, which is the most abundant caveolin-1-enriched fraction. EGFP-GLUT4 Translocation Assay—Fifty μg of eGFP-GLUT4 plasmid with 550 μg of interesting plasmids was electroporated to 3T3L1 adipocytes. The cells were allowed to adhere to collagen-coated tissue culture dishes for 30–48 h, and the adipocytes were serum starved for 2 h before incubation in the absence or presence of 100 nm insulin for 15 min at 37 °C. Transfected adipocytes were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed for 10 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 4! paraformaldehyde and 0.2! Triton X-100. The samples were mounted on glass slides with Fluorescent Mounting Medium (DakoCytomation). Cells were imaged using a confocal fluorescence microscope (model MRC-1024; Bio-Rad). Quantification of GLUT4 Translocation—Quantification of transfected GLUT4 translocation was determined as described before (11Yamada E. Okada S. Saito T. Ohshima K. Sato M. Tsuchiya T. Uehara Y. Shimizu H. Mori M. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 12Okada S. Mori M. Pessin J.E. Õzcan S. Diabetes Mellitus: Methods and Protocols 83. ed. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2003: 702-708Google Scholar). Briefly, 3T3L1 adipocytes were co-transfected with 4 μg of eGFP-cMyc-GLUT4 plus 6 μg of various other cDNAs as indicated in each figure. Following basal or hormonal stimulation, the cells were cooled to 4 °C and incubated with a myc antibody followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody. The specific cell surface-bound horseradish peroxidase was then determined by incubation with the substrate, o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride peroxidase (11Yamada E. Okada S. Saito T. Ohshima K.

Diabetes Mellitus: Methods and Protocols 83. ed. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2003: 702-708Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—All values are expressed as mean ± S.D. Data were evaluated for statistical significance using the one-way analysis of variance and Tukey-Kramer Multiple Comparison Test. The minimum level of significance was set at p < 0.05. The InStat 2 program was used for statistical analysis. Expression of CDK5 and p35 in 3T3L1 Differentiated Adipocytes—CDK5 is a serine-threonine kinase that requires the presence of its co-activators p35 and p39 for functional enzymatic activity (13Hisanaga S. Saito T. Neurosignals. 2003; 12: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Although CDK5 is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues, it has been assumed that CDK5 activity is only present in neurons due to the selective expression of p35 and p39 (14Tsai L.H. Takahashi T. Caviness Jr., V.S. Harlow E. Development. 1993; 119: 1029-1040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Lew J. Huang Q.Q. Qi Z. Winkfein R.J. Aebersold R. Hunt T. Wang J.H.

Chem. 1995; 270: 26897-26903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have observed the expression of p35 and p39 in pancreatic β cells (18Ubeda M. Kemp D.M. Habener J.F. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 3023-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 19Lilja L. Johansson J.U. Gromada J. Mandic S.A. Fried G. Berggren P.O. Bark C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29534-29541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), suggesting the possible activation and potential role of CDK5 in other tissues. Therefore we examined whether CDK5 and p35 are expressed in differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes. As shown in Fig. 1, immunoprecipitation of CDK5 (Fig. 1A) and p35 (Fig. 1B) followed by immunoblotting demonstrated the presence of both of these proteins in differentiated adipocytes. Although the relative expression levels of CDK5 remain unchanged during adipogenesis, there was a significant increase in the expression of p35 in fully differentiated adipocytes compared with preadipocytes (Fig. 1C). In neuronal cells, CDK5 is tyrosine phosphorylated (Tyr15) by the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Fyn (20Sasaki Y. Cheng C. Uchida Y. Nakajima O. Ohshima T. Yagi T. Taniguchi M. Nakayama T. Kishida R. Kudo Y. Ohno S. Nakamura F. Goshima Y. Neuron. 2002; 35: 907-920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Insulin stimulation in 3T3L1 adipocytes resulted in an acute (5 min) CDK5 tyrosine phosphorylation as detected with a phospho-CDK5 antibody specific for Tyr15 (Fig. 1D). However, this phosphorylation was transient and returned to the basal level of Tyr15 phosphorylation by 15 min. Because insulin has been reported to activate Fyn (21Lesort M. Jope R.S. Johnson G.V. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 576-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), we reduced Fyn expression by siRNA interference that resulted in approximate 80! reduction in Fyn protein (Fig. 1E). Under these conditions, both the basal and insulin-stimulated Tyr15 phosphorylation of CDK5 was dramatically decreased without any significant effect on CDK5 protein expression. To examine the physiological role of CDK5 on insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, we took two different approaches. First, we overexpressed CDK5 and p35 in 3T3L1 adipocytes to increase CDK5 function (22Kaminosono S. Saito T. Oyama F. Ohshima F. Asada A. Nagai Y. Hisanaga S. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 8747-8755Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1F, insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation was significantly reduced compared with vector-transfected adipocytes. In a complementary approach, we reduced CDK5 expression by siRNA interference that resulted in an approximate 70–80! reduction in CDK5 protein levels (Fig. 2C). Under these conditions, there was a significant enhancement of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (Fig. 1F). To control for off target effects, we examined several CDK5 siRNAs and each resulted in increased insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, whereas overexpression of p35 with a CDK5 siRNA-resistant cDNA also resulted in an inhibition of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (data not shown). In vitro kinase activity measurement using CDK5 immunoprecipitated from basal and insulin-stimulated cells confirmed that insulin stimulation results in an increase in CDK5 kinase activity (Fig. 2D). Taken together these data demonstrate that insulin stimulation results in the kinase activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of CDK5 in a Fyn-dependent manner. TC10α Is Phosphorylated by CDK5—Because TC10α has a predicted CDK5 phosphorylation site at Thr197 (ILTPKKHT197 VKKRIGS), we next transfected 3T3L1 differentiated adipocytes with a cDNA encoding for a HA epitope-tagged either wild type TC10α (WT-TC10α) or the alanine for threonine substitution mutant (T197A-TC10α) that is predicted to prevent CDK5-dependent phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). In the basal state, WT-TC10α was phosphorylated as detected by HA immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting with a phospho-Thr MAPK/CDK substrate monoclonal antibody. Insulin stimulation for 5 min resulted in increased TC10α phosphorylation that declined to half of the maximum phosphorylation following 15 min of insulin stimulation. On the other hand, the expressed T197A-TC10α mutant protein was a poor substrate compared with WT-TC10α. Under these conditions, the total expressed amount of TC10α protein remained relatively unchanged. Consistent with a CDK5-dependent phosphorylatin of TC10α, pretreatment of the cells with a CDK5-specific inhibitor (olomoucine) reduced both the basal and acute insulin-stimulated WT-TC10α phosphorylation with no change in the amount of TC10α protein expression (Fig. 2B). To confirm that olomoucine inhibition of TC10α phosphorylation was due to a blockade of CDK5, we reduced CDK5 expression using a CDK5-specific siRNA. Although there was no change in TC10α expression, the knockdown of CDK5 markedly inhibited insulin-stimulated TC10α phosphorylation (Fig. 2C). Using both a S/T control peptide designed as a substrate for CDK5 and the specific TC10α peptide, both peptides displayed similar extents of phosphorylation by recombinant CDK5/p35 (Fig. 2D, first two bars). Under basal conditions S/T control peptide and TC10α peptide were also phosphorylated by CDK5 immunoprecipitated from 3T3L1 adipocytes extracts. As expected, extracts isolated from insulin-stimulated 3T3L1 adipocytes displayed increased phosphorylation of both peptides (last two bars). These data demonstrated that insulin not only activates the kinase activity of CDK5 but that TC10α is a direct substrate of CDK5 kinase. CDK5 Localizes to Lipid Rafts Microdomains—Because TC10α is known to be lipid raft associated, we next investigated the localization of CDK5 by comparing its plasma membrane distribution with an established lipid raft marker caveolin-1 (23Nichols B. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4707-4714Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). To do this, the caveolae/raft fraction was isolated by gradient fractionation from 3T3L1 adipocytes as previously described (24Fielding C.T. Fielding P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1610: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). CDK5 co-fractionated with caveolin-1 in adipocytes expressed WT-TC10α, T197A-TC10α, as well as cells expressing T197D-TC10α that mimics TC10 phosphorylation (Fig. 3A). Because CDK5 is lipid raft associated, we next examined the possible role of CDK5-dependent phosphorylation of TC10α to regulate TC10α plasma membrane localization. As shown in Fig. 3B, WT-TC10α was colocalized with caveolin-1, whereas the amount of T197A-TC10α colocalized with caveolin-1 was substantially reduced. In contrast, expression of an aspartic acid substitution mutant expected to mimic phosphorylation (T197D-TC10α) display an equivalent amount of colocalization with caveolin-1. The reduced amount of T197A-TC10α that co-fractionated with caveolin-1 was not due to differences in protein expression as the level of each TC10α construct was essentially identical (Fig. 3B). These data are consistent with Thr197 phosphorylation being a regulatory event controlling the partitioning of TC10α between non-lipid raft and lipid domains. TC10α Phosphorylation and GTP/GDP Exchange—Previous studies have demonstrated that insulin stimulates the activation of TC10α by increasing GTP binding through the exchange of GTP for GDP (25Kanzaki M. Endocr. J. 2006; 53: 267-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To assess the role of TC10α phosphorylation on GTP loading, we took advantage of the PBD that recognizes only the GTP activated states of the Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins (26Benard V. Bohl B. Bokoch G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-131204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3C, insulin stimulation resulted in an increase in PBD precipitation of WT-TC10α indicative of a increase in GTP binding, whereas the PBD interaction with T197A-TC10α was substantially reduced both in the basal and insulin-stimulated state. In contrast, T197D-TC10α displayed a high basal state binding to the PBD domain that was not further changed following insulin stimulation. Thus, these data indicated that Thr197 phosphorylation functionally regulates the ability of TC10α to become activated through increased GTP/GDP exchange. TC10α Phosphorylation Regulates F-actin Polymerization State—Several studies have observed that the lipid raft targeting of constitutively overexpressed TC10α results in a disruption of adipocyte cortical actin organization with a concomitant inhibition of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (1Kanzaki M. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25867-25869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 2Watson R.T. Shigematsu S. Chiang S.H. Mora S. Kanzaki M. Macara I.G. Saltiel A.R.

As the data presented in Fig. 3 are consistent with Thr197 phosphorylation resulting in both GTP loading and lipid raft localization, cytoskeletal and cytosolic fractions were isolated and immunoblotted for actin content (Fig. 4). Expression of WT-TC10α and T197D-TC10α resulted in a marked disruption of F-actin in adipocytes compared with cells transfected with the empty vector. In contrast, adipocytes transfected with the CDK5 phosphorylation defective mutant (T197A-TC10α) had no significant change in F-actin assembly. Moreover, the total amount of F-actin present was not affected by insulin stimulation and paralleled the changes observed with the TC10α phosphorylation mutants in the basal state. Thus, these data are consistent with the disruption of cortical F-actin related to the localization of TC10α to the lipid raft domains that are in turn regulated by the Thr197 phosphorylation state. TC10α Phosphorylation and Insulin-stimulated GLUT4 Translocation—Because the ability of overexpressed TC10α to inhibit insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation correlates with cortical F-actin depolymerization, we determined the effect of the TC10α mutants. Adipocytes were co-transfected with a cMyc-GLUT4-eGFP reporter and either WT-TC10α or the T197D-TC10α or T197A-TC10α mutants (Fig. 5). Overexpression of WT-TC10α and T197D-TC10α had no effect on the basal state of GLUT4 distribution but markedly inhibited insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane, whereas T197A-TC10α was without any significant inhibitory effect. These data are quantified in Fig. 5B using a quantitative colorimetric assay that detects the amount of GLUT4 at the cell surface (11Yamada E. Okada S. Saito T. Ohshima K. Sato M. Tsuchiya T. Uehara Y. Shimizu H. Mori M. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 12Okada S. Mori M. Pessin J.E. Õzcan S. Diabetes Mellitus: Methods and Protocols 83. ed. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2003: 702-708Google Scholar). Thus, these data are consistent with Thr197 phosphorylation of TC10α as providing an important signal for the depolymerization of adipocyte F-actin and inhibition of insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation. To examine whether the TC10α inhibition of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation was CDK5-dependent, CDK5 expression was reduced by RNAi gene silencing. As previously observed (Fig. 1F), the knockdown of CDK5 resulted in enhanced insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (Fig. 5C). As expected, overexpression of WT-TC10α had no effect on the basal state of GLUT4 translocation but inhibited insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (Fig. 5C). However, CDK5 knockdown prevented the inhibitory effects of WT-TC10α and resulted in a normal extent of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (*, p < 0.05). On the other hand, overexpression of T197A-TC10α in these experiments resulted in a small reduction of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation that was fully reversed by siRNA-mediated knockdown of CDK5 (Fig. 5C). More importantly, overexpression of T197D-TC10α had no effect on the basal state of GLUT4 translocation but markedly inhibited insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (Fig. 5C). Under these conditions, the CDK5 was completely unable to restore insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (Fig. 5C). These data are consistent with CDK5-dependent phosphorylation of Thr197 being responsible for the inhibitory function of TC10α on insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. Previous studies have observed that overexpression of WT-TC10α, a constitutively GTP-bound active mutant (Q75L-TC10α) and a constitutively GDP-inactive mutant (T31N-TC10α), all inhibited insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (25Kanzaki M. Endocr. J. 2006; 53: 267-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 27Chiang S.H. Baumann C.A. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Watson R.T. Neudauer C.L. Macara I.G. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2001; 410: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Moreover, unlike other Rho family GTP-binding proteins, TC10α contains a carboxyl-terminal CAAX domain that targets TC10α to plasma membrane lipid raft microdomains (8Hou J.C. Pessin J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3578-3591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the inhibitory effect of overexpressed TC10α was reported to depend on lipid raft microdomain compartmentalization, whereas targeting of TC10α to non-lipid raft domains of the plasma membrane were without effect (8Hou J.C. Pessin J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3578-3591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the fact that the inhibitory action of TC10α is independent of effecter domain activation but requires appropriate intracellular compartmentalization strongly suggests that a specific protein interacting with the structural domain of TC10α is responsible. Nevertheless, TC10α regulation appears to play an important role in the insulin regulation of GLUT4 translocation as insulin stimulation results in GTP loading and subsequent recruitment of the exocyst complex required for GLUT4 transporter vesicle docking (27Chiang S.H. Baumann C.A. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Watson R.T. Neudauer C.L. Macara I.G. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2001; 410: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). In addition, TC10α appears to have marked effects on adipocyte cortical F-actin organization and remodeling (1Kanzaki M. Pessin J.E. J. Biol.

Thus, the question of how insulin regulates TC10α signals mediating actin function remains as an open question. As previous studies have also demonstrated that overexpression of wild type, constitutively active, or constitutively inactive TC10α mutants, but not TC10β, inhibited insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, glucose uptake, and disrupted cortical F-actin (10Chiang S.H. Hou J.C. Hwang J. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13067-13073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), it is likely that specific sequence differences were responsible. Inspection of the amino acid sequence indicated the presence of a CDK5 phosphorylation site in TC10α (Thr197) that is not present in TC10β. Thus, we predicted that CDK5-dependent phosphorylation of TC10α may provide an important control mechanism for the differential function of TC10α versus TC10β. In this regard, we have confirmed the presence of the CDK5 in differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes as well as the presence of the CDK5 regulatory protein, p35, which is sufficient for CDK5 kinase activity (11Yamada E. Okada S. Saito T. Ohshima K. Sato M. Tsuchiya T. Uehara Y. Shimizu H. Mori M. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 28Lim A.C. Qu D. Qi R.Z. Neurosignals. 2003; 12: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although, the Abl non-receptor tyrosine kinase was reported to phosphorylate CDK5 on Tyr15 that resulted in increased CDK5 kinase activity (29Zukerberg L.R. Patrick G.N. Nikolic M. Humbert S. Wu C.L. Lanier L.M. Gertler F.B. Vidal M. Van Etten R.A. Tsai L.H. Neuron. 2000; 25: 633-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (325) Google Scholar), we have also observed that the Src family kinase Fyn also phosphorylates CDK5 at Tyr15 in 3T3L1 adipocytes, similar to that found neuronal cells (18Ubeda M. Kemp D.M. Habener J.F. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 3023-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In fact, we have observed a CDK5 basal phosphorylation at Tyr15 that also underwent a rapid increase but transient insulin-dependent phosphorylation in adipocytes. The fact that CDK5 displayed a relatively low basal level of Tyr15 phosphorylation was consistent with a relatively low level of CDK5 kinase activity. The insulin-stimulated increase in CDK5-Tyr15 phosphorylation correlated with an increase in CDK5 substrate kinase activity. Thus, our data strongly suggest that CDK5 is activated in the basal state as well as further activated following brief insulin stimulation and that Fyn is the upstream tyrosine kinase that mediates CDK5 activation. In addition to its role in CDK5 protein kinase activation, p35 has also been reported to directly associate with the GTP-bound isoforms of the Rac, Rho family GTPases that are master regulators of actin polymerization (30Nikolic M. Chou M.M. Lu W. Mayer B.J. Tsai L.H. Nature. 1998; 395: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). TC10α is a member of the Rho family that is lipid raft localized and we have observed that CDK5 colocalizes to caveolin-enriched domains, similar to that observed for TC10α. TC10α also appears to be a CDK5 substrate as mutation of the consensus phosphorylation site and pretreatment with either the CDK5 inhibitor olomoucine or CDK5 RNAi reduced TC10α phosphorylation on Thr197. Having established evidence that TC10α is a CDK5 substrate and undergoes Thr197 phosphorylation, expression of a phosphorylation-deficient mutant T197A as well as phosphorylation mimetic mutant T197D demonstrated that phosphorylation at this site controls not only lipid raft localization and GTP/GDP conversion but also F-actin organization and insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. Based upon these data, we can postulate the following model for the control of GLUT4 translocation by TC10α. In the basal state, TC10α is phosphorylated and lipid raft localized, which defines the resting state of adipocyte cortical F-actin. Insulin stimulation transiently increases TC10α phosphorylation thereby altering its positioning from non-lipid raft to lipid raft plasma membrane domains. Because TC10α has intrinsic actin depolymerization activity, this results in a reduction in the amount of cortical F-actin. However, subsequent dephosphorylation results in redistribution back toward non-lipid raft domains, thereby increasing cortical F-actin organization. As dynamic actin remodeling (polymerization/depolymerization) is necessary for GLUT4 translocation (5Kanzaki M. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42436-42444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 25Kanzaki M. Endocr. J. 2006; 53: 267-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), this provides access of the GLUT4 transporter vesicles to the plasma membrane localized exocyst docking sites. This model also accounts for the effect of overexpression of TC10α to inhibit GLUT4 translocation and depolymerize cortical actin. As CDK5 is basally active, overexpression of TC10α results in net accumulation of TC10α in lipid raft domains shifting the balance to net actin depolymerization and perturbs the dynamic balance between actin depolymerization and polymerization. In conclusion, our data indicate that CDK5 plays an important role in the basal and insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of a key regulatory site (Thr197) in the TC10α isoform. This phosphorylation event establishes the localization of TC10α to either lipid raft or non-lipid raft domains and thereby modulates the intrinsic cortical actin polymerization and depolymerization properties of TC10α. This regulation of cortical F-actin dynamics thereby allows or prevents access of GLUT4 transporter vesicles to their plasma membrane docking sites, an event essential for membrane fusion and glucose uptake in adipocytes."

https://openalex.org/W2089959863,"DNA sequence context has emerged as a critical determinant of the location and quantity of nucleobase damage caused by many oxidizing agents. However, the complexity of nucleobase and 2-deoxyribose damage caused by strong oxidants such as ionizing radiation and the Fenton chemistry of Fe2+-EDTA/H2O2 poses a challenge to defining the location of nucleobase damage and the effects of sequence context on damage chemistry in DNA. To address this problem, we developed a gel-based method that allows quantification of nucleobase damage in oxidized DNA by exploiting Escherichia coli exonuclease III to remove fragments containing direct strand breaks and abasic sites. The rigor of the method was verified in studies of guanine oxidation by photooxidized riboflavin and nitrosoperoxycarbonate, for which different effects of sequence context have been demonstrated by other approaches (Margolin, Y., Cloutier, J. F., Shafirovich, V., Geacintov, N. E., and Dedon, P. C. (2006) Nat. Chem. Biol. 2, 365–366). Using duplex oligodeoxynucleotides containing all possible three-nucleotide sequence contexts for guanine, the method was used to assess the role of DNA sequence context in hydroxyl radical-induced guanine oxidation associated with γ-radiation and Fe2+-EDTA/H2O2. The results revealed both differences and similarities for G oxidation by hydroxyl radicals and by one-electron oxidation by riboflavin-mediated photooxidation, which is consistent with the predominance of oxidation pathways for hydroxyl radicals other than one-electron oxidation to form guanine radical cations. Although the relative quantities of G oxidation produced by hydroxyl radicals were more weakly correlated with sequence-specific ionization potential than G oxidation produced by riboflavin, damage produced by both hydroxyl radical generators and riboflavin within two- and three-base runs of G showed biases in location that are consistent with a role for electron transfer in defining the location of the damage products. Furthermore, both γ-radiation and Fe2+-EDTA/H2O2 showed relatively modest effects of sequence context on the proportions of different damage products sensitive to E. coli formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase and hot piperidine, although GT-containing sequence contexts displayed subtle biases in damage chemistry (formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase/piperidine ratio). Overall, the results are consistent with the known chemistry of guanine oxidation by hydroxyl radical and demonstrate that charge migration plays a relatively minor role in determining the location and chemistry of hydroxyl radical-mediated oxidative damage to guanine in DNA.

Overall, the results are consistent with the known chemistry of guanine oxidation by hydroxyl radical and demonstrate that charge migration plays a relatively minor role in determining the location and chemistry of hydroxyl radical-mediated oxidative damage to guanine in DNA. With implications for mutagenesis and carcinogenesis, DNA damage caused by strong oxidizing agents such as ionizing radiation and Fenton chemistry (e.g. Fe2+-EDTA, Cu+/H2O2) affects both the base and sugar moieties (1Breen A.P. Murphy J.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 1033-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar, 2von Sonntag C. The Chemical Basis of Radiation Biology. Taylor & Francis, New York1987Google Scholar). This complexity poses a challenge to understanding the mechanisms of formation of the ultimate stable oxidation products and their relative amounts, especially in terms of defining the effects of DNA sequence context on the quantity and location of the damage. For example, ionizing radiation causes DNA damage by oxidation through both “direct” (non-scavengeable) and “indirect” (scavengeable) pathways, in roughly equal proportions that affect both the base and 2-deoxyribose components (2von Sonntag C. The Chemical Basis of Radiation Biology. Taylor & Francis, New York1987Google Scholar, 3Roots R. Okada S. Radiat. Res. 1975; 64: 306-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 4Jones G.D.

The indirect pathway is mediated mainly by products of water radiolysis such as hydroxyl radicals that react with DNA by hydrogen atom abstraction from the 2-deoxyribose moiety to produce strand breaks and abasic sites, and by addition to nucleobases to form a variety of damage products (5Becker D. Sevilla M.D. Adv. Radiat. Biol. 1993; 17: 121-180Crossref Google Scholar, 6Cadet J. Delatour T. Douki T. Gasparutto D. Pouget J.P. Ravanat J.L. Sauvaigo S. Mutat.

The direct effect of γ-radiation entails energy deposition that leads to ionization of the DNA nucleobases and the sugar-phosphate backbone, again leading to base damage and strand breaks (5Becker D. Sevilla M.D. Adv. Radiat. Biol. 1993; 17: 121-180Crossref Google Scholar). This complicated mixture of sugar and base damage produced by strong oxidants in DNA has hampered studies of the sequence selectivity of nucleobase oxidation, which is critical for defining the contributions of charge transfer to the spectrum of DNA lesions and for quantifying influences of local DNA structure on the final spectrum of damage products. The role of charge transfer in oxidatively damaged DNA has been well characterized in model systems involving direct photooxidation reactions (8Yang X. Wang X.B. Vorpagel E.R. Wang L.S. Proc. Natl.

This high background of strand breaks complicates analysis of the sequence selectivity of base oxidation and necessitates the use of indirect approaches in studies of charge transfer with ionizing radiation, such as the use of easily ionized base analogs. For example, Doddridge et al. (26Doddridge Z.A. Cullis P.M. Jones G. D.D. Malone M.E. J. Am. Chem.

The use of such base analogs in solution studies with ionizing radiation, however, is complicated by artifacts such as the generation of secondary radical-mediated oxidizing species from the quenching agents used to obviate the indirect effects (27Ding H. Greenberg M.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 772-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). DNA damage by strong oxidants yields a mixture of strand breaks and base damage, thereby greatly complicating sequence-specific analysis of nucleobase oxidation. To address this problem, we have developed a gel-based method that allows quantification of nucleobase damage in oxidized DNA by exploiting Escherichia coli exonuclease III (ExoIII) to remove fragments containing direct strand breaks and abasic sites. The rigor of the method was verified in studies of G oxidation by riboflavin-mediated photooxidation or nitrosoperoxycarbonate (ONOOCO2-), for which dramatically different effects of sequence context have been demonstrated by other approaches (12Saito I.

Using γ-radiation and Fe2+-EDTA, the method was applied to test the hypothesis that hydroxyl radical-induced guanine oxidation would not be affected by sequence context because of the predominance of oxidation pathways other than one-electron oxidation to form G radical cations. Materials—Phosphorothioate-modified oligodeoxynucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) and gel-purified. All other reagents and chemicals were used without further purification. [γ-32P]ATP with activity of 6000 Ci/mmol was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Piperidine, ferrous sulfate, riboflavin, and 30! (w/w) hydrogen peroxide solution were purchased from Sigma. All enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). Chelex-100 was purchased from Bio-Rad. Potassium phosphate, sodium bicarbonate, and EDTA were purchased from VWR (West Chester, PA). Peroxynitrite solution was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Distilled and deionized water was purified using a Milli-Q system from Millipore (Bedford, MA) and was used for all experiments. Labeling and Annealing of Oligodeoxynucleotides—Purified single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides were 5′-end-labeled with 32P by incubation at 37 °C for 1 h in a reaction that contained 0.2 nmol of 5′ ends, 0.1 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 40 units of T4 PNK in 1× PNK buffer, in a total volume of 100 μl. Excess label was removed by gel filtration using Sephadex G-25 columns (Roche Diagnostics) that were washed four times with a volume of 300 μl of Chelex-treated 175 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). For annealing reaction, a total of 0.4 nmol of unlabeled complement was added to each purified labeled oligodeoxynucleotide; the mixture was heated at 95 °C for 5 min and was then allowed to slowly cool to room temperature over the course of 2 h. Analysis of Damage in Double-stranded Oligodeoxynucleotides—All damage analyses and controls were performed in three separate experiments. Each Fenton reaction contained 2 mm hydrogen peroxide (concentration determined using an extinction coefficient of 39.4 m-1 cm-1), 20 pmol of labeled, double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide, and 0.1 mm FeSO4/EDTA (in the ratio of 1:1.1, freshly prepared before each experiment), in 175 mm Chelex-treated potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and a total volume of 50 μl. The DNA was always added last, and the controls contained potassium phosphate buffer instead of FeSO4/EDTA solution. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, after which Fenton reagent was removed by filtration through Sephadex G-25 columns. For γ-irradiation experiments, the samples containing a total of 20 pmol of labeled, double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide in a total of 50 μl of Chelex-treated 175 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) were irradiated in a 60Co source for a total dose of 50 gray. Following treatment, the samples were incubated at ambient temperature for 20 min before purification by filtration using Sephadex G-25 columns. Studies of oligodeoxynucleotide damage by ONOOCO2- and riboflavin were performed according to the procedure described previously (28Margolin Y. Cloutier J.F. Shafirovich V. Geacintov N.E. Dedon P.C.

Damaged and purified oligodeoxynucleotides were treated with 5 units of ExoIII in 1× NE buffer 1 (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) at 37 °C for 1 h in a total volume of 60 μl. These conditions were sufficient to remove all direct strand breaks generated during damage reactions, as determined by control experiments (results not shown). For hot piperidine treatment, oligodeoxynucleotides were desalted by gel filtration, incubated with 1 m piperidine at 90 °C in a total volume of 120 μl, lyophilized, and dissolved in a total of 5 μl of formamide gel loading buffer (28Margolin Y.

To remove ExoIII activity prior to Fpg reactions, oligodeoxynucleotides were incubated with 20 mm EDTA to chelate Mg2+ present in 1× NE buffer 1 and passed through protein-binding Micropure-EZ filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The oligodeoxynucleotides were subsequently treated with 8 units of Fpg at 37 °C for 1 h, precipitated with ethanol, and dissolved in a total of 5 μl of formamide gel loading buffer. A total of 2 μl of each sample was resolved on a 20! polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea and was subjected to PhosphorImager analysis (ImageQuant, GE Healthcare). Relative reactivities of Gs in each oligodeoxynucleotide sequence were determined as described previously (28Margolin Y. Cloutier J.F. Shafirovich V. Geacintov N.E. Dedon P.C. Nat. Chem.

Dedon P.C. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 365-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The major limitation of this approach is interference from direct strand breaks and labile abasic sites arising from 2-deoxyribose oxidation with agents such as γ-radiation and Fenton chemistry that damage both the base and sugar moieties (29Dedon P.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2008; 21: 206-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). To resolve this problem, we devised a method to remove interfering direct strand breaks and abasic sites and thus allow for the direct analysis of nucleobase oxidation, as illustrated in Fig. 1A. The method utilizes double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (Table 1) containing three consecutive phosphorothioate linkages at the 3′ end of each strand to protect the strands from degradation by the 3′-to-5′-exonuclease activity of ExoIII (30Putney S.D. Benkovic S.J. Schimmel P.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7350-7354Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 31Greenberg M.M. Weledji Y.N. Kim J. Bales B.C. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8178-8183Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Upon treatment of damaged oligodeoxynucleotides with the combined 3′-to-5′-exonuclease and AP endonuclease activities of ExoIII (30Putney S.D. Benkovic S.J. Schimmel P.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7350-7354Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 31Greenberg M.M. Weledji Y.N. Kim J. Bales B.C. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8178-8183Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the oligodeoxynucleotides that contain abasic sites and direct strand breaks with unprotected 3′ ends are degraded, and the resulting 32P-containing small fragments are either lost during processing of the oligodeoxynucleotides or during sequencing gel electrophoresis (see supplemental Fig. 1 for a typical gel). The remaining full-length, 5′-32P-labeled oligodeoxynucleotides are protected from ExoIII degradation by the phosphorothioates at the 3′ end and are either undamaged or contain only nucleobase damage. Following inactivation (chelation of Mg2+ cofactor by EDTA; see Ref. 32Kow Y.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3280-3287Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and removal of the enzyme by passing the reaction mixture through protein-binding filters, the nucleobase damage is converted to strand breaks by treatment with hot piperidine or Fpg. Sequencing gel analysis now reveals the location and quantity of nucleobase damage caused by the oxidizing agent, without interference from direct strand breaks or abasic sites.TABLE 1Sequences of oligodeoxynucleotides used for damage analysis Target guanines are in boldface type, and trinucleotide motifs are underlined.

The first set of studies was designed to assess the effects of ExoIII digestion on the nucleobase damage produced by two oxidants, riboflavin-mediated photooxidation and ONOOCO2-, that cause well defined G oxidation in terms of quantity and location and that cause few strand breaks or abasic sites (28Margolin Y. Cloutier J.F. Shafirovich V. Geacintov N.E. Dedon P.C. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 365-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The studies were conducted in a series of oligodeoxynucleotides (shown in Table 1) with the following general structure: 5′-CGTACTCTTTGGTX1G1Y1TX2G2Y2TTCTTTC*T*A*T-3′. Each contains three consecutive phosphorothioate linkages (asterisks), two Gs in variable three-nucleotide sequence contexts (XiGiYi), and an invariant TGG damage site for normalizing damage levels across all of the oligodeoxynucleotides (12Saito I. Nakamura T. Nakatani K. Yoshioka Y. Yamaguchi K. Sugiyama H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 12686-12687Crossref Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 28Margolin Y. Cloutier J.F. Shafirovich V. Geacintov N.E. Dedon P.C. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 365-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Following treatment of duplex oligodeoxynucleotides with either 3 mm ONOOCO2- or 30 μm riboflavin/366 nm irradiation (28Margolin Y. Cloutier J.F. Shafirovich V. Geacintov N.E. Dedon P.C. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 365-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), samples were split, and one-half was treated with ExoIII for 60 min. Following inactivation and removal of ExoIII, the oligodeoxynucleotides were treated with hot piperidine, and the resulting strand breaks were quantified by sequencing gel analysis, as illustrated in Fig. 1B. The bar graphs shown in Fig. 2 reveal that the quantity of G oxidation detected by the sequencing gel method is not affected by ExoIII treatment, which indicates that the ExoIII digestion step did not introduce artifacts into the quantification of sequence-selective G oxidation in the oligodeoxynucleotides. The results are also consistent with our previous studies, in which the level of riboflavin-mediated oxidation of G varied inversely with the sequence-specific IP of the central G in a three-nucleotide context (relative G oxidation in decreasing order CGG > GGC > CGT > TGC), whereas the opposite was true for ONOOCO2- (TGC ∼ GGC > CGT > CGG) (28Margolin Y. Cloutier J.F. Shafirovich V. Geacintov N.E. Dedon P.C. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 365-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A second approach to validating the ExoIII digestion method entailed characterization of G oxidation in an oligodeoxynucleotide treated with Fe2+-EDTA/H2O2, an agent well known to oxidize 2-deoxyribose to produce strand breaks and abasic sites at all positions in DNA (29Dedon P.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2008; 21: 206-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 33Price M.A. Tullius T.D. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 212: 194-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and to oxidize nucleobases (7Frelon S. Douki T. Favier A. Cadet J. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 2002; I: 2866-2870Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 34Murata-Kamiya N. Kamiya H. Muraoka M. Kaji H. Kasai H. J. Radiat. Res. 1997; 38: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, Fe2+-EDTA/H2O2 produced a significant quantity of strand breaks at all positions in the oligodeoxynucleotide (Fig. 1B, lane 2), with the doublet band pattern in the gel image arising from differential migration of oligodeoxynucleotide fragments containing 3-phosphate and 3′-phosphoglycolate ends (35Dedon P.C. Goldberg I.H. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 311-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 36Balasubramanian B. Pogozelski W.K. Tullius T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9738-9743Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Incubation of the damaged oligodeoxynucleotide with ExoIII prior to hot piperidine treatment substantially diminished the background of direct strand breaks and revealed damage mainly at Gs (Fig. 1B, lane 4). The combined results of these validation studies indicate that ExoIII is effective at removing strand breaks and oxidized abasic sites without interfering with nucleobase damage. Assessment of the Sequence Selectivity of G Oxidation Produced by γ-Radiation and Fe+2-EDTA/H2O2—The ExoIII digestion and sequencing gel method was employed to define the role of sequence context in hydroxyl radical-mediated G oxidation, with comparison to one-electron oxidation by riboflavin-mediated photooxidation. The studies were initiated by performing damage reactions with each of the 32P-labeled, double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides shown in Table 1 in 175 mm metal-free phosphate buffer at pH 7.4. Optimal doses for γ-irradiation (60Co, 1.1 gray/min) and Fe2+-EDTA/H2O2 treatment were chosen to produce a range of quantifiable damage signals from the sequencing gels and to cause a maximum of one detectable"
https://openalex.org/W2062862555,"The polypeptide core of the integrin beta1 subunit (beta1) is glycosylated sequentially in the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex to form beta1 precursor and mature beta1, respectively. The beta1 precursor to mature beta1 conversion, termed beta1 maturation, regulates the cell surface levels and function of beta1-containing integrins, beta1 integrins. Here we demonstrate that the human alkaline ceramidase 2 (ACER2), a Golgi enzyme, regulates beta1 maturation by controlling the generation of sphingosine. ACER2 overexpression inhibited beta1 maturation, thus leading to a decrease in the levels of mature beta1 in T-REx HeLa cells, whereas RNA interference-mediated knockdown of ACER2 enhanced beta1 maturation in MCF-7 cells. ACER2 overexpression decreased the cell surface levels of beta1 integrins, thus inhibiting cell adhesion to fibronectin or collagen, whereas ACER2 knockdown has the opposite effects. Treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) increased both the expression of ACER2 and the generation of sphingosine in HeLa cells and inhibited beta1 maturation. ACER2 knockdown attenuated the inhibitory effects of ATRA on both beta1 maturation and cell adhesion. In contrast, treatment with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), a protein kinase C activator, decreased the expression of ACER2 and sphingosine in T-REx HeLa cells, thus enhancing beta1 maturation. ACER2 overexpression inhibited the stimulatory effects of PMA on both beta1 maturation and cell adhesion. These results suggest that the ACER2/sphingosine pathway plays an important role in regulating beta1 maturation and cell adhesion mediated by beta1 integrins."
https://openalex.org/W2071629773,"The trypsin-like serine protease marapsin is a member of the large protease gene cluster at human chromosome 16p13.3, which also contains the structurally related proteases testisin, tryptase ε, tryptase γ, and EOS. To gain insight into the biological functions of marapsin, we undertook a detailed gene expression analysis. It showed that marapsin expression was restricted to tissues containing stratified squamous epithelia and was absent or only weakly expressed in all other tissues, including the pancreas. Marapsin was constitutively expressed in nonkeratinizing stratified squamous epithelia of human esophagus, tonsil, cervix, larynx, and cornea. In the keratinizing stratified squamous epidermis of skin, however, its expression was induced only during epidermal hyperproliferation, such as in psoriasis and in murine wound healing. In fact, marapsin was the second most strongly up-regulated protease in psoriatic lesions, where expression was localized to the upper region of the hyperplastic epidermis. Similarly, in the hyperproliferative epithelium of regenerating murine skin wounds, marapsin localized to the suprabasal layers, where keratinocytes undergo squamous differentiation. The transient up-regulation of marapsin, which closely correlated with re-epithelialization, was virtually absent in a genetic mouse model of delayed wound closure. These results suggested a function during the process of re-epithelialization. Furthermore, in reconstituted human epidermis, a model system of epidermal differentiation, members of the IL-20 subfamily of cytokines, such as IL-22, induced marapsin expression. Consistent with a physiologic role in marapsin regulation, IL-22 was also strongly expressed in re-epithelializing skin wounds. Marapsin’s restricted expression, localization, and cytokine-inducible expression suggest a role in the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes in hyperproliferating squamous epithelia.

Marapsin’s restricted expression, localization, and cytokine-inducible expression suggest a role in the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes in hyperproliferating squamous epithelia. Marapsin (PRSS27; also known as pancreasin) is a trypsin-like serine protease and member of the large serine protease gene cluster at human chromosome 16p13.3 and mouse chromosome 17A3.3, respectively (1Wong G.W. Yasuda S. Madhusudhan M.S. Li L. Yang Y. Krilis S.A. Sali A. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49169-49182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 2Wong G.W. Yasuda S. Morokawa N. Li L. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2438-2452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Based on conserved features of the propeptides and the activation mechanism, these proteases were divided into two groups (2Wong G.W. Yasuda S. Morokawa N. Li L. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2438-2452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Marapsin belongs to the group-1 subfamily of the human cluster, which includes testisin (PRSS21, eosinophil serine protease-1), tryptase ε (PRSS22, brain-specific serine protease-4), tryptase γ (PRSS31, transmembrane tryptase), and EOS (PRSS33). They all contain a relatively short propeptide, which, after activation cleavage of the single chain precursor, remains attached to the protease domain via a disulfide bond. In contrast, the propeptides of group-2 subfamily members tryptase α, tryptase β1, tryptase β2, and tryptase δ are not disulfide-linked to the protease domain and are released upon activation cleavage. The 268-amino acid single-chain precursor form (zymogen) of human marapsin is converted into the active enzyme by proteolytic cleavage at the Arg34-Met35 peptide bond. The Met residue at the newly formed N terminus is conserved among different species (3Bhagwandin V.J. Hau L.W. Mallen-St Clair J. Wolters P.J. Caughey G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3363-3371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) but is highly unusual for trypsin-like serine proteases, which in most cases have an Ile or Val at this position. Another serine protease with an Arg-Met activation cleavage site is human elastase 2B (4Kawashima I. Tani T. Shimoda K. Takiguchi Y. DNA. 1987; 6: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), which, unlike marapsin, is completely devoid of enzymatic activity (5Szepessy E. Sahin-Toth M. Pancreatology. 2006; 6: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Human marapsin is secreted, whereas mouse marapsin is tethered to the cell surface by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (6Wong G.W. Stevens R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 336: 579-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). It can be released from the cell surface by phospholipase C (6Wong G.W. Stevens R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 336: 579-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), suggesting that the regulation of mouse and human marapsin may be different. The function of marapsin in normal physiology and pathology has not yet been elucidated. So far, gene expression studies have sampled relatively few human or mouse tissues. One study found marapsin expression primarily in pancreas, hence the name “pancreasin” (3Bhagwandin V.J. Hau L.W. Mallen-St Clair J. Wolters P.J. Caughey G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3363-3371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). More recently, Adachi et al. (7Adachi W. Ulanovsky H. Li Y. Norman B. Davis J. Piatigorsky J. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2006; 47: 3801-3810Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) identified marapsin in the rat cornea, which agrees with an earlier study by Wong et al. (2Wong G.W. Yasuda S. Morokawa N. Li L. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2438-2452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) showing strong marapsin mRNA expression in the mouse eye. To further explore the biological functions of marapsin, we initially utilized gene expression analysis of a wide range of human and mouse tissues. The unexpected restriction of marapsin expression to stratified squamous epithelia prompted further studies on its potential regulation in inflamed and hyperproliferative epidermis. The studies provided new insight into its regulation, potential function, and a link to the immune system. Reagents—Total RNA from human pancreas was purchased from different suppliers (Clontech, BioChain, Stratagene, Ambion, U. S. Biologicals, and Chemicon). Human and mouse total RNA adult tissue panels were purchased from Clontech and Zyagen, respectively. Microarray Gene Expression Analysis—Expression data were obtained from the GeneExpress compendium by GeneLogic (Gaithersburg, MD). This data set includes microarray data of clinical samples from a variety of normal and diseased tissues assayed on the Affymetrix HG-U133A and HG-U133B GeneChips. Samples were identified from various tissues where the sample was determined to be normal, both by clinical history and by pathological quality control. The resulting 4138 samples included 94 adipose, 14 adrenal, 78 blood vessel, 7 bone, 6 bone marrow, 2333 brain, 22 breast, 112 cervix, 86 colorectal, 27 endometrium, 28 esophagus, 10 gallbladder, 154 heart, 32 kidney, 4 larynx, 65 liver, 26 lung, 73 lymphoid, 84 muscle, 166 myometrium, 29 nerve, 76 ovary, 51 pancreas, 71 prostate, 68 skin, 190 small intestine, 72 stomach, 8 testis, 69 thymus, 28 thyroid, 9 urinary, and 46 white blood cells. The probe set 232074_at on the HG-U133B GeneChip measured expression for marapsin, as determined both by available annotation and by aligning the probe set to the human genome. All microarray data were measured using signal intensity from Affymetrix Microarray Analysis Suite version 5. The data were plotted and observed to show a predominance of expression at zero, with a few tissues having samples with larger expression values. A plot of the density of the data on a log scale showed the distribution to have a long tail starting at a signal intensity of ∼100, which corresponded approximately to the 98th percentile of 108.6 (supplemental Fig. S1). Samples with positive expression was determined to be those in the top 2 percentile of expression. To evaluate the expression of marapsin and other proteases in psoriasis, samples were obtained from seven cases of psoriatic skin, seven corresponding patches of nonlesional skin, and six cases of normal skin. One nonlesional sample was excluded on the basis of preliminary microarray gene expression that suggested that it was highly contaminated with adjacent lesional tissue. Samples were run on Affymetrix HG-U133A and HG-U133B GeneChips, and expression values were measured by signal intensity from Affymetrix Microarray Analysis Suite version 5. Samples were further normalized by using Robust Multi-chip Average (RMA) quantile normalization. Affymetrix probe sets corresponding to proteases were selected as those listed under Gene Ontology molecular function category 0008233 (Peptidase Activity), as tabulated by Gene Ontology Annotation (GOA), EntrezGene, or Affymetrix NetAffx. This method identified a total of 1197 probe sets corresponding to 547 unique protease genes. Probe sets were ranked by the fold change of the mean expression value among protease samples compared with the mean expression value among nonprotease samples. In cases where a gene had multiple probe sets, the probe set with the highest absolute -fold change was used. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Human and Mouse Marapsin—Human and mouse marapsin were cloned from human and mouse cDNA libraries, respectively. C-terminal His8-tagged full-length human marapsin (Met1-Lys290-AAA-His8) and a soluble form of mouse marapsin comprising the extracellular domain (Met1-Gln292-His8) were produced in a CHO 2The abbreviations used are: CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; RT, reverse transcription; RHE, reconstituted human epidermis; IFN-γ, interferon-γ; TGF-α, transforming growth factor-α; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; IL, interleukin; FAM, 6-carboxyfluorescein; TAMRA, 6-carboxy-tetramethyl-rhodamine. cell transient expression system using mammalian expression vectors driven by cytomegalovirus promoters. Recombinant proteins were purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic affinity chromatography. Precharged nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) was added to supernatants from conditioned medium, batch absorption was performed by gently stirring at 4 °C for 16 h. After allowing the resin to settle for 1 h, the supernatant was decanted, and the resin was packed into a column. The column was washed with a minimum of 10 column volumes of phosphate-buffered saline, 0.3 m NaCl, pH 7.4, followed by 10 column volumes of phosphate-buffered saline, 25 mm imidazole, 0.3 m NaCl, 1 mm sodium azide, pH 7.4. Proteins were eluted with phosphate-buffered saline, 250 mm imidazole, 0.3 m NaCl, 1 mm sodium azide, pH 7.4. Pooled fractions were purified further using a size exclusion chromatographic step. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Generation of Anti-marapsin Antibodies—Polyclonal antibodies against human marapsin were generated by injecting 0.5 mg of recombinant protein into each rabbit (Josman LLC, Napa, CA). Rabbit sera with highest titers (from bleeds at weeks 6, 8, 10, and 11) were pooled, and antibodies purified by protein A affinity chromatography. BALB/c mice (for anti-human marapsin monoclonals) or Armenian hamsters (for anti-mouse marapsin monoclonals) were immunized by repeated footpad injections of recombinant human marapsin or mouse marapsin resuspended in monophosphoryl lipid A/trehalose dicorynomycolate adjuvant (Corixa Corp., Seattle, WA). Three days after the final boost, poptileal lymph nodes were fused with subclones of mouse myeloma cell line P3X63AgU.1 (ATCC CRL1597, Manassas, VA) using polyethylene glycol. Hybridomas were selected using methylcellulose-based hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine medium (ClonaCell Medium-D, StemCell Technologies, Van-couver, Canada). Ten days postfusion, culture supernatants were collected and screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for specific binding to recombinant human or murine marapsin. The selected hybridomas were then cloned by limiting dilution. The mouse anti-human marapsin antibody 3G8 and the hamster anti-mouse marapsin antibody 3B2 were purified from hybridoma culture supernatants by affinity chromatography. Immunoaffinity Purification of Marapsin from Culture Supernatants—The human pancreatic carcinoma cell lines HPAC, HPAF, BxPC3, and Capan-2 were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and cultured according to ATCC recommendations. The human esophageal squamous epithelial cell line Het-1A was obtained from ATCC and cultured in Bronchial Epithelial Growth Medium (BEGM BulletKit, Cambrex, East Rutherford, NJ). Culture supernatants harvested 72 h after serum-free treatment were cleared by centrifugation for 15 min at 13,000 × g and concentrated 50-fold in the presence of 10 μg/ml complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C. Protein immunoaffinity purification was carried out with 10 μg of monoclonal anti-human marapsin antibody 3G8 for 3 h at 4°C. Subsequently, 40 μl of protein A/G-agarose (GE Healthcare) was added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing with lysis buffer (10 mm Tris pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol), protein was eluted with Immuno-pure elution buffer (Pierce) and neutralized with 1 m Tris, pH 8.0. Samples were denatured for 5 min at 95 °C in SDS sample buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 5% 2-β-mercaptoethanol) and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Invitrogen). The membranes were incubated with SuperBlock™ blocking buffer (Pierce) for 2 h at room temperature. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody (5 μg/ml polyclonal anti-marapsin antibody) in blocking buffer. Membranes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, followed by horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (donkey anti-rabbit, Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive bands were visualized on x-ray film by the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting system (GE Healthcare). Real Time RT-PCR—Human psoriatic and normal skin specimens (lesional and nonlesional psoriatic skin was obtained from Dr. James Krueger, Rockefeller University; normal skin was obtained from commercial sources) and mouse skin tissues were homogenized by TissueLyser (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Fibrous Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen). Gene expression analysis was performed by real time RT-PCR (TaqMan) on a model 7500 sequence detector (ABI-PerkinElmer, Foster City, CA). The sequences of primers and probes were as follows: human marapsin, forward (5′-TGCCCTTCACCAATTACATC-3′), reverse (5′-CAGTTCATGCCCGTCTCA-3′), probe (5′-(FAM)-CTGCCTGACCCCTCGGTGATCT-(TAMRA)-3′); human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, forward (5′-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC-3′), reverse (5′-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3′), probe (5′-(FAM)-CAAGCTTCCCGTTCTCAGCC-(TAMRA)-3′); mouse marapsin, forward (5′-TCACAAATGGATCCACCAA-3′), reverse (5′-GCTGACCTTGGGAGTCTTTT-3′), probe (5′-(FAM)-CTGGGTGCCTGCTCTCCCCT-(TAMRA)-3′); mouse cytokeratin-16, forward (5′-GTCCATCCTCAAGGAGCAA-3′), reverse (5′-TTAGTCCCTGGAACTCTGACTTT-3′), probe (5′-(FAM)-TTCAACCAGCTTCAGCCAGAGCC-(TAMRA)-3′); mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, forward (5′-GGCATTGCTCTCAATGACAA-3′), reverse (5′-CTGTTGCTGTAGCCGTATTCA-3′), probe (5′-(FAM)-TGTCATACCAGGAAATGAGCTTGACAAAG-(TAMRA)-3′). The reverse transcription was carried out at 48 °C for 30 min, followed by heat activation of AmpliTaq Gold at 95 °C for 10 min. The thermal cycling proceeded with 40 cycles of 95 °C for 0.5 min and 60 °C for 1 min. The results were quantified using the standard curve method according to the manufacturer’s instructions (ABI-PerkinElmer). All gene expression levels were normalized to the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Reverse Transcription PCR (RT-PCR)—Total RNA was isolated from human pancreatic specimens obtained from commercial sources, confluent HPAC, HPAF, BxPC3, Capan-2, and Het-1A cells using the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen). For RT-PCR analysis of marapsin mRNA, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed by using the kit SUPERSCRIPT™ first strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). The sequences of primers and probes were as follows: human marapsin, forward (5′-GCGGTGCCGCTCCTGCT-3′), reverse (5′-ACCGAGGGGTCAGGCAGGC-3′); mouse marapsin, forward (5′-ATCGCTGCCCTGCTGCT-3′), reverse (5′-ACCGAGGGATCAGGAAGGC-3′). Human β-actin, forward (5′-TCACCCACACTGTGCCCATCTACGA-3′), reverse (5′-ACCGAGGGGTCAGGCAGGC-3′); mouse β-actin, forward (5′-TGTGATGGTGGGAATGGGTCAG-3′), reverse (5′-TTTGATGTCACGCACGATTTCC-3′). The optimal temperature cycling protocol was determined to be 95 °C for 45 s, 65 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 60 s for 25 cycles with a programmable thermocycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences model 9600). PCR products were analyzed on a 3% agarose gel with ethidium bromide. Marapsin Immunohistochemistry and in Situ Hybridization—Immunohistochemistry was performed on 4-μm thick formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections of mouse esophagus, cornea, and cutaneous wound. All staining procedures were carried out at room temperature. Sections were deparaffinized and hydrated with distilled water. Slides were incubated for 20 min at 99 °C in Target Retrieval Solution (Dako, Carpinteria, CA). Endogenous peroxidase was quenched using a blocking buffer (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD), and avidin and biotin were quenched by use of an avidin/biotin kit (Vector, Burlingame, CA), respectively. The sections were incubated in 10% goat blocking serum, followed by a specific hamster anti-mouse marapsin monoclonal antibody 3B2 at 0.9 μg/ml for 60 min. After washing, sections were incubated with biotinylated secondary goat anti-hamster IgG(H + L) (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 30 min. Positive staining was detected using Vectastain ABC Elite reagents (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 30 min and metal-enhanced diaminobenzidine (Pierce) for 5 min and then counterstained with hematoxylin. For in situ hybridization, PCR primers were designed to amplify a 475-bp fragment of human marapsin spanning from nucleotide 443 to 917 of the human marapsin reference sequence NM_031948 (forward, 5′-CAGAGGGCCAAGGCAGCAACA-3′; reverse, 5′-GCGGTTCGGGCAGGAGGTCT-3′). Primers included extensions encoding 27-nucleotide T7 or T3 RNA polymerase initiation sites to allow in vitro transcription of sense or antisense probes, respectively, from the amplified products. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of lesional and nonlesional psoriatic skin (obtained from Dr. James Krueger, Rockefeller University) and normal human esophagus, tonsil, and cervix (obtained from commercial sources) were sectioned at 5-μm thickness, deparaffinized, deproteinated with 10 μg/ml Proteinase K for 30 min at 37 °C, and further processed for in situ hybridization, as previously described (8Jubb A.M. Pham T.Q. Frantz G.D. Peale Jr., F.V. Hillan K.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 326: 255-264PubMed Google Scholar). [33P]UTP-labeled sense and antisense probes were hybridized to the sections at 55 °C overnight. The unhybridized probe was removed by incubation with 20 μg/ml RNase A for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by a high stringency wash at 55 °C in 0.1× SSC for 2 h and dehydration through graded ethanols. The slides were dipped in NTB nuclear track emulsion (Eastman Kodak Co.), exposed in sealed plastic slide boxes containing desiccant for 4 weeks at 4 °C, developed, and counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin. Marapsin Expression in Cutaneous Wound Healing—The wound healing experiments were carried out as described by Gailano et al. (9Galiano R.D. Michaels J. Dobryansky M. Levine J.P. Gurtner G.C.

The wounds were covered with an occlusive dressing throughout the entire experiment as described (9Galiano R.D. Michaels J. Dobryansky M. Levine J.P. Gurtner G.C.

At different time points, animals were euthanized with isoflurane/CO2, and wounds were excised (8-mm punch) and snap-frozen. Portions of the tissues were either processed for immunohistochemistry or used for RNA quantification (see “Real Time RT-PCR”). In a separate experiment, wound tissues were collected on day 0 and on postwounding day 7 for determining gene expression of IL-20 subfamily cytokines. RNA from tissues was isolated and used for a microarray analysis on Agilent Chips. Data were analyzed using in-house bioinformatics and analysis tools. Protocols for the animal experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Genentech Inc. and were performed according to the guidelines of the United States Department of Agriculture Animal Welfare Act. Reconstituted Human Epidermis (RHE) Tissue Model—Experiments with the EpiDerm RHE tissue model (MatTek) were carried out as described previously (11Sa S.M. Valdez P.A. Wu J. Jung K. Zhong F. Hall L. Kasman I. Winer J. Modrusan Z. Danilenko D.M. Ouyang W. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 2229-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Recombinant human cytokines and growth factors were from R&D Systems: IL-19, IL-20, IL-22, IL-24, IL-26, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α). They were added to RHE in 6-well plates in a total volume of 5 ml of EPI-100-NMM medium (MatTek). Medium was changed every other day with fresh cytokines/growth factors added. The concentrations used for each IL-20 subfamily member was 20 ng/ml; TNF-α and IFN-γ were used at 10 ng/ml, and TGF-α was used at 6 ng/ml. At various time points, RHE tissues were harvested and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. After homogenization (Omni H-01 with sawtooth blade), total RNA was prepared using the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) with DNase treatment. For real time RT-PCR, 50 ng of total RNA was run using the following primers and probes for human marapsin and housekeeping gene RPL19, directed against exon boundaries: marapsin, forward (5′-AAGAATGACATGCTGTGCGC-3′), reverse (5′-CCCGAGTCGCCCTTGC-3′), probe (5′-(FAM)-CTTCGAGGAGGGCAAGAAGGATGCC-(TAMRA)-3′); RPL19, forward (5′-CAATGCCAACTCCCGTCAG-3′), reverse (5′-GTCACAGGCTTGCGGATGA-3′), probe (5′-(FAM)-AGATCCGGAAGCTCATCAAAGATGGGCT-(TAMRA)-3′). One-step RT-PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) was used, and reactions were run on the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector. Results for samples purified from three separate RHE tissues were normalized to the human RPL19 housekeeping gene and expressed as relative -fold change compared with T0 using the comparative Ct method according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA samples from 48 h of treatment were also used to perform microarray analysis as described (11Sa S.M. Valdez P.A. Wu J. Jung K. Zhong F. Hall L. Kasman I. Winer J. Modrusan Z. Danilenko D.M. Ouyang W. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 2229-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Marapsin Is Expressed in Stratified Squamous Epithelia—Microarray analysis of normal human tissues revealed that marapsin expression was highly specific (Fig. 1). Of the 4138 tissue samples across 32 different tissues, only 82 samples (13 tissues) gave a positive expression signal, defined as being within the 98th percentile of signal intensities. Larynx, esophagus, and cervix were the tissues with the highest percentage of positive samples (range: 100 to 25.9%), whereas the previously reported pancreas (3Bhagwandin V.J. Hau L.W. Mallen-St Clair J. Wolters P.J. Caughey G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3363-3371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) had only 11.8% positive samples (supplemental Table S1). A stricter definition of positive expression at the 99th percentile (signal intensity 473.2) reduced the number of positive tissues to larynx, esophagus, and cervix. These results were further substantiated by RT-PCR experiments using human and mouse tissue panels. Marapsin was found in the esophagus and cervix/vagina (larynx was not available) but not in any other tissue (Fig. 2A). The low prevalence of marapsin expression in pancreas by RT-PCR and the relatively low expression level in the microarray experiment was unexpected, since marapsin was reported to be highly expressed in pancreas (3Bhagwandin V.J. Hau L.W. Mallen-St Clair J. Wolters P.J. Caughey G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3363-3371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Therefore, we measured marapsin expression by RT-PCR in additional specimens of human pancreas obtained from commercial sources. Marapsin was only detected in 1 of 12 samples (Fig. 2B, lane 6), which was in good agreement with the 6 of 51 positive samples detected in the microarray analysis (98th percentile signal intensity). Furthermore, we tested the four pancreatic cell lines, BxPC3, Capan-2, HPAC, and HPAF. These cell lines are derived from ductal carcinomas and, thus, are distinct from the secretory cuboidal epithelium that makes up pancreatic glandular acini (see below). The results showed very weak expression by HPAC and HPAF cells and no expression by BxPC3 and Capan-2 cells. In contrast, strong marapsin expression was found in the esophageal cell line Het-1A, similar to esophageal tissue (Fig. 2C). A monoclonal antibody against purified human recombinant marapsin (Fig. 2D; Mr ∼ 40,000) was generated and employed for immunoprecipitation experiments using culture supernatants. In agreement with the RNA measurements, a significant amount of marapsin protein (Mr ∼40,000) was secreted by the esophageal cell line Het-1A, whereas no secreted protein was detected of the four pancreatic cell lines (Fig. 2E).FIGURE 2Marapsin expression in human and mouse tissues and cell lines.

B, lack of marapsin expression in commercial human pancreas samples (lanes 1–6 and 7–12) determined as in A. Esophagus and cervix served as positive controls. One commercial sample (lane 6) showed weak expression.

Both its C2 domains (C2A and C2B) are able to bind phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, a key player in the neurotransmitter release process. The rabphilin-3A C2A domain has previously been shown to bind inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3; phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate headgroup) in a Ca2+-dependent manner with a relatively high affinity (50 μm) in the presence of saturating concentrations of Ca2+. Moreover, IP3 and Ca2+ binding to the C2A domain mutually enhance each other. Here we present the Ca2+-bound solution structure of the C2A domain. Structural comparison with the previously published Ca2+-free crystal structure revealed that Ca2+ binding induces a conformational change of Ca2+ binding loop 3 (CBL3). Our IP3 binding studies as well as our IP3-C2A docking model show the active involvement of CBL3 in IP3 binding, suggesting that the conformational change on CBL3 upon Ca2+ binding enables the interaction with IP3 and vice versa, in line with a target-activated messenger affinity mechanism. Our data provide detailed structural insight into the functional properties of the rabphilin-3A C2A domain and reveal for the first time the structural determinants of a target-activated messenger affinity mechanism.

C2 domains are ubiquitous protein modules initially identified in protein kinase C (1Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3535) Google Scholar). They all consist of ∼130 residues (2Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar) and share a common fold composed of two four-stranded β-sheets arranged in a compact β-sandwich and surrounded by variable loops and helices. C2 domain-containing proteins such as phospholipase C, cytosolic phospholipase A2, or protein kinase C are generally involved in signal transduction or membrane trafficking. The main function of the C2 domains in these proteins appears to be the targeting to biological membranes via their Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding properties (3Verdaguer N. Corbalan-Garcia S. Ochoa W.F. Fita I. Gomez-Fernandez J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6329-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Primary lipid targets are phosphatidylcholine (for cytosolic phospholipase A2 (4Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J.

Although not known to be classical phosphoinositide binding modules, some C2 domains have been shown to interact rather specifically with phosphoinositides (phospholipase C, protein kinase Cα), especially phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) 3The abbreviations used are:PIP2phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphateIP3inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphateCBRCa2+ binding regionCBLCa2+ binding loopHSQCheteronuclear single quantum correlationNOESYnuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) spectroscopyr.m.s.d.root mean square deviationRDCresidual dipolar coupling (8Cho W.

PIP2 represents less than 1! of the lipids in the plasma membrane and forms microdomains to regulate several key signaling events (9Golub T. Caroni P. J.

The interaction between the C2 domain of protein kinase Cα and PIP2 is essential for the proper subcellular localization of protein kinase Cα (11Evans J.H. Murray D. Leslie C.C. Falke J.J. Mol. Biol.

Several C2 domains of proteins involved in synaptic vesicle fusion have been described to bind PIP2, e.g. C2 domains of some synaptotagmins (6Tucker W.C. Edwardson J.M. Bai J. Kim H.J. Martin T.F.

The binding of the C2B domain of synaptotagmin 1 to PIP2 prelocalizes the protein to PIP2-enriched membranes (15Schiavo G. Gu Q.M. Prestwich G.D. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

It is required for clathrin-mediated endocytosis (16Haucke V. Biochem. Soc.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1041-1052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rabphilin-3A was originally identified as a Rab3 effector in neuronal cells (18Shirataki H. Kaibuchi K. Sakoda T. Kishida S. Yamaguchi T. Wada K. Miyazaki M. Takai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2061-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). It was found that the C-terminal C2 domain tandem (C2A and C2B) of this protein mediates interactions with β-adducin (19Miyazaki M. Shirataki H. Kohno H. Kaibuchi K. Tsugita A. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 460-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase (20Zhang Y. Luan Z. Liu A. Hu G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 497: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and annexin A4 (21Willshaw A. Grant K. Yan J. Rockliffe N. Ambavarapu S. Burdyga G. Varro A. Fukuoka S. Gawler D. FEBS Lett. 2004; 559: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For the C2B domain a specific interaction with the tSNARE SNAP25 (25-kDa synaptosomal-associated protein) was identified (22Tsuboi T. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39253-39259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Recent results indicate that rabphilin-3A increases the number of releasable vesicles at the plasma membrane (22Tsuboi T. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39253-39259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 23Deak F. Shin O.H. Tang J. Hanson P. Ubach J. Jahn R. Rizo J. Kavalali E.T. Sudhof T.C. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2856-2866Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and enables the repriming of these vesicles after extensive evoked neurotransmitter release (23Deak F. Shin O.H. Tang J. Hanson P. Ubach J. Jahn R. Rizo J. Kavalali E.T. Sudhof T.C. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2856-2866Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The C-terminal C2 domains of rabphilin-3A are involved in the Ca2+-dependent membrane targeting of rabphilin-3A (24McKiernan C.J. Stabila P.F. Macara I.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4985-4995Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), their primary target being the membrane phosphatidylserine. In addition, they have been described to bind PIP2 in vitro (14Chung S.H. Song W.J. Kim K. Bednarski J.J. Chen J. Prestwich G.D. Holz R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10240-10248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), but so far no in vivo study has addressed the role of this interaction in rabphilin-3A function. We have recently shown that rabphilin-3A C2 domains present well defined inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3, i.e. PIP2 headgroup) binding sites in solution (25Montaville P. Coudevylle N. Radhakrishnan A. Leonov A. Zweckstetter M. Becker S. Protein Sci. 2008; 17: 1025-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, the C2 tandem exhibits asymmetric behavior toward Ca2+ and PIP2 headgroup binding. The C2B domain binds Ca2+ with an affinity in the μm range and binds IP3 in a Ca2+-independent manner with an affinity in the millimolar range (0.43 mm). Oppositely, the intrinsic Ca2+ binding affinity of the C2A domain is low (1.1 mm), and it binds IP3 in a Ca2+-dependent manner with a relatively high affinity (50 μm) in presence of saturating concentration of Ca2+. IP3 and Ca2+ binding to the C2A domain mutually enhance each other, in line with a target-activated messenger affinity mechanism where both the messenger and the target have to be simultaneously present to allow the protein to interact with them at physiological concentrations (26Corbin J.A. Evans J.H. Landgraf K.E. Falke J.J. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 4322-4336Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The asymmetry of the rabphilin-3A C2 domains toward PIP2 headgroup binding may have functional implications; the C2A domain might be involved in the targeting of synaptic vesicle-bound rabphilin-3A to PIP2-enriched subdomains upon Ca2+ signaling. Subsequently, the C2B domain, once bound to the plasma membrane, might interact with the phosphoinositide during the docking step, potentially modulating its binding to SNAP25. The functional plasticity found across the C2 domains is essential to convey specific functions to their harboring proteins. A more detailed structural characterization of specific C2 domain features should provide deeper insight into their functional properties. Within this line, the C2A domain crystal structure has been solved only in its Ca2+-free state (27Biadene M. Montaville P. Sheldrick G.M. Becker S. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Thus, the Ca2+ binding properties are not clarified yet. This domain binds Ca2+ cooperatively with a Hill coefficient of 2.24, suggesting that it binds two to three Ca2+ ions (25Montaville P. Coudevylle N. Radhakrishnan A. Leonov A. Zweckstetter M. Becker S. Protein Sci. 2008; 17: 1025-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). But the exact binding mode remains unknown. Moreover, the Ca2+ binding region (CBR) of this domain exhibits several unusual features found only in a few other C2 domains (Fig. 1). In the Ca2+ binding loop 3 (CBL3), glutamic acid residues are found in position 482 (instead of a conserved Asp) and position 475 (instead of a conserved aromatic residue). The role and function of this non-canonical Ca2+ binding loop have been so far only poorly investigated. Finally, the structural features mediating the interrelation between Ca2+ and PIP2 headgroup binding remain mostly unknown. To address these structure-function aspects, we solved the solution structure of the rabphilin-3A C2A domain in its Ca2+-bound form and investigated the structural determinants of its Ca2+ and IP3 binding properties. Sample Preparation—The C2A domain (fragment 371-510) of rat rabphilin-3A was prepared as described previously (27Biadene M. Montaville P. Sheldrick G.M. Becker S. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 28Montaville P. Schlicker C. Leonov A. Zweckstetter M. Sheldrick G.M. Becker S. J. Biol.

All samples were concentrated up to 0.4 mm (for titration experiments) or 1 mm (for HSQC-NOESY experiments) in 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0 (or 50 mm HEPES pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol supplemented with 10!

NMR Measurements—NMR experiments were carried out at 301 K on Bruker Avance spectrometers operating at 600, 800, or 900 MHz equipped with z-gradient cryoprobes. All spectra were processed using NMRPipe/NMRDraw (29Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11632) Google Scholar) and analyzed with Sparky, Xeasy (30Bartels C. Xia T.H. Billeter M. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar), and CARA (31Keller R. The Computer-aided Resonance Assignment Tutorial. Cantina Verlag, Goldau, Switzerland2004Google Scholar). 1H, 15N, and 13C assignment of the raphilin-3A C2A domain was taken from the Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank entry 6787 (32Montaville P. Kim H.Y. Vijayan V. Becker S. Zweckstetter M. J Biomol NMR Suppl. 1. 2006; 36: 20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). 1H,15N HSQC-based titrations were performed using d-myo-inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (Calbiochem). Proton amide temperature coefficients were measured by performing 1H,15N HSQC experiments at different temperatures (279.2, 284.7, 289.2, 294.9, 299.6, and 305.4 K). Residual dipolar couplings were measured on a partially aligned sample using bacteriophage Pf1 (Profos) at a concentration of 7 mg/ml at pH 6. One bond, 1J1H, 15N and 1D1H15N, was measured on 1H,15N HSQC spectra acquired after the in-phase/anti-phase (IPAP) method (33Ottiger M. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 12: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Interproton distances were derived from three-dimensional 13C,1H/15N HSQC-NOESY experiments performed with a mixing time of 120 ms. Structure Calculations—Backbone φ and ψ dihedral restraints were derived from the program TALOS (34Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar) using as input the 1H, 13C, and 15N backbone chemical shifts. Only TALOS predictions with 10 matches agreeing were used as φ and ψ dihedral restraints. To each of them was attributed an average value with a minimal S.D. range of 10°. Dihedral restraints, 13C,1H/15N HSQC-NOESY spectra and 1H, 13C, 15N chemical shifts were used as input for the ATNOS/CANDID package (35Herrmann T. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 24: 171-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 36Herrmann T. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar) to generate a first ensemble of structures. This early ensemble was used to manually finalize the assignment of the 13C,1H/15N HSQC-NOESY spectra and led to a final set of about 1700 distance restraints. Dihedral angles and distance restraints were then used in the MD protocol of CYANA (37Güntert P. Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson. Spectrosc. 2003; 43: 105-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (224) Google Scholar) to generate an ensemble of 100 structures of the rabphilin-3A C2A domain. Hydrogen-bond restraints were also added during this step, based on weak observed temperature coefficients (superior to -5·10-3 ppm·K-1) (38Baxter N.J. Williamson M.P. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 9: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) correlating with the secondary structure prediction. The 50 structures with the lowest target function were selected for an RDC refinement protocol performed with Xplor-NIH (39Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Tjandra N. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2003; 160: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar) and the protein-2.0 force field. Ca2+ ions were added subsequently based on Ca2+ titration experiments and comparison with the canonical Ca2+ binding site of C2 domains. For each Ca2+, six distance restraints were defined between the protein and the ion (Ca2+-oxygen distances were restrained to 1.8-2.8 Å). The compatibility of the Ca2+ binding restraints with the force field parameters and the experimental restraints (dihedral angles, distance restraints, and RDCs) was carefully checked. The 20 structures with the lowest energy were selected as the final ensemble of structures describing the rabphilin-3A C2A domain in solution. Experimental restraints and structural statistics are summarized in Table 1. The lowest energy structure from the final ensemble was considered as the most representative of the ensemble and was used for preparing figures and structure comparisons.TABLE 1NMR and refinement statistics for rabphilin-3A C2A domainNMR geometric restraintsTotal distance restraints1803Intra-residue705Inter-residue1098Sequential (|i-j| = 1)527Medium-range (|i-j| ≤ 4)151Long-range (|i-j| ≥ 5)420Hydrogen bondsaHydrogen bonds were identified on the basis of high HN temperature coefficient (superior to −5 × 10−3 ppm·K−1).

Open table in a new tab Fitting Procedure—To evaluate titration experiments of the labeled C2A domain with Ca2+ and IP3, the chemical shift deviations of significantly affected residues were plotted against the ligand concentration. A simultaneous fit was performed using Igor Pro (Wavemetrics Inc.) with the following equations. Equation 1 is a single binding site model (40Auguin D. Barthe P. Royer C. Stern M.H. Noguchi M.

For the cooperative binding model, the total ligand concentration was used in the Hill equation to calculate the free ligand concentration, where [Pt], [Lt], KDapp, n, and Bmax are the total protein concentration, ligand concentration, global dissociation constant, the Hill coefficient, and the chemical shift deviation at saturation, respectively. Docking Models for the IP3-C2A Domain Complex—Models of the C2A-PIP2 complex were calculated using the docking program HADDOCK (high ambiguity-driven protein docking) (41Dominguez C. Boelens R.

Only solvent-accessible residues undergoing significant chemical shift perturbation (Δδ larger than 0.1 ppm) upon IP3 titration (performed at pH 5) were defined as active residues.

The three best models were selected as the final representative ensemble of the complex structure. Structural Statistics and Overall Structure of the Ca2+-bound C2A Domain of Rabphilin-3A—The solution structure of the Ca2+-bound C2A domain of rabphilin-3A was solved with the aim of investigating its IP3 binding properties including the way they are modulated by Ca2+. Because amide resonances of residues from CBL3 were broadened below detection level at pH 7, all spectra were acquired at pH 5. The N-terminal portion of the C2A domain fragment (residues 371-383) was not included in the structure calculation as it has been observed to be highly dynamic. Indeed, only few sequential NOE effects were observed for this segment (as also revealed by the very narrow line-widths of 1H,15N HSQC cross-peaks for these residues). The 20 final structures of the Ca2+-bound C2A domain of rabphilin-3A at pH 5 exhibit an atomic root mean square distribution about the mean coordinate positions of 0.38 ± 0.11 Å for the backbone atoms and 1.11 ± 0.14 Å for all heavy atoms, excluding the residues from CBL1 and CBL3, which are slightly less well defined (Fig. 2A). The structure ensemble fits the experimental restraints with no interproton distance and torsion angle violations greater than 0.2 Å and 10°, respectively. All of the backbone torsion angles of the non-glycine residues fall in the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot (Table 1). The overall structure is composed by two four-stranded β-sheets arranged in a compact β-sandwich (corresponding to the type I topology described for the C2 domains) and surrounded by two helices, one two-turn α-helix between strands β6 and β7 and a one-turn 310-helix between strands β7 and β8 (Fig. 2B). As observed in many other C2 domains and also in the Ca2+-free crystal structure of the C2A domain (27Biadene M. Montaville P. Sheldrick G.M. Becker S. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), a set of acidic residues is located at one extremity of the protein characterized by three loops (CBL1-3 in Fig. 2A). These residues define the CBR. Ca2+ Binding Mode—To determine the Ca2+ binding mode of the C2A domain, we first performed a 1H,15N HSQC-based Ca2+ titration at pH 5. As expected, the same residues (located in the CBR) observed previously at pH 7 (25Montaville P. Coudevylle N. Radhakrishnan A. Leonov A. Zweckstetter M. Becker S. Protein Sci. 2008; 17: 1025-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) were affected upon Ca2+ binding (Fig. 3A), indicating that the Ca2+ binding mode is topologically not modified at pH 5 as compared with pH 7. 1H,15N HSQC cross-peaks affected upon Ca2+ addition adopted a linear trajectory throughout the titration, allowing the fitting of their chemical shift perturbation against the Ca2+ concentration. This also clearly indicates that the C2 domain switches from the unbound state to the fully Ca2+-loaded state without an intermediate state, which means that regardless of the number of Ca2+ ions binding to the C2A domain, they bind concomitantly, i.e. with very similar affinities. Fitting the chemical shift perturbation of residues affected by Ca2+ binding against the Ca2+ concentration with Equation 2 to take in account cooperative binding (as suggested by the sigmoidal shape of the curve in Fig. 3B) gave a global dissociation constant of 3.76 ± 0.05 mm with a Hill coefficient of 2.27 ± 0.05 (Fig. 3B). The lower affinity measured at pH 5 as compared with pH 7 (1.10 ± 0.01 mm) is expected considering the increased protonation state of the acidic residues in the CBR at lower pH. Nevertheless, the pH 5 data are in agreement with those measured at pH 7, i.e. the intrinsic Ca2+ binding affinity is in the mm range. Noteworthy, the Hill coefficient of 2.27 ± 0.05 measured at pH 5 is identical to the one measured at pH 7 (2.24 ± 0.03). This value indicates that three Ca2+ ions should bind in a cooperative way to the C2A domain of rabphilin-3A. Based on the Ca2+ titration and the geometry of the canonical Ca2+ binding mode of C2 domains, Ca2+ ions were added to the C2A domain structure during the RDC refinement. Only two Ca2+ ions were positioned successfully into the canonical sites Ca1 and Ca2 (Fig. 3C). Attempting to add a third Ca2+ to site Ca3 led to severe RDC and distance restraints violations, in line with mutagenesis results for the C2B domain of synaptotagmin I where the mutation of glycine 368 into a serine residue that is conserved in other C2 domains was a prerequisite to form a third low affinity Ca2+ binding site (Fig. 3C) (43Fernandez I.

https://openalex.org/W2066145336,"We report an analysis of the reaction mechanism of ornithine 4,5-aminomutase, an adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl)- and pyridoxal L-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the 1,2-rearrangement of the terminal amino group of D-ornithine to generate (2R,4S)-2,4-diaminopentanoic acid. We show by stopped-flow absorbance studies that binding of the substrate D-ornithine or the substrate analogue D-2,4-diaminobutryic acid (DAB) induces rapid homolysis of the AdoCbl Co-C bond (781 s(-1), D-ornithine; 513 s(-1), DAB). However, only DAB results in the stable formation of a cob(II)alamin species. EPR spectra of DAB and [2,4,4-(2)H(3)]DAB bound to holo-ornithine 4,5-aminomutase suggests strong electronic coupling between cob(II)alamin and a radical form of the substrate analog. Loading of substrate/analogue onto PLP (i.e. formation of an external aldimine) is also rapid (532 s(-1), D-ornithine; 488 s(-1), DAB). In AdoCbl-depleted enzyme, formation of the external aldimine occurs over long time scales (approximately 50 s) and occurs in three resolvable kinetic phases, identifying four distinct spectral intermediates (termed A-D). We infer that these represent the internal aldimine (lambda(max) 416 nm; A), two different unliganded PLP states of the enzyme (lambda(max) at 409 nm; B and C), and the external aldimine (lambda(max) 426 nm; D). An imine linkage with d-ornithine and DAB generates both tautomeric forms of the external aldimine, but with D-ornithine the equilibrium is shifted toward the ketoimine state. The influence of this equilibrium distribution of prototropic isomers in driving homolysis and stabilizing radical intermediate states is discussed. Our work provides the first detailed analysis of radical-based catalysis in this Class III AdoCbl-dependent enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2060124068,"Interleukin-11 (IL-11) is a pleiotropic cytokine approved by the FDA against chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia. From a combinatorial selection in a cancer patient, we isolated an IL-11-like peptide mapping to domain I of the IL-11 (sequence CGRRAGGSC). Although this motif has ligand attributes, it is not within the previously characterized interacting sites. Here we design and validate in-tandem binding assays, site-directed mutagenesis and NMR spectroscopy to show (i) the peptide mimics a receptor-binding site within IL-11, (ii) the binding of CGRRAGGSC to the IL-11R alpha is functionally relevant, (iii) Arg4 and Ser8 are the key residues mediating the interaction, and (iv) the IL-11-like motif induces cell proliferation through STAT3 activation. These structural and functional results uncover an as yet unrecognized receptor-binding site in human IL-11. Given that IL-11R alpha has been proposed as a target in human cancer, our results provide clues for the rational design of targeted drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2009096408,"B-cells integrate antigen-specific signals transduced via the B-cell receptor (BCR) and antigen non-specific co-stimulatory signals provided by cytokines and CD40 ligation in order to produce IgG antibodies. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) also provide co-stimulation, but the requirement for TLRs to generate T-cell independent and T-cell dependent antigen specific antibody responses is debated. Little is known about the role of B-cell expressed TLRs in inducing antigen-specific antibodies to antigens that also activate TLR signaling. We found that mice lacking functional TLR4 or its adaptor molecule MyD88 harbored significantly less IgG3 natural antibodies to LPS, and required higher amounts of LPS to induce anti-LPS IgG3. In vitro, BCR and TLR4 signaling synergized, lowering the threshold for production of T-cell independent IgG3 and IL-10. Moreover, BCR and TLR4 directly associate through the transmembrane domain of TLR4. Thus, in vivo, BCR/TLR synergism could facilitate the induction of IgG3 antibodies against microbial antigens that engage both innate and adaptive B-cell receptors. Vaccines might exploit BCR/TLR synergism to rapidly induce antigen-specific antibodies before significant T-cell responses arise."
https://openalex.org/W2086998621,"Background Rapid testing of pregnant women aims to increase uptake of HIV testing and results and thus optimize care. We report on the acceptability of HIV counselling and testing, and uptake of results, before and after the introduction of rapid testing in this area. Methods and Principal Findings HIV counsellors offered counselling and testing to women attending 8 antenatal clinics, prior to enrolment into a study examining infant feeding and postnatal HIV transmission. From August 2001 to April 2003, blood was sent for HIV ELISA testing in line with the Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission (PMTCT) programme in the district. From May 2003 to September 2004 women were offered a rapid HIV test as part of the PMTCT programme, but also continued to have ELISA testing for study purposes. Of 12,323 women counselled, 5,879 attended clinic prior to May 2003, and 6,444 after May 2003 when rapid testing was introduced; of whom 4,324 (74.6%) and 4,810 (74.6%) agreed to have an HIV test respectively. Of the 4,810 women who had a rapid HIV test, only 166 (3.4%) requested to receive their results on the same day as testing, the remainder opted to return for results at a later appointment. Women with secondary school education were less likely to agree to testing than those with no education (AOR 0.648, p<0.001), as were women aged 21–35 (AOR 0.762, p<0.001) and >35 years (AOR 0.756, p<0.01) compared to those <20 years. Conclusions Contrary to other reports, few women who had rapid tests accepted their HIV results the same day. Finding strategies to increase the proportion of pregnant women knowing their HIV results is critical so that appropriate care can be given."

PARP-1 activity is also implicated in the regulation of mammalian lifespan. Herein we show that transcriptional down-regulation of androgen receptor (AR) in the aging rat liver and in oxidatively stressed hepatoma cells involves exchange of a PARP-1-associated, p/CAF-containing coactivator assembly for a p53-interacting, Groucho/TLE1-, and mSin3A-included corepressor complex at an age- and oxidant-responsive DNA element (age-dependent factor (ADF) element) in the AR promoter.

Increased AR expression from its transcriptional up-regulation occurs frequently in human prostate carcinoma (8Pienta K.J. Bradley D. Clin.

Therefore, it is important to delineate the regulatory factors that contribute to altered AR levels in response to a changing milieu of various AR-expressing tissues including the liver. androgen receptor age-dependent factor p300/CBP-associating factor (CBP, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein) heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide electrophoretic mobility shift assay matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight chromatin immunoprecipitation tert-butyl hydroperoxide rat liver nuclear extract small interfering RNA glutathione S-transferase immunoprecipitation histone deacetylase thymidine kinase quantitative PCR transducin-like enhancer of split In the rat liver, reduced AR expression during aging, reaching a non-detectable level at late life, is transcriptionally coordinated (9Song C.S.

Dietary calorie restriction, which retards age-related diseases and extends the invertebrate and vertebrate lifespan, also reverses loss of AR expression and restores androgen sensitivity of the aging liver (9Song C.S.

In earlier studies, we had identified positive and negative changes in specific transcription regulatory activities that are linked to the loss of hepatic AR in old rats (10Supakar P.C. Song C.S. Jung M.H. Slomczynska M.A. Kim J.M. Vellanoweth R.L. Chatterjee B. Roy A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26400-26408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Supakar P.C. Jung M.H. Song C.S.

For example, NF-κB activity in the liver and in other tissues is known to rise with advancing age as a result of increased oxidative stress (12Supakar P.C. Jung M.H. Song C.S. Chatterjee B. Roy A.K.

Conversely the activity of a nuclear factor, which stimulates the promoter function of AR, declines gradually in the liver of aging rodents. This age-dependent factor or ADF (as per our designation) avidly binds to a 20-bp DNA element at around the -330 promoter/enhancer position in the rat AR gene. Inactivating point mutations within the 20-bp element abolished ADF binding to the cognate site (ADF element) and reduced AR promoter activity in transfected cells (10Supakar P.C. Song C.S. Jung M.H.

ADF activity was also detected in non-hepatic cells, such as those from the rat and human prostate (PAIII and LNCaP, respectively), monkey kidney (COS-1), and human uterine cervix (HeLa). We have sought to characterize the molecular identity of ADF and delineate the coregulatory components that link reduced ADF activity with loss of AR in vivo. Coregulators, which do not possess direct DNA binding activity, associate with DNA-bound transcription factors and serve as conduits in the relay of signals from target gene response elements to RNA polymerase II via the general transcription-promoting machinery. The nuclear enzyme PARP-1 (poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1) interacts with and coactivates many DNA-binding transcription factors such as the redox-sensitive and inflammation-responsive AP-1 and NF-κB and the protooncoprotein B-Myb, which regulates genes involved in cell cycle progression (17D'Amours D. Desnoyers S. D'Silva I. Poirier G.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 249-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 18Kraus W.L. Lis J.T. Cell. 2003; 113: 677-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). PARP-1 interacts with the mediator complex and thus may serve as a platform protein (19Pavri R. Lewis B. Kim T.K. Dilworth F.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. de Murcia G. Evans R. Chambon P. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 83-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Furthermore induced PARP-1 activity acts as a sensor in a promoter-specific corepressor to coactivator switch at a regulatory element (20Rosenfeld M.G. Lunyak V.V. Glass C.K. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1405-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). PARP-1 is also involved in other vital nuclear processes related to DNA repair, DNA replication/recombination, chromatin remodeling, genome stability, and cell death. Oxidative stress and other DNA damage signals superactivate PARP-1, which catalyzes the sequential transfer of ADP-ribose units from β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (β-NAD+) to various nuclear proteins including itself (auto-modification) to cause attachment of polymeric ADP-ribosyl chains onto the acceptors. Proteins modified by ADP-ribosyl polymers are functionally altered. For example, poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of the tumor suppressor protein p53 prevents its interaction with the nuclear export system, causing its nuclear accumulation, which facilitates target gene activation by p53 (21Kanai M. Hanashiro K. Kim S.H. Hanai S. Boulares A.H. Miwa M. Fukasawa K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1175-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). PARP-1 activity correlates positively with the lifespan of various mammalian species (22Grube K. Bürkle A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11759-11763Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), and lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from centenarians are enriched for PARP-1 activity (23Murias M.L. Muller M. Schachter F. Burkle A. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). These results have advanced the notion that PARP-1 is important in mammalian aging. The present study reveals the identity of the protein factors associated with the ADF element, demonstrates that oxidative stress can reduce AR mRNAs similar to that observed in aging, and identifies a shared regulatory strategy involving the Myb transcription factor-mediated exchange of PARP-1 for p53 at the ADF element, which coordinates transcriptional repression of AR in vivo at old age and in cells at a prooxidant state. PARP-1 is an essential component of the B-Myb/c-Myb-associated activating complex that governs AR gene stimulation. The multifunctional heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNPK) interacts with PARP-1 in vivo and may serve as a stabilizing docking platform for the activating complex. Exchange of PARP-1 and hnRNPK for p53 and p53-associated Groucho/TLE1 and mSin3A corepressors at regulated chromatin correlated with AR down-regulation in vivo and in cells challenged by oxidative stress. p53 interfered with B-Myb/c-Myb-mediated transactivation, and Myb/PARP-1 interaction was inhibited in the aging liver and in cells shifted to a prooxidant state. These results suggest that PARP-1 may provide for a sensing mechanism that triggers a coregulator exchange. AR levels were reduced in cells silenced for B-Myb, c-Myb, PARP-1, or hnRNPK and elevated after p53 knockdown. We conclude that reciprocal chromatin dynamics of p53 and PARP-1 at the ADF element, mediated by the Myb transcription factors, is integral to the regulatory network that orchestrates the loss of AR in aging and in response to oxidative stress. Animal Care—Fisher 344 rats, young and old, were purchased from the National Institute of Aging and given rest for 1 week before sacrificing for tissue harvesting. Animal care and treatment protocols were approved by the institutional animal care committee. Enrichment of ADF Activity and Mass Spectrometry—HeLa cells (from ATCC) were processed to prepare nuclear extracts as described previously (24Dignam J.D. Lebowitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9162) Google Scholar). The extracts were dialyzed against 150 mm NaCl in buffer-1 (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and taken through a four-step enrichment protocol involving 1) DNA affinity chromatography on ADF element-coupled Sepharose 4B gel (Amersham Biosciences), 2) anion-exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose CL-4B gel (Amersham Biosciences), 3) cation-exchange chromatography on a Mono S column (Amersham Biosciences), and 4) reverse DNA affinity chromatography on mutant ADF element-coupled Sepharose 4B gel. The mutant ADF element has three point mutations that cause complete loss of ADF activity. The sequences for the wild-type ADF element and its three-point mutant are provided under “Co-IP, Western Blotting, EMSA, and DNase I Footprinting.” Three tandem copies of the duplex ADF element or its three-point mutant were coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) using standard, vendor-recommended conditions. The DNA affinity column was eluted with dialysis buffer containing step gradients of NaCl solution. The fractions from the 0.3 m NaCl eluate showing ADF activity were loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column, and pooled eluates from a linear salt gradient (0.3–0.4 m NaCl) showing peak ADF binding activity (assayed by EMSA) were passed through a Mono S cation-exchange column. After elution with a linear salt gradient (0.15–0.25 m NaCl), the pooled eluates possessing peak ADF activity were passed through mutant ADF element-coupled Sepharose 4B gel. Flow-through proteins containing unretained ADF activity were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and silver-stained protein bands were cut out of the gel for analysis by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to determine the identity of the ADF activity-copurified proteins. Mass spectrometry was performed at the institutional core facility. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP on liver tissues was performed as described by us previously (25Seo Y.K. Chung Y.T. Kim S.Y. Echchgadda I. Song C.S. Chatterjee B. Gene (Amst.). 2007; 386: 218-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly nuclei were prepared from formaldehyde-fixed tissue pieces, and the supernatant from lysed nuclei was sonicated (25Seo Y.K. Chung Y.T. Kim S.Y. Echchgadda I. Song C.S. Chatterjee B. Gene (Amst.). 2007; 386: 218-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and analyzed on an agarose gel to ensure a <1-kbp size range of the fragmented chromatin DNAs. Soluble chromatin fragments in the supernatant were diluted and used for immunoprecipitation as described previously (14Ko S.Y. Shi L.H. Kim S.Y. Song C.S. Chatterjee B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2008; 22: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). H4IIE cells (seeded at 107cells/10-cm dish) were grown to 80% confluency and incubated in medium (vehicle) or tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBH) for 30 or 60 min before fixing with formaldehyde. The purchased antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) used for ChIP analyses were: AR (sc-816), B-Myb (sc-724), c-Myb (sc-7874), hnRNPK (sc-16554), PARP-1 (sc-7150), p53 (sc-1311), TLE1 (sc-9121), mSin3A (sc-994), and p/CAF (sc-8999). Immunoprecipitated chromatin was washed with low salt, high salt, and LiCl solutions and finally with Tris-EDTA buffer. Complexes pulled down by protein A-Sepharose were eluted by the elution buffer and incubated with NaCl solution (at 200 mm final concentration) at 65 °C for at least 4 h to reverse protein-DNA cross-linking. 10 μl of the eluate (of 100 μl total) was used for PCR after DNA extraction. The remainder of the eluate was used for sequential ChIP as described previously (14Ko S.Y. Shi L.H. Kim S.Y. Song C.S. Chatterjee B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2008; 22: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). PCR was performed on various DNA samples at equal inputs using Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) using the following primers to probe the ADF site in the rat AR genome: sense at -500, 5′-GACTCTCCCTTCTGCTTGTC; antisense at -300, 5′-GGAACCGGGCTTTAGACTC. For unrelated, rat AR intragenic region, the following primers were used: sense at +2241, 5′-TTCACTAATGTCAACTCCAGGA; antisense at +2688, 5′-CTTGCACAGAGA-TGATCTCTG. Activation of PARP-1 Enzymatic Activity in Vitro—Rat liver nuclear extract (RLNE) was incubated with or without 500 μm β-NAD+ for 1 h at 37 °C using a buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) as described previously (26Mendoza-Alvarez H. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36425-36430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Incubated nuclear extracts were used for co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP). Cells, siRNAs, and mRNA Quantification—Rat hepatoma (H4IIE), human hepatoma (HepG2), and human embryonic kidney (293A) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Human prostate carcinoma (LNCaP) cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium. Media contained 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/5 ml penicillin, 100 units/5 ml streptomycin. Cell transfections were performed in 24-well flasks. RNA interference oligos (Dharmacon) used were: human B-Myb (SMARTpool; catalog number M-010444-00-0005), c-Myb (SMARTpool; catalog number M-003910-00-0005), PARP-1 (SMARTpool; catalog number L-006656-00-0010), hnRNPK (SMARTpool; catalog number L-011692-00-0010), p53 (SMARTpool; catalog number L-003329-00-0010), and non-targeting, scrambled siRNAs (SMARTpool; catalog number D-001810-01-20). siRNAs (at 100 nm) were transfected into cells (6-well flasks) using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). At 72 h post-RNA interference transfection, cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting. Sequences for the RNA interference oligos (purchased from Dharmacon) used in this study are included in the supplemental material. Total cellular RNAs (isolated by TRIzol™) were assayed for AR mRNAs by reverse transcription qPCR using the SYBR Green PCR reagent kit (Bio-Rad). Primers to probe AR mRNAs (14Ko S.Y. Shi L.H. Kim S.Y. Song C.S. Chatterjee B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2008; 22: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) are described in the supplemental material. Co-IP, Western Blotting, EMSA, and DNase I Footprinting—Co-IP was performed under standard conditions. Western blotting used the same antibodies as those used in ChIP. Oligo DNA sequences used in EMSA were: ADF-AR, 5′-AGGCTTGTCTGTTAAAAAA (sense); and ADF-mut (three-point mutant), 5′-AGGCTCGTCTCTTAGAAAA (sense) (point mutations are at underlined bases). For duplex probe preparation, the sense strand was labeled at the 5′-end by T4 kinase and [γ-32P]dATP and then annealed to a 5-fold excess of cold antisense strand. The duplex CT-rich hnRNPK-binding element in the rat osteocalcin promoter used in the competition EMSA corresponds to 5′-CAGCATCTCCTGCCCCTCCTGCT (sense). The EMSA complex was competed out by the cold, homologous ADF sequence; by Myb/Stat6, which is the Myb-binding element in the Stat6 promoter; and by ADF/retinoic acid receptor, which is the ADF/Myb-like sequence that was identified by Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) search on chromosome 3 contig within the human β-retinoic acid receptor gene (GenBank™ accession number NT_022517.17; location base, 25409343–25409317). DNase I footprinting was done as before (14Ko S.Y. Shi L.H. Kim S.Y. Song C.S. Chatterjee B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2008; 22: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Plasmids and GST-fused Proteins—Full-lengh B-Myb cDNA was prepared from HeLa cell total RNAs by real time PCR and was sequence-confirmed. Truncated B-Myb-(1–561) lacking the C-terminal inhibitory domain and B-Myb-(1–350) lacking the activation domain and C-terminal inhibitory domain were constructed from the full-length B-Myb cDNA by PCR. cDNAs were cloned into pCDNA 3.1 or into pGEX4T2. Three copies of the ADF element in tandem as an oligoduplex and three tandem copies of ADF three-point mutant oligoduplex were cloned in the basal TK-Luc vector. Sequences for the ADF element (-311 to -330) and its three-point mutant are shown above. GST fusions of B-Myb-(1–561), c-Myb (full length), and hnRNPK (full length) expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21RP were purified on a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column. Recombinant PARP-1 was purchased (Trevigen). Loss of AR and Reduced ADF Activity in the Aging Rat Liver—The age-regulated loss of AR mRNAs in the rat liver reported earlier (9Song C.S. Rao T.R. Demyan W.F. Mancini M.A. Chatterjee B. Roy A.K. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 10Supakar P.C. Song C.S. Jung M.H. Slomczynska M.A. Kim J.M. Vellanoweth R.L. Chatterjee B. Roy A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26400-26408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reflects a loss of AR protein levels as shown here (Fig. 1A). The closely migrating bands at ∼110 kDa correspond to AR in phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms (27Wang L.G. Liu X.M. Kreis W. Budman D.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Among multiple DNase I-protected footprints in the rat AR promoter produced by liver nuclear extracts (Fig. 1B), the footprint from positions -330 to -311 is relevant to the current study. The activity of the liver nuclear proteins that bind to the -330 to -311 element (ADF element) was markedly reduced in 22-month-old rats compared with the 4-month-old rats (Fig. 1C) similar to earlier findings (10Supakar P.C. Song C.S. Jung M.H. Slomczynska M.A. Kim J.M. Vellanoweth R.L. Chatterjee B. Roy A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26400-26408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This ADF stimulates AR promoter function (Fig. 1D). The current study was undertaken to determine the identity of ADF and ADF-associated proteins and their roles in AR gene expression. Proteomics Identification of ADF-interacting Nuclear Proteins—Nuclear proteins, which associated directly or indirectly with the ADF element, were enriched within HeLa cell nuclear extracts using a four-step enrichment scheme (Fig. 2A). The first step was affinity chromatography with a Sepharose 4B gel slurry that was coupled to a concatamer of the ADF element (-330 to -311). The pooled eluates at 0.3 m NaCl possessing ADF activity (assessed by EMSA) were processed by anion-exchange chromatography on a Q-Sepharose CL-4B column and then by cation-exchange chromatography on a Mono S column. The salt gradient-eluted protein fractions were examined for ADF activity (shown here for the Mono S column eluates (Fig. 2B)). The final step involved reverse affinity chromatography with Sepharose 4B gel coupled to a mutant ADF oligo (three point mutations), which does not bind to the ADF factor. Unbound proteins collected in the flow-through were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining. EMSA of the pooled fractions before and after reverse affinity chromatography revealed that ADF activity was not retained by the ADF mutant column. Several protein bands (∼116–35 kDa) were associated with ADF activity in the flow-through (data not shown), indicating that these proteins may be closely linked to ADF activity. MALDI mass spectrometry revealed that PARP-1 (∼113 kDa), B-Myb (∼97 kDa), c-Myb (∼75 kDa), hnRNPK (∼65 kDa), and p53 (∼53 kDa) are the major proteins that copurified with ADF activity. Additional ADF-associated proteins, which stained as exceedingly faint bands, were of uncertain identity because of low matching scores; they await further exploration. Western blotting further showed the presence of PARP-1, hnRNPK, the Myb transcription factors B-Myb and c-Myb, and p53 in the flow-through (Fig. 2C). hnRNPK was detected as two closely migrating post-translationally modified bands at ∼65 kDa (noted by arrows) representing two hnRNPK isoforms. Predicted molecular masses of these isoforms are 50,976 kDa (isoform-1, 463 amino acids) and 51,028 kDa (isoform-2, 464 amino acids). The additional, faster migrating band arose either from a proteolytic fragment of hnRNPK or from an unrelated protein that cross-reacted with the hnRNPK antibody. The identity of these ADF-associated proteins, validated from Western blot results, enabled us to explore how PARP-1, hnRNPK, p53, and the Myb proteins might be linked to ADF activity and to regulation of the AR gene in vivo. Chromatin Dynamics of ADF-copurified Proteins in Young and Old Rats—We examined whether PARP-1, hnRNPK, B-Myb, c-Myb, and p53 are associated with the ADF element in vivo and whether they are differentially engaged at regulated liver chromatin in young versus old rats. ChIP revealed that B-Myb, PARP-1, and hnRNPK all associated with the ADF element with higher abundance in the samples from the young rats compared with those from the old; the reverse was true for p53 (Fig. 3, A, B, and D). c-Myb association with the ADF site was similar for the young and old rats. Lack of signal in the absence of a primary antibody (Fig. 3A) and lack of chromatin IP from a non-related intragenic region of the rat AR by antibodies to B-Myb and p53 (Fig. 3C) ensured specificity of the ChIP assay. Pooled livers were used (Fig. 3, A and D) to control for animal-to-animal variations. Nevertheless individual liver samples also showed similar age-regulated differential recruitment of the above factors (shown here for hnRNPK (Fig. 3B)). The coactivator p/CAF (a histone acetyltransferase) was enriched at the ADF site in the young but not in old rats (Fig. 3, A and D), indicating that p/CAF is part of the coactivator complex mediating AR gene transcription. The p300 coactivator was absent in this region. The presence of p53 at the ADF site correlated with the loss of AR expression in old animals. Because p53-mediated transcriptional repression can involve histone deacetylase and the mSin3A corepressor (28Murphy M. Ahn J. Walker K.K. Hoffman W.H. Evans R.M. Levine A.J. George D.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2490-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), we checked for mSin3A occupancy. Indeed mSin3A occupied the ADF site in old animals but not in the young (Fig. 3, A and D). HDAC-1/HDAC-2-containing mSin3A corepressor complexes are present in mammalian cells, and p53 has been detected in association with mSin3A and HDAC-1 (29Tanikawa J. Nomura T. Macmillan E.M.

Neither HDAC-1 nor HDAC-2, however, was present at"
https://openalex.org/W2170507690,"Background A key aspect of representations for object recognition and scene analysis in the ventral visual stream is the spatial frame of reference, be it a viewer-centered, object-centered, or scene-based coordinate system. Coordinate transforms from retinocentric space to other reference frames involve combining neural visual responses with extraretinal postural information. Methodology/Principal Findings We examined whether such spatial information is available to anterior inferotemporal (AIT) neurons in the macaque monkey by measuring the effect of eye position on responses to a set of simple 2D shapes. We report, for the first time, a significant eye position effect in over 40% of recorded neurons with small gaze angle shifts from central fixation. Although eye position modulates responses, it does not change shape selectivity. Conclusions/Significance These data demonstrate that spatial information is available in AIT for the representation of objects and scenes within a non-retinocentric frame of reference. More generally, the availability of spatial information in AIT calls into questions the classic dichotomy in visual processing that associates object shape processing with ventral structures such as AIT but places spatial processing in a separate anatomical stream projecting to dorsal structures."
https://openalex.org/W2015640682,"We found six selenoproteins (EhSEP1–6) in the coccolithophorid Emiliania huxleyi (Haptophyceae) using the 75Se radiotracer technique. Previously, the most abundant selenoprotein, EhSEP2, was identified as a novel selenoprotein, a protein disulfide isomerase-like protein (Obata, T., and Shiraiwa, Y. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 18462–18468). The present study focused on the second abundant selenoprotein, EhSEP1, in the same cells and analyzed its molecular properties and regulation of gene expression by selenium. The cDNA sequence of EhSEP1 consists of 1950 base pairs encoding a putative product of 495 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 52.2 kDa. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of EhSEP1 showed strong similarities to those of the enzyme thioredoxin reductase (TR) 1 in the public databases. The EhSEP1 protein contains redox-active cysteine residues in the putative FAD binding domain of the pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase class-1 domain, a dimerization domain, and a C-terminal Gly-Cys-Sec (selenocysteine)-Gly sequence that is known to function as an additional redox center. In the 3′-untranslated region of EhSEP1 cDNA, we found a selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) that is similar to the SECIS found previously in animals. The expression of EhSEP1 showed almost the same pattern under both selenium-sufficient and selenium-deficient conditions. Conversely, TR activity gradually increased 4-fold within ca. 70 h when cells were transferred to the medium containing 10 nm selenite. These data show that selenium is essential for the induction of TR activity at the translational level but not at the transcriptional level in this alga.

The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of EhSEP1 showed strong similarities to those of the enzyme thioredoxin reductase (TR) 1 in the public databases. The EhSEP1 protein contains redox-active cysteine residues in the putative FAD binding domain of the pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase class-1 domain, a dimerization domain, and a C-terminal Gly-Cys-Sec (selenocysteine)-Gly sequence that is known to function as an additional redox center. In the 3′-untranslated region of EhSEP1 cDNA, we found a selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) that is similar to the SECIS found previously in animals. The expression of EhSEP1 showed almost the same pattern under both selenium-sufficient and selenium-deficient conditions. Conversely, TR activity gradually increased 4-fold within ca. 70 h when cells were transferred to the medium containing 10 nm selenite. These data show that selenium is essential for the induction of TR activity at the translational level but not at the transcriptional level in this alga. Selenium is an essential trace element in many organisms. More than 40 selenoprotein families have been identified in diverse organisms, including bacteria, Archaea, and eukaryotes, by metabolic labeling techniques with 75Se and bioinformatics approaches (1Kryukov G.V. Castellano S. Novoselov S.V. Lobanov A.V. Zehtab O. Guigo R. Gladyshev V.N. Science. 2003; 300: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1847) Google Scholar, 2Kryukov G.V. Gladyshev V.N. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 538-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). A number of advanced studies on selenium-containing proteins have been performed, mostly in humans and other mammals. Significant biological effects of selenium have been shown to be due to the action of various selenoproteins that contain selenium in the form of selenocysteine (Sec) 2The abbreviations used are:SecselenocysteineDTNB5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic) acidESTexpressed sequence tagHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsSECISselenocysteine insertion sequenceUTRuntranslated regionTRthioredoxin reductaseFTRferredoxin-thioredoxin reductaseNTRNADPH thioredoxin reductaseNTRCchloroplast-located NTR (3Brown K.M.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 13697-13704Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Sec inserted into the active site of selenoproteins functions as a catalytic residue because of its strong nucleophilicity (5Stadtman T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 83-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Sec reversibly changes its redox state during catalysis. Because of the nature of Sec, most selenoproteins function as oxidoreductases. In all organisms that are known to possess selenoproteins, Sec is cotranslationally incorporated into proteins at the site of the UGA codon, which is usually used as a stop codon, on mRNA through a specific Sec insertion mechanism. This mechanism includes a cis-acting mRNA structure known as the Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) and trans-acting factors consisting of Sec tRNA, a selenocysteyl-tRNA-specific elongation factor, and an SECIS binding protein 2 (6Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3565-3576Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes SECIS is located in the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of selenoprotein mRNAs. Eukaryotic SECIS RNA folding is categorized into two slightly different secondary structures, forms 1 and 2, and the non-Watson-Crick quartet is highly conserved in both forms (7Krol A. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 765-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). selenocysteine 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic) acid expressed sequence tag high performance liquid chromatography rapid amplification of cDNA ends selenocysteine insertion sequence untranslated region thioredoxin reductase ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase NADPH thioredoxin reductase chloroplast-located NTR Neither selenoprotein genes nor any of the components of the Sec insertion mechanism were found in the genomes of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (8Novoselov S.V.

The lack of selenoproteins in both organisms raised intriguing questions about the general role of selenoproteins in organisms and the strategy for selenium utilization adopted during evolution. Little information on selenoproteins in selenium-requiring photosynthetic organisms is available. Some selenoproteins have been discovered by bioinformatics approaches in photosynthetic organisms, such as the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana and the green algae Ostreococcus tauri and Ostreococcus lucimarinus (9Lobanov A.V. Fomenko D.E. Zhang Y. Sengupta A. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. Genome Biology. 2007; 8: R198Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Two selenoproteins were experimentally identified, i.e. a Sec-containing glutathione peroxidase in T. pseudonana (10Price N.M. Harrison P.J. Plant Physiol. 1988; 86: 192-199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a protein disulfide isomerase-like protein in the haptophyte alga Emiliania huxleyi (11Obata T. Shiraiwa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18462-18468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). On the other hand, 10 selenoproteins were identified in the unicellular green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, although selenium is not essential for the growth of the alga (8Novoselov S.V. Rao M. Onoshko N.V. Zhi H. Kryukov G.V. Xiang Y. Weeks D.P. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3681-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Therefore, characterization and identification of selenoproteins in selenium-requiring photosynthetic organisms will provide information to elucidate how selenium functions in cellular metabolism and how selenium utilization strategies have changed during evolution. We reported previously that a haptophycean calcifying alga, the coccolithophorid E. huxleyi, classified as belonging to the Protista, requires nanomolar levels of selenium for growth and the selenite ion is the predominant species used by this alga (12Danbara A. Shiraiwa Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 762-766Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). E. huxleyi is one of the most important algal species for primary production in the oceans; huge blooms of this species result in the formation of large amounts of calcium carbonate precipitate sediments, thus constituting a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide (13Martínez J.M. Schroeder D.C. Larsen A. Bratbak G. Wilson W.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2007; 73: 554-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We postulated that such high biological potentials of E. huxleyi may be related to the ability of this alga to efficiently use nutrients, including selenium. Our previous work demonstrated that selenite absorbed by algal cells was incorporated into low molecular weight selenocompounds as previously observed in land plants (14Sors T.G. Ellis D.R. Salt D.E. Photosynth. Res. 2005; 86: 373-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) and was also used for the synthesis of selenium-containing proteins that were synthesized de novo via the translation process in our previous work (15Obata T. Araie H. Shiraiwa Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 2004; 45: 1434-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We also found that E. huxleyi possesses at least six selenoproteins (EhSEP1–6). Of these, EhSEP2, is homologous to protein disulfide isomerase (11Obata T. Shiraiwa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18462-18468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These results suggest that E. huxleyi possesses both a land plant-type selenium metabolic system and the Sec insertion mechanism for selenoprotein synthesis. Therefore, the identification and molecular characterization of as yet unidentified selenoproteins in E. huxleyi are very important to confirm experimentally how selenium functions in and associates with protein molecules. In this study we found that EhSEP1 of E. huxleyi is highly homologous to animal thioredoxin reductase (TR) 1. In this selenoprotein the form 2 SECIS is located in the 3′-UTR region, and Sec is encoded by a penultimate TGA codon located within the C-terminal tetrapeptide active site, as in animal TRs. EhSEP1 requires selenium for stimulating its activity but not for the regulation of its induction at the transcriptional level in E. huxleyi. Cell Growth—The coccolithophorid, E. huxleyi (Lohman) Hay & Mohler (NIES 837) (Haptophyceae), was obtained from the algal culture collection of the National Institute for Environmental Studies, Tsukuba, Japan. The cells were grown in MA-ESM medium containing synthetic seawater, Marine Art SF (initially from Senju Pharmaceutical, Osaka, Japan and later from Osaka Yakken, Osaka, Japan), and additional micronutrients and Erd-Schreiber medium containing 10 nm disodium selenite instead of soil extract according to the method of Danbara and Shiraiwa (12Danbara A. Shiraiwa Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 762-766Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The cultures were continuously illuminated at 100 μmol of photons m–2 s–1 by fluorescent light and maintained at 20 °C. Databases—All genomic, expressed sequence tag (EST), and predicted protein sequences involving E. huxleyi were obtained from NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) except for the genomes of O. lucimarinus CCE9901, T. pseudonana, and Cyanidioschyzon merolae. The genomes of O. lucimarinus CCE9901 and T. pseudonana were obtained from the Joint Genome Institute (www.jgi.doe.gov). The genome of C. merolae was obtained from the C. merolae Genome Project (merolae.biol.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp). Preparation of 75Se-labeled Proteins—For preparation of 75Se-labeled proteins, 1 nm (final concentration) [75Se]selenite (7.5 TBq/mmol; University of Missouri, Columbia, MO) was added to the cultures, and cells were grown for 1 week. The 75Se-labeled cells were harvested by centrifugation (3500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C) using a refrigerated centrifuge and resuspended in buffer A (50 mm HEPES-NaOH containing 3 mm EDTA, pH 7.5). The cells were then disrupted by sonication (Bioruptor; Cosmo Bio, Tokyo, Japan). After removing insoluble matter by centrifugation (13,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C), the supernatant was obtained as the crude extract. After desalting by passing through a PD10 column (GE Healthcare) that was equilibrated with buffer B (10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5), the eluate was applied to a DEAE-Toyopearl column (Toso, Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated with buffer B. After washing out unbound compounds with five times the bed volume of buffer B, proteins were eluted out with buffer B containing 0.1 m Na2SO4. Each 75Se radioactive fraction was applied to 12.5! SDS-PAGE to detect 75Se protein bands in each fraction. The EhSEP1-containing fraction was subjected to a 100-kDa cut-off size fractionation using Amicon Ultra-15 (100 kDa molecular mass cutoff; Millipore, Billerica, MA). The filtrate was concentrated by ultrafiltration using a Centriprep YM10 (10-kDa molecular mass cutoff; Millipore) and then subjected to gel filtration using a Diol-150 HPLC column (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equilibrated with buffer C (10 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 0.2 m Na2SO4, pH 7.0). Protein elution profiles were monitored by measurement of absorbance at 280 nm in a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu). The radioactivity of the fractions was determined by γ-counting (COBRA II; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 75Se-labeled proteins were visualized by radioluminography using a BAS2500 system (Fuji Photo, Tokyo, Japan). Purification of Nonradioactive EhSEP1 and Amino Acid Sequence Analysis—Nonradioactive EhSEP1 was prepared from 50-liter cultures using the same protocol as described for 75Se-labeled EhSEP1; this process was necessary to use the amino acid sequencer in a nonradioactive laboratory. To confirm the identity of 75Se-labeled and nonlabeled EhSEP1, individual samples and the mixture of the two were loaded separately into adjacent lanes of a 10! SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subjected to electrophoresis. The unlabeled band identical to the 75Se-labeled EhSEP1 was extracted from the gel according to the method of Hanawa et al. (16Hanawa Y. Iwamoto K. Shiraiwa Y. Jpn. J. Phycol. 2004; 52: 95-100Google Scholar). For determination of the internal amino acid sequence, the extracted EhSEP1 was treated with lysyl endopeptidase (0.3 μgml–1; Wako Pure Chemical, Osaka, Japan) for 2 h. The digested and undigested peptides were resolved in 15! SDS-PAGE slab gels, and proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained peptide bands were used for N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis by Edman degradation using a Prosice 494HT sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) at the National Institute for Basic Biology (Okazaki, Japan). cDNA Cloning of E. huxleyi EhSEP1—Total RNA was isolated from E. huxleyi cells harvested at the exponential growth phase using the RNAgents Total RNA Isolation System (Promega, Madison, WI), then mRNA was isolated with the PolyATtract mRNA Isolation System (Promega). A SMART RACE cDNA Amplification kit (BD Bioscience Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was used to synthesize first-strand cDNA for 3′- and 5′-RACE PCR. Sense and antisense oligonucleotides were designed from the EST sequence of E. huxleyi (GenBank™ accession number CV069652), which is identical to the EhSEP1 amino acid sequence. The tblastn program (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST) was used for searching the EST data base of E. huxleyi. First, the cDNA for 3′-RACE PCR was used as the template and amplified with gene-specific sense and antisense primers 5′-CCCCTGATCAGCTAACACGA-3′ and 5′-TCACTTCGGACGACGTCTTC-3′, respectively. This PCR product was cloned into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) and sequenced with an Applied Biosystems model 310 DNA sequencer using a BigDye terminator Version 1.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). The cDNA for 3′-RACE PCR was amplified with two different gene-specific sense primers, 5′-GTAAACGTCGGCTGCATCCCAAAGA-3′ (first PCR) and 5′-AAGTCGCTCAACTTCGGGTA-3′ (nested PCR). The primer 5′-CTGCATCCCAAAGAAGCTCATGCAC-3′ and a nested primer, 5′-TCTGCGACTTTGTCAAGCC-3′, were used as gene-specific antisense primers for 5′-RACE PCR. The PCR products, thus, obtained were cloned and sequenced as described above. 3′-RACE and 5′-RACE PCR were performed using LA Taq with GC buffer (Takara Bio, Ohtsu, Japan) for amplification. Preparation of Selenium-depleted Cells—Cells were pregrown for 1 week in the medium without selenite to deplete the internal selenium concentrations. The cells were then inoculated into fresh medium without selenite. The resuspended cells were used as selenium-depleted cells. Northern Blotting Analysis—Aliquots of 10 μg of total RNA were electrophoresed on 1.17! formaldehyde-denaturing agarose gels. RNAs in the gels were transferred to and then UV-cross-linked with Hybond-N+ nylon membranes (GE Healthcare). These RNAs were hybridized with 32P-labeled EhSEP1 generated with a BcaBEST labeling kit (Takara Bio). Hybridization was performed as described by Church and Gilbert (17Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7267) Google Scholar). After washing off the unhybridized probes, radioactivity of the bands was determined by BAS2500 with the Image Gauge software (Fuji Photo). TR Assay—Cells harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C were suspended in phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The cells were then disrupted in a French press. After removing cell debris by centrifugation (20,400 × g for 30 min at 4 °C), the supernatant was desalted by passing through a PD10 column and concentrated by ultrafiltration using an Amicon Ultra-4 (10-kDa molecular mass cutoff; Millipore). TR activity was assayed by both the 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic) acid (DTNB) reduction assay (18Agorio A. Chalar C. Cardozo S. Salinas G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12920-12928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and the insulin reduction assay (19Arner E. S.J. Zhong L. Holmgren A. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 226-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The DTNB reduction assay was performed by a TR assay kit (Sigma-Aldrich) (18Agorio A. Chalar C. Cardozo S. Salinas G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12920-12928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 20Mustacich D. Powis G. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). The reaction was carried out at 25 °C, and the activity was monitored by the increase in absorbance at 412 nm. The change in A412 without NADPH was defined as a base line to calculate the activity. One enzyme unit is defined as 1 μmol of NADPH oxidized per min using the equation ΔA412/(13.6 × 10–3 × 2), as 2 mol of 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid (ϵ412 nm = 13.6 mm–1 cm–1) is produced when 1 mol NADPH is used. For the insulin reduction assay (19Arner E. S.J. Zhong L. Holmgren A. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 226-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), the crude extract was added to a reaction mixture containing 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 80 μm (1.0 mg ml–1) insulin, 1.7 μm recombinant human thioredoxin, and 84 μm NADPH. NADPH oxidation was followed at 340 nm. The change in A340 without human T-cell recombinant thioredoxin and insulin was defined as a base line to calculate the activity. One unit of enzyme was defined as the oxidation of 1 μmol of NADPH (ϵ340 nm = 6.2 mm–1 cm–1) per min using the equation ΔA340/(6.2 × 10–3). The protein concentration was determined using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). To identify selenoproteins in E. huxleyi, the cells were incubated with [75Se]selenite for 1 week in axenic culture. After the preparation of crude extracts, 75Se-labeled proteins were separated through a DEAE anion exchange HPLC column, and each fraction was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Obata and Shiraiwa (11Obata T. Shiraiwa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18462-18468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) demonstrated the presence of at least six 75Se-labeled proteins, designated EhSEP1–6, in E. huxleyi. Similarly, we identified 5 75Se-labeled protein bands with molecular masses of 59, 27, 29, 23, and 31 kDa by silver staining and radioluminography that corresponded to EhSEP1–5, respectively. We focused on the largest and second most abundant protein, EhSEP1, of the six 75Se-labeled proteins for the analysis of its molecular properties. Purified EhSEP1, the major fraction containing the greatest amount of EhSEP1, was obtained using a Diol-150 gel filtration HPLC column (data not shown). The EhSEP1 band in Fig. 1 was extracted and digested with lysyl endopeptidase, and then the internal and N-terminal amino acid sequences were determined by Edman degradation, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” From these analyses we obtained two internal amino acid sequences (shaded in Fig. 2A) but not the N-terminal of the whole EhSEP1, as this was blocked.FIGURE 2Identification of EhSEP1 in a coccolithophorid, E. huxleyi. A, the nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence of EhSEP1. Nucleotide residues are numbered from –113 to 1837. Shaded residues correspond to sequences that were confirmed by peptide sequencing. The nucleotide sequence in italics (–112 to 731) was obtained from the EST sequence of E. huxleyi (NCBI accession number CV069652). A pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase domain (28–984) and a dimerization domain (1096–1437) are shown in a box and with a dotted line, respectively. The pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductases class-I and its C-terminal GCUG active site are shown in bold. The putative SECIS element sequence is underlined, and the non-Watson-Crick quartet and AA pair at an internal loop are highlighted.

Conserved nucleotides in the internal loop and the quartet are shown in bold.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For cloning of a full-length EhSEP1 cDNA, the EST sequence and 3′ and 5′ ends of the sequence were amplified by PCR and RACE PCR, respectively (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). We finally obtained sequences containing the ATG start codon in the 5′-RACE product and a poly-A tail in the 3′-RACE product. The nucleotides and deduced amino acid sequences of the cloned EhSEP1 cDNA are contained in an open-reading frame of 495 amino acid residues, and the 3′-UTR consisted of 349 nucleotides (Fig. 2A). Analysis of the EhSEP1 amino acid sequence indicated the presence of a characteristic thioredoxin reductase domain, the pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase domain, and a dimerization domain. The strongly conserved sequence GGTCVNVGCIP around the cysteine residues, i.e. Cys-54 and Cys-59, at the active site and the C terminus-located redox active site, GCUG, were also found. Sec was located at codon 494 encoded by an in-frame TGA codon (shown as U with an asterisk in Fig. 2A). The SECIS element was found in the 3′-UTR of EhSEP1 mRNA by computational search using SECISearch 2.19 (1Kryukov G.V. Castellano S. Novoselov S.V. Lobanov A.V. Zehtab O. Guigo R. Gladyshev V.N. Science. 2003; 300: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1847) Google Scholar), and the secondary structure of the SECIS element was drawn using the same program (Fig. 2B). The SECIS element in EhSEP1 mRNA contained the conserved functional non-Watson-Crick quartet with the UGAN sequence in the 5′-arm, the NGAN in the 3′-arm, and the unpaired AAN nucleotides in the internal loop. The length of a helix that separated the non-Watson-Crick quartet and the unpaired nucleotides in the internal loop was 15 base pairs as reported in rats (21Vendeland S.C. Beilstein M.A. Yeh J.-Y. Ream W. Whanger P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8749-8753Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the SECIS element of EhSEP1 had a form 2 structure that was similar to animal SECIS (7Krol A. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 765-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences showing homology with EhSEP1 are aligned in Fig. 3. The sequence similarities of EhSEP1 in the public databases were 59.9! to zebrafish (Danio rerio) TR1 (NP_898895.2), 57.9! to human (Homo sapiens) TR1 (NP_877393.1), 57.4! to the unicellular green alga C. reinhardtii TR1 (XP_001696072.1), 56.9! to mouse (Mus musculus) TR1 (NP_001035988.1), 54.0! to the unicellular green alga O. lucimarinus CCE9901 TR1 (Chr_1 (733779, 735290)), 52.0! to the diatom T. pseudonana (newV2.0.genewise.318.11.1), and 52.1! to the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans TR (AAD41826.1). The changes in EhSEP1 mRNA levels under selenium-sufficient and selenium-deficient conditions were analyzed by Northern hybridization (Fig. 4). No significant differences in gene expression of EhSEP1 were observed between the cells containing 10 nm selenite and those without selenium treatment (Fig. 4). Cell growth stopped in the selenium-deficient culture. However, growth recovered when 10 nm selenite was added to the selenium-deficient medium (Fig. 5A). The crude extracts of E. huxleyi grown in selenium-sufficient medium clearly exhibited high TR activity toward both the general substrate DTNB and human thioredoxin (Fig. 5, B and C). When Escherichia coli thioredoxin was used as a substrate, the activity was significantly lower than that with human thioredoxin (data not shown). In both assays the TR activity was strongly inhibited by the TR inhibitor supplied with the TR assay kit (Sigma-Aldrich). In the insulin reduction assay, the activity determined with the inhibitor was nearly the same level as that determined without thioredoxin, indicating that there was no thioredoxin derived from E. huxleyi cells in the extracts (Table 1). TR activity was very low in selenium-depleted cells, but the activity increased about 4-fold to the same level as that in selenium-sufficient cells for about 70 h after the addition of 10 nm selenite (Fig. 5, B and C). The change in TR activity (in ratio to the initial value) was similar in both the DTNB and insulin assays, although the activity was ∼5 times higher in the DTNB assay than that in the insulin assay. Such high activity in the DTNB assay may be due to overestimation and/or difference in substrate specificity. The incorporation of selenium into EhSEP1 was clearly shown to be essential for exhibiting TR activity.TABLE 1Comparison of TR activity determined by the DTNB reduction assay and the insulin reduction assay in crude extracts of E. huxleyiAssayComponentsInhibitorNADPH oxidationμmol min-1 mg protein-1Insulin reductionaCells used for the insulin and DTNB reduction assays were 7- and 3-day cultures, respectively.CompletebHuman T-cell recombinant thioredoxin and DTNB were added as substrates.-36.4 (100!)+6.2 (17.0!)-Insulin-14.1 (38.7!)-Thioredoxin-3.4 (9.2!)DTNB reductionaCells used for the insulin and DTNB reduction assays were 7- and 3-day cultures, respectively.CompletebHuman T-cell recombinant thioredoxin and DTNB were added as substrates.-150.6 (100!)+38.6 (25.6!)a Cells used for the insulin and DTNB reduction assays were 7- and 3-day cultures, respectively.b Human T-cell recombinant thioredoxin and DTNB were added as substrates. Open table in a new tab Two types of TR that reduce thioredoxin in the presence of the electron donor NADPH have been characterized to date; one in animals (mammalian-type TR) (22Sun Q.-A. Wu Y. Zappacosta F. Jeang K.-T. Lee B.J. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24522-24530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) and another in Archaea, bacteria, plants, fungi, and some protozoa (NTR) (23Russel M. Model P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9015-9019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian-type TR is categorized into three TRs: the selenoproteins TR1 (cytosolic TR), TR2 (thioredoxin/glutathione reductase), and TR3 (mitochondrial TR). Although both amino acid sequences and catalytic mechanisms of action differ, the functions of the TRs are almost the same (20Mustacich D. Powis G. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 24Hirt P.R. Müller S. Embley T.M. Coombs G.H. Trends Parasitol. 2002; 18: 302-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In photosynthetic organisms there are two additional TRs that are not selenoproteins. One is ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase (FTR), which reduces thioredoxin by using photoreduced ferredoxin as an electron donor and is localized in the chloroplast (25Jacquot J.-P. Lancelin J.-M. Meyer Y. New Phytol. 1997; 136: 543-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Therefore, FTR might require NADPH as an electron donor to reduce ferredoxins via ferredoxin-NADPH oxidoreductase. The activity in the insulin reduction assay without the addition of human thioredoxin was very low (Table 1), and therefore, FTR is not involved in the TR activity in the crude extracts of E. huxleyi. The other is chloroplast-located NADPH thioredoxin reductase (NTRC), which is non-selenium-containing TR that is formed by both a NTR and a thioredoxin-like domain. NTRC reduces 2-Cys peroxiredoxins using NADPH as an electron donor and is functional in the chloroplast (26Spinola M.C. Perez-Ruiz J.M. Pulido P. Kirchsteiger K. Guinea M. Gonzalez M. Cejudo F.J.

Perez-Ruiz J.M. Spinola M.C. Cejudo F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43821-43827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Because the TR activity in the crude extracts of E. huxleyi was detected by thioredoxin reduction, the activity should not be due to NTRC. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the second most abundant selenoprotein EhSEP1 in E. huxleyi (Fig. 2) showed a high degree of identity with TR1 in animals (Fig. 3). Both motifs in the N-terminal region of the protein with the active site disulfide bond (CVNVGC) located in the FAD binding domain and with a pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase class-1 domain are highly conserved. Furthermore, EhSEP1 possesses a C-terminal dimerization domain and an active site (GCUG) involving a selenocysteine residue encoded by the TGA codon at the C terminus. These features of E. huxleyi TR are the same as those of TR1. We also found the SECIS element in the 3′-UTR of the cDNA sequences that function in the insertion of Sec at the translational level. Eukaryotic SECIS elements are folded into two slightly different secondary structures, designated form 1 and form 2 (7Krol A. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 765-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The green alga C. reinhardtii, which does not require selenium for its growth, contains TR1, and its SECIS element is form 1 (8Novoselov S.V. Rao M. Onoshko N.V. Zhi H. Kryukov G.V. Xiang Y. Weeks D.P. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3681-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the SECIS element of EhSEP1 differs from the form 1 SECIS in the TR1 of C. reinhardtii and contains the form 2 SECIS like the human TR1, although both E. huxleyi and C. reinhardtii are photosynthetic organisms. However, both E. huxleyi and humans, but not C. reinhardtii, are organisms for which selenium is essential for life. The haptophyte alga E. huxleyi belongs to the kingdom Chromista, possessing a chloroplast that evolved from red algae via secondary endosymbiosis, and its phylogenetic position is far distant from the primary symbionts, green algae, and from mammals (28Cavalier-Smith T. Eur. J. Protistol. 2003; 39: 338-348Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Although the difference in the SECIS form is thought to lead to no difference in function of the synthesized proteins (29Grundner-Culemann E. Martin III, G.W. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. RNA. 1999; 5: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), it may be related to the selenium requirement for transcriptional and/or translational regulation. The results of the analysis using the available N-terminal transit peptide prediction programs (SOSUI, iPSORT, TargetP 1.1, and SignalP 3.0) (30Hirokawa T. Boon-Chieng S. Mitaku S. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 378-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar, 31Bannai H. Tamada Y. Maruyama O. Nakai K. Miyano S.

Biol. 2004; 340: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (5640) Google Scholar) showed that EhSEP1 did not include the transit peptide. Therefore, EhSEP1 is thought to be localized in the cytoplasm. The molecular mass of EhSEP1 predicted from the deduced amino acids sequence was 52.2 kDa (Fig. 2). This value is approximately the same as that of EhSEP1 determined experimentally on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). In EhSEP1, the initiating methionine has not yet been precisely identified because the N-terminal residue of EhSEP1 was blocked. However, the nucleotide sequence of EhSEP1 cDNA revealed the presence of an in-frame stop codon upstream of a putative initiation codon. Therefore, EhSEP1 would be translated from the putative initiation codon located at the most upstream region of the sequence. We studied the effects of selenium on the levels of EhSEP1 mRNA and enzyme activity of TR under selenium-deficient and selenium-sufficient conditions (Figs. 4 and 5). According to genomic information of photosynthetic aquatic phototrophs, a cyanobacterium (Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (34Hishiya S. Hatakeyama W. Mizota Y. Hosoya-Matsuda N. Motohashi K. Ikeuchi M. Hisabori T. Plant Cell Physiol. 2008; 49: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)) and a red alga (C. merolae) possess FTR (NP_442409.1, BAC76288.1) and NTR (NP_443054.1, c09f0014). The green alga C. reinhardtii possesses FTR (XP_001693262.1), NTR (XP_001699827.1), NTRC (XP_001689807.1), and TR1, and O. lucimarinus possesses FTR (XP_001421554.1), NTRC (XP_001422184.1), and TR1. The diatom T. pseudonana possesses FTR (estExt_fgenesh1_pm.C_chr_130010), NTR (estExt_gwp_gw1.C_chr_40101), and TR1. Therefore, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that the TR activity determined experimentally in this study was due to TRs other than EhSEP1. However, we suggest that the TR activity in the extracts of E. huxleyi was due to EhSEP1 for the following reasons. 1) when we searched homologues of various TRs of human (TR1: NP_877393.1) and A. thaliana (NTRC: NP_565954.1; FTR: NP_568195.1, NP_197735.1, and NP_178547.1; NTR: Q39243.2 and Q39242.2) as queries in the E. huxleyi EST data base, only EhSEP1 was found. Actually, five EST clones were found to be homologous to EhSEP1, whereas no EST clones were to A. thaliana TRs. 2) There are no other selenoproteins of which the molecular mass is similar to the mammalian-type TRs on 2D-SDS-PAGE in the extracts of E. huxleyi (11Obata T. Shiraiwa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18462-18468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). 3) TR activity detected in selenium-depleted cells was quickly recovered when selenite was added to the medium. Altogether, our findings strongly suggest that TR activity in the crude extracts of E. huxleyi is due to EhSEP1 that is induced when selenium is present during growth. The mRNA levels of EhSEP1 remained nearly constant, except for a transient slight increase within 2 h when selenium-deficient cells were transferred to selenium-sufficient conditions (Fig. 4). In rat liver TR activity was markedly down-regulated under selenium-deficient conditions, but mRNA level decreased only slightly (35Hadley K.B. Sunde R.A. J. Nutr. Biochem. 2001; 12: 693-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Our observations are similar to these results in rat liver. The results of transcript and enzyme activity suggest that the translation of EhSEP1 might be in response to the levels of available selenium. In contrast, Obata and Shiraiwa (11Obata T. Shiraiwa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18462-18468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) reported that the mRNA levels of EhSEP2 were strongly stimulated by the addition of selenite to Selenium-deficient cells. This suggests that the regulation of selenoprotein synthesis differs depending on proteins. Higher plants have no mammalian-type TRs. On the other hand, in marine photosynthetic organisms mammalian-type TRs have been found with the accumulation of genomic information over the last several years. Lobanov et al. (9Lobanov A.V. Fomenko D.E. Zhang Y. Sengupta A. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. Genome Biology. 2007; 8: R198Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) reported that marine organisms contain more selenoproteins than terrestrial organisms, suggesting that selenium is used more efficiently in marine organisms. TR is a very important enzyme because it reduces cytosolic thioredoxins, which regulate many oxidoreductases that play key roles in cellular metabolism. For example, cytosolic thioredoxins are thought to provide electrons for the reduction of ribonucleotides, hydrogen peroxide, peroxiredoxins, etc. (36Meyer Y. Siala W. Bashandy T. Riondet C. Vignols F. Reichheld J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1783: 589-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In contrast, chloroplastic thioredoxins, which are reduced by FTR, mainly regulate the activity of enzymes implicated in photosynthetic carbon assimilation. However, there are some thioredoxins for which functions have not yet been identified. Therefore, further analyses of mammalian-type TRs (EhSEP1, etc.) in marine photosynthetic organisms would be useful to elucidate how the thioredoxin system operates in these organisms. In conclusion, we identified EhSEP1, a gene encoding the selenoprotein TR1, from the haptophyte E. huxleyi. The secondary structure of SECIS is the same as form 2 in E. huxleyi, which is similar to that of humans but different from that of the green alga C. reinhardtii. The changes in transcription of EhSEP1 and TR activity with selenium availability suggest that EhSEP1 is regulated by selenium upon translation. Further studies on selenoproteins in marine organisms will be necessary to elucidate how these organisms developed such a strategy for selenium utilization as an essential element to survive in marine environments. We are grateful to Dr. Toshihiro Obata for kind help and discussions during this study. We also thank the staff of the Isotope Center of the University of Tsukuba for generous help."

They are hexamers regulated by GTP (allosteric activator) and UTP (inhibitor). We describe here the 2.8 Å crystal structure of Escherichia coli UMP kinase bound to GTP. The GTP-binding site, situated at 15 Å from the UMP-binding site and at 24 Å from the ATP-binding site, is delineated by two contiguous dimers. The overall structure, as compared with those bound to UMP, UDP, or UTP, shows a rearrangement of its quaternary structure: GTP induces an 11° opening of the UMP kinase dimer, resulting in a tighter dimer-dimer interaction. A nucleotide-free UMP kinase dimer has an intermediate opening. Superposition of our structure with that of archaeal UMP kinases, which are also hexamers, shows that a loop appears to hamper any GTP binding in archeal enzymes. This would explain the absence of activating effect of GTP on this group of UMP kinases. Among GTP-binding residues, the Asp-93 is the most conserved in bacterial UMP kinases. In the previously published structures of E. coli UMP kinase, this residue was shown to be involved in hydrogen bonds between the subunits of a dimer. Its substitution by an alanine decreases the cooperativity for UTP binding and suppresses the reversal by GTP of UTP inhibition.

The resulting UDP is further phosphorylated by nucleoside diphosphate kinase to UTP, serving as a substrate for RNA polymerase or as a precursor for CTP. UDP can also be reduced by ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase to 2′-deoxy-UDP, which serves in the production of dTTP and dCTP used for DNA synthesis. UMP kinase UMP kinase from E. coli UMP kinase from H. influenzae 5′-adenylylimidodiphosphate temperature of half-inactivation UDP, or UTP The eukaryotic UMP/CMP kinases phosphorylate with comparable efficiency both UMP and CMP. Conversely, bacteria possess two distinct enzymes, each specific for either UMP or CMP. Bacterial UMPKs exist in solution as stable homohexamers, whereas eukaryotic UMP/CMP kinases are monomers. We previously solved three crystal structures of UMPK from Escherichia coli (UMPKeco) in complex with UMP, UDP, or UTP (1Briozzo P. Evrin C. Meyer P. Assairi L. Joly N. Bârzu O. Gilles A.M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7003-7011Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) but with significantly higher solubility than the wild-type protein. These structures showed that the overall fold of the monomer is different from that of eukaryotic UMP/CMP kinases. Besides, the three-dimensional structure of the UMPKeco hexamer is closely related to all of the other bacterial UMPKs structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank. Bacterial UMPKs are submitted to allosteric activation by GTP and to feedback inhibition by UTP, the major product of the reaction they catalyze (3Serina L. Blondin C. Krin E. Sismeiro O. Danchin A. Sakamoto H. Gilles A.M. Bârzu O. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5066-5074Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This contributes to balance the synthesis of purine versus pyrimidine nucleoside triphosphates. The crystal structure of UMPKeco in complex with UTP showed that the nucleotide, in its magnesium-free form, interacts with the phosphate acceptor site. Kinetic experiments showed indeed that magnesium-free UTP is a competitive cooperative inhibitor (4Evrin C. Straut M. Slavova-Azmanova N. Bucurenci N. Onu A. Assairi L. Ionescu M. Palibroda N.

GTP is the common allosteric effector for all known bacterial UMP kinases. In Gram-negative organisms, it suppresses the inhibition by excess of UMP and reverses the UTP binding and inhibition. In Gram-positive bacteria, GTP increases the affinity for ATP through lowering of cooperativity for this phosphate donor nucleotide. For all bacterial species, UMPK appears as essential for growth (5Smallshaw J. Kelln R. Genetics. 1992; 11: 59-65Google Scholar, 6Yamanaka K. Ogura T. Niki H. Hiraga S. J.

February 23, International Patent WO 2006/018618 A1. 2006; Google Scholar). An interesting path to follow is probably the design of inhibitors targeting the allosteric GTP-binding site. However, so far there is no published structure of this site allowing its detailed analysis. Here we describe the crystal structure of UMPKeco bound to GTP. We discuss its implications for the enzyme regulation mechanism, with the help of site-directed mutagenesis experiments. Chemicals—Nucleotides, restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, Tfu DNA polymerase, and coupling enzymes were from Roche Applied Science, Qbiogene Inc., or Sigma. NDP kinase from Dictyostelium discoideum (2000 units/mg protein) was kindly provided by I. Lascu (Institut de Biochimie et Génétique Cellulaire, Université de Bordeaux). Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, Growth Conditions, and DNA Manipulations—General DNA manipulations were performed as described by Sambrook et al. (11Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The construct of UMPKeco D159N (considered as the reference form) with an N-terminal His tag was previously reported (1Briozzo P. Evrin C. Meyer P. Assairi L. Joly N. Bârzu O. Gilles A.M. J. Biol.

The single mutants N72A and D93A were constructed by the one-tube PCR-based mutagenesis method (12Picard V. Bock S.C. Methods Mol.

The PCR product was cloned at the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites of the vector pET28a, giving the plasmids pCE1.1.1 and pCE1.1.2, respectively. The double mutant N72A/D93A was constructed in the same way but used pCE1.1.2 as a template and 3′-UMPK N72A as a mutagenic primer, giving the plasmid pCE1.1.5. These plasmids were sequenced to verify either integrity or incorporation of the desired modifications. They were introduced into E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pDIA17 (13Munier H. Gilles A.M. Glaser P. Krin E. Danchin A. Sarfati R. Bârzu O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The recombinant strains were grown in 2× yeast extract tryptone medium supplemented with kanamycin (70 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (30 μg/ml) at 37 °C to overproduce the UMP kinase. When the optical density reached 1.3 at 600 nm, 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to the medium to induce the expression of recombinant proteins, and the growth was carried on for an additional 3 h. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation and served as source for protein purification. Purification of UMPK and Activity Assay—Each N-terminal His-tagged variant of UMPKeco, overproduced in E. coli, was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography using the QIA express system (14Crowe J. Dobeli H. Gentz R. Hochuli E. Stuber D. Henco K. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 31: 371-387PubMed Google Scholar) after sonication of the pellet in a buffer containing 3 mm UTP. The His-tagged D159N variant was then subjected to a Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration chromatography in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, before crystallization. The other recombinant proteins (purity >95!, as indicated by SDS-PAGE) were stored at room temperature in elution buffer containing 50 mm Na2HPO4, 150 mm imidazole, and 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0. Protein concentration was measured according to Bradford (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Laemmli (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Mass spectra of purified proteins were recorded on a quadrupole mass spectrophotometer API-365 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) equipped with an ion spray (nebulizer-assisted electrospray) source. The UMP kinase activity was determined at 30 °C (0.5-ml final volume) using a coupled spectrophotometric assay (17Blondin C. Serina L. Wiesmuller L. Gilles A.M. Bârzu O. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 220: 219-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The reaction medium contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.2 mm NADH, 2 units each of lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, and NDP kinase, and various concentrations of ATP, MgCl2, and UMP. A 2 mm excess of MgCl2 over the concentration of NTPs was used, as described previously (4Evrin C. Straut M. Slavova-Azmanova N. Bucurenci N. Onu A. Assairi L. Ionescu M. Palibroda N. Bârzu O.

The reaction was triggered with appropriately diluted UMPKeco in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, and the decrease of absorbance at 340 nm was recorded. One unit of UMPK corresponds to 1 μmol of product formed/min. The kinetic results were fitted to one of the following two equations, using the nonlinear least squares fitting analysis of Kaleidagraph software, v=Vm[S]/(Km+[S])(Eq. 1) v=Vm[S]/(Km+[S]+[S]2/KI)(Eq. 2) where v is the steady-state velocity, Vm the maximal rate, [S] is the substrate concentration (i.e. ATP or UMP in the forward reaction), Km is the Michaelis-Menten constant, and KI the inhibition constant. The cooperativity of inhibition by UTP of UMP kinases was expressed by the equation Km′ = Km (1 + [UTP]n/KnUTP), where Km and Km′ are the apparent KUMPm in the absence and presence of a given concentration of UTP, n is the cooperative index, and KUTP is the concentration of UTP doubling the apparent KUMPm (4Evrin C. Straut M. Slavova-Azmanova N. Bucurenci N. Onu A. Assairi L. Ionescu M. Palibroda N. Bârzu O. Gilles A.M. J. Biol.

The thermal stability of the different variants of UMPK was tested by incubating the purified enzyme (1 mg/ml) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) containing 100 mm NaCl at a temperature between 30 and 80 °C for 10 min in the absence or presence of various nucleotides (UTP or GTP). The results were expressed as a percentage of residual activity as compared with nonincubated controls and were used to calculate the temperature of half-inactivation (Tm). Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals of the histidine-tagged D159N variant were grown at 20 °C by the vapor diffusion method. The 4-μl hanging drop contained 4 mg/ml UMPKeco (in 50 mm Tris-HCl, buffer pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl), 22.5 mm GTP, and 21.5! (w/v) polyethylene glycol 400 (in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.6) as a precipitant. Drops were equilibrated with a reservoir solution containing 43! polyethylene glycol 400. Crystals were allowed to grow for several weeks before data collection. They were frozen at 100 K before data collection (cryoprotection being achieved by the polyethylene glycol 400 precipitant). Data were collected on the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) beam-line ID23-1, with a 1.2826 Å wavelength. They were processed and scaled with XDS (18Kabsch W. J. Appl.

Nature. 1992; 355: 372-375Crossref Scopus (3872) Google Scholar). Simulated annealing was initially used, as well as noncrystallographic restraints. The latter applied to two domains comprising residues 5-171 and 183-241 and were progressively loosened during the first 10 refinements. Then the six molecules of the asymmetric unit were refined as different models, using individual B factors. In the final steps, we placed water molecules in residual density above 2.5 S.D. values. The final model contains six polypeptide chains, A-F, six GTP molecules, G-L, and 36 water molecules. A summary of the refinement results together with model statistics is given in Table 1. Models were superposed with the procedure implemented in O (24Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) with defaults, and the relevant root mean square deviations for Cα atoms were calculated. Buried surface in protein-protein interaction was calculated using the Protein-Protein interaction server (25Jones S. Thornton J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2289) Google Scholar). Relative movements of the monomers in a dimer were calculated using the protein domain motion program DynDom (26Hayward S. Berendsen H.J. Proteins. 1998; 30: 144-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). The Protein Data Bank code of the UMPKeco-GTP complex is 2v4y. The Overall Hexameric Structure—The three previously published structures of UMPKeco bound either to the substrate (UMP), reaction product (UDP), or inhibitor (UTP) were obtained from R3 rhomboedral crystals. The asymmetric unit contained a dimer of two subunits (each monomer contains 241 residues) related by noncrystallographic symmetry. The crystallographic 3-fold symmetry axis reconstituted the biological hexamer. Conversely, the complex of UMPKeco with GTP crystallized in the orthorhombic P212121 space group (Table 1) with an equivalent biological hexamer in the asymmetric unit. The six subunits are related by noncrystallographic 3-fold and 2-fold axes (Fig. 1A). The six monomers that constitute the active hexamer show very small differences among each other: the root mean square deviation values between any two subunits of UMPKeco-GTP have an average value of 0.4 Å (extreme values 0.28 and 0.55 Å) on 236 Cα atoms. In the previously published structures in complex with UMP, UDP, or UTP (hereafter referred to as UXP), the dimer assembly buried 11! of the total surface, whereas interactions between two neighboring dimers buried only 6.5! of the surface. In the UMPKeco-GTP structure, the mean value of the buried surface between two monomers in a position homologous to that of a UMPKeco-UMP dimer is 11.8! of the accessible surface. This value is higher than that calculated between two neighboring monomers from contiguous dimers, 8.0!. Since the buried surface is larger inside a dimer than between contiguous ones, the enzyme complexed to its allosteric effector can be considered as a trimer of dimers (colored blue, green, and red in Fig. 1), as for the UXP-bound structures. Also like those structures, the interactions between two monomers of a dimer (e.g. the cyan and dark blue ones in the right part of Fig. 1A) mainly involve the α3 helix, the longest secondary structure of the enzyme. The GTP Binding Sites in the Hexamer—Whereas the substrates, UMP and ATP, are engulfed in a unique monomer (Fig. 1B), the positive regulator is inserted between two dimers of the enzyme hexamer. For instance, in the right part of Fig. 1A, the cavity of the GTP molecule H (indicated by a vertical arrow) is delineated by the blue and red dimers. In addition, the nucleobase is inserted between the two facing α3 helices from the cyan and dark blue monomers of the blue dimer. Viewed along the 3-fold axis (Fig. 1A, left), the six bound GTP molecules form an internal crown, around which the UMP-binding sites (Fig. 1B, left, with UMP in orange) form a concentric circle. The ATP-binding sites form a more external concentric crown. Looking along a 2-fold axis (i.e. orthogonally to the 3-fold axis), the GTP molecules form two opposite and distant layers (“polar” positions) of 3 nucleotides each (Fig. 1A, right). The positive regulator molecules are rather far from the two layers of ATP molecules (black, in a “tropical” position) that surround a central layer (“equatorial”) of UMP molecules (Fig. 1B, right). The distance from the GTP site to the nearest nucleotide-binding site, that of UMP, is 15 Å. The ATP site is by far more distant (24 Å) from the GTP-binding site. Such distances are not unusual in allosteric enzymes; in the canonical case of aspartate transcarbamylase, which possesses distinct catalytic and regulatory subunits, the distance is 60 Å. In human glycogen phosphorylase, a homodimer, catalytic and allosteric sites can be distant by more than 30 Å (27Hardy J.A. Wells J.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 706-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The Movements Induced by Binding GTP or Uridine Nucleotides—The UMPKeco-GTP hexamer closely resembles that of the ligand-free enzyme from the Gram-negative bacterium Haemophilus influenzae, which shares 75! sequence identity with UMPKeco. The root mean square deviation value between the monomers of each enzyme is 0.82 Å (on 229 Cα atoms), and that between the two hexamers is only 1.01 Å (on 1375 Cα atoms). These values are even lower than the root mean square deviation between the UMPKeco-GTP and UMPKeco-UTP hexamers (1.64 Å on 1278 Cα atoms). As compared with the previously published structures in complex with UXP (see Fig. 2A for UMPKeco-UTP, enzyme green), there is a rotation of the two monomers inside a dimer that makes it more open (Fig. 2A, GTP-bound enzyme red). This opening move of the dimers induced by GTP binding, and the opposite dimer closure induced by UTP binding are represented diagrammatically on Fig. 2B. When compared with the UTP-bound form, GTP binding induces an 11° rotation within the UMPK dimer (Fig. 2C) along an axis going through α3 helices and almost parallel to the hexamer 3-fold axis. This results in a movement of 6.7 Å of the Glu-194 α carbon from helix α6, the most distant residue from the rotation axis. In the structure of the nucleotide-free enzyme from H. influenzae, the dimer position is intermediary between those of UMPKeco-GTP and UMPKeco-UTP. Thus, opposite rotations of the two monomers in a dimer are induced by GTP (opening) and UTP (closure). The GTP dimer opening results in a tighter dimer-dimer interaction, which is reflected by the increase (from 6.5 to 8!) in the percentage of the surface buried, as mentioned above. At the monomer level, when comparing UMPKeco-GTP monomer to the previously published structures of the UXP-bound enzyme, the most noticeable difference is the move of the α2 helix, opening the UMP-binding cavity (Fig. 2D). The largest Cα move is that of Gly-63 (6.3 Å induced by UMP binding), the N-terminal residue of α2, which can make a hydrogen bond with the ribose from the bound nucleotide. Kinetic experiments have shown that 2′-deoxy-UMP is not a substrate but a competitive inhibitor (28Evrin C. Structure and Regulatory Mechanisms of Bacterial Uridine Monophosphate Kinases, Ph.D. thesis, University of Paris 7. 2006; Google Scholar). With this ligand, there is no induced fit, related to the 2′-hydroxyl of the nucleotide, that closes the active site, explaining why the catalysis cannot proceed. The superposition of UMPKeco-GTP monomer with that of the free enzyme from H. influenzae indicates no essential backbone difference in the phosphate acceptor binding site. Such a similarity is also observed for the more distant ATP-binding site. This is in accordance with the particular activation mechanism observed with GTP in the E. coli enzyme; GTP does not significantly change the Km or Vm for either substrate (ATP or UMP), its actual effect being to reverse the inhibition by UTP or by excess of UMP. Residues Involved in GTP Binding—The positive regulator is entrapped by enzyme subunits (cyan and pink in Fig. 3A) from two neighboring dimers (blue and red in Fig. 1A). The base moiety is also close to the N extremity of the α3 helix from the subunit dark blue in Fig. 1A. No direct hydrogen bond is established in that case, but there is a Van der Waals contact (the closest distance being 3.4 Å) between the guanine and Asn-72 side chain (indicated in Fig. 3A). As shown on Fig. 3B, the GTP-binding domain is restricted to several residues from 92 to 130, belonging mainly to the α3 helix, β3 strand, α4 helix, and β5 strand. For all six monomers (with minor differences among monomers in the number of hydrogen bonds established between the terminal amino groups of arginine and the atoms of the base), Arg-92 and Asp-93 are the residues interacting with the purine moiety of GTP. In addition, for all subunits the ring from Trp-119 is close from the guanine base and sandwiches it with the help of the His-96 imidazole ring. The only residue that interacts with the ribose is Arg-127, hydrogen-bonded to the 3′-OH. This is consistent with the observation that 2′-deoxy-GTP is still able to activate UMP kinases (4Evrin C. Straut M. Slavova-Azmanova N. Bucurenci N. Onu A. Assairi L. Ionescu M. Palibroda N. Bârzu O. Gilles A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7242-7253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Most of the enzyme-GTP interactions occur with its polyphosphate chain: His-96 interacts with the γ-phosphate (and in addition, for the C monomer, with the α-phosphate); Arg-103 interacts with the β-phosphate (and α-phosphate for monomers C and D); Arg-130 interacts with the β- and γ-phosphates; Asn-101 side chain interacts with the γ-phosphate; and for some GTP molecules (G, H, and I), Ser-124 side chain interacts with the β phosphate. Only few of the GTP-binding residues are conserved among various UMPKs, and the low conservation among Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial enzymes is noteworthy. Asp-93 appears as the most conserved residue, followed by Arg-103 and Arg-130. Furthermore, residues from UMPKeco that interact with GTP are not conserved in archaeal UMPKs. We previously showed that Thr-138 and Asn-140, which participate in the binding by UMPKeco of UMP as well as of UDP or UTP, are involved in a “cross-talk” between vicinal dimers (1Briozzo P. Evrin C.

The substitution of Asn-140 by Ala suppressed the cooperativity of the inhibition caused by UTP but not its reversal by GTP (4Evrin C. Straut M. Slavova-Azmanova N. Bucurenci N. Onu A. Assairi L. Ionescu M. Palibroda N. Bârzu O. Gilles A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7242-7253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To further elucidate the structural basis of enzyme activity regulation by the two antagonist nucleotides, we examined the role of the hydrogen bonds implied in the formation of the dimer itself. Helix α3 (pink in Fig. 4A) forms most of the dimer interface. In the structures complexed with any of three uridine nucleotides, the two head-and-tail α3 helices from facing monomers are connected through hydrogen bonds between Asp-93 and Asn-72 at each extremity of these helices. As compared with the UTP-bound form of UMPKeco (green in Fig. 4B), binding of GTP induces a flipping of the Asn-72 side chain, which can no longer interact with the side chain of Asp-93 from the facing subunit (GTP-bound UMPKeco is red and superposes well with the nucleotide-free UMPKhi (gray)). This is correlated with a slightly different position of the two neighboring α3 helices, which appear farther apart from each other. The distance between α-carbons from the two terminal"

The absence of dystrophin results in muscle fiber necrosis and regeneration, leading to progressive muscle fiber loss. Utrophin is a close analogue of dystrophin. A substantial, ectopic expression of utrophin in the extrasynaptic sarcolemma of dystrophin-deficient muscle fibers can prevent deleterious effects of dystrophin deficiency. An alternative approach for the extrasynaptic up-regulation of utrophin involves the augmentation of utrophin transcription via the endogenous utrophin A promoter using custom-designed transcriptional activator proteins with zinc finger (ZFP) motifs. We tested a panel of custom-designed ZFP for their ability to activate the utrophin A promoter. Expression of one such ZFP efficiently increased, in a time-dependent manner, utrophin transcript and protein levels both in vitro and in vivo. In dystrophic mouse (mdx) muscles, administration of adenoviral vectors expressing this ZFP led to significant enhancement of muscle function with decreased necrosis, restoration of the dystrophin-associated proteins, and improved resistance to eccentric contractions. These studies provide evidence that specifically designed ZFPs can act as strong transcriptional activators of the utrophin A promoter. These may thus serve as attractive therapeutic agents for dystrophin deficiency states such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

These may thus serve as attractive therapeutic agents for dystrophin deficiency states such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Utrophin is a large cytoskeletal protein that is closely related to dystrophin. Although utrophin is present throughout the sarcolemma in muscle fibers during development (1.Schofield J. Houzelstein D. Davies K. Buckingham M. Edwards Y.H. Dev. Dyn. 1993; 198: 254-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), in normal adult muscle, utrophin is only present at the neuromuscular and myotendinous junctions (2.Karpati G. Carpenter S.

Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 1997; 23: 399-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The therapeutic effect of up-regulating extrasynaptic utrophin has been tested experimentally through transgenesis (9.Tinsley J. Deconinck N. Fisher R. Kahn D. Phelps S. Gillis J.M. Davies K. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1441-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) or gene transfer (10.Gilbert R. Nalbantoglu J. Petrof B.J. Ebihara S. Guibinga G.H. Tinsley J.M. Kamen A. Massie B. Davies K.E.

In this regard, compared with dystrophin replacement, up-regulation of utrophin may have an advantage because utrophin is a self protein and not recognized as a neoantigen as is dystrophin. Utrophin is expressed from two distinct promoters, utrophin A and utrophin B (12.Dennis C.L. Tinsley J.M. Deconinck A.E. Davies K.E.

Deconinck A.E. Davies K.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1646-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), whereas the utrophin B promoter is found within a large intron 50 kb downstream of exon 2 and generates a transcript with a unique exon 1 that splices into exon 3 of the utrophin gene (13.Burton E.A.

Synapse-specific expression of utrophin A is mediated, in part, via the binding of the ets-factors GABP alpha and beta to the N-box (14.Gramolini A.O. Angus L.M. Schaeffer L. Burton E.A. Tinsley J.M.

Miller J.C. Pabo C.O. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2003; 2: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). ZF proteins (ZFP) target G-rich sequences. The utrophin A promoter is a TATA-less promoter with a GC-rich 5′-upstream area, located within a CpG island (12.Dennis C.L. Tinsley J.M. Deconinck A.E. Davies K.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1646-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus, we have chosen to target the utrophin A promoter with ZFPs to activate it in a constitutive manner (i.e. without need for the sustained presence of neural factors). We have evaluated the ZFPs in vitro and selected the best one for in vivo testing in the mdx mouse. Design and Synthesis ZFP Gene—DNase I-accessible chromatin regions of the utrophin promoter A were mapped in nuclei isolated from mouse primary hepatocytes (26.Ponder K.P. Gupta S. Leland F.

The amino acid code of the three-finger proteins designed to bind utrophin-A-specific sequences was selected as described (28.Liu Q. Xia Z. Zhong X. Case C.C. J. Biol.

Briefly, six overlapping oligonucleotides, with an overlap region of 15 bp were used in the presence of Pfu thermostable DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI), in a four-cycle PCR reaction at an annealing temperature of 45 °C. Each fragment was directly cloned into pUC19 for sequencing. Purification of ZFP Fusion Protein and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Each resulting ZFP gene was cloned into the pMal-c2 vector (New England Biolabs) as a fusion with DNA sequences encoding maltose-binding protein. Maltose-binding protein-ZFP fusions were then expressed and affinity-purified using an amylose resin (New England Biolabs). Binding experiments were performed as described before (30.Corbi N. Libri V. Fanciulli M. Tinsley J.M. Davies K.E. Passananti C. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1076-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In competitive experiments, unlabeled oligonucleotides were added at 50- or 100-fold molar excess of the amount of labeled DNA. The oligonucleotides used as probes were 20 bp in length and contained 9-bp core sequences for ZFP to target. Mutant probes were designed to substitute 9-bp core sequences. Signal detection was preformed by using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) using the ImageQuaNT program. Construct of Expression Vector and Preparation of Recombinant Adenoviruses—The engineered ZFP gene fragment was subcloned into p190E8, which contained a 7-amino acid nuclear localization sequence (Pro-Lys-Lys-Lys-Arg-Lys-Val) from simian virus 40 large T-antigen, a VP16 activator domain from human herpes simplex virus amino acids 413–490, and a FLAG peptide (Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys). A HindIII-EcoRI fragment, which contained all elements, was then cloned into pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen) (Fig. 2). Control vector pNLS modified from pcDNA3 only contains nuclear localization sequence and FLAG peptide. To generate the adenoviral vector, ZFP fragment containing the elements NLS, VP16, and FLAG was obtained by PCR and cloned into vector pIRES2-EGFP (Clontech) XhoI-EcoRI site. The 1.7-kb CB promoter (CMV enhancer and chicken β-actin promoter) was released with SalI and XhoI from plasmid pCAGGS and cloned into pIRES2-EGFP NheI-XhoI site; a poly(A) signal fragment was obtained by PCR from pCAGGS and cloned into NotI site of pIRES2-EGFP. A 4.2-kb expression cassette containing all elements was cloned into the adenovirus vector pC4SHU (Microbix Biosystems Inc., Ontario, Canada) NotI site to construct vector pH6. For preparation of recombinant Ad-ZFP, plasmid pH6 was transfected into Cre-293 cells by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations, and infection rate was confirmed by observing the GFP signal. Adenovirus CMV-GFP was produced as a control. Adenoviruses were amplified using the 293Cre-loxP system and purified by two consecutive continuous CsCl gradient centrifugations as described previously (31.Gilbert R. Liu A.-B. Petrof B.J. Nalbantoglu J. Karpati G. Mol. Ther. 2002; 6: 1-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The titer (virus particles/ml) was determined by measuring the optical density at 260 nm. Infectious titers were determined by counting GFP green cells after infection of 293A cells. Luciferase Reporter Gene Assays—For reporter gene analysis, a 2.98-kb HindIII-KpnI fragment of the utrophin promoter A was subcloned from a BAC clone, which contains the mouse utrophin genomic DNA 5′-region (Clone ID: RP23–111d4, BACPAC Resources Center) and inserted into pGL3 basic vector (Promega) to generate the luciferase reporter plasmid pUA-luc. All cell lines (COS-1, HEK293, NIH3T3, and C2C12) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. The pUA-luc reporter construct, ZFP plasmid, and pSV-β-galactosidase control plasmid (Promega) were co-transfected into the cells by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or SuperFect reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Transfection efficiency was assessed in each independent experiment by the transfection of a pCMV-LacZ expression plasmid (Clontech) as control. Cells were collected 48 h after transfection, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activity assays were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Activation of Endogenous Utrophin A Promoter in Vitro—Mouse myoblast C2C12 cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/10-cm plate. One day later, plasmids encoding ZFP were transfected into the cells using SuperFect reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After selection for 2 weeks in the presence of G418 (800 μg/ml) (Invitrogen), the pools of cells were harvested for assaying protein expression. For Ad-ZFP infections, myoblasts were plated at 90% confluency, Ad-ZFP was added at a multiplicity of infection of 500, and cells were harvested after 24 h. To produce myotubes, medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum was substituted by adding 2% horse serum. After 4 days, myoblast cultures were completely differentiated into myotubes, Ad-ZFP was added into the medium, and cells were cultured further for 4 days prior to harvest for Western blot analysis. Activation of Endogenous Utrophin A Promoter in Vivo—All aspects of the study were approved by the institutional animal ethics committee according to McGill University guidelines for animal care. Dystrophin-deficient mdx neonatal mice (4-day-old, Jackson Laboratory) were directly injected with 5 μl of Ad-ZFP at a titer of 5 × 1011 virus particles/ml into the right tibialis anterior muscle, whereas the contralateral side was injected with Ad-GFP to serve as a within-animal control. The mice were euthanized at either 20 or 80 days following which the TA muscles were removed for further analysis. Analysis of mRNA and Protein Levels—For utrophin mRNA analysis, total RNA was extracted from the muscle using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Quantitative reverse transcriptase (RT)-Real-Time PCR was performed on a SmartCycleR (Cepheid Inc.) using QuantiTect Probe RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen). The primer and probe set (AAACAGGGAGGCACATTGTC, GCCCAGGTCATTGTAGAGGA, and FAM-ACGGACAACCCGAAAAGCATGGACGA-TAMRA) were used to measure utrophin expression. The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primer and probe set (GTGTTCCTACCCCAATGTG, AGGAGACAATGGTCCTCA, and FAM-AGGCATCTGAGGGCCCACTGAAGGGCAT-TAMRA) were used to monitor the internal control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA. For each RNA sample, triplicates were amplified in a one-step reaction, and cycle threshold values were obtained. Utrophin mRNA expression levels were normalized by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. For Western blot analysis, cells were lysed in sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 100 mm dithiothreitol). Muscle sections were lysed in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 3.8% SDS, 20% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol) by boiling at 95 °C for 5 min. Total protein extracts (25 μg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 5.5 or 12% polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking, membranes were probed with the primary antibodies anti-utrophin monoclonal antibody (Vector Laboratories) at a dilution of 1:300, anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) at dilution 1:100, VP16 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at dilution 1:100, and EGFP polyclonal antibody (Abcam) at a dilution of 1:2500. Immunocomplexes were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated species-specific secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad) followed by enhanced chemiluminescence. The blots were also stained with a monoclonal antibody against β-actin or vinculin (Sigma) as a loading control. Immunocytochemical Analysis—For in vitro analysis, C2C12 cells transfected with plasmid encoding ZFP and cultured in 8-well chamber slides were washed with PBS and then fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated for 30 min in PBS-4% bovine serum albumin with 0.5% Triton X-100, then probed with anti-FLAG-M2 monoclonal antibody-Cy3 conjugate at a dilution of 1:500 in PBS-4% bovine serum albumin or VP16 monoclonal antibody at a dilution of 1:100 overnight at 4 °C. The cells were rinsed in PBS overnight mounted in Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech) and visualized by fluorescent microscopy. For utrophin or EGFP immunostaining and histopathology analysis, TA muscles of mice of 20 or 80 days of age were embedded in mounting medium and snap-frozen in isopentane precooled with liquid N2. Transverse sections (6 μm thick) were obtained in a cryostat and then fixed on slides in 1% acetone. Immunostaining procedures were carried out to detect utrophin expression using a primary monoclonal antibody diluted 1:300 (Novocastra Laboratories) followed by reaction with a Cy3-conjugated affinity-purified goat anti-mouse IgG. Some sections were immunostained with both utrophin and EGFP antibody. Additional sections were also stained using antibody against β-dystroglycan (NCL-43DAG, Novocastra), and α-sarcoglycan (NCL-50DAG, Novocastra), as described previously (9.Tinsley J. Deconinck N.

Muscle sections were also counterstained with hematoxylin-eosin to allow determination of the number of central nuclei. The number of utrophin-positive myofibers on the entire muscle cross-section was counted as previously described (10.Gilbert R. Nalbantoglu J. Petrof B.J. Ebihara S. Guibinga G.H. Tinsley J.M.

Analysis of Muscle Physiological Function—These studies were performed as described previously in detail (33.Dudley R.W. Lu Y. Gilbert R. Matecki S. Nalbantoglu J. Petrof B.J. Karpati G. Hum. Gene Ther. 2004; 15: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). At 80 days postinjection, mice were anesthetized (130 mg/kg intramuscular ketamine and 20 mg/kg intramuscular xylazine) to achieve a loss of deep pain reflexes. Ad-ZFP and control Ad-GFP treated TA muscles were subjected to eccentric contractions. Each contraction involved supramaximal stimulation at 100 Hz for a total of 300 ms; the muscle was held at Lo during the initial 100 ms (isometric component) and then lengthened through a distance of 15% of Lo during the last 200 ms (eccentric component). Peak muscle length was maintained for an additional 100 ms after the cessation of electrical stimulation, followed by a return to Lo during the next 100 ms. A total of five such contractions were imposed on the muscle strip, each being separated by a 30-s recovery period. The resulting force deficit was defined as the percent decline in isometric force from the first to the last eccentric contraction. Because the damage and isometric force deficit associated with eccentric contractions are directly correlated with the peak mechanical stress placed on the muscle, the force deficit was normalized to peak muscle stress. Statistical Analysis—Differences between Ad-ZFP-injected and contralateral control Ad-GFP-injected muscles were determined using two-tailed t test. All values are means ± S.E. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. Design and Characterization of ZFPs Targeting the Proximal Utrophin A Promoter—It has been estimated that only 1% of genomic DNA is available for ZFP binding (34.Gross D.S. Garrard W.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 159-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar), because the vast majority of the binding sites will not be accessible due to nucleosome structure and chromatin condensation. We performed DNase I mapping of the proximal 5′-sequences of the utrophin A promoter, which revealed several DNase I-accessible sites, including one region within 400 bp of the transcription start site (Fig. 1, A and B), suggesting that these regions might provide good targets for ZFPs. We selected 9-bp target sequences within the DNase I-hypersensitive region to design three-finger artificial ZFP transcription factors. Four GC-rich sequences were chosen, and the appropriate ZFPs were designed based on the recognition modules described by Liu et al. (28.Liu Q. Xia Z. Zhong X. Case C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3850-3856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) (ZFP51, ZFP75, ZFP285, and ZFP396) (Fig. 1C). The modules were linked by the five residue linkers (TGEKP) that are conserved in many naturally occurring multifinger domain proteins. To test the transcriptional activity of the artificial ZFPs, these DNA-binding domains were linked to an activation domain provided by the VP16 protein of herpes simplex virus, tagged with the FLAG epitope for monitoring ZFP expression and a nuclear localization signal (NLS) to ensure nuclear trafficking (Fig. 2A). The control plasmid NLS consisted of the NLS linked to FLAG epitope. In subsequent experiments these ZFPs were compared with the previously described ZFP that activated utrophin transcription (labeled Jazz) (30.Corbi N. Libri V. Fanciulli M. Tinsley J.M. Davies K.E. Passananti C. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1076-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The ability of each ZFP to activate a reporter gene (luciferase) driven by the utrophin A promoter was assessed by transient transfection assays in four different cell lines (COS-1, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, human embryonic kidney 293 cells, and mouse C2C12 myoblasts) (Fig. 2, B and C). In each case, one of the designed ZFPs (ZFP51) performed better than all the other ones (Fig. 2C), including the published one (Jazz). Characterization of ZFP51 in Vitro—The biological activity of ZFP51 was further characterized by a series of in vitro experiments (Figs. 3 and 4). ZFP51 bound its recognition sequence with good specificity as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. 3A). Transfection of the C2C12 myoblast cell line with ZFP51 resulted in nuclear localization of ZFP51 as revealed by immunostaining of the pooled stable clones (Fig. 3B). Expression of ZFP51 led to a 4.4-fold increase in utrophin transcripts measured by quantitative real-time RT-PCR, and produced higher levels of utrophin protein accumulation (on average ∼3.8-fold increase as normalized to actin) (Fig. 3, C–E). To evaluate the potential of ZFP51 to transactivate the utrophin promoter in vivo, we generated a helper-dependent adenoviral vector (Ad-ZFP) in which the ZFP51 sequence was linked to an IRES-EGFP to allow monitoring of gene transfer in skeletal muscle (Fig. 4A). The biological activity of Ad-ZFP was first verified in C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes in culture (Fig. 4). Transduction with Ad-ZFP resulted in increased utrophin transcript levels (Fig. 4D) and utrophin protein accumulation in both myoblasts and myotubes (Fig. 4, C and E). Taken together, these data show that ZFP51 bound to its cognate sequence, localized to the nucleus after gene transfer, and that it transactivated the endogenous utrophin A promoter with robust transcriptional activity in cultured myoblasts and myotubes.FIGURE 4In vitro characterization of Ad-ZFP. A, schematic representation of the ZFP construct inserted into the helper-dependent adenovirus vector (Ad-ZFP). The promoter was changed to the stronger chicken β-actin/CMV enhancer hybrid (CB), and EGFP was expressed via an IRES sequence.

The contralateral control TA received Ad-EGFP. Visualization of EGFP post-administration of adenoviral vector provided an estimation of the extent of muscle transduction and showed equivalent vector distribution in both groups (data not shown). Injected muscle nuclei were immunopositive for VP16, indicating that the ZFP51 was properly localized to nuclei (Fig. 5A). In the TA, ZFP51 expression was associated with an increase of ∼3-fold in total utrophin protein levels as determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5, B and C). The 4- to 5-fold increase in utrophin transcripts was sustained throughout the course of the study (Fi"

Yet the reasons for this accumulation have not been adequately addressed. Because abnormalities in lipid metabolism promote atherosclerosis, we have asked whether disrupted cholesterol homeostasis alters HA accumulation in low density lipoprotein receptor-deficient cell cultures. Cultured aortic smooth muscle cells (ASMC) from Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits and skin fibroblasts from homozygous patients with familial hypercholesterolemia accumulated 2–4-fold more HA than corresponding cells from age- and sex-matched normolipidemic rabbits and individuals. This occurred in both cell-associated and secreted HA fractions and was independent of cell density or medium serum concentration. WHHL ASMC cultures synthesized twice the proportion of high molecular mass HA (>2 × 106 Da) as normal rabbit ASMC but showed a lower capacity to degrade exogenous [3H]HA. Most importantly, cholesterol depletion or blocking cholesterol synthesis markedly reduced HA accumulation in WHHL ASMC cultures, whereas cholesterol replenishment or stimulation of cholesterol synthesis restored elevated HA levels. We conclude the following: 1) maintaining normal HA levels in cell cultures requires normal cell cholesterol homeostasis; 2) HA degradation may contribute to but is not the predominant mechanism to increase high molecular mass HA accumulation in low density lipoprotein receptor-deficient WHHL ASMC cultures; and 3) elevated accumulation of HA depends on cellular or membrane cholesterol content and, potentially, intact cholesterol-rich microdomains.

Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Russell D.W. Science. 1986; 232: 1230-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and is similar to the most common class of mutations in the human disease of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) (29Hobbs H.H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Hum. Mutat. 1992; 1: 445-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). We report that cultured WHHL ASMC accumulate 2–4-fold more HA than ASMC from normolipidemic, sex- and age-matched New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits. In addition, the HA synthesized by WHHL ASMC is of a larger average hydrodynamic size. These changes appear to be due to a combination of increased synthesis and decreased degradation of HA in WHHL ASMC. Furthermore, we show that removing cholesterol from the WHHL ASMC returns HA accumulation by these cells to control levels, whereas replenishing cholesterol to these cells restores the elevated HA accumulation. These findings directly link cholesterol homeostasis in cells to the metabolism of HA, and may help to explain HA accumulation in atherosclerotic lesions. Materials—Skin fibroblasts from homozygous patients with FH and from matched normolipidemic individuals, and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with Earle's salts twice enriched with vitamins and amino acids were purchased from Coriell Cell Repositories (Camden, NJ). Coriell repository numbers for the normal cell lines were as follows: GM00408D, GM00500B, GM02674B, and GM03651E. Repository numbers for the FH cells were as follows: GM00283, GM00486C, GM00488C, GM00701C, GM02000G, and GM03040C. Rabbit SMC growth medium and rabbit SMC serum- and growth factor-free medium (SFM) were purchased from Cell Applications Inc. (San Diego, CA). Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was from Irvine Scientific (Santa Ana, CA). Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and trypsin/EDTA were from Invitrogen. Hepes-buffered saline, 0.025 mg/ml trypsin, 0.25 mm EDTA and trypsin-neutralizing solutions were from Cambrex (Walkersville, MD). d-[3H]Glucosamine HCl (24 Ci/mmol), [3H]acetic acid sodium (4.1 Ci/mmol), and Streptomyces hyaluronidase were purchased from MP Biomedicals (Aurora, OH). Streptomyces griseus Pronase was from Roche Diagnostics. Hyaluronic acid, from human umbilical cord, and all other reagents were products of Sigma. Rabbits—A WHHL rabbit colony was maintained by inbreeding as described previously (25Rosenfeld M.E. Tsukada T. Gown A.M. Ross R. Arteriosclerosis. 1987; 7: 9-23Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Breeding pairs of the WHHL rabbits were a generous gift of Drs. Daniel Steinberg and Joseph Witztum, University of California, San Diego. In addition, two 4-month-old WHHL rabbits were purchased from Covance Research Products Inc. (Denver, PA). The animals were 4–10-month-old males and females. Age- and sex-matched NZW rabbits were from Western Oregon Rabbit Co. (Philomath, OR). The rabbits were sacrificed by sodium pentobarbital injection (intravenous 0.5 ml/lb body weight), and the aortas were harvested. Animal care and procedures were conducted in accordance with applicable state and federal laws and under protocols approved by the University of Washington Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Cell Culture—Primary ASMC were isolated from WHHL and NZW rabbit aortas by the explant outgrowth method (30Ross R. J. Cell Biol. 1971; 50: 172-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar) and grown in rabbit SMC growth medium. All cell cultures were maintained at 37 °C, in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2, and used between the fourth and sixth passage. For cell proliferation experiments, 24 h after seeding in rabbit SMC growth medium, cells were growth-arrested in 0.1–0.5% FBS/SFM for 48 h. Fresh 10% FBS/SFM was then added to growth-arrested ASMC at day 0, and subsequently after 24 h (day 1) and then every 48 h (days 3, 5, 7, and 9) in 10% FBS/SFM. In cell density experiments, growth-arrested ASMC were incubated with fresh 0.1 or 10% FBS medium for 20 h. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MeβCD) is commonly used as a cell cholesterol acceptor to deplete cells (31Kojro E. Gimpl G. Lammich S. Marz W. Fahrenholz F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5815-5820Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 32Levitan I. Christian A.E. Tulenko T.N. Rothblat G.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and their plasma membrane (33Oliferenko S. Paiha K. Harder T. Gerke V. Schwarzler C. Schwarz H. Beug H. Gunthert U. Huber L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) of cholesterol. Over 50% cholesterol depletion can be achieved using MeβCD at concentrations as low as 5 mm during a 15-min incubation (33Oliferenko S. Paiha K. Harder T. Gerke V. Schwarzler C. Schwarz H. Beug H. Gunthert U. Huber L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Cholesterol-MeβCD complex is used as a cholesterol donor because it is a water-soluble form of cholesterol that is rapidly and efficiently taken up by cells, thus inducing cholesterol loading of cell membranes (32Levitan I. Christian A.E. Tulenko T.N. Rothblat G.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 34Christian A.E. Haynes M.P. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2264-2272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For cholesterol depletion and replenishing experiments, the indicated amounts of MeβCD were added to growth-arrested ASMC for 1 h in 0.5% FBS/SFM. Medium was removed, and the cells were gently washed with SFM. Fresh medium was then added with or without 0.25 mm cholesterol-MeβCD water-soluble complex in an 8:1 mol:mol ratio for 30 min in 0.5% FBS/SFM (32Levitan I. Christian A.E. Tulenko T.N. Rothblat G.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 34Christian A.E. Haynes M.P. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2264-2272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This complex is a cholesterol donor. The cholesterol complex was also added to control cells. To block cholesterol synthesis, 30 μm lovastatin was added for the last 24 h of the 48-h growth-arrest period. To counteract the lovastatin inhibition of cholesterol synthesis, 30 μm mevalonic acid was added simultaneously with the lovastatin or to controls in parallel dishes. Following the incubations with cyclodextrins or lovastatin (with or without mevalonic acid), the cells were washed gently one time with SFM and then incubated with 1% FBS/SFM for 2.5 h. Skin fibroblasts were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. For experiments, fibroblasts were seeded at the indicated cell density in 10% FBS/DMEM. After 24 h, they were growth-arrested in 0.1% FBS/DMEM for 48 h. Fresh medium containing 10% FBS was then added for 24 h. At the end of each incubation period, the medium was collected, incubated with 100–500 μg/ml Pronase at 37 °C for 2–18 h to release HA from its binding proteins, then heated at 100 °C for 20–30 min to inactivate the Pronase. Cell layers were washed with PBS, incubated in Tris-buffered Pronase (0.5 m Tris, pH 6.5) at 37 °C for 18 h, scraped into the buffer, and heat-inactivated. After centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 5 min, HA in the supernatant was quantified and normalized to cell number. Hyaluronan Assay—We used a modification (35Wilkinson T.S. Potter-Perigo S. Tsoi C. Altman L.C. Wight T.N. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 31: 92-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) of a previously described (36Underhill C.B. Nguyen H. Shizari M. Culty M. Dev. Biol. 1993; 155: 324-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) competitive ELISA in which the samples were first mixed with HA-binding protein isolated from bovine cartilage that has been biotinylated (bPG) and then added to human umbilical cord HA-coated microtiter plates, the final signal being inversely proportional to the level of HA added to the bPG. Characterization of Hyaluronan by Hydrodynamic Size—WHHL and NZW rabbit ASMC, seeded and then growth-arrested as described above, were labeled for 6 h with 50 μCi/ml [3H]glucosamine ([3H]GlcN) spiked at 0-, 6-, 12-, and 18-h time points in 0.5% or 10% FBS-containing medium. At the end of each 6-h pulse, the medium was collected, incubated with Pronase, and then heated as for the ELISAs. Heating HA to 100 °C did not change its size as determined by size exclusion chromatography on Sephacryl S-1000 (data not shown). HA and other GAGs were separated from unincorporated [3H]GlcN by chromatography on Sephadex G-50 columns. Macromolecular fractions containing identical 3H counts were incubated with or without 0.5 unit/ml Streptomyces hyaluronidase for 2–18 h at 37 °C, and macromolecular size was analyzed by size exclusion chromatography on a 1.2 × 58-cm Sephacryl S-1000 column, under nondissociative conditions. Fractions (0.5 ml) were eluted in 0.5 m sodium acetate, 0.025% CHAPS, pH 7.0, and the radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. HA radioactivity for each fraction was determined as hyaluronidase-sensitive GAG, which was calculated by subtracting hyaluronidase-resistant radioactivity from that of the undigested total. Blue dextran with ∼2 × 106 Da was used as a calibration standard. The percent of HA with molecular mass >2 × 106 Da was calculated and used to compare samples. Hyaluronan Degradation—To examine HA degradation, [3H]HA was prepared as described (37Underhill C.B. Toole B.P. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 82: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Briefly, NZW ASMC were incubated in 135-mm dishes with growth medium for 3 days and then growth-arrested in 0.5% FBS/SFM. After 48 h, 62.5 μCi/ml [3H]acetate (1.25 mCi/dish) was added with fresh 10% FBS/SFM for 3 days. The medium was collected and treated with Pronase and heated as above. After centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 5 min, the medium supernatant was extensively dialyzed against Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS and subsequently against distilled water at 4 °C. Solid NaCl was added to a final concentration of 0.03 m, and [3H]GAGs were precipitated with 1% cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) at room temperature. After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min, the pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of 0.1% CPC, 0.4 m NaCl to dissolve HA. Dissolved HA was then precipitated with 4 volumes of 100% ethanol at –20 °C for at least 18 h. The pellet was extensively washed with cold 100% ethanol, air-dried, and then resuspended in 1.5 ml of distilled water. Purity of the [3H]HA preparation was checked by CPC precipitation of hyaluronidase-digested or undigested aliquots using a slot-blot assay as described (38Agren U.M. Tammi R. Tammi M. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Ninety one percent of labeled GAGs were hyaluronidase-sensitive. To eliminate residual unincorporated [3H]acetate, the labeled HA preparation was desalted on a Sephadex G-50 size exclusion column. Eluted [3H]HA had a specific activity of 284 dpm/ng and contained at least 34% with a molecular mass >2 × 106 Da. To maximize the accessibility of the HA to its potential degradation pathways, the original [3H]HA preparation was sonicated twice for 30 s at 4 °C (Sonifier 450, output levels were set to the microtip limit, percent duty cycle was constant). This procedure reduced the proportion of HA with mass >2 × 106 Da to 2%. For degradation experiments, sonicated [3H]HA (2.58 × 106 dpm/ml) was added to growth-arrested ASMC in SFM. To determine background degradation, [3H]HA was incubated in SFM in cell-free culture dishes. After 18 h, medium aliquots were ultrafiltered through a 50,000-Da cutoff filter (Centricon, Millipore Inc., Billerica, MA), and the radioactivity in the filtrate was taken as degraded HA. Control background counts, from medium not exposed to cells, were subtracted from each sample medium filtrate. In addition, the labeled HA in the retentate was assayed for hydrodynamic size by chromatography on Sephacryl S-1000, as described above. Statistical Analysis—Data are reported as means of triplicate wells from one representative experiment. Error bars indicate S.D. or S.E. as described in the figure legends. Statistically significant differences between WHHL and NZW or within a cell strain were determined using an unpaired Student's t test, with p < 0.05 considered significant. To quantify the differences in HA accumulation between the WHHL and NZW cells as demonstrated in Figs. 2 and 3, a likelihood ratio test was performed using the R Project for Statistical Computing (Free Software Foundation). This procedure simultaneously evaluates both the slope and intercept estimates. If the results of this test are significant, then it can be concluded that the two groups are statistically different. To achieve a linear relationship between cell density and HA production per cell, the log transform of cell density was performed.FIGURE 3Elevated accumulation of hyaluronan by cultures of skin fibroblasts from patients with FH is independent of cell density. Growth-arrested skin fibroblasts from patients with FH (▴) and normolipidemic subjects (▵) were incubated for 24 h with fresh medium containing 10% FBS. The likelihood ratio test produced p < 0.001, and thus we conclude that the accumulation of HA on a per cell basis by FH and normolipidemic strains is different. This experiment was performed three times with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) WHHL ASMC Cultures Accumulate Elevated Levels of Hyaluronan and Grow More Slowly than Controls—In vivo accumulation of HA is a feature of atherosclerosis (16Toole B.P.

FEBS Lett. 1980; 118: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To explore the source of HA deposition in the atherosclerotic wall, we isolated ASMC from the aortic arch of WHHL rabbits, quantified HA accumulation in low passage cultures, and compared it with HA production by NZW ASMC. As shown in Fig. 1A, during 2-day incubations, HA accumulates in the culture medium of WHHL ASMC to a significantly greater extent than in that of NZW ASMC, both on a per cell basis and at all time points studied. The maximal increase in HA accumulation in the cultures of WHHL as compared with NZW ASMC was ∼2.5-fold, reached after 3 days of culture, and remained approximately the same over the 11 days tested. In 10% FBS-containing medium, the doubling time for WHHL ASMC was ∼5 days, but only ∼1 day for NZW ASMC (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, WHHL ASMC cultures had higher HA levels than those of NZW ASMC even in the absence of high serum (Fig. 1A, day 0), indicating that this difference is not dependent upon serum stimulation of the cells. These results showed for the first time that lacking a functional LDL receptor can be associated with enhanced HA accumulation in cell cultures over a wide range of incubation periods. Elevated Hyaluronan Accumulation by WHHL ASMC Cultures Is Independent of Cell Density and Serum Level—Because the amount of HA produced in cell culture is inversely proportional to the cell density (40Scott L.J. Merrilees M.J. Atherosclerosis. 1987; 63: 145-152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and WHHL cells grow more slowly than NZW cells (41Rosenfeld M.E. Ross R.

As shown in Fig. 2, in all cases, increasing the cell density significantly reduced the amount of HA secreted on a per cell basis in the medium, as expected (40Scott L.J. Merrilees M.J. Atherosclerosis. 1987; 63: 145-152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).

In this study we characterized the molecular determinants of myosin regulatory light chain (RLC) binding to two major subunits of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NR). Myosin RLC bound to NR subunits in a manner that could be distinguished from the interaction of RLC with the neck region of non-muscle myosin II-B (NMII-B) heavy chain; NR-RLC interactions did not require the addition of magnesium, were maintained in the absence of the fourth EF-hand domain of the light chain, and were sensitive to RLC phosphorylation. Equilibrium fluorescence spectroscopy experiments indicate that the affinity of myosin RLC for NR1 is high (30 nm) in the context of the isolated light chain. Binding was not favored in the context of a recombinant NMII-B subfragment one, indicating that if the RLC is already bound to NMII-B it is unlikely to form a bridge between two binding partners. We report that sequence similarity in the “GXXXR” portion of the incomplete IQ2 motif found in NMII heavy chain isoforms likely contributes to recognition of NR2A as a non-myosin target of the RLC. Using site-directed mutagenesis to disrupt NR2A-RLC binding in intact cells, we find that RLC interactions facilitate trafficking of NR1/NR2A receptors to the cell membrane. We suggest that myosin RLC can adopt target-dependent conformations and that a role for this light chain in protein trafficking may be independent of the myosin II complex.

Regulation and maintenance of glutamate receptor numbers at postsynaptic sites are critical for excitatory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. Mechanisms that underlie targeting of glutamate receptors to synapses almost certainly involve a regulated series of protein-protein interactions between the receptor and various binding partners. In trying to understand how these events are temporally and spatially coordinated, the intracellular carboxyl termini of glutamate receptor subunits have attracted much attention as they have been shown to bind directly and indirectly to a number of cytoskeletal and motor proteins, scaffolding proteins, enzymes, and other signaling molecules (1Wenthold R.J. Prybylowski K. Standley S. Sans N. Petralia R.S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2003; 43: 335-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar).

Myosin RLC is an accessory light chain of the actin-based motor myosin II, which is a hexameric complex composed of two heavy chains, two RLCs, and two essential light chains (ELC) (3Conti M.A. Adelstein R.S. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Myosin II light chains are, like calmodulin, members of the EF-hand family of calcium-binding proteins (4Kawasaki H. Nakayama S. Kretsinger R.H. Biometals. 1998; 11: 277-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). However, the interaction of myosin RLC with NMDA receptor (NR) subunits could be distinguished from the strictly Ca2+-dependent interaction of calmodulin with the NR1 subunit (2Amparan D. Avram D. Thomas C.G. Lindahl M.G. Yang J. Bajaj G. Ishmael J.E. J. Neurochem. 2005; 92: 349-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).The light chains of myosin II are integral components of the myosin II complex that bind to tandem IQ motifs located in the neck region of myosin II heavy chain. An IQ motif is approximately 25 amino acids long containing the classic consensus sequence IQXXXRGXXXR (5Bahler M. Rhoads A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Variations in this consensus IQ sequence can, however, explain both the light chain binding preference of heavy chains and also the particular conformation that a light chain can adopt upon binding (6Houdusse A. Cohen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10644-10647Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 7Terrak M. Otterbein L.R. Wu G. Palecanda L.A. Lu R.C. Dominguez R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 362-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For example, RLCs of myosin II are predicted to adopt an extended conformation when bound to the neck region of myosin II heavy chain (9Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Base K. Smith R.

Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 21-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). However, crystallographic evidence indicates the ELC of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Mlc1p, can exist in the following two distinct conformations: compact and extended depending on the specific IQ sequence of the myosin heavy chain (8Terrak M. Wu G. Stafford W.F. Lu R.C. Dominguez R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 362-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). When bound in an extended conformation, it is suggested that Mlc1p has a free amino terminus that may interact with another binding partner to form a ternary complex with myosin II heavy chain (8Terrak M. Wu G. Stafford W.F. Lu R.C. Dominguez R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 362-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This finding has attracted much attention because ELC in organisms such as S. cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Drosophila melanogaster have several binding partners (11Franke J.D.

In addition to NMDA-type glutamate receptor subunits (2Amparan D. Avram D. Thomas C.G. Lindahl M.G. Yang J. Bajaj G. Ishmael J.E. J. Neurochem. 2005; 92: 349-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), myosin RLC binds via its amino terminus to the smooth muscle protein calponin (19Szymanski P.T. Goyal R.K.

The RLC also binds directly to bile salt export protein (BSEP) and at least two other members of the family of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of drug efflux transporters (20Chan W. Calderon G.

As it is widely assumed that RLC functions only in the context of a myosin II complex, the existence of these additional binding partners raises the possibility that the RLC could form a ternary complex with myosin II heavy chain and a third non-myosin binding partner (20Chan W.

The goals of this study were as follows: 1) to determine whether brain myosin RLC can bind to two target sequences simultaneously, and 2) to determine the physiological relevance of RLC-NMDA receptor interactions. We report that RLC binds NR1 and NR2 subunits in a manner that can be clearly distinguished from the interaction of RLC with the neck region of non-muscle myosin II heavy chain. Equilibrium fluorescence spectroscopy experiments revealed that the affinity of myosin RLC for NR1 is high in the context of the isolated light chain, but is not favored if the RLC was already in a complex with myosin II heavy chain. By focusing on the membrane-proximal region of the NR2A subunit, which is not a target of calmodulin, we report that sequence homology in the “GXXXR” portion of the incomplete IQ2 motif found in all three non-muscle myosin II heavy chain isoforms likely contributes to the recognition of NR2 subunits as a non-myosin target of the RLC. Using site-directed mutagenesis to disrupt myosin RLC binding in intact cells, we find that RLC interactions likely occur within the Golgi secretory trafficking pathway. Disruption of RLC binding to NR2A resulted in a delay in delivery of functional NR1/ΔNR2A receptors to the cell membrane. Our data suggest a role for myosin RLC that is independent of the typical interaction of the light chain with myosin II heavy chain.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids and Constructs—Plasmids containing rat NMDAR2A, NMDAR2B, and NMDAR1-1a cDNAs have been described previously (2Amparan D.

The membrane-proximal region of the carboxyl terminus of the NMDAR2B subunit (amino acid residues 839-873) was amplified by PCR and inserted into pGEX-6P-3. Myosin regulatory light chain-(1-101), RLC-(102-172), RLC-(1-129), RLC-(61-129), and RLC-(61-172) were amplified by PCR from the mouse pACT2/5-6-1 clone (2Amparan D. Avram D. Thomas C.G. Lindahl M.G.

The construction of full-length myosin RLC-(1-172), NMDAR1-(834-938), NR1-(834-863) (encoding C0), NR1-(864-938) (encoding C1C2), and NR1-(834-855) (known as Δ856) has been described previously (2Amparan D. Avram D. Thomas C.G. Lindahl M.G. Yang J. Bajaj G. Ishmael J.E. J. Neurochem. 2005; 92: 349-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For expression in mammalian cells, NR2A-(1-1028) and RLC-(1-172) were amplified by PCR and inserted into EcoRI and XhoI sites of pECFP-N1 and pEYFP-N1 (Clontech), respectively. NR1 was excised from the plasmid pTL1/NR1-1a (27Ishmael J.E. Franklin P.H. Murray T.F. Leid M. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1500-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and inserted into HindIII and XbaI restriction sites of pCDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen). Full-length RLC-(1-172) was also inserted into pCDNA 3.1. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using standard techniques. All sequences were confirmed by the Center for Genome Research and Biocomputing Core Facility (Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR).Antibodies—The anti-myosin RLC antibody (αMRLC/3) was raised in rabbits against a unique peptide and has been described previously (2Amparan D. Avram D. Thomas C.G. Lindahl M.G. Yang J. Bajaj G. Ishmael J.E. J. Neurochem. 2005; 92: 349-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Antiserum to the phosphorylated form of serine 19 of myosin RLC was also raised in rabbits against a unique phosphopeptide (CRPQRATS-PO3-NVFAM) and affinity-purified (αMRLC/P) (Bethyl Laboratories Inc., Montgomery, TX). The anti-GST antibody was a gift of Dr. Mark Leid (Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR). Other primary antibodies used in this study are commercially available and included the following: anti-calmodulin (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY), anti-PSD95 (Affinity Bioreagents Inc., Golden, CO), anti-myosin light chain (MLC) (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), anti-T7 (Novagen, Madison, WI), anti-adaptin α (Transduction Laboratories, Newington, NH), anti-Golgi 58K protein (clone 58K-9) and anti-FLAG (both from Sigma), and anti-non-muscle myosin heavy chain isoforms IIA and IIB (both from Covance Research Products, Denver, PA).Protein Purification—Recombinant myosin RLC was expressed in Escherichia coli (BL21-Gold(DE3)pLysS; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and purified by nickel-chelate chromatography. The polyhistidine tag was removed by thrombin cleavage (Thrombin Clean Cleave kit; Sigma) followed by dialysis against a buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.7) and 500 mm NaCl. GST fusion proteins were bacterially expressed, as above, and purified by column chromatography using immobilized glutathione (Pierce). The bound GST fusion protein was eluted using a buffer containing 10 mm reduced glutathione and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) followed by dialysis against the buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Native smooth muscle myosin light chain (MLC-2) was isolated and purified from washed turkey gizzard myofibrils as described previously (28Malencik D.A. Anderson S.R. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3480-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 29Malencik D.A. Anderson S.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1941-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and was a kind gift from Drs. Sonia Anderson and Dean Malencik (Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR). Smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) was a kind gift from Dr. Christine Cremo (University of Reno, NV). Bovine calmodulin was purchased from Calbiochem. Purified FLAG-tagged human non-muscle IIB subfragment 1 (NMIIB S1), a truncated myosin heavy chain fragment co-expressed with regulatory and essential myosin light chains in baculovirus (30Wang F. Kovacs M. Hu A. Limouze J. Harvey E.V. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27439-27448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), was a kind gift of Dr. James Sellers (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda).Phosphorylation of Isolated RLC and NMIIB S1—Regulatory light chain RLC, either in isolated form or in the context of NMIIB S1, was phosphorylated in the presence of smooth muscle MLCK (31Cremo C.R. Wang F. Facemyer K. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41465-41472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Isolated RLC or NMIIB S1 was added to a buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 10 μg/ml MLCK, 10 μg/ml calmodulin, 5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm ATP and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Phosphorylation of each sample was verified by PAGE in the presence of urea; control samples were nonphosphorylated or subjected to mock phosphorylation reactions (lacking MLCK). Samples were heated at 80 °C for 2 min in urea sample buffer (8 m urea, 33 mm Tris-glycine (pH 8.6), 0,17 mm EDTA, and bromphenol blue), before loading on NOVEX Tris-glycine pre-cast gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were visualized directly by Coomassie Blue stain (Bio-Rad) or were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and detected by immunoblot with either a T7 tag antibody (RLC), αMRLC/P (phosphorylated RLC), anti-FLAG antibody (heavy chain), or anti-MLC1 (ELC) and appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Calbiochem). Immune complexes were revealed using a chemiluminescence assay (Roche Diagnostics).Fluorescence Spectroscopy—A peptide corresponding to the first 30 amino acids of the carboxyl tail of the NMDAR1 subunit (residues 834-863) was labeled with fluorescein on the amino terminus (FITC-EIAYKRHKDARRKQMQLAFAAVNVWRKNLQ-COOH) and purified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (United Biochemical Research, Inc., Seattle, WA). Fluorescence measurements were taken in 2.0 ml of buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.7), 500 mm NaCl and a final peptide concentration of 300 nm. Purified RLC was added from a concentrated stock solution and allowed to equilibrate in the dark for 5 min prior to fluorescence determinations. All additions of purified RLC were made sequentially from a single stock solution, and the fluorescence emission was corrected for dilution. All experiments were performed on an SLM 8000C spectrofluorometer (SLM Instruments, Urbana, IL). Data were fit to Equation 1 by weighted nonlinear least squares using the computer program Scientist® (Micromath Inc., St. Louis, MO) when the weighting factors were equal to the square of the reciprocal of the standard deviation for each data point,where F is the measured fluorescence enhancement; a is the fluorescence observed in the absence of RLC; R0 is the total concentration of fluorescently labeled peptide; L0 is the total concentration of RLC; K is the dissociation constant for the peptide-protein complex; b is the relative fluorescence enhancement of the fluorescent peptide-protein complex; and c is a parameter used to fit the background linear fluorescence increase observed as the RLC concentration increased.Fluorescence Microscopy, Culture, and Transfection of Mammalian Cells—Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK) 293 cells were maintained in 90% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech, Herndon, VA), 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in humidified air. The day before transfection, cells (2 × 104) were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips in medium supplemented with kynurenic acid (3 mm, Sigma) and dl-AP5 (1 mm Tocris, Ellisville, MO) (32Krupp J.J. Vissel B. Thomas C.G. Heinemann S.F. Westbrook G.L. Neuropharmacology. 2002; 42: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) and maintained for up to 72 h. Cells were then washed twice with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 3% formaldehyde (20 min), and mounted on slides with a ProLong® antifade kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Confocal images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) with a Zeiss 63× oil immersion objective. Fluorescence signals were collected using laser excitation at 514 nm for YFP and 458 nm for CFP. LP 530 and BP 470-500 filters were used for detection of YFP and CFP emission as described previously (33Zhang Y. Vogel W.K. McCullar J.S. Greenwood J.A. Filtz T.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 860-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). For detection of endogenous K58 Golgi protein and heavy chain isoforms, sections were incubated with appropriate primary antibodies after fixation followed by secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa 546 or Cy5, respectively.Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Pulldown Assays—Pulldown assays from brain homogenates (extracted in a buffer containing 250 mm NaCl and 10 mm ATP) were conducted as described previously (2Amparan D. Avram D. Thomas C.G. Lindahl M.G. Yang J. Bajaj G. Ishmael J.E. J. Neurochem. 2005; 92: 349-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Pulldown assays with recombinant myosin RLC and the carboxyl regions of NR1 or the NMII-B heavy chain neck region have also been described (2Amparan D. Avram D. Thomas C.G. Lindahl M.G. Yang J. Bajaj G. Ishmael J.E. J. Neurochem. 2005; 92: 349-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) but included the following modifications: 1) assays were initiated with the addition of recombinant RLC (100 nm), and 2) the incubation time was extended to 2 h. For studies to determine the interaction of full-length and mutant RLC (phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated) with the NR2A subunit, GST fusion proteins or GST alone was incubated in binding buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and 10% glycerol) and allowed to proceed for 2 h at 4 °C as described above. Unbound protein was removed by three sequential washes with binding buffer, and bound proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and processed for immunoblot analysis as described above. Calcium-dependent calmodulin binding to NMDA receptor subunits was assessed in the same way in the absence (binding buffer) or presence of calcium (binding buffer lacking EDTA but including 2 mm calcium chloride). The magnesium dependence of RLC binding was also assessed in the absence and presence of magnesium (lacking EDTA but including 1 mm magnesium chloride). In all calcium and magnesium studies, the appropriate binding buffer was used in all subsequent washes to remove unbound protein. In light of the apparent magnesium dependence of RLC binding to the neck region of NMII-B heavy chain, subsequent studies were carried out in the presence of magnesium (1 mm).Immunopreciptation Studies—NR2A-(838-874) fused to GST (150 nm) was purified and mixed with either purified NMIIB S1, NMIIB S1-P, or bacterially expressed myosin RLC (MRLC) in 10 mm HEPES containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol (pH 7.5) at 4 °C. Bovine serum albumin was added to a final concentration of 0.5%, and proteins were allowed to incubate with gentle rotation for 2 h at 4 °C. Anti-GST (12 μg) was then added to the samples and allowed to incubate with gentle rotation for a further 2 h at 4 °C. Precipitation of immune complexes was facilitated by the addition of a 25-μl aliquot of 50% protein G-Sepharose slurry (Amersham Biosciences) to each tube, incubated with gentle rotation for 2 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 1 min, followed by three consecutive resuspension/wash and centrifugation steps. Precipitated proteins were eluted from the beads by heating for 2 min in 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and processed for immunoblot analysis as described above.RESULTSSmooth Muscle and Brain Isoforms of Myosin RLC Bind to the NR1 Subunit with High Affinity—Although there is considerable sequence homology at the amino acid level among RLCs in non-muscle and smooth muscle tissues, subtle differences have been noted between brain isoforms (34Taubman M.B. Grant J.W. Nadal-Ginard B. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1505-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 35Feinstein D.L. Durand M. Milner R.J. Brain Res. Mol.

Narula S.K. Leibowitz P.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). To determine whether these small differences in amino acid sequence were sufficient to influence binding of myosin RLC to the NMDA receptor, we determined binding affinities for the mouse brain isoform, previously identified as an NMDA receptor-interacting protein (GenBank™ accession number AK013776), and the major smooth muscle isoform from chicken gizzard (GenBank™ accession number P02612) using equilibrium fluorescence spectroscopy. These initial binding studies were conducted at supra-physiological salt concentrations (0.5 m NaCl), to distinguish RLC-NR1 interactions from those, such as calponin (19Szymanski P.T. Goyal R.K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3778-3784Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), that may be strictly limited to low ionic strength conditions. Functional NMDA receptors differ with respect to their complement of NR2 subunits, but the first 30-amino acid region of the carboxyl terminus of NR1 (referred to as C0; Fig. 1B) is conserved in all splice variants of NR1 and thus present in all functional NMDA receptors. As we have previously determined that NR1-C0 is necessary and sufficient for myosin RLC binding (2Amparan D. Avram D. Thomas C.G. Lindahl M.G. Yang J. Bajaj G. Ishmael J.E. J. Neurochem. 2005; 92: 349-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), we used a fluorescein-labeled peptide ("

We used a yeast two-hybrid screen, with myocardin as bait in a search for factors that regulate myocardin transcriptional activity. From this screen, thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) was identified as a myocardin-associated protein. TDG was originally identified as an enzyme involved in base excision repair of T:G mismatches caused by spontaneous deamination of methylated cytosines. However, TDG has also been shown to act as a transcriptional co-activator or co-repressor. The interaction between TDG and myocardin was confirmed in vitro by glutathione S-transferase pull down and in vivo by co-immunoprecipitation assays. We found that TDG abrogates myocardin induced expression of smooth muscle-specific genes and represses the trans-activation of the promoters of myocardin of these genes. Overexpression of TDG in SMCs down-regulated smooth muscle marker expression. Conversely, depletion of endogenous TDG in SMCs increased smooth muscle-specific myosin heavy chain (SM MHC) and Telokin gene expression. Glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays demonstrated that TDG binds to a region of myocardin that includes the SRF binding domain. Furthermore, TDG was found to compete with SRF for binding to myocardin in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that TDG can inhibit expression of smooth muscle-specific genes, at least in part, through disrupting SRF/myocardin interactions. Finally, we demonstrated that the glycosylase activity of TDG is not required for its inhibitory effects on myocardin function. This study reveals a previously unsuspected role for the repair enzyme TDG as a repressor of smooth muscle differentiation via competing with SRF for binding to myocardin.

Fully differentiated or mature SMCs proliferate at an extremely low rate and are almost completely geared for contraction. Differentiated SMCs are characterized by the presence of a unique repertoire of contractile and regulatory proteins such as smooth muscle α- and γ-actin, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SM MHC), h-caldesmon, calponin, SM22α, and telokin. The expression of these proteins is markedly attenuated during the de-differentiation and proliferation of smooth muscle that occurs under many pathological conditions (1Miano J.M. J. Mol.

The mechanisms that result in down-regulation of contractile proteins during phenotypic modulation of smooth muscle are poorly understood.

Although SRF expression is greatest in muscle tissues, it is expressed in all tissues (3Belaguli N.S. Schildmeyer L.A. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18222-18231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It is a multifunctional protein that not only binds a highly conserved cis-regulatory element CC(A/T)6GG, termed a CArG box, but also provides a docking surface within the conserved MADS domain for interaction with a wide variety of accessory cofactors. The physical association of SRF with various cell-restricted and/or signal-dependent accessory factors confers co-activator or co-repressor activity via ternary complex formation. Of the SRF-associated proteins identified, myocardin is perhaps the most potent for stimulating expression of smooth muscle-specific genes (4Pipes G.C. Creemers E.E. Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1545-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Although several proteins have been identified that can modify myocardin function (5Liu Y. Sinha S. McDonald O.G. Shang Y.

We thus performed a yeast two-hybrid screen, using myocardin as bait, to identify proteins that may regulate myocardin function. This screen identified a DNA mismatch repair enzyme, TDG (thymine DNA glycosylase) as a myocardin-binding protein. TDG is a member of mismatch-directed uracil-DNA glycosylases (8Gallinari P. Jiricny J. Nature. 1996; 383: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 9Cortazar D. Kunz C. Saito Y. Steinacher R. Schar P. DNA Repair. 2007; 6: 489-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). It is widely expressed in multiple organs including SMC-rich tissues (10Um S. Harbers M. Benecke A. Pierrat B. Losson R. Chambon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20728-20736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 11Schmutte C. Baffa R. Veronese L.M. Murakumo Y. Fishel R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3010-3015PubMed Google Scholar). TDG has multiple functions that link DNA repair, the control of epigenetic DNA modification, and the regulation of gene expression (8Gallinari P. Jiricny J. Nature. 1996; 383: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 9Cortazar D. Kunz C. Saito Y. Steinacher R. Schar P. DNA Repair. 2007; 6: 489-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In vitro assays demonstrated it is able to hydrolyze thymine and uracil from G:T and G:U mismatch pairs, implying a specific biological role in base excision repair of deamination-induced Cys → Thr mutations. Further studies have shown TDG also plays a role in the active removal of 5-meC from methylated CpG dinucleotides in DNA, thus implicating TDG in regulating epigenetic DNA modifications (12Jost J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4684-4688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, TDG has been shown to act as either a co-activator or co-repressor of a variety of genes. For example, the physical association of retinoid or estrogen receptors (ER) with TDG results in transcriptional activation of reporter genes; and, at least for the ER, such transcriptional co-activation does not require a functional glycosylase catalytic domain (10Um S. Harbers M. Benecke A. Pierrat B. Losson R. Chambon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20728-20736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 13Chen D. Lucey M.J. Phoenix F.

On another hand, TDG was found to repress thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1)-activated transcription in thyroid and non-thyroid cells in transient co-transfection experiments (14Missero C. Pirro M.T. Simeone S. Pischetola M. Di Lauro R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33569-33575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the current study we show that the physical interaction between TDG and myocardin disrupts myocardin-SRF complexes and thereby attenuates smooth muscle differentation. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—A fragment of the mouse myocardin cDNA encoding the N-terminal 585 amino acids was cloned into the bait vector pAS2-1 (Promega) by a standard PCR-based cloning strategy. A pretransformed mouse embryonic 17-day library was purchased from Promega. Screening of the library was performed essentially following instructions for the Matchmaker system (Promega) and has been previously described (15Herring B.P. Kriegel A.M. Hoggatt A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14482-14489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was recovered from positive yeast clones and sequenced to identify the inserts. Three clones corresponding to the full-length open reading frame of TDG (NM011561) were isolated and characterized further. Mammalian Expression and Reporter Gene Assays—The coding region of mouse TDG cDNA (encoding amino acids 1–397) was amplified from a yeast plasmid clone by PCR and ligated to pcDNA3.1His (Invitrogen), resulting in the expression of a fusion protein with N-terminal His6 and Omni epitope tags. For generation of TDG adenovirus, the mouse TDG coding sequence was cloned into a modified pShuttle vector (Clontech) encoding an N-terminal HA tag. The mouse Myocardin pcDNA3.1-myc/his vector (cardiac-enriched isoform that is also expressed in smooth muscle) was kindly provided by Dr. Eric N. Olson (Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). The smooth muscle Myocardin isoform was generated by PCR and cloned into Omni-tagged pShuttle vector (BD Biosciences) and then the expression cassette was transferred into Adenoviral DNA to produce adenovirus as described previously (16Creemers E.E. Sutherland L.B. Oh J. Barbosa A.C. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 83-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). An expression plasmid encoding a myocardin leucine zipper mutant was described previously (17Zhou J. Herring B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10861-10869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The mouse MRTF-B expression plasmid was provided by Dr. Michael Parmacek (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). The mouse mammalian expression plasmid for MRTF-A was described in our previous report (18Zhang M. Fang H. Zhou J. Herring B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25708-25716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). All promoter reporter genes were constructed by cloning fragments of promoters into the pGL2Bor pGL3B luciferase vectors (Promega, Madison, WI). The mouse Telokin promoter-luciferase reporter gene used includes nucleotides –190 to +181 (T370) of the mouse Telokin gene and rabbit telokin gene promoter T400 including nucleotides –256 to +147 was described previously (19Herring B.P.

The SM22α-luciferase reporter gene includes nucleotides –475 to +61 of mouse SM22α (21Kim S. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Li L. Miano J.M. Mercer B. Olson E.N. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The SM α-actin promoter fragment extends from nucleotide –2,555 to +2,813 (23Mack C.P. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 852-861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the SM MHC promoter from –4,200 to +11,600 (24Madsen C.S. Regan C.P. Hungerford J.E. White S.L. Manabe I. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 908-917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these latter plasmids were generously provided by Dr. Gary Owens. Plasmids were sequenced to verify the integrity of the insert. Transfection was carried out with FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Roche) as previously described (25Zhou J. Hoggatt A.M. Herring B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15929-15937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The level of promoter activity was evaluated by measurement of the firefly luciferase activity relative to the internal control TK-Renilla luciferase activity using the Dual Luciferase Assay System essentially as described by the manufacturer (Promega). A minimum of six independent transfections were performed and all assays were replicated at least twice. Results are reported as the mean ± S.E. Immunocytochemistry—Rat aortic A10 cells were grown on coverslips at 3 × 105 cells per 60-mm dish overnight. Cells were transfected with the Omni-TDG expression plasmid for 24 h and then fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with polyclonal anti-Omni antibody (1:500, Invitrogen), followed by Texas Red-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:400) secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). Cells were counterstained with Hoechst (1:5000) to visualize nuclei. GST Pull-down Assays—Fragments of mouse Myocardin and TDG cDNAs were cloned into pGEX-4T vectors (Stratagene) to generate GST fusion proteins or cloned into pET28 vectors (Novagen) to generate T7 fusion proteins. These fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli BL21-star (Stratagene) cells. After 1 h of induction with 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside, cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in PBS, 1! Triton containing protease inhibitors and then lysed by sonication. GST fusion protein lysates were clarified by centrifugation and incubated for 1 h with a 50! suspension of glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) in PBS. Washed fusion proteins bound to the beads were resuspended and incubated for 2 h with 500 μl of T7 fusion proteins in a total volume of 1 ml of binding buffer (PBS containing 1! Triton X-100, 1 mg/ml BSA + protease inhibitors). Beads were washed 3 times in 1 ml of washing buffer (PBS containing 1! Triton X-100) and then bound proteins eluted by heating at 95 °C for 5 min in SDS sample buffer. The eluted proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and proteins detected by Western blotting. Co-immunoprecipitation—For detecting protein-protein interactions in vivo, COS cells were transduced with adenovirus encoding HA-tagged TDG and myc-tagged or Omni-tagged myocardin as indicated in figures. 24 h after transduction, nuclear protein was harvested from the COS cells. Co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed using a nuclear complex co-immunoprecipitation kit as described by the manufacturer (Active Motif). 250 μg of nuclear protein extracts were incubated with 3 μg of anti-myc antibody (Invitrogen), anti-HA antibody (Covance), or appropriate IgG controls in 500 μl of low salt immunoprecipitation buffer (Active Motif) overnight at 4 °C. 60 μl of EZview protein A beads (Sigma) were added to the mixture for an additional 1 h with rocking and then immobilized complexes were washed 6 times with the low salt immunoprecipitation buffer. The immunoprecipitated protein was mixed with 45 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. Adenovirus Construction and Cell Infection—Adenovirus constructs were made in the Adeno-X vectors essentially followed the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences) as previously described (25Zhou J. Hoggatt A.M. Herring B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15929-15937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For adenoviral transduction, mouse colon primary SMCs were isolated from 4–6-week-old mice as previously described (18Zhang M. Fang H. Zhou J. Herring B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25708-25716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and plated in 12-well plates at a density of 7 × 104 cells/well. The next day, cells were transduced with adenovirus encoding HA-tagged YFP-NLS (nuclear localized yellow fluorescent protein) or HA-tagged TDG in 10! growth media for 4 h at 37 °C. The adenovirus was then aspirated and replaced with 10! growth media. These conditions resulted in close to 100! infection of cells. 48 h following transduction total RNA were extracted from the transduced cells with TRIzol (Invitrogen). Western Blotting—Western blot analysis was carried out essentially as described previously (17Zhou J. Herring B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10861-10869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 25Zhou J. Hoggatt A.M. Herring B.P. J. Biol.

Biol. 2005; 25: 9874-9885Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). 30 μg of protein were fractionated on 5 or 15! SDS-polyacrylamide gels, electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose or PVDF membrane, and transfer verified by Ponceau S staining. The membranes were then probed with a series of antibodies. Antibodies used in this study were against: HA tag (Covance, 1:3,000), myc (Invitrogen, 1:5000), omni (Invitrogen, 1:3000), SRF (Santa Cruz, G20X, 1:10000), T7 (1:10000, Novagen), and vinculin (Santa Cruz, 1:5,000). Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) Analysis—Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). For qRT-PCR, 1 μg of RNA was utilized as a template for reverse transcription (RT) with random hexamer primers using SuperScript first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen). PCR was performed with 200 ng of cDNA and SYBR Green PCR master mix (ABgene) with respective gene-specific primers as previously reported (18Zhang M. Fang H. Zhou J. Herring B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25708-25716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Primers sets for mouse TDG were designed as sense 5′-GTC TGT TCA TGT CGG GGC TGA GTG AG-3′ and antisense 5′-CTG CAG TTT CTG CAC CAG GAT GCG C-3′ and yielded a 182-bp product. Rat telokin PCR product was amplified using 5′-GAC ACC GCC TCA GTC CAA CCT CCG-3′ and 5′-GGC TTT TCC TCA GCA ACA GCC TCG-3′; rat SM MHC product was amplified using 5′-GCA GCT TCT ACA GGC AAA CCC AAT CC-3′ and 5′-GCA CCC ACA ATG TAA CCA GTG ACA TCA-3′; rat TDG PCR product was amplified using 5′-CCC TGG GCC CGG AAA-3′ and 5′-TCG CTC AAC CCA GAC ATG AA-3′; rat Aortic carboxypeptidase-like protein product was amplified with 5′-CGG CAC CAC AGC TAC AAG GA-3′ and 5′-TCC CCG GGG TTG TCT GAG AT-3′; rat smoothelin B was amplified with 5′-GGC TAC ACT CTC AAC AGC GAG AA-3′ and 5′-ACA TCG TTC ATG GAC TCC AGT CTC-3′. Mouse and rat acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein PO (RPLPO) PCR product was amplified using 5′-GGA CCC GAG AAG ACC TCC TT-3′ and 5′-TGC TGC CGT TGT CAA ACA CC-3′ as internal control; quantification of the reaction product was carried out using the ABI9700 real time detection system. All samples were amplified in duplicate and every experiment was repeated independently 2 times. Relative gene expression was converted using the 2–ΔΔCt method against the internal control RPLPO housekeeping gene. siRNA—Control siRNA or siRNA against TDG was designed and purchased from Dharmacon. The siRNA sequence for targeting endogenous mouse and rat TDG was 5′-GCAAGGATCTGTCTAGTAA-3′. For determining the siRNA depletion efficacy expression plasmids encoding mouse TDG were transfected into 10T1/2 cells with FuGENE6 (Roche) for 12 h. Subsequently cells were transfected either with control siRNA or TDG siRNA duplex using Lipofectamine transfection reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. 24 h later, protein was harvested and subjected to Western blotting. For testing the effects of smooth muscle gene expression by depletion of endogenous TDG, control siRNA or TDG siRNA was transfected into A10 cells for 24 or 48 h and total RNA was harvested for qRT-PCR as described above. Quantitative Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—10T1/2 cells were cultured in 10! growth media and infected with adenovirus encoding omni-tagged myocardin, HA-tagged YFP or TDG, for 36 h. After a PBS wash, cells were fixed with 10 ml of PBS supplemented with 270 μl of 37! formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were harvested for chromatin immunoprecipitation essentially as described by the manufacturer (Upstate) with minor modifications. Cross-linked chromatin was immunoprecipitated with 6 μg of anti-omni antibody (Santa Cruz) and bound to single-stranded DNA/protein A-agarose beads (Sigma). The precipitated DNA was then purified and amplified by real time PCR for quantification of the target sequences using SYBR Green PCR master mix (ABgene) with SM22α and SM MHC gene-specific primers as described previously (18Zhang M. Fang H. Zhou J. Herring B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25708-25716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Human Coronary SMC Culture—Primary human coronary artery SMCs (passages 3–8; Cell Applications, Inc.) were plated in SMC growth medium (MCDB131 containing 5! fetal calf serum, 2 ng/ml human basic fibroblast growth factor, 5 mg/ml human insulin, and 0.5 ng/ml human epidermal growth factor) for 24 h. Cells were incubated in serum-free MCDB131 medium to induce smooth muscle genes for 0, 2, and 8 days. Where indicated, growth medium was added back to serum-depleted cells to induce proliferation for 8 or 24 h. Total RNA was extracted at the time points indicated using TRIzol reagent. qRT-PCR was performed using primers to TDG and SM-specific genes as described above. Sequences for human TDG primers were designed as sense: 5′-TCA GTG AGG TCC AGC TGA ACC ATA TG-3′ and antisense: 5′-TTC CAT TAA ACA CTG CTA TTC GTG GCT G-3′. TDG Localizes to the Nucleus of Smooth Muscle Cells and Interacts with Myocardin in Vitro and in Vivo—Myocardin is a potent transcription factor important for smooth muscle development (28Li S. Wang D.Z. Wang Z. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9366-9370Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate myocardin activity are not fully explored. We hypothesize that myocardin function is likely to be regulated through its association with other proteins. To identify myocardin regulatory proteins, the N-terminal half of myocardin (amino acids 1–585) was used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a 17-day embryonic mouse cDNA library. From this screen three independent clones were identified that encoded TDG (GenBank™ accession number NM011561). We verified that TDG protein predominantly localizes to the nuclei of smooth muscle cells (Fig. 1A) and confirmed the physical interaction between myocardin and TDG in vitro and in vivo. Consistent with the yeast two-hybrid screen, GST pull down assays demonstrated that the N-terminal half of myocardin (amino acids 1–585), expressed in bacteria, specifically binds to a GST-TDG fusion protein (Fig. 1B). To investigate the TDG and myocardin interaction in vivo, COS cells were transduced with cardiac or smooth muscle isoforms of myocardin (myc-tagged or Omni-tagged, respectively) and TDG (HA-tagged) adenovirus and anti-myc or anti-HA antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate myocardin-TDG complexes. Western blotting of the precipitated complexes revealed that TDG bound to both myocardin isoforms within cells (Fig. 1C). TDG Suppresses Myocardin- and Myocardin-related Transcription Factor-induced Transactivation of Smooth Muscle-specific Promoters—Data described above demonstrated that TDG localizes in nuclei of smooth muscle cells and physically binds to myocardin in vitro and in vivo. To determine whether TDG functionally interacts with myocardin, myocardin was co-transfected together with telokin, SM22α, SM α-actin, and SM MHC promoter-luciferase reporter genes with or without TDG expression plasmid into 10T1/2 cells and the subsequent affects on promoter activity determined. Data from these experiments revealed that TDG repressed the myocardin-mediated activation of each of these promoters in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). TDG alone had no effect on the basal activity of these reporters in these non-muscle cells (data not shown). TDG also repressed the myocardin-induced activation of a reporter plasmid containing 5 copies of a consensus CArG box (Fig. 2B). These data demonstrate that the CArG box motif is sufficient for TDG-mediated repression of the myocardin-stimulated promoter activity. Furthermore, TDG attenuated the transactivation of the SM22α promoter induced by myocardin-related transcription factors, MRTF-A and MRTF-B (Fig. 2C). TDG also attenuated transactivation induced by a dimerization defective myocardin, indicating the TDG is unlikely to inhibit myocardin through interfering with its dimerization (Fig. 2D). The inhibitory effects of TDG on myocardin and the MRTFs are specific, as TDG was not able to affect SRF-induced transactivation of the telokin promoter, whereas an SRF mutant that lacked the C-terminal transactivation domain decreases the activation in a dose dependent fashion (Fig. 2E). TDG Abrogates Myocardin-induced Expression of Smooth Muscle-specific Genes—Data presented above show that TDG suppressed myocardin-induced trans-activation of smooth muscle-specific promoters. We next determined the effects of TDG on the induction of endogenous smooth muscle-specific genes by myocardin in fibroblast cells. Myocardin or empty pcDNA plasmids were transfected into 10T1/2 cells together TDG expression plasmids and 24 h after transfection, RNA was harvested from these cells and subjected to quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 3).

Binding of GPI and autoantibody to the joint surface is a prerequisite for joint-specific inflammation. However, how GPI localizes to the joint remains unclear. We show that glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are the high affinity (83 nm) joint receptors for GPI. The binding affinity and structural differences between mouse paw/ankle GAGs and elbows/knee GAGs correlated with the distal to proximal disease severity in these joints. We found that cartilage surface GPI binding was greatly reduced by either chondroitinase ABC or β-glucuronidase treatment. We also identified several inhibitors that inhibit both GPI/GAG interaction and GPI enzymatic activities, which suggests that the GPI GAG-binding domain overlaps with the active site of GPI enzyme. Our studies raise the possibility that GAGs are the receptors for other autoantigens involved in joint-specific inflammatory responses.

The K/BxN murine model of RA emulates human RA joint specificity; inflammation is much more prominent in the paws and ankles of the mouse than in the knees or hips. The autoantigen in the K/BxN model (1Matsumoto I. Staub A. Benoist C. Mathis D. Science.. 1999; 286: 1732-1735Google Scholar, 2Wipke B.T. Wang Z. Nagengast W. Reichert D.E. Allen P.M. J.

This enzyme is required for glucose utilization in every cell, but it is also present in the extracellular fluid. When anti-GPI antibodies (Ab) from K/BxN serum are transferred to most strains of normal mice, synovial arthritis similar to RA is elicited (2Wipke B.T. Wang Z. Nagengast W. Reichert D.E. Allen P.M.

However, the nature of GPI receptors in the joint is unknown. Based on histological features, including the number of chondrocytes and their morphology, collagen fiber orientation, and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) concentration, articular cartilage has four distinct layers, superficial, middle, deep, and calcified. GAGs are abundantly expressed in all layers of cartilage. GAGs, such as heparan sulfate (HS) and chondroitin sulfate (CS), consist of repeating disaccharides of a uronic acid and a glycosamine. The incomplete epimerization of GlcA to iduronic acid and sulfation at different positions of repeating disaccharides in HS give rise to 48 possible disaccharide structures, of which 23 have been found (7Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem.. 2002; 71: 435-471Google Scholar). Because of building block-disaccharide complexity, GAGs are the most information-dense biopolymers found in nature. Transgenic and knock-out animal data in the past decade provide compelling evidence that animals use precise GAG sequences in multicellular communications (7Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem.. 2002; 71: 435-471Google Scholar). GAG sequences are not directly encoded by genes but are assembled in the Golgi by enzymes encoded by over 40 genes. Because of the vast expression repertoire of the GAG assembly enzymes and existence of GAG structural modification enzymes in extracellular matrix, GAGs display a sulfation pattern, chain length, and fine structure unique to each cell and tissue (8Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Investig.. 2001; 108: 169-173Google Scholar). GlcA is structurally similar to the natural substrate of GPI, glucose 6-phosphate (Structure 1). We hypothesize that GPI binds to GlcA residues of GAGs on the cartilage surface via its active site, providing a joint-specific target for anti-GPI Ab. The results in this study support our hypothesis. In addition, several inhibitors of this GPI/GAG interaction were identified. Our results suggested that the distal to proximal distribution severity of arthritis in K/BxN mice could be accounted for by the difference in GAG structures we found in small versus large joints, and a differential ability to bind GPI may set up the threshold in initiating the anti-GPI autoimmune response. GAG Isolation from Joints—Joint samples, including ∼3-mm bones on both sides of joint, were harvested from BALB/c mice (6–8 weeks of age). External skin and muscle were removed, and the wet weight of each sample pool (paws/ankle or knees/elbows) was recorded after the intact joints were washed and blotted dry. The samples were scissor-minced and then transferred to 50-ml conical tubes containing 1 ml/g wet weight (but a minimum 0.5 ml of water). The samples were homogenized with a Polytron. GAGs were then isolated by DEAE-Sephacel chromatography followed by ethanol precipitation as described in Studelska et al. (9Studelska D.R. Giljum K. McDowell L.M. Zhang L. Glycobiology.. 2006; 16: 65-72Google Scholar). GAG Quantification—The steps were acid hydrolysis, sodium borohydride reduction, precolumn derivatization with o-phthaldialdehyde and 3-mercaptopropionic acid, and reversed phase HPLC separation with fluorescence detection of the isoindole derivatives. GAG aliquots containing 6 nmol of norleucine as an internal standard were dried in pyrolized glass vials (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA, part 5181-8872) before hydrolysis with HCl vapor in N2 gas at 100 °C for 3 h. The samples were rehydrated in 45 μl of 0.56% NaBH4 to reduce the glucosamine and galactosamine liberated by acid hydrolysis into glucosaminitol and galactosaminitol, respectively. After 3 h or overnight at room temperature, the reaction was terminated by adding 5 μl of 2 n acetic acid to each vial. A 5-μl aliquot of each hydrolyzed and reduced sample was transferred to a fresh auto-sampler insert vial for precolumn derivatization with 35 μl of 7.5 mm o-phthaldialdehyde, 375 mm 3-mercaptopropionic acid, in 0.4 n borate adjusted to pH 9.3 with NaOH. Half of this reaction mixture was injected onto a 4.6 × 250-mm C-12 column, a Synergi 4μ MAX-RP 80 Å (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, part 00G-4337-E0), heated to 35 °C. The column was equilibrated with Buffer A, consisting of 0.05 m (monobasic and dibasic) sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, in 25% methanol, at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Buffer B consisted of methanol/water/tetrahydrofuran at 70:30:3 volume ratios. After injection, Buffer B was increased from 0 to 8% by a linear gradient between 0 and 3 min, was maintained at 8% between 3 and 18 min, at 55% between 18 and 30.5 min, at 100% between 30.5 and 32.5 min, and at 0% between 32.5 and 35 min. A 5-min post-run interval at 0% B precedes the initiation of the next precolumn derivatization injection sequence. The fluorescent derivatives of glucosaminitol, galactosaminitol, and the amino acids contained in the GAG preparations were excited at 337 nm and detected at 454 nm. A more detailed description of this assay is available elsewhere (9Studelska D.R. Giljum K. McDowell L.M. Zhang L. Glycobiology.. 2006; 16: 65-72Google Scholar). Iodination of GPI—Thirty μg of recombinant mouse GPI was labeled with 125I (as Na125I, Amersham IMS-30) by the Chizzonite indirect method using IODO-GEN® pre-coated tubes (Pierce 28601) and the protocol supplied by the vendor. Tris/NaCl/EDTA buffer was used instead of Tris/BSA buffer for column washing, fraction collection, and protein dilution after labeling. Gel Mobility Shift Assay—We increased the sensitivity of published gel mobility shift assay (10Wu Z.L. Zhang L. Beeler D.L. Kuberan B. Rosenberg R.D. FASEB J.. 2002; 16: 539-545Google Scholar) by using 125I-labeled GPI in nanomolar ranges instead of 35S-labeled GAGs, which require micromolar range of GAG-binding proteins in the binding reactions. We also improved the gel mobility shift assay by loading the sample in the middle of the gel and allowing protein to move either to cathode or anode depending on its physiological pI (10Wu Z.L. Zhang L. Beeler D.L. Kuberan B. Rosenberg R.D. FASEB J.. 2002; 16: 539-545Google Scholar). Briefly, the two directional native-horizontal gel was performed with 4.5% polyacrylamide gels using 0.12% piperazine diacrylamide as a cross-linker. The gels contained 10 mm Tris, adjusted to pH 7.4 with HAc. The 50-ml gels were poured in a casting stand for a Screener RG100 horizontal gel apparatus (Biokey American Instruments, Inc., Beaverton, OR), with a 13- or 26-well comb placed in the middle. To hasten polymerization, higher than usual amounts of TEMED (50 μl), and ammonium persulfate (1.0 ml of a 10% solution) were employed. In the Screener RG100, anodal and cathodal buffer chambers were sealed by the ends of the gel, which was overlaid with 350 ml of water in a center chamber. The water cools the gel during electrophoresis, allowing higher voltages and longer runs. The buffer chambers were filled with a running buffer consisting of 40 mm Tris and 40 mm acetic acid, adjusted to pH 7.4. Each component of a binding reaction, i.e. GAGs and other components such as GPI inhibitors, was added in binding buffer, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, 12% glycerol, and pH adjusted to 7.4. After the addition of 125I-GPI, the last component, to give a final enzyme concentration of 50 nm, the binding reaction volume was 12 μl. After 20 min at room temperature, 5-μl aliquots of each reaction were pipetted through water into the bottom of wells pre-filled with binding buffer containing 8% glycerol, which overlaid the denser binding reaction mixture. Electrophoresis was at 20 watts until xylene cyanole dye, loaded into one of the end wells, eluted from the gel. The gel was dried onto blotting paper in a gel dryer at 70 °C before it was placed in a GE Healthcare cassette for exposure to a storage phosphor screen (Eastman Kodak Co.) The screen was read in a Storm 840 PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). The radioactivity values of the GPI migrating toward the cathode were measured by NIH Image software (10Wu Z.L. Zhang L. Beeler D.L. Kuberan B. Rosenberg R.D. FASEB J.. 2002; 16: 539-545Google Scholar). Flow Cytometric Analysis of GPI Binding—CHO 745 cells, CHO CS, or CHO HS&CS cells were treated with EDTA to lift them off culture plates, and binding of GPI was performed with 5 μg of recombinant mouse GPI on ice for 30 min. GPI binding was detected with 1 μg of αGPI monoclonal antibody 147 followed by goat anti-mouse Alexa-488 antibody. Negative controls included αGPI monoclonal antibody 147 plus goat anti-mouse Alexa-488 antibody without GPI preincubation, or goat anti-mouse Alexa-488 antibody alone. Samples were collected on BD FACSCalibur with 10,000 cells analyzed by FlowJo. Immunohistology of Joint GPI Stain—Paraffin sections from ankle and knee joints were prepared. K/BxN serum was used as the primary antibody for joint stain. Serial 6-μm sections were de-paraffinized and air-dried for 1 h at room temperature followed by washing with PBS. Sections were fixed with 50% acetone in PBS for 10 min on ice, incubated with PBS containing 2 m NaCl (pH 7.4) for 10 min at room temperature to remove GAG-binding proteins, and blocked in PBS containing 0.5% BSA overnight at 4 °C. In some experiments, sections were treated with enzymes at 37 °C for 2 h to digest selected GAG structures. Subsequently, sections were incubated with 20 nm recombinant mouse GPI for 30 min, followed by incubation with 1:50 diluted sera of arthritic K/BxN mice in PBS containing 0.5% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes, sections were incubated with Alexa-488-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:200. Negative controls included 1:50 diluted sera of arthritic K/BxN mice plus goat anti-mouse Alexa-488 antibody without GPI preincubation, or goat anti-mouse Alexa-488 antibody alone. Nuclear staining was achieved by incubation for 15 min with a 1:2,500 dilution of To-Pro-3 (Invitrogen). Sections were mounted using fluorescent mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) and analyzed using a Zeiss 510 Meta LSM confocal microscope. To quantify the staining intensity, we used imaging software (Carl Zeiss version 3.2) of the Zeiss 510 Meta LSM confocal microscope to integrate the mean intensity of GPI staining (green) and mean intensity of nuclear staining (blue) of each image, and then we calculated the intensity ratio. GPI Enzyme Kinetics—We assayed the GPI-catalyzed conversion of fructose 6-phosphate (Fru-6-P) to glucose 6-phosphate by monitoring the activity of a second enzyme, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the oxidation of glucose 6-phosphate and the coupled reduction of NADP to UV-absorbing NADPH (11Kahana S.E. Lowry O.H. Schulz D.W. Passonneau J.V. Crawford E.J. J. Biol. Chem.. 1960; 235: 2178-2184Google Scholar). Parallel 200-μl reactions were monitored at 340 nm and 37 °C using a Molecular Devices SpectraMax M2 plate reader (Sunnyvale, CA) in the absorbance mode. At a final dilution, each well contained 4.2 units/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Sigma G-6378), 1.0 mm NADP (Sigma N0505), 0.4 μg/ml recombinant mouse GPI, and inhibitors at various concentrations in 50 mm Tris, 88 mm KCl, pH 8.0. After equilibration at 37 °C, the reactions were initiated by the addition of 20 μl of Fru-6-P (Sigma F1502) for a final Fru-6-P concentration of 2 mm. Absorbances of up to eight reactions were read every 3 s during an 8-min run. Vmax values were estimated using Softmax Pro 4.6. Because this is a coupled two-enzyme system, we tested the effect of our putative GPI inhibitors on glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity in separate control experiments and found them to have no direct effect on glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Capillary HPLC-coupled Mass Spectrometry—GAGs were exhaustively digested by chondroitinase ABC. The resulting mono-, di-, tri, tetra-, and oligosaccharides were analyzed by capillary HPLC-coupled MS. An Agilent 1100 series capillary HPLC workstation (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA) with Chemstation software was used for data acquisition, analysis, and management. HPLC separations were performed on a 0.3 × 250-mm C18 column (Zorbax 300SB, 5 μm, Agilent) using a binary solvent system composed of 5% methanol (eluent A) and 90% methanol in water (eluent B); both contained 3.5 mm dibutylamine and were adjusted to pH 5.5 with 2 m HAc. After injection of a 0.5-μl sample, the elution profile was 0% B for 7 min, 15% B for 9 min, 40% B for 11 min, and 100% B for 23 min. The flow rate was 5 μl/min, and absorbances at 232, 260, and 280 nm were monitored during each run. After each run the column was washed with 90% B for 15 min and equilibrated with 100% A for 40 min. The capillary HPLC was directly coupled to the mass spectrometer. Mass spectra were acquired on a Mariner BioSpectrometry workstation electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) in the negative ion mode. Nitrogen was used as a desolvation gas as well as a nebulizer. Conditions for electrospray ionization-MS were as follows: nebulizer flow, 1 liter/min; nozzle temperature, 140 °C; N2 flow, 0.1 liter/min; spray tip potential, 2.8 kV; nozzle potential, 70 V; and skimmer potential, 9 V. Negative ion spectra were collected by scanning the m/z range 150–1000. During analyses, the vacuum was 2.1 × 10- 6 torr. TIC chromatograms and mass spectra were processed with Data Explorer software version 3.0. GPI Binds to Joint GAGs—It is unknown how GPI binds to the articular cartilage. Because GlcA is a component of joint GAGs and is similar to the natural substrate of GPI, glucose 6-phosphate, we hypothesized that GPI was able to bind to GlcA residues of joint GAGs via its catalytic site. To test this, GAGs were extracted from mouse paw/ankle and elbow/knee (see under “Experimental Procedures”) and then quantified by our published method (9Studelska D.R. Giljum K. McDowell L.M. Zhang L. Glycobiology.. 2006; 16: 65-72Google Scholar). Equal amounts of galactosamine containing GAGs were used in a gel mobility shift assay to measure GPI/GAG interaction. This solution-phase test of protein/GAG interaction has been used to measure binding affinity between GAG and proteins (10Wu Z.L. Zhang L. Beeler D.L. Kuberan B. Rosenberg R.D. FASEB J.. 2002; 16: 539-545Google Scholar, 13Wu Z.L. Zhang L. Yabe T. Kuberan B. Beeler D.L. Love A. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem.. 2003; 278: 17121-17129Google Scholar). Using the gel mobility shift assay, we showed that GPI could bind to mouse paw/ankle GAGs (Fig. 1A). Recombinant GPI migrated toward the anode, demonstrating that GPI has a net positive charge at pH 7.4 (Fig. 1A). Paw/ankle GAGs bind to GPI and reverse the direction of GPI migration from anode to cathode, the same direction as negatively charged GAGs. The magnitude of this GAG effect is dependent upon GAG concentration. A molar ratio of 100 galactosamine to 1 GPI substantially reversed the direction of GPI migration. The GPI/GAG interaction was of high affinity, with a KD calculated to be 83 nm. Thus, GPI is able to bind directly and strongly to GAGs. GAGs from Paws/Ankles Have Higher GPI Binding Affinity than Those in Knees/Elbows—In Ab transfer experiments, α-GPI Ig preferentially localized to the paw/ankles. Also, arthritis is more pronounced in the paw/ankles compared with the knees/elbows. To ascertain if this distal to proximal disease severity could be explained by the paw/ankle GAGs having a higher GPI binding capacity, we compared the paw/ankle and knee/elbow GAGs (Fig. 1C). Paw/ankle GAGs display much higher activity than knee/elbow GAGs in this measure of interaction with GPI. The greater activity of paw/ankle GAGs can be seen most clearly at the 25:1 GAG:GPI ratio. To obtain the same activity from knee/elbow GAGs, a 4-fold higher ratio (100:1) was required (data not shown). These findings demonstrate that the paw/ankle GAGs display higher ability to bind GPI, which directly correlates with the observed disease severity. GPI Bound to Cell Surface CS—Having demonstrated that GPI could directly bind to GAGs, we wanted to determine what GAGs were involved in the binding. Quantification of hexosamine content of the isolated GAGs indicated that they were 92–97% galactosamine and therefore CS. The rest of the GAGs (3–8%) contained glucosamine and could be keratan sulfate, heparin, HS, and hyaluronan. To identify the GAGs that bind to GPI, we decided to test cell surface GAGs/GPI interaction by flow cytometry. To show that GPI can directly bind to CS, we took advantage of available GAG-deficient CHO cell lines. CHO cells do not synthesize keratan sulfate and hyaluronan. CHO-745 is a cell mutant defective in xylosyltransferase responsible for initiating both HS and CS biosynthesis (14Esko J.D. Stewart T.E. Taylor W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1985; 82: 3197-3201Google Scholar). As a result, CHO-745 synthesizes little HS and CS (15Avirutnan P. Zhang L. Punyadee N. Manuyakorn A. Puttikhunt C. Kasinrerk W. Malasit P. Atkinson J.P. Diamond M.S. PLoS Pathog.. 2007; 3: e183Google Scholar). CHO CS is an HS-deficient (100% CS) mutant (16Zhang L. Lawrence R. Frazier B.A. Esko J.D. Methods Enzymol.. 2006; 416: 205-221Google Scholar, 17Avirutnan P. Zhang L. Punyadee N. Manuyakorn A. Puttikhunt C. Kasinrerk W. Malasit P. Atkinson J.P. Diamond M.S. PLoS Pathog.. 2007; 3: e183Google Scholar, 18Lawrence R. Lu H. Rosenberg R.D. Esko J.D. Zhang L. Nat. Meth.. 2008; 5: 291-292Google Scholar). CHO HS&CS is a wild-type cell line that synthesizes 70% HS and 30% CS. GPI binding is detected via αGPI monoclonal antibody 147. Binding of αGPI monoclonal antibody 147 was detected by goat anti-mouse Alexa-488. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that GPI binds best to CHO CS cell surface, followed by CHO HS&CS, but not to GAG deficient CHO-745 cells (Fig. 2). αGPI monoclonal antibody 147 plus goat anti-mouse Alexa-488 antibody in the absence of GPI or goat anti-mouse Alexa-488 antibody alone did not show binding on these cells. Thus, GPI showed specific binding to CS. Because 92–97% of joint GAGs are CS, CS is likely the natural ligand of GPI in the joint. GPI Bound to Cartilage Surface CS—We then determined if GPI binds to joint cartilage surface through specific interaction with in situ CS. To this end, paraffin sections of ankle and knee joints from normal C57BL/6 (B6) mice were prepared. These sections were probed with GPI plus diluted sera of arthritic K/BxN mice followed by Alexa-488-conjugated rat anti-mouse antibody. Cell nuclei were stained with To-Pro-3. Sections were examined by confocal fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3). The joint space is outlined on either side by parallel rows of spaced nuclei that belong to the chondrocyte of the superficial layer of articular cartilage. Thin layers of bright continuous GPI staining are found immediately above the chondrocyte layers on either side of the paw joint space, decorating the articular surfaces. Such intensive staining was not observed in the no GPI control and was greatly reduced by either chondroitinase ABC or β-glucuronidase treatments that respectively digest CS or cleave terminal GlcA moieties from CS chains. In contrast, the knee joint cartilage GPI staining was weaker than that of the paw. The staining was also reduced by chondroitinase ABC treatment, but interestingly, it was not affected by β-glucuronidase treatment. GPI staining was also found around the nuclei of chondrocytes, as would be expected for an enzyme with a well established cytoplasmic function. Chondroitinase ABC or β-glucuronidase treatment did not affect this cytoplasmic binding as expected. To quantify the staining intensity, we used imaging software (Carl Zeiss version 3.2) with a Zeiss 510 Meta LSM confocal microscope to calculate the ratio of the intensity of joint surface GPI staining (green) versus nuclear staining of the adjacent chondrocyte layer (blue) (Table 1). The highest ratio, 2.64, was produced by the joint surface of paws. This compares to 1.86 from knee joint surfaces. After adjusting for the background levels observed in the no GPI controls, there is roughly twice as much GPI specifically retained on the paw joint surface. Chondroitinase ABC treatment reduced both paw and knee joint green/blue stain ratios to no GPI background levels. In contrast, β-glucuronidase eliminated specific GPI staining in paw joints but had no effect on GPI on knee joints surfaces. These results suggest that CS is essential for sequestering GPI in both joints, but that the basis for the lower level of GPI binding in the knee joint does not involve terminal β-glucuronic acid residues. In contrast, paw cartilage surfaces are replete with CS enriched with terminal β-glucuronic acid residues. These results are consistent with the gel mobility results shown in Fig. 5 and the markedly higher levels of GlcA terminal structures detected in paws by mass spectrometry (Fig. 4).TABLE 1Ratio of the intensity of GPI versus nuclear stains in paws and knees (green, GPI; blue, nuclear)Type of stainingPaws (green/blue)Knees (green/blue)GPI2.641.86No GPI control1.271.14Chondroitinase ABC + GPI1.161.01β-Glucuronidase + GPI0.932.20 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 4Capillary HPLC-coupled MS analysis of CS GAG structures from mouse paws/ankles and knees/elbows.

The reported structural differences between paw/ankle GAGs to knee/elbow GAGs were constant in every instance.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) CS Structures from Mouse Paws/Ankles and Knees/Elbows Are Different—Traditionally, GAG repeating disaccharide composition, linkage hexasaccharides, and reducing and non-reducing end sugar structures have to be isolated and analyzed individually. Our lab has adopted and developed a capillary HPLC-coupled mass spectrometry (capillary HPLC/MS) method that allows us to collect multiple GAG structural information by both UV and MS detection. To understand the molecular basis of the binding affinity differences, GAGs isolated from paw/ankle and knee/elbow joints were digested with chondroitinase ABC that generated various mono-, di-, tri, tetra-, and GAG linkage hexasaccharides. Different sugars were separated by a capillary HPLC column. Chondroitinase ABC generated a double bond at uronic residues of repeating disaccharides as well as at uronic residues of all linkage hexasaccharides, which produced a UV absorbance at 232 nm. All sugar ions either with UV or non-UV absorbance were objectively detected by MS, which generated a TIC chromatogram (Fig. 4A). The summed UV signal from the chromatograms of all the disaccharides divided by the UV signal of the linkage hexasaccharide allowed a rough estimate of average chain length. Based on the UV signal, paw/ankle CS had 21 saccharides per CS chain, whereas knee/elbow CS had 40 saccharides per CS chain. Fig. 4B shows the extracted ion current of non-, mono-, di-, and trisulfated disaccharides from TIC shown in Fig. 4A. Disulfated disaccharides ([M - 2H]2- 268.5) in paw/ankle CS were 9% versus 4% in knee/elbow CS. Trisulfated disaccharides (m/z 747) were only observed in paw/ankle CS. The left panel of Fig. 4C shows the extracted IC of mono-, di-, and trisulfated CS linkage hexasaccharides (Hexa 1S, Hexa 2S, and Hexa 3S). Paw/ankle CS had increased mono- and trisulfated linkage hexasaccharides (Fig. 4C, left panel). More importantly, ∼4-fold more nonreducing end GlcA was observed in CS from paw/ankle (Fig. 4C, right panel) in which two nonreducing end ions (GalNAc 1S and GlcA-GalNAc 1S) were extracted from the TIC shown in Fig. 4A. The capillary HPLC/MS data shown in Fig. 4 indicated that the building blocks of CS from paw/ankle were different from those of knee/elbow. Particularly, the terminal saccharide is more often GlcA in paws than in knees, which correlates with the observed disease severity. Nonreducing End GlcA"
https://openalex.org/W2084565846,"The evolutionary history of several genes of the bacterial pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes strongly suggests an origin in another species, acquired via replacement of the counterpart gene (ortholog) following a recombination event. An example of orthologous gene replacement is provided by the nra/rofA locus, which encodes a key regulator of pilus gene transcription. Of biological importance is the previous finding that the presence of the nra- and rofA-lineage alleles, which are approximately 35% divergent, correlates strongly with genetic markers for streptococcal infection at different tissue sites in the human host (skin, throat).In this report, the impact of orthologous gene replacement targeting the nra/rofA locus is experimentally addressed. Replacement of the native nra-lineage allele with a rofA-lineage allele, plus their respective upstream regions, preserved the polarity of Nra effects on pilus gene transcription (i.e., activation) in the skin strain Alab49. Increased pilus gene transcription in the rofA chimera correlated with a higher rate of bacterial growth at the skin. The transcriptional regulator MsmR, which represses nra and pilus gene transcription in the Alab49 parent strain, has a slight activating effect on pilus gene expression in the rofA chimera construct.Data show that exchange of orthologous forms of a regulatory gene is stable and robust, and pathogenicity is preserved. Yet, new phenotypes may also be introduced by altering the circuitry within a complex transcriptional regulatory network. It is proposed that orthologous gene replacement via interspecies exchange is an important mechanism in the evolution of highly recombining bacteria such as S. pyogenes."
https://openalex.org/W1987897594,"Many membrane proteins, including Drosophila Dscam, are enriched in dendrites or axons within neurons. However, little is known about how the differential distribution is established and maintained.Here we investigated the mechanisms underlying the dendritic targeting of Dscam[TM1]. Through forward genetic mosaic screens and by silencing specific genes via targeted RNAi, we found that several genes, encoding various components of the dynein-dynactin complex, are required for restricting Dscam[TM1] to the mushroom body dendrites. In contrast, compromising dynein/dynactin function did not affect dendritic targeting of two other dendritic markers, Nod and Rdl. Tracing newly synthesized Dscam[TM1] further revealed that compromising dynein/dynactin function did not affect the initial dendritic targeting of Dscam[TM1], but disrupted the maintenance of its restriction to dendrites.The results of this study suggest multiple mechanisms of dendritic protein targeting. Notably, dynein-dynactin plays a role in excluding dendritic Dscam, but not Rdl, from axons by retrograde transport."
https://openalex.org/W2104073214,"Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is thought to be an important mechanism for preventing the adverse effects of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and its absence has been associated with premature aging. To investigate the effect of inactivated NHEJ on spontaneous mutation frequencies and spectra in vivo and in cultured cells, we crossed a Ku80-deficient mouse with mice harboring a lacZ-plasmid-based mutation reporter. We analyzed various organs and tissues, as well as cultured embryonic fibroblasts, for mutations at the lacZ locus. When comparing mutant with wild-type mice, we observed a significantly higher number of genome rearrangements in liver and spleen and a significantly lower number of point mutations in liver and brain. The reduced point mutation frequency was not due to a decrease in small deletion mutations thought to be a hallmark of NHEJ, but could be a consequence of increased cellular responses to unrepaired DSBs. Indeed, we found a substantial increase in persistent 53BP1 and gammaH2AX DNA damage foci in Ku80-/- as compared to wild-type liver. Treatment of cultured Ku80-deficient or wild-type embryonic fibroblasts, either proliferating or quiescent, with hydrogen peroxide or bleomycin showed no differences in the number or type of induced genome rearrangements. However, after such treatment, Ku80-deficient cells did show an increased number of persistent DNA damage foci. These results indicate that Ku80-dependent repair of DNA damage is predominantly error-free with the effect of alternative more error-prone pathways creating genome rearrangements only detectable after extended periods of time, i.e., in young adult animals. The observed premature aging likely results from a combination of increased cellular senescence and an increased load of stable, genome rearrangements."
https://openalex.org/W2086614509,"Restrained worker honey bees are a valuable model for studying the behavioral and neural bases of olfactory plasticity. The proboscis extension response (PER; the proboscis is the mouthpart of honey bees) is released in response to sucrose stimulation. If sucrose stimulation is preceded one or a few times by an odor (forward pairing), the bee will form a memory for this association, and subsequent presentations of the odor alone are sufficient to elicit the PER. However, backward pairing between the two stimuli (sucrose, then odor) has not been studied to any great extent in bees, although the vertebrate literature indicates that it elicits a form of inhibitory plasticity.If hungry bees are fed with sucrose, they will release a long lasting PER; however, this PER can be interrupted if an odor is presented 15 seconds (but not 7 or 30 seconds) after the sucrose (backward pairing). We refer to this previously unreported process as olfactory interference. Bees receiving this 15 second backward pairing show reduced performance after a subsequent single forward pairing (excitatory conditioning) trial. Analysis of the results supported a relationship between olfactory interference and a form of backward pairing-induced inhibitory learning/memory. Injecting the drug cimetidine into the deutocerebrum impaired olfactory interference.Olfactory interference depends on the associative link between odor and PER, rather than between odor and sucrose. Furthermore, pairing an odor with sucrose can lead either to association of this odor to PER or to the inhibition of PER by this odor. Olfactory interference may provide insight into processes that gate how excitatory and inhibitory memories for odor-PER associations are formed."

However, the intermonomer interactions that stabilize F-actin have not been elucidated because of a lack of an F-actin crystal structure. The Holmes muscle actin model suggests that an ionic interaction between Arg-39 of one monomer and Glu-167 of an adjacent monomer in the same strand contributes to this stabilization. Yeast actin has an Ala-167 instead. F-actin molecular dynamics modeling predicts another interaction between Arg-39 of one monomer and Asp-275 of an opposing strand monomer. In Toxoplasma gondii actin, which forms short stubby filaments, the Asp-275 equivalent is replaced by Arg leading to a potential filament-destabilizing charge-charge repulsion. Using yeast actin, we tested the effect of A167E as a potential stabilizer and A167R and D275R as potential filament disruptors. All mutations caused abnormal growth and mitochondrial malfunction. A167E and D275R actins polymerize normally and form relatively normal appearing filaments. A167R nucleates filaments more slowly and forms filament bundles. The R39D/A167R double mutant, which re-establishes an ionic bond in the opposite orientation, reverses this polymerization and bundling defect. Stoichiometric amounts of yeast cofilin have little effect on wild-type and A167E filaments. However, D275R and A167R actin depolymerization is profound with cofilin. Although our results suggest that disruption of an interaction between Arg-39 and Asp-275 is not sufficient to cause fragmentation, it suggests that it changes filament stability thereby disposing it for enhanced cofilin depolymerizing effects.

It is involved in many physiological processes such as cell motility, establishment of polarity, contraction, cytokinesis, intracellular trafficking, and maintenance of structural integrity. In physiological conditions, monomeric G-actin will polymerize to filamentous F-actin, and this ability to form a double-stranded filament is required for actin to carry out the vast majority of its physiological functions (1.Carlier M.F.

Although G-actin has a slight ATPase activity, this activity is enhanced several fold in F-actin (11.Pollard T.D. Weeds A.G. FEBS Lett. 1984; 170: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Although several high resolution structures of G-actin have been solved, there are only models for the F-actin filament. Currently, the most accepted models of F-actin are derivatives of the Holmes model generated by fitting the monomer structure of actin in the closed state to a low electron density map of oriented F-actin gels (12.Lorenz M. Poole K.J. Popp D. Rosenbaum G. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 108-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 13.Holmes K.C. Popp D. Gebhard W. Kabsch W. Nature. 1990; 347: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). The contacts between the monomers are made in a way that subdomains 1 and 2 largely constitute the outside surface and subdomains 3 and 4 the internal strand-strand interface. However, the precise intermonomer interactions that lead to the stabilization of this filament structure have not been elucidated. One of the major ways that intermonomer contacts in the filament might be stabilized is via intermonomer ionic interactions. Modeling studies have suggested that two ionic bonds, each involving Arg-39 in the DNase I loop in subdomain 2 of one monomer, might play such a role. The original Holmes filament model of muscle actin predicts an ionic interaction between Arg-39 of one monomer and Glu-167 of an adjacent monomer in the opposing strand of the actin filament (12.Lorenz M. Poole K.J. Popp D. Rosenbaum G. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 108-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). This same interaction would also be present in mammalian β- and γ-nonmuscle actins. Yeast actin is 87% homologous with muscle actin and 90% homologous with the two nonmuscle actins, making it an excellent model for understanding basic actin biochemical behavior. In yeast actin, Glu-167 is replaced by an Ala, preventing such an interaction from occurring. Yeast actin filaments fragment more easily than do muscle actin filaments (14.Buzan J.M. Frieden C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and show a commensurate shorter mean filament length (9 μm for muscle (15.Isambert H. Venier P. Maggs A.C.

Chem. 1995; 270: 11437-11444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) compared with 3.6 μm for yeast actin (16.McKane M. Wen K.K. Meyer A. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29916-29928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar)) suggesting that yeast actin filaments are less stable than muscle filaments. This change correlates with a decreased ionic interaction resulting from the Glu-167 to Ala change, but the existence of this ionic interaction or its importance to actin filament stability has not been experimentally addressed. Suggestion of a second potential filament-stabilizing ionic interaction grew out of the work of Sahoo et al. (17.Sahoo N. Beatty W. Heuser J. Sept D. Sibley L.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 895-906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) on the properties of actin from the parasite Toxoplasma gondii. Molecular dynamics modeling of muscle actin predicted an ionic interaction between Arg-39 of one monomer and a Glu at residue 275 of a neighboring monomer, which is not predicted by the Holmes model. In yeast actin, this Glu is replaced by an Asp, still permitting the formation of this ionic bond. T. gondii uses short actin filaments for a gliding type of motility and host invasion, and purified T. gondii actin will not form normal-appearing long filaments in vitro. The residue in T. gondii actin that corresponds to 275 in muscle actin is Arg-276. The arginine here would create a repulsive interaction between Arg-276 and Arg-39 of adjacent monomers potentially leading to filament destabilization and perhaps resulting in the short filaments that were observed. Again, the effect of this repulsive interaction alone on actin filament stability has not been tested. Positions of the residues in question in the Holmes filament model are represented in Fig. 1. The Arg-39 to Glu-167 bond distance is 4.02 Å (12.Lorenz M. Poole K.J. Popp D. Rosenbaum G. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 108-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and the Arg-39 to Asp-275 bond distance is between 3 and 3.5 Å (17.Sahoo N. Beatty W. Heuser J. Sept D. Sibley L.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 895-906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2D. Sept, personal communication. Predictions based on modeling studies require experimental studies to establish whether they are correct or incorrect. In this study, we have used site-directed mutagenesis of yeast actin to introduce mutations at residues 167 and 275 that might be expected to lead either to ionic bond stabilization or destabilization with Arg-39. We then examine the effects of these mutations in vivo in yeast, purified the mutant actins, and assessed the effects of these mutations on actin polymerization in vitro. DNase I (grade D) was purchased from Worthington Biochemicals. DE52 DEAE-cellulose was obtained from Whatman. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), and the DNA primers used for site-directed mutagenesis were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Rhodamine-phalloidin, FM 4–64, and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole were purchased from Molecular Probes-Invitrogen. 1,N6-Ethenoadenosine 5′-triphosphate (ϵ-ATP) 3The abbreviations used are: ϵ-ATP, 1,N6-ethenoadenosine 5′-triphosphate; GFP, green fluorescent protein; WT, wild type; EM, electron microscopy. was purchased from Invitrogen. Yeast cakes for wild-type (WT) yeast actin controls were purchased from a local bakery. All other chemicals used were of reagent grade quality. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a Stratagene kit according to the manufacturer's instruction. The template plasmid was pRS314-based, which is a TRP1-marked yeast shuttle vector into which was inserted the yeast ACT1 promoter and coding sequence (18.Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids that had the desired actin mutation were transformed into a yeast strain whose chromosomal actin gene was disrupted by the LEU2 gene. In this strain, WT actin was expressed from another centromeric plasmid marked with the URA3 gene. Cells were grown in the appropriate selection media to select for the plasmid carrying the mutated actin gene and to encourage elimination of the plasmid carrying the WT actin gene (16.McKane M. Wen K.K. Meyer A. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29916-29928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Plasmids were isolated from the final colonies and sequenced to ensure the presence of the desired mutation. R39D/A167R actin could not be generated from a normal WT cell host, because it was not compatible with cell viability. However, it was successfully obtained spontaneously as a suppressor from a yeast strain carrying a mutant profilin (details to be published elsewhere). To examine the effects of the mutations on growth characteristics, growth curves were generated. WT and mutant strains were grown in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% dextrose) liquid media at 30 °C. Cell density (A600) was monitored with time, and doubling times were determined as described previously (19.McKane M. Wen K.K. Boldogh I.R. Ramcharan S. Pon L.A. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36494-36501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Temperature sensitivity, hyperosmotic sensitivity, and growth on glycerol were examined as described previously (19.McKane M. Wen K.K. Boldogh I.R. Ramcharan S. Pon L.A. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36494-36501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A PCR fragment was generated from the plasmid pFA6a-GFP-kanMX6 that has the KAN gene in the middle and AIP1 homologous sequence on the ends. The primers used for the PCR were: forward: 5′-agggcgaagactctgcgttgtgggagaaggtcgtgataactaacagctgctgggattacacatgg-3′ and reverse: 5′-cctcttcaatttcctcttcgtttgctcccttttcagcaggacttcgcatctgggcagatgatgtc-3′. The sequences in bold are homologous to the AIP1 gene, whereas the rest of the primers are homologous to the plasmid. PCR was performed using an Invitrogen Platinum® TaqDNA Polymerase High Fidelity kit with 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 3 min at 68 °C to generate an ∼1500-bp fragment. Yield was approximated by visualization on an agarose gel. pCENWT was transformed with 500 ng of fragment via lithium acetate, and transformants were selected on YPD Geneticin plates. pCENWT strain is a trp1,ura3–52 haploid cell in which the chromosomal ACT1 gene has been disrupted by replacement of the coding sequence with the LEU2 gene, and the WT actin gene and its promoter are on a centromeric plasmid containing the URA3 gene. Homologous recombination of the fragment into the chromosome deleted ∼1200 bp of the AIP1 gene. Colonies were patched on YPD, and correct insertion into the chromosome was confirmed by PCR of the genomic DNA using a forward primer homologous to sequence upstream from AIP1 and a reverse primer homologous to the KAN gene. Conditions for PCR were the same as above, and the primers used were: forward: 5′-tggtcatggctcttcggtagtcac-3′ and reverse: 5′-gtattctgggcctccatgtcgctgg-3′. Using the pCENWT Δaip1 strain as the host, WT yeast actin or the various mutant actins housed on pRS314 plasmids, which contain the coding sequence for the actin and promoter region in addition to the TRP1 gene, were transformed into this haploid yeast strain by lithium acetate. Transformants were selected on tryptophan-deficient medium and then subjected to plasmid shuffling to eliminate the WT actin gene (16.McKane M. Wen K.K. Meyer A. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29916-29928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Mutant actins were purified from lysates of the mutant yeast cells in a procedure that includes DNase I affinity chromatography and DE52 DEAE-cellulose chromatography (20.Cook R.K. Blake W.T. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9430-9436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After purification from cell lysates, actin was subjected to a polymerization/depolymerization step, including centrifugation in a Beckman TLA 100.2 rotor at 80,000 rpm for 1 h to remove denatured protein and actin oligomers, which might otherwise act as nuclei. The purified actins, stored at 4 °C in G-buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP), were used within 4 days. For each experiment, WT yeast actin was also prepared as a purification and experimental control. Yeast cofilin was purified as described previously (21.Ojala P.J. Paavilainen V. Lappalainen P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15562-15569Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thermal Denaturation—The apparent melting temperatures for WT and mutant actins were determined by CD as described previously (22.Chen X. Cook R.K. Rubenstein P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1185-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, the ellipticity of sample of 1 μm actin in G-buffer was monitored at 222 nm in an AVIV 62 DS spectropolarimeter as the sample was heated at a constant rate of l°C/min over a temperature range extending from 25 °C to 85 °C. Data were fitted to a two-state model, and the apparent Tm value was determined by fitting the data to the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation to approximate the temperature at which 50% of the actin was denatured. Nucleotide Exchange—To determine the half time of the nucleotide exchange ϵ-ATP was used as described previously (23.Yao X. Nguyen V. Wriggers W. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22875-22882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Excess ATP was removed from 3 μm samples of G-actin with Micro Bio-Spin 6 columns (Bio-Rad). The samples were then incubated with ϵ-ATP at a final concentration 1.25 mm for 2 h at 4 °C. After incubation, excess ϵ-ATP was removed with Micro Bio-Spin 6 columns (Bio-Rad). The decrease of the ϵ-ATP fluorescence signal was monitored after addition of 100 μm ATP in a Fluorolog fluorescence spectrometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon Inc.) with excitation set at 340 nm and emission set at 410 nm. Exchange half times were determined by fitting the data with BioKine Version 3.1 (Bio Logic, France). Binding of G-actin to Cofilin—G-actin samples were labeled with N-(1-pyrenyl)maleimide (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C. N-(1-Pyrenyl)maleimide was added in a slight excess so that final concentration is 1.1 pyrene to 1 actin. Before labeling dithiothreitol was removed with Micro Bio-Spin 6 columns. After labeling, excess pyrene was removed with Micro Bio-Spin 6 columns. Cofilin was titrated into samples of 1 μm pyrene-labeled G-actin, and the increase in pyrene signal was monitored with a Fluorolog fluorescence spectrometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon Inc.) with excitation set at 344 nm and emission set at 365 nm. The experiments were done in G-buffer that contained 50 mm KCl. The binding data were analyzed in Excel and fitted to Equation 1, f=fi[A]+[C]+Kd—([A]+[C]+Kd)2—4[A][C]2(Eq. 1) where f is the observed fluorescence minus the fluorescence of G-actin alone, fi is the molar fluorescence intensity obtained with best fit in Excel, [A] is the actin concentration, [C] is the cofilin concentration, and Kd is the dissociation constant. Actin Polymerization Assays—Polymerization was induced by the addition of F-salts, 2 mm MgCl2 and 50 mm KCl, to a 5 μm G-actin sample in a total volume of 120 μl. Polymerization was monitored at 25 °C by following the increase in light scattering of the sample in a thermostatted microcuvette in a Fluoro-Max-3 fluorescence spectrometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon Inc.) with both excitation and emission wavelengths set at 360 nm. Electron Microscopy and Actin Filament Length Measurement—For actin filament visualization, 2 μl of samples of 5 μm F-actin was deposited on carbon-coated Formvar grids and negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate. Samples were observed with a JEOL JEM-1230 transmission electron microscope at the University of Iowa Central Microscopy Research Facilities, and images were recorded with a Gatan UltraScan 1000 2 × 2k charge-coupled device camera. For each sample, the lengths of more than 100 filaments were determined using NIH ImageJ software. Phosphate Release Assay—EnzChek® Phosphate Assay Kit from Molecular Probes was used as described previously (24.Yao X. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25598-25604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To determine if mutant F-actins bound cofilin, a cosedimentation assay with few modifications was used (25.Rodal A.A. Tetreault J.W. Lappalainen P. Drubin D.G. Amberg D.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1251-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). G-actin was centrifuged for 30 min at 80,000 rpm at 4 °C in a TLA 100.2 rotor (Beckman Instruments) to remove residual actin filament seeds. 60 μl of 5 μm G-actin was polymerized with the addition of F-salts. After 30 min, when polymerization had reached steady state, cofilin was added at an actin:cofilin ratio of 1:1. After 10 min the samples were centrifuged in a TLA 100 rotor for 20 min at 80,000 rpm at 25 °C, conditions sufficient to pellet F-actin. Pellets were resuspended in 60 μl of F-buffer, and equal amounts of supernatant and pellet fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 12% acrylamide gels. Protein bands were visualized with Coomassie Blue staining and analyzed by densitometry. For observation of cell structures, images were collected with a Zeiss Axioskop 2 Plus microscope using a Plan-Apochromat 100 × 1.4 numerical aperture objective lens and a Spot RT cooled charge-coupled device camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI). Camera control and image enhancement were performed using MetaMorph Version 4.5 software (Universal Image Corp., Downingtown, PA). For the analysis of actin filament and mitochondrial morphology, ∼30 z-sections were obtained at 0.2-μm intervals through the entire cell. Out-of-focus light was removed by two-dimensional deconvolution using MetaMorph software, and further image processing, stacking of the series of images to a two-dimensional image was done with the NIH ImageJ. All cellular statistical analysis was based on cell counts of more than 100 for each sample. Mitochondria in living cells were visualized using a fusion protein in which GFP was fused to the mitochondrial signal sequence of citrate synthase as described previously (26.Bryan K.E. Wen K.K. Zhu M. Rendtorff N.D. Feldkamp M. Tranebjaerg L. Friderici K.H. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20129-20139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The construct used for expression of this protein was provided by Dr. Liza A. Pon, Columbia University, New York, NY (27.Fehrenbacher K.L. Yang H.C. Gay A.C. Huckaba T.M. Pon L.A. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1996-2004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The actin cytoskeleton was visualized by fluorescence microscopy after staining fixed cells with rhodamine-phalloidin as described previously (19.McKane M. Wen K.K. Boldogh I.R. Ramcharan S. Pon L.A. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36494-36501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Vacuoles were observed following exposure of the cells to the dye FM 4–64 as described previously (28.Vida T.A. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 779-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar) and nuclear and mitochondrial DNAs were visualized following staining of the cells with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole as described previously (28.Vida T.A. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 779-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). Effects of Mutations in Vivo—To test for the effects of altering these hypothetical ionic interactions on actin function in vivo, we first assessed how the mutations in yeast actin altered growth characteristics of the cells under different growth conditions. Fig. 2A shows that all three of the mutant actins led to severely depressed extents of growth leveling off at ∼30% of the maximum level achieved by WT cells. Defects of this magnitude caused by actin mutations are often associated with mitochondria malfunction, because a functional cytoskeleton is required both for mitochondrial integrity and inheritance (27.Fehrenbacher K.L. Yang H.C. Gay A.C. Huckaba T.M. Pon L.A. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1996-2004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 29.Yang H.C. Simon V. Swayne T.C. Pon L. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 333-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Boldogh I.R. Fehrenbacher K.L. Yang H.C. Pon L.A. Gene (Amst.). 2005; 354: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To examine this possibility, we assessed the ability of the mutant cells to grow on glycerol as a sole carbon source. Yeast requires mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase to ultimately convert the glycerol to dihydroxyacetone phosphate for use in glycolysis, and mitochondrial malfunction will interfere with this reaction (31.Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 13: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 32.Gancedo C. Gancedo J.M. Sols A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1968; 5: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Fig. 2B shows that all three mutants, even the predicted hyperstable A167E mutant, fail to grow on glycerol as a fuel source. To gain insight into the nature of the mitochondrial malfunction, we transfected the cells with a plasmid carrying GFP to which was fused the citrate synthase mitochondrial targeting sequence (27.Fehrenbacher K.L. Yang H.C. Gay A.C. Huckaba T.M. Pon L.A. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1996-2004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Supplemental Fig. S1 shows that ∼90% of the GFP-expressing WT cells displayed normal tubular mitochondrial structures. Only ∼55–65% of the three mutant cells displayed GFP-fluorescent structures compared with ∼85% of WT cells, possibly due to mitochondrial structural defects. For the A167E and A167R cells, only about a third of the fluorescent cells displayed normal looking tubular mitochondrial structures. The rest of the cells either displayed aggregated structures or diffused fluorescence. Almost all of the fluorescent D275R cells contained brightly fluorescent dots instead of tubular structures indicative of severe mitochondrial disruption. Staining of the fixed cells with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to visualize DNA showed that mitochondrial DNA was absent in virtually all of the Ala-167 mutants and showed aggregation in ∼75% of the D275R cells (supplemental Fig. S2). Nuclear segregation defects were seen in ∼10% of all three mutant cells. All three of the mutants exhibit varying degrees of temperature-sensitive growth on YPD medium (supplemental Fig. S3), and A167E also showed defective growth in hyperosmolar medium indicative of an impaired actin cytoskeleton (33.Chowdhury S. Smith K.W. Gustin M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 34.Slaninova I. Sestak S. Svoboda A. Farkas V. Arch.

Finally, abnormal actin cytoskeletal patterns were observed with rhodamine-phalloidin staining in all three mutants (supplemental Fig. S5). Effects of Mutations on G-actin Properties—Although we wished to use mutagenesis to examine the role of these hypothetical ionic bonds in stabilization of actin monomer-monomer interactions in the filament, it is possible that the mutations could have disruptive effects on the integrity of the monomer structure per se. We therefore assessed the effects of the mutations on G-actin thermostability and nucleotide exchange rates. We first used CD to measure the unfolding of actin as a function of temperature (Table 1). The A167E and A167R mutants exhibited apparent melting temperatures (Tm) within 1 degree of the WT Tm while the Tm of the D275R mutant was 8 °C lower than that of WT actin. However, it was stable within the temperature range in which the functional studies described below were performed. Because the nucleotide that is bound between subdomains 2 and 4 has a role in maintaining conformational integrity and stability of the monomer, we assessed the effects of the mutations on the rate of exchange of bound fluorescent ϵ-ATP from the actin in the presence of a vast excess of ATP. The A167E mutation caused a slower rate of exchange than WT actin, whereas the A167R and D275R mutations resulted in an increased rate of exchange (Table 1). However, the rates were within a factor of two of that of WT actin indicating that the overall effects of the mutations on actin structure were relatively small. Finally, we assessed the ability of the actin monomer binding protein cofilin to bind to WT and A167E, A167R, and D275R ATP-G-actins. Table 1 shows that the Kd of the cofilin for all of the ATP-G-actins is in the range of 1.2–2 μm, again suggesting no significant alteration of actin monomer conformation by the mutation.TABLE 1Effects of mutations on monomer thermostability, nucleotide exchange and binding to cofilin The number of experiments performed is indicated in parenthesis.

https://openalex.org/W2106492919,"Bromelain isoinhibitor (bromein), a cysteine proteinase inhibitor from pineapple stem, has a unique double-chain structure. The bromein precursor protein includes three homologous inhibitor domains, each containing an interchain peptide between the light and heavy chains. The interchain peptide in the single-chain precursor is immediately processed by bromelain, a target proteinase. In the present study, to clarify the essential inhibitory site of bromein, we constructed 44 kinds of site-directed and deletion mutants and investigated the inhibitory activity of each toward bromelain. As a result, the complete chemical structure of Leu<sup>13</sup> in the light chain was revealed to be essential for inhibition. Pro<sup>12</sup> prior to the leucine residue was also involved in the inhibitory activity and would control the location of the leucine side chain by the fixed ϕ dihedral angle of proline. Furthermore, the five-residue length of the interchain peptide was strictly required for the inhibitory activity. On the other hand, no inhibitory activity against bromelain was observed by the substitution of proline for the N terminus residue Thr<sup>15</sup> of the interchain peptide. In summary, these mutational analyses of bromein demonstrated that the appropriate position and conformation of Leu<sup>13</sup> are absolutely crucial for bromelain inhibition."
