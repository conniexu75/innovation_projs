https://openalex.org/W2064943738,Increases in aerosol concentrations over the oceans may increase the amount of low-level cloudiness through a reduction in drizzle—a process that regulates the liquid-water content and the energetics of shallow marine clouds. The resulting increase in the global albedo would be in addition to the increase due to enhancement in reflectivity associated with a decrease in droplet size and would contribute to a cooling of the earth's surface.
https://openalex.org/W2081363866,"Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics methods have been used to study the shearing behavior of an atomic fluid between two plane-parallel solid surfaces having the face-centered cubic (100) structure. A distorted, face-centered cubic solid can form epitaxially between surfaces that are separated by distances of one to five atomic diameters. Under these conditions a critical stress must be overcome to initiate sliding of the surfaces over one another at fixed separation, temperature, and chemical potential. As sliding begins, a layer of solid exits the space between the surfaces and the remaining layers become fluid."
https://openalex.org/W2074883260,"The only known case of an avian digestive system with active foregut fermentation is reported for the hoatzin (Opisthocomus hoazin), one of the world's few obligate folivorous (leaf-eating) birds. Hoatzins are one of the smallest endotherms with this form of digestion. Foregut fermentation in a flying bird may be explained by increased digestive efficiency by selection of highly fermentable and extremely patchy resources, coupled with microbial nutritional products and secondary compound detoxification. This unexpected digestive system gives a new perspective to the understanding of size limitations of vertebrate herbivores and to the evolution of foregut fermentation."
https://openalex.org/W2048361468,"A near-optimum parallel planarization algorithm is presented. The planarization algorithm, which is designed to embed a graph on a plane, uses a large number of simple processing elements called neurons. The proposed system, composed of an N x N neural network array (where N is the number of vertices), not only generates a near-maximal planar subgraph from a nonplanar graph or a planar graph but also embeds the subgraph on a single plane within 0(1) time. The algorithm can be used in multiple-layer problems such as designing printed circuit boards and routing very-large-scale integration circuits."

https://openalex.org/W2077095447,"In large asteroidal or cometary impacts on the moon, lunar surface material can be ejected with escape velocities. A few of these rocks were captured by Earth and were recently collected on the Antarctic ice. The records of noble gas isotopes and of cosmic ray-produced radionuclides in five of these meteorites reveal that they originated from at least two different impact craters on the moon. The chemical composition indicates that the impact sites were probably far from the Apollo and Luna landing sites. The duration of the moon-Earth transfer for three meteorites, which belong to the same fall event on Earth, lasted 5 to 11 million years, in contrast to a duration of less than 300,000 years for the two other meteorites. From the activities of cosmic ray-produced radionuclides, the date of fall onto the Antarctic ice sheet is calculated as 70,000 to 170,000 years ago."
https://openalex.org/W2067536447,"An analysis of high-resolution microwave images of Saturn and Saturn's individual rings is presented. Radio interferometric observations of Saturn taken at the Very Large Array in New Mexico at wavelengths of 2 and 6 centimeters reveal interesting new features in both the atmosphere and rings. The resulting maps show an increase in brightness temperature of about 3 K from equator to pole at both wavelengths, while the 6-centimeter map shows a bright band at northern mid-latitudes. The data are consistent with a radiative transfer model of the atmosphere that constrains the well-mixed, fully saturated, NH3 mixing ratio to be 1.2 × 10-4 in a region just below the NH3 clouds, while the observed bright band indicates a 25 percent relative decrease of NH3 in northern mid-latitudes. Brightness temperatures for the classical rings are presented. Ring brightness shows a variation with azimuth and is linearly polarized at an average value of about 5 percent. The variations in ring polarization suggest that at least 20 percent of the ring brightness is the result of a single scattering process."
https://openalex.org/W2042414702,"A well-preserved fragment of a heterogeneous upper mantle is present in the Cabo Ortegal Complex (Spain). This section is made of harzburgite containing a large volume of pyroxenite. The pyroxenite is concentrated in a layer 300 meters thick by 3 kilometers long. In this layer, ultramafic rocks, essentially pyroxenite (massive websterite and clinopyroxenite) and minor dunite, alternate without any rhythmicity. Part of this layering is of primary magmatic origin and possibly resulted from crystallization of magmas in dikes intruded into the host peridotite under mantle conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2084803798,"Computer networks are an integral part of the rapid expansion of computing. Their emergence depends both on evolving communication technologies, such as packet-switching and satellites, and on diverse experiments and innovations in the software tools that exploit communications. The tools provide computer users with facilities such as electronic mail, access to remote computers, and electronic bulletin boards. Scientists can both adapt and extend tools to meet the communication needs of their work, and several networks are developing to serve particular scientific communities."

Within the next decade, the use of computers in the entire spectrum of manufacturing applications, from computer-aided design to computer-aided manufacturing and robotics, is expected to be practical and economically justified. Such widespread use of computers on the factory floor awaits further advances in computer capabilities, the emergence of systems that are adaptive to the workplace, and the development of interfaces to link islands of automation and to allow effective user communications."
https://openalex.org/W1976719307,"Abstract : The rapid evolution of computer applications in scientific instrumentation is briefly traced from early data processing to modern computer-based instruments. Computer and interface developments have both contributed to this evolution. The form of the computer used strongly affects the ease of instrument operation and the degree of functional adaptability. Probable pathways toward instruments with increased 'intelligence' include the development and intelligent control of powerful 'multidimensional' instruments, the implementation of hierarchical computer networks and multiprocessor controllers, and the simplification of programming. The importance of the scientist's involvement in these developments is discussed. (Author)"

Placing a telephone callsomething Americans do more than three-quarters of a billion times per day-is a simple task. But the nationwide telecommunications network that makes this possible is the largest and flexible, enabling it to provide a wide variety of information-age telecommunications services. The facilities of the nationwide network include 22,000 switching centers and over 1 billion miles of transmission paths. Its trillions of interrelated parts, all designed to interact compatibly and reliably on user command, can promptly complete any of 6 x 10'' possible connections. Overall, the network repreSummary. A stream of new technologies has transformed the nationwide telecommunications network into the world's largest and most sophisticated information handling system. Computers and software have made the network intelligent and allow it to be programmed with great flexibility to bring a myriad of new services to homes and offices."

https://openalex.org/W1991088150,"Experiments in which high-energy neutrinos were used as projectiles have made substantial contributions to our understanding of both weak and strong interactions, as well as the structure of hadrons. This article offers some illustrations. It recalls the discovery of the neutral weak current and some experiments on its nature. The sections on charged-current inclusive scattering recall the important role of these experiments in the understanding of the quark structure of the nucleon and the validity of quantum chromodynamics. The section on dimuon production illustrates the role of neutrino experiments in establishing the Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani current as well as the measurement of the structure function of the strange quark in the nucleon."
