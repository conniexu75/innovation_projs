The relative rate of synthesis of four egg white proteins (ovalbumin, conalbumin, ovomucoid, and lysozyme) was measured by culturing magnum explants with radioactive amino acids followed by specific immunoprecipitation of each of the egg white proteins. Induction of these proteins was studied as a function of time, hormonal dose, and hormonal combination. A combination of estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone was found which would induce the relative rate of synthesis of each of the four egg white proteins to a level that closely approximates that observed in laying hens; this combination also promotes maximal magnum growth. The synthesis of these proteins is not strictly coordinated, since the rate of synthesis of one or more of these proteins can change relative to the others, although they are all synthesized in the same cell. Noncoordinate protein synthesis is exemplified by the changing ratio of conalbumin to ovalbumin synthesis during both primary and secondary stimulation with estrogen. The ratio of synthesis of these two proteins also changes as a function of the dosage of hormone administered. Furthermore, different combinations of hormones can produce noncoordinate synthesis; for example, the synthesis of ovomucoid and conalbumin is increased relative to ovalbumin when either progesterone or testosterone are administered along with estrogen. The most likely explanation for the change in the ratio of ovalbumin to conalbumin synthesis observed during hormonal stimulation is the 2-fold difference in the rates of degradation of their mRNAs. In contrast, changes in mRNA synthesis or activation best account for the preferential induction of conalbumin synthesis by low doses of estrogen, and the increased rates of conalbumin and ovomucoid synthesis which are produced by supplementing estrogen with either progesterone or testosterone. The results suggest that a single regulatory site for the control of egg white synthesis is unlikely since several of these proteins appear to be under independent control."

https://openalex.org/W1518947308,"Abstract The products of mitochondrial protein synthesis in yeast have been studied by analytical gel electrophoresis. Over 60% of the total counts incorporated into mitochondria when cytoplasmic protein synthesis is blocked are associated with five proteins which are separated on acrylamide gels in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The mitochondrial products have been found to be extracted from the membrane with acidic chloroform-methanol. Under neutral conditions chloroform-methanol removes predominantly a protein which has been estimated to have a molecular weight of 7,800. This protein has been found to be present in the membrane in a polymeric form with an apparent molecular weight of 45,000. Conversion of the polymer to the low molecular weight form is achieved by treatment of mitochondrial membranes with chloroform-methanol or by depolymerization in sodium dodecyl sulfate at alkaline pH. The low molecular weight protein appears to be the major product of mitochondrial protein synthesis. Its possible role in mitochondrial biogenesis is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1500459053,"Abstract In native aspartate transcarbamylase, the binding of carbamyl phosphate and succinate perturbs certain tyrosine residues which are not perturbed under the same conditions in the isolated catalytic subunit. These results, obtained using circular dichroism difference spectroscopy, suggest that the participation of tyrosyl residues in the allosteric transition relates to homotropic interactions between substrate binding sites. Association of isolated regulatory and catalytic subunits renders tyrosyl residues inaccessible to solvent, as judged by ultraviolet absorption difference spectra. Thus, since this association process regenerates cooperativity, both the introduction of conformational constraints by subunit association and the expression of allosteric interactions by ligand binding produce tyrosyl perturbations. It is concluded, therefore, that tyrosyl residues may be involved in the stereochemical mechanism of allosteric interactions in this enzyme. Circular dichroism features which are identical for ligand binding both with aspartate transcarbamylase and with the isolated catalytic subunit are carbamyl phosphate and succinate perturbations of tryptophanyl transitions. These tryptophanyl perturbations are, therefore, inherent features of ligand binding in the presence or absence of allosteric interactions and may result from the presence of tryptophan in the active site region."

https://openalex.org/W1584609396,"Abstract Colicin Ia has been iodinated with [125I]iodine. Iodinated colicin retains biological activity and has a specific activity of approximately 106 to 107 cpm per nmole. At saturation, approximately 5000 Ia molecules are bound to an Escherichia coli cell. Scatchard plots revealed a heterogeneity in the Kassoc between colicin and receptors. The binding of 125I-Ia to biologically active receptors has an average Kassoc of approximately 1 x 1010 m-1 at 37Â°. Strains selected for resistance to colicin Ia were defective in their ability to bind colicin Ia or Ib. Furthermore, both colicins competed for the binding of 125I-Ia to bacterial receptors. These data confirm previous results suggesting that colicins Ia and Ib adsorb to common receptors. Colicinogenic cells were found to be indistinguishable from noncolicinogenic cells in both the amount of colicin adsorbed per cell and Kassoc. This suggests that mechanism of colicin immunity does not involve an alteration in the binding reaction."

When phospholipid synthesis was assayed by using 32Pi, some net synthesis does occur, but the majority of the incorporation is a consequence of rapid breakdown and resynthesis (turnover) of phosphatidylethanolamine, normally a stable component of the cell envelope."

https://openalex.org/W2020993761,"IN investigations of physiological factors affecting the selection of human hosts for feeding by the mosquito Anopheles gambiae (species A from Nkolmekok2, Cameroons), pairs of subjects were chosen who contrasted in ABO blood group status. The experiments were conducted under conditions which simulated as closely as possible those under which females of A. gambiae normally bite. Because illumination was limited to a dim red light, counting how many of the twenty female insects used took a blood meal from the arm of a particular host proved difficult. We found, however, that even if only a very small blood meal was taken during the ten minutes' testing time, the ABO status of this meal could be reliably established within an hour, by extracting the blood from the mosquito's gut and performing direct agglutination tests on it with anti-A and anti-B sera. In over a hundred blind tests there were only two cases of possible error."

The identification of those acceptor species containing adenosine residues modified with threonine was facilitated by a radioactive threonine label in the tRNA. The analytical procedure depended upon the increased affinity for benzoylated DEAE-cellulose of a tRNA after aminoacylation followed by N-phenoxyacetylation. Threonine-containing nucleosides were found in tRNA species that accept isoleucine, threonine, lysine, methionine, asparagine, arginine, serine, and leucine. All of these tRNA species, except leucine, recognize codons that begin with adenine."

https://openalex.org/W1673029733,"Abstract A spontaneous prototrophic mutation in the hisD gene of Salmonella typhimurium, hisD2352, alters the COOH-terminal amino acid sequence of the hisD gene product, histidinol dehydrogenase. The wild type sequence, [see PDF for sequence] has been replaced by the sequence -Lys-Ala-Ser-Leu-Thr in the hisD2352 dehydrogenase. The permuted amino acid sequence may be explained if hisD2352 is a two-base deletion near the end of the hisD gene. A unique nucleotide sequence may be written for this region which indicates that the normal termination signal of the hisD gene is UAA or UGA. This single termination codon is followed by a cytosine residue, which constitutes part of an intercistronic region between the hisD and hisC genes."
https://openalex.org/W2124882814,"Abstract Papaya lysozyme, by virtue of its ability to react with a variety of sulfhydryl reagents, has been shown to have four âSH groups per molecule. These groups are available for reaction in the native protein but react much more rapidly when denaturants are present. By stepwise titration of the âSH groups with monovalent mercurials, active derivatives of the enzyme can be prepared with up to three âSH groups blocked. When more than three groups are blocked activity falls off sharply. Evidence from mercaptide exchange experiments and from Hg2+ papaya lysozyme derivatives indicate that one sulfhydryl group is essential for activity. Titration of the enzyme âSH groups was associated with increased lability to heat and decreased solubility. A simplification of the method for isolation of papaya lysozyme is described, as well as a method for isolation of N-acetyl-d-glucosamine oligosaccharides. Tri-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine was found to be a convenient substrate for study of papaya lysozyme activity."

In the ideal chemostat type the culture is completely mixed, whereas in the ideal plug-flow type it flows through the vessel without mixing. Both types of system are used, but the choice seems arbitrary although recent theory suggests that the chemostat system is better1. In view of the large capital sums now being invested in sewage disposal, the arbitrary design of the activated sludge process2 calls for urgent investigation. A case in point is the effect of protozoa on the process."
