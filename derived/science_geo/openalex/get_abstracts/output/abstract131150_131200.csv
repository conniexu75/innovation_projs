Immediately after recruitment, the single polypeptide FLICE zymogen is proteolytically processed to the active dimeric species composed of large and small catalytic subunits. Since all caspases cleave their substrates after Asp residues and are themselves processed from the single-chain zymogen to the two-chain active enzyme by cleavage at internal Asp residues, it follows that an upstream caspase can process a downstream zymogen. However, since FLICE represents the most apical caspase in the Fas pathway, its mode of activation has been enigmatic. We hypothesized that the FLICE zymogen possesses intrinsic enzymatic activity such that when approximated, it autoprocesses to the active protease. Support for this was provided by (i) the synthesis of chimeric Fpk3FLICE molecules that can be oligomerizedin vivo by the synthetic cell-permeable dimerizer FK1012H2. Cells transfected with Fpk3FLICE underwent apoptosis after exposure to FK1012H2; (ii) the creation of a nonprocessable zymogen form of FLICE that retained low but detectable protease activity.

Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a cell deletion mechanism that is critical to metazoan survival (1Steller H.

The cell death machinery is conserved throughout evolution and is composed of several distinct parts including effectors, inhibitors, and activators (1Steller H.

Mammalian cysteine proteases (designated caspase for cysteine aspartic acid-specific protease) related to the Caenorhabditis elegans cell death gene CED-3 represent the effector components of the apoptotic machinery participating in a regulated proteolytic cascade (4Martin S.

Immediately after recruitment, the single polypeptide FLICE zymogen is proteolytically processed to the active dimeric species composed of large and small catalytic subunits that amplify the apoptotic signal by activating other downstream caspases (6Muzio M.

We hypothesized that the FLICE zymogen possesses intrinsic enzymatic activity such that when approximated, it autoprocesses to the active protease. Support for this model was provided by two independent approaches: (i) the synthesis of chimeric Fpk3FLICE molecules that can be oligomerized in vivo by the synthetic cell-permeable dimerizer FK1012H2. Cells transfected with Fpk3FLICE underwent apoptosis after exposure to FK1012H2; (ii) the creation of a nonprocessable zymogen form of FLICE that retained low but detectable protease activity. MFpk3Eu vector containing a myristoylation site, three copies of Fpk in tandem and a hemagglutinin epitope tag (HA) was originally made by D. Spencer (Baylor College of Medicine). Fpk is a double mutant of FKBP12 where residues 89 and 90 have been mutated from GI to PK (14Spencer D. Wandless T. Schreiber S. Crabtree G. Science. 1993; 262: 1019-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain of FLICE (encoding Ser-217 to Asp-479) was obtained by polymerase chain reaction and sub-cloned in-frame between the last Fpk and the epitope tag at the SalI site in MFpk3Eu. The same catalytic domain of a mutant version of FLICE, in which Cys-360 was replaced by Ser, was similarly cloned. For production of recombinant purified proteins, the catalytic domain of FLICE or mutant versions of FLICE in which the catalytic Cys-360 was replaced by Ser and/or the cleavage sites Asp-374 and Asp-384 were replaced by Ala, were obtained by polymerase chain reaction and sub-cloned into the pET15b expression vector (Novagen). The proteins were expressed in the BL21 pLysS Escherichia coli strain and purified using the QIAexpress Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Human embryonic kidney 293 and HeLa cells were cultured as described previously. Cell death assays were performed as described (9Chinnaiyan A. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar). Hela cells were transfected using the lipofectAMINE procedure (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 293 cells were transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation. For immunoblotting analysis, cells (5 × 105) were lysed in 50 μl of buffer (50 mm KCl, 50 mm HEPES, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, protease inhibitor mixture) followed by three cycles of freeze thaw. The membrane-rich fraction was pelleted, resuspended in 8 murea and, after boiling in sample buffer, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with anti-HA antibody. For coimmunoprecipitation analysis, cells (2 × 106) were lysed in 1 ml of buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris, 20 mm HEPES, protease inhibitor mixture) and incubated either with anti-HA 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutinin; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; BIO-DEVD-AMK, N-(biotinyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-[(2,6-dimethylbenzoyl)oxy]methyl ketone; -CMK, chloromethyl ketone; -FMK, fluoromethyl ketone; -AFC, 7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin; Z-, carbobenoxy. antibodies or anti-FLICE (small subunit-specific) rabbit antiserum. Immune complexes were precipitated by the addition of protein G-Sepharose (Sigma). After extensive washing, the Sepharose beads were boiled in sample buffer, and the eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody. The enzymatic reaction was carried out at 37 °C in 20 mmPIPES, 0.1 mm substrate, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol (fresh), 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, and 10% sucrose, pH 7.2. The initial rates of hydrolysis were measured by release of AFC (7-amino-4-methyl cou marin) from the substrate by the enzymes at appropriate emission and excitation wavelengths using a Perkin-Elmer LS50B fluorimeter equipped with a thermostated plate reader. Titrations of wild type and FLICE-DD [arrow] AA were carried out by preincubating the enzyme with varying concentrations of Z-DEVD-FMK or CrmA in assay buffer for 30 min at room temperature. The inhibitor was added at concentrations spanning from 0 to significantly above the concentration of active enzyme. After the preincubation, Z-DEVD-AFC was added in assay buffer to a final substrate concentration of 0.1 mm. The relative amount of uninhibited enzyme was evaluated from the initial rates of hydrolysis of the substrate as described above, and the concentration of active enzyme was calculated by extrapolating data points to their intersection with the x axis. The caspase-8 concentration used in the titration assays were 0.2 micromolar for the native enzyme and 20 micromolar for the DD → AA mutant. 100 ng of purified proteins were incubated with or without N-(biotinyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-[(2,6-dimethylbenzoyl)oxy]methyl ketone (BIO-DEVD-AMK) (15Clayton L. Ghendler Y. Mizoguchi E. Patch R. Ocain T. Orth K. Bhan A. Dixit V. Reinherz E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2282-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) at a concentration of 0.5 μm in a final volume of 50 μl of buffer (0.1% CHAPS, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5) for 15 min at 25 °C. For competition experiments, increasing amounts of a nonbiotinylated version of the DEVD tetrapeptide (DEVD-CMK; Bachem) were added to the reaction. Samples were boiled in sample buffer in the absence of reductant, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions, blotted onto nitrocellulose, blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20, incubated with streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (ICN) in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween, washed with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.25% gelatin, 0.05% Tween 20, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and developed by ECL. Alternatively, the membrane was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-FLICE antiserum specific for the small catalytic subunit. To determine if FLICE oligomerization in vivo could result in activation, chimeric FpkFLICE expression constructs were engineered. Fpk (molecular mass 12 kDa), a double mutant of FKBP (FK binding protein FK506) (16Yang D. Rosen M.K. Schreiber S.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 819-820Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar) contains a single binding site for the cell-permeable immunosuppressive drug FK506. The FKBP-FK506 complex is a potent inhibitor of calcineurin, a protein phosphatase that plays a key role in signaling. An FK506 dimer (FK1012H2) was previously synthesized by introducing a cross-linker into the domain of FK506 necessary for inhibition of calcineurin. FK1012H2, although unable to bind calcineurin, still retains its ability to bind and dimerize Fpk polypeptides given its bivalent nature (17Hofmann K. Tschopp J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 321Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 18Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar, 19Heguy A. Baldari C. Macchia G. Telford J.L. Melli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2605-2609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 a). To mimic recruitment of FLICE to its receptor signaling complex (11Boldin M. Goncharov T. Goltsev Y. Wallach D. Cell. 1996; 85: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2096) Google Scholar,12Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A. Kischkel F. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Ni J. Scaffidi C. Bretz J. Zhang M. Gentz R. Mann M. Krammer P. Peter M. Dixit V. Cell. 1996; 85: 817-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2714) Google Scholar), the prodomain of FLICE was substituted with a myristoylation signal followed by three tandem repeats of Fpk,(MFpk3FLICE). A catalytically inactive version was constructed by mutating the active-site Cys-360 to Ser (MFpk3FLICE(C → S)). An additional control was the construct MFpk3Eu that encoded only the myristoylation signal, three Fpk repeats in tandem, and an HA epitope tag (Fig. 1 b). To confirm the ability of FK1012H2 to induce oligomerization of Fpk3-containing proteins, human 293 cells were transiently transfected with the MFpk3Eu construct and the catalytically inactive chimera MFpk3FLICE(C → S). The MFpk3FLICE immunoprecipitates contained associating MFpk3Eu only in the presence of FK1012H2 (Fig. 1 c), confirming the validity of the dimerization approach. Ectopic expression of the catalytically active chimera MFpk3FLICE resulted in the production of a protein of predicted molecular mass (69 kDa) that was membrane-associated. The addition of the synthetic ligand FK1012H2 induced rapid disappearance of the catalytically competent MFpk3FLICE chimera. Emergence of the active subunits, however, was not detectable under these experimental conditions. As predicted, the catalytically inactive derivative was efficiently expressed, but on exposure to FK1012H2, did not undergo processing even after prolonged incubation (Fig. 2 a). We next observed if MFpk3FLICE oligomerization resulted in the expected apoptotic demise of transfected cells. Human 293 and HeLa cells were transiently transfected with MFpk3FLICE(C → S) or MFpk3FLICE expression constructs together with a reporter plasmid encoding β-galactosidase. Thirty six h after transfection, cells were left untreated or treated with 250 nm FK1012H2, stained, and analyzed by phase contrast microscopy. As shown in Fig. 2 b, oligomerization of MFpk3FLICE but not MFpk3FLICE(C → S) induced phenotypic alterations characteristic of apoptosis. Cells shrank, displayed membrane blebbing, and detached from the dish. Additionally, the apoptotic substrate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase was cleaved to its signature 85-kDa form, and genomic DNA was cleaved into characteristic internucleosomal size fragments (data not shown), both biochemical hallmarks of apoptosis. Significantly, treatment of Fpk or Fpk-FLICE(C → S)-transfected cells with higher doses of FK1012H2 for an extended period of time did not induce apoptosis (16Yang D. Rosen M.K. Schreiber S.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 819-820Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 17Hofmann K. Tschopp J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 321Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 19Heguy A. Baldari C. Macchia G.

Biol. 1996; 6: 839-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) (data not shown). After 3 h of exposure to the synthetic ligand, 50–80% MFpk3FLICE-transfected cells started blebbing, condensing, and detaching from the dish. This was completely abrogated by the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK that has previously been shown to inhibit FLICE-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2, c and d) (12Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A. Kischkel F. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Ni J. Scaffidi C. Bretz J. Zhang M. Gentz R. Mann M. Krammer P. Peter M. Dixit V. Cell. 1996; 85: 817-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2714) Google Scholar). Importantly, the monomeric form of the ligand, FK506M, did not induce apoptosis, confirming that the results observed were oligomerization-dependent (Fig. 2, c and d). These data demonstrate that specific clustering of FLICE zymogen causes apoptosis through caspase activation. We hypothesized that this activation occurs through self-processing of the clustered FLICE due to an intrinsic proteolytic activity of the zymogen. To further address this hypothesis, different recombinant versions of FLICE were generated (Fig. 3 a); as shown previously (6Muzio M. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2952-2956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 8Srinivasula S. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1996; 85: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2096) Google Scholar), overexpression of catalytically competent FLICE constructs in E. coli generated an active heterodimeric enzyme composed of large and small catalytic subunits. Enzymatically inactive FLICE (catalytic Cys-360 mutated to Ser; FLICE(C → S)) did not undergo processing, consistent with a requirement for intrinsic enzymatic activity. Importantly, an altered form of FLICE that retained the catalytic cysteine but was mutated at the internal cleavage sites (Asp-374 and Asp-384; FLICE(DD → AA)) also did not undergo auto-processing and was expressed as a single polypeptide zymogen as confirmed by protein staining and anti-FLICE immunoblot analysis (data not shown and Fig. 3 c). The processing mutant FLICE in which the catalytic cysteine was additionally inactivated (FLICE (DDCAAS)) was also expressed as a single polypeptide zymogen. These recombinant forms of FLICE were used to establish whether the zymogen did indeed possess enzymatic activity. The activity of the cleavage site mutant version FLICE(DD → AA) was determined by its ability to hydrolyze the tetrapeptide caspase substrate Z-DEVD-AFC (21Nicholson D. All A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3768) Google Scholar), and the portion of active material was determined by titration with the protein inhibitor CrmA (22Zhou Q. Snipas S. Orth K. Muzio M. Dixit V.M. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7797-7800Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 23Ray C. Black R.A. Kronheim S.R. Greenstreet T.A. Sleath P.R. Salvesen G.S. Pickup D.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 597-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar) and the covalent peptide based inhibitor, Z-DEVD-FMK (21Nicholson D. All A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3768) Google Scholar). A 100-fold more FLICE(DD → AA) was required on a protein basis to give the same rates of substrate hydrolysis as wild type FLICE (Fig. 3 b). Thus, from these results it is apparent that the bacterially expressed FLICE(DD → AA) mutant equivalent to the zymogen form has approximately 1% of the activity of the wild type enzyme. As expected, the catalytic mutant FLICE(C → S) possessed no enzymatic activity (data not shown). To interpret the enzymatic analysis, we tested the ability of the different versions of FLICE to bind the biotinylated irreversible inhibitor BIO-DEVD-AMK, which covalently binds to the active-site cysteine (15Clayton L. Ghendler Y. Mizoguchi E. Patch R. Ocain T. Orth K. Bhan A. Dixit V. Reinherz E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2282-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). As expected, the large subunit of processed native FLICE that contains the catalytic cysteine bound BIO-DEVD-AMK (Fig. 3 c). Additionally, the unprocessed cleavage site mutant (FLICE(DD → AA)) also bound BIO-DEVD-AMK, indicating that the 1% activity resides in the single chain. FLICE(DDC → AAS), as anticipated, did not show any specific binding to BIO-DEVD-AMK. The specificity of the bands indicated was confirmed by competing the binding with a nonbiotinylated version of the DEVD tetrapeptide (Fig. 3 d). Taken together, these data are consistent with a model wherein FLICE zymogen possesses intrinsic low level caspase activity that upon approximation mediated by the adapter molecule Fas-associated death domain (FADD) attains a sufficient concentration to activate the apoptosis pathway. This study provides a remarkably simple solution to the chicken and egg conundrum of how the initiating caspase (FLICE) is proteolytically processed. We are grateful to S. L. Schreiber for helpful suggestions and discussions.

This study shows that connexin channels from native tissue have selective permeabilities, partially based on pore diameter, that discriminate among cytoplasmic second messenger molecules. Permeability was assessed by measurement of selective loss/retention of tracers from liposomes containing reconstituted connexin channels. The tracers employed were tritiated cyclic nucleotides and a series of oligomaltosaccharides derivatized with a small uncharged fluorescent moiety. The data define different size cut-off limits for permeability through homomeric connexin-32 channels and through heteromeric connexin-32/connexin-26 channels. Connexin-26 contributes to a narrowed pore. Both cAMP and cGMP were permeable through the homomeric connexin-32 channels. cAMP was permeable through only a fraction of the heteromeric channels. Surprisingly, cGMP was permeable through a substantially greater fraction of the heteromeric channels than was cAMP. The data suggest that isoform stoichiometry and/or arrangement within a connexin channel determines whether cyclic nucleotides can permeate, and which ones. This is the first evidence for connexin-specific selectivity among biological signaling molecules.

The molecular basis of the intercellular signaling mediated by gap junction channels is a key question in cell biology (cf.Ref. 1Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. Cell. 1996; 84: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar). Gap junction channels are formed by connexin protein, of which there are at least 15 isoforms (2Beyer E.C. Paul D.L. Goodenough D.A. J. Membr.

The number of connexin isoforms, their tissue-specific distributions, and their differential temporal expression suggest that the intercellular molecular signaling mediated by each isoform is unique. This is substantiated by the observation that genetic defects in each isoform produce distinct developmental and/or physiological defects (15Paul D.L. Curr. Opin.

Defects in connexin-32 are responsible for a human demyelinating peripheral neuropathy (17Pericak-Vance M.A. Barker D.F. Bergoffen J.A. Chance P. Cochrane S. Dahl N. Exler M.C. Fain P.R.

Both connexins seem to act as tumor suppressors (19Yamasaki H. Mesnil M. Omori Y. Mironov N. Krutovskikh V. Mutat. Res. 1995; 333: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 20Lee S.W.

Differences in molecular selectivity are likely to be responsible for key differences in molecular signaling. Understanding of intercellular signaling mediated by connexin channels will be greatly facilitated by discovery of the connexin-specific molecular selectivities and their physical bases.Most comparative studies of connexin channel permeability have documented junctional permeabilities either to ions (e.g., K+, Cl−, NH4+) much smaller than most biological signaling molecules, or to large, charged fluorescent tracers (e.g. Lucifer Yellow2−, DAPI2+) (cf. Refs.23Veenstra R.D. Wang H.-Z. Beblo D.A. Chilton M.G. Harris A.L. Beyer E.C. Brink P.R. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1156-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 24Veenstra R.D. Wang H.Z.

For the former, the observed modest selectivities are intriguing but may not reflect the selectivities among biological signaling molecules, which are larger and have more complex structures and chemistries. For the latter, it is difficult to distinguish the roles played by size and charge in selectivity, and the consequent selectivity among cytoplasmic molecules must be inferred. The fact that both ends of junctional pores are in cytoplasm has made it difficult to obtain unambiguous and detailed in situ selectivity data.A set of homologous uncharged fluorescent tracers of graded sizes was used to define the size selectivity (specifically independent of charge) of connexin channels purified from native tissue. The tracers were loaded into unilamellar liposomes, a significant fraction of which contained affinity-purified reconstituted functional connexin channels. By a transport-specific fractionation (TSF) assay (27Harris A.L. Walter A. Zimmerberg J. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 109: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 28Harris A.L. Walter A.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9212-9223Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), liposomes were separated into two populations: those with functional large channels and those without functional channels. Selective permeability among the tracers was determined by direct comparison of the tracers retained by the two populations of liposomes. The studies reported here used two connexin preparations, one containing channels of a single connexin isoform (Cx32 1The abbreviations used are: Cx, connexin; α(1→4)Glcn, α(1→4)-linked glucose linear oligomer, where n is the number of glucose units; DSP, dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate); DTSSP, dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl propionate); DTT, dithiothreitol; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; mouseCx, connexin immunopurified from mouse liver (Cx32/Cx26); PA; aminopyridyl moiety; PA-sugar; oligomaltose labeled with an aminopyridyl group; n-PA, PA-sugar wheren is the number of saccharide units; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ratCx, connexin immunopurified from rat liver (Cx32); TSF, transport-specific fractionation of liposomes. 1The abbreviations used are: Cx, connexin; α(1→4)Glcn, α(1→4)-linked glucose linear oligomer, where n is the number of glucose units; DSP, dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate); DTSSP, dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl propionate); DTT, dithiothreitol; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; mouseCx, connexin immunopurified from mouse liver (Cx32/Cx26); PA; aminopyridyl moiety; PA-sugar; oligomaltose labeled with an aminopyridyl group; n-PA, PA-sugar wheren is the number of saccharide units; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ratCx, connexin immunopurified from rat liver (Cx32); TSF, transport-specific fractionation of liposomes.; from rat liver), and one containing channels of mixed isoforms (Cx32/Cx26; from mouse liver). The results establish a connexin-specific difference in pore diameter and provide compelling evidence for heteromeric channels (channels composed of more than one isoform). These differences in selectivity were further explored using tritiated cyclic nucleotide tracers. The data show that connexin channel permeability to cyclic nucleotides, and selectivity among them, is influenced by isoform composition.DISCUSSIONDifferent connexin isoforms have been shown to intermingle within a junctional plaque (53Sosinsky G.E.

Scanning electron microscopic measurements on purified rodent hemichannel plaques failed to reveal hemichannel masses indicative of heteromeric structures (53Sosinsky G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9210-9214Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), but they may have been masked to some extent by statistical variation in the data.The cross-linking data presented here support the existence of heteromeric hemichannels in native tissue. Lateral interhemichannel linkages within the same plasma membrane are unlikely except under maximal cross-linking conditions (6Cascio M. Kumar N.M. Safarik R. Gilula N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18643-18648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) because, even in condensed junctions, the interchannel spacing is wider than the cross-linker length (12 Å) (70Baker T.S.

Moreover, lateral collisional cross-linking in other membrane protein arrays is rare (73Downer N.W. Biophys. J. 1985; 47: 285-293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 74Hoger J.H.

It is possible that interhemichannel linkages could form across the intercellular “gap” if the cross-linker could penetrate this intercellular space. The “gap” is known to be penetrated only by heavy metal stains and sucrose, which are smaller than the cross-linkers (5Unwin P.N.T. Zampighi G.A. Nature. 1980; 283: 545-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 76Makowski L. Caspar D.L.D. Phillips W.C. Goodenough D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 174: 449-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Additionally, due to the relative surface areas available for interaction, under mild cross-linking conditions intrahemichannel linkages would be favored over interhemichannel linkages (77Staros J.V. Anjaneyulu P.S.R. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 609-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).Junctional channels generally behave as two hemichannels in series from data where properties of hemichannels are directly determined and compared with those of the corresponding junctional channels (45Ebihara L. Berthoud V.M. Beyer E.C. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 1796-1803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 46Gupta V.K. Berthoud V.M. Atal N. Jarillo J.A. Barrio L.C. Beyer E.C. Invest.

A. 1996; 93: 5836-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). However, the voltage-dependent gating behavior of heterotypic junctional channels cannot always be predicted from the hemichannel properties inferred from studies of homotypic junctional channels (78White T.W. Bruzzone R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 339-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). There are no data that address whether hemichannel selectivities are altered when hemichannels form junctional channels. The fluorescent tracers developed for the present study can likely be used in conjunction with maltase inhibitors in cellular studies to directly address this issue.Inspection of the PA-sugar structures (Fig. 2) shows that with increasing oligomeric number the axial cross-section becomes more circular. Therefore, the impermeability of a tracer may not necessarily be due to a larger cross-sectional major axis, but due to a larger minor axis. Additionally, because of structural differences between the two isoforms, the packing of connexin monomers within heteromeric channels may not be radially symmetric, and may contribute to the selectivities described here. Therefore, the molecular selectivity of homomeric Cx26 channels cannot be inferred; homomeric Cx26 channels may not necessarily have narrower pores than homomeric Cx32 channels. Molecular flexibility, hydration, and other factors in permeation prevent a precise determination of the cross-sectional dimensions of the pores from these studies. However, the differential permeability of the uncharged tracers does serve as an index of relative pore diameter and permits comparison with other potential permeants and other connexin channel pores.The permeability studies with the PA-sugars do not permit discrimination between a localized size selectivity filter and a decrease in diameter along the entire pore length. The unitary conductance of Cx32 homomeric channels is less than that of homomeric Cx26 channels (79Bukauskas F.F. Elfgang C. Willecke K. Weingart R. Pflügers Arch. 1995; 429: 870-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 80Kwak B.R. Hermans M.M.P. deJonge H.R. Lohmann S.M. Jongsma H.J. Chanson M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1707-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). If the pores were right cylinders, the data would suggest that the Cx26-induced narrowing is localized, and not along the full length of the pore (i.e. the structure that produces the size selectivity does not dominate the pore conductance). However, there are data suggesting that connexin pores are not simple right cylinders (23Veenstra R.D. Wang H.-Z. Beblo D.A. Chilton M.G. Harris A.L. Beyer E.C. Brink P.R. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1156-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). If selectivity among charged permeants arises from straightforward lumenal surface charge considerations (as may be the case for voltage-dependent anion channel; Ref. 81Zambrowicz E.B. Colombini M. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 1093-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), a narrowed pore would enhance charge selectivity, due to closer approach of charged residues in the pore by permeants.Cellular and liposome studies are consistent with the data obtained here for uncharged tracers. Data from HeLa cells expressing single murine connexin isoforms probed with several nonhomologous charged tracers (Lucifer Yellow2−, DAPI2+, neurobiotinδ+, propidium2+, ethidium+) can be explained by Cx26 having an uncharged pore, and Cx32 having a cationic pore the same size or larger (25Elfgang C. Eckert R. Lichtenbergfrate H. Butterweck A. Traub O. Klein R.A. Hulser D.F. Willecke K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 805-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Other studies involving differential permeability through Cx26 and Cx32 channels support the idea of a cationic (i.e.anion-selective) Cx32 channel, but do not bear directly on limiting diameter (82Suchyna T.M. Veenstra R.D. Chilton M.G. Nicholson B.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5S (abstr.): 199AGoogle Scholar, 83Cao F. Eckert R. Elfgang C. Hulser D.F. Willecke K. Nicholson B.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5 (abstr.): 198AGoogle Scholar). A smaller diameter for Cx26 channels relative to that of Cx32 channels is supported by comparative data using Lucifer Yellow (83Cao F. Eckert R. Elfgang C. Hulser D.F. Willecke K. Nicholson B.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5 (abstr.): 198AGoogle Scholar). Studies using a different type of permeability assay and different uncharged probes (raffinose, Nycodenz, metrizamide) supports Cx26 contributing to a narrowed pore (84Bevans C. Brutyan R.A. DeMaria C. Harris A.L. Biophys. J. 1995; 68 (abstr.): A204Google Scholar, 85Bevans C.G. Harris A.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6S (abstr.): 190AGoogle Scholar). Elucidation of the structural basis for the difference in limiting dimension must await identification of the pore-lining domains of connexin channels. Recent data suggest that the first transmembrane domain contributes to the pore lumen (86Zhou X.W. Pfahnl A. Werner R. Hudder A. Llanes A. Luebke A. Dahl G. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1946-1953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 87Oh S. Bennett M.V.L. Trexler E.B. Verselis V.K. Bargiello T.A. Neuron. 1997; 19: 927-938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), but inspection of the relevant sequences is not overtly informative as to the basis of the difference in selectivity.From a biophysical perspective, it will be satisfying to obtain complementary selectivity data for homomeric Cx26 channels. A focus of the present study was to investigate the molecular selectivity (and thereby, the signaling properties) of connexin channels found in native tissue. It is possible that homomeric Cx26 could be purified from murine liver by a Cx26-specific antibody or from transfected cells (88Buehler L.K. Stauffer K.A. Gilula N.B. Kumar N.M. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 1767-1775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).Gap junction permeability to cAMP is strongly suspected in several cellular systems (89Lawrence T.S. Beers W.H. Gilula N.B. Nature. 1978; 272: 501-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 90Murray S.A. Fletcher W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1710-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 91Piccolino M. Neyton J. Gerschenfeld H.M. J. Neurosci. 1984; 4: 2477-2488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The connexins involved in those systems have not been positively identified, but the connexins studied here are not among the likely candidates (which are Cx35, Cx37, and Cx43). This is the first study to directly assess permeability to cyclic nucleotides in channels formed by Cx32 or Cx32/Cx26. The cAMP- and cGMP-permeable heteromeric channels may compose separate populations. On the other hand, some cAMP-permeable heteromeric channels may also be permeable to cGMP (i.e. the cAMP-permeable channels may be a subset, in whole or in part, of the cGMP-permeable channels). The data do not distinguish between these possibilities.It would be desirable to have a quantitative model that accounts for the relation between Cx26:Cx32 ratio and cyclic nucleotide permeability. The binomial distribution was used to calculate a possible distribution of channel stoichiometries. The corresponding permeabilities were predicted assuming that (a) stoichiometry alone controls permeability, and (b) the relation between stoichiometry and change in permeability is linear. The prediction did not obviously match the relations shown in Fig. 5, indicating that the simple assumptions above are invalid. Further analysis of this system will require explicit determination of the distribution of stoichiometries in a channel population. It is surprising that such a small change in the proportion of Cx26 present (8%) generates such a significant change in the number of channels permeable to cGMP (25%).The narrow range of Cx26:Cx32 ratios in the purified protein may be because each purification of connexin from mouse liver used tissue from 16 animals, possibly averaging over substantial individual variations in connexin-26 content. The use of channels from native tissues, although helpful in establishing the properties of in situchannels, places constraints on the range of available isoform ratios. These studies could be extended by the use of heterologous co-expression systems, using fewer animals per preparation (i.e. obtaining greater preparation-to-preparation variation in Cx26:Cx32 ratio), or by preparative fractionation of purified channels on the basis of subunit stoichiometry.The nonselective permeability of cAMP and cGMP through homomeric Cx32 channels is consistent with their wider pore dimensions established by the PA-sugar studies. Similarly, the impermeability of the nucleotides through some of the heteromeric channels does not require any basis other than a narrower pore, also established by the PA-sugar studies. The basis of the selectivity among these nucleotides by heteromeric channels, however, is not likely to be size alone (the size difference between cAMP and cGMP is minimal). The nucleotides have the same net charge, but the charge contours of the purine ring systems differ. Additionally, cAMP can form two hydrogen bonds while cGMP can form three. The selectivity is likely to derive from the different chemistries of the molecules, suggesting the presence of selective binding sites for signaling molecules within connexin pores.The isoform-dependent molecular selectivity of connexin channels in native tissues demonstrated here, particularly that among second messengers, may be physiologically important. Differential regulation of Cx26 and Cx32 expression occurs in regenerating and differentiating liver, in hepatic tumorigenesis, and in cellular growth control (20Lee S.W. Tomasetto C. Sager R. Proc.

Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 629-639PubMed Google Scholar). The data reported here suggest that dynamic regulation of junctional channel composition in vivo could effectively and efficiently modulate intercellular signaling mediated by cyclic nucleotides.Altered or disrupted permeability of cyclic nucleotides through connexin channels is likely to have important consequences. Cx32-deficient mice have increased rates of spontaneous liver tumors and greater sensitivity to carcinogens (22Temme A. Buchmann A. Gabriel H.D. Nelles E. Schwarz M. Willecke K. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 713-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In humans, genetic defects in Cx32 cause the X-linked form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (a peripheral demyelinating neuropathy) (98Bergoffen J. Scherer S.S. Wang S. Scott M.O. Bone L.J. Paul D.L. Chen K. Lensch M.W. Chance P.F. Fischbeck K.H. Science. 1993; 262: 2039-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, it has been shown recently that the full disease phenotype can be caused by a point mutation in Cx32 whose only observable effect is to narrow the pore, perhaps sufficiently to exclude cyclic nucleotides, while remaining permeable to salts (87Oh S. Bennett M.V.L. Trexler E.B. Verselis V.K. Bargiello T.A. Neuron. 1997; 19: 927-938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The distinct roles of each connexin in developmental and pathological processes may arise from differences in molecular signaling mediated, in part, by the selectivities measured and described here. The molecular basis of the intercellular signaling mediated by gap junction channels is a key question in cell biology (cf.Ref. 1Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. Cell. 1996; 84: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar). Gap junction channels are formed by connexin protein, of which there are at least 15 isoforms (2Beyer E.C. Paul D.L. Goodenough D.A. J. Membr.

Each junctional channel is composed of two anti-symmetric end-to-end hemichannels (connexons), which are hexamers of connexin (4Makowski L. Caspar D.L.D. Phillips W.C. Goodenough D.A. J.

https://openalex.org/W1987634519,"In the present study we have analyzed protein oxidation on Escherichia coli when these cells were submitted to different stress conditions such as hydrogen peroxide, superoxide-generating compounds, and iron overloading. Carbonyl groups on oxidized cell proteins were examined by Western blot immunoassay. When anaerobically grown E. coli cells were exposed to hydrogen peroxide stress, alcohol dehydrogenase E, elongation factor G, the heat shock protein DNA K, oligopeptide-binding protein A, enolase, and the outer membrane protein A were identified as the major protein targets. A similar immunostained band pattern was found when cells were shifted from anaerobic to aerobic conditions in the presence of different concentrations of iron; it is relevant to note that oxidation of outer membrane protein C, not observed in peroxide stress conditions, was clearly detected as the concentration of iron was increased in the culture media. The hydrogen peroxide stress performed under aerobic conditions affected the β-subunit of F0F1-ATPase; the rest of the oxidized protein pattern was very similar to that found for anaerobic conditions, with the exception of alcohol dehydrogenase E, a protein not synthesized aerobically. Cells submitted to superoxide stress using menadione showed a more specific pattern in which elongation factor G and the β-subunit of F0F1-ATPase were affected significantly. When paraquat was used, although the degree of oxidative damage was lower, the same two modified proteins were detected, and DNA K was also clearly damaged. Cell viability was affected to different extents depending on the type of stress exerted. The results described in this paper provide data about the in vivo effects of oxidative stress on protein oxidation and give insights into understanding how such modifications can affect cellular functions. In the present study we have analyzed protein oxidation on Escherichia coli when these cells were submitted to different stress conditions such as hydrogen peroxide, superoxide-generating compounds, and iron overloading. Carbonyl groups on oxidized cell proteins were examined by Western blot immunoassay. When anaerobically grown E. coli cells were exposed to hydrogen peroxide stress, alcohol dehydrogenase E, elongation factor G, the heat shock protein DNA K, oligopeptide-binding protein A, enolase, and the outer membrane protein A were identified as the major protein targets. A similar immunostained band pattern was found when cells were shifted from anaerobic to aerobic conditions in the presence of different concentrations of iron; it is relevant to note that oxidation of outer membrane protein C, not observed in peroxide stress conditions, was clearly detected as the concentration of iron was increased in the culture media. The hydrogen peroxide stress performed under aerobic conditions affected the β-subunit of F0F1-ATPase; the rest of the oxidized protein pattern was very similar to that found for anaerobic conditions, with the exception of alcohol dehydrogenase E, a protein not synthesized aerobically. Cells submitted to superoxide stress using menadione showed a more specific pattern in which elongation factor G and the β-subunit of F0F1-ATPase were affected significantly. When paraquat was used, although the degree of oxidative damage was lower, the same two modified proteins were detected, and DNA K was also clearly damaged. Cell viability was affected to different extents depending on the type of stress exerted. The results described in this paper provide data about the in vivo effects of oxidative stress on protein oxidation and give insights into understanding how such modifications can affect cellular functions. Oxidative damage to DNA, RNA, proteins, and cell membrane occurs when the cellular concentration of reactive oxygen species exceeds the capacity of the cell to eliminate them. Aerobic prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms have developed a set of cell defense systems to mitigate the damaging effects of reactive oxygen species (1Farr S.B. Kogoma T. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 561-585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic response systems have been studied extensively in Escherichia coli, and they are grouped in two regulons, the oxyR and the soxRS. The soxRS locus controls the response to superoxide-generating agents; the oxyR gene controls the response to hydrogen peroxide stress (2Hidalgo E. Demple B. Lin E.C.C. Lynch S. Regulation of Gene Expression in Escherichia coli. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1996: 433-450Google Scholar). The response to oxidative stress conditions overlaps with other stress responses such as heat shock, starvation, and the SOS response. Despite these defense systems, reactive oxygen species have been shown to be involved in oxidative cell damage in physiological and pathological processes such as aging (3Stadtman E.R.

Neurochem. 1994; 63: 793-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). The highly reactive hydroxyl radicals are generated by the presence of hydrogen peroxide and iron (Fenton reaction) or by superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, and a metal catalyst (Haber-Weiss reaction). These species oxidize proteins, resulting in the formation of carbonyl groups in some amino acid residues (14Stadtman E.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 797-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). These proteins can be detected by Western blotting taking advantage of the fact that the carbonyl groups generated can react with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, and this group is recognized by anti-2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) 1The abbreviations used are: DNP, 2,4-dinitrophenol, HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; EF, elongation factor; OMP, outer membrane protein. antibodies; protein carbonyls are one of the modifications described in oxidized proteins and are used successfully to measure oxidative stress in tissue, cell, and protein samples (15Shacter E. Williams J.A. Lim M. Levine R.L. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 1994; 17: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). With the aim of obtaining a better comprehension of the in vivo effects of oxidative stress, we have analyzed the protein oxidative damage and the identity of the main oxidatively damaged proteins of E. coli when these cells are submitted to stressing conditions. Hydrogen peroxide 30% solution, menadione sodium bisulfite, paraquat (methyl viologen), 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, protease from Staphylococcus aureus V8, and 3-(2-pyridil)-5,6-bis(4-phenylsulfonic acid)-1,2,4-triazine (Ferrozine®) were purchased from Sigma. Acrylamide/bisacrylamide solution was supplied by Bio-Rad. Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon Pseq) were from Millipore Corp. The chemiluminiscent detection kit (Western Light) was from Tropix. The strain used was E. coli K12, strain ECL1 (kindly provided by E. C. C. Lin). The mineral medium used consisted of 34 mmNaH2PO4, 64 mmK2HPO4, 20 mm(NH4)2SO4, 1 μmFeSO4, 0.1 mm MgSO4, and 10 μm CaCl2. Glucose was added to a 20 mm final concentration. Growth of cells was carried out in bottles filled to the top with culture medium and stirred with a magnet (anaerobic cultures) or in 200-ml Erlenmeyer flasks, 1/10 filled and aerated in a rotary shaker at 250 rpm (aerobic cultures). All cultures were grown at 37 °C to an A420 nm of 1 and 0.5 in anaerobic and aerobic conditions, respectively. To calculate cell viability, appropriate dilutions of the cultures were plated on LB medium (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl, and 1.5% agar), incubated at 37 °C, and colony-forming units determined. The level of cell viability of stressed cultures was determined with reference to control cultures taken at the same absorbance. Hydrogen peroxide was added to the cultures at final concentrations of 0.5, 1, and 2 mm. Menadione and paraquat were added to aerobic cultures to a final concentration of 20 mm and treated for 1 h. Ferrozine was added to the aerobic cultures at 0.2 and 0.4 mm final concentration. For shifts from anaerobic to aerobic conditions, cultures were taken at the end of the exponential phase, diluted 10-fold, and incubated as described before. Iron (as ammonium ferrous sulfate) was supplemented at 40 and 100 μm. Samples were harvested at a A420 nm of 0.5. One-ml samples were taken from the cultures at the indicated times, centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 3 min, and resuspended in 50 μl of 10 mmHEPES buffer, pH 7, containing 6% SDS and heated at 100 °C for 3 min. The protein content was measured using the Bio-Rad Dc protein assay for SDS-containing samples. Derivatization with dinitrophenylhydrazine was performed as published (15Shacter E. Williams J.A. Lim M. Levine R.L. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 1994; 17: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). These samples were ready to apply to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or to HPLC gel filtration chromatography. Alcohol dehydrogenase activity was determined according to the method described by McPhedran et al. (16McPhedran P. Sommer B. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1961; 81: 852-857Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Enolase was assayed according to the method of Maitra and Lobo (17Maitra P.K. Lobo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 475-488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATPase activity was measured using the method of Pullmanet al. (18Pullman M.E. Penefsky H.S. Datta A. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 3322-3328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All of these activities were determined in crude extracts obtained by ballistic disintegration (19Schnaitman C.A. Murray R.G.E. Manual of Methods for General Bacteriology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1981: 52-64Google Scholar). Ultrasonic disintegration was discarded because unspecific protein oxidation was observed. For analytical purposes cell extracts containing 10 μg of protein were applied to 5% stacking gel and separated in a 9% resolving gel. Electrophoresis was performed according to the denaturing discontinuous buffer system of Laemmli (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). Proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (21Fairbanks G. Steck T.L. Wallach D.F.H. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 2606-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (6175) Google Scholar). Preparative electrophoresis was carried out in a model 491 PrepCell (Bio-Rad) using a gel tube with a 28-mm inner diameter. A volume of 6 ml of dinitrophenylhydrazine-derivatized cell extracts containing 20 mg of total protein was loaded into a 4% stacking gel (2 cm high) and separated in a resolving gel (8 cm high) in which the acrylamide concentration was varied according to the desired molecular weight interval resolution. Electrophoresis was also conducted according to the Laemmli system at a constant current of 75 mA until the dye front (unbound dinitrophenylhydrazine) reached the bottom of the gel. Subsequently, the elution chamber outlet was connected to a fraction collector by means of a peristaltic pump with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions of 3 ml were collected, and 15 μl of each was analyzed by Western blotting to locate DNP-derivatized proteins. Fractions stored at −20 °C could be analyzed several times without loss of signal in the Western blot immunoassay. Proteins separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a semidry system. For immunodetection we followed the instructions outlined in the Tropix kit. The anti-DNP antibody was supplied by DAKO (V401) and used at a 1/2,000 dilution. The secondary antibody was a goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Tropix) used at a 1/25,000 dilution. Proteins of interest (10 μg) were subjected to limited proteolysis for 30 min according to the method of Cleveland et al. (22Cleveland D.W. Fischer S.G. Kirschner M.W. Laemmli U.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1102-1106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with either 0.5 μg of S. aureus V8 protease or 0.1 μg of subtilisin at 25 °C for 30 min. Peptides were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in duplicate gels, blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and analyzed either by Western blotting as described previously or stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Selected anti-DNP immunostained peptide bands were excised from Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained membrane and sequenced. Proteins of interest were identified by Edman degradation (10–15 cycles) using a Beckman LF3000 sequencer equipped with a phenylthiohydantoin derivative analyzer (System Gold, Beckman). To eliminate any neighboring bands, samples of whole protein (obtained by preparative electrophoresis) or peptide (obtained after limited proteolysis) were electrophoresed and electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. In the case of oxidized proteins, the peptide bands that gave a clear signal after anti-DNP immunostain assay were chosen to assess the identity of these proteins further. The stained band was sliced out of the membrane and washed three times in Milli-Q water to reduce to background levels of Tris and glycine from electrophoresis and electroblotting steps. The protein carbonyl content of crude extracts and purified proteins was measured according to the dinitrophenylhydrazine derivatization method described by Levineet al. (23Levine R.L. Williams J.A. Stadtman E.R. Schacter E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2267) Google Scholar). Quantification was performed using a Shodex KW803 HPLC gel filtration column at flow rate of 0.6 ml/min at 25 °C. Absorbance at 276 and 370 nm was monitored using a Waters 996 diode array detector. Values of carbonyl content for crude extracts are given in nmol/mg of protein; those for purified proteins are given in mol/mol of subunit. Anaerobic and aerobic cultures of E. coli were challenged with 2 mm hydrogen peroxide, and the resulting oxidative damage was analyzed by Western blotting. Carbonyl groups were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Anaerobic cultures showed a transient growth arrest of 2 h (not shown), a loss of 30% of cell viability, and a near 3-fold increase in the protein carbonyl concentration in crude extracts (Table I). Fig. 1shows the time course for increased protein damage resulting from the exposure of an anaerobic culture to hydrogen peroxide. Protein staining (panel A) and anti-DNP immunostaining (panel B) are shown. Time course experiments performed with 0.5 and 1 mm H2O2 gave the same oxidative pattern after longer periods of time of exposure to hydrogen peroxide (not shown). Protein bands were sequenced as indicated under “Experimental Procedures,” and the results obtained are summarized in Table II. As can be observed, proteins involved in different cell processes such as glucose catabolism (alcohol dehydrogenase E and enolase), chaperone function (DNA K), protein synthesis (EF-G), and an outer membrane protein (OMP A) have been identified as major targets for oxidative stress. The values of carbonyl content given in this table for each protein showed a 5–10-fold increase with respect to control values for unoxidized proteins, whose values ranged between 0.05 and 0.1 mol of carbonyl/mol of protein. The enzymatic activities of alcohol dehydrogenase E and enolase decreased, respectively, 80% and 25% after a 1-h treatment. It is interesting to observe that major bands with apparent molecular masses of 38 kDa and 42 kDa, indicated in Fig. 1 A, are clearly resistant to oxidation by hydrogen peroxide. These proteins were purified and identified by NH2-terminal sequence as a major outer membrane protein, OMP C, and EF-Tu.Table ICarbonyl content of crude extracts and cell viability after exposure to oxidative stress conditionsCulture conditionsCarbonyl contentSurvivalnmol/mg%Anaerobic1.9100Anaerobic + hydrogen peroxide (2 mm)5.368Aerobic3.0100Aerobic + hydrogen peroxide (2 mm)4.593Aerobic + iron overloading (100 μm)4.390Aerobic + menadione (20 mm)5.360Aerobic + paraquat (20 mm)3.712 Open table in a new tab Table IIIdentification and carbonyl content of proteins oxidized by hydrogen peroxide stress under anaerobic conditionsMolecular massIdentified proteinCarbonyl contentControlOxidizedkDanmol/mol96ADH E0.050.5278EF-G0.040.6170DNA K0.030.6355OPP A0.030.4346Enolase0.040.9235OMP A0.070.35 Open table in a new tab Aerobic metabolism generates reactive oxygen species and a set of antioxidant molecules to prevent oxidative damage (24González-Flecha B. Demple B. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 382-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 25González-Flecha B. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13681-13687Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, under oxidative stress conditions, proteins and other macromolecules become oxidized. The concentration of carbonyl content in aerobic cultures was 1.5 times higher than the values found in anaerobic conditions (Table I). When aerobic cultures were challenged with 2 mm hydrogen peroxide, a transient growth arrest of 2–3 h was also observed (not shown). Concentration of protein carbonyls showed an increase of 50% with respect to aerobic control conditions. Fig. 1 D shows that as in the case of anaerobic culture, time-dependent protein oxidative damage was observed. Apart from alcohol dehydrogenase E, a protein not synthesized when oxygen is present, one prominent band of 50 kDa was detected and identified as the β-subunit of F0F1-ATPase. This protein showed a decrease in enzymatic activity of 30% and 4.1 mol of carbonyl/mol of subunit, after stressing conditions. The rest of immunodetected protein bands were the same as those presented in Fig. 1 B. Changing cultures from anaerobic to aerobic conditions requires an induction of antioxidant molecules to protect the cell from superoxide and hydrogen peroxide generated under this new condition (24González-Flecha B. Demple B. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 382-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Superoxide can be converted to hydrogen peroxide, and this, in turn, can react with transition metals such as iron to form hydroxyl radical-promoting cell damage (14Stadtman E.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 797-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar, 26Stadtman E.R. Oliver C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2005-2008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Stadtman E.R. Berlett B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17201-17211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A deregulation in iron metabolism in E. coli fur mutants has been demonstrated to produce an oxidative stress resulting from iron overload (28Touati D. Jacques M. Tardat B. Bouchard L. Despied S. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2305-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). We have tested the oxidative damage promoted by shifting cultures from anaerobic to aerobic conditions in minimal medium supplemented with iron at a 40–100 μm final concentration once in aerobic conditions. No addition was made in the aerobic control. Fig. 2 shows the results obtained with samples tested at 20 and 60 min after the shift. The initial anaerobic conditions are shown in 0 time lane 0. It is clear (Fig. 2 B) that a slight oxidative damage is observed after 60 min in aerobic control conditions and that the oxidative damage was greater as the iron concentration increased. It is evident that there is a great similarity with the pattern obtained for the hydrogen peroxide stress. The identified proteins are shown in the figure. It is worth noting that OMP C, which was not oxidized under hydrogen peroxide stress, was clearly damaged under iron overloading conditions. The carbonyl content obtained after supplementing the culture with 100 μm iron for 60 min is 1.4 times higher than aerobic control conditions. A decrease of 10% of cell viability was observed (Table I). Electrophilic quinone compounds can be reduced in vivo to semiquinones, which in turn, are able to reduce oxygen to superoxide anion radical, regenerating the oxidized quinone (29Hassan M.H. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 196: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). To study the oxidative damage promoted by redox cycling agents, 20 mm menadione or paraquat was added to aerobically growing E. coli cells. In contrast to hydrogen peroxide stress conditions, a definite growth arrest was observed in these experiments (not shown). Table I shows protein oxidative damage after challenging the cells for 60 min. This treatment increased the value of the aerobic control conditions by 2.3 mol of carbonyl/mg of protein. The electrophoretic pattern of specific oxidative damage found was time- and dose-dependent (not shown). Fig. 3 B shows that two of the protein bands became highly oxidized; purification of these proteins allowed their identification as EF-G and β-subunit of F0F1-ATPase. The results of the same experiment performed with paraquat showed a slight increase in total protein carbonyl content and a dramatic decrease in cell viability (Table I). The Western blot pattern obtained (Fig. 3 B), indicated that in addition to the above mentioned proteins, oxidized DNA K is clearly detected. Table III indicates the carbonyl content of these three proteins after menadione or paraquat treatment. The values obtained for EF-G with menadione treatment were several times higher than those observed with paraquat or H2O2 treatment. The β-subunit of F0F1-ATPase exhibited the highest value observed among all of the data presented (8.1 mol of carbonyl/mol of protein) with a concomitant decrease of 65% in enzymatic activity.Table IIIIdentification and carbonyl content of proteins oxidized by menadione and paraquat stress under aerobic conditionsMolecular massIdentified proteinCarbonyl contentMenadioneParaquatkDamol/mol78EF G2.200.5370DNA K0.4250F0F1-ATPase (β-subunit)8.122.21 Open table in a new tab To study whether oxidation of these proteins depends on the iron present in the cell, cultures were grown in the presence of an iron chelator, Ferrozine, at 0.2 and 0.4 mm final concentration, and a menadione-induced oxidative stress was performed. Fig. 4 shows a clear decrease in the oxidation level of EF-G and β-subunit of F0F1-ATPase compared with control conditions where no Ferrozine was added. Exposure of E. coli cells to oxidative stress conditions resulted in selective protein oxidative damage. This was evident in superoxide stress conditions where three proteins were clearly oxidized. Protein oxidation observed with anti-DNP immunoassay did not depend on the amount of a particular protein because major protein bands such as EF-Tu or OMP C remained undamaged after hydrogen peroxide, menadione, or paraquat treatments. Furthermore, OMP C was only oxidized in the iron overload experiments, indicating once again the selective nature of the protein oxidation observed. It should be noted that oxidized proteins present in very low quantities are not detected easily unless they were highly oxidized. The detection limits are discussed by Shacter et al. (15Shacter E. Williams J.A. Lim M. Levine R.L. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 1994; 17: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The results presented in Table I show that the total protein oxidative damage, assessed by quantification of protein carbonyl content, depends on the type of stress produced. Even in the case of shifting an anaerobic culture to aerobic conditions there was, once in equilibrated aerobic growth conditions, an increase in carbonyl content from 1.9 to 3. It is interesting to note that the increase in the protein carbonyl content of crude extracts of anaerobic cultures challenged with 2 mm hydrogen peroxide is greater than that obtained from aerobic cultures. One explanation for this could be that aerobic cultures have antioxidant enzymes (such as catalase) already induced, so the formation of hydroxyl radicals by Fenton reaction will decrease, thus reducing the extent of protein and other macromolecule oxidation. In this situation cell viability will be better preserved than in anaerobic cultures (Table I). It is clear that loss of cell viability depends not only on the protein damage but also, to a great extent, on DNA damage (28Touati D. Jacques M. Tardat B. Bouchard L. Despied S. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2305-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). However, loss of cell viability is higher as the carbonyl content increases except for the case of paraquat where there is a moderate increase in carbonyl content and a high loss of cell viability. One possible explanation for this result could be the poor induction of catalase by paraquat in contrast to the high induction exerted by menadione. In both situations similar values of SOD activity have been reported (29Hassan M.H. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 196: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 30Greenberg J.T. Demple B. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3933-3939Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Major immunostained protein bands observed with anti-DNP immunoassay have been selected to be identified by NH2-terminal sequencing; these proteins were purified by preparative electrophoresis. Although during electrophoresis, the pH in the resolving gel is unfavorable for stability of hydrazone derivatives, we have not observed a significant loss of signal compared with immunoasssays of whole crude extracts. Oxidatively damaged proteins tend to be eliminated more rapidly by proteases than their normal counterparts (31Stadtman E.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6323-6331Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar); this increased susceptibility to proteolytic degradation might make detection of highly modified proteins more difficult. Nevertheless, this does not seem to be the case in our study for two reasons. First, our observations in time course experiments indicated that the signal for each oxidized protein band increases constantly soon (5 min) after challenging cultures with hydrogen peroxide or redox cycling agents. Second, normal rat liver epithelia cells challenged with hydrogen peroxide have been shown to cause a transient depression in protein degradation with respect to control cells; thereafter proteolysis was increased significantly (32Grune T. Reinheckel T. Joshi M. Davies K.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2344-2351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The results obtained indicated that EF-G became oxidized in all tested stress conditions, including aerobic growth. Recent data published by Ayala et al. (33Ayala A. Parrado J. Bougria M. Machado A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23105-23110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) showed the oxidative damage of EF-2, the eukaryotic counterpart of EF-G, by exposure of hepatocytes to cumene hydroperoxide. This treatment caused a doubling in carbonyl content (from 0.3 to 0.6 mol of carbonyl/mol) and a concomitant inhibition of EF-2 activity. In our case, the concentration of carbonyl groups detected for EF-G after peroxide (0.6 mol of carbonyl/mol) and superoxide stress conditions (2.2 mol carbonyl/mol with menadione and 0.5 mol of carbonyl/mol with paraquat) clearly account for the inactivation of this translocase. Sequence data from a 36-kDa peptide obtained after limited proteolysis of EF-G with V8 protease indicated major oxidative damage to the carboxyl-terminal region (domains 4–5). Domain 4 would have the residue where the ADP-ribosylation of EF-2 occurs (34Czworkowski J. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Moore P.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3661-3668Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 35Ævarson A. Brazhnikov E. Garber M. Zheltonosova J. Chirgadze Y. Al-Karadaghi S. Svensson L.A. Liljas A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3669-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). If such a reaction takes place in EF-G, this could promote the observed oxidative damage to this protein because (i) ADP-ribosylation increases under oxidative stress (36Schraufstätter I.U. Hyslop P.A. Hinshaw D.B. Spragg R.G. Sklar L.A. Cochrane C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4908-4912Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 37Hyslop P.A. Hinshaw D.B.

Med. 1995; 18: 321-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3563) Google Scholar); and (iii) we proved that the oxidation of EF-G depends on the availability of iron. In vivo oxidation of the β-subunit of F0F1-ATPase was detected in aerobically grown cells under menadione, paraquat, and hydrogen peroxide stress conditions. The addition of Ferrozine, an iron chelator, to the cultures stressed with menadione diminished the degree of oxidative damage to this subunit (and also to the EF-G protein), thus indicating that a Haber-Weiss reaction is involved in the oxidation mechanism of both proteins (39Starke P.E. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10099-10104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This finding agrees with previous data reportingin vitro metal-catalyzed oxidation of mitochondrial ATP synthase (40Belogrudov G.I. Arch. Biochem.

Our finding also supports the early depletion of ATP levels observed in vivounder oxidative stress conditions (43Holmsen H. Robkin L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1752-1757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Verhoeven A.J.M. Mommersteeg M.E. Akkerman J.W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2621-2624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) because the high carbonyl content of the catalytic β-subunit is consistent with the enzyme inactivation observed. Enzymes involved in the glycolytic flux are also oxidized; alcohol dehydrogenase E in anaerobic cultures and enolase in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions were identified as targets for the oxidative process. These data support the observation that hydrogen peroxide causes a decrease in the activity of glycolytic enzymes in transformed eukaryotic cells (37Hyslop P.A. Hinshaw D.B. Halsey Jr., W.A. Schraufstätter I.U. Sauerheber R.D. Spragg R.G. Jackson J.H. Cochrane C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1665-1675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Metal-catalyzed oxidation, a site-specific protein oxidation mechanism (14Stadtman E.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 797-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar), would be responsible for the oxidation of alcohol dehydrogenase E, an iron-containing enzyme. The sequence of the immunostained peptide band (35 kDa) obtained after limited proteolysis, which was used to confirm the identity of the target protein, corresponds to the carboxyl terminus of the enzyme. This domain, which includes an iron binding motif, has sequence homology with the microbial iron-activated group III of dehydrogenases (45Reid M.F. Fewson C.A. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 20: 13-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) such as propanediol oxidoreductase of E. coli and alcohol dehydrogenase II of Zymomonas mobilis. We proved that these two enzymes were inactivated by metal-catalyzed oxidation resulting from modification of histidine 277, which lies 10 residues apart from the iron-chelating motif His-X-X-X-His (46Cabiscol E. Aguilar J. Ros J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6592-6597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specificity of this mechanism explains that the oxidative damage measured in alcohol dehydrogenase E must affect the active center directly; however, the high oxidation observed in ATPase probably affects amino acid residues not directly involved in the catalytic mechanism. The same explanation could also apply to enolase. Enolase was described as a heat shock protein in yeast because it shares some degree of homology with DNA K (47Iida H. Yahara I. Nature. 1985; : 688-690Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Recently, enolase and DNA K have been found associated to RNase E in a multicomponent ribonucleolytic complex (RNA degradosome) essential for RNA processing and degradation (48Py B. Higgins C.F. Krisch H.M. Carpousis A.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 49Miczak A. Kaberdin V.R. Wei C. Lin-Chao S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3865-3869Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Increased degradation of 16 S ribosomal RNA has been described to occur in mitochondria in response to hydrogen peroxide exposure (50Crawford D.R. Wang Y. Schools G.P. Kochheiser J. Davies K.J.A. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 551-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In this situation, proteins involved in the RNA degradosome would be oxidized preferentially as a consequence of the reactive oxygen species generated by metal ions associated with RNA (51Misra T.K. Apirion D. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11154-11159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA K oxidation may also be explained on the basis that as a molecular chaperone it may interact with proteins damaged (unfolded) by stress conditions. In fact, it has been suggested (52Dean R.T. Gieseg S. Davies M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 437-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) that oxidized proteins contain reactive species that can damage other proteins. The oxidation of this chaperone due to interaction with nascent polypeptides with oxidized amino acid side chains was ruled out as no changes in anti-DNP immunostained pattern were observed in cultures treated previously with chloramphenicol to stop protein synthesis. The peptide used to identify further OMP A protein indicated that oxidative damage was located in the periplasmic COOH-terminal domain. Interestingly, oligopeptide-binding periplasmic protein A protein is also oxidized in peroxide and iron overload experiments. Even though the mechanisms that cause this oxidative damage are unclear, it seems that the membrane could play a role in protecting the protein domains embedded in it. Experiments carried out with monoamine oxidase seem to indicate this (53Dean R.T. Fu S. Stocker R. Davies M.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar). This would also apply to undamaged OMP C protein under hydrogen peroxide stress conditions. The oxidative damage to OMP C observed in iron overload conditions suggests that this protein is involved in iron uptake in such overdose conditions; the acidic internal loop of this porin (54Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3905-3908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) may be responsible for binding metal ions and promoting the formation of reactive oxygen species, which would account for the oxidation detected. It is known that oxidative stress induces GADD (growth arrest and DNA damage) genes (55Crawford D.R. Davies K.J.A. Environ. Health Perspect. 1994; 102: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 56Fornace A.J. Alamo I. Hollander M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8800-8804Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) to stop growth, which, in turn, minimizes cell damage. The oxidative modification of EF-G and the β-subunit of ATPase clearly plays an important role in the above mentioned mechanism because ATP and protein synthesis decrease in this situation.

A further metabolite of ceramide, sphingosine 1-phosphate (SPP), prevents ceramide-mediated apoptosis, and it has been suggested that the balance between intracellular ceramide and SPP levels may determine the cell fate (Cuvillier, O., Pirianov, G, Kleuser, B., Vanek, P. G., Coso, O. A., Gutkind, J. S., and Spiegel, S. (1996) Nature 381, 800–803). Here, we investigated the role of SPP and the protein kinase C activator, phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), in the caspase cascade leading to the proteolysis of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and lamins. In Jurkat T cells, Fas ligation or addition of exogenous C2-ceramide induced activations of caspase-3/CPP32 and caspase-7/Mch3 followed by PARP cleavage, effects that can be blocked either by SPP or TPA. Furthermore, both SPP and TPA inhibit the activation of caspase-6/Mch2 and subsequent lamin B cleavage. Ceramide, in contrast to Fas ligation, did not induce activation of caspase-8/FLICE and neither SPP nor TPA were able to prevent this activation. Thus, SPP, likely generated via protein kinase C-mediated activation of sphingosine kinase, suppresses the apoptotic pathway downstream of FLICE but upstream of the executioner caspases, caspase-3, -6, and -7.

Physiologic cell death occurs through an evolutionary conserved suicide process, termed apoptosis, which plays a considerable role in early development and homeostasis of adult tissues (1Vaux D.L. Strasser A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2239-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). Ceramide has recently emerged as a critical component of apoptosis (2Obeid L.M.

Fas ligand, growth factor withdrawal, anticancer drugs, oxidative stress, heat shock, ionizing radiation, and ultraviolet light increase cellular ceramide which, in turn, is capable of inducing apoptosis (3Hannun Y. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar, 4Spiegel S. Foster D. Kolesnick R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). This apoptotic effect is blocked by addition of the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) or diacylglycerol, both activators of protein kinase C (PKC) (2Obeid L.M. Linardic C.M.

Activation of PKC in diverse cell types stimulates sphingosine kinase activity resulting in intracellular accumulation of sphingosine 1-phosphate (SPP) (6Mazurek N. Megidish T. Hakomori S.-I. Igarashi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 7Cuvillier O. Pirianov G. Kleuser B. Vanek P.J. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Spiegel S. Nature. 1996; 381: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that SPP prevented the hallmarks of apoptosis resulting from elevated levels of ceramide induced by TNFα, anti-Fas antibody, sphingomyelinase, or cell-permeable ceramide (7Cuvillier O. Pirianov G. Kleuser B. Vanek P.J. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Spiegel S. Nature. 1996; 381: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). Furthermore, inhibition of PKC, as well as inhibition of sphingosine kinase, induces apoptosis, which can be overcome by the addition of SPP (7Cuvillier O. Pirianov G. Kleuser B. Vanek P.J. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Spiegel S. Nature. 1996; 381: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). These results indicate that PKC may inhibit ceramide-induced apoptosis by activating sphingosine kinase.Recently, attention has been focused on the role of a novel family of aspartate-specific cysteine proteases, called caspases, which are intimately associated with apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 8Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2175) Google Scholar). Genetic studies of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans have led to the identification of two genes, ced-3 and ced-4, that are required for apoptotic cell death (9Yuan J. Shaham S. Ledoux S. Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 641-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar). The ced-3gene encodes a caspase similar to the prototype mammalian interleukin 1β-converting enzyme (ICE) (9Yuan J. Shaham S. Ledoux S. Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 641-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar). Ten other homologs of ICE/CED-3 have been identified and phylogenetically classified into three subfamilies: (i) the CED-3 subfamily, consisting of caspase-3 (CPP32/Yama/apopain), caspase-6 (Mch2), caspase-7 (Mch3/ICE-LAP3/CMH-1), caspase-8 (FLICE/MACH/Mch5), caspase-9 (ICE-LAP6/Mch6), and caspase-10 (Mch4); (ii) the ICE subfamily, which includes caspase-1 (ICE), caspase-4 (TX/ICH2/ICE rel-II), caspase-5 (TY/ICE rel-III), and caspase-11 (ICH3); and (iii) the Nedd-2 subfamily, which is represented by caspase-2 (ICH1/murine Nedd-2).Previous studies have identified a number of substrates for the caspases, particularly the DNA repair enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) (10Nicholson D.W. All A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3777) Google Scholar) and the nuclear lamins (11Lazebnik Y.A. Takahashi A. Moir R.D. Goldman R.D. Poirier G.G. Kaufman S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9042-9046Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Proteolysis of these substrates may account for many of the biochemical and morphological nuclear changes associated with apoptosis. The early cleavage of PARP can be catalyzed by several caspases belonging to the CED-3 subfamily (10Nicholson D.W. All A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R.

Of these, caspase-3/CPP32 is thought to be the most efficient PARP protease (10Nicholson D.W. All A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M.

The degradation of nuclear lamins is required for packaging of the condensed chromatin into apoptotic bodies, a typical morphology observed during the late stages of apoptosis (11Lazebnik Y.A. Takahashi A. Moir R.D. Goldman R.D. Poirier G.G. Kaufman S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9042-9046Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Caspase-6/Mch2 is the only known caspase capable of cleaving lamins (14Orth K. Chinnaiyan A.M. Garg M. Froelich C.J. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16443-16446Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 15Takahashi A. Alnemri E.S. Lazebnik Y.A. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Moir R.D. Goldman R.D. Poirier G.G. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8395-8400Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar).Although the relative intracellular levels of ceramide and SPP have been proposed to be a critical gauge of cell fate (7Cuvillier O. Pirianov G. Kleuser B. Vanek P.J. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Spiegel S. Nature. 1996; 381: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanism of actions of these sphingolipid metabolites are not well understood. Recently, ceramide has been implicated in PARP cleavage (16Dbaibo G.S. Perry D.K. Gamard C.J. Platt R. Poirier G.G. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 17Smyth M.J. Perry D.K. Zhang J. Poirier G.G. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Biochem.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In addition, it appears that ceramide can be generated via a CrmA-inhibitable caspase, most likely caspase-8/FLICE, since overexpression of CrmA blocks both cell death and ceramide accumulation induced by TNFα, while exogenous ceramide can bypass this sensitive step and induce apoptosis (16Dbaibo G.S. Perry D.K. Gamard C.J. Platt R. Poirier G.G. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar).In this study, the relationship between sphingolipid metabolites and the caspases was examined. We demonstrated that both SPP and TPA decrease PARP cleavage by inhibiting activation of caspase-3/CPP32 and caspase-7/Mch3 induced by Fas ligation or cell-permeable ceramide. Furthermore, we also report that SPP and TPA inhibit activation of caspase-6/Mch2 and subsequent lamin B cleavage. Finally, ceramide, in contrast to Fas ligation, did not induce activation of caspase-8/FLICE and neither SPP nor TPA were able to prevent this activation.DISCUSSIONWithin the last few years, new studies have been reported, which have enhanced our understanding of how cell surface events are communicated to the cell suicide machinery (21Chinnaiyan A.M.

Protein-protein interactions link death domains of cell surface receptors for TNF-α (TNF receptor-1) or Fas ligand (CD95/Fas/APO-1) to a cascade of ICE/CED-3-homologous proteases. Binding of the adaptor protein FADD, which also contains a death effector domain, either directly to CD95/Fas/APO-1 or to TNF receptor-1 via another death domain-containing protein TRADD (35Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V.

Once activated, caspase-7 and caspase-6 can process their distinctive targets, PARP and lamins, respectively. Potential sites for interactions between sphingolipid metabolites and the caspase cascade were investigated in this study.Although our understanding is not complete, several lines of evidence suggest that ceramide plays an important role in apoptosis induced by cytokines, chemotherapeutic agents, serum withdrawal, or ionizing radiation, and does not arise merely as a consequence of activation of the death machinery (reviewed in Ref. 3Hannun Y. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar). First, overexpression of the proto-oncogene Bcl-2, a CED-9 homolog, or treatment with SPP, both of which prevent apoptosis, did not interfere with ceramide formation induced by various insults (7Cuvillier O.

Second, ceramide production and apoptosis induced by Fas ligand or TNF-α can be blocked by overexpression of the viral serpin CrmA (16Dbaibo G.S. Perry D.K. Gamard C.J. Platt R. Poirier G.G. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), whose in vivo target is most likely caspase-8 (34Zhou Q. Snipas S. Orth K. Muzio M. Dixit V.M. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7797-7800Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). In agreement, we show here that ceramide does not induce activation of caspase-8 (Fig. 8). Third, the cell-permeable analog C2- or C6-ceramide induce activation of caspase-3 (18Mizushima N. Koike R. Kohsaka H. Kushi Y. Handa S. Yagita H. Miyasaka N.

Obeid L.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Furthermore, our study demonstrates that exogenous C2-ceramide also activates PARP protease caspase-7 (Fig. 5), the closest homolog to caspase-3, acting through caspase-3 itself (13Fernandes-Alnemri T. Takahashi A. Armstrong R. Krebs J. Fritz L. Tomaselli K.J. Wang L. Yu Z. Croce C.M. Salvesen G. Earnshaw W.C. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 6045-6052PubMed Google Scholar) or independently. Finally, we describe here for the first time that C2-ceramide induces lamin B cleavage (Fig. 6), likely mediated by caspase-6 activation (Fig. 7). The mechanism by which ceramide stimulates proteolytic processing of caspase-6 is still unclear, but it is tempting to speculate that this may also be mediated via caspase-3 as proposed by Alnemri and co-workers (41Srinivasula S.M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Zangrilli J. Robertson N. Armstrong R.C. Wang L. Trapani J.A. Tomaselli K.J. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27099-27106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Taken together, our observations highlight the relationship between ceramide and the caspase cascade, and demonstrate, in agreement with other studies (16Dbaibo G.S. Perry D.K. Gamard C.J. Platt R. Poirier G.G. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), that ceramide can be placed downstream of the initiator caspase-8 and upstream of the executioner CPP32-like proteases (Fig. 9).Although SPP was originally shown to rescue cells from ceramide-mediated cell death (7Cuvillier O. Pirianov G. Kleuser B. Vanek P.J. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Spiegel S. Nature. 1996; 381: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar), it was not clear how it was linked to the deadly caspase cascade. Our results demonstrate that cleavage of the death substrates, PARP and lamins, induced by Fas antibody or exogenous ceramide, is inhibited by co-treatment with SPP. In addition, we found that activation of the caspases directly responsible for the breakdown of these substrates by Fas ligation or ceramide is also inhibited by SPP. Our results establish that SPP functions upstream of caspase-3/CPP32. Nevertheless, because the proximal molecular targets by which ceramide activates CPP32 and related CED-3 subfamily caspases remain largely unknown, further work is necessary to identify the targets for ceramide and SPP.Several reports have provided evidence that some of the effects of SPP are mediated through cell surface receptors (3Hannun Y. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar, 4Spiegel S. Foster D. Kolesnick R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). However, the anti-apoptotic effects of SPP appear to be mediated via intracellular targets, as inhibition of sphingosine kinase byN,N-dimethylsphingosine not only eliminates formation of SPP induced by TPA, it also induces apoptosis and prevents the cytoprotective activity of TPA which can be restored by addition of SPP (7Cuvillier O. Pirianov G. Kleuser B. Vanek P.J. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Spiegel S. Nature. 1996; 381: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar).Recently, it has been suggested that the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK/JNK) pathway is required for ceramide-mediated apoptosis because overexpression of dominant-negative constituents of the JNK pathway abrogates ceramide-mediated apoptosis (42Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar). It has also been well documented that Fas ligation induces SAPK/JNK activation in Jurkat T cells (43Chen Y.R. Wang X. Templeton D. Davis R.J. Tan T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31929-31936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar, 44Juo P. Kuo C.J. Reynolds S.E. Konz R.F. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Biemann H. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 45Latinis K.M. Koretzky G.A. Blood. 1996; 87: 871-875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, we have shown previously that SPP not only stimulates the extracellular signal-regulated kinases Erk1 and Erk2, it also prevents SAPK/JNK activation by ceramide and consequent apoptosis (7Cuvillier O. Pirianov G. Kleuser B. Vanek P.J. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Spiegel S. Nature. 1996; 381: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). Thus, we have proposed that the formation of distinct sphingolipid metabolites and consequent regulation of different family members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family is an important factor determining the fate of cells (7Cuvillier O. Pirianov G. Kleuser B. Vanek P.J. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Spiegel S. Nature. 1996; 381: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). However, the relationships between activation of the caspase cascade and the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway leading to apoptosis have not yet been clarified. Recent evidence supports a parallel pathway model leading to apoptosis, in which the Fas-binding proteins, FADD and Daxx, activate the SAPK/JNK pathway and the caspase cascade independently (46Yang X. Khosravi-Far R. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). It is very intriguing that the sphingolipid metabolites, ceramide and SPP, have opposing effects on these two important apoptotic pathways downstream of Fas. Identification of the proximal intracellular targets of these sphingolipids should provide useful clues to the regulation cell survival. Physiologic cell death occurs through an evolutionary conserved suicide process, termed apoptosis, which plays a considerable role in early development and homeostasis of adult tissues (1Vaux D.L. Strasser A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2239-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). Ceramide has recently emerged as a critical component of apoptosis (2Obeid L.M.

Fas ligand, growth factor withdrawal, anticancer drugs, oxidative stress, heat shock, ionizing radiation, and ultraviolet light increase cellular ceramide which, in turn, is capable of inducing apoptosis (3Hannun Y. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar, 4Spiegel S. Foster D. Kolesnick R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). This apoptotic effect is blocked by addition of the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) or diacylglycerol, both activators of protein kinase C (PKC) (2Obeid L.M. Linardic C.M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 31685-31692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that PKC activation counteracts ceramide-mediated apoptosis. Activation of PKC in diverse cell types stimulates sphingosine kinase activity resulting in intracellular accumulation of sphingosine 1-phosphate (SPP) (6Mazurek N. Megidish T. Hakomori S.-I. Igarashi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 7Cuvillier O. Pirianov G. Kleuser B. Vanek P.J. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Spiegel S. Nature. 1996; 381: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that SPP prevented the hallmarks of apoptosis resulting from elevated levels of ceramide induced by TNFα, anti-Fas antibody, sphingomyelinase, or cell-permeable ceramide (7Cuvillier O. Pirianov G. Kleuser B. Vanek P.J. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Spiegel S. Nature. 1996; 381: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). Furthermore, inhibition of PKC, as well as inhibition of sphingosine kinase, induces apoptosis, which can be overcome by the addition of SPP (7Cuvillier O. Pirianov G. Kleuser B. Vanek P.J. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Spiegel S. Nature. 1996; 381: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). These results indicate that PKC may inhibit ceramide-induced apoptosis by activating sphingosine kinase. Recently, attention has been focused on the role of a novel family of aspartate-specific cysteine proteases, called caspases, which are intimately associated with apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 8Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2175) Google Scholar). Genetic studies of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans have led to the identification of two genes, ced-3 and ced-4, that are required for apoptotic cell death (9Yuan J. Shaham S. Ledoux S. Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 641-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar). The ced-3gene encodes a caspase similar to the prototype mammalian interleukin 1β-converting enzyme (ICE) (9Yuan J. Shaham S. Ledoux S. Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 641-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar). Ten other homologs of ICE/CED-3 have been identified and phylogenetically classified into three subfamilies: (i) the CED-3 subfamily, consisting of caspase-3 (CPP32/Yama/apopain), caspase-6 (Mch2), caspase-7 (Mch3"

We found in this study that Ahr contains both nuclear localization and export signals in the NH2-terminal region. A fusion protein composed of β-galactosidase and full-length Ahr translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in a ligand-dependent manner. However, a fusion protein lacking the PAS (Per-Ahr nuclear translocator-Sim homology) domain of the Ahr showed strong nuclear localization activity irrespective of the presence or absence of ligand. A minimum bipartite Ahr nuclear localization signal (NLS) consisting of amino acid residues 13–39 was identified by microinjection of fused proteins with glutathioneS-transferase-green fluorescent protein. A NLS having mutations in bipartite basic amino acids lost nuclear translocation activity completely, which may explain the reduced binding activity to the NLS receptor, PTAC58. A 21-amino acid peptide (residues 55–75) containing the Ahr nuclear export signal is sufficient to direct nuclear export of a microinjected complex of glutathioneS-transferase-Ahr-green fluorescent protein.

Before binding ligands, Ahr is located in the cytoplasm as one component of a complex that has a molecular mass of about 280 kDa (1Denison M.S. Vella L.M. Okey A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3987-3995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This complex is composed of Ahr, two molecules of the 90-kDa heat shock protein, and possibly a 43-kDa protein (2Chen H.-S. Perdew G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27554-27558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After ligand binding, Ahr dissociates from the complex and translocates to the nucleus (3McGuire J. Whitelaw M.L. Pongratz I. Gustafsson J.-Å. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2438-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The heterodimer of Ahr and Ahr nuclear translocator (ARNT) constitutes a transcription factor and binds specific DNA sequences called XREs (xenobiotic-responsive elements) in the enhancer regions of the CYP1A1 and several other proteins involved in xenobiotic metabolism (4Matsushita N. Sogawa K. Ema M. Yoshida A. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21002-21006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because these enzymes are involved in the metabolism of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to active genotoxic metabolites, Ahr plays an important role in carcinogenesis caused by these compounds (5Hankinson O. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 307-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar, 6Kawajiri K. Hayashi S.-I. Ioannides C. Cytochrome P450: Metabolic and Toxicological Aspects.

Because ARNT was first cloned as a factor required for ligand-dependent nuclear translocation of Ahr from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (8Hoffman E.C. Reyes H. Chu F.-F. Sander F. Conley L.H. Brooks B.A. Hankinson O. Science. 1991; 252: 954-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar), the subcellular localization of ARNT was believed to be cytoplasmic. In fact, most ARNT was recovered in the cytosolic fraction by cell fractionation. However, immunohistochemical analysis has shown that ARNT is localized predominantly in the nucleus, regardless of the presence or absence of ligands (9Hord N.G. Perdew G.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 618-626PubMed Google Scholar, 10Pollenz R.S. Sattler C.A. Poland A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 428-438PubMed Google Scholar). This controversial subject was clarified by our recent study in which a nuclear localization signal (NLS) of the amino acid residues between 39 and 61 of human ARNT was found to be a novel bipartite type recognized by the two components of nuclear pore-targeting complex (11Eguchi H. Ikuta T. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Kawajiri K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17640-17647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Because the heterodimeric partner Ahr is present in the cytoplasm in the absence of ligands and translocates to the nucleus upon binding of ligands even in the ARNT-deficient cell line, Hepa-1 c4, these two subunits may translocate independently to the nucleus, where they may form a heterodimer to bind to the cognate DNA sequence, XRE. This finding prompted us to investigate the molecular translocation mechanism of Ahr from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in a ligand-dependent manner. Active transport of proteins between the nucleus and cytoplasm is a major process in eukaryotic cells (12Görlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar, 13Nigg E.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). Transport of proteins across the nuclear pore is generally selective and signal-dependent. Active import of proteins into the nucleus requires the presence of NLS. NLSs of various proteins identified so far can be classified mainly into two classes: 1) a single cluster of basic amino acids represented by the SV40 large T antigen NLS, and 2) a bipartite type, in which two sets of adjacent basic amino acids are separated by a stretch of approximately 10 amino acids (12Görlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar, 13Nigg E.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). On the other hand, nuclear export signals (NESs) have been found recently in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Rev protein (14Fischer U. Huber J. Boelens W. Mattaj I.W. Luhrmann R. Cell. 1995; 82: 475-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar), a cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A) inhibitor (PKI; 15), the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) (16Eberhart D.E. Malter H.E. Feng Y. Warren S.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1083-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) (17Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20024-20028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The characteristic of the NESs defined was certain leucine-enriched amino acid stretches (18Gerace L. Cell. 1995; 82: 341-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Two novel signals found to direct both import and export were the M9 domain of human nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (19Michael W.M. Choi M. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1995; 83: 415-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) and KNS of human nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (20Michael W.M. Eder P.S. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3587-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The NLS-dependent nuclear import process requires at least four different proteins that act in a sequential manner with NLS-containing proteins. There appear to be several discrete steps in the import process which involve: 1) binding of the NLS receptors (importin α, karyopherin α, PTAC58) to an NLS; 2) complex formation in conjunction with importin β (karyopherin β, PTAC97); 3) targeting nuclear pore proteins; and 4) ATP/GTP-dependent translocation through the nuclear pore mediated by Ran (12Görlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar, 13Nigg E.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar, 21Powers M.A. Forbes D.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 931-934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). A number of NLS receptors have been identified recently, suggesting that there is a family of these NLS-binding proteins (22Cortes P. Ye Z.-S. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Differential expression and sequence-specific interaction of NLS receptors with various types of NLSs have been reported recently (29Nadler S.G. Tritschler D. Haffar O.K. Blake J. Bruce A.G. Cleaveland J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4310-4315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), indicating that NLS receptors may play a role in regulating nuclear protein transport. A novel receptor-mediated nuclear protein import pathway recognized by transportin has also been reported in the case of M9-containing human nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 protein (30Pollard V.W. Michael W.M. Nakielny S. Siomi M. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1996; 86: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism for the export of proteins from the nucleus is much less well understood than the import process at present. In the present study we investigated the nuclear translocation of Ahr using transient expression of chimeric constructs of Ahr and β-galactosidase (β-gal) in the presence or absence of ligand, clarifying the ligand-dependent nuclear localization of the Ahr protein. Subsequent analysis of various portions of Ahr using β-gal fusions as well as fusion protein with GST-GFP (green fluorescent protein) gave the minimum NLS consisting of amino acids 13–39, which completely overlaps the DNA binding domain of Ahr. We investigated the molecular mechanisms of the nuclear translocation of Ahr further using an in vitro system and also found signal-dependent nuclear export activity. Cell lines used for this study were the mouse hepatoma Hepa-1 clone Hepa 1c1c7, Hepa-1 c4 mutant, which lacks ARNT expression, generously provided by Dr. O. Hankinson, as well as HeLa and Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C with 5% CO2 atmosphere. Human Ahr cDNA was prepared by polymerase chain reaction amplification of reverse transcribed products of total RNA from HepG2 cells using specific primers and PfuDNA polymerase (CLONTECH); this DNA was then inserted in the pGEM-7Zf(+) vector (Promega). The sequence of the construct was confirmed by sequencing using fluorescein-labeled SP6 and T7 primers, AutoRead Sequencing kits, and an A.L.F.II DNA sequencer (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Subsequent cloning into the pSVβ-gal (Promega) was performed as described previously (11Eguchi H. Ikuta T. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Kawajiri K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17640-17647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). the BglII-BglII fragment of the Ahr cDNA was ligated to the BglII site of the modified β-gal control vector to generate the β-gal/Ahr(1–848) vector. Various portions of Ahr cDNA were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the β-gal/Ahr(1–848) vector as a template and Pfu DNA polymerase with specific sets of primers to generate artificial BglII sites at both ends. The sequences of the primers used for the preparation of fragments of Ahr were as follows: F1, GTC TGG TGT CAA AAA CAG ATC TGC ATG and R24, TTCAGA TCT TAA GGG ATC CAT TAT GGC AGG for Ahr(1–427); F1 and R6, TTC AGA TCT TAA TAA GAA TTC TCC TTC TTG for Ahr(1–119); F4, TAT AAG ATC TGC CAG GCT CTG AAT GGC TTT and R5, TTC AGA TCT TAG TGG TCT CTG AGT TAC AAT for Ahr(120–386); F5, TAT AAG ATC TGC ACA GAT GAG GAA GGA ACA and R4, CCT GCC CGG TTA TTA TTA AGA TCT CAG for Ahr(387–848); F1 and R48, TTC AGA TCT TCG GTC TCT ATG CCG CTT GGA for Ahr(1–42). After cleavage with BglII, the fragments were ligated to the BglII site of modified pSVβ-gal control vector to give in-frame fusion genes. To construct GST-Ahr-GFP fusion genes, the GST-GFP2 cassette vector was prepared as described previously (11Eguchi H. Ikuta T. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Kawajiri K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17640-17647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).

After cleavage with BglII, the fragments were ligated to the BamHI site of the GST-GFP2 vector as described previously (11Eguchi H. Ikuta T. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Kawajiri K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17640-17647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The direction of inserts was determined by sequencing. For the preparation of Ahr(13–42, Δ19–35), two oligonucleotides F38, GAT CTC TCG CAA GCG GCG GAA GCC GTC CAA GCG GCA TAG AGA CCG AA, and R57, GAT CTT CGG TCT CTA TGC CGC TTG GAC GGC TTC CGC CGC TTG CGA GA, were annealed and phosphorylated. Construction of GST-NLSc-GFP, which contained the core sequence of NLS of SV40 large T antigen (31Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1864) Google Scholar), was prepared as described previously (11Eguchi H. Ikuta T. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Kawajiri K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17640-17647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Cells (3.5 × 106) in 400 μl of potassium phosphate-buffered saline were transfected with 15 μg of each β-gal fusion protein expression vector by electroporation using the Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) with the voltage and capacitance set at 450 V and 960 microfarads, respectively. After transfection, cells were cultured for 48 h with or without 1 μm MC (3-methylcholanthrene). In situ staining of β-gal was carried out as described previously (11Eguchi H. Ikuta T. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Kawajiri K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17640-17647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence staining of Ahr was carried out as described previously (10Pollenz R.S. Sattler C.A. Poland A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 428-438PubMed Google Scholar) using polyclonal antibody against Ahr (BIOMOL) as a primary antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Organon Teknika-Cappel) as a secondary antibody. The GST-Ahr-GFP vectors described above were introduced into the Escherichia coli strain BL21. Purification of expressed GST-Ahr-GFP fusion proteins was carried out as described previously (11Eguchi H. Ikuta T. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Kawajiri K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17640-17647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The purified proteins were dialyzed against 20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.3, containing 110 mm potassium acetate, 5 mmsodium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, and 1 mm EGTA. The purified fusion proteins were analyzed using 10% acrylamide gel and showed a major protein band of 55 kDa (data not shown). Microinjection experiments were performed essentially as described previously (32Yoneda Y. Imamoto-Sonobe N. Yamaizumi M. Uchida T. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 173: 586-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Various GST-Ahr-GFP fusion proteins were injected into the cytoplasm of HeLa cells. After microinjection, the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min before fixation with 4% formaldehyde. Localization of the fusion proteins was examined by fluorescent microscopy. Recombinant PTAC58 and PTAC97 (33Imamoto N. Shimamoto T. Kose S. Takao T. Tachibana T. Matsubae M. Sekimoto T. Shimonishi Y. Yoneda Y. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) were expressed in BL21 as GST fusion protein as described previously (25Imamoto N. Shimamoto T. Takao T. Tachibana T. Kose S. Matsubae M. Sekimoto T. Shimonishi Y. Yoneda Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3617-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Finally, recombinant proteins of PTAC58 and PTAC97 were obtained by cleavage with thrombin to release the GST portion. Preparation of total cytosol of Ehrlich ascites tumor cells was conducted as described previously (34Imamoto N. Tachibana T. Matsubae M. Yoneda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8559-8565Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Digitonin-permeabilized MDBK cells were prepared as described previously (35Okuno Y. Imamoto N. Yoneda Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 206: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) based on the method of Adam et al. (36Adam S.A. Sterne-Marr R. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). The testing solution (10 μl) consisted of GST-Ahr-GFP and transport buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 110 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EGTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) containing 1 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. Transport assay was performed in the presence or absence of cytosol with 1 mm ATP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, and 20 units/ml creatine phosphokinase at 37 °C for 30 min. For the nuclear transport assay using purified preparations, recombinant PTAC58, PTAC97, Ran and p10 proteins were added instead of cytosol. The nuclear rim targeting assay was performed by the addition of purified recombinant PTAC58 and PTAC97 proteins in the testing solution followed by incubation at 4 °C for 30 min. After incubation, the cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde, and localization of GST-Ahr-GFP fusion proteins was examined under a fluorescent microscope. GST-Ahr-GFP proteins, which were adjusted with the same amounts by monitoring the absorbance at 280 nm, were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) for 1 h at 4 °C and then washed three times with transport buffer. The Sepharose was incubated with purified PTAC58 and PTAC97 in transport buffer containing 1 mg/ml BSA, 1 mm of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.05% CHAPS. After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, the Sepharose was washed three times with transport buffer, added to lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, containing 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and boiled for 10 min. The eluted proteins were separated by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. After incubation with blocking buffer containing 3% gelatin in TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) for 30 min, the filter was rinsed by TBS and incubated with anti-PTAC58 rabbit antibody (25Imamoto N. Shimamoto T. Takao T. Tachibana T. Kose S. Matsubae M. Sekimoto T. Shimonishi Y. Yoneda Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3617-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) for 1 h. The filter was washed three times with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and then incubated with alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) for 1 h. After washing with the same buffer followed by TBS, the bound antibodies were detected using an alkaline phosphatase conjugate substrate kit (Bio-Rad). The amplified fragment of Ahr(55–75)wt using F57/R67 as primers encodes the 21-amino acid sequence of PFPQDVINKLDKLSVLRLSVS. GST-Ahr(55–75)wt-GFP or GST-Ahr(55–75)mut-GFP, which have the substitutions of Leu70 and Leu72 for alanines, were injected into MDBK cell nuclei along with Texas Red-labeled BSA, which was coinjected to ensure a clean nuclear injection without leakage. Cells were either injected then and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min or were equilibrated to 4 °C for 15 min, injected, and then incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. After incubation, the cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, for 15 min, and localization was observed by fluorescent microscopy. The NES peptide of PKI corresponding to the sequence of residues 35–49 of NELALKLAGLDINKT was synthesized. The synthetic peptide was conjugated to BSA with the bifunctional cross-linking reagent sulfosuccinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)-cyclohexane-1-carboxylate. To study the molecular mechanism of ligand- and NLS-dependent nuclear translocation of Ahr, fusion protein composed of β-gal and full-length Ahr was transiently expressed in HeLa, Hepa-1, and ARNT-deficient Hepa-1 c4 mutant cells. Representative profiles of expressed fusion proteins visualized byin situ staining of β-gal with X-gal are shown in Fig. 1 A. No staining of the nucleus was observed for the expressed β-gal alone (Fig. 1 A, a), whereas the fusion protein of β-gal with the NLS of SV40 large T antigen (β-gal/SV40 NLS) showed strong nuclear localization in transfected cells (Fig. 1 A, b). When the chimeric gene of β-gal/Ahr(1–848) was expressed in the absence of MC, the fusion protein was localized in the cytoplasm. However, when the chimeric gene was expressed in the presence of MC, the fused product was clearly localized in the nucleus of all three cell lines tested even in the ARNT-deficient Hepa-1 c4 mutant (Fig. 1 A, c). To determine the region of Ahr required for nuclear localization, various portions of the human Ahr cDNA were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and ligated to a modified β-gal expression vector. The chimeric constructs were introduced into HeLa cells, and their localization was examined (Fig. 1 B). Deletion of the transactivation domain located in the COOH-terminal portion did not affect the MC-dependent nuclear localization (Fig. 1 B, b). However, when both transactivation and PAS domains were deleted, resulting in a lack of the ligand and hsp90 binding domains (37Whitelaw M.L. Göttlicher M. Gustafsson J.-Å. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4169-4173Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), the fused product was clearly detected in the nucleus regardless of the absence or presence of MC (Fig. 1 B, c). In contrast, fusion proteins of either β-gal/Ahr(120–386) (Fig. 1 B, d) or β-gal/Ahr(387–848) (Fig. 1 B, e) showed cytoplasmic localization irrespective of the ligand, confirming the absence of NLS in these regions. Because the NLS identified so far contained a cluster(s) of basic amino acids, two candidates of NLS of Ahr can be estimated in the NH2-terminal portion (Ahr(1–119)), one of which is located between 13 and 17 (RKRRK), and the other is between 37 and 42 (KRHRDR) in the bHLH domain. Accordingly, we focused our attention on the relationship between the two clusters of basic amino acids in the NH2-terminal portion. Fig. 2 A shows a schematic representation of Ahr(1–42), which includes the two clusters of basic amino acids. When a chimeric gene of β-gal/Ahr(1–42) was expressed transiently in the absence of MC, the fusion protein was localized in the nucleus visualized both by in situ staining with X-gal (Fig. 2 B, a) or by immunohistochemical staining with antibody to Ahr (Fig. 2 B, b). The weak cytoplasmic staining by the antibody may be explained either by the endogenous expression of Ahr in HeLa cells or nonspecific interaction between the antibody and cells (Fig. 2 B, c). To confirm the direct nuclear translocation activity of Ahr(1–42), we next examined the fate of purified recombinant protein of GST-Ahr(1–42)-GFP microinjected into the cytoplasm of HeLa cells as described previously (11Eguchi H. Ikuta T. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Kawajiri K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17640-17647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). As was seen for the transient expression of β-gal fusions (Fig. 2 B, a and b), the GST-GFP fusion protein showed efficient nuclear localization within a 30-min incubation at 37 °C (Fig. 2 B, d), confirming that the fragment serves as an NLS. To determine the minimum length of NLS of Ahr, we first constructed a plasmid by insertion of the Ahr(13–42) fragment into the fusion gene of GST-GFP, using a minimum fragment containing two complete clusters of basic amino acids. A representative profile of nuclear localization of the microinjected fusion protein is shown in Fig. 3 A, a). Next, GST-GFP fused proteins, which contain a series of deleted fragments from the COOH or NH2 terminus of Ahr(13–42), were purified and microinjected into the cytoplasm of the HeLa cells (Fig. 3 A). When amino acid residues from Arg42 to Arg40 were deleted successively from the COOH terminus of Ahr(13–42), clear nuclear localization was observed (Fig. 3 A, b–d). However, when a deletion from Arg42 to His39 was carried out, both nuclear and cytoplasmic localizations were observed (Fig. 3 A, e). On the other hand, GST-Ahr(13–37)-GFP did not translocate to the nucleus (Fig. 3 A, f). We next constructed a deletion mutant of NH2-terminal Arg13 and found clear cytoplasmic localization of the gene product (Fig. 3 A, g), showing that Arg13 was unequivocally essential for the nuclear translocation of Ahr. Furthermore, when the two separated basic regions were linked directly (Ahr 13–42, Δ19–35), the fusion protein was localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3 A, h), indicating that amino acids between 19 and 35 were also required as spacers to provide enough length between the two separated clusters of basic amino acids to interact with the"
https://openalex.org/W2047277690,"Cyr61 is a member of a family of growth factor-inducible immediate-early gene products thought to act cooperatively with the activities of growth factors. Upon synthesis, Cyr61 is secreted and is predominantly incorporated into the extracellular matrix. Recently, we demonstrated that Cyr61 promotes cell adhesion and migration and augments growth factor-induced DNA synthesis (Kireeva, M. L., Mo, F.-E., Yang, G. P., and Lau, L. F. (1996) Mol. Cell. Biol. 16, 1326–1334). In the present study, we investigated possible candidate receptor(s) on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) mediating adhesion to Cyr61. Under both serum-containing and serum-free conditions, adhesion of HUVECs to Cyr61 was dose-dependent, saturable, and abolished by affinity-purified anti-Cyr61 antibodies. Cell adhesion to Cyr61 was divalent cation-dependent and specifically inhibited by the peptide RGDS and LM609, a monoclonal antibody against integrin αvβ3. Furthermore, purified αvβ3 bound directly to an affinity matrix of Cyr61-coupled Sepharose 4B, and this interaction was specifically blocked by anti-Cyr61 antibodies. Additionally, in a solid phase binding assay, soluble Cyr61 bound to immobilized αvβ3 in a dose-dependent manner, and half-saturation binding occurred at approximately 5 nm Cyr61. As expected, the interaction of Cyr61 with immobilized αvβ3 was blocked by RGDS and LM609. In sum, these results identified Cyr61 as a novel ligand for αvβ3 and indicate that the adhesion of HUVECs to Cyr61 is mediated through interaction with this integrin. The possibility that integrin αvβ3 functions as a signaling receptor for Cyr61 accounts for most if not all activities that can be ascribed to Cyr61 to date and suggests a mechanism of action discussed herein.

The possibility that integrin αvβ3 functions as a signaling receptor for Cyr61 accounts for most if not all activities that can be ascribed to Cyr61 to date and suggests a mechanism of action discussed herein. One of the primary cellular responses to the actions of polypeptide growth factors is the rapid and transient activation of a set of immediate-early genes, the expression of which is thought to be involved in mediating the biological responses of the growth factors (1Lau L.F. Nathans D. Cohen P. Foulkes J.G. Molecular Aspects of Cellular Regulation, Vol. 6. Hormonal Regulation of Transcription.

Among the immediate-early genes identified in fibroblasts iscyr61 (3O'Brien T.P. Yang G.P. Sanders L. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3569-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), which encodes a secreted cysteine-rich and heparin-binding protein associated with the extracellular matrix (ECM) 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin. 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin. or with the cell surface (4Yang G.P. Lau L.F. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 351-357PubMed Google Scholar). In a recent study, we reported the purification of recombinant Cyr61 and its biological activities in cell culture systems. Thus, Cyr61 promotes cell adhesion, stimulates cell migration, and augments growth factor-induced DNA synthesis (5Kireeva M.L. Mo F.-E. Yang G.P. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1326-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Fisp12, a closely related protein also encoded by an immediate-early gene in fibroblasts (6Ryseck R.-P. Macdonald-Bravo H. Mattei M.-G. Bravo R. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 225-233PubMed Google Scholar), has indistinguishable activities (7Kireeva M.L. Latinkic B.V. Kolesnikova T.V. Chen C.-C. Yang G.P. Abler A.S. Lau L.F. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 233: 63-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). During embryogenesis, Cyr61 exhibits a temporally restricted and tissue-specific distribution that closely associates with the development of cartilage and the circulatory system (8O'Brien T.P. Lau L.F. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 645-654PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this expression pattern, Cyr61 promotes the differentiation of mouse limb bud mesenchymal cells into chondrocytes in micromass cultures (9Wong M. Kireeva M.L. Kolesnikova T.V. Lau L.F. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 492-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that Cyr61 functions as a downstream regulator of growth factor actions, possibly by acting as an ECM-associated signaling molecule to regulate physiological processes involving cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and differentiation.The biological activities of Cyr61 suggest that it might interact with a cell surface receptor. The ability of Cyr61 to mediate cell adhesion and a strict requirement for divalent cations in this process (5Kireeva M.L. Mo F.-E. Yang G.P. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1326-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) are consistent with the possible interaction of Cyr61 with one of the divalent cation-dependent cell adhesion receptors of the integrin, selectin, or cadherin families (10Ruoslahti E. Obrink B. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 227: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 11Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8966) Google Scholar, 12Cummings R.D.

Selectins and cadherins are primarily involved in cell-cell interactions. Integrins, on the other hand, are a large family of heterodimeric adhesion receptors involved in both cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions (11Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8966) Google Scholar). In addition to serving as cell adhesion receptors, integrins also play an essential role in cell motility (14Damsky C.H. Werb Z. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 772-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 15Doerr M.E. Jones J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2443-2447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Furthermore, integrin occupancy and clustering induces signaling cascades that intersect with growth factor-induced signaling processes that regulate cell proliferation and differentiation (16Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar, 17Juliano R.L. Haskill S. J.

Based on these considerations, we hypothesized that Cyr61 might interact with an integrin receptor, thereby promoting cell adhesion and migration as well as augmenting growth factor-induced DNA synthesis. In the present study, by examining the effect of inhibitors of integrin αvβ3 on cell adhesion and in vitro protein binding assays, we investigated the possibility that adhesion of HUVECs to Cyr61 is mediated through direct interaction of Cyr61 and integrin αvβ3.DISCUSSIONCyr61, encoded by a growth factor-inducible immediate-early gene, belongs to an emerging family of extracellular signaling proteins in which members (e.g. Cyr61 and Fisp12) have been shown to promote cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation (5Kireeva M.L. Mo F.-E. Yang G.P. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1326-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 7Kireeva M.L. Latinkic B.V. Kolesnikova T.V. Chen C.-C. Yang G.P. Abler A.S. Lau L.F. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 233: 63-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of Cyr61 and other members of this protein family revealed four conserved domains sharing homology with 1) insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins, 2) von Willebrand Factor type C domain, 3) heparin-binding proteins, and 4) the C-terminal domains of some types of collagens and mucins (30Bork P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). To date, a cell surface receptor for these proteins has not been identified. In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which Cyr61 mediates HUVEC adhesion and identified integrin αvβ3 as a cell surface receptor for Cyr61. This conclusion is based on both functional and biochemical evidence: 1) HUVEC adhesion to Cyr61 was inhibited by EDTA, an RGD-containing peptide, and the anti-αvβ3monoclonal antibody LM609; and 2) purified integrin αvβ3 bound specifically to an Cyr61-coupled affinity matrix, and conversely, purified Cyr61 interacted directly with immobilized αvβ3 in a solid phase receptor binding assay.Integrin αvβ3 binds to a broad spectrum of both RGD-containing and non-RGD-containing ligands (26Brooks P.C. Stromblad S. Sanders L.C. von Schalscha T.L. Aimes R.T. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Quigley J.P. Cheresh D.A.

Imhof B.A. J Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The primary sequence of Cyr61 does not contain the RGD recognition motif present in αvβ3 ligands such as vitronectin, fibronectin, fibrinogen, thrombospondin, and osteopontin (31Ruoslahti E. Pierschbacher M.D. Science. 1987; 238: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (3841) Google Scholar). In addition to Cyr61, at least two other αvβ3 ligands also do not contain an RGD sequence: a cell surface molecule from the immunoglobulin superfamily CD31/PECAM-1 (32Piali L. Hammel P. Uherek C. Bachmann F. Gisler R.H. Dunon D. Imhof B.A. J Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) and metalloproteinase MMP-2 (26Brooks P.C. Stromblad S.

However, RGD peptides block the interaction between integrin αvβ3 and these proteins. Similar inhibition of Cyr61 binding to αvβ3 by RGDS was also observed in the present study. The inhibitory effect of RGD peptides may be due to conformational changes of αvβ3 upon RGD occupancy, thus masking other binding sites in the receptor for these non-RGD-containing proteins.The ability of Cyr61 to mediate HUVEC adhesion was observed under both serum-free and serum-containing conditions (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). Within a short adhesion period (15 min), vitronectin was capable of inhibiting HUVEC adhesion to Cyr61, consistent with competition of these proteins for binding to the same receptor. However, inhibition was not observed when cell adhesion was allowed to proceed for a longer period (30 min) (Fig. 4). This is likely due to the nonequilibrium nature of cell adhesion to immobilized substrates mediated through αvβ3 (28Orlando R.A. Cheresh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19543-19550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that HUVECs adhered to Cyr61 via αvβ3 when challenged with 50 μg/ml vitronectin (Fig. 4) or 10% serum (Fig. 5) indicate that Cyr61 may function as a physiological adhesion substrate even in the presence of RGD-containing αvβ3ligands.Although it is currently unclear how Cyr61 interacts with αvβ3, studies employing phage display libraries have revealed sequences other than RGD capable of binding to the integrins αvβ3 and α5β1 (33Koivunen E.

Furthermore, data from studies on disintegrins and phage display libraries indicate that certain peptide sequences bind integrins with substantially higher affinity when cyclized via disulfide bonding (33Koivunen E.

In this regard, the processed, secreted Cyr61 contains 38 cysteine residues, thereby providing the possibility of creating cyclized sequences that interact with αvβ3. Identification of the recognition sequence within Cyr61 would be essential for our understanding of the ligand diversity of the αvβ3 integrin, as well as the structure-function relationship of the newly discovered Cyr61 family of growth-related proteins.The inducible expression of Cyr61 by growth factors suggests that Cyr61 may function as a transient and localized signaling molecule regulating biological processes in which cell adhesion plays a role. Cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation are examples of such processes. Although we have established that the cell adhesive properties of Cyr61 are mediated through interaction with integrin αvβ3, whether other activities of Cyr61 are also manifested through the same receptor is not yet known. It is tempting, however, to speculate that the chemotactic and proliferative activities of Cyr61 may also be mediated through the αvβ3 integrin. Although these processes involve much more complex cellular responses than adhesion, they are completely consistent with the capabilities of integrins to induce these signaling events. In this regard, it is widely accepted that cell adhesion receptors are crucial for cell migration (10Ruoslahti E. Obrink B. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 227: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 15Doerr M.E. Jones J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2443-2447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and the regulation of integrin affinity to proteins in the ECM is likely a driving force of cell migration (40Palecek S.P. Loftus J.C. Ginsberg M.H. Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Nature. 1997; 385: 537-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar, 41Lawson M.A. Maxfield F.R. Nature. 1995; 376: 75-79Crossref Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Therefore, the modulation of the affinity of integrin αvβ3 toward Cyr61 and other ligands in the ECM may account for the chemotactic activity of Cyr61. The participation of integrins in modulation of growth factor-mediated signaling is also well established (16Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar, 17Juliano R.L. Haskill S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1527) Google Scholar). For example, regulation of cell cycle progression by β1 integrins (42Bohmer R.-M. Scharf E. Assoian R.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 43Meredith J.E.

Science. 1994; 266: 1576-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 46Bartfeld N.S. Pasquale E.B. Geltosky J.E. Languino L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17270-17276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have been reported. Consistent with the observation that Cyr61 is able to augment basic fibroblast growth factor-induced and platelet-derived growth factor-induced DNA synthesis (5Kireeva M.L. Mo F.-E. Yang G.P. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1326-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), integrin- and growth factor-induced signaling cascades have been shown to intersect and converge (16Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar, 17Juliano R.L. Haskill S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1527) Google Scholar, 47Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsburg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar).The finding that Cyr61 interacts with integrin αvβ3 also provides insights into its possible biological functions. Although Cyr61 is a secreted protein, it is tightly associated with the ECM and the cell surface upon secretion and is thus likely to act locally in either an autocrine or a paracrine fashion (4Yang G.P. Lau L.F. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 351-357PubMed Google Scholar). During development, Cyr61 is highly expressed in the placenta, most notably in the trophoblastic giant cells and trophoblasts of the ectoplacental cone (8O'Brien T.P. Lau L.F. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 645-654PubMed Google Scholar). αvβ3 is the only integrin found to be expressed on the apical surface of trophoblasts and on the uterine epithelium during the period of receptivity for implantation (48Lessey B.A. Damjanovich L. Coutifaris C. Castelbaum A. Alberda S.M. Buck C.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 49Sutherland A.E. Calarco P.G. Damsky C.H. Development. 1993; 119: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and αvβ3 continues to be expressed in the trophoblastic giant cells and ectoplacental cone in later stages (49Sutherland A.E. Calarco P.G. Damsky C.H. Development. 1993; 119: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,50Cross J.C. Werb Z. Fisher S.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1508-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). Because Cyr61 is likely to be deposited from the trophectoderm onto the neighboring matrix, it can be hypothesized that interaction between Cyr61 and αvβ3 may help to mediate attachment of the embyro to the endometrium through cell-matrix interactions. Furthermore, in the post-implantation embryo, Cyr61 interaction with αvβ3 may mediate attachment to the decidua. In addition, because Cyr61 has been shown to promote chondrogenesis to form the embryonic skeleton (9Wong M. Kireeva M.L. Kolesnikova T.V. Lau L.F. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 492-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), the presence of both Cyr61 (8O'Brien T.P. Lau L.F. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 645-654PubMed Google Scholar, 9Wong M. Kireeva M.L. Kolesnikova T.V. Lau L.F. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 492-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and αvβ3 (51Woods V.L. Schreck P.J. Gesink D.S. Pacheco H.O. Amiel D. Akeson W.H. Lotz M. Arthritis Rheum. 1994; 37: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) in chondrocytes suggests that their interaction may play a role in this process. In the circulatory system, Cyr61 and αvβ3 are coexpressed in vascular smooth muscle cells (8O'Brien T.P. Lau L.F. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 645-654PubMed Google Scholar, 52Jones J.I. Gockerman A. Clemmons D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2482-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and in microvascular endothelial cells (53Sepp N.T. Li L.J. Lee K.H. Brown E.J. Caughman S.W. Lawley T.J. Swerlick R.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 103: 295-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). 2C. C. Chen and L. F. Lau, unpublished observations. In HUVECs, we previously demonstrated that Cyr61 mediates cell adhesion and augments basic fibroblast growth factor-induced DNA synthesis (5Kireeva M.L. Mo F.-E. Yang G.P. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1326-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 54Latinkic, B. V., Regulation of Expression of Growth Factor-inducible Immediate-Early Genes cyr61 and pip92Ph.D. thesis, 1994, The University of Illinois at Chicago.Google Scholar). Because basic fibroblast growth factor, which induces angiogenesis, activates the synthesis of both Cyr61 (3O'Brien T.P. Yang G.P. Sanders L. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3569-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 55Lau L.F. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1182-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) and αvβ3 (53Sepp N.T. Li L.J. Lee K.H. Brown E.J. Caughman S.W. Lawley T.J. Swerlick R.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 103: 295-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), these observations suggest that Cyr61 may be involved in angiogenesis during wound repair. In this regard, αvβ3 has been shown to mediate angiogenesis in chicken chorioallantoic membrane (56Brooks P.C. Clark R.A.F. Cheresh D.A. Science. 1994; 264: 569-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (2717) Google Scholar) and basic fibroblast growth factor-induced neovascularization in rabbit cornea (57Friedlander M. Brooks P.C. Shaffer R.W. Kincaid C.M. Varner J.A. Cheresh D.A. Science. 1995; 270: 1500-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). Our finding that Cyr61 is a ligand for αvβ3 is consistent with its potential role in growth factor-induced angiogenesis.In sum, we demonstrated that integrin αvβ3serves as an adhesion receptor for Cyr61 on HUVECs. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that Cyr61 may also bind to other cell surface molecules, such as heparan sulfate proteoglycans and growth factor receptors, the interaction of Cyr61 with integrin αvβ3 may account for most, if not all, of the ascribed physiological activities of Cyr61 to date. Thus, Cyr61 and other members of its family may represent a novel class of signaling molecules, providing additional functional links between the growth factor-dependent and matrix-dependent signaling events. One of the primary cellular responses to the actions of polypeptide growth factors is the rapid and transient activation of a set of immediate-early genes, the expression of which is thought to be involved in mediating the biological responses of the growth factors (1Lau L.F. Nathans D. Cohen P. Foulkes J.G. Molecular Aspects of Cellular Regulation, Vol. 6. Hormonal Regulation of Transcription. Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam1991: 257-293Google Scholar, 2Herschman H.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 281-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). Among the immediate-early genes identified in fibroblasts iscyr61 (3O'Brien T.P. Yang G.P. Sanders L. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3569-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), which encodes a secreted cysteine-rich and heparin-binding protein associated with the extracellular matrix (ECM) 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin. 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin. or with the cell surface (4Yang G.P. Lau L.F. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 351-357PubMed Google Scholar). In a recent study, we reported the purification of recombinant Cyr61 and its biological activities in cell culture systems. Thus, Cyr61 promotes cell adhesion, stimulates cell migration, and augments growth factor-induced DNA synthesis (5Kireeva M.L. Mo F.-E. Yang G.P. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1326-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Fisp12, a closely related protein also encoded by an immediate-early gene in fibroblasts (6Ryseck R.-P. Macdonald-Bravo H. Mattei M.-G. Bravo R. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 225-233PubMed Google Scholar), has indistinguishable activities (7Kireeva M.L. Latinkic B.V. Kolesnikova T.V. Chen C.-C. Yang G.P. Abler A.S. Lau L.F. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 233: 63-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). During embryogenesis, Cyr61 exhibits a temporally restricted and tissue-specific distribution that closely associates with the development of cartilage and the circulatory system (8O'Brien T.P. Lau L.F. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 645-654PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this expression pattern, Cyr61 promotes the differentiation of mouse limb bud mesenchymal cells into chondrocytes in micromass cultures (9Wong M. Kireeva M.L. Kolesnikova T.V. Lau L.F. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 492-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that Cyr61 functions as a downstream regulator of growth factor actions, possibly by acting as an ECM-associated signaling molecule to regulate physiological processes involving cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and differentiation. The biological activities of Cyr61 suggest that it might interact with a cell surface receptor. The ability of Cyr61 to mediate cell adhesion and a strict requirement for divalent cations in this process (5Kireeva M.L. Mo F.-E. Yang G.P. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1326-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) are consistent with the possible interaction of Cyr61 with one of the divalent cation-dependent cell adhesion receptors of the integrin, selectin, or cadherin families (10Ruoslahti E. Obrink B. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 227: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 11Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8966) Google Scholar, 12Cummings R.D.

Selectins and cadherins are primarily involved in cell-cell interactions. Integrins, on the other hand, are a large family of heterodimeric adhesion receptors involved in both cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions (11Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8966) Google Scholar). In addition to serving as cell adhesion receptors, integrins also play an essential role in cell motility (14Damsky C.H. Werb Z. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 772-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 15Doerr M.E. Jones J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2443-2447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Furthermore, integrin occupancy and clustering induces signaling cascades that intersect with growth factor-induced signaling processes that regulate cell proliferation and differentiation (16Clark E.A.

The activated receptor initiates a kinase cascade that ultimately activates members of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family. These MAP kinases translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription factors, thus influencing the growth responses of the cell. A well defined pathway activated by the EGF receptor is the Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway (1Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). Following the assembly of Grb2-Sos-Ras complexes at the cell membrane, a sequential phosphorylation cascade involving Raf, MEK, and then ERK occurs (2Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4243) Google Scholar). Activation of the ERK family of MAP kinases can then induce cell cycle progression (2Marshall C.J.

Several parallel pathways of this kinase cascade have been identified in mammals, including the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK; also called stress-activated protein kinase) pathway (3Cano E.

The immediate activators of JNK, generically known as MAP kinase kinases, are MKK4 (4Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J.

A. 1997; 94: 7337-7342Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Although both ERKs and JNKs are activated in a similar manner, they define distinct pathways that respond to different extracellular stimuli. ERKs are preferentially activated in response to mitogens, whereas JNKs are potently activated by cytokines and environmental stresses (1Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). JNK activity in response to stress is associated with the induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (8Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar, 9Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I.

Chem. 1996; 271: 31929-31936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Although different stimuli preferentially activate specific MAP kinase pathways, a modest level of cross-activation of different MAP kinase pathways can result from the same stimulus (10Chen Y.-R.

Gerwins P. Elliott E.M. Sather S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5361-5368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Aside from the use of a particular pathway, the duration of MAP kinase activity can also determine the physiological response of a cell. For example, transient induction of JNKs provides a growth enhancement signal, whereas persistent activity due to UV light or γ-irradiation induces apoptosis (10Chen Y.-R. Wang X. Templeton D. Davis R.J. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31929-31936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding was the observation that ERK and JNK activation had opposing effects on cell survival in PC12 cells. Differentiated PC12 cells deprived of nerve growth factor underwent programmed cell death that was dependent on the down-regulation of ERK activity and was coupled with increased JNK activity (8Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the EGF receptor has been implicated in the progression of numerous types of human cancers, including breast carcinomas and astrocytic neoplasms (15Harris A.L. Nicholson S. Sainsbury R. Wright C. Farndon J. Natl. Cancer Inst. Monogr. 1992; 11: 181-187Google Scholar, 16Schlegel J. Merdes A. Stumm G. Albert F.K. Forsting M. Hynes N. Kiessling M. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 56: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Transfection of the normal EGF receptor into fibroblast cell lines induces ligand-dependent transformation (17Moscatello D.K. Montgomery R.B. Sundareshan P. McDanel H. Wong M.Y. Wong A.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 85-96PubMed Google Scholar), providing a model in which to study the oncogenic effects of the receptor. The addition of EGF to cells overexpressing the normal EGF receptor induces a transient but potent activation of ERK (17Moscatello D.K. Montgomery R.B. Sundareshan P. McDanel H. Wong M.Y. Wong A.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 85-96PubMed Google Scholar, 18Montgomery R.B. Moscatello D.K. Wong A.J. Cooper J.A. Stahl W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30562-30566Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This signaling scheme has been established for many receptor tyrosine kinases and is associated with positive growth responses in cells (19Hunter T. Cell. 1997; 88: 333-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). In addition to overexpression of the normal EGF receptor, many rearrangements of the EGF receptor have been identified in human glial tumors (20Wong A.J. Ruppert J.M. Bigner S.H. Grzeschik C.H. Humphey P.A. Bigner D.S. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2965-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar, 21Ekstrand A.J. Longo N. Hamid M.L. Olson J.J. Liu L. Collins V.P. James C.D. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2313-2320PubMed Google Scholar). The most common of these spontaneously occurring mutant EGF receptors, known as EGFRvIII, has been studied extensively (20Wong A.J. Ruppert J.M. Bigner S.H. Grzeschik C.H. Humphey P.A. Bigner D.S. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2965-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar, 21Ekstrand A.J. Longo N. Hamid M.L. Olson J.J. Liu L. Collins V.P. James C.D.

Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5536-5539PubMed Google Scholar). EGFRvIII arises from an in-frame deletion of nucleotides 276–1075 in the normal EGF receptor cDNA (20Wong A.J. Ruppert J.M. Bigner S.H. Grzeschik C.H. Humphey P.A. Bigner D.S. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2965-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). The resulting truncated receptor is similar to the normal EGF receptor in its ability to dimerize and autophosphorylate (18Montgomery R.B. Moscatello D.K. Wong A.J. Cooper J.A. Stahl W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30562-30566Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 23Huang H.-J.S. Nagane M. Klingbeil C.K. Lin H. Nishikawa R. Ji X.-D. Huang C.-M. Gill G.N. Wiley H.S. Cavenee W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2927-2935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). However, EGFRvIII is distinct from the normal receptor in that it does not bind EGF and thus is an unregulated, constitutively active kinase (18Montgomery R.B. Moscatello D.K. Wong A.J. Cooper J.A. Stahl W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30562-30566Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 23Huang H.-J.S. Nagane M. Klingbeil C.K. Lin H. Nishikawa R. Ji X.-D. Huang C.-M. Gill G.N. Wiley H.S. Cavenee W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2927-2935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Expression of EGFRvIII in NIH3T3 cells causes a highly transformed phenotype (17Moscatello D.K. Montgomery R.B. Sundareshan P. McDanel H. Wong M.Y. Wong A.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 85-96PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the fact that this receptor activates MEK, the immediate activator of ERK, there is a low basal level of ERK activity in cells expressing EGFRvIII (17Moscatello D.K. Montgomery R.B. Sundareshan P. McDanel H. Wong M.Y. Wong A.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 85-96PubMed Google Scholar, 18Montgomery R.B. Moscatello D.K. Wong A.J. Cooper J.A. Stahl W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30562-30566Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This implies that the down-regulation of ERK occurs at the MAP kinase level itself, most likely by increased expression of a phosphatase. Down-regulation of the ERK MAP kinase pathway in other types of transformed cells has also been reported (24Greulich H. Reichman C. Hanafusa H. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1689-1695PubMed Google Scholar, 25Stofega M.R. Yu C.-L. Jove R. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 113-119PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we found that phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase is constitutively active in EGFRvIII-transformed cells and that this activity is required for colony formation in soft agar (26Moscatello D.K. Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Montgomery R.B. Wong A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 200-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PI 3-kinase has been implicated in the activation of the JNK pathway (27Klippel A. Reinhard C. Kavanaugh W.M. Apell G. Escobedo M.-A. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4117-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 28Kobayashi M. Nagata S. Kita Y. Nakatsu N. Ihara S. Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S. Ui M. Iba H. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Saitoh I. Fukui Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16089-16092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We have investigated JNK activity in NIH3T3 cells expressing EGFRvIII and have found a high basal activity. Inhibition of EGFRvIII or PI 3-kinase activity down-regulated JNK activity, which was correlated with a loss of transformed morphology. Despite this chronic high level of JNK activity and the low level of ERK activity, these cells have a low rate of apoptosis. Cell culture media and recombinant human EGF were from Life Technologies, Inc. Tyrphostin AG 1478 (Calbiochem) and LY 294002 (BIOMOL Research Laboratories Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA) were dissolved in Me2SO to a concentration of 20 mmand stored at −80 °C. [γ-32P]ATP,125I-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG, and125I-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG were from NEN Life Science Products. Unlabeled ATP was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. The anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody PY20 and the anti-pan-ERK monoclonal antibody were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The anti-JNK1(C-17) polyclonal antibody was from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and the anti-phospho-p44/p42 MAP kinase monoclonal antibody was from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). All other materials were from Fisher unless otherwise indicated. CO12 20c2/b, HC2 20d2/c, and LTR b2 clones were generated by transfection of NIH3T3 cells with the cDNA encoding the normal human EGF receptor, the EGFRvIII cDNA, and vector only, respectively (17Moscatello D.K. Montgomery R.B. Sundareshan P. McDanel H. Wong M.Y. Wong A.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 85-96PubMed Google Scholar). The NIH3T3 transfectants were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 μg/ml kanamycin, and 350 μg/ml G418. Cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed with 1 ml of cell lysis buffer (10 mm Na2HPO4, 150 mmNaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.2% NaH3, 0.004% NaF, 1 mm NaVO4, 25 mm β-glycerophosphoric acid, 100 μg/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin, pH 7.35). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay. Total cell lysate (30 μg) of each sample was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 8.5% acrylamide gels for resolution of MAP kinases and 4–20% Tris/glycine gels for resolution of the EGF receptor. Protein was transferred to nitrocellulose filters and blocked for 2 h at room temperature in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.9% NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 with 5% nonfat dry milk. The anti-phospho-MAP kinase monoclonal antibody was used at a 1:1000 dilution, whereas the anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody, the anti-pan-ERK monoclonal antibody, and the anti-JNK1 polyclonal antibody were used at 1 μg/ml in the same blocking solution. 125I-Labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (5 × 105 cpm/ml) was used to detect the monoclonal antibodies, and 125I-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG was used to detect the polyclonal antibodies. Quantitation of signals was performed on a PhosphorImager using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Soft agar assays were performed as described previously (17Moscatello D.K. Montgomery R.B. Sundareshan P. McDanel H. Wong M.Y. Wong A.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 85-96PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modification. Briefly, cells were fed 1 ml of fresh medium once a week for 3 weeks and treated with 0.1 or 1 μm tyrphostin AG 1478 every 3 days. After 3 weeks of growth, the colonies were counted. GST-c-Jun (amino acids 1–79) was bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). JNK was precipitated from 300 μg of whole cell extracts with GST-c-Jun for 3 h at 4 °C. Precipitates were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 2 mm NaVO4 and rinsed once in kinase reaction buffer (25 mm Hepes, 25 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm NaVO4, and 25 mm β-glycerophosphoric acid). JNK activity was assayed by resuspending the pellets in 30 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 20 μm unlabeled ATP. Following a 20-min incubation at 30 °C, samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose, and kinase activity was quantitated using the PhosphorImager. Cells were seeded on coverslips in 6-well dishes and grown in complete medium for 3 days. The cells were then incubated in serum-free DMEM containing either 2 μmtyrphostin AG 1478 or 5 μm LY 294002 for 1 or 3 days and fixed and stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (2 μg/ml) for viewing by fluorescence microscopy. Apoptotic cells were identified by condensed nuclei. Previous work on the signaling effects of EGFRvIII in NIH3T3 fibroblasts showed that ERK activity was down-regulated (17Moscatello D.K. Montgomery R.B. Sundareshan P. McDanel H. Wong M.Y. Wong A.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 85-96PubMed Google Scholar, 18Montgomery R.B. Moscatello D.K. Wong A.J. Cooper J.A. Stahl W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30562-30566Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), suggesting that signaling though the Ras/ERK pathway was not required for transformation. We wished to investigate whether an additional MAP kinase pathway was affected by the signaling of EGFRvIII. We chose to study the effect of the mutant receptor on the JNK pathway. JNKs are defined in general by their ability to phosphorylate two serine residues in the amino-terminal domain of c-Jun in vitro (29Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar, 30Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1996; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (2957) Google Scholar). These enzymes have a high affinity for this substrate, so a solid-phase kinase assay utilizing GST-c-Jun (amino acids 1–79) as a substrate for JNK allows measurement of the kinase activity associated with a cell lysate. We employed this technique to compare JNK activity in NIH3T3 cells transfected with an empty expression vector (LTR b2); the normal human EGF receptor (CO12 20c2/b); and the mutant EGF receptor, EGFRvIII (HC2 20d2/c). Unstimulated LTR b2 and CO12 20c2/b cells exhibited very low levels of JNK activity that was modestly enhanced by the addition of EGF (100 ng/ml). In contrast, unstimulated HC2 20d2/c cells had a 13-fold higher JNK activity relative to unstimulated LTR b2 cells (Fig. 1, Kinase Assay), indicating a high constitutive JNK activity in these cells. The addition of EGF to HC2 20d2/c cells did not alter the level of JNK activity, which is consistent with the report that EGFRvIII cannot bind EGF and so is not influenced by this mitogen (18Montgomery R.B. Moscatello D.K. Wong A.J. Cooper J.A. Stahl W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30562-30566Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis showed that JNK expression was nearly equivalent in all three cell lines (Fig. 1, αJNK), indicating that the increased JNK activity is not due to the up-regulation of protein expression. Osmotic stress is known to potently induce JNK activity and can be used to measure the maximum potential in vivo activity of this kinase. Osmotic stress was induced by incubation of cell lines for 15 min in DMEM containing 500 mm sorbitol. This potently increased JNK activity in the transfected cell lines relative to EGF stimulation (Fig. 1). Sorbitol-treated HC2 20d2/c cells achieved the highest level of JNK activation, indicating that the signaling pathway leading to JNK activation was also enhanced in these cells. ERK activities were determined for LTR b2, CO12 20c2/b, and HC2 20d2/c cell lines under the same conditions used to analyze JNK activity. ERK activity was measured using an antibody that specifically recognizes the phosphorylated forms of ERK1/2. Consistent with earlier findings, EGF stimulation of CO12 20c2/b cells activated ERK, whereas unstimulated or EGF-treated HC2 20d2/c cells had undetectable levels of ERK activity (Fig. 1, αActive MAPK) despite equivalent protein expression (Fig. 1, αERK). The anti-ERK antibody also revealed a slower mobility form of ERK in this blot (Fig. 1, αERK) that corresponds to the active form of ERK, but the anti-active MAP kinase antibody appeared to be more sensitive at detecting activated ERK. Incubation of cells with sorbitol had no detectable effect on ERK activation in HC2 20d2/c cells and showed only a slight increase in LTR b2 cells (Fig. 1, αActive MAPK). However, sorbitol-treated CO12 20c2/b cells did show substantial ERK activation. The exaggerated JNK and ERK activation observed in sorbitol-treated CO12 20c2/b cells relative to LTR b2 cells suggests that the EGF receptor may enhance the response of NIH3T3 cells to osmotic stress. It has been reported that sorbitol treatment of HeLa cells can result in EGF receptor phosphorylation (13Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). We tested if the increases in ERK and JNK activities induced by osmotic shock in our cell lines were due to receptor activation. Anti-phosphotyrosine blots revealed that EGF receptor activity in sorbitol-treated CO12 20c2/b and LTR b2 cells was not elevated above basal levels (Fig. 1, αpTyr), whereas EGF stimulation of CO12 20c2/b and LTR b2 resulted in EGF receptor phosphorylation. Taken together, these results indicate that overexpression of the EGF receptor indirectly enhances JNK and ERK responses to stress and further demonstrate the differences in JNK versus ERK activation in cells overexpressing the mutant receptor. Since the constitutive activity of EGFRvIII resulted in a high basal level of JNK activity, we wanted to determine if the normal EGF receptor could produce the same effect when continuously stimulated with ligand. Quiescent CO12 20c2/b cells were stimulated with EGF (100 ng/ml) and assayed at certain intervals for the activation of the EGF receptor, JNK, and ERK. CO12 20c2/b cells stimulated with EGF showed a maximal activation of the EGF receptor at 5 min, which slowly declined to basal levels by 24 h of stimulation (Fig. 2, αpTyr). ERK induction coincided with EGF receptor activation, which was maximal at 5 min of ligand stimulation and declined to undetectable levels by 24 h (Fig. 2, αActive MAPK). Maximal JNK activity was detected after 5 min of EGF stimulation, but was greatly reduced by 1 h (Fig. 2, Kinase Assay). JNK activity was above basal levels up to 48 h of EGF stimulation, but was still well below that seen in HC2 20d2/c cells (Figs. 1 and 2). Other studies (11Kallunki T. Su B. Tsigelny I. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Moore G. Davis R.J. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2996-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 12Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar) and our data have shown that the normal EGF receptor does not strongly activate JNK. We wished to determine if the constitutive JNK activity associated with the HC2 20d2/c cell line was an effect of signaling from the mutant receptor. To examine this, we utilized a specific inhibitor of the EGF receptor, tyrphostin AG 1478. Previous work has shown that HC2 20d2/c cells maintained in 2 μm tyrphostin AG 1478 for 3 days and then serum-starved for 10 h showed a nearly complete loss of tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFRvIII (26Moscatello D.K. Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Montgomery R.B. Wong A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 200-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Tyrphostin AG 1478 inhibited ERK activation of EGF-treated, but not platelet-derived growth factor-treated, CO12 20c2/b cells, indicating the specificity of the inhibitor for the EGF receptor (26Moscatello D.K. Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Montgomery R.B. Wong A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 200-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). When HC2 20d2/c cells were treated with tyrphostin AG 1478, there was a reduction in JNK activity in association with inhibition of receptor activity (Fig. 3 A, αpTyr and Kinase Assay, 0 time point). To study responses after receptor reactivation, cells were then switched to serum-free DMEM. A transient activation of ERK occurred with the initial reactivation of the mutant receptor. Interestingly, ERK activity was maximal 5 min after release from tyrphostin AG 1478, was dramatically reduced 6 h after release, and declined to undetectable levels within 24 h (Fig. 3 A, αActive MAPK). In contrast to ERKs, JNK activity remained at levels similar to those in HC2 20d2/c cells that had not been released from tyrphostin AG 1478 until after 6 h (Fig. 3 A, Kinase Assay). Increased levels of JNK activity became evident 12 h after release and reached levels that were equivalent to those in untreated HC2 20d2/c cells by 24 h of release. The increased JNK activity following release from tyrphostin AG 1478 correlated with the reestablishment of maximal activity of EGFRvIII (Fig. 3 A, αpTyr). We examined the morphology of these cells after tyrphostin AG 1478 treatment and then following release. Cells treated as described above showed a reversion to the normal planar appearance of fibroblasts. Following release from tyrphostin AG 1478, HC2 20d2/c cells displayed a similar morphology for the first 12 h of release (Fig. 3 B). However, between 12 and 24 h of release, these cells regained their transformed appearance and resembled untreated HC2 20d2/c cells, which coincided with the reactivation of JNK. The reversion of the transformed morphology of HC2 20d2/c cells treated with tyrphostin AG 1478 suggests a reduction or loss of transformation potential. To further analyze this, anchorage-independent growth studies were performed on HC2 20d2/c and CO12 20c2/b cells treated with tyrphostin AG 1478. Both cell lines formed colonies in soft agar when grown in complete medium (Fig. 3 C, CM). Treatment of HC2 20d2/c cells with 0.1 μm tyrphostin AG 1478 resulted in a 37% reduction in colony formation, whereas treatment with 1.0 μmtyrphostin AG 1478 resulted in a 94% inhibition of colony growth. Tyrphostin AG 1478 treatment of CO12 20c2/b cells yielded the same profile seen in tyrphostin AG 1478-treated HC2 20d2/c cells. Colony formation of CO12 20c2/b cells in the presence of 0.1 μmtyrphostin AG 1478 was reduced by 64% and by 92% with 1.0 μm tyrphostin AG 1478 (Fig. 3 C). These data further suggest that the relationship between the constitutive activities of EGFRvIII and JNK is critical for the transformation state of cells expressing this mutant EGF receptor. Our laboratory has recently found that one of the effects of chronic signaling from EGFRvIII is constitutive PI 3-kinase activity (26Moscatello D.K. Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Montgomery R.B. Wong A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 200-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that constitutively active forms of PI 3-kinase activate the JNK pathway (27Klippel A. Reinhard C. Kavanaugh W.M. Apell G. Escobedo M.-A. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4117-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 28Kobayashi M. Nagata S. Kita Y. Nakatsu N. Ihara S. Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S. Ui M. Iba H. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Saitoh I. Fukui Y.

This led us to ask if the high level of PI 3-kinase activity was responsible for the high basal level of JNK activity in HC2 20d2/c cells. HC2 20d2/c and CO12 20c2/b clones were treated with LY 294002, a specific inhibitor of PI 3-kinase activity, in the same manner as described for tyrphostin AG 1478. The inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity in HC2 20d2/c cells resulted in a corresponding reduction in JNK activity without affecting ERK activity (Fig. 4 A). The addition of LY 294002 to HC2 20d2/c cells resulted in a partial morphological reversion and growth inhibition (Fig. 4 B). In a previous publication (26Moscatello D.K. Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Montgomery R.B. Wong A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 200-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), we also found that treatment of HC2 20d2/c cells with 2 and 5 μm LY 294002 caused 71 and 99% reductions in soft agar colony efficiency. Interestingly, the reduction of JNK activity induced in LY 294002-treated HC2 20d2/c cells was nearly equivalent to that seen in tyrphostin AG 1478-treated HC2 20d2/c cells, indicating that the high basal level of JNK activity was dependent on the up-regulated PI 3-kinase activity. JNK and ERK activation levels were also determined in LY 294002-treated CO12 20c2/b cells. EGF-stimulated CO12 20c2/b cells showed similar levels of ERK activation regardless of treatment with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor (Fig. 4 A, αActive MAPK). However, EGF-stimulated CO12 20c2/b cells showed a decrease in JNK activation when compared with cells treated with LY 294002 (Fig. 4 A, Kinase Assay). In PC12 cells, prolonged JNK activity and a loss of ERK activity correlate with the induction of apoptosis (8Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar). HC2 20d2/c cells possess the same enzymatic profile, but, in contrast, are actively growing. Since this is in the presence of serum, we examined HC2 20d2/c cells following 1 and 3 days of serum starvation for the induction of apoptosis and compared the results with LTR b2 cells. Cells were assayed for the presence of nuclear condensation and JNK activity. A small percentage of apoptotic cells was noted in the LTR b2 cell line following 1 day of serum starvation, whereas there was negligible apoptosis in the HC2 20d2/c cell line (Fig. 5, bar graphs). The low basal JNK activity in LTR b2 cells was further decreased after 1 day of serum starvation, whereas the robust activity in HC2 20d2/c cells remained unaltered (Fig. 5, Kinase Assay). After 3 days of serum starvation, there was a large increase in the number of apoptotic cells in the LTR b2 cell line, but only a slight increase in the HC2 20d2/c cell line. JNK activity in LTR b2 cells remained extremely low, whereas there was actually a 77% decrease in HC2 20d2/c cells. Since EGFRvIII and PI 3-kinase contribute to the enhanced growth rate in HC2 20d2/c cells, we examined the effect of tyrphostin AG 1478 and LY 294002 on apoptosis. After 1 day of treatment, tyrphostin AG 1478 showed a small effect on LTR b2 cells, but by 3 days, there was a high percentage of apoptotic cells in both the LTR b2 and HC2 20d2/c cell lines (Fig. 5, bar graphs). LY 294002 also increased the incidence of apoptosis in both cell lines, although not to the same extent. There was no JNK activity in LTR b2 cells in the presence of either inhibitor, whereas there was a 60% decrease in HC2 20d2/c cells (Fig. 5, Kinase Assay). Taken together, these data suggest that EGFRvIII and PI 3-kinase contribute to cell survival, but that JNK activity does not contribute to cell death. Expression of mutant forms of the EGF receptor has been implicated in the progression of many types of human tumors (20Wong A.J. Ruppert J.M. Bigner S.H. Grzeschik C.H. Humphey P.A. Bigner D.S.

Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2313-2320PubMed Google Scholar). EGFRvIII is the most frequently occurring natural alteration associated with this receptor (20Wong A.J. Ruppert J.M. Bigner S.H. Grzeschik C.H.

Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5536-5539PubMed Google Scholar). We studied NIH3T3 fibroblasts transfected with EGFRvIII to elucidate the signaling mechanisms responsible for transformation in these cells. Work in this and other laboratories showed that activation of the normal EGF receptor resulted in a transient but potent ERK induction, whereas EGFRvIII generated minimal ERK induction (17Moscatello D.K. Montgomery R.B. Sundareshan P. McDanel H. Wong M.Y. Wong A.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 85-96PubMed Google Scholar, 18Montgomery R.B. Moscatello D.K. Wong A.J. Cooper J.A. Stahl W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30562-30566Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This low level of ERK activity raised questions as to the significance of the ERK pathway in promoting transformation. Analysis of the JNK pathway showed that EGFRvIII-transfected cells displayed a high constitutive level of JNK activity, which was not present in cells overexpressing the normal EGF receptor. Although stimulation of the EGF receptor can transiently activate JNK, the constitutive activation of JNK seen in EGFRvIII-transfected NIH3T3 cells may define a novel mechanism associated with transformation by this receptor. We have further defined the pathway by identifying PI 3-kinase as the upstream activator of JNK. Interestingly, EGFRvIII was recently shown to constitutively activate PI 3-kinase, and this activity was essential for the transforming potential of the mutant receptor (26Moscatello D.K. Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Montgomery R.B. Wong A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 200-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity associated with HC2 20d2/c cells resulted in a reduction in JNK activity and partial morphological reversion of the transformed appearance of HC2 20d2/c cells. The ability of PI 3-kinase to influence both cell morphology and JNK activity could be explained by its interaction with members of the Rho family of proteins (31Bokoch G.M. Vlahos C.J. Wang Y.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27995-27998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Taken together, we speculate that the constitutive PI 3-kinase activity induced by EGFRvIII expression is responsible for the high basal level of JNK activity and that this contributes to the transformed phenotype induced by EGFRvIII. The low level of ERK activation exhibited by cells expressing the mutant receptor has been suggested to be regulated by expression of a phosphatase (17Moscatello D.K. Montgomery R.B. Sundareshan P. McDanel H. Wong M.Y. Wong A.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 85-96PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, in NIH3T3 fibroblasts, expression of MAP kinase phosphatase-1, a phosphatase specific for ERKs, is induced by activation of the JNK pathway (39Bokemeyer D. Sorokin A. Yan M. Ahn N.G. Templeton D.J. Dunn M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 639-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The constitutive JNK activity associated with EGFRvIII-transfected cells may induce constant expression of MAP kinase phosphatase-1, resulting in the low basal ERK activity exhibited in these cells. We are currently determining if this is the mechanism responsible for down-regulating ERK activation in HC2 20d2/c cells and if such down-regulation is essential for the transformation potential of the mutant receptor. In support of our data implicating continuous JNK activity with a growth advantage in EGFRvIII transfectants, recent studies found that the JNK pathway was required for transformation by both the Trp-Met (40Rodrigues G.A. Park M. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2634-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and Bcr-Abl (41Raitano A.B. Halpern J.R. Hambuch T.M. Sayers C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11746-11750Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) oncoproteins. Like EGFRvIII, the Trp-Met oncoprotein is a constitutively active receptor tyrosine kinase that is not influenced by ligand (42Rodrigues G.A. Park M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2019-2027PubMed Google Scholar). Dominant-negatives forms of Grb2 transformed into cells expressing the Trp-Met protein resulted in a reverted morphology that was associated with both down-regulated PI 3-kinase and JNK activities (40Rodrigues G.A. Park M. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2634-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). It is interesting to speculate that preferential activation of the JNK pathway may be a characteristic of unregulated kinases with high transformation potential, such as seen in fibroblasts expressing EGFRvIII, Trp-Met, or Bcr-Abl. Analysis of EGFRvIII in NIH3T3 cells has provided a model in which the transforming effects of this mutant receptor can be elucidated. We have shown that the transformed state of EGFRvIII-expressing cells is associated with the preferential and constitutive activation of the JNK pathway. These findings also demonstrate that cells are capable of sustained JNK activity and low ERK activity without the induction of apoptosis. In light of our findings and recent reports by others (40Rodrigues G.A. Park M. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2634-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar,41Raitano A.B. Halpern J.R.

A. 1995; 92: 11746-11750Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) implicating the JNK pathway in the promotion of transformation, it is becoming clear that certain oncoproteins and/or cell types actually utilize JNK and not ERK for transformation."

In glycoprotein biosynthesis, functions of the various Golgi subcompartments are well established: early reactions in glycoprotein trimming and processing take place in the lumen of the early (cis/medial) Golgi, and late reactions take place in the trans Golgi/trans Golgi network (summarized in Refs. 17Mellman I.

Using a truncated analogue of ceramide with only eight carbon atoms in both its sphingosine and fatty acid moieties (C8C8-ceramide), transferase activities can be measured in the absence of detergent, because the truncated substrates readily permeate membranes (39Lannert H.

Assaying intact membranes has the advantage that overall higher transferase activities are obtained and the enzymes are characterized functionally, because in intact membranes their activities depend on functionally intact translocators for their respective substrates, such as, e.g. CMP-NeuAc or UDP-Gal (43Deutscher S.L.

Moreover, care was taken to inhibit β-glucosidase, which is present at different levels of activity in the various subfractions examined, because degradation of the substrate added or the product formed in an enzyme assay may profoundly change the result. Here we show that, in contrast to the functional organization of the Golgi apparatus in glycoprotein biosynthesis, all lumenal activities investigated for the formation of more complex GSLs reside in the late Golgi, including LacCer synthesis.

[3H]CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid, [3H]UDP-galactose, [3H]UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, and [3H]UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine were from NEN Life Science Products. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (molecular weight, 30,000) and agar (extra pure) were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). [3H]t-Cer and [3H]t-GlcCer were synthesized as described (42Karrenbauer A.

After incubation, the samples were diluted 3-fold with ice-cold buffer, loaded on 1 ml of 10 mm Tris-maleate, pH 7.4, containing 500 mm sucrose and 2 mg of bovine serum albumin/ml, and the membranes were pelleted by centrifugation (30 min at 170,000 ×g and 4 °C). The pellets were resuspended in the above buffer, and aliquots were used for the determination of the following enzyme-activities: for GlcCer and SM synthase, [3H]t-Cer was used as a substrate, and for β-glucosidase, [3H]t-GlcCer was used. To obtain partially purified Golgi subcompartments, a protocol was followed as described in Ref. 25Trinchera M. Ghidoni R. J. Biol.

A partial separation of early and late Golgi membranes was always found, with the maxima of marker activities separated by three fractions. Fractionation of the gradients allowed a reproducibility of the maxima range of ±1 fraction without affecting their distance. Three gradients that showed highly reproducible patterns are shown under “Results”; they were used for the immunological and activity assays presented. Immunological analyses were performed twice in independent gradients and identical results were obtained (see Fig. 2). Activities of SM and GlcCer synthase were determined as described (36Jeckel D. Karrenbauer A. Burger K.N.J. van Meer G. Wieland F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). A standard assay to follow t-GSL synthesis in Golgi membranes contained in a total volume of 10 μl, 1–5 μg of protein, 50 μm [3H]t-GlcCer (specific activity, 0.2 μCi/nmol), 1 mm conduritol B epoxide (CBE), 100 mm KOAc, 1 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 mm MnCl2, 5 mm NaCl, and 2 mm UDP-Gal in 50 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 6.5, to measure LacCer synthase. Further addition of 2 mm CMP-NeuAc leads to the synthesis of t-GM3 and t-GD3. These conditions were found to be optimal after variations of buffer, pH, ion concentrations, and concentration of substrates. Enzyme activities were found to be linear for up to 2 h. For standard assays, samples were incubated for 40 min at 37 °C. To measure these enzyme activities across the gradients, 4 μl of each fraction was used. To determine the activities in the presence of detergent, a final concentration of 0.05% Triton CF54 was used. The reaction was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 2-propanol, and then the samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g, and an aliquot (10 μl) of the supernatants was analyzed by TLC. t-GM3 was isolated by scraping the band from a preparative TLC and hydrolysis with sialidase from V. cholerae (Sigma). Only t-LacCer was found as the product. When the isolated t-GM3 was used as a substrate, Golgi membranes in the presence of detergent converted this ganglioside into t-GD3 as evidenced by an additional spot on the TLC that appeared only after the addition of CMP-NeuAc. Activity of β-glucosidase was determined using [3H]t-GlcCer (50 μm) as substrate, under conditions described above, in the absence of CBE and detergent. A total volume of 10 μl contained 4-μl gradient fractions. The hydrolysing activity was calculated from the sum of [3H]t-SM and [3H]t-Cer formed. GM3 synthase (SAT-I) was determined with minor modifications according to the method described in Ref. 41Iber H. van Echten G. Sandhoff K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar. In a total volume of 20 μl, 200 μm long chain LacCer, 0.05% Triton CF 54, 50 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 6.5, 100 mm KOAc, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm[3H]CMP-NeuAc (4000–6000 cpm/nmol), and 10 μl of gradient-fractions were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1), and an aliquot (10 μl) of the organic phase was analyzed by TLC. Identification of GM3 was performed by comparison with an authentic standard substance. GalNAc-T (GA2, GM2, and GD2 synthase) was measured with minor modifications according to the method described in Ref. 53Pohlentz G. Klein D. Schwarzmann G. Schmitz D. Sandhoff K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7044-7048Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar. In a total volume of 20 μl, 200 μm GM3, 0.15% Triton X-100, 40 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 6.5, 10 mm MnCl2, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 100 mm KOAc, 200 μm [3H]UDP-GalNAc (25,000–45,000 cpm/nmol), and 14 μl of each membrane fraction was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1), and an aliquot (10 μl) of the organic phase was analyzed by TLC. GM2 was characterized by TLC and autoradiography after using either GM3 and [3H]UDP-GalNAc as substrates or [3H]GM3 and UDP-GalNAc. In both cases, superimposed spots were obtained. Whatman silica gel plates (LK 6) were developed with a mixture of chloroform, methanol, and 0.22% CaCl2 in water (65:35:8) as a solvent. Identification of the various glycosphingolipids was performed either by incorporation of 3H-labeled sugars from their nucleotide-activated precursors (long chain GSLs) or by hydrolysis with the appropriate specific glycosidases (t-GSLs). For fluorography, the chromatograms were prepared according to the method described in Ref.54Randerath K. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 34: 188-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar. For determination of radioactivity, the chromatograms were evaluated on an automatic TLC two-dimensional analyzer (digital autoradiograph) (Berthold, Wildbad, Germany). The scanner counts the radioactivity of 3H-labeled spots on the TLC plate with a yield of 0.88% compared with liquid counting. When the spots counted for 1 h (cph) in the scanner (e.g. 2700 cph) are measured by liquid scintillation counting, they yield 113-fold of the radioactivity registered (in our example, 5085 cpm). In this system a significant signal is obtained down to 100 cph, representing 188 cpm in the scintillation system. Proteins were separated on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions (55Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar).

Immunoreactions were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Corp.). For morphological evaluations, aliquots of fractions 15 and 18 were diluted 10-fold with 10 mmTris/maleate, pH 7.4, and the membranes were sedimented by centrifugation (60 min at 4 °C and 100,000 × g). The pellets were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 msodium-cacodylate buffer, pH 7.6, containing 4% polyvinylpyrrolidone (Mr 30,000) and 0.05% calcium chloride. After washing with 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.6, three times, the pellets were embedded in agar (extra pure) and cut into thin slices.

Ultra-thin sections were stained with alkaline lead citrate and analyzed using a Zeiss EM 10 electron microscope. To obtain valid activity quantifications, GSL-degrading activities need to be excluded in the corresponding assays.

Addition of [3H]t-GlcCer and UDP-Gal to nonfractionated Golgi membranes led to the formation of t-LacCer (Fig. 1). In addition, free [3H]t-Cer was formed (indicative for the presence of β-glucosidase), part of which was converted into [3H]t-SM (Fig. 1, lane 2). In the presence of CBE hydrolysis of [3H]t-GlcCer was efficiently inhibited (Fig. 1, lane 3) (58Bieberich E. Legler G. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1989; 370: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 59Datta S.C. Radin N.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 152: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). These conditions allowed the determination of the β-glucosidase (without added CBE) or LacCer synthase (in presence of CBE). β-Glucosidase activity was found by protease latency experiments to be lumenal and did not follow typical Golgi peak activities after subfractionation (data not shown). Part of this activity may be present in the lumen of Golgi subcompartments en route to the lysosomes. The activity profile of LacCer synthase after partial separation of Golgi subcompartments is shown in Fig. 2 A with a peak in fraction 18.

The activity for t-LacCer synthesis is restricted to late Golgi subfractions, and the peak activity coincides with the marker activity for trans Golgi, protein-Gal-T (compare Fig. 2, A and E). Clearly, contaminating plasma membranes, as well as early endosomes, peak differently in the gradient (see Fig. 2, B and C) excluding these membranes as residences for LacCer synthase.

EC 2.3.1.87) is the penultimate enzyme in the synthesis of the pineal hormone melatonin (5-methoxy-N-acetyltryptamine). This enzyme is of special interest because large increases in its activity are responsible for the large increase in circulating melatonin levels in vertebrates (1Klein D.C. Weller J.L. Science. 1970; 169: 1093-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar,2Arendt J. Melatonin and the Mammalian Pineal Gland. Chapman and Hall, London1995Google Scholar). The nocturnal increase in melatonin plays a critical role in circadian biology and in the precise timing of seasonal changes in physiology, including reproductive activity. It is also thought to play a role in human mood and behavior (2Arendt J. Melatonin and the Mammalian Pineal Gland. Chapman and Hall, London1995Google Scholar). AANAT regulates melatonin biosynthesis by controlling the production of N-acetyl-5-hydroxytryptamine from serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) and acetyl-CoA (3Voisin P. Namboodiri M.A.A. Klein D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10913-10918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). The conversion of N-acetyl-5-hydroxytryptamine to melatonin is catalyzed by hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.4), which is expressed at relatively constant levels; the rate of this step is regulated by N-acetyl-5-hydroxytryptamine availability. AANATs constitute a family of approximately 23-kDa proteins which are ∼80% identical at the amino acid level (4Klein D.C. Roseboom P.H. Coon S.L. Trends Endocrinol.

AANATs are not homologous to any other protein. However, the AANAT family is a member of a superfamily of proteins defined by the presence in tandem of two weakly conserved, approximately 15-amino acid sequences (motifs A and B). There are >150 members of this superfamily. Approximately one-third are either known acetyltransferases or share a high degree of homology with known acetyltransferases (5Coon S.L. Roseboom P.H.

Chem. 1984; 259: 10913-10918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Coon S.L. Roseboom P.H. Baler R. Weller J.L. Namboodiri M.A.A. Koonin E.V. Klein D.C.

The catalytic action of arylamine N-acetyltransferases has been determined to be a ping-pong reaction mechanism involving formation of a covalent acetyl-S-cysteine enzyme intermediate (14Weber W.W. Cohen S.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1967; 3: 266-273PubMed Google Scholar, 15Jencks W.P. Gresser M. Valenzuela M.S. Huneeus F.C. J. Biol.

This reflects in part the limited availability and instability of the native enzyme. Understanding the catalytic mechanism of action of AANAT is of importance for two reasons. One is that it provides a model for other members of the motif A/B superfamily. The second is that this information may play a role in the generation of specific AANAT inhibitors that may be important as therapeutic agents and as tools to probe the physiological role of melatonin. The recent cloning of AANATs (10Klein D.C. Coon S.L. Roseboom P.H. Weller J.L. Bernard M. Gastel J.A. Zatz M. Iuvone P.M. Rodriquez I.R. Begay V. Falcon J. Cahill G.M. Cassone V.M. Baler R. Recent Progr. Horm. Res. 1997; 52: 307-357PubMed Google Scholar) has now made it possible to prepare large amounts of purified recombinant enzyme for kinetic analysis, and here we present the first results of such investigations. The following were purchased: acetyl-CoA (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.); tryptamine-HCl, desulfo-CoA, glutathione-agarose, DTNB (Sigma); sodium phosphate, dithiothreitol, guanidinium-HCl, EDTA (Fisher Scientific); tryptophol (Aldrich); and [14C]acetyl-CoA (60 Ci/mol) (NEN Life Science Products). N-Acetyltryptamine was synthesized by reacting tryptamine-HCl (500 mg, 2.5 mmol) with acetic anhydride (260 mg, 2.5 mmol) in the presence of excess triethylamine (1.75 ml). After vigorous stirring at room temperature for 50 min, the mixture was partitioned between ethyl acetate (80 ml) and water (70 ml). The organic phase was washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (50 ml), 0.1 m HCl (50 ml), and saturated aqueous NaCl (30 ml). The organic phase was dried over Na2SO4 (anhydrous), and the resultant was concentrated in vacuo to affordN-acetyltryptamine as off-white crystals (88% yield). Purity (>95%) was established by TLC and 1H NMR. The entire open reading frame of the DNA encoding sheep AANAT in the plasmid vector pET15b (5Coon S.L. Roseboom P.H. Baler R. Weller J.L.

A frozen stock of this strain (10 μl) was used to inoculate 25 ml of Luria Broth containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml) in a culture flask and grown overnight at 37 °C in a floor shaker. The culture was used to inoculate 2 liters of Luria Broth divided into three Erlenmeyer flasks also containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml) (1:100 v/v) and grown at 37 °C in a floor shaker until the absorption at 595 nm was equal to 0.5–0.6. The flasks were cooled to room temperature by standing at 4 °C for 20 min and then treated with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (to a final concentration of 0.2 mm). The cultures were maintained at 24 °C for an additional 5 h. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation (4 °C, 5,000 × g, 10 min) and the cell paste (5.2 g) snap frozen with liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C. The cell paste was resuspended in 30 ml of lysis buffer (1 × phosphate-buffered saline, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 10 mm EDTA, pH-6.9), and the suspension was lysed by passage through a French pressure cell at 12,000 p.s.i. Insoluble protein and cell debris were removed by centrifugation (4 °C, 27,000 × g, 30 min followed by 4 °C, 100,000 × g, 120 min), and the supernatant (25 ml) was snap frozen with liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C. The thawed solution was then incubated with Nutator (Fisher Scientific) mixing with 2 ml of glutathione-agarose (100 mg of dried resin, swollen with 20 ml of H2O, then pre-equilibrated in lysis buffer by washing two times with 10 ml, pelleting in a 50-ml centrifuge tube at 2,000 × g in a swinging bucket centrifuge for 5 min) at room temperature for 30 min. The mixture was centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 5 min and the supernatant carefully pipetted away. The pelleted resin was resuspended and washed two times with lysis buffer + 263 mm NaCl (10 ml each) at 4 °C. Subsequently, the glutathione-agarose resin was incubated at room temperature for 30 min on a Nutator with 20 ml of lysis buffer + 113 mm NaCl + 50 mm glutathione (whose pH was adjusted to 7 with 8 n NaOH). The resin was pelleted, and the supernatant (20 ml) was recovered and dialyzed (2 × 500 ml) at 4 °C against storage buffer (4.3 mm sodium phosphate, 1.4 mm potassium phosphate, 337 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEDTA, 10% glycerol, pH 6.9). The protein concentration postdialysis was 0.5 mg/ml (total yield 10 mg) as determined by Bradford assay referenced to bovine serum albumin standard. Purity was approximately 90% as determined by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Coomassie staining). The protein was stored (−80 °C) at 0.5 mg/ml concentration or after Centricon (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA) ultrafiltration, at 4.2 mg/ml, and maintained stable enzyme activity for at least 4 months. The GST-AANAT fusion protein was cleaved with thrombin and then purified according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pharmacia) to produce GST-free AANAT and protein concentration determined by Bradford assay. AANAT activity was measured primarily using a newly developed spectrophotometric assay. An established radiochemical assay was also used with minor modifications (12Deguchi T. J. Neurochem. 1975; 24: 1083-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This assay is based on the detection of CoASH generated during acetyl transfer by reaction with the thiol reagent DTNB (19Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). This assay was typically performed using a buffer containing 0.05 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, variable acetyl-CoA (0.1–3 mm), and variable tryptamine (0.05–1 mm) at 30 °C in 0.3 ml in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. Reactions were initiated with enzyme (3 μl, 5–30 nm final concentration) that had been prediluted (10–100-fold) in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in the absence of reducing agent immediately before use and maintained on ice during the assay. The reactions were quenched for 0–3 min with 0.6 ml of a buffer containing guanidinium-HCl (3.2m), sodium phosphate (0.1 m), pH 6.8. These mixtures were treated with 0.1 ml of DTNB (2 mm, 0.1m sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 10 mm EDTA), vortexed, and allowed to stand for 5 min before absorbance readings were performed at 412 nm (thiophenolate-quantified assuming ε = 13.7 × 103m−1cm−1) (19Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). Background absorbances (with all components added including enzyme) were measured and subtracted from the total absorbance. A background correction was made for each acetyl-CoA concentration because acetyl-CoA had a small contaminant of free thiol (1–2% presumably free CoASH). The rate of conversion of acetyl-CoA to CoASH in the absence of amine was negligible over the course of the assay. Activity was linear with time for at least 3 min at high (2 mm) and low (0.1 mm) acetyl-CoA. Velocity measurements were made under initial conditions where reaction of the limiting substrate did not exceed 10%. A modification of an established radiochemical assay (12Deguchi T. J. Neurochem. 1975; 24: 1083-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) was used in which the concentration of tryptamine (1 mm) is incubated with [14C]acetyl-CoA (1 mm; specific activity = 1.24 Ci/mol) and N-[14C]acetyltryptamine was measured. The apparent specific activities measured with both methods were essentially identical (<20% difference). All assays were performed at least twice with duplicate measurements typically within 10%. Absorbance drift was minimal with fresh solutions (presumably because of slow air oxidation) over the 20–30 min necessary for assay completion. Measurement of Km(app) for acetyl-CoA employed an acetyl-CoA concentration range of 0.1–2 mm (0.4Km–8 Km) at fixed and near saturating tryptamine (1 mm). Measurement of Km(app) for tryptamine and serotonin employed a substrate concentration range of 0.05–1 mm (0.3Km–6 Km) at fixed and near saturating acetyl-CoA (2 mm). Data were fitted to the equation v=Vm∗S/(Km+S)Equation 1 using a nonlinear least squares approach (Macintosh computer program KaleidographTM, Reading, PA), and the kinetic constants ± S.E. errors are reported in Table I.Table IApparent Km and kcat values for acetyl transfer reactions catalyzed by GST-AANAT fusion and unmodified AANAT proteinsEnzyme formAcetyl-CoAKm(app)TryptamineKm(app)SerotoninKm(app)kcat(app)mmmmmms−1GST-AANAT0.289 ± 0.0130.168 ± 0.0140.241 ± 0.02725 ± 1AANAT0.178 ± 0.0130.125 ± 0.01425 ± 1 Open table in a new tab Two-substrate kinetic analysis was performed with substrate concentrations given in Fig. 3, and the data were fitted to the sequential (ternary complex) mechanism equation (Equation 2) using the computer program KinetAsyst IITM (IntelliKinetics, State College, PA) based on the algorithms of Cleland (20Cleland W.W.

Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1924) Google Scholar). The data for individual experiments with each inhibitor versus a varied substrate were fit to all three inhibitor models. Choice of kinetic fit was based on a combination of visual inspection and comparison of S.E. values and residuals for all three inhibition types applied to the data sets (20Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1924) Google Scholar). In the cases where uncompetitive inhibition was assigned, there were no significant improvements in the standard errors or sum of squares of the residuals (less than 2-fold) by including the extra inhibitory constant Kis. In the cases where competitive models were assigned, there were no significant improvements in the S.E. or the sum of squares of the residuals (less than 2-fold) by including the extra inhibitory constantKii. The lines drawn through the data points in the figures are derived from the fitted equations above. Expression of the sheep GST-AANAT fusion plasmid in E. coli resulted in the production of active soluble GST-AANAT fusion protein (>5 mg/liter of culture). Purification using glutathione affinity chromatography afforded nearly homogeneously pure recombinant protein with the predicted molecular mass (approximately 50 kDa) as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (see Fig. 2). GST-free AANAT was obtained by thrombin cleavage of GST-AANAT (Fig. 2). The resulting product had kinetic characteristics essentially identical to those of GST-AANAT (Table I). GST-AANAT was used for further kinetic analysis because it was found to be more stable and easier to work with. The kcat of 25 s−1 for recombinant AANAT is similar to the reportedkcat (80 s−1) for a pureN-acetyl-CoA-dependent acetyltransferase (22Gehring A.M. Lees W.J. Mindiola D.J. Walsh C.T. Brown E.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 579-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was unlikely that the enzyme contained a large fraction of inactive material because preparations obtained using a variety of purification protocols had essentially identical turnover numbers. Using the DTNB assay, GST-AANAT reactions display linear activity versus time for at least 3 min in the absence of reducing agents, and enzyme activity is linear with respect to enzyme concentration up to 500 nm. After background subtraction, interference from trace reducing agents from the enzyme preparations or the acetyl-CoA was shown to be inconsequential. There is insignificant CoASH formation in the absence of amine substrate in the enzyme range employed. As little as 1 nmol of product formation (3 μm) is detected reliably in a 0.3-ml reaction. Km values for tryptamine and acetyl-CoA obtained with the DTNB assay showed good agreement with published values obtained with native sheep pineal AANAT 3When assayed at similar ionic strength (I ≈ 0.1), the Km(app)values for acetyl-CoA (0.1 mm) and tryptamine (0.1 mm) for GST-AANAT are nearly identical to the published data for native AANAT (see Ref. 3Voisin P. Namboodiri M.A.A. Klein D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10913-10918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (3Voisin P. Namboodiri M.A.A. Klein D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10913-10918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); specific activity values were approximately 1,000-fold higher for recombinant protein (3Voisin P. Namboodiri M.A.A. Klein D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10913-10918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These values are also in a convenient range to perform kinetic mechanism studies as outlined below. the kcat(app) and Km(app) generated with serotonin were nearly indistinguishable from those obtained with tryptamine (see Table I). Km values were obtained for tryptamine using a range of acetyl-CoA concentrations. A double-reciprocal analysis of these data formed an intersecting line pattern (Fig. 3) that is characteristic of a ternary complex (sequential) mechanism. In contrast, a ping-pong mechanism is typically characterized by a parallel line pattern (21Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme Systems. Wiley-Interscience, New York1975Google Scholar). Dead end analog inhibitors are compounds that resemble one substrate or the other but are unable to serve as substrates because of structural differences. Desulfo-CoA lacks the terminal sulfur atom of CoASH (Fig. 4) and is a potential dead end inhibitor of AANAT. It was found to be a linear competitive inhibitorversus acetyl-CoA at saturating tryptamine concentration with a Kis of 1 mm, only 2-fold larger than the dissociation constant of acetyl-CoA (0.51 mm) (Fig. 5). Desulfo-CoA was also tested as a GST-AANAT inhibitor at fixed acetyl-CoA concentration and varying concentrations of tryptamine (Fig. 5). It was found to be noncompetitive versus tryptamine as opposed to uncompetitive, the latter being the expected pattern if tryptamine binds first in an ordered ternary complex mechanism (21Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme Systems. Wiley-Interscience, New York1975Google Scholar).Figure 5Inhibition of GST-AANAT with desulfo-CoA.

Panel B, 1/velocity (E/V) versus 1/tryptamine at varying concentrations of desulfo-CoA (I). Acetyl-CoA concentration was fixed at 0.2 mm. Fit is to a linear noncompetitive inhibitor model. For details of the assays and calculations, see “Materials and Methods”; for the kinetic constants, see Table III.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The structural analog to tryptamine in which the primary amine function is replaced by a hydroxyl function (tryptophol) (see Fig. 4) could theoretically be an alternative AANAT substrate. To investigate this possibility, 1 mm tryptophol was incubated with 500 nmGST-AANAT in the presence of 1 mm acetyl-CoA for up to 3 min. Under these conditions no detectable transfer took place, indicating that tryptophol is acetylated at least 400-fold less efficiently by GST-AANAT compared with tryptamine. Because tryptophol was not a substrate, it was evaluated as a potential GST-AANAT inhibitor. As expected, tryptophol was a linear competitive inhibitor of tryptamine (Table III). In studies with tryptophol as the inhibitor and acetyl-CoA as the varied substrate, at subsaturating concentration of tryptamine there was a clear uncompetitive pattern of inhibition as reflected in the parallel line pattern of Fig. 6. This pattern indicates that acetyl-CoA must bind earlier than tryptophol for tryptophol inhibition to take place. N-Acetyltryptamine is one of the two products of the N-acetyltransferase reaction (see Fig. 1), and its inhibitory behavior was evaluated with GST-AANAT because reaction products can be useful diagnostic tools for kinetic mechanism studies. N-Acetyltryptamine was found to be a clear noncompetitive inhibitor versus tryptamine as the varied substrate (Fig. 7 and Table III). N-Acetyltryptamine was found to be an uncompetitive inhibitor versus acetyl-CoA at fixed, subsaturating tryptamine concentration (tryptamine concentration ≈Km of tryptamine, Table III). Previously published kinetic assays for AANAT have relied on radioactive incorporation of acetyl (3H or 14C) into the acetylated product (3Voisin P. Namboodiri M.A.A. Klein D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10913-10918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Deguchi T. J. Neurochem. 1975; 24: 1083-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar,23Wolfe M.S. Lee N.R. Zatz M. Brain Res. 1995; 669: 100-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) or high pressure liquid chromatographic analysis (24Thomas K.B. Zawilska J. Iuvone P.M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 184: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 25Fajardo N. Abreu P. Alonso R. J. Pineal Res. 1992; 13: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). These assays were developed for high sensitivity as required for detection of enzyme activity in small biological samples. However, they require complex extraction procedures and are not practical for routine analysis of large numbers of samples as required for detailed mechanistic studies or inhibitor screens. The less complicated DTNB assay described in this report meets this requirement. The potential difficulty with this approach was that reducing agents such as dithiothreitol and β-mercaptoethanol react with DTNB (Ellman's reagent). Indeed, GST-AANAT is somewhat unstable in the absence of reducing agents, losing greater than 50% activity within 2 h at 4 °C (data not shown). However, the enzyme was stable within the short incubation periods used in these studies (less than 3 min). It was shown unequivocally that CoASH generation was coupled tightly to N-acetyltryptamine formation, and the activity was linear with time and enzyme concentration. An attractive feature of the DTNB detection assay is that it allows any potential amine substrate to be tested easily, providing it does not react with DTNB. Of note, a continuous spectrophotometric assay with DTNB was not possible because DTNB inhibited GST-AANAT activity. A generally useful approach to kinetic analysis of two-substrate enzymes is one in which both substrates are varied within the same experiment. It is well accepted that a double-reciprocal plot that results in intersecting lines suggests a ternary complex mechanism and that a parallel line pattern is characteristic of a ping-pong mechanism (21Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme Systems. Wiley-Interscience, New York1975Google Scholar). Previous experiments using this approach to analyze crude preparations on AANAT from rat and bird pineal glands suggest that different mechanisms were involved (23Wolfe M.S. Lee N.R. Zatz M. Brain Res. 1995; 669: 100-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar,26Morrissey J.J. Edwards S.B. Lovenberg W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 77: 118-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This difference is inconsistent with the high homology among vertebrate AANATs, especially within the putative binding domains and the putative catalytic site (4Klein D.C. Roseboom P.H. Coon S.L. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 7: 106-112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 10Klein D.C. Coon S.L. Roseboom P.H. Weller J.L. Bernard M. Gastel J.A. Zatz M. Iuvone P.M. Rodriquez I.R. Begay V. Falcon J. Cahill G.M. Cassone V.M. Baler R. Recent Progr. Horm. Res. 1997; 52: 307-357PubMed Google Scholar). The reported differences in the apparent mechanism of catalysis may reflect contaminants in the partially purified preparations as the assays appeared to be performed under similar conditions of pH and ionic strength. The potential problem with contaminants is avoided by the use of purified expressed GST-AANAT as described in this report. The most important advance in this study was the evidence that a ternary complex mechanism is involved, as indicated by the clear intersecting line pattern. It should be noted that although this analytical approach has correctly predicted the mechanistic behavior of the best characterized acetyltransferases (15Jencks W.P. Gresser M. Valenzuela M.S. Huneeus F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3756-3760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Shaw W.V. Leslie A.G.W. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 363-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 28Colucci W.J. Gandour R.D. Bioorg. Chem. 1988; 16: 307-334Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar) it is not impossible that a covalent enzyme intermediate occurs. However, if a covalent enzyme intermediate occurs, it must form after both substrates are bound and decompose before either product leaves. The next issue addressed was the order of binding of substrates which precedes ternary complex formation. Three major schemes are possible: (i) ordered with acetyl-CoA binding first; (ii) ordered with tryptamine binding first; and (iii) random substrate binding. To discriminate among these possibilities dead end inhibitors were used (21Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme Systems. Wiley-Interscience, New York1975Google Scholar). Desulfo-CoA, a dead end analog of acetyl-CoA (see Fig. 4), was shown to be a linear competitive inhibitor with respect to acetyl-CoA and a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to tryptamine. These results rule out an ordered mechanism where tryptamine binds before acetyl-CoA. In such a mechanism, desulfo-CoA would have been uncompetitive with respect to tryptamine. The desulfo-CoA experiments leave open the possibilities that there is random binding of acetyl-CoA and tryptamine or ordered binding of acetyl-CoA before tryptamine. Another interesting point is the apparent similarity in affinity which GST-AANAT displays toward acetyl-CoA (Kd = 0.51 mm) and desulfo-CoA (Ki = 1 mm). It suggests that the thioester function contributes little binding energy in the ground state complex. Tryptophol (Fig. 4) was next evaluated as a GST-AANAT substrate/inhibitor. It was shown that replacement of the amino function of tryptamine with a hydroxy group prevents enzyme-catalyzed acetyl transfer. The lack of reactivity suggests that the nucleophilicity of the amine is critical for enzyme-catalyzed reaction because tryptophol can bind with reasonable affinity to AANAT as demonstrated by its inhibitory behavior (see below). Interestingly, the O-acetyltransferase carnitine acetyltransferase is able to process the amino-substrate at a kcat only 13-fold lower than the normal hydroxy substrate (29Jenkins D.L. Griffith O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14748-14755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This altered reactivity between the two enzymes suggests that there may be a mechanistic difference in the chemical steps catalyzed between these two classes of acetyltransferases (O and N). Tetrahydrodipicolinate N-succinyltransferase also shows no reactivity toward the corresponding oxygen analog (30Berges D.A. DeWolf Jr., W.E. Dunn G.L. Newman D.J. Schmidt S.J. Taggart J.J. Gilvarg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6160-6167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, tryptophol proved to be a linear competitive inhibitor of GST-AANAT versus the varied substrate tryptamine. It was a clear uncompetitive inhibitor versus acetyl-CoA. Fitting the data to a noncompetitive fit gave no significant lessening of the residuals and gave a Kis that was more than 10 times higher than the Kii with a very large error (±100%). These results strongly suggest that acetyl-CoA must bind before tryptamine to the enzyme, i.e.that there is an ordered mechanism. Although this inhibitory pattern is compatible with a ping-pong kinetic mechanism, a ping-pong mechanism is ruled out by the intersecting line pattern in the two substrate kinetic analysis (Fig. 3). The ordered binding suggests either (i) a conformational change in the protein which causes the tryptamine binding pocket to become accessible only after acetyl-CoA binds or (ii) tryptamine undergoes an important, direct noncovalent binding interaction with acetyl-CoA in the enzyme active site. Differentiation between these possibilities awaits further structural studies. CoASH was not evaluated as a reversible inhibitor in the spectrophotometric assay because it reacts with DTNB. It also forms (CoAS)2 in the absence of reducing agents, and the use of reducing agents in the radiochemical assay would require extensive kinetic characterization of the enzyme in the presence of such reagents, which is beyond the scope of this investigation. The reaction product N-acetyltryptamine is a noncompetitive inhibitorversus tryptamine and an uncompetitive inhibitorversus acetyl-CoA. This strongly suggests that AANAT obeys an ordered BiBi ternary complex mechanism withN-acetyltryptamine being the first product released followed by CoASH. The noncompetitive inhibition pattern versustryptamine likely is caused by the binding of N-acetyltryptamine to both the acetyl-CoA-bound GST-AANAT form as well as the CoASH-bound GST-AANAT form. The lack of a slope effect in the inhibition of N-acetyltryptamineversus acetyl-CoA (at subsaturating tryptamine) presumably stems from the fact that the chemical step is very weakly reversible since a thioester bond (ΔGhydrolysis of acetyl-CoA = −7.5 kcal/mol) is exchanged for an amide bond (ΔGhydrolysis of propionamide = −2.1 kcal/mol) (21Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme Systems. Wiley-Interscience, New York1975Google Scholar, 31Sober H.A. 2nd Ed. Handbook of Biochemistry: Selected Data for Molecular Biology. CRC Press, Cleveland1970: J-184Google Scholar). It has not been established that any of the acetyltransferases that have been kinetically characterized are members of the motif A/B superfamily. Accordingly, demonstration that AANAT obeys a ternary complex, ordered BiBi mechanism creates a precedent for other acetyltransferases in the motif A/B superfamily, including a eukaryotic histone N-acetyltransferase believed to be important in the regulation of gene expression (32Yang X.-J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). Delineating the kinetic mechanism also develops a framework for an approach to inhibitor design. Therefore, tryptamine analog inhibitors are unlikely to be potent at blocking AANAT action at low levels of acetyl-CoA. It remains to be seen whether bisubstrate analog inhibitors can be effective. We acknowledge gratefully W. W. Cleland (University of Wisconsin, Madison) for helpful discussions and a critical reading of the manuscript. We also express our appreciation to Eugene Koonin (National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD) for analysis of the A/B motif superfamily of acetyltransferases and valuable discussions."

As a first step toward the testing of this hypothesis, we have cloned human small intestinal maltase-glucoamylase cDNA to permit study of the individual catalytic and binding sites for maltose and starch enzyme hydrolase activities in subsequent expression experiments. Human maltase-glucoamylase was purified by immunoisolation and partially sequenced. Maltase-glucoamylase cDNA was amplified from human intestinal RNA using degenerate and gene-specific primers with the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The 6,513-base pair cDNA contains an open reading frame that encodes a 1,857-amino acid protein (molecular mass 209,702 Da). Maltase-glucoamylase has two catalytic sites identical to those of sucrase-isomaltase, but the proteins are only 59% homologous. Both are members of glycosyl hydrolase family 31, which has a variety of substrate specificities.

Starches are a mixture of two structurally different polysaccharides: amylose, a linear [4-O-α-d-glucopyranosyl-d-glucose]npolymer, and amylopectin, with additional 6-O-α-d-glucopyranosyl-d-glucose links (about 4% of total), which result in a branched configuration. Dietary starches are a mixture of approximately 25% amylose in amylopectin, a fact of nutritional significance because of the multienzyme complexity of the mammalian starch digestion pathway (1Semenza G.

The starch-derived oligosaccharides are not fermentable by yeast without further processing by β-amylase (EC 3.1.1.2), which hydrolyzes the nonreducing ends at 1→4 and 1→6 linkages (2Hassid W.Z. Ball C.E. Pigman W. The Carbohydrates, Chemistry, Biochemistry, Physiology. Academic Press, Inc., New York1957: 501-506Google Scholar). In mammals, hydrolysis of the nonreducing ends is carried out by small intestinal mucosal brush border-anchored sucrase-isomaltase (SIM) 1The abbreviations used are: SIM, sucrase-isomaltase; MGA, maltase-glucoamylase; IPTG, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; RT, reverse transcription; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; mAB, monoclonal antibody; bp, base pair; EST, Expressed Sequence Tag.

In vivo, SIM accounts for 80% of maltase (1,4-O-α-d-glucanohydrolase) activity, all sucrase (d-glucopyranosyl-β-d-fructohydrolase) activity, and almost all isomaltase (1, 6-O-α-d-glucanohydrolase) activity (1Semenza G.

In this paper, we describe the cloning of cDNA for MGA from human intestinal RNA. The identity of the isolated cDNA clone was confirmed by expression of a recombinant protein in Escherichia coli transformed by the cDNA coding for the N-terminal domain.

Each stained all bands of the proteins isolated with HBB 2/143/17. Human small intestinal epithelial cells were obtained from frozen and thawed organ donor tissue, and brush border membranes were isolated from a 2% mucosal homogenate containing protease and bacterial inhibitors (27Naim H.Y.

Chem. 1988; 263: 7242-7253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Replicate MGA protein isolates were pooled, separated on SDS gels, and blotted onto a membrane. The proteins were stained with Coomassie blue, and their identity was confirmed by immunoblots stained with pooled HMA mAb. The individual 335- and 285-kDa protein bands were subjected to direct gas-phase N-terminal microsequencing. Additional 335- or 285-kDa isolate pools were hydrolyzed with CNBr, extracted, dried, and washed. The pellet was dissolved in electrophoresis buffer with dithiothreitol. The two hydrolyzed proteins were run on a Tricine gel and then were blotted and stained with Coomassie Blue. The hydrolysate bands were sequenced. Degenerate 19–20 oligonucleotide primers were designed from areas of the sequenced MGA peptides with lowest homology with SIM and from SIM catalytic site sequence WIDMNE (29Hunziker W. Spiess M.

Gene-specific primers were designed from sequenced clones. These primers were synthesized with an Applied Biosystems 394 DNA/RNA Synthesizer (Foster City, CA) or by Genosys (The Woodlands, TX). Reverse transcription (RT) was carried out using 100 ng of total human small intestine RNA (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The RT reaction used random nonamer primers (RT/PCR kit; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The RT product was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that used degenerate primers (1 μm), Taq polymerase, and RT reaction product in a thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer 480). Amplicons were separated on agarose gel, purified using QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA), ligated into pT7-blue T-vector, and transformed into NovaBlue E. coli (Novagen, Madison, WI). Clones were screened by PCR with vector primers, and QIApreps plasmid isolations (Qiagen) were carried out. DNA was subsequently sequenced (Applied Biosystems 373A automated sequencer, Foster City, CA). Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used to extend the 3′ and 5′ ends of the sequences. The 3′ reactants were amplified using rTthpolymerase kit (GeneAmp XL PCR kit, Perkin-Elmer). The forward primer was gene-specific, and the reverse primer was the abridged universal amplification primer (AUAP; Life Technologies). The amplicons were ligated with a PCR-script (GeneAmp XL PCR kit, Perkin-Elmer). The 5′ reverse primer was gene-specific, and the first forward primer was the anchor primer (Life Technologies). This was followed by a second round of amplification with primer AUAP. Clones were screened using vector and nested gene-specific primers. Equal amounts of total RNA from human small intestine, kidney, salivary gland, pancreas (CLONTECH), and isolated granulocytes (a gift of Dr. C. W. Smith, Baylor College of Medicine) were subjected to RT/PCR with primers producing MGA amplimers from small intestinal RNA (intestinal sequence locations 3660–4451, 1669–2031, and 5911–6231). β-actin was used as an amplification control for RNA quality (see Fig. 4 A). The gel was transferred to a membrane (MSI; Westboro, MA) and cross-linked. The probe was prepared from the full-length MGA-P1 cDNA using random labeling. The32P-labeled probe was purified by column isolation. The hybridization (ExpressHyb; CLONTECH) was at 68 °C, the membrane was washed at 50 °C, and the image was developed. Species specificity and genomic complexity were evaluated with the Zoo blot and Geno blot (CLONTECH). The Zoo blot contained 4 μg of EcoRI-digested genomic DNA from nine eukaryotic species (human, monkey, rat, mouse, dog, cow, rabbit, chicken, yeast). The Geno blot contained 4 μg of human genomic DNA cut with EcoRI, HindIII, BamHI, PstI, and BglII. The probe was prepared by PCR from the MGA-P1 template with primers encompassing 1669–2049 in the intestinal MGA sequence. The amplimer was random-labeled with [32P]dCTP. The hybridization (CLONTECH) was at 60 °C, the membrane was then washed under high stringency conditions at 50 °C, and the image was developed (Fig. 4, B and C). A full-length construct was assembled by cutting clones K3, 13-13, and T46 with HaeII, SacI, and SpeI. The DNA fragments were purified and ligated. The assembled construct was then column- and gel-purified. pBlueScript SK (Stratagene) vector was digested with SpeI, and the construct was ligated into the vector. The construct was used to transform XL1 Blue MRF cells. The full-length clone, MGA-P1, was completely resequenced. For the purpose of expressing independent active sites, two sets of gene-specific primers were designed that contained a SalI (on the 5′ end) or NotI (on the 3′ end) restriction site. By using these primer pairs and MGA-P1 as a template, an N-terminal 2,584-bp fragment encoding residues 295–2838 and C-terminal 2,687-bp fragment encoding 2893–5550 were amplified by PCR with rTthpolymerase. The amplicons were ligated into pET22b (Novagen) and transformed into NovaBlue cells for plasmid production. These clones, MGA-P1a (N-terminal domain) and MGA-P1b (C-terminal domain), were sequenced to confirm the orientations before transforming into BL21(DE3) E. coli (Novagen). Expression was induced by 1 mm IPTG, and proteins were harvested by osmotic shock and sonication. The induced and uninduced proteins were separated on a 6% gel and stained with Coomassie Blue or immunoblotted with HMA mAbs. The software from the Genetics Computer Group, Inc.

The HBB 2/143/17-immunoisolated proteins had the predicted 335- and 285-kDa forms of MGA when separated on SDS gels (25Hauri H.P. Sterchi E.E. Bienz D. Fransen J.A.M. Marxer A. J.

In experiments with a heavier P2 immunoisolate, an additional band of about 210 kDa, similar in size to those previously reported in higher resolution human explant (27Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E.

The 335- and 285-kDa MGA bands were separately excised from blots, and N-terminal amino acids were sequenced. The human MGA N-terminal sequence had 82% homology with hog MGA (18Norén O.

The initiator methionine was missing from the peptide sequences of the human MGA and human, rabbit, and porcine SIM N termini (16Sørensen S.H. Norén O. Sjöström H. Danielsen E.M. Eur. J.

J. 1992; 285: 915-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Five identical bands were visualized on electrophoretic separation after independent CNBr hydrolysis of the 335- and 285-kDa forms. The polypeptide fragment bands were individually excised and sequenced. Band 2 could not be successfully sequenced. Band 4 was only sequenced from the 335-kDa digest. The N terminus and internal peptide sequences from the 335-kDa band were identical to those from the 285-kDa band. The locations of these peptide sequences are underlined in the amino acid sequence in Fig. 2. Four overlapping clones were obtained from the degenerate primer amplifications, and a 2,461-bp consensus was determined (Fig. 1). The N terminus, two internal peptides, and a WIDMNE catalytic site sequences were recognized from a single open reading frame (Fig. 2). Gene-specific primers were used to extend the sequence by 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends RT/PCR. The open reading frame of the consensus was continued, and two additional internal peptides and a WIDMNE catalytic site sequences were recognized (Fig. 2). The nucleotide sequence has been listed as GenBankTM accession number AF016833. A search of the EST chromosomal data bank with the MGA nucleotide sequence revealed that the 3′ end of the untranscribed cDNA had 100% identity with a 147-base cDNA EST GS1365 (38Schuler G.D. Boguski M.S. Stewart E.A. Stein L.D. Gyapay G. Rice K. White R.E. Rodriguez-Tome P. Aggarwal A. Bajorek E. Bentolila S. Birren B.B. Butler A. Castle A.B. Chiannilkulchai N. et al.Science. 1996; 274: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). There were no other EST identified. Because of the length of the cDNA, 2,584- and 2,687-bp fragments of the cDNA (MGA-P1a, N-terminal domain; MGA-P1b, C-terminal domain), each of which included one catalytic site, were ligated into expression vectors and induced in E. coli. Proteins with the expected molecular mass of about 100 kDa were induced by IPTG in these E. colicells from both constructs (Fig. 3 A). When the bacterial proteins were immunoblotted to confirm expressed MGA protein identity, the induced 100-kDa band from MGA-P1a was stained by three HMA mAb (Fig. 3 B), but neither the uninduced bacterial nor the induced MGA-P1b proteins were stained. The same amplimer patterns were visualized after RT/PCR from small intestine, granulocyte, or kidney total RNA. No MGA amplimers were detected from salivary or pancreatic RNA, although control actin amplimers were present. The amplimer pattern suggested that MGA mRNA was expressed in small intestine, granulocyte, and kidney but not in salivary gland or pancreas (Fig. 4 A). A Southern blot from this gel revealed that all the MGA amplimers from small intestine, granulocyte, and kidney were stained by the MGA-P1 probe (data not shown). Zoo blot Southern lanes were positive for human, monkey, rat, mouse, dog, cow, and rabbit genomic DNA cut with EcoRI (Fig. 4 B). Chicken and yeastlanes were negative. Except for EcoRI, the Southern Geno blot revealed only one band per restriction enzyme from human genomic DNA (Fig. 4 C). A map of the MGA probe revealed no internal restriction sites for EcoRI; thus the restriction sites are contained in two introns within the coding 380-bp length of the probe. Two major studies have addressed isolation and synthesis of human MGA proteins (27Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19709-19717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Kelly J.J. Alpers D.H. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 315: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The first study isolated human MGA by chromatography after treatment with papain and found a single band of about 312 kDa with 32–38% glycosylation. This isolated protein had substrate specificities for maltose and whole starch (39Kelly J.J. Alpers D.H. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 315: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The second study utilized in vitro organ culture followed by immunoisolation (27Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19709-19717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Electrophoresis of the precipitate revealed a major band of about 335 kDa (27Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19709-19717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In metabolically labeled explants, a polypeptide of about 285 kDa was visualized at 30 min, and the 335-kDa form was visualized at 60 min. The 335-kDa isoform was found to be a complex glycosylated form of the high mannose 285-kDa form. Treatment of both 335- and 285-kDa forms with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid resulted in a single unglycosylated protein (described as ∼210 kDa in this paper) and revealed that the 335-kDa form was heavily glycosylated. Because of reports of two ∼100 kDa MGA proteins in rats and pigs (18Norén O. Sjöström H. Cowell G.M. Tranum-Jensen J. Hansen O.C. Welinder K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12306-12309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Forstner G. Salvatore A. Lee L. Forstner J. Can. J. Biochem. 1982; 60: 1007-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), the human explants were treated with trypsin, but MGA was not cleaved (27Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19709-19717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have isolated cDNA for human MGA that codes for a single open reading frame of 6,513 nucleotides and includes 58 nucleotide 5′- and 885 nucleotide 3′-untranslated regions. There is a single polyadenylation signal AATAAA at nucleotide 6,404. There is a 174 nucleotide sequence in the 3′-untranslated region that is homologous with a cDNA 3′ EST that has been mapped to chromosome 7 (38Schuler G.D. Boguski M.S. Stewart E.A. Stein L.D. Gyapay G. Rice K. White R.E. Rodriguez-Tome P. Aggarwal A. Bajorek E. Bentolila S. Birren B.B. Butler A. Castle A.B. Chiannilkulchai N. et al.Science. 1996; 274: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). Consistent with the reported distribution of enzyme activity, MGA mRNA was expressed in human small intestine, kidney, and granulocytes (Fig. 4 A). Based upon the pattern obtained on Southern analysis with five different restriction digests, we conclude that a single gene produces this cDNA (Fig. 4 C). As evidenced on another Southern analysis with nine different eukaryotic genomic digests, an MGA gene was detectable in all other mammalian species tested (Fig. 4 B) but not in chicken, known to have maltase and glucoamylase activities (20Hu C.B. Spiess M. Semenza G. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 896: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). There was 92% identity between the five MGA peptides and deduced sequences. The coding region of the cDNA of human MGA reveals a protein of 1,857 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 209,702 Da (Fig. 2). This protein is similar in molecular mass to the smallest band visualized on overloaded lanes and previously identified as a unglycosylated MGA (27Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19709-19717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There was 59% sequence identity between human MGA and SIM proteins. N-terminal and C-terminal halves (each including one catalytic site) of MGA cDNA were expressed inE. coli. The induced proteins were of the expected size, ∼100 kDa (Fig. 3 A), and the N-terminal-expressed bacterial protein selectively reacted with mAbs used to characterize the human MGA starting material (Fig. 3 B). The expression and peptide sequence data support the conclusion that we have cloned the authentic human intestinal MGA cDNA. In the cytoplasmic tail domain, MGA has 26 amino acids with 5 lysines. The N-terminal domain has a hydrophobic segment, a putative type II membrane anchor, with 16 branched chains in this 21-amino acid sequence. The anchoring domain is followed by threonine- and serine-rich regions that have been termed the O-glycosylated stalk in SIM (29Hunziker W. Spiess M. Semenza G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1986; 46: 227-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and human intestinal aminopeptidase (41Kelly J.J. Alpers D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 8216-8221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The region is 52-amino acids long, and there are 20 possible O-glycosylation sites in this MGA sequence. MGA has 24 cysteines; it is reported that all the cysteines of MGA are joined in disulfide linkages (29Hunziker W. Spiess M. Semenza G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1986; 46: 227-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 39Kelly J.J. Alpers D.H. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 315: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Of these cysteines, 11 are in homologous regions in the N-terminal and C-terminal domains (Fig. 2). These have been described as trefoil-type domains (37Henikoff S. Henikoff J.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). There are three additional conserved cysteines that bracket the N-terminal and two that follow the C-terminal signature 1 WIDMNE sites. There are also paired, conserved cysteines within each of the signature 2 sequences (discussed below). MGA has 19 potential N-glycosylation sites. There is a total of 253 sites of potentialO-glycosylation in MGA. It is reported that mature MGA has a total of 28 carbohydrate residues with a total oligosaccharide molecular mass of 50,400 kDa (41Kelly J.J. Alpers D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 8216-8221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Carbohydrates were found to make up about a third of the molecular mass of mature MGA, and no sialic acid could be detected (27Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19709-19717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Kelly J.J. Alpers D.H. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 315: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). All isolated bands were recognized by eight different mAbs specific for hMGA (25Hauri H.P. Sterchi E.E. Bienz D. Fransen J.A.M. Marxer A. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 838-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 26Quaroni A. Nichols B.L. Quaroni E. Hurst K. Herrera L. Weiser M.M. Hamilton S.R. Int. J.

The CNBr fragment patterns and the peptide sequences were identical from the 335- and 285-kDa proteins. The complete removal of all glycosylation from either the 335- or 285-kDa form resulted in a single protein band of ∼210 kDa (27Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19709-19717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which was consistent with the molecular mass as determined by sedimentation equilibrium (39Kelly J.J. Alpers D.H. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 315: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 40Olsen J. Cowell G.M. Konigshofer E. Danielsen E.M. Moller J. Lausten L. Hansen O.C. Welinder K.G. Engberg J. Hunziker W.

Raven Press, Ltd., New York1981: 966-968Google Scholar) and cloning. These observations suggest the presence of a single protein structure in the 335- and 285-kDa forms of human MGA. Only differences in type of glycosylation and molecular mass distinguished the human 335- from 285-kDa bands (27Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19709-19717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Parallel glycosylation differences were found in uncleaved MGA bands immunoisolated from pig or rat intestine (17Danielsen E.M. Sjöström H. Norén O. Biochem. J. 1983; 210: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 19Lee L. Fostner G. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1990; 68: 1103-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the largest band in the rat (similar to human 335 kDa) is a dimer formed by noncovalent adhesion between complex glycosylation sites whose selective removal resulted in a high mannose monomer (similar to human 285 kDa) (19Lee L. Fostner G. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1990; 68: 1103-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Identical results were reported after selective removal of the complex glycosylated chains of human 335-kDa MGA (27Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19709-19717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Is the human 335 band a dimer of the 285-kDa band? High resolution electron microscopic examination of reconstituted vesicles suggested a dimeric structure for pig MGA (43Cowell G.M. Tranum-Jensen J. Sjöström H. Norén O. Biochem. J. 1986; 237: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Attempts to chemically cross-link the human 335-kDa band failed to document a dimeric structure (27Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19709-19717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on 4% SDS gels; however, a noncovalently linked dimeric structure of pig MGA was found on 1% SDS gels (44Danielsen E.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1599-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the 335-kDa band is a complex glycosylation-linked dimeric form of the 285-kDa band. The N-terminal MGA catalytic site is duplicated in the C-terminal. This type of catalytic site (WIDMNE) has an aspartic acid (D) catalytic site (45Quaroni A. Gershon E. Semenza G. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2062516831,"We previously reported that insulin activates nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-R cells overexpressing wild-type insulin receptors (IRs) through a pathway requiring IR tyrosine kinase and Raf-1 kinase activities. We now investigated whether the activation of NF-κB by insulin could serve an antiapoptotic function. Insulin (10−9-10−7m) inhibited apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal in CHO-R cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Insulin antiapoptotic signaling: (i) was dependent on IR number and IR tyrosine kinase activity since it was reduced in parental CHO cells and was abolished in CHO-Y2 cells overexpressing IRs mutated at Tyr1162/1163; (ii) was, like insulin activation of NF-κB, dependent on Raf-1 but not on mitogen-activated protein kinase activity since both processes were decreased by the dominant-negative Raf-1 mutant Raf-C4 whereas they persisted in mitogen-activated protein kinase-depleted cells; and (iii) required NF-κB activation since it was decreased by proteasome inhibitors and the dominant-negative IκB-α (A32/36) mutant and was mimicked by overexpression of the NF-κB c-Rel subunit. We also show that insulin antiapoptotic signaling but not insulin activation of NF-κB involved phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), as supported by the inhibition of the former but not of the latter process by the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002. Inhibition of both NF-κB and PI 3-kinase totally abolished insulin antiapoptotic signaling. Thus insulin exerts a specific antiapoptotic function which is dependent on IR tyrosine kinase activity and is mediated by both a Raf-1-dependent pathway that leads to NF-κB activation and a PI 3-kinase-dependent pathway.

Insulin has long been known as an anabolic hormone that stimulates a number of transporters in the plasma membrane and regulates, at the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic levels, a variety of rate-limiting enzymes involved in the intermediary metabolism. In the past decade, evidence has been provided that insulin also regulates gene expression through the control of various nuclear factors (1O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1109-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). We (2Bertrand F. Philippe C. Antoine P.J. Baud L. Groyer A. Capeau J. Cherqui G. J. Biol.

The NF-κB/Rel family members identified so far include NF-κB1 (p50 and its precursor, p105), NF-κB2 (p52 and its precursor, p100), p65 (Rel A), c-Rel, and Rel B. Prototypical NF-κB is a p50/p65 heterodimer which is usually retained in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells in an inactive form by IκB-α, the best characterized member of the IκB inhibitory protein family (4Grilli M.

The released NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimer can then translocate to the nucleus where it directly binds to its cognate DNA sequence to regulate gene transcription (9Finco T.S. Baldwin A.S.

NF-κB is involved in a number of different cellular processes including the control of apoptosis, a physiological mechanism of programmed cell death that is characterized by nuclear condensation and fragmentation and degradation of DNA into oligonucleosome fragments (11Rudin C.M.

Some studies have implicated NF-κB in promoting apoptosis in certain cells such as neurons (14Grilli M. Pizzi M. Memo M. Spano P.F.

Our study provides evidence for the ability of insulin to trigger antiapoptotic signaling in mammalian cells through the activation of its own receptors. Our results moreover indicate that the antiapoptotic function of insulin requires the integrity of the IR tyrosine kinase and is mediated by both a Raf-1-dependent pathway that leads to NF-κB activation and a PI 3-kinase-dependent pathway.

B, total cell extracts prepared from CHO-R cells or from an acid-load selected clone of CHO-R cells transfected with an expression plasmid coding for a MAPK antisense were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with a MAPK specific antibody. C, CHO-R cells and CHO-R cells expressing a MAPK antisense were serum-deprived for 24 h and then treated for 12 min with or without 10−7m insulin or 20% FCS.

Thereafter, attached and floating cells were collected for DNA extraction and separation on agarose gels. Results are representative of two independent experiments performed on two clones of MAPK-depleted CHO-R cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) For analysis of DNA laddering, 3–5 × 106 cells were used according to the procedure of Herrmann et al.

Briefly, control or treated cells were harvested, collected by centrifugation, and washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline. Pellets were then suspended in 50 μl of lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). After centrifugation for 5 min at 1,600 × g, the supernatant was collected and the extraction was repeated once. The supernatants were incubated with 5 mg/ml RNase A for 2 h at 56 °C in the presence of 1% SDS (w/v). Then 2.5 mg/ml proteinase K were added and the incubation continued for at least 2 h at 37 °C. DNA fragments were precipitated with 2.5 volumes of ethanol in the presence of 0.5 volume of 10 m ammonium acetate at −20 °C overnight. After centrifugation, samples were washed with 70% ethanol and resuspended in loading buffer. Electrophoresis was performed in 1 × TBE buffer on 1% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. CHO-R cells and CHO-R cells expressing c-Rel (clone Rel-3) were maintained for 24 h in serum-free medium (SFM) with or without 10−7m insulin. After 24 h, cells were fixed and stained with the Hoechst 33258 DNA dye. In some experiments, CHO-R cells were cotransfected with pCMV5/lacZ or pEFGP and different expression plasmids. At the indicated times after transfection, cells were maintained for 24 h in SFM in the presence or absence of 10−7m insulin and then fixed and revealed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-d-galactoside or Hoechst 33258. Cells were observed microscopically and quantitation of apoptosis was performed as indicated in the legends to Figs. 3, 5, and6. The lysates from transfected cells were prepared and assayed for luciferase and CAT activities, as described previously (2Bertrand F. Philippe C. Antoine P.J. Baud L. Groyer A. Capeau J. Cherqui G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24435-24441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Results were normalized as indicated in the legend to Table I. CHO-R cells seeded in 6-well plates were serum-deprived for 24 h and treated for 12 min with or without 10−7m insulin or 20% FCS. Then cells were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in lysis buffer containing 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mmNaCl, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm EDTA, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate and supplemented with the following protease inhibitors: phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.1 mm), leupeptin (1 mg/ml), and benzamidine (1 mm). After removal of insoluble material by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 15 min at 4 °C), equal amounts (150 μg) of protein were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with 1 μg of the ERK1 (C-16) polyclonal MAPK antibody, then mixed with 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose and incubated for a further hour. Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g (4 °C, 15 min), washed four times in Triton X-100 lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate). Final pellets were resuspended in 40 μl of kinase buffer containing 10 μg of myelin basic protein and 50 μm ATP (3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). After a 30-min incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 40 μl of 2 × Laemmli's buffer. The samples were treated at 95 °C for 5 min and separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels (29/1). The gels were then stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. Cell lysates prepared as above were separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred onto Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membranes in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine. Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 137 mm NaCl) containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 3% non-fat dry milk for 30 min at room temperature. The blots were then incubated overnight at 4 °C in blocking solution with the MAPK R2 (1:1,000) or c-Rel (1:500) antibodies. Thereafter, gels were washed in Tris-buffered saline and incubated with either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000) or goat anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000) in blocking solution for 1 h. The blots were visualized by the Amersham ECL system. Results are given as the means ± S.E. for the indicated numbers of independently performed experiments. Differences between the mean values were evaluated by Student'st test. CHO-R cells maintained in SFM undergo apoptosis as indicated by characteristic nucleosomal DNA fragmentation starting at 15 h and continuing for 24 h after serum deprivation (Fig. 1 A). The ability of insulin to inhibit apoptosis was studied by incubating the cells in SFM in the presence of increasing concentrations (10−9-10−7m) of the hormone. Insulin reduced apoptosis in CHO-R cells in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1 B) with a slight effect being detected at 10−9m and submaximal and maximal protective effects being observed at 10−8 and 10−7m, respectively. Note that in CHO-R cells the inhibition of apoptosis by 10−8m insulin was equivalent to that elicited by IGF-I at 10−8m, a concentration reported to be maximally effective on this process in different cell types (29Parrizas M. Saltiel A.R. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 154-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar,32Kulik G. Klippel A. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1595-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). As compared with CHO-R cells, parental CHO cells exhibited decreased sensitivity to insulin for inhibition of apoptosis (Fig. 2 A). When these experiments were repeated in CHO-Y2 cells which overexpress tyrosine kinase-deficient IRs mutated at Tyr1162/1163autophosphorylation sites, we observed that, at 10−8 and 10−7m, insulin had no protective effect at all against apoptosis (Fig. 2 B).Figure 2Altered insulin (INS) antiapoptotic signaling in CHO and CHO-Y2 cells. CHO (A) and CHO-Y2 (B) cells grown for 2 days in 10% FCS-Ham's F-12 medium were shifted to SFM and maintained in this medium for 24 h in the presence or absence of the indicated concentrations of insulin following steps as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Results are representative of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To quantify the protective effect against apoptosis exerted by insulin in CHO-R cells, the percentage of apoptotic cells was evaluated by staining CHO-R cells with Hoechst 33258, a fluorescent DNA dye which visualizes the nuclear condensation and the chromatin fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis. Quantitative evaluation of apoptotic cells by Hoechst staining was performed by counting about 2,500 cells at high magnification (× 40). As shown in Fig. 3, the percentage of apoptotic cells amounted to 30.0 ± 2.4% in CHO-R cells maintained for 24 h in SFM. This value is certainly an underestimate of the percentage of cells in the population that undergo apoptosis upon serum withdrawal because cells that have progressed into the later stages of apoptosis detach from the tissue culture dish and are not scored in the assay. However, this does not challenge the validity of this assay which is based on the comparison of values obtained in the same manner. In the presence of insulin, the percentage of apoptotic cells fell to only 3.4 ± 1.0%, indicating that insulin reduces apoptosis in CHO-R cells by about 90%. Taken together, the above results provide evidence for the ability of insulin to exert an antiapoptotic function in CHO-R cells which is mediated by its own receptors and requires the IR tyrosine kinase activity. We previously reported that insulin activates NF-κB in CHO-R cells (2Bertrand F. Philippe C. Antoine P.J. Baud L. Groyer A. Capeau J. Cherqui G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24435-24441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In view of recent findings from several groups (18Beg A.A. Baltimore D.

To this end, we tested the effect of LLnL (5 × 10−5m), a calpain I inhibitor, and Z-AL (3 × 10−5m), a potent and selective proteasome inhibitor, both of which were shown to inhibit NF-κB activity by preventing IκB-α degradation (42Li C.C.H. Dai R.M. Longo D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 292-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 43Griscavage J.M. Wilk S. Ignarro L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3308-3312Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). At the maximally effective concentrations employed, LLnL and Z-AL almost completely abrogated basal and insulin-stimulated NF-κB transcriptional activity in CHO-R cells, as determined by the luciferase assay (Table I). Under these conditions, LLnL and Z-AL had no appreciable effect on the extent of apoptosis induced by a 24-h serum deprivation (Fig. 4). In contrast, LLnL and Z-AL markedly decreased the protective effect exerted by insulin against this process with the latter being more potent than the former (Fig. 4). NH4Cl (2 × 10−3m), a nonspecific lysosomal protease inhibitor which had no effect on insulin-stimulated NF-κB-mediated luciferase activity (Table I), did not modify the inhibitory effect of insulin on apoptosis (Fig. 4). To provide further evidence for a role of NF-κB in insulin antiapoptotic signaling, CHO-R cells were transiently transfected with a β-galactosidase reporter (pCMV5/lacZ) in the presence of an empty vector (pCMV), or of an expression vector coding for the phosphorylation-negative IκB-α (A32/36) mutant, a specific inhibitor of NF-κB ("

Some, such as galectin-1, are isolated as dimers and have a single carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) in each monomer, whereas others, such as galectin-4, are isolated as monomers and have two CRDs in a single polypeptide chain. In the course of studying mouse colon mRNA for galectin-4, we detected a related mRNA that encodes a new galectin that also has two CRDs in a single peptide chain. The new galectin, galectin-6, lacks a 24-amino acid stretch in the link region between the two CRDs that is present in galectin-4. Otherwise, these two galectins have 83% amino acid identity. Expression of both galectin-4 and galectin-6 is confined to the epithelial cells of the embryonic and adult gastrointestinal tract. Galectin-4 is expressed at about equal levels in colon and small intestine but much less in stomach, whereas galectin-6 is expressed at about equal levels throughout the gastrointestinal tract.

In the course of cloning of galectin-4 cDNA from mouse colon, we isolated an additional closely related cDNA. Since the nomenclature of galectins was being established at that time (1Barondes S.H.

Here, we provide the sequence and demonstrate carbohydrate binding activity of this new galectin. In addition, we have begun to address the biological functions of galectin-4 and galectin-6 by determining their distribution in embryonic and adult mouse tissues.

We used Ampli-Taq(Perkin-Elmer Cetus), 250 μm deoxynucleotides, 25 pmol of each primer, and buffer provided by the enzyme manufacturer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.001% (w/v) gelatin). We amplified for 45 cycles, with each cycle consisting of a 40-s denaturation at 95 °C, a 1-min annealing at 60 °C, and a 1–5-min extension at 72 °C. Amplified fragments were visualized on ethidium bromide-stained 1% agarose gels. Total RNA was purified from mouse colon using RNAzol (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX), following the manufacturer's protocol. Concentration was determined by absorbance at 260 nm. Ten micrograms of the RNA was reverse-transcribed for 2 h at 42 °C using 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) in a 20-μl solution containing 50 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 100 mg/ml nuclease-free bovine serum albumin, 1.0 mm deoxynucleotide triphosphates, 20 units RNasin (Promega, Madison, WI), and using 50 pmol of a poly(dT)-containing primer (GACTCGAGTCGACATCGATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT). After reverse transcription, the solution was heated for 5 min at 95 °C, immediately cooled on ice, and diluted to 1 ml with 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA. Ten μl of this solution was used as a template in PCR with different gene-specific primer pairs as described in Figs. 1 and 2. The amplified products were ligated directly to plasmid pCR1000 or pCR3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol.Figure 2Composite sequences of mouse galectin-4 and galectin-6 cDNAs (mG4 and mG6) compared with rat galectin-4 cDNA (rG4).

In brief, the cDNA clone pmG6–2 (Fig. 1), constructed to provide a galectin-6-specific template encompassing all of domain 2, was used as template in a PCR amplification with primers rG4E and rG4K (Fig. 2) and the product cloned into pCR3 (Invitrogen). Primer rG4E has an engineered NcoI site encompassing the ATG encoding Met-161, and rG4K has additional sequence generating a BamHI site downstream of the stop codon. The plasmid DNA prepared from this clone was digested with NcoI and BamHI, and the insert was ligated into NcoI/BamHI-digested pET11d (Novagen, Madison WI). A clone containing the correct galectin-6 fragment was grown and induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside according to the manufacturer's protocol. A pET11d clone with no insert was also grown and induced as a negative control. Lysates were prepared by sonication in MEPBS (58 mm Na2HPO4, 18 mm KH2PO4, 75 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) supplemented with 2.5% Triton X-100 and 2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and β-galactoside-binding proteins purified by affinity chromatography on lactosyl-Sepharose as described by Gitt et al. (18Gitt M.A. Massa S.M. Leffler H.L. Barondes S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10601-10606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot conditions are described below. Total RNA was isolated from various mouse tissues using RNAzol (Tel-Test Inc.). The amount of RNA in each sample was estimated by absorbance at 260 nm. Samples were electrophoresed along with size markers (Life Technologies, Inc.) on a 1.2% agarose gel containing 6% formaldehyde and 20 mm MOPS and the gel transferred to MagnaGraph nylon filters (Micron Separations, Inc., Westborough, MA) in 10 × SSC (1.5 m NaCl, 0.15m sodium citrate). Ultraviolet cross-linking, hybridization buffer, and wash solutions were the same as described (19Gitt M.A. Barondes S.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). For probes, we used PCR-amplified cDNA containing all the coding sequence but no untranslated sequence of rat galectin-4 (12Oda Y. Herrmann J. Gitt M.A. Turck C. Burlingame A.L. Barondes S.H. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5929-5939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or, as a control, human GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) cDNA amplified from a plasmid kindly provided by Dr. Alex Bulfone, Department of Psychiatry, University of California, San Francisco). Both probes were labeled with 32P by random primer polymerization (20Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 266-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (5190) Google Scholar). Hybridization and washing was done at 45 °C. After hybridization with the galectin-4 probe and autoradiography, the galectin-4 probe was removed by washing for 1 h at 65 °C in 50% formamide, 2 × SSC, followed by a 0.1 × SSC rinse at room temperature. The blot was then incubated with the GAPDH probe under the same conditions. Quantitation of bound radioactivity was done using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Antisense35S-cRNA probes were prepared by T7 polymerase transcription of clones pmG4–1 and pmG6–1 (Fig. 1) as described below. In situ hybridization was performed as described by Wilkinson and Green (21Angerer L.M. Angerer R.C. Wilkinson D.G. In Situ Hybridization. IRL Press, Oxford1992: 15-32Google Scholar), using mouse embryos starting at first day of gestation (0.5 day post coitum (dpc)). For generation of antisense galectin-4 and galectin-6 transcripts, DNA from clones pmG4–1 and pmG6–1 (Fig. 1) was linearized with EcoRI and then incubated with 200 μg/ml proteinase K for 30 min at 37 °C to remove RNases, then phenol-extracted and ethanol-precipitated. For sense transcription templates, pmG4–1 and pmG6–1 inserts were released by HindIII/EcoRI digestion and recloned into similarly digested pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). DNA of the resultant clones and a plasmid containing a fragment of human GAPDH cDNA were linearized with HindIII, and treated as above with proteinase K and phenol. A pBluescript SK+-derived plasmid containing a fragment of human GAPDH cDNA was linearized withEcoRI. Galectin-4 and galectin-6 antisense transcripts were generated with T7 RNA polymerase, and sense galectin-4 and galectin-6 transcripts and antisense GAPDH transcripts were generated with T3 RNA polymerase, using the Maxiscript system (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX) with 10 mm each of ATP, GTP, UTP, 0.5 mm CTP, and 75 μCi of [α-32P]CTP per transcription. The transcripts were purified on 5% polyacrylamide gels and eluted by diffusion into 0.5 m ammonium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS. The RNase protection assay was done using an Ambion RNase protection assay kit II. In brief, the antisense transcripts were hybridized overnight at 42 °C with different amounts of total tissue RNA plus yeast RNA carrier. In control experiments, tissue RNA was replaced byin vitro synthesized sense transcripts or omitted entirely. After hybridization, the mixtures were digested with 1 unit/ml RNase A + 200 units/ml RNase T1. The products were concentrated by precipitation and then electrophoresed on an 8 m urea 5% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was autoradiographed with intensifying screens after drying. Densitometric quantitation was done with the PhosphorImager system. Data were corrected for background and the different sizes of protected bands, and then normalized relative to GAPDH mRNA in each sample, as detected with GAPDH-specific probes in either a Northern blot (Fig. 5) or in an RNase protection assay (data not shown). Since dilutions of tissue RNAs resulted in corresponding decreases in amount of protected probe for both galectin-4 and galectin-6, the assay is RNA-limiting under the conditions employed. Molecular weight markers were prepared by incubation of HindIII-cut λ DNA (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 0.08 pmol/μl [α-32P]dCTP, a mixture of 80 μm each dATP, dGTP, dTTP, and Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. In addition, a sequencing ladder was run in an adjacent lane. Total soluble proteins were extracted from mouse stomach, small intestine, and colon using MEPBS supplemented with 300 mm lactose and 2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. After homogenization with an Omni mixer (10 s, medium strength), the extracts were centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 15 min to remove cell debris and the supernatants were immediately boiled in the presence of SDS and 2-mercaptoethanol and applied to a 12% polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the gel bands were transferred to nitrocellulose (Micron Separations, Inc.) as described previously (3Gitt M.A. Wiser M.F. Leffler H. Herrmann J. Xia Y.-R. Massa S.M. Cooper D.N.W. Lusis A.J. Barondes S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5032-5038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The blot was blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin and then probed with a 1/2000 dilution of chicken antibodies raised against domain-I of rat galectin-4 (prepared by HTI-Bioproducts Inc., Ramona, CA). The bound antibodies were visualized using a 1/15,000 dilution of a peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-chicken IgG (Sigma) and the ECL system (Amersham Life Sciences) as peroxidase substrate. To isolate mouse galectin-4 cDNA, we amplified a portion of cDNA prepared from mouse colon RNA by PCR using different pairs of primers designed on the basis of the sequence of rat galectin-4. To our surprise, we obtained two sets of clones, pmG6–1, and pmG4–1 and -2, respectively (Fig. 1), representing two non-identical but very similar sequences resembling the rat galectin-4 cDNA reported by Oda et al. (12Oda Y. Herrmann J. Gitt M.A. Turck C. Burlingame A.L. Barondes S.H. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5929-5939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An additional cDNA fragment (pmG6–2) was obtained using a primer designed to specifically recognize only one of the two sequences, and genomic clones (λLgals6 and pLgals4–1, Fig. 1) that included either sequence (22Gitt M.A. Xia Y.-R.

The composite sequences are given in Fig. 2, and the encoded amino acid sequences are given in Fig. 3 and compared with other bi-CRD galectins. Although the two encoded proteins are very similar, amino acid differences are scattered throughout the protein, which argues against the possibility that alternative splicing gave rise to the two cDNAs. Furthermore, the isolation of the clones containing either sequence (λLgals6 and pLgals4–1, Fig. 1) from genomic DNA of a highly inbred mouse strain (129/SV) that is homozygous at all loci proves that they must indeed be encoded by separate genes, rather than being encoded by alleles of the same genetic locus. Genomic Southern blots offer further support for this conclusion (22Gitt M.A. Xia Y.-R. Atchison R.E. Lusis A.J. Barondes S.H. Leffler H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2961-2970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Hence, they are clearly different proteins. The protein sequence that most closely resembles rat galectin-4 in mouse is designated galectin-4, and the other protein is designated galectin-6. In the structures determined for galectin-1 (23Liao D.I. Kapadia G. Ahmed H. Vasta G.R. Herzberg O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1428-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), and galectin-2 (24Lobsanov Y.D. Gitt M.A. Leffler H. Barondes S.H. Rini J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27034-27038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by x-ray crystallography, the CRD consists of a tightly folded “β-sandwich” of about 130 amino acids. The homologous sequences that are predicted to form these domains in galectin-4 and galectin-6 are indicated by a black bar in Fig. 3. Hence, both galectin-4 and galectin-6 have two CRDs in tandem, each containing all the conserved amino acid residues involved in β-galactoside binding in other galectins (asterisked residues in Fig. 3). In addition, each galectin has three stretches of sequence that are not part of the tightly folded CRDs (indicated by open bars in Fig. 3). One is found as the link region joining the two CRDs, another is found at the N terminus, and a third consists of a few amino acid residues at the C terminus. The major difference between galectins-4 and -6 is that the link region connecting the two CRDs is shorter in galectin-6 (by 22 amino acids compared with rat galectin-4, and by 24 amino acids compared with mouse galectin 4). Excluding this part of the link region, mouse galectins-4 and -6 are 93% and 83% identical on the nucleic acid and amino acid levels, respectively. Mouse, rat, and pig galectin-4 differ to the extent expected for equivalent proteins from these species. Fig. 3 also shows four other galectins (mammalian galectins-8 and -9, and galectins from two invertebrates) with the same bi-CRD organization as galectins-4 and -6 but much greater sequence differences. A distinguishing feature of the two invertebrate galectins is that they have almost no link region. Although galectin-6 has consensus sequences that predict β-galactoside binding, we sought to verify this directly to prove that it is indeed a galectin (1Barondes S.H. Castronovo V. Cooper D.N.W. Cummings R.D. Drickamer K. Feizi T. Gitt M.A. Hirabayashi J. Hughes R.C. Kasai K. Leffler H. Liu F.-T. Lotan R. Mercurio A.M. Monsigny M. Pillai S. Poirier F. Raz A. Rigby P. Rini J.M. Wang J.L. Cell. 1994; 76: 597-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). Lacking a complete cDNA, we tested for carbohydrate binding activity by expressing the C-terminal putative CRD of galectin-6 (amino acids 161–301) in Escherichia coli. After solubilization, the protein product bound to lactosyl-Sepharose and could be eluted with lactose, proving that it has galactoside binding activity. The affinity-purified protein has an apparent molecular weight of 17,000 on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, consistent with the value predicted based on its sequence (15,861), and cross-reacts weakly with anti-galectin-4 antibodies on a Western blot (data not shown). To examine the tissue distribution of galectin-4 and galectin-6 expression, we first used a RPA assay, which permitted the selective detection of each galectin. As probes, we used the antisense transcripts of clones pmG4–1 and pmG6–1 for galectins-4 and -6, respectively (Fig. 1). Since both these probes span the link region, we predicted that they should readily distinguish galectin-4 from galectin-6 in this type of assay, i.e. when RNA and a heterologous probe anneal, the link region will represent a large region of single stranded uncomplementary RNA that is a substrate for the RNases. The undigested probes had the expected length (425 and 600 nt, respectively; Fig. 4 A, lanes a and e), and no fragments were protected with RNA from yeast (lanes c and g). When the galectin-6 probe was mixed with small intestinal RNA and digested with RNases, the size of the largest protected fragment was 335 nt (Fig. 4 A, lane b), which is equal to the length of the galectin-6-specific sequence in this probe (Fig. 4 B). Similarly, with the galectin-4 probe, a 465-nt band was protected (Fig. 4 A, lane f), equal to the length of the mouse galectin-4-specific sequence of this probe. In this case, the 42-nt sequence from the 3′ primer (rG4G) used to generate mG4–1 was probably not protected because it had been derived from the ratgalectin-4 amino acid sequence (12Oda Y.

To further validate the specificity of the RPA, we also tested each probe with galectin-4 sense RNA and galectin-6 sense RNA generated byin vitro transcription of pmG4–1 and pmG6–1, respectively. When galectin-4 sense RNA was probed with the galectin-4 antisense probe, one fragment of about 570 nt was protected (data not shown) corresponding to all the mouse galectin-4-specific sequence (465 nt) in the probe plus 42 nt for the rG4G primer and 60 nt of overlapping vector sequences (gray in Fig. 4 B). Similarly, when galectin-6 sense RNA was probed with the galectin-6 antisense probe, one fragment of 395 nt was protected (data not shown), which is 335 nt of galectin-6-specific RNA + 60 nt of overlapping vector sequence. However, in heterologous hybridizations, i.e. when galectin-4 sense RNA was probed with galectin-6 antisense RNA or galectin-6 sense RNA was probed with galectin-4 antisense RNA, the 570- and 395-nt fragments were not detected (Fig. 6 A, lanes d and h). Hence, the RPA allows specific detection of galectin-4 and galectin-6. For each of these heterologous hybridizations, however, smaller fragments, mainly of about 210 nt and 280 nt, were protected instead (Fig. 4 A, lanes d and h). The only sequence that is long enough and that is similar enough between pmG6–1 and pmG4–1 to produce fragments this size is found before the link region (Fig. 4 B). The 210-nt fragments are likely to contain the sequence between a codon difference at nt 270 (Fig. 2) and the link region (nt 477). The 280-nt fragments are likely to contain all the galectin sequence preceding the link region (250 nt) plus 30 nt from the overlapping vector sequence on this side of the insert (to the left in Fig. 4 B). The fragments of about 210 nt from either probe with intestinal RNA (lanes b and f) is probably also due to galectin-4/galectin-6 cross-hybridization and again contain the sequence between nt 270 and 477 (Figs. 2 and 4 B). The ∼250-nt fragment of the galectin-6 probe protected with intestinal RNA (lane b) probably contains the same “pre-link” sequence, but without the vector sequence found in the 280-nt fragment described above. The 235-nt fragment of the galectin-6 probe formed with intestinal RNA (lane b) and with sense galectin-4 RNA (lane d) may also come from the pre-link sequence. When RNA from different parts of the gastrointestinal tract were probed with the galectin-6 probe, about equal amounts of the 335-nt fragment were found in all cases (Fig. 4 A, lanes i–l). Since the RNA was limiting in this assay, this indicates a relatively even distribution of galectin-6 mRNA along the gastrointestinal tract. The smaller fragments that probably originate from galectin-4 mRNA (as described above) were prominent with RNA from the large and small intestine (lanes i–k), but much less abundant with stomach RNA (lane l). This suggests that the expression of galectin-4 is relatively lower in the stomach compared with intestine. When the same RNA samples were tested with the galectin-4 probe, the largest protected fragment (465 nt) was equally abundant for small and large intestine (lanes o–q). For stomach, the 465-nt fragment was barely detectable (lane r) and only clearly revealed after 5-fold longer exposure of the gel (lane s), indicating that the expression of galectin-4 is indeed lower in the stomach. The group of fragments at ∼210 nt that probably originate from galectin-6 (see above) were about equally abundant with RNA from stomach and intestine (lanes o–r). The RNA from liver and yeast did not protect any of the fragments mentioned above (lanes c, g, m, and n), not"

Detoxification of methylglyoxal is performed by glyoxalase I. Expression of the structural gene of glyoxalase I (GLO1) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae under several stress conditions was investigated using the GLO1-lacZ fusion gene, and expression of the GLO1 gene was found to be specifically induced by osmotic stress. The Hog1p is one of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in S. cerevisiae, and both Msn2p and Msn4p are the transcriptional regulators that are thought to be under the control of Hog1p-MAPK. Expression of the GLO1gene under osmotic stress was completely repressed inhog1Δ disruptant and was repressed approximately 80 and 50% in msn2Δ and msn4Δ disruptants, respectively. A double mutant of the MSN2 and MSN4 gene was unable to induce expression of the GLO1 gene under highly osmotic conditions. Glucose consumption increased approximately 30% during the adaptive period in osmotic stress in the wild type strain. On the contrary, it was reduced by 15% in the hog1Δ mutant. When the yeast cell is exposed to highly osmotic conditions, glycerol is synthesized as a compatible solute. Glycerol is synthesized from glucose, and a rate-limiting enzyme in glycerol biosynthesis is glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD1 gene product), which catalyzes reduction of dihydroxyacetone phosphate to glycerol 3-phosphate. Expression of the GPD1 gene is also under the control of Hog1p-MAPK. Methylglyoxal is also synthesized from dihydroxyacetone phosphate; therefore, induction of the GLO1 gene expression by osmotic stress was thought to scavenge methylglyoxal, which increased during glycerol production for adaptation to osmotic stress.

Several environmental stresses are known to trigger intracellular alterations in organisms; e.g. synthesis of some stress-inducible proteins or the cellular responses against extracellular signals. Organisms of all types show the synthesis of stress-inducible proteins, and the most advanced understandings of the stress-inducible proteins have been obtained from the study of heat shock protein (HSP). 1The abbreviations used are: HSP, heat shock protein; HOG, high osmolarity glycerol; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAPKK, MAPK kinase; STRE, stress response element; bp, base pairs; SOD, superoxide dismutase. A sudden increase in the temperature of the environments in which cells are growing induces increased synthesis of a set of heat shock mRNAs and proteins in the cells. Heat shock response in eukaryotes is different from that in bacterial cells, although the basic mechanisms are similar among eukaryotes. A heat shock transcription factor, which is synthesized constitutively, is trimerized, modified, and translocated by heat shock and binds to a cis-element (the heat shock element) in the promoter region of HSP genes to activate transcription (for review, see Ref. 1Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). Some HSPgenes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, such asHSP104, HSP26, and HSP12, have anothercis-element, termed stress response element (STRE) (5′-AGGGG-3′), in addition to the heat shock element (2Schuller C. Brewster J.L. Alexander M.R. Gustin M.C. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4382-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 3Ruis H. Schuller C. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 959-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). In addition to these HSP genes in S. cerevisiae, the CTT1 gene encoding cytosolic catalase has also been known to have the STRE in its 5′-flanking region (4Marchler G. Schuller C. Adam G. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1997-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Expression of the CTT1 gene is induced by a wide variety of stresses, such as osmotic stress and oxidative stress, as well as heat shock, and these stress signals are thought to be focusing on the STRE (2Schuller C. Brewster J.L. Alexander M.R. Gustin M.C. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4382-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Stress response mechanisms through the STRE are fairy broad; therefore, elucidation of molecular mechanisms for stress response, including screening an appropriate specific marker gene, is of considerable interest. In addition to heat shock response, one of the well-known stress response systems in S. cerevisiae is an osmotic stress response (5Burg M.B. Kwon E.D. Kultz D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1598-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 6Mager W.H. Varela J.C.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 7Varela J.C.S. Mager W. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 721-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Increased osmolarity of environment surrounding the cells induces rapid increase in expression of various kinds of genes. The osmosensing system has been extensively studied in a bacterial system, and existence of a two-component regulatory system was proved (8Forst S.A. Roverts D.I. Res. Microbiol. 1994; 145: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 9Pratt L.A. Silhavy T.J. Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-Component Signal Transduction. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 105-127Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae also has a bacterial-like two-component osmosensing system consisted of Sln1p and Ssk1p (10Maeda T.

When the yeast cell is exposed to a highly osmotic environment, rapid efflux of water from the cell shrinks cell and decreases its turgor pressure. As one of adaptive responses to the osmotic stress, the yeast cell produces glycerol as a compatible osmolyte. A key enzyme in biosynthesis of glycerol is glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is encoded by the GPD1 gene. The GPD1 gene is essential for survival under highly osmotic conditions (14Albertyn J. Hohmann S. Thevelein J.M. Prior B.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4135-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Expression of the GPD1 gene under highly osmotic conditions is under the control of Hog1p (14Albertyn J. Hohmann S. Thevelein J.M. Prior B.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4135-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Hog1p is one of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in S. cerevisiae. Both residues of Thr174 and Tyr176 of the Hog1p are phosphorylated by a MAPK kinase (MAPKK), Pbs2p. Pbs2p is phosphorylated by redundant MAPKK kinases, Ssk2p and Ssk22p. The hog1Δ knockout mutant showed lethality under highly osmotic conditions (2Schuller C. Brewster J.L. Alexander M.R. Gustin M.C. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4382-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 15Brewster J.L. de Valoir T. Dwyer N.D. Winter E. Gustin M.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1760-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). The substrate for glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gpd1p) is dihydroxyacetone phosphate, an intermediate of glycolytic pathway, and the enzyme catalyzes reduction of dihydroxyacetone phosphate to glycerol 3-phosphate in the presence of NADH. Some phosphatases, such as Gpp2p, hydrolyze glycerol 3-phosphate to glycerol (16Norbeck J. Pahlman A.-K. Akhtar N. Blomberg A. Adler L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13875-13881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Dihydroxyacetone phosphate is also a substrate for methylglyoxal synthase that converts dihydroxyacetone phosphate to methylglyoxal (17Hopper D.J. Cooper R.A. Biochem. J. 1972; 128: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 18Cooper R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 44: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 19Tsai P.-K. Gracy R.W. J. Biol.

Methylglyoxal is also synthesized during the triosephosphate isomerase reaction (β-elimination) (21Iyengar R. Rose I.A. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1223-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 22Richard J.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4581-4585Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Methylglyoxal (CH3COCHO) is a typical 2-oxoaldehyde in organisms, and it has two carbonyl carbons, i.e. ketone and aldehyde. Methylglyoxal can react with various biological compounds in cells, such as protein, DNA, and RNA, to inactivate them (23Vander Jagt D.L. Robinson B. Taylor K.K. Hunsaker L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4364-4369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Shapiro R. Cohen B.I. Shiuey S.-J. Maurer H. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and thus it shows cytotoxicity. To avoid overaccumulation of methylglyoxal, the cells from prokaryotes to higher eukaryotes have several defense systems. The glyoxalase system is a ubiquitous scavenging system for methylglyoxal. The glyoxalase system consisted of two enzymes, i.e. glyoxalase I (EC 4.4.1.5), which converts methylglyoxal to S-d-lactoylglutathione in the presence of glutathione, and glyoxalase II (EC 3.1.2.6), which hydrolyzesS-d-lactoylglutathione to d-lactic acid and glutathione. We have been systematically studying the glyoxalase system in various microorganisms, and we have proved that glyoxalase I is required for detoxification of methylglyoxal (25Inoue Y. Kimura A. Adv. Microbiol. Physiol. 1995; 37: 177-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar,26Inoue Y. Kimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25958-25965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We found that the GLO1 gene had two STREs in its 5′-flanking region, and expression of the GLO1 gene was specifically induced by osmotic stress. In this paper, we also describe expression of the GLO1 gene in several gene disruptants, the gene products of which are involved in the HOG (high osmolarity glycerol) MAP kinase pathway, and discuss why the GLO1 gene is expressed under highly osmotic conditions.

The PCR primers used were 5′-CTGAAGGAGGTGCCCGGGGGATAAACCTAC-3′ and 5′-ATCATTCCCGGGTTTCTCAATCTGAATTGG-3′. Both primers were designed to contain the SmaI site (shown by italic letters). A PCR fragment (992 bp) amplified using these primers was digested withSmaI and then introduced to SmaI site of pMC1871, which contained the lacZ gene of Escherichia coli without its original promoter region and N-terminal eight amino acids (31Shapira S., K. Chou J. Richaud F.V. Casadaban M.J. Gene. 1983; 25: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The resultant plasmid (pMCGlac18) was digested withSalI, and the GLO1-lacZ cassette was cloned to the SalI site of the centromere plasmid pRS415 (32Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to yield pRSGlac415. The HOG1 gene with its 5′ and 3′ regions was cloned by PCR using primers HOG1S (5′-GTTGTTAGGAAAGCATGCTTTATCTCCAAG-3′) and HOG1R (5′-CCTTTTATGGGATCCTAATTTCTTAAGGAG-3′). Both primers were designed to contain recognition site for SphI for HOG1S and BamHI site for HOG1R, respectively; these sites are indicated by italic letters. The PCR fragment (2340 bp) was cloned between the SphI and BamHI sites of pUC19 to form pUCHOG1. To construct the hog1Δ::URA3mutant, pUCHOG1 was digested with BalI and HincII, and a 400-bp fragment in the open reading frame of the HOG1 gene was replaced with the URA3 gene to yield pUHOGΔUra3. The resultant plasmid was then digested withSphI and BamHI, and then the hog1Δ::URA3 fragment was introduced to S. cerevisiae YIT2 (cta1Δ) (33Izawa S. Inoue Y. Kimura A. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) to construct the strain YYH1 (cta1Δhog1Δ::URA3). The MSN2gene of YIT2 was disrupted using a plasmid pt32-ΔXB::HIS as described by Estruch and Carlson (27Estruch F. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3872-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), and the disruptant was named YYM2 (cta1Δ msn2Δ). The MSN4 gene was cloned by PCR using primers MSN4S (5′-CGCCACACCAACATGCAACTTCTCCCAAGA-3′) and MSN4R (5′-GCTCTTCCAACCAAGCCTCATTGCTCCTTG-3′). Primer MSN4S corresponded to the region between 533 and 562 bp downstream from the ATG codon, and the MSN4R corresponded to the region between 2653 and 2682 bp from the ATG codon of the MSN4 gene. The PCR fragment (2150 bp) was digested with SphI and EcoRI and then cloned between the SphI and EcoRI sites of pUC19. The resultant plasmid (pUCmsn4) was digested with EcoRV and AflII to delete the 593-bp fragment, which contained the zinc-finger motif of Msn4p (27Estruch F. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3872-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), and then replaced with the URA3 gene to construct pUmsn4ΔUra3. The plasmid was digested with SphI and EcoRI, and the DNA fragment containing the msn4Δ::URA3cassette was introduced to strains YIT2 and YYM2 to construct YYM4 (cta1Δ msn4Δ) and YYM24 (cta1Δ, msn2Δ, and msn4Δ), respectively. the GLO1 gene disruption plasmid (pUGΔHis3) was constructed as follows. A plasmid containing the GLO1 gene, pE24GLO1 (26Inoue Y. Kimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25958-25965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), was digested with SphI, and the GLO1 gene was recloned to the SphI site of pUC19 to form pUGLO1. The plasmid was digested with EcoRV and HapI to delete the 850-bp fragment containing the open reading frame of the GLO1 gene, and it was replaced with the HIS3 gene to form pUGΔHis3. The pUGΔHis3 was digested with SphI, and the glo1Δ::HIS3 fragment was introduced to strain YGS1 (gsh1Δ::LEU2). The strain YGS1 was constructed by using the GSH1-disruption plasmid pYOG1211 (29Ohtake Y. Yabuuchi S. Yeast. 1991; 7: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and strain YPH250 as a host. The double mutant of the GSH1 and GLO1 genes was named YGSL1 (gsh1Δ glo1Δ). The yap1Δ disruptant was constructed by disrupting the YAP1 gene of YPH250 using pSM27 (yap1Δ::HIS3) (28Wu A. Wemmie J.A. Edgington N.P. Goebl M. Guevara J.L. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18850-18858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Disruption of each gene was verified by PCR or Southern analysis, and transformation of yeast was carried out as described in our previous paper (26Inoue Y. Kimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25958-25965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A plasmid, pScCer1, carrying the YAP1 gene (30Hirata D. Yano K. Miyakawa T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 250-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), was digested withEcoRV and ClaI, and the fragment with the YAP1 gene was cloned to the BamHI site of YEp13 after blunting each cohesive end with a Klenow fragment. The resultant plasmid, YEp-YAP1, was introduced into S. cerevisiae YPH250. Overexpression of the YAP1 gene was confirmed by monitoring the growth on SD (2% glucose, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base) minimal agar plate containing 0.2 μg/ml cycloheximide as reported by Hertle et al. (34Hertle K. Haase E. Brendel M. Curr. Genet. 1991; 19: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Each strain of S. cerevisiaecarrying pRSGlac415 was cultured in a test tube containing 5 ml of SD medium (pH 5.5) with appropriate amino acids and bases at 28 °C with shaking for 30 h. A small portion of the culture was transferred to a 200-ml flask containing 50 ml of YPD medium (2% glucose, 2% peptone, 1% yeast extract; pH 5.5) and cultured at 28 °C with shaking for approximately 18 h. When the optical density of the culture at 610 nm (A610) reached approximately 1.0, several chemicals, such as H2O2, NaCl, and ethanol were added, and then culture was continued for another 1 h. For heat shock experiment, the flask containing the culture was transferred to an incubator preheated to 37 °C, and cultivation was continued for another 1 h. After stress treatment, cells were collected, and cell extracts were prepared as described below. Cells were collected by centrifugation (500 × g at 4 °C for 10 min), washed twice with 0.85% NaCl solution, and suspended in 300 μl of 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Cells were transferred to an Eppendorf tube containing an approximately equal volume of glass beads and then agitated with a vortex mixer at maximum speed for 3 min. Cell homogenates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, and resultant supernatants were used as cell extracts. Glyoxalase I activity was assayed as described previously (35Inoue Y. Rhee H.-I. Watanabe K. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Biochem. 1987; 102: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). One unit of the activity was defined as the amount of enzyme forming 1 μmol of S-d-lactoylglutathione per min at 25 °C. Catalase activity was measured according to the method of Roggenkampet al. (36Roggenkamp R. Sahm H. Wagner F. FEBS Lett. 1974; 41: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). One unit of the activity was defined as the amount of enzyme decomposing 1 μmol of H2O2per min at 25 °C. β-Galactosidase activity was measured as described by Miller (37Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-356Google Scholar). One unit of the activity was defined as the amount of enzyme increasing A420 by 1000 per min at 30 °C. Protein was determined by the method of Bradford (38Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Cells of S. cerevisiae YPH250 were cultured in YPD medium until A610 reached approximately 1.0, and then 0.5 m NaCl was added. After 30 min incubation, total RNA was prepared according to the method of Schmitt et al. (39Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). To analyze the effect of the newly synthesized protein for expression of the GLO1 gene in osmotic stress response, cells were pretreated with 50 μg/ml cycloheximide for 15 min before the addition of NaCl. RNA was separated by an agarose gel containing formaldehyde as described by Sambrooket al. (40Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The GLO1 probe was prepared by digesting pUGLO1 with BamHI, and the resultant fragment (837 bp) containing the open reading frame of the GLO1 gene was purified by the low melting point agarose gel electrophoresis, and labeled by [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Corp.) using a kit (Takara). Cells of YIT2 and YYH1 were cultured in a 200-ml flask containing 50 ml of YPD medium untilA610 reached approximately 1.0, and NaCl was added to bring the final concentration of the culture to 0.5m. 1.5 ml of culture was withdrawn periodically, and the A610 and glucose concentrations of the culture were measured using a kit (Glucose B-test Wako). Preparation of cell extracts was essentially same as described above, except that cells were suspended in distilled water instead of 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Cell extracts were used as a source of methylglyoxal in glyoxalase I reaction. The reaction mixture (1 ml) contained 100 μm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 2 mm glutathione, 56 units/ml glyoxalase I (Sigma), and various concentrations of methylglyoxal, or cell extracts. Methylglyoxal and glyoxalase I was purchased from Sigma. Glutathione was obtained from Kohjin (Tokyo, Japan). Restriction enzymes, DNA modification enzymes, and the DNA labeling kit were purchased from Takara Shuzo (Kyoto, Japan). [α-32P]dCTP (6000 Ci/mmol) and nylon membrane (Hybond-N) were obtained from Amersham-Japan (Tokyo, Japan). The glucose assay kit was purchased from Wako Chemicals (Kyoto, Japan). Plasmid pRS415 was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Yap1p is one of the transcriptional regulators in S. cerevisiae, and it closely correlates with glutathione metabolism as well as drug resistance (41Wu A.L. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5832-5839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Grant C.M. Collinson L.P. Roe J.-H. Dawes I.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 43Schnell N.

Chem. 1994; 269: 32592-32597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because detoxification of methylglyoxal is performed by glyoxalase I in the presence of glutathione, we supposed that expression of the GLO1 gene might be regulated by the Yap1p. We then constructed both of the YAP1 overexpressing strain and yap1Δ disruptant and measured the glyoxalase I activity. However, glyoxalase I activity was not affected by the copy number of the YAP1 gene product (wild type, 0.128 ± 0.015 units/mg protein; YAP1 overexpression, 0.145 ± 0.018 units/mg protein; yap1Δ, 0.142 ± 0.022 units/mg protein). By an analysis of the 5′-flanking region of the GLO1 gene, we found two STREs 432 and 229 nucleotides upstream of the initiation (ATG) codon (Fig. 1). Several genes have been reported to have the STRE, such as CTT1, HSP104, HSP26, and DDR2, and expression of such genes is induced by several stresses, such as heat shock, oxidative stress, osmotic stress, ethanol stress, and so on (2Schuller C. Brewster J.L. Alexander M.R. Gustin M.C. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4382-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The CTT1 gene encodes cytosolic catalase, and it was widely used as a marker gene for experiments for stress response analysis through STRE; therefore, we also used CTT1 catalase as a marker. Because S. cerevisiae has another catalase in peroxisome that is encoded by the CTA1 gene (46Cohen G. Rapatz W. Ruis H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), we disrupted the CTA1 gene to specifically monitor the CTT1 catalase activity. The GLO1-lacZ fusion gene was also constructed to quantify the expression of GLO1 gene under several environmental stresses. As shown in Fig. 2 A, expression of GLO1-lacZ was specifically induced by NaCl, and other stresses that could induce expression of the CTT1 gene were not effective for induction of GLO1-lacZ expression. Glyoxalase I activity was also increased when the cells were treated with 0.5 m NaCl, although other stresses did not affect the enzyme activity (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2 B, expression of GLO1-lacZ was induced by not only NaCl but also by other osmotic stresses, including sorbitol. Therefore, induction of GLO1-lacZ expression under high NaCl concentrations was thought to be caused by osmotic stress rather than salt stress.Figure 2Effect of several stresses on expression of GLO1-lacZ fusion gene. A, cells of S. cerevisiae YIT2 carrying pRSGlac415 were cultured at 28 °C in YPD medium until A610 reached approximately 1.0, and 0.4 mm H2O2, 0.5 mNaCl, and 7.5% ethanol (EtOH) were added to the culture. For the heat shock experiment, a flask containing the culture was transferred to an incubator preheated to 37 °C. Cells were then cultured for another 1 h, and cell extracts were prepared as described in the text. Black bars indicate β-galactosidase (GLO1-lacZ) activity, and white bars indicate CTT1 catalase activity. B and C, S. cerevisiae YIT2 carrying pRSGlac415 was cultured at 28 °C in YPD medium untilA610 reached approximately 1.0, and 0.5m NaCl, 0.5 m KCl, and 1.0 msorbitol were added to the culture. Cells were then cultured for another 1 h, and cell extracts were prepared as described in the text. B, β-galactosidase (GLO1-lacZ) activity;C, CTT1 catalase activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Fig. 3 showed the comparison of optimal concentration of NaCl for induction of GLO1-lacZ and CTT1. Induction of both gene expression was observed between the range of 0.3 m and 0.7 m NaCl. Maximum induction of GLO1-lacZ was observed at 0.5 mNaCl, whereas that of CTT1 was observed at 0.3m. At 1.4 m NaCl, no induction was observed in both genes. To confirm that an increase of β-galactosidase activity from the GLO1-lacZ fusion gene was due to the increased expression of the GLO1 gene, Northern blot analysis was done. Because the optimal concentration of NaCl for induction of GLO1-lacZ was 0.5 m (Fig. 3), S. cerevisiae YPH250 was treated with 0.5 mNaCl, and the mRNA level of the GLO1 gene was measured. As shown in Fig. 4, the GLO1mRNA level increased by osmotic stress. Therefore, increased activity of β-galactosidase from GLO1-lacZ by osmotic stress was confirmed to reflect the expression of GLO1 gene. To investigate whether de novo synthesis of some factors is required for induction of the GLO1 gene transcription, the cells were pretreated with cycloheximide to block protein synthesis and then exposed to osmotic stress. As shown in Fig. 4, mRNA level of the GLO1 gene was also increased, even though protein synthesis was blocked. Therefore, induction of GLO1 gene expression was not dependent upon the newly synthesized protein(s) during osmotic stress treatment. S. cerevisiae has been reported to have a bacterium-like two-component system for sensing high osmolarity of environments. Sln1p and Ssk1p are, respectively, a sensor kinase for high osmolarity and a regulator to mediate the signal to the redundant MAPKK kinases Ssk2p and Ssk22p. Activated MAPKK k"

Neuropeptides are a structurally diverse group of hormones and neurotransmitters that bind to a related subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (1Burbach J.P.H. Meijer O.C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 227: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and function in neuron-to-neuron communication, as well as in signaling in the immune system and in tissue restructuring. Neuropeptides and their receptors are the principal driving force behind one of the most clinically aggressive cancers, small cell lung cancer (SCLC). 1The abbreviations used are: SCLC, small cell lung cancer; SPD-D, [d-Arg1,d-Phe5,d-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P; GRP, gastrin-releasing peptide; GRPR, GRP receptor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; IL, interleukin; DME, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum. 1The abbreviations used are: SCLC, small cell lung cancer; SPD-D, [d-Arg1,d-Phe5,d-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P; GRP, gastrin-releasing peptide; GRPR, GRP receptor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; IL, interleukin; DME, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum. SCLC tumors sustain their growth, in part, by maintaining neuropeptide autocrine and paracrine loops (2Sethi T. Langdon S. Smyth J. Rozengurt E. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 2737s-2742sPubMed Google Scholar). These tumor cells in culture can secrete and respond mitogenically to multiple neuropeptides (3Bunn Jr., P.A. Chan D. Stewart J. Gera L. Tolley R. Jewett P. Tagawa M. Alford C. Mochzuki T. Yanaihara N. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3602-3610PubMed Google Scholar). For this reason, broad spectrum antagonists of neuropeptides have been examined for their ability to prevent growth of SCLC cells in vitro and in vivo. One such compound, [d-Arg1,d-Phe5,d-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P (SPD-D) (4Woll P.J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1859-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) can not only inhibit the action of substance P (5Tsou K. Wu S. Lu Y. Way E.L. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1985; 110: 155-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) but also inhibit binding and action of gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), arginine vasopressin (6Zachary I. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19031-19034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and endothelin (7Gu X.H. Casley D.J. Nayler W.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 1991Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To date, much of the research on the mechanism of action of SPDs has focused on their abilities to block ligand binding and Ca2+ flux, as well as on their cytostatic or cytotoxic effects on SCLC cells in culture (8Reeve J.G. Bleehen N.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1313-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The signal transduction pathways that mediate neuropeptide actions are rapidly becoming more clear. It is known that neuropeptides induce calcium mobilization by a pertussis toxin-insensitive mechanism, suggesting a role for Gq (9Wang J.L. Kalyanaraman S. DeVivo M. Gautam N. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Heterologous expression of receptors and G proteins in Sf9 cells have shown functional coupling between one neuropeptide receptor, NK-1, and Gz, Gq, and G13 but not Gs (10Barr A.J. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2223-2229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In addition to the mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, neuropeptides can have diverse effects on cells in culture, including the induction of mitogenesis (11Rozengurt E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the activation of both the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (12Faure M. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7851-7854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (13Cadwallader K. Beltman J. McCormick F. Cook S. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 795-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 14Dabrowski A. Grady T. Logsdon C.D. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5686-5690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family, and formation of actin structures such as filopodia (15Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1942-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar) and stress fibers (16Ridley A.J. Hall A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2600-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 17Ridley A.J. Hall H. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3806) Google Scholar). The activation of JNK and the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton are most likely mediated by members of the G12 family of G proteins, such as Gα12 and Gα13 (18Prasad M.V.V.S.V. Dermott J.M. Heasley L.E. Johnson G.L. Dhanasekaran N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18655-18659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 19Buhl A.M. Johnson N.L. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24631-24634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The regulation of ERKs by neuropeptides is more complicated, suggesting a role for PKC (20Pong L. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), G protein βγ subunits (12Faure M. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7851-7854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanism possibly involving a Gi family member (21Letterio J.J. Coughlin S.R. Williams L.T. Science. 1986; 234: 1117-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The effects of SPD-D and similar compounds on these signaling events downstream of neuropeptide receptors suggest a mechanism that is more complicated than that of a classical antagonist. The ERK response and the Ca2+ response through neuropeptide receptors are affected differently by SPD-D (22Seckl M.J. Higgins T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29453-29460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 23Mitchell F.M. Heasley L.E. Qian N.-X. Zamarripa J. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8623-8628Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, SPD-D inhibits Ca2+ mobilization induced by bombesin (which acts on the human GRP receptor) with a maximal effect at 10 μmand an estimated IC50 of 2 μm. In contrast, SPD-D inhibits ERK-2 activation with a maximal effect at 50 μm and an estimated IC50 of 9 μm (22Seckl M.J. Higgins T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29453-29460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In the presence of 3 nm bombesin, 10 μm SPD-D caused a nearly complete inhibition of the Ca2+ response and an approximately 50% inhibition of the ERK-2 response (22Seckl M.J. Higgins T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29453-29460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In a similar manner, 50 μm SPD-D caused a 100% inhibition of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate generation induced by 50 nm bombesin, but only a 20% inhibition of the total ERK response (23Mitchell F.M. Heasley L.E. Qian N.-X. Zamarripa J. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8623-8628Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In an effort to uncover the mechanism behind these differences, we examined the effect of SPD-D on other signal transduction pathways downstream of neuropeptide receptors, such as the activation of JNK and rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton. To our surprise, rather than acting to inhibit these responses caused by bombesin, SPD-D stimulated both JNK and cytoskeletal changes. These responses are shown to occur through the action of SPD-D on neuropeptide receptors, because rat 1A cells, which do not respond to SPD-D with a JNK response, gain the ability to respond when transfected with the GRP receptor. SPD-D can also act as an agonist toward chemoattractant receptors in human neutrophils. We show that SPD-D binds to both of the cloned interleukin-8 (IL-8) receptors, and the peptide can stimulate an increase in neutrophil migration and Ca2+ mobilization. These results indicate that the mechanism of action of SPD-D is more complex than has previously been appreciated. Rather than acting as a classical antagonist, SPD-D is capable of initiating signals in multiple cell types in a receptor-dependent manner. Unlike a classical agonist, however, SPD-D does not induce receptor signaling to all available signal transduction pathways. SPD-D selectively activates JNK and actin reorganization in fibroblasts in the absence of Ca2+ mobilization. This is the first description of such a biased agonist. We expect that this novel mechanism of action will prove an important component of the cytotoxic activity such compounds have on SCLC. An understanding of these mechanisms is crucial to the development of this type of therapy for future clinical use. [d-Arg1,d-Phe5,d-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P, purchased from Bachem Bioscience, was stored in powder form at −20 °C and dissolved to 20 mm in degassed, sterile water and stored under argon for no more than 4 weeks. Rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin was purchased from Molecular Probes. Rabbit anti-β-galactosidase antibody was purchased from Cappel. Recombinant human IL-8 was purchased from R&D Systems, recombinant C5a was from Sigma, and [Tyr4] bombesin was from Peninsula Laboratories. 125I-Labeled C5a, IL-8, and bombesin were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum (DME-10% FCS) and split every 3 days. For each experiment, Swiss 3T3 cells were split 1:10 and grown for 1 day in DME-10% FCS and then starved for 1 day in DME-0.1% calf serum prior to the experiment. Rat 1A fibroblasts were grown in DME-10% calf serum. Cells transiently expressing the human gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) were generated using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were transfected with pCMV5 or pCMV5-GRPR and grown for 1 day in DME-10% FCS and then split 1:5 and grown for 1 more day in 10% FCS. The cells were then starved for 1 day in 0.1% calf serum prior to the experiment. Human neutrophils were isolated from healthy donors and stored for no more than 6 h at 4 °C in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer containing 0.25% human serum albumin. Chemotaxis assays were performed essentially as described (24Knall C. Worthen G.S. Johnson G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3052-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Cells were treated as indicated and lysed in JNK lysis buffer, and JNK activity was determined as described previously (25Mitchell F.M. Russell M. Johnson G.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Bands were visualized by autoradiography and quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Cells were transfected with the empty vector (pCMV5) or with pCMV5-GRPR using Pfx-3 transfection reagent (InVitrogen). After 1 day of recovery, the cells were placed with 0.1% calf serum into 12-well plates and starved for 1 day. The cells were then loaded with 1 μm Fluo-3 AM (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at room temperature in HEPES-buffered DME-0.1% calf serum. The cells were washed and intracellular calcium was determined by imaging on a laser confocal microscope. The images were processed using COMOS software (Bio-Rad). The brightness of each × 40 field of approximately 10 cells was determined and divided by the baseline value to give the relative Fluo-3 fluorescence. Swiss 3T3 cells were grown on glass coverslips for 1 day in DME-10% FCS and starved 1 day in DME-0.1% calf serum, followed by a 1-day starvation in DME-0.1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were treated for 10 min with control medium or medium containing the indicated concentration of SPD-D and fixed for 10 min in 3% paraformaldehyde, 3% sucrose, phosphate buffered saline. The cells were then permeablilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, nonspecific protein binding was blocked with a 30-min incubation in DME-10% FCS, and the actin cytoskeleton was stained with rhodamine-phalloidin at a 1:40 dilution. The slides were mounted ino-phenylendiamine mounting medium and visualized on a digital confocal microscope. The images were deconvolved using Slidebook software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Inc.) Cells were grown on glass coverslips and starved as described above. Microinjection was performed using an Eppendorf microinjector with an injection pressure of 600 hectopascals and an injection time of 0.3 s. A mixture of pCMV5-lacZ and either pCMV5 or pCMV5-N19Rho was microinjected into approximately 100 cells/coverslip. The cells were incubated for 2 h and then treated with or without SPD-D for 10 min, fixed, and stained as above, with the addition of anti-β-galactosidase antibody (Cappel) and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary (Jackson Immunologicals). HEK-293 cells stably expressing human C5a, CXCR1, or GRP receptors were grown in DME-10% FCS, 400 μg/ml hygromycin. Membranes were prepared as described (26Duzic E. Coupry I. Downing S. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9844-9851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and diluted in binding buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mmMgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) at a concentration of 0.05 mg/ml. Membranes were incubated with 125I-labeled C5a, IL-8, or bombesin (0.1 nm) at 25 °C for 1 h in the presence of unlabeled competing ligands in a 96-well microtiter plate. At the end of the incubation, the assay was terminated by the addition of ice-cold 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, followed by rapid filtration over glass fiber filters. The filters were dried and coated with scintillation fluid and counted on a TopCount scintillation counter (Packard). Bombesin, a peptide agonist of the GRP receptor, was found to stimulate JNK activation in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (Fig. 1 A) with a dose response that is similar to the stimulation of ERK activity (23Mitchell F.M. Heasley L.E. Qian N.-X. Zamarripa J. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8623-8628Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) in these cells (data not shown). 50 μm SPD-D was used in previous studies to inhibit inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate generation and ERK activation by bombesin (23Mitchell F.M. Heasley L.E. Qian N.-X. Zamarripa J. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8623-8628Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Rather than inhibiting bombesin-stimulated JNK activation, 50 μm SPD-D caused a similar activation of JNK (Fig. 1 A), which reached a maximum at 5 min (Fig. 1 B). This activity was sustained for 30 min and returned to baseline by 60 min (data not shown). The dose response curve for JNK activation is shown in Fig. 1 C. The maximum activation was reached at 40 μm. The activation of JNK by SPD-D is surprising because thus far this peptide has been described as a competitive antagonist that acts by binding to the receptor and blocking binding of neuropeptides (4Woll P.J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1859-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The activation of JNK suggests that the peptide has agonist properties, not unlike similar compounds based on the structure of substance P (27Bailey S.J. Jordan C.C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1984; 82: 441-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar,28Hawcock A.B. Hayes A.G. Tyers M.B. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1982; 80: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, this agonist activity is unique in that SPD-D does not mobilize Ca2+ in Swiss 3T3 cells (22Seckl M.J. Higgins T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29453-29460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To test whether this unique agonist property was the result of SPD-D binding to neuropeptide receptors, we used a transient transfection assay in another cell line, rat 1A fibroblasts. Untransfected rat 1A fibroblasts failed to respond to a dose of SPD-D as high as 50 μm. When these cells were transiently transfected with the human GRP receptor, the basal JNK activity increased (Fig. 2 A). This increase in the basal JNK activity is most likely due to spontaneous activity in the expressed receptor, similar to that seen with the bradykinin receptor (29Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Mathis S.A. Herzig M.C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25970-25973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the calcitonin receptor (30Shyu J.-F. Inoue D. Baron R. Horne W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31127-31134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), which activate adenylate cyclase in the absence of agonist when overexpressed. Cells transiently expressing the GRP receptor gained the ability to respond to SPD-D (Fig. 2 A). SPD-D can therefore stimulate JNK activity through the GRP receptor. Rat 1A cells transfected with the empty vector did not respond to bombesin with an increase in intracellular calcium (Fig. 2 B), but when these cells were transfected with the GRP receptor, 50 nm bombesin caused a rapid Ca2+flux. SPD-D did not stimulate Ca2+ mobilization in rat 1A fibroblasts with or without the GRP receptor (Fig. 2 B). This is in agreement with the inability of SPD-D to cause calcium flux in Swiss 3T3 or SCLC cells (4Woll P.J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1859-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 22Seckl M.J. Higgins T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29453-29460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In these systems, SPD-D has been described as a competitive antagonist of bombesin and other neuropeptides. To confirm this competitive antagonism, we tested the ability of SPD-D to inhibit bombesin-stimulated calcium flux in receptor-expressing rat 1A cells (Fig. 2 C). Whereas 50 μm SPD-D was able to inhibit calcium mobilization induced by 30 nm bombesin, 300 nm bombesin was able to overcome this inhibition. Neuropeptide-induced Ca2+mobilization in fibroblasts is mediated by members of the Gq family of α subunits (9Wang J.L. Kalyanaraman S. DeVivo M. Gautam N. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), whereas it is likely that JNK activation is mediated by G12 family members (31Dhanasekaran N. Dermott J.M. Cell. Signalling. 1996; 8: 234-245Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). SPD-D therefore acts as a biased agonist, activating G12and subsequent signaling components, without activating Gqand its downstream effectors. An alternative explanation for the lack of Ca2+mobilization by SPD-D is that SPD-D activates a receptor that initiates a signal transduction pathway that inhibits Ca2+mobilization. To test this, we treated rat 1A cells with 10% fetal calf serum. Serum induced a rapid, sustained Ca2+ flux, which was not inhibited by SPD-D in untransfected cells (data not shown) or in cells expressing the GRP receptor (Fig. 2 C). This and the fact that 300 nm bombesin can stimulate calcium mobilization in the presence of 50 μm SPD-D show that SPD-D inhibition of calcium mobilization is through competitive antagonism. In addition to activating JNK, bombesin induces the formation of actin stress fibers in Swiss 3T3 cells (17Ridley A.J. Hall H. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3806) Google Scholar). Other neuropeptides also cause reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. For example, bradykinin causes the formation of peripheral actin microspikes and filopodia in Swiss 3T3 cells (15Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1942-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Like JNK activation, this cytoskeletal reorganization is mediated by the G12family of G proteins (19Buhl A.M. Johnson N.L. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24631-24634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). To further test the idea that SPD-D can activate G12 in the absence of Gq activation, we visualized the actin cytoskeleton in cells treated with SPD-D. When 10 μm SPD-D was added to quiescent, starved Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts for 10 min, structures formed at the periphery of the cell outside the cortical actin ring (Fig. 3 C, arrow). These structures resembled peripheral actin microspikes as they were described in Swiss 3T3 cells treated with bradykinin (15Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1942-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Some cells showed the beginnings of stress fibers forming at the periphery (Fig. 3 D, arrow). At 25 μm SPD-D, structures resembling filopodia formed (Fig. 3 E, arrow). Significant lamellar actin structures were found in most cells at this dose (Fig. 3 F). These structures are two-dimensional, as opposed to membrane ruffles, in which the edge of the cell lifts off of the coverslip. At 50 μm SPD-D, adhesion plaques (Fig. 3 G), as well as lamellar actin structures (Fig. 3 H), formed. At concentrations up to 100 μm, the cells retained their ability to exclude trypan blue dye for up to 20 min (data not shown). This effect of SPD-D on the cytoskeleton again demonstrates that SPD-D acts as a biased agonist, stimulating G12 signal transduction pathways. Previous work by this laboratory has mapped out the sequence of events by which G12 can induce cytoskeletal reorganization (19Buhl A.M. Johnson N.L. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24631-24634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). This response is mediated by the low molecular weight GTP-binding protein Rho. Therefore, if Rho is inactivated by injection of C3 toxin into the cell or inhibited by the expression of a competitive inhibitory mutant of Rho, N19Rho-A, G12-induced stress fiber formation does not occur. To further show that SPD-D-induced responses, such as actin stress fiber formation, are mediated by G12, a plasmid encoding N19Rho-A was microinjected into Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts along with a second construct encoding β-galactosidase. Injected cells, identified by staining for β-galactosidase, could no longer form stress fibers in response to SPD-D (Fig. 4), whereas the neighboring cells that were not microinjected formed stress fibers. This laboratory has previously shown that microinjection of β-galactosidase alone does not interfere with actin stress fiber formation (19Buhl A.M. Johnson N.L. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24631-24634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The effect of N19Rho-A on cytoskeletal reorganization provides further evidence that SPD-D acts on the cells through G12. SPD-D has been shown to bind to many neuropeptide receptors, acting as a broad spectrum antagonist (3Bunn Jr., P.A. Chan D. Stewart J. Gera L. Tolley R. Jewett P. Tagawa M. Alford C. Mochzuki T. Yanaihara N. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3602-3610PubMed Google Scholar). These receptors are related to one another by sequence homology in a large subfamily. Also members of this family are non-neuropeptide receptors such as those for α-thrombin, C5a, formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine, and IL-8 (32Fruh T. Saika H. Svensson L. Pitterna T. Sakaki J. Okada T. Urade Y. Oda Y. Fujitani Y. Takimoto M. Yamamura T. Inui T. Makatani M. Takai M. Umemura I. Teno N. Toh H. Hayakawa K. Murata T. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1996; 6: 2323-2328Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In an effort to determine how broad the receptor specificity of SPD-D was, we tested binding of SPD-D to two of these receptors, as well as to the human GRP receptor. Receptor-transfected cells were used to make membrane fractions for direct binding assays. As shown in Fig. 5, SPD-D can compete for binding of IL-8 to the human CXCR1 with an IC50 of 12.8 μm. In agreement with the work of other groups (4Woll P.J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1859-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), SPD-D inhibits binding of bombesin to the human GRP receptor with an IC50 of 5.8 μm. SPD-D does not inhibit binding of C5a to its receptor. Thus, the spectrum of receptors to which SPD-D binds is even broader than has been previously suspected. We know from the data presented above that SPD-D has agonist activity against the GRP receptor. We next tested whether SPD-D also has agonist activity against chemoattractant receptors. The IL-8 receptors are expressed in chemotactic cells of myeloid lineage and are involved in the chemotactic response (33Schroeder J.M. Mrowietz U. Morita E. Christophers E. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 3474-3483PubMed Google Scholar). Neutrophils express not only the two IL-8 receptors but also several other chemoattractant receptors, including the substance P receptor NK-1 (34Serra M.C. Bazzoni F. Bianca V.D. Greskowiak M. Rossi F. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 2118-2124PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore considered it likely that SPD-D would have an affect on chemotaxis. The chemotaxis assay is performed in a blind well Boyden chamber in which two sections are separated by a filter. The lower chamber is filled with medium containing a chemoattractant, such as IL-8, and the upper chamber is filled with medium containing human neutrophils. If the cells sense a gradient of chemoattractant, they will migrate through the filter toward the lower chamber (24Knall C. Worthen G.S. Johnson G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3052-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Neutrophils will also respond to most chemoattractants with an increase in random migration that is irrespective of the presence of a gradient. If both the upper and lower chambers contain chemoattractant, there will be an increase in the movement of the cells through the filter due to this increased nondirected motion, called chemokinesis. Thus, the chemotaxis assay, in which a gradient is present, actually measures chemotaxis and chemokinesis. The amount of migration measured in the chemokinesis assay, in which there is no gradient, must be subtracted from the chemotaxis value. Human neutrophils responded to the presence of SPD-D with an increase in migration (Fig. 6), once again showing that it has agonist properties. This migration can entirely be accounted for by chemokinesis because chemotaxis was not significantly greater than chemokinesis. The dose response for chemokinesis (data not shown) was different from the dose response for SPD-D-induced JNK in fibroblasts (Fig. 1 C). Neutrophils were able to respond to a much lower dose, as low as 1.5 μm (Fig. 6). This suggests either that the receptor that mediates this response in neutrophils has a higher affinity for SPD-D than either neuropeptide receptors or the IL-8 receptors or that the chemotaxis assay is much more sensitive than the competition binding analysis or the JNK activation. The identity of the receptor that mediates neutrophil chemotaxis in response to SPD-D is not known. Both the IL-8 receptors and the substance P receptor NK-1 are candidates. IL-8 and substance P also cause a mobilization of Ca2+ in neutrophils. The mechanism for this Ca2+ mobilization is different from that elicited by neuropeptides in fibroblasts, in that it is sensitive to pertussis toxin treatment (35Wu D. LaRosa G.J. Simon M.I. Science. 1993; 261: 101-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 36Takenouchi T. Munekata E. Peptides. 1995; 16: 1019-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The pathway"

In this paper, we report a biochemical characterization of the <i>eps15R</i> gene product(s). In NIH-3T3 cells, three proteins of 125, 108, and 76 kDa were specifically recognized by anti-eps15R sera. The 125-kDa species is a bona fide product of the <i>eps15R</i>gene, whereas p108 and p76 are most likely products of alternative splicing events. Eps15R protein(s) are tyrosine-phosphorylated following epidermal growth factor receptor activation in NIH-3T3 cells overexpressing the receptor, even at low levels of receptor occupancy, thus behaving as physiological substrates. A role for eps15R in clathrin-mediated endocytosis is suggested by its localization in plasma membrane-coated pits and <i>in vivo</i> association to the coated pits' adapter protein AP-2. Finally, we demonstrate that a sizable fraction of eps15R exists in the cell as a complex with eps15 and that its EH domains exhibit binding specificities that are partially distinct from those of eps15. We propose that eps15 and eps15R are multifunctional binding proteins that serve pleiotropic functions within the cell."

The physiological significance of these effects is unknown in most cases. To begin to understand how these compounds inhibit growth, we have studied Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. Growth of tryptophan (Trp−) auxotrophs was more strongly inhibited by phytosphingosine (PHS) than was growth of Trp+ strains, suggesting that PHS diminishes tryptophan uptake and starves cells for this amino acid. This hypothesis is supported by data showing that growth inhibition is relieved by increasing concentrations of tryptophan in the culture medium and by multiple copies of the TAT2 gene, encoding a high affinity tryptophan transporter. Measurement of tryptophan uptake shows that it is inhibited by PHS. Finally, PHS treatment induces the general control response, indicating starvation for amino acids. Multiple copies of TAT2 do not protect cells against two other cationic lipids, stearylamine, and sphingosine, indicating that the effect of PHS on tryptophan utilization is specific. Other data demonstrate that PHS reduces uptake of leucine, histidine, and proline by specific transporters. Our data suggest that PHS targets proteins in the amino acid transporter family but not other distantly related membrane transporters, including those necessary for uptake of adenine and uracil.

The long chain base component of sphingolipids inhibits cell growth under many conditions and is cytotoxic to some cell types, but the mechanisms underlying these phenomenona are not well characterized. Interest in the effect of long chain bases on cells was stimulated by the observation that they are potent inhibitors of protein kinase C (1Hannun Y.A. Loomis C.R. Merrill Jr., A.H. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12604-12609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Merrill Jr., A.H. Sereni A.M. Stevens V.L. Hannun Y.A. Bell R.M. Kinkade Jr., J.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1986; 261: 12616-12623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since these initial studies, there has been a growing number of reports showing effects of long chain bases on a variety of cells (reviewed in Refs. 4Merrill A.H.J. Liotta D.C. Riley R.E. Bell R.M. Lipid Second Messengers. 8. Plenum Press, New York1996: 205-237Google Scholar and 5Spiegel S. Merrill Jr., A.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1388-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Most of these studies have been performed on cultured mammalian cells, and it is not clear if the observed effects of long chain bases actually cause growth inhibition or whether some secondary effect inhibits growth. To try and understand how long chain bases inhibit growth, we have examined the effect of long chain bases on Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. Sphingolipids are an essential component of wild type S. cerevisiae cells (6Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 253-272PubMed Google Scholar). Synthesis of the long chain base component of sphingolipids is similar to that in mammals and begins with the condensation of serine and palmitoyl-CoA to yield 3-ketosphinganine (for review, see Ref. 7Merrill Jr., A.H. Jones D.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1044: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The 3-ketosphinganine is converted to the long chain base sphinganine (dihydrosphingosine) which isN-fatty-acylated to yield dihydroceramide. Dehydrogenation of dihydroceramide in animals yields ceramide containing the long chain base sphingosine, which is rapidly converted to sphingolipids by the addition of polar components to the 1-hydroxyl group. The predominant ceramides in fungi and plants containN-α-hydroxyfattyacylphytosphingosine (6Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 253-272PubMed Google Scholar). Phytosphingosine (PHS) 1The abbreviations used are: PHS, phytosphingosine; Gap1p, a general amino acid transporter;GCN4, gene encoding a transcription activator; PHSR, resistance to PHS; PHSS, sensitivity to PHS; PYED, complex medium; SD, defined medium; TAT1, gene encoding the high affinity tyrosine transporter; TAT2, a gene encoding a high affinity tryptophan transporter. lacks the 4,5-double bond found in sphingosine and has instead an hydroxyl group at the 4-position. In S. cerevisiae and other fungi, the 1-hydroxyl of phytoceramide is modified by addition of myo-inositol phosphate to form inositol phosphoceramide, which is then mannosylated to yield mannose-inositol phosphoceramide. The final step in S. cerevisiae sphingolipid synthesis is the addition of inositol phosphate to mannose-inositol phosphoceramide to yield the major sphingolipid mannose-(inositol-P)2 ceramide (8Smith S.W. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3395-3405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Steiner S. Smith S. Waechter C.J. Lester R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

When grown in complex medium having a non-inhibitory concentration of long chain base, S. cerevisiae cells are able to take up the long chain base, by an unknown mechanism that requires the multimembrane-spanning Lcb3 protein (11Qie L. Nagiec M.M. Baltisberger J.A. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16110-16117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and incorporate it into ceramide and other sphingolipids (12Pinto W.J. Srinivasan B. Shepherd S. Schmidt A. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2565-2574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, even the non-biological threo isomer of sphinganine can be incorporated into sphingolipids (12Pinto W.J. Srinivasan B. Shepherd S. Schmidt A. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2565-2574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When present in high enough concentrations, most long chain bases will inhibit growth of S. cerevisiae cells. However, growth inhibition is only seen if the culture density is kept very low, for example, less than 104 cells/ml (13Ella K.M. Qi C. Dolan J.W. Thompson R.P. Meier K.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 340: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). After initiating these studies, we observed that growth is more strongly inhibited by long chain bases in strains requiring amino acids (auxotrophic strains), particularly tryptophan and leucine. Amino acid transport in S. cerevisiae is a complex and highly regulated process because amino acids serve not only as building blocks for protein synthesis, but also as a source of nitrogen when a preferred nitrogen source, such as ammonia, glutamine, or asparagine, is unavailable. In the absence of a preferred nitrogen source, for example, when proline or urea are the primary nitrogen source, amino acids are transported by both specific amino acid permeases and by the general amino acid permease (Gap1p; Ref. 14Jauniaux J.C. Grenson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Gap1p transports all natural l-amino acids found in proteins and also ornithine, citrulline, and several d-amino acids and toxic amino acid analogs (15Wiame J.M. Grenson M. Arst H.N. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1985; 26: 1-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Gap1p activity is repressed when a preferred nitrogen source is available, a phenomenon referred to as nitrogen catabolite repression (16Courchesne W.E. Magasanik B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 672-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Repression of Gap1p activity occurs at several levels by complex regulatory mechanisms (14Jauniaux J.C. Grenson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 17Stanbrough M. Magasanik B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 94-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hein C. Springael J.-Y. Volland C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Andre B. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In contrast, the activity of some, but not all, specific amino acid permeases is constitutive and not repressed by preferred nitrogen sources (19Sophianopoulou V. Diallinas G. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 16: 53-75Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that PHS blocks transport of tryptophan, leucine, histidine, and proline by their specific amino acid transporters. Inhibition of amino acid transport explains why PHS blocks growth of auxotrophic S. cerevisiae strains and why prototrophic strains are resistant to the drug.

Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and pB180, a plasmid having the GCN4 promoter fused to lacZ (23Mueller P.P. Hinnebusch A.G.

Saturated cultures were diluted, grown overnight with shaking at 30 °C to an A600 nm of 0.1–0.15, treated with the compounds indicated in Table II for 5 h, and harvested, and cell-free extracts were assayed for β-galactosidase activity (24Rose M.

Cells were grown at 27 °C in PYED medium to anA600 of 0.2, washed, and resuspended at anA600 of 0.7 for transport measurements. Cells were incubated 10 min with or without 100 μm PHS at 30 °C, and then uptake was initiated at time zero by addition ofl-[5-3H]tryptophan (20–30 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) to a final concentration of 7–9 μm or 70–90 μm. Samples were filtered (0.25 μm pore size, 25 mm diameter filters; Nucleopore, Pleasanton, CA), air-dried, and analyzed in a liquid scintillation counter. Data are expressed as the percent of radioactivity retained on the filter. Yeast were transformed using a LiOAc procedure (25Gietz R.D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 8: 1425Crossref Scopus (2903) Google Scholar). Standard yeast genetic techniques were used (26Sherman F. Hicks J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 21-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured using the Bio-Rad Bradford reagent with bovine serum albumin as the protein standard. An initial screening of S. cerevisiae strains for inhibition of growth by PHS revealed differences in sensitivity. Strains such as YPH250 were inhibited (PHS-sensitive, PHSS), whereas other strains such as SJ19 were not (PHS-resistant, PHSR). Segregation analysis demonstrated a genetic basis for this difference in sensitivity; five four-spored tetrads gave 2:2 segregation for the PHSS:PHSR phenotypes, showing that the phenotypes are due to a single, nuclear gene. Since the PHSR and Trp+ phenotypes co-segregated, the gene responsible for the PHSR phenotype must beTRP1 or a closely linked gene. The PHSRphenotype was dominant to the PHSS phenotype. TRP1 is most likely the gene responsible for the PHSRphenotype because transformation of strain YPH250 with the centromeric plasmid pRS314 (TRP1) gave PHSR cells. Since pRS314 carries a portion of the GAL3 gene that is linked toTRP1, we verified that cells transformed with a plasmid carrying GAL3 remained sensitive to PHS. We conclude from these data that tryptophan auxotrophs (Trp−) of S. cerevisiae are more sensitive to growth inhibition by PHS than are tryptophan prototrophs (Trp+). To quantify the difference in PHS sensitivity between Trp+and Trp− cells and to determine if sensitivity was due to other nutrient requirements, we compared the PHS sensitivity of prototrophic cells (strain YPH-A, YPH252 with all of its nutrient requirements complemented by plasmid-borne genes) to isogenic cells that required only His, Leu, Trp or Ura and Ade (YPH250 transformed with various combinations of plasmids, see Table I). Growth of prototrophic YPH-A cells was only partially inhibited at the highest PHS concentration (PHS is insoluble at higher concentrations), and we estimate, from the apparent midpoint of the inhibition curves, that these cells are at least 10-fold more resistant to PHS inhibition than are the Trp−cells (Fig. 1). His−, Leu−, and Ura− Ade− cells are as resistant to growth inhibition by PHS as are prototrophic cells (Fig. 1). Similar trends were seen when erythro-dihydrosphingosine or threo-dihydrosphingosine were used in place of PHS (data not shown). Growth inhibition was not observed with the water-soluble ceramide mimic C2-ceramide (N-acetylsphingosine, up to 50 μm), as has been reported by some investigators (27Fishbein J.D. Dobrowsky R.T. Bielawska A. Garrett S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9255-9261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Nickels J.T. Broach J.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 382-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) but not by others (13Ella K.M. Qi C. Dolan J.W. Thompson R.P. Meier K.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 340: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We conclude from the data presented in this section that PHS and dihydrosphingosine inhibit growth of YPH252 cells grown in complex medium (PYED) by blocking tryptophan utilization. Growth inhibition by PHS is most likely due to inhibition of tryptophan transport into cells and consequent starvation for this amino acid. This hypothesis predicts that growth inhibition by PHS should be alleviated by increasing the concentration of tryptophan in the culture medium. This prediction was verified (Fig. 2). Another prediction of this hypothesis is that overexpression of tryptophan transporters should increase resistance to PHS. The Tat2 protein is known to be a high affinity tryptophan transporter, whereas the Tat1 protein is a low affinity tryptophan transporter (29Schmidt A. Hall M.N. Koller A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6597-6606Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). YPH252 cells transformed with a multicopy vector carrying TAT2 were found to be more resistant to PHS growth inhibition than were cells transformed with the vector alone, whereas cells transformed with a multicopy vector carrying TAT1 showed PHS resistance between that conferred by multiple copies of TAT2 and that conferred by the vector alone (Fig. 3 A). These data support the hypothesis that PHS inhibits tryptophan transport. To determine if PHS was inhibiting growth and tryptophan utilization in a biospecific manner, we compared the effect of PHS with stearylamine, a long chain amine, and sphingosine, the long chain base found in mammals. Sphingosine was a more potent growth inhibitor (Fig. 3 C) than PHS (Fig. 3 A) which in turn was more potent than stearylamine (Fig. 3 B). However, the most significant difference between these three cationic lipids was their response to multiple copies of TAT1 or TAT2. Resistance to stearylamine (Fig. 3 B) or sphingosine (Fig. 3 C) was only increased 2–3-fold by multiple copies of either gene. In contrast, TAT2 increased resistance to PHS more than 50-fold, whereas TAT1 increased resistance at least 10-fold (Fig. 3 A). The ability of multiple copiesTAT1 or TAT2 to protect cells against growth inhibition by PHS, but not against inhibition by stearylamine or sphingosine, shows that PHS specifically interferes with tryptophan utilization whereas the other two cationic lipids do not. They must interfere with some other cellular process. To determine directly if PHS inhibits tryptophan accumulation, the rate of uptake of radioactive tryptophan by wild type and mutant strains defective intat1, tat2, or both genes was determined at low (7–9 μm Trp) and high (70–90 μm Trp) tryptophan concentrations in the presence or absence of PHS. Tryptophan accumulation was inhibited 60–70% at a low tryptophan concentration and about 50% at a high concentration in the presence of 100 μm PHS (Fig. 4 A). Tryptophan uptake by the Tat2 transporter was inhibited 60–70% in the presence of 100 μm PHS at both low and high tryptophan levels (Fig. 4 B). Uptake was primarily due to the Tat2 protein (Fig. 4 B), since tat2 mutant cells accumulated only a small amount of tryptophan (Fig. 4 C). However, some uptake was mediated by the Tat1 protein because the tat1 tat2 double mutant cells showed almost no accumulation compared with the tat2 mutant cells (Fig. 4 C), as reported previously (29Schmidt A. Hall M.N. Koller A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6597-6606Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We conclude from these data that PHS inhibits tryptophan accumulation and that accumulation is mediated primarily by the Tat2 transporter under the conditions of these experiments (cells pregrown in complex medium). Nutrient transport, particularly amino acid transport, across the plasma membrane is known to be affected by the nitrogen source present in the culture medium (19Sophianopoulou V. Diallinas G. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 16: 53-75Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In complex culture medium like the PYED medium used here, amino acids serve in part as a source of nitrogen because other nitrogen sources are limiting. Under these circumstances amino acid transport is mediated by both specific amino acid permeases, such as Tat2p, and also by the general amino acid permease (Gap1p). Thus, it is possible that PHS may be inhibiting other specific amino acid transporters but inhibition would not be seen because the amino acid would be transported also by Gap1p and its transport would not become limiting for growth. In addition, the concentration of amino acids in PYED medium is not defined and the concentration might be high enough to overcome the growth inhibiting affect of PHS. The effect of the nitrogen source on PHS sensitivity was examined first using defined medium (SD) containing ammonium ions as the nitrogen source. In this growth medium, amino acid uptake is thought to occur through specific transporters and not through Gap1p whose synthesis is repressed by ammonium ions (16Courchesne W.E. Magasanik B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 672-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Growth of prototrophic YPH-A cells is barely inhibited under these conditions of nitrogen catabolite repression (Fig. 5 A), even at the highest possible PHS concentration, unlike the case in PYED medium (nitrogen depressing conditions) where some inhibition of growth is seen at high PHS concentrations (Fig. 1). These data further support the hypothesis that PHS inhibits growth by blocking the activity of specific amino acid transporters. Transport of specific nutrients into YPH252 cells was examined by using cells transformed with plasmids so that only one or two nutrients were required. Cells requiring leucine are growth-inhibited by PHS just like the control YPH252 cells that have multiple growth requirements. Thus, the leucine-specific transporters are inhibited by PHS (Fig. 5 A). In contrast to the results found using PYED medium (nitrogen-derepressing conditions, Fig. 1), cells requiring tryptophan are only slightly inhibited for growth at the highest concentration of PHS when grown in defined medium containing ammonium ions (nitrogen-repressing conditions, Fig. 5 A). PHS did not inhibit under these conditions because the high concentration (98 μm, 20 μg/ml) of tryptophan in the medium partly overcomes the inhibitory effect of PHS (the concentration of tryptophan in PYED medium is unknown because it is partially destroyed during autoclaving). Cells requiring histidine are slightly more sensitive to growth inhibition by PHS than are prototrophic cells, indicating some inhibition of histidine transport. Cells requiring uracil plus adenine are as resistant to PHS inhibition as the control prototrophic strain YPH-A (Fig. 5 A). Therefore, transport of neither nutrient is inhibited by PHS. The PHS sensitivity of cells was examined next under nitrogen-derepressing conditions by using defined medium having proline as the sole nitrogen source. Under these conditions, proline is transported by the ammonia-repressible proline permease (Put4; Ref.30Jauniaux J.-C. Vandenbol M. Vissers S. Broman K. Grenson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 601-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), whereas other amino acids are transported by the Gap1p ammonia-repressible permease, which has a much higher transport capacity than the constitutively expressed specific amino acid permeases (31Horak J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 864: 223-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). If PHS inhibits Gap1p permease activity, stronger growth inhibition should be seen in medium containing proline than in medium containing ammonium ions. This prediction was verified for auxotrophic strains requiring one amino acid: His, Trp, or Leu (compare Fig. 5 A (ammonia) with Fig. 5 B (proline)). The inhibitory effect for each nutrient is nearly additive because the multiple auxotrophic strain YPH252 is more strongly inhibited than are the single-amino acid-requiring strains (Fig. 5 B). Growth of prototrophic YPH-A and YPH-E cells requiring uracil and adenine was slightly more inhibited by high concentrations of PHS when proline (Fig. 5 B) rather than ammonium ions were the nitrogen source (Fig. 5 A). The most likely reason for this difference is that PHS inhibits Put4 transport activity in the proline-containing, non-nitrogen-repressing growth condition, thus limiting nitrogen availability and reducing the growth yield. To determine if PHS treatment kills cells, viability was measured by determining colony formation. YPH252 cells transformed with YEp434 and grown in defined medium lacking leucine were about 80% viable after 6 h of treatment with 50 μm PHS and 40% viable after 48 h of treatment, showing that PHS does not rapidly kill cells. Starvation of yeast cells for amino acids induces a signaling pathway, the general control response, which increases translation of GCN4 mRNA. The resulting Gcn4 protein activates transcription of genes encoding the biosynthetic enzymes necessary for synthesis of many amino acids (32Hinnebusch A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 409-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). If PHS is inhibiting amino acid uptake, then PHS treatment should induce the general control response. Induction of the general control response was quantified by measuring β-galactosidase activity in YPH252 cells transformed with a reporter plasmid containing the GCN4 promoter fused to the lacZ gene (plasmid pB180; Ref. 23Mueller P.P. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1986; 45: 201-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). PHS treatment caused a 2.2-fold increase in β-galactosidase activity relative to untreated cells, and this increase is about the same as the 2.3-fold increase seen in cells treated with 3-amino triazole (Table II), an agent known to induce the general control response (23Mueller P.P. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1986; 45: 201-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). In control experiments, used to normalize β-galactosidase values (Table II) as described previously (21Heitman J. Koller A. Kunz J. Henriquez R. Schmidt A. Movva N.R. Hall M.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5010-5019Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), PHS did not induce expression of a GCN4-lacZ reporter gene, carried on pB277 (23Mueller P.P. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1986; 45: 201-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), lacking the four open reading frames necessary for response to amino acid starvation. We conclude from these data that PHS treatment activates the general control response. These results further support the hypothesis that PHS blocks amino acid uptake. The studies reported here demonstrate that growth inhibition of S. cerevisiae cells by the sphingoid long chain base PHS is due to inhibition of amino acid transporters and subsequent starvation for amino acids. Most data are for tryptophan transport by the Tat2 transporter, other data show that PHS reduces uptake of leucine, histidine, and proline. No interference with uracil or adenine uptake was observed. Inhibition of tryptophan uptake by PHS was initially indicated by segregation analysis, which revealed that the sensitive/resistance phenotype was due to a single, nuclear gene and that the resistance phenotype was tightly linked to the TRP1 locus. Because Trp+ cells such as SJ19, YPH-A (Fig. 1) or YPH250 transformed with a plasmid (pRS314) carrying the TRP1 gene were resistant, whereas Trp− cells such as YPH-D (Fig. 1) were sensitive to growth inhibition by PHS, we hypothesized that tryptophan uptake was impaired by PHS. Several types of data support this hypothesis. First, increasing concentrations of tryptophan in the culture medium reduce growth inhibition of the Trp− strain YPH-D by PHS (Fig. 2). Second, growth inhibition by PHS is greatly reduced by multiple copies of TAT2, encoding a high affinity tryptophan transporter, and to a lesser extent by multiple copies of the TAT1, encoding the low affinity tryptophan transporter (Fig. 3 A). Third, PHS treatment diminishes the rate of tryptophan uptake. In PYED medium, most of this uptake is mediated by the Tat2 transporter (Fig. 4). Finally, the general control response is induced by PHS treatment (Table II), indicating that cells are being starved for one or more amino acids. How might PHS affect Tat2 transport activity? Our data are not consistent with PHS directly inhibiting activity because the rate of tryptophan transport is normal for about 10 min and then it tapers off (Fig. 4). These kinetics are consistent with PHS activating a signal transduction pathway that down-regulates Tat2 activity. PHS is not disrupting the proton gradient necessary for tryptophan transport, because transport of other nutrients, such as uracil, adenine, and vitamins that require a proton gradient, is not blocked. The Tat2 protein is a member of the major facilitator superfamily (33Marger M.D. Saier M.H.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 13-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar) whose members contain 12 membrane-spanning α-helices, a hydrophilic N and C terminus, and 500–600 amino acids. These proteins lack the nucleotide-binding domain typical of ABC transporters and the conserved amino acids characteristic of the catalytic site in P-type ATPases. InS. cerevisiae, the Tat2, Gap1p, Tat1, and other amino acid transporters belong to a family of closely related proteins that is distinct from the uracil/allantoin transporters and from the purine transporter (19Sophianopoulou V. Diallinas G. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 16: 53-75Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Andre B. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1575-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 35Nelissen B. Mordant P. Jonniaux J.-L. De Wachter R. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). PHS did not inhibit uracil or adenine transport under nitrogen-repressing (ammonia ions in the culture medium), partially nitrogen-repressing (PYED medium), or nitrogen-derepressing (proline in the culture medium) conditions (Figs.1 and 5), indicating that PHS does not affect these two families of major facilitator superfamily of membrane-bound transporters. Under nitrogen-repressing conditions, PHS strongly inhibited growth of Leu− cells and slightly inhibited growth of His− cells, indicating that uptake of these two amino acids is diminished by PHS (Fig. 5 A). PHS may also inhibit transport of proline by the Put4 protein since growth of prototrophic YPH-A cells was more sensitive to PHS under conditions where proline was the nitrogen source (Fig. 5 B) than it was when ammonium ions were the nitrogen source (Fig. 5 A). These results, along with the phylogenetic relationship of the amino acid transporters, predict that the activity of most or perhaps all amino acid transporters in S. cerevisiae is inhibited by PHS. Long chain bases have numerous effects on mammalian cells (reviewed in Refs. 4Merrill A.H.J. Liotta D.C. Riley R.E. Bell R.M. Lipid Second Messengers. 8. Plenum Press, New York1996: 205-237Google Scholar and 5Spiegel S. Merrill Jr., A.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1388-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar), and many of these are probably specific for differentiated cells and, therefore, have no counterpart in S. cerevisiae cells. Growth inhibition (not cell death) by PHS was the end point in our experiments, and this effect has been seen with mammalian cells but the underlying mechanism(s) is unknown (reviewed in Ref. 4Merrill A.H.J. Liotta D.C. Riley R.E. Bell R.M. Lipid Second Messengers. 8. Plenum Press, New York1996: 205-237Google Scholar). Based upon our data, long chain bases may inhibit mammalian cell growth by blocking uptake of an essential nutrient, perhaps one transported by a membrane-bound protein."

Acta. 1995; 1266: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This cascade is initiated by the ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the IFNγ receptor, Jak1, Jak2, and STAT1α (3Igarashi K. Garotta G. Ozmen L. Ziemiecki A. Wilks A.F. Harpur A.G. Larner A.C. Finbloom D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14333-14336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1α homodimerizes, translocates to the nucleus, and binds enhancers located in the promoters of IFNγ-sensitive early response genes. In addition to the tyrosine phosphorylation of components of this pathway, data suggest that serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) phosphorylation also plays a role in transcriptional regulation of these genes (4Zhang X. Blenis J. Li H.-C. Schindler C. Chen-Kiang S. Science. 1995; 267: 1990-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 5Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E.

Science. 1995; 269: 1721-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Evidence for the role of Ser/Thr kinases in interferonγ-induced responses derive from studies showing a slow (60–120 min) activation of both MAP kinase (MAPK) and protein kinase C (7Liu M.K. Brouwnsey R.W. Reiner N.E. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 2722-2731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), differential modulation of the expression of early response genes by Ser/Thr phosphatase inhibitors (8Luong H. Winestock K.D. Finbloom D.S. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 799-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and a novel Ser/Thr kinase that mediates some of the antiproliferative effects of IFNγ (9Deiss L.P. Feinstein E. Berissi H. Cohen O. Kimchi A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Therefore, both tyrosine and Ser/Thr kinase activity can regulate IFNγ-induced expression of cellular genes. IFNγ primarily activates STAT1 as the main driving force for gene expression. Although it has been suggested that MAPK activation may drive serine phosphorylation of STAT1, the relationship, if any, between activation of Jaks and MAPK is undefined. MAPK activation occurs as a result of activation of both MEK, a dual specific kinase, and Raf-1, a Ser/Thr kinase. Moreover, tyrosine phosphorylation of Raf-1 appears to modulate enzymatic activity and subcellular localization (10Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas activation of Raf-1 by many growth factors and cytokines is p21ras-dependent, evidence exists that Raf-1 activity can also be stimulated independent of its interaction with p21ras (11Buscher D. Hipskind R.A. Krautwald S. Reimann T. Baccarini M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). To explore the potential relationship between those two signal transduction cascades, we used cell lines that lack Jak1 activity. We go on to show that Jak1 is required for Raf-1 activation and that this activity occurs independent of p21ras. The parental HeLa and E1C3 Jak1-deficient cell lines have been described (12Loh J.E. Schindler C. Ziemiecki A. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F. Flavell R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2170-2179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as have the parental 2fTGH human fibrosarcoma cell line and the Jak1-deficient U4A cell line (13Muller M. Brisco J. Laxton C. Guschin D.

The Jak1-deficient cells do not support IFNα or IFNγ-induced gene expression. Cells were maintained as adherent cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). For the MAPK, Raf-1, and p21ras assays, cells were placed in 1% fetal bovine serum 48 h before the experiment. For the 24–36 h immediately before cytokine treatment, the cells were cultured in serum-free media. After treatment with IFNγ, cells were solubilized with cold whole cell extraction buffer (1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, 300 mm NaCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm vanadate, and 20% glycerol).

The sample was then applied to a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel to separate free probe from probe bound to protein. rIFNγ was radiolabeled to high specific activity using Bolton-Hunter reagent as described (16Finbloom D.S. Hoover D.L. Wahl L.M. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 300-305PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with the radiolabeled IFNγ for 2 h at 4 °C and assayed as described previously (16Finbloom D.S. Hoover D.L. Wahl L.M. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 300-305PubMed Google Scholar). RNA was isolated by the RNAzol method as per the manufacturer's instructions. cDNAs were prepared from the RNA by reverse transcriptase, and then the amount of DNA encoding for the α and β chain of the IFNγ receptor was determined by PCR using primers specific for each gene as described previously (17Sakatsume M. Finbloom D.S. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4160-4166PubMed Google Scholar). The reverse transcription and PCR were performed with the GeneAmp RNA polymerase chain reaction kit (Perkin-Elmer) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The reaction was performed in a DNA thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer) for 30–35 cycles: 1 min of denaturation at 95 °C and 1 min of annealing and extension at 60 °C following 2 min of an initial denaturation step at 95 °C. The primers used for the detection of IFNγRβ are as follows: IFNγRα (5′ sense, 5′-GCAGAAGGAGTCTTACATGTGTGG-3′; 3′ antisense, 5′-CTCTCTATTGGAGTCAGATGGCTG-3′) and IFNγRβ (5′ sense, 5′-AATGTGACTGTCGGGCCTCCAGAA-3′; 3′ antisense, 5′-CTCTAAGATGGGCTGAGTTGGGTC-3′). An aliquot (10 μl) of amplified products was applied to a 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and stained by ethidium bromide. To ensure whether polymerase chain reaction bands were specific for IFNγR, we performed southern hybridization with specific cDNAs for IFNγRα and β. MAPK assays were performed as described using an anti-Erk2 antibody (TR10) (kindly provided by Dr. Michael Weber, University of Virginia) (6David M. Petricoin E. Benjamin C. Pine R. Weber M.J. Larner A.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1721-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Nontransfected cells were maintained in serum-free conditions for 24–36 h before the initiation of the assay. This was required for an optimal decrease in basal Raf-1 kinase activity. For cells that underwent transfection with Jak1 constructs, the time of starvation was limited to only 2 h, since optimal Jak1 expression occurred at about 14 h after transfection. Cells were then solubilized in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1% Triton-X, 0.5% octylglucoside, 0.03% deoxycholate, 0.02% SDS, protease inhibitors, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol), and the assay was carried out as described (18Catling A.D. Reuter C.W.M. Cox M.E. Parsons S.J. Weber M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30014-30021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lysate was incubated on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was incubated with anti-Raf-1 antibody (polyclonal; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by incubation with protein G-Sepharose at 4 °C for 1 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer, and the kinase reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 10 min in kinase buffer (0.2 mmATP, 30 mm MgCl2, 2 mmMnCl2, 40 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 μm okadaic acid, and 0.2% β-mercaptoethanol) with 1 μg of purified recombinant MEK1 added as substrate. When the assay was carried out without the addition of MEK1, there was no measurable increase in MAPK phosphorylation. After MEK1 activation, 15 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 1 μg of kinase-defective (K52R) Erk was added as substrate for an additional 2 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of sample buffer and boiled for 5 min, and the proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane on which the amount of radiolabeled K52R Erk was quantitated by a PhosphorImager. The amount of Raf-1 protein on the same membrane was determined by probing the membrane with mouse monoclonal anti-Raf-1 followed by125I-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG. Data are presented as -fold increase, as explained for the MAPK assay. In 2fTGH and U4A cells, a myc epitope-tagged Raf-1 (R89LRaf-1), mutated in the p21ras binding site and containing a p21ras membrane localization motif (CAAX), was used in a p21ras-independent Raf-1 assay (10Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with R89LRaf-1 plasmid using DEAE dextran. Forty-eight h post-transfection, lysates were prepared from either untreated cells or cells incubated for 5 min with IFNγ. Cell extracts were prepared and incubated with monoclonal antibody 9E10, which recognizes the myc epitope tag (GGEQKLISEEDL). Immunoprecipitates were assayed for Raf-1 kinase activity as described above. The activation state of p21ras was performed as described elsewhere (19Farnsworth C.L. Marshall M.S. Gibbs J.B. Stacey D.W. Feig L.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 625-633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 20McCollam L. Bonfini L. Karlovich C.A. Conway B.R. Kozma L.M. Banerjee U. Czech M.P. J. Biol.

The cells were then treated with IFNγ or EGF for 15 min at 37 °C and lysed in 0.8 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm vanadate, and 1:10 dilution of culture supernatant of hybridoma-producing anti-Ras monoclonal antibody (Y13–259). After centrifugation at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, 0.2 ml of detergent mixture (0.5% deoxycholate, 0.5% SDS, 0.5 m NaCl) and 20 μl of Protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) were added. The samples were incubated by rocking for 2 h at 4 °C and then washed extensively with wash buffer (50 mm Hepes, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.05% SDS). The immunoprecipitates were eluted by heating at 85 °C for 3 min in the elution buffer (0.075 m KH2PO4, pH 3.4, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm GTP, and 0.5 mm GDP). After a brief centrifugation, 8 μl of supernatant was spotted onto a polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer chromatography plate. After drying, the plates was washed briefly in water and air dried before developing in 0.65 mKH2PO4, pH 3.4, for 75 min. Radioactivity was visualized by autoradiography and quantitated by PhosphorImager. The full-length cytomegalovirus-driven wild type murine Jak1 cDNA (pRK5mJak1wt) and the kinase-negative form (ATP binding site K → E; pRK5mJak1kd) were constructed as described (21Silvennoinen O. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Cleveland J.L. Yi T. Ihle J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8429-8433Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Cytomegalovirus-driven pβ-galactosidase was used as a control. Transfection of cDNAs was performed by electroporation of cells (1 × 107cells/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline (300 V/cm, 800 microfarads; Cell-Porator; Life Technologies). Immunoblotting for detection of expressed Jak1 showed that 9–14 h of incubation after electroporation gave maximal expression of Jak1 protein. Cytomegalovirus-driven interleukin 2 receptor (Tac) plasmid (provided by Dr. Bruce Howard, NIH, Bethesda, MD) was cotransfected with pRK5mJak1wt, pRK5mJak1kd, or pβ-galactosidase into the Jak1-negative mutant HeLa cells (E1C3) by electroporation. After 14 h of incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, cells were incubated with magnetic beads (DynaBeads) conjugated with anti-Tac monoclonal antibody (provided by Dr. T. Waldmann, NIH, Bethesda) in medium S (phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 4 mm EGTA, 100 μg/ml chondroitin sulfate, 10 mm Hepes, 0.5 mMgCl2, 0.5 m MgSO4, 8 mg/ml nonfat dry milk, and 8 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 15 min at 37 °C. After incubation, the mixture of cells and beads was treated with 0.25% trypsin, 0.5 mm EDTA for 2 min followed by the addition of trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). Tac-positive cells that bound to magnetic beads were separated from Tac-negative cells by magnetic field. This separation procedure was repeated three times. Selected Tac-positive cells were washed extensively by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and used for further experiments. 1D4 cells were solubilized as described above for the Raf-1 assay, and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against p21ras (Quality Biotech Inc., Camden, NJ) (22Popik W. Pitha P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6532-6541Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were then analyzed for Raf-1 activity and were expressed as -fold increase for each experiment, where original data represent fluorescent readings from a PhosphorImager. Each experiment was done three or four times independently, and data presented are the mean ± S.E. normalized to the intra-experimental control (**, p < 0.01; *, p < 0.05), except for Fig. 7 in which data of different treatment groups were pooled. Statistical significance was calculated by paired or unpaired t test. Jak1 is required for IFNγ activation in E1C3 cells (12Loh J.E. Schindler C. Ziemiecki A. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F. Flavell R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2170-2179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A) as measured by the inability of IFNγ to activate STAT1-dependent DNA binding to a GAS-like element referred to as the GRR, which is located in the promoter of the high affinity Fcγ receptor I gene (15Pearse R.N. Feinman R. Ravetch J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11305-11309Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A, lanes 6–10). In contrast, parental HeLa cells (1D4) respond to IFNγ by a rapid and intense activation of DNA binding activity (Fig. 1, lanes 1–5). Since the lack of Tyk2 was shown to affect binding of IFNα to its receptor (23Pelligrini S. Schindler C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 338-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), we measured the ability of radiolabeled IFNγ to bind to its receptor on the parental and E1C3 HeLa cells. The binding of125I-rIFNγ was similar in both the parental and Jak1-deficient cell lines (Fig. 1 B). Both the maximal number of receptors (approximately 1,400/cell) and the concentration at half-saturation (2 × 10−10m) were identical and consistent with the absence of any alteration in the affinity of IFNγ for the mutant cells. Since binding of IFNγ measures essentially only the interaction between the ligand and the α chain of the IFNγ receptor, intact binding parameters may exist, yet there may be no β chain present and thereby no signaling through the receptor (24Sakatsume M. Igarashi K. Winestock K.D. Garotta G. Larner A.C. Finbloom D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17528-17534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Moreover, the presence or absence of the β chain has not been demonstrated in the E1C3 cells. To assure that there was equal expression of both the α and β chain of the IFNγ receptor, we performed reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction amplification of RNA from both cell types. Both the parental and Jak1-deficient cells expressed α and β chain genes (Fig. 1 C). Therefore, the lack of signal transduction through the IFNγ receptor in the Jak1-deficient cells was not the result of alterations in the receptor (17Sakatsume M. Finbloom D.S. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4160-4166PubMed Google Scholar). Increased enzymatic activity of Raf-1 is the primary stimulus for MEK activation, which is responsible for the phosphorylation of MAPK. Although HeLa cells demonstrated MAPK activation in response to IFNγ, no MAPK activation was measurable in the E1C3 cells lacking Jak1 (data not shown). We therefore evaluated whether IFNγ could enhance Raf-1 activity and whether this was Jak1-dependent. Cells were incubated with IFNγ and solubilized, and the extracts were incubated with anti-Raf-1 antibodies. The amount of Raf-1 in both the 1D4 and E1C3 cells were comparable, as determined by immunoblotting of cell extracts (data not shown). The Raf-1 immunoprecipitates were analyzed for enzymatic activity by incubating in the presence of ATP and purified recombinant MEK1, yielding an activated MEK1. [32P-γ]ATP was then added in the presence of an enzymatically inactive form of Erk2 (p42MAPK). The assay measures the ability of Erk2 to be phosphorylated by MEK1. In parental cells, there was a marked increase in the phosphorylation of Erk by Raf-1 in response to IFNγ (Fig. 2, A, 1D4, and B, lanes 1–3). Raf-1 kinase activity was maximal (greater than 3-fold enhancement) after 5 min and then decreased to base-line levels after 15 min (Fig. 2 A, 1D4). Base-line Raf-1 activity was similar in both cells lines, as determined by the extent of basal phosphorylation of Erk (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1 and 4). In the Jak1-deficient cells (E1C3), there was no induction of Raf-1 activity (Fig. 2 A). An increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of Raf-1 occurred in response to IFNγ (Fig. 2 C, lanes 1–3) only in the parental cells. Maximal tyrosine phosphorylation of Raf-1 occurred after 15 min, although detectable increases in phosphorylation were evident after 5 min. In contrast, there was no increase in Raf-1 phosphorylation in response to IFNγ in the Jak1-deficient cell line (Fig. 2 C, lanes 4–6). There was equal loading of Raf-1 protein in all lanes (Fig. 2 C, anti-Raf-1 immunoblot, lanes 1–6) for both cells, 1D4 and E1C3. When E1C3 cells were treated with EGF, there was a 6.0-fold enhancement of Raf-1 activity (Table I). We also examined Raf-1 activation in the 2fTGH cell line, which is the parental cell line for the U4A cells that lack Jak1. Since the 2fTGH cells express a constitutively activated p21ras, they were transfected with a myc epitope-tagged Raf-1, which contains a mutation in the p21ras binding domain (R89LRaf-1) (10Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IFNγ enhancement in kinase activity of this Raf-1 should be independent of endogenous p21ras. In the parental cells (2fTGH) IFNγ treatment resulted in a 2.1 ± 0.42 (mean ± S.D., n = 2)-fold increase in Raf-1 activity, as determined by measuring activation of R89L-Raf-1 (see “Experimental Procedures”), whereas there was no increased activity in the U4A cells (0.45 ± 0.7, mean ± S.D., n = 2).Table IReconstitution of Raf-1 activation in Jak1-deficient cells with wild type Jak1Cells (treatment)No. of experiments-fold increase over unstimulated cellsE1C3 (no treatment)41.0 E1C3 (IFNγ)41.5 ± 0.2° (mean ± S.E.)

Open table in a new tab Reconstitution of IFNγ-induced Raf-1 activity was carried out in both the E1C3 cells that were transfected with Jak1 along with Tac and T Ag as a cell selection system and the U4A cell lines, which were transfected with both Jak1 and myc epitope-tagged Raf-1. There was a 1.5-fold increase in Raf-1 activity in E1C3 extracts that were prepared from IFNγ-treated cells transfected with kinase-active Jak1 that was statistically significant (p < 0.05, pairedt test) when compared with control cells transfected with Tac and T Ag alone (Table I). EGF treatment of cells, which was used as a control for the assay, revealed a 6.0 ± 1.7-fold increase in Raf-1 activation. The amount of transfected Jak1 in the E1C3 cells compared with endogenous Jak1 in the parental cells is shown in Fig. 3. There is less Jak1 available in the E1C3 cells compared with the 1D4 wild type cells (Fig. 3, upper panel, lane 1 versus lane 3). This may account for the relatively modest IFNγ activation of Raf-1 in these transfected cells. To reconfirm the ability of Jak1 to facilitate the activation of Raf-1 in E1C3 cells, we examined the ability of U4A cells (see above) to respond to stimulation with IFNγ upon reconstitution. Reconstitution of R89L Raf-1 activity in response to IFNγ occurred following transfection with the wild type Jak1 to levels observed in the parental cell line (Table I). Both the wild type 2fTGH and the transfected U4A cells responded to IFNγ with an approximately 2-fold increase in Raf-1 activity. Therefore, two separate cell lines deficient in Jak1 responded to reconstitution with Jak1 for IFNγ-induced activation of Raf-1. Since one of the major mechanisms for the activation of Raf-1 is through p21ras, we measured the ability of IFNγ to activate p21ras as measured by the increase in p21ras-bound GTP. Cells were labeled with 32Pi and then treated for 15 min with IFNγ. Cell extracts were made, p21ras was immunoprecipitated, and the GTP loading of p21ras was measured by thin layer chromatography. Whereas there was no evidence for increased GTP-bound p21ras after treatment of cells with IFNγ, a marked increase occurred following treatment of cells with EGF (Fig. 4). There was no measurable increase in p21ras activation in cells incubated with IFNγ at other time points (2.5, 5, and 10 min, data not shown). Therefore, the activation of Raf-1 by IFNγ appears to occur at a time when there is no measurable activation of p21ras. Since it is known that GTP-bound p21ras binds Raf-1 (25Zhang X.F. Settleman J. Kyriakis J.M. Takeuchi-Suzuki E. Elledge S.J. Marshall M.S. Bruder J.T. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1993; 364: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar), we next examined Raf-1 activity bound to p21ras in HeLa cells treated with IFNγ or EGF. Treatment of HeLa cells with EGF resulted in a 6-fold increase in Raf-1 activity bound to immunoprecipitated p21ras (Table II). This enhancement was nearly identical to the 6.5-fold increase in EGF-stimulated GTP binding of p21ras (Fig. 4). Under the same conditions, the p21ras activity associated with p21ras in IFNγ-treated cells showed no or very little enhancement (Table II).Table IIRaf1 activation when coimmunoprecipitated with p21rasTreatment (No. of experiments)-fold increase over control (mean ± S.E.)Control (n = 4)1.00IFNγ (n = 2)1.24 ± 0.04EGF (n = 3)5.85 ± 1.39 Open table in a new tab To obtain more information regarding the ability of the Jak kinases to associate with and activate Raf-1, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments in HeLa cells and in COS cells transfected with either wild type or kinase-inactive Jak1. There was constitutive association of Raf-1 with Jak1 in HeLa cells (Fig. 5 A, lanes 4–6). Previous studies have indicated that Jaks expressed in COS cells are constitutively activated and will tyrosine-phosphorylate STATs in the absence of IFNs. To determine the role of Jak1 stimulation on Raf-1 activity without ligand receptor interaction, COS cells were transfected with wild type or kinase-inactive Jak1. In COS cells transfected with wild type (wt) Jak1, activated Raf-1 enzyme activity measured approximately 2-fold (Fig. 5 B) over a β-galactosidase control transfection. In contrast, transfection with a kinase-inactive (kd) construct resulted in no enhancement of Raf-1 activity (Fig. 5 B). When Raf-1 was immunoprecipitated and the immunoblot membrane was probed for Jak1, both wild type and kinase-inactive Jak1 were observed to be associated with Raf-1 (Fig. 4 C, lanes 5 and 6). There was no association of Jak1 with Raf-1 when either the β-galactosidase cDNA was transfected (Fig. 5 C, lane 4) or when control normal rabbit IgG was used for the immunoprecipitations (Fig. 4 C, lanes 1–3). Only in cells transfected with kinase-active Jak1 was tyrosine-phosphorylated Jak1 associated with Raf-1 (Fig. 4 C, lower panel, lane 5 versus lane 6). This supports the contention that kinaseactive Jak1 must be present for Raf-1 to be activated as observed in Fig. 4 B. Activation of the Jak/STAT pathway by cytokines such as IFNγ allows not only for the induction of early response genes such asIRF1 and the high affinity Fcgr1, but also for genes that are delayed in their expression, such as human major histocompatibility class II antigens. A deficiency in any individual component of the pathway leads to disruption of the entire signaling cascade. On the other hand, under certain circumstances cytokine-induced proliferation and/or differentiation may require more than just activation of STAT proteins (26Quelle W.Q. Wang D. Nosaka T. Thierfelder W.E. Stravopodis D. Weinstein Y. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1622-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 27Fujii H. Nakagawa Y. Schindler U. Kawahara A. Mori H. Gouilleux P. Groner B. Ihle J.N. Minami Y. Miyazaki T. Taniquichi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5482-5486Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that other signaling pathways may operate in parallel or integral to the Jak/STAT pathway to enable full phenotypic responses of cells exposed to extracellular ligands. In this report, we explored the relationship between two pathways utilized by cytokines to activate cells: the Jak/STAT and the p21ras/Raf-1/MEK/MAPK pathway. We show that treatment of cells with IFNγ leads to rapid activation of Raf-1 in a p21ras-independent manner. In cells lacking Jak1, no activation of Raf-1 occurs. Therefore, Jak1 appears to interact with this cascade at least at the level of Raf-1. Although previous reports have determined that IFNγ activates MAPK activity and in some systems protein kinase C activity (7Liu M.K. Brouwnsey R.W. Reiner N.E. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 2722-2731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), our data confirm and extend these observations by showing that IFNγ can directly activate Raf-1 that is dependent upon the presence of intact Jak1 activity but independent of p21ras activation. The lower activation of Raf-1 in the transfection experiments with the E1C3 cells may indeed be a function of the reduced ability to express Jak1 in these cells along with its increased lability. The need for Jak1 suggests that an association between Jak1 and Raf-1 may be necessary for activation of Raf-1. Since Jak2 is present in these cells and in U4A cells, Jak2 apparently cannot substitute for this function. This is in contrast to growth hormone signaling in embryonic kidney cells in which p21ras, Raf, and Jak2 (but not Jak1) are required for MAPK activation (28Winston L.A. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30837-30840Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The role, if any, tyrosine phosphorylation plays in the regulation of Raf-1 activity is incompletely understood. We have shown that IFNγ-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Raf-1 is maximal 15 min after treatment, whereas Raf-1 enzyme activity becomes maximal after 5 min and is substantially reduced by 15 min. Increased Raf-1 activity has been associated with or without tyrosine phosphorylation, depending upon the activating stimulus (29Burgering B.M.T. Bos J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 18-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation can be observed and is thought to be involved in either membrane targeting or release from receptors (30Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Escobedo J.A. Rapp U.R. Roberts T.M. Williams L.T. Cell. 1989; 58: 649-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 31Marais R. Light Y. Pateson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 32Turner B.C. Tonks N.K. Rapp U.R. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Furthermore, serine/threonine phosphorylation of Raf-1 plays both an activating role, as observed for ceramide-induced activation and phosphorylation on Thr-269 (34Yao B. Zhang Y. Delikat S. Mathias S. Basu S. Kolesnick R. Nature. 1995; 378: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), and an inhibitory role, as observed for protein kinase A-induced inhibition and phosphorylation on Ser-612 (35Mischak H. Seitz T. Janosch P. Eulitz M. Steen H. Schellerer M. Philipp A. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5409-5418Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Since we observe that both Jak1 and Raf-1 can be coimmunoprecipitated when Jak1 is overexpressed, this suggests a direct interaction between Jak1 and Raf-1, possibly at the level of the IFNγ receptor. Dimerization of Raf-1 through a receptor-independent or -dependent mechanism is sufficient for Raf activation (36Luo Z. Tzivion G. Belshaw P.J. Vavvas D. Marshall M. Avruch J. Nature. 1996; 383: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar,37Farrar M.A. Alberola-lla J. Perlmutter R.M. Nature. 1996; 383: 178-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that a pool of Raf-1 associates with Jak1 (and thereby the α chain of the IFNγ receptor), dimerizes upon binding of IFNγ (a bivalent homodimer), and becomes activated. However, this does not exclude the possibility that Jak1 may function through an intermediary kinase that may be responsible for the activation of Raf-1. Although it has been recently suggested that Jak2 can be coimmunoprecipitated with Raf-1 and p21ras, this was observed by overexpression in nonmammalian insect cells (38Xia K. Mukhopadhyay N.K. Inhorn R.C. Barber D.L. Rose P.E. Lee R.S. Narisimhan R.P. D'Andrea A.D. Griffin J.D. Roberts T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11681-11686Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, the authors also comment on their inability to show co- immunoprecipitation of Jak2 and Raf-1 in mammalian cells treated with IFNγ and fail to address the issue of p21ras-dependence of Raf-1 activation. The absence of p21ras activity for cytokine stimulation of Raf-1 has been well documented to occur for other cytokines (11Buscher D. Hipskind R.A. Krautwald S. Reimann T. Baccarini M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Although the use of dominant negative p21ras mutants can in some instances confirm this notion, transfections with these constructs have not yielded suitable results for a measurable dominant negative effect (data not shown). IFNγ-induced anti-viral activity requires the expression of Jak1 with intact kinase activity. No anti-viral activity is seen in the Jak1 kinase-inactive transfectants (39Briscoe J. Rogers N.C.

One interpretation of these findings is that Jak1 activity is required for the activation of other systems in addition to just STAT activation (which occurs in a delayed fashion in the kinase-inactive transfectants). Our data reveal that kinase-active Jak1 may be required to obtain full Raf-1 activation and that possibly Raf-1 activity may be required for optimal anti-viral effects of IFNγ. It is of interest that treatment with IFNγ does not result in the activation of p21ras, since activated p21ras is known to inhibit phosphokinase R activity, an enzyme critical for anti-viral activity (40Mundschau L.J. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3100-3106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). There have been several reports on the activation of protein kinase C, calcium fluxes, and Ser/Thr phosphorylation in mediating the effects of IFNγ on a variety of cell types (41Farrar M.A. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 571-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar). These pathways appear to control activation of genes such as the major histocompatability complex class II antigens, enhancement of antigen presenting activity, and fas gene activation, which potentially play a role in the ability of IFNγ to induce an anti-proliferative, differentiative, or apoptotic state. Cell specificity can also play a role in modulating IFNγ-induced gene expression. This was recently demonstrated by studying the effects of IFNγ on myocytes and microvascular endothelial cells (42Singh K. Balligand J.-L. Fischer T.A. Smith T.W. Kelly R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1111-1117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Although IFNγ can activate STAT1 in both cells, only in the myocytes is MAPK activity and inducible nitric oxide synthetase gene expression observed in response to IFNγ. The authors suggest that MAPK activation along with STAT1 activation was necessary for inducible nitric oxide synthetase gene expression in myocytes. Therefore, selective expression of IFNγ-induced genes depends upon the activation of specific signaling cascades whose modulation allows for multiple layers of control in mediating IFNγ-regulated responses.

https://openalex.org/W2032325397,"The mechanism of human plasminogen (HPlg) activation by streptokinase (SK)-type activator was investigated with recombinant truncated SK peptides. An enzyme-substrate intermediate of HPlg·SK·HPlg ternary complex was demonstrated by a sandwich-binding experiment. Formation of the ternary complex was saturable, HPlg-specific, and inhibited by 6-aminocaproic acid. Three interaction sites between SK and HPlg were demonstrated. SK-(220–414) bound to HPlg with two binding sites: one to the micro-HPlg region, the catalytic domain of HPlg, and one to the kringle 1–5 region, withKd values of 1.50 × 10−7 and 2.44 × 10−6m, respectively. SK-(16–251) bound to a single site on the kringle 1–5 region of HPlg with a Kd of 4.09 × 10−7m. SK-(220–414) and SK-(16–251) competed for binding on the same or nearby location on the human kringle 1–5 domain. Combination of SK-(220–414) and SK-(16–251), but not either peptide alone, could effectively activate HPlg. In addition, SK-(16–251) dose-dependently enhanced the activation of HPlg by SK-(16–414), while the HPlg activation by SK-(16–414) was inhibited by SK-(220–414). We conclude that the HPlg that binds to the COOH-terminal domains of SK functions as an enzyme to catalyze the conversion of substrate HPlg that binds to the NH2-terminal domain of SK to human plasmin.

Plm thus produced in the blood circulation in turn catalyzes the hydrolysis of fibrin and dissolution of blood clots. SK has been used for more than 20 years as a thrombolytic agent in the treatment of thromboembolic blockages in the blood vessels such as acute myocardial infarction, although the mechanism of its function as a Plg activator remains unclear. SK or HPlg alone does not have enzymatic activity. However, HPlg in interacting with SK becomes a virgin enzyme, which has amidolytic activity, although the activating peptide Arg560–Val561 remains intact (5McClintock D.K. Bell P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 43: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 6Reddy K.N.N. Markus G. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1683-1691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Reddy K.N.N.

Enzyme. 1988; 40: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), both of which can act as a Plg activator to catalyze the hydrolysis of the activating peptide bond of other Plgs (7Schick L.A.

Plgs from many different mammalian species have been tested for their sensitivity to activation by SK, but only those from human, monkey, and cat are found to be sensitive (15Summaria L. Arzadon L. Bernabe P. Robbins K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4760-4769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while those from cow, bovine, sheep, pig, mouse, and rat are not (3Wulf R.J. Mertz E.T. Can. J. Biochem. 1969; 47: 927-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The regions of amino acid sequences of Plgs that may account for the species specificity were determined with HPlg mutants (16Wang J. Brdar B. Reich E. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1758-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The detailed three-dimensional structure of SK or Plg·SK complex based on x-ray crystallography has not been solved. According to amino acid sequence alignment, two internal homologous domains, SK-(1–173) and SK-(254–415) were suggested (2Jackson K.W. Tang J. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6620-6625Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). NMR and CD spectroscopy studies suggest that SK consists of at least three to four independent domains linked by mobile segments of the protein chain (17Teuten A.J. Broadhurst R.W. Smith R.A.G. Dobson C.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 18Damaschun G. Damaschun H. Gast K. Gerlach D. Misselwitz R. Welfle H. Zirwer D. Eur. Biophys. J. 1992; 20: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Therefore, truncated SK proteins obviously would contain some intact structure of these domains. In the previous report, we demonstrated that most of the truncated SK peptides obtained by gene cloning techniques had secondary structures similar to those of the corresponding regions on native SK moieties, and they could be used to study the functions of the SK domains independently (19Young K.C. Shi G.Y. Chang Y.F. Chang B.I. Chang L.C. Lai M.D. Chuang W.J. Wu H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29601-29606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Based on the study, five functional regions (a, Ile1–Lys59; b, Ser60–Asn90; c, Val158–Arg219; d, Tyr252–Ala316; e, Ser317–Ala378) in the SK molecule for interaction with HPlg were deduced. From the results, we concluded that coordination of SK region Val158–Ala378 is essential for a virgin enzyme formation and that coordination of SK region Ser60–Ala378 is required for an effective SK-type HPlg activator. Additionally, the smaller SK fragments, SK-(16–251) and SK-(220–414), can bind to HPlg significantly, although they have neither virgin enzyme activity in a stoichiometric complex with HPlg nor HPlg activator activity. Multiple binding sites of HPlg and SK molecules have been proposed (20Summaria L. Boreisha I. Barlow G.H. Robbins K.C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1987; 58: 772-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 21Nihalani D. Sahni G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Nevertheless, how the separate HPlg-binding sites in the SK sequence interact with HPlg during HPlg activation remains a fundamental question to be resolved. In the present study, experiments were performed to elucidate the functions of NH2- and COOH-terminal SK binding regions. A more detailed mechanism of HPlg activation by SK was proposed. Enzymes used in DNA manipulation were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim, Bethesda Research, or Promega Laboratories and were used according to the Cold Spring Harbor Manual or the recommendations by the suppliers. The full-length SK gene was obtained from Streptococcus equisimilis H46A (ATCC 12449) by the amplification with polymerase chain reaction as previously reported (19Young K.C. Shi G.Y. Chang Y.F.

Lys-Sepharose, CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B, and DEAE-cellulose were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Soybean trypsin inhibitor and NH2-d-Val-Leu-Lys-p-nitroanilide (S-2251) were obtained from Sigma. Bis-(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate was purchased from Pierce; 6-aminocaproic acid (EACA) was from Merck. All chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available. HPlg and SK antiserum were prepared in our laboratory from mice. HPlg and BPlg were prepared from pooled human and bovine plasma as described (19Young K.C. Shi G.Y. Chang Y.F. Chang B.I. Chang L.C.

J. 1994; 304: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Forms 1 and 2 of native Plgs were separated by chromatography on a Lys-Sepharose column (25Deutsch D.G. Mertz E.T. Science. 1970; 170: 1095-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar, 26Brockway W.J. Castellino F.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 151: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Form 2 of Plgs was used throughout the experiment. Micro-HPlg and human kringle 1–5 were made by incubating HPlg with plasmin in an alkaline solution and purified by Lys-Sepharose and soybean-trypsin inhibitor-Sepharose 4B as described in previous reports (27Wu H.L.

Chem. 1988; 263: 17071-17075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SK peptides used in this study were obtained by recombinant gene cloning techniques as previously reported (19Young K.C. Shi G.Y. Chang Y.F. Chang B.I. Chang L.C. Lai M.D. Chuang W.J. Wu H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29601-29606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, the full-length SK gene was unidirectionally deleted by exonuclease III from the NH2 or COOH terminus. Then the fragments coding for the truncated peptides were subcloned in frame into the overproducing plasmid pET-3a or pET-3b or pET-3c (Novagen) at the BamHI site. Transformed bacteria cells, Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS, were grown to midlog phase, and target gene expression was induced by adding 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 3 h, the expressing cells were harvested, washed, and disintegrated. Then the target proteins were concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation and purified to homogeneity by anion exchange chromatography methods with a DEAE-cellulose column. The protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using the following ε1% 280 nm values and molecular weights, respectively: Plgs, 17.0 and 94,000; micro-HPlg, 16.0 and 28,617; human kringle 1–5, 17.0 and 55,000; SK-(16–414), 9.5 and 45,000; SK-(16–251), 9.5 and 26,000; SK-(16–191), 9.5 and 19,000; SK-(220–414), 9.5 and 23,000. The assay was designed to detect the formation of the Plg·SK·Plg complex. Wells of a radioimmunoassay strip plate (Costar) were coated with 0.2 ml of HPlg or BPlg at a concentration of 10 μg/ml in 0.05 m carbonate/bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6, for 36 h at 4 °C and blocked with 1% BSA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 h. Native SK (1 μm) was added to the wells as a bridge and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, the corresponding 125I-labeled Plgs, which were labeled by the IODO-GEN method as described previously (27Wu H.L. Chang B.I. Wu D.H. Chang L.C. Gong C.C. Lou K.L. Shi G.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19658-19664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), at various concentrations were added to each well and incubated for another 30 min at 4 °C. After washing with the same buffer, the radioactivity and the amount of 125I-Plg was determined with a LKB γ-counter. Nonspecific binding was determined by using BSA instead of SK protein. This was subtracted from the total binding to obtain the amount of specific binding. The binding of 125I-HPlg and SK 1:1 complex, preformed in solution, to the HPlg-precoated plate was also measured. To test the effect of EACA on the binding of SK and HPlg, EACA at a final concentration of 10 mm was added to125I-labeled HPlg, and experiments were performed with the same procedures. The amount of immobilized Plgs coating on the surface of each well and the amount of bound SK as a bridge were estimated by two separate groups of experiments. We used 125I-Plgs in place of unlabeled Plgs for a coating plate in one assay and125I-SK in place of the unlabeled SK as a bridge in the separate experiments. After conducting the same procedures as in the sandwich binding assay, we determined the radioactivities and the amounts of bound proteins. Wells of a radioimmunoassay strip plate were coated with HPlg and blocked with BSA as above described. 125I-SK peptides at various concentrations were added to the plate followed by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, the amount of 125I-SK peptide was determined by an LKB γ-counter. Nonspecific binding was measured by the addition of a 30-fold molar excess of each unlabeled peptide, and the value was subtracted from the total binding to obtain the amount of specific binding. The binding affinities of these 125I-SK peptides to HPlg were determined by Scatchard transformation. To determine the binding affinity of 125I-SK peptides to human kringle 1–5 or BPlg, the same concentration-dependent binding assay was performed by using human kringle 1–5 or BPlg instead of HPlg in the coating step. Competition between different HPlg moieties or different SK peptides for SK and HPlg binding was determined by adding excess unlabeled peptide fragments. To assay the competition between different Plg moieties, the amounts of125I-SK-(16–251) or 125I-SK-(220–414) binding to HPlg with excess unlabeled HPlg fragments as competitors were analyzed. Wells of a radioimmunoassay strip plate were coated with HPlg and blocked with BSA as described above. Unlabeled human kringle 1–5, micro-HPlg, or BSA at various concentrations were then added to the HPlg-precoated wells for 5 min at 4 °C. Subsequently,125I-SK-(16–251) or 125I-SK-(220–414) was added to the wells and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The binding procedures were performed as described above, and the amount of bound labeled SK-peptides was determined. The percentage of labeled SK peptide binding was determined by the fractional binding of the labeled SK peptides to HPlg in the presence of a given competitor in comparison with that occurring in the absence of any unlabeled competitor. To evaluate the competition between different SK peptides for binding to HPlg, the same binding procedure was carried out by adding the various unlabeled SK peptides as competitors prior to adding125I-SK-(16–251) or 125I-SK-(220–414). The binding percentages in the presence of competitors were also determined. Human kringle 1–5 and native SK at a concentration of 0.3 mg/ml were mixed at room temperature for 3 min and followed by reaction with 0.1 mm bis-(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate as cross-link reagent. After 60 min, the reaction was stopped by adding Tris buffer, pH 7.5, to a final concentration of 20 mm. Parallel samples containing either human kringle 1–5 or native SK were use as controls. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE in 10% acrylamide according to the method of Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). The electrophoresed proteins on the gel were transferred onto Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore Corp.), and Western blotting was carried out with HPlg or SK antiserum (31Burnette W.H. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5889) Google Scholar). A one-stage assay as described previously was used to measure HPlg activation by SK peptides (32Wohl R.C. Summaria L. Robbins K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2005-2013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Shi G.Y. Chang B.I. Wu D.H. Ha Y.M. Wu H.L. Thromb. Res. 1990; 58: 317-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). HPlg was activated by incubation with a catalytic amount of NH2-terminal SK peptide alone, COOH-terminal SK peptide alone, or combination of both SK peptides, at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.4, containing S-2251 as a substrate. The change in absorbance at 405 nm was monitored with a Hitachi 330 spectrophotometer. Competition assays were also performed to determine the effects of SK peptides on the activation of HPlg by SK-(16–414). HPlg was incubated with a catalytic amount of SK-(16–414) alone or in the presence of various concentrations of NH2- or COOH-terminal SK peptides at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.4, containing S-2251. The rate of HPlm production was monitored with a spectrophotometer. Sandwich binding assays were performed to study the formation of the HPlg·SK·HPlg complex. In this experiment, a microtiter plate was first coated with HPlg, and native SK was added to allow HPlg·SK complexes to develop. 125I-HPlg was then added to the HPlg·SK-coated plate. The amount of 125I-HPlg bound to the HPlg·SK-coated plate, which represented that of the HPlg·SK·HPlg complex, was determined by measuring the radioactivity. Fig. 1 shows the increasing formation of HPlg·SK·HPlg complex in a dose-dependent and saturable manner and shows that 4.69 ± 0.30 pmol of 125I-HPlg was bound in the saturated condition. No binding of 125I-HPlg was observed when BSA was used in place of SK. The binding of 125I-HPlg and SK 1:1 complex, preformed in solution, to the HPlg-precoated plate was similar to the binding of 125I-HPlg to the HPlg·SK-coated plate (Fig. 1). The level of bound125I-HPlg decreased in the presence of 10 mmEACA (Fig. 1). Only limited amount of ternary complex formed if BPlg was tested instead of HPlg (Fig. 1). In separate experiments, the125I-labeled proteins were used to determine the molarity of Plgs coated on the plate surface and the SK that bound to the Plgs on the surface. The amount of HPlg and BPlg coating on the surface of each well was 4.97 ± 0.07 and 3.91 ± 0.06 pmol (n = 6), respectively. The amount of SK that bound to the immobilized HPlg and BPlg was 5.01 ± 0.07 and 3.08 ± 0.08 pmol (n = 5), respectively. Therefore, it appeared that the binding of SK to either of these two Plgs coated on the well surface is very close to 1:1 stoichiometry. It also confirmed that a nearly 1:1:1 of HPlg·SK·HPlg ternary complex existed in our sandwich assay when referred to the amount of HPlg that was bound on the HPlg·SK-coated plate in the saturated condition (Fig. 1). However, in case of BPlg, only the BPlg·SK complex, not the BPlg·SK·BPlg ternary complex, was detected. Recombinant truncated SK peptides of COOH-terminal or NH2-terminal domains, SK-(220–414) and SK-(16–251), were used to identify the interaction mode in the HPlg·SK·HPlg ternary complex. The concentration-dependent binding of125I-SK-(220–414) or 125I-SK-(16–251) to HPlg was determined. Typical saturable binding curves are shown in Fig. 2. Based on the Scatchard transformation of the data, SK-(220–414) bound to two classes of sites of HPlg withKd of 1.50 ± 0.13 × 10−7and 2.44 ± 0.16 × 10−6m(mean ± S.D., n = 3), while SK-(16–251) bound to a single class of sites with a Kd of 4.09 ± 0.35 × 10−7m (mean ± S.D., n = 3). Similar experiments were also performed using kringle 1–5 of HPlg and BPlg instead of HPlg. The binding of SK-(220–414) to human kringle 1–5 had only one class of sites with aKd of 3.26 ± 0.13 × 10−6m, and SK-(16–251) bound to human kringle 1–5 with aKd of 4.62 ± 0.25 × 10−7m. SK-(220–414) bound to two classes of sites of BPlg withKd of 0.52 ± 0.07 × 10−6m and 2.25 ± 0.16 × 10−6m, while SK-(16–251) bound to a single class of sites with a Kd of 1.43 ± 0.23 × 10−6m. Competition between human kringle 1–5 or micro-HPlg with intact HPlg for SK binding sites was evaluated by a competitive binding assay. The binding of 125I-SK-(16–251) with HPlg was effectively competed for by human kringle 1–5, not by micro-HPlg (active site domain of HPlg) (Fig. 3 A). Thus, SK-(16–251) obviously could only interact with human kringle 1–5. On the other hand, both human kringle 1–5 and micro-HPlg could compete with HPlg for the binding of 125I-SK-(220–414) (Fig. 3 B). At a high concentration of competitor peptide, 40–60% of the binding was inhibited (Fig. 3 B). These data confirmed that SK-(220–414) could bind to HPlg through interaction with kringle domain and catalytic domain independently. The result of the cross-link experiment also confirmed that native SK can react with kringle domain of HPlg. Two high molecular weight protein bands were observed in the SDS-PAGE of cross-linked products of human kringle 1–5 and native SK (Fig. 4, lane 3). These bands contained both SK and HPlg proteins, since both bands showed positive reaction with anti-HPlg and anti-SK polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 4, lanes 4 and 5). The protein bands of 100 and 155 kDa represented a 1:1 SK·human kringle 1–5 complex and a 1:1:1 kringle 1–5·SK·kringle 1–5 ternary complex, respectively. The binding of NH2- or COOH-terminal domains of SK to the kringle domain of HPlg would result in the formation of 1:1 SK and kringle domain complex, while the binding of the COOH-terminal domains of SK to one kringle domain of HPlg and the binding of the NH2-terminal domain of the same SK to a second kringle domain would lead to the formation of a ternary complex.Figure 4Cross-link of human kringle 1–5 and native SK. Human kringle 1–5 and native SK at a concentration of 0.3 mg/ml were cross-linked by reaction with 0.1 mmbis-(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate. The products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the protein bands were transferred to Immobilon-P membrane, stained with Amido Black or with Western blot techniques. Lane 1, human kringle 1–5 only; lane 2, native SK only; lane 3, human kringle 1–5 plus native SK. Lanes 1–3 were stained with Amido Black. Lanes 4 and 5 were parallel samples of lane 3, immunostained with anti-HPlg (lane 4) or anti-SK (lane 5) antiserum.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Competition between different SK moieties for binding to HPlg was also studied. The binding of SK-(16–251) to HPlg was completely inhibited by SK-(220–414) (Fig. 5 A), and the binding of SK-(220–414) to HPlg was partially inhibited by SK-(16–251) as well as SK-(16–191) (Fig. 5 B). Therefore, the binding sites of SK-(16–251) and SK-(220–414) on the kringle domain should be at an overlapping location. Enzymatic assays were performed to determine the functions of the two significant HPlg-binding SK peptides. Neither SK-(220–414) nor SK-(16–251) alone at a catalytic concentration could activate HPlg (Fig. 6 A). However, when these two SK domains were added to HPlg simultaneously, HPlg was activated (Fig. 6 A). In the parallel SDS-PAGE analysis, the conversion of HPlg to HPlm by the combination of SK-(220–414) and SK-(16–251) was completed in 30 min, as the band of HPlg (94-kDa) disappeared and both the heavy (66-kDa) and light (26-kDa) chains were detected (Fig. 6 B, lane 4). To determine if SK-(220–414) and SK-(16–251) have effects on the activation of HPlg by full-length SK, HPlg was incubated with a catalytic amount of SK-(16–414) alone or in the presence of various concentrations of SK fragments. SK-(16–251) in a nanomolar concentration range could dose-dependently amplify the activation of HPlg by SK-(16–414). Increasing the concentrations of SK-(16–251) to micromolar range caused more rapid enhancement, and the extent of amplification reached a plateau (Fig. 7 A). In contrast, nanomolar concentrations of SK-(220–414) had no effect on the HPlg activation, and increasing amounts of SK-(220–414) to micromolar concentrations progressively inhibited the activation of HPlg by SK-(16–414) (Fig. 7 B).Figure 7The effects of SK-(16–251) and SK-(220–414) on the activation of HPlg by SK-(16–414).

The rate of HPlm production was monitored with a spectrophotometer as in Fig. 6 A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We have previously demonstrated that several regions in the SK molecule were essential for its functions as a plasminogen activator (19Young K.C. Shi G.Y. Chang Y.F. Chang B.I. Chang L.C. Lai M.D. Chuang W.J. Wu H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29601-29606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In this study, we have used peptide fragments of SK and HPlg to further elucidate the interaction between these two molecules. It has been clearly demonstrated and widely accepted that formation of a 1:1 complex of SK and HPlg, as the catalytically active unit, is the first step in Plg activation (5McClintock D.K. Bell P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 43: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 6Reddy K.N.N. Markus G. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1683-1691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Reddy K.N.N. Enzyme. 1988; 40: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the process of free HPlg activation, an enzyme-substrate intermediate, in the form of HPlg·SK·HPlg, might be present temporarily during activation. In our study, the possible existence of a HPlg·SK·HPlg ternary complex was demonstrated by a sandwich-binding experiment (Fig. 1). We also demonstrated that preformed HPlg·SK complex could bind to HPlg in an approximately 1:1 ratio. In contrast, in the report of Summariaet al. (20Summaria L. Boreisha I. Barlow G.H. Robbins K.C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1987; 58: 772-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), a HPlm B-chain·SK·HPlg ternary complex, but not a HPlg·SK·HPlg ternary complex, was proposed based on the results of agarose double diffusion analysis. Two binding sites for the SK and HPlg interaction have been proposed, and when SK is bound to intact HPlg, the two interaction sites of SK are occupied by one single HPlg molecule. In the HPlm B-chain complex, only one of the two sites on SK is occupied, leaving the other one free for interacting with a second HPlg molecule. However, no explanation for the precipitin zones around the wells containing the HPlg and SK mixture was given (Fig. 1, A (well 1) and B (well 4) of Ref. 20Summaria L. Boreisha I. Barlow G.H. Robbins K.C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1987; 58: 772-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). One possible explanation is that HPlg and SK might form insoluble polymers in wells of agarose, which can not migrate into the agarose gel. The precipitin reaction of SK and HPlg, in a manner analogous to an antigen-antibody reaction, might be the result of formation of insoluble polymers in which each molecule can bind to more than one reacting molecule to form an insoluble network (20Summaria L. Boreisha I. Barlow G.H. Robbins K.C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1987; 58: 772-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Similar high molecular weight polymers were also observed in sedimentation velocity analysis and native gel electrophoresis of HPlg·SK complexes (34Davies M.C. Englert M.E. De Renzo E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2651-2656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,35Tomar R.H. Taylor F.B. Biochem. J. 1971; 125: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Results of the sandwich binding assays give direct evidence to support the hypothesis that one SK molecule can interact with two HPlg molecules simultaneously. Although two interaction sites on SK for HPlg were suggested in the previous report (20Summaria L. Boreisha I. Barlow G.H. Robbins K.C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1987; 58: 772-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), the specific locations have not been identified. A straight line was obtained in the Scatchard plot of the binding of the NH2-terminal domain of SK to HPlg, indicating only one binding site was involved. On the other hand, a curved line was obtained in the similar plot of the binding of COOH-terminal domains of SK to HPlg, indicating in this case that two binding sites were involved (Fig. 2). The binding of the NH2-terminal domain of SK with HPlg was competed for by human kringle 1–5, but not by micro-HPlg, while the binding of COOH-terminal domains of SK with HPlg could be competed for by both kringle 1–5 and micro-HPlg (Fig. 3). Therefore, we conclude that SK had three binding sites for HPlg. One binding site located at the NH2-terminal domain of SK is specific for the interaction with the kringle domain of HPlg. There are two other binding sites on the COOH-terminal domains of SK; one specifically interacts with the catalytic domain, and the other interacts with the kringle domain of HPlg. Since the binding of the COOH- and NH2-terminal domains of SK is mutually exclusive for binding to the HPlg kringle domain (Fig. 5), these two binding sites of SK cannot interact with the same HPlg molecule simultaneously. On the basis of the binding constants we determined, we conclude that the order of binding strength was as follows: catalytic domain·SK-(220–414) > kringle domain·SK-(16–251) > kringle domain·SK-(220–414). Taken together, the binding of COOH-terminal domains of SK to the catalytic and kringle domains of the first HPlg molecule and the binding of the NH2-terminal domain of the same SK to the kringle domain of a second HPlg molecule would result in the formation of the HPlg·SK·HPlg ternary complex as demonstrated in the sandwich binding assay (Fig. 1). The result of the cross-linking experiment (Fig. 4) also supports the existence of the ternary complex. The hypothetical binding mode could also explain the presence of high molecular weight complexes of these two molecules (34Davies M.C. Englert M.E. De Renzo E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2651-2656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,35Tomar R.H. Taylor F.B. Biochem. J. 1971; 125: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Formation of the ternary complex is inhibited by 10 mm EACA (Fig. 1), since it might interfere with the interaction of SK and lysine-binding sites on the kringle domain of HPlg. A similar explanation could also be applied to the observations that high molecular weight complexes of SK and HPlg shifted to a 1:1 complex in 100 mm EACA (34Davies M.C. Englert M.E. De Renzo E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2651-2656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Ling C.M. Summaria L. Robbins K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1419-1425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of HPlg by SK was substantially inhibited by EACA as described in a previous report (37Alkjaersig N. Fletcher A.P. Sherry S. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 832-837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and our own observation. 2K.-C. Young, G.-Y. Shi, D.-H. Wu, L.-C. Chang, B.-I. Chang, C.-P. Ou, and H.-L. Wu, unpublished data. The inhibitory effects of EACA could be partially due to its interference on the formation of the HPlg·SK·HPlg complex. When SK is used as a thrombolytic agent, with HPlg in excess and no EACA, the condition would be in favor of the formation of the HPlg·SK·HPlg ternary enzyme-substrate complex. The ternary complex might represent the intermediate of the two-stage activation process proposed by Reddy and Markus (6Reddy K.N.N. Markus G. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1683-1691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was clearly demonstrated that HPlg·SK as well as the HPlm·SK complex can activate Plgs with cleavage site-resistant HPlg (38Davidson D.J. Higgins D.L. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3585-3590Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The HPlg·SK complex is remarkable in that SK induces a typical serine protease active site in the HPlg molecule. Finding the interaction sites between SK and HPlg should be valuable in revealing the mechanism and the species specificity of the active complex formation. Two peptide segments, Arg579–Met584and Arg625–Lys627 (by the numbering convention for the full-length HPlg) were believed to be involved in a reaction with SK, by using the human-bovine hybrid micro-HPlg (39Wang J. Reich E. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1768-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrated that COOH-terminal, not NH2-terminal, domains of SK had strong affinity for micro-HPlg. Therefore, we assume that the COOH-terminal domains play a major role in interaction with micro-HPlg and are essential for induction of the active site in HPlg. The inertness of SK toward BPlg was also attributed to the specific interaction sites. The weak binding between BPlg and COOH-terminal domains of SK is consistent with the incapacity of SK to form activator with BPlg. However, the binding of BPlg and COOH-terminal domains was observed, although weaker than HPlg. There should be still some unidentified protein segments in HPlg that are involved in the interaction between Plgs and SK. According to the reaction model proposed by Markus et al.(40Markus G. Evers J.L. Hobika G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6495-6504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the role of the SK moiety in HPlg·SK·HPlg ternary complex may have two components: (a) SK may open the active center on one HPlg, thereby inducing it to serve as an activator HPlg; (b) SK may modulate the geometry near the Arg560–Val561 bond of the substrate HPlg, and the activating peptide bond was brought toward the active center of the activator HPlg to form the transient Michaelis complex. The COOH-terminal domains of SK Val158–Ala378 were previously demonstrated to be responsible for the formation of enzymatic center in complexing with HPlg (19Young K.C. Shi G.Y. Chang Y.F. Chang B.I. Chang L.C. Lai M.D. Chuang W.J. Wu H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29601-29606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The present study showed that HPlg could be effectively activated by combination of the two functionless SK peptides, SK-(220–414) and SK-(16–251). We assumed that the NH2-terminal domain SK-(16–251) might provide the region of polypeptide 158–220 in complement with SK-(220–414) to form an activator with HPlg. In addition, SK-(16–251) might also function as a substrate modulator, since it could amplify the activation of HPlg by SK-(16–414) (Fig. 7 A). The most plausible explanation for this observation is that HPlg, by interacting with the NH2-terminal domain of SK with its kringle 1–5 domain, becomes a better substrate for activation by the HPlg·SK activator complex. The hypothesis is also in consistent with the following observations: (a) a series of NH2-terminal truncated SK peptides still retains the comparable activities of virgin enzyme complex with HPlg but has lower rates of HPlg activation (19Young K.C. Shi G.Y. Chang Y.F. Chang B.I. Chang L.C. Lai M.D. Chuang W.J. Wu H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29601-29606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar); (b) micro-HPlg, which lacks kringle domain, is activated by SK less effectively than Glu-HPlg (29Shi G.Y. Wu H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17071-17075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, further studies are required to reveal the specific binding sites on the NH2-domain of SK and kringle of HPlg as well as their reaction mechanism. It is possible that binding of SK-(16–251) to the kringle domain of HPlg induces the conversion of Glu-HPlg to the Lys-HPlg conformation, which might be attributed to the stimulating effect of the NH2-terminal domain of SK, since SK-(16–251) cannot enhance activation of Lys-HPlg by SK.2 However, it is also possible that the NH2-terminal domain of SK could induce the conformational changes near the activating peptide bond (Arg560–Val561) of HPlg through a different mechanism. On the other hand, the HPlg activation by SK-(16–414) is inhibited by SK-(220–414). It could be due to the fact that excess SK-(220–414) would compete with SK-(16–414) for binding to kringle 1–5 as well as to the catalytic domain of HPlg and inhibit the formation of the HPlg activator (Fig. 7 B). This observation is in agreement with the previous finding that SK-(244–352) dose-dependently inhibited the generation of an active site by full-length SK and HPlg (41Reed G.L. Lin L.F. Parhami-Seren B. Kussie P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10266-10271Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) . The activation scheme of HPlg by SK is proposed, based on the findings on multiple functions of SK as shown in Scheme FS1. The COOH-terminal domains of SK can bind to the kringle and the catalytic domains of HPlg. The binding of the catalytic domain of HPlg to the COOH-terminal domains of SK is most important in inducing a conformational change in the active center of HPlg (Scheme FS1, part a) and, therefore, forming an activator of HPlg, which can specifically hydrolyze the activating peptide bond Arg560–Val561 of the substrate HPlg. The NH2-terminal domain of SK, by interaction with the kringle domain of HPlg, might alter the geometry of substrate HPlg especially near the region of the activating peptide bond (part b) and make it more effectively converted to HPlm (part c). The ternary complex in Scheme FS1, HPlg·SK·HPlg, which was demonstrated in the sandwich binding assays, might also represent the transient Michaelis complex proposed by Markus et al. (40Markus G. Evers J.L. Hobika G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6495-6504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The multiple functions of SK domains in reacting with HPlg render SK a very efficient HPlg activator. In the case of BPlg, the binding of its catalytic domain to the COOH-terminal domains of SK is significantly weaker than HPlg, and no ternary complex of BPlg and SK formed. This might be one of the reasons why BPlg cannot be activated directly by SK (3Wulf R.J. Mertz E.T. Can. J. Biochem. 1969; 47: 927-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The reaction of SK and HPlg is a unique example of protein-protein interaction that is very important in the regulation of various biological functions and deserves further delineation. SK, as a simple protein cofactor in the activation of HPlg, may provide a unique opportunity to study the mechanism of reaction between the protein cofactors and enzymes. The detailed mechanism, when elucidated, may be exploited to design a new generation of better SK as a thrombolytic agent.

Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1015-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) but has also been identified as a component of transcytotic vesicles (15Sztul E. Colombo M. Stahl P. Samanta R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1876-1885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, p115 has been implicated, together with NSF and SNAP, in the process of reassembly of post-mitotic Golgi fragments into Golgi cisternae (18Rabouille C. Levine T.P. Peters J.M. Warren G.

Uso1p, the yeast homolog of p115, is required for assembly of the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi SNARE complex (20Sapperstein S.K. Lupashin V.V. Schmitt H.D. Waters M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Other cytosolic factors such as Rab proteins and their effectors were also shown to be involved in this process (21Plutner H. Cox A.D. Pind S. Khosravi F.R. Bourne J.R. Schwaninger R. Der C.J.

It appears, however, that the amount of Rab proteins present on the membrane is sufficient to promote the transport reactionin vitro. It was demonstrated originally by Clary and Rothman (24Clary D.O. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10109-10117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that in addition to NSF and the SNAPs, several other cytosolic factors were required for reconstituting the SNAP-dependent transport assay. The need for additional cytosolic transport factors was demonstrated further for the p115-dependent assay (6Waters M.G. Clary D.O. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1015-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) as well as for direct fusion between Golgi stacks (17Elazar Z. Orci L. Ostermann J. Amherdt M. Tanigawa G. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus, identification and isolation of these novel factors are essential for understanding the exact molecular machinery of intracellular protein traffic. In the present study we describe the purification of a novel 16-kDa transport factor, p16, from bovine brain on the basis of the in vitro intra-Golgi transport assay. Our data suggest that p16 is a transport factor that participates in the docking/fusion reaction. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-G protein-containing donor Golgi membranes from 15B cells and acceptor membranes from wild-type Chinese hamster ovary cells were prepared as described (25Balch W.E. Dunphy W.G. Braell W.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 405-416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay. The pH values were determined at room temperature. All fractionations were performed at 4 °C. All cytosolic fractions tested in this assay were dialyzed to 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (dialysis buffer) before their addition to the transport assay. The standard assay mixture (25 μl) contained 0.4 μCi of UDP-N-[3H]acetylglucosamine (America Radiolabeled Chemical), 5 μl of a 1:1 mixture of donor and acceptor Chinese hamster ovary cellular Golgi membrane, and crude bovine brain cytosol as described (25Balch W.E. Dunphy W.G. Braell W.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 405-416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Bovine brain cytosol was prepared by the method of Malhotraet al. (26Malhotra V. Serafini T. Orci L. Shepherd J.C. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1989; 58: 329-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Recombinant His6-NSF and His6-αSNAP were prepared as described (27Whiteheart S.W. Griff I.C. Brunner M. Clary D.O. Mayer T. Buhrow S.A. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Fraction Iβ was obtained by chromatography of 500 ml of 40% ammonium sulfate precipitate on a 400-ml Fast Flow Q column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol. The column was washed with 800 ml of the same buffer and then eluted with a 0.1–0.5 m KCl gradient in 1,200 ml. Nine-ml fractions were collected, dialyzed to reduce the KCl concentration to 50 mm, and assayed for transport activity in the presence of 0.5 μg of p115, 5 ng of His6-NSF, 60 ng of His6-αSNAP, and 5 μl of Golgi membranes. Typically, a peak of transport activity was eluted at 0.22–0.30 m KCl, and the peak fractions were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration using Amicon PM-10 filter. The concentrated pool, designated β, was dialyzed against dialysis buffer and had a protein concentration of about 30 mg/ml. p115 was purified from bovine liver cytosol as described previously (6Waters M.G. Clary D.O. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1015-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The assay is a modification of the one described by Waterset al. (6Waters M.G. Clary D.O. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1015-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The 25-μl assay contained 0.4 μCi of UDP-N-[3H]acetylglucosamine, 5 μl of a 1:1 mixture of donor and acceptor Chinese hamster ovary cellular Golgi membrane, 100 μg of Iβ, 0.5 μg of p115, 5 ng of recombinant NSF, 60 ng of recombinant SNAP, 10 μm palmitoyl-coenzyme A, ATP and UTP regeneration systems, and 10 μl of the various cytosolic fractions as indicated in the figure legends. The transport reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 2 h. N-[3H]Acetylglucosamine incorporated into VSV-G protein was determined as described previously (25Balch W.E. Dunphy W.G. Braell W.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 405-416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Bovine brains were obtained immediately after slaughtering and placed on ice-cold 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 340 mm sucrose. The tissue (600 g) was placed on a glass Waring blender, which was then filled with 800 ml of homogenization buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mm KCl, 250 mm sucrose, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μm 1,10-phenantroline, 2 μm pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml aprotonin, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin. The homogenate was centrifuged at 7,500 × g in a Sorvall GS3 rotor for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatants were pooled and centrifuged at 120,000 × g in a Beckman Ti-45 rotor for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatants were pooled and dialyzed against 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol (buffer A). The dialyzed material was collected and clarified by centrifugation at 7,500 ×g in a Sorvall GS3 rotor for 1 h at 4 °C. This material was designated bovine brain cytosol and had a protein concentration of about 8 mg/ml. The protein concentration of bovine brain cytosol was adjusted to 7.5 mg/ml by dilution with fresh dialysis buffer, and KCl was added to a final concentration of 0.5 m. Polyethylene Glycol 4000 was added slowly to a final concentration of 12.5%. The solution was stirred for 30 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged in a Sorvall GS3 rotor at 8,500 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellets were resuspended in a 100-ml Dounce homogenizer. The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 120,000 × g for 6 min at 4 °C, the protein concentration was adjusted to 7 mg/ml and the salt concentration to 0.1 m KCl. This material was termed polyethylene glycol precipitate. The polyethylene glycol precipitate was loaded onto a 400-ml Fast Flow Q column equilibrated with buffer A containing 10% glycerol at 3 ml/min. The column was washed with 400 ml of the equilibration buffer and then eluted with a 1,200-ml gradient of KCl at a range of 0.1–0.5 m. Two active fractions were detected, one in the unbound material and the other in fractions eluted from 0.2 to 0.5 m KCl. All unbound protein was pooled and termed flow-through Q; it had a protein concentration of 0.4 mg/ml. The active fractions eluted from the column were termed β (see above). The flow-through Q pool was transferred to Spectra/por 3 dialysis bags and dialyzed against 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.6, and 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation in a Sorvall SS34 rotor at 7,800 × gfor 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant, which had a protein concentration of about 0.21 mg/ml, was concentrated about 10-fold by ultrafiltration on an Amicon PM3 filter. The concentrated isoelectric supernatant was centrifuged for 10 min in a microcentrifuge to remove insoluble material, and the supernatant was chromatographed on a 24-ml Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol at 0.3 ml/min. Fractions of 0.7 ml were collected and tested for transport activity. A single peak of activity was detected at an elution volume corresponding to a molecular mass of 14–16 kDa as determined by low molecular weight calibration kit (Pharmacia). This material had a protein concentration of about 0.08 mg/ml. The Superdex 75 pool was adjusted by dialysis to 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol and loaded onto a 1-ml Mono S HR 5/5 (Pharmacia) column equilibrated by the same buffer at 0.5 ml/ml. The column was washed with the equilibration buffer and eluted with 25 ml of a 0–400 mm KCl gradient. Fractions (1 ml) were collected, and aliquots were analyzed for transport activity and by electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Blue staining. The fraction purified in this way was referred to as p16. The cell-free system that reconstitutes intra-Golgi transport has been used in recent years for the characterization and isolation of several factors involved in intracellular trafficking (2Rothman J.E. Orci L. Nature. 1992; 355: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Proteins such as NSF, SNAPs, and p115 were isolated by this transport assay in which the activity of each factor could be assessed specifically. One such an experimental design is a complementation assay where saturating levels of different crude cytosolic fractions are added to the transport assay, and a signal is observed only upon the addition of the protein of interest. To identify novel soluble factors required to reconstitute intra-Golgi transport in vitro, we analyzed the transport activity of different cytosolic fractions in the presence of saturating levels of NSF, SNAP, and p115. Fig. 1 A describes the fractionation of 12.5% polyethylene glycol precipitate of bovine brain cytosolic protein on a Q-Sepharose anion exchange column. This chromatography step separated two soluble factors with considerable transport activity (Fig. 1 B). A peak of transport activity could be detected in the unbound material and was tentatively termed α; another factor that showed transport activity was eluted as a single peak between 0.22 and 0.30 m KCl and was tentatively termed β (Fig. 1 B). Each of these cytosolic factors reconstituted only part of the transport activity observed in the presence of crude cytosol, whereas both factors together recovered the full transport activity (Fig. 1 C). We then followed the transport activity present in the flow-through material of the Fast Flow Q column (α, see Figs. 1 and2 D). Fig. 2 describes the chromatography of factor α on a CM-Sepharose cation exchange column. The transport activity of the different fractions eluted from this column was determined in the presence or absence of β. Transport activity was clearly detected in the unbound material and was termed Iα (Fig. 2 B). Significant transport activity was also observed in fractions eluted at 0.15–0.25 m KCl, tentatively termed IIα (Fig. 2 B). When the different fractions obtained from the CM-Sepharose column were tested in the presence of β, the transport activity of both bound and unbound materials was increased significantly (Fig. 2 B). We next tested whether all three factors, Iα, IIα, and β, are required to reconstitute the transport assay to a level comparable to that observed with crude cytosol. As shown in Fig. 2 C, factors Iα, IIα, and β all showed low transport activity when each was added separately to the transport assay containing NSF, αSNAP, and p115. When either Iα or IIα was added together with β, a synergistic effect was obtained leading to about 80% of the signal observed with the cytosol. When both Iα and IIα were added in the absence of β only a small increase in transport activity was observed. Together, Iα, IIα, and β reconstituted the full transport activity. These experiments demonstrate the involvement of at least three different cytosolic factors (as illustrated in Fig. 2 D) in intra-Golgi transport in addition to NSF, SNAP, and p115. In the present study we focused on the purification of the transport factor present in IIα. To assure that IIα acts as part of the known transport machinery, we tested whether the signal obtained with the different factors was NSF-, SNAP- and p115-dependent. Golgi membranes treated with N-ethylmaleimide were tested for NSF-dependent transport activity. IIα-dependent signals could be observed only in the presence of recombinant NSF (Fig. 3 A). Furthermore, in the absence of either αSNAP or p115, no significant IIα-dependent transport activity could be observed, indicating that IIα is acting in conjunction with the known transport factors. Increasing concentrations of IIα in a transport reaction containing NSF, αSNAP, p115, and β resulted in a saturable signal (Fig. 3 B). This signal could be observed in the presence of 150 μm brefeldin A, a drug that prevents budding of transport vesicles and promotes uncoupled fusion (17Elazar Z. Orci L. Ostermann J. Amherdt M. Tanigawa G. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 28Orci L. Tagaya M. Amherdt M. Perrelet A. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott S.J. Klausner R.D. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1991; 64: 1183-1195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 B). Apparently, IIα is involved in docking and fusion and not in vesicle budding. The IIα-dependent assay was used further for the purification of the protein responsible for this transport activity. Using the IIα-dependent assay a 16-kDa protein, p16, was purified from bovine brain cytosol by the following steps: (i) ammonium sulfate precipitation; (ii) Q-Sepharose anion exchange chromatography; (iii) CM-Sepharose cation exchange chromatography; (iv) gel filtration on a Superdex 75; and (v) Mono S cation exchange chromatography. Fractions obtained from each chromatography step were tested in the IIα-dependent assay. The quantitation of p16 purification is summarized in Table I. This procedure resulted in the purification of a 16-kDa polypeptide (on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) to apparent homogeneity. Protein profile and the transport activity of the last purification step are depicted in Fig. 4. A typical purification resulted in about 0.3 mg of the 16-kDa protein with an ∼1,400-fold increase in specific activity and 4% activity yield. We have tentatively termed this protein p16.Table IQuantitation of p16 purificationStageProteinSpecific transport activityPurificationYieldmgcpm/mg-fold%Differential centrifugation8,500141100PEG precipitation1,20088689Flow-through Q2164242977Isoelectric precipitation1505253666CM-Sepharose202,10014435Superdex 7528,40057614Mono S FPLC0.318,00014404 Open table in a new tab It has been demonstrated previously that the signal in the intra-Golgi transport system could be mediated by coated vesicles (29Ostermann J. Orci L. Tani K. Amherdt M. Ravazzola M. Elazar Z. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 1015-1025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), and as such, it is sensitive to GTPγS. In the absence of the coat proteins, the Golgi cisternae fuse directly with each other, and the assay becomes resistant to GTPγS (17Elazar Z. Orci L. Ostermann J. Amherdt M. Tanigawa G. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 28Orci L. Tagaya M. Amherdt M. Perrelet A. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott S.J. Klausner R.D. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1991; 64: 1183-1195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 demonstrates that transport observed in the presence of crude cytosol is inhibited by GTPγS, whereas p16-dependent assay is not. This result is consistent with the finding that the IIα-dependent assay is resistant to brefeldin A. Taken together, these results suggest that p16 is likely to be involved in docking or fusion rather than in vesicle production. The possibility that p16 affects glycosylation of VSV-G protein rather than the transport process per se was ruled out because we found no difference in the rate of [3H]UDP-GlcNAc uptake into the Golgi lumen (30Perez M. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4671-4678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence versus the absence of purified p16 (2 ± 0.06 pmol/min/mg compared with 1.9 ± 0.04 pmol/min/mg, respectively). We have utilized the well characterized intra-Golgi cell-free transport assay to detect yet unidentified cytosolic transport factors. This work describes the identification of three cytosolic factors and the purification of a novel 16-kDa protein required for intra-Golgi transport. In the process of identifying novel cytosolic factors required for intra-Golgi protein transport in vitro, we characterized three different protein pools each exhibiting low transport activity in the presence of NSF, SNAP, and p115, yet together they reconstituted the full transport activity observed with crude cytosol. Previously, Waters et al. (6Waters M.G. Clary D.O. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1015-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) identified two crude cytosolic factors required to reconstitute intra-Golgi transport in vitro in addition to NSF, SNAP, and p115. Factors α and β described in the present study could be related to these factors. In this study we were able to separate further the α factor into two distinct activities. Pool β significantly stimulated the signal of either Iα or IIα, whereas combining Iα and IIα in the absence of β resulted in only a slight increase in the assay signal (Fig. 2 C). Conceivably, both α factors could share the active protein component. However, further purification of Iα based on its transport activity revealed that the active component in this pool was a 56-kDa polypeptide, 2A. Porat and Z. Elazar, unpublished data. whereas in the present study we show that the transport activity of IIα was attributed to p16. It could still be possible that both crude fractions in the early stages of the purification might include small amounts of reciprocal activity. We described here a purification procedure based on a functional intra-Golgi transport assay, which led to the isolation of a novel low molecular weight protein, p16. Using this purification procedure, p16 was enriched by about 1,400-fold to apparent homogeneity. Similar enrichment of transport activity was required for the other soluble transport factors, such as αSNAP and p115, indicating that the activity of p16 in the cytosol is comparable to these other transport factors. Amino acid sequence analysis of five different tryptic peptides derived from the pure 16-kDa protein indicates that it is a novel protein (data not shown). We have recently cloned the p16 encoding cDNA from bovine brain, and all sequences of the peptides obtained from the endogenous protein are represented in the putative cDNA p16 amino acid sequence. 3Y. Sagiv, A. Legesse-Miller, and Z. Elazar, manuscript in preparation. This clearly demonstrates that the 16-kDa protein in the pure fraction is a single polypeptide. We also found that a recombinant p16 was active in the intra-Golgi transport cell-free assay, strongly supporting the notion that the 16-kDa polypeptide described here is the active component of the pure fraction. 4It should be noted that affinity-purified anti-p16 antibodies directed against the recombinant protein specifically inhibited the cell-free intra-Golgi transport assay in the presence of crude cytosol, hence demonstrating that p16 is required for intra-Golgi transport under conditions in which the cytosolic factors coatomer and ARF are present. Several well defined steps are required for intracellular vesicular protein traffic, including budding, targeting, docking, and fusion of vesicles with their target membranes, each requiring a different set of cytosolic factors. It has been demonstrated previously that ARF-1 and the coatomer are the only cytosolic factors required for the production of Golgi-derived COPI (31Orci L. Palmer D.J. Amherdt M. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 364: 732-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Vesicle targeting involves interaction between integral membrane proteins, the v-SNAREs located on vesicles and the t-SNAREs present on the target membrane (32Söllner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar, 33Pfeffer S.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 441-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The v-SNARE·t-SNARE complex then binds SNAP and NSF which, in turn, catalyze the disassembly of the SNARE complex, thus initiating fusion (32Söllner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). This core machinery of protein transport probably requires the participation of additional accessory factors. Our data suggest that all three factors described in this study, Iα, β, and p16, are part of the targeting and fusion machinery. Analysis of the intra-Golgi transport assay revealed that in the absence of the coat proteins the assay measures mainly fusion between the Golgi cisternae (17Elazar Z. Orci L. Ostermann J. Amherdt M. Tanigawa G. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This uncoupled fusion reaction requires known components such as NSF, SNAP, and p115 and is resistant to GTPγS. We demonstrated here that the p16-dependent assay was not inhibited by GTPγS or brefeldin A, indicating that it represents an uncoupled fusion. Based on these results we suggest that p16 plays a role in docking or fusion of vesicles rather than being part of the budding apparatus. This work was initiated in the laboratory of Dr. James E. Rothman in Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York. We thank Haim Great for technical assistance, Tony Futerman, Shulamit Michaeli, and Yigal Avivi for critical reading of the manuscript."

ABP-deficient and ABP-containing cells were transfected with the cDNAs coding for glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX, a platelet receptor that interacts with ABP. Most of the GP Ib-IX remained inside the ABP-deficient cells. When ABP was present, functional GP Ib-IX was inserted into the membrane. GP Ib-IX lacking the domain that interacts with ABP also showed increased membrane insertion in ABP-expressing cells. Furthermore, a fragment of ABP that lacks the dimerization and GP Ib-IX-binding sites restored the spreading of the cells and increased the amount of GP Ib-IX in the membrane. Finally, expression of ABP also increased endogenous β1 integrin in the membrane. These results indicate that 1) ABP maintains the properties of the cell such that adhesion receptors can be efficiently expressed in the membrane; 2) increased receptor expression is accompanied by increased ability of the cell to spread; and 3) ABP exerts its effect by a mechanism that does not appear to involve direct cross-linking of actin filaments or direct interaction with receptors.

The membrane of mammalian cells is lined by a network of actin filaments cross-linked by a variety of proteins.

Recently, the availability of a melanoma cell line that lacks actin-binding protein (13Cunningham C.C. Gorlin J.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Byers H.R. Stossel T.P. Science. 1992; 255: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) has provided evidence that ABP is important in regulating the morphology and motility of the cell. Thus, the surface of ABP-deficient cells is covered with large blebs, and the cells display a decreased ability to extend the membrane projections required for normal spreading and motility. After transfection of the ABP-deficient cells with cDNA encoding ABP, the cells regained their ability to extend membrane projections, spread, and migrate. Extension of membrane processes requires both a reorganization of the cytoskeleton and an increased availability of membrane at the site of the extension. Because ABP is known to be a component of a specialized part of the cytoskeleton that is in close apposition to the membrane and associates with specific membrane glycoproteins (4Solum N.O.

This receptor consists of three transmembrane subunits (GP Ibα, GP Ibβ, and GP IX) (16Berndt M.C. Gregory C. Kabral A. Zola H. Fournier D. Castaldi P.A. Eur. J.

Interaction of the receptor complex with ABP is mediated by a region in the central portion of the cytoplasmic domain of GP Ibα (9Andrews R.K. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol.

ABP-deficient cells or cells that had been stably transfected with the cDNA for ABP were transfected with the cDNA for the three subunits of the GP Ib-IX complex. In the absence of ABP, most of the GP Ib-IX remained inside the cell. The presence of ABP resulted in increased expression of GP Ib-IX in the membrane and increased ability of the cells to bind von Willebrand factor. The increased expression of GP Ib-IX in the membrane of the ABP-containing cells did not result from association of GP Ib-IX with ABP because a truncated form of GP Ib-IX that lacked the domain that interacts with ABP also showed increased expression in the membrane. Furthermore, a fragment of ABP that lacks the carboxyl-terminal 548 amino acids and therefore cannot bind to GP Ib-IX (19Meyer S.C. Zuerbig S. Cunningham C.C. Hartwig J.H. Bissell T. Gardner K.

Res. Commun. 1981; 100: 814-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) was just as effective as full-length ABP in increasing the surface expression of GP Ib-IX and also in restoring the ability of the cells to extend projections and to spread. Finally, expression of ABP also increased the amount of endogenous β1 integrin in the membrane, even though there is no evidence that this receptor interacts with ABP. These studies suggest that 1) a previously unrecognized function of ABP is to maintain the properties of the cell such that adhesion receptors can be efficiently expressed in the membrane; 2) increased receptor expression is accompanied by restoration of the ability of the membrane to extend projections and to spread; and 3) ABP exerts its effect by a mechanism that does not involve direct cross-linking of actin filaments or direct interaction with the adhesion receptors. The melanoma cells used in these studies were derived from a human malignant melanoma lacking actin-binding protein (13Cunningham C.C. Gorlin J.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Byers H.R. Stossel T.P. Science. 1992; 255: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). To develop a cell line that expressed actin-binding protein, cells were transfected with the cDNA coding for actin-binding protein (13Cunningham C.C. Gorlin J.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Byers H.R. Stossel T.P. Science. 1992; 255: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Both ABP-deficient and ABP-containing cells (kindly provided by Dr. C. Cunningham, Brigham Women's Hospital, Boston) were stably transfected with the cDNAs coding for GP Ibα, GP Ibβ, and GP IX as described previously (21Meyer S.C. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14693-14699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In some experiments, as indicated below, a cDNA coding for a truncated form of GP Ibα that cannot interact with ABP was used. The truncated form was generated by introducing a stop codon at position 545 of the cytoplasmic domain of GP Ibα (17Cunningham J.G. Meyer S.C. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In other experiments, the ABP-deficient cells were transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate method (22Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar) with the cDNA coding for full-length or truncated forms of ABP. The transfection efficiencies obtained with this method ranged from 30 to 80%. Full-length ABP inserted into pCDM8 (pCDM8-ABP) (23Seed B. Nature. 1987; 329: 840-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. C. Cunningham. A truncated form (ABP-(1–2099)) that lacks only the carboxyl-terminal 548 amino acids has been previously described (19Meyer S.C. Zuerbig S. Cunningham C.C. Hartwig J.H. Bissell T. Gardner K.

A 1.5-kilobase pair DNA fragment (nucleotides 6581–8116) coding for only the carboxyl-terminal end of ABP (ABP-(2136–2647)) was generated by polymerase chain reaction and inserted into pCDM8. The primers used to amplify the fragment corresponded to nucleotides 6581–6601 preceded by an ATG sequence and to nucleotides 8093–8116. The sequences were verified by DNA sequencing analysis. Cells were stained with a monoclonal antibody against GP Ibα (mAb Ib-23; generously provided by Dr. B. Steiner, Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland) (24Meyer S. Kresbach G. Haring P.

Cells were allowed to settle for 16 h onto glass slides, fixed, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma), and stained as described previously (21Meyer S.C. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol.

In some experiments, actin filaments were stained with 2 μg/ml tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-labeled phalloidin (Sigma). Fluorescence microscopy was performed with an inverted microscope (DIAPHOT-TMD, Nikon). Confocal microscopy images were collected with a Leica TCS-NT laser scanning confocal microscope. Images were collected through the cells at a step size of ∼0.3 μm. To assess the ability of the melanoma cells to extend membrane projections and to spread, cells were plated on 60-mm tissue culture dishes and were examined after 24 h under a phase-contrast microscope (Olympus CK2). The cells were plated on 60-mm tissue culture dishes. After 24 h, cells were fixed for 1 h in pyridoxal phosphate fixative containing 4% paraformaldehyde, 75 mm lysine, 10 mm sodiummeta-periodate, and 37.5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4 (27McLean I.W. Nakane P.K. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1974; 22: 1077-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (3200) Google Scholar). The samples were stained with 2 μg/ml mAb Ib-23, washed, and incubated with a 1:20 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies conjugated with 10-nm gold particles (Amersham International). Samples were washed, fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, processed for thin section electron microscopy, and examined in a JEM 100 CX II microscope (Jeol Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) (28Fox J.E.B. Boyles J.K. Berndt M.C. Steffen P.K. Anderson L.K. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1525-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). For detection of GP Ib-IX or ABP in transfected cells, cells were solubilized in an SDS-containing buffer, and solubilized proteins were electrophoresed through SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. GP Ibα was detected with mAb Ib-4 (generously provided by Dr. B. Steiner) (24Meyer S. Kresbach G. Haring P. Schumpp-Vonach B. Clemetson K.J. Hadvary P. Steiner B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20555-20562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and ABP was detected with either mAb ABP-4 or an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody raised against purified full-length ABP. Antigen-antibody complexes were detected by chemiluminescence (Amersham International). The intensity of the bands was quantitated by densitometry on a Macintosh computer using NIH Image software. Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed as described previously (19Meyer S.C. Zuerbig S. Cunningham C.C. Hartwig J.H. Bissell T. Gardner K. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2914-2919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To determine whether ABP is important in allowing a receptor with which it interacts to be expressed in the membrane, the three cDNAs encoding GP Ibα, GP Ibβ, and GP IX were transfected into ABP-deficient melanoma cells and into cells that had been stably transfected with the cDNA encoding ABP (13Cunningham C.C. Gorlin J.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Byers H.R. Stossel T.P. Science. 1992; 255: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Even in the absence of ABP, GP Ib-IX was expressed on the cell surface (Fig. 1 A). However, the amount of GP Ib-IX expressed on the surface of the ABP-deficient cells was significantly lower than on the surface of the ABP-containing cells (compare dashed and solid lines). In five different experiments, the mean fluorescence obtained with the ABP-deficient cells was 7–12-fold lower than with the ABP-containing cells. Western blot analysis (Fig. 1 B) revealed that although there was less GP Ibα expressed in the melanoma cells in the absence of ABP than in its presence, it did not account for the 7–12-fold difference in the membrane (in five independent experiments, the total amount of GP Ibα expressed in the ABP-deficient cells was 1.4–3-fold lower than in the ABP-containing cells). Examination of fixed permeabilized cells by confocal microscopy showed that in the ABP-deficient cells, most of the GP Ibα was found intracellularly, and little was on the cell surface (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, in the ABP-containing cells, the majority of the GP Ibα was present on the cell surface (Fig. 2 B). There was no evidence of increased loss of GP Ibα in the cell culture medium in either case (data not shown). To determine whether the increased insertion of GP Ib-IX into the membrane of ABP-containing cells was a direct consequence of the presence of ABP, the ABP-deficient cells expressing GP Ib-IX were transiently transfected with the cDNA encoding ABP and analyzed 48 h later. Flow cytometry analysis showed that transient expression of ABP increased the amount of GP Ibαincorporated into the membrane (Fig. 3 A). In four separate experiments, the amount of GP Ib-IX incorporated into the membrane was increased 4–11-fold. However, expression of ABP had little effect on the total amount of GP Ib-IX expressed in the cells (Fig. 3 B, compare lanes 1 and 2). Transfection of the vector alone did not increase the surface expression of GP Ib-IX (data not shown). To determine whether the increased insertion of GP Ib-IX into the membrane of ABP-containing cells resulted from association of GP Ib-IX with the cytoskeleton, we used cells that contained ABP and stably transfected them with either full-length GP Ib-IX complex or GP Ib-IX complex containing a truncated form of GP Ibα that lacked the domain that interacts with ABP (17Cunningham J.G. Meyer S.C. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The truncated GP Ibα has been characterized previously and shown to be incapable of interacting with ABP (17Cunningham J.G. Meyer S.C. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of total cell lysates showed the presence of similar amounts of GP Ib-IX in cells transfected with truncated or full-length GP Ibα(Fig. 4 B, compare lanes 2 and 3; a difference in mobility is not detected on the 7.5% SDS gel because the molecular mass only changes from 135 to 129 kDa (17Cunningham J.G. Meyer S.C. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar)). In four independent experiments, there was 1.1-fold (S.D. = 0.1) more GP Ib-IX in the cells expressing full-length GP Ibα than in those expressing truncated GP Ibα. FACS analysis (Fig. 4 A) showed that truncated GP Ib-IX (dashed line) was inserted into the cell membrane almost as efficiently as full-length GP Ibα(solid line). In five experiments, the mean of fluorescence in the cells expressing full-length GP Ibα was 1.4–1.7-fold higher than in the cells expressing truncated GP Ibα. The finding that truncated GP Ib-IX was efficiently expressed in the membrane suggested that while the presence of ABP is important in allowing insertion of GP Ib-IX into the membrane, the association between the proteins is not. Previously, we have shown that the binding site for GP Ibα is located between amino acids 1850 and 2136 and that deletion of residues 2099–2136 abolishes the binding to GP Ib-IX (19Meyer S.C. Zuerbig S. Cunningham C.C. Hartwig J.H. Bissell T. Gardner K. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2914-2919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, as a further test of the possibility that interaction of GP Ib-IX with actin-binding protein is not the reason for the increased surface expression of GP Ib-IX in ABP-containing cells, we expressed a truncated ABP (ABP-(1–2099)) that does not interact with GP Ib-IX in ABP-deficient cells expressing GP Ib-IX. Analysis of the transfected cells confirmed that the protein was expressed and that it had the appropriate molecular mass (Fig. 5 B, left inset, compare lanes 2 and 3). The amount of truncated ABP expressed in the transiently transfected cells was comparable to the amount of full-length ABP expressed in the permanently transfected cell line used for the experiments shown in Figs. 1 and 2 (Fig. 5 B, left inset, compare lanes 2 and 3). Flow cytometry analysis showed that the presence of the truncated form of ABP (ABP-(1–2099)) induced a 6–7-fold increase in the amount of GP Ib-IX present on the cell surface (Fig. 5 B). Similar increases were seen in three independent experiments. However, there was little difference in the total amount of GP Ib-IX expressed in the cells (Fig. 5 B, right inset). Transfection of a construct encoding only the carboxyl-terminal end of ABP (ABP-(2136–2647)) did not increase the surface expression of GP Ib-IX (Fig. 5 C). When the distribution of the truncated form of ABP was examined by immunofluorescence and compared with that of full-length ABP in the stably transfected cells, no difference could be detected. Thus, both full-length ABP (Fig. 6 A) and the truncated form of ABP (Fig. 6 C) colocalized with actin filaments and were concentrated toward the periphery of the cell (Fig. 6, B and D). To determine if the cell-surface expression of proteins normally present in melanoma cells was regulated by actin-binding protein, we compared the amount of β1integrin inserted into the plasma membrane of ABP-deficient and ABP-containing cells. As shown by flow cytometry (Fig. 7), β1 integrin was incorporated into the membrane of the ABP-deficient cells (dashed line). However, the amount of β1 integrin present on the surface of the ABP-containing cells (solid line) was markedly increased (in three experiments, the mean of fluorescence in the ABP-containing cells was 3–4.5-fold higher than in the ABP-deficient cells). The increased insertion of endogenous integrin in the ABP-containing cells did not appear to result from an interaction with ABP since we were unable to immunoprecipitate β1integrin with an antibody against actin-binding protein (Fig. 8) or to immunoprecipitate actin-binding protein with an anti-β1 integrin antibody (data not shown).Figure 8β1 integrin does not co-immunoprecipitate with actin-binding protein. Cells were lysed in a Triton X-100-containing lysis buffer that induced depolymerization of the cytoskeleton. Actin-binding protein was immunoprecipitated, electrophoresed through an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were probed with a monoclonal antibody against β1 integrin (left panel) or against ABP (right panel). Lanes 1, cell lysate (8-fold fewer cells than the amount used in the immunoprecipitations); lanes 2, ABP-containing cell lysate immunoprecipitated with mouse IgG;lanes 3, ABP-containing cell lysate immunoprecipitated with anti-ABP antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Previously, others have shown that the ABP-deficient cells are covered with large blebs and do not spread well, whereas the stably transfected cells do not bleb and are able to extend membrane projections and to spread (13Cunningham C.C. Gorlin J.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Byers H.R. Stossel T.P. Science. 1992; 255: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). To examine the effects of ABP on the membrane surface in more detail, thin sections of the two cell lines were examined by electron microscopy. While blebs could be seen by electron microscopy (for example, in Fig. 9 A, two blebs can be seen in the right-hand half of the portion of membrane shown), the most striking feature of the membrane was the smoothness of the surface (Fig. 9 A). In contrast, the surface of the ABP-containing cells not only lacked blebs, but was covered with projections, indicative of a much more motile cell and of the restored ability of the cells to induce the cytoskeletal reorganizations and membrane reorganizations needed for migration (Fig. 9 B). The samples shown in Fig. 9 were immunolabeled with GP Ib-IX antibodies followed by gold-conjugated secondary antibodies. The density of gold label on the membranes confirmed that very little GP Ib-IX was expressed in the membrane when ABP was missing (Fig. 9 A), whereas the amount in the membrane was markedly increased when ABP was present. Moreover, it showed that the microprocesses present in the ABP-containing cells contained considerable amounts of GP Ib-IX (Fig. 9 B). In both cell lines, GP Ib-IX appeared to be randomly distributed: there was no evidence of clustering. The carboxyl-terminal end of ABP contains not only the GP Ib-IX-binding site, but also the dimerization site (2Weihing R.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1865-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 3Gorlin J.B. Yamin R. Egan S. Stewart M. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1089-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). So truncated ABP lacking the carboxyl-terminal 548 residues cannot directly cross-link actin. If the importance of ABP is in directly cross-linking the submembranous cytoskeleton, we predicted that expression of the truncated form of ABP in the ABP-deficient cells would not restore the ability of the cells to extend membrane projections and to spread. In contrast, since the truncated form increased the expression of GP Ib-IX in the membrane, we predicted that if the importance of ABP was in allowing appropriate reorganization of the membrane, the truncated form would result in normal morphology and spreading. Thus, to gain insight into the mechanism by which ABP exerts its effects, cells were transiently transfected with either full-length or truncated forms of ABP, allowed to spread on tissue culture plates for 24 h, and examined by phase-contrast microscopy. As described previously (13Cunningham C.C. Gorlin J.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Byers H.R. Stossel T.P. Science. 1992; 255: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) and shown in Fig. 10 A, phase-contrast microscopy revealed blebs all over the surface of the ABP-deficient cells; moreover, the cells remained rounded and were unable to spread. Similar morphologies were observed with cells transfected with the vector only (Fig. 10 B) or the cDNA encoding only the carboxyl-terminal 511 amino acids (ABP-(2136–2647)) (Fig. 10 C). In contrast, cells expressing the truncated form of ABP lacking only the carboxyl-terminal 548 amino acids (ABP-(1–2099)) (Fig. 10 D) had few blebs and were able to extend projections and to spread. The appearance of the transfected cells was very similar to that of cells transfected with full-length ABP (Fig. 10 E). Actin-binding protein plays an important role in regulating cell morphology and motility (13Cunningham C.C. Gorlin J.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Byers H.R. Stossel T.P.

Immunol. 1995; 154: 3461-3470PubMed Google Scholar), but the functional importance of such interactions is not known. In this report, we describe a previously unrecognized function of ABP. Using an ABP-deficient cell line, we show that ABP regulates the expression of adhesion receptors in the membrane. ABP increases the surface expression of receptors by a mechanism that does not involve direct interaction with the receptors, does not appear to involve direct cross-linking of actin filaments, and correlates with restoration of the ability of cells to extend projections and to spread. The conclusion that ABP regulates the composition of the plasma membrane came from the study of two membrane receptors, the endogenous β1 integrin subunit and expressed GP Ib-IX complex. Both receptors were inserted into the membrane of an ABP-deficient melanoma cell line. However, the amount of GP Ib-IX and β1integrin incorporated into the membrane increased as much as 12-fold when ABP cDNA was transfected into the cells. Several lines of evidence indicated that the increased expression of adhesion receptors resulted from some function of ABP other than its interaction with receptor. Thus, although there has been a report that ABP interacts with β2-containing integrins (12Sharma C.P. Ezzell R.M. Arnaout M.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 3461-3470PubMed Google Scholar), under our experimental conditions, we were unable to detect an interaction between β1 integrin and ABP. Furthermore, by studying GP Ib-IX, a platelet adhesion receptor that interacts with ABP by a well characterized mechanism (4Solum N.O. Olsen T.M. Gogstad G.O. Hagen I. Brosstad F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 729: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 5Fox J.E.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 1673-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 6Fox J.E.B. J. Biol.

Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18605-18611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we were able to demonstrate that GP Ib-IX lacking the region in the cytoplasmic domain that interacts with ABP also showed increased expression in the ABP-containing cells. Finally, a truncated form of ABP lacking the region that interacts with GP Ib-IX was just as effective as full-length ABP in increasing the expression of GP Ib-IX in the membrane of the cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that the importance of ABP is not in attaching to a receptor and anchoring it in the membrane, but rather in maintaining a more general organization of the submembranous region that allows the appropriate protein composition of the membrane to be maintained. The increased expression of adhesion receptors in the ABP-containing cells could conceivably occur because ABP must be present in the submembranous cytoskeleton for membrane vesicles to be efficiently inserted into the plasma membrane. Alternatively, in the absence of submembranous ABP, membrane receptors might be inserted normally, but subsequently removed from the membrane more rapidly than in the ABP-containing cells. In considering the mechanism by which ABP exerts its effects, it is of interest that ABP induces not only an altered expression of membrane receptors, but also a marked difference in the ability of the cell to extend projections and to spread. To extend projections and to spread, cells must reorganize both the cytoskeleton and the membrane at specific locations. There are no indications of marked differences in the cytoskeleton of the ABP-deficient cells compared with the ABP-containing cells. For example, the amounts of gelsolin, α-actinin, profilin, and fodrin are similar in the two cases (13Cunningham C.C. Gorlin J.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Byers H.R. Stossel T.P. Science. 1992; 255: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Moreover, the total actin content is the same, and at least until the ABP-containing cells have spread, there is not a detectable difference in the amount of actin that is polymerized into filaments in the two cell lines (29Cunningham C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1589-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). This study shows that whatever the mechanism by which ABP exerts its effects, it is induced equally well by full-length ABP and ABP that cannot bind to GP Ib-IX because it lacks the carboxyl-terminal 548 amino acids. The truncated form of ABP contains its actin-binding domain, and immunofluorescence microscopy indicated that it interacted with submembranous actin. Because the dimerization site is in the carboxyl-terminal end, it appears unlikely that truncated ABP could directly cross-link actin filaments, although we cannot exclude the possibility that it can do this by other unidentified mechanisms in the intact cell. It is also conceivable that truncated ABP could regulate the organization of the submembranous network of cytoskeleton proteins through a mechanism that does not require it to dimerize. Another possibility is that the truncated form of ABP interacts with unidentified membrane proteins that play a role in maintaining the membrane such that GP Ib-IX and β1 integrin expression in the membrane can be regulated appropriately. It is also becoming apparent that the membrane skeleton of cells can bind a variety of signaling molecules including pp60c-src (30Fox J.E.B. Lipfert L. Clark E.A. Reynolds C.C. Austin C.D.

Chem. 1992; 267: 4686-4692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), so yet another possibility is that ABP is required to maintain the appropriate submembranous location of such molecules. It is conceivable that by regulating actin polymerization, organization of the cytoskeleton, or generation of lipid products, signaling molecules could maintain the organization of the membrane or of the submembranous cytoskeleton. Such an organization could be essential for appropriate insertion or removal of membrane proteins, maintenance of cell morphology, or effective function of signal transduction mechanisms involved in membrane projection extension and cell spreading. This study was performed in a melanoma cell line. However, ABP is present in a large variety of cell types, and it appears probable that it could play an important role in regulating the insertion of membrane proteins and the properties of the membrane in these cells also. ABP is a component of a submembranous skeleton, so conceivably, defects in additional proteins in this skeleton could have similar effects on the composition and function of cell membranes. There are several examples of cytoskeletal proteins whose absence results in decreased expression of a membrane protein with which they normally interact. For example, human erythrocytes deficient in protein 4.1 have a decreased content of glycophorin C (34Alloisio N. Morle L. Bachir D. Guetarni D. Colonna P. Delaunay J. Biochim. Biophys.

Another well characterized interaction of a cytoskeletal protein with a plasma membrane glycoprotein complex is that of dystrophin with the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex (for review, see Refs. 43Matsumura K.

The absence of dystrophin causes all the dystrophin-associated proteins to be drastically reduced (45Ohlendieck K. Campbell K.P. J.

With these examples, it is assumed that the absence of the membrane glycoproteins results from the absence of the cytoskeletal protein with which their cytoplasmic domain interacts. However, the absence of these proteins causes additional changes in membrane stability, ion fluxes, or integrity. This study raises the possibility that the absence of the cytoskeletal proteins may cause a more generalized abnormality in the submembranous region that in turn affects the expression of membrane glycoproteins. Future studies will be needed to determine whether, like ABP, other submembranous cytoskeletal proteins play a primary role in maintaining membrane properties or directed migration such that the appropriate expression of membrane glycoproteins can be achieved.

We found granulocyte chromatin to remain insoluble after nuclease digestion and to be resistant to swelling in low salt/high pH media. Both insolubility and resistance to swelling were lost after washing with 0.3 m NaCl, a procedure that released two abundant tissue-specific proteins from granulocyte nuclei. One of them (42 kDa) is identified as MENT, a protein previously shown to be associated with repressed chromatin from mature chicken erythrocytes. We show that MENT is immunolocalized in granulocyte heterochromatin, where it is one of the most abundant chromatin proteins (∼2 molecules/200 base pairs of DNA). MENT is the first nuclear protein structurally related to the serine protease inhibitor family. The other abundant protein is similar to or identical with mim-1, a myeloid-specific protein that is known to be stored in cell granules and to associate with isolated nuclei. MENT (but not mim-1) binds chromatin and free DNA, and, at its physiological protein/DNA ratio, enhances compaction and the reversible Mg2+-dependent self-association of nucleosome arrays. MENT appears to promote the formation of heterochromatin by acting as a “glue” within and between chains of nucleosomes.

MENT appears to promote the formation of heterochromatin by acting as a “glue” within and between chains of nucleosomes. In eukaryotic chromosomes, the DNA double helix is folded by proteins in a hierarchical manner. At the basic folding level, DNA periodically makes superhelical turns around an octamer of histones, generating repeating nucleoprotein particles called nucleosomes. The x-ray structure of a synthetic nucleosome core particle at 2.8-Å resolution has recently been reported (1Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6991) Google Scholar). All nucleosomes contain four pairs of evolutionarily conserved core histones, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. In addition to the core histone octamer, nucleosomes generally contain a ninth basic protein, histone H1, also called linker histone. Linker histones are required for nucleosome chains to form the next level of chromatin folding, the 30-nm chromatin fiber (2van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1989Crossref Google Scholar, 3Wolffe A.P. Chromatin Structure and Function. Academic Press, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar, 4van Holde K.E. Zlatanova J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10548-10555Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Genetic inactivation of many chromosomal loci in eukaryotic cells is correlated with a tighter compaction of chromatin, forming what is often referred to as heterochromatin (5Lohe A.R. Hilliker A.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 746-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Recent genetic studies have revealed a complexity of protein factors that are potentially involved in heterochromatin formation in multicellular eukaryotes (6Reuter G. Spierer P. BioEssays. 1992; 14: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 7Elgin S.C.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). However, neither the mechanism of heterochromatin formation nor the proteins directly involved in this level of chromatin condensation are presently known. The extent of chromatin condensation increases during cell differentiation, reaching its maximum in terminally differentiated quiescent cells where it often involves the bulk of interphase chromatin. This is typified by vertebrate blood cells, which provide a convenient experimental system to investigate the mechanism(s) of chromatin condensation by both biochemical and cytological approaches. Since chromatin condensation and general decrease in transcription in mature vertebrate tissues are often correlated with the appearance and accumulation of tissue-specific histone H1 subtypes (for reviews, see Refs. 8Weintraub H. Cell. 1985; 42: 705-711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 9Cole R.D. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1987; 30: 433-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 10Zlatanova J. van Holde K. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 889-895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these proteins have long been considered one of the key factors in differentiation stage-specific chromatin condensation and gene repression. However, gene regulation studies in cells either overexpressing or lacking certain types of histone H1 have greatly undermined the concept that linker histones act as general chromatin repressors (11Sun J.-M. Wiaderkiewicz R. Ruiz-Carrillo A. Science. 1989; 245: 68-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 12Sirotkin A.M. Edelmann W. Cheng G. Klein-Szanto A. Kucherlapati R. Skoultchi A. Proc. Natl.

Gigot C. Spiker S. Jerzmanovski A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10250-10255Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It may now be concluded that the accumulation of linker histones per se is not sufficient to cause a major chromatin remodeling or a general inhibition of transcription in vivo and that additional factors must be involved in priming chromatin condensation. It also remains to be determined whether linker histone concentration is increased in all cases where extensive heterochromatin formation occurs. Previously, we observed that, in addition to the erythrocyte-specific linker histone H5, the condensed and repressed chromatin from terminally differentiated chicken erythrocytes contained a 42-kDa polypeptide that was absent from the active chromatin fraction (16Grigoryev S.A. Solovieva V.O. Spirin K.S. Krasheninnikov I.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 198: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This protein, which was also abundant in polymorphonuclear granulocytes, was designated as MENT (myeloid anderythroid nuclear termination stage-specific protein). In both types of blood cell, MENT was located exclusively inside the nuclei, forming a number of foci in erythrocytes and a dense layer at the periphery of granulocyte nuclei (17Grigoryev S.A. Woodcock C.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 206: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Granulocyte chromatin is highly condensed and forms a dense heterochromatic layer at the nuclear periphery (18Davis H.G. Haynes M.E. J. Cell Sci. 1975; 17: 263-285PubMed Google Scholar, 19Edwards S.W. Biochemistry and Physiology of the Neutrophil. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1994Crossref Google Scholar, 20Rowley A.F. Ratcliffe N.A. Vertebrate Blood Cells. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1988: 257-336Google Scholar). Since chicken granulocytes give a very strong immunofluorescent reaction with anti-MENT antibodies, it seemed likely that the extensive heterochromatization in these cells might be associated with a high level of MENT accumulation. Here we report the purification of chicken granulocytes, isolation of their nuclei, and an analysis of granulocyte chromatin organization. Despite extensive heterochromatization, granulocyte nuclei contain no more linker histone than is normally found within chromatin of actively proliferating cells, including undifferentiated promyelocytic precursors. However, granulocyte heterochromatin accumulates a large amount of MENT, sufficient to induce substantial compaction of both nuclear chromatin and soluble polynucleosomes in vitro. In addition, granulocyte nuclei are greatly enriched with another myeloid-specific protein, mim-1, which is normally found within heterophil granules (21Ness S.A. Marknell A. Graf T. Cell. 1989; 59: 1115-1125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 22Yamada K. Tsuchia M. Mishima K. Shimoyama M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 311: 203-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Based on our studies of the interaction of purified MENT and mim-1 proteins with DNA and chromatin in vitro, we argue that it is the hyperaccumulation of MENT in chicken granulocyte nuclei that induces and maintains the high level of chromatin condensation in vivo. Chromatin remodeling during terminal differentiation in granulocytes thus may require only one major additional chromosomal protein (MENT). Fresh chicken blood was purchased from Pel-Freez (Rogers, AR) and used within 24 h of exsanguination. Erythrocytes were obtained from blood of adult chicken or from 19-day-old chicken embryos by centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min. in the presence of 2% sodium citrate and washing three times with PBS 1The abbreviations used are: PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RSB, reticulocyte standard buffer; TE buffer, Tris-EDTA buffer; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; LS, low salt medium; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s). medium (0.14m NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4, 1.7 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.5) plus 1% sodium citrate. The upper layers (buffy coats) were removed after each centrifugation and either discarded or used for isolation of white blood cells. The bottom layer containing pure erythrocytes was used for nuclear isolation. To fractionate chicken blood cells, 200 ml of whole blood containing 2% sodium citrate was centrifuged for 5 min at 800 ×g, and the buffy coats enriched with leukocytes were removed, resuspended in PBS with 1% sodium citrate, centrifuged as above, and again separated from the bottom erythrocyte layer. The leukocyte-enriched material was applied to a 40-ml gradient of 60% Percoll containing PBS. The Percoll gradient was prepared 2 h before the experiment by the mixing of 24 ml of stock Percoll suspension (density 1.128 g/ml, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) with 16 ml of 2.5 × PBS in a 50-ml centrifuge tube and by centrifugation of the resulting mixture at 20 °C for 30 min at 23,400 × gin a SS34 rotor (Sorvall, Boston, MA). The leukocyte-enriched material was loaded on the preformed gradient and centrifuged at 1000 ×g for 20 min at room temperature. At the end of the centrifugation, five distinct zones were obtained (Fig. 1, left). The cell fractions corresponding to each zone were taken from the gradient, resuspended in 40 ml of PBS, centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min, and finally resuspended in 2 ml of PBS. Smears of the cell fractions were analyzed under a light microscope. Zone I contained thrombocytes and many cell aggregates; zone II contained predominantly lymphocytes; zone III was a mixture of different mononuclear white blood cells; zone IV contained a highly enriched granulocyte population; and zone V contained the residual erythrocytes (see Fig. 1). Cell nuclei were isolated from chicken erythrocytes as described (16Grigoryev S.A. Solovieva V.O. Spirin K.S. Krasheninnikov I.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 198: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and stored in RSB (10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) containing 50% glycerol at −20 °C. To isolate the leukocyte nuclei, the suspensions of lymphocytes (gradient zone II) and of granulocytes (gradient zone IV) in PBS were centrifuged for 3 min at 1000 × g and resuspended in 0.5% Nonidet P-40 in RSB with 1 mm PMSF at 2 °C. The cell suspensions were homogenized by 20–30 strokes of pestle A in a Dounce homogenizer over 30 min on ice. Nuclei were centrifuged for 10 min at 7600 × g, and the nuclear pellets were resuspended in RSB plus 1 mm PMSF. Nuclei could be stored for 1 week at 2 °C without a detectable DNA or protein degradation. For micrococcal nuclease digestion, an aliquot of the nuclear preparation (A260 = 20) was resuspended in 5 ml of RSB containing 0.5 mm PMSF. CaCl2 was added to give a final concentration of 1 mm, micrococcal nuclease (Boehringer Mannheim) was added at 3–30 units/ml depending on the nature of the nuclei and the desired extent of digestion, and the reaction was carried out at 37 °C . To obtain soluble chicken erythrocyte chromatin (mean number of nucleosomes in a chain, n = 6) the reaction used 5 units of enzyme/ml and was terminated after 10 min by adding 0.5 ml of 0.1 m Na-EDTA and 5 ml of ice-cold TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.6). The digested nuclei were pelleted for 10 min at 12,000 × g. The supernatant (A260 = 50) was loaded onto a 5–25% sucrose gradient containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and centrifuged for 22 h at 60,000 × g in a SW-27 rotor (Beckman). The gradient fraction containing chains of 6 ± 1 nucleosomes was collected and dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. Protein electrophoresis in 16% polyacrylamide gels was carried out as described (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Soluble chromatin and nuclear samples were boiled in SDS-containing sample buffer and applied without separation of DNA and proteins. After electrophoresis, the gels were either stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 (Sigma) or electrotransferred in Tris-glycine buffer containing 10% methanol to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon P, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) as described by Harlow and Lane (24Harlow E.

The filters were blocked, treated with anti-MENT antibodies (dilution 1:5000) or with anti-H1 antibodies (dilution 1:100), and then treated with secondary peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies and detected with the ECL detection system (Amersham Corp.) as described in the vendor's manual. Rabbit anti-MENT antibodies were obtained and purified on a Protein A-Sepharose column as described (17Grigoryev S.A. Woodcock C.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 206: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Rabbit antibodies raised against calf thymus histone H1 (25Di Padua-Mathieu D. Mura C.V. Frado L.-L.Y. Woodcock C.L. Stollar B.D. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. C. Mura and were incubated with an excess of membrane-attached mim-1 protein to reduce the cross-reaction with mim-1. Rabbit antibodies against mim-1 were kindly provided by Dr. S. Ness. For quantitation of the proteins in the nuclear samples, the serial dilutions of purified proteins with known concentrations were electrophoresed on the same gels. The Coomassie-stained gels or the autoradiographs after the ECL detection were digitized, and the intensity of protein bands was quantitated using the NIH Image software package. Calibration curves were made by plotting the intensities of control protein bands against samples of known concentration and used to estimate the concentration of unknown samples. Protein/DNA ratios were estimated from parallel measurements of DNA concentration by UV spectrophotometry (A260 = 1 for 50 μg/ml DNA). All preparative procedures in this section were conducted at 2 °C, and all solutions contained 0.5 mm PMSF as a protease inhibitor. Core histones (an equimolar mixture of H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) were isolated from adult chicken erythrocyte nuclei by 2 m NaCl treatment essentially as described by Von Holt et al. (26Von Holt C. Brandt W.F. Greyling H.J. Lindsey G.G. Retief J.D. de Rodrigues A. Schwager S. Sewell B.T. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 431-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and stored in 2 m NaCl at −70 °C. To isolate histone H5, chicken erythrocyte nuclei were first washed in 0.35 m NaCl and pelleted at 1460 × g for 5 min to remove the loosely bound nonhistone proteins (the 0.35 m NaCl extract). To remove histone H1, the nuclear pellet was resuspended in 0.55m NaCl and centrifuged in an SS-34 rotor at 27,000 ×g for 30 min. The pellet was washed in 0.55 mNaCl, centrifuged again for 10 min at 27,000 × g, and finally solubilized in 0.65 m NaCl. DNA and core histones were removed by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 16 h (Ti-70 rotor, Beckman, Palo Alto, CA). The 0.65 mNaCl supernatant containing more than 95% pure histone H5 was stored at −70 °C. Histone concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically (A230 = 2.3 for 1 mg/ml histone H5). A plasmid vector pAT153 containing the ∼1.2-kilobase pair hexamer tandem repeat of a 198-bp fragment of Lytechinus variegatus5 S rDNA was obtained from Dr. R. Simpson (27Simpson R.T. Stafford D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Plasmids were isolated from 2-liter cultures of Escherichia coli by an alkaline lysis method (28Birnboim H.C. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 100: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids were additionally purified by treatment with phenol/chloroform and ethanol precipitation. The isolated plasmids were treated with the restriction endonuclease, HhaI, which excises the tandemly repeated 5 S rDNA insert from the plasmid vector. The 1.2-kilobase pair-long insert was purified by gel-filtration on a Sephacryl S-500 (Pharmacia) column as described (29Hansen J.C. Rickett H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To reconstitute oligonucleosomes, the 1.2-kilobase pair-long fragment (10 μg) was mixed with 1.05 mol of histone octamer/198 bp of DNA in 2 m NaCl and dialyzed for 16 h, during which the concentration of NaCl was gradually decreased to 0.5 m(30Meersseman G. Pennings S. Bradbury E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Nonbound histone was removed by repeatedly concentrating the reconstitutes using a 100-kDa filtration membrane (Microcon-100, Amicon, Beverly, MA). Finally, the reconstitutes were dialyzed overnight against 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mmNaCl. For H5-containing reconstitutes, a 50-μl portion of the washed sample in 0.5 m NaCl was mixed with 1 mol of histone H5/1 mol of octamer in 0.65 m NaCl, and the mixture was dialyzed overnight against 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mmNaCl. Nuclease digestion mapping, DNA labeling, and analysis in denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were conducted as described by Meersseman et al. (30Meersseman G. Pennings S. Bradbury E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). DNA electrophoresis in agarose gels (Sigma, type I) was conducted in Tris acetate buffer (31Loening U.E. Biochem. J. 1967; 102: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar). Electrophoreses of DNP (DNA-protein complexes) were run in 1% agarose (Sigma, type IV) in 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 0.1 mmEDTA. MENT and mim-1 proteins were isolated from nuclei obtained from unfractionated “buffy coat” cells collected from the top of chicken blood pellets as described above. Nuclei were suspended in RSB plus 0.5 mm PMSF at A260 = 200, and an equal volume of RSB containing 0.7 m NaCl was added to make the final NaCl concentration 0.35 m. After mixing for 30 min on ice, the nuclear suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 23,400 × g (Sorvall SS-34). The supernatant was taken, dialyzed against 0.2 m NaCl, 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.6, and applied to an S-Sepharose FF ion exchange column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with 0.2 m NaCl, 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.6. Proteins were eluted with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, in a 0.2–1.0 m NaCl gradient. Peaks containing MENT and mim-1 polypeptides were collected, dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, containing either 0.05 m NaCl (for MENT) or 0.2 m NaCl (for mim-1), and repurified on the S-Sepharose FF column as above. The protein concentration was estimated by Bradford's method (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), calibrated by a quantitative amino acid analysis. For protein peptide microsequencing, 200 pmol of MENT was electrophoresed and electrotransferred as described above to a Problot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Applied Biosystems) and subjected to amino acid analysis, peptide separation, mass spectrometry, and amino acid microsequencing (Harvard Microchemistry Facility, Cambridge MA). For mim-1 microsequencing, 40 μl of 1 mg/ml column-purified protein was treated for 30 min at 37 °C with 0.2 mg/ml trypsin (Sigma; 10,000 benzoyl-l-arginine ethyl ester units/mg), electrophoresed, and transferred on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The major polypeptide bands were excised and microsequenced (Columbia University Protein Chemistry Facility, New York, NY). For nuclear reconstitution experiments, 0.1 ml of nuclear suspension (0.25 mg/ml DNA) was mixed with 32 μl of 0.25 mg/ml MENT (1 mol of MENT/nucleosome) or with 28 μl of 1 mg/ml mim-1 (4.5 mol of protein/nucleosome) in RSB containing 0.2 mNaCl and 1 mm PMSF and stirred at 4 °C for 2 h, during which the samples were gradually diluted five times with RSB. The nuclei were then centrifuged for 3 min at 1000 × g and resuspended in 0.1 ml of RSB. For binding studies with naked sea urchin 5 S DNA (1.2 kb) and reconstituted nucleosome hexamers, 30 μl of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing various concentrations of MENT or mim-1 were mixed with 0.1 ml of native oligonucleosome preparation (0.1 mg/ml DNA) in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2 and dialyzed against 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. Reactions with soluble native oligonucleosomes were conducted similarly, but MgCl2 was omitted from the reaction buffer. No dialysis was performed before loading on agarose gels. For light microscopy, smears of whole blood or of Percoll gradient-fractionated cells were fixed and stained with the Leukostat blood staining kit (Fisher). Unfixed nuclear suspensions in appropriate buffers were stained with 10 μg/ml DAPI (Sigma) and examined with a Nikon Optiphot microscope equipped with epifluorescence and differential interference contrast optics. For immunogold labeling, a preparation of chicken granulocytes was fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at 20 °C and 1 h on ice. Fixed cells were embedded in Unicryl resin (33Scala C. Cenacchi G. Ferrari C. Pasquinelli G. Preda P. Manara G.C. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1992; 40: 1799-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) polymerized by UV irradiation. Ultrathin (80-nm) sections of the resin-embedded cells were obtained, mounted on electron microscopic grids, blocked, exposed to anti-MENT antibodies (Ref. 17Grigoryev S.A. Woodcock C.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 206: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar; optimal dilution, 1:200), and then exposed to gold-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (10-nm diameter gold particles, Sigma) as described by Erickson et al. (34Erickson P.A. Lewis G.P. Fisher S.K. Methods Cell Biol. 1993; 37: 283-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) with OsO4 poststaining for 1.5 min, uranyl acetate for 12 min, and lead citrate for 5 min. For electron microscopy of soluble chromatin, samples were fixed by adding 0.1% glutaraldehyde for at least 20 h at 2 °C, applied to glow-discharged thin carbon films, and stained with aqueous uranyl acetate or ethanolic phosphotungstic acid (35Woodcock C.L. Horowitz R.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1997; 53: 167-186Crossref Google Scholar). Samples were examined in a Philips CM10 electron microscope, and images were either recorded on a CCD camera (Gatan Inc.) or on film. To obtain a pure population of chicken granulocytes, we fractionated a leukocyte-enriched portion of the cells pelleted from chicken blood (“buffy coat”) on a gradient of 60% Percoll. Microscopic examination of stained cell smears from five distinct Percoll gradient cell zones showed that zone IV contained a 97% pure population of polymorphonuclear granulocytes, as judged by their characteristic nuclear morphology (Fig. 1). For immunolocalization of MENT, ultrathin sections of isolated granulocytes were treated with Protein A-Sepharose-purified anti-MENT antibodies (17Grigoryev S.A. Woodcock C.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 206: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) followed by gold-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. The immunogold label was abundant in the nuclei of all granulocyte cells examined and absent from other cell compartments (Fig. 2, top). No specific labeling was obtained when preimmune serum was used (Fig. 2, middle). At higher magnification, a strong preferential localization over the more electron-dense heterochromatin was apparent (Fig. 2, bottom). Nuclei were isolated from the preparations of erythrocytes and granulocytes. The morphology of the nuclear samples remained intact throughout the isolation, and the granulocyte nuclei frequently maintained their multilobed shape (Fig. 3, central top panel). Anti-MENT antibodies produced a strong immunofluorescence reaction with all nuclei having the granulocyte morphology, suggesting that MENT was present at a comparable level in all granulocytes. The control preimmune serum did not react with granulocyte nuclei (not shown). Typically, isolated nuclei swell and chromatin disperses when divalent cations are removed and the pH is raised above neutrality. For mature chicken erythrocytes, swelling starts in “physiological” phosphate buffer above pH 7.4 (36Coutelle C. Belkner J. Prehn S. Rosenthal S. David H. Dreher R. Exp. Cell. Res. 1974; 88: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and the nuclear diameter increases dramatically (Fig. 3, top left panel) in low salt media such as LS (1 mm Tris, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.5), a buffer used to spread nuclear chromatin for electron microscopy (37Labhart P. Thoma F. Koller T. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 25: 19-27PubMed Google Scholar). However, no morphological changes were observed when granulocyte nuclei were exposed to LS (Fig. 3, top central panel). Treatment of the granulocyte nuclei by 0.3 m NaCl, which elutes MENT from chromatin (17Grigoryev S.A. Woodcock C.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 206: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), did not alter their compactness, but upon transfer of 0.3 m NaCl-washed nuclei to LS, considerable swelling was observed (Fig. 3, top right panel), suggesting that factors removed by 0.3 m NaCl were responsible for the unusual resistance of the granulocyte nuclei to swelling. In an attempt to isolate soluble granulocyte chromatin, the purified nuclei were treated with micrococcal nuclease to produce DNA fragments averaging from 200 to 2000 bp. Granulocyte nuclei were much more protected from digestion than erythrocyte nuclei, about 5 times more enzyme being needed to achieve a comparable level of digestion in the former than in the latter. The nucleosome repeat produced by nuclease cutting of granulocyte nuclei (192 ± 2 bp) was about 20 bp shorter than in erythrocytes (compare lanes 13 and 14 on the DNA gel in Fig. 4). After micrococcal nuclease digestion, nuclear chromatin is typically solubilized when divalent cations are removed. This occurs even with highly condensed chicken erythrocyte nuclei (Fig. 3, bottom left panel). In contrast, granulocyte nuclei digested to contain mono- and oligonucleosomes (Fig. 4, lane 5, on DNA electrophoresis) did not release soluble chromatin even after repeated washing in TE buffer, followed by washing with LS. However, when the digested nuclei were exposed to 0.3 m NaCl after the low salt washes, most of the chromatin was released into solution. Pretreatment of intact granulocyte nuclei with 0.3 m NaCl resulted in an ∼4-fold increase in the subsequent micrococcal nuclease digestion rate without affecting the nucleosome repeat length and also led to chromatin solubilization of the nuclease-digested chromatin in TE buffer (Fig. 3, bottom right panel). The unprecedented insolubility of nuclease-digested granulocyte chromatin can thus be attributed to factor(s) released from nuclei by 0.3m NaCl. When nuclear proteins from chicken erythrocytes, lymphocytes, and granulocytes were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and stained with Coomassie dye, it was evident that granulocyte nuclei are strongly enriched in three polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 42, 41, and 30 kDa. The 42- and 30-kDa proteins are almost completely removed from the nuclei by treatment with 0.3 m salt (Fig. 5). Western blotting demonstrated that the 42-kDa protein was identical to MENT, which was also present in nuclei of all major blood cell types. Densitometry of the Western blots showed that granulocytes have a MENT/DNA ratio about 10-fold higher than lymphocytes and 8"

We defined two fibronectin-binding epitopes on 27 amino acids from 84 to 110 and on 20 amino acids from 211 to 230. The epitopes were almost conserved in the closely related Ag 85 complex of other mycobacteria species. Inhibition of fibronectin binding to intact α-Ag molecules was observed with peptide-(84–110), but not with peptide-(211–230). Peptide-(84–110) could also inhibit fibronectin binding to all components of the Ag 85 complex of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (Ag 85A, Ag 85B, and Ag 85C). Further study with synthetic peptides defined 11 residues from 98 to 108 as the minimum motif. Six residues (98FEWYYQ103) were critical for interacting with fibronectin. The motif revealed no homology to other known prokaryotic and eukaryotic fibronectin-binding proteins. The defined motif of α-Ag is novel and unique for mycobacteria.

The motif revealed no homology to other known prokaryotic and eukaryotic fibronectin-binding proteins. The defined motif of α-Ag is novel and unique for mycobacteria. In recent years, there has been a dramatic increase in mycobacterial disease even in some developed countries (1Snider D.J. Roper W.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 32: 703-705Crossref Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The incidence has been associated with an increase in the number of individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus-1 or patients whose immune systems have been compromised by immunosuppressive agents used to treat other diseases (2Wolinsky E. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1992; 15: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex and Mycobacterium kansasii are the most frequently isolated mycobacteria from AIDS patients (3Wayne L.G. Sramek H.A. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 5: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), and disseminated infection due to M. kansasiiis a well established feature of immunocompromised patients (4Shafer R.W. Sierra M.F. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1992; 15: 161-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 5Ratledge C. Stanford J. Grange J.M. The Biology of the Mycobacteria. 3. Academic Press Ltd., London1989: 511-564Google Scholar). Furthermore, M. kansasii has been implicated in pulmonary disease and has been reported as a cause of cutaneous infections and osteomyelitis (6Breathnach A. Levell N. Munro C. Natarajan S. Pedler S. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1995; 20: 812-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 7Weinroth S.E. Pincetl P. Tuazon C.U. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1994; 18: 261-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The elucidation of the mechanism of these infections and interactions with host immune systems is needed. We have been particularly interested in proteins secreted by mycobacteria. These proteins may play important roles not only in the establishment, progress, and continuation of the infection, but also in the host defense system since live mycobacteria can provoke protective immunity against tuberculosis, but killed organisms cannot (8Orme I.M.

The complex is characterized by the ability to bind to human fibronectin (FN) (9Janicki B.W. Chaparas S.D. Daniel T.M. Kubica G.P. Wright G.L. Yee G.S. Am. Rev. Respir.

It has been suggested that binding to FN may represent the first step in the attachment and entry of mycobacteria into host cells. α-Ag has been regarded as an important molecule for BCG-mediated antitumor activity in the treatment of superficial bladder carcinoma (23Abou-Zeid C. Ratliff T.L. Wiker H.G. Harboe M. Bennedsen J. Rook G.A. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 3046-3051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, this Ag is a stimulus for human monocytes to induce tumor necrosis factor-α and this stimulatory effect may be mediated through plasma FN (27Aung H. Toossi Z. Wisnieski J.J.

The novel motif required for FN binding and the contribution of the individual residues were investigated. BCG substrain Tokyo was used in this study. It was grown at 37 °C in Sauton medium (33Suzuki Y. Yoshinaga K. Ono Y. Nagata A. Yamada T. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 839-843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformed BCG was maintained with kanamycin (20 μg/ml). Peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit immunoglobulins was purchased from Dako A/S Co. (Glostrup, Denmark). FN was purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Trypsin, which was modified by reductive alkylation and treated with tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone, was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Reagents used for synthesis and analysis were reagent-grade. Amino acid derivatives were purchased from Watanabe Chemical (Hiroshima, Japan). M. kansasii α-Ag was purified from culture filtrate (CF) of transformed BCG harboring plasmid pIJK-1, which contains the gene encoding M. kansasii α-Ag (34Matsuo K. Yamaguchi R. Yamazaki A. Tasaka H. Terasaka K. Totsuka M. Kobayashi K. Yukitake H. Yamada T. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 4049-4054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BCG α-Ag (Ag 85B), Ag 85A, Ag 85C, and MPB51 (35Ohara N. Kitaura H. Hotokezaka H. Nishiyama T. Wada N. Matsumoto S. Matsuo T. Naito M. Yamada T. Scand. J. Immunol. 1995; 41: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) were purified from CF derived from BCG. The procedure to purify antigens was developed on the basis of the purification technique for MPT59 as described previously (36Nagai S. Wiker H.G. Harboe M. Kinomoto M. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 372-382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit antibodies raised against FN were prepared as described previously (24Ratliff T.L. McGarr J.A. Abou-Zeid C. Rook G.A. Stanford J.L. Aslanzadeh J. Brown E.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 1307-1313PubMed Google Scholar). Purified M. kansasii α-Ag (1 mg/ml) was digested by overnight incubation at room temperature with CNBr (10 mg/ml) in 70% formic acid. The reaction mixture was dried under a stream of N2. M. kansasii α-Ag (125 μg/ml) was also digested with trypsin (5 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 36 h. The digested mixture was precipitated with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. These digests were stored at −20 °C. The CF proteins (40 μg) were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis as described previously (37O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The digested fragments were separated by Tricine (N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl glycine/SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (38Ploug M. Jensen A.L. Barkholt V. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 181: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or transblotted onto Immobilon membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membranes were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (BSA/PBS) for 1 h at 37 °C and probed with FN at 10 μg/ml in BSA/PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. Membranes were washed with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS at 37 °C, and bound FN was detected with anti-FN antibodies followed by peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit immunoglobulins. Enzyme activity was visualized with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine and hydrogen peroxide in 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The blotted membranes were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The stained bands and spots were cut out and applied to an Applied Biosystems 477A gas-phase protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA). Then, the sequence of the five N-terminal amino acid residues of each sample was determined. The peptides were synthesized using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry (39Fields G.B. Noble R.L. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1990; 35: 161-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (2307) Google Scholar). The synthesized peptides were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography with a RESOURCE RPC reversed-phase column (6.4 × 30 mm, 1 ml; Pharmacia Biotech, Inc., Uppsala, Sweden). Elution was carried out with a linear gradient of 16–32% acetonitrile in 0.1% NH4HCO3, pH 8.3, for 20 min and was monitored at 220 nm. For purification of only peptide-(211–230), 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was used as buffer. The final products were identified by amino acid analysis. The peptides were lyophilized, and the concentrations were defined by weight. The FN binding to proteins was examined by solid-phase ELISA. SUMILON 96-well ELISA plates (Sumitomo Bakelite Co., Ltd. Tokyo, Japan) were coated for 2 h at 37 °C with 0.5 μg of proteins/well in carbonate buffer, pH 9.6. Nonspecific sites were blocked by incubation with BSA/PBS. After washing, the plates were incubated with 2 μg of FN/well in BSA/PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. Bound FN was determined by rabbit anti-FN antibodies and peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit immunoglobulins and was subsequently developed with o-phenylendiamine dihydrochloride. The abilities of synthetic peptides to bind to FN were determined as follows. SUMILON 96-well ELISA plates were coated with 100 μl of 6.28 μm peptides in carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, for 24 h at 37 °C. After blocking nonspecific sites with BSA/PBS, the quantity of FN (2 μg/well in BSA/PBS) bound after 1 h of incubation at 37 °C was assayed as described above. The capacity of synthetic peptides to interfere with protein binding to FN was examined. SUMILON 96-well ELISA plates were coated for 2 h at 37 °C with 0.5 μg of proteins/well in PBS, pH 7.2. Then, nonspecific sites were blocked by incubation with BSA/PBS as described above. FN in BSA/PBS (20 μg/ml) was preincubated with the peptide at 15 μm for 1 h at 37 °C. Then, 100 μl of FN/peptide mixture was added to the wells. FN bound to solid-phase proteins was then assayed as described above. The programs FASTA, TFASTA, and BLAST in DDBJ (Shizuoka, Japan) were used to search amino acid sequence homologies in the DDBJ, EMBL, GenBank™, PIR, and SWISS-PROT data bases. The deduced amino acid sequence alignment was performed using the program ODEN in DDBJ. Fig. 1 A shows the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of CF proteins derived from BCG. The labeled spots were identified as described previously (35Ohara N. Kitaura H. Hotokezaka H. Nishiyama T. Wada N. Matsumoto S. Matsuo T. Naito M. Yamada T. Scand. J. Immunol. 1995; 41: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). FN bound not only to the Ag 85 complex, but also to MPB51. There were some additional spots around the Ag 85 complex. These spots might be due to streaking of the Ag 85 complex occurring in the first dimension. Purified M. kansasii α-Ag was digested by CNBr or trypsin to investigate the FN-binding sites. The digested fragments were analyzed by Tricine/SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. CNBr digestion generated three bands from M. kansasii α-Ag that had molecular masses of 10.5, 6.2, and 5.8 kDa (Table I, CNBr-1, CNBr-2, and CNBr-3). Trypsin digestion generated three bands that had molecular masses of 8.0, 6.1, and 5.7 kDa (Table I, trypsin-1, trypsin-2, and trypsin-3). The other fragments were too small to see on Tricine/SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. FN bound to the CNBr-3 and trypsin-1 bands (Fig. 1 C). In control experiments, M. kansasii α-Ag and the digested bands did not react with anti-FN antibodies. The sequence of the first five N-terminal residues of each digested band was determined. From the sequence data of the trypsin-1 band, it became clear that it contained two fragments. The band was separated into two spots by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1 D, spots A and B). FN bound to both spots (Fig. 1 E). The amino acid sequence of M. kansasii α-Ag had already been determined, so N-terminal sequence analysis allowed the identification of the bands and spots based on their predicted size and cleavage sites with CNBr and trypsin (Table I). Thus, the suggested key residues for FN binding were 27 residues (amino acids 84–110) and 4 residues (amino acids 216–219) (Fig. 2).Table IThe FN binding ability of the digested fragments that were generated from M. kansasii α-AgBand/spotApparent sizeFN bindingSequenceSupposed positionExpected sizekDakDaCNBr-110.4−WGPSS…Trp220–Met31410.4CNBr-26.1−PVGGQ…Pro111–Met1676.1CNBr-35.8+GRSIK…Gly59–Met105.8Trypsin-1 Spot A8.0+AQDDY…Ala84–Arg1537.9 Spot B7.9+SV.PT…Ser154–Arg2307.8Trypsin-26.1−SVDPP…Ser154–Lys2156.1Trypsin-35.7−SSNL…Ser275–Ala3255.5 Open table in a new tab To confirm the suggestion, two peptides, peptide-(84–110) and peptide-(211–230), were synthesized and tested for their ability to bind to FN. Peptide-(211–230), containing amino acids 216–219, was prepared to improve its binding efficiency against the ELISA plates. Both peptides bound FN significantly above background levels when coated on the ELISA plates (Fig. 3). InM. kansasii α-Ag, at least two distinct and discontinuous FN-binding epitopes were identified at amino acids 84–110 and 211–230. We tested whether the peptides could inhibit the binding of FN to the M. kansasiiα-Ag molecule. Peptide-(84–110) inhibited the binding of FN toM. kansasii α-Ag (Fig. 4). On the other hand, peptide-(211–230) had no effect on the interaction of FN and M. kansasii α-Ag even with the peptide concentration raised to 150 μm (data not shown). Peptide-(84–110) could also inhibit the binding of FN to BCG α-Ag, Ag 85A, Ag 85C, and MPB51 (Fig. 4). Using a series of systematically shortened lengths, a fine FN-binding motif was identified (Fig. 5). A significantly decreased inhibition of FN binding to M. kansasii α-Ag was associated with the removal of Phe98. Deletion of Val108 from the C terminus resulted in complete loss of inhibition. The critical residues required for FN binding were 11 residues (FEWYYQSGLSV) that corresponded to peptide-(98–108). A series of peptides containing a single substitution with alanine was prepared to identify the residues within amino acids 98–108 that were critical for binding to FN. Fig. 6 shows the inhibition of FN binding toM. kansasii α-Ag by these peptides. Substitutions at positions 98–103 dramatically reduced inhibition. The Glu99 → Ala and Tyr102 → Ala peptides reduced the inhibitory activity by 15–17%. The Phe98 → Ala, Trp100 → Ala, Tyr101 → Ala, and Gln103 → Ala peptides gave no inhibition. The Ser104 → Ala, Leu106 → Ala, Ser107 → Ala, and Val108 → Ala peptides reduced inhibition slightly. No marked difference was observed in the Gly105 → Ala peptide. Pathogenic bacteria attach to their preferred host target by molecules on the bacterial surface, termed adhesins, that recognize cognate host-cell receptors (40Falkow S. Cell. 1991; 65: 1099-1102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). α-Ag and its families have been suggested to be one of the bacterial ligands that can achieve attachment to a bridging ligand of host origin extracellular matrix FN. This Ag is specific for mycobacteria, and its interaction with FN might also enable the pathogen to reach a natural pathway determined by the bridging ligand FN-host receptor interaction. We examined the interaction of α-Ag with FN to elucidate its role in mycobacterial infection. At least two different FN-binding epitopes were defined in M. kansasii α-Ag, amino acids 84–110 and 211–230. There is no sequence similarity between defined epitopes. These epitopes have no homology to other known prokaryotic and eukaryotic FN-binding proteins except the Ag 85 complex. Therefore, the Ag 85 complex might have unique abilities to bind to FN. In the peptide inhibition assay, only peptide-(84–110) could inhibit the binding of FN to intact M. kansasii α-Ag. Each peptide had no effect on the binding of FN to the other (data not shown). The relative positions of these two epitopes within the three-dimensional structure of M. kansasii α-Ag are still unknown, but the results indicate that the multiple epitopes of M. kansasiiα-Ag may work separately for binding to FN. Amino acids 211–230 might be hidden in the intact natural molecule and not hidden in the denatured state. In contrast, amino acids 84–110 might be exposed on the surface of the molecule and work as a major domain to bind to FN. The multiple FN-binding regions had been previously reported in α-Ag of Mycobacterium leprae (25Thole J.E. Schoningh R. Janson A.A. Garbe T. Cornelisse Y.E. Clark C.J. Kolk A.H. Ottenhoff T.H. De Vries R. Abou-Zeid C. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and M. bovis (41Peake P. Gooley A. Britton W.J. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 4828-4834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but their role in the natural α-Ag molecule in FN binding had not yet been examined. In this study, we defined a new region (amino acids 84–110) that might play a very important role in FN binding to the α-Ag molecule. This region and its surrounding sequence are almost identical among mycobacterial species including the other structurally related components, Ag 85A and Ag 85C. Peptide-(84–110) could inhibit the binding of FN to all components of the Ag 85 complex of BCG. The defined region may contain the common motif of the Ag 85 complex for binding to FN. We attempted successively to determine the common motif of α-Ag using a series of peptides that truncated at the N and C termini. The peptide inhibition assay was performed to exclude the artifacts that might result from a different efficiency in peptide fixation to the ELISA plates. Concerning deletion at Ala97, ELISA could not detect the binding of FN to the wells that were coated with the peptide (data not shown), but the same peptide showed the full binding inhibition of FN as an original peptide. Ala97 might work to interact with the ELISA plates, but not with FN. The results indicated that the binding motif contained 11 residues,98FEWYYQSGLSV108. Further study defined critical amino acid residues in this motif using analogous peptides that were substituted with alanines. Substitution with alanine allowed essential residues of the motif for binding to FN to be determined. The negatively charged residue Glu99, the polar residue Gln103, and the aromatic residues Phe98, Trp100, Tyr101, and Tyr102 seem to be essential for binding to FN. Peptide-(98–108) also could inhibit FN binding to the Ag 85 complex of BCG (data not shown). Comparing the amino acid sequences among these antigens revealed that the defined FN-binding motif allowed some amino acid substitutions. The aromatic residues Trp100 and Tyr102 can change place with the negatively charged residues Glu and Asp, respectively (Fig. 7). These positions might be substituted with other negatively charged residues. The substitution Val108 → Ala did not affect the inhibition ability. However, the deletion of this residue removed the binding ability completely. Therefore, the residue at this position is absolutely required, although it can be replaced with other hydrophobic residues. This is the first report on the ability of MPB51 to bind to FN. The secreted protein MPB51 is one of the major proteins in the CF derived from BCG and immunologically cross-reacts with the Ag 85 complex. We have defined the complete sequence of this Ag. MPB51 showed 37–43% homology to the components of the Ag 85 complex (35Ohara N. Kitaura H. Hotokezaka H. Nishiyama T. Wada N. Matsumoto S. Matsuo T. Naito M. Yamada T. Scand. J. Immunol. 1995; 41: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). MPB51 could bind to FN. Peptide-(84–110) could inhibit the binding of FN to MPB51. Interestingly, there is no sequence similarity between the peptide and MPB51. The Ag 85 complex and MPB51 might share the same binding position on FN. It is very meaningful to analyze their roles in pathogenesis and host immunity. The motif does not overlap with the region that corresponds to the monoclonal antibody HYT27 binding determinant, amino acids 111–119 (42Roche P.W. Peake P.W. Billman J.H. Doran T. Britton W.J. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 5319-5326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is good agreement with previous studies that HYT27 failed to block α-Ag binding to FN (23Abou-Zeid C. Ratliff T.L. Wiker H.G. Harboe M. Bennedsen J. Rook G.A. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 3046-3051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoglobulins that recognize the FN-binding motif may enhance mycobacterial binding to FN. The knowledge presented in this study might be useful in the control of mycobacterial infection. We propose the motif, particularly the key residues98FEWYYQ103, as a possible candidate component of a subunit synthetic vaccine against mycobacterial infection. Studies to examine the binding sites on FN molecules that interact with α-Ag are currently underway in our laboratory. Our findings may contribute to clarification of the roles of α-Ag in the mycobacteria-host cell relationship. We thank Dr. T. Niidome for helpful technical support, suggestions, and discussions. We also thank Dr. H. Kitaura, Dr. M. Takano-Shirai, and H. Yukitake for suggestions and encouragement."
https://openalex.org/W2024263598,"We have investigated the effect of nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), an inhibitor of lipoxygenase, on the intracellular protein transport and the structure of the Golgi complex. Pulse-chase experiments and immunoelectron microscopy showed that NDGA strongly inhibits the transport of newly synthesized secretory proteins to the Golgi complex resulting in their accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Despite their retention in the ER, oligosaccharides of secretory and ER-resident proteins were processed to endoglycosidase H-resistant forms, raising the possibility that oligosaccharide-processing enzymes are redistributed from the Golgi to the ER. Morphological observations further revealed that α-mannosidase II (a cis/medial-Golgi marker), but not TGN38 (a trans-Golgi network marker), rapidly redistributes to the ER in the presence of NDGA, resulting in the disappearance of the characteristic Golgi structure. Upon removal of the drug, the Golgi complex was reassembled into the normal structure as judged by perinuclear staining of α-mannosidase II and by restoration of the secretion. These effects of NDGA are quite similar to those of brefeldin A. However, unlike brefeldin A, NDGA did not cause a dissociation of β-coatomer protein, a subunit of coatomer, from the Golgi membrane. On the contrary, NDGA exerted the stabilizing effect on β-coatomer protein/membrane interaction against the dissociation caused by brefeldin A and ATP depletion. Taken together, these results indicate that NDGA is a potent agent disrupting the structure and function of the Golgi complex with a mechanism different from those known for other drugs reported so far.

Orci L. Nature. 1992; 335: 409-415Crossref Scopus (744) Google Scholar). In the secretory pathway, the Golgi complex plays a key role in the sorting and modification of proteins. Resident ER proteins are sorted at the cis-Golgi network and recycled back to the ER (2Letouneur F. Gaynor E.C. Hennecke S. Demouliere C. Duden R. Emer S. Riezmen H. Cosson P. Cell. 1994; 79: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar), and lysosomal proteins are sorted at the TGN (3Griffiths G. Simons K. Science. 1986; 234: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Modifications such as oligosaccharide processing (4Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3779) Google Scholar), proteolytic processing (5Misumi Y. Oda K. Fujiwara T. Takami N. Tashiro K. Ikehara Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 1988; 263: 7426-7430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are carried out by enzymes with specific localizations in the Golgi subcompartments. Each transport step along the secretory pathway is mediated by small vesicles that bud from a donor compartment and fuse with a target compartment membrane. Biochemical and genetic studies have identified a number of proteins involved in the vesicular transport (1Rothman J.E. Orci L. Nature. 1992; 335: 409-415Crossref Scopus (744) Google Scholar, 7Waters M.G. Serafini T. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1991; 349: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 8Söllner T.

Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 536-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These include coat protein complexes (COPI and COPII) and ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) or Sar1p for vesicle budding, and N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein, solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion attachment proteins, and soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) for vesicle docking and fusion. It is postulated that the specificity of vesicle targeting is generated by complexes formed between membrane proteins on the transport vesicles (v-SNAREs) and those on the target compartments (t-SNAREs) (10Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar). The use of drugs affecting the secretory process at distinct sites in the cell may prove valuable for more detailed studies of specific steps in secretion and may lead to the understanding of the molecular basis of the mechanisms involved in intracellular transport. One of the most useful and characterized drugs is the fungal metabolite brefeldin A (BFA). BFA strongly blocks secretion by apparently inhibiting protein transport from the ER to the Golgi (11Misumi Y. Misumi Y. Miki K. Takatsuki A. Tamura G. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11398-11403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Fujiwara T. Oda K. Yokota S. Takatsuki A. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18545-18552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and causes redistribution of resident Golgi proteins into the ER (12Fujiwara T. Oda K. Yokota S. Takatsuki A. Ikehara Y. J.

The primary action of the drug is now believed to be to inhibit Golgi membrane-catalyzed GDP/GTP exchange of ARF (16Donaldson J.G. Finazzi D. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1992; 360: 350-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 17Helms J.B. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1992; 360: 352-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) that is required for assembly of ARF and COPI onto the Golgi membrane (18Orci L. Palmer D.J. Amherdt M. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 364: 732-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), resulting in lack of formation of transport vesicles. The redistribution of resident Golgi proteins to the ER in the presence of BFA is microtubule-dependent (19Lippincott-Schwartz J. Donaldson J.G. Schweizer A. Berger E.G. Hauri H.-P. Yuan L.C. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1990; 60: 821-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar) and suggests the existence of a retrograde transport pathway without involving COPI vesicles. This is in contrast to the recent evidence that resident ER proteins are retrieved from the cis-Golgi network by COPI-dependent transport vesicles (2Letouneur F. Gaynor E.C. Hennecke S. Demouliere C. Duden R. Emer S. Riezmen H. Cosson P. Cell. 1994; 79: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar), which also raises a question as to how COPI proteins are involved in both the anterograde and retrograde transport from the cis-Golgi network (9Salama N.R. Schekman R.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 536-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 20Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1994; 79: 1125-1127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thus, more data are required to elucidate the details of the vesicular transport mechanism. Nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), a polyhydroxyphenolic antioxidant, is known to exert the inhibitory effect on lipoxygenase pathways of arachidonic acid metabolism (21Morris H.R. Piper P.J. Taylor G.W. Tippins J.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1979; 66: 452Google Scholar, 22Armour C.L. Hughes J.M. Seale J.P. Temple D.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 72: 93-96Google Scholar). It was recently demonstrated that NDGA also inhibits the secretion of prolactin from GH3 cells (23Tagaya M. Henomatsu N. Yoshimori T. Yamamoto A. Tashiro Y. Fukui T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 210-214Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and the intracellular transport of vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (24Tagaya M. Henomatsu N. Yoshimori T. Yamamoto A. Tashiro Y. Mizushima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 863-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The drug is likely to inhibit protein transport from the ER to the Golgi and also from the TGN to the cell surface. In the present study we examined the effect of NDGA on secretion and intracellular processing of secretory proteins, confirming that the drug indeed blocks the protein transport from the ER to the Golgi complex. In addition, we have found that NDGA rapidly disrupts the cisternal organization of the Golgi complex and causes the redistribution of resident Golgi proteins into the ER without dissociation of COPI from the membrane in contrast to the effects of BFA. NDGA was obtained from Sigma. BFA was from Wako Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). Antibodies to β-COP (25Seguchi T. Goto Y. Ono M. Fujiwara T. Shimada T. Kung H. Nishioka M. Ikehara Y. Kuwano M. J. Biol.

Banting (University of Bristol, U.K.) and monoclonal anti-α-mannosidase II (Man II) was from Berkeley Antibody Co. (Richmond, CA). Antibodies to albumin, third component of complement (C3), and α1-protease inhibitor (α1-PI) were purchased from Organon Teknika (Durham, NC). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG were from Dakopatts (Glostrup, Denmark). Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was from Biosys (Compiegne, France). Biotinylated anti-mouse IgG and peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin were from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). HepG2 and H35P15 cells were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. NRK and COS-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimum essential medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfection experiments were carried out as described (27Tsuji E. Misumi Y.

The plasmid (20 μg) was transfected into COS-1 cells with the Lipofectin Reagent. The transfected cells were cultured for 2 days before use. Cells in 60-mm plastic dishes were pulse-labeled for 10 or 20 min with [35S]methionine (50 μCi/dish) in methionine-free Eagle's minimum essential medium and chased in the complete Eagle's minimum essential medium in the presence or absence of NDGA (30 μm) or BFA (5 μg/ml) (11Misumi Y. Misumi Y. Miki K. Takatsuki A. Tamura G. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11398-11403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cycloheximide (50 μm) was added to the chase medium. At the indicated times, the cells were separated from the medium, and cell lysates were prepared (29Takami N. Ogata S. Oda K. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3016-3021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 35S-Labeled proteins of cell lysates and medium were immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies, extensively washed, and subjected to enzyme digestion when indicated (29Takami N. Ogata S. Oda K. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3016-3021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were incubated with endo H (0.2 unit/ml) in 50 mm acetate buffer (pH 5.5) at 37 °C for 16 h, or with neuraminidase (0.2 unit/ml) in 50 mmacetate buffer (pH 5.0) for 20 h. Proalbumin (pI 6.0) and albumin (pI 5.8) were separated by electrofocusing on 5% polyacrylamide gels (pH range from 5 to 8) as described previously (11Misumi Y. Misumi Y. Miki K. Takatsuki A. Tamura G. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11398-11403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was carried out on 7.5% gels (for C3) and on 10% gels (for α1-PI) according to Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and the gels were processed for fluorography (29Takami N. Ogata S. Oda K. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3016-3021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HepG2 cells (8 × 106 cells/150-mm dish), before or after the NDGA treatment, were washed and suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). An equal volume of 0.6 m perchloric acid was added to the cell suspension and mixed well, followed by centrifugation at 32,000 ×g for 5 min. The resulting supernatant was neutralized with 5 m KOH and used for the determination of ATP as described (11Misumi Y. Misumi Y. Miki K. Takatsuki A. Tamura G. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11398-11403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NRK cells were suspended in 0.2 ml of a buffer containing 25 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.2), 115 mm KCl, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol and 0.2 m sucrose (buffer A) and homogenized by passing 15 times through a 25-gauge needle. Nuclei and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 600 ×g for 5 min. The postnuclear supernatant was separated into cytosol and membrane fractions by centrifugation at 125,000 ×g for 1 h. Proteins of each sample were separated by SDS-PAGE (8% gels) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The membrane was incubated with rabbit anti-β-COP IgG (25 μg/ml) for 1 h, followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h. The immunoreaction was visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Sigma). Cells were grown on glass coverslips. After the indicated treatments, cells were briefly washed with PBS and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. The fixed cells were washed, permeabilized with 0.1% saponin in PBS and incubated with the indicated primary antibodies for 15 min, followed by incubation for 15 min with fluorescein isothiocyanate- or tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies. To see the membrane association of β-COP, cells on a coverslip were perforated according to Simons and Vitra (31Simons K. Vitra H. EMBO J. 1987; 8: 2241-2247Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and washed before fixation and immunostaining. Briefly, a HATF filter (0.45-μm pore size, Millipore) presoaked in buffer A was placed on a cell monolayer for 1 min. The filter was gently peeled off the cell monolayer on the coverslip, and the perforated cells were washed with buffer A for 5 min at room temperature. Drugs, when indicated, were present throughout the perforation and washing steps. The cells were then washed with PBS, fixed, and stained for β-COP as above. HepG2 cells (for albumin) and H35P15 cells (for Man II) were fixed for 2 h with the paraformaldehyde/lysine/periodate fixative (32McLean I.W. Nakane P.K. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1974; 22: 1077-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (3200) Google Scholar) and permeabilized with 0.05% saponin (12Fujiwara T. Oda K. Yokota S. Takatsuki A. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18545-18552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HepG2 cells were incubated for 2 h with anti-albumin antibodies, followed by incubation for 1 h with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. The H35P15 cells were incubated with anti-Man II antibodies and then with biotinylated anti-mouse IgG and peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin for 1 h each. After the peroxidase reaction, the cells were processed for electron microscopy as described previously (12Fujiwara T. Oda K. Yokota S. Takatsuki A. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18545-18552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HepG2 cells synthesize various plasma proteins including albumin, the C3, and α1-PI. In addition, albumin and C3 are initially synthesized as proforms, which are converted into mature forms at the TGN (5Misumi Y. Oda K. Fujiwara T. Takami N. Tashiro K. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16954-16959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Misumi Y. Misumi Y. Miki K. Takatsuki A. Tamura G. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11398-11403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In control cells, newly synthesized albumin was rapidly converted to the mature form and secreted into the medium (Fig. 1 A). The presence of a small amount of proalbumin in the medium may be due to the relatively low activity of the converting enzyme in HepG2 cells as compared with that of hepatocytes (33Oda K. Fujiwara T. Ikehara Y. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the presence of 30 μm NDGA, however, the processing and secretion of albumin were strongly blocked (Fig. 1 B). Upon removal of the drug, the labeled albumin was normally processed and secreted into the medium (Fig. 1 C), indicating the reversibility of the drug effect. Since protein synthesis was found to be significantly inhibited at higher concentrations of the drug, we used NDGA at 30 μmthroughout the following experiments. Essentially the same results were obtained for the processing and secretion of pro-C3. In the control cells, pro-C3 synthesized as a single polypeptide of 180 kDa and was processed into the α (115 kDa) and β (65 kDa) subunits, which were secreted into the medium, although a considerable amount of the proform was also secreted (Fig. 1 D). The processing and secretion of pro-C3 were completely blocked by NDGA (Fig. 1 E), and this inhibitory effect was reversible (Fig. 1 F). These results suggest that NDGA blocks secretion by inhibiting the intracellular transport of proteins before the site where the proforms of albumin and C3 are processed into the mature forms. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that albumin was markedly concentrated in the juxtanuclear region in the control cells (Fig. 2 A), whereas the protein was distributed in reticular network structures extending throughout the cytoplasm in the NDGA-treated cells (Fig. 2 B). The alteration in localization of albumin was examined in more detail by immunoelectron microscopy. In the control cells, albumin was most heavily stained in the Golgi complex, although also detectable in the ER and nuclear envelope (Fig. 2 C). In the cells treated with the drug for 2 h (Fig. 2 D), however, we could not identify the characteristic Golgi stack structure where albumin had been concentrated. The immunoreaction product was detected exclusively in the ER and nuclear envelope. Although some mitochondria appeared to be slightly swollen, structures of other organelles were not significantly changed by treatment with the drug. These results suggest that NDGA primarily blocks the protein transport from the ER, resulting in the accumulation of secretory proteins in the ER. Since it is known that intracellular protein transport is critically dependent on cellular ATP levels, we examined the effect of NDGA on the ATP level in HepG2 cells. The ATP content in control cells was measured to be about 17 nmol/mg protein. When cells were treated with the drug, the cellular ATP level was rapidly decreased to about 40% of the control, a level that was maintained throughout an incubation time of up to 3 h with the drug (Fig. 3). However, removal of the drug from the medium at 30 min of incubation did not allow the ATP level to be recovered during the following incubation times without the drug. This is in contrast to the reversible effect of NDGA on secretion and proteolytic processing (Fig. 1). These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of NDGA on protein transport may not be directly coupled with the reduction in the cellular ATP levels caused by the drug. If NDGA blocks the transport of secretory glycoproteins out of the ER, it is expected that their oligosaccharides will remain as high mannose type sensitive to endo H digestion. To test this, we examined the biosynthesis and processing of the secretory glycoprotein α1-PI in HepG2 cells. In control cells, α1-PI was initially synthesized as a 51-kDa form and subsequently converted to a 56-kDa form, which was secreted into the medium (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1–6). The 51-kDa form was sensitive to endo H digestion, whereas the 56-kDa form was resistant to endo H (Fig. 4 A, lanes 7–11). In addition, the latter form decreased the molecular size to 51 kDa when treated with neuraminidase (Fig. 4 A, lane 12). In contrast, in NDGA-treated cells, the newly synthesized 51-kDa form was neither converted into the mature 56-kDa form nor secreted into the medium (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1–6). The 51-kDa form in the treated cells, however, showed different responses to endo H depending on the chase times. Upon digestion with endo H, the protein was initially converted to the completely sensitive 41-kDa form, then to partially sensitive forms, and finally to a single resistant 51-kDa form (Fig. 4 B, lanes 7–11). The final 51-kDa form obtained at 3-h chase was insensitive to neuraminidase treatment (Fig. 4 B, lane 13) and had the same molecular size as that of the neuraminidase-treated form in the control cells (Fig. 4 A, lane 12). The results indicate that the 51-kDa form contains complex type oligosaccharides without sialylation. Immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed that α1-PI was retained in the ER-like structures in the treated cells (Fig. 4 D). The finding that the oligosaccharides of α1-PI retained in the ER are converted to the complex type might suggest that the processing enzymes localized in the Golgi complex are redistributed into the ER in the presence of NDGA. This possibility was confirmed by another set of experiments. DPP IV is an ectoenzyme withN-linked oligosaccharide chains (26Ogata S. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3596-3601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that a mutant with substitution of Gly633 → Arg (mDPP IV) is retained in the ER and degraded there without being transported to the Golgi complex (27Tsuji E. Misumi Y. Fujiwara T. Takami N. Ogata S. Ikehara Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11921-11927Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 28Fujiwara T. Tsuji E. Misumi Y. Takami N. Ikehara Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 776-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). When mDPP IV was expressed in COS-1 cells by transfection, the protein was retained in the ER (Fig. 5 D) and remained completely sensitive to endo H even after 4-h chase in control cells (Fig. 5 A). In the presence of NDGA, however, the protein acquired the resistance to endo H after the chase (Fig. 5 B) as observed in BFA-treated cells (Fig. 5 C). There was no significant difference in distribution of mDPP IV between the control and treated cells, demonstrating its retention in the ER (Fig. 5, D and E). These results suggest that NDGA causes the redistribution of the Golgi-resident processing enzymes to the ER as effectively as BFA. Man II has been used as a cis/medial-Golgi marker (4Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3779) Google Scholar,14Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1989; 56: 801-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar), whereas TGN38 is a membrane protein localized in the TGN (34Luzio J.P. Burke B. Banting G. Howell K.E. Braghetta P. Stanley K.K. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Changes in localizations of Man II and TGN38 were examined in NRK cells as a function of time after exposure to NDGA. Man II localized in perinuclear regions in control cells (Fig. 6 A) still remained in the same regions with slightly fragmented and dispersed structures in cells treated with the drug for 5 min (Fig. 6 C). After 30 min of incubation, Man II was distributed on punctate or reticular structures over the cytoplasm, and no significant perinuclear staining was detected (Fig. 6 E). A more intense staining pattern for Man II on the reticular structures was observed in cells exposed for 2 h (Fig. 6 G). This effect of NDGA was found to be reversible. The reticular distribution of Man II in cells treated with the drug for 1 h (Fig. 7 A) completely reversed to a perinuclear localization after 2 h of incubation without the drug (Fig. 7 D) through intermediate stepwise changes (Fig. 7, B and C) reciprocal to those observed in the presence of the drug (Fig. 6, C and E). In contrast to Man II, the localization of TGN38 was not so significantly changed by the drug (Fig. 6, B, D, F, and H), indicating that NDGA has little effect, if any, on the TGN structure.Figure 7Reversibility of the NDGA effect on the localization of Man II. NRK cells were pretreated with NDGA for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were then incubated in a fresh medium without the drug for 0 min (A), 30 min (B), 1 h (C), and 2 h (D), fixed, permeabilized, and stained for Man II by immunofluorescence as in Fig. 6. Bar = 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The change in localization of Man II was examined by immunoelectron microscopy, for which rat hepatoma H35P15 cells were used since Man II was more intensely stained in these cells than in the NRK cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed the same staining profiles of Man II in H35P15 cells (Fig. 8, A and B) as in NRK cells (Fig. 6, A and G). When observed by immunoelectron microscopy, Man II was detected only in the Golgi cisternae in control cells (Fig. 8 C). In contrast, no immunostainable Golgi structures could be observed in cells treated with NDGA for 3 h. Instead, Man II was clearly detected in the ER and weakly detected in the nuclear envelope (Fig. 8 D). Taken together, these results indicate that the cis/medial-Golgi protein, but not the TGN marker, redistribute into the ER in the presence of NDGA. The data presented here show that the effects of NDGA are quite similar to those caused by BFA. BFA is known to prevent the attachment of ARF and coatomer (COPI) to the Golgi membrane, resulting in their rapid dissociation from the membrane (16Donaldson J.G. Finazzi D. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1992; 360: 350-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 17Helms J.B. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1992; 360: 352-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 35Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2295-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). To see whether NDGA also has the same effect, we examined the response of β-COP, a subunit of COPI, upon NDGA treatment. β-COP was colocalized with Man II in the Golgi complex in control cells (Fig. 9, panel A, a and b). In cells treated with NDGA for 10 min, β-COP was detected in large vesicular structures scattered in the cytoplasm and colocalized with Man II (Fig. 9, panel A, c and d). After 30 min of incubation, β-COP and Man II were dispersed into the cytoplasm and showed essentially the same staining profile (Fig. 9, panel A, e and f). Immunoelectron microscopy confirmed that β-COP was localized to the ER and nuclear envelope in the treated cells (data not shown) as observed for Man II (Fig. 8 D). When cells were perforated and washed, β-COP was completely removed from cells that had been treated with BFA (Fig. 9, panel B, c and d), whereas the dispersed β-COP remained in the NDGA-treated cells (Fig. 9, panel B, a and b). In addition, an immunoblot"
https://openalex.org/W2041713399,"Modulation of protein/protein interaction is an important mechanism involved in regulation of translation initiation. Specifically, regulation of the interaction of eIF2 with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, eIF2B, is a key mechanism for controlling translation under a variety of conditions. Phosphorylation of the α-subunit of eIF2 converts the protein into a competitive inhibitor of eIF2B by causing an increase in the binding affinity of eIF2B for eIF2. Consequently, it has been assumed that the α-subunit of eIF2 is directly involved in binding to eIF2B. In the present study, eIF2 was found to bind only to the δ- and ε-subunits of eIF2B, and eIF2B was shown to bind only to the β-subunit of eIF2 by far-Western blot analysis. The binding site on eIF2β for either the eIF2B holoprotein, or the isolated δ- or ε-subunits of eIF2B was shown to be located within approximately 70 amino acids of the C terminus of the protein. Phosphorylation of the α-subunit of eIF2 did not promote binding of eIF2B to the isolated subunit. However, it did cause an increase in the affinity of eIF2B for eIF2. Finally, phosphorylation by protein kinase A of the β-subunit of eIF2 in the C-terminal portion of the protein increased the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of eIF2B, whereas phosphorylation by casein kinase II or protein kinase C was without effect.

The translation initiation phase of protein synthesis is a complex process mediated by a family of at least 12 proteins collectively referred to as eukaryotic initiation factors (reviewed in Refs. 1Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar, 2Merrick W.C. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 291-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Regulation of translation initiation plays a crucial role in maintaining protein homeostasis within cells in response to a variety of hormonal, nutritional, and environmental stimuli. One of the most tightly regulated steps in translation initiation involves two multisubunit proteins referred to as eukaryotic initiation factors eIF2 and eIF2B. During initiation, eIF2 binds GTP and initiator methionyl-tRNAi(Met-tRNAi) 1The abbreviations used are: Met-tRNAi, methionyl-tRNAi; PKA, protein kinase A; PKC, protein kinase C; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; CK-II, casein kinase II; HCR, heme-controlled repressor; GSK-3, glycogen synthase kinase 3. , and the eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNAi ternary complex then binds to a 40 S ribosomal subunit. Upon joining of the 60 S ribosomal subunit, the GTP bound to eIF2 is hydrolyzed to GDP, and eIF2 is released from the ribosome as an eIF2·GDP binary complex. Before eIF2 can participate in another cycle of initiation, the GDP bound to the protein must be exchanged for GTP. This guanine nucleotide exchange reaction is mediated by the heteropentameric protein, eIF2B. One of the ways through which the activity of eIF2B is regulated occurs through an unusual mechanism involving phosphorylation of one of the subunits of its substrate eIF2 (reviewed in Ref. 3Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). The smallest, or α-subunit, of eIF2 is phosphorylated in response to a variety of cellular stresses including viral infection, heat shock, heavy metals, and deprivation of amino acids or serum. Previous studies have reported that the affinity of eIF2B for eIF2(αP) is increased either 2-fold (4Goss D.J. Parkhurst L.J. Mehta H.B. Woodley C.L. Wahba A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7374-7377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or 150-fold (5Rowlands A.G. Panniers R. Henshaw E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5526-5533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), depending on the method used to measure the interaction. An obvious assumption from these studies is that the α-subunit of eIF2 would bind to one or more subunits of eIF2B. However, even though both proteins have been available in purified form for more than 15 years, the interprotein subunit interactions have remained undefined. Yet an understanding of the subunit interactions between the two proteins is vital not only to understanding the basis for the inhibition of eIF2B by phosphorylation of eIF2α, but also for delineating the mechanism through which eIF2B mediates guanine nucleotide exchange on eIF2. In the present study, we have identified the interprotein interactions among the subunits of eIF2 and eIF2B. Surprisingly, eIF2B was found to bind not to the α-subunit of eIF2, but instead only to the β-subunit. Furthermore, eIF2B was found to bind to a domain within approximately 70 amino acids of the C terminus of eIF2β. Phosphorylation of eIF2α did not induce binding of eIF2B to the isolated α-subunit, but did increase the affinity of eIF2B for the eIF2 holoprotein. In addition, the δ- and ε-subunits of eIF2B were identified as the sites for binding of eIF2. Finally, phosphorylation of the β-subunit of eIF2 by protein kinase A (PKA) increased the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of eIF2B. ECL detection reagents and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated, sheep anti-mouse Ig were purchased from Amersham Life Sciences, Inc. PVDF membrane was obtained from Bio-Rad. Casein kinase II (CK-II) was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. PKA and protein kinase C (PKC) were from Promega. The subunits of eIF2 and eIF2B were separated by electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described previously (6Kimball S.R. Everson W.V. Myers L.M. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2220-2227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins were then transferred onto PVDF membranes, and the membranes were blocked in 5% non-fat dry milk powder (ICN) in buffer A (10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h. The membranes were incubated with either radiolabeled eIF2 (for blots containing eIF2B) or radiolabeled eIF2B (for blots containing eIF2) overnight at 4 °C. Prior to use as a probe, eIF2 was radiolabeled by phosphorylation using [32P]ATP and either heme-controlled repressor (HCR) to phosphorylate the α-subunit or PKA to phosphorylate the β-subunit (7Kimball S.R.

The blots were washed, incubated with radiolabeled probe, and then dried and exposed to film. Blots probed with biotinylated eIF2B were incubated with avidin coupled to horseradish peroxidase and then developed using an ECL detection kit from Amersham Life Sciences, Inc. An assay using 96-well microtitre plates was also used to examine the interprotein subunit interactions of eIF2 and eIF2B. In these experiments, one protein was placed in multiple wells of a 96-well plate, and the plate was incubated overnight at 4 °C. The wells were then washed with buffer A, blocked with buffer A containing 5% non-fat dry milk powder, and then washed with buffer A without milk powder. The wells then received various amounts of the second protein followed by incubation at room temperature for 2 h. The wells were washed and incubated with either an anti-eIF2Bε monoclonal antibody (11Kimball S.R. Karinch A.M. Feldhoff R.C. Mellor H. Jefferson L.S. Biochem. Biophys.

The wells were washed, incubated with anti-mouse IgG antibody coupled to alkaline phosphatase, and then developed with Sigma 104 phosphatase substrate. The results obtained were analyzed using a Molecular Devices microtitre plate reader. Recombinant baculoviruses containing cDNAs for the α-, β-, and γ-subunits of rat eIF2 were constructed using the Bac-to-Bac expression system (Life Technologies, Inc.). All constructs were made in the pFastBac1 vector. Each subunit of eIF2 was cloned with a 10-amino acid modified FLAG peptide (DYKDDDDKID) at the N terminus after the initial methionine. The cDNA for the rat eIF2α subunit (generously provided by Dr. J. W. B. Hershey, University of California) was cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the vector. The cDNA for the rat eIF2β subunit was cloned into the EcoRI and KpnI sites of the vector. The cDNA for rat eIF2γ was obtained by screening a rat brain cDNA library (Stratagene) using an expressed sequence-tagged clone (EST78998) with similarity to human eIF2γ, which yielded a partial length cDNA. The 5′ RACE system (Life Technologies, Inc.) was then used to obtain the 5′-end of the cDNA. A full-length cDNA for eIF2γ was reconstructed and cloned into the EcoRI and KpnI sites of the vector. The baculovirus constructs were transfected into Sf9 cells according to the Bac-to-Bac protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.), and recombinant baculovirus was obtained. Viruses underwent two rounds of amplification before use for protein production. Sf9 cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 10 or greater, grown in shaker flasks at 27 °C, and harvested after 2–3 days. The proteins expressed in Sf9 cells were immunoaffinity purified by chromatography on a matrix containing an immobilized anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Anti-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel, IBI/Kodak). Briefly, the cells were lysed in buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.5% sodium deoxychlolate, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.15 units/ml aprotinin, 20 μm leupeptin, 0.4 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.2 mm benzamidine), and the lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was mixed with 2 ml of affinity matrix for 2 h at 4 °C, and the mixture was then poured into a plastic column. The column was washed with 30 ml of buffer B followed by 30 ml of buffer C (20 mmTris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl), and the bound protein was eluted with 200 μg/ml FLAG octapeptide in buffer C. The protein was then concentrated using an Amicon Centricon concentrator and stored in aliquots at −70 °C. A binary complex consisting of purified rat liver eIF2 and [3H]GDP was formed as described previously (12Kimball S.R. Everson W.V. Flaim K.E. Jefferson L.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C28-C34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 3 μg of the eIF2·[3H]GDP complex was then phosphorylated at 30 °C with either CK-II (1 milliunit), PKA (300 units), or PKC (83 milliunits) in a reaction mixture containing 40 mmTris·HCl, pH 7.0, 11 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 8% glycerol, 80 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 μm [32P]ATP (4000 mCi/mmol). When eIF2 was phosphorylated with PKC, reactions additionally contained 40 μm phosphatidylserine and 0.5 mmCaCl2. The activity of eIF2B was measured as described previously (12Kimball S.R. Everson W.V. Flaim K.E. Jefferson L.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C28-C34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) except that the eIF2·[3H]GDP binary complex was phosphorylated with CK-II, PKA, PKC, or no added kinase and nonradiolabeled ATP as described above. The eIF2 and eIF2B holoproteins used in these studies were purified from rat liver to greater than 95% homogeneity (Fig. 1). Far Western blot analysis was used to identify the subunits of eIF2B to which eIF2 binds and vice versa. In the first set of studies, the subunits of eIF2B were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The membrane was then probed with eIF2 that had been phosphorylated using [32P]ATP and either HCR, to phosphorylate the α-subunit of eIF2, or PKA, to phosphorylate the β-subunit. As shown in Fig. 2, eIF2 that was radiolabeled on either the α- or β-subunit bound to both the δ- and ε-subunits of eIF2B, with binding to the δ-subunit being consistently stronger than to the ε-subunit. No binding of eIF2 to the α-, β-, or γ-subunits of eIF2B was detected. In the experiments shown in Fig. 2, the binding of eIF2 phosphorylated with HCR to eIF2Bε appeared to be weaker than that observed for eIF2 phosphorylated with PKA, suggesting that phosphorylation of eIF2 on the α-subunit decreased the affinity of eIF2 for eIF2Bε. However, this apparent difference was not consistent from experiment to experiment.Figure 2Far-Western analysis of the interprotein subunit interactions between eIF2 and eIF2B. The interactions among the subunits of eIF2 and eIF2B were examined by far-Western blot analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Inpanels A and B, approximately 7.5 μg of eIF2B was resolved on a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The membranes were probed with eIF2 that had been phosphorylated with [32P]ATP and either HCR (panel A) or PKA (panel B). In panels C and D, 7.5 μg of unphosphorylated eIF2 (lanes 1) or eIF2 that had been phosphorylated with nonradiolabeled ATP and HCR (lanes 2) was resolved on a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to PVDF. The membrane was probed with either biotinylated eIF2B (panel C) or eIF2B that had been phosphorylated with [32P]ATP and a mixture of GSK-3 and CK-I (panel D). The analyses were repeated at least three times for each condition with similar results. The results of typical blots are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In similar experiments, the binding of eIF2B to the subunits of eIF2 was examined by far-Western blot analysis. For these studies, an aliquot of eIF2 was phosphorylated with HCR with nonradiolabeled ATP, and phosphorylated and unphosphorylated eIF2 were electrophoresed in parallel lanes on a polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane, and the membrane was probed with eIF2B that had either been biotinylated or phosphorylated using [32P]ATP and a mixture of GSK-3 and CK-I. As shown in Fig. 2, eIF2B bound to the β-subunit of eIF2; no detectable binding of eIF2B to either the α- or γ-subunits of eIF2 was observed. Furthermore, both biotinylated and phosphorylated eIF2B bound exclusively to eIF2β, indicating that the method used to label eIF2B did not affect the interaction of the two proteins. It is noteworthy that phosphorylation of eIF2 by HCR did not promote binding of eIF2B to eIF2α. Because the finding that eIF2B did not bind to the α-subunit of eIF2 was so unexpected, we used a second method to examine the binding of the individual subunits of eIF2 to eIF2B. In these experiments, the subunits of eIF2 were individually expressed in Sf9 cells using the baculovirus system. Each of the subunits was expressed with an 8-amino acid extension, referred to as FLAG, at the N terminus of the protein to aid in purification and identification. As shown in the top panel of Fig. 3, immunoaffinity purification of the FLAG-tagged eIF2 subunits resulted in isolation of proteins that were greater than 90% homogeneous. The purified subunits were used to probe wells of a microtitre plate in which the eIF2B holoprotein had been immobilized. As shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 3, only the β-subunit of eIF2 exhibited significant binding to eIF2B. Similar to what was observed in the far-Western blot analysis, phosphorylation of eIF2α by HCR did not enhance binding of eIF2α to immobilized eIF2B. To identify the region of eIF2β to which eIF2B binds, two deletion mutants of the eIF2β cDNA were constructed where the C-terminal 65 or 133 amino acids (termed 268 and 200, respectively) were removed from the coding sequence. As shown in Fig. 4, removal of the C-terminal 65 residues reduced the binding of eIF2β to eIF2B by greater than 80%. No significant binding of the 200 mutant to eIF2B was detected. In an attempt to confirm the specificity of the interaction between eIF2B and the β-subunit of eIF2, the interactions between the wild-type and deletion mutants of eIF2β and the β-, δ-, and ε-subunits of eIF2B were examined. In these experiments, the β-, δ-, and ε-subunits of eIF2B were expressed in and purified from Sf9 cells using the baculovirus system (13Fabian J.R. Kimball S.R. Heinzinger N.D. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12359-12365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In confirmation of the results obtained by far-Western blot analysis, the isolated δ- and ε-subunits of eIF2B bound to wild-type eIF2β, whereas the β-subunit did not (Fig. 5). Furthermore, removal of the C-terminal 65 residues of eIF2β reduced the binding of both eIF2Bδ and ε by greater than 75%. These results confirm both the specificity of the interaction between the β-subunit of eIF2 and the δ- and ε-subunits of eIF2B as well as the importance of the C terminus of eIF2β in the interaction between eIF2 and eIF2B.Figure 5Binding of the individual subunits of eIF2B to deletion mutants of eIF2β. Two deletion mutants of the β-subunit of eIF2 were expressed in and purified from Sf9 cells as described in the legend to Fig. 4. In addition, the β-, δ-, and ε-subunits of eIF2B were expressed in Sf9 cells with the FLAG sequence at the N terminus as described previously (13Fabian J.R. Kimball S.R. Heinzinger N.D. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12359-12365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and purified as described for the subunits of eIF2 under “Experimental Procedures.” The binding of the individual subunits of eIF2B to full-length eIF2β and the eIF2β mutants was assessed by the protein interaction assay described under “Experimental Procedures.” In this analysis, approximately 3.3 μg of eIF2Bβ, δ, or ε was bound to wells of a microtitre plate and probed with either full-length eIF2β (wt), eIF2β truncated at amino acid 268 (268), or eIF2β truncated at amino acid 200 (200). Quantitation of the binding of eIF2β to eIF2B was assessed using an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. The results represent the mean ± S.E. of three determinations. n.d., none detectedView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In an attempt to gain greater insight into the interaction between the β-subunit of eIF2 and eIF2B, the amino acid sequence of eIF2β was submitted to the Protein Sequence Analysis server at the BioMolecular Engineering Research Center at Boston University (Boston, MA) for type 2 analysis for multimeric proteins. The secondary structure prediction indicates a high probability that the region of eIF2β, including amino acids 260–285, will form an α-helix. Most of the predicted α-helical structure is removed in the eIF2β deletion mutant truncated at amino acid 268, and the probability that the remainder of the domain will form an α-helix is greatly reduced. This result is noteworthy because of the finding in the present study that binding of the eIF2β 268 mutant to either wild-type eIF2B, eIF2Bδ, or eIF2Bε is reduced by greater than 75% compared with the full-length protein, suggesting that this putative α-helical domain is important in the interaction of the two proteins. A caveat to the above experiments is that they do not directly demonstrate an interaction between eIF2B and the C terminus of the β-subunit of eIF2. An alternative explanation for the results is that deletion of the C-terminal portion of the protein interferes with the correct folding of the remainder. If the correct folding of the remainder of the protein is prevented, but necessary for binding of eIF2B, then deletion of the C terminus could indirectly prevent binding of eIF2B to the β-subunit of eIF2. To demonstrate that the methods used above could detect a difference in affinity of eIF2B for eIF2 following phosphorylation of eIF2α, unphosphorylated eIF2 holoprotein and eIF2 holoprotein phosphorylated with HCR were bound to wells in parallel rows in a microtitre plate. The wells were then probed with various amounts of eIF2B, and the binding of eIF2B to eIF2 was quantitated using a monoclonal antibody to eIF2Bε. As shown in Fig. 6, the titration curve for the binding of eIF2B to eIF2 phosphorylated on the α-subunit was shifted to the left of the curve for binding to unphosphorylated eIF2. The amount of eIF2B required to obtain half-maximal binding to unphosphorylated eIF2 was approximately 3-fold greater than for the phosphorylated protein, suggesting that phosphorylation of eIF2 by HCR increases the affinity of eIF2B for eIF2 by a factor of ∼3. Finally, the effect of phosphorylation of the β-subunit of eIF2 on the activity of eIF2B was examined. The β-subunit of eIF2 is a substrate for at least three different protein kinases. CK-II phosphorylates Ser2 and Ser67, PKC phosphorylates Ser13, and PKA phosphorylates Ser218 (8Welsh G.I. Price N.T. Bladergroen B.A. Bloomberg G. Proud C.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 1279-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In these studies, the eIF2·[3H]GDP complex was formed and then phosphorylated with nonradiolabeled ATP using either CK-II, PKA, or PKC prior to use as a substrate for eIF2B. As shown in the top panel of Fig. 7, all three kinases incorporated similar amounts of radioactivity into the β-subunit of eIF2; no incorporation of 32P into eIF2β was observed in the absence of added kinase. Furthermore, no incorporation of 32P into eIF2α was observed (data not shown). Phosphorylation by either CK-II or PKC had no effect on the activity of eIF2B (Fig. 7, bottom panel). In contrast, phosphorylation of eIF2β by PKA stimulated the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of eIF2B by 44% (p < 0.01). Thus, phosphorylation of eIF2β in the C-terminal part of the protein, but not in the N-terminal region, resulted in stimulation of eIF2B activity. In this study we demonstrate for the first time the identification of the subunits of eIF2B to which eIF2 binds and the subunit of eIF2 to which eIF2B binds. We were surprised to find that eIF2B exhibits little or no binding to the α-subunit of eIF2 regardless of whether or not the α-subunit of eIF2 has been phosphorylated by the eIF2α kinase, HCR. Previous studies have shown that eIF2B has a greater affinity for eIF2 phosphorylated by HCR than for the unphosphorylated protein, suggesting that eIF2B might bind to eIF2α (4Goss D.J.

In two separate studies (5Rowlands A.G. Panniers R. Henshaw E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5526-5533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Dholakia J.N. Wahba A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 546-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the affinity of eIF2B for the eIF2·GDP binary complex was determined by kinetic analysis of the guanine nucleotide exchange reaction. In the reported studies, a comparison of the Km value obtained for eIF2·GDP with the KI value for eIF2(αP) suggested that the affinity of eIF2B for eIF2(αP) was 150-fold higher than that for unphosphorylated eIF2 (5Rowlands A.G. Panniers R. Henshaw E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5526-5533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A study using fluorescence anisotropy to determine the dissociation constants (KD) of the eIF2B·eIF2 and eIF2B·eIF2(αP) complexes also found that eIF2B has a higher affinity for eIF2(αP) than for unphosphorylated eIF2 although the difference in KD between phosphorylated and unphosphorylated eIF2 was only 2-fold in the presence of GDP (4Goss D.J. Parkhurst L.J. Mehta H.B. Woodley C.L. Wahba A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7374-7377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) rather than the 150-fold difference noted above (5Rowlands A.G. Panniers R. Henshaw E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5526-5533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was reported that the affinity of eIF2B for eIF2 varied 5-fold as GDP concentration was altered (4Goss D.J. Parkhurst L.J. Mehta H.B. Woodley C.L. Wahba A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7374-7377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, it was found that eIF2B had a 3-fold greater affinity for eIF2(αP) than for unphosphorylated eIF2, a value closer to that observed using fluorescence anisotropy (4Goss D.J. Parkhurst L.J. Mehta H.B. Woodley C.L. Wahba A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7374-7377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) than was seen using kinetic measurements (5Rowlands A.G. Panniers R. Henshaw E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5526-5533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although GDP was not included in the buffers in the present study, we have found that as much as 70% of the eIF2 purified from rat liver has GDP bound to it (unpublished observation), which may explain why the value obtained herein is closer to the lower of the two values reported by Goss et al. (4Goss D.J. Parkhurst L.J. Mehta H.B. Woodley C.L. Wahba A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7374-7377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The simplest explanation for the above observations is that phosphorylation of eIF2α results in a conformational change in the eIF2 holoprotein that alters the affinity of eIF2B for eIF2β. In support of this model, we have found that, like the eIF2B holoprotein, the α-subunit of eIF2 binds to eIF2β, 2S. R. Kimball, N. K. Heinzinger, R. L. Horetsky, and L. S. Jefferson, unpublished observations. which could provide a basis for a conformational change in eIF2β in response to phosphorylation of eIF2α. A second explanation for the observations is that, in addition to binding to the β-subunit of eIF2, eIF2B might bind to an area on eIF2 that is shared between the individual subunits and would only be detected when the subunits were present in the holoprotein. Such an interaction would not have been detected by far-Western analysis. In the present study we also obtained the novel finding that eIF2 binds to the δ- and ε-subunits of eIF2B. In related studies inSaccharomyces cerevisiae, Hinnebusch and co-workers (15Vazquez de Aldana C.R. Hinnebusch A.G. Molec. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3208-3222Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) have identified point mutations in the α-, β-, and δ-subunits of eIF2B that result in a phenotype characterized by an apparent insensitivity to phosphorylation of eIF2α. Based on these results, it was proposed that the α-, β-, and δ-subunits of S. cerevisiae eIF2B perform a regulatory role in recognizing that the α-subunit of eIF2 is phosphorylated and that one or more of this group of subunits binds to eIF2. However, of the three subunits, it is unlikely that the primary interaction between eIF2 and eIF2B occurs through binding of eIF2 to the α-subunit of eIF2B because cells deleted for eIF2Bα grow at the same rate as wild-type cells, whereas deletion of any of the other four subunits of eIF2B is lethal (reviewed in Ref. 16Hinnebusch A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 409-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In the model proposed by Hinnebusch (16Hinnebusch A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 409-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), the remaining two subunits, i.e. the γ- and ε-subunits, would presumably play a role in catalyzing the guanine nucleotide exchange reaction. The results of the present study confirm the postulate that eIF2 binds to the δ-subunit of eIF2B but do not support a model where eIF2 binds to either the α- or β-subunits of eIF2B. In summary, the present study reports the identification of the subunits of eIF2 and eIF2B that interact with each other and suggest that eIF2B binds to the C terminus of eIF2β. The results presented herein both cast doubt on the long held belief that eIF2B binds to the α-subunit of eIF2 and require the construction of new models where the predominant interactions between eIF2B and eIF2 occur through the C terminus of the β-subunit of eIF2 and the δ- and ε-subunits of eIF2B.

Chem. 1992; 267: 16317-16322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, it is seen to change from moderate to undetectable levels when transformed undifferentiated PC12 cells differentiate into nonmalignant neuron cells (10Claffey K.P. Wilkison W.O. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16317-16322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies have revealed that VEGF expression is specifically regulated in a transformed cell line and is closely relevant to the process of cellular differentiation. Enomotoet al. (14Enomoto T. Okamoto T. Sato J.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 1716-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) have demonstrated VEGF-induced disorganization of actin stress fibers that is accompanied by drastic morphological rounding of Balb/c 3T3 cells. This alteration of cytoskeletal organization has been shown to occur by receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins. It has been shown that the VEGF receptors, flk-1/KDR and flt-1, are abundantly expressed in endothelial cells and are essential for hematopoietic and vascular development (15Shalaby F. Rossant J. Yamaguchi T.P. Gertsenstein M. Wu X.-F. Breitman M.L. Schuh A.C. Nature. 1995; 376: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (3361) Google Scholar,16Fong G.-H. Rossant J. Gertsenstein M. Breitman M.L. Nature. 1995; 376: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (2216) Google Scholar). On the other hand, cell types such as bovine corneal endothelial cells, HeLa cells, and human melanoma cells possess cell surface VEGF receptors although these do not proliferate in response to VEGF (2Neufeld G. Tessler S. Gitay-Goren H. Cohen T. Levi B.Z. Progr. Growth Factor Res. 1994; 5: 89-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Whereas mitogenic and angiogenic effects of VEGF have been widely studied for endothelial cells, the significance of VEGF and its receptor expression in some nonendothelial cells remain unknown to date. While characterizing the spontaneously immortalized mouse fibroblast RS-4, an immortalized clone from CD1-ICR mouse embryonic fibroblasts (CMEFs) (17Kaul S.C. Wadhwa R. Sugihara T. Obuchi K. Komatsu Y. Mitsui Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1201: 389-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we initially concluded that the conditioned medium from RS-4 cells has growth-supporting activity for human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The activity factor was purified and characterized as VEGF by amino acid analysis (18Sugihara T. Kaul S.C. Mitsui Y. Wadhwa R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). By using VEGF 164 primers, we detected an up-regulation of VEGF expression in RS-4 cells as compared with CMEFs. In addition to the three known alternatively spliced forms (VEGF 120, VEGF 164, and VEGF 188), a fourth form of VEGF was detected by RT-PCR as a 304-bp fragment (18Sugihara T. Kaul S.C. Mitsui Y. Wadhwa R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the present study, we report a cloning and characterization of a cDNA that encodes a protein of 141 amino acid residues containing 26 amino acids residues of signal sequence (thus named VEGF 115). Functional analysis determined it to be a specific endothelial mitogen, and it corresponds to the FGF-replacing factor in the conditioned medium of RS-4 cells, identified in our previous study. Genomic characterization revealed that VEGF 115 is the fourth alternatively spliced form of murine VEGF gene. Embryonic fibroblasts (CMEFs) were isolated from CD1-ICR strain of mice as described earlier (19Wadhwa R. Kaul S.C. Ikawa Y. Sugimoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6615-6621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These were regularly maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimal essential medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Bio Cell), penicillin, streptomycin (Sigma), and fungizone (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Spontaneously immortalized clones arising from CMEFs during the end phase of their life span were isolated and cloned (17Kaul S.C. Wadhwa R. Sugihara T. Obuchi K. Komatsu Y. Mitsui Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1201: 389-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). RS-4 cells that represent stage II of immortalization were used for the present study. These cells could grow on serum-free medium and were also detected to harbor a growth-supporting factor(s) for fibroblasts and endothelial cells (HUVECs) in their conditioned medium. HUVECs were isolated and maintained as described (20Kumazaki T. Kobayashi M. Mitsui Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 205: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). They were cultured in MCDB 151 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 15% FCS, 5 μg/ml heparin (Sigma), and 10 ng/ml FGF-1 in culture flasks precoated with bovine fibronectin (1 μg/cm2). Total cellular RNA (1 μg) from RS-4 cells was annealed with random hexanucleotides and reverse transcribed for 75 min at 37 °C using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described earlier (18Sugihara T. Kaul S.C. Mitsui Y. Wadhwa R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was then heated at 95 °C for 5 min and chilled on ice. PCR was performed on 118th of the RT mixture by using AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin Elmer Corp.), VEGF 164 sense (bp 248–267, 5′-TGAGACCCTGGTGGACATCT-3′) and antisense (bp 640–658, 5′-CACCGCCTCGGCTTGTCAC-3′) primers (18Sugihara T. Kaul S.C. Mitsui Y. Wadhwa R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) under the conditions of 94 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 3 min, for a total of 30 cycles. The PCR product was purified (Geneclean II kit, BIO 101, Inc.) and cloned in pT7-blue TA cloning vector (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI) from which the insert could be released byEcoRI and PstI digestion. The cloned DNA was sequenced on automated DNA sequencer (ABI model 370A) following the manufacturer's protocols. Northern blot containing poly(A+) RNA from mouse tissues was bought fromCLONTECH. Hybridization was performed with a VEGF 115-specific probe that was obtained by Klew reaction using a 130-bp fragment as template and VEGF 115-specific primer. Hybridization was performed in rapid hybridization buffer (Amersham Corp.). The membrane was striped in boiling 0.5% SDS for 5–10 min and reprobed with VEGF 164 probe. Finally, the membrane was probed with β-actin for loading control. Total RNA was extracted from various tissues and cells with Isogen reagent (NIPPON Gene Corp., Japan). RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript reverse transcriptase at 37 °C for 1 h (18Sugihara T. Kaul S.C. Mitsui Y. Wadhwa R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). PCR was performed with VEGF 164 sense (5′- GATCAAGTTCATGGACGTCT-3′) and VEGF 115-specific antisense (5′-CCAAAAGTTTCCCAGGCA-3′) primers using Taq polymerase for 40 cycles (at 94, 58, and 72 °C) of amplification. The control PCR was performed with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase sense (5′-TTCATTGACCTCAACTACATG-3′) and antisense (5′-GTGGCAGTGATGGCATGGAC-3′) primers. Mouse genomic DNA (CLONTECH) was used for control PCRs. The ectopic gene expression in NIH 3T3 was examined by PCR with the sense (5′-TGTTGCCTTTACTTCTAGGCCTGTACGGAA-3′) and antisense (5′-CAGCACTGATCCACGATGCCGCGCTTCTGC-3′) primers from the vector sequences at an annealing temperature of 58 °C. VEGF 120 RT-PCR was performed with sense (5′-TCCAGGAGTACCCCGACGAG-3′) and antisense (5′-TCACCGCCTTGGCTCGTCAC-3′) primers using Taq polymerase (at 94, 58, and 72 °C). The purified DNA containing the full open reading frame for VEGF was cloned in pQE-32 vector (Qiagen Inc.), which was then expressed in M15 Escherichia coli cells in the presence of isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside. The bacterial pellet was sonicated and boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). After centrifugation at 15000 rpm, the protein sample was resolved on 15% SDS-PAGE followed by Western analysis (22Blake M.S. Johnson K.H. Russel-Jones G.J. Gotschlich E.C. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 136: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar) with anti-His tag antibody (Qiagen Inc.) and anti-VEGF antibody (a kind gift from Dr. S. Kondo) (23Kondo S. Matsumoto T. Yokoyama Y. Ohmori I. Suzuki H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1243: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Mouse P1 library was screened by PCR primers specific for VEGF 115 (sense, 5′-GTGGGCACCTGAGGCACA-3′, and antisense, 5′- CCAAAAGTTTCCCAGGCA-3′; amplicon size, 110 bp); VEGF 164 (sense, 5′-CACTGTGAGCCTTGTTCAGAG-3′, and antisense, 5′- CTGCAAGTACGTTCGTTTAA-3′; amplicon size, 131 bp) (Genome Systems Inc.). Three P1 clones were obtained by these two independent screenings. Each of these three clones (3 μg) was digested with EcoRI-SalI-SphI, HindIII-PvuII-SpeI, and EcoRI-PstI-XhoI at 37 °C overnight and hybridized with VEGF 115- and VEGF 164-specific probes obtained by the above described PCR (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A common probe for VEGF 164 and VEGF 115 was prepared by PCR amplification of exon 3 by sense (5′-GATCAAGTTCATGGACGTCT-3′) and antisense (5′-ATGTTGCTCTCTGACGTGGG-3′) primers; amplicon size, 186 bp. Southern hybridization was carried out at 65 °C for 24 h in 5× saline/sodium/phosphate/EDTA, 5× Denhardt's solution, and 0.5% SDS. Filters were washed twice with 1× saline/sodium/phosphate/EDTA and 1.0% SDS for 15 min at 65 °C. The membrane was exposed to Kodak XAR-2 film with an intensifying screen at −70 °C for 1–2 days. The VEGF 115 was first cloned and confirmed for its sequence in pT7-Blue vector (Novagen). EcoRI-PstI fragment from pT7-Blue vector was next cloned into expression vector CMVneo+ (a kind gift from Olivia M. Pereira-Smith, Baylor College of Medicine). Plasmids containing accurate sequence for VEGF were obtained. Expression vector was mixed with Tfx-50 Reagent (Promega), and added to the NIH 3T3 culture at 60% confluency. Transfectants were selected in 500 μg/ml G418-supplemented growth medium. About 6–10 clones were isolated from each transfection by cloning rings, which were subsequently maintained in 100 μg/ml G418-supplemented medium. The individual transfectants were selected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% FCS and 500 μg/ml G418. Upon confluence, the cells were cultured without G418 for a day, and the cultured medium was collected and assayed for its mitogenic activity by incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA of endothelial cells. Endothelial cells were plated at 2 × 104 cells/0.5 ml/well into 24-well tissue culture plates (Falcon) coated with fibronectin. After incubation in a growth medium with FGF-1 for 24 h, the medium was replaced with MCDB151 medium supplemented with 15% FCS (starvation medium). At 24 h, endothelial cells were subjected to the fresh starvation medium supplemented (1:10) with the test sample (conditioned medium or its purified fractions). At 16 h after the initial addition of the test sample, [3H]thymidine was added and the cells were labeled for the next 6 h. The cells were then washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and trypsinized at 37 °C. The solution was collected on a glass fiber filter and washed using a cell harvester (LABO-MASH, Labo Science Co.). The radioactivities were counted by a liquid scintillation counter. A 304-bp fragment amplified from RS-4 cells (an immortal clone from CD1-ICR embryonic fibroblasts) reacted to the VEGF probe on Southern analysis by RT-PCR with VEGF primers, indicating that this may represent a fourth form of VEGF (18Sugihara T. Kaul S.C. Mitsui Y. Wadhwa R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of this band indeed showed 36.7% homology to the 411-nucleotide sequence of VEGF 164 obtained in the same RT-PCR amplification (18Sugihara T. Kaul S.C. Mitsui Y. Wadhwa R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). 151 of 304 nucleotides aligned completely to the VEGF 164 sequence, and 153 nucleotides showed a novel identity. By the use of a sense primer from 5′ upstream sequence of VEGF 164 and an antisense primer from the novel sequence from our RT-PCR amplified 304-bp VEGF fragment, a second RT-PCR was performed on the RNA from RS-4 cells. A 458-bp band was obtained that has a single open reading frame of 423 bp, yielding a protein of 141 amino acid residues that contained a signal sequence of 26 amino acid residues, reported earlier for three known forms of VEGF (9Potgens A.J. Lubsen N.H. van Altena M.C. Vermeulen R. Bakker A. Schoenmakers J.G. Ruiter D.J. de Waal R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32879-32885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); it thus can yield a mature protein of 115 amino acid residues, named VEGF 115 (Fig. 1 A). This protein is identical to the three known forms of VEGF (9Potgens A.J. Lubsen N.H. van Altena M.C. Vermeulen R. Bakker A. Schoenmakers J.G. Ruiter D.J. de Waal R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32879-32885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for 104 amino acid residues, including 26 amino acid residues of the signal sequence, and has 37 novel amino acids at the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 1 B). Structural analysis of VEGF 115 revealed its similarity to VEGF 120, except that the carboxyl-terminal novel sequence that confers it has a β sheet structure instead of a turn present in VEGF 120 (Fig. 1 C). VEGF 188 and VEGF 164 have been characterized as basic proteins with high affinity for heparin. In contrast, VEGF 120 is a weakly acidic protein with no affinity for heparin (25Houck K.A. Leung D.W. Rowland A.M. Winer J. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26031-26037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to VEGF 120, VEGF 115 did not show binding to heparin (data not shown). We next analyzed VEGF 115 expression in various mouse tissues. VEGF 115-specific sequence reacted to a single transcript of approximately 4.0 kb in multiple mouse tissues (Fig. 2 A). The filter was striped and reprobed with VEGF 164 probe. The latter reacted to four transcripts, including the one recognized by VEGF 115 sequence (data not shown). To exclude the differences in RNA loading on Northern blot, the RT-PCR with VEGF 115-specific primers was performed on mouse tissue RNA. The highest level of expression was detected in both spleen and kidney (Fig. 2 B), in contrast to the VEGF 120 and VEGF 164 expression, which were found to be predominant in spleen (Fig. 2) and kidney (26Bacic M. Edwards N.A. Merrill M.J. Growth Factors. 1995; 12: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), respectively. Mouse genomic DNA was used for PCRs in parallel. It did not yield any equivalent amplification (data not shown), supporting the idea that the amplified band did not result from contamination of genomic DNA. The presence of VEGF 115 transcript in tissues that also harbor VEGF 120 and VEGF 164 suggests that VEGF 115 is not a tissue-specific isoform of the other three known forms of VEGF. High expression of VEGF in kidney has been attributed to the extensive vascularization of this tissue. In addition, a high level of expression of VEGF 115 in spleen and testis may relate to the proliferative potential of these tissues. VEGF 115 RT-PCR was performed on RNA from normal (CMEF) and an immortal (RS-4) mouse fibroblasts. A significant increase in expression level of VEGF 115 was detected during spontaneous immortalization of CMEFs (Fig. 3), whereas VEGF 120 amplification from the same cells yielded substantially different results. The data suggested a functional relevance of VEGF 115 to spontaneous immortalization or, in other words, a divisional phenotype of cells. We have previously reported that FGF-replacing activity for HUVECs is present in the conditioned medium of RS-4 cells, which represent immortalized stage II as defined by their growth properties, p81/ezrin, and p53 expression and is not detected in CMEFs (normal) and NIH 3T3 cells that represent immortalized stage I (18Sugihara T. Kaul S.C. Mitsui Y. Wadhwa R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A high expression of VEGF 115 in RS-4 cells but not in CMEFs (Fig. 3) and NIH 3T3 (data not shown) thus suggests that VEGF 115 may correspond to the FGF-replacing factor in the conditioned medium of RS-4 cells.Figure 3Expression levels of VEGF 115 and VEGF 120 in normal (CMEF) and immortal (RS-4) mouse fibroblasts. RT-PCR amplification of VEGF 115 and VEGF 120 from cells at different population doublings is shown as the ethidium bromide signal. Its quantitation was performed with respect to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase amplification from the same samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A 423-bp open reading frame, as detected from the sequence analysis of the VEGF cDNA clone, was confirmed by its cloning in a bacterial expression vector, pQE32 (Qiagen) and expression as a His-tagged 17-kDa protein by isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside induction in bacteria (Fig. 4 B). The recombinant protein was also detected with anti-VEGF antibody (Fig. 4 A) in addition to an anti-His tag antibody confirming its identity as a new form of VEGF protein. VEGF 115 was cloned in mammalian expression vector pCMVneo+and transfected to NIH 3T3 cells. Stable transfectants were selected in G418 (500 μg/ml) supplemented growth medium and were examined for VEGF 115 expression by RT-PCR with vector primers (Fig. 5 A). A 642-bp band was clearly detected in VEGF transfectants, whereas controls (vector-transfected cells) did not exhibit any equivalent RT-PCR amplification. The amplified band was confirmed to be VEGF 115 by its sequence analysis. The conditioned medium from three stable transfectants was further analyzed for its growth-promoting effect on HUVECs. The latter require FGF or VEGF for their entry into the cell cycle. We had earlier detected an FGF/VEGF-replacing activity in the conditioned medium of RS-4 but not NIH 3T3 cells. We found that HUVECs did not grow when cultured in the presence of conditioned medium of control transfectants. However, when supplemented with the conditioned medium (1:10) from VEGF-transfected NIH 3T3 clones, HUVECs exhibited [3H]TdR incorporation (Fig. 5 B) and also showed an increase in cell number. The conditioned medium from a VEGF 164 stable transfectant was also analyzed for comparative mitogenic activity. The effect of conditioned medium from VEGF 115 and VEGF 164 was significant as compared with the control. Although the effect of VEGF 115 appeared to be higher than that of VEGF 164 when an equal amount of the conditioned medium was used for mitogenic assay for HUVECs, the expression levels of VEGF 115 and VEGF 164 and the amount of respective proteins in conditioned medium of the transfectants were not estimated due to the lack of VEGF 115-specific antibodies at present. Therefore, comparative mitogenicity of VEGF 115 and VEGF 164 could not be estimated from the present data. Supplementation of growth medium of HUVECs with 1:10 of the conditioned medium from VEGF 115 transfectants exhibited an effect equivalent to the supplementation of the medium with FGF-1 (3 ng/ml). Therefore, the data that can be identified as VEGF 115 correspond to the FGF-1-replacing factor identified from the conditioned medium of RS-4 cells in our earlier study. Mouse P1 library was screened by PCR with primers specific for VEGF 115 and VEGF 164 (Genome Systems, Inc.). These two independent screenings resulted in an isolation of three clones in each case that were analyzed on Southern blot with common probes, as well as probes specific for VEGF 164 and VEGF 115 (Fig. 6). Hybridization of the EcoRI-SalI-SphI, HindIII-PvuII-SpeI, and EcoRI-PstI-XhoI-digested P1 clone with the region of cDNA that is common between VEGF 164 and VEGF 115 (exon 3) yielded only a single band with each of the enzymes, indicating that it is a single copy gene (Fig. 6 B), as has been reported earlier (8Shima D.T. Kuroki M. Deutsch U. Ng Y.-S. Adamis A.P. D'Amore P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3877-3883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the three P1 isolates gave identical result on Southern analysis, indicating that the three clones are identical and represent a mouse VEGF gene. An identical blot was probed with VEGF 115-specific probe (novel sequence). It hybridized to a single band in each of the three digests described above, and the bands were identical for three P1 clones. The pattern was also similar to the one obtained with the exon 3 probe. This result strongly suggests that VEGF 164- and 115-specific sequences align closely on the mouse gene, especially when it is considered that the Southern blot assay was performed on P1 DNA digested with a combination of three restriction enzymes in each lane (Fig. 6). A third, identical blot was hybridized to a VEGF 164-specific (exon 7) probe. It also identified a single band from each of the three above digests. As expected from the VEGF gene structure (8Shima D.T. Kuroki M. Deutsch U. Ng Y.-S. Adamis A.P. D'Amore P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3877-3883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), the size of the band was different from the one identified by exon 3 and VEGF 115 probes. The possibility of occurrence of two genes in a tandem repeat can be ruled out by the fact that the signal on Southern blot with VEGF 164 and VEGF 115 common probes (exon 3) was not double as compared with the one obtained by VEGF 164-specific probes. Thus, these data are strongly suggestive of VEGF 115 as a novel alternatively spliced form of mouse VEGF. Taken together, our results have shown that FGF replacing activity for HUVECs in the conditional medium of RS-4 cells is caused by a novel alternatively spliced form of VEGF, VEGF 115. In addition, an angiogenic function that has been demonstrated for different forms of VEGF, a proliferation-associated function of VEGF 115, is suggested from the up-regulation of VEGF 115 with spontaneous immortalization of fibroblasts and high expression in spleen and testis. A precise mechanism of alternative splicing awaits intron characterization of murine VEGF gene. We thank Dr. J. Fukami for helpful discussions, T. Matsuda for technical assistance, and Dr. S. Kondo (Toagosei Chemical Industry, Co., Ltd.) for anti-VEGF antibody."

The binding of the inhibitorS-(p-nitrobenzyl)-glutathione to the carboxymethylated enzyme results in a partial restructuring of the disordered area. The modification of Cys-47 sterically hinders structural organization of this region, and although it does not prevent glutathione binding, it significantly reduces the affinity.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 576-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The different classes show different active site structures, in particular at the hydrophobic subsite (for reviews see Refs. 18Dirr H. Reinemer P. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 645-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar and 19Wilce M.C.J. Parker M.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1205: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Despite these differences it is believed that they all share a similar catalytic mechanism where the thiol group of glutathione is activated to thiolate. The reactive ionized S− group attacks the electrophilic group of the hydrophobic substrate leading to a glutathione S-conjugate with increased aqueous solubility (20Armstrong R.N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1991; 4: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). How the activation of glutathione is achieved by the enzyme is unclear. The three-dimensional structures of Pi class GSTs complexed with different inhibitors have shown that the only residue of the enzyme in close proximity to the sulfur atom of glutathione is Tyr-7. Until the first GST structure was solved (8Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Ladenstein R. Schäffer J. Gallay O. Huber R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1997-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), Cys-47 was considered a catalytic residue because its modification inactivated the enzyme (21Tamai K. Satoh K. Tsuchida S. Hatayama I. Maki T. Sato K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 167: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 22Caccuri A.M. Petruzzelli R. Polizio F. Federici G. Desideri A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 297: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure, however, revealed that Cys-47 is over 12 Å away from the active pocket. This residue is located in helix 310B at the C terminus of helix αB. This helical structure was found to have high temperature factors and exposed hydrophobic residues (12Garcı́a-Sáez I. Párraga A. Phillips M.F. Mantle T.J. Coll M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 298-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and the hypothesis was put forward that it could be disordered in the uncomplexed enzyme. The hypothesis that the “free” enzyme (i.e. with no GSH or GS-conjugates bound) has a structure different from that seen when GSH or GS conjugates are bound has been implicated in a number of studies. We currently have structures for mGST P1-1 withS-hexylglutathione, S-(p-nitrobenzyl)glutathione (12Garcı́a-Sáez I. Párraga A. Phillips M.F. Mantle T.J. Coll M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 298-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and GSH 2A. Párraga, I. Garcı́a-Sáez, S. B. Walsh, T. J. Mantle, and M. Coll, submitted for publication. bound, and in all of these the thiol of Cys-47 is not accessible to solvent. Indeed this appears to be a feature of all class Pi structures solved to date (8Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Ladenstein R. Schäffer J. Gallay O. Huber R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1997-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar,9Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Ladenstein R. Huber R. Lo Bello M. Federici G. Parker M.W. J. Mol.

This is important because some authors (23Tamai K. Shen H. Tsuchida S. Hatayama I. Satoh K. Yasui A. Oikawa A. Sato K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 24Nishihara T. Maeda H. Okamoto K. Oshida T. Mizoguchi T. Terada T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 174: 580-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 25Shen H. Tamai K. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Tsuchida S. Sato K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 286: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) have presented a considerable body of evidence that implicates the availability of cysteine 47 for mixed disulfide formation as a redox sensor. Cystine forms a mixed disulfide with GST P1-1 in agreement with this hypothesis (24Nishihara T. Maeda H. Okamoto K. Oshida T. Mizoguchi T. Terada T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 174: 580-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This is attractive as GST P1-1 is almost unique in having a thiol (Cys-47) that appears to be unreactive when GSH is bound to the enzyme but that may be alkylated or oxidized in the absence of GSH (or GS-conjugates). Indeed we have shown that the kinetics of protection against alkylation by GS-conjugates are entirely consistent with such a hypothesis (26Phillips M.F. Mantle T.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The simplest model to explain this behavior involves at least two conformations for GST P1-1. For the “free” enzyme the thiol of Cys-47 is reactive and exposed to solvent, whereas the binding of GSH or GS-conjugates stabilizes a distinct conformation (seen in the numerous crystal structures solved to date) where the thiol of Cys-47 becomes inaccessible to solvent and thiol reagents. It should be made clear that binding of GS- conjugates does not physically occlude thiol reagents from access to the thiol of Cys-47 because the side chain is in a small hydrophobic pocket on the outer face of the αB-310B helices that form the GSH binding site. It has not been possible to crystallize the “free” enzyme for GSTP1-1 to date. We argued that alkylation of cysteine 47 may trap the “free” enzyme in a distinct conformation that permits further analysis and this has proved correct. Also it has been proposed that Tyr-7 might be in the tyrosinate form in the free enzyme acting as a general base and activating the thiol group of glutathione by proton abstraction (8Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Ladenstein R. Schäffer J. Gallay O. Huber R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1997-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 27Meyer D.J. Xia C. Coles B. Chen H. Reinemer P. Huber P. Ketterer B.

Chem. 1993; 268: 19188-19191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) when the substrate binds to the active site. However, to date no structure of an unliganded Pi class GST has been reported, and Dirr et al.(18Dirr H. Reinemer P. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 645-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) have reviewed a number of observations inconsistent with the tyrosinate hypothesis. We have solved the three-dimensional structure of the mouse liver GST P1-1 enzyme modified by iodoacetic acid at Cys-47 to form the carboxymethylated enzyme (referred to as CM-mGST P1-1 from now on) in an unliganded form and withS-(p-nitrobenzyl)glutathione bound at the active site. The carboxymethylated enzyme shows a complete disorder in the αB-310B region with a partial destruction of the active site architecture. However, the environment of Tyr-7 remains unchanged in the free enzyme with no indication of an ionized state for this residue. On the other hand the binding of the inhibitor, S-(p-nitrobenzyl)glutathione, results in a limited restructuring of the disordered area. The results presented here provide a structural explanation for the effect of the chemical modification of Cys-47 and suggest that Tyr-7 is not acting as a general base. It is presently unclear whether carboxymethylation is locking the enzyme in a conformer of the native enzyme, and further work is required to investigate this. Modified mouse liver GST P1-1 was prepared by incubating 18 mg of the native enzyme (26Phillips M.F. Mantle T.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) with 200 mm iodoacetic acid in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8, in a final volume of 10 ml for 40 min and then removing excess iodoacetic acid by gel filtering on Sephadex G-25 equilibrated in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7. The modified enzyme does not bind to glutathione-Sepharose, so to ensure that any residual native enzyme was removed, the modified preparation was passed through this affinity resin, and the protein that eluted in the wash through was pooled, concentrated using an Amicon filter, and stored at −20 °C. This material, homogenous by the criteria of SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and exhibiting a pI of 8.2 (29Walsh S.B. Mantle T.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 485SCrossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) exhibits a marked increase in the KmGSH (see below). Suitable crystals of CM-mGST P1-1 were grown by vapor diffusion at room temperature from hanging drops prepared by mixing 3 μl of protein solution (7 mg/ml) and 3 μl of precipitant solution containing 33 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7, 64 mm CaCl2, and 8.3% PEG 4000. The drops were equilibrated against a reservoir of 19% PEG 4000, 0.15 m CaCl2, 75 mmHepes buffer. Long prismatic crystals appeared after 1 week. Three-dimensional diffraction data were collected up to 1.9 Å resolution, at 4 °C, using the X11 station, the European Molecular Biology Laboratory at the Deutsches Elektronensynchrotron (λ = 0.937 Å). Because of the intensity decay three crystals of approximate size 0.7 × 0.2 × 0.2 mm were necessary to collect a full data set. Images were taken in one-degree rotation steps with the detector set at 165-mm distance. The crystals are tetragonal space group I4, with unit cell dimensions a =b = 132.5 Å and c = 63.2 Å, and have one dimer/asymmetric unit. The data were processed with the XDS package (30Kabsch W. J.

Open table in a new tab Crystals of CM-mGST P1-1 complexed withS-(p-nitrobenzyl)glutathione were grown at room temperature from hanging drops. The best crystals appeared by mixing 3 μl of protein solution (7 mg/ml), 1 μl of 20% PEG 8000 in 0.1m MOPS buffer, pH 6.4, and 0.2 m of ammonium sulfate and 2 μl of inhibitor saturated solution in 0.1 mMES buffer at pH 7.5. The drops were equilibrated against 10% PEG 8000, 50 mm MOPS buffer. After 10 days needle-like crystals grew to a size of 0.6 × 0.2 × 0.1 mm. The crystals diffracted weakly on a rotating anode. However, a 3 Å data set could be collected at the BW7B station, the European Molecular Biology Laboratory at the Deutsches Elektronensynchrotron (λ = 0.869 Å), at 4 °C. The crystals are orthorhombic space group P212121 and with cell dimensionsa = 62.45, b = 132.69, and c = 214.47 Å and have three protein dimers in the asymmetric unit. The data were processed with DENZO (32Otwinowski, Z., Proceedings of the CCP 4 Study Weekend: Data Collection and Processing, January 29–30 1993, Sawyer, L., Isaacs, N., Bailey, S., 1993, 56, 62, Daresbury Laboratory, England.Google Scholar). Intensity data statistics are given in Table I. The coordinates from the mGST P1-1 enzyme as in the S-(p-nitrobenzyl)glutathione complex structure (Protein Data Bank code 1glq) (12Garcı́a-Sáez I. Párraga A. Phillips M.F. Mantle T.J. Coll M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 298-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) were used as a starting model for the determination of both structures by molecular replacement with AMoRe (33Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr Sec. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5029) Google Scholar). The solution for the unliganded form was found using two independent monomers as initial model and a resolution range of 12–4 Å. After the rigid body refinement routine of AMoRe, the correlation coefficient (for Fobs) was 0.75, and the R-factor was 0.303. A combined x-ray and energy minimization refinement followed with XPLOR (34Brünger A.T. XPLOR, version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven1992Google Scholar), including cycles of simulated annealing. In the refinement process 10% of the reflections were set aside for the R-free calculation (35Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3863) Google Scholar). Fourier electron density maps were calculated at 3 Å resolution with coefficients 2Fo −Fc and Fo −Fc and displayed using TURBO (36Rousell A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, California1991Google Scholar). Most of the molecule fitted correctly in the electron density except for residues 35–51, where the electron density was absent in the maps contoured at 1 and 2 ς, respectively. No protein atoms could be located in this area. Further refinement cycles followed adding solvent molecules and slowly increasing the resolution up to 2.0 Å. Atomic isotropic B factors were refined with restraints imposed on atoms directly bonded. At this stage the R-cryst was 0.197, and the R-free was 0.236. A final run of positional and B-factor refinement was carried out including all data consisting in 26183 reflections (Fobs > 2ςFobs) in the resolution range 8.0–2.0 Å. This resulted in a final R-factor of 0.195 (Table II). The final structure consists of 385 protein residues of 418 amino acids of the chemical sequence and 150 solvent molecules.Table IIRefinement statisticsCM-mGST2-aCys-47-carboxymethylated mGST P1–1.CM-mGSTNB2-bCys-47-carboxymethylated mGST P1–1 complexed withS-(p-nitrobenzyl)glutathione.Resolution range in Å8.0–2.08.0–3.0Number of reflections2618323892[F0> 2ς(F0)][F0 >1.5ς(F0)]Total number of atoms (excluding hydrogens)321410128Number of solvent molecules150R-cryst2-cR-factor = Σ‖‖Fobs‖ − ‖Fcalc‖‖/Σ‖Fobs‖.

Open table in a new tab To solve the structure of CM-mGST P1-1 complexed withS-(p-nitrobenzyl)glutathione, three dimers of mGST P1-1 were used as initial model. After the rigid body refinement routine of AMoRe, a correlation coefficient (forFobs) of 0.53 and an R-factor of 43.7% were obtained for the correct solution. Refinement of the structure followed with MAIN (37Turk D. MAIN 96. Macromolecular Computing School, Seattle, WA1996Google Scholar), omitting the area corresponding to the α-helix B that was disordered in the unliganded structure. Initially, the noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) operators relating the two monomers in each dimer and the three dimers of the asymmetric unit were determined from the molecular model. With these symmetry operators and masks build around the molecules, the map was subject to 6-fold density averaging and solvent flattening. Iterative cycles of density averaging and refinement of the NCS operators followed, maximizing the correlation among the six monomers. After this procedure, inspection of the active sites in 3 Å resolution Fourier maps showed clear electron density corresponding to the inhibitor molecules. The inhibitorS-(p-nitrobenzyl)glutathione was fitted in the electronic density (Fig. 1). Also part of the disordered area in the unliganded enzyme now showed clear density, and the protein model was build accordingly. Further refinement of the model using NCS restraints was performed with MAIN giving an R-factor of 0.27. Simulated annealing and positional refinement with XPLOR followed, setting aside 5% of the reflections for R-free calculation. After NCS-restrained B-factor refinement, the R-cryst was 0.246, and the R-free 0.277 (Table II). Because of the limited resolution of this data set, we decided to conclude the refinement process at this point, not including solvent molecules and not breaking the NCS restraints to maintain a reasonable parameter/data ratio. The final structure consists of three protein dimers of 398 residues each of 418 amino acids of the chemical sequence and 6 inhibitor molecules. Atomic coordinates and structure factors for both the unliganded and complexed CM-mGST-π structures have been deposited with the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank. The global fold of the unliganded CM-mGST P1-1, excluding residues 34–51, is similar to that of the native enzyme when complexed with glutathione adducts. The rms deviation in the Cα positions is 0.33 Å between molecule A of the present structure and molecule A in the S-(p-nitrobenzyl)glutathione complex structure. Other comparisons show similar values. The rmsdifference between monomers in the present structure is 0.107 Å. The main difference with the native complexed structure is at helix αB and the following 310 helix. These helices form the external wall of the active site (Fig. 2, in red). Helix αB runs in the native structure from Thr-34 to Gln-40. It is followed by a bend formed by Gly-41 and Leu-42 and helix 310B, which runs from Leu-43 to Cys-47. After the 310 helix a β-turn, including residues Cys-47 to Gly-50, is observed. There are several residues in this area that are part of the active site. The side chains of Trp-38, Lys-44, and Gln-51 and the NH group of Leu-52 have H-bond interactions with the glutathione substrate (12Garcı́a-Sáez I. Párraga A. Phillips M.F. Mantle T.J. Coll M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 298-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and therefore they belong to the G-subsite. On the other hand Ile-35 is part of the hydrophobic or H-subsite. In the iodoacetic acid modified enzyme this substructure is completely disordered from Ile-35 to Gln-51 with no density in the Fourier maps (Fig. 3 A). The 17-residue disordered area contrasts with the good definition of the rest of the structure. A comparison of the native and the Cys-47-derivatized structures in this area can be observed in Fig. 3 B.Figure 3A, 2Fo −Fc Fourier map of the disordered zone. Note the lack of electronic density from Ile-35 to Gln-51.

In particular Tyr-7 remains at the same position as in the complexes and with a similar environment except for a water molecule (W0) that now occupies the position of the sulfur atom of glutathione in the complexes and is at H-bond distance from the hydroxyl oxygen of the Tyr-7 (Figs. 4 and5 B). Therefore, the Tyr-7 hydroxyl group interacts only with the NH amide of Arg-13 (2.9–2.8Å) and the aforementioned water molecule, W0. The side chain of Arg-13 has not changed its position and maintains its salt bridge and double hydrogen bond with Glu-97. Other residues from the G-subsite not affected by the disorder are Gln-64, Ser-65, and Asp-98 (from the other monomer). At the H-subsite Phe-8, Val-10, and Gly-205 remain at the same positions as in the native complexes. It is remarkable that Phe-8 stays in place with its side chain unperturbed.Figure 5Active sites in two different structures. A, native mGST P1-1 complexed withS-(p-nitrobenzyl)glutathione (Protein Data Bank code 1glq) (12Garcı́a-Sáez I. Párraga A. Phillips M.F. Mantle T.J. Coll M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 298-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). B, unliganded CM-mGST P1-1. Water molecules W1, W2, and W3 are preserved in both the liganded native and in the unliganded carboxymethylated enzymes. W0 occupies in the free enzyme the location of the thiol group of glutathione.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Fig. 5 shows the water structure at the active site. In the native complexed structure a row of three water molecules, W1, W2, and W3, are located close to the sulfur atom, with W1 at H-bond distance from it and W3 H-bonded to Tyr-108 (Fig. 5 A). In the unliganded Cys-47-modified structure the 3 water molecules are present (Fig. 5 B). W1 is now H-bonded to W0, which occupies the GSH sulfur position. The active site is filled by three more water molecules at the H-subsite, W4, W5, and W6, with W4 H-bonded to the hydroxyl group of Tyr-108. W4 is also present in the glutathione-GST complex at the H-subsite.2 The global fold of the CM-mGST P1-1 in the complexed enzyme is again similar to the native complexed enzyme. For example, the rms deviation in the Cα positions, excluding residues 38–48, is 0.37 Å between molecule A of the present structure and molecule A in the S-(p-nitrobenzyl)glutathione complex structure (12Garcı́a-Sáez I.

When the structure of CM-mGST P1-1 (Fig. 3 B) is compared with the structure obtained in the presence of S-(p-nitrobenzyl)glutathione, it is obvious that the disordered helix B region is partially restructured on binding ligand. For example, residues Ile-35, Asp-36, Thr-37, and Trp-38 are now in well defined electron density. Cys-47, Leu-48, Tyr-49, Gly-50, and Gln-51 are also in density.

Detailed analysis of the rat ITF (RITF) promoter was undertaken by transient transfection and gel mobility shift assays (GMSAs) using the goblet cell-like LS174T colon cancer-derived cell line. Various lengths of wild-type or mutant constructs of the 5′-flanking region were linked to the pXP2 reporter gene luciferase. Expression of −118 RITF was significantly decreased compared with −154 RITF, and transfection with an 18-base pair construct (−141 to −124) resulted in more than 5-fold greater expression than transfection with the promoterless pXP2 gene construct alone. Using various synthetic oligonucleotide mutants, GMSAs revealed that only a 9-base pair sequence (CCCCTCCCC) in this element was required for specific binding, overlapping but distinct from a Sp1-like element. GMSA demonstrated that this element was specifically bound by nuclear proteins from intestinal cells with a goblet cell-like phenotype. These studies demonstrate that a 9-base pair element (goblet cell response element) between −154 and −118 in the RITF promoter gene is a cis-active element bound by a distinct nuclear transcription factor and is capable of directing intestine and goblet cell-specific expression.

Trefoil factors are a family of small peptides expressed at various sites throughout the gastrointestinal tract. The members of this family share an array of structural features including a distinctive motif of six cysteine residues termed a trefoil or a P domain. Thim (1Thim L. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 309Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) postulated that the six cysteine residues could contribute to the formation of three intrachain loops via the formation of disulfide bonds; the resultant predicted three-looped structure prompted the trefoil designation. A recent nuclear magnetic resonance analysis as well as x-ray crystallography of one of the trefoil peptides supported the presence of a distinctive secondary structure consistent with the putative three-intrachain loop formation (2Carr M.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1998-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Members of the family identified in mammals possess one or two P domains (3Hoffmann W. Hauser F. Trends Biochem.

Chem. 1992; 267: 24620-24624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Members of the trefoil peptide family appear to be expressed in a region-specific fashion along the length of the gastrointestinal tract. Human spasmolytic polypeptide bears two trefoil motifs and is expressed primarily in the stomach (5Tomasetto C. Rio M.-C. Gautier C. Wolf C. Hareuveni M. Chambon P. Lathe R.

Breathnach R. Bloch J. Gannon F. Krust A. Chambon P.

In contrast to pS2 and human spasmolytic polypeptide, ITF is normally selectively expressed in the normal small and large intestinal mucosa, complementing the pattern of expression of the other members of the family in the normal gastrointestinal tract. More specifically, ITF expression is normally confined to the goblet cell population within the intestinal epithelium (14Suemori S. Lynch-Devaney K. Podolsky D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11017-11021Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar).Goblet cells of the small and large intestine secrete a complex mixture of mucin glycoprotein onto the cell surface, but their functional importance in gastrointestinal tract mucosa has not been well defined. Moreover the basis of selected gene expression responsible for the distinctive goblet cell phenotype has not been defined. Genes encoding the apomucin peptide backbones of mucin glycoproteins are enormous in size and highly complex, hampering progress in efforts to define the regulatory effect conferring goblet cell-specific expression. The selective expression of ITF in intestinal goblet cells suggests that characterization of the gene encoding this peptide may provide insight into regulatory elements responsible for goblet cell-specific gene expression. Among the trefoil family members, only the promoter of pS2 gene normally expressed in gastric mucosa has been partially characterized (18Jeltsch J.M. Roberts M. Schatz C. Garnier J.M. Brown A.M.C.

Genet. 1991; 48: 889-902PubMed Google Scholar) have been cloned and their regulatory elements studied, none are products of goblet cells.Our previous report showed relatively high levels of specific expression in transient transfection studies using promoters as short as 154 bp of the 5′-flanking region of the rat ITF (RITF) gene. The presence of goblet cell-specific promoter element(s) within close proximity to the transcriptional start site was suggested by those preliminary efforts (15Sands B.E. Ogata H. Lynch-Devaney K. DeBeaumont M. Ezzell R.M. Podolsky D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9353-9361Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Further investigation of the RITF promoter was undertaken, and a cis-active element capable of directing goblet cell-specific expression was identified within this region. Moreover, this element appears to be bound by a distinct nuclear transcription factor.DISCUSSIONGoblet cells are abundant constituents of the surface epithelium within the small and large intestine, but characterization of the molecular basis of goblet cell differentiation and function has been quite limited. Differentiation of epithelial cells in the gastrointestinal tract is a complex and dynamic process. In normal mucosa, not only is the tissue-specific phenotype maintained along the longitudinal axis from esophagus to large bowel, but vertical differentiation from crypt to villus is sustained as well. Moreover, differentiation into several region-specific subpopulations is observed within the epithelium along the length of the gastrointestinal tract. Among the growing list of cloned genes whose products are intestine-specific, ITF represents the first within the gastrointestinal tract exclusively expressed by goblet cells. Following earlier initial studies of molecular cloning of the RITF gene (15Sands B.E. Ogata H. Lynch-Devaney K. DeBeaumont M. Ezzell R.M. Podolsky D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9353-9361Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), in this paper we report the identification of a goblet cell-specific enhancer element in the RITF gene promoter bound by a goblet cell nuclear protein.Trefoil proteins, including ITF, are secreted onto the mucosal surface and appear to function to preserve mucosal integrity, protecting the epithelium from injury by a variety of noxious agents (31Babyatsky M., W. DeBeaumont M. Thim L. Podolsky D.K. Gastroenterology. 1996; 110: 489-497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 32Kindon H. Pothoulakis C. Thim L. Lynch-Devaney K. Podolsky D.K.

Gastroenterology. 1995; 108: 108-116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these factors facilitate rapid healing after injury by promoting restitution, the initial phase of epithelial migration that reestablishes surface continuity (7Jørgensen K.H. Thim L. Jacobsen H.E. Regul. Pept. 1982; 3: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 31Babyatsky M., W. DeBeaumont M. Thim L. Podolsky D.K. Gastroenterology. 1996; 110: 489-497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Mice rendered deficient in ITF through targeted gene deletion are exquisitely sensitive to injury by standard agents (e.g. dextran sodium sulfate) due to impaired restitution (34Mashimo H. Wu D.-C. Podolsky D.K. Fisherman M.C. Science. 1996; 274: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). An ulcer-associated cell lineage has been reported to appear adjacent to areas of gastrointestinal ulceration, with cells containing EGF-immunostaining material in the base of the newly budding cell lineage and trefoil protein-producing cells appearing more distally along the developing ductule (35Wright N.A. Poulsom R. Stamp G.W.H. Hall P.A. Jeffery R.E. Longcroft J.M. Rio M.C. Tomasetto C. Chambon P. J. Pathol. 1990; 162: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar).There has been limited past characterization of the trefoil gene regulatory elements and as yet no delineation of the regulatory elements that are responsible for the regional selective expression of the different trefoil peptides. The presence of an EGF-responsive element in the 5′-flanking region of the pS2 gene (19Nunez A.M. Berry M. Imler J.L. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 823-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) has led to speculation about the role of EGF in inducing expression of trefoil proteins in response to mucosal injury (36Chinery R. Poulsom R. Rogers L.A. Jeffery R.E. Longcroft J.M. Hanby A.M. Wright N.A. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, scrutiny of the 5′-flanking region of the ITF gene demonstrated no significant homology to known EGF response elements (15Sands B.E. Ogata H. Lynch-Devaney K. DeBeaumont M. Ezzell R.M. Podolsky D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9353-9361Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Transient expression of deletion constructs containing various lengths of RITF gene 5′-flanking region ligated to a luciferase reporter gene indicate that an element present between −154 and −118 of RITF 5′-flanking sequences is able to enhance expression in a goblet cell-specific manner (Fig. 1). Subsequent mutational analysis indicates that this regulatory potential is conferred by a 9-bp element. Moreover, GMSA demonstrates the presence of two proteins that bind specifically to the same sequence (CCCCTCCCC, named GCRE) in nuclear extracts of goblet cells (Figs. 2 and 3). A search of this 5′-flanking region of the RITF gene reveals none of the known regulatory elements that have been demonstrated to play a role in intestine-specific expression. Thus, with the exception of some AT repeats, no areas of significant homology appear to exist within the full-length RITF promoter and the reported 5′-flanking regions of the genes from human intestinal alkaline phosphatase (37Millan J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 10599Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), human intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (20Sweetser D.A. Birkenmeier E.H. Klisak I.J. Zollman S. Sparkes R.S. Mohandas T. Lusis A.J. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16060-16071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), porcine aminopeptidase N (38Olsen J. Sjostrom H. Noren O. FEBS Lett. 1989; 251: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), human and mouse sucrase-isomaltase (21Chantret I. Lacasa M. Chevalier G. Ruf J. Islam I. Mantei N. Edwards Y. Swallow D. Rousset M. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 915-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 39Traber P.G. Wu G.D. Wang W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3614-3627Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), or human lactase-phlorizin hydrolase (22Boll W. Wagner P. Mantei N. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1991; 48: 889-902PubMed Google Scholar). However, there is an Sp1-like motif (CCTCCCC) in the GCRE, and one of the two specific binding proteins appears to be one of the Sp binding proteins, a family of zinc finger proteins (Fig. 4). The Sp1 motif is present in the enhancer regions of diverse genes (40Kadonaga J.T. Courey A.J. Ladika J. Tjian R. Science. 1988; 242: 1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 41Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). While it appears that one of the proteins present in nuclear extract from goblet cell-like lines binds in an Sp1-like fashion, it is also apparent that these extracts contain a protein that is distinct from an Sp1 element that binds the GCRE.The GMSA using nuclear extracts from various undifferentiated H2 cells grown in standard conditions contains little GCRE-binding protein (Fig. 6). In contrast, differentiated H2 cells, which exhibit a goblet cell-like phenotype, contain much greater nuclear protein bound to GCRE than undifferentiated H2 cells. No specific binding reaction to GCRE is observed with the nuclear proteins from Caco2 cells, which exhibit a columnar enterocyte phenotype (Fig. 6). Although the DNA-protein complexes observed in experiments using the nuclear proteins from LS174T and H2 cells are the same in size and although their binding appears to be specific as indicated by competition assays, it remains possible that these GCRE-binding proteins are different. At a minimum, these studies indicate that intestinal cells that have differentiated to goblet cell-like phenotype possess nuclear binding proteins that recognize the GCRE.The analysis of cell specificity of the GCRE and its binding protein demonstrate that the latter is specifically associated with intestinal goblet-like cells. No GCRE was observed in the nuclear proteins from esophagus, stomach, pancreas, kidney, or breast. While the GCRE-binding proteins are present in liver and cervix cell lines, it appears that this reflects the Sp1-binding protein and another factor that is distinct from that in goblet-like cells because transient transfection assays suggest that the binding of the GCRE sequence in these cells does not promote ITF transcription. Interestingly, IEC6 cells, a nontransformed intestinal epithelial cell line established in this laboratory from neonatal rat intestinal crypt cells (42Quaroni A. Wands J. Trelstad T.L. Isselbacher K.J. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 80: 245-265Crossref Scopus (675) Google Scholar), do not possess the nuclear factors that bind to the GCRE. Previous studies have shown that IEC6 cells do not have detectable RITF mRNA by Northern blot analysis (14Suemori S. Lynch-Devaney K. Podolsky D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11017-11021Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that some unknown regulatory factor exists for vertical differentiation from crypt to villus in small and large intestine. Transient transfection experiments comparing LS174T cells and cells derived from other organs suggest that the GCRE of the RITF gene promoter is capable of directing intestine and goblet cell-specific expression.In summary, we have identified a goblet cell-specific enhancer element in RITF gene promoter bound by a goblet cell nuclear protein. Further characterization of this enhancer element may provide insight into the molecular basis of the goblet cell phenotype. Future studies may also identify the genetic elements responsible for “ectopic” expression of ITF in pathologic conditions. Trefoil factors are a family of small peptides expressed at various sites throughout the gastrointestinal tract. The members of this family share an array of structural features including a distinctive motif of six cysteine residues termed a trefoil or a P domain. Thim (1Thim L. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 309Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) postulated that the six cysteine residues could contribute to the formation of three intrachain loops via the formation of disulfide bonds; the resultant predicted three-looped structure prompted the trefoil designation. A recent nuclear magnetic resonance analysis as well as x-ray crystallography of one of the trefoil peptides supported the presence of a distinctive secondary structure consistent with the putative three-intrachain loop formation (2Carr M.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1998-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Members of the family identified in mammals possess one or two P domains (3Hoffmann W. Hauser F. Trends Biochem.

Members of the trefoil peptide family appear to be expressed in a region-specific fashion along the length of the gastrointestinal tract. Human spasmolytic polypeptide bears two trefoil motifs and is expressed primarily in the stomach (5Tomasetto C. Rio M.-C. Gautier C. Wolf C. Hareuveni M. Chambon P. Lathe R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), although the porcine homologue was originally isolated from pancreas (7Jørgensen K.H. Thim L. Jacobsen H.E. Regul.

In contrast to pS2 and human spasmolytic polypeptide, ITF is normally selectively expressed in the normal small and large intestinal mucosa, complementing the pattern of expression of the other members of the family in the normal gastrointestinal tract. More specifically, ITF expression is normally confined to the goblet cell population within the intestinal epithelium (14Suemori S. Lynch-Devaney K. Podolsky D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11017-11021Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Goblet cells of the small and large intestine secrete a complex mixture of mucin glycoprotein onto the cell surface, but their functional importance in gastrointestinal tract mucosa has not been well defined. Moreover the basis of selected gene expression responsible for the distinctive goblet cell phenotype has not been defined. Genes encoding the apomucin peptide backbones of mucin glycoproteins are enormous in size and highly complex, hampering progress in efforts to define the regulatory effect conferring goblet cell-specific expression. The selective expression of ITF in intestinal goblet cells suggests that characterization of the gene encoding this peptide may provide insight into regulatory elements responsible for goblet cell-specific gene expression. Among the trefoil family members, only the promoter of pS2 gene normally expressed in gastric mucosa has been partially characterized (18Jeltsch J.M. Roberts M. Schatz C. Garnier J.M. Brown A.M.C.

The presence of goblet cell-specific promoter element(s) within close proximity to the transcriptional start site was suggested by those preliminary efforts (15Sands B.E. Ogata H. Lynch-Devaney K. DeBeaumont M. Ezzell R.M. Podolsky D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9353-9361Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Further investigation of the RITF promoter was undertaken, and a cis-active element capable of directing goblet cell-specific expression was identified within this region. Moreover, this element appears to be bound by a distinct nuclear transcription factor. DISCUSSIONGoblet cells are abundant constituents of the surface epithelium within the small and large intestine, but characterization of the molecular basis of goblet cell differentiation and function has been quite limited. Differentiation of epithelial cells in the gastrointestinal tract is a complex and dynamic process. In normal mucosa, not only is the tissue-specific phenotype maintained along the longitudinal axis from esophagus to large bowel, but vertical differentiation from crypt to villus is sustained as well. Moreover, differentiation into several region-specific subpopulations is observed within the epithelium along the length of the gastrointestinal tract. Among the growing list of cloned genes whose products are intestine-specific, ITF represents the first within the gastrointestinal tract exclusively expressed by goblet cells. Following earlier initial studies of molecular cloning of the RITF gene (15Sands B.E. Ogata H. Lynch-Devaney K. DeBeaumont M. Ezzell R.M. Podolsky D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9353-9361Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), in this paper we report the identification of a goblet cell-specific enhancer element in the RITF gene promoter bound by a goblet cell nuclear protein.Trefoil proteins, including ITF, are secreted onto the mucosal surface and appear to function to preserve mucosal integrity, protecting the epithelium from injury by a variety of noxious agents (31Babyatsky M., W.

Furthermore, these factors facilitate rapid healing after injury by promoting restitution, the initial phase of epithelial migration that reestablishes surface continuity (7Jørgensen K.H. Thim L. Jacobsen H.E. Regul. Pept. 1982; 3: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 31Babyatsky M., W. DeBeaumont M. Thim L. Podolsky D.K. Gastroenterology. 1996; 110: 489-497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Mice rendered deficient in ITF through targeted gene deletion are exquisitely sensitive to injury by standard agents (e.g. dextran sodium sulfate) due to impaired restitution (34Mashimo H. Wu D.-C. Podolsky D.K. Fisherman M.C. Science. 1996; 274: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). An ulcer-associated cell lineage has been reported to appear adjacent to areas of gastrointestinal ulceration, with cells containing EGF-immunostaining material in the base of the newly budding cell lineage and trefoil protein-producing cells appearing more distally along the developing ductule (35Wright N.A. Poulsom R. Stamp G.W.H. Hall P.A. Jeffery R.E. Longcroft J.M. Rio M.C. Tomasetto C. Chambon P. J. Pathol. 1990; 162: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar).There has been limited past characterization of the trefoil gene regulatory elements and as yet no delineation of the regulatory elements that are responsible for the regional selective expression of the different trefoil peptides. The presence of an EGF-responsive element in the 5′-flanking region of the pS2 gene (19Nunez A.M. Berry M. Imler J.L. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 823-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) has led to speculation about the role of EGF in inducing expression of trefoil proteins in response to mucosal injury (36Chinery R. Poulsom R. Rogers L.A. Jeffery R.E. Longcroft J.M. Hanby A.M. Wright N.A. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, scrutiny of the 5′-flanking region of the ITF gene demonstrated no significant homology to known EGF response elements (15Sands B.E. Ogata H. Lynch-Devaney K. DeBeaumont M. Ezzell R.M. Podolsky D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9353-9361Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Transient expression of deletion constructs containing various lengths of RITF gene 5′-flanking region ligated to a luciferase reporter gene indicate that an element present between −154 and −118 of RITF 5′-flanking sequences is able to enhance expression in a goblet cell-specific manner (Fig. 1). Subsequent mutational analysis indicates that this regulatory potential is conferred by a 9-bp element. Moreover, GMSA demonstrates the presence of two proteins that bind specifically to the same sequence (CCCCTCCCC, named GCRE) in nuclear extracts of goblet cells (Figs. 2 and 3). A search of this 5′-flanking region of the RITF gene reveals none of the known regulatory elements that have been demonstrated to play a role in intestine-specific expression. Thus, with the exception of some AT repeats, no areas of significant homology appear to exist within the full-length RITF promoter and the reported 5′-flanking regions of the genes from human intestinal alkaline phosphatase (37Millan J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 10599Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), human intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (20Sweetser D.A. Birkenmeier E.H. Klisak I.J. Zollman S. Sparkes R.S.

However, there is an Sp1-like motif (CCTCCCC) in the GCRE, and one of the two specific binding proteins appears to be one of the Sp binding proteins, a family of zinc finger proteins (Fig. 4). The Sp1 motif is present in the enhancer regions of diverse genes (40Kadonaga J.T. Courey A.J. Ladika J. Tjian R. Science. 1988; 242: 1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 41Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). While it appears that one of the proteins present in nuclear extract from goblet cell-like lines binds in an Sp1-like fashion, it is also apparent that these extracts contain a protein that is distinct from an Sp1 element that binds the GCRE.The GMSA using nuclear extracts from various undifferentiated H2 cells grown in standard conditions contains little GCRE-binding protein (Fig. 6). In contrast, differentiated H2 cells, which exhibit a goblet cell-like phenotype, contain much greater nuclear protein bound to GCRE than undifferentiated H2 cells. No specific binding reaction to GCRE is observed with the nuclear proteins from Caco2 cells, which exhibit a columnar enterocyte phenotype (Fig. 6). Although the DNA-protein complexes observed in experiments using the nuclear proteins from LS174T and H2 cells are the same in size and although their binding appears to be specific as indicated by competition assays, it remains possible that these GCRE-binding proteins are different. At a minimum, these studies indicate that intestinal cells that have differentiated to goblet cell-like phenotype possess nuclear binding proteins that recognize the GCRE.The analysis of cell specificity of the GCRE and its binding protein demonstrate that the latter is specifically associated with intestinal goblet-like cells. No GCRE was observed in the nuclear proteins from esophagus, stomach, pancreas, kidney, or breast. While the GCRE-binding proteins are present in liver and cervix cell lines, it appears that this reflects the Sp1-binding protein and another factor that is distinct from that in goblet-like cells because transient transfection assays suggest that the binding of the GCRE sequence in these cells does not promote ITF transcription. Interestingly, IEC6 cells, a nontransformed intestinal epithelial cell line established in this laboratory from neonatal rat intestinal crypt cells (42Quaroni A. Wands J. Trelstad T.L. Isselbacher K.J. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 80: 245-265Crossref Scopus (675) Google Scholar), do not possess the nuclear factors that bind to the GCRE. Previous studies have shown that IEC6 cells do not have detectable RITF mRNA by Northern blot analysis (14Suemori S. Lynch-Devaney K. Podolsky D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11017-11021Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that some unknown regulatory factor exists for vertical differentiation from crypt to villus in small and large intestine. Transient transfection experiments comparing LS174T cells and cells derived from other organs suggest that the GCRE of the RITF gene promoter is capable of directing intestine and goblet cell-specific expression.In summary, we have identified a goblet cell-specific enhancer element in RITF gene promoter bound by a goblet cell nuclear protein. Further characterization of this enhancer element may provide insight into the molecular basis of the goblet cell phenotype. Future studies may also identify the genetic elements responsible for “ectopic” expression of ITF in pathologic conditions.

We have reported previously that transcription is impeded at the replication termini of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis in a polar mode and that, when transcription is allowed to invade a replication terminus from the permissive direction, arrest of replication fork at the terminus is abrogated. In the present report, we have addressed four significant questions pertaining to the mechanism of transcription impedance by the replication terminator proteins. Is transcription arrested at the replication terminus or does RNA polymerase dissociate from the DNA causing authentic transcription termination? How does transcription cause abrogation of replication fork arrest at the terminus? Are the points of arrest of the replication fork and transcription the same or are these different? Are eukaryotic RNA polymerases also arrested at prokaryotic replication termini? Our results show that replication terminator proteins of E. coli and B. subtilis arrest but do not terminate transcription. Passage of an RNA transcript through the replication terminus causes the dissociation of the terminator protein from the terminus DNA, thus causing abrogation of replication fork arrest. DNA and RNA chain elongation are arrested at different locations on the terminator sites.

Science. 1995; 255: 817-823Crossref Scopus (481) Google Scholar) and elongation stages of DNA replication have been reported (28Liu B. Wong M.L. Tinker R.L. Geiduscheck E.P. Alberts B.M.

We have reported previously that Tus and RTP can block RNA chain elongation catalyzed by several prokaryotic RNA polymerases in a polar mode and that the passage of an RNA transcript that invades the terminus from the permissive direction causes functional inactivation of the replication terminus (30Mohanty B.K. Sahoo T. Bastia D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2530-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We have suggested that the polar arrest of transcription protects the terminus from functional inactivation by transcriptional invasion (30Mohanty B.K. Sahoo T. Bastia D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2530-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 31Sahoo T. Mohanty B.K. Lobert M. Manna A.C. Bastia D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29138-29144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The interaction between transcription and termination of DNA replication is of further interest because the replication check points of B. subtilis that are conditionally active under stringent conditions (32Levine A. Autret S. Seror S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) appear to be controlled by transcription. 2A. Gautam, B. K. Mohanty, and D. Bastia, unpublished results. 2A. Gautam, B. K. Mohanty, and D. Bastia, unpublished results. In the present work, we endeavored to address four important questions regarding the interplay between transcription and replication termination. (i) What is the eventual fate of RNA polymerase (RNAP) when it reaches the Tus-Ter (τ) complex that is positioned in blocking orientation? Is the RNAP arrested or does it dissociate from the DNA leading to authentic termination of transcription? (ii) Does the passage of transcription through the replication terminus cause the dissociation of the Tus protein from the DNA-protein complex thus abrogating replication fork arrest or is it caused by a transcription-mediated conformational change of the Tus-Ter(τ) complex that does not involve removal of Tus? (iii) Are the DNA and RNA chains blocked at the same site of the terminus? (iv) Are eukaryotic RNAPs blocked by prokaryotic replication termination proteins, and, conversely, can eukaryotic transcription termination proteins block replicative helicases and a prokaryotic RNAP? In this report, we present a series of in vivo and in vitro experiments that address these questions. The results show that replication terminator proteins arrested RNAPs but did not cause transcription termination. Transcriptional invasion caused the terminator proteins to dissociate from the terminus, thus explaining the mechanism of abrogation of replication fork arrest. The transcription and replication arrest sites are different. Although the replication terminator proteins blocked eukaryotic RNAPs, a eukaryotic transcription terminator protein failed to block T7 RNAP and E. coli DnaB helicase. For experiments on arrest of T7 RNAP by Tus, the plasmids pET22b-τ and pET22b-τ rev. were constructed by cloning a 177-bp HindIII fragment of DNA containing the Ter(τ) site in either orientation at the HindIII site of pET22b(+) plasmid (Novagen). pET22b-BS3 and pET22b-BS3 rev. plasmids (used in experiments to investigate T7 RNAP blockage by RTP) and T7A1-BS3 and T7A1-BS3 rev. DNA substrates (used in experiments to investigate E. coli RNAP blockage by RTP) have been described previously (30Mohanty B.K. Sahoo T. Bastia D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2530-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For experiments on blockage of E. coli RNAP by Tus, the Ter (τ) site was cloned in either orientation downstream of a T7A1 promoter to generate the DNA substrates T7A1-τ and T7A1-τ rev. DNA fragment containing the T7A1-τ was obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with a primer upstream of the T7A1 promoter (A1 primer, 5′-AGGAGAGACTTAAAGAG-3′) and the M13 universal primer or the A1 primer and a primer 5′-TATTAACCACTTTAGTTACAACATACTTATTTTA-3′ that overlaps the Ter (τ) site. Similarly, a DNA fragment containing the T7A1-τ rev. was obtained by PCR with the A1 primer and M13 universal primer or the A1 primer and a primer 5′-TAAAATAAGTATGTTGTAACTAAAGTGGTTA ATA-3′ that overlaps the Ter (τ) site. PCR was carried out for 30 cycles in each case with each cycle consisting of three steps: 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 120 s. For experiments with Reb1p, the Reb1 binding site (33Lang W.H. Morrow B.E. Ju Q. Warner J.R. Reeder R.H. Cell. 1994; 79: 527-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) from the plasmid p6.50 (from Dr. Walter Lang, University of Washington, Seattle, WA) was cloned as a HindIII-SacI orHindIII-NotI fragment into pET22b plasmid to generate templates with the blocking and the nonblocking orientations of Reb1p binding site, respectively. Purification of Tus, RTP, and T7 RNAP has been described previously (30Mohanty B.K. Sahoo T. Bastia D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2530-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 31Sahoo T. Mohanty B.K. Lobert M. Manna A.C. Bastia D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29138-29144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). E. coli RNA polymerase containing 6-histidine-tagged β′-subunit was purified from the strain AG2005/β′-6His (kindly provided by Dr. Alex Goldfarb, Public Health Research Institute, New York, NY) according to Kashlev et al. (34Kashlev M. Martin E. Polyakov A. Severinov K. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 130: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), with some modifications. The fractions from Ni+-agarose column that contained the RNA polymerase were pooled and fractionated further on a 1-ml MonoQ (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) column (35Hager D.A. Jin D.J. Burgess R.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7890-7894Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The RNA polymerase was eluted with a 0- 0.6m NaCl gradient in buffer containing 40 mmTris·HCl, pH 7.9, 5% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Peak fractions were pooled and used for transcription. For some experiments, we have also usedE. coli RNA polymerase that was purified as described (30Mohanty B.K. Sahoo T. Bastia D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2530-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Reb1 protein was purified according to published procedures (33Lang W.H. Morrow B.E. Ju Q. Warner J.R. Reeder R.H. Cell. 1994; 79: 527-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Yeast RNA polymerase I and II were kind gifts from Dr. Walter Lang. S1 nuclease was purchased from U. S. Biochemicals. EcoRI E111Q mutant protein was a kind gift from Dr. Paul Modrich (Duke University, Durham, NC). Multiple-round transcription reactions were carried out as described previously (30Mohanty B.K. Sahoo T. Bastia D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2530-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Single-round transcription reactions in the presence of rifampin were carried out as described below in the appropriate sections. To study the fate of E. coli RNAP when it is blocked by E111Q mutant form of EcoRI (that binds to DNA site with a very long half-life but does not cleave DNA), Tus or RTP single-round transcription reaction was carried out essentially as described below. 50 fmol of the DNA fragment were incubated with 5–10-fold molar excess of E111Q protein or 10–20-fold RTP or Tus at 37 °C for 5 min in transcription buffer containing 30 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.6, 40 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 μm each of the four NTPs, and 10 μCi of [α-32P]GTP. 100 fmol of E. coli RNA polymerase (2-fold molar excess over DNA) was added and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. Transcription was initiated by adding MgCl2 to 2 mm, followed by rifampin to 100 μg/ml and heparin to 100 μg/ml. The reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 15 min. The transcription mix was then divided into two equal halves. To one half, KCl was added (in 1 × transcription buffer containing 2 mm MgCl2) to a final concentration of 0.5 or 0.7 m KCl. To the other half, 1 × buffer with 2 mm MgCl2 was added. The reaction was continued for another 30 min at 37 °C. 2 units of RNase-free DNase I (Pharmacia) was added, and incubation was continued at 37 °C for 15 min. The RNA was precipitated and run in a 6% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel. To determine the fate of E. coli RNAP when it is blocked by Tus, a gel mobility shift assay was carried out. A single-round transcription reaction was set up in the presence of Tus as described above. After the addition of RNAP, MgCl2, rifampin, and heparin, incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by addition of 5 μl of the loading dye containing 25% glycerol with bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol dyes (to give a final concentration of 5% glycerol) and was resolved in a 5% polyacrylamide gel. The binding of Tus to 32P-labeled transcription template DNA and the effect of salt on the binding were analyzed by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The steps of a standard single-round transcription reaction were followed except that RNAP dilution buffer was added instead of RNAP. After incubation of the DNA with Tus followed by incubation with RNAP dilution buffer, MgCl2, rifampin, and heparin were added and further incubation was carried out for 15 min at 37 °C. Then, KCl in 1 × transcription buffer or 1 × buffer alone was added to the appropriate tube, and incubation was continued for another 30 min at 37 °C. Sample dye was added to give a final concentration of 5% glycerol, and the samples were run in a 5% polyacrylamide gel. 100 fmol of the pET22b-τ or pET22b-τ rev. plasmid linearized at the BlpI site was incubated with 65 fmol of Tus protein at room temperature for 15 min. 0.5–1.0 pmol of T7 RNAP was added and incubated for 1 min, following which 12 fmol of an end-labeled (by [γ-32P]ATP) 177-bp Ter (τ) fragment was added and incubation was continued for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction mix was run in a 5% polyacrylamide gel to monitor trapping of the Tus protein displaced from transcription template by the 32P-labeled Ter fragment. E. coli Tus+ strain TH423 (a kind gift of Dr. T. M. Hill, University of North Dakota School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Grand Forks, ND) containing the plasmid pUC18-τ with the Ter (τ) site in replication arresting orientation was grown and replication intermediates were isolated from it as described previously (30Mohanty B.K. Sahoo T. Bastia D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2530-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The plasmid was run in a 0.8% agarose gel without ethidium bromide. The replication intermediate, which ran slower than the fully replicated plasmid was eluted from the gel, ethanol-precipitated, and dissolved in TE (10 mmTris·HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). The DNA was digested withHindIII, dephosphorylated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase (U.S. Biochemical Corp.), phenol-extracted, precipitated with ethanol, and dissolved in TE. The dephosphorylated DNA was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase, passed through Sephadex G25 spin column, precipitated with ethanol, and dissolved in TE. The labeled DNA was run in a 6% polyacrylamide, 7 murea sequencing gel alongside the pUC18 sequencing ladder. A unidirectional multiple-round primer extension by PCR was performed with the replication intermediate to determine the lagging strand blockagein vivo. The M13/pUC reverse sequencing primer was annealed to the replication intermediates in which it would anneal to the lagging strand and one parental strand. Extension was carried out by PCR using Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) for 30 cycles with each cycle having three steps: 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 120 s. The primer extension products were run in a 6% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel alongside pUC18 sequencing ladder. For mapping the 3′-ends of the transcripts blocked at the terminator protein binding sites, scaled-up reactions were carried out in 100-μl volumes. After assembly, to 10 μl of the reaction mix [α-32P]GTP was added to monitor transcription impedance by the terminator proteins. The remainder of the sample (90 μl) was used for mapping. Samples with and without [α-32P]GTP were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, extracted with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol and chloroform:isoamyl alcohol, and precipitated with ammonium acetate and ethanol as described previously (30Mohanty B.K. Sahoo T. Bastia D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2530-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The 32P-labeled sample was run in a 6% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel to confirm transcription blockage. For mapping the 3′-end of RNA generated in the experiments with RTP, the DNA probe was generated as below; anNdeI-SacI fragment containing the BS3 site obtained from the plasmid pET22b-BS3 was end-filled by T4 DNA polymerase in the presence of TTP and [α-32P]dATP so that only the NdeI end was labeled. For mapping experiments with Tus, the DNA probe was generated as described below; pET22b-τ plasmid was digested with NcoI, end-filling was done by T4 DNA polymerase in the presence of dCTP and [α-32P] dATP, the labeled DNA was digested with XhoI, and finally the labeled NcoI-XhoI fragment containing the Ter (τ) site was recovered from a 6% polyacrylamide gel. Templates used for run-off transcription wereBglII-BlpI fragments from pET22b plasmids containing RebIp binding site in the blocking (atHindIII-SacI sites) or the nonblocking (atHindIII-NotI site) orientation. The ∼400-bpBglII-BlpI fragments were modified by ligating a 14-nt oligonucleotide (5′-GATCAAAAAACCA-3′) to the BglII end by T4 DNA ligase to create a 3′ overhang to serve as RNAP entry site. Typical reactions were carried out in a 40-μl volume containing 40 fmol of template DNA, 50 ng of Reb1 protein (500 fmol) in reaction buffer containing 10 mm HEPES-KOH pH 7.9, 10 mmMgCl2, 25 mm KCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 20 mm DTT, 10 units of RNAguard (Pharmacia), 1 μl of 20 mm dinucleotide UpG (Sigma), 0.5 mm each of ATP, CTP, and UTP, 0.1 mm GTP, and 20 μCi of [α-32P]GTP. Yeast RNA polymerase I (12 units) or RNAP II (6 units) were added after dilution in the buffer containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 50 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mg/ml leuopeptin. After binding Reb1p or RTP to the corresponding template in the reaction buffer for 15 min at room temperature, yeast RNAP was added and incubation was carried out at 30 °C for 30 min, followed by Dnase I treatment at 37 °C for 30 min. Transcription products were extracted with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol and precipitated with ethanol in the presence of 10 μg of yeast tRNA. RNA was dissolved in loading buffer (30Mohanty B.K. Sahoo T. Bastia D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2530-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and resolved in a 6% polyacrylamide, 7m urea gel. For transcription by T7 RNA polymerase, all the conditions were same as above except that the transcription buffer was as described earlier for T7 RNA polymerase (30Mohanty B.K. Sahoo T. Bastia D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2530-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and nucleotides used were 0.5 mm each of ATP, CTP, and UTP, 12 μmGTP, 20 μCi of [α-32P]GTP, and 100 ng of purified T7 RNAP. Templates used were ∼400-bp BglII-BlpI fragments from the plasmids pET22b-BS3 and pET22b-BS3 rev. to which the 14-nt oligonucleotide described in the previous section was ligated to provide an entry site for the RNAP. The transcription reaction contained 40 fmol of template DNA and 400 or 800 fmol (10–20-fold molar excess) of RTP. Reaction conditions were same as described for transcription blockage experiments with Reb1p. We have shown previously that RTP impedes RNA chain elongation catalyzed by E. coli and T7 RNAPs in an orientation-dependent manner (30Mohanty B.K. Sahoo T. Bastia D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2530-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The same orientation of the RTP-TerI (BS3) complex impedes both RNA and DNA chain elongation. We wished to generalize and extend our previous observation by investigating the effect of Tus-Ter (τ) complex on chain elongation catalyzed by both T7 and the E. coli RNA polymerases. We linearized pET22b-τ DNA carrying the TerB (see Fig. 1) site of E. coli in the orientation that impedes replication forks (11Khatri G.S. MacAllister T. Sista P.R. Bastia D. Cell. 1989; 59: 667-674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 12Lee E.H. Kornberg A. Hidaka M. Kobayashi T. Horiuchi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9104-9108Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and initiated transcription from a T7 promoter by T7 RNAP in the presence of 0-, 2-, 4-, or 8-fold molar excess of Tus over DNA substrate (100 fmol of DNA and 0, ∼7, 14, and 28 ng of Tus). A full-length transcript of ∼450 nt (arrow showing F) and two very closely spaced truncated transcripts of ∼290 nt (arrow showing T) were generated (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1–4). Transcription of the template pET22b-τ rev. that contained the Ter (τ) site in the reverse orientation under identical conditions did not show impedance of the transcription, and thus only full-length run-off transcripts were observed even if an 8-fold molar excess of Tus was used (Fig. 2 A, lanes 6–8). Transcription from a control DNA fragment that also had a T7 promoter but no downstream Ter (τ) site generated only full-length run-off transcripts (marked C in Fig. 2 A). Thus, the Tus-Ter (τ) complex blocked up to a maximum of 60% of the transcripts in the replication blocking orientation.Figure 2Blockage of T7 and E. coli RNA polymerases by E. coli replication terminator protein Tus. Top, map of the BglII-BlpI part of the pET22b-τ and pET22b-τ rev. plasmids used for transcription inbottom (A). Transcription from the T7 promoter in either substrate in the absence of Tus will generate a transcript of ∼450 nt. In the presence of Tus, a truncated transcript of ∼290 nt will be generated from pET22b-τ, whereas from pET22b-τ rev. no truncated transcript will be formed.

https://openalex.org/W1983018735,"We have previously reported that the adenovirus E1A oncogene represses the transcription of the H subunit of the mouse ferritin gene. Subsequent analyses defined FER-1, a 37-nucleotide sequence located 4.1 kilobases proximal to the start site of transcription, as the target of E1A-mediated transcriptional repression and as an enhancer of the ferritin H gene. FER-1 is composed of an AP1-like sequence followed by an element with dyad symmetry. To achieve maximal enhancer activity and transcriptional repression by E1A, both elements were essential. Using gel retardation assays, we now demonstrate that the binding complex for the AP1-like sequence of FER-1 contains JunD, FosB, and ATF1. Furthermore, JunD and FosB were able to activate FER-1 enhancer activity by transient cotransfection with ferritin H-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter constructs. This augmented enhancer activity was inhibited by E1A. In addition, we have defined the minimal sequence in the dyad element of FER-1 required for protein interaction. This was determined to be a C-rich sequence to which Sp1 and Sp3 bind. Experiments with recombinant proteins indicate that members of both transcription factor families simultaneously bind FER-1. Taken together, these results elucidate molecular mechanisms involved in the transcriptional regulation of a pivotal gene in iron metabolism and provide insights into the contribution of the Sp1 family to the activation of AP1-dependent enhancers.

Ferritin is a ubiquitous and highly conserved iron binding protein that plays a role in the storage and partitioning of iron for intracellular use. It consists of two types of subunits, designated H and L. They assemble to form a 24-subunit ferritin shell in which the H:L subunit ratio reflects the tissue type and physiological status of the cell (reviewed in Ref. 1Theil E.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 289-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). The H and L subunits of ferritin are encoded by independent genes (2Jain S.K. Barrett K.J. Boyd D. Favreau M.F. Crampton J. Drysdale J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11762-11768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and expression of these genes is regulated at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. The level of intracellular iron is the principal posttranscriptional regulator of ferritin. Translation of both H and L subunits of ferritin are coordinately regulated through the interaction of RNA binding proteins with the iron-responsive element in the 5′-untranslated region of the ferritin H and L mRNAs (see Ref. 3Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Cell. 1993; 72: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar for review). Ferritin synthesis is also regulated at transcriptional level, in which the preferential modulation of the H subunit rather than the L subunit of ferritin is frequently observed. For instance, we reported that the transcription of the H subunit of ferritin is selectively activated by the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (4Tsuji Y. Miller L.L. Miller S.C.

In addition to these cytokines, we found that the adenovirus E1A oncogene preferentially represses the transcription of the H subunit of the ferritin gene in NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts (8Tsuji Y. Kwak E. Saika T. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7270-7275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To our knowledge, E1A is the only negative modulator of transcription of ferritin H gene identified to date, and this was another example showing independent regulation of transcription in the H and L subunits of ferritin gene. We have recently identified the target sequence (termed FER-1) responsible for E1A-mediated transcriptional repression of the mouse ferritin H gene (9Tsuji Y. Akebi N. Lam T.K. Nakabeppu Y. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5152-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).

Our previous studies demonstrated that FER-1 serves as an enhancer of the mouse ferritin H gene, which augments the transcription of this gene in a position- and orientation-independent manner. We also found that within FER-1, the AP1-like sequence alone had moderate enhancer activity, the element with dyad symmetry by itself had no enhancer activity, and both elements were required for maximal enhancer activity (9Tsuji Y. Akebi N. Lam T.K. Nakabeppu Y. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5152-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus, the two elements of FER-1 cooperatively activate the transcription of the ferritin H gene. In addition, E1A decreased the binding of Jun and Fos family members to the AP1-like element of FER-1 in the absence of an alteration in the binding of nuclear factors to the dyad symmetry sequence of FER-1 (9Tsuji Y. Akebi N. Lam T.K. Nakabeppu Y. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5152-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), suggesting that the main target for transcriptional repression of the ferritin H gene by E1A is the family of AP1 transcription factors in the FER-1 binding complex. AP1 is a sequence-specific transcription factor consisting of a dimer of Jun and Fos family members (Jun family: c-Jun, JunB, and JunD; Fos family: c-Fos, FosB, fra1, and fra2). Members of the Jun family can form homo- and heterodimers and recognize a consensus DNA sequence (TGAGTCA) or related sequences. Fos family members cannot dimerize with each other but can associate with any member of the Jun family and augment transcriptional activation when compared with dimers of Jun family members (reviewed in Ref. 10Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3261) Google Scholar). In addition to Jun and Fos family members, some ATF/CREB family members can recognize the AP1 binding sequence by dimer formation with Jun or Fos family members (11Hai T. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3720-3724Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). Thus, the AP1 or AP1-related nucleotide sequences can bind at least three large families of transcription factors (Jun, Fos, and ATF/CREB families), and specific dimer formation induced by different environmental stimuli may determine the specificity of genes activated through AP1 binding sequences. AP1 was originally identified as a transcription factor essential for the basal enhancer of the human metallothionein IIA and SV40 promoters (12Lee W. Haslinger A. Karin M. Tjian R. Nature. 1987; 325: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) and was also found to be inducible by various stimuli, such as growth factors, cytokines, and UV irradiation (13Lee W. Mitchell P. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 49: 741-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar, 14Angel P. Imagawa M. Chiu R. Stein B. Imbra R.J. Rahmsdorf H.J. Jonat C. Herrlich P. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 49: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2155) Google Scholar). The activity of AP1 is regulated by several mechanisms, including alteration in the expression of specific AP1 components, which may affect dimer formation and consequent affinity, as well as protein phosphorylation, which regulates transcriptional activity without changing the ability to bind to a target DNA sequence (reviewed in Ref. 15Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2253) Google Scholar). Our previous studies identified FER-1 as both an enhancer and an E1A-responsive element of the mouse ferritin H gene and suggested that members of the Jun and Fos families recognize the AP1-like element of FER-1. However, the specific proteins binding to both the element with an AP1-like sequence and the element with dyad symmetry within FER-1 have not been elucidated. Characterization of nuclear factors that act on the FER-1 enhancer element is therefore essential not only to delineating regulatory mechanisms in transcriptional control of the ferritin H gene but also to better understanding the mechanism of E1A-mediated transcriptional repression. We report here that 1) JunD, FosB, and ATF1 are contained in the binding complex that recognizes the AP1-like sequence of FER-1; 2) JunD and FosB are able to activate FER-1 enhancer activity, and this activation retains E1A sensitivity; 3) the C-rich sequence in the dyad element of FER-1 is involved in binding of Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors; and 4) recombinant ATF1 and Sp1 are able to bind the FER-1 element simultaneously, suggesting that transcription factors that bind to components of the FER-1 element act in concert to stimulate ferritin H transcription. All mouse cell lines used in this study (NIH3T3 fibroblasts, F9 embryonal carcinoma cells, BNL CL.2 normal liver cells, and L929 fibroblasts) were grown in high-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bioproducts) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Most of the 5′- ferritin H-CAT plasmids used in this study were described previously (9Tsuji Y. Akebi N. Lam T.K. Nakabeppu Y. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5152-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, pBluescript II KS(−) −4.8-kb FHCAT contains 4.8 kb of the 5′-mouse ferritin H enhancer/promoter region (16Kwak E.L. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Gene. 1990; 94: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene in the pBluescript II KS(−) vector. pBluescript II KS(−)ΔStuI/EcoRV FHCAT lacks the 3.8-kb region containing FER-1 and was constructed by deletion of the StuI (−4.13 kb)-EcoRV(−0.32 kb) fragment from pBluescript II KS(−) −4.8-kb FHCAT. Two copies (antisense-antisense orientation) of the 37-bp FER-1 element (5′-CCATGACAAAGCACTTTTGGAGCCCAACCCCTCCAAA-3′) or three copies (antisense-antisense-sense orientation) of the 16-bp AP1-like element (5′-CCATGACAAAGCACTT-3′) of FER-1 were inserted into the SmaI site (−0.22 kb) of pBluescript II KS(−)ΔStuI/EcoRV FHCAT to construct pBluescript II KS(−)ΔStuI/EcoRV, SmaI/FER-1CAT and pBluescript II KS(−)ΔStuI/EcoRV, SmaI/AP1-like CAT, respectively. These CAT constructs were used for cotransfection assays with mouse JunD and FosB expression plasmids (Fig. 3) as well as for transfection in various mouse cell lines (Table I). Expression of JunD and FosB was under the control of the SRα promoter in the pcDEBΔ vector (17Nakabeppu Y. Oda S. Sekiguchi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4157-4166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An expression plasmid of mouse CREB, pHDmCREBα (18Ruppert S. Cole T.J. Boshart M. Schmid E. Schutz G.

All plasmid constructs were characterized by restriction enzyme digestion, and the nucleotide sequence of each mutated region was verified by dideoxy DNA sequencing. The oligonucleotides used for gel retardation assays were purified from 20% acrylamide, 50% urea gel, followed by elution, Sephadex G25 column chromatography, and annealing according to standard procedures (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 11.23-11.28Google Scholar). Synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase. DNA sequences of the oligonucleotides with deletions and mutations in the FER-1 element are shown in Fig. 4. Isolation of nuclear extracts and binding reaction were carried out as described previously (9Tsuji Y. Akebi N. Lam T.K. Nakabeppu Y. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5152-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In gel supershift experiments, 5–20 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated with 2 μg of antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C prior to incubation with oligonucleotide probes at room temperature for 15 min. All antibodies for gel supershift assays were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-Jun family (D, sc44x), anti-c-Jun (N, sc45x), anti-JunB (N-17, sc46x), anti-JunD (329, sc74x), anti-Fos family (K25, sc253x), anti-c-Fos (4, sc52x), anti-FosB (102, sc48x), anti-fra1 (N-17, sc183x), anti-fra2 (Q-20, sc604x), anti-ATF1/CREB1 (25C10G, sc270x), anti-CREB (C-21, sc186x, and 240, sc58x), anti-ATF1(C41–5.1, sc243x), anti-Sp1 (PEP2, sc59x) and anti-Sp3 (D-20, sc644x). Recombinant human ATF1 and Sp1 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Promega, respectively. Binding reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of 1.25 ng of end-labeled 37-bp FER-1 probe, 100 μg of bovine serum albumin, 1 μg of poly(dI·dC) in 20 μl of total volume. Protein-DNA complexes were separated by 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at 4 °C. Transfection of test plasmids into NIH3T3 cells was performed by DEAE-dextran method (8Tsuji Y. Kwak E. Saika T. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7270-7275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and F9, BNL CL.2, and L929 cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation method (20Tsuji Y. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1897-1907PubMed Google Scholar). CAT assay was carried out as described previously (8Tsuji Y. Kwak E. Saika T. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7270-7275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and individual spots on silica gel plates were measured by PhosphorImager analyzer (model 445Si, Molecular Dynamics). The FER-1 element was initially identified using NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts (9Tsuji Y. Akebi N. Lam T.K. Nakabeppu Y. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5152-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To determine whether the FER-1 element also participates in ferritin H transcriptional regulation in other cell types, we performed transfection experiments in the normal liver cell line BNL CL.2, the transformed cell line L929, and the teratocarcinoma cell line F9 as well. As shown in Table I, the insertion of the FER-1 element into a ferritin H-CAT construct lacking the FER-1 region increased the CAT activity in these cell lines. Similar results were observed in TA1 mouse preadipocytes (data not shown). These results suggest that the FER-1 element functions as a general basal enhancer of the ferritin H gene in cell lines with widely different tissue origins. Our previous studies demonstrated that Jun and Fos family members are components of the binding complex in the AP1-like element of FER-1 (9Tsuji Y. Akebi N. Lam T.K. Nakabeppu Y. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5152-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To identify the specific members of AP1 transcription factors bound to this element, we performed gel supershift experiments using antibodies specific to each member of the AP1 family. Nuclear extracts prepared from NIH3T3 cells were preincubated with either an antibody that broadly cross-reacts to the members of the Jun family or with specific antibodies against c-Jun, JunB, or JunD, followed by addition of a probe oligonucleotide with the consensus AP1 sequence (TGACTCA) or the AP1-like sequence of FER-1 (TGACAAA). As we observed previously, anti-Jun family antibody altered the mobility of the protein-DNA complexes derived from both probes (Fig. 1 A, lanes b and g). We then tested the reactivity of antibodies specific to each Jun family member to the proteins bound to the consensus AP1 oligonucleotide. As shown in Fig. 1 A, all antibodies induced an additional band with slower migration (lanes c–e), indicating that these three Jun family members exist in NIH3T3 cells and are able to bind to the consensus AP1 sequence. The same experiment was carried out with the AP1-like sequence of FER-1 as a probe (Fig. 1 A, lanes f–j). In contrast to the results obtained with the consensus AP1 oligonucleotide, only anti-JunD antibody induced a reproducible supershift in the mobility of the binding complex (Fig. 1 A, lane j), suggesting that among Jun family members, JunD is the major component of the AP1-like element binding complex. We next tested the effect of antibodies of Fos family members in gel shift assays. As shown in Fig. 1 B, addition of an antibody that was cross-reactive with each member of the Fos family caused a supershift and inhibition of original binding complexes not only to the consensus AP1 sequence but to the AP1-like sequence of FER-1 (Fig. 1 B, lanes b and h), suggesting the presence of Fos family members in these protein-DNA complexes. The use of specific antibodies against individual members of the Fos family demonstrated that anti-FosB and anti-fra1 antibodies induced a supershift of the consensus AP1 sequence binding complexes (Fig. 1 B, lanes d and e), whereas only anti-FosB antibody induced a supershift in the complexes bound to the AP1-like element of FER-1 (Fig. 1 B, lane j). Thus, we conclude that FosB is another component of the complex that binds to the AP1-like sequence of the FER-1 element. Because preliminary gel retardation assays had shown that an oligonucleotide with the consensus cAMP response element (CRE) (TGACGTCA) sequence was able to compete with the AP1-like element of FER-1 for binding of nuclear factors (data not shown), we also assessed the binding of members of the ATF/CREB family to the AP1-like element of FER-1. As shown in Fig. 1 C, anti-ATF1 antibody, which is cross-reactive to CREB1, caused a supershift in the mobility of protein complexes bound to the AP1-like element of FER-1 that was greater than that seen with the consensus AP1 element (lanes c and i). The use of antibodies specific to ATF1 and CREB1 demonstrated that anti-ATF1 antibody had the ability to alter the mobility of the AP1-like element binding complexes (Fig. 1 C, lane l), whereas two different antibodies to CREB1 had no effect (lanes j and k). Antibody specific to ATF1 or CREB1 did not affect the binding of factors to the consensus AP1 sequence (Fig. 1 C, lanes d–f). These results suggest that ATF1 is a third component bound to the AP1-like element of FER-1. We obtained similar results when these experiments were repeated with different preparations of nuclear extracts. Thus, among the AP1 and ATF/CREB families, the AP1-like sequence of FER-1 preferentially binds JunD, FosB, and ATF1. Selective members of the AP1 and ATF/CREB family recognize a consensus AP1 binding sequence or a consensus CREB binding sequence more strongly than related nucleotide sequences (21Ryseck R.-P. Bravo R. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 533-542PubMed Google Scholar). This was true when the AP1-like sequence of FER-1 was changed to a consensus AP1 binding sequence, which increased total protein binding by approximately 6-fold in gel retardation assay (data not shown, but see Fig. 1). We therefore asked whether substitution of the AP1-like sequence of FER-1 for a consensus AP1 or CRE sequence is able to increase the enhancer activity of the ferritin H gene. To address this question, we introduced nucleotide changes into the AP1-like sequence (TGACAAA) of FER-1 in pBluescript II KS(−) −4.8-kb FHCAT plasmid to create a consensus AP1 site (TGACTCA, −4.8-kb AP1FHCAT) or a consensus CRE site (TGACGTCA, −4.8-kb CREFHCAT). These CAT constructs were cotransfected into NIH3T3 cells with pUC18 or p12SE1A, and CAT activity in the cells was measured. As shown in Fig. 2, mutation of the AP1-like sequence of FER-1 to either the consensus AP1 or CRE site failed to increase basal enhancer activity of FER-1 or responsiveness to E1A-mediated repression. These results suggest that the participation of selective members of the AP1 and ATF/CREB families in the binding complex of the FER-1 element is more important than the magnitude of total protein binding and that the AP1-like nucleotide sequence of FER-1 is optimal for the enhancer activity of the ferritin H gene. We next assessed the functional involvement of JunD and FosB proteins in FER-1 enhancer activity. For this purpose, the AP1-like element of FER-1 or the entire FER-1 element was inserted into a ferritin H-CAT reporter gene lacking the FER-1-containing 3.8-kb region (pBluescript IIKS(−)ΔStuI/EcoRVFHCAT (9Tsuji Y. Akebi N. Lam T.K. Nakabeppu Y. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5152-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar)). These constructs were cotransfected into F9 cells with mouse JunD and FosB expression plasmids. F9 cells were chosen for this assay because they have low AP1 activity (22Imler J.L. Ugarte E. Wasylyk C. Wasylyk B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 3005-3012Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), which would minimize the effect of endogenous AP1 activity on the expression of our CAT reporter plasmids. The ferritin H-CAT construct lacking the FER-1 region expressed minimal CAT activity in F9 cells even if JunD and FosB expression plasmids were cotransfected (Fig. 3, columns a–d). In contrast, insertion of three copies of the AP1-like element of FER-1 by itself slightly increased the basal expression of CAT, probably due to a minor amount of endogenous AP1 activity in F9 cells (Fig. 3, column e). The CAT activity was further increased by cotransfection with JunD and FosB expression plasmids (Fig. 3, column g), whereas transfection of a mouse CREB expression plasmid failed to increase the CAT activity (data not shown). Insertion of two copies of the entire FER-1 element (containing the AP1-like element and the dyad element) in the same CAT vector by itself further increased the basal expression of CAT (Fig. 3, column i), as we observed previously (9Tsuji Y. Akebi N. Lam T.K. Nakabeppu Y. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5152-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and this CAT expression was similarly augmented by transfection of JunD and FosB expression plasmids (Fig. 3, column k). In both cases, cotransfection of E1A decreased the CAT activity stimulated by JunD and FosB expression plasmids (Fig. 3, compare column g withcolumn h and column k with column l). These results support the concept that JunD and FosB participate in FER-1 enhancer activity and that they are targets for transcriptional repression by E1A. Our previous results demonstrated that a mutation in the dyad element that eliminates both dyad symmetry and the ability to bind nuclear factors decreased FER-1 enhancer activity (9Tsuji Y. Akebi N. Lam T.K. Nakabeppu Y. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5152-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, the key nucleotide sequences in the dyad element required for protein binding and the nature of nuclear factors binding to this element remain unknown. To address these questions, we tested FER-1 oligonucleotides containing various partial sequences of the dyad element for their ability to bind proteins in a gel retardation assay (Fig. 4). Oligonucleotide probes containing the AP1-like element alone (Fig. 4, AP1-like), the AP1-like element plus a partial dyad sequence containing a deletion of 15 nucleotides (FER-1Δ15) and the AP1-like element plus a dyad sequence containing a deletion of 9 nucleotides (FER-1Δ9) all gave rise to a similar retarded band. This represented the interaction between AP1 transcription factors and the AP1-like element, as judged by competition experiments demonstrating competition by the AP1-like oligonucleotide and absence of competition by the dyad (Fig. 4, FER-1Δ9). In contrast, reconstitution of FER-1 by the addition of 9 nucleotides conferred the ability to interact with additional proteins (see Fig. 4, FER-1, no competitor), suggesting that the complete dyad sequence or at least the 3′ portion of the dyad element including 5′-CCCTCCAAA-3′ (compare FER-1Δ9 with FER-1) is important for protein interaction. In fact, mutations in this sequence (Fig. 4, mDyad-2) consistently caused the loss of ability to bind a set of proteins. We next tested the contribution of the 5′ portion of the dyad element to this protein interaction. For this purpose, we tested the protein binding ability of an oligonucleotide with three mutations in the 5′ portion of the dyad element. Unexpectedly, this mutant dyad oligonucleotide (Fig. 4, mDyad-2) retained the ability to bind the same set of proteins with an affinity similar to that exhibited by the nonmutated dyad element (Fig. 4, Dyad), indicating that the 5′ portion of the dyad sequence is not directly involved in protein binding. This result also suggests that the disruption of dyad symmetry per se does not necessarily affect protein binding. To further test this possibility, we made a nonsymmetrical oligonucleotide by creating additional mutations in the 3′ portion of the dyad element. These mutations (Fig. 4, mDyad-3) did not disrupt the binding of nuclear factors. These results indicate that the 3–5 nucleotides at the 3′ and 5′ ends of the dyad element of FER-1 are not essential for protein interaction. We then asked whether the ability to bind proteins was necessary for activity of the dyad element of FER-1 in vivo. We introduced the same five nucleotide changes into the dyad symmetry sequence of FER-1 in the −4.8-kb FHCAT plasmid, resulting either in the loss of ability to bind proteins (−4.8-kb mDyad-1 FHCAT) or in the retention of binding ability (−4.8-kb mDyad-3 FHCAT). These CAT constructs were transiently cotransfected into NIH3T3 cells with pUC18 or p12SE1A. Despite the destruction of dyad symmetry in both constructs, a significant reduction in basal activity was only observed in the construct in which protein binding activity had been abrogated (Table II). These results suggest that the complete dyad symmetry sequence of the FER-1 element, and dyad symmetryper se are not essential for maximum enhancer activity of the ferritin H gene. Both constructs still responded to the E1A-mediated repression of promoter activity (Table II), consistent with our results suggesting that E1A represses FER-1 enhancer activity primarily through inhibition of AP"

We also demonstrate that the Lgals4 gene encoding galectin-4 is distinct from Lgals6, and that these two genes are very close together on mouse chromosome 7. Unless otherwise indicated, all nucleic acid enzymes were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim and all chemicals were from Sigma. Nitrocellulose filters were from Schleicher & Schuell, and Magnagraph nylon filters for blotting were purchased from Micron Separations Inc. (Westboro, MA). [α-32P]Deoxycytidine 5′-triphosphate (3000 Ci/mmol) and [35S]deoxyadenosine 5′-(α-thio)triphosphate (1000–1500 Ci/ml, sequencing grade) were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. For general molecular biological techniques such as hybridization screening, restriction, gel electrophoresis, blotting, and elution, we followed protocols collected by Maniatis et al. (15Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides are listed in Table I. For probing of Southern blots, the oligonucleotides were labeled with digoxigenin by 3′ tailing using digoxigenin-11-dideoxyUTP and terminal deoxynucleotide transferase, and visualized by chemiluminescence after treatment with conjugated anti-digoxigenin and using reagents and procedures from Boehringer Mannheim. Hybridization was done at 37 °C in hybridization buffer (200 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.2, 7% SDS, 1% bovine serum albumin, 15% formamide, 1 mm EDTA), and blots were washed for 10 min at room temperature in 2 × SSC, 1% SDS.Table IOligonucleotidesName1-aOligonucleotides that were designed based on the mouse galectin-6 gene sequence are named mG6X, and those designed based on the rat galectin-4 sequence are named rG4X.

Open table in a new tab PCR was carried out using Ampli-Taq (Perkin-Elmer). One μl of different dilutions of template was mixed with 25 pmol of each primer, buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mmKCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.001% (w/v) gelatin), and 250 μm deoxynucleotides. Amplification consisted of 45 cycles: 40 s of denaturation at 96 °C for the first five cycles and 94 °C for the remaining cycles, 1 min of annealing at 60 °C, and 1–4 min of extension at 72 °C. Amplified fragments were visualized and purified on 1% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide. Excised fragments were electroeluted, phenol-extracted, and precipitated with ethanol. A mouse genomic DNA (strain 129/SV) library in λFIXII (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was screened with a cDNA probe containing all the coding sequence but no untranslated sequence of rat galectin-4 (16Oda Y. Herrmann J. Gitt M.A. Turck C. Burlingame A.L. Barondes S.H. Leffler H. J. Biol Chem. 1993; 268: 5929-5939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random primer polymerization (17Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 266-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar) and used in hybridization screening (15Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar) of approximately 1 × 106 plaques using Escherichia coli SRB as host. The hybridization was done in hybridization buffer (see above) plus 20% dextran sulfate at 52 °C with 2.4 × 105cpm/ml probe. Washes were done at the hybridization temperature, first in 2 × SSC (15Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar), 1% SDS, then in 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, 30 min each. After drying, the filters were autoradiographed, using X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak Co.) and intensifying screens at −70 °C. One phage clone, λLgals6, was isolated by plaque purification, and its DNA was purified from high titer liquid culture. The lysate was centrifuged at 6000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was treated with 10 μg/ml DNase and 20 μg/ml RNase, after which the phage were precipitated for 1 h at 4 °C with 10% PEG 8000 in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mNaCl, 5 mm MgSO4 (final concentrations). The pellet was resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgSO4, and extracted with phenol and chloroform. Finally, the phage DNA was precipitated with isopropanol and resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA. The purified DNA from λLgals6 was digested byXbaI, and the two of the resulting three fragments that hybridized with the rat galectin-4 cDNA probe were subcloned into pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), generating clones pLgals6-1 and pLgals6-2. pLgals6-3 containing a DNA fragment spanning the junction between clones pLgals6-1 and pLgals6-2 was isolated by PCR between primers mG6M and rG4F using λLgals6 as template followed by cloning into pCRII (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Further subcloning of fragments of these Xba fragments is described in Fig. 1. Clones pLgals6-1a, pLgals6-2b, pLgals6-2c, and pLgals6-2f were generated by ApaI, HindIII, PstI, and SstI digestion, respectively, of the appropriate plasmid, followed by religation. DNA fragments from pLgals6-2 were subcloned into pBluescript yielding clones pLgals6-2a (2-kb HindIII fragment), pLgals6-2d (1-kb HincII fragment), pLgals6-2e (400-bp NcoI fragment), and pLgals6-2g (800-bp PvuII/PstI fragment). Additional fragments were generated by PCR and analyzed directly (fLgals6-1b) or cloned into pCRII (Invitrogen)(pLgals6-1c and pLgals6-2h). fLgals6-1b and pLgals6-2h were from PCR between the primer pairs mG6F/rG4C and mG6N/rG4G, respectively. To generate a clone containing upstream sequence, we used pLgals6-1 as template in PCR with the vector-specific T3 primer and the intron I-specific antisense primer mG6E. However, the resulting product, clone pLgals6-1c, contains only 227 bp of the upstream sequence because the mG6E oligonucleotide, in addition to the expected priming site in intron 1, inadvertently primed at a site within the upstream region (nt −227 through −223, AAGGG, identical to the 3′-end of this primer). The different subclones were sequenced using primers synthesized based on rat galectin-4 sequence (16Oda Y. Herrmann J. Gitt M.A. Turck C. Burlingame A.L. Barondes S.H. Leffler H. J. Biol Chem. 1993; 268: 5929-5939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and later, mouse galectin-6 sequence (see Table I), as well as vector-specific primers. In most cases, we used a modification (10Gitt M.A. Barondes S.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) of the Sanger technique (18Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52250) Google Scholar) using Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical), as described by the manufacturer. Denatured double-stranded DNA prepared by the method of Kraft et al. (19Kraft R. Tardiff J. Krauter K.S. Leinwand L.A. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 544-549PubMed Google Scholar) was the template. To eliminate artifactual banding caused by presumed secondary structure in intron 7, we used the method described by McCrea et al. (20McCrea K.W. Marrs C.F. Gilsdorf J.R. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 843-844PubMed Google Scholar) employing a terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase chase after the termination reaction. All exonic regions, intron boundaries, upstream and downstream sequences were verified by sequencing on both strands, except for the 3′ end of exon 6, which, because of the repetitive DNA in intron 6, was confirmed by sequencing with different primers on the same strand. Inbred mouse strain 129/SV genomic DNA (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) was amplified by means of oligodeoxynucleotides representing sequences distributed throughout the galectin-4 gene. Oligonucleotides mG6F and rG4C gave clear non-cDNA-sized bands on amplification, and therefore a sample of the reaction was ligated into plasmid pCRII (Invitrogen). DNA of selected clones was sequenced using T7 and M13 reverse primers, and the gene-specific primers mG6H and mG6K to obtain sequence on both strands. The size of each intron was determined by one of several methods. Introns 1, 4, 5, and 7 were sequenced completely. The size of intron 3 was determined by ApaI restriction digest analysis of clone pLgals6-1. Introns 2 and 6 were sized by PCR amplification between exonic primers surrounding the respective intron to generate fLgals6-1b and pLgals6-2h (Fig. 1). The identity of the PCR products was confirmed by sequencing the ends of each fragment, and the size was determined by gel electrophoresis. Intron sizes aided in the analysis of restriction digest data of both pLgals6-1 and pLgals6-2. We used a modified version of the procedure summarized by Ausubel et al. (21Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates/John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1992Google Scholar). For galectin-6, we used the antisense primer mG6Q (Table I), and as controls we used the antisense primers corresponding to mouse β-actin (GenBank™ accession no. X03672; CACATGCCGGAGCCGTTGTCGACGACCAGC) and GAPDH (GenBank™ accession no. M32599; TCTCCACTTTGCCACTGCAAATGGCAGCCC). The primers were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase and purified by ethanol precipitation in the presence of ammonium acetate as described (15Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). After resuspension in 100 μl of TE, 3.5 μl of the labeled primer was combined with 10 μl of mouse colon RNA, 1.5 μl of hybridization buffer, and heated for 90 min at 65 °C and then cooled to room temperature. Buffer, dNTPs, actinomycin D, 1 unit/μl RNasin (Promega), and avian myeloblastosis reverse transcriptase (Boehringer Mannheim) were then added to the hybridization mixture and incubated for 1 h at 42 °C. After RNase digestion and phenol extraction, the cDNAs were precipitated with ethanol, washed, then resuspended in loading buffer (47.5% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.025% bromphenol blue, 0.025% xylene cyanol FF) and denatured for 5 min at 80 °C, before electrophoresis on an 8 m urea 8% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. Molecular weight marker was prepared by digesting φx174 DNA (Life Technologies, Inc.) with HinfI and then 5′ labeling with [γ-32P]ATP (15Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). The chromosomal localization of Lgals4 and Lgals6 was mapped by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) linkage analysis in an interspecific backcross between Mus spretus and C57BL/6J mice ((C57BL/6J × Mus spretus) F1 × C57BL/6J) (22Warden C.H. Mehrabian M.M. He K.-Y. Yoon M.-Y. Diep A. Xia Y.-R. Svenson K.L. Sparkes R.S. Lusis A.J. Genomics. 1993; 18: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). At first, a Southern blot of genomic DNA from both C57BL/6J and M. spretus digested with several different restriction enzymes (BamHI, BglII, EcoRI, HindIII, MspI, PstI, PvuII, SstI, TaqI, and XbaI) was probed with either the insert from pLgals6-1c (Fig. 1) specific for Lgals6, or the rat galectin-4 cDNA detecting both Lgals4 and Lgals6. MspI- and HindIII-digested DNA resulted in different sizes of hybridizing bands from the two parental strains (RFLPs) for the Lgals6 probe and galectin-4 cDNA probe, respectively. DNA extracted from 66 progeny of the backcross was cut with MspI or HindIII, electrophoresed, blotted, and hybridized with the appropriate probe. The pattern of M. spretus-specific bands in the 66 progeny was then compared with patterns of parental polymorphic bands observed for other, previously mapped, genes to obtain linkage with other markers. The clone λLgals6 was isolated by screening a mouse (strain 129/SV) genomic λFIX-II library using rat galectin-4 cDNA as a probe, and characterized by restriction mapping, subcloning and sequencing as shown in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3. The insert was split into two 4.8-kb fragments and one 3.7-kb fragment by XbaI. One of the 4.8-kb fragments and the 3.7-kb fragment were subcloned into pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene), with resultant colonies (pLgals6-1 and pLgals6-2, respectively) hybridizing to the rat galectin-4 cDNA probe (Fig. 1). Sequencing the ends revealed that the 4.8-kb insert of pLgals6-1 contained λFIX-II sequence (stippled in Fig. 1) and thus came from one end of the λLgals6 insert, whereas the 3.7-kb insert in pLgals6-2 lacked λFIX-II sequence and thus came from the middle of the λLgals6 insert (Fig. 1). Moreover, the sequence of a DNA fragment (pLgals6-3) spanning the junction between pLgals6-1 and pLgals6-2 inserts showed that they are joined together and no intervening fragment had been overlooked. Probing of Southern dot blots of pLgals6-1 and pLgals6-2 with oligonucleotides revealed that pLgals6-1 contained the 5′ end of the gene and pLgals6-2 contained the 3′ end of the gene. To sequence the gene, additional subclones were generated from pLgals6-1 and pLgals6-2 as described in Fig. 1, and sequenced with both vector-specific and gene-specific oligonucleotide primers (Table I). The sequencing “strategy” and restriction map are shown in Fig. 2, and the sequence in Fig. 3.Figure 3Sequence of Lgals6.

This gene is named Lgals6 in accordance with the naming of other galectin genes (23Mehrabian M. Gitt M.A. Sparkes R.S. Leffler H. Barondes S.H. Lusis A.J.

Galectin-6 is encoded by eight exons. Sequence alignment with other galectins suggests that the overall organization of the part of the genes encoding the CRDs is conserved (Figs. 4 and 5). Thus, exons 2–4 and 6–8 of galectin-6 correspond to exons 2–4 of galectins-1 and -2 (10Gitt M.A. Barondes S.H.

The site of the boundaries of these exons within the Lgals6 sequence appear to be highly conserved with one exception (Fig. 5). Exons 3 of Lgals6 (encoding part of the galectin-6 domain I) and CLC (encoding galectin-10, Ref. 14Dyer K.D. Handen J.S. Rosenberg H.F. Genomics. 1997; 40: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) are 30–47 nucleotides longer than the exons encoding the corresponding part of galectins-1 and -2 (exon 3), C16 (exon 3), galectin-3 (exon 5), and domain II of galectin-6 (exon 7), resulting in a 30-nucleotide downstream shift of the 3′ exon-intron boundary. Since exon 4 of Lgals6 has the same length as the corresponding exons in the other galectin genes, its 3′ end is also shifted downstream. Hence, in addition to the last part of the carbohydrate-binding domain I, exon-4 of Lgals6encodes part of the link region in galectin-6. Exons 1 and 5 of Lgals6 encode sequences that are not part of the tightly folded carbohydrate-binding domains (open boxes in Fig. 4). Similarly, exon 1 in LGALS1 and LGALS2, and the CLC gene encode the first few amino acids that are disordered in the crystal structures of galectin-1, -2, and -10 (24Liao D.I. Kapadia G. Ahmed H.

The sequence encoded by exon 5 of galectin-6 forms most of the link region between the two CRDs; the rest of the link region is, as mentioned above, encoded by the last part of exon 4. Considering the high amount of sequence identity between galectin-4 and galectin-6 elsewhere (3Gitt M.A. Colnot C. Poirier F. Barondes S.H. Leffler H. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2012574964,"A human antibody library was displayed on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage and screened for binding to human interleukin-6 (IL-6). Two antibody-bearing phages were selected that bound IL-6. The complementary-determining region 3 loops of the variable heavy chains of these two antibodies differed in length and sequence and recognized two distinct epitopes. One of the single chain Fv fragments isolated (H1) was found to bind human (but not murine) IL-6 with an affinity comparable to that of the human IL-6 receptor. H1 also recognized newly synthesized human IL-6 intracellularly, as shown by indirect immunofluorescence. H1 did not neutralize human IL-6, and the H1 epitope was mapped to a region of IL-6 not involved in interactions with IL-6, IL-6 receptor, or the signal-transducing protein gp130. To target IL-6-secreting cells, we then constructed a bispecific antibody fragment (a diabody) comprising H1 and the antigen binding site of the T-cell activating monoclonal antibody OKT3. The diabody led to T-cell-mediated killing of cells secreting IL-6."

Almost opposite effects on annexin function are elicited by BDA250 and diazepam, its 7-chloro-derivative. We conclude that benzodiazepines modulate the calcium influx activity of annexins allosterically by stabilizing or destabilizing the conducting state of peripherally bound annexins in agreement with suggestions by Kaneko (Kaneko, N., Ago, H., Matsuda, R., Inagaki, E., and Miyano, M.

Starke K. Allgemeine und spezielle Pharmakologie und Toxikologie. 7th Ed. Spektrum Akademischer Verlag, Heidelberg1996: 301-307Google Scholar). Psychopharmaceutical effects are also reported for these substances, but the molecular mechanism of their action is not yet well understood. Benzodiazepines have been found to bind with high affinity to a defined receptor population in the brain, that has been identified as the GABAA receptor. The affinity of different benzodiazepine derivatives to this receptor correlates well with their pharmacological potency and their binding site is apparently localized on the receptor close to the GABA-binding site (4Hommer D.W. Skolnick P. Paul S.M. Meltzer H.Y. Pharamcology: The Third Generation of Progress. Raven, New York1987: 977-983Google Scholar, 5Rang H.P. Dale M.M. Pharmacology 2nd Ed. Churchill Livingstone, Edinburgh1991: 634-635Google Scholar). The models of mechanism of action proposed so far suggest a cooperative effect of both GABA and benzodiazepine on the opening of the chloride channel. Recently, diazepam was shown to increase the conductance of GABAA channels up to 7-fold in rat cultured hippocampal neurons (6Eghball M. Curmi J.P. Birnir B. Gage P.W. Nature. 1997; 388: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Benzodiazepine-related compounds are one of the most important classes of bioavailable therapeutic agents with widespread biological activities including anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, and antihypnotic activities (7Sternbach L.H.

To these multiple actions of benzodiazepine compounds was added recently the finding that the cardiac protective agent K201, a benzothiazepine derivative, inhibits annexin V binding to actinin vitro (15Kaneko N. Drug Dev. Res. 1994; 33: 429-438Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Its effect on annexin-induced calcium influx has also been studied and its binding site defined (1Kaneko N. Ago H. Matsuda R. Inagaki E. Miyano M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 16-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Based on these observations we analyzed in detail a potential interaction between annexins and benzodiazepines. We report here that complex formation occurs between annexins and various benzodiazepines among which are the newly synthesized cholecystokinin-A and cholecystokinin-B receptor antagonists, as well as known pharamaceuticals like diazepam. Since the physiological function of annexins is still not yet fully understood, the interaction of these proteins with benzodiazepines might open new lines of investigation of the role of annexins in vivo. Porcine annexin I was purified from bacteria expressing the recombinant protein (16Seemann J. Weber K. Osborn M. Partan L.G. Gerke V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1359-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Recombinant human annexin II containing a N-terminal elongation of six residues (MRGSFK) was purified from the appropriately transformed bacteria as described (17Thiel C. Weber K. Gerke V. J. Biol.

The N-terminal deletion mutants AV-N1 (Δ1–6), AV-N3 (Δ1–13), and AV-N4 (Δ1–14) were made by introducing mutations in the annexin V wild-type cDNA, 1J. Benz, unpublished results. expressed and purified according to the wild-type protocol. The synthesis and biological properties of the benzodiazepine derivatives BDA452, BDA250, and BDA753 (see Fig. 1) will be discussed elsewhere. Diazepam (DZM) and 4-bromo-A23187 were purchased from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany), N-acetyltryptophan-amide (Trp) from Bachem (Switzerland), and the pentasodium salt of FURA-2 was from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Rhombohedral annexin V wild-type crystals were grown by vapor diffusion at room temperature against 1 mmCaCl2, 1.9 m(NH4)2SO4, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0. Crystals were then soaked with 5 mm benzodiazepine in the harvesting buffer for several days. Co-crystallization was also attempted, but failed as no crystal growth was observed. The crystals with space group R3 have cell constants a =b = 160.93 Å, c = 36.90 Å and contain one molecule per asymmetric unit (21Huber R. Römisch J. Paques E.P.

Data were measured on a MAR image plate system (MAR Research, Hamburg) mounted on a Rigaku rotating anode generator (λ = 1.5418 Å). Data analysis was performed with the MOSFLM program package (23Leslie A.G.W. Mosflm, Version 5.20. MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK1994Google Scholar) and data reduction with the CCP4 program suite (24CCP4 Acta Cryst. Sect.

Starting from the annexin V-WT structure, refinement was initiated with X-PLOR (25Brünger A.T. X-PLOR, A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar), using the conjugate gradient minimization. A 2Fo − Fc map was calculated and used for inspection and model building of the benzodiazepine on a graphics terminal with FRODO (26Jones T.A. J. Appl. Cryst. 1978; 15: 24-31Google Scholar).

Best crystals were obtained from a solution of 15 mg/ml protein in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 20 mmCaCl2, 2 mm benzodiazepine, and 1 m(NH4)2SO4 in the drop, in vapor diffusion against a well containing a double concentration of the precipitating agent. Data were collected on the DW32 station of the DCI storage ring at LURE, Orsay, which is equipped with a MAR image plate system (MAR Research), using a wavelength of 0.97 Å. Data analysis was performed with the program DENZO and SCALEPACK (29Otwinovski, Z., Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend “Data Collection and Processing”, Sawyer, L., Isaacs, N., Bailey, S., 1993, SERC Daresbury Laboratory, UK.Google Scholar, 55Minor W.

D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The data statistics are summarized in Table I. Since the data were nonisomorphous with both wild-type annexin III data, as well as data of annexin III co-crystallized with inositol phosphate (30Perron B. Lewit-Bentley A. Geny B. Russo-Marie F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11321-11326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the structure analysis had to be started using the rigid-body refinement option in X-PLOR (25Brünger A.T. X-PLOR, A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). Subsequent refinement was performed with REFMAC from the CCP4 program suite (24CCP4 Acta Cryst. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar), and the solvent molecules were built and inspected using O (31Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjelgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Phospholipid vesicles were prepared according to Reeves and Dowben (32Reeves J.P. Dowben R.M. J. Cell Physiol. 1968; 73: 49-60Crossref Scopus (504) Google Scholar) by mixing phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine (Avanti Polar Lipids) at a molar ratio of 3:1 in chloroform (total lipid amount for centrifugation assay: 10 μmol, for all other experiments: 1 μmol). The solution was dried under a stream of nitrogen for 30 min and then exposed to a stream of water-saturated nitrogen for another 30 min. Lipids for the centrifugation assay were covered with a 0.2 m saccharose solution and the vesicles were allowed to swell overnight at 19 °C. For the use in fluorescence titration experiments, the lipids were covered with buffer (180 mm saccharose, 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4) and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The liposomes for the calcium influx assay were covered with 2 ml of buffer F1 (100 μm FURA-2, 180 μm EDTA, 162 mmsaccharose, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The vesicles were pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min. After resuspension in 200 μl of buffer F2 (200 μm EDTA, 180 mm saccharose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) they were centrifugated again, resuspended in buffer F2 and applied to a S200 spin column (Pharmacia). After two additional centrifugation steps, the liposome pellet was finally resuspended in 200 μl of F2. Aliquots of 20 μl were used for the calcium influx assay. All final collection steps for the different liposome preparations were done by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min. Samples of 500 μl for binding assays contained the appropriate concentration of the given benzodiazepine, a 20-μl aliquot of phospholipid vesicles suspended in 5 mm TRIS, pH 7.4, 180 mm saccharose, and 1 mm CaCl2. The components of the sample were mixed and after 10 min the phospholipid vesicles were separated by centrifugation at 130,000 ×g for 30 min (4 °C). Binding of benzodiazepines to the vesicles was quantified by measuring the UV absorbance of the supernatant at 280 nm with a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 17 UV/Vis spectrophotometer. Control experiments were performed in the absence of lipid vesicles. For calcium-dependent annexin binding 100 μg of annexin V (6 μm) from a highly concentrated stock solution were added to the sample containing 1 μmol of lipid suspended in the above mentioned buffer, the appropriate amount of CaCl2 and 100 μm BDA452. Centrifugation and measurements followed the same protocol. As a control the annexin binding assay was repeated in the absence of BDA452. The calcium influx into liposomes was monitored by using the calcium-sensitive dye FURA-2 (33Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and the FURA assay was performed following the protocol described by Berendes et al. (34Berendes R. Burger A. Voges D. Demange P. Huber R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 317: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To increase the stability of the FURA liposomes, all solutions were saturated with Ar. A 20-μl aliquot of the FURA-loaded liposome suspension was mixed with 475 μl of buffer F2, and 5 μl of a 50 mm CaCl2 solution was added. The fluorescence intensity was measured at 510 nm with the sample excited at 340 and 380 nm at time intervals of 1 min. After an equilibration time of 4 min the protein was added from a concentrated stock solution and so was the benzodiazepine derivative from a Me2SO 2The abbreviations used are: Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PS, phosphatidylserine; CF, carboxyfluorescein; DZM, diazepam. -containing stock solution. The Me2SO content of the sample did not exceed 1% of the total sample volume in any experiment. Fluorescence measurements were carried out in 1-min intervals. At t= 36 min, 3 μl of a solution of Br-A23187 (0.1 mg/ml) was added to determine the maximal possible calcium signal. Intensity measurements were continued until t = 40 min. Data analysis was performed by normalizing the fluorescence ratioF(340 nm)/F(380 nm)with respect to the maximal possible fluorescence ratio obtained from the values after addition of the ionophore Br-A23187 (36–40 min). The normalized fluorescence ratio f is plotted versustime, thereby yielding an influx curve. For further analysis the slope α of the time interval 15–35 min was used as an activity parameter (“steady state”). Alternatively, the initial slope β of the influx curve, starting at t = 4 min, was analyzed. The percentage of inhibition/activation was calculated using the steady state slope and the initial slope, respectively, of the influx experiment in the absence of benzodiazepine. Fluorescence measurements were performed on a Perkin-Elmer 650-40 fluorescence spectrophotometer with a spectral bandwidth of 5 nm (excitation slit) and 5 nm (emission slit). The shutter was closed between the measurements to avoid photobleaching effects. Binding of benzodiazepine derivatives to annexin was monitored by quenching of the protein fluorescence, using a Perkin-Elmer 650-40 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Protein was added to 500 μl of buffer (5 mm TRIS, 0.01% NaN3, pH 7.4) and the change in fluorescence intensity was examined as a function of benzodiazepine concentration. The benzodiazepine derivatives were added in 1-μl aliquots from stock solutions (1 mm, 10 mm) in Me2SO. The data were normalized with respect to protein fluorescence intensity at an excitation wavelength of 280 nm. A control experiment was performed recording the concentration-dependent fluorescence of the benzodiazepine derivative and, similarly, the protein was titrated with Me2SO in 1-μl portions to yield the maximal possible fluorescence intensity in each titration step. These binding experiments were also performed in the presence of PS/PE liposomes (3:1) following an analogous protocol. The buffer used for the liposome containing experiments (F3) consists of 180 mm saccharose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Assuming a simple complex formation, Annexin+ligand⇌[annexin­ligand]Equation 1 the fraction of complexed annexin is x([AL]) corresponding to the normalized fluorescence f([AL]) which can be calculated by Equation 2, f([AL])=f0(A)−f(A)=F(annexin,Me2SO)F(annexin,280nm)−F(annexin,ligand)−F(ligand)F(annexin,280nm)Equation 2 where F(annexin, Me2SO) is the fluorescence intensity of annexin in the presence of Me2SO, F(annexin, ligand) the measured intensity during the titration and F(ligand) the fluorescence intensity of the benzodiazepine. Division by F(annexin, 280 nm) normalizes the experimental values with respect to protein fluorescence without ligand and Me2SO. The dissociation constant Kd was determined by nonlinear least-squares fit of the data to a binding curve with a Hill coefficient of n = 1. The quenching of fluorescence intensity was also analyzed in terms of the Stern-Volmer equation (35Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 257-301Crossref Google Scholar), I0I=F(annexin,Me2SO)F(annexin,ligand)−F(ligand)=1+Kq∗c(ligand)Equation 3 where I represents the protein fluorescence intensity in the presence of the ligand and I0 the intensity in its absence. Liposomes for the leakage assay were prepared as described (34Berendes R. Burger A. Voges D. Demange P. Huber R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 317: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), except that 50 mm carboxyfluorescein (CF; obtained from Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) was included into the buffer to monitor leakage (36Wilschut J. Düzgünes N. Fraley R. Papahadjopoulos D. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 6011-6021Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Nonencapsulated CF was separated by gel filtration runs on S200 microspin columns (Pharmacia). Leakage was investigated by adding aliquots of the benzodiazepine derivatives to the vesicle suspension directly in the cuvette used for fluorescence determination. Excitation was set to 480 nm and the emission was detected at 540 nm. The results are expressed as, CF−leakage[%]=100∗F−FiFe−FiEquation 4 where Fi is the initial fluorescence intensity before adding the protein, F is the fluorescence reading at different times, and Fe is the final fluorescence determined after adding Triton X-100 to the liposome suspension (final concentration 0.1%). The crystal form of annexin V used, as well as annexin III, have the Trp-187 containing loop of domain III exposed on the surface of the protein. As described previously (37Berendes R. Voges D. Demange P. Huber R. Burger A. Science. 1993; 262: 427-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), five α-helices (A to E) form one domain, with the axes of helices A, B, D, and E almost anti-parallel to each other, whereas the connecting helix C lies approximately perpendicular to them. The four domains (I to IV) are arranged in a cyclic array with domains I/IV and II/III forming two modules with pseudo 2-fold symmetry. In the center of the molecule a prominent pore is created by helices IIA, IIB, IVA, and IVB, lined with highly conserved charged or polar residues. The calcium-binding sites are located on the convex side of the protein within a 17-amino acid sequence called the endonexin-fold (38Geisow M.J. Fritsche U. Hexham J.M. Dash B. Johnson T. Nature. 1986; 320: 636-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), which has been shown to bind to the membrane (39Voges D. Berendes R. Burger A. Demange P. Baumeister W. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The N and C termini lie on the opposite, concave side of the molecule. The structure of annexin V in complex with the ligand BDA452 reveals that the ligand is bound in a cavity (Fig. 2) which is located at the interface of domains II, III, and IV at the concave side of the molecule. The strongly bent BDA452 molecule (Fig. 3 B) interacts with all domains in that cleft in a hydrophobic manner, sharing a contact surface of about 373 Å2 with the protein. The most prominent contact residues are Thr-118 (loop IIB/IIC), Pro-119 (IIC), Glu-120 (IIC), Arg-161 (loop IIE/IIIA), Asp-164 (loop IIE/IIIA), Val-203 (IIIC), Arg-207 (IIIC), Ser-243 (IIIE), and Ser-247 (IVA) (Fig. 3 A). Despite a prevalent positive charge of the protein in the binding cleft no notable polar interactions could be identified and the closest distance of BDA452 to the protein atoms is above 3.1 Å. The ε-imino group of Arg-207 faces the 5-phenyl group of the ligand. No major rearrangement of the protein structure is observed in the complex structure when compared with the structure of ligand-free protein. A contact of the ligand to the N terminus seems possible but could not be identified in the structure since residues 1–4 are not defined in the electron density. From the localization of the ligand on the concave side we conclude that the membrane binding behavior of annexin V is not affected directly by binding of BDA452.Figure 3A, structure of BDA452 bound to annexin V. The bound ligand BDA452 is shown in yellow. Residues of the binding cleft with the shortest distance to the ligand are highlighted in bright blue. The protein backbone is colored in dark blue.

The electron density around the bound BDA452 is contoured at 1ς cutoff. Whereas the tryptophan moiety and the aromatic rings are well defined, the seven-membered ring is only visible partially, thereby suggesting high flexibility.

Although there is a high electron density peak in all of these structures no reliable model building was possible for complexes AV-DZM, AV-BDA250, and AV-BDA753, probably due to substantial disorder. This observation is supportive of a remarkable flexibility of the benzodiazepine derivatives even in the protein-bound state. Additionally, the binding site might only be occupied partially. The annexin III-BDA452 complex electron density shows a peak of difference density in the analogous region as for annexin V. This peak is, however, not sufficiently well defined to give detailed information on the ligand structure. The best fit of the benzodiazepine obtained indicates a nonspecific interaction, with the 5-phenyl group of the ligand facing the side chain of Phe-206, with Arg-164 close by (annexin III numbering). The indole moiety of BDA452 points toward the N terminus, which is well defined up to Ser-2. The interaction with BDA452 provokes slight displacements of the connecting segments between domains II and III, and domains III and IV which line the binding cavity. Lipid membranes and benzodiazepines may interact directly as suggested by recent experiments, which show that different benzodiazepine derivatives insert into lipid bilayers to different extents (40Garcia D.A. Perillo M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1324: 76-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Binding of the benzodiazepine BDA452 to PS/PE liposomes (3:1) was examined by the centrifugation assay. In this assay a decrease of absorption in the supernatant is observed when compared with the absorption curve of pure BDA452 (Fig. 4 A). At an initial concentration of 100 μm BDA452 approximately 80% of the benzodiazepine is bound to the membrane. In the presence of BDA452 the annexin V binding curve is not significantly affected if compared with measurements without BDA452 (Fig. 4 B). Fig. 5 A shows the titration of 3 μm annexin V with BDA452 (0–280 μm). Binding of the benzodiazepine to the protein results in substantial quenching of fluorescence emission intensity of the protein excited at 280 nm. Data analysis according to Equation 2 yields the dissociation constants Kd, which are summarized in Table I. Although the data shown in Fig. 5 A might suggest a biphasic interaction of BDA452 with annexin V, a monophasic model was applied to all binding experiments, since neither the crystallographic results nor data analysis according to Stern-Volmer relations indicate a biphasic behavior. To ensure that the fluorescence quenching is due to a specific interaction of the benzodiazepine derivative with annexin, a control titration experiment was done withN-acetyltryptophan-amide at concentrations from 0 to 32 μm. The addition of N-acetyltryptophan-amide to an annexin solution does not result in any specific fluorescence quenching within the concentration range tested (Fig. 5 B). Considerable scattering of data is observed in the presence of higherN-acetyltryptophan-amide concentrations presumably due to the high intrinsic fluorescence of this derivative. It has to be noted that reproducible quenching data were only obtained with benzodiazepine derivatives carrying a fluorophore group. Measuring of binding parameters was therefore limited to BDA452 and BDA753. As mentioned above, control titration experiments were also performed with annexins and Me2SO revealing that the protein fluorescence is affected by the prese"

Grimes S. Anderson D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3505-3509Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). A unique 174-base φ29-encoded RNA, termed prohead RNA (pRNA), is present on the portal vertex (head-tail connector) of the prohead and is an essential constituent of the DNA packaging machine (2Guo P. Erickson S. Anderson D. Science. 1987; 236: 690-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). pRNA is hypothesized to bind a supercoiled DNA-gp3-gp16 complex to link the DNA and prohead (3Grimes S. Anderson D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 901-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), recognize the left end of the DNA-gp3, which is packaged first (4Grimes S. Anderson D. J. Mol.

Biol. 1990; 215: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The secondary structure of the pRNA was established by a phylogenetic analysis (6Bailey S. Wichitwechkarn J. Johnson D. Reilly B.E. Anderson D. Bodley J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22365-22370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). pRNA binding to proheads is specific, rapid, and irreversible in the presence of 10 mm Mg2+. Proheads protect nucleotides 22–84, 5′ to 3′, of pRNA from ribonuclease attack, and the use of site-directed mutants of pRNA has identified elements and sequences of pRNA that are required for prohead binding and DNA-gp3 packaging (7Reid R.

The mutant studies also identified a pseudoknot involving a nine-membered bulge loop and a five-base hairpin loop in pRNA that is essential in DNA-gp3 packaging (9Reid R. Zhang F. Benson S. Anderson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18656-18661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the pseudoknot has been shown to be an intermolecular interaction, requiring just two base pairs, that links six identical molecules of pRNA into a structure that is positioned on the portal vertex of the prohead. 2F. Zhang, S. Lemieux, X. Wu, D. St-Arnaud, C. T. McMurray, F. Major, and D. Anderson, submitted for publication. The structure of pRNA as it interacts with the proteins of the packaging machine and DNA-gp3 is integral to understanding the mechanism of DNA packaging. To better define the sequence and structural elements of pRNA essential for prohead binding, a 62-base segment of the prohead binding domain (residues 30–91) was partially randomized, and pRNA aptamers, high affinity ligands that bind the prohead, were selected in vitro from a large pool of RNA molecules. Subsequently, 23 bases of this domain (residues 45–62 and 81–85) that include the intermolecular pseudoknot were completely randomized in a second in vitro selection analysis that was based on prohead binding and included assays of DNA-gp3 packaging. The results demonstrated more precisely the pRNA sequences and elements essential for prohead binding and DNA-gp3 packaging and identified the intermolecular base pairing required for pRNA oligomerization. In general, the selections recapitulated the natural evolution of pRNA. The in vitroselections of pRNA aptamers that bind the prohead were patterned after the method termed systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) (10Tuerk C. Gold L. Science. 1990; 249: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (8169) Google Scholar), which utilizes variation, selection, and replication. A vast repertoire of RNA molecules produced from a randomized template are bound to a target, selected molecules are amplified as DNA that is competent for in vitrotranscription, and the newly transcribed RNAs, enriched for better binding sequences, are subjected to selection to begin the next cycle. The DNA oligonucleotides used as templates in initial transcription for SELEX experiments I and II were purchased from Oligos Etc. Inc. In SELEX I, the randomized region of the template was based on positions 30–91 of the wild-type sequence (see Fig. 1, A and C) with a 16% mutation rate. The 110-nucleotide DNA template for the original RNA pool, with degenerate nucleotides in the 62-base prohead binding domain represented by N, was as follows: 5′-GGGCCCTTTG TCATGNNNNN NNNNNNNNNN NNNNNNNNNN NNNNNNNNNN NNNNNNNNNN NNNNNNNNNN NNNNNNNACA TGACAAAGGG CCC*TATAGTGAGTCGTATTA-3′ (the transcription start site is indicated with an asterisk, and the T7 promoter is underlined). Primer 1 (5′-GC*TCTAGATAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCCCTTTGTCATGT-3′ (the XbaI site is indicated with an asterisk, and the T7 promoter is underlined)) was used for making the double-stranded DNA template and for PCR amplification. Primer 2 (5′-AACTGCA*GGGCCCTTTGTCATG-3′ (the PstI site is indicated with an asterisk)) was used for reverse transcription and PCR amplification. The 120-nucleotide template for the original RNA pool of SELEX II in the complete randomization of pRNA residues A45 through G62 and U81–U85 (see Fig. 1, A and D), with randomized nucleotide positions represented by N, was as follows: 5′-TTAGGAAAGT AGCGTGCACT TTTGCCATGA TTGACNNNNN ATCAACAAAG TATGTGGGNN NNNNNNNNNN NNNNNNTAAT CCCCAACATA CACATGACAA TGGAAGTACC GTACCATTCC-3′. Primer 1 (5′-CCGG*AATTCTAATACGACTCACTATA*GGAATGGTACGGTACTT-3′ (the EcoRI site and the transcription start site are indicated with an asterisk, and the T7 promoter is underlined)) was used for making the double-stranded DNA template and for PCR amplification. Primer 2 (5′-CGCG*GATCC*TTAGGAAAGTAGCGTGC-3′ (theBamHI and DdeI sites are indicated with an asterisk)) was used for reverse transcription and PCR amplification. The 110-base single-stranded DNA template (SELEX I) and the 120-base single-stranded DNA template (SELEX II) were annealed to their respective primer-2 oligonucleotides and extended to form double-stranded DNA with five cycles of PCR. The double-stranded DNA templates in SELEX I and II were transcribed to produce original RNA pools with complexities of 2.5 × 1014 and 7 × 1013 molecules, respectively. T7 transcription was carried out as described (7Reid R. Bodley J.W. Anderson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5157-5162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a volume of 800 μl. T7 RNA polymerase was purchased from Ambion, Inc., and the reaction buffer was that of Life Technologies, Inc. pRNA-free proheads were produced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction of Escherichia coli strain HMS174(DE3) (pAR7-8-8.5-10) as described (7Reid R. Bodley J.W. Anderson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5157-5162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Reid R. Bodley J.W. Anderson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9084-9089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding affinity of proheads to pRNA was titrated by the use of 32P-labeled wild-type pRNA (8Reid R. Bodley J.W. Anderson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9084-9089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Reid R. Zhang F. Benson S. Anderson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18656-18661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ratio of molecules of RNA to proheads was 100. For each selection, 200 μg of proheads (approximately 1013) were used. Competitive binding was performed in 400 μl of TM (0.05 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 0.01 m MgCl2) buffer with 180 μg of yeast tRNA at room temperature for 30 min. RNA bound to proheads was separated from free RNA by centrifugation in a 5–20% sucrose gradient in the Beckman SW55 rotor at 35,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The prohead band was isolated, and 1 volume of H2O was added to dilute the sucrose. RNA was recovered by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation in the presence of 0.5 m NH4AC. cDNA was produced by SuperscriptTM RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and amplified by 30 cycles of PCR in four 100-μl reactions, and the DNA was transcribed to start another round of selection. For reverse transcription, the selected RNA was annealed to 1 μg of primer 2 by heating in water for 3 min at 100 °C and then cooling the sample in ice water. The reverse transcriptase was from Life Technologies, Inc., and reverse transcription was carried out in 40 μl as recommended by the manufacturer. PCR cycle conditions, adapted from Longel et al. (11Longel J. Dill D. Leonard S. Biotechniques. 1992; 13: 604-610PubMed Google Scholar), were as follows: 4 min at 94 °C for initial denaturation, 1 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 45 °C, 3 min at 72 °C, and a final 7 min at 72 °C. Wild-type pRNA was transcribed from plasmid PRT71 digested by DdeI as described (7Reid R. Bodley J.W. Anderson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5157-5162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Reid R. Bodley J.W. Anderson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9084-9089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNAs from different cycles were cloned into pUC19 at XbaI and PstI sites (SELEX I) or EcoRI and BamHI sites (SELEX II). The ability of RNA pools from each selection to compete with wild-type pRNA for prohead binding was used as a measure of relative binding affinity. The competition binding assay was carried out as described (8Reid R. Bodley J.W. Anderson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9084-9089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Reid R. Zhang F. Benson S. Anderson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18656-18661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.4 pmol of 120-residue wild-type [32P]pRNA was mixed with 14 pmol of an unlabeled RNA from each selection pool and 60 pmol of tRNA. 0.35 pmol of proheads were added to the RNA, and the fraction of [32P]pRNA bound was measured by filtration. A competitor activity for each RNA in the competition assay was derived by fitting values for the fraction of wild-type [32P]pRNA bound to the standard curve described by Bf=11+CEquation 1 and solving for C, where Bf is the fraction bound and C is the moles of competitor RNA per mole of [32P]pRNA. Values were normalized to the no competitor control (C = 0) and the wild-type pRNA competitor control (C = 100) to give Cn=B10(B0−Bt)Bt(B0−B10)×100Equation 2 where Cn compares the competitor activity of the test RNA to the wild-type pRNA, B10 is the fraction of [32P]pRNA bound when a 10-fold excess of wild-type pRNA is used as competitor, B0 is the fraction of [32P]pRNA bound with no competitor RNA, and Bt is the fraction of [32P]pRNA bound when a 10-fold excess of test competitor is added. DNA amplified from different cycles of selection was cloned into the PstI and XbaI sites of pUC19 and transformed into E. colistrain DH5α. Clones with inserts were identified by negative α complementation. The plasmids were sequenced with Sequenase 2.0 (United States Biochemical) using a protocol adapted from that provided by the manufacturer. In vitro DNA-gp3 packaging was carried out as described (8Reid R. Bodley J.W. Anderson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9084-9089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Wichitwechkarn J.

Briefly, wild-type or mutant pRNAs were bound to RNA-free proheads, and the reconstituted proheads were then added to DNA-gp3, gp16, and ATP. After 30 min at 25 °C, unpackaged DNA was digested with DNase I, EDTA was added, and packaged DNA was extracted from filled heads and quantified by agarose gel electrophoresis. Fig. 1 A shows the proposed secondary structure of the 120-base form of the 174-residue pRNA (6Bailey S. Wichitwechkarn J. Johnson D. Reilly B.E. Anderson D. Bodley J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22365-22370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that is necessary and sufficient for DNA-gp3 packaging in the definedin vitro system (2Guo P. Erickson S. Anderson D. Science. 1987; 236: 690-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 12Wichitwechkarn J. Bailey S. Bodley J.W. Anderson D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3459-3468Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The shaded region that marks nucleotides 22–84 is the footprint of proheads on pRNA generated with the ribonucleases A, T1, and V1 (7Reid R. Bodley J.W. Anderson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5157-5162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analyses utilizing oligonucleotide-directed mutant pRNAs show that both the sequence and the secondary structure of residues 40–91 are important for prohead binding and that elements of the A helix formed from residues 1–28 and 92–117 are needed for DNA packaging functions other than prohead binding (8Reid R. Bodley J.W. Anderson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9084-9089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Zhang C. Lee C.-S. Guo P. Virology. 1994; 201: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The secondary and tertiary structures of the prohead binding region of pRNA have been probed by measuring binding of mutant pRNAs to RNA-free proheads and in vitro packaging of DNA-gp3. A truncated pRNA of 62 residues (residues 30–91) retains prohead binding activity but is insufficient for DNA-gp3 packaging (9Reid R. Zhang F. Benson S. Anderson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18656-18661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A pseudoknot in pRNA inferred from the phylogenetic studies was confirmed by constructing mutants to change positions45AACC48 to GCGA (mutant F6),82GGUU85 to UCGC (mutant F7), or45AACC48 to GCGA and82GGUU85 to UCGC (mutant F6/F7) to restore the hypothetical base pairing of the G helix (9Reid R. Zhang F. Benson S. Anderson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18656-18661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). Neither F6 nor F7 pRNAs could reconstitute proheads for in vitro DNA-gp3 packaging, whereas the F6/F7 double mutant pRNA was as effective as wild-type pRNA in reconstituting proheads for DNA packaging. Moreover, proheads reconstituted with either F6 or F7 pRNA could not promote in vitro phage assembly in a prohead-defective extract, whereas the F6/F7 pRNA was as effective as wild-type pRNA in reconstituting proheads for phage assembly. Recently, a mixture of F6 and F7 pRNAs was found to be as active in DNA-gp3 packaging as the double mutant F6/F7 and wild-type pRNA, showing that the pseudoknot is intermolecular rather than intramolecular. This intermolecular base pairing results in the formation of an oligomer from six identical molecules of pRNA that is essential for efficient DNA-gp3 packaging.2 To define the specific nucleotides of pRNA needed for prohead binding and formation of the intermolecular pseudoknot, segments of pRNA were partially or completely randomized, and RNA aptamers for prohead binding were obtained by multiple rounds of in vitro selection. The 62-base prohead binding domain (residues 30–91) shown as the shaded region in the template of Fig. 1 Cwas partially randomized with a mutation rate of 16% as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The DNA template utilized the T7 promoter, and an initial pool of RNA molecules with a complexity of 5 × 1014 molecules was produced. RNA pools were obtained from seven rounds of in vitro selection by prohead binding and separated from unbound RNA by isolation of the prohead-pRNA complexes in sucrose density gradients. cDNA was produced, amplified by PCR, cloned, and sequenced. The ability of pools of RNA from the various rounds of in vitro selection to compete with the binding of [32P]wild-type pRNA to proheads is shown in Fig. 2. From the fifth round, RNA pools were equivalent to wild-type pRNA as competitors of prohead binding. tRNA was used as a negative control for competition. RNAs sequenced from the second and third rounds of selection showed changes at practically every position of the prohead binding domain (not shown). On the contrary, in the fifth round, changes in residues 46–48 of the C-E loop and 81–84 of the D loop, which are involved in intermolecular base pairings that produce dimers and hexamers of pRNA,2were infrequent in 93 sequences, and most of the residues of the E stem and residues 53–56 of the E loop were wild-type (Fig. 3 and Table I). Covariation was detected within individual sequences in six of nine base pairs of the C helix and all six base pairs of the D helix (Fig. 3), lending strong support to the model of pRNA secondary structure (6Bailey S.

Bodley J.W. Anderson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9084-9089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 62-base pRNA is not active in DNA-gp3 packaging, and therefore, this study was limited to prohead binding. A second SELEX experiment focused on the sequences and elements of pRNA crucial for prohead binding and produced the entire 120-base pRNA needed for DNA-gp3 packaging assays. Twenty-three bases (residues 45–62 and 81–85) (Fig. 1 D) were completely randomized to yield an initial RNA pool with an expected complexity of 7 × 1013 molecules. RNA was selected by multiple rounds of binding to proheads. cDNA was produced, amplified by PCR, cloned, and sequenced. From the fifth round, RNA pools were equivalent to wild-type pRNA as competitors of prohead binding (Fig. 4). A sequencing gel of pRNA pools from the initial through the fifth round of selection is shown in Fig. 5. The progression from a population of random sequences to a population dominated by the wild-type is dramatic. From cycle three, only 2 of 18 clones were wild-type. From cycle four, 74 of 90 clones (82%) were wild-type, and from cycle 5, 190 of 226 clones (84%) were wild-type. Representative mutant sequences of the randomized regions from cycles 4 and 5 are given in Tables II and III, respectively.Figure 5Sequencing gel of pools of RNA from the initial selection through the fifth cycle of SELEX II.

On the contrary, changes occurred in residues 81–85 in all but three of the mutant pRNAs. The base 45–62 interval includes the C-E bulge loop and the E stem and loop. Bases 81–85 make up the D loop, residues of which form base pairs intermolecularly with the C-E loop in pRNA oligomerization (addressed below). Substantial change in the D loop shows that prohead binding per se does not require pseudoknot formation, i.e. pseudoknot formation may follow prohead binding. Moreover, mutant pRNA F6, which cannot form the pseudoknot, still has 20% prohead binding competitor activity relative to wild-type pRNA (9Reid R. Zhang F. Benson S. Anderson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18656-18661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results suggest that the intermolecular pseudoknot is not important for the initial interaction of pRNA with the prohead but is important for subsequent interactions critical to DNA-gp3 packaging activity. The nine sequences of residues 45–62 that were not wild-type showed abundant change (Tables II and III). Eight of these sequences showed covariation in base pairs of the E helix, suggesting that maintenance of this element is important in prohead binding. In the mutant pRNAs 4-1 (Table II) and 5-1, 5-14, and 5-15 (Table III), covariation occurred in two of four base pairs of the E stem, and in the mutant 4-10 (Table II), covariation occurred in all four bases of the E stem. Folding of pRNA mutant sequences was predicted by the computer algorithm MFOLD (14Zuker M. Science. 1989; 244: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). Minor, even single, base changes in the pRNA sequence can produce drastic alterations in the predicted foldings (15Wichitwechkarn J. Johnson D. Anderson D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 991-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Studies on pRNA mutants with limited numbers of G to A or C to U changes generated by bisulfite mutagenesis showed that the foldings of pRNA have prognostic value. In each case in which the overall predicted folding of a mutant differed substantially from the wild-type model, production of RNA was not detected in vivo from the cloned genes, presumably because of degradation of misfolded molecules by endogenous ribonucleases. All 22 of the pRNA sequences of Tables II andIII that are wild-type for residues 45–62 were predicted to fold as the model did (Fig. 1 A), regardless of the D loop sequence. This suggests that all major determinants of secondary structure are in place in these mutants, and even changing all five bases of the D loop did not perturb the predicted folding. However, only 6 of these 22 mutant pRNAs were active in DNA-gp3 packaging, in all cases because the residues 82GG83 were retained in the D loop, providing the capability to form the intermolecular base pairs needed for oligomerization (see below). None of the pRNAs with changes in the segment that included residues 45–62 could reconstitute RNA-free proheads for DNA-gp3 packaging in vitro. The SELEX experiments defined the minimal requirements for intermolecular base pairing leading to formation of pRNA dimers and hexamers required for DNA-gp3 packaging.2 Previous work suggested that the pseudoknot was a four-base pair interaction involving nucleotides 45–48 and 85–82 (9Reid R. Zhang F. Benson S. Anderson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18656-18661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1, A and B). Full DNA-gp3 packaging activity was obtained with the mutants 4-2, 4-5, 4-6, 5-6, 5-8, and 5-12, in which bases were changed from U85 to C; U85 to G;84UU85 to CA; U85 to C; U81 to A; and 84UU85 to GA, respectively (Tables II and III); thus, potential base pairing involving U residues at positions 84 and 85 was not needed for biological activity. The DNA-gp3 packaging results from SELEX II are shown in Fig. 6. All of the biologically active pRNAs maintained G at positions 82 and 83. A change of G82 to C in mutants 4-3, 5-9 and 5-11; to A in mutants 4-8 and 4-11; and to U in mutants 5-10 and 5-18 while maintaining G at position 83 resulted in loss of DNA-gp3 packaging activity. Similarly, a change of G83 to U in mutants 4-9 and 5-5 while G82 was maintained resulted in loss of DNA-gp3 packaging activity. As expected, when both G82 and G83were changed to CC in mutants 4-4, 5-4, 5-7, and 5-16; UU in mutants 4-7, 5-2, and 5-19; AU in mutant 5-1; CA in mutants 5-3 and 5-13; AA in mutant 5-15; and AC in mutants 4-1 and 5-20, DNA-gp3 packaging was not observed. These results showed that base pairing between47CC48 and 83GG82 is necessary and sufficient for DNA-gp3 packaging. Data showing that this intermolecular interaction produces a hexameric oligomer of pRNA will be presented.2 Site-directed mutagenesis of these residues has confirmed the results presented here and demonstrated that pRNAs with a change of the wild-type bases47CC48–83GG82 to GC–CG, CG–GC, CU–GA, UC–AG, or GA–CU retain efficient DNA-gp3 packaging activity.2 Mg2+ is needed for formation of dimers and hexamers of pRNA in solution. Dimers of pRNA have been detected by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at room temperature, and dimers and hexamers were detected at 4 °C; proof of the dimeric and hexameric forms of pRNA in solution was obtained by analytical ultracentrifugation.2 The SELEX experiments recapitulated the natural evolution of the C-E bulge loop and the E stem and loop of pRNA. No alternatives to wild-type pRNA in terms of the sequence and secondary structure of these elements were identified by the SELEX experiments. The only analogues of wild-type pRNA with apparently identical structure and function in DNA-gp3 packaging were the mutants 4-2 (5-6), 4-5, 4-6, 5-8, and 5-12, which had D loop changes of U85 to C, U85 to G,84UU85 to CA, U81 to A, and84UU85 to GA, respectively (Tables II and III); all of these RNAs maintain 83GG82, which forms intermolecular base pairs with 47CC48 of the C-E bulge loop that are needed for DNA-gp3 packaging.2Thus, the D loop functions primarily in intermolecular base pairing of pRNA rather than prohead binding; however, deletion of both the D stem and loop results in loss of prohead binding competitor activity (8Reid R. Bodley J.W. Anderson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9084-9089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)."

Tuberculosis is the world's leading cause of death in humans from a single infectious agent (1Najima H. The World Health Organization Report. World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland1996: 27-29Google Scholar). The World Health Organization estimates that Mycobacterium tuberculosis currently afflicts one-third of the world population and will kill 30 million people in this decade (1Najima H. The World Health Organization Report. World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland1996: 27-29Google Scholar). In addition, Mycobacterium leprae afflicts 10 to 12 million people worldwide (1Najima H. The World Health Organization Report. World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland1996: 27-29Google Scholar). The alarming resurgence of tuberculosis in the United States (2Bloom B.R. Murray C.G.L.

The World Health Organization Report. World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland1996: 27-29Google Scholar). The bacterial resistance to the frontline antituberculosis drugs, including isoniazid, makes it absolutely critical to find new drugs targeted at other unique processes in the Mycobacteria. The biosynthesis of the unique components of the mycobacterial cell wall might offer such targets. The Gram-positive hydrophobic mycobacterial cell walls contain up to 60% lipids. The mycobacteria are known to produce unique lipids that make their cell walls an effective barrier to antimicrobial drugs and to the host's natural defense mechanisms and help in their multiplication within the host. Among such unique lipids are the unusually long chain mycolic acids, the very long chain fatty acids that are constituents of the glycopeptidolipids and the methyl-branched fatty acids (4Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1563) Google Scholar, 5Minnikin D.E. Ratledge C. Stanford J. The Biology of the Mycobacteria, Physiology, Identification, and Classification. 1.44. Academic Press, New York1982: 95-184Google Scholar). Common among the methyl-branched acids are tuberculostearic acid (C18 fatty acid) that is found esterified in phosphatidylinositide mannosides, 2,4-dimethyl-C14 acid and mono-, di-, and trimethyl-branched C14-C25 fatty acids found in lipooligosaccharides. Dimethyl-branched fatty acids are found esterified in 2,3-di-O-acyltrehaloses (6Besra G.S. Bolton R.C. McNeil M.R. Ridell M. Simpson K.E. Glushka J. van Halbeek H. Brennan P.J. Minnikin D.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9832-9837Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The shorter C22-C26 mycocerosic acids are found esterified to phthiocerol. The tetramethyl-branched C28-C32 mycocerosic acids are found in phenolic glycolipids and esterified to phthiocerol and phenolphthiocerol as well. Finally, the hexa- and heptamethyl-branched phthioceranic and hydroxyphthioceranic acids are also found esterified at various positions to trehalose-2-sulfate to form the sulfolipids that are a characteristic component of the virulent strains of M. tuberculosis. The enzymology of the biosynthesis of these branched fatty acids remains to be elucidated with one exception. A multifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of long chain mycocerosic acids has been purified (7Rainwater D.L. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 616-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the gene that encodes this enzyme has been cloned (8Mathur M.M. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19388-19395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and disrupted (9Azad A.K. Sirakova T.D. Rogers L.M. Kolattukudy P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4787-4792Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Although the gene-disrupted mutant could not synthesize mycocerosic acids, it produced phthiocerol esters that contained shorter C22 to C26 mycocerosic acids esterified to phthiocerol. Obviously these acids must be produced by an enzyme other than MAS. 1Tha abbreviations used are: MAS, mycocerosic acid synthase; SMAS, short chain mycocerosic acid synthase; FAS, fatty acid synthase; CAPS, cyclohexylaminopropane sulfonic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Ab, antibody. In this paper, we describe the discovery, purification, and characterization of the enzyme which synthesizes the shorter mycocerosic acids from methylmalonyl-CoA and C12 to C20 acyl-CoA primers. We have named this enzyme short chain mycocerosic acid synthase (SMAS). TICE BCG vaccine of M. tuberculosis var. bovis BCG was purchased from Organon Teknika-Cappel. The cultures were grown at 37 °C for 8–10 days as described previously (7Rainwater D.L. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 616-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). mas-mutant (9Azad A.K. Sirakova T.D. Rogers L.M. Kolattukudy P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4787-4792Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) was grown in Middlebrook 7H9 medium (Difco) supplemented with ADC (Difco) and 0.05% Tween 80 at 37 °C for 10–12 days in 850-cm plastic roller bottles at 3 rpm in a Roll-in rolling incubator (Bellco Glass). M. tuberculosis BCG cells from 8–10-day-old cultures (30 gm wet cells) were harvested by centrifugation, and suspended in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm dithioerythritol, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm EDTA (3.0 ml/g of cells) at 4 °C. All subsequent steps in the purification of SMAS were carried out at 4 °C. The cells were disrupted by four passages at 15,000 p.s.i. through a French press (Aminco). The first three passages were immediately preceded by the addition of 1/200 volume of a 0.1m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) solution in isopropyl alcohol. The homogenate was first centrifuged at 37,000 × g for 30 min and the supernatant was then centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 90 min. The final supernatant was used as the cell-free extract. This solution (600 mg of protein) was loaded onto a DEAE-cellulose (Whatman DE52) column (1.8 × 30 cm) equilibrated with the previously described 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer containing 1 mm dithioerythritol, pH 7.0. After washing the column with 1 bed volume of the above buffer, a linear gradient of 0.1–0.5 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, was applied. Aliquots of the 7.8-ml fractions were assayed for incorporation of [2-14C]methylmalonyl-CoA into lipids using NADH, NADPH, and C20-CoA as the primer. Fractions containing high methylmalonyl-CoA incorporating activity were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration using PM-30 membrane (Amicon). This protein solution (4 mg) was dialyzed against 0.1 mpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1 mmdithioerythritol and loaded onto a 6-ml red-agarose (Sigma) column equilibrated with the same phosphate buffer. The unbound protein was removed by washing the column with 1 bed volume of the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted by a linear 0.1–0.5 m KCl gradient in the 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer containing 1 mm dithioerythritol. Aliquots (150 μl) of the 2-ml fractions collected were assayed for methylmalonyl-CoA incorporating activity. Alternatively, the enzyme solution from the DEAE step was loaded onto an Immunopure-protein A immunoglobulin G (IgG) orientation column (Pierce). The column was prepared following the manufacturer's guidelines (Pierce) using 8 mg of total protein of the antisera raised against either the 280-kDa protein or the 100-kDa protein from purified SMAS; 4 mg of protein was loaded onto the column. Protein was eluted using the eluant supplied by the manufacturer following the manufacturer's protocol. Following separation by SDS-PAGE, the gel segments containing the 100- and 280-kDa proteins were excised, and each was individually injected subcutaneously into New Zealand White male rabbits with Freund's complete adjuvant as described before (10Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 103-117Google Scholar). Three booster injections were administered at 2-week intervals. Blood was collected by heart puncture 4 days after the final injection. The serum was recovered after clot formation. SDS-PAGE was done with a 3% stacking gel and a 5% running gel as described previously (11Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Following SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transblotted onto an Immobilon polyvinylidine difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) in 10 mm CAPS buffer, pH 11, and 10% methanol. Subsequent to treatment with 1:250 diluted antisera, the antibody complex was detected by autoradiography using 125I-protein A as the secondary detection agent (12Burnette W.H. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5916) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture in a total volume of 500 μl, contained 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 1 mm NADH, 1 mm NADPH, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm acyl-CoA primer, and 25 μm[methyl-14C]methylmalonyl-CoA (56 Ci/mol). For standard assays 0.2 mg of protein was used. Following a 60-min incubation at 37 °C the reaction was stopped by the addition of 250 μl of 10% NaOH and the mixture was heated in a boiling water bath for 10 min; after acidification, the lipids were extracted with chloroform:methanol (2:1). This lipid material was subjected to thin-layer chromatography, with authentic C18 acid as external standard, on Silica Gel G plates using hexane:diethyl ether:formic acid (35:15:1, v/v) as the solvent. After spraying the plates with a 0.1% ethanolic solution of 2,7-dichlorofluorescein, the positions of the UV visible spots were recorded. The plates were scanned for distribution of radioactivity using a Berthold Tracemaster 20 automatic TLC Linear analyzer. Silica gel from the region corresponding to free fatty acids was scraped from the plate into a counting vial, mixed with ScintiverseTM scintillation fluid (Fisher Scientific) and assayed for radioactivity in a Beckman LS3801 Liquid Scintillation System. The enzyme activity is expressed as total picomoles of methylmalonyl-CoA incorporated into free fatty acids/mg of protein. To determine if the product generated from methylmalonyl-CoA was free or esterified, after incubation of a standard reaction mixture it was acidified and chloroform-extractable products were removed and analyzed on a TLC plate as indicated above. To determine if any of the product was protein-bound, the aqueous phase that remained after the solvent extraction was boiled for 30 min with 20% NaOH, acidified with 6m HCl, and the products were extracted with chloroform as indicated above and assayed for 14C. To determine the chain length of the products generated from methylmalonyl-CoA incorporation, the chloroform-extractable material was subjected to TLC as described before and the fatty acids recovered were refluxed with 14% BF3 in methanol for 3 h at 57 °C. The methyl esters recovered by extraction with chloroform were purified by TLC on Silica Gel G using hexane:diethyl ether:formic acid (35:15:1) as the solvent. Radio-gas liquid chromatography of the methyl esters was performed with a coiled stainless steel column (0.3 × 300 cm) packed with 5% OV-1 (w/w) on Chrom W-HP 80/100 in a Varian 3300 Gas Chromatograph with a 50–300 °C temperature program at 20 °C/min. The effluent from the column was run through a LabLogic GC-RAM detector using Winflow (IN/US Systems) software. A Statistical Deconvolution Algorithm (LabLogic) was used for statistical image enhancement. Chain lengths were determined by comparing retention times of the synthesized products to those of straight chain fatty acid standards. Gel filtration was carried out on a Sepharose 6B-CL (Pharmacia) (1.5 × 100 cm) column calibrated with goose fatty acid synthase (13Buckner J.S. Kolattukudy P.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 1948-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), alcohol dehydrogenase (Sigma), bovine serum albumin (Sigma), carbonic anhydrase (Sigma), and cytochrome c (Sigma). The molecular weight of SMAS was calculated from a rectilinear plot of relative mobilityversus molecular weight. Themas-disrupted mutant incorporated labeled propionic acid into C22-C26 mycocerosic acids that are shorter than the C28-C32 mycocerosic acids (9Azad A.K. Sirakova T.D. Rogers L.M. Kolattukudy P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4787-4792Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To seek the enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of such short mycocerosic acids, cell-free extracts of wild type and mas-disrupted mutant were subjected to DEAE anion exchange chromatography. When the protein fractions were assayed with [methyl-14C]methylmalonyl-CoA and C20-CoA ester as a primer, two major methylmalonyl-CoA incorporating activities were found in the wild type, whereas only one was found in the mas-disrupted mutant (Fig. 1). Fractions 57–67 in the wild type were found to contain MAS. A SDS-PAGE gel and an immunoblot of that gel using antibodies raised against MAS (7Rainwater D.L. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 616-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) confirmed that MAS was present in fractions 57–67 in the wild type. There was no MAS in the mas-mutant as expected. Radio-gas liquid chromatographic analysis of products generated by fractions 33–41 from methylmalonyl-CoA showed that it produces the C23-C26 methyl-branched fatty acids (Fig. 2), the same major acids produced by the mas-disrupted mutant (9Azad A.K. Sirakova T.D. Rogers L.M. Kolattukudy P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4787-4792Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus this protein fractions contain SMAS. The 105,000 × gsupernatant prepared from cells of Mycobacterium bovis BCG was fractionated on DEAE-cellulose columns. Products synthesized by fractions 33–41 in a methylmalonyl-CoA incorporation assay with C20-CoA primer firmly established that SMAS was contained in fractions 33–41 obtained from both wild type and mas-mutant. The DEAE-cellulose fractionation of the high speed supernatant resulted in a 11-fold purification with complete recovery of SMAS enzymatic activity (Table I). The pooled fractions containing SMAS were concentrated and subjected to red-agarose chromatography. All of the methylmalonyl-CoA incorporating activity was retained in the column and upon the application of a linear 0.1–0.5 m KCl the SMAS activity was eluted as a single peak at 0.2 m KCl. The red-agarose purification step resulted in a 58-fold purification of SMAS (Table I). This purified enzyme was found to be stable to freezing in phosphate buffer containing 10% glycerol, and could be stored with little loss in activity at −70 °C for at least 3 months. The purified enzyme preparation when subjected to SDS-PAGE revealed three Coomassie staining bands at 280, 170, and 100 kDa, respectively (Fig. 3 A). To test whether the multiple bands represented subunits or impurities an immunological approach was used. Rabbit antibodies were raised to the 100-kDa protein band (Ab100) and the 280-kDa protein band (Ab280). Both antibodies were individually tested in an immunoaffinity absorption procedure to purify the SMAS from DEAE-cellulose purified enzyme preparation from the wild type cells. Ab280 antibody and Ab100 antibody conjugated to two separate protein A-immobilized matrices were used. The enzyme activity was retained by both antibodies. Elution of the enzyme from the affinity matrices at low pH recovered the methylmalonyl-CoA incorporating activity. However, the eluted protein had low enzyme activity. The loss in enzyme activity resulting from the low pH could be prevented by neutralization of the eluant immediately after it emerged from the column. SDS-PAGE analysis of the preparation that resulted from the elution of this activity gave three bands. Using this procedure SMAS was found to be purified 60-fold, about the same purification achieved by red-agarose (Table I).Table IPurification of short chain mycocerosic acid synthase from M. tuberculosis var. bovis BCGStepProteinSpecific activityPurificationmgpmol/mg/h-foldExtract18130.721DEAE chromatography1448.511Red-agarose chromatography84258Immunoaffinity chromatography842.560 Open table in a new tab A native molecular mass of 537 kDa was estimated by gel filtration chromatography through a calibrated Sepharose CL-6B column. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed the presence of three bands at 280, 170, and 100 kDa. Therefore it is possible that the native enzyme is a complex composed of these three subunits. The other alternative is that it is a dimer of two 280-kDa monomers and a proteolytic nick was introduced into the monomer during purification. Ab280 antibodies cross-reacted with all three bands (Fig. 3 B) and inhibited the ability of SMAS to incorporate methylmalonyl-CoA into fatty acids in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4). Ab100 antibody cross-reacted with all the three bands. However, repeated washings necessary to completely eliminate any background also resulted in the loss of the 280-kDa band that cross-reacted with Ab100 prior to such thorough washing (Fig. 3 C). Ab100 also inhibited the ability of the synthase to incorporate methylmalonyl-CoA into fatty acids in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4). Antibodies raised against MAS did not inhibit SMAS (Fig. 4). Furthermore, under stringent conditions, the anti-MAS and anti-FAS antibodies failed to cross-react with SMAS on an immunoblot (data not shown). Neither Ab280 nor Ab100 antibody cross-reacted with MAS-containing fractions in an immunoblot. These results clearly show that the SMAS is not immunologically very similar to MAS or FAS. To test whether the 170- and 100-kDa bands resulted from a proteolytic nick of the 280-kDa protein during the cell breakage and purification procedures, freshly harvested cells were boiled in SDS-PAGE buffer and the proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE. An immunoblot showed that all three bands at 280, 170, and 100 kDa cross-reacted with Ab280 antibody (Fig. 3 D). Either NADH or NADPH was found to be sufficient for SMAS activity. The presence of both NADH and NADPH did not enhance the level of incorporation of methylmalonyl-CoA into fatty acids (Table II). NADH alone was slightly more effective than NADPH (Table II). The effect of cofactor concentration on the incorporation of methylmalonyl-CoA into fatty acids by SMAS showed typical Michaelis-Menten saturation patterns for both NADH and NADPH and from double reciprocal plots (Fig. 5) the apparent Kmvalues of 93 and 90 μm were calculated for NADH and NADPH, respectively. Addition of acyl carrier protein did not significantly change the incorporation of methylmalonyl-CoA into fatty acids by SMAS (Table II).Table IIEffect of NADH, NADPH, and acyl cattier protein on the incorporation of methylmalonyl-CoA into fatty acids by SMASAdditionspmol/mg/hNo reductant18NADH, NADPH121NADH148NADPH120ACP115 Open table in a new tab The primer that we routinely used in the assays for SMAS activity was C20-CoA. This primer generated C23 and C26 mycocerosic acids. The ability of SMAS to utilize primers whose chain length varied from C12-CoA to C20-CoA is shown in Table III. SMAS could utilize CoA esters of n-C12, n-C16, n-C18, and n-C20 fatty acids. C16-CoA ester was better than either C12-CoA or C18-CoA and C20-CoA was better than C16-CoA as primer.Table IIIEffect of primer chain length on the incorporation of methylmalonyl-CoA into fatty acids by SMASPrimerPmol/mg/hC12-CoA78C16-CoA100C18-CoA88C20-CoA119 Open table in a new tab To determine if SMAS releases free fatty acids, the enzymatic reaction products were acidified and partitioned into aqueous (acyl protein) and organic (free fatty acid) phases. About 60% of the labeled product was found in the organic phase. When the products from the organic phase were subjected to TLC, all of the radioactivity in the products was found in the fraction that had an RF identical to that of authentic C18 free fatty acid. Hydrolysis of the aqueous phase released the other 40% of the lipid products as free fatty acids. Radio-gas liquid chromatography of the methyl esters of the methyl-branched fatty acids generated from C20-CoA as the primer, revealed that this enzyme could utilize methylmalonyl-CoA to generate products of chain lengths up to C26 (Fig. 2). Using C16-CoA as the primer, SMAS was again able to synthesize products of chain lengths up to C26. No longer chain length products (mycocerosic acids) could be synthesized. Fatty acid synthases from bacteria such as Escherichia coli are made up of distinct enzymes each of which catalyzes an individual step in the series of reactions involved in fatty acid synthesis (14Alberts A.W. Greenspan M.D. Numa S. Fatty Acid Metabolism and Its Regulation. Elsevier, Amsterdam1984: 29-58Google Scholar, 15Wakil S.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4523-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Other organisms use multifuctional proteins to catalyze these reactions. Two such multifunctional fatty acid synthesizing enzymes have been found in the mycobacteria. One, fatty acid synthase, utilizes malonyl-CoA to catalyze the synthesis of n-fatty acids (16Peterson D.O. Bloch K. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5735-5739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kikuchi S. Rainwater D.L. Kolattukudy P.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 295: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The other, mycocerosic acid synthase, utilizes methylmalonyl-CoA to elongate n-fatty acids to generate the multimethyl-branched C28-C32 mycocerosic acids (7Rainwater D.L. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 616-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Disruption of the gene that encodes MAS, and the biochemical analysis of the products generated by that mutant, revealed that although the mutant was unable to produce long mycocerosic acids, it was still able to produce other shorter chain C22 to C26 mycocerosic acids (9Azad A.K. Sirakova T.D. Rogers L.M. Kolattukudy P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4787-4792Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Obviously, there must be other enzyme(s) that utilize methylmalonyl-CoA to generate such shorter mycocerosic acids in M. bovis BCG. The discovery, purification, and characterization of such a multifunctional fatty acid synthase described in this paper reveals that although this enzyme shares some properties, as described in the next paragraph, with the other two mycobacterial fatty acid synthesizing enzymes already studied (MAS and FAS), it has its own unique biochemical features. SMAS appears to be a dimer made up of two 280-kDa monomers. Antibodies prepared against either the 280-kDa protein or the 100-kDa protein inhibited the incorporation of methylmalonyl-CoA into fatty acids in a dose-dependent manner. Immunoblots using either antibody preparation show the same pattern of three cross-reacting bands at 280, 170, and 100 kDa. It seems likely that a nick in the 280-kDa protein gave rise to the 170- and 100-kDa bands. However, boiling of freshly harvested cells with SDS buffer yielded the same three immunologically cross-reacting bands. These results suggest either that the monomer has unusual susceptibility to proteolytic nick, or, that this multifunctional fatty acid synthesizing enzyme has a unique subunit composition of a 280-, 170-, and a 100-kDa monomer. If so, one set of catalytic domains is present in the 280-kDa protein and another set is distributed between the 170- and 100-kDa proteins, thus with a total of two sets per mole of native enzyme. If the enzyme is composed of two 280-kDa protein monomers, each monomer probably has all of the domains needed for fatty acid synthesis. Thus the overall structure would be like that of a multifunctional dimer as in MAS and FAS. We have already demonstrated that SMAS can utilize either of the two reductants NADH or NADPH for activity. MAS on the other hand can only utilize NADPH (7Rainwater D.L. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 616-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the reductase domain is distinct from that found in MAS. While the FAS from mycobacteria releases the products as CoA esters and the product appears to be enzyme-bound in the case of MAS, 60% of the SMAS products are released as free fatty acids; it presumably contains a thioesterase domain. While FAS has no thioesterase domain (20Fernandes N.D. Kolattukudy P.E. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 170: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the acyltransferase domain probably transfers the product to CoA esters. MAS has no thioesterase and the product is enzyme bound. Under standard conditions, SMAS is capable of elongating all four of the acyl-CoA primers tested. FAS is not able to utilize C12 or C14. It is possible that the chain length and structure of the products generated in vivo could depend on the availability of the primers. SMAS could therefore be responsible for the synthesis of the shorter mycocerosic acids found esterified to phthiocerol. SMAS could also be responsible for the synthesis of the multimethyl-branched fatty acids, such as the dimethyl-branched fatty acids found esterified in diacyl trehalose (6Besra G.S. Bolton R.C. McNeil M.R. Ridell M. Simpson K.E. Glushka J. van Halbeek H. Brennan P.J. Minnikin D.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9832-9837Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and the mycosanoic acids (18Rafidinamrivo E. Savagnac A. LaCave C. Prome J.-C. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 711: 266-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 19Hunter S.W. Murphy R.C. Clay K. Goren M.B. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10481-10487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found in the mycobacteria since they can all be synthesized by elongation of n-fatty acids with methylmalonyl-CoA. Structural and biochemical relationships among the various types of enzymes that produce the variety of fatty acids in the mycobacteria have recently started to be elucidated (20Fernandes N.D. Kolattukudy P.E. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 170: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 21Kolattukudy P.E. Fernandes N.D. Azad A.K. Fitzmaurice A.M. Sirakova T.D. Mol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 16741-16745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The amino acid composition showed a similarity between the FAS from M. bovis BCG and Mycobacterium smegmatis and MAS from the former. The gene structure on the other hand revealed the divergence between the FAS and MAS from M. bovis BCG. SMAS appears to be immunologically distinct from any of the mycobacterial enzymes studied thus far. Antibodies raised to FAS (17Kikuchi S. Rainwater D.L. Kolattukudy P.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 295: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and MAS (7Rainwater D.L. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 616-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) failed to cross-react with SMAS. Gene cloning and sequencing are in progress to determine the structure/domain organization of the SMAS. Obviously, the enzyme must catalyze transacylation steps, condensation, ketoreduction, dehydration, and enoyl reduction. It would be interesting to see whether the gene structure/domain organization resembles the traditional structure seen in FAS (20Fernandes N.D. Kolattukudy P.E. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 170: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) or MAS (8Mathur M.M. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19388-19395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From the fact that SMAS releases its products as free fatty acids, it would appear that the structure would have at least one difference from MAS in that it should possess a thioesterase domain. We have recently discovered that the AT and KS domains of MAS are selective for methylmalonyl-CoA (23Fernandes N.D. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7538-7543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SMAS does not use malonyl-CoA as a substrate and incorporation of methylmalonyl-CoA into short chain mycocerosic acids by SMAS is not inhibited by malonyl-CoA. Since SMAS utilizes methylmalonyl-CoA specifically, the AT and KS domains of this enzyme are likely to be especially homologous to the corresponding domains in MAS. There has been some question as to whether the pathogenic mycobacteria depend on the host as the main source of fatty acids (24Wheeler P.R. Bulmer K. Ratledge C. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). If they do then it is easy to envision the SMAS elongating the range of fatty acids present in the host to generate some of the methyl-branched fatty acids required for the synthesis of complex wall lipids. The discovery thus far of four unique fatty acid synthesizing and elongating enzymes: MAS, FAS, SMAS, and a fourth methylmalonyl-CoA incorporating activity, 2N. D. Fernandes, A. K. Azad, and P. E. Kolattukudy, unpublished data. from M. bovis BCG demonstrates that the synthesis of the wide array of complex lipids is based on a strategy that includes multiple fatty acid synthesizing enzymes. Each class of methyl-branched fatty acids is synthesized by an enzyme dedicated for that purpose. Since the different classes of the methyl-branched fatty acids are channeled to different acyl lipids, the synthesis of the acids may be coupled to esterification to the final acyl acceptor. The use of multiple synthases probably provides the biochemical capability to achieve such channeling. Since the present enzyme is only the second methyl-branched fatty acid synthase to be purified, fuller understanding of the strategies involved must await the elucidation of the nature of the synthases that catalyze the production of the other classes of methyl-branched fatty acids in the mycobacteria."

Previous functional and structural studies have indicated that the well defined HLH domain is both necessary and sufficient for dimerization. Most of these studies, however, have employed in vitrosystems for analysis of HLH dimerization, and their implications for the requirements for in vivo dimerization remain unclear. Using multiple approaches, we have analyzed bHLH dimerization in intact, living cells and have identified a novel domain in E proteins, domain C, which is required for in vivo dimerization. Domain C, which lies just carboxyl-terminal to helix 2 of the HLH domain, represents the most highly conserved region within E proteins and appears to influence the in vivo conformation of the adjacent HLH domain. These results suggest that HLH dimerizationin vivo may represent a complex, regulated process that is distinct from HLH dimerization in vitro.

These results suggest that HLH dimerizationin vivo may represent a complex, regulated process that is distinct from HLH dimerization in vitro. For several classes of transcription factors, such as members of the basic helix-loop-helix, leucine zipper, and nuclear receptor families, dimerization represents a key, obligatory step prior to DNA binding and transcriptional activation. This dimerization permits the mixing and matching of factors with different DNA half-site binding specificities and expands the repetoire of potential target sequences that may be recognized. Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) 1The abbreviations used are: HLH, helix-loop-helix; LacZ, β-galactosidase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CMV, cytomegalovirus; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MBP, maltose-binding protein. factors in metazoan organisms often regulate the expression of target genes as heterodimeric complexes between tissue-specific factors, such as SCL/tal or MyoD, and broadly expressed E proteins (1Lassar A.B.

Cell. 1993; 75: 827-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The composition of bHLH complexes is dictated in part by the dimerization specificities of the constituents; in particular, tissue-specific bHLH factors tend not to interact with one another but rather to bind universally to E protein partners (4Hsu H.-L. Wadman I. Baer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3181-3185Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 5Goldfarb A.N. Lewandowska K. Blood. 1995; 85: 465-471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, the dominant negative HLH proteins of the Id family exert their inhibitory effect through preferential binding to E proteins (6Sun X.-H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5603-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 7Jen Y. Weintraub H. Benezra R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1466-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 8Hara E. Hall M. Peters G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 332-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Thus a progenitor cell during embryogenesis may contain an array of different cell lineage-specific bHLH factors all competing with one another, as well as with inhibitory HLH proteins, for dimerization with a common E protein partner. Such competition would allow the progenitor cell to make mutually exclusive, binary decisions with regard to lineage commitment, proliferation, and terminal differentiation (2Weintraub H. Davis R. Tapscott S. Thayer M. Krause M. Benezra R. Blackwell T.K. Turner D. Rupp R. Hollenberg S. Zhuang Y. Lassar A. Science. 1991; 251: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). The structural basis for bHLH dimerization, according to x-ray crystallography, resides in the formation of a parallel, four-helix bundle in which dimerization contacts derive from conserved hydrophobic residues clustered within a shielded core (9D'Amare-Ferre A.R. Prendergast G.C. Ziff E.B. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 363: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 10Ellenberger T. Fass D. Arnaud M. Harrison S.C.

Cell. 1994; 77: 451-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). However, the crystallographic structures have all been obtained with pre-formed, DNA-bound complexes and provide no information on the transition states that occur in the process of dimerization in solution. Furthermore, the data from the crystal structures provide no satisfactory explanation for dimerization specificities: all HLH factors possess similar hydrophobic dimerization contact residues, and yet tissue-specific bHLH factors show highly restricted dimerization specificities while E proteins demonstrate considerable promiscuity in dimerization. In vitro biochemical studies suggest that nonconserved hydrophilic residues may somehow contribute to HLH dimerization specificity (12Shirakata M. Friedman F.K. Paterson B.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2456-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). As an additional complication, in vitro dimerization of bHLH factors does not appear accurately to reflect the dimerization processin vivo. In most analyses, in vitro bHLH dimerization, whether with crude extracts or with purified proteins, is a highly inefficient process which requires subphysiologic temperatures and displays affinities in the micromolar range (13Sun X.-H.

Studies of in vivo dimerization portray a process that appears to be extremely efficient, with rapid heterodimerization occurring just prior to nuclear localization (17Goldfarb A.N. Lewandowska K. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 481-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 18Deed R.W. Armitage S. Norton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23603-23606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To study factors influencing dimerization in vivo, we have exploited a number of established systems applicable to bHLH dimerization, including yeast two-hybrid, mammalian two hybrid, nuclear redirection assays, and coimmunoprecipitation (4Hsu H.-L. Wadman I. Baer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3181-3185Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 17Goldfarb A.N. Lewandowska K. Exp.

Chem. 1993; 268: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that, contrary to findings in vitro, bHLH domains are not sufficient for dimerization in vivo. In particular, E proteins require an additional highly conserved domain, domain C, located carboxyl-terminal to helix 2. Tissue-specific bHLH factors, by contrast, require only the bHLH domain for heterodimerization with E proteins. Therefore, intrinsic structural differences exist between E proteins and tissue-specific bHLH factors, differences which may explain their different dimerization specificities. In particular, the role of domain C appears to be as an in vivo conformational determinant, maintaining the bHLH domain of E proteins in a “receptive” conformation for heterodimerization with tissue-specific bHLH proteins. Expression of LexA fusion proteins in yeast employed the vector pEG202, kindly provided by Dr. Roger Brent (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA) (21Zervos A.S. Gyuris J. Brent R.

Expression of B42 activation domain fusion proteins in yeast employed the vector pJG45, also kindly provided by Dr. Roger Brent. PCR upon plasmid templates was used to generate DNA fragments encoding the following: the bHLH domain of SCL/tal (amino acids 186–242), the 20-kDa naturally occurring isoform of SCL/tal (amino acids 176–331) (22Aplan P.D.

PCR fragments were cloned in-frame into pEG202 and pJG45 asEcoRI-XhoI fragments. pJG-Id1 and pJG-Id2, yeast expression plasmids encoding Id1 and Id2 as B42 fusion proteins, were previously isolated from a HeLa cDNA library in the vector pJG45 (library provided by Brent laboratory). For mammalian expression of the VP16 activation domain alone or fused to SCL/tal (amino acids 176–331), we used the plasmids pVP-HA1 and pVP16-TAL1, respectively, both generously provided by Dr. Richard Baer (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX) (4Hsu H.-L. Wadman I. Baer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3181-3185Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). For mammalian expression of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain fusion proteins, our laboratory generated a parent vector pCMV-DB which contains the GAL4 DNA-binding domain downstream of the CMV immediate early promoter. The starting vector consisted of pCMV5 (23Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlback H. Jornvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from which the EcoRI site had been eliminated, yielding pCMV5 R-. AHindIII-PstI fragment encoding the GAL4 DNA-binding domain was released from the yeast expression vector pGBT9 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and ligated into the corresponding sites in pCMV5 R-. E2-2 fragments (encoding amino acids 484–541 and 484–563) with EcoRI-XhoI ends were cloned into EcoRI-SalI sites of pCMV-DB, yielding plasmids with in-frame GAL4-E2-2 fusions, pCMV-DB-E2-2 bHLH, and pCMV-DB-E2-2 C. The G5E1bLUC reporter plasmid, with 5 GAL4-binding sites upstream of the E1b TATA sequence followed by the luciferase reporter gene, was generously provided by Dr. Richard Baer and has been described elsewhere (4Hsu H.-L. Wadman I. Baer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3181-3185Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). pEMSV-MyoD, kindly provided by the laboratory of Dr. Harold Weintraub (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Institute, Seattle WA), was used for mammalian expression of the full-length MyoD protein with its own activation domain. The mammalian expression plasmid for the nuclear localization-deficient mutant of SCL/tal, pCMB, has been previously described (24Goldfarb A.N. Goueli S. Mickelson D. Greenberg J.M. Blood. 1992; 80: 2858-2866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For bacterial expression of MBP and GST fusion proteins, SCL/tal (encoding amino acids 176–331) and E2-2 (encoding amino acids 484–541 or 484–563), were cloned asEcoRI-XhoI fragments into pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and pGEX4T-1 (Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). The yeast two-hybrid system developed in the laboratory of Roger Brent was employed as we have previously described (21Zervos A.S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 72: 223-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 25Goldfarb A.N. Lewandowska K. Shoham M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2683-2688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The yeast strains (EGY48 and YPH499), mating protocols, library screening protocols, and β-galactosidase assays have all been described in an earlier publication (25Goldfarb A.N. Lewandowska K. Shoham M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2683-2688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis of yeast expression of LexA fusion proteins, equivalent quantities of yeast grown to mid-log phase in CM-URA, -HIS, and -TRP media with 2% galactose, 1% raffinose were resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and boiled. Resultant Western blot membranes were probed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody to LexA, provided by Dr. Erica Golemis (Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA). Error-prone PCR amplification of the bHLH encoding region of SCL/tal included 0.25 mm MnCl2 in a standard PCR reaction (with 2.5 mm MgCl2 and 200 μm dNTPs). After 30 cycles of mutagenic amplification, 0.1 μl out of a 100-μl reaction was subjected to a second 30 cycles of mutagenic amplification. Similarly, 0.1 μl of the latter reaction was subjected to a third round of 30 cycles of mutagenic amplification. Equal quantities of PCR products resulting from 30, 60, and 90 cycles of mutagenic amplification were pooled and cloned into the EcoRI-XhoI sites of pJG45. A library of 2 × 106 primary bacterial colonies was thereby generated. A plasmid preparation of this library was then transformed into the yeast strain YPH499, yielding 1 × 106 primary yeast colonies. K562 cells in mid-log phase were resuspended at a concentration of 1 × 106cells/ml in RPMI 1640 media with 5% fetal bovine serum. For each transfection, 1.6 × 106 cells were combined with 6 μg of DNA and 30 μl of DOTAP (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN) premixed in 400 μl of Hepes-buffered saline. The 6 μg of DNA consisted of 2 μg of GAL4 expression plasmid (pCMV-DB, pCMV-DB-E2-2 bHLH or pCMV-DB-E2-2 C), 2 μg of activation domain expression plasmid (pVPHA1, pVP16-TAL1, or pEMSV-MyoD), and 2 μg of the G5E1bLUC luciferase reporter plasmid. After overnight incubation, the cells were resuspended in fresh RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum and cultured for an additional 24 h. To assay cells for luciferase activity, the Luciferase Assay System kit (Promega, Madison WI) was used, following the manufacturer's recommendations. In all cases, equivalent numbers of cells were harvested for luciferase assays. Light emission was measured on a Berthold Lumat LB 9501 luminometer (Berthold Systems Inc., Pittsburgh, PA). COS 7 cells were seeded on glass coverslips in RPMI 1640 with 5% fetal bovine serum at a density of 4 × 105 cells per 22-mm2 coverslip. Transfections were carried out overnight with 5 μg of plasmids and 25 μl of DOTAP (Boehringer Mannheim) per coverslip. The plasmids consisted of 2.5 μg of pCMB plus 2.5 μg of GAL4 expression plasmid (pCMV-DB, pCMV-DB-E2-2 bHLH, or pCMV-DB-E2-2 C). Cells were incubated in fresh RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum for 72 h prior to fixation. The protocols for cell fixation and indirect immunofluorescent staining for SCL/tal have been previously described (17Goldfarb A.N. Lewandowska K. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 481-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The cells were visualized on an MRC-600 confocal laser scanning imaging system (Bio-Rad Molecular Bioscience Group, Hercules, CA). COS 7 cells grown to ∼60% confluency in 75-cm2 flasks were transfected with 5 μg of pCMV-SCL/tal, an expression vector for full-length SCL/tal protein (amino acids 1–331) (24Goldfarb A.N. Goueli S.

Transfections were accomplished overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% neonatal calf serum using 50 μg of DOTAP (Boehringer Mannheim) plus 10 μg of plasmid per flask. After supplying the cells with fresh media consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% neonatal calf serum, the cells were incubated an additional 4 days prior to harvesting. For harvesting, cells were gently scraped in room temperature phosphate-buffered saline with 5 mm EDTA. Cell pellets were then resuspended in 300 μl of ice-cold NETN (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.2% aprotinin, and 200 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After a 10-min incubation on ice with intermittent inversion, insoluble cellular debris was eliminated by pelleting. 50-μl portions of the extracts were saved for direct immunoblot analysis. To the remaining 250 μl of extracts, 0.5 μg of rabbit anti-GAL4 DNA-binding domain antibody (number sc-577, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was added followed by incubation on ice 45 min with intermittent inversion. A 10-μl packed volume of protein A-agarose beads, prewashed in phosphate-buffered saline with 1% bovine serum albumin, were then added to each tube, followed by rotation at 4 °C for 30 min. The protein A-agarose beads were then washed 4 times with ice-cold NETN and resuspended in 50 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Immunoprecipitates and crude cellular extracts were then subjected to SDS-PAGE on 12% gels followed by electrotransfer to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblots were probed with the BTL-73 mouse monoclonal anti-SCL/tal antibody that was kindly provided by Karen Pulford (Oxford, United Kingdom) (26Pulford K. Lecointe N. Leroy-Viard K. Jones M. Mathieu-Mahul D. Mason D.Y. Blood. 1995; 85: 675-684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BTL-73 was used as a one-half dilution of a tissue culture supernatant. In addition, crude extracts from COS cell transfectants were probed in parallel with the rabbit anti-GAL4 antibody at a 1/500 dilution (0.2 ng/ml). Western blots were otherwise carried out as described previously (24Goldfarb A.N. Goueli S. Mickelson D. Greenberg J.M. Blood. 1992; 80: 2858-2866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Production and purification of bacterially expressed GST and MBP fusion proteins followed previously described protocols (5Goldfarb A.N. Lewandowska K. Blood. 1995; 85: 465-471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Surface plasmon resonance studies employed a BIAcore biosensor device (Pharmacia Biosensor, Piscataway, NJ) and followed previously described guidelines (27Pauza M.E. Doumbia S.O. Pennell C.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3259-3269PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, GST-E2-2 fusion proteins (encoding E2-2 bHLH (amino acids 484–541) or E2-2 C (amino acids 484–563)) diluted in 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.3) were covalently linked to the carboxymethyl-dextran hydrogel matrix on a CM5 flow cell by the standard amine coupling procedure described by the manufacturer (Pharmacia Biosensor, Piscataway, NJ). For GST-E2-2 bHLH, 1800 resonance units were immobilized, and for GST-E2-2 C, 1700 resonance units were immobilized. The soluble analyte, MBP-SCL/tal176–331 was used at a concentration of 4 μm in protein interaction buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.005% p20 surfactant). Just prior to analysis, analyte preparations were centrifuged through Microsep® 50,000 Mr cut-off microconcentrators (Filtron Technology Corp., Northborough, MA) to remove aggregates. The analyte was then flowed over the immobilized ligands at a rate of 5 μl/min. The minimal bHLH domains of E2-2, SCL/tal, and MyoD have been well defined by alignment analysis of a broad range of bHLH proteins from a wide variety of organisms (28Atchley W.R. Fitch W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5172-5176Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). To assay interaction of minimal bHLH domains in the yeast two-hybrid system the amino acid sequences indicated in Fig. 1 were expressed in yeast as fusions with either the LexA DNA-binding domain or the B42 transcription activation domain. Interaction within yeast between coexpressed LexA fusions and B42 fusions was reflected by activation of a β-galactosidase reporter gene containing upstream LexA-binding sites. As shown in Fig. 2, LexA fusions with the minimal bHLH domains of MyoD and SCL/tal (LexA-MyoD bHLH and LexA-SCL/tal bHLH) displayed specific interaction with a larger fragment of E2-2 encompassing the carboxyl-terminal 121 amino acids (E2-2 467–588) fused to the B42 activation domain. Surprisingly, LexA-MyoD bHLH and LexA-SCL/tal bHLH manifested no interaction with the minimal bHLH domain of E2-2 (amino acids 484–541) fused to B42. As will be shown below, similar results were obtained with E2-2 as the LexA fusion component and were not attributable to poor expression of E2-2 bHLH fusion proteins in yeast. These data suggest that the structural requirements for dimerization in the yeast two-hybrid system differ for tissue-specific bHLH proteins as compared with E proteins, the former requiring only the minimal bHLH domain and the latter requiring additional sequence.Figure 2Relative quantitation of HLH interactions using the yeast two-hybrid system. LexA DNA-binding domain fusions were coexpressed in yeast with B42 activation domain fusions. Protein interaction was reflected by activation of the LexA operator β-galactosidase reporter plasmid pSH18-34. LexA fusions include: LexA only as a negative control, LexA fused to the minimal bHLH domain of MyoD (as depicted in Fig. 1), and LexA fused to the minimal bHLH domain of SCL/tal (as depicted in Fig. 1). B42 fusions include: B42 fused to E2-2 467–588 which includes the bHLH domain as well as flanking amino acids, and B42 fused to the minimal bHLH domain of E2-2 (as depicted in Fig. 1). Liquid β-galactosidase assays were performed on three separate occasions. Results shown are mean ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To identify additional sequence requirements for E2-2 heterodimerization, a number of E2-2 truncations were expressed in yeast as LexA fusion proteins (Fig. 3 A). These LexA-E2-2 truncations were analyzed for interaction with B42 fusions containing the following HLH proteins: Id1, Id2, SCL/tal, and MyoD. As shown in Fig. 3 B, domain C, a stretch of 22 amino acids carboxyl-terminal to the HLH domain (amino acids 541–563) is both sufficient and necessary for heterodimerization of the E2-2 bHLH domain with an array of HLH partners. Interestingly, domain A, an acidic region upstream of the bHLH domain, which has been implicated in selective heterodimerization of E12 with MyoD (29Shirakata M. Paterson B.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1766-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), had no influence on the heterodimerization of E2-2 with the various HLH partners. To study further the role of domain C in the heterodimerization of E2-2, a number of control experiments were performed. First, Western blot analysis of LexA-E2-2 fusion expression in yeast demonstrated insufficient differences in expression levels of the various truncation mutants to account for the differences in interaction patterns (Fig. 4 A). For example, LexA-E2-2 467–541 (Fig. 4 A, lane 3) showed the same levels of expression as LexA-E2-2 484–563 (Fig. 4 A, lane 5), but only the latter LexA fusion demonstrated heterodimerization with the various HLH partners (Fig. 3 B). Second, we isolated two independent altered-specificity mutants of SCL/tal, SE1 and SS1, that exclusively recognized forms of E2-2 lacking domain C (Fig. 4 B). These mutants were isolated from a library of randomly mutated SCL/tal bHLH domains using a yeast two-hybrid screen for interaction with the minimal bHLH domain of E2-2 fused to LexA. The selectivity of SCL/tal mutants SE1 and SS1 for E2-2 lacking domain C rules out any trivial explanations for the role of domain C, i.e. nuclear localization or permitting DNA binding by LexA. In fact, these data indicate that domain C influences the conformation of the E2-2 bHLH domain such that the presence of domain C permits exclusive heterodimerization with wild type HLH partners and the absence of domain C permits exclusive heterodimerization with the SCL/tal mutants SE1 and SS1. To extend the findings in the yeast two-hybrid system, three independent assays were employed to analyze in vivoHLH dimerization in mammalian cells. In the mammalian two-hybrid system, K562 cells were transiently co-transfected with vectors expressing fusions with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and with the VP16 activation domain. Also included in the transfection was the GAL5E1bLUC reporter plasmid which contains GAL4-binding sites upstream of the luciferase gene. As has been previously described, interaction of GAL4 fusions with VP16 fusions activates expression of the luciferase reporter gene (30Wadman I. Li J. Bash R.O. Forster A. Osada H. Rabbitts T.H. Baer R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4831-4839Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 A, a GAL4 fusion with the minimal E2-2 bHLH domain (E2-2 amino acids 484–541) showed no interaction above background with a VP16-SCL/tal fusion. However, inclusion of domain C in the GAL4-E2-2 fusion (E2-2 amino acids 484–563) permitted interaction with VP16-SCL/tal. In Fig. 5 B, GAL4 fusions were coexpressed with full-length MyoD. Because MyoD has its own potent activation domains, it was not necessary to express MyoD as a VP16 fusion. As with VP16-SCL/tal, MyoD failed to interact with a GAL4 fusion with the minimal E2-2 bHLH domain (E2-2 amino acids 484–541). As predicted, inclusion of domain C in the GAL4-E2-2 fusion (E2-2 amino acids 484–563) restored the in vivo interaction with MyoD. In the nuclear redirection assay, which has been previously described (17Goldfarb A.N. Lewandowska K. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 481-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 18Deed R.W. Armitage S. Norton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23603-23606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), COS cells were transfected with an expression plasmid for a mutant SCL/tal which lacks a nuclear localization signal. In addition, the COS cells were cotransfected with expression plasmids for either E2-2 bHLH only or E2-2 bHLH with domain C, each fused to the GAL4 nuclear localization signal. Cells were then analyzed for subcellular localization of SCL/tal by indirect immunofluorescence with confocal microscopy. When coexpressed with only the GAL4 nuclear localization signal, the SCL/tal mutant showed predominantly cytoplasmic localization with perinuclear accumulation (Fig. 6 A). When coexpressed with E2-2 bHLH with domain C (E2-2 amino acids 484–563), the SCL/tal mutant showed efficient nuclear localization as a result of its heterodimerization with E2-2, a process referred to as nuclear redirection (Fig. 6 B). By contrast, no nuclear redirection of mutant SCL/tal was observed with coexpression of the minimal E2-2 bHLH domain (E2-2 amino acids 484–541), indicating an absence of heterodimerization (Fig. 6 C). In coimmunoprecipitation assays (Fig. 7), COS cells were cotransfected with expression vectors for full-length SCL/tal (pCMV-SCL/tal) and either GAL4-E2-2 bHLH (pCMV-DB-E2-2 bHLH) or GAL4-E2-2 C (pCMV-DB-E2-2 C). Transfectants were subjected to low stringency immunoprecipitation with rabbit anti-GAL4 antibodies. Immune complexes were then analyzed by immunoblot with the BTL-73 monoclonal antibody specific for SCL/tal (26Pulford K. Lecointe N. Leroy-Viard K. Jones M. Mathieu-Mahul D. Mason D.Y. Blood. 1995; 85: 675-684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7, while no detectable SCL/tal protein could be detected in complex with GAL4-E2-2 bHLH (lane 1), the 42 kDa full-length isoform of SCL/tal could be detected in complex with GAL4-E2-2 C (lane 2). As shown in the immunoblots in the lower panels of Fig. 7, crude extracts from both COS cell transfectants contained similar quantities of SCL/tal and GAL4-E2-2 proteins. The doublet observed on immunoblotting for SCL/tal has been previously described (24Goldfarb A.N. Goueli S. Mickelson D. Greenberg J.M. Blood. 1992; 80: 2858-2866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, three independent assay systems, mammalian two-hybrid, nuclear redirection, and coimmunoprecipitation, all confirm the requirement for domain C forin vivo heterodimerization of E2-2 in mammalian cells"

Hybrid enzymes were produced from the wild-type subunit and a mutant subunit, whose substrate specificity was altered to that of malate dehydrogenase, and separated to analyze the substrate-induced homotropic activation mechanism. Oxamate, a competitive inhibitor of l-lactate dehydrogenase, was used to mimic the substrate-induced activation of the wild-type subunit as “a regulatory subunit.” The malate dehydrogenase activity of the mutant subunit as “the catalytic subunit” of the hybrid enzymes was measured, and the activity of the mutant subunit was activated on the addition of oxamate. Thus, we directly observed the inter-subunit homotropic activation transmitted from the wild-type to the mutant subunit. Moreover, “isomeric” hybrid enzymes that have different structural subunit arrangements but identical subunit compositions showed identical kinetic natures. This indicates that the enzyme maintains its subunit symmetry during the allosteric transition. l-Lactate dehydrogenase fromBifidobacterium longum shows homotropic activation by pyruvate as well as heterotropic activation by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate.

Moreover, “isomeric” hybrid enzymes that have different structural subunit arrangements but identical subunit compositions showed identical kinetic natures. This indicates that the enzyme maintains its subunit symmetry during the allosteric transition. Most oligomeric allosteric proteins do not show hyperbolic Michaelis-type saturation curves, but sigmoidal ones in certain conditions. This phenomenon originates from the activation following an increase in the substrate concentration, and has been called “homotropic activation.” Most kinetic studies on the homotropic activation of allosteric enzymes have focused on their sigmoidal substrate saturation curves. An alternative approach is analysis of the activation with the addition of low concentrations of “inhibitors” with subsaturating levels of substrates (1Gerhart J.C. Pardee A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 891-896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Foote J. Schachman H.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 186: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This activation indicates that the binding of an inhibitor to an active site affects the catalytic activity of neighboring active sites. With this method, however, complete analysis of the activation is quite complex, because the inhibitor and substrate compete at the active site. l-Lactate dehydrogenases (LDHs) 1The abbreviations used are: LDH,l-lactate dehydrogenase; FBP, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate; MDH, malate dehydrogenase; native PAGE, nondenaturating polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; L subunit, wild type LDH subunit; M subunit, MDH-type mutant subunit; MES, 2-(N-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid. (EC 1.1.1.27) have been purified from a variety of organisms and tissues, and their structures and functions have been studied in detail (3Holbrook J.J. Liljas A. Steindel S.J. Rossmann M.G. Boyer P.D. 3rd Ed. The Enzymes. 11. Academic Press, New York1975: 191-292Google Scholar). The active form of LDHs is a tetramer of identical 30–35-kDa subunits. The LDHs from some bacteria are allosteric enzymes exhibiting sigmoidal kinetics for pyruvate (homotropic activation), and are allosterically activated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) (heterotropic activation) (4Garvie E.I. Microbiol. Rev. 1980; 44: 106-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), unlike non-allosteric vertebrate LDHs. Bifidobacterium longum l-lactate dehydrogenase is an FBP-dependent allosteric LDH (5Minowa T. Iwata S. Sakai H. Masaki H. Ohta T. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 85: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 6Iwata S. Minowa T. Sakai H. Ohta T. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1989; 53: 3365-3366Google Scholar). Abundant structural information on the enzyme has been obtained from its crystal structures (7Iwata S. Kamata K. Yoshida S. Minowa T. Ohta T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 8Iwata S. Ohta T. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Four subunits of B. longum l-lactate dehydrogenase are related by three molecular 2-fold axes named P, Q, and R, as for vertebrate LDHs (9Rossmann M.G. Adams M.J. Buehner M. Ford G.C. Hackert M.L. Liljas A. Rao S.T. Banaszak L.J. Hill E. Tsernoglou D. Webb L. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 76: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The tetramer has four active sites and two FBP-binding sites. The active site of each subunit lies near the Q-axis interface. On the other hand, the FBP-binding site is at the P-axis interface and is composed of residues from two subunits related by the P-axis. B. longum l-lactate dehydrogenase subunits are not in contact along the R-axis. In the crystal structure (7Iwata S. Kamata K. Yoshida S. Minowa T. Ohta T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), two tetramers with different allosteric states are packed into the same crystal lattice with the space group of F222. One tetramer is in a no affinity state (T-state) and the other is in a high affinity state (R-state) to the substrate. The P-, Q-, and R-axes correspond to the three crystallographic 2-fold axes of both T- and R-state tetramers. The crystal structure represents the two symmetric allosteric states, and is an ideal example of the concerted model proposed by Monodet al. (10Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.-P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6176) Google Scholar). Therefore, the proposed allosteric model of B. longum l-lactate dehydrogenase is based on the concerted model (7Iwata S. Kamata K. Yoshida S. Minowa T. Ohta T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear whether the allosteric symmetry is also maintained in solution. In the previous paper (11Fushinobu S. Kamata K. Iwata S. Sakai H. Ohta T. Matsuzawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25611-25616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we reported the mechanism of FBP-dependent heterotropic activation with hybrid enzymes with FBP-sensitive and -insensitive subunits. The hybrid enzymes were obtained by means of an in vivo subunit hybridization system with a plasmid that carries the two B. longum l-lactate dehydrogenase genes tandemly. To separate the mixture of the subunit hybrids by chromatography and electrophoresis, a negatively charged tag was mutationally introduced into one of the pairs of subunits. Kinetic analyses of the hybrid enzymes revealed that the heterotropic activation is transmitted from the FBP-binding site to the active sites of other subunits via the subunit interaction, and thus the results support the validity of the proposed concerted allosteric model (7Iwata S. Kamata K. Yoshida S. Minowa T. Ohta T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In this study, using the subunit hybridization system constructed previously, we analyzed the mechanism of homotropic activation by the substrate. The mutant B. longum l-lactate dehydrogenase whose Gln-102 2Residue numbers are given in the N-system (23Eventoff W. Rossmann M.G. Taylor S.S. Torff H.-J. Meyer H. Keil W. Kiltz H.-H. Proc. Natl.

Using hybrid enzymes comprising the MDH-type Q102R 3Gln-102 was replaced with arginine; similar abbreviations are used as indicated. mutant subunit and the wild type LDH subunit, the cooperative interaction between the two different types of subunits could be analyzed. Based on the kinetics of the subunit hybrids, we could clarify the homotropic activation mechanism as well as the symmetric allosteric transition. Sodium pyruvate and NADH were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim and Life Technologies Oriental (Tokyo, Japan), respectively. Oxalacetic acid and sodium oxamate were purchased from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). The enzymes used for DNA manipulation were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim, Takara Shuzo (Kyoto, Japan), and Toyobo Biochemicals (Tokyo, Japan). The mutations for K316E/R317D (11Fushinobu S. Kamata K. Iwata S. Sakai H. Ohta T. Matsuzawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25611-25616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and Q102R (12Ohta T. Yokota K. Minowa T. Iwata S. Faraday Discuss. 1992; 93: 153-161Crossref Google Scholar) in B. longum l-lactate dehydrogenase were introduced as described previously. The genes for both mutant enzymes were carried by plasmids derived from pUBM9 (14Iwata S. Minowa T. Mikami B. Morita Y. Ohta T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 106: 558-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In the plasmids, aBamHI unique site and a PvuII unique one are present before the promoter and after the terminator, respectively. The expression vector for in vivo hybridization was constructed so as to carry the two B. longum l-lactate dehydrogenase genes tandemly. The 1.6-kilobaseBamHI-PvuII fragment of the charge-tagged K316E/R317D LDH gene was blunt-ended and then inserted into the PvuII site of the expression vector of the Q102R mutant gene. The hybrids were produced and separated as described previously (11Fushinobu S. Kamata K. Iwata S. Sakai H. Ohta T. Matsuzawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25611-25616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). At the final step of Mono-Q column chromatography with a linear gradient of 0 to 0.6m KCl in 60 min, the hybrids were separated on the basis of their charged tags as expected. Nondenaturating polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (native PAGE) was performed as described previously (11Fushinobu S. Kamata K. Iwata S. Sakai H. Ohta T. Matsuzawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25611-25616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The standard assay for LDH activity was performed at 30 °C in 50 mm MES-NaOH buffer (pH 6.0) containing 0.2 mm NADH, 5 mm pyruvate, and 0 or 0.1 mm FBP. For MDH activity, 2 mm oxaloacetate was used as the substrate instead of pyruvate. The steady-state kinetics of the hybrids were examined with various concentrations of the substrate and oxamate. The concentration of enzyme subunits was 4.3 nm. One unit was defined as the amount of enzyme that converted 1 μmol of substrate per minute. To calculate kinetic parameters from the saturation curves for the substrate (or oxamate), the Hill equation (15Dixon M. Webb E.C. Enzymes. 3rd Ed. Longman, London1979: 400-402Google Scholar) was used for sigmoidal curve fitting, νVmax=(substrate)nH(substrate)nH+(S0.5)nH where Vmax is the maximum velocity of catalysis, S0.5 the half-saturating concentration of the substrate, and nH the Hill coefficient. For hyperbolic saturation curves, the Michaelis equation was used (nH of the Hill equation = 1). For oxamate activation curves, A0.5(oxamate) was calculated instead of S0.5. An MDH-type mutant form (M4) of B. longum l-lactate dehydrogenase whose Gln-102 residue was replaced with arginine lost its LDH activity (Table I), but acquired MDH activity (Table II). Using hybrid enzymes comprising the wild type LDH subunit (L subunit) and the MDH-type mutant subunit (M subunit), we investigated the allosteric interaction between the two types of subunits in one tetramer. In other words, we investigated whether homotropic activation is also transmitted through a quaternary structural change, like the heterotropic activation by FBP (11Fushinobu S. Kamata K. Iwata S.

Open table in a new tab In vivo hybrid formation from the M and L subunits, and separation of the hybrids were carried out by almost the same methods as described previously (11Fushinobu S. Kamata K. Iwata S. Sakai H. Ohta T. Matsuzawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25611-25616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The negatively charged tag used for hybrid separation was the double replacement of Lys-316 and Arg-317 with glutamic acid and aspartic acid, respectively. The allosteric properties of the charge-tagged enzyme are not affected by these mutations, as reported previously (11Fushinobu S. Kamata K. Iwata S. Sakai H. Ohta T. Matsuzawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25611-25616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the negatively charged tag causes differences in the total surface charge of the hybrid tetramer with different subunit compositions, and makes it possible to separate hybrids by anion exchange chromatography and native PAGE (11Fushinobu S. Kamata K. Iwata S. Sakai H. Ohta T. Matsuzawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25611-25616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The negatively charged tag was introduced into the L subunit, the M and L subunits having mutations Q102R and K316E/R317D, respectively. An expression plasmid carrying the genes for the M and L subunits tandemly was constructed as described under “Materials and Methods.” The hybrid enzymes produced by E. coli cells were separated into six peaks on anion-exchange chromatography (Fig. 1 a), as expected from the previous results (11Fushinobu S. Kamata K. Iwata S. Sakai H. Ohta T. Matsuzawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25611-25616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The enzymes gave five bands with different mobilities on native PAGE (Fig. 1 b, lanes 0). The band intensities were well reflected by the binomial distribution of tetrameric hybrids between the M and L subunits in the molar ratio of 1:0.3 (untagged subunit: charge-tagged subunit). This means that random hybridization between the M and L subunits had occurred. The lowest protein bands in lanes 0 in Fig. 1 b were not clearly visible because of the lower expression level of the L subunit than that of the M subunit. The five bands at regular intervals arose from five differently charged hybrids. From the profile on chromatography (Fig. 1 a) and the mobility on native PAGE (Fig. 1 b), the numerical subunit compositions could be determined. Thus, the hybrids in peaks 1, 2, 5, and 6 were named M4, M3L1, M1L3, and L4, respectively (Fig. 1 c). The hybrids in peaks 3 and 4 showed the same mobility as that of M2L2 on native PAGE (Fig. 1 b, lanes 3 and 4). The ratio of the areas of these peaks on anion-exchange chromatography was about 2:1 (1.8:1 in Fig. 1 a). Re-chromatography of each of the hybrids from the two separate peaks only gave a peak at the same position as before. These results of native PAGE and chromatography were almost the same as those for the previously reported hybrid enzymes, D2W2-QR and D2W2-P, similarly obtained by hybridization between the desensitized subunit (D) and the wild-type subunit (W) of B. longum l-lactate dehydrogenase (11Fushinobu S. Kamata K. Iwata S. Sakai H. Ohta T. Matsuzawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25611-25616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus, the hybrids in peaks 3 and 4 were named M2L2-QR and M2L2-P (Fig. 1 c), and assigned as “isomers” with different structural arrangements. M2L2-P contained two M subunits along the molecular P-axis, and M2L2-QR was a mixture of two other hybrids with two M subunits along the Q- and R-axes. The structural assignment of D2W2-QR and D2W2-P was carried out on the basis of the FBP sensitivities of the hybrids (11Fushinobu S. Kamata K. Iwata S. Sakai H. Ohta T. Matsuzawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25611-25616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), because the FBP-binding sites are located at the P-axis interface and one site is composed of residues from two subunits related by the P-axis (7Iwata S. Kamata K. Yoshida S. Minowa T. Ohta T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). From the saturation curves for both LDH (pyruvate as a substrate) and MDH (oxaloacetate as a substrate) activities, Vmax, S0.5, and nH (the Hill coefficient) of the hybrid enzymes were calculated, and are summarized in Tables I and II, respectively. Vmax(pyruvate), S0.5(pyruvate), and nH(pyruvate) are parameters for LDH activity, and Vmax(oxaloacetate), S0.5(oxaloacetate), and nH(oxaloacetate) are for MDH activity. In the absence of FBP, the LDH and MDH activities were both very weak for all hybrids (data not shown) but L4 and M1L3 (Table I). L4 and M1L3 exhibited weak LDH activities, but their S0.5(pyruvate) were large. In the presence of FBP, L4 and M4 exhibited high LDH and MDH activities, which were their canonical activities, respectively. As for non-canonical activity, M4 exhibited no LDH activity, but L4 had considerable MDH activity. Vmax(oxaloacetate) of L4 was almost the same as that of M4, but S0.5(oxaloacetate) was about 100 times different between the two enzymes, i.e. 4.1 and 0.051 mm, respectively. These results indicate that pyruvate can bind only to the L subunit, and that oxaloacetate can bind strongly to the M subunit but weakly to the L subunit. Oxamate, which is a non-reactive analog of pyruvate, strongly inhibited L4 (IOxam 0.5(pyruvate) = 0.4 mm and IOxam 0.5(oxaloacetate) = 0.13 mm), but only slightly inhibited the MDH activity of M4 (IOxam 0.5(oxaloacetate) = 41 mm), indicating that oxamate can bind to the active site of the L subunit, but not to that of the M subunit. nH(oxaloacetate) of M4 was 3.4, exhibiting strong cooperativity as a tetramer. As the number of the M subunits decreased, nH(oxaloacetate) decreased, approaching 1. However, nH(pyruvate) of L4 was 1.3. The allosteric equilibrium of M4 may have shifted greatly toward the inactive T-state compared with L4, probably because of the mutation in the active site. In the absence of FBP, the MDH activities (at 2 mm oxaloacetate) of the hybrid enzymes were measured with the addition of oxamate (Fig. 2 a), which can only bind to the L subunit. In this measurement, the L and M subunits act as “a regulatory subunit” and “a catalytic subunit,” respectively. The L subunit possibly has MDH activity in this condition, but, as shown in Table II, S0.5(oxaloacetate) of L4 (4.1 mm) was sufficiently larger than IOxam 0.5(oxaloacetate) of L4 (0.13 mm). Therefore, the MDH activity of the L subunits seemed to be ignored owing to the inhibition by oxamate. The hybrids, which consisted of both M and L subunits (M3L1, M2L2-QR, M2L2-P, and M1L3), were activated on the addition of oxamate. On the other hand, M4 and L4 were not activated. These results indicate that the homotropic activation mimicked by oxamate bound to the L subunit is transmitted to the M subunit in an inter-subunit manner. Table III shows the parameters characterizing these oxamate activation curves (Fig. 2 a), which were obtained using the Hill equation (15Dixon M. Webb E.C. Enzymes. 3rd Ed. Longman, London1979: 400-402Google Scholar). M3L1 gave a hyperbolic Michaelis-type curve (nH(oxamate) = 1) since it had only one oxamate-binding L subunit. As the number of the L subunits in the hybrids increased, nH(oxamate) increased (1.2 for M2L2-QR and M2L2-P, and 2.1 for M1L3), and the enzymes gave sigmoidal activation curves. Conversely, A0.5(oxamate) decreased as the number of the L subunits increased. Vmax(oxamate) should be proportional to the number of the M subunits. Vmax(oxamate) of M2L2-QR and M2L2-P were about two times as large as that of M1L3, but M3L1 showed lower Vmax(oxamate) than those of the two M2L2 hybrids. This contradiction seems to be a consequence of oxamate inhibition of the M subunit with high concentrations of oxamate. Because A0.5(oxamate) of M3L1 was larger than that of the other hybrids, over 40 mm oxamate was needed for saturation, at which the M subunit was inhibited, showing only about half the maximum activity (IOxam 0.5(oxaloacetate) of M4 = 41 mm in Table II).Table IIIParameters of the activation curves with oxamateHybridVmax(oxamate)A0.5 (oxamate)nH(oxamate)units/mgmmM3L11103-aValues calculated on fitting to the Michaelis equation. ± 8233-aValues calculated on fitting to the Michaelis equation. ± 41.03-aValues calculated on fitting to the Michaelis equation.M2L2-QR210 ± 3019 ± 21.2 ± 0.1M2L2-P220 ± 3020 ± 31.2 ± 0.1M1L3110 ± 313 ± 32.1 ± 0.23-a Values calculated on fitting to the Michaelis equation. Open table in a new tab These results were different from those of the former study on hybrids of the MDH-type B. longum l-lactate dehydrogenase (12Ohta T. Yokota K. Minowa T. Iwata S. Faraday Discuss. 1992; 93: 153-161Crossref Google Scholar). In that study, the M2L2 hybrid could not be separated into two peaks (M2L2-QR and M2L2-P), and the M3L1 hybrid was not activated on the addition of oxamate. The separation tags (two charged residues) added at the C-terminals of both the M and L subunits seem to have caused a structural change, affecting the allosteric transition. Therefore, in our previous study (11Fushinobu S. Kamata K. Iwata S. Sakai H. Ohta T. Matsuzawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25611-25616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the tag position was chosen so as not to affect the allosteric properties of B. longum l-lactate dehydrogenase, and accompanying steric effects enabled M2L2 isomers to be separated. M2L2-QR and M2L2-P have the same subunit composition, but their structural arrangements are different, as illustrated in Fig. 1 c. Interestingly, however, their kinetic properties were identical in every condition we examined here. Not only with various oxamate concentrations and a constant oxaloacetate concentration (Fig. 2 a), but also with various oxaloacetate concentrations and constant (10 and 50 mm) oxamate concentrations (Fig. 2 b), M2L2-QR and M2L2-P showed the same activity, within the limit of experimental error at every measured point. The parameters for the inter-subunit homotropic activation (Table III) as well as those for the substrate saturation curves of the LDH and MDH activities (Tables I and II) were all very similar between M2L2-QR and M2L2-P. This finding that hybrid enzymes with different structural arrangements were kinetically identical strongly suggests the symmetric allosteric activation of the enzyme. To analyze the homotropic activation using hybrid enzymes, oxamate, a substrate analog and an inhibitor of LDH, was used as an activator in this study, because it can only bind to the L subunit in the R-state. In the absence of FBP and pyruvate (or oxamate), practically all molecules of B. longum l-lactate dehydrogenase are in the T-state (7Iwata S. Kamata K. Yoshida S. Minowa T. Ohta T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Oxamate bound to the L subunit shifts the allosteric equilibrium toward the R-state, and thus activates the L subunit. The results of this study demonstrated that the activation was transmitted to the M subunit from the L subunit via subunit interaction. In our previous paper (11Fushinobu S. Kamata K. Iwata S. Sakai H. Ohta T. Matsuzawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25611-25616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the heterotropic activation by FBP was shown to be transmitted via inter-subunit communication, using hybrid enzymes with FBP-sensitive and -desensitized subunits. Here, we showed a similar activation mechanism for the homotropic activation by substrate analog. Detailed quantitative analyses including determination of the allosteric constant were not possible because the strong substrate inhibition of B. longum l-lactate dehydrogenase (11Fushinobu S. Kamata K. Iwata S. Sakai H. Ohta T. Matsuzawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25611-25616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) prevented exact curve fitting. Comparison of the kinetic parameters among the hybrid enzymes, however, provided strong support for the concerted allosteric model of B. longum l-lactate dehydrogenase. As the number of the L subunits in the hybrids increased, nH(oxamate) increased and A0.5(oxamate) decreased (Table III). The change in nH(oxamate) indicates the greater cooperativity of the hybrids with more L subunits which can bind oxamate. It is apparent from A0.5(oxamate) that a smaller amount of oxamate can saturate the hybrid enzymes with more L subunits, because the hybrid enzymes with more L subunits can bind more oxamate and the cooperativity of the active sites promotes oxamate saturation. These tendencies of the kinetic parameters agree with the concerted allosteric model (10Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.-P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6176) Google Scholar). In the FBP-induced heterotropic activation (11Fushinobu S. Kamata K. Iwata S. Sakai H. Ohta T. Matsuzawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25611-25616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we could not observe the P-axis related interaction because the FBP-binding site is located at the P-axis interface. In this study, however, the use of an active-site mutant made it possible to reveal the inter-subunit communication at the P- and Q-axis interfaces. Because the enzyme has no R-axis related interaction, the activation of M2L2-P represents the interaction at the Q-axis interface. Similarly, the activation of M2L2-QR corresponds to the sum of the interactions at the P- and Q-axis interfaces. The structural features of the P- and Q-axis interfaces are different (7Iwata S. Kamata K. Yoshida S. Minowa T. Ohta T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), but their contributions to the homotropic activation were concluded to be the same, because if either the P- or Q-axis related dimer was the strongly linked cooperative unit, the homotropic activation of M2L2-P and M2L2-QR would not be identical. Comparison between hybrids M2L2-P and M2L2-QR with different structural arrangements confirmed the concerted activation of the enzyme. Because the structural “isomers,” M2L2-QR and M2L2-P, showed identical activation, the cooperative unit of the enzyme seems to be a whole tetramer, and the allosteric symmetry of the tetramer should be maintained during a shift of the equilibrium. Thus, the allosteric state of the enzyme should be either the T-state tetramer or the R-state tetramer. On the basis of the results obtained on analyses of the hybrid enzymes in this study and the previous one (11Fushinobu S. Kamata K. Iwata S. Sakai H. Ohta T. Matsuzawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25611-25616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), together with the knowledge of the crystal structures (7Iwata S. Kamata K. Yoshida S. Minowa T. Ohta T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we can describe a more detailed allosteric model of B. longum l-lactate dehydrogenase, like the “differential gear-model” of aspartate transcarbamylase (16Perutz M.F. Mechanisms of Cooperativity and Allosteric Regulation in Proteins. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, England1989Crossref Scopus (484) Google Scholar). In Fig. 3, the P- and Q-axis interfaces are schematically represented as indents with different shapes. The allosteric transition between the T- and R-states involves the rotation of each subunit (7Iwata S. Kamata K. Yoshida S. Minowa T. Ohta T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). His-68 causes steric hindrance at the active site of the next subunit in the T-state, but the subunit rotation abolishes the hindrance between the Q-axis related dimers. The allosteric cooperativity originates from the equilibrium between the T- and R-state tetramers, and the allosteric transition mechanism can explain both the homotropic cooperativity and the heterotropic activation, as described for the concerted model (10Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.-P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6176) Google Scholar). For homotropic activation, the substrate bound to the active site shifts the equilibrium toward the R-state. Hence, the substrate saturation curve becomes sigmoidal. For heterotropic activation, FBP bound to the effector site also shifts the equilibrium toward the R-state. The phosphate moiety of FBP neutralizes the positive charge repulsion at the P-axis interface, and stabilizes the R-state in which the subunits at the P-axis interface slightly approaches each other (0.5 Å closer at the FBP-binding site) than in the T-state. The subunit interactions at the P- and Q-axis interfaces link the structural change and maintain the allosteric state of the tetramer symmetric. Subunit interactions also play an important role in allosteric transitions in the cases of other well studied allosteric proteins (16Perutz M.F. Mechanisms of Cooperativity and Allosteric Regulation in Proteins. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, England1989Crossref Scopus (484) Google Scholar). In particular, the communication between the catalytic subunits of hybrid aspartate transcarbamylase has been demonstrated: the effects of ligand binding are propagated to chemically introduced chromophores on the other catalytic subunits via the regulatory subunits (17Yang Y.R. Schachman H.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5187-5191Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In the case of B. longum l-lactate dehydrogenase, each of the four subunits rotates as a rigid unit on the allosteric transition, and this is a rare and the most simple example of the concerted model in terms of the structural change when compared with well studied tetrameric allosteric proteins (18Mattevi A. Rizzi M. Bolognesi M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 824-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In tetrameric allosteric proteins like hemoglobin (16Perutz M.F. Mechanisms of Cooperativity and Allosteric Regulation in Proteins. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, England1989Crossref Scopus (484) Google Scholar), phosphofructokinase (16Perutz M.F. Mechanisms of Cooperativity and Allosteric Regulation in Proteins. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, England1989Crossref Scopus (484) Google Scholar), and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (19Zhang Y. Liang J.-Y. Huang S. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 609-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the transition is based on the rotation of one dimer with respect to the other, in such a way that the intersubunit contacts within each of the two rotating bodies are preserved. In studies involving hybrid formation systems of partially ligated hemoglobin subunits, cooperative free energy for the specific “microstate” isomers has been dissected, and cooperativity between the α and β hemes of each dimeric half-molecule has been revealed (20Ackers G.K. Hazzard J.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 385-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It is an interesting question as to how the symmetry of the allosteric transition is general among various allosteric proteins. In the crystal structures of allosteric pyruvate kinase (21Mattevi A. Bolognesi M. Valentini G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the tetramer exhibits 222 subunit symmetry, and rotation of the domains in the subunit controls the activity. However, the symmetry of the allosteric transition in solution is unknown. The cooperative unit of the insulin hexamer is a trimer, and the two trimers undergo changes in their allosteric states independently (T6-T3R3-R6) (22Bloom C.R. Choi W.E. Brzovic P.S. Ha J.J. Huang S.-T. Kaarsholm N.C. Dunn M.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 324-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Therefore, the protein exhibits unique negative homotropic cooperativity. Like the B. longum l-lactate dehydrogenase studies reported here and in Ref. 11Fushinobu S. Kamata K. Iwata S. Sakai H. Ohta T. Matsuzawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25611-25616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, the mutational subunit hybridization technique can also provide information on the allosteric symmetry in solution for other proteins, if a proper tag mutation is introduced so that the structural isomers can be separated."

These subunits likely reside at the base of the enzyme since they are required for binding F1 to F0(7Futai M. Noumi T. Maeda M. J. Bioenerg.

Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4819-4823Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The reactions of sorting the F1 subunits into mitochondria and the subsequent folding reactions within the organelle are mediated by heat-shock proteins (Hsps) 1The abbreviations used are: HSP, heat-shock protein(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair; kb, kilobase pair; MBP, maltose binding protein; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. that serve as “molecular chaperones” in the cell (15Hendrick J.P. Hartl F.-U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). With respect to the biogenesis of mitochondrial proteins (such as the F1), the combined activities of the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial Hsp70-Hsp40 chaperone pairs are proposed to mediate the translocation of unfolded proteins into mitochondria; folding the polypeptide chain in the matrix is then facilitated by the Hsp60 and Hsp10 proteins (for review, see Refs. 15Hendrick J.P. Hartl F.-U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar and 16Clark A.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In the specific case of F1 biogenesis, the final steps in the enzyme formation require two proteins, Atp11p and Atp12p, neither of which has significant sequence homology with other proteins in the data banks (17Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 18Bowman S. Ackerman S.H. Griffiths D.E. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7517-7523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Ackerman S.H. Martin J. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7386-7394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast mutants that are deficient for either Atp11p or Atp12p accumulate the F1 α and β subunits in large protein aggregates instead of forming the enzyme oligomer (17Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In contrast to Hsp60-deficient strains, which show aggregation of both the mature and precursor forms of the F1 β subunit (20Cheng M.Y. Hartl F.-U. Martin J. Pollock R.A. Kalousek F. Neupert W. Hallberg E.M. Hallberg R.L. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1989; 337: 620-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar), only the mature form of the F1 subunits is observed in atp11 and atp12 mutants (17Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). For this reason, Atp11p and Atp12p are suggested to act at a point in the F1 assembly pathway that is downstream from the Hsp60 step. In considering the type of action elicited by Atp11p and Atp12p during F1 assembly, it is informative to compare the phenotypes of atp11 and atp12 strains with those of yeast that have null mutations in the individual F1 structural subunit genes. For instance, yeast that are deficient for the α subunit harbor the β subunits as aggregated proteins; likewise, the α subunit aggregates in the β subunit null strains (17Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, aggregation of the F1 α and β subunits is the signature phenotype of atp11 and atp12 strains. In contrast, the α and β subunits remain soluble in mitochondria of γ (13Paul M.-F. Ackerman S. Yue J. Arselin G. Velours J. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26158-26164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), δ (12Giraud M.-F. Velours J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 851-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), or ε (11Guelin E. Chevallier J. Rigoulet M. Guerin B. Velours J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 161-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) null mutants, despite the fact that the absence of any of these subunits blocks F1 assembly. Moreover, in γ subunit-deficient yeast, the α and β subunits sediment in linear sucrose gradients to the position where αβ dimers would be expected (13Paul M.-F. Ackerman S. Yue J. Arselin G. Velours J. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26158-26164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that aggregation of the F1 α and β subunits prevails only under conditions in which αβ dimerization is not possible, such as in the α or β subunit null strains, or in yeast that lack a protein (i.e.Atp11p or Atp12p) whose function may be to mediate α/β oligomerization. The proposal that Atp11p and Atp12p serve as chaperones during F1 biogenesis is supported by the fact that Atp11p and Atp12p are present in mitochondria at levels that are several orders of magnitude lower than the amount of F1 α and β subunit protein (21White M. Ackerman S.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) 2Z.-G. Wang and S. H. Ackerman, unpublished observations. which is in accord with the fact that there is only a small pool of unassembled F1 proteins in the steady state (22Burns D.J. Lewin A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12066-12073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present paper reports on features of the Atp12p protein that are important for its action as an F1 assembly factor. The primary translation product of the ATP12 gene is a 37-kDa precursor protein, which is cleaved to generate the mature polypeptide (33 kDa) following import into mitochondria (18Bowman S. Ackerman S.H. Griffiths D.E. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7517-7523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In previous work Atp12p was shown to be a soluble protein of the mitochondrial matrix that sediments in linear sucrose gradients as an oligomer of 70–80 kDa (18Bowman S. Ackerman S.H. Griffiths D.E. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7517-7523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The current work presents evidence that the Atp12p oligomer observed in mitochondria is likely heterogeneous in content and indicates a region in the Atp12p primary structure that is important for intermolecular associations of the protein. In addition, the functional domain of Atp12p was identified and shown to include an acidic amino acid that is required for optimal activity of the protein. The genotypes and sources of the mutant and wild type yeast strains used in the present study are listed in Table I. Chemically induced mutations were obtained as described (24Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast was grown in the following media: YPD (2% glucose, 2% peptone, 1% yeast extract), YPGal (2% galactose, 2% peptone, 1% yeast extract), YEPG (3% glycerol, 2% ethanol, 2% peptone, 1% yeast extract), WO (2% glucose, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco)). Amino acids and other growth requirements were added at a final concentration of 20 μg/ml. The solid media contained 2% agar in addition to the components described above.

The underlined bases differ from the original sequence of the plasmid. Open table in a new tab The plasmids used in this study are described in Table III. Atp12p is numbered from 1 to 325, where residue 1 is the initiator methionine in the primary translation product (18Bowman S. Ackerman S.H. Griffiths D.E. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7517-7523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In cases where sequences were removed from the 3′ end of the ATP12 gene, the plasmids and the encoded products are named according to where the mutant protein is truncated. This is indicated by the single-letter code and number (18Bowman S. Ackerman S.H. Griffiths D.E. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7517-7523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the last retained amino acid. For mutant proteins that have deletions from the amino terminus, the plasmids and the encoded products are designated by the Δ symbol, followed by the span of ATP12 codons removed. The number of amino acids that are deleted from the carboxyl or the mature amino terminus of the mutant Atp12p proteins is indicated in Table III. In naming the plasmids coding for mutant Atp12p proteins harboring missense mutations, the single-letter code is used to indicate the amino acid substitution at the designated position in the Atp12p primary structure (18Bowman S. Ackerman S.H. Griffiths D.E. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7517-7523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The details of the plasmid constructions are provided in 3Wild type Atp12p is encoded in the multi-copy (2 μ) plasmid, pG57/ST4 (constructed as described in Ref. 18Bowman S. Ackerman S.H. Griffiths D.E. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7517-7523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids coding for Atp12p deleted for sequences from the carboxyl terminus are described as follows. Atp12(V306)p is encoded by pG57/V306. This plasmid carries a 1.0-kb SstI-HincII fragment of DNA that was prepared from pG57/ST4 and ligated to the 2-μ vector, YEp352 (25Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar), after the vector was opened with EcoRI, made blunt-ended with Klenow, and then digested with SstI. Atp12(V283)p is coded for in pG57/V283. For this plasmid construction, a 1.0-kb SstI-RsaI fragment was purified from pG57/ST4 and ligated to YEp352, which was prepared by first digesting with XbaI, filling in the site with Klenow, and then cutting with SstI. Atp12(P239)p is encoded by pG57/P239. For this construction, a plasmid carrying the atp12-8 nonsense allele cloned from yeast strain P366 was opened with SstI, and the 3′ end was made blunt using T4 DNA polymerase and Klenow. The resultant DNA was digested with BglII (this restriction site is upstream from the nonsense mutation in the mutantatp12-8 allele). Klenow was then used to blunt the BglII restriction site, after which the double blunt-ended DNA fragment was self-ligated to produce plasmid pG57/P239. Plasmids coding for Atp12p proteins deleted for sequences from the amino terminus are described as follows. In all of these plasmids, the 5′-truncated ATP12 coding sequences are ligated in-frame with DNA coding for the mitochondrial targeting sequence of Atp11p (amino acids 1–39, see Ref. 21White M. Ackerman S.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). As the first step, a plasmid (pG13L) was constructed with the coding sequence for the Atp11p leader peptide. To make pG13L, a 340-bp SstI-SmaI DNA fragment was prepared from the plasmid pG13Δ40–75s (27Wang Z.-G. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4887-4894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and ligated to YEp352 that was cut with the same restriction enzymes. Atp12(Δ1–81)p is encoded by pG57Δ1–81. For this construction, a 1.0-kb DNA fragment was purified from pG57/ST4 after cutting the plasmid withBfaI, filling in the site with Klenow, and digesting withHindIII. The linear DNA fragment was then ligated to YEp352, which was prepared by opening at the BamHI site, blunt-ending the vector with Klenow, and cutting withHindIII. The resultant plasmid was used to prepare a 1.0-kbSmaI-HindIII fragment, which was then ligated to pG13L that was digested with the same enzymes to produce pG57Δ1–81. There are two amino acid residues (Gly and Asp) encoded at the junction between the ATP11 and ATP12 sequences in pG57Δ1–81 that results from the addition of the sequence, GGGGAT, during construction of this plasmid. Atp12(Δ1–124)p is coded for in pG57Δ1–124. To make this plasmid, an 896-bpNsiI-HindIII fragment prepared from pG57/ST4 was ligated to PstI, HindIII-cut pG13L. There are seven codons (Gly-Asp-Pro-Leu-Glu-Ser-Thr) inserted in between the ATP11 and ATP12 sequences in pG57Δ1–124 due to the addition of the sequence, GGGGATCCTCTAGAGTCGACC, during the construction of this plasmid. Atp12(Δ1–180)p is encoded by pG57Δ1–180. For this plasmid construction, a 730-bpFspI-HindIII DNA fragment was purified from pG57Δ1–124 and ligated to HincII, HindIII-cut pUC18. The resultant plasmid was used to prepare a 740-bpSmaI-HindIII fragment, which was then ligated toSmaI, HindIII-cut pG13L to produce pG57Δ1–180. There are six amino acids (Gly-Asp-Pro-Leu-Glu-Ser) encoded at the junction between the ATP11 and ATP12 sequences in pG57Δ1–180 that result from adding the sequence, GGGGATCCTCTAGAGTCG, during this plasmid construction. Atp12(Δ1–224)p is coded for in pG57Δ1–224. To make this plasmid, a 600-bpEcoRV-HindIII DNA fragment was purified from pG57/ST4 and ligated to SmaI, HindIII-cut pG13L. The construction of plasmids that code for Atp12p proteins harboring missense mutations is described as follows. Plasmid pG57/E289K encodes Atp12(E289K)p. This plasmid carries the atp12–5 missense allele that was cloned (using PCR) from the mutant strain E822 and ligated in the BamHI, SstI sites of YEp352. The multi-copy plasmids encoding the Atp12(E289D)p, Atp12(E289A)p, and Atp12(E289Q)p proteins were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis. As part of this work, an 880-bp SstI-Sau3AI fragment was purified from pG57/ST4 and ligated toSstI, BamHI-cut YEp352 to produce plasmid pG57/Sau, which codes for the amino three-fourths of Atp12p. The site-directed changes were made using PCR with plasmid pG57/ST4 as the DNA template. For the E289A mutation, primers 20 and 17 (Table II) were used to make a 141-bp product, which was then cut with BglII and NheI, and primers 12 and 14 (Table II) were used to produce a 169-bp PCR that was subsequently digested withHindIII and NheI. The two PCR products were ligated to BamHI, HindIII-cut pG57/Sau to give plasmid pG57/pE289A. Similar strategies were used to create the pG57/E289D and pG57/E289Q plasmids. To make pG57/E289D, primers 20 and 18 (Table II) were used for synthesis of the 141-bp PCR product, which was digested with BglII and XbaI, and primers 12 and 15 (Table II) were used to make the 169-bp PCR product, which was cut using HindIII and XbaI. For pG57/E289Q, the 141-bp PCR product was obtained using primers 20 and 19 (Table II) and then cut using BglII and PstI, and the 164-bp PCR product was synthesized using primers 12 and 16 (Table II) and subsequently digested with HindIII and PstI. Three-piece ligations were then done to put the appropriate pairs of 141- and 169-bp PCR products into the BamHI and HindIII sites of pG57/Sau yielding pG57/E289D and pG57/E289Q. YHistag-Atp12p is the name for the Histag-Atp12p protein that is produced in yeast and is encoded in plasmid pG57/ST21. This protein utilizes the Atp11p mitochondrial leader sequence as the targeting signal for the mature Atp12p protein that is tagged with a (6x)histidine sequence at the amino terminus. To make this plasmid, the primers 11 and 13 (Table II) were used for PCR with the bacterial plasmid pHISATP12 (this plasmid is described under “Materials and Methods”) as the DNA template. The 1.0-kb PCR product was digested with SmaI and BamHI and added to a three-piece ligation with a 340-bp SstI-SmaI fragment purified from pG13Δ40–75s (27Wang Z.-G. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4887-4894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and SstI, BamHI-cut YEp352 to produce pG57/ST21. The construction of ATP12 plasmids with vectors of the yeast two-hybrid system is described as follows. Plasmids pG57/ST22 and pG57/ST23 code for Histag-Atp12p in, respectively, the pAS2-1 and pACT-2 vectors purchased from CLONTECH. For these constructions, a 1-kb SmaI-BamHI fragment was purified from pG57/ST21 and ligated either to pAS2-1 or pACT-2, each of which was prepared by first digesting with NcoI, blunt-ending with Klenow, and digesting with BamHI.. All of the plasmids whose construction utilized PCR (p657/E289D, p657/E289A, pG57/E289Q, pG57/ST21) were sequenced to verify that there were no artificial mutations introduced in the ATP12 coding region due to errors made by the Taq polymerase.Table IIIAtp12 yeast plasmids and encoded proteinsPlasmid3-aWith the exception of pG57/ST4 (Ref. 18), the present study is the source for all of the plasmids.

Fukuhara H. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 88: 185-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) was used to prepare mitochondria with the exception that Zymolyase, instead of Glusulase, was used to digest the cell wall. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) was added to 10 μg/ml final concentration during the cell-breaking step to minimize proteolysis. Two different methods, both of which give comparable results, were used to prepare mitochondrial extracts containing solubilized Atp12p. For some experiments, mitochondria were suspended at 10 mg/ml in 10 mm T"
