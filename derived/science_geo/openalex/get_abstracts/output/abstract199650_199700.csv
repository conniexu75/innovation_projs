https://openalex.org/W2078183706,"The inclusion of tritium-labeled thymidine of various concentrations in the tissue culture medium in which HeLa cells were grown resulted in inhibition of growth, except where carrier thymidine was added. The fact that added thymidine reversed the action of the tritiumlabeled material was interpreted as demonstrating that the inhibition was the result of intracellular incorporation of tritium and not some toxic contaminant. Implications of the findings in studies using tritium-labeled compounds are discussed. (C.H.)"

https://openalex.org/W2006873089,"IT was observed that in young broth cultures, Streptococcus faecalis (enterococcus) grows in marked chains which later break up rather abruptly; the chains can be maintained by spinning young cultures and resuspending the cells in fresh medium. It was further found that many unrelated compounds are capable to a greater or lesser degree of inducing chain formation in enterococci, the most active being detergents, suramin and crystal and gentian violet; bile1 was moderately active. In the presence of these compounds enterococci grow rough, with a clear supernatant and a heavy granular deposit consisting of long, tangled chains. On transfer to ordinary media the organisms revert to the typical, smooth, diffuse type of growth with little sediment—singles, pairs and short chains predominating."

1, A
2 and A
3) and more recently the discovery3 of gibberellin A
4, numerous physiological responses have been induced in plants4 with the gibberellins. Takahashi et al.
2 reported that A
1, A
2 and A
3 all possessed strong physiological activities in stimulating the elongation of rice seedlings. Apart from this reference, the gibberellins have not been evaluated in terms of specific biological activities. The comparative effectiveness of gibberellins A
1, A
2, A
3 and A
4 and the methyl esters of A
1 and A
3 in promoting vegetative extension, flowering of facultative long-day annuals and in fruit setting is now reported5."

The gamma-ray spectrum emitted by present-day surface soil reveals the presence of radioactive fission products from fall-out. Individual fission zed. Counting methods are described. (C.H.)

https://openalex.org/W2019011093,"A prediction is made of the efiects of future nuclear weapons tests on the environment of man. For the sake of exrapolating into the future, three possible courses are considered. These include: testing will continue at its present rates testing wiil close and oniy the residual radioaotive burden in the stratosphere need be considereds and the rate of testing will continue to increase at the average rate at which it has increased since 1951. Expressions for the accumulated activities corresponding to these three assumptions are derived, and equations are presented as a basis for the calculated radiation dosages. (C.H.)"

With the aid of urease the ammonia evolved was detected with Feigl's reagent2. This reagent (silver manganese nitrate solution) appears to be rather more sensitive to ammonia than is Nessler's reagent (alkaline potassium-mercuri-iodide solution), having its lower limit of detection in the order of 0.5 µgm. ammonia. Using Feigl's reagent and a filter paper spot test technique we have devised a rapid and economic method of determining the concentration of urea in 5–20 µl. of biological fluid."
