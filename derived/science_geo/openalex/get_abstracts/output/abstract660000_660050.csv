https://openalex.org/W3087402740,"The future trajectory of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic hinges on the dynamics of adaptive immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); however, salient features of the immune response elicited by natural infection or vaccination are still uncertain. We use simple epidemiological models to explore estimates for the magnitude and timing of future COVID-19 cases, given different assumptions regarding the protective efficacy and duration of the adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2, as well as its interaction with vaccines and nonpharmaceutical interventions. We find that variations in the immune response to primary SARS-CoV-2 infections and a potential vaccine can lead to markedly different immune landscapes and burdens of critically severe cases, ranging from sustained epidemics to near elimination. Our findings illustrate likely complexities in future COVID-19 dynamics and highlight the importance of immunological characterization beyond the measurement of active infections for adequately projecting the immune landscape generated by SARS-CoV-2 infections."

https://openalex.org/W3087056597,"Understanding how genes, drugs and neural circuits influence behavior requires the ability to effectively organize information about similarities and differences within complex behavioral datasets. Motion Sequencing (MoSeq) is an ethologically inspired behavioral analysis method that identifies modular components of three-dimensional mouse body language called ‘syllables’. Here, we show that MoSeq effectively parses behavioral differences and captures similarities elicited by a panel of neuroactive and psychoactive drugs administered to a cohort of nearly 700 mice. MoSeq identifies syllables that are characteristic of individual drugs, a finding we leverage to reveal specific on- and off-target effects of both established and candidate therapeutics in a mouse model of autism spectrum disorder. These results demonstrate that MoSeq can meaningfully organize large-scale behavioral data, illustrate the power of a fundamentally modular description of behavior and suggest that behavioral syllables represent a new class of druggable target. By analyzing hundreds of mice treated with a library of neuro- and psychoactive drugs, Wiltschko et al. show that Motion Sequencing can effectively discriminate and categorize drug effects and link molecular targets to behavioral syllables."

https://openalex.org/W3087265072,"Distal enhancers play pivotal roles in development and disease yet remain one of the least understood regulatory elements. We used massively parallel reporter assays to perform functional comparisons of two leading enhancer models and find that gene-distal transcription start sites are robust predictors of active enhancers with higher resolution than histone modifications. We show that active enhancer units are precisely delineated by active transcription start sites, validate that these boundaries are sufficient for capturing enhancer function, and confirm that core promoter sequences are necessary for this activity. We assay adjacent enhancers and find that their joint activity is often driven by the stronger unit within the cluster. Finally, we validate these results through functional dissection of a distal enhancer cluster using CRISPR-Cas9 deletions. In summary, definition of high-resolution enhancer boundaries enables deconvolution of complex regulatory loci into modular units."
https://openalex.org/W3088913583,"Objective To evaluate the effects of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis HN019 (HN019) on clinical periodontal parameters (plaque accumulation and gingival bleeding), on immunocompetence of gingival tissues [expression of beta-defensin (BD)-3, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), cluster of differentiation(CD)-57 and CD-4], and on immunological properties of saliva (IgA levels) in non-surgical periodontal therapy in generalized chronic periodontitis (GCP) patients. Adhesion to buccal epithelial cells (BEC) and the antimicrobial properties of HN019 were also investigated. Materials and methods Thirty patients were recruited and monitored clinically at baseline (before scaling and root planing—SRP) and after 30 and 90 days. Patients were randomly assigned to Test (SRP+Probiotic, n = 15) or Control (SRP+Placebo, n = 15) group. Probiotic lozenges were used for 30 days. Gingival tissues and saliva were immunologically analyzed. The adhesion of HN019 with or without Porphyromonas gingivalis in BEC and its antimicrobial properties were investigated in in vitro assays. Data were statistically analyzed (p<0.05). Results Test group presented lower plaque index (30 days) and lower marginal gingival bleeding (90 days) when compared with Control group. Higher BD-3, TLR4 and CD-4 expressions were observed in gingival tissues in Test group than in Control group. HN019 reduced the adhesion of P. gingivalis to BEC and showed antimicrobial potential against periodontopathogens. Conclusion Immunological and antimicrobial properties of B. lactis HN019 make it a potential probiotic to be used in non-surgical periodontal therapy of patients with GCP. Clinical relevance B. lactis HN019 may be a potential probiotic to improve the effects of non-surgical periodontal therapy. Name of the registry and registration number (ClinicalTrials.gov): “Effects of probiotic therapy in the treatment of periodontitis”—NCT03408548."
https://openalex.org/W3087460446,"Lipids play crucial roles as structural elements, signaling molecules and material transporters in cells. However, the functions and dynamics of lipids within cells remain unclear because of a lack of methods to selectively label lipids in specific organelles and trace their movement by live-cell imaging. We describe here a technology for the selective labeling and fluorescence imaging (microscopic or nanoscopic) of phosphatidylcholine in target organelles. This approach involves the metabolic incorporation of azido-choline, followed by a spatially limited bioorthogonal reaction that enables the visualization and quantitative analysis of interorganelle lipid transport in live cells. More importantly, with live-cell imaging, we obtained direct evidence that the autophagosomal membrane originates from the endoplasmic reticulum. This method is simple and robust and is thus powerful for real-time tracing of interorganelle lipid trafficking."

https://openalex.org/W3087259774,"Activation of nociceptor sensory neurons by noxious stimuli both triggers pain and increases capillary permeability and blood flow to produce neurogenic inflammation1,2, but whether nociceptors also interact with the immune system remains poorly understood. Here we report a neurotechnology for selective epineural optogenetic neuromodulation of nociceptors and demonstrate that nociceptor activation drives both protective pain behavior and inflammation. The wireless optoelectronic system consists of sub-millimeter-scale light-emitting diodes embedded in a soft, circumneural sciatic nerve implant, powered and driven by a miniaturized head-mounted control unit. Photostimulation of axons in freely moving mice that express channelrhodopsin only in nociceptors resulted in behaviors characteristic of pain, reflecting orthodromic input to the spinal cord. It also led to immune reactions in the skin in the absence of inflammation and potentiation of established inflammation, a consequence of the antidromic activation of nociceptor peripheral terminals. These results reveal a link between nociceptors and immune cells, which might have implications for the treatment of inflammation. An optogenetic study shows that activation of pain-triggering sensory neurons induces an immune response."
https://openalex.org/W3087754470,"The contribution of ribosome heterogeneity and ribosome-associated proteins to the molecular control of proteomes in health and disease remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that survival motor neuron (SMN) protein-the loss of which causes the neuromuscular disease spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)-binds to ribosomes and that this interaction is tissue-dependent. SMN-primed ribosomes are preferentially positioned within the first five codons of a set of mRNAs that are enriched for translational enhancer sequences in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) and rare codons at the beginning of their coding sequence. These SMN-specific mRNAs are associated with neurogenesis, lipid metabolism, ubiquitination, chromatin regulation and translation. Loss of SMN induces ribosome depletion, especially at the beginning of the coding sequence of SMN-specific mRNAs, leading to impairment of proteins that are involved in motor neuron function and stability, including acetylcholinesterase. Thus, SMN plays a crucial role in the regulation of ribosome fluxes along mRNAs encoding proteins that are relevant to SMA pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3087481519,"Infection rates, severity, and fatalities due to COVID-19, the pandemic mediated by SARS-CoV-2, vary greatly between countries. With few exceptions, these are lower in East and Southeast Asian and Sub-Saharan African countries compared with other regions. Epidemiological differences may reflect differences in border closures, lockdowns, and social distancing measures taken by each county, and by cultural differences, such as common use of face masks in East and Southeast Asian countries. The plasma serine protease inhibitor alpha-1 antitrypsin was suggested to protect from COVID-19 by inhibiting TMPRSS2, a cell surface serine protease essential for the SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. Here, we present evidence that population differences in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency allele frequencies may partially explain national differences in the COVID-19 epidemiology. Our study compared reported national estimates for the major alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency alleles PiZ and PiS (SERPINA1 rs28929474 and rs17580, respectively) with the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center dataset. We found a significant positive correlation (R = .54, P = 1.98e-6) between the combined frequencies of the alpha-1 antitrypsin PiZ and PiS deficiency alleles in 67 countries and their reported COVID-19 mortality rates. Our observations suggest that alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency alleles may contribute to national differences in COVID-19 infection, severity, and mortality rates. Population-wide screening for carriers of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency alleles should be considered for prioritizing individuals for stricter social distancing measures and for receiving a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine once it becomes available."
https://openalex.org/W3087563181,"Stem cells need to be protected from genotoxic and proteotoxic stress to maintain a healthy pool throughout life1–3. Little is known about the proteostasis mechanism that safeguards stem cells. Here we report endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) as a protein quality checkpoint that controls the haematopoietic stem cell (HSC)–niche interaction and determines the fate of HSCs. The SEL1L–HRD1 complex, the most conserved branch of ERAD4, is highly expressed in HSCs. Deletion of Sel1l led to niche displacement of HSCs and a complete loss of HSC identity, and allowed highly efficient donor-HSC engraftment without irradiation. Mechanistic studies identified MPL, the master regulator of HSC identity5, as a bona fide ERAD substrate that became aggregated in the endoplasmic reticulum following ERAD deficiency. Restoration of MPL signalling with an agonist partially rescued the number and reconstitution capacity of Sel1l-deficient HSCs. Our study defines ERAD as an essential proteostasis mechanism to safeguard a healthy stem cell pool by regulating the stem cell–niche interaction. Xu, Liu, Pen, Zhang et al. demonstrate that the SEL1L–HRD1 complex, which is part of the ERAD protein quality control machinery, safeguards haematopoietic stem cell identity and niche location by ensuring the haematopoietic stem cell surface expression of MPL."
https://openalex.org/W3087133021,"Lipid perturbations contribute to detrimental outcomes in obesity. We previously demonstrated that nervonic acid, a C24:1 ω-9 fatty acid, predominantly acylated to sphingolipids, including ceramides, are selectively reduced in a mouse model of obesity. It is currently unknown if deficiency of nervonic acid-sphingolipid metabolites contribute to complications of obesity. Mice were fed a standard diet, a high fat diet, or these diets supplemented isocalorically with nervonic acid. The primary objective was to determine if dietary nervonic acid content alters the metabolic phenotype in mice fed a high fat diet. Furthermore, we investigated if nervonic acid alters markers of impaired fatty acid oxidation in the liver. We observed that a nervonic acid-enriched isocaloric diet reduced weight gain and adiposity in mice fed a high fat diet. The nervonic acid enrichment led to increased C24:1-ceramides and improved several metabolic parameters including blood glucose levels, and insulin and glucose tolerance. Mechanistically, nervonic acid supplementation increased PPARα and PGC1α expression and improved the acylcarnitine profile in liver. These alterations indicate improved energy metabolism through increased β-oxidation of fatty acids. Taken together, increasing dietary nervonic acid improves metabolic parameters in mice fed a high fat diet. Strategies that prevent deficiency of, or restore, nervonic acid may represent an effective strategy to treat obesity and obesity-related complications."
https://openalex.org/W3087666022,"Although there are many virtual reality (VR) applications in sports, only a handful of studies visualized the whole body. There is still a lack of understanding, how much of the own body must be visualized in the head-mounted display (HMD) based VR, to ensure fidelity and similar performance outcome as in the real-world. In the current study, 20 young and healthy participants completed three tasks in a real and virtual environment: balance task, grasping task, and throwing task with a ball. The aim was to find out the meaning of the visualization of different body parts for the quality of movement execution and to derive future guidelines for virtual body presentation. In addition, a comparison of human performance between reality and VR, with whole-body visualization was made. Focusing on the main goal of the current study, there were differences within the measured parameters due to the visualization of different body parts. In the balance task, the differences within the VR body visualization consisted mainly through no-body visualization (NB) compared to the other visualization types defined as whole-body (WB), WB except feet (NF), as well as WB except feet and legs (NLF). In the grasping task, the different body visualization seemed to have no impact on the participants' performances. In the throwing task, the whole-body visualization led to higher accuracy compared to the other visualization types. Regarding the comparison between the conditions, we found significant differences between reality and VR, which had a large effect on the parameters time for completion in the balance and grasping task, the number of foot strikes on the beam in the balance task, as well as the subjective estimation of the difficulty for all tasks. However, the number of errors and the quality of the performances did not differ significantly. The current study was the first study comparing sports-related tasks in VR and reality with further manipulations (occlusions of body parts) of the virtual body. For studies analyzing perception and sports performance or for VR sports interventions, we recommend the visualization of the whole body in real-time."
https://openalex.org/W3087028553,"Palmitoylation, the modification of proteins with the lipid palmitate, is a key regulator of protein targeting and trafficking. However, knowledge of the roles of specific palmitoyl acyltransferases (PATs), which catalyze palmitoylation, is incomplete. For example, little is known about which PATs are present in neuronal axons, although long-distance trafficking of palmitoyl-proteins is important for axon integrity and for axon-to-soma retrograde signaling, a process critical for axon development and for responses to injury. Identifying axonally targeted PATs might thus provide insights into multiple aspects of axonal biology. We therefore comprehensively determined the subcellular distribution of mammalian PATs in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and, strikingly, found that only two PATs, ZDHHC5 and ZDHHC8, were enriched in DRG axons. Signals via the Gp130/JAK/STAT3 and DLK/JNK pathways are important for axonal injury responses, and we found that ZDHHC5 and ZDHHC8 were required for Gp130/JAK/STAT3, but not DLK/JNK, axon-to-soma signaling. ZDHHC5 and ZDHHC8 robustly palmitoylated Gp130 in cotransfected nonneuronal cells, supporting the possibility that Gp130 is a direct ZDHHC5/8 substrate. In DRG neurons, Zdhhc5/8 shRNA knockdown reduced Gp130 palmitoylation and even more markedly reduced Gp130 surface expression, potentially explaining the importance of these PATs for Gp130-dependent signaling. Together, these findings provide new insights into the subcellular distribution and roles of specific PATs and reveal a novel mechanism by which palmitoylation controls axonal retrograde signaling.

Prominent among these potentially palmitoylated proteins is Gp130 (gene name IL6ST), an obligate component of receptor signaling complexes for the neuropoietic cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), and oncostatin-M (OSM) (34Bauer S.

However, whether Gp130 is endogenously palmitoylated in DRG neurons has not been reported, and whether a specific PAT(s) is important for Gp130/JAK/STAT3 signaling is unknown. Here, we determined the distribution of mammalian PATs in axons of mammalian DRG sensory neurons, a cell type that has provided key insights into neurodevelopment and mechanisms of neurodegeneration (23Harrington A.W.

Only two of the 23 PATs, the closely related ZDHHC5 and ZDHHC8, were enriched in DRG axons. We assessed the functional importance of ZDHHC5/8 and found that these PATs are required for Gp130-dependent, but not DLK-dependent, axonal retrograde signaling. Consistent with this requirement, we found that Gp130 is indeed highly palmitoylated and is an excellent ZDHHC5/8 substrate in transfected cells. In DRG neurons, Zdhhc5/8 knockdown reduced Gp130 palmitoylation and even more markedly reduced surface levels of Gp130, plausibly explaining why these two PATs are critical for Gp130-dependent signaling. Together, these findings identify the first axonally enriched PATs and provide new insights into the control of axonal retrograde signaling. The distribution of PAT enzymes in PNS neurons is essentially unknown. We therefore first sought to comprehensively determine the distribution of mammalian PATs in primary cultured DRG neurons, a widely used PNS cell type that is highly relevant for studies of neurodevelopment and nerve injury (38Lerch J.K.

In parallel work, we have found that one of these PATs, ZDHHC17, is restricted to the soma of DRG neurons (43Niu J. Sanders S.S. Jeong H.J. Holland S.M. Sun Y. Collura K.M. Hernandez L. Huang H. Hayden M.R. Smith G.M. Hu Y. Jin Y. Thomas G.M.

However, we were particularly interested in whether specific PATs might localize to DRG axons. We therefore expressed N-terminally HA-tagged forms of the remaining ZDHHC-PATs in primary DRG neurons, using lentiviral delivery to keep levels of exogenously expressed PATs low and thus minimize potential artifacts due to overexpression. All HA-tagged PATs were detected immunocytochemically when virally infected (Fig. 1A). Strikingly, we found that axonal enrichment of two PATs, ZDHHC5 and its close homolog ZDHHC8 (2Fukata Y. Fukata M. Protein palmitoylation in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 11 (20168314): 161-17510.1038/nrn2788Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), was significantly greater than that of all other PATs examined (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast to ZDHHC5 and ZDHHC8, all other PATs were detected at higher levels in DRG neuronal cell bodies than in axons, when compared with a freely soluble marker, GFP (Fig. 1, A and B). Of these somatically enriched PATs, several (ZDHHC3, ZDHHC7, ZDHHC9, ZDHHC11, ZDHHC12, ZDHHC13, ZDHHC14, ZDHHC15, ZDHHC16, ZDHHC21, and ZDHHC23) displayed a discrete perinuclear appearance that overlapped with the Golgi marker GM130 (Fig. S1). Line-scan analysis confirmed co-localization of each of these PATs with GM130, further supporting the hypothesis that this subset of PATs is Golgi-localized (Fig. S1). Several of the remaining PATs that were not enriched in axons (ZDHHC2, ZDHHC4, ZDHHC6, ZDHHC18, ZDHHC19, and ZDHHC25; Fig. 1A) displayed a more reticular appearance in DRG neuronal cell bodies. Two of these PATs (ZDHHC4 and ZDHHC6) are reported to localize to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in other cell types (44Gorleku O.A. Barns A.M. Prescott G.R. Greaves J. Chamberlain L.H.

In these viral expression experiments, the most heavily enriched axonal PAT was ZDHHC5. Using an antibody whose specificity we had confirmed in other neuron types (7Thomas G.M. Hayashi T. Chiu S.L. Chen C.M. Huganir R.L.

On Western blots, the ZDHHC5 antibody detected a band of the predicted molecular weight of ZDHHC5 in whole-cell lysates from WT DRG neurons infected with a control lentivirus (Fig. 2A). This band was almost completely eliminated in lysates from neurons infected with lentivirus expressing an shRNA that knocks down ZDHHC5 (7Thomas G.M. Hayashi T. Chiu S.L. Chen C.M. Huganir R.L.

Two proteins known to be present in axons, growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43) and tubulin, were strongly detected in these distal axonal fractions, but histone H3, a nuclear marker, was not (Fig. 2B). When used in immunocytochemical studies, the ZDHHC5 antibody detected a robust signal in DRG axons that was again greatly reduced by Zdhhc5 shRNA knockdown (Fig. 2C; quantified in Fig. S2B). Together, these data suggest that endogenous and exogenously expressed forms of ZDHHC5 localize to axons of DRG neurons. We next used microfluidic cultures of DRG neurons to address potential functional roles for ZDHHC5/8 in axonal retrograde signaling. One major retrograde signaling pathway with an important role in DRG neurons involves the kinase DLK, which triggers phosphorylation of the transcription factor c-Jun, via DLK's “downstream” target c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). DLK is palmitoylated, and we previously reported a requirement for DLK palmitoylation in retrograde signaling following axotomy (28Holland S.M. Collura K.M. Ketschek A. Noma K. Ferguson T.A. Jin Y. Gallo G. Thomas G.M. Palmitoylation controls DLK localization, interactions and activity to ensure effective axonal injury signaling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recent studies have shown that AhR is a novel master regulator of the mucosal immune system, including lungs and intestine. To elucidate the role of AhR in chronic severe asthma, AhR wild-type and knockout mice (AhR-/- ) were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin for 4 weeks. To uncover the underlying mechanisms, inflammatory cells profile and cytokines production were analyzed in bronchial lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue. Compared to wild-type mice, AhR-/- mice had exacerbated asthma symptoms, including airway inflammation, mucus production, airway hyperresponsiveness, and airway remodeling. BALF monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes were all enhanced in OVA-immunized AhR-/- mice. In OVA-immunized AhR-/- mice, T helper (Th) 17 cell-specific cytokine IL-17A, as well as airway remodeling factors, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), were all enhanced in lung tissue. Moreover, human cohort studies showed that AhR gene expression in bronchial epithelial cells decreases in severe asthma patients. Loss of AhR leads to worsening of allergic asthma symptoms, indicating its importance in maintaining normal lung function and mediating disease severity."
https://openalex.org/W3046101522,"Drug delivery across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) remains a significant obstacle for the development of neurological disease therapies. The low penetration of blood-borne therapeutics into the brain can oftentimes be attributed to the restrictive nature of the brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) that comprise the BBB. One strategy beginning to be successfully leveraged is the use of endogenous receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT) systems as a means to shuttle a targeted therapeutic into the brain. Limitations of known RMT targets and their cognate targeting reagents include brain specificity, brain uptake levels, and off-target effects, driving the search for new and potentially improved brain targeting reagent-RMT pairs. To this end, we deployed human-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived BMEC-like cells as a model BBB substrate on which to mine for new RMT-targeting antibody pairs. A nonimmune, human single-chain variable fragment (scFv) phage display library was screened for binding, internalization, and transcytosis across iPSC-derived BMECs. Lead candidates exhibited binding and internalization into BMECs as well as binding to both human and mouse BBB in brain tissue sections. Antibodies targeted the murine BBB after intravenous administration with one particular clone, 46.1-scFv, exhibiting a 26-fold increase in brain accumulation (8.1 nM). Moreover, clone 46.1-scFv was found to associate with postvascular, parenchymal cells, indicating its successful receptor-mediated transport across the BBB. Such a new BBB targeting ligand could enhance the transport of therapeutic molecules into the brain."
https://openalex.org/W3087178626,"Introduction Suicide rates in India are among the highest in the world, equating to over 200,000 suicide deaths annually. Crime reports of suicide incidents routinely feature in the Indian mass media, with minimal coverage of suicide as a broader public health issue. To supplement our recently published content analysis study, we undertook qualitative interviews to examine media professionals' perspectives and experiences in relation to media reporting of suicide-related news in India. Materials and methods In 2017–18, semi-structured qualitative interviews with twenty-eight print media and television media professionals with experience reporting on suicide-related news were undertaken across north (New Delhi and Chandigarh) and south (Chennai) India. A semi-structured interview guide was designed to initiate discussions around; 1) perspectives on why suicide incidents are regularly reported on by mass media in India, 2) a description of experiences and processes of covering suicide incidents on the crime beat; and 3) perspectives on the emergence of health reporter coverage of suicide. Interviews were digitally audio-recorded and transcribed. A deductive and inductive thematic analytic approach was used, supported by the use of NVivo. Results Suicides were typically seen as being highly newsworthy and of interest to the audience, particularly the suicides of high-status people and those who somewhat matched the middle-class profile of the core audience. Socio-cultural factors played a major role in determining the newsworthiness of a particular incident. The capacity to link a suicide incident to compelling social narratives, potentially detrimental social/policy issues, and placing the suicide as a form of protest/martyrdom increased newsworthiness. Reporters on the crime beat worked in close partnership with police to produce routine and simplified incident report-style coverage of suicide incidents, with the process influenced by: informal police contacts supporting the crime beat, the speed of breaking news, extremely tight word limits and a deeply fraught engagement with bereaved family members. It was articulated that a public health and/or mental health framing of suicide was an emerging perspective, which sought to focus more on broader trends and suicide prevention programs rather than individual incidents. Important challenges were identified around the complexity of adopting a mental health framing of suicide, given the perceived pervasive influence of socioeconomic and cultural issues (rather than individual psychopathology) on suicide in India. Conclusions Our findings delve into the complexity of reporting on suicide in India and can be used to support constructive partnerships between media professionals and suicide prevention experts in India. Policymakers need to acknowledge the socio-cultural context of suicide reporting in India when adapting international guidelines for the Indian media."

To understand the developmental and genetic mechanisms by which such organs develop, it is critical to first investigate the morphology and developmental timing of these structures during the onset of host development. We utilized micro-computed tomography (μCT) to describe the morphology and development of mycangia, a specialized organ, in the Asian ambrosia beetle species Euwallacea validus which maintains a mutualistic relationship with the Ascomycete fungus, Fusarium oligoseptatum. We scanned animals in larval, pupal and adult life stages and identified that mycangia develop during the late pupal stage. Here we reconcile preliminary evidence and provide additional morphological data for a second paired set of structures, including the superior, medial mycangia and an inferior, lateral pair of pouch-like structures, in both late-stage pupae and adult female beetles. Furthermore, we report the possible development of rudimentary, or partially developed pairs of medial mycangia in adult male beetles which has never been reported for any male Xyleborini. Our results illustrate the validity of μCT in observing soft tissues and the complex nature of mycangia morphology and development."

The TBHC was based on motivational interviewing, goal setting, and shared decision-making and carried out by trained nurses. All outcomes were assessed yearly for three years.

All models were adjusted for age, education and campaign affiliation. Results Of the 10,815 invited patients, 4,283 returned their questionnaires at baseline. The mean age was 67.23 years (SD = 9.3); 55.5% were female. According to the model, TBHC was statistically significant superior to CG regarding 6 of 19 outcomes: physical activity in hours per week (p = .030) and in metabolic rate per week (p = .048), BMI (p = .009) (although mainly at baseline), measuring blood pressure (p< .001), patient activation (p< .001), and health literacy (p< .001). Regarding stages of change (p = .005), the IG group also showed statistically different results than the CG group, however the conclusion remains inconclusive. Within-group contrasts indicating changes from baseline to follow-ups and significant between-group comparisons regarding these changes supported the findings. Standardized effect sizes were small. TBHC did not show any effect on mental QoL, health status, alcohol, smoking, adherence, measuring blood sugar, foot monitoring, anxiety, depression and distress. Campaign-specific subgroup effects were detected for ‘foot monitoring by a physician’ and ‘blood sugar measurement’. Conclusion TBHC interventions might have small effects on some patient reported and behavioral outcomes. Practice implications Future research should focus on analyzing which intervention components are effective and who profits most from TBHC interventions.

Herein, we determined the proportion of children with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) who achieved complete remission with steroid therapy and identified factors associated with complete remission.We reviewed the medical records of 241 children with INS in two centres in Lagos from 2010 to 2019. We extracted demographic data, clinical features, laboratory values at the time of diagnosis, and receipt and response to steroids and other immunosuppressants.The median (interquartile range) age at diagnosis of INS was 5.1 (3.0-8.7) years and boys were 60.2% of the study population. Children with SSNS made up 85.9% (n = 207) of the study cohort. Among those aged 0-5 years, 92.6%were SSNS compared with 69.2% in those aged 11-17 years at the time of diagnosis. In addition, the proportion of children with SSNS increased from 73.8% between year 2010 and 2012 to 88.4% afterwards. Also, children with SSNS had lower serum creatinine (0.44 vs 0.70; p<0.001) and higher estimated glomerular filtration rate (101 vs 74.3 ml/min/1.73 m2; p = 0.008) at the time of diagnosis than those with steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS).Among Black children in Lagos, the proportion with SSNS is comparable to proportions described in children of Asian and European descent. Furthermore, children with SSNS had lower serum creatinine and higher glomerular filtration rate than those with SRNS."
https://openalex.org/W3087054820,"Allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from young and healthy donors are reported to hold the potential to treat several immunological and degenerative disorders. However, recent data from animal studies and clinical trials demonstrate that immunogenicity and poor survival of transplanted MSCs impaired the efficacy of cells for regenerative applications. It is reported that initially immunoprivileged under in vitro conditions, MSCs are targeted by the host immune system after transplantation in the ischemic tissues in vivo. We performed in vitro (in MSCs) and in vivo (in the rat model of myocardial infarction [MI]) studies to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the change in the immunophenotype of MSCs from immunoprivileged to immunogenic under ischemic conditions. We have recently reported that a soluble factor prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) preserves the immunoprivilege of allogeneic MSCs. In the current study, we found that PGE2 levels, which were elevated during normoxia, decreased in MSCs following exposure to hypoxia. Further, we found that proteasome-mediated degradation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2, rate-limiting enzyme in PGE2 biosynthesis) in hypoxic MSCs is responsible for PGE2 decrease and loss of immunoprivilege of MSCs. While investigating the mechanisms of COX2 degradation in hypoxic MSCs, we found that in normoxic MSCs, COP9 signalosome subunit 5 (CSN5) binds to COX2 and prevents its degradation by the proteasome. However, exposure to hypoxia leads to a decrease in CSN5 levels and its binding to COX2, rendering COX2 protein susceptible to proteasome-mediated degradation. This subsequently causes PGE2 downregulation and loss of immunoprivilege of MSCs. Maintaining COX2 levels in MSCs preserves immunoprivilege in vitro and improves the survival of transplanted MSCs in a rat model of MI. These data provide novel mechanistic evidence that PGE2 is downregulated in hypoxic MSCs which is responsible for the post-transplantation rejection of allogeneic MSCs. Therefore, our data suggest that the new strategies that target CSN5-COX2 signaling may improve survival and utility of transplanted allogeneic MSCs in the ischemic heart."
https://openalex.org/W3087240974,"Volumetric muscle loss (VML) is the loss of skeletal muscle that results in significant and persistent impairment of function. The unique characteristics of craniofacial muscle compared trunk and limb skeletal muscle, including differences in gene expression, satellite cell phenotype, and regenerative capacity, suggest that VML injuries may affect craniofacial muscle more severely. However, despite these notable differences, there are currently no animal models of craniofacial VML. In a previous sheep hindlimb VML study, we showed that our lab's tissue engineered skeletal muscle units (SMUs) were able to restore muscle force production to a level that was statistically indistinguishable from the uninjured contralateral muscle. Thus, the goals of this study were to: 1) develop a model of craniofacial VML in a large animal model and 2) to evaluate the efficacy of our SMUs in repairing a 30% VML in the ovine zygomaticus major muscle. Overall, there was no significant difference in functional recovery between the SMU-treated group and the unrepaired control. Despite the use of the same injury and repair model used in our previous study, results showed differences in pathophysiology between craniofacial and hindlimb VML. Specifically, the craniofacial model was affected by concomitant denervation and ischemia injuries that were not exhibited in the hindlimb model. While clinically realistic, the additional ischemia and denervation likely created an injury that was too severe for our SMUs to repair. This study highlights the importance of balancing the use of a clinically realistic model while also maintaining control over variables related to the severity of the injury. These variables include the volume of muscle removed, the location of the VML injury, and the geometry of the injury, as these affect both the muscle's ability to self-regenerate as well as the probability of success of the treatment."

In selective autophagy, the specificity of degradation targets is determined by autophagy receptors. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, autophagy receptors interact with specific targets and Atg11, resulting in the recruitment of a protein complex that initiates autophagosome formation. Previous studies have revealed that autophagy receptors are regulated by posttranslational modifications. In selective autophagy of peroxisomes (pexophagy), the receptor Atg36 localizes to peroxisomes by binding to the peroxisomal membrane protein Pex3. We previously reported that Atg36 is phosphorylated by Hrr25 (casein kinase 1δ), increasing the Atg36–Atg11 interaction and thereby stimulating pexophagy initiation. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying Atg36 phosphorylation are unknown. Here, we show that Atg36 phosphorylation is abolished in cells lacking Pex3 or expressing a Pex3 mutant defective in the interaction with Atg36, suggesting that the interaction with Pex3 is essential for the Hrr25-mediated phosphorylation of Atg36. Using recombinant proteins, we further demonstrated that Pex3 directly promotes Atg36 phosphorylation by Hrr25. A co-immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that the interaction of Atg36 with Hrr25 depends on Pex3. These results suggest that Pex3 increases the Atg36–Hrr25 interaction and thereby stimulates Atg36 phosphorylation on the peroxisomal membrane. In addition, we found that Pex3 binding protects Atg36 from proteasomal degradation. Thus, Pex3 confines Atg36 activity to the peroxisome by enhancing its phosphorylation and stability on this organelle.

In autophagy, cytoplasmic molecules and organelles are sequestered into double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes, delivered to lysosomes or vacuoles, and degraded by hydrolases within these organelles. Autophagy nonselectively degrades these cellular components to promote their turnover and to supply degradation products as nutrients under starvation conditions (3Mizushima N. Komatsu M.

Moreover, we and another group have reported that the cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting pathway (vacuolar enzyme transport via the autophagy machinery), the Ams1 pathway, and pexophagy (selective autophagy of peroxisomes) are regulated in a similar manner (24Tanaka C.

The receptors Atg19, Atg34, and Atg36 are phosphorylated by the casein kinase 1δ Hrr25, and their increased interactions with Atg11 promote the corresponding pathways. In S. cerevisiae, peroxisomes proliferate during growth in oleate medium, in which peroxisomal functions are important for cells. A previous study has shown that Atg36-dependent pexophagy is induced by long-term culture in oleate media or by exchanging the medium to nitrogen starvation medium containing glucose (19Motley A.M. Nuttall J.M. Hettema E.H. Pex3-anchored Atg36 tags peroxisomes for degradation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.EMBO J. 2012; 31 (22643220): 2852-286810.1038/emboj.2012.151Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In addition, Atg36 is expressed during cell culture in oleate medium and localizes to peroxisomes via the interaction with the peroxisomal membrane protein Pex3. Moreover, Atg36 is phosphorylated by Hrr25, and this phosphorylation promotes the Atg36–Atg11 interaction and triggers pexophagy (24Tanaka C. Tan L.J. Mochida K. Kirisako H. Koizumi M. Asai E. Sakoh-Nakatogawa M. Ohsumi Y. Nakatogawa H. Hrr25 triggers selective autophagy-related pathways by phosphorylating receptor proteins.J. Cell Biol. 2014; 207 (25287303): 91-10510.1083/jcb.201402128Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms underlying pexophagy regulation are still poorly understood. In this study, we reveal two distinct mechanisms by which Atg36 activity is confined to peroxisomes: Proteasomal degradation of cytoplasmic Atg36 and Hrr25-mediated activation of peroxisomal Atg36. In both mechanisms, Pex3 acts as a molecular switch. A previous study has shown that the peroxisomal membrane protein Pex3 recruits Atg36 to peroxisomes during pexophagy (19Motley A.M. Nuttall J.M. Hettema E.H. Pex3-anchored Atg36 tags peroxisomes for degradation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.EMBO J. 2012; 31 (22643220): 2852-286810.1038/emboj.2012.151Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). GFP-tagged Atg36 was detected as multiple bands, mostly representing the protein phosphorylated by Hrr25, under pexophagy-inducing conditions (nitrogen starvation following cell growth in oleate medium) (24Tanaka C. Tan L.J. Mochida K. Kirisako H. Koizumi M. Asai E. Sakoh-Nakatogawa M. Ohsumi Y. Nakatogawa H. Hrr25 triggers selective autophagy-related pathways by phosphorylating receptor proteins.J. Cell Biol. 2014; 207 (25287303): 91-10510.1083/jcb.201402128Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). To analyze the phosphorylation of Atg36-GFP, the ATG1 gene, which encodes a protein kinase responsible for autophagosome formation, was knocked out to block degradation of Atg36-GFP via pexophagy. We found that Atg36 phosphorylation was almost completely lost when PEX3 was disrupted (Fig. 1A). Pex3 is a peroxin responsible for the biogenesis of peroxisomes (27Farré J.C. Mahalingam S.S. Proietto M. Subramani S. Peroxisome biogenesis, membrane contact sites, and quality control.EMBO Rep. 2019; 20 (30530632): e4686410.15252/embr.201846864Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To examine whether peroxisome biogenesis is important for Atg36 phosphorylation, we knocked out other peroxin genes, PEX1, PEX5, PEX11, PEX14, and PEX19. Unlike the results for the knockout of PEX3, the phosphorylation of Atg36-GFP was not substantially impaired by the knockout of these PEX genes (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that Atg36 phosphorylation by Hrr25 requires Pex3, independent of its function in peroxisome biogenesis. Next, we investigated whether the interaction of Atg36 with Pex3 is required for Atg36 phosphorylation by Hrr25. WT Pex3 and the Pex3-177 mutant, which is functional for peroxisome biogenesis but is defective in Atg36 binding (19Motley A.M. Nuttall J.M. Hettema E.H. Pex3-anchored Atg36 tags peroxisomes for degradation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.EMBO J. 2012; 31 (22643220): 2852-286810.1038/emboj.2012.151Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), were fused with mCherry and expressed from single-copy plasmids in PEX3 knockout cells. The phosphorylation of Atg36-GFP was observed in cells expressing WT Pex3-mCherry but was decreased in cells expressing Pex3-177–mCherry (Fig. 1C), suggesting that the binding of Atg36 to Pex3 is important for Atg36 phosphorylation by Hrr25. We investigated whether the Atg36–Pex3 interaction on the peroxisome is required for Atg36 phosphorylation. Pex3, which consists of 441 amino acid residues, is anchored to the peroxisomal membrane by its N-terminal transmembrane domain (28Höhfeld J. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.H. PAS3, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene encoding a peroxisomal integral membrane protein essential for peroxisome biogenesis.J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114 (1894692): 1167-117810.1083/jcb.114.6.1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Chromosomal PEX3 was engineered to express Pex3-mCherry lacking the transmembrane domain (Pex340–441-mCherry). In addition, because the protein level of Pex340–441-mCherry was lower than that of WT Pex3-mCherry, the promoter was replaced with the ADH1 promoter to increase the protein level to that of WT Pex3-mCherry expressed under the original promoter (Fig. 1D). We also confirmed that whereas WT Pex3-mCherry and Atg36-GFP colocalized at peroxisomes (cells expressing Atg36-GFP contain a few clusters of peroxisomes) (19Motley A.M. Nuttall J.M. Hettema E.H. Pex3-anchored Atg36 tags peroxisomes for degradation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.EMBO J. 2012; 31 (22643220): 2852-286810.1038/emboj.2012.151Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), Pex340–441-mCherry and Atg36-GFP were both dispersed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 1E). Pex340–441-mCherry and WT Pex3-mCherry resulted in similar levels of Atg36-GFP phosphorylation (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that the Atg36–Pex3 interaction per se is important for Atg36 phosphorylation by Hrr25 and does not need to occur on the peroxisome. Our previous in vitro kinase assay using recombinant Hrr25 and GST-tagged Atg36 demonstrated that Hrr25 directly phosphorylates Atg36 (24Tanaka C. Tan L.J. Mochida K. Kirisako H. Koizumi M. Asai E. Sakoh-Nakatogawa M. Ohsumi Y. Nakatogawa H. Hrr25 triggers selective autophagy-related pathways by phosphorylating receptor proteins.J. Cell Biol. 2014; 207 (25287303): 91-10510.1083/jcb.201402128Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic region of Pex3 (Pex340–441) was purified and added to this in vitro reaction. When GST-Atg36 was incubated with Hrr25 and ATP in the absence of Pex340–441, the band of GST-Atg36 was slightly upshifted (Fig. 2A). The addition of Pex340–441 to the reaction caused upshifted bands of most GST-Atg36. The upshifted band of GST-Atg36 disappeared by treatment with λ protein phosphatase, and the disappearance was impeded by phosphatase inhibitors (Fig. 2B). Moreover, Pex3-17740–441, which is defective in the interaction with Atg36, had no effect on the band shift of GST-Atg36 by Hrr25 (Fig. 2A). These results demonstrated that Pex3 interacts with Atg36 and directly promotes its phosphorylation by Hrr25. Previous studies have shown that Atg36 interacts with Pex3 (19Motley A.M. Nuttall J.M. Hettema E.H. Pex3-anchored Atg36 tags peroxisomes for degradation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.EMBO J. 2012; 31 (22643220): 2852-286810.1038/emboj.2012.151Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and that Hrr25 is dispensable for the interaction (24Tanaka C. Tan L.J. Mochida K. Kirisako H. Koizumi M. Asai E. Sakoh-Nakatogawa M. Ohsumi Y. Nakatogawa H. Hrr25 triggers selective autophagy-related pathways by phosphorylating receptor proteins.J. Cell Biol. 2014; 207 (25287303): 91-10510.1083/jcb.201402128Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Consistent with the fact that Atg36 is a substrate of Hrr25, immunoprecipitation of Hrr25-GFP coprecipitated Atg36-myc (Fig. 3A). This coprecipitation depended on Pex3, suggesting that Pex3 increases the interaction of Atg36 with Hrr25. Furthermore, Pex3-myc was co-immunoprecipitated with Hrr25-GFP, and ATG36 knockout abolished this coprecipitation (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that Pex3 directly interacts with Hrr25 in association with Atg36 or indirectly interacts with Hrr25 via Atg36. We noticed that, in addition to the decrease in phosphorylation, the protein levels of Atg36 were substantially lower in cells lacking Pex3 (Fig. 1, A and B) or expressing the Pex3-177 mutant deficient for the interaction with Atg36 than in cells with WT Pex3 (Fig. 1C). In addition, Atg36 levels were almost normal in the presence of cytoplasmically expressed Pex3 (Pex341–441) (Fig. 1D). These results suggested that Pex3 binding is important for not only the Hrr25-mediated phosphorylation of Atg36 but also the protein stability of Atg36. We found that the treatment of PEX3 knockout cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 substantially increased Atg36-GFP in both oleate and nitrogen starvation media, suggesting that Atg36 is susceptible to degradation by the proteasome in the absence of Pex3 (Fig. 4A). MG132 also increased Atg36-GFP in pex3-177 cells (Fig. 4B), and it had a weaker effect on Atg36-GFP levels in cells expressing WT Pex3 (Fig. 4, A and B). These results suggest that Pex3 binding to Atg36 blocks proteasomal degradation of Atg36. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying pexophagy regulation, with a focus on the pexophagy receptor Atg36. We first showed that Pex3 is involved in the Hrr25-mediated phosphorylation of Atg36, independent of peroxisome biogenesis and the localization of these proteins to peroxisomes (Fig. 1). In vitro analysis using recombinant proteins revealed that Pex3 directly promotes Atg36 phosphorylation by Hrr25 (Fig. 2). Moreover, co-immunoprecipitation analysis suggested that the interaction of Atg36 with Hrr25 is enhanced by Pex3 and that Hrr25 directly or indirectly interacts with Pex3 depending on Atg36 (Fig. 3). These results allow us to propose a model for the spatial regulation of Atg36 phosphorylation by Hrr25 (Fig. 5). Although cytoplasmic Atg36 is not a good substrate for Hrr25, it becomes efficiently phosphorylated by Hrr25 when bound to Pex3 in the peroxisomal membrane. Pex3 and Atg36 may both interact with Hrr25 to retain the kinase at the complex, facilitating Atg36 phosphorylation by Hrr25 (Fig. 5i). Alternatively, Pex3 binding may induce a conformational change in Atg36, increasing Atg36 affinity to Hrr25 (Fig. 5ii). The conformational change may also increase the accessibility of Hrr25 to phosphorylation sites in Atg36. Pex3-dependent phosphorylation clearly enables the specific activation of Atg36 that has been correctly localized to the peroxisome as a degradation target. In the methylotrophic yeast Komagataella phapphi (formerly Pichia pastoris), Atg30 functions as a pexophagy receptor (29Farré J.C. Manjithaya R. Mathewson R.D. Subramani S. PpAtg30 tags peroxisomes for turnover by selective autophagy.Dev. Cell. 2008; 14 (18331717): 365-37610.1016/j.devcel.2007.12.011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Despite no sequence similarity between Atg30 and Atg36, these proteins share a number of functional characteristics. Similar to Atg36, Atg30 is recruited to peroxisomes by interacting with Pex3 (30Burnett S.F. Farré J.C. Nazarko T.Y. Subramani S.

In addition, Atg30 is also phosphorylated by Hrr25, and this phosphorylation is likely to increase the Atg30 interaction with Atg11 (29Farré J.C. Manjithaya R. Mathewson R.D. Subramani S. PpAtg30 tags peroxisomes for turnover by selective autophagy.Dev.

However, unlike in S. cerevisiae, Pex3 and Hrr25 competitively bind to Atg30 and therefore Pex3 inhibits the Hrr25-mediated phosphorylation of Atg30 (31Zientara-Rytter K. Ozeki K. Nazarko T.Y.

Instead, in K. phapphi, the peroxisomal acyl-CoA–binding protein Atg37 has been proposed to promote the phosphorylation of Atg30 by Hrr25 (31Zientara-Rytter K. Ozeki K. Nazarko T.Y. Subramani S.

Thus, although details are different, these two yeast species both evolved mechanisms to specifically activate pexophagy receptors localized to peroxisomes. Of note, recent studies have shown that mammalian cells regulate pexophagy in a different manner; ubiquitination of peroxisomal proteins, including peroxins, recruits ubiquitin-binding autophagy adaptors, such as p62/SQSTM1 and NBR1, to peroxisomes, leading to their sequestration into autophagosomes (33Cho D.H. Kim Y.S. Jo D.S. Choe S.K. Jo E.K. Pexophagy: Molecular mechanisms and implications for health and diseases.Mol.

In this study, we also found that cytoplasmic Atg36 (Atg36 not associated with Pex3) is susceptible to degradation by the proteasome (Fig. 4). Pex3 may mask a degron sequence in Atg36. Alternatively, phosphorylation by Hrr25 following Pex3 binding may affect Atg36 recognition by an unknown factor that directs Atg36 to proteasomal degradation. Degradation of cytoplasmic Atg36 can also contribute to the confinement of Atg36 activity to peroxisomes (Fig. 5). In addition, it may prevent excess pexophagy. A previous study has reported that the absence of the exportomer subunit Pex1 increases the protein level and phosphorylation of Atg36 and stimulates pexophagy (35Nuttall J.M. Motley A.M. Hettema E.H. Deficiency of the exportomer components Pex1, Pex6, and Pex15 causes enhanced pexophagy in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Autophagy. 2014; 10 (24657987): 835-84510.4161/auto.28259Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These results suggest that specific changes in peroxisomes affect the phosphorylation and stability of Atg36 on the peroxisome and are linked to pexophagy regulation. Future studies will elucidate the mechanism underlying Atg36 degradation, including the identification of a degron sequence in Atg36 and an E3 ligase responsible for the ubiquitination of Atg36. The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table S1. Gene disruption and tagging were performed by a PCR-based method (36Janke C. Magiera M.M. Rathfelder N. Taxis C. Reber S. Maekawa H.

Yeast cells were grown in SD+CA+ATU medium (0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate (YNB w/o aa and as), 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 2% glucose, 0.5% casamino acids, 0.002% adenyl sulfate, 0.002% tryptophan, and 0.002% uracil) at 30°C. Cells carrying pRS316-derived plasmids were cultured in SD+CA+ATU medium without uracil. To induce pexophagy, cells were grown in these media for 24 h (A600 reached ∼6), diluted 10-fold with SO+CA+ATU medium (0.17% YNB w/o aa and as, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 0.1% glucose, 0.12% oleate, 0.2% Tween 40, 1% casamino acids, 0.1% yeast extract, 0.002% adenine sulfate, 0.002% tryptophan, and 0.002% uracil), and grown for 18 h (A600 reached ∼4; cells lacking PEX genes grew normally during this time period probably because SO+CA+ATU medium contained 0.1% glucose), and the medium was replaced with SD-N (0.17% YNB w/o aa and as and 2% glucose). 20 mm MG132 dissolved in DMSO was added to the media to a final concentration of 100 μm for proteasome inhibition. Oligonucleotides used for plasmid construction are listed in Table S2. The pGEX-6P-Pex340–441 plasmid for GST-Pex340–441 expression in Escherichia coli was constructed as follows. The DNA sequence encoding Pex340–441 was amplified by PCR using genomic DNA from BY4741 (37Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D.

To construct the plasmid expressing Pex3-2×mCherry (pRS316-PEX3-2×mCherry), the PEX3-2×mCherry sequence with the PEX3 promoter and the PGK1 terminator was amplified by PCR using genomic DNA from YMS28 and the oligonucleotides Pex3-2mCherry 500 bp up and Pex3-2mCherry-PGKter down, and cloned into the single-copy vector pRS316 using BamHI and EcoRI. The pex3-177 mutation was introduced into this plasmid as described above to construct pRS316-pex3-17740–441-2×mCherry.

https://openalex.org/W3087016543,"The origin of low frequency cerebral hemodynamic fluctuations (CHF) in the resting state remains unknown. Breath-by breath O2-CO2 exchange ratio (bER) has been reported to correlate with the cerebrovascular response to brief breath hold challenge at the frequency range of 0.008-0.03Hz in healthy adults. bER is defined as the ratio of the change in the partial pressure of oxygen (ΔPO2) to that of carbon dioxide (ΔPCO2) between end inspiration and end expiration. In this study, we aimed to investigate the contribution of respiratory gas exchange (RGE) metrics (bER, ΔPO2 and ΔPCO2) to low frequency CHF during spontaneous breathing.Twenty-two healthy adults were included. We used transcranial Doppler sonography to evaluate CHF by measuring the changes in cerebral blood flow velocity (ΔCBFv) in bilateral middle cerebral arteries. The regional CHF were mapped with blood oxygenation level dependent (ΔBOLD) signal changes using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Temporal features and frequency characteristics of RGE metrics during spontaneous breathing were examined, and the simultaneous measurements of RGE metrics and CHF (ΔCBFv and ΔBOLD) were studied for their correlation.We found that the time courses of ΔPO2 and ΔPCO2 were interdependent but not redundant. The oscillations of RGE metrics were coherent with resting state CHF at the frequency range of 0.008-0.03Hz. Both bER and ΔPO2 were superior to ΔPCO2 in association with CHF while CHF could correlate more strongly with bER than with ΔPO2 in some brain regions. Brain regions with the strongest coupling between bER and ΔBOLD overlapped with many areas of default mode network including precuneus and posterior cingulate.Although the physiological mechanisms underlying the strong correlation between bER and CHF are unclear, our findings suggest the contribution of bER to low frequency resting state CHF, providing a novel insight of brain-body interaction via CHF and oscillations of RGE metrics."
https://openalex.org/W3087437617,"Both plants and animals are living things made up of similar cells as well as organelles, and their essence of life is the same. However, plants face more environmental stress than animals and generate excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), a group of small molecules that can harm proteins, necessitating distinctive metabolic processes. Secondary metabolites in plants are a group of chemical components that can eliminate ROS and can also exhibit medicinal properties; therefore, herbal medicines are often closely linked to the ecological significance of secondary metabolites. Why plants contain so many, not few, active medicinal ingredients is unknown. The root of Scutellaria baicalensis, a popular herbal medicine, is rich in various flavonoids with diverse structural features. Sodium hydrosulfite (Na2S2O4) can produce O˙-2 radicals and induce physical conditions under environmental stress. Using UHPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis, a total of 25 different compounds were identified in the roots of S. baicalensis between the Na2S2O4 groups and suitable conditions. Based on the results of the t-test (P<0.05) performed for the groups and ions with values of VIP ≥ 2, the most significantly different chemical markers with Na2S2O4 treatment were shikimic acid, citric acid, baicalin, wogonoside, baicalein, wogonin, 3,5,7,2',6'-pentahydroxyflavanone, 5,2',6'-trihydroxy-7,8-dimethoxy flavone, chrysin, eriodictyol, 5,8-dihydroxy-6,7 -dimethoxy flavone, skullcapflavone Ⅱ, and 5,7-dihydroxy-6,8,2',3'-tetrame thoxyflavone, and most of them were free flavonoids with many phenolic hydroxyl or methoxyl groups and characteristically high antioxidant activities. S. baicalensis roots modified their ability to eliminate ROS and maintained the equilibrium of ROS through the multitudinous biosynthesis and conversion of flavonoids, which is similar to the equilibrium established by an intricate buffer solution and perfectly explains the diversity and complexity of medicinal plant ingredients."
https://openalex.org/W3087584197,"Background Vitamin A deficiency is highly prevalent in low-income countries and is a major public health problem worldwide. Lactating mothers are the most vulnerable population group to vitamin A deficiency. Despite this, there is limited study on vitamin A-rich food consumption by lactating mothers in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to assess adequate vitamin A rich food consumption and associated factors among lactating mothers visiting child immunization and postnatal care centers in health institutions of Gondar Town. Methods An Institution-based cross-sectional study design was employed at a health institution in Gondar Town from February to March 2019, and included 631 study participants. Simple random sampling followed by a systematic sampling technique was used to select participants. The data were collected using the Helen Keller International Food Frequency Questionnaire, entered using Epi-Info 7 statistical software and exported to STATA version 14 for analysis. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with the outcome variable and variables with p-value <0.05 were considered as statistically significant. Result A total of 624 lactating mothers participated in the study giving a response rate of 98.89%. The study shows adequate consumption of vitamin A-rich food was 38.94% (95% CI: 35%- 43%). Predictors such as attending college diploma and above (AOR = 2.26, 95% CI; 1.02–4.99), having household family size ≤ 3 (AOR = 4.04, 95% CI; 1.60–10.17), being in higher economic class (AOR = 1.93, 95% CI; 1.18–3.14), having dietary diversity score of ≥ 5 (AOR = 1.59, 95% CI; 1.09–2.32) and meal frequency of ≥ 4 (AOR = 1.64, 95% CI; 1.09–2.32) were statistically significant. Conclusion and recommendation The majority of respondents had inadequate consumption of foods rich in vitamin A. Educational status, family size, wealth index, dietary diversity, and meal frequency were found to be factors that affect adequate consumption of vitamin A-rich foods. Encouraging and educating lactating mothers to consume foods rich in vitamin A is crucial."
https://openalex.org/W3087495327,"Sphingolipids have been implicated in mammalian placental development and function, but their regulation in the placenta remains unclear. Herein we report that alkaline ceramidase 2 (ACER2) plays a key role in sustaining the integrity of the placental vasculature by regulating the homeostasis of sphingolipids in mice. The mouse alkaline ceramidase 2 gene (Acer2) is highly expressed in the placenta between embryonic day (E) 9.5 and E12.5. Acer2 deficiency in both the mother and fetus decreases the placental levels of sphingolipids, including sphingoid bases (sphingosine and dihydrosphingosine) and sphingoid base-1-phosphates (sphingosine-1-phosphate and dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate) and results in the in utero death of ≈50% of embryos at E12.5 whereas Acer2 deficiency in either the mother or fetus has no such effects. Acer2 deficiency causes hemorrhages from the maternal vasculature in the junctional and/or labyrinthine zones in E12.5 placentas. Moreover, hemorrhagic but not non-hemorrhagic Acer2-deficient placentas exhibit an expansion of parietal trophoblast giant cells with a concomitant decrease in the area of the fetal blood vessel network in the labyrinthine zone, suggesting that Acer2 deficiency results in embryonic lethality due to the atrophy of the fetal blood vessel network in the placenta. Taken together, these results suggest that ACER2 sustains the integrity of the placental vasculature by controlling the homeostasis of sphingolipids in mice."
https://openalex.org/W3088016073,"Purpose The optimal treatment for primary gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (PG-DLBCL) is still unknown. We evaluated unfavorable prognostic factors and pattern of failure in PG-DLBCL to determine the optimal treatment strategy. Methods Between April 2001 and November 2018, 120 patients with complete remission following rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (R-CHOP) chemotherapy were retrospectively reviewed. According to the Lugano staging system, 80 patients (66.7%) had localized disease and 40 patients (33.3%) had advanced disease. A total of 93 (77.5%) patients had single gastric lesion and 27 (22.5%) patients had multiple gastric lesions. Ninety patients (75%) were treated with R-CHOP chemotherapy alone and 30 patients (25%) received R-CHOP chemotherapy with additional local treatment for gastric lesions. Results The 5-year locoregional failure-free survival (LRFS), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) rates in patients treated with R-CHOP chemotherapy with local treatment were 100%, 100%, and 100%, respectively, whereas the LRFS, PFS, and OS rates in patients treated with R-CHOP chemotherapy alone were 86.3%, 78.2%, and 87.4%, respectively (p = 0.031, p = 0.095, and p = 0.025, respectively). During the follow-up period, 17 patients (14.2%) had disease recurrence. Only 3 of the 17 patients had relapse in a completely new site without relapse in the initial involved site. All, except 2, cases of local recurrence included gastric failure. In the multivariate analysis, performance status and number of gastric lesions were independent prognostic factors for treatment outcome. Conclusions Patients with complete remission following R-CHOP chemotherapy showed a good prognosis. The main pattern of failure in patients with PG-DLBCL was local recurrence, especially in the stomach. Patients who received local treatment for gastric lesions showed improved gastric control. Therefore, in patients with unfavorable prognostic factors, we recommend R-CHOP chemotherapy with additional local treatment for gastric lesions."
https://openalex.org/W3087268507,"This study was performed to determine the clinical significance of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)-binding protein end-binding 1 (EB1) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to characterize its biochemical role in comparison with previous reports. We performed immunohistochemical staining to detect EB1 expression in tissues from 235 patients with HCC and investigated its correlations with clinicopathological features and prognosis. We also investigated the roles of EB1 in cell proliferation, migration, and tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo by siRNA- and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated modulation of EB1 expression in human HCC cell lines. The results showed that EB1 expression was significantly correlated with several important factors associated with tumor malignancy, including histological differentiation, portal vein invasion status, and intrahepatic metastasis. Patients with high EB1 expression in HCC tissue had poorer overall survival and higher recurrence rates than patients with low EB1 expression. EB1 knockdown and knockout in HCC cells reduced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Further, genes encoding Dlk1, HAMP, and SLCO1B3 that were differentially expressed in association with EB1 were identified using RNA microarray analysis. In conclusion, elevated expression of EB1 promotes tumor growth and metastasis of HCC. EB1 may serve as a new biomarker for HCC, and genes coexpressed with EB1 may represent potential targets for therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3087365630,"Consumer products are widely used as stimuli across several research fields. The use of consumer products as experimental stimuli lacks, however, the support of normative data regarding product features variability. In this work, we provide a first set of norms for people's perceptions of 150 consumer products regarding six relevant dimensions: product perceived complexity, quality objectivity, material/experiential nature, perceived price, familiarity and attitude. Products available in this normative database showed good overall distribution across the range of the dimensions evaluated. Obtained correlations between some of these dimensions provided evidence of how they can be confounded across products, further justifying the need to control for these dimensions. These norms should aid future research by allowing researchers to select products according to specific attributes and achieve appropriate experimental control. The norms here provided should also aid consumer behavior practitioners (such as marketers and advertisers) by providing insights as to how consumers perceive products along relevant dimensions."
https://openalex.org/W3087381761,"Members of the broad complex, tram track, bric-a-brac and zinc finger (BTB-ZF) family of transcription factors, such as BCL-6, ZBTB20, and ZBTB32, regulate antigen-specific B cell differentiation, plasma cell longevity, and the duration of antibody production. We found that ZBTB38, a different member of the BTB-ZF family that binds methylated DNA at CpG motifs, is highly expressed by germinal center B cells and plasma cells. To define the functional role of ZBTB38 in B cell responses, we generated mice conditionally deficient in this transcription factor. Germinal center B cells lacking ZBTB38 dysregulated very few genes relative to wild-type and heterozygous littermate controls. Accordingly, mice with hematopoietic-specific deletion of Zbtb38 showed normal germinal center B cell numbers and antibody responses following immunization with hapten-protein conjugates. Memory B cells from these animals functioned normally in secondary recall responses. Despite expression of ZBTB38 in hematopoietic stem cells, progenitors and mature myeloid and lymphoid lineages were also present in normal numbers in mutant mice. These data demonstrate that ZBTB38 is dispensable for hematopoiesis and antibody responses. These conditional knockout mice may instead be useful in defining the functional importance of ZBTB38 in other cell types and contexts."
https://openalex.org/W3087496391,"MDS are characterized by anemia and transfusion requirements. Transfused patients frequently show iron overload that negatively affects hematopoiesis. Iron chelation therapy can be effective in these MDS cases, but the molecular consequences of this treatment need to be further investigated. That is why we studied the molecular features of iron effect and Deferasirox therapy on PI-PLCbeta1 inositide signaling, using hematopoietic cells and MDS samples. At baseline, MDS patients showing a positive response after iron chelation therapy displayed higher levels of PI-PLCbeta1/Cyclin D3/PKCalpha expression. During treatment, these responder patients, as well as hematopoietic cells treated with FeCl3 and Deferasirox, showed a specific reduction of PI-PLCbeta1/Cyclin D3/PKCalpha expression, indicating that this signaling pathway is targeted by Deferasirox. The treatment was also able to specifically decrease the production of ROS. This effect correlated with a reduction of IL-1A and IL-2, as well as Akt/mTOR phosphorylation. In contrast, cells exposed only to FeCl3 and cells from MDS patients refractory to Deferasirox showed a specific increase of ROS and PI-PLCbeta1/Cyclin D3/PKCalpha expression. All in all, our data show that PI-PLCbeta1 signaling is a target for iron-induced oxidative stress and suggest that baseline PI-PLCbeta1 quantification could predict iron chelation therapy response in MDS."
https://openalex.org/W3045303383,"Hematopoietic gene delivery, such as hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), is a promising treatment for both inherited and acquired diseases, such as hemophilia. Recently, a combined strategy to achieve more than 90% transduction efficiency was documented using recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 6 (rAAV6) vectors. However, the mechanisms of enhanced vector transduction efficiency in hematopoietic cells are largely unknown. In this manuscript, we first reported that proteasome inhibitors, which are well-known to facilitate rAAV intracellular trafficking in various cell types, are not effective in hematopoietic cells. From the screening of small molecules derived from traditional Chinese medicine, we demonstrated that shikonin, a potential reactive oxygen species (ROS) generator, significantly increased the in vitro and ex vivo transgene expression mediated by rAAV6 vectors in hematopoietic cells, including human cord blood-derived CD34 + HSPCs. Shikonin mainly targeted vector intracellular trafficking, instead of host cell entry or endonuclear single to double strand vector DNA transition, in a vector serotype-dependent manner. Moreover, a ROS scavenger completely prevented the capability of shikonin to enhance rAAV6 vector-mediated transgene expression. Taken together, these studies expand our understanding of rAAV6-mediated transduction in hematopoietic cells and are informative for improving rAAV6-based treatment of blood diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3087483723,"Our primary aim was to explore the development of player load throughout match time (i.e., the pattern) using moving 5-min windows in an elite soccer team and our secondary aim was to compare player load patterns between different positions within the same team. The dataset included domestic home matches (n = 34) over three seasons for a Norwegian Elite League team. Player movements (mean ± SD age 25.5 ± 4.2 years, height 183.6 ± 6.6 cm, body mass 78.9 ± 7.4 kg) were recorded at 20 Hz using body-worn sensors. Data for each variable (player load, player load per meter, total distance, accelerations, decelerations, sprint distance, high-intensity running distance) were averaged within positions in each match, converted to z-scores and averaged across all matches, yielding one time series for each variable for each position. Pattern similarity between positions was assessed with cross-correlations. Overall, we observed a distinct pattern in player load throughout match time, which also occurred in the majority of individual matches. The pattern shows peaks at regular intervals (~15 min), each followed by a period of lower load, declining until the next peak. The same pattern was evident in player load per meter. The cross-correlation analyses support the visual evidence, with correlations ranging 0.88-0.97 (p < .001) in all position pairs. In contrast, no specific patterns were discernible in total distance, accelerations, decelerations, sprint distance and high-intensity running distance, with cross-correlations ranging 0.65-0.89 (p < .001), 0.32-0.64 (p < .005), 0.18-0.65 (p < .005 in nine position pairs), 0.02-0.38 (p < .05 in three pairs) and 0.01-0.52 (p < .05 in three pairs), respectively. This study demonstrated similarity in player load patterns between both matches and positions in elite soccer competition, which could indicate a physical ""pacing pattern"" employed by the team."
https://openalex.org/W3087523374,"Background Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has reduced HIV-related morbidity and mortality at all stages of infection and reduced transmission of HIV. Currently, the immediate start of HAART is recommended for all HIV patients, regardless of the CD4 count. There are several concerns, however, about starting treatment in critically ill patients. Unpredictable absorption of medication by the gastrointestinal tract, drug toxicity, drug interactions, limited reserve to tolerate the dysfunction of other organs resulting from hypersensitivity to drugs or immune reconstitution syndrome, and the possibility that subtherapeutic levels of drug may lead to viral resistance are the main concerns. The objective of our study was to compare the early onset (up to 5 days) with late onset (after discharge from the ICU) of HAART in HIV-infected patients admitted to the ICU. Methods This was a randomized, open-label clinical trial enrolling HIV-infected patients admitted to the ICU of a public hospital in southern Brazil. Patients randomized to the intervention group had to start treatment with HAART within 5 days of ICU admission. For patients in the control group, treatment should begin after discharge from the ICU. The patients were followed up to determine mortality in the ICU, in the hospital and at 6 months. The primary outcome was hospital mortality. The secondary outcome was mortality at 6 months. Results The calculated sample size was 344 patients. Unfortunately, we decided to discontinue the study due to a progressively slower recruitment rate. A total of 115 patients were randomized. The majority of admissions were for AIDS-defining illnesses and low CD4. The main cause of admission was respiratory failure. Regarding the early and late study groups, there was no difference in hospital (66.7% and 63.8%, p = 0.75) or 6-month (68.4% and 79.2%, p = 0.20) mortality. After multivariate analysis, the only independent predictors of in-hospital mortality were shock and dialysis during the ICU stay. For the mortality outcome at 6 months, the independent variables were shock and dialysis during the ICU stay and tuberculosis at ICU admission. Conclusions Although the early termination of the study precludes definitive conclusions being made, early HAART administration for HIV-infected patients admitted to the ICU compared to late administration did not show benefit in hospital mortality or 6-month mortality.

https://openalex.org/W3087631061,"To survive, organisms need to organize perceptual input into coherent, usable structures. Research has illuminated the potential role of frequency of occurrence and duration as cues to extract statistical regularities from our environment. Musical stimuli provide a unique opportunity to study how these cues are used to organize auditory input into higher level perceptual entities, i.e., pitch structure, and to assess the influence of cognitive schema.To examine the relative importance of these two cues in pitch structure perception, we constructed novel tone sequences in which frequency of occurrence and duration cues were pitted against each other. We assessed perceived pitch structure in musically trained and untrained listeners using a probe tone paradigm.In all experiments, a 3-tiered hierarchy of pitch structure emerged, with highest ratings for tones of longer duration, next highest for shorter, more frequent tones and lowest for probe tones that did not occur in the sequence. The hierarchy did not reflect assimilation to Western tonal schema.Our results argue against theories positing the same mechanism for the processing of duration and frequency of occurrence, and that duration is weighted preferentially. We further suggest that the organization of perceptual information will proceed according to whatever information is relevant, available, and most easily acquired."
https://openalex.org/W3087818994,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), one of the most common metabolic diseases, is characterized by insulin resistance and inadequate insulin secretion of β cells. Glycogen phosphorylase (GP) is the key enzyme in glycogen breakdown, and contributes to hepatic glucose production during fasting or during insulin resistance. Pharmacological GP inhibitors are potential glucose lowering agents, which may be used in T2DM therapy. A natural product isolated from the cultured broth of the fungal strain No. 138354, called 2,3-bis(4-hydroxycinnamoyloxy)glutaric acid (FR258900), was discovered a decade ago. In vivo studies showed that FR258900 significantly reduced blood glucose levels in diabetic mice. We previously showed that GP inhibitors can potently enhance the function of β cells. The purpose of this study was to assess whether an analogue of FR258900 can influence β cell function. BF142 (Meso-Dimethyl 2,3‐bis[(E)‐3‐(4‐acetoxyphenyl)prop‐2‐enamido]butanedioate) treatment activated the glucose-stimulated insulin secretion pathway, as indicated by enhanced glycolysis, increased mitochondrial oxidation, significantly increased ATP production, and elevated calcium influx in MIN6 cells. Furthermore, BF142 induced mTORC1-specific phosphorylation of S6K, increased levels of PDX1 and insulin protein, and increased insulin secretion. Our data suggest that BF142 can influence β cell function and can support the insulin producing ability of β cells."
https://openalex.org/W3087105866,"Canine obesity is associated with genetic, environmental, and behavioural factors, with the latter including both the behaviour of the dog and the owner. Knowledge about owner perception of canine obesity and its treatment can inform the development of new strategies to help prevent and manage this disease. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the opinions of dog owners regarding canine obesity and weight management. Dog owners residing in the city of Sao Paulo (Brazil) completed a questionnaire, either at home or in the waiting rooms of 3 veterinary hospitals. Owners determined their dog's body condition score (BCS), and this was compared with BCS determined by a veterinarian. Questionnaire findings from dogs that were in overweight (BCS 6-7/9) or obese (BCS (8-9/9) condition were compared with those in ideal weight (4-5/9) using chi-square tests and odds ratios. A total of 926 dogs were included, of which 480 (52%), 317 (34%) and 129 (14%) were in ideal, overweight and obese condition, respectively. Many owners under-estimated their dog's weight status, with the proportion increasing as the dog's weight status increased (ideal 60/480, 13%; overweight 174/317, 55%; obese 88/129, 68%; P<0.001). Although most owners (890/926, 96%) believed that canine obesity could pose health risks, the proportion that disagreed increased as weight status increased (ideal 12/480, 2%; overweight 14/317, 4%; 10/129, 8%; P = 0.006). Finally, although most owners (880/926, 95%) stated that they would let their dog undergo weight management, only a minority (182/926; 20%) believed that a trained professional was needed, and they had various misperceptions including potential cost and what the strategies that would be effective. Based on the findings of this study, it would be advisable for veterinarians to spend time addressing these misperceptions, in the hope of both improving awareness of obesity and the outcomes of weight management."
https://openalex.org/W3087192975,"This paper presents analysis, design and experimentation of a high voltage DC power supply (HVDCPS) with power factor correction based on LLC resonant converter. For power factor correction improvement, the proposed topology has an input rectifier with two filter capacitors, two inductors with a bus capacitor (Cbus) and a resonant tank. To prevent the reverse current flow towards the source diodes (D9 & D10) are employed. A couple of power switches are inserted in a single leg that makes a half-bridge network. To form an LLC resonance circuit, a capacitor and two inductors are connected to the primary winding of the high voltage transformer (HVT). To rectify the high frequency and high voltage, a full-bridge rectifier is inserted to secondary side of high voltage transformer (HVT). The secondary diodes always get on and off under zero current switching (ZCS) due to discontinuous conduction mode of proposed topology. It is found that due to power factor correction, less cost, lower losses and smaller size, the proposed topology achieves several major improvements over the conventional high voltage power supply. To obtain zero voltage switching (ZVS) the converter operate in a narrow frequency range. The output voltage can be varied or regulate through pulse width modulation of power switches. Due to ZVS and ZCS, the proposed topology has minimum switching losses and therefore higher efficiency. To verify the feasibility of the proposed topology a prototype is being implemented and verified by simulation & experimental results for 1.5KV prototype of the proposed topology. The results make sure the achievement, good efficiency and successful operation of the proposed topology."
https://openalex.org/W3087259972,"Studies have found that education differences in women's body weight increase until middle adulthood. The explanatory mechanisms behind this increase are not well-understood. This study examined the role of education differences in the prevalence of motherhood as a risk factor for weight gain and in vulnerability to its effects on weight gain. We used longitudinal data from the German Socio-economic Panel Study. Our sample included 2,668 women aged between 17 and 45 and observed at least twice between 2002 and 2016 (n = 13,899 panel observations). We used OLS regression models to estimate initial education differences in body weight and fixed-effects panel regression models to estimate education differences in body-weight trajectories. Motherhood was associated with increasing body weight, and the effects of motherhood on weight gain varied by education. Motherhood partially accounted for the increase of education differences during reproductive age. Until the age of 30, differences in the prevalence of motherhood accounted for about 20% of the bodyweight gap between lower and higher educated women. From age 35 until 45, differential vulnerability to the effects of motherhood on body weight explained about 15% of the education gap in body weight."
https://openalex.org/W3087677958,"The two lysosomal integral membrane proteins MFSD1 and GLMP form a tight complex that confers protection of both interaction partners against lysosomal proteolysis. We here refined the molecular interaction of the two proteins and found that the luminal domain of GLMP alone, but not its transmembrane domain or its short cytosolic tail, conveys protection and mediates the interaction with MFSD1. Our data support the finding that the interaction is essential for the stabilization of the complex. These results are complemented by the observation that N-glycosylation of GLMP in general, but not the type of N-glycans (high-mannose-type or complex-type) or individual N-glycan chains, are essential for protection. We observed that the interaction of both proteins already starts in the endoplasmic reticulum, and quantitatively depends on each other. Both proteins can affect vice versa their intracellular trafficking to lysosomes in addition to the protection from proteolysis. Finally, we provide evidence that MFSD1 can form homodimers both in vitro and in vivo. Our data refine the complex interplay between an intimate couple of a lysosomal transporter and its accessory subunit."

Herein, we evaluate the effect of a single street dancing class on the profile of muscle enzymes, lymphocyte activation, and cell surface CD62L expression. We also investigated the correlation between muscle enzymes, adhesion molecules, and lymphocyte activation in dancers. Fifteen male participants (mean ± standard error: age 22.4 ± 1.08 years, body mass index 24.8 ± 0.69 kg/m2, body fat 12.3 ± 1.52%), who were amateur dancers, had blood samples collected previously and subsequent to a high-intensity street dance class. After the class, dancers showed an increase in total lymphocyte count (2.0-fold), creatine kinase (CK)-NAC (4.87%), and CK-MB (3.36%). We also observed a decrease (2.5-fold) in reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by lymphocytes, under phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated environments. Following the dance class, CD62L expression in lymphocytes decreased (51.42%), while there was a negative correlation between the intensity of the exercise and CD62L expression (r = -0.73; p = 0.01). Lymphocytes were less responsive to stimuli after a single bout of street dancing, indicating transient immunosuppression."
https://openalex.org/W3088420271,"Pollination services and honeybee health in general are important in the African savannahs particularly to farmers who often rely on honeybee products as a supplementary source of income. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the floral cycle, abundance and spatial distribution of melliferous plants in the African savannah landscapes. Furthermore, placement of apiaries in the landscapes could benefit from information on spatiotemporal patterns of flowering plants, by optimising honeybees’ foraging behaviours, which could improve apiary productivity. This study sought to assess the suitability of simulated multispectral data for mapping melliferous (flowering) plants in the African savannahs. Bi-temporal AISA Eagle hyperspectral images, resampled to four sensors (i.e. WorldView-2, RapidEye, Spot-6 and Sentinel-2) spatial and spectral resolutions, and a 10-cm ultra-high spatial resolution aerial imagery coinciding with onset and peak flowering periods were used in this study. Ground reference data was collected at the time of imagery capture. The advanced machine learning random forest (RF) classifier was used to map the flowering plants at a landscape scale and a classification accuracy validated using 30% independent test samples. The results showed that 93.33%, 69.43%, 67.52% and 82.18% accuracies could be achieved using WorldView-2, RapidEye, Spot-6 and Sentinel-2 data sets respectively, at the peak flowering period. Our study provides a basis for the development of operational and cost-effective approaches for mapping flowering plants in an African semiarid agroecological landscape. Specifically, such mapping approaches are valuable in providing timely and reliable advisory tools for guiding the implementation of beekeeping systems at a landscape scale."
