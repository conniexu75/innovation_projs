https://openalex.org/W3152578692,"Methods for quantifying gene expression1 and chromatin accessibility2 in single cells are well established, but single-cell analysis of chromatin regions with specific histone modifications has been technically challenging. In this study, we adapted the CUT&Tag method3 to scalable nanowell and droplet-based single-cell platforms to profile chromatin landscapes in single cells (scCUT&Tag) from complex tissues and during the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells. We focused on profiling polycomb group (PcG) silenced regions marked by histone H3 Lys27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) in single cells as an orthogonal approach to chromatin accessibility for identifying cell states. We show that scCUT&Tag profiling of H3K27me3 distinguishes cell types in human blood and allows the generation of cell-type-specific PcG landscapes from heterogeneous tissues. Furthermore, we used scCUT&Tag to profile H3K27me3 in a patient with a brain tumor before and after treatment, identifying cell types in the tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity in PcG activity in the primary sample and after treatment."

Although RNA promotes tau aggregation in vitro, whether tau aggregates in cells contain RNA is unknown. We demonstrate, in cell culture and mouse brains, that cytosolic and nuclear tau aggregates contain RNA with enrichment for small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). Nuclear tau aggregates colocalize with and alter the composition, dynamics, and organization of nuclear speckles, membraneless organelles involved in pre-mRNA splicing. Moreover, several nuclear speckle components, including SRRM2, mislocalize to cytosolic tau aggregates in cells, mouse brains, and brains of individuals with AD, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and corticobasal degeneration (CBD). Consistent with these alterations, we observe that the presence of tau aggregates is sufficient to alter pre-mRNA splicing. This work identifies tau alteration of nuclear speckles as a feature of tau aggregation that may contribute to the pathology of tau aggregates."
https://openalex.org/W3155633297,"Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-mediated activation of downstream effector pathways such as the RAS GTPase/MAP kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade is thought to occur exclusively from lipid membrane compartments in mammalian cells. Here, we uncover a membraneless, protein granule-based subcellular structure that can organize RTK/RAS/MAPK signaling in cancer. Chimeric (fusion) oncoproteins involving certain RTKs including ALK and RET undergo de novo higher-order assembly into membraneless cytoplasmic protein granules that actively signal. These pathogenic biomolecular condensates locally concentrate the RAS activating complex GRB2/SOS1 and activate RAS in a lipid membrane-independent manner. RTK protein granule formation is critical for oncogenic RAS/MAPK signaling output in these cells. We identify a set of protein granule components and establish structural rules that define the formation of membraneless protein granules by RTK oncoproteins. Our findings reveal membraneless, higher-order cytoplasmic protein assembly as a distinct subcellular platform for organizing oncogenic RTK and RAS signaling."

Identifying mechanisms that initially compromise stem cell behavior represent early targets to promote tissue function later in life. Here, we pinpoint multiple factors that disrupt neural stem cell (NSC) behavior in the adult hippocampus. Clonal tracing showed that NSCs exhibit asynchronous depletion by identifying short-term NSCs (ST-NSCs) and long-term NSCs (LT-NSCs). ST-NSCs divide rapidly to generate neurons and deplete in the young brain. Meanwhile, multipotent LT-NSCs are maintained for months but are pushed out of homeostasis by lengthening quiescence. Single-cell transcriptome analysis of deep NSC quiescence revealed several hallmarks of molecular aging in the mature brain and identified tyrosine-protein kinase Abl1 as an NSC aging factor. Treatment with the Abl inhibitor imatinib increased NSC activation without impairing NSC maintenance in the middle-aged brain. Our study indicates that hippocampal NSCs are particularly vulnerable and adaptable to cellular aging."

In order to preserve health into older age, it is necessary to understand the nature and timing of initiating events that cause HSC aging. By performing a cross-sectional study in mice, we discover that hallmarks of aging in HSCs and hematopoiesis begin to accumulate by middle age and that the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment at middle age induces and is indispensable for hematopoietic aging. Using unbiased approaches, we find that decreased levels of the longevity-associated molecule IGF1 in the local middle-aged BM microenvironment are a factor causing HSC aging. Direct stimulation of middle-aged HSCs with IGF1 rescues molecular and functional hallmarks of aging, including restored mitochondrial activity. Thus, although decline in IGF1 supports longevity, our work indicates that this also compromises HSC function and limits hematopoietic health span.

IntroductionHematopoietic stem cell (HSC) aging in mice and humans has been defined largely by comparison between young and old (Dykstra et al., 2011Dykstra B. Olthof S. Schreuder J.

Features of hematopoietic aging are observed by middle age in mice, including HSC expansion (Morrison et al., 1996Morrison S.J. Wandycz A.M. Akashi K. Globerson A. Weissman I.L.

Understanding the molecular mechanism(s) driving these alterations will identify targets for intervention to extend hematopoietic health span.The bone marrow (BM) microenvironment in which HSCs reside is a critical regulator of HSC function. Alterations in BM niche composition and HSC localization occur in old mice (Saçma et al., 2019Saçma M. Pospiech J. Bogeska R. de Back W. Mallm J.P. Sakk V. Soller K. Marka G. Vollmer A. Karns R. et al.Haematopoietic stem cells in perisinusoidal niches are protected from ageing.Nat. Cell Biol. 2019; 21: 1309-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Therapeutic approaches targeting the old BM microenvironment rejuvenate some HSC aging phenotypes (Maryanovich et al., 2018Maryanovich M. Zahalka A.H. Pierce H. Pinho S. Nakahara F. Asada N. Wei Q.

However, the extent to which alterations in the BM microenvironment prior to old age cause, and could be targeted to ameliorate, impaired HSC function and myeloid lineage bias is not known.ResultsMyeloid bias and HSC aging hallmarks emerge by middle ageWe comprehensively analyzed hematopoietic parameters in a cross-sectional study of aging C57BL/6J female mice. At 9–12 months of age (equivalent to ∼36- to 45-year-old humans; SanMiguel et al., 2020SanMiguel J.M. Young K. Trowbridge J.J. Hand in hand: intrinsic and extrinsic drivers of aging and clonal hematopoiesis.Exp. Hematol. 2020; 91: 1-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), hallmarks of hematopoietic and HSC aging were observed, including increased frequency of myeloid cells relative to B cells (Figures 1A and S1A), increased frequency and number of phenotypic long-term HSCs (LT-HSCs) (Figures 1B, S1B, S1C, and S1E; gating strategy in Figure S1D), increased LT-HSCs with γH2AX foci (Figure 1C) (Rossi et al., 2007Rossi D.J. Bryder D. Seita J. Nussenzweig A. Hoeijmakers J. Weissman I.L. Deficiencies in DNA damage repair limit the function of haematopoietic stem cells with age.Nature. 2007; 447: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar), and loss of polarity of CDC42 and tubulin (Figure 1D) (Florian et al., 2012Florian M.C. Dörr K. Niebel A. Daria D. Schrezenmeier H. Rojewski M. Filippi M.D. Hasenberg A. Gunzer M. Scharffetter-Kochanek K. et al.Cdc42 activity regulates hematopoietic stem cell aging and rejuvenation.Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 10: 520-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Myeloid-biased CD150hi HSCs and myeloid progenitor cells (MyPro) were also found to increase in frequency and number (Figures S1F and S1G). Reduced red blood cells and platelet-biased hematopoiesis, which have been reported in old mice (Sanjuan-Pla et al., 2013Sanjuan-Pla A. Macaulay I.C. Jensen C.T. Woll P.S. Luis T.C. Mead A. Moore S.

In male mice, increased frequency of myeloid relative to B and T cells occurred after 9–12 months of age (Figure S1I), indicating potential sex-specific dynamics. Consistent with previous reports (Beerman et al., 2010Beerman I. Bhattacharya D. Zandi S. Sigvardsson M. Weissman I.L. Bryder D. Rossi D.J. Functionally distinct hematopoietic stem cells modulate hematopoietic lineage potential during aging by a mechanism of clonal expansion.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Progressive alterations in multipotent hematopoietic progenitors underlie lymphoid cell loss in aging.J. Exp. Med. 2016; 213: 2259-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), myeloid lineage bias in the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) compartment is apparent by middle age.To identify associated molecular alterations, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on LT-HSCs from individual young, middle-aged, and old female mice. Dimensionality reduction revealed a modest overlap between middle-aged and old LT-HSCs, both distinct from young LT-HSCs (Figure 1E). Middle-aged as well as old LT-HSCs were enriched for a myeloid-biased LT-HSC signature and depleted of a lymphoid-biased LT-HSC signature (Montecino-Rodriguez et al., 2019Montecino-Rodriguez E. Kong Y. Casero D. Rouault A. Dorshkind K. Pioli P.D. Lymphoid-biased hematopoietic stem cells are maintained with age and efficiently generate lymphoid progeny.Stem Cell Reports. 2019; 12: 584-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) (Figure S1J). Clustering all differentially expressed genes identified clusters increased in expression with aging (c1–c3) that were enriched for signatures of TNF-α signaling, immune system, and inflammatory responses (Figure 1F). This suggests that although distinct gene modules are engaged in middle-aged versus old LT-HSCs, overall inflammatory response is likely progressive and cumulative with age. Cluster 8 (c8), decreased specifically in middle-aged LT-HSCs, was enriched for pathways common with those decreased in aged human HSCs (65–75 years old) (Adelman et al., 2019Adelman E.R. Huang H.T. Roisman A. Olsson A. Colaprico A. Qin T. Lindsley R.C. Bejar R. Salomonis N. Grimes H.L. Figueroa M.E. Aging human hematopoietic stem cells manifest profound epigenetic reprogramming of enhancers that may predispose to leukemia.Cancer Discov. 2019; 9: 1080-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), including IL-2-Stat5 signaling, mTORC1 signaling, and cholesterol homeostasis (Figures 1G and S1K; Table S1). These molecular signatures in middle-aged LT-HSCs represent candidates for being integral to the initiation of functional decline during aging.The middle-aged BM microenvironment regulates myeloid-biased hematopoiesisWhether HSC-intrinsic or HSC-extrinsic changes, or a combination, cause aging phenotypes is a matter of ongoing debate (Verovskaya et al., 2019Verovskaya E.V. Dellorusso P.V. Passegué E. Losing sense of self and surroundings: Hematopoietic stem cell aging and leukemic transformation.Trends Mol. Med. 2019; 25: 494-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We evaluated this by reciprocal transplantation of young LT-HSCs into middle-aged mice (YM) or middle-aged LT-HSCs into young mice (MY) (Figure 2A) and assessed recipients after lineage composition had returned to steady-state levels at 24 weeks post-transplantation (Figures S2A and S2B). We found that YM compared with the young control group (YY) had higher donor-derived myeloid and decreased B cell frequencies (Figures 2B and S2C). Reciprocally, MY compared with the middle-aged control group (MM) had lower myeloid and higher B and T cell frequencies, as well as higher engraftment. In the BM, MM versus YY had reduced frequency of donor-derived LT-HSCs (Figure 2C), consistent with previous studies showing that old HSCs transplanted into old recipients have impaired BM homing and engraftment (Flach et al., 2014Flach J. Bakker S.T. Mohrin M. Conroy P.C. Pietras E.M. Reynaud D. Alvarez S. Diolaiti M.E. Ugarte F. Forsberg E.C. et al.Replication stress is a potent driver of functional decline in ageing haematopoietic stem cells.Nature. 2014; 512: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar; Ergen et al., 2012Ergen A.V. Boles N.C. Goodell M.A. Rantes/Ccl5 influences hematopoietic stem cell subtypes and causes myeloid skewing.Blood. 2012; 119: 2500-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In reciprocal transplants, YM versus YY had lower frequency of donor-derived LT-HSCs and short-term HSCs (ST-HSCs). In contrast, MY versus MM had higher frequency of LT-HSCs. In addition, the ratio of MyPro to LT-HSCs was higher in YM versus YY and lower in MY versus MM (Figures 2D and S2D). Thus, the middle-aged BM microenvironment induces and is indispensable for LT-HSC engraftment and myeloid-biased hematopoiesis.Figure 2The middle-aged BM microenvironment is sufficient to cause myeloid-biased hematopoiesisShow full caption(A) Schematic of transplantation design in which LT-HSC donors and recipients include young (Y; 2 months) or middle-aged (M; 9–12 months) sources.(B) Frequency of donor-derived myeloid, B, and T cells at 24 weeks post-transplantation.(C) Frequency of donor-derived LT-HSCs, ST-HSCs, MPP2, and MPP3/4 cells at 24 weeks post-transplantation.(D) Ratio of donor-derived myeloid progenitors (MyPro) to LT-HSCs at 24 weeks post-transplantation.(e) Top left: schematic of RNA-seq design.

We found that MY LT-HSCs clustered with YY LT-HSCs (Figure S2E). Of the 293 differentially expressed genes in MM versus YY LT-HSCs, 102 were restored in expression in MY LT-HSCs (p < 1 × 10−16, Fisher’s exact test) (Figure 2E; Table S2). MY LT-HSCs had reduced expression of myeloid differentiation and immune response genes and enrichment in metabolic regulators (e.g., Pcbd1, Gpt2, Sult2b1), PI3K/Akt signaling, and cell cycle (Figure 2E; Figures S2F and S2G). Thus, lineage bias, metabolism, PI3K/Akt signaling, and cell cycling are candidate mechanisms by which a young BM microenvironment functionally improves middle-aged LT-HSCs.Decreased IGF1 production in middle-aged BM induces myeloid-biased hematopoiesisTo prioritize candidate mechanisms and molecules for functional investigation, we input single-cell RNA-seq data from middle-aged multipotent progenitors (Young et al., 2016Young K. Borikar S. Bell R. Kuffler L. Philip V. Trowbridge J.J. Progressive alterations in multipotent hematopoietic progenitors underlie lymphoid cell loss in aging.J. Exp. Med. 2016; 213: 2259-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) into Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Upstream regulator analysis predicted increased IGF2 and reduced NRG1, IGF1, TGF-β1, and EGF in the middle-aged BM microenvironment (Figure 3A). These predictions were confirmed using middle-aged LT-HSC RNA-seq data (Table S3). Reduced IGF1 was further prioritized as the top candidate on the basis of several observations: (1) only Igf1 and Igf2 were specifically expressed by non-hematopoietic cells in the BM microenvironment (Baccin et al., 2020Baccin C.

Cell Biol. 2020; 22: 38-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) (Figures 3B and S3A); (2) decreased concentration of IGF1, but no change in IGF2, was found in the BM fluid of middle-aged versus young mice (Figures 3C and S3B); (3) high Igf1 expression was observed in mesenchymal cells (Figure 3B) and a bulk population of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) (Figure 3D), subsets of which were identified as niches for HSPCs (Méndez-Ferrer et al., 2010Méndez-Ferrer S.

See also Figure S3 and Table S3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We tested the extent to which genetic deletion of IGF1 would cause hematopoietic aging phenotypes in young mice. We transplanted wild-type (WT) BM cells into Igf1 conditional knockout mice (Igf1fl/fl;Cre-ERT2) and induced deletion after transplantation to avoid an Igf1 irradiation response confounder (Caselli et al., 2013Caselli A. Olson T.S. Otsuru S. Chen X. Hofmann T.J. Nah H.D. Grisendi G. Paolucci P. Dominici M. Horwitz E.M. IGF-1-mediated osteoblastic niche expansion enhances long-term hematopoietic stem cell engraftment after murine bone marrow transplantation.Stem Cells. 2013; 31: 2193-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The Igf1-deficient environment increased donor-derived myeloid cell and decreased B cell frequencies without altering engraftment (Figures 3E and S3F). To dissect contribution of liver-derived circulating IGF1, we transplanted WT BM into Igf1fl/fl;Nestin-CreER mice that retain liver Igf1 expression (Figure S3G). A similar Nestin-creERT2 transgene is expressed in a subset of MSCs that support HSC function (Méndez-Ferrer et al., 2010Méndez-Ferrer S. Michurina T.V. Ferraro F. Mazloom A.R. Macarthur B.D. Lira S.A. Scadden D.T. Ma’ayan A. Enikolopov G.N. Frenette P.S. Mesenchymal and haematopoietic stem cells form a unique bone marrow niche.Nature. 2010; 466: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (2411) Google Scholar). The Igf1Δ/Δ;Nestin-CreER environment increased donor-derived myeloid cells and decreased B cells without altering engraftment (Figures 3F and S3H). We found reduced white blood cell counts in Igf1Δ/Δ;Nestin-CreER recipients, which was entirely accounted for by reduction in lymphocytes (Figure 3G), and increased T cells in Igf1Δ/Δ;Cre-ERT2 recipients (Figure S3F) were not recapitulated in Igf1Δ/Δ;Nestin-CreER recipients (Figure S3H). We also conditionally deleted Igf1r on donor cells (Igf1rfl/fl;Mx1-Cre) transplanted into WT recipients and observed increased donor-derived myeloid cells and decreased B cells without altering engraftment (Figure S3I). Thus, decreased local IGF1 signaling is sufficient to cause myeloid-biased hematopoiesis.As IGF1 signaling regulates B lymphopoiesis from lymphoid progenitor cells (Landreth et al., 1992Landreth K.S.

In transplanted Igf1Δ/Δ;Nestin-CreER mice (Figure 3F) we found decreased donor-derived LT-HSCs (Figure 3H), increased myeloid-biased multipotent progenitor (MPP3) cells, and increased ratio of MyPro to LT-HSCs (Figures 3I and S3J), similar to transplantation of young LT-HSCs into middle-aged recipients (Figures 2C and 2D). We performed co-culture of WT LT-HSCs with primary Igf1Δ/Δ;Cre-ERT2 BM-derived stromal cells and observed increased production of MyPro cells (Figure 3J). Thus, decreased IGF1 in the BM microenvironment does not adequately support lymphoid cell production and favors myeloid-biased hematopoiesis from HSPCs.IGF1 stimulation rejuvenates middle-aged LT-HSC phenotypes and restores mitochondrial activityWe next asked whether IGF1 could rejuvenate middle-aged LT-HSC phenotypes. IGF1 stimulation of middle-aged LT-HSCs induced phosphorylation of IGF1R and AKT (Figure 4A), reduced in vitro myeloid differentiation (Figure S4A), decreased γH2AX foci (Figure 4B), and increased CDC42/tubulin polarity (Figure 4C). Adding IGF1 to an ex vivo culture system that expands functional HSCs (Wilkinson et al., 2019Wilkinson A.C. Ishida R. Kikuchi M. Sudo K. Morita M. Crisostomo R.V. Yamamoto R. Loh K.M. Nakamura Y. Watanabe M. et al.Long-term ex vivo haematopoietic-stem-cell expansion allows nonconditioned transplantation.Nature. 2019; 571: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) followed by transplantation resulted in decreased donor-derived myeloid cell and increased B cell frequencies without altering engraftment (Figures 4D, 4E, and S4B). Secondary transplantation resulted in sustained decrease in donor-derived myeloid cell and increased lymphoid cell frequencies, also without altering engraftment (Figures 4F and S4C). Thus, direct stimulation of middle-aged LT-HSCs with IGF1 rescues molecular hallmarks of HSC aging and sustainably reduces myeloid-biased hematopoiesis and increases lymphoid potential without affecting HSC self-renewal.Figure 4IGF1 stimulation of middle-aged LT-HSCs rescues hallmarks of agingShow full caption(A) Quantification of intracellular phospho-flow cytometry for p-IGF1R (left) or p-AKT (right) after 20 min IGF1 stimulation of 14 month LT-HSCs.

https://openalex.org/W3156247793,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has intensely changed the everyday lives of people worldwide. This study explores the forms and outcomes of coronavirus and COVID-19-related social stigma and the experiences of people who were home quarantined or isolated in Finland during the spring 2020. The findings of this study can be used to improve support for those quarantined or isolated and to develop strategies to reduce the stigma associated with coronavirus and COVID-19. Methods The study is based on qualitative one-to-one interviews with households with at least two members and at least one PCR confirmed COVID-19 case. Recruitment took place via website or SMS messages sent to PCR confirmed cases in the capital area of Helsinki. Sampling was based on maximum variation to acquire different types of respondents. The framework of health stigma was used to develop question guides and analyze stigma. Quarantine and isolation experiences were explored through open-ended questions. The analysis was based on thematic analysis. Results The study included 64 participants from 24 households. Perceived stigma among respondents was driven by fear and blame for infection, and it manifested in various ways leading to a reluctance to disclose their coronavirus status to others. Self-stigma developed from conflicting information and advice about coronavirus and COVID-19 led to difficulties interacting with others outside of the house and reluctance to meet people after quarantine and isolation. Quarantine and isolation experiences included uncertainty, health concerns, and boredom. Communication with others in similar situations was perceived vital, whereas discussions with family members about worries and fears related to coronavirus and COVID-19 was not preferred. Conclusions This study shed light on the lives of those quarantined or isolated at home and provided a set of operational recommendations to minimize coronavirus and COVID-19-associated stigma and to reduce challenges faced by those in quarantine or isolation."

https://openalex.org/W3152938773,"MammoWave is a microwave imaging device for breast lesions detection, which operates using two (azimuthally rotating) antennas without any matching liquid. Images, subsequently obtained by resorting to Huygens Principle, are intensity maps, representing the homogeneity of tissues’ dielectric properties. In this paper, we propose to generate, for each breast, a set of conductivity weighted microwave images by using different values of conductivity in the Huygens Principle imaging algorithm. Next, microwave images’ parameters, i.e. features , are introduced to quantify the non-homogenous behaviour of the image. We empirically verify on 103 breasts that a selection of these features may allow distinction between breasts with no radiological finding (NF) and breasts with radiological findings (WF), i.e. with lesions which may be benign or malignant. Statistical significance was set at p &lt;0.05. We obtained single features Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curves (AUCs) spanning from 0.65 to 0.69. In addition, an empirical rule-of-thumb allowing breast assessment is introduced using a binary score S operating on an appropriate combination of features. Performances of such rule-of-thumb are evaluated empirically, obtaining a sensitivity of 74%, which increases to 82% when considering dense breasts only."
https://openalex.org/W3153148133,"Semantic segmentation of medical images provides an important cornerstone for subsequent tasks of image analysis and understanding. With rapid advancements in deep learning methods, conventional U-Net segmentation networks have been applied in many fields. Based on exploratory experiments, features at multiple scales have been found to be of great importance for the segmentation of medical images. In this paper, we propose a scale-attention deep learning network (SA-Net), which extracts features of different scales in a residual module and uses an attention module to enforce the scale-attention capability. SA-Net can better learn the multi-scale features and achieve more accurate segmentation for different medical image. In addition, this work validates the proposed method across multiple datasets. The experiment results show SA-Net achieves excellent performances in the applications of vessel detection in retinal images, lung segmentation, artery/vein(A/V) classification in retinal images and blastocyst segmentation. To facilitate SA-Net utilization by the scientific community, the code implementation will be made publicly available."
https://openalex.org/W3154892610,"In this work, we determined the diversity and dynamics of the gut virome of infants during the first year of life. Fecal samples were collected monthly, from birth to one year of age, from three healthy children living in a semi-rural village in Mexico. Most of the viral reads were classified into six families of bacteriophages including five dsDNA virus families of the order Caudovirales , with Siphoviridae and Podoviridae being the most abundant. Eukaryotic viruses were detected as early as two weeks after birth and remained present all along the first year of life. Thirty-four different eukaryotic virus families were found, where eight of these families accounted for 98% of all eukaryotic viral reads: Anelloviridae , Astroviridae , Caliciviridae , Genomoviridae , Parvoviridae , Picornaviridae , Reoviridae and the plant-infecting viruses of the Virgaviridae family. Some viruses in these families are known human pathogens, and it is surprising that they were found during the first year of life in infants without gastrointestinal symptoms. The eukaryotic virus species richness found in this work was higher than that observed in previous studies; on average between 7 and 24 virus species were identified per sample. The richness and abundance of the eukaryotic virome significantly increased during the second semester of life, probably because of an increased environmental exposure of infants with age. Our findings suggest an early and permanent contact of infants with a diverse array of bacteriophages and eukaryotic viruses, whose composition changes over time. The bacteriophages and eukaryotic viruses found in these children could represent a metastable virome, whose potential influence on the development of the infant’s immune system or on the health of the infants later in life, remains to be investigated."
https://openalex.org/W3153447942,"The world’s most severe thunderstorm asthma event occurred in Melbourne, Australia on 21 November 2016, coinciding with the peak of the grass pollen season. The aetiological role of thunderstorms in these events is thought to cause pollen to rupture in high humidity conditions, releasing large numbers of sub-pollen particles (SPPs) with sizes very easily inhaled deep into the lungs. The humidity hypothesis was implemented into a three-dimensional atmospheric model and driven by inputs from three meteorological models. However, the mechanism could not explain how the Melbourne event occurred as relative humidity was very low throughout the atmosphere, and most available grass pollen remained within 40 m of the surface. Our tests showed humidity induced rupturing occurred frequently at other times and would likely lead to recurrent false alarms if used in a predictive capacity. We used the model to investigate a range of other possible pollen rupturing mechanisms which could have produced high concentrations of SPPs in the atmosphere during the storm. The mechanisms studied involve mechanical friction from wind gusts, electrical build up and discharge incurred during conditions of low relative humidity, and lightning strikes. Our results suggest that these mechanisms likely operated in tandem with one another, but the lightning method was the only mechanism to generate a pattern in SPPs following the path of the storm. If humidity induced rupturing cannot explain the 2016 Melbourne event, then new targeted laboratory studies of alternative pollen rupture mechanisms would be of considerable value to help constrain the parameterisation of the pollen rupturing process."
https://openalex.org/W3153111962,"Background In order to identify an inexpensive yet highly stable SARS-CoV-2 collection device as an alternative to foam swabs stored in transport media, both contrived (“surrogate”) CoV-positive and patient-collected spun polyester swabs stored in dry tubes were evaluated for time- and temperature-stability using qPCR. Methods Surrogate specimens were prepared by combining multiple, residual SARS-CoV-2-positive clinical specimens and diluting to near-LOD levels in either porcine or human mucus (“matrix”), inoculating foam or polyester nasal swabs, and sealing in dry tubes. Swabs were then subjected to one of three temperature excursions: (1) 4°C for up to 72 hours; (2) 40°C for 12 hours, followed by 32°C for up to 60 hours; or (3) multiple freeze-thaw cycles (-20°C). The stability of extracted SARS-CoV-2 RNA for each condition was evaluated by qPCR. Separate usability studies for the dry polyester swab-based HealthPulse@home COVID-19 Specimen Collection Kit were later conducted in both adult and pediatric populations. Results Polyester swabs stored dry demonstrated equivalent performance to foam swabs for detection of low and moderate SARS-CoV-2 viral loads. Mimicking warm- and cold- climate shipment, surrogate specimens were stable following either 72 hours of a high-temperature excursion or two freeze-thaw cycles. In addition, usability studies comprised of self-collected patient specimens yielded sufficient material for molecular testing, as demonstrated by RNase P detection. Conclusions Polyester nasal swabs stored in dry collection tubes offer a robust and inexpensive self-collection method for SARS-CoV-2 viral load testing, as viral RNA remains stable under conditions required for home collection and shipment to the laboratory."
https://openalex.org/W3153638312,"A remarkable feature of tissue stem cells is their ability to regenerate the structure and function of host tissue following transplantation. However, the dynamics of donor stem cells during regeneration remains largely unknown. Here we conducted quantitative clonal fate studies of transplanted mouse spermatogonial stem cells in host seminiferous tubules. We found that, after a large population of donor spermatogonia settle in host testes, through stochastic fate choice, only a small fraction persist and regenerate over the long term, and the rest are lost through differentiation and cell death. Further, based on these insights, we showed how repopulation efficiency can be increased to a level where the fertility of infertile hosts is restored by transiently suppressing differentiation using a chemical inhibitor of retinoic acid synthesis. These findings unlock a range of potential applications of spermatogonial transplantation, from fertility restoration in individuals with cancer to conservation of biological diversity."
https://openalex.org/W3152553059,"The ability to accurately identify infected hosts is the cornerstone of effective disease control and eradication programs. In the case of bovine tuberculosis, accurately identifying infected individual animals has been challenging as all available tests exhibit limited discriminatory ability. Here we assess the utility of two serological tests (IDEXX Mycobacterium bovis Ab test and Enfer multiplex antibody assay) and assess their performance relative to skin test (Single Intradermal Comparative Cervical Tuberculin; SICCT), gamma-interferon (IFNγ) and post-mortem results in a Northern Ireland setting. Furthermore, we describe a case-study where one test was used in conjunction with statutory testing. Serological tests using samples taken prior to SICCT disclosed low proportions of animals as test positive (mean 3% positive), despite the cohort having high proportions with positive SICCT test under standard interpretation (121/921; 13%) or IFNγ (365/922; 40%) results. Furthermore, for animals with a post-mortem record (n = 286), there was a high proportion with TB visible lesions (27%) or with laboratory confirmed infection (25%). As a result, apparent sensitivities within this cohort was very low (≤15%), however the tests succeeded in achieving very high specificities (96–100%). During the case-study, 7/670 (1.04%) samples from SICCT negative animals from a large chronically infected herd were serology positive, with a further 17 animals being borderline positive (17/670; 2.54%). Nine of the borderline animals were voluntarily removed, none of which were found to be infected post-mortem (no lesions/bacteriology negative). One serology test negative animal was subsequently found to have lesions at slaughter with M . bovis confirmed in the laboratory."
https://openalex.org/W3155375778,"The emergence and quick spread of SARS-CoV-2 has pointed at a low capacity response for testing large populations in many countries, in line of material, technical and staff limitations. The traditional RT-qPCR diagnostic test remains the reference method and is by far the most widely used test. These assays are limited to a few probe sets, require large sample PCR reaction volumes, along with an expensive and time-consuming RNA extraction step. Here we describe a quantitative nanofluidic assay that overcomes some of these shortcomings, based on the Biomark TM instrument from Fluidigm. This system offers the possibility of performing 4608 qPCR end-points in a single run, equivalent to 192 clinical samples combined with 12 pairs of primers/probe sets in duplicate, thus allowing the monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 including the detection of specific SARS-CoV-2 variants, as well as the detection other pathogens and/or host cellular responses (virus receptors, response markers, microRNAs). The 10 nL-range volume of Biomark TM reactions is compatible with sensitive and reproducible reactions that can be easily and cost-effectively adapted to various RT-qPCR configurations and sets of primers/probe. Finally, we also evaluated the use of inactivating lysis buffers composed of various detergents in the presence or absence of proteinase K to assess the compatibility of these buffers with a direct reverse transcription enzymatic step and we propose several protocols, bypassing the need for RNA purification. We advocate that the combined utilization of an optimized processing buffer and a high-throughput real-time PCR device would contribute to improve the turn-around-time to deliver the test results to patients and increase the SARS-CoV-2 testing capacities."
https://openalex.org/W3155565051,"To estimate sex-specific prevalence and associated socio-economic, demographic, and lifestyle risk factors of hypertension in India. We used data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4) of 2015–16. The analysis based on 6,99,686 women (15–49 years) and 1,12,122 men (15–54 years) whose blood pressure (BP) were measured during the survey. Bivariate distribution was used to show the prevalence of hypertension and, maps were used to present its spatial patterns. Logistic regression model was used to identify sex-specific association between risk factors and hypertension. Results show that the overall prevalence of hypertension was 16.32% among men and 11.56% among women. We also found that the prevalence of hypertension across selected socio-economic, demographic and lifestyle background characteristics and in a majority of the states was higher among men compared to women. Odds ratios from logistic regression analysis direct sex-related differences in risk factors. Hypertension increases with an increase in age and the risk is higher among older women (AOR, 5.58; 95% CI, 5.16–6.03 for women aged 40–49 and AOR, 4.24; 95% CI, 3.94–4.57 for men aged 50–54) compared to men. Education, types of jobs (specially technical, administrative and managerial), marital status and non-vegetarian diet were significantly associated with hypertension in men. While other than age; non-working, consumption of alcohol, and being a diabetic was found to be major risk factors for this disease among women. There are sex-related differences in prevalence as well as risk factors of hypertension in India. In order to prevent early developments of hypertension, awareness related to changing lifestyles such as a diet rich in fruits, vegetables as well as screening to control BP should be promoted among youths and adults in India. The study also recommends sex-specific approaches in health infrastructure and policies besides increasing public awareness."

To investigate how such content is perceived by the global community, mixed model sentiment analysis techniques were employed to explore variations in attitudes expressed through text and emoji usage in public comments associated with 346 popular YouTube ® videos starring exotic wild cats or primates in ‘free handling’ situations. Negative interactions between wild cats and primates with other species were found to be associated with both text and emoji median sentiment reduction, however were still accompanied by a median emoji sentiment above zero. Additionally, although a negative trend in median text sentiment was observed in 2015 for primates, an otherwise consistent positive median text and emoji sentiment score through time across all IUCN Red List categories was revealed in response to both exotic wild cat and primate videos, further implying the societal normalisation and acceptance of exotic pets.

https://openalex.org/W3156016786,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are defined as transcripts of greater than 200 nucleotides that play a crucial role in various cellular processes such as the development, differentiation and gene regulation across all eukaryotes, including plant cells. Since the last decade, there has been a significant rise in our understanding of lncRNA molecular functions in plants, resulting in an exponential increase in lncRNA transcripts, while these went unannounced from the major Angiosperm plant species despite the availability of large-scale high throughput sequencing data in public repositories. We, therefore, developed a user-friendly, open-access web interface, AlnC ( A ngiosperm ln cRNA C atalogue) for the exploration of lncRNAs in diverse Angiosperm plant species using recent 1000 plant ( 1KP ) trancriptomes data. The current version of AlnC offers 10,855,598 annotated lncRNA transcripts across 682 Angiosperm plant species encompassing 809 tissues. To improve the user interface, we added features for browsing, searching, and downloading lncRNA data, interactive graphs, and an online BLAST service. Additionally, each lncRNA record is annotated with possible small open reading frames (sORFs) to facilitate the study of peptides encoded within lncRNAs. With this user-friendly interface, we anticipate that AlnC will provide a rich source of lncRNAs for small-and large-scale studies in a variety of flowering plants, as well as aid in the improvement of key characteristics in relevance to their economic importance.

There is emerging evidence of SARS-CoV-2 virus found in the blood of patients from China and some developed countries. However, there is inadequate data reported in Ghana and other parts of Africa, where blood transfusion service heavily relies on voluntary and replacement blood donors. This study aimed to investigate whether plasma of infected individuals could pose significant transfusion transmitted risk of COVID-19 in Ghanaian populations.This cross-sectional retrospective study was conducted at the Kumasi Centre for Collaborative Research into Tropical Medicine (KCCR), KNUST, Ghana. Study subjects comprised contacts of COVID-19 individuals, those with classical symptoms of COVID-19 and individuals who had recovered based on the new Ghana discharge criteria. Whole blood, sputum or deep coughed saliva samples were collected and transported to KCCR for SARS-CoV-2 testing. Viral nucleic acid was extracted from sputum/nasopharyngeal samples using Da An Gene column based kit and from plasma using LBP nucleic acid extraction kit. Real-Time PCR was performed specifically targeting the ORF1ab and Nucleocapsid (N) genomic regions of the virus.A total of 97 individuals were recruited into the study, with more than half being males (58; 59.7%). The mean age of all subjects was 33 years (SD = 7.7) with minimum being 22 years and maximum 56 years. Majority (76; 78.4%) of all the subjects were asymptomatic, and among the few symptomatic subjects, cough (10; 10.3%) was the most predominant symptom. Of the 97 sputum samples tested, 79 (81.4%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. We identified SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in the plasma of 1 (1.03%) subject who had clinically recovered.This study reports the identification of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in a convalescent individual in Ghana. Due to the low prevalence observed and the marginal cycling thresholds associated, the risk of transfusion transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is negligible. Well-powered studies and advanced diagnostics to determine infectious viremia is recommended to further evaluate the potential risk of hematogenous transmission among recovered patients."
https://openalex.org/W3156181975,"The reporting of Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) mortality among healthcare workers highlights their vulnerability in managing the COVID-19 pandemic. Some low- and middle-income countries have highlighted the challenges with COVID-19 testing, such as inadequate capacity, untrained laboratory personnel, and inadequate funding. This article describes the components and implementation of a healthcare worker surveillance programme in a designated COVID-19 teaching hospital in Malaysia. In addition, the distribution and characteristics of healthcare workers placed under surveillance are described.A COVID-19 healthcare worker surveillance programme was implemented in University Malaya Medical Centre. The programme involved four teams: contact tracing, risk assessment, surveillance and outbreak investigation. Daily symptom surveillance was conducted over fourteen days for healthcare workers who were assessed to have low-, moderate- and high-risk of contracting COVID-19. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted for data collected over 24 weeks, from the 6th of March 2020 to the 20th of August 2020.A total of 1,174 healthcare workers were placed under surveillance. The majority were females (71.6%), aged between 25 and 34 years old (64.7%), were nursing staff (46.9%) and had no comorbidities (88.8%). A total of 70.9% were categorised as low-risk, 25.7% were moderate-risk, and 3.4% were at high risk of contracting COVID-19. One-third (35.2%) were symptomatic, with the sore throat (23.6%), cough (19.8%) and fever (5.0%) being the most commonly reported symptoms. A total of 17 healthcare workers tested positive for COVID-19, with a prevalence of 0.3% among all the healthcare workers. Risk category and presence of symptoms were associated with a positive COVID-19 test (p<0.001). Fever (p<0.001), cough (p = 0.003), shortness of breath (p = 0.015) and sore throat (p = 0.002) were associated with case positivity.COVID-19 symptom surveillance and risk-based assessment have merits to be included in a healthcare worker surveillance programme to safeguard the health of the workforce."
https://openalex.org/W3156483604,"Planktonic foraminifera are heterotrophic sexually reproducing marine protists with an exceptionally complete fossil record that provides unique insights into long-term patterns and processes of evolution. Populations often exhibit strong biases towards either right (dextral) or left (sinistral) shells. Deep-sea sediment cores spanning millions of years reveal that some species show large and often rapid fluctuations in their dominant coiling direction through time. This is useful for biostratigraphic correlation but further work is required to understand the population dynamical processes that drive these fluctuations. Here we address the case of coiling fluctuations in the planktonic foraminifer genus Pulleniatina based on new high-resolution counts from two recently recovered sediment cores from either side of the Indonesian through-flow in the tropical west Pacific and Indian Oceans (International Ocean Discovery Program Sites U1486 and U1483). We use single-specimen stable isotope analyses to show that dextral and sinistral shells from the same sediment samples can show significant differences in both carbon and oxygen isotopes, implying a degree of ecological separation between populations. In one case we detect a significant difference in size between dextral and sinistral specimens. We suggest that major fluctuations in coiling ratio are caused by cryptic populations replacing one another in competitive sweeps, a mode of evolution that is more often associated with asexual organisms than with the classical ‘biological species concept’."
https://openalex.org/W3156511978,"Inhibitory neurons orchestrate the activity of excitatory neurons and play key roles in circuit function. Although individual interneurons have been studied extensively, little is known about their properties at the population level. Using random-access 3D two-photon microscopy, we imaged local populations of cerebellar Golgi cells (GoCs), which deliver inhibition to granule cells. We show that population activity is organized into multiple modes during spontaneous behaviors. A slow, network-wide common modulation of GoC activity correlates with the level of whisking and locomotion, while faster (<1 s) differential population activity, arising from spatially mixed heterogeneous GoC responses, encodes more precise information. A biologically detailed GoC circuit model reproduced the common population mode and the dimensionality observed experimentally, but these properties disappeared when electrical coupling was removed. Our results establish that local GoC circuits exhibit multidimensional activity patterns that could be used for inhibition-mediated adaptive gain control and spatiotemporal patterning of downstream granule cells."
https://openalex.org/W3156620604,"This work demonstrates the importance of integrating sexual division of labour into the research of the transition to the Neolithic and its social implications. During the spread of the Neolithic in Europe, when migration led to the dispersal of domesticated plants and animals, novel tasks and tools, appear in the archaeological record. By examining the use-wear traces from over 400 stone tools from funerary contexts of the earliest Neolithic in central Europe we provide insights into what tasks could have been carried out by women and men. The results of this analysis are then examined for statistically significant correlations with the osteological, isotopic and other grave good data, informing on sexed-based differences in diet, mobility and symbolism. Our data demonstrate males were buried with stone tools used for woodwork, and butchery, hunting or interpersonal violence, while women with those for the working of animal skins, expanding the range of tasks known to have been carried out. The results also show variation along an east-west cline from Slovakia to eastern France, suggesting that the sexual division of labour (or at least its representation in death) changed as farming spread westwards."

A total of 1,495 women, ranging from 18 to 65 years of age, with different cytological results were enrolled. The HPV genotyping assay was performed using the EUROArray HPV test in order to detect thirty genitally relevant HPV subtypes. In our study, the most prevalent genotypeswere HPV 16, 31, 51, and 53. Among these, HPV 16 was consistently present in all cytological subgroups. Twelve HPV genotypes classified as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1) were detected in 77.8.0% of HSIL/ASCH and 55.0% of NILM with abnormal colposcopy findings. Six possible carcinogens—HRs (group 2B) were often found in women with normal cytology (14.8%) and mild abnormalities (ASCUS and LSIL), but with lower frequence in HSIL/ASCH lesions (7.1%). HPVs 6 and 11(Group 3) were not found in the cases of HSIL/ASCH. Unclassified HPV types were equally distributed in all cytology groups: 20.7%, 19.1%, 16.3% and 13% of NILM, ASCUS, LSIL and HSIL/ASCH, respectively. Our findings highlight that majority of abnormal Pap test results are caused by Group 1 HPVs among women from our region. Low frequency HPVs of group 2A/2B, especially HSIL/ASCH, supports the conclusion that individual genotypes require consideration of each type as an individual agent. We expect a positive impact of HPV vaccine in reducing HPV-associated cervical lesions among women from Vojvodina province, after establishing vaccination programs in our country."

The aim of this research is to examine the inhibitors that have a major impact on the performance of CSC operations in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). This study provides a synthesis and suggests a hierarchical model among CSC inhibitors and their respective relevance. The hierarchical synthesis of twelve (12) primary CSC inhibitors is achieved through a comprehensive literature review and consultation with academics and CSC professionals. This study used semi-structured interviews, a fuzzy interpretive structural modeling (FISM) and a Fuzzy-MICMAC (FMICMAC) analysis to explore and establish the relationship between and among identified inhibitors. FISM is used to examine the interaction between inhibitors, while FMICMAC analysis is used to examine the nature of inhibitors on the basis of their dependence and driving power. The results of the FISM and FMICMAC analysis show the inter-relationships and relative dominance of identified inhibitors. The results show that some inhibitors are of high strategic importance due to their high driving power and low dependence. These inhibitors seek more management attention in order to improve their effectiveness. The result of a hierarchical model helps to understand the influence of a particular inhibitor on others. ‘Higher capital and operating costs’ occupy the highest level in the FISM model. The ‘fragmented cold supply chains’, ‘lack of skilled labor’, ‘inadequate information system infrastructure’ and ‘lack of commitment by top level management’ had strong driving power but weak dependence, which characterizes them as independent inhibitors. Management should be extra careful when dealing with these inhibitors as they influence the effects of other variables at the top of the FISM hierarchy in the overall management of the cold supply chain. The study also suggests a number of recommendations for addressing these inhibitors in cold supply chains operating in the UAE. With due attention and care for these inhibitors, the operation of the cold supply chains is likely to be even more successful."
https://openalex.org/W3155669205,"To date no study has examined time trends in adolescent consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and energy drinks, or modelled change in inequalities over time. The present study aimed to fill this gap by identifying historical trends among secondary school students in Wales, United Kingdom. The present study includes 11-16 year olds who completed the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey and the Welsh School Health Research Network (SHRN) survey between 1998 to 2017. Multinomial regression models were employed alongside tests for interaction effects. A total of 176,094 student responses were assessed. From 1998 to 2017, the prevalence of daily sugar-sweetened beverage consumption decreased (57% to 18%) while weekly consumption has remained constant since 2006 (49% to 52%). From 2013 to 2017, daily consumption of energy drinks remained stable (6%) while weekly consumption reports steadily decreased (23% to 15%). Boys, older children and those from a low socioeconomic group reported higher consumption rates of sugar-sweetened beverages and energy drinks. Consumption according to socioeconomic group was the only characteristic to show a statistically significant change over time, revealing a widening disparity between sugar-sweetened beverage consumption rates of those from low and high socioeconomic groups. Findings indicate a positive shift in overall consumption rates of both sugar-sweetened beverages and energy drinks. Adolescents from a low socioeconomic group however were consistently shown to report unfavourable sugar-sweetened beverages consumption when compared to peers from high socioeconomic group. Given the established longer term impacts of sugar-sweetened beverage and energy drink consumption on adolescent health outcomes, urgent policy action is required to reduce overall consumption rates, with close attention to equity of impact throughout policy design and evaluation plans."
https://openalex.org/W3154949229,"Due to their ability to parasitize various insect species, generalist parasitoids are widely used as biological control agents. They can be mass-reared and released in agroecosystems to control several pest species in various crops. However, the existence of genetic differentiation among populations of generalist parasitoid species is increasingly recognized and this can be associated with an adaptation to local conditions or to a reduced range of host species. Moreover, constraints of mass-rearing conditions can alter genetic variation within parasitoid populations released. These features could be associated with a reduced efficiency of the control of targeted pest species. Here, we focused on strawberry greenhouses where the control of aphids with the generalist parasitoid Aphidius ervi appears to be inefficient. We investigated whether this inefficiency may have both genetic and ecological bases comparing wild and commercial populations of A . ervi . We used two complementary genetic approaches: one based on the mitochondrial marker COI and one based on microsatellite markers. COI analysis showed a genetic differentiation within the A . ervi species, but the structure was neither associated with the commercial/wild status nor with host species factors. On the other hand, using microsatellite markers, we showed a genetic differentiation between commercial and wild A . ervi populations associated with a loss of genetic diversity within the mass-reared populations. Our ecological genetics study may potentially explain the weak efficiency of biological control of aphids in protected strawberry crops and enable to provide some insights to improve biological control."
https://openalex.org/W3156360975,"Advances in methods for determining the forces exerted by cells while they migrate are essential for attempting to understand important pathological processes, such as cancer or angiogenesis, among others. Precise data from three-dimensional conditions are both difficult to obtain and manipulate. For this purpose, it is critical to develop workflows in which the experiments are closely linked to the subsequent computational postprocessing. The work presented here starts from a traction force microscopy (TFM) experiment carried out on microfluidic chips, and this experiment is automatically joined to an inverse problem solver that allows us to extract the traction forces exerted by the cell from the displacements of fluorescent beads embedded in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Therefore, both the reconstruction of the cell geometry and the recovery of the ECM displacements are used to generate the inputs for the resolution of the inverse problem. The inverse problem is solved iteratively by using the finite element method under the hypothesis of finite deformations and nonlinear material formulation. Finally, after mathematical postprocessing is performed, the traction forces on the surface of the cell in the undeformed configuration are obtained. Therefore, in this work, we demonstrate the robustness of our computational-based methodology by testing it under different conditions in an extreme theoretical load problem and then by applying it to a real case based on experimental results. In summary, we have developed a new procedure that adds value to existing methodologies for solving inverse problems in 3D, mainly by allowing for large deformations and not being restricted to any particular material formulation. In addition, it automatically bridges the gap between experimental images and mechanical computations."
https://openalex.org/W3156378746,"Introduction Stress is a major health issue in adolescents owing to the important transitions experienced during this period. Aromatherapy is an effective method for the reduction of stress in adolescents. Purpose The aims of this study were to examine the effect of aromatherapy on the regulation of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) along with stress relief and to explore the effect of aromatherapy on adolescents with different levels of stress. Methods This quasi-experimental study comprised three types of treatments: control (no essential oil), pure essential oil therapy (sandalwood), and blended essential oil therapy (sandalwood-lavender). The heart rate variability (HRV) was calculated to evaluate the post-exercise recovery of the ANS to the baseline level in the recruited adolescents. To examine the efficiency of aromatherapy, Friedman test was used to assess the significance of difference in all parameters (i.e., mean heart rate, SDNN, normalized LF, normalized HF, and LF/HF) between baseline and after exercise among the three treatment conditions. Results The participants comprised 43 junior college students (8 males and 35 females) with a mean age of 18.21 ± 0.99. Significant differences in changes of two HRV parameters (normalized LF and LF/HF) were associated with both essential oil therapies compared to those in the control group ( p &lt;0.05), and one more HRV parameter (normalized HF) exhibited significant difference related to blended essential oil therapy compared to that of the control group. Besides, changes in two HRV parameters (mean heart rate and normalized HF) of both essential oil therapies in the low level stress subgroup showed significant differences compared to those of the control group ( p &lt;0.05). Conclusions This study demonstrated that aromatherapy could be used for ANS regulation with stress-relieving effects in adolescents. The participants with a low stress level appeared to respond better to the blended essential oil therapy, whereas those with medium to high levels of stress appeared to respond poorly to aromatherapy compared to the control."

Similar pairs of lakes with differing infestations of zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha , and starry stonewort, Nitellopsis obtuse , were used as study sites to infer how being at an infested lake vs. being at an uninfested lake and different local species would impact responses. We also examined recreationists’ visit motivation, and aquatic invasive species perceived risk, knowledge, and awareness of problem. We estimated mean willingness to pay about nine to ten dollars per day, which did not differ significantly by lake. Additionally, perceived risk, awareness of problem, and visit motivation were significant in predicting willingness to pay, which could have important ramifications for aquatic invasive species management."
https://openalex.org/W3156976985,"Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase domain constitutively activate EGFR resulting in lung tumorigenesis. Activated EGFR modulates downstream signaling by altering phosphorylation-driven interactions that promote growth and survival. Secretory carrier membrane proteins (SCAMPs) are a family of transmembrane proteins that regulate recycling of receptor proteins, including EGFR. The potential role of SCAMPs in mutant EGFR function and tumorigenesis has not been elucidated. Using quantitative mass-spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics, we identified SCAMP3 as a target of mutant EGFRs in lung adenocarcinoma and sought to further investigate the role of SCAMP3 in the regulation of lung tumorigenesis. Here we show that activated EGFR, either directly or indirectly phosphorylates SCAMP3 at Y86 and this phosphorylation increases the interaction of SCAMP3 with both wild-type and mutant EGFRs. SCAMP3 knockdown increases lung adenocarcinoma cell survival and increases xenograft tumor growth in vivo, demonstrating a tumor suppressor role of SCAMP3 in lung tumorigenesis. The tumor suppressor function is a result of SCAMP3 promoting EGFR degradation and attenuating MAP kinase signaling pathways. SCAMP3 knockdown also increases multinucleated cells in culture, suggesting that SCAMP3 is required for efficient cytokinesis. The enhanced growth, increased colony formation, reduced EGFR degradation and multinucleation phenotype of SCAMP3-depleted cells were reversed by re-expression of wild-type SCAMP3, but not SCAMP3 Y86F, suggesting that Y86 phosphorylation is critical for SCAMP3 function. Taken together, the results of this study demonstrate that SCAMP3 functions as a novel tumor suppressor in lung cancer by modulating EGFR signaling and cytokinesis that is partly Y86 phosphorylation-dependent."
https://openalex.org/W3153312426,"A human neuroma-in continuity (NIC), formed following a peripheral nerve lesion, impedes functional recovery. The molecular mechanisms that underlie the formation of a NIC are poorly understood. Here we show that the expression of multiple genes of the Wnt family, including Wnt5a, is changed in NIC tissue from patients that underwent reconstructive surgery. The role of Wnt ligands in NIC pathology and nerve regeneration is of interest because Wnt ligands are implicated in tissue regeneration, fibrosis, axon repulsion and guidance. The observations in NIC prompted us to investigate the expression of Wnt ligands in the injured rat sciatic nerve and in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). In the injured nerve, four gene clusters were identified with temporal expression profiles corresponding to particular phases of the regeneration process. In the DRG up- and down regulation of certain Wnt receptors suggests that nerve injury has an impact on the responsiveness of injured sensory neurons to Wnt ligands in the nerve. Immunohistochemistry showed that Schwann cells in the NIC and in the injured nerve are the source of Wnt5a, whereas the Wnt5a receptor Ryk is expressed by axons traversing the NIC. Taken together, these observations suggest a central role for Wnt signalling in peripheral nerve regeneration."

This study aimed to map EPIC tool to EuroQoL-5D-3L (EQ5D) to generate EQ5D health utilities.This is a secondary analysis of a prospective, randomized non-inferiority clinical trial, conducted between 04/2006 and 12/2009 at cancer centers across the United States, Canada, and Switzerland. Eligible patients included men >18 years with a known diagnosis of low-risk PC. Patient HRQoL data were collected using EPIC and health utilities were obtained using EQ5D. Data were divided into an estimation sample (n = 765, 70%) and a validation sample (n = 327, 30%). The mapping algorithms that capture the relationship between the instruments were estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS), Tobit, and two-part models. Five-fold cross-validation (in-sample) was used to compare the predictive performance of the estimated models. Final models were selected based on root mean square error (RMSE).A total of 565 patients in the estimation sample had complete information on both EPIC and EQ5D questionnaires at baseline. Mean observed EQ5D utility was 0.90±0.13 (range: 0.28-1) with 55% of patients in full health. OLS models outperformed their counterpart Tobit and two-part models for all pre-determined model specifications. The best model fit was: ""EQ5D utility = 0.248541 + 0.000748*(Urinary Function) + 0.001134*(Urinary Bother) + 0.000968*(Hormonal Function) + 0.004404*(Hormonal Bother)- 0.376487*(Zubrod) + 0.003562*(Urinary Function*Zubrod)""; RMSE was 0.10462.This is the first study to identify a comprehensive set of mapping algorithms to generate EQ5D utilities from EPIC domain/ sub-domain scores.

https://openalex.org/W3154205148,"This study aims at developing and characterizing the puerarin dry powder inhaler (DPI) formulations for pulmonary delivery. The inhalable particles size (&lt;2 μm) was accomplished by micronization and its morphology was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The puerarin-excipient interaction in powder mixtures was analyzed by using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman confocal microscopy, X-Ray powder Diffraction (XRD), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) methods. Using a Twin stage impinger (TSI), the in-vitro aerosolization of the powder formulations was carried out at a flow rate of 60 L/min and the drug was quantified by employing a validated HPLC method. No significant interactions between the drug and the excipients were observed in the powder formulations. The fine particle fraction (FPF) of the drug alone was 4.2% which has increased five to six-fold for the formulations with aerosolization enhancers. Formulation containing lactose as large carriers produced 32.7% FPF, which further increased with the addition of dispersibility enhancers, leucine and magnesium stearate (40.8% and 41.2%, respectively). The Raman and FTIR techniques are very useful tool for understanding structural integrity and stability of the puerarin in the powder formulations. The puerarin was found to be compatible with the excipients used and the developed DPI formulation may be considered as an efficient formulation for pulmonary delivery for the management of various diseases at a very low dose."
https://openalex.org/W3154849221,"Equine bioenergetics have predominantly been studied focusing on glycogen and fatty acids. Combining omics with conventional techniques allows for an integrative approach to broadly explore and identify important biomolecules. Friesian horses were aquatrained (n = 5) or dry treadmill trained (n = 7) (8 weeks) and monitored for: evolution of muscle diameter in response to aquatraining and dry treadmill training, fiber type composition and fiber cross-sectional area of the M. pectoralis, M. vastus lateralis and M. semitendinosus and untargeted metabolomics of the M. pectoralis and M. vastus lateralis in response to dry treadmill training. Aquatraining was superior to dry treadmill training to increase muscle diameter in the hindquarters, with maximum effect after 4 weeks. After dry treadmill training, the M. pectoralis showed increased muscle diameter, more type I fibers, decreased fiber mean cross sectional area, and an upregulated oxidative metabolic profile: increased β-oxidation (key metabolites: decreased long chain fatty acids and increased long chain acylcarnitines), TCA activity (intermediates including succinyl-carnitine and 2-methylcitrate), amino acid metabolism (glutamine, aromatic amino acids, serine, urea cycle metabolites such as proline, arginine and ornithine) and xenobiotic metabolism (especially p-cresol glucuronide). The M. vastus lateralis expanded its fast twitch profile, with decreased muscle diameter, type I fibers and an upregulation of glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathway activity, and increased branched-chain and aromatic amino acid metabolism (cis-urocanate, carnosine, homocarnosine, tyrosine, tryptophan, p-cresol-glucuronide, serine, methionine, cysteine, proline and ornithine). Trained Friesians showed increased collagen and elastin turn-over. Results show that branched-chain amino acids, aromatic amino acids and microbiome-derived xenobiotics need further study in horses. They feed the TCA cycle at steps further downstream from acetyl CoA and most likely, they are oxidized in type IIA fibers, the predominant fiber type of the horse. These study results underline the importance of reviewing existing paradigms on equine bioenergetics."
https://openalex.org/W3156692145,"Introduction Seasonal influenza is a major global health problem causing substantial morbidity and health care costs. Yet, in many countries, the rates of influenza vaccination remain low. Chronic kidney or liver diseases (CKLD) predispose patients to severe influenza infections, but data on vaccination acceptance and status is limited in this risk population. We investigated the influenza vaccination awareness considering sociodemographic factors in CKLD patients. Patients and methods This cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study recruited CKLD patients managed at three Viennese tertiary care centers between July and October 2020. CKLD was defined as chronic kidney- (all stages) or compensated/decompensated liver disease, including kidney/liver transplant recipients. Questionnaires assessed sociodemographic and transplant- associated parameters, patients vaccination status and the individuals self-perceived risks of infection and associated complications. Results In total 516 patients (38.1% female, mean age 56.4 years) were included. 43.9% of patients declared their willingness to be vaccinated in the winter season 2020/2021, compared to 25.4% in 2019/2020 and 27.3% in 2016–2018. Vaccination uptake was associated with the self-perceived risks of infection (OR: 2.8 (95%CI: 1.8–4.5), p&lt;0.001) and associated complications (OR: 3.8 (95%CI: 2.3–6.3), p&lt;0.001) as well as with previously received influenza vaccination (2019/2020: OR 17.1 (95%CI: 9.5–30.7), p&lt;0.001; season 2016–2018: OR 8.9 (95%CI: 5.5–14.5), p&lt;0.001). Most frequent reasons for not planning vaccination were fear of a) graft injury (33.3%), b) complications after vaccination (32.4%) and c) vaccine inefficiency (15.0%). Conclusion While influenza vaccination willingness in patients with CKLD is increasing in the 2020/2021 season, vaccination rates may still remain &lt;50%. Novel co-operations with primary health care, active vaccination surveillance and financial reimbursement may substantially improve vaccination rates in high-risk CKLD patients."

Unexpectedly, however, we found that PC-iOPCs are metastable so that they can produce myelination-competent oligodendrocytes or revert to their original identity in a context-dependent fashion. Phenotypic reversion of PC-iOPCs is tightly linked to memory of their original transcriptome and epigenome. Phenotypic reversion can be disconnected from this donor cell memory effect, and in vivo myelination can eventually be achieved by transplantation of O4+ pre-oligodendrocytes.

Our data show that donor cell source and memory can contribute to the fate and stability of directly converted cells. Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) are resident progenitor cells distributed throughout the central nervous system (CNS). OPCs can differentiate into oligodendrocytes (OLs) that remyelinate axons after brain damage (Franklin and Ffrench-Constant, 2008Franklin R.J. Ffrench-Constant C.

Although transplanted mature OLs do not elicit axon remyelination, transplanted undifferentiated OPCs give rise to axon-myelinating OLs (Goldman, 2016Goldman S.A.

Therefore, a strong clinical interest lies in generating OPCs for regenerative therapy of myelin-associated diseases. Previous studies have reported that induced OPCs (iOPCs) can be generated from fibroblasts by ectopic expression of Olig2/Sox2/Nkx6.2 or Olig2/Sox10/Zfp536 (Najm et al., 2013Najm F.J. Lager A.M.

These iOPCs are functionally similar to primary OPCs (pOPCs); they can elicit axon myelination upon transplantation into the spinal cord or brain of congenitally hypomyelinated shiverer mice. However, iOPCs generated from mouse and rat embryonic fibroblasts display limited expansion and differentiation competence (Najm et al., 2013Najm F.J. Lager A.M. Zaremba A. Wyatt K. Caprariello A.V.

Furthermore, the reported iOPC generation efficiency is low. Hence, establishing a technically feasible method for circumventing these limitations may enhance development of iOPC-based applications. Seminal studies of the generation of cloned embryos and induced pluripotent stem cells have demonstrated that donor cell characteristics can profoundly affect the reprogramming process and quality of the resulting cells (Aasen et al., 2008Aasen T.

Faster and more efficient reprogramming can be achieved because of a lower requirement for epigenetic remodeling when converting one cell type into a closely related cell type and/or to a phenotype of the same germ layer (Bussmann et al., 2009Bussmann L.H.

On that basis, we reasoned that pericytes (PCs) could serve as an optimal cellular substrate for producing iOPCs because (1) PCs can be expanded at high cell numbers, (2) PCs exhibit profound phenotypic plasticity because they are able to differentiate into smooth muscle cells, and (3) PCs originate from neuroectoderm-derived neural crest cells, like pOPCs (Armulik et al., 2011Armulik A.

Furthermore, PCs have been shown to efficiently convert into induced neurons using only a few transcription factors (Karow et al., 2012Karow M. Sánchez R. Schichor C. Masserdotti G. Ortega F. Heinrich C. Gascón S. Khan M.A. Lie D.C.

Neurosci. 2018; 21: 932-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For this reason, we speculated that PCs might prove to be especially amenable to be reprogrammed, in particular to glial progenitor cells. If true, then PCs might allow facilitated direct conversion into myelinogenic iOPCs, which could eventually retain efficient expansion and differentiation competence. Here we demonstrate that retroviral transduction of Olig2 and Sox10 is sufficient for mediating highly efficient conversion of PCs into iOPCs. The resultant iOPCs display stable mitotic activity and high efficiency of OL differentiation. Thus, permissive donor cell characteristics, paired with optimal transcription factor combination, overcome the rate-limiting inefficiencies in expansion and differentiation of directly converted iOPCs. Intriguingly, however, we also discovered that some transplanted iOPCs can revert to their original identity, suggesting that reprogrammed iOPCs reside in a metastable state. This metastable state of iOPCs is closely linked to the presence of donor cell memory and transgene-mediated off-targets. These observations provide compelling evidence that directly converted cells retain donor cell memory, which can yield a metastable state that permits reversion to their parental phenotype. We isolated PCs from the cerebral microvasculature of adult mice using a protocol described previously (Tigges et al., 2012Tigges U. Welser-Alves J.V. Boroujerdi A. Milner R. A novel and simple method for culturing pericytes from mouse brain.Microvasc. Res. 2012; 84: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The isolated PCs consisted of a homogeneous population of rhomboid cells expressing PC-specific transcripts, including platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (Pdgfrb), Anpep, Rgs5, and Desmin (Figures 1A and S1A). The isolated PCs were devoid of all other primary brain cell types (neural, neuronal, glial, and endothelial cells), as assessed by immunofluorescence and PCR analyses (Figures S1B and S1C). 5-Ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation assays revealed that these isolated PCs could be passaged indefinitely, in contrast to concurrently raised mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), which rapidly ceased to proliferate with serial passaging (Figures 1B and S1D). The PCs displayed significant phenotypic plasticity; they could form vascular cords when they were co-cultured with endothelial cells (ECs) (Figure 1C). In response to serum, PCs could differentiate into smooth muscle cells, as indicated by acquisition of smooth muscle actin (SMA) expression and loss of NG2 and PDGFRB expression (Figures 1D and S1E), further manifesting their phenotypic plasticity and differentiation competence. As expected, neither PCs nor MEFs expressed OLIG2, SOX10, or NKX6.2 (Figures 1E, S1B, and S1C), nor were they immunoreactive for A2B5 (Figure 1A), which targets OL progenitors (Windrem et al., 2004Windrem M.S. Nunes M.C. Rashbaum W.K. Schwartz T.H. Goodman R.A. McKhann 2nd, G. Roy N.S. Goldman S.A. Fetal and adult human oligodendrocyte progenitor cell isolates myelinate the congenitally dysmyelinated brain.Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). However, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry analyses revealed that PCs expressed PDGFRA, a cardinal OPC marker besides NG2 (Figures 1A and 1F). Interestingly, phosphorylated PDGFRA, which could be detected in PCs but not in MEFs, was upregulated significantly by addition of platelet-derived growth factor-AA (PDGF-AA) (Figure 1G). This finding in particular attracted our attention because persistent PDGFRA activation by PDGF-AA supply is necessary for iOPC generation (Najm et al., 2013Najm F.J. Lager A.M. Zaremba A. Wyatt K. Caprariello A.V. Factor D.C. Karl R.T. Maeda T. Miller R.H. Tesar P.J. Transcription factor-mediated reprogramming of fibroblasts to expandable, myelinogenic oligodendrocyte progenitor cells.Nat.

Having established that PCs are plastic and proliferative and inherently display activated PDGFRA, we postulated that these features and similarities between PCs and OPCs might facilitate generation of iOPCs from PCs. To test this, we transduced MEFs and PCs with doxycycline-inducible lentiviruses containing Olig2, Sox10, and Nkx6.2 (3F) (Figure S2A). Consistent with previous reports (Najm et al., 2013Najm F.J. Lager A.M. Zaremba A. Wyatt K. Caprariello A.V. Factor D.C. Karl R.T. Maeda T. Miller R.H. Tesar P.J.

Barres B.A. Wernig M. Generation of oligodendroglial cells by direct lineage conversion.Nat. Biotechnol. 2013; 31: 434-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), doxycycline administration to 3F-transduced MEFs (3F-MEFs) resulted in formation of low numbers of A2B5+ OPC-like cells (Figures S2B–S2D). Interestingly, however, 3F-transduced PCs (3F-PCs) did not appear to undergo any morphological changes and did not exhibit A2B5 positivity, even when the expression levels of the transgenes were enhanced by increasing doxycycline concentrations (Figures S2B–S2D). Why PCs appear to be refractory toward iOPC conversion by a lentiviral system remains unknown. When introducing the 3F transgenes into PCs with a retroviral system (Figures 2A and 2B ), we found that PCs could convert to a strikingly homogeneous population of bipolar cells morphologically similar to pOPCs (Figure 2C). However, using the same approach, only a few 3F-MEFs adopted this OPC-like morphology (Figure 2C), even though the transgene expression levels were stoichiometrically equivalent between these conditions (Figures 2B and S2E). Consistent with the morphological assessment, flow cytometry analysis revealed that only 18% of 3F-MEFs were A2B5+ (Figures 2D and S2F). A striking 87% of 3F-PCs were A2B5+. Unlike A2B5+ PCs, which displayed homogeneous expression of PDFGRA, only 30% of A2B5+ MEFs were positive for PDGFRA (Figure 2E). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-purified A2B5+ cells were clearly morphologically distinct from the parental donor cells and presented as a homogeneous cell population of OPC-like cells that did not express PC-specific genes (Anpep, Des, and Pdgfrb) but did express OPC markers (Pdgfra, Cnp, and Plp) (Figures 2F and 2G). Most importantly, like A2B5+ 3F-MEFs, A2B5+ 3F-PCs could differentiate into OLs expressing myelin basic protein (MBP), a major and essential constituent of the myelin sheath, or into S100B+ type 2 astrocytes (Figure 2H). Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with the donor and resulting cell populations confirmed the purity of the starting PC and MEF populations and that PC/MEF-specific genes (Col5a1, Col8a2, Pdgfrb, etc.) were downregulated equally in 3F-PCs and 3F-MEFs (Figures 2I, S2G, and S2H). Consistent with the obtained yields, scRNA-seq analysis further revealed that 3F-PCs displayed a higher proportion of cells expressing OPC-specific transcripts (Ncald, Plp1, Pdgfra, etc.) compared with 3F-MEFs (Figures 2I, S2G, and S2H), confirming that PCs exhibit an overall higher competence for acquisition of the OPC fate in comparison with MEFs. Overall, these data show that the efficiency of generating iOPCs strongly depends on the donor cell type and that retroviral transduction of 3F into PCs is far superior in generating A2B5+ iOPCs in comparison with the lentiviral delivery system. Loss of mitotic potential of fibroblast-derived iOPCs is a major limitation for their potential application (Najm et al., 2013Najm F.J. Lager A.M. Zaremba A. Wyatt K. Caprariello A.V. Factor D.C. Karl R.T. Maeda T. Miller R.H. Tesar P.J. Transcription factor-mediated reprogramming of fibroblasts to expandable, myelinogenic oligodendrocyte progenitor cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2013; 31: 426-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar; Yang et al., 2013Yang N. Zuchero J.B. Ahlenius H. Marro S. Ng Y.H. Vierbuchen T. Hawkins J.S. Geissler R. Barres B.A. Wernig M. Generation of oligodendroglial cells by direct lineage conversion.Nat. Biotechnol. 2013; 31: 434-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). To address this issue, we next compared the expansion capacity of iOPCs generated from 3F-PCs (3F-PC iOPCs) with those generated from 3F-MEFs (3F-MEF iOPCs). We quantified the EdU incorporation rates of the respective iOPCs with increasing passages. The proportion of EdU+ 3F-MEF iOPCs fell dramatically from passage 3 (p3) to p6 (Figure S3A), consistent with the observation that their proliferative potential fell rapidly with increasing passages. In contrast, early-passaged 3F-PC iOPCs were highly proliferative, exhibiting much higher EdU incorporation rates (2 h, 49.0% ± 3.28%; 4 h, 53.9% ± 3.64%) than 3F-MEF iOPCs (Figures 3A and S3A). The proliferative capacity of 3F-PC iOPCs remained relatively stable; EdU incorporation rates fell only slightly during continuous passaging (Figure 3A). These data show that iOPCs generated from these two distinct donor cell types manifest different expansion capacities that reflect, in part, the expansion potential of the donor cells from which they are derived (Figures 1B and S1D). The expression of a set of OPC markers, including A2B5, NG2, O4, and proteolipid protein (PLP), remained stable in 3F-PC iOPCs for at least 15 passages (Figure 3B). Interestingly, however, although 3F-PC iOPCs could continue to proliferate, PLP expression was lost in these cells by p25 (Figure 3B). Loss of PLP expression proceeded far more rapidly in 3F-MEF iOPCs so that PLP was detectable at p3 but lost by p6 (Figure S3B). Importantly, loss of PLP expression coincided with inability of iOPCs to differentiate into OLs and astrocytes. For example, consistent with previous reports (Najm et al., 2013Najm F.J. Lager A.M. Zaremba A. Wyatt K. Caprariello A.V. Factor D.C. Karl R.T. Maeda T. Miller R.H. Tesar P.J.

Barres B.A. Wernig M. Generation of oligodendroglial cells by direct lineage conversion.Nat. Biotechnol. 2013; 31: 434-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), fewer than 2.5% of 3F-MEF iOPCs at p3 could differentiate into MBP+ iOLs (Figure S3C), and their differentiation efficiency decreased further at p6 (0.8% ± 0.76%). Although higher in absolute numbers in comparison with 3F-MEF iOPCs, the efficiency of differentiating 3F-PC iOPCs into MBP+ iOLs significantly decreased at p25 (p5, 4.1% ± 1.33%; p15, 3.5% ± 1.19%; p25, 0.4% ± 1.10%) (Figure 3C). Likewise, the numbers of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)+, myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG)+, and S100B+ cells decreased significantly at p25 (Figure 3C), indicating loss of differentiation competence toward OL and astrocyte fates. These data demonstrate that, regardless of the donor cell types used, iOPCs generated with 3F manifest limited phenotypic stability, reflected by their loss of PLP expression and differentiation potential with prolonged passaging. We speculated that the limited differentiation efficiency and phenotypic durability of 3F-iOPCs might be due to an unstable state of the systems-level gene expression that confers iOPC identity. We first considered that transgenes might be silenced over time. To test this, we performed qPCR with primers that could specifically distinguish endogenous and exogenous Olig2, Sox10, and Nkx6.2 transcripts. We found that the expression levels of exogenous Olig2, Sox10, and Nkx6.2 declined progressively with serial passaging (Figure 3D). Repression of these transgenes was the result of a gain of methylation at CpG sites of the 5′ long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter of the viral vector (Figure 3E). This gain of methylation was mediated by timely induction of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) (Figures 3F and 3G). Interestingly, expression of the endogenous Olig2 and Nkx6.2 genes was seen at early passages, but their expression decreased continuously in accordance with transgene repression (Figures 3D and 3H). Repression of transgenes and the unstable endogenous OPC state was also seen in 3F-MEF iOPCs (Figures S3D and S3E). These data suggest that iOPCs generated with 3F comprise transgene-dependent and incompletely reprogrammed cells. Their low efficiency of terminal differentiation and lack of phenotypic stability reflect the transient effectiveness of their reprogramming. We next considered that Nkx6.2 in the reprogramming cocktail might serve to counteract establishment and maintenance of the undifferentiated OPC state because Nkx6.2 supports not only activation of myelin genes but also the terminal differentiation of OPCs to mature myelinating OLs (Awatramani et al., 1997Awatramani R. Scherer S. Grinspan J. Collarini E. Skoff R. O’Hagan D. Garbern J. Kamholz J. Evidence that the homeodomain protein Gtx is involved in the regulation of oligodendrocyte myelination.J.

Olig2 regulates Sox10 expression in oligodendrocyte precursors through an evolutionary conserved distal enhancer.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: 1280-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we excluded Nkx6.2 from the reprogramming cocktail and transduced MEFs and PCs with viruses containing only Olig2 and Sox10 (2F) (Figure 4A). Despite efficient expression of the Olig2 and Sox10 transgenes (Figure S4A), 2F-transduced MEFs (2F-MEFs) retained their fibroblast morphology and failed to express the OPC marker A2B5 (Figures 4B and 4C). Strikingly, however, 2F-transduced PCs (2F-PCs) efficiently converted to a homogeneous population of OPC-like cells, of which more than 80% were A2B5+ (Figures 4B and 4C). scRNA-seq analysis further confirmed that, like 3F-PCs, 2F-PCs were highly efficient in transitioning toward the OPC fate, as determined by the major proportion of cells expressing OPC-specific transcripts (Figure 4D). Moreover, the proliferation rates of bipolar 2F-PC-derived iOPCs (2F-PC iOPCs) remained stable, and no apparent changes in OPC-like morphology and marker gene expression were observed for at least 25 passages (Figures 4E and 4F). Similar to 3F-PC iOPCs, transgene expression decreased over time in 2F-PC iOPCs as a result of a gain of CpG methylation at the 5′ LTR concurrent with timely induction of Dnmts (Figures 4G, S4B, and S4C). However, in contrast to 3F-PC iOPCs, 2F-PC iOPCs entered a self-sustaining state so that the expression levels of endogenous Olig2, Sox10, and Nkx6.2 increased dramatically and remained stable even when the transgenes became repressed continuously (Figures 4G and 4H). These data suggest that direct conversion of PCs with 2F alone is sufficient to generate an expanding pool of phenotypically stable and transgene-independent iOPCs. We next evaluated the differentiation capability and myelinogenic potential of 2F-PC iOPCs. Most strikingly, and like pOPCs, almost half of the 2F-PC iOPCs were able to differentiate into MBP+ iOLs regardless of their passage numbers (Figure 4I). 2F-PC iOPCs were equally efficient in differentiating MOG+, MAG+, and S100B+ cells (Figure S4D). More importantly, MBP-expressing iOLs could tightly ensheath not only multiple axons of primary dorsal root ganglion neurons (Figure 4J) but also multiple nanofibers, as visualized by immunofluorescence (Figures 4K and S4E). Electron microscopy analysis demonstrated that iOLs ensheathed nanofibers with multiple layers of myelin independent of the passage numbers of the parental 2F-PC iOPCs (Figure 4L). These data demonstrate that the decisive fate restriction of 3F-induced iOPCs, which include (1) expansion, (2) phenotypic durability, and (3) OL differentiation competence, can be overcome by transduction of an optimized transcription factor combination into a permissive donor cell type: the PC. In light of the superior functionality of 2F-PC iOPCs, we wanted to better understand how or why removal of Nkx6.2 from the 3F cocktail improves the quality of iOPCs. We analyzed the transcriptomes of PCs, 3F-PC iOPCs, 2F-PC iOPCs, and pOPCs obtained by RNA-seq. Differential gene expression (DGE; 14,520 genes at 5% false discovery rate [FDR]) analysis followed by unsupervised clustering resulted in 10 major gene clusters (Figures S5A and S5B), five of which displayed prominent DGE bet"

The analysis reveals a strong connection and a complementarity between the roles of premium subsidies in increasing producer participation in crop insurance, inducing a desired separating equilibrium in the presence of asymmetric information, and transferring income to agricultural producers participating in the program. Developing an alternative design of premium subsidies that can achieve the stated government objective of increased producer participation and induce any desired separating equilibrium at significantly reduced costs, our study rejects the idea that the income redistribution taking place under the current policy design is necessary for increasing producer participation in crop insurance. Indeed, the current policy design reveals that premium subsidies are either a means of income redistribution or a policy failure."

https://openalex.org/W3153988649,"Category-specific impairments witnessed in patients with semantic deficits have broadly dissociated into natural and artificial kinds. However, how the category of food (more specifically, fruits and vegetables) fits into this distinction has been difficult to interpret, given a pattern of deficit that has inconsistently mapped onto either kind, despite its intuitive membership to the natural domain. The present study explores the effects of a manipulation of a visual sensory (i.e., color) or functional (i.e., orientation) feature on the consequential semantic processing of fruits and vegetables (and tools, by comparison), first at the behavioral and then at the neural level. The categorization of natural (i.e., fruits/vegetables) and artificial (i.e., utensils) entities was investigated via cross–modal priming. Reaction time analysis indicated a reduction in priming for color-modified natural entities and orientation-modified artificial entities. Standard event-related potentials (ERP) analysis was performed, in addition to linear classification. For natural entities, a N400 effect at central channel sites was observed for the color-modified condition compared relative to normal and orientation conditions, with this difference confirmed by classification analysis. Conversely, there was no significant difference between conditions for the artificial category in either analysis. These findings provide strong evidence that color is an integral property to the categorization of fruits/vegetables, thus substantiating the claim that feature-based processing guides as a function of semantic category."

This study examines whether such practice may contribute to reinforce the valuation of these foods. Two experiments were conducted, one with children, the other with rats. The first study, conducted with first graders ( n = 214 ), shows that children who receive a food reward for performing a cognitive task subsequently value the food more compared to a control group who received the same food without performing any task. The second study, conducted on rats ( n = 64 ), shows that rewarding with food also translates into higher calorie intake over a 24-hour period. These results suggest that the common practice of rewarding children with calorie-dense sweet foods is a plausible contributing factor to obesity and might therefore be ill advised."
https://openalex.org/W3155439174,"Water availability in western Canada and the United States is dependent on the accumulation of snowpack in the montane regions and threatened by increased winter temperature and more precipitation as rain linked to climate change. In order to make reasoned decisions to adapt to climate change managers require knowledge of the role of temperature and precipitation in SWE development and data to distinguish the relative retention response of snowpack regions to expected temperature and precipitation regime shifts at the watershed scale. Using the Daymet interpolated 1 km 2 dataset, effects of elevation, temperature (T max , T min and T avg ) and precipitation on April 1 SWE in the Crown of the Continent were tested by linear regression and Kendall correlation. Changes in Daymet estimated snow water equivalent (SWE) in response to increased temperatures and changes in precipitation were estimated in two ways: 1) comparing April 1SWE in the 11 warmest (mean T max February) and driest (mean precipitation January to March) years with the 22 cooler/wetter years 1981–2013 and 2) SWE retention from April 1 to June 1 over the period 1980 to 2013 across 120 watersheds in a major continental headwater region, the Crown of the Continent of North America. Historical analysis of period warm year April 1 SWE was assumed to indicate the recent impact of warmer winter temperatures. Changes in snowpack April 1 to June 1 reflected likely effects on peak runoff and were, therefore, also relevant for future climate change adaptation considerations. Winter (JFM) precipitation proved more influential than temperature in shaping April 1 SWE response at the regional scale. Of the three factors, elevation was most positively associated with April 1 SWE at the watershed scale. Temperature and precipitation influenced SWE accumulation and persistence at the watershed scale, but higher precipitation was more closely associated with higher April 1 SWE retention. Ranking of watershed snowpack retention in warm and dry years, combined with spring snowpack retention offers data to assist identification of watersheds with greatest snowpack persistence in the face of anticipated climate change effects."

The investment trajectory or glide-path for a representative set of 14 assets of heterogeneous characteristics is studied during a 161 quarters long horizon. The expected returns are estimated by the GARCH(1,1), EGARCH(1,1), GJR-GARCH(1,1) models, and a stationary block bootstrap model is used as a benchmark for comparison. A fixed historical covariance matrix and a multi-period estimation of DCC-GARCH(1,1) are also considered as inputs of the objective function. Forecasts are evaluated through their asymmetric dependencies as quantified by the transfer entropy measure. In general, we find very similar glide-paths so that the overall structure of the investment is maintained and does not rely on the particular forecasting model. However, the GARCH(1,1) under a fixed historical covariance matrix exhibits the highest Sharpe ratio and in this sense represents the best trade-off between wealth and risk. As expected, the initial stages of the obtained glide-paths are initially dominated by risky assets and gradually transition into bonds towards the end oof the trajectory. Overall, the methodology proposed here is computationally efficient and displays the desired properties of a TDF strategy in realistic settings."

X-linked nonsyndromic hereditary hearing loss is associated with six loci (DFNX1-6) and five genes. Recently, the missense mutation (c.1771G&gt;A, p.Gly591Ser) in COL4A6 , encoding the basement membrane (BM) collagen α6(IV) chain, was shown to be associated with X-linked congenital nonsyndromic hearing loss with cochlear malformation. However, the mechanism by which the COL4A6 mutation impacts hereditary hearing loss has not yet been elucidated. Herein, we investigated Col4a6 knockout (KO) effects on hearing function and cochlear formation in mice. Immunohistochemistry showed that the collagen α6(IV) chain was distributed throughout the mouse cochlea within subepithelial BMs underlying the interdental cells, inner sulcus cells, basilar membrane, outer sulcus cells, root cells, Reissner’s membrane, and perivascular BMs in the spiral limbus, spiral ligament, and stria vascularis. However, the click-evoked auditory brainstem response analysis did not show significant changes in the hearing threshold of Col4a6 KO mice compared with wild-type (WT) mice with the same genetic background. In addition, the cochlear structures of Col4a6 KO mice did not exhibit morphological alterations, according to the results of high-resolution micro-computed tomography and histology. Hence, loss of Col4a6 gene expression in mice showed normal click ABR thresholds and normal cochlear formation, which differs from humans with the COL4A6 missense mutation c.1771G&gt;A, p.Gly591Ser. Therefore, the deleterious effects in the auditory system caused by the missense mutation in COL4A6 are likely due to the dominant-negative effects of the α6(IV) chain and/or α5α6α5(IV) heterotrimer with an aberrant structure that would not occur in cases with loss of gene expression."

https://openalex.org/W3156905196,"Background A paradigm shift in the disease management of type 2 diabetes is urgently needed to stem the escalating trends seen worldwide. A “glucocentric” approach to diabetes management is no longer considered a viable option. Qualitative strategies have the potential to unearth the internal psychological attributes seen in people living with diabetes that are crucial to the sustenance of self-management behaviour. This study aims to identify and categorize the innate psychological dispositions seen in people with type 2 diabetes in relation to self-management behaviour. Methods We adopted a grounded theory approach to guide in-depth interviews of individuals with type 2 diabetes and healthcare professionals (HCP) at a regional primary care clinic in Malaysia. Twenty-four people with type 2 diabetes and 10 HCPs were recruited into the study to examine the inner narratives about disease management. Two focus group discussions (FGD) were also conducted for data triangulation. Results Participants’ internal dialogue about the management of their disease is characterized by 2 major processes– 1) positive disposition and 2) negative disposition. Optimism, insight, and awareness are important positive values that influence T2D self-care practices. On the other hand, constructs such as stigma, worries, reservations, and pessimism connote negative dispositions that undermine the motivation to follow through disease management in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Conclusions We identified a contrasting spectrum of both constructive and undesirable behavioural factors that influence the ‘internal environment’ of people with type 2 diabetes. These results coincide with the constructs presented in other well-established health belief theories that could lead to novel behavioural change interventions. Furthermore, these findings allow the implementation of psychosocial changes that are in line with cultural sensitivities and societal norms seen in a specific community."
