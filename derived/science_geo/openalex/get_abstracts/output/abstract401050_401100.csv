https://openalex.org/W2090660388,"Honey bees (Apis mellifera) play a critical role in global food production as pollinators of numerous crops. Recently, honey bee populations in the United States, Canada, and Europe have suffered an unexplained increase in annual losses due to a phenomenon known as Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). Epidemiological analysis of CCD is confounded by a relative dearth of bee pathogen field studies. To identify what constitutes an abnormal pathophysiological condition in a honey bee colony, it is critical to have characterized the spectrum of exogenous infectious agents in healthy hives over time. We conducted a prospective study of a large scale migratory bee keeping operation using high-frequency sampling paired with comprehensive molecular detection methods, including a custom microarray, qPCR, and ultra deep sequencing. We established seasonal incidence and abundance of known viruses, Nosema sp., Crithidia mellificae, and bacteria. Ultra deep sequence analysis further identified four novel RNA viruses, two of which were the most abundant observed components of the honey bee microbiome (∼1011 viruses per honey bee). Our results demonstrate episodic viral incidence and distinct pathogen patterns between summer and winter time-points. Peak infection of common honey bee viruses and Nosema occurred in the summer, whereas levels of the trypanosomatid Crithidia mellificae and Lake Sinai virus 2, a novel virus, peaked in January."

However, prestin must be gated by changes in membrane potential on a cycle-by-cycle basis and the periodic component of the receptor potential may be greatly attenuated by low-pass filtering due to the OHC time constant (τm), questioning the functional relevance of this mechanism. Here, we measured τm from OHCs with a range of characteristic frequencies (CF) and found that, at physiological endolymphatic calcium concentrations, approximately half of the mechanotransducer (MT) channels are opened at rest, depolarizing the membrane potential to near −40 mV. The depolarized resting potential activates a voltage-dependent K+ conductance, thus minimizing τm and expanding the membrane filter so there is little receptor potential attenuation at the cell's CF. These data suggest that minimal τm filtering in vivo ensures optimal activation of prestin.

Cochlear amplification via prestin limited by outer hair cell (OHC) time constant Endolymph Ca2+ opens half the transduction channels, depolarizing OHC to −40 mV Depolarization activates K+ conductance, reduces time constant and expands filter Minimal membrane filtering in vivo ensures prestin activation over all frequencies Outer hair cells of the mammalian cochlea possess both sensory and motor functions, converting sound-induced vibrations of the basilar membrane into receptor potentials but also generating a mechanical output that augments motion of the basilar membrane and sharpens its frequency selectivity (Dallos, 1992Dallos P. The active cochlea.J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4575-4585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Fettiplace and Hackney, 2006Fettiplace R. Hackney C.M. The sensory and motor roles of auditory hair cells.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The motor capacity is often referred to as the cochlear amplifier for which two mechanisms have been proposed: somatic contractions and hair bundle motion. The rapid somatic contraction is attributable to the membrane protein prestin (Zheng et al., 2000Zheng J. Shen W. He D.Z. Long K.B. Madison L.D. Dallos P.

Active motion of the hair bundle results from opening and adaptation of the mechanotransducer (MT) channels. This second mechanism is prominent in frogs and turtles (Martin and Hudspeth, 1999Martin P. Hudspeth A.J. Active hair-bundle movements can amplify a hair cell's response to oscillatory mechanical stimuli.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 14306-14311Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, Ricci et al., 2000Ricci A.J. Crawford A.C. Fettiplace R. Active hair bundle motion linked to fast transducer adaptation in auditory hair cells.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7131-7142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but signs of it have also been seen in mammals (Chan and Hudspeth, 2005Chan D.K. Hudspeth A.J.

Crawford A.C. Fettiplace R. Force generation by mammalian hair bundles supports a role in cochlear amplification.Nature. 2005; 433: 880-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Several prestin mutants have been generated that reduce or abolish cochlear amplification (Liberman et al., 2002Liberman M.C. Gao J. He D.Z. Wu X. Jia S. Zuo J. Prestin is required for electromotility of the outer hair cell and for the cochlear amplifier.Nature. 2002; 419: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, Dallos et al., 2008Dallos P. Wu X.

A difficulty with the prestin hypothesis is that for it to implement feedback, it must be gated by changes in membrane potential on a cycle-by-cycle basis. However, the periodic component of the receptor potential may be greatly attenuated by low-pass filtering due to the OHC time constant, which has been reported to be at most a few hundred hertz (Housley and Ashmore, 1992Housley G.D.

This problem does not exist in the hair bundle motor for which the speed is limited only by the feedback loop involving the MT channels, which includes the kinetics of their activation and fast adaptation. Several ways of circumventing the membrane time constant limitation of the somatic contraction mechanism have been advanced (reviewed in Ashmore, 2008Ashmore J. Cochlear outer hair cell motility.Physiol. Rev. 2008; 88: 173-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) including gating of prestin by extracellular potentials (Dallos and Evans, 1995Dallos P. Evans B.N. High-frequency outer hair cell motility: corrections and addendum.Science. 1995; 268: 1420-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), by chloride influx evoked by stretch activation of the lateral membrane (Rybalchenko and Santos-Sacchi, 2003Rybalchenko V. Santos-Sacchi J. Cl-flux through a non-selective, stretch-sensitive conductance influences the outer hair cell motor of the guinea-pig.J. Physiol. 2003; 547: 873-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), or by considering current flow along the organ of Corti in a three-dimensional model (Mistrík et al., 2009Mistrík P. Mullaley C. Mammano F. Ashmore J. Three-dimensional current flow in a large-scale model of the cochlea and the mechanism of amplification of sound.J. R. Soc. Interface. 2009; 6: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). None of these has yet been validated experimentally. Because OHCs possess a large voltage-dependent K+ conductance (Housley and Ashmore, 1992Housley G.D. Ashmore J.F. Ionic currents of outer hair cells isolated from the guinea-pig cochlea.J. Physiol. 1992; 448: 73-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, Mammano and Ashmore, 1996Mammano F. Ashmore J.F. Differential expression of outer hair cell potassium currents in the isolated cochlea of the guinea-pig.J. Physiol. 1996; 496: 639-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), their time constant will depend on membrane potential and become smaller with activation of this conductance at depolarized potentials. Thus a crucial factor in determining the time constant for small perturbations is the OHC resting potential. The resting potential results largely from a balance between the two main ionic currents: an inward MT current and an outward voltage-dependent K+ current. MT currents in auditory hair cells display Ca2+-driven adaptation that dictates the fraction of the MT channels open at rest resulting in a sustained depolarizing current, which is larger when the hair bundles are exposed to low endolymphatic Ca2+ (Ricci et al., 1998Ricci A.J. Wu Y.C. Fettiplace R. The endogenous calcium buffer and the time course of transducer adaptation in auditory hair cells.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8261-8277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous estimates of the resting potential in OHCs have placed it at −60 to −70 mV (Mammano and Ashmore, 1996Mammano F. Ashmore J.F.

Kros C.J. Developmental expression of the potassium current IK,n contributes to maturation of mouse outer hair cells.J. Physiol. 1999; 520: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). OHC resting potentials have also been measured in intact animals and again the most common value is ∼−70 mV (Dallos, 1985aDallos P. Response characteristics of mammalian cochlear hair cells.J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 1591-1608PubMed Google Scholar, Russell et al., 1986Russell I.J. Cody A.R. Richardson G.P. The responses of inner and outer hair cells in the basal turn of the guinea-pig cochlea and in the mouse cochlea grown in vitro.Hear. Res. 1986; 22: 199-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Here, we report large ambient MT currents and receptor potentials in OHCs from acutely isolated cochleas. We measured τm from OHCs with different cochlear locations having CFs of 0.35–10 kHz. When hair bundles were exposed to endolymphatic Ca2+ (0.02 mM), about half of the mechanotransducer (MT) channels opened at rest, causing OHCs to depolarize to near −30 mV and, by activating a K+ conductance, lowered τm. After adjustment for conditions existing in vivo, including endolymphatic potential and temperature, we estimate resting potentials of −40 mV and time constants at least ten times smaller than those previously reported. We propose that the OHC membrane time constant has been significantly overestimated and therefore no real limitation on the function of prestin may exist in vivo. Local application to the OHC hair bundles of an endolymph-like solution, containing K+ as the monovalent cation and low, 0.02 mM Ca2+, had two effects on MT currents: it increased both the maximum current amplitude and the fraction of that current activated at rest (Figure 1). External Ca2+ is known to block the MT channels with a half-blocking concentration of 1 mM (Ricci and Fettiplace, 1998Ricci A.J. Fettiplace R. Calcium permeation of the turtle hair cell mechanotransducer channel and its relation to the composition of endolymph.J. Physiol. 1998; 506: 159-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, Beurg et al., 2010Beurg M. Nam J.H. Chen Q. Fettiplace R. Calcium balance and mechano-transduction in rat cochlear hair cells.J. Neurophysiol. 2010; 104: 18-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and the increased current amplitude in low Ca2+ stems from relief of this block. Moreover, the increased resting current in the presence of endolymphatic Ca2+ agrees with previous findings showing that when extracellular Ca2+ was increased it caused adaptation, thus closing some MT channels, whereas when Ca2+ influx was decreased, either by lowering its extracellular concentration or depolarizing to near the Ca2+ equilibrium potential, the open probability of the MT channels increased (Assad et al., 1989Assad J.A.

Neurophysiol. 2010; 104: 18-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The initial characterization of the MT current was performed from OHCs located in the apical region of the rat cochlea (CF = 4 kHz) at room temperature (Figures 1A and 1B). In these OHCs, the maximum MT current increased from 1.2 ± 0.1 nA (n = 5) in normal perilymph-like saline to 2.1 ± 0.1 nA (n = 7) in endolymph and the fraction of current at rest increased from 0.06 ± 0.01 to 0.46 ± 0.01 (n = 7). The increase in the MT channel resting open probability caused by the endolymph-like solution is attributable solely to the reduced Ca2+ concentration and not to the use of endolymphatic high K+, which could itself cause OHC depolarization if allowed to reach the cell's basolateral membrane. If the perfusate contained 0.02 Ca2+ and Na+ instead of K+, the fraction of current at rest in rat apical OHCs (0.46 ± 0.08, n = 6) was similar to that obtained with K+. This indicates that the perfusion of the endolymph-like K+ solution was restricted to the hair bundles. In either case the consequence was a large standing MT current in low Ca2+ and in the absence of stimulation. The presence of this standing inward current in the endolymph solution (0.94 ± 0.04 nA), which may be termed a “silent current” by analogy with the dark current in photoreceptors (Baylor et al., 1979Baylor D.A. Lamb T.D. Yau K.W. The membrane current of single rod outer segments.J. Physiol. 1979; 288: 589-611PubMed Google Scholar), meant that OHCs exhibited a significantly more depolarized membrane potential (−34 ± 3 mV, n = 7: p < 0.002) compared to that in perilymph (−51 ± 2 mV, n = 5). Because the MT current in OHCs has a reversal potential near 0 mV (Kros et al., 1992Kros C.J. Rüsch A. Richardson G.P. Mechano-electrical transducer currents in hair cells of the cultured neonatal mouse cochlea.Proc. Biol. Sci. 1992; 249: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, Beurg et al., 2006Beurg M. Evans M.G. Hackney C.M. Fettiplace R. A large-conductance calcium-selective mechanotransducer channel in mammalian cochlear hair cells.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 10992-11000Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), only a small electrical driving force exists in isolated preparations that lack the 90 mV endolymphatic potential. Nevertheless, substantial receptor potentials of 40–60 mV could be measured under current clamp conditions (Figures 1C and 1D). The mean receptor potential for a saturating stimulus was 51 ± 8 mV (n = 5) in perilymph and 42 ± 2 mV (n = 7) in endolymph. These responses were obtained for 0.1–0.2 μm maximum hair bundle displacements giving current-displacement relations that could be fit by a single Boltzmann (Figures 1E and 1F). Similar effects on the transduction current and receptor potential were also seen in OHCs of the isolated gerbil cochlea on exposing the hair bundles to endolymphatic Ca2+. MT currents measured at room temperature in the gerbil apex (CF = 0.35 kHz) increased from 0.67 ± 0.01 nA in normal 1.3 mM Ca2+ (n = 5) to 1.19 ± 0.05 nA in endolymph 0.02 mM Ca2+ (n = 7) and the fraction of current activated at rest increased under the same circumstance from 0.08 ± 0.01 to 0.43 ± 0.04. The increase in standing current in low Ca2+ was not attributable to activation of other conductances because it was fully abolished (Figures 2A and 2B) by addition of 0.2 mM dihydrostreptomycin (DHS), a known blocker of the OHC MT channel. In both gerbils and rats, the size of the MT current increased systematically with the CF of the OHC. Measurements were made at multiple cochlear locations, the CFs of which were interpolated from existing frequency maps for the two rodents (Müller, 1991Müller M. Developmental changes of frequency representation in the rat cochlea.Hear. Res. 1991; 56: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, Müller, 1996Müller M. The cochlear place-frequency map of the adult and developing Mongolian gerbil.Hear. Res. 1996; 94: 148-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The two animal species were chosen because they have different but overlapping frequency ranges, the gerbil from 0.2–35 kHz and the rat from 1–55 kHz. Examples of MT currents in low Ca2+ for the gerbil are shown in Figures 2A and 2B. In the presence of 0.02 Ca2+ and either Na+ or K+, apical-coil gerbil OHCs (0.9 kHz) exhibited a similar MT current (Na+: 1.56 ± 0.25 nA, n = 5; K+: 1.52 ± 0.16 nA, n = 5) and MT channel resting open probability (Na+: 0.46 ± 0.01, n = 5; K+: 0.45 ± 0.05 nA, n = 5), confirming that the effects seen in the presence of the endolymph-like solution are only due to the low Ca2+ concentration. Collected results (Figure 2C) demonstrate a continuous increase in the MT current across the two animal species that is dependent only on the CF. Thus the MT current in the middle region of the gerbil cochlea (CF = 2.5 kHz) is very similar to that near the apex of the rat cochlea (CF = 4 kHz), both being measured at the same holding potential (−84 mV). Overall there was about a 3-fold increase in MT current as the CF increased from 0.35 to 10 kHz. An increase in the size of the MT current along the tonotopic axis has also been reported in the gerbil hemi cochlea (He et al., 2004He D.Z. Jia S. Dallos P. Mechanoelectrical transduction of adult outer hair cells studied in a gerbil hemicochlea.Nature. 2004; 429: 766-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Despite the change in current amplitude, the fraction activated at rest (the resting Popen) in low Ca2+ was invariant with CF and had a mean of 0.46 ± 0.03 (Figure 2D). As a consequence the silent current increased in parallel with the maximum MT current. The fraction of MT current on at rest depended not only on extracellular Ca2+ around the hair bundle but also the nature and concentration of the mobile intracellular Ca2+ buffer (Ricci et al., 1998Ricci A.J. Wu Y.C. Fettiplace R. The endogenous calcium buffer and the time course of transducer adaptation in auditory hair cells.J.

Neurophysiol. 2010; 104: 18-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). BAPTA (1 mM) had been used so far because its properties theoretically match those of the endogenous Ca2+ buffer (Beurg et al., 2010Beurg M. Nam J.H. Chen Q. Fettiplace R. Calcium balance and mechano-transduction in rat cochlear hair cells.J. Neurophysiol. 2010; 104: 18-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), which in OHCs consists of 2 mM oncomodulin plus 0.25 mM calbindin-28K with no significant apex to base gradient (Hackney et al., 2005Hackney C.M. Mahendrasingam S. Penn A. Fettiplace R. The concentrations of calcium buffering proteins in mammalian cochlear hair cells.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 7867-7875Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To provide experimental support for this, perforated patch recordings were performed on apical OHCs of rats, P9–P11, at which age the oncomodulin concentration is similar to that in the adult (Yang et al., 2004Yang D. Thalmann I. Thalmann R. Simmons D.D. Expression of alpha and beta parvalbumin is differentially regulated in the rat organ of Corti during development.J. Neurobiol. 2004; 58: 479-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, Hackney et al., 2005Hackney C.M. Mahendrasingam S. Penn A. Fettiplace R. The concentrations of calcium buffering proteins in mammalian cochlear hair cells.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 7867-7875Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). With whole cell recording using 1 mM EGTA (Figures 3A and 3C), exposure to the low Ca2+ endolymph increased the MT current amplitude, as with 1 mM BAPTA, but produced only a small change in the fraction of current turned on at rest (mean = 0.12 ± 0.02, n = 5). Under perforated-patch conditions (Figures 3B and 3D), where mobile proteins such as the Ca2+ buffers are not washed out, the mean MT channel open resting probability in five OHCs increased from 0.04 ± 0.02 in 1.5 mM Ca2+ to 0.42 ± 0.03 in 0.02 mM Ca2+. The values obtained with perforated patch did not differ significantly from those obtained in low Ca2+ using whole-cell with 1mM intracellular BAPTA in response to either fluid jet (0.43 ± 0.03; Figure 2D) or step stimuli (0.40 ± 0.08) (Beurg et al., 2010Beurg M. Nam J.H. Chen Q. Fettiplace R. Calcium balance and mechano-transduction in rat cochlear hair cells.J. Neurophysiol. 2010; 104: 18-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The latter method of hair bundle stimulation also allowed estimates of the adaptation time constant that, as reported previously (Beurg et al., 2010Beurg M. Nam J.H. Chen Q. Fettiplace R. Calcium balance and mechano-transduction in rat cochlear hair cells.J. Neurophysiol. 2010; 104: 18-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), were slowed in the low Ca2+ endolymph and were 0.6 ± 0.03 ms (EGTA), 0.5 ± 0.05 ms (BAPTA), and 1.4 ± 0.4 ms (perforated patch). The slower time constant in perforated patch may largely reflect a greater series resistance (see Experimental Procedures). In order to measure the effects of low endolymphatic Ca2+ on membrane time constant and resting potential, current clamp experiments were performed at body temperature on OHCs from isolated gerbil cochleas at around the onset of hearing (P11–P13). These experiments reinforced the findings that exposing the hair bundles and transduction apparatus to low (0.02 mM) Ca2+ caused a depolarization of the OHC (Figures 4A and 4B) to −34 ± 4 mV (n = 5). The procedure was fully reversible on returning to high (1.3 mM) Ca2+, excluding the possibility that the observed changes in membrane potential were due to cell deterioration during the course of the recordings. The resting potential in the presence of 0.2 mM DHS, the MT channel blocker, was more hyperpolarized (−62 ± 2 mV, n = 9) than in high Ca2+ (−50 ± 2 mV, n = 15: Figure 4B), suggesting that the small fraction of channels open at rest (0.08: from gerbil OHCs) in high Ca2+ was sufficient to evoke some cell depolarization. The resting membrane potential in the presence of DHS was not significantly different from that obtained when MET channels were mechanically shut off (−61.3 ± 2.0, n = 5, Figures 2A and 2B) or when hair bundles were superfused with a Ca2+-free solution (−63.5 ± 2.0, n = 5), a condition that abolishes the MET current (Crawford et al., 1991Crawford A.C. Evans M.G. Fettiplace R. The actions of calcium on the mechano-electrical transducer current of turtle hair cells.J. Physiol. 1991; 434: 369-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). This further supports our hypothesis that the depolarized membrane potential of OHCs results from the resting MET current and not a nonspecific leak. A consequence of the depolarized resting potential in low Ca2+ was a reduction in the membrane time constant (τm) that was derived from current-clamp recordings of the voltage responses (V) to a small current step (I) at around the resting membrane potential. The time course of the voltage onsets can be described by: V = IRm(1 − exp (−t/τm)) where Rm is the membrane resistance and t is time. τm was derived from fits to these onsets (Figure 4A), and at the cochlear apex, was found to decrease from 2.2 ± 0.3 ms (n = 15) in 1.3 mM Ca2+ to 0.6 ± 0.1 ms (n = 5) in 0.02 mM Ca2+. When the MT channels were blocked with 0.2 mM DHS, the resting potential hyperpolarized and τm increased to 5.3 ± 0.1 ms (n = 9). The membrane time constant behaves like a single-pole low-pass filter with a half-power or corner frequency, F0.5, equal to 1/2πτm. Thus factors that reduce τm increase F0.5 and expand the frequency range at which OHCs can operate; lowering the Ca2+ concentration in the solution bathing the hair bundle reduces τm and increases F0.5 whereas blocking the MT channels increases τm and lowers F0.5 (Figure 4C). Strikingly, when OHCs were examined in low Ca2+ at other cochlear locations with higher CFs, the voltage responses to current steps had faster onsets and smaller values for τm, resulting in higher corner frequencies (Figure 4D). This observation suggests that the corner frequency of the OHC membrane varies with the CF of the cell. The results so far were obtained in isolated preparations in which the conditions still differ from those in vivo. Although account has been taken of the endolymph composition and the temperature, there exists in vivo a 90 mV potential (Bosher and Warren, 1971Bosher S.K. Warren R.L. A study of the electrochemistry and osmotic relationships of the cochlear fluids in the neonatal rat at the time of the development of the endocochlear potential.J. Physiol. 1971; 212: 739-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) across the hair cell epithelium between the endolymphatic and perilymphatic compartments. An endolymphatic potential will augment the driving force on current flow through the MT channels and aid with depolarization. Furthermore, although the MT current has attained its full size prior to the onset of hearing (Kennedy et al., 2003Kennedy H.J. Evans M.G. Crawford A.C. Fettiplace R.

One important property is the spectrotemporal contrast in the acoustic environment: the variation in sound pressure in each frequency band, relative to the mean pressure. We show that neurons in ferret auditory cortex rescale their gain to partially compensate for the spectrotemporal contrast of recent stimulation. When contrast is low, neurons increase their gain, becoming more sensitive to small changes in the stimulus, although the effectiveness of contrast gain control is reduced at low mean levels. Gain is primarily determined by contrast near each neuron's preferred frequency, but there is also a contribution from contrast in more distant frequency bands. Neural responses are modulated by contrast over timescales of ∼100 ms.

By using contrast gain control to expand or compress the representation of its inputs, the auditory system may be seeking an efficient coding of natural sounds. We find evidence for spectrotemporal contrast gain control in auditory cortex Gain is determined by a combination of spectrally local and global contrast Within a limited range, mean stimulus level also affects neural gain Contrast gain control is fast (∼100 ms); gain decreases are faster than increases The brain must be able to detect and represent both small and large changes in sound level. Not only do we experience a wide range of sound levels, from the quietness of a night in the forest to the hooting drama of crossing a street, but the important sensory information within these contexts may lie either in small or large deviations from the average sound. For example, detecting a subtle increase in the loudness of an approaching car's engine in a mostly constant background of traffic noise can be just as crucial as hearing a pronounced honk. This highlights a fundamental challenge for the auditory system: using neurons with limited dynamic range, the system has to represent large changes in sounds that are highly variable (high contrast), without losing the ability to represent subtle changes in sounds whose level is relatively constant (low contrast). One way of managing a range of contrasts is to use separate circuits to process stimuli with different statistics. However, maintaining such a division-of-labor strategy across a sensory pathway requires a potentially costly duplication of resources. A more efficient solution is contrast gain control—where the responsiveness of neurons is dynamically adjusted according to the contrast of recent stimulation. Considerable evidence suggests that the mammalian visual system uses contrast gain control (Shapley and Victor, 1978Shapley R.M. Victor J.D. The effect of contrast on the transfer properties of cat retinal ganglion cells.J. Physiol. 1978; 285: 275-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) so that it can operate in both high- and low-contrast environments. This mechanism is well described by “divisive normalization,” whereby the range of visual input is adjusted according to the contrast of recent visual stimulation (Heeger, 1992Heeger D.J. Normalization of cell responses in cat striate cortex.Vis. Neurosci. 1992; 9: 181-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1412) Google Scholar, Carandini et al., 1997Carandini M. Heeger D.J. Movshon J.A.

The suppressive field of neurons in lateral geniculate nucleus.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 10844-10856Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In the auditory system, several studies have investigated the effects of temporal (i.e., within-band) contrast on neural responses and have provided evidence both for gain control and for multiple independent circuits. A simple way of controlling temporal contrast is to vary the modulation depth of sinusoidally amplitude-modulated tones; neurons from the auditory nerve (Joris and Yin, 1992Joris P.X. Yin T.C. Responses to amplitude-modulated tones in the auditory nerve of the cat.J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 1992; 91: 215-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) to the auditory cortex (Malone et al., 2007Malone B.J. Scott B.H. Semple M.N. Dynamic amplitude coding in the auditory cortex of awake rhesus macaques.J. Neurophysiol. 2007; 98: 1451-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) can rescale their gain to partially compensate for reduced modulation depths. Similar effects have been found in the inferior colliculus (IC) (Kvale and Schreiner, 2004Kvale M.N. Schreiner C.E. Short-term adaptation of auditory receptive fields to dynamic stimuli.J. Neurophysiol. 2004; 91: 604-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, Dean et al., 2005Dean I. Harper N.S. McAlpine D. Neural population coding of sound level adapts to stimulus statistics.Nat.

Temporal processing and adaptation in the songbird auditory forebrain.Neuron. 2006; 51: 845-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) when the temporal contrast of more complex stimuli is altered. Such gain changes improve the efficiency with which neurons encode frequently presented levels (Dean et al., 2005Dean I. Harper N.S. McAlpine D. Neural population coding of sound level adapts to stimulus statistics.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1684-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Other studies have found that mean firing rates of IC neurons can have nonmonotonic dependencies on spectrotemporal contrast, while retaining their spectrotemporal preferences (Escabí et al., 2003Escabí M.A. Miller L.M. Read H.L. Schreiner C.E. Naturalistic auditory contrast improves spectrotemporal coding in the cat inferior colliculus.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 11489-11504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar tuning of mean firing rate to spectral contrast (measured across frequency, but not across time) has been reported in auditory cortex (Barbour and Wang, 2003Barbour D.L. Wang X. Contrast tuning in auditory cortex.Science. 2003; 299: 1073-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These findings suggest a division-of-labor strategy. However, such effects are also compatible with contrast gain control, so long as gain changes are slow (compared to spike generation) or do not completely compensate for changes in contrast. In this study, we ask whether the mammalian auditory cortex adjusts neural gain according to the spectrotemporal contrast of recent stimulation. One possibility is that neurons' responses are invariant to the statistics of recent stimulation, suggesting that the problem is ignored. Alternatively, neurons may be informative only about stimuli with a particular contrast, suggesting a division-of-labor strategy. Finally, they may undergo more complex changes in their spectrotemporal tuning as contrast varies, suggesting a reallocation of resources in the auditory system. Tuning of auditory cortical neurons has been shown to depend on stimulus context, such as tone density (Blake and Merzenich, 2002Blake D.T. Merzenich M.M. Changes of AI receptive fields with sound density.J. Neurophysiol. 2002; 88: 3409-3420Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), stimulus bandwidth (Gourévitch et al., 2009Gourévitch B. Noreña A.

Cortex. 2009; 19: 1448-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and the history of recent stimulation (Ahrens et al., 2008Ahrens M.B. Linden J.F. Sahani M. Nonlinearities and contextual influences in auditory cortical responses modeled with multilinear spectrotemporal methods.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 1929-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To distinguish between these hypotheses, we designed a set of stimuli where the statistics of level variations could be controlled within individual frequency bands. This allowed us to measure the spiking responses of neurons in the auditory cortex to sounds with different means and contrasts, from which we estimated spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs), using both linear (deCharms et al., 1998deCharms R.C.

We also sought to quantify which combination of stimulus statistics might inform cortical gain control. This requires a formal definition of the contrast of a sound. In the visual system, the contrast of a simple stimulus is defined as the ratio of the intensity difference to the mean intensity (c=ΔI/I); this definition can be generalized to complex stimuli as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean (c=σI/μI). In principle, the same definitions can be applied directly in the auditory system. However, it is normal to describe sounds using sound pressure level (SPL), L=20log10(p/pREF), rather than (RMS) pressure, p, itself. The effect of this log transform is that the standard deviation of the SPL of a sound (σL) can provide an excellent approximation of the contrast, σP/μP, of the sound pressure:c=σPμP≈a.σL+b(1) Thus, an auditory contrast gain mechanism would adjust neural gain according to σL, the standard deviation of the SPL of recent stimulation. Finally, we investigated whether gain control is a local or a network mechanism. If a neuron's gain depends only on the statistics of the stimuli presented within its STRF, then gain control could be implemented locally, e.g., by synaptic depression within individual neurons (Carandini et al., 2002Carandini M. Heeger D.J. Senn W. A synaptic explanation of suppression in visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10053-10065PubMed Google Scholar). However, synaptic depression is unlikely to account for gain effects that result from the statistics of stimuli outside the STRF, in which case gain control is more likely to arise from network mechanisms, such as the leveraging of balanced excitation and inhibition (e.g., Mante et al., 2005Mante V. Frazor R.A. Bonin V. Geisler W.S. Carandini M. Independence of luminance and contrast in natural scenes and in the early visual system.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1690-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). We therefore changed the stimulus contrast both inside and outside narrow frequency bands in our stimuli, in order to assess whether neuronal sensitivity to small changes in a sound depends on the statistics of its spectrally local or more global context. We recorded from 1840 sites in the primary auditory cortex (A1) and anterior auditory field (AAF) of eight anesthetized ferrets, while diotically presenting dynamic random chord (DRC) sequences. The chords were changed within each sequence every 25 ms, with the levels of their constituent tones (1/6 octave spaced) drawn from uniform distributions in SPL space. The contrast of the sequences was manipulated by changing the (SPL) standard deviation (σL) of these distributions. The tone level distributions had identical mean (μL = 40 dB SPL) but different widths: ± 5 dB (low contrast; σL ≈2.9 dB, c = σP/μP = 33%), ± 10 dB (medium contrast; σL ≈5.8 dB, c = σP/μP = 63.8%), or ± 15 dB (high contrast; σL ≈8.7 dB, c = σP/μP = 91.6%) (Figure 1). The close relationship between contrast in sound pressure (σP/μP) and σL for these distributions is shown in Figures S1A and S1B; these, together with other stimulus statistics, are documented in Table S1. As these distributions are primarily defined in SPL space, and as we performed analyses on units' stimulus-response relationships using stimulus representations in SPL space, we present our data and models here in terms of σL rather than σP/μP, so as not to mix together the sound pressure and level domains. The RMS sound level of the total stimulus ranged from 70 to 80 dB SPL. We identified 1001 units that responded reliably to the DRCs, as measured via a maximum noise level criterion (see Experimental Procedures). Although the anesthetized preparation allowed for precise control of stimulation and eliminated the possibility of attentional modulation, to confirm that the observations made under anesthesia apply in awake animals, we also presented the same stimuli through a free-field speaker to an awake, passively listening ferret and recorded spiking activity from 62 sites in A1 and AAF. We identified 19 units that responded reliably to the DRCs. We found no differences in the response characteristics of neurons in the two preparations and therefore combined these data in subsequent analyses. We first asked whether the tuning of cortical neurons is affected by changes in stimulus contrast. If this were the case, it would not be appropriate to describe such a response as gain control. We characterized the tuning of each unit by estimating one STRF for each contrast condition (e.g., Figure 2A ; see Model 1 in Table S2). Only STRFs that had predictive power (see Experimental Procedures) were included in the further analysis; generally, the prediction scores were worse under lower-contrast stimulation (Table S3). Changing stimulus contrast produced only small changes in STRF shape (Figures 2C and 2D). Of 261 units with predictive STRFs, 223 maintained the same best frequency (BF) across conditions (within 1/6 of an octave; Figure 2C). Twenty-six units had STRFs that were too diffuse to give clear BF estimates. Only 12 units showed evidence of changes (≤1/3 octave) in BF across conditions. Tuning bandwidths were slightly broader under low-contrast stimulation (sign-rank test; p << 0.001); however, this may reflect the noisier estimates of STRF coefficients at low contrast. Tuning bandwidth did not change systematically between medium- and high-contrast regimes (p > 0.5) (Figure 2D). We also observed no systematic changes in the temporal structure of STRFs, though this was limited by the 25 ms time resolution of the analysis. To assess the importance of any unmeasured STRF shape changes, we modeled each neuron by a single linear STRF multiplied by a variable gain factor (Model 2 in Table S2). STRFs from one stimulus condition predicted responses in the other conditions as well as the within-condition STRFs (Figure 2F), indicating that any shape changes in the STRFs were negligible. Thus, auditory cortex neurons exhibit similar spectrotemporal preferences regardless of contrast. This is similar to previous observations in the IC (Escabí et al., 2003Escabí M.A. Miller L.M. Read H.L. Schreiner C.E. Naturalistic auditory contrast improves spectrotemporal coding in the cat inferior colliculus.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 11489-11504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but different from the visual system, where contrast has a considerable effect on the temporal dynamics of neural responses (Mante et al., 2005Mante V. Frazor R.A. Bonin V. Geisler W.S. Carandini M. Independence of luminance and contrast in natural scenes and in the early visual system.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1690-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). We observed substantial changes in gain between conditions, as measured by comparing the largest-magnitude coefficients of the STRFs (Figure 2E). To characterize gain changes more accurately, we extended the simple linear model to a LN one (Figures 1G and 3; Equation 5; Model 3 in Table S2). This comprised a single linear STRF for each unit, estimated from its responses across all conditions, followed by a sigmoidal output nonlinearity. Separate nonlinearities were fitted for each contrast condition. The LN model far outperformed the linear models: prediction scores were a median 38.5% higher than the within-condition linear models (p << 0.001; sign-rank). We found 315 units where LN models were predictive in all three contrast conditions. Analyses on the remaining units are presented in Figure S3G, showing results similar to those presented below. In an LN model, differences in gain manifest through changes in the shape of the output nonlinearity. To quantify these changes, we calculated the set of linear transformations required to map the output nonlinearity for high-contrast stimulation (σL = 8.7 dB, c = 92%) onto those for other stimulus conditions. In principle, this mapping could combine a scaling of the curve along the horizontal and vertical axes and a translation of the curve along these axes (x- and y-offset, respectively). However, none of the units under investigation operated near their saturation point, making an estimate of vertical scaling difficult. Thus, we measured changes in the remaining three degrees of freedom (Equation 6; Model 4 in Table S2). Horizontal scaling corresponds to a change in gain, x-offset to a threshold shift and y-offset to a change in minimum firing rate. We observed a robust relationship between stimulus contrast and gain across the population of units. An approximately 3-fold decrease in contrast from 8.7 dB (c = 92%) to 2.9 dB (c = 33%) increased gain by a median factor of 2.01; for an ∼1.5-fold decrease in contrast from 8.7 dB (c = 92%) to 5.8 dB (c = 64%), gain increased by 1.34× (Figure 4A ). The gain effect was also strongest among units with the most robust, repeatable spike trains (Figure S3D). Gain therefore changes in the appropriate direction to compensate for changes in stimulus contrast, but this compensation is not complete. Decreasing stimulus contrast also caused nonlinearities to shift by a small amount to the right (median x-offset of 5.5% and 1.4% for low and medium contrast; p < 0.001 and p < 0.05, respectively, sign-rank test; Figure 4B), but there was no corresponding vertical translation of these curves (Figure 4C). Although the change in x-offset is nominally indicative of a small increase in threshold, the gain and x-offset measures were correlated with each other across units (r2 = 0.195 in high-to-low- and 0.11 in high-to-medium-contrast curve transformations; Figure 4D), suggesting that the rightwards shift in curves partly acts to compensate for gain (see Figure S3E). The lack of systematic y-offset changes indicated that minimum firing rate did not change across conditions. Therefore, the primary consequence of decreasing stimulus contrast is that cortical cells increase their gain. By transforming output nonlinearities across conditions, we could predict neural responses to each contrast stimulus as successfully as by using separate nonlinearities for each condition as described above (median difference in prediction scores of 0.7%; sign-rank, p > 0.5). These effects are similar to the changes in coding accuracy previously observed in the IC (Dean et al., 2005Dean I. Harper N.S. McAlpine D. Neural population coding of sound level adapts to stimulus statistics.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1684-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Neuronal firing is most sensitive to and hence most informative about stimulus changes when the slope of the input/output function is at its greatest. This occurs at a median position of X⋅v = 5.3, 10.1, and 14.3 under low, medium, and high contrast, respectively (Figure S2). These lie at approximately the same percentile (∼70%) of each stimulus distribution, relative to their projection onto X⋅v. Neurons in auditory cortex thus adapt their sensitivity to be most informative about stimuli within the current stimulus distribution. To fully quantify the relationship between stimulus contrast and gain, we presented to a subset of these cells a larger set of DRCs with eight different σL values ranging from 1.4 dB to 11.5 dB (c = 17% to 116%). We obtained 80 units for which the above analysis could be performed over the whole contrast range. On average, these showed a clear, monotonic increase in gain as the contrast of the stimulus was reduced (Figure 4E). The relationship between relative gain and contrast was extremely well described by a standard normalization equation (Heeger, 1992Heeger D.J. Normalization of cell responses in cat striate cortex.Vis. Neurosci. 1992; 9: 181-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1412) Google Scholar, Carandini et al., 1997Carandini M. Heeger D.J. Movshon J.A. Linearity and normalization in simple cells of the macaque primary visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8621-8644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar):G(σL)=a1+bσLn(2) where G denotes the gain and a, b, and n are constants (see Model 5 in Table S2). This model explained 99.9% of the variance in the population average of relative gain values. This model also provided a good description of the relative gain values for individual units (Figure S3H). However, in some units, the model failed at the lowest contrasts. For these units, gain increased as contrast was reduced down to a threshold, below which gain either leveled off or decreased. For 46/80 units, this threshold was σL = 2.9 dB (c = 33%); for a further 26 units, this threshold was 4.3 dB (c = 49%); and a further four units had a threshold of σL = 5.8 dB (c = 64%). At these thresholds and above, gain was well fit on a cell-by-cell basis by Equation 2 for 76/80 units. The model produced marginally better predictions of neural responses than fitting individual nonlinearities to each contrast condition (Table S2). Thus, across a wide range of contrasts, gain normalization is a robust phenomenon for individual units. In the experiments presented so far, the mean SPL of each tone in the DRC, μL, was kept fixed. To explore the effect of mean, we presented a further set of stimuli in which both the mean of the level distributions (μL) and the contrast (σL) were manipulated independently. We estimated LN models from responses to a range of mean/contrast conditions, together with curve transformations from each stimulus condition relative to the μL = 40 dB SPL, σL = 8.7 dB (c = 92%) nonlinearity. Of the 1001 units above, 56 units yielded predictive LN models across the whole range of conditions. Only data from these 56 units are analyzed below, in order to maintain the same sample set across stimulus conditions. Nevertheless, data from all units where LN models were predictive in only a subset of conditions (n = 217) yielded similar results (data not shown). At all mean levels tested, decreasing contrast caused gain to increase across the population of cells. However, the degree of gain normalization depended on the mean level: at low μL, reducing contrast did not yield as much compensatory gain change compared with reducing contrast at high μL. While increasing μL therefore increased the dependence of gain on contrast, this trend saturated above μL ≈35 dB SPL (Figure 5A ). At higher mean levels, gain was decoupled from the mean sound level and varied with contrast alone. Interestingly, although changing mean level had no systematic effect on x-offset in our data (Figure 5B), reducing the mean level typically increased y-offset, i.e., raised the minimum firing rate (Figure 5C; examples in Figures S4A and S4B). Given the success of Equation 2 in modeling the relationship between σL and gain, we extended this model to include mean level, μL. The most explanatory model (Equation 8) was a simple extension of the contrast-dependent model where b could vary with μL. This allows μL to directly modulate the dependence of gain on contrast. Fitted values for b(μL) are presented in Figure 5D, showing that at low μL, b is modulated by μL, whereas b saturates with high μL. For simplicity, we modeled this with an exponential function (Equation 8; see also Model 6 in Table S2). This model explained 97% of the total variance in the data set (Figure 5E). We did not estimate the parameters for individual units, and therefore did not cross-validate this model. All of the above results remained unchanged when gain was expressed as a function of σP/μP rather than σL (Figure S4C). The above results suggest that the recent spectrotemporal statistics of the stimulus modulate neural responses to a sound. We predicted that if a particular sound was presented in a low-contrast context, it would generate stronger responses than if presented in high-contrast context. To test this prediction, we embedded a fixed “test sound” into DRC segments of differing contrasts. This sound was designed to drive all units within an electrode penetration, by having stimulus energy within the receptive fields of the units recorded there (Figure 6A ). The different contexts were provided by a DRC sequence that alternated between high (σL = 8.7 dB, c = 92%) and low contrast (σL = 2.9 dB, c = 33%) every 1 s. The same test sound was presented once per 1 s block at a random time relative to the onset of that block, i.e., the last switch in context. Among 63 units that responded reliably to the test sound, all but two responded more vigorously when this sound was presented in a low-contrast context than in a high-contrast context; the firing rate was a median 2.6 times greater in low-contrast context (p ≪ 0.001, sign-rank; Figures 6B–6D). This confirmed our prediction. This experiment also allowed a finer-grained comparison of the time course of responses in high and low context. Similar to the STRF analysis, we found no systematic difference between these (Figure S5). The variable timing of the test sound relative to the time of context switch allowed us to estimate the time course of the adaptation to stimulus contrast (Figure 6E). This could, in turn, inform a time-dependent model of gain control (e.g., Model 7 in Table S2), though we did not cross-validate such a model. Reliable estimates of time constants were obtained for both the switch from low- to high-contrast context (τL→H) and the switch from high- to low-contrast context (τH→L) for 18 units. Adaptation to high-contrast context occurred with a median τL→H of 86 ms, compared with a slower adaptation to low-contrast context with a median τH→L of 157 ms. This difference was significant (p < 0.001, sign-rank) and evident for 14/18 of the individual units (Figure 6F). Thus, the time courses for increases and decreases in neural gain are asymmetric. To explore the mechanism for gain control, we asked whether gain is modulated by the contrast within a local region of frequency space or whether it is a function of the global statistics of the input. To address this, we varied the contrast of the DRC stimuli within two separate frequency regions. One region was denoted the “test,” centered around a chosen unit's BF and spanning 0.5, 0.67, or 1.2 octaves. The remaining frequency bands were denoted the “mask” (Figure 7A ). We aimed to situate the test stimulus over the “responsive frequency range” (ΦRF; see Experimental Procedures), the frequencies to which a given neuron (linearly) responded. However, since we recorded multiple units simultaneously (usually bilaterally), we actually sampled a range of conditions where the test stimulus covered the neuron's responsive frequency range, overlapped it, or lay entirely outside it. This enabled us to measure how contrast gain depended on the amount of overlap between the test stimulus and ΦRF. We presented nine separate DRCs, where the contrasts in the test (σtest) and mask (σmask) were independently chosen from σL = 2.9 dB, 5.8 dB, or 8.7 dB (c = 33%, 64%, or 92%). We found that the gain of each neuron was most strongly modulated by contrast within the responsive frequency range. Thus, varying σtest had the strongest effect on gain when the test stimulus completely covered ΦRF (Figure 7B). Similarly, varying σmask had the strongest effect when the mask completely covered ΦRF (Figure 7C). However, contrast away from the responsive frequency range also had an impact on gain. For example, even when the test stimulus completely covered ΦRF, decreasing σmask still re"
https://openalex.org/W2029740022,"Many animals rely on visual motion detection for survival. Motion information is extracted from spatiotemporal intensity patterns on the retina, a paradigmatic neural computation. A phenomenological model, the Hassenstein-Reichardt correlator (HRC), relates visual inputs to neural activity and behavioral responses to motion, but the circuits that implement this computation remain unknown. By using cell-type specific genetic silencing, minimal motion stimuli, and in vivo calcium imaging, we examine two critical HRC inputs. These two pathways respond preferentially to light and dark moving edges. We demonstrate that these pathways perform overlapping but complementary subsets of the computations underlying the HRC. A numerical model implementing differential weighting of these operations displays the observed edge preferences. Intriguingly, these pathways are distinguished by their sensitivities to a stimulus correlation that corresponds to an illusory percept, ""reverse phi,"" that affects many species. Thus, this computational architecture may be widely used to achieve edge selectivity in motion detection."
https://openalex.org/W2099288956,"Visual attention affects both perception and neuronal responses. Whether the same neuronal mechanisms mediate spatial attention, which improves perception of attended locations, and nonspatial forms of attention has been a subject of considerable debate. Spatial and feature attention have similar effects on individual neurons. Because visual cortex is retinotopically organized, however, spatial attention can comodulate local neuronal populations, whereas feature attention generally requires more selective modulation. We compared the effects of feature and spatial attention on local and spatially separated populations by recording simultaneously from dozens of neurons in both hemispheres of V4. Feature and spatial attention affect the activity of local populations similarly, modulating both firing rates and correlations between pairs of nearby neurons. However, whereas spatial attention appears to act on local populations, feature attention is coordinated across hemispheres. Our results are consistent with a unified attentional mechanism that can modulate the responses of arbitrary subgroups of neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2156024023,"When we search for a target in a crowded visual scene, we often use the distinguishing features of the target, such as color or shape, to guide our attention and eye movements. To investigate the neural mechanisms of feature-based attention, we simultaneously recorded neural responses in the frontal eye field (FEF) and area V4 while monkeys performed a visual search task. The responses of cells in both areas were modulated by feature attention, independent of spatial attention, and the magnitude of response enhancement was inversely correlated with the number of saccades needed to find the target. However, an analysis of the latency of sensory and attentional influences on responses suggested that V4 provides bottom-up sensory information about stimulus features, whereas the FEF provides a top-down attentional bias toward target features that modulates sensory processing in V4 and that could be used to guide the eyes to a searched-for target."
https://openalex.org/W2059729107,"Nitrogen fixation is an essential process that biologically transforms atmospheric dinitrogen gas to ammonia, therefore compensating for nitrogen losses occurring via denitrification and anammox. Currently, inputs and losses of nitrogen to the ocean resulting from these processes are thought to be spatially separated: nitrogen fixation takes place primarily in open ocean environments (mainly through diazotrophic cyanobacteria), whereas nitrogen losses occur in oxygen-depleted intermediate waters and sediments (mostly via denitrifying and anammox bacteria). Here we report on rates of nitrogen fixation obtained during two oceanographic cruises in 2005 and 2007 in the eastern tropical South Pacific (ETSP), a region characterized by the presence of coastal upwelling and a major permanent oxygen minimum zone (OMZ). Our results show significant rates of nitrogen fixation in the water column; however, integrated rates from the surface down to 120 m varied by ∼30 fold between cruises (7.5±4.6 versus 190±82.3 µmol m−2 d−1). Moreover, rates were measured down to 400 m depth in 2007, indicating that the contribution to the integrated rates of the subsurface oxygen-deficient layer was ∼5 times higher (574±294 µmol m−2 d−1) than the oxic euphotic layer (48±68 µmol m−2 d−1). Concurrent molecular measurements detected the dinitrogenase reductase gene nifH in surface and subsurface waters. Phylogenetic analysis of the nifH sequences showed the presence of a diverse diazotrophic community at the time of the highest measured nitrogen fixation rates. Our results thus demonstrate the occurrence of nitrogen fixation in nutrient-rich coastal upwelling systems and, importantly, within the underlying OMZ. They also suggest that nitrogen fixation is a widespread process that can sporadically provide a supplementary source of fixed nitrogen in these regions."
https://openalex.org/W2086416919,"Complex neural circuits in the mammalian brain develop through a combination of genetic instruction and activity-dependent refinement. The relative role of these factors and the form of neuronal activity responsible for circuit development is a matter of significant debate. In the mammalian visual system, retinal ganglion cell projections to the brain are mapped with respect to retinotopic location and eye of origin. We manipulated the pattern of spontaneous retinal waves present during development without changing overall activity levels through the transgenic expression of β2-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in retinal ganglion cells of mice. We used this manipulation to demonstrate that spontaneous retinal activity is not just permissive, but instructive in the emergence of eye-specific segregation and retinotopic refinement in the mouse visual system. This suggests that specific patterns of spontaneous activity throughout the developing brain are essential in the emergence of specific and distinct patterns of neuronal connectivity."

Autocorrelation, a principle for the evaluation of sensory information by the central nervous system.in: Rosenblith W.A. Sensory Communication. MIT Press and John Wiley and Sons, New York1961: 303-317Google Scholar). The resulting model, the so-called Reichardt Detector (Figure 1A ; Hassenstein and Reichardt, 1956Hassenstein B. Reichardt W. Systemtheoretische Analyse der Zeit, Reihenfolgen und Vorzeichenauswertung bei der Bewegungsperzeption des Rüsselkäfers Chlorophanus.Z. Naturforsch. 1956; 11b: 513-524Google Scholar), accurately reproduces cellular and behavioral responses to motion stimuli in surprising detail (Götz, 1964Götz K.G.

Haag J. Reiff D.F. Fly motion vision.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 33: 49-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The core operation performed in the Reichardt Detector is a multiplication of the input signals from two neighboring photoreceptors after one of them has been temporally delayed by a low-pass filter. This computation is performed twice in a mirror-symmetrical way, the outputs of both operations being finally subtracted to enhance the detector's direction selectivity. While this model represents a faithful algorithmic description of how photoreceptor signals are processed to result in a directionally selective output, its cellular implementation is still unknown due to technical difficulties in recording from the small columnar neurons in the optic lobe that hosts the motion detection circuit. Furthermore, the biophysical implementation of a mathematically sign-correct multiplication of positive (ON) and negative (OFF) input signals poses a fundamental problem for any neuronal hardware. Thus, after more than half a century of research, not only the constituting cells and biophysics of the processing steps but also the overall internal structure of the Reichardt Detector are still open questions. However, fly motion vision has received renewed interest with the establishment of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism in systems neuroscience (Rister et al., 2007Rister J.

Drosophila's view on insect vision.Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: R36-R47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). At the front end of the circuitry, fly motion vision starts with the detection of light in the six outer photoreceptors R1–6 of the compound eye. Upon illumination, R1–6 release the neurotransmitter histamine (Hardie, 1989Hardie R.C. A histamine-activated chloride channel involved in neurotransmission at a photoreceptor synapse.Nature. 1989; 339: 704-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and relay the luminance signal to five parallel processing streams in the first-order neuropil, the lamina. Two of them, the large monopolar cells L1 and L2, express histamine-gated chloride channels on their dendrites in the lamina (Gengs et al., 2002Gengs C. Leung H.T. Skingsley D.R. Iovchev M.I. Yin Z.

Chem. 2002; 277: 42113-42120Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and transmit the major input signals to the motion detection circuitry (Rister et al., 2007Rister J. Pauls D. Schnell B. Ting C.Y. Lee C.H. Sinakevitch I. Morante J. Strausfeld N.J. Ito K. Heisenberg M.

In both neurons, onset and offset of histamine release cause transient hyperpolarizing and depolarizing dendritic responses, respectively, with a small sustained hyperpolarization in between (Laughlin and Hardie, 1978Laughlin S.B.

L1 and L2 relay their signals via long axons to separate layers in the second-order neuropil, the medulla. Here, information is picked up by mostly unidentified neurons that constitute the motion detection circuit and finally transmit their output to the third-order neuropil consisting of lobula and lobula plate. In the lobula plate, large directionally selective tangential cells extend their elaborate dendrites and spatially integrate the output of local presynaptic motion detectors (Single and Borst, 1998Single S. Borst A. Dendritic integration and its role in computing image velocity.Science. 1998; 281: 1848-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, Borst et al., 2010Borst A. Haag J. Reiff D.F. Fly motion vision.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 33: 49-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Their responses to large-field motion in the preferred direction (PD) are positive (membrane depolarizations, or firing rate increases) and negative (hyperpolarizations, or firing rate decreases) in the opposite, the so-called null direction (ND). In this study, we build on the recent discovery that the lamina neurons L1 and L2 constitute the input channels to the motion detection circuitry in Drosophila. Joesch et al., 2010Joesch M. Schnell B. Raghu S.V. Reiff D.F. Borst A. ON and OFF pathways in Drosophila motion vision.Nature. 2010; 468: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar recorded from directionally selective tangential cells in the lobula plate while genetically blocking synaptic transmission from L1 and/or L2. Blocking both L1 and L2 removed motion-sensitive responses in lobula plate tangential cells. Importantly, blocking either L1 or L2 revealed that in flies, similar to vertebrates, the visual input is split into an ON and an OFF component. Here, we adapt the Reichardt Detector to incorporate these new findings, giving rise to two alternative models. Both models require a more elaborate internal structure of the detector to allow for an implementation of separate ON- and OFF-input signals. The first model, the “4-Quadrant-Detector” (Figure 1B) (Hassenstein and Reichardt, 1956Hassenstein B. Reichardt W. Systemtheoretische Analyse der Zeit, Reihenfolgen und Vorzeichenauswertung bei der Bewegungsperzeption des Rüsselkäfers Chlorophanus.Z. Naturforsch. 1956; 11b: 513-524Google Scholar) consists of four parallel detectors that cover all four possible combinations of input signals (ON-ON, ON-OFF, OFF-ON, and OFF-OFF). From its input-output behavior, a 4-Quadrant-Detector is mathematically identical to the original Reichardt model. The second model, proposed by Franceschini et al., 1989Franceschini N. Riehle A. Le Nestour A. Directionally selective motion detection by insect neurons.in: Stavenga D.G. Hardie R.C. Facets of Vision. Springer, Berlin1989: 360-390Crossref Google Scholar, contains just two subunits, an ON-ON and an OFF-OFF detector (Figure 1C). Notably, this “2-Quadrant-Detector” is no longer equivalent to the original Reichardt Detector since input signals of opposite sign do not interact. These differences in response behavior should allow us to decide between the two models experimentally. We first presented apparent motion stimuli consisting of sequences of spatially displaced, persistent light increment (ON) and decrement (OFF) steps to two different fly species, Calliphora and Drosophila, while recording from lobula plate tangential cells. We consistently found strong directionally selective responses to sequences of same sign (ON-ON, OFF-OFF) and inverted responses to sequences of opposite sign (ON-OFF, OFF-ON). The latter seems to clearly speak in favor of a 4-Quadrant-Detector. However, we also found persistent directionally selective responses for interstimulus intervals that by far exceed the estimated time constant of the low-pass filter in the Reichardt Detector, indicative for a tonic representation of the brightness level at the input of the motion detector. Incorporation of an appropriate input filter (high-pass filtering and parallel tonic throughput) in the 2-Quadrant-Detector reproduced all measured responses to sequences of same as well as of opposite sign, albeit lacking specific detector units for correlating combinations of ON and OFF stimuli. Furthermore, the model displayed all the features in response to moving gratings that had been reported from tangential cells before, while imposing only half the wiring and energy demands compared to a 4-Quadrant-Detector. Our findings and the resulting model provided us with a testable hypothesis to distinguish between the 2-Quadrant- and the 4-Quadrant-Detector. Using a modified apparent motion stimulus protocol based on short brightness pulses instead of persistent brightness steps, we performed measurements that contradict the 4-Quadrant-Detector but are in agreement with a 2-Quadrant-Detector. To analyze the internal structure of the elementary motion detector in flies, we used apparent motion stimuli (Riehle and Franceschini, 1984Riehle A. Franceschini N. Motion detection in flies: parametric control over ON-OFF pathways.Exp. Brain Res. 1984; 54: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, Ramachandran and Anstis, 1986Ramachandran V.S. Anstis S.M. The perception of apparent motion.Sci. Am. 1986; 254: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, Egelhaaf and Borst, 1992Egelhaaf M. Borst A. Are there separate ON and OFF channels in fly motion vision?.Vis. Neurosci. 1992; 8: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Such stimuli consist of sequences of light increments or decrements and, thus, should be ideally suited to selectively activate subunits of one type only, e.g., the ON-ON subunit for ON-ON sequences, while leaving the other subunits unaffected. Apparent motion stimuli of all possible combinations (ON-ON, OFF-OFF, ON-OFF, and OFF-ON) should therefore allow us to discriminate between models with or without interactions between input signals of opposite sign. Our stimuli consisted of two adjacent stripes appearing sequentially with a delay of 1 s, thus mimicking motion in one of two directions. The single stripes generate either positive (ON) or negative (OFF) brightness steps, starting from an initial, intermediate brightness level (Figure 2A , rightward motion shown only). The width of the stripes was set such that the two stripes approximately activated neighboring facets forming the input to motion detectors. We measured the effect of such selective stimulation by electrophysiological recordings from directionally selective lobula plate tangential cells. For assessing the generality of our results, we measured responses in two species: using extracellular recordings of action potentials, we measured the firing rate of the horizontally sensitive neuron H1 in Calliphora vicina; using somatic whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, we measured the intracellular membrane potential in vertically sensitive VS cells (VS1–5) in Drosophila melanogaster. The results of these experiments are shown in Figure 2B (Calliphora) and Figure 2C (Drosophila). Lobula plate tangential cells respond to single ON or OFF steps imposed on a uniformly illuminated background with an increase in firing rate or a depolarization (see responses to the appearance of the first stripe). The direction selectivity of the motion detection circuit can be observed by comparing the responses to the second stripe with the responses to the first one. For ON-ON and OFF-OFF stimuli (first and second row in Figures 2B and 2C), the response amplitudes are larger when the stimulus sequence is in the cell's PD (red lines) than when the sequence is in the cell's ND (blue lines). The opposite effect is observed for ON-OFF and OFF-ON stimulus sequences (third and fourth row in Figures 2B and 2C): here, the response to the second stimulus is smaller than the response to the first one when the sequence is in the cell's PD, and larger than the first one when the sequence is in the cell's ND. This effect is called “PD-ND inversion” and is illustrated more clearly when the response to an ND sequence is subtracted from the response to the corresponding PD sequence (black lines in Figures 2B and 2C): for ON-ON and OFF-OFF sequences, a positive signal is obtained; for ON-OFF and OFF-ON sequences, the resulting signal is negative. All this holds true for recordings from the H1 cell in Calliphora as well as for recordings from VS cells in Drosophila (compare Figure 2B with Figure 2C). While the responses to ON-ON and OFF-OFF stimuli can be explained by both a 4- as well as by a 2-Quadrant-Detector (Figures 1B and 1C, respectively), the responses to sequences of opposite sign (ON-OFF, OFF-ON) are hard to reconcile with a 2-Quadrant-Detector. However, the phenomenon of the PD-ND inversion is in agreement with predictions from the Reichardt Detector (Figure 1A) and its mathematical equivalent, the 4-Quadrant-Detector (Figure 1B): for ON-OFF or OFF-ON sequences, signals of opposite signs are multiplied, leading to the observed PD-ND inversion. Therefore, given the splitting of the photoreceptor output into ON and OFF components, these results seem to rule out the 2-Quadrant-Detector (Figure 1C) and rather imply a motion detection circuit of the 4-Quadrant type (Figure 1B). However, the above reasoning rests on two tacit assumptions: (1) information about the absolute brightness is fully eliminated, and only information about the change of the stimulus brightness is passed on to the rectification stage and the subsequent motion detection circuits; and (2) the threshold for the rectification stage is set at exactly the zero point of the incoming signal. As soon as we drop one of these assumptions, the signal separation becomes less strict, and a 2-Quadrant-Detector might respond to stimulus sequences of opposite sign as well. We therefore investigated to what extent the motion detection circuit is sensitive to prolonged presentation of a stripe that, after a relatively long delay, is followed by the appearance of a second stripe, either toward the PD or the ND relative to the first stripe. If only information about the brightness change of the second stripe is present at the input of the motion detection circuit, presenting the second stripe on either side of the first stripe should result in identical, direction-insensitive responses for long enough delays between the two stripes. If, however, some information about the first stripe, i.e., a tonic or DC component, continues to be passed on to the motion detection circuit after long delays, the responses to PD and ND should differ. To investigate this point, we presented stimuli in which the first stripe appeared on the screen 10 s before the second one. These experiments revealed clear directionally selective responses (Figures 3A and 3B ; legend as in Figures 2B and 2C). Moreover, the responses were highly reminiscent of those for short interstimulus intervals depicted in Figures 2B and 2C. The extent of direction selectivity is particularly remarkable because the interstimulus interval of 10 s is almost three orders of magnitude larger than the estimated low-pass filter time constant of the motion detection circuit (Guo and Reichardt, 1987Guo A. Reichardt W. An estimation of the time constant of movement detectors.Naturwissenschaften. 1987; 74: 91-92Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). These data clearly contradict the assumption that only information about brightness changes is passed on to the motion detection circuitry. In contrast, and in line with previous results (Borst et al., 2003Borst A. Reisenman C. Haag J. Adaptation of response transients in fly motion vision. II: model studies.Vision Res. 2003; 43: 1309-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, Reisenman et al., 2003Reisenman C. Haag J. Borst A. Adaptation of response transients in fly motion vision. I: experiments.Vision Res. 2003; 43: 1291-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the motion detection circuit is also informed about permanent brightness levels, resulting in directionally selective responses to apparent motion stimuli even when the two events are separated by 10 s. Although a certain influence of the absolute brightness on lobula plate tangential cell responses has been observed before (Hengstenberg, 1982Hengstenberg R. Common visual response properties of giant vertical cells in the lobula plate of the blowfly Calliphora.J. Comp. Physiol. 1982; 149: 179-193Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar), our measurements illustrate, to our knowledge, for the first time to what large extent the motion detection circuit uses this information, giving strongly direction-selective responses to quasi-isolated brightness steps. The results presented above provide the crucial step for proposing a modified 2-Quadrant-Detector as depicted in Figure 4A . Here, the input, ranging from dimensionless values of 0.1 (OFF) to 0.5 (ON), is first preprocessed by a circuit that aims to model the recorded responses of lamina cells L1 and L2 (Laughlin and Hardie, 1978Laughlin S.B. Hardie R.C. Common strategies for light adaptation in the peripheral visual systems of fly and dragonfly.J. Comp. Physiol. A Neuroethol. Sens. Neural Behav.

Synaptic limitations to contrast coding in the retina of the blowfly Calliphora.Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1987; 231: 437-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The signal is fed through a first-order high-pass filter (τ = 250 ms) and, after that, is added to a 10% fraction of the original input signal, representing the DC component of the lamina cell responses. The input to the ON-ON subunit is obtained by a half-wave rectification with a clip point at zero, whereas the input to the OFF-OFF subunit is computed by applying a half-wave rectification with a slightly shifted clip point at 0.05. By this way, a small component of the ON signal is included in the OFF pathway as well. Both subunits are represented as standard Reichardt Detectors, except that they now process only nonnegative input signals. The two output lines of each subunit are subtracted, with the inhibitory component being weighed by a constant of 0.92, relative to the positive output. This differential weighing accounts for the reported imbalance of the two half-detectors (Egelhaaf et al., 1989Egelhaaf M. Borst A. Reichardt W. Computational structure of a biological motion-detection system as revealed by local detector analysis in the fly's nervous system.J. Opt. Soc. Am. A. 1989; 6: 1070-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The effect of the filter stage and the rectifiers is illustrated in Figure 4B. The upper-left panel depicts an example stimulus; the lower-left panel shows the resulting signal after high-pass filtering and adding a 10% fraction of the unfiltered stimulus. The right two panels depict the ON and OFF components extracted by the two rectifiers. As the experiments with an interstimulus interval of 10 s showed, temporally isolated single brightness changes strongly affect the response depending on the brightness of the surrounding area. Therefore, it is unlikely that the observed responses stem from only one detector that observes both stripes. Rather, it has to be assumed that other detectors that correlate the surrounding area with either the left or the right stripe strongly affect the response as well. We therefore used an array of such 2-Quadrant-Detectors (see Experimental Procedures) for modeling the responses to apparent motion stimuli as well as to moving gratings (Figures 4C–4F). The model reproduced the main characteristics of the measurements for ON-ON and OFF-OFF sequences delivered with a 1 s interstimulus interval (compare Figures 2B and 2C, first and second row, with Figure 4C, first and second row): for sequences along the PD (red traces), the response to the second stimulus was larger than the response to the first one; for sequences along the ND (blue traces), the response to the second stimulus was smaller than the response to the first one. Therefore, the difference between the PD and the ND response (black traces) was always positive. However, despite lacking specific ON-OFF and OFF-ON subunits, this model also exhibited responses to stimulus sequences of opposite sign (ON-OFF, OFF-ON, Figure 4C, third and fourth row): For sequences along the PD (red traces), the response to the second stimulus was smaller than the response to the first one; for sequences along the ND (blue traces), the response to the second stimulus was larger than the response to the first one. Therefore, the difference between the PD and the ND response (black traces) was always negative. Thus, the model also reproduced the PD-ND inversion mentioned above. While the simulation results constitute a good qualitative fit, there are quantitative differences between the measurements depicted in Figures 2B and 2C and the simulations in Figure 4C, such as stronger ND responses and different decay time constants. We believe that these shortcomings mainly stem from two deliberate choices: (1) the intentional simplicity of our model that, for instance, is incapable of reproducing the complex temporal responses of lamina monopolar cells to brightness steps; and (2) the choice of a single parameter set for fitting responses of two different fly species (extracellular H1 recordings in Calliphora and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in Drosophila). In addition, strong negative input cannot be observed in extracellular recordings of a spiking cell because firing rates can only decrease to 0 Hz. These results demonstrate that the responses of a 2-Quadrant-Detector, equipped with experimentally justified stimulus preprocessing stages, can be reconciled with the experimental results to apparent motion stimuli shown in Figure 2. However, the question arises as to whether this model is also able to reproduce experimentally confirmed response characteristics of the original Reichardt Detector to other stimuli. We investigated this point by comparing the responses of the 2-Quadrant-Model with the Reichardt Detector to stimuli where the outputs of a large array of motion detectors are spatially integrated. In particular, it has been shown that for moving sine gratings, steady-state responses of lobula plate tangential cells exhibit an optimum that depends on the contrast frequency of the stimulus (angular velocity divided by the spatial wavelength). To this end, we simulated an array of 200 motion detectors, either Reichardt Detectors (Figure 1A) or 2-Quadrant-Detectors (Figure 4A), and determined their spatially integrated responses to sine gratings (wavelength λ = 20°) moving at various velocities. For both models, the input was preprocessed by the identical high-pass/DC filter combination. We observed a high degree of similarity between the two models in their steady-state response amplitude: the response is maximum at a certain contrast frequency and declines for frequencies beyond that point (Figure 4D). The only difference between the model responses consists of a slightly reduced ND response amplitude of the 2-Quadrant-Detector as compared to the Reichardt Detector. Next, we tested a more subtle response characteristic of the Reichardt Detector, the so-called “afterimage effect” (Maddess, 1986Maddess T.

We then compared the dynamic response properties of the two models by stimulating the detector array with a moving sine grating following a pseudorandom velocity profile (Figure 4F). Both types of models reveal an almost identical response. This degree of similarity is particularly remarkable regarding the complexity of the stimulus.

Conventional conservation measures such as law enforcement and community development projects are typically designed to minimize negative human influences upon a species and its ecosystem. In contrast, we define “extreme” conservation as efforts targeted to deliberately increase positive human influences, including veterinary care and close monitoring of individual animals. Here we compare the impact of both conservation approaches upon the population growth rate of the critically endangered Virunga mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei), which increased by 50% since their nadir in 1981, from approximately 250 to nearly 400 gorillas. Using demographic data from 1967–2008, we show an annual decline of 0.7%±0.059% for unhabituated gorillas that received intensive levels of conventional conservation approaches, versus an increase 4.1%±0.088% for habituated gorillas that also received extreme conservation measures. Each group of habituated gorillas is now continuously guarded by a separate team of field staff during daylight hours and receives veterinary treatment for snares, respiratory disease, and other life-threatening conditions. These results suggest that conventional conservation efforts prevented a severe decline of the overall population, but additional extreme measures were needed to achieve positive growth. Demographic stochasticity and socioecological factors had minimal impact on variability in the growth rates. Veterinary interventions could account for up to 40% of the difference in growth rates between habituated versus unhabituated gorillas, with the remaining difference likely arising from greater protection against poachers. Thus, by increasing protection and facilitating veterinary treatment, the daily monitoring of each habituated group contributed to most of the difference in growth rates. Our results argue for wider consideration of extreme measures and offer a startling view of the enormous resources that may be needed to conserve some endangered species."
https://openalex.org/W1986062299,"Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by CAG/polyglutamine repeat expansions in the ataxin-7 gene. Ataxin-7 is a component of two different transcription coactivator complexes, and recent work indicates that disease protein normal function is altered in polyglutamine neurodegeneration. Given this, we studied how ataxin-7 gene expression is regulated. The ataxin-7 repeat and translation start site are flanked by binding sites for CTCF, a highly conserved multifunctional transcription regulator. When we analyzed this region, we discovered an adjacent alternative promoter and a convergently transcribed antisense noncoding RNA, SCAANT1. To understand how CTCF regulates ataxin-7 gene expression, we introduced ataxin-7 mini-genes into mice, and found that CTCF is required for SCAANT1 expression. Loss of SCAANT1 derepressed ataxin-7 sense transcription in a cis-dependent fashion and was accompanied by chromatin remodeling. Discovery of this pathway underscores the importance of altered epigenetic regulation for disease pathology at repeat loci exhibiting bidirectional transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1994493260,"Background Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus is caused by auto immune destruction of insulin producing beta cells in the pancreas. Currently available treatments include transplantation of isolated islets from donor pancreas to the patient. However, this method is limited by inadequate means of immuno-suppression to prevent islet rejection and importantly, limited supply of islets for transplantation. Autologous adult stem cells are now considered for cell replacement therapy in diabetes as it has the potential to generate neo-islets which are genetically part of the treated individual. Adopting methods of islet encapsulation in immuno-isolatory devices would eliminate the need for immuno-suppressants. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study we explore the potential of human adipose tissue derived adult stem cells (h-ASCs) to differentiate into functional islet like cell aggregates (ICAs). Our stage specific differentiation protocol permit the conversion of mesodermic h-ASCs to definitive endoderm (Hnf3β, TCF2 and Sox17) and to PDX1, Ngn3, NeuroD, Pax4 positive pancreatic endoderm which further matures in vitro to secrete insulin. These ICAs are shown to produce human C-peptide in a glucose dependent manner exhibiting in-vitro functionality. Transplantation of mature ICAs, packed in immuno-isolatory biocompatible capsules to STZ induced diabetic mice restored near normoglycemia within 3–4 weeks. The detection of human C-peptide, 1155±165 pM in blood serum of experimental mice demonstrate the efficacy of our differentiation approach. Conclusions h-ASC is an ideal population of personal stem cells for cell replacement therapy, given that they are abundant, easily available and autologous in origin. Our findings present evidence that h-ASCs could be induced to differentiate into physiologically competent functional islet like cell aggregates, which may provide as a source of alternative islets for cell replacement therapy in type 1 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2017608429,"Modifying plant architecture to increase photosynthesis efficiency and reduce shade avoidance response is very important for further yield improvement when crops are grown in high density. Identification of alleles controlling leaf angle in maize is needed to provide insight into molecular mechanism of leaf development and achieving ideal plant architecture to improve grain yield.The gene cloning was done by using comparative genomics, and then performing real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis to assay gene expression. The gene function was validated by sequence dissimilarity analysis and QTL mapping using a functional cleaved amplified polymorphism (CAP).The leaf angle is controlled by a major quantitative trait locus, ZmTAC1 (Zea mays L. Leaf Angle Control 1). ZmTAC1 has 4 exons encoding a protein with 263 amino acids, and its domains are the same as those of the rice OsTAC1 protein. ZmTAC1 was found to be located in the region of qLA2 by using the CAP marker and the F(2:3) families from the cross between Yu82 and Shen137. Real-time PCR analysis revealed ZmTAC1 expression was the highest in the leaf-sheath pulvinus, less in the leaf and shoot apical meristem, and the lowest in the root. A nucleotide difference in the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) between the compact inbred line Yu82 (""CTCC"") and the expanded inbred line Shen137 (""CCCC"") influences the expression level of ZmTAC1, further controlling the size of the leaf angle. Sequence verification of the change in the 5'-UTR revealed ZmTAC1 with ""CTCC"" was present in 13 compact inbred lines and ZmTAC1 with ""CCCC"" was present in 18 expanded inbred lines, indicating ZmTAC1 had been extensively utilized in breeding with regard to the improvement of the maize plant architecture."
https://openalex.org/W2075315327,"The serotonin 5-HT2C receptor (5-HT2CR) is localized to the limbic-corticostriatal circuit, which plays an integral role in mediating attention, motivation, cognition, and reward processes. The 5-HT2CR is linked to modulation of mesoaccumbens dopamine neurotransmission via an activation of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). However, we recently demonstrated the expression of the 5-HT2CR within dopamine VTA neurons suggesting the possibility of a direct influence of the 5-HT2CR upon mesoaccumbens dopamine output. Here, we employed double-label fluorescence immunochemistry with the synthetic enzymes for dopamine (tyrosine hydroxylase; TH) and GABA (glutamic acid decarboxylase isoform 67; GAD-67) and retrograde tract tracing with FluoroGold (FG) to uncover whether dopamine and GABA VTA neurons that possess 5-HT2CR innervate the nucleus accumbens (NAc). The highest numbers of FG-labeled cells were detected in the middle versus rostral and caudal levels of the VTA, and included a subset of TH- and GAD-67 immunoreactive cells, of which >50% also contained 5-HT2CR immunoreactivity. Thus, we demonstrate for the first time that the 5-HT2CR colocalizes in DA and GABA VTA neurons which project to the NAc, describe in detail the distribution of NAc-projecting GABA VTA neurons, and identify the colocalization of TH and GAD-67 in the same NAc-projecting VTA neurons. These data suggest that the 5-HT2CR may exert direct influence upon both dopamine and GABA VTA output to the NAc. Further, the indication that a proportion of NAc-projecting VTA neurons synthesize and potentially release both dopamine and GABA adds intriguing complexity to the framework of the VTA and its postulated neuroanatomical roles."
https://openalex.org/W2014443309,"Efficient memory formation relies on the establishment of functional hippocampal circuits. It has been proposed that synaptic connections are refined by neural activity to form functional brain circuitry. However, it is not known whether and how hippocampal connections are refined by neural activity in vivo. Using a mouse genetic system in which restricted populations of neurons in the hippocampal circuit are inactivated, we show that inactive axons are eliminated after they develop through a competition with active axons. Remarkably, in the dentate gyrus, which undergoes neurogenesis throughout life, axon refinement is achieved by a competition between mature and young neurons. These results demonstrate that activity-dependent competition plays multiple roles in the establishment of functional memory circuits in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2053196665,"Yes-associated protein 65 (YAP) contains multiple protein-protein interaction domains and functions as both a transcriptional co-activator and as a scaffolding protein. Mouse embryos lacking YAP did not survive past embryonic day 8.5 and showed signs of defective yolk sac vasculogenesis, chorioallantoic fusion, and anterior-posterior (A-P) axis elongation. Given that the YAP knockout mouse defects might be due in part to nutritional deficiencies, we sought to better characterize a role for YAP during early development using embryos that develop externally. YAP morpholino (MO)-mediated loss-of-function in both frog and fish resulted in incomplete epiboly at gastrulation and impaired axis formation, similar to the mouse phenotype. In frog, germ layer specific genes were expressed, but they were temporally delayed. YAP MO-mediated partial knockdown in frog allowed a shortened axis to form. YAP gain-of-function in Xenopus expanded the progenitor populations in the neural plate (sox2+) and neural plate border zone (pax3+), while inhibiting the expression of later markers of tissues derived from the neural plate border zone (neural crest, pre-placodal ectoderm, hatching gland), as well as epidermis and somitic muscle. YAP directly regulates pax3 expression via association with TEAD1 (N-TEF) at a highly conserved, previously undescribed, TEAD-binding site within the 5′ regulatory region of pax3. Structure/function analyses revealed that the PDZ-binding motif of YAP contributes to the inhibition of epidermal and somitic muscle differentiation, but a complete, intact YAP protein is required for expansion of the neural plate and neural plate border zone progenitor pools. These results provide a thorough analysis of YAP mediated gene expression changes in loss- and gain-of-function experiments. Furthermore, this is the first report to use YAP structure-function analyzes to determine which portion of YAP is involved in specific gene expression changes and the first to show direct in vivo evidence of YAP's role in regulating pax3 neural crest expression."
https://openalex.org/W2100545357,"Endocytic events are critical for neuronal survival in response to target-derived neurotrophic cues, but whether local axon growth is mediated by endocytosis-dependent signaling mechanisms remains unclear. Here, we report that Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) promotes endocytosis of its TrkA receptors and axon growth by calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation of the endocytic GTPase dynamin1. Conditional deletion of calcineurin in sympathetic neurons disrupts NGF-dependent innervation of peripheral target tissues. Calcineurin signaling is required locally in sympathetic axons to support NGF-mediated growth in a manner independent of transcription. We show that calcineurin associates with dynamin1 via a PxIxIT interaction motif found only in specific dynamin1 splice variants. PxIxIT-containing dynamin1 isoforms colocalize with surface TrkA receptors, and their phosphoregulation is selectively required for NGF-dependent TrkA internalization and axon growth in sympathetic neurons. Thus, NGF-dependent phosphoregulation of dynamin1 is a critical event coordinating neurotrophin receptor endocytosis and axonal growth."

Histone variant H2AX is a central player for DDR. Upon DNA damage, H2AX is phosphorylated by ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ATM-related kinases at serine 139, known as γ-H2AX, which serves as a docking site to recruit the mediator of DNA damage checkpoint protein 1 (MDC1) to sites of DNA damage, named DNA damage foci (3Ayoub N.

Proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with antibody. Chromatin fractionation was performed as described previously (20Lukas C. Melander F. Stucki M. Falck J. Bekker-Jensen S. Goldberg M. Lerenthal Y. Jackson S.P. Bartek J. Lukas J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2674-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In brief, cells with or without IR were washed twice by cold PBS. Cell pellets were resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.34 m sucrose, 10% glycerol (v/v), 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 0.1% Triton X-100 (v/v), and phosphatase inhibitor mixture I and II (Sigma)) on ice. After centrifuging, pellets were lysed by buffer B (3 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures I and II (Sigma)). After centrifuging, pellets were washed twice by washing buffer I (3 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 150 mm NaCl, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) and buffer II (3 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 250 mm NaCl, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). After washing, pellets were sonicated and lysed by E1A lysis buffer. The proteins were then analyzed by IB analysis. For colony formation assay, H2AX−/− MEFs infected with mock, H2AX, or H2AX-K119R/K120R (3000 cells per well) were split into 12-well plates and then treated with various doses of IR. After a 7-day culture, the viable cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet. The number of colonies (more than 50 cells for each colony) was calculated. Foci quantification was performed as described previously (21Leatherbarrow E.L. Harper J.V. Cucinotta F.A. O'Neill P. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 2006; 82: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 22Paull T.T. Rogakou E.P. Yamazaki V. Kirchgessner C.U. Gellert M. Bonner W.M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 886-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar). The number of foci per cell was calculated on the microscope using the oil lens (63×). The captured images were analyzed for foci using AlphaEase® FC software. At least 40 cells were randomly collected from each group. The captured images were transformed into the intensity scale (8-bit resolution) by using AlphaEase® FC software. The number of radiation-induced DNA damage protein foci, representing the higher density thresholds of gray level as compared with background with lower intensities, was counted by the automatic counting routine separately using the AlphaEase® FC software. All values were the means ± S.D. of replicate samples (n = 3–6, depending on the different experiments), and experiments were repeated a minimum of three times. Differences between the two groups were assessed using the unpaired two-tailed Student's t test or by analysis of variance if more than two groups were analyzed. The Tukey test was used as a post hoc test in analysis of variance for testing the significance of pairwise group comparisons. p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant in all comparisons. SPSS version 13.0 for Windows (LEAD Technologies, Inc.) was used for all calculations. To study the role of monoubiquitination of H2AX in DDR, we first determined which residues of H2AX are the monoubiquitination sites. To this end, we mutated all the lysine residues of H2AX to arginine and tested these mutants in in vivo ubiquitination assay. We found that H2AX displayed monoubiquitination (Fig. 1, A and B). RNF8 E3 ligase did not affect the level of H2AX monoubiquitination but promoted di-ubiquitination of H2AX, consistent with the previous results showing that RNF8 is not required for H2AX monoubiquitination but for di-ubiquitination and H2AX (10Huen M.S. Grant R. Manke I. Minn K. Yu X. Yaffe M.B. Chen J. Cell. 2007; 131: 901-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). We found that mutations on Lys-119 or Lys-120 partly reduced monoubiquitination of H2A, whereas mutations on other sites have little effect on monoubiquitination of H2AX (Fig. 1B). This result is consistent with the previous report showing that Lys-119 is a monoubiquitination site for H2AX (13Ikura T. Tashiro S. Kakino A. Shima H. Jacob N. Amunugama R. Yoder K. Izumi S. Kuraoka I. Tanaka K. Kimura H. Ikura M. Nishikubo S. Ito T. Muto A. Miyagawa K. Takeda S. Fishel R. Igarashi K. Kamiya K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 7028-7040Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Strikingly, mutations on both Lys-119 and Lys-120 residues of H2AX completely abolished monoubiquitination of H2AX, suggesting that Lys-119 and Lys-120 are two major monoubiquitination sites for H2AX (Fig. 1, A and B), consistent with a recent report (10Huen M.S. Grant R. Manke I. Minn K. Yu X. Yaffe M.B. Chen J. Cell. 2007; 131: 901-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Interestingly, RNF8 also failed to induce di-ubiquitination of the H2AX-K119R/K120R mutant (Fig. 1A), suggesting that monoubiquitination of H2AX is a prerequisite for H2AX di-ubiquitination induced by RNF8. To study the role of monoubiquitination of H2AX in DDR, we examined the effect of WT-H2AX and H2AX-K119R/K120R mutant on the recruitment of MDC1 to DNA foci upon IR. As expected, we found that H2AX−/− MEFs had a defect in the recruitment of MDC1 to DNA damage foci after 20 min of IR treatment using IFA (Fig. 2, A and C, and supplemental Fig. S1A). Although restoration of WT-H2AX into H2AX−/− MEFs by using the retroviral infection system rescued the ability of MDC1 to DNA damage foci, H2AX-K119R/K120R mutant failed to do so (Fig. 2, A and C, and supplemental Fig. S1A). To further confirm this phenomenon, we used a biochemical approach to isolate the chromatin fraction where the DNA damage sites are located, and we examined the recruitment of MDC1 to these regions upon IR. Consistent with the IFA results, Western blot analysis revealed that WT-H2AX restored the recruitment of MDC1 to the chromatin fraction in H2AX−/− MEFs in response to IR, but the H2AX-K119R/K120R mutant compromised this effect (Fig. 3A), which correlates with the fact that monoubiquitination of WT-H2AX in the chromatin fraction was enhanced by IR, but the K119R/mutant lost its ability to become monoubiquitinated (Fig. 3, A–C). These results suggest that monoubiquitination of H2AX is required for the recruitment of MDC1 to DNA damage foci. Because the binding of MDC1 to H2AX requires the formation of γ-H2AX upon IR (3Ayoub N. Jeyasekharan A.D. Bernal J.A. Venkitaraman A.R. Cell Cycle. 2009; 8: 1494-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 4van Attikum H. Gasser S.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2009; 19: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), we therefore determined whether H2AX monoubiquitination regulates the γ-H2AX formation upon IR. As expected, restoration of H2AX, but not of H2AX-K119R/K120R mutant, into H2AX−/− MEFs rescued the formation of γ-H2AX foci after 20 min of IR treatment using IFA (Fig. 2, A and B). We also performed the biochemical fractionation experiment to isolate the chromatin fraction and found that H2AX-K119R/K120R mutant drastically reduced its ability to induce the formation of γ-H2AX in both total cell extracts and chromatin fractions after 20 min of IR treatment compared with WT-H2AX and correlated with its defect in monoubiquitination (Fig. 3, A–C). These results suggest that monoubiquitination of H2AX positively regulates the formation of γ-H2AX in response to IR treatment. H2AX and MDC1 are known to play a critical role in IR sensitivity (3Ayoub N. Jeyasekharan A.D. Bernal J.A. Venkitaraman A.R. Cell Cycle. 2009; 8: 1494-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 4van Attikum H. Gasser S.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2009; 19: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). As we have revealed the critical role of H2AX monoubiquitination in γ-H2AX formation and the recruitment of MDC1 to sites of DNA breaks, we next determined whether monoubiquitination of H2AX regulates IR sensitivity. Notably, we found that although WT-H2AX restoration in H2AX−/− MEFs using the retroviral system caused the resistance of the cells to IR compared with mock restoration, H2AX-K119R/K120R mutant compromised this effect (Fig. 4). This result strongly suggests that monoubiquitination of H2AX plays a critical role in IR sensitivity. ATM is a critical kinase responsible for γ-H2AX upon IR, and it is highly possible that monoubiquitination of H2AX may either regulate ATM activation or the recruitment of ATM to the sites of DNA damage to induce γ-H2AX. To test this notion, we at first compared the degree of ATM activation and the recruitment of ATM to the sites of DNA damage between WT and H2AX−/− MEFs upon DNA damage. We found that the ATM phosphorylation (p-ATM) level in whole cell extracts upon IR was no different between WT and H2AX−/− MEFs, suggesting that H2AX is not required for ATM activation in response to IR treatment (Fig. 5A). However, the recruitment of ATM to the chromatin fraction upon IR was markedly impaired in H2AX−/− MEFs, which was correlated with a profound reduction in p-ATM levels in chromatin fractions (Fig. 5A). Similarly, we found that p-ATM foci induced by IR in H2AX−/− MEFs, as determined by IFA, was also drastically reduced compared with that in WT MEFs (Fig. 5, B and C, and supplemental Fig. S1B). We next determined whether monoubiquitination of H2AX regulates ATM recruitment to DNA foci in response to DNA damage, thereby facilitating the formation and γ-H2AX and MDC1 foci. Notably, we found that WT-H2AX restoration in H2AX−/− MEFs rescued the recruitment of ATM and p-ATM to the chromatin fraction and p-ATM foci, but restoration of H2AX-K119R/K120R mutant failed to do so (Fig. 6, A–C, and supplemental Fig. S1C). However, WT-H2AX and H2AX-K119R/K120R did not affect p-ATM level in whole cell extracts (Fig. 6B). Thus, monoubiquitination of H2AX orchestrates the recruitment of ATM to sites of DNA damage, in turn regulating γ-H2AX formation and the recruitment of MDC1 to the sites of DNA breaks. The polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), including BMI1 polycomb RING finger oncogene (BMI1) and RING finger protein 1 (RING1) and RNF2 (also known as RING2), was shown to display an E3 ligase for monoubiquitination of H2A and negatively regulates gene expression (23Cao R. Tsukada Y. Zhang Y. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 845-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar, 24Wang H. Wang L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Vidal M. Tempst P. Jones R.S. Zhang Y. Nature. 2004; 431: 873-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). Interestingly, BMI1 and RNF2 were recently shown to participate in DNA damage response and IR sensitivity by regulating the recruitment of tumor suppressor p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1), BRCA1, and RAP80 to DNA damage sites (25Ismail I.H. Andrin C. McDonald D. Hendzel M.J. J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 45-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Moreover, BMI1 and RNF2 were also shown to contribute to monoubiquitination of H2AX (25Ismail I.H. Andrin C. McDonald D. Hendzel M.J. J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 45-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), although the role of monoubiquitination of H2AX in DNA damage response was not examined. Consistent with this recent report (25Ismail I.H. Andrin C. McDonald D. Hendzel M.J. J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 45-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), we found that RNF2 was recruited to DNA damage foci upon IR treatment, and its overexpression promoted monoubiquitination of H2AX (Fig. 7, A and C). Given that monoubiquitination of H2AX plays an important role in γ-H2AX formation and that RNF2 triggers monoubiquitination of H2AX, RNF2 should also regulate the formation of γ-H2AX as monoubiquitination of H2AX does. To test this hypothesis, we generated control and RNF2 -knockdown U2OS cells by using siRNA against green fluorescent protein (GFP) and RING2. As expected, we found that the expression level of γ-H2AX and the formation of γ-H2AX foci were profoundly impaired in RNF2-knockdown U2OS cells compared with that in GFP knockdown cells, as determined by Western blot analysis and IFA (Fig. 7, B, D, and G, and supplemental Fig. S1D). Because monoubiquitination of H2AX regulates the recruitment of MDC1 to DNA foci upon IR, we next determine whether RNF2 recapitulates the function of monoubiquitination of H2AX. Although MDC1 was recruited to DNA damage foci in control U2OS cells upon IR, it was impaired in RNF2-knockdown U2OS cells (Fig. 7, E and H, and supplemental Fig. S1D). Likewise, we found that RNF2-knockdown U2OS cells displayed the defects in p-ATM foci compared with control U2OS cells (Fig. 7, F and I, and supplemental Fig. S1D). Thus, RNF2-mediated monoubiquitination of H2AX participates in the recruitment of ATM to DNA damage sites, in turn facilitating the formation of γ-H2AX and MDC1 foci. The formation of γ-H2AX by ATM kinase and other ATM-related kinases upon DSBs is known to provide a docking site for recruiting MDC1 to DNA damage foci, in turn facilitating the recruitment of BRCA1-RAP80 complex to DNA foci important for DNA repair (3Ayoub N. Jeyasekharan A.D. Bernal J.A. Venkitaraman A.R. Cell Cycle. 2009; 8: 1494-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 4van Attikum H. Gasser S.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2009; 19: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Our study reveals for the first time that monoubiquitination of H2AX at Lys-119/Lys-120, which is induced in the chromatin fraction by IR, plays a critical role in DDR by facilitating γ-H2AX formation and the recruitment of MDC1 to DNA damage foci. Mechanistically, we further show that monoubiquitination of H2AX is required for the recruitment of ATM to DNA damage foci, thus affecting the formation of γ-H2AX upon IR. Importantly, we demonstrate that monoubiquitination of H2AX plays a critical role in IR sensitivity. The recruitment of ATM to DNA damage foci represents an early event important for γ-H2AX formation and subsequent recruitment of DNA repair proteins to sites of DNA breaks for DNA repair. How exactly ATM is recruited to the DNA damage foci in response to DSBs remains unclear. Our finding that H2AX deficiency and H2AX monoubiquitination-dead mutant (H2AX-K119R/K120R) both display a defect in ATM recruitment to DNA damage foci but not ATM activation suggests that ATM activation may not occur in DNA damage foci during DSBs. Thus, the role of H2AX monoubiquitination induced by DSBs is to recruit active ATM to sites of DNA breaks to trigger γ-H2AX formation and subsequent recruitment of repair proteins to DNA foci. Recent studies identified RNF8 E3 ligase as a novel regulator important for DDR (10Huen M.S. Grant R. Manke I. Minn K. Yu X. Yaffe M.B. Chen J. Cell. 2007; 131: 901-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 11Mailand N. Bekker-Jensen S. Faustrup H. Melander F. Bartek J. Lukas C. Lukas J. Cell. 2007; 131: 887-900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar, 26Wang B. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 20759-20763Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). RNF8 was shown to regulate IR sensitivity by facilitating the recruitment of the RAP80-BRCA1 complex to DNA damage foci without affecting the formation of γ-H2AX and MDC1 foci. Thus, RNF8 functions downstream of MDC1 but upstream of RAP80. Although RNF8 plays an important role in DDR, how it participates in this process remains largely unclear. Interestingly, RNF8 was recently shown to trigger and contribute to di-ubiquitination and tri-ubiquitination of H2AX (10Huen M.S. Grant R. Manke I. Minn K. Yu X. Yaffe M.B. Chen J. Cell. 2007; 131: 901-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar), although the functional significance of H2AX ubiquitination remains to be determined. However, RNF8 is not required for monoubiquitination of H2AX and γ-H2AX, as RNF8 knockdown does not affect monoubiquitination of H2AX and γ-H2AX (10Huen M.S. Grant R. Manke I. Minn K. Yu X. Yaffe M.B. Chen J. Cell. 2007; 131: 901-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, we found that RNF8 overexpression did not promote monoubiquitination of H2AX (Fig. 1, A and B), suggesting that RNF8 is not an E3 ligase for monoubiquitination of H2AX. Importantly, we show that monoubiquitination of H2AX is also required for H2AX di-ubiquitination (Fig. 1A). We rationalize that monoubiquitination of H2AX may affect the recruitment of RNF8 to DNA damage foci upon IR, in turn regulating H2AX di-ubiquitination and polyubiquitination. Although H2AX di-ubiquitination and polyubiquitination are elicited during DDB, their role in DDR is currently unclear. Given that the loss of RNF8 only affects the recruitment of the RAP80-BRCA1 complex to DNA damage sites, but not MDC1 recruitment and γ-H2AX foci (10Huen M.S. Grant R. Manke I. Minn K. Yu X. Yaffe M.B. Chen J. Cell. 2007; 131: 901-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 11Mailand N. Bekker-Jensen S. Faustrup H. Melander F. Bartek J. Lukas C. Lukas J. Cell. 2007; 131: 887-900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that di-ubiquitination and tri-ubiquitination of H2AX does not participate in ATM recruitment, γ-H2AX formation, and the formation of MDC1 foci. We show here, however, that monoubiquitination of H2AX indeed plays an important role in these processes. Thus, it is unlikely that monoubiquitination of H2AX regulates ATM recruitment, γ-H2AX formation, and the formation of MDC1 foci indirectly through affecting di-ubiquitination and tri-ubiquitination of H2AX. What is the E3 ligase responsible for monoubiquitination of H2AX? One recent study suggests that a polycomb-repressive complex-1, including BMI1, RING1, and RING2 (RNF2), is likely an E3 ligase for monoubiquitination of H2AX, as BMI1 deficiency or knockdown inhibits H2AX monoubiquitination (25Ismail I.H. Andrin C. McDonald D. Hendzel M.J. J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 45-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, we found that RNF2 overexpression promotes in vivo H2AX monoubiquitination (Fig. 7A). Moreover, we provide the evidence that monoubiquitination of H2AX elicited by RNF2 is critical for the recruitment of ATM to sites of DNA breaks, in turn facilitating γ-H2AX formation and the recruitment of MDC1 to DNA damage foci. Thus, it is likely that RNF2 regulates the recruitment of DNA repair proteins, such as RAP80, BRCA1, and 53BP1, to DNA damage sites and IR sensitivity by regulating monoubiquitination of H2AX, in turn facilitating ATM recruitment, γ-H2AX formation, and MDC1 foci formation. In a previous article, Lin and co-workers (32Pan M.R. Peng G. Hung W.C. Lin S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 28599-28607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) demonstrated that H2AX monoubiquitination is also induced by BMI1 and RNF2 and plays a critical role in facilitating γ-H2AX formation and the recruitment of MDC1 to DNA foci, supporting our conclusion that H2AX monoubiquitination is critical for DNA damage response. However, it should be noted that two earlier reports revealed that H2AX monoubiquitination at Lys-119/Lys-120 does not obviously affect IR-induced γ-H2AX levels (10Huen M.S. Grant R. Manke I. Minn K. Yu X. Yaffe M.B. Chen J. Cell. 2007; 131: 901-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 27Wu J. Huen M.S. Lu L.Y. Ye L. Dou Y. Ljungman M. Chen J. Yu X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 849-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), which is different from our current observation that monoubiquitination of H2AX at Lys-119/Lys-120 plays a positive role in regulating γ-H2AX formation. Although such discrepancy remains unclear, the possible explanation for it may be due to the distinct time course analyzed in the experiments. In our case, we analyzed γ-H2AX at an early time point (within 30 min), whereas these two studies (10Huen M.S. Grant R. Manke I. Minn K. Yu X. Yaffe M.B. Chen J. Cell. 2007; 131: 901-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 27Wu J. Huen M.S. Lu L.Y. Ye L. Dou Y. Ljungman M. Chen J. Yu X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 849-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) examined it at late time point (4–6 h). These results are indeed consistent with the current model indicating that ATM positively regulates γ-H2AX only at early time points (within 30 min), but not at late time points (>1 h) (28Kinner A. Wu W. Staudt C. Iliakis G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 5678-5694Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 29Kühne M. Riballo E. Rief N. Rothkamm K. Jeggo P.A. Löbrich M.

Physiol. 2005; 202: 492-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Thus, monoubiquitination of H2AX may affect γ-H2AX only at early time points, but not at late time points, by regulating the recruitment of ATM to DNA damage foci. On the basis of our finding, we propose a working model by which monoubiquitination of H2AX regulates DDR (Fig. 8). Upon IR treatment, the BMI1-RNF2-RING1 E3 ligase complex is recruited to DNA damage foci and subsequently induced monoubiquitination of H2AX, which in turn facilitates the recruitment of active ATM to DNA damage foci, followed by facilitating the formation of γ-H2AX and the recruitment of MDC1 and other DNA repair proteins to DNA damage sites. Our study therefore reveals an important cross-talk between H2AX monoubiquitination and H2AX phosphorylation, providing novel paradigms for DDR and potentially therapeutic strategies for the treatment of human cancers.

https://openalex.org/W2009463566,"Background Transfer RNAs are synthesized as a primary transcript that is processed to produce a mature tRNA. As part of the maturation process, a subset of the nucleosides are modified. Modifications in the anticodon region often modulate the decoding ability of the tRNA. At position 34, the majority of yeast cytosolic tRNA species that have a uridine are modified to 5-carbamoylmethyluridine (ncm5U), 5-carbamoylmethyl-2′-O-methyluridine (ncm5Um), 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-uridine (mcm5U) or 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiouridine (mcm5s2U). The formation of mcm5 and ncm5 side chains involves a complex pathway, where the last step in formation of mcm5 is a methyl esterification of cm5 dependent on the Trm9 and Trm112 proteins. Methodology and Principal Findings Both Trm9 and Trm112 are required for the last step in formation of mcm5 side chains at wobble uridines. By co-expressing a histidine-tagged Trm9p together with a native Trm112p in E. coli, these two proteins purified as a complex. The presence of Trm112p dramatically improves the methyltransferase activity of Trm9p in vitro. Single tRNA species that normally contain mcm5U or mcm5s2U nucleosides were isolated from trm9Δ or trm112Δ mutants and the presence of modified nucleosides was analyzed by HPLC. In both mutants, mcm5U and mcm5s2U nucleosides are absent in tRNAs and the major intermediates accumulating were ncm5U and ncm5s2U, not the expected cm5U and cm5s2U. Conclusions Trm9p and Trm112p function together at the final step in formation of mcm5U in tRNA by using the intermediate cm5U as a substrate. In tRNA isolated from trm9Δ and trm112Δ strains, ncm5U and ncm5s2U nucleosides accumulate, questioning the order of nucleoside intermediate formation of the mcm5 side chain. We propose two alternative explanations for this observation. One is that the intermediate cm5U is generated from ncm5U by a yet unknown mechanism and the other is that cm5U is formed before ncm5U and mcm5U."
https://openalex.org/W2048064978,"Background Bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMV) are packets of periplasmic material that, via the proteins and other molecules they contain, project metabolic function into the environment. While OMV production is widespread in proteobacteria, they have been extensively studied only in pathogens, which inhabit fully hydrated environments. However, many (arguably most) bacterial habitats, such as soil, are only partially hydrated. In the latter, water is characteristically distributed as films on soil particles that are, on average thinner, than are typical OMV (ca. ≤10 nm water film vs. 20 to >200 nm OMV;). Methodology/Principal Findings We have identified a new bacterial surface structure, termed a “nanopod”, that is a conduit for projecting OMV significant distances (e.g., ≥6 µm) from the cell. Electron cryotomography was used to determine nanopod three-dimensional structure, which revealed chains of vesicles within an undulating, tubular element. By using immunoelectron microscopy, proteomics, heterologous expression and mutagenesis, the tubes were determined to be an assembly of a surface layer protein (NpdA), and the interior structures identified as OMV. Specific metabolic function(s) for nanopods produced by Delftia sp. Cs1-4 are not yet known. However, a connection with phenanthrene degradation is a possibility since nanopod formation was induced by growth on phenanthrene. Orthologs of NpdA were identified in three other genera of the Comamonadaceae family, and all were experimentally verified to form nanopods. Conclusions/Significance Nanopods are new bacterial organelles, and establish a new paradigm in the mechanisms by which bacteria effect long-distance interactions with their environment. Specifically, they create a pathway through which cells can effectively deploy OMV, and the biological activity these transmit, in a diffusion-independent manner. Nanopods would thus allow environmental bacteria to expand their metabolic sphere of influence in a manner previously unknown for these organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2170649849,"Chronic psychological stress is associated with accelerated aging, but the underlying biological mechanisms are not known. Prolonged elevations of the stress hormone cortisol is suspected to play a critical role. Through its actions, cortisol may potentially induce oxidatively generated damage to cellular constituents such as DNA and RNA, a phenomenon which has been implicated in aging processes. We investigated the relationship between 24 h excretion of urinary cortisol and markers of oxidatively generated DNA and RNA damage, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-deoxyguanosine and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine, in a sample of 220 elderly men and women (age 65 – 83 years). We found a robust association between the excretion of cortisol and the oxidation markers (R2 = 0.15, P<0.001 for both markers). Individuals in the highest quartile of cortisol excretion had a 57% and 61% higher median excretion of the DNA and RNA oxidation marker, respectively, than individuals in the lowest quartile. The finding adds support to the hypothesis that cortisol-induced damage to DNA/RNA is an explanatory factor in the complex relation between stress, aging and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2167600193,"The adsorption of proteins on inorganic surfaces is of fundamental biological importance. Further, biomedical and nanotechnological applications increasingly use interfaces between inorganic material and polypeptides. Yet, the underlying adsorption mechanism of polypeptides on surfaces is not well understood and experimentally difficult to analyze. Therefore, we investigate here the interactions of polypeptides with a gold(111) surface using computational molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with a polarizable gold model in explicit water. Our focus in this paper is the investigation of the interaction of polypeptides with β-sheet folds. First, we concentrate on a β-sheet forming model peptide. Second, we investigate the interactions of two domains with high β-sheet content of the biologically important extracellular matrix protein fibronectin (FN). We find that adsorption occurs in a stepwise mechanism both for the model peptide and the protein. The positively charged amino acid Arg facilitates the initial contact formation between protein and gold surface. Our results suggest that an effective gold-binding surface patch is overall uncharged, but contains Arg for contact initiation. The polypeptides do not unfold on the gold surface within the simulation time. However, for the two FN domains, the relative domain-domain orientation changes. The observation of a very fast and strong adsorption indicates that in a biological matrix, no bare gold surfaces will be present. Hence, the bioactivity of gold surfaces (like bare gold nanoparticles) will critically depend on the history of particle administration and the proteins present during initial contact between gold and biological material. Further, gold particles may act as seeds for protein aggregation. Structural re-organization and protein aggregation are potentially of immunological importance."
https://openalex.org/W2028969161,"We have previously demonstrated that the globular head of the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen fused to flagellin of Salmonella typhimurium fljB (STF2, a TLR5 ligand) elicits protective immunity to H1N1 and H5N1 lethal influenza infections in mice (Song et al., 2008, PLoS ONE 3, e2257; Song et al., 2009, Vaccine 27, 5875–5888). These fusion proteins can be efficiently and economically manufactured in E. coli fermentation systems as next generation pandemic and seasonal influenza vaccines. Here we report immunogenicity and efficacy results of three vaccine candidates in which the HA globular head of A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) was fused to STF2 at the C-terminus (STF2.HA1), in replace of domain 3 (STF2R3.HA1), or in both positions (STF2R3.2xHA1). For all three vaccines, two subcutaneous immunizations of BALB/c mice with doses of either 0.3 or 3 µg elicit robust neutralizing (HAI) antibodies, that lead to > = 2 Log10 unit reduction in day 4 lung virus titer and full protection against a lethal A/California/04/2009 challenge. Vaccination with doses as low as 0.03 µg results in partial to full protection. Each candidate, particularly the STF2R3.HA1 and STF2R3.2xHA1 candidates, elicits robust neutralizing antibody responses that last for at least 8 months. The STF2R3.HA1 candidate, which was intermediately protective in the challenge models, is more immunogenic than the H1N1 components of two commercially available trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (TIVs) in mice. Taken together, the results demonstrate that all three vaccine candidates are highly immunogenic and efficacious in mice, and that the STF2R3.2xHA1 format is the most effective candidate vaccine format."
https://openalex.org/W2057309715,"Importin α1 can bind classical nuclear localization signals (NLSs) in two NLS-binding sites, known as ""major"" and ""minor."" The major site is located between ARM repeats 2-4, whereas the minor site spans ARM 7-8. In this study, we have characterized the cellular localization of human phospholipid scramblase 4 (hPLSCR4), a member of the phospholipid scramblase protein family. We identified a minimal NLS in hPLSCR4 ((273)GSIIRKWN(280)) that contains only two basic amino acids. This NLS is both necessary for nuclear localization of hPLSCR4 in transfected HeLa cells and sufficient for nuclear import of a non-diffusible cargo in permeabilized cells. Mutation of only one of the two basic residues, Arg(277), correlates with loss of nuclear localization, suggesting this amino acid plays a key role in nuclear transport. Crystallographic analysis of mammalian importin α1 in complex with the hPLSCR4-NLS reveals this minimal NLS binds specifically and exclusively to the minor binding site of importin α. These data provide the first structural and functional evidence of a novel NLS-binding mode in importin α1 that uses only the minor groove as the exclusive site for nuclear import of nonclassical cargos."
https://openalex.org/W2052655247,"The systemic clinical symptoms of Plasmodium falciparum infection such as fever and chills correspond to the proinflammatory cytokines produced in response to the parasite components released during the synchronized rupture of schizonts. We recently demonstrated that, among the schizont-released products, merozoites are the predominant components that activate dendritic cells (DCs) by TLR9-specific recognition to induce the maturation of cells and to produce proinflammatory cytokines. We also demonstrated that DNA is the active constituent and that formation of a DNA-protein complex is essential for the entry of parasite DNA into cells for recognition by TLR9. However, the nature of endogenous protein-DNA complex in the parasite is not known. In this study, we show that parasite nucleosome constitute the major protein-DNA complex involved in the activation of DCs by parasite nuclear material. The parasite components were fractionated into the nuclear and non-nuclear materials. The nuclear material was further fractionated into chromatin and the proteins loosely bound to chromatin. Polynucleosomes and oligonucleosomes were prepared from the chromatin. These were tested for their ability to activate DCs obtained by the FLT3 ligand differentiation of bone marrow cells from the wild type, and TLR2−/−, TLR9−/− and MyD88−/− mice. DCs stimulated with the nuclear material and polynucleosomes as well as mono- and oligonucleosomes efficiently induced the production of proinflammatory cytokines in a TLR9-dependent manner, demonstrating that nucleosomes (histone-DNA complex) represent the major TLR9-specific DC-immunostimulatory component of the malaria parasite nuclear material. Thus, our data provide a significant insight into the activation of DCs by malaria parasites and have important implications for malaria vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W2022325790,"Background Misfolding and self-assembly of Amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides into amyloid fibrils is pathologically linked to the development of Alzheimer's disease. Polymorphic Aβ structures derived from monomers to intermediate oligomers, protofilaments, and mature fibrils have been often observed in solution. Some aggregates are on-pathway species to amyloid fibrils, while the others are off-pathway species that do not evolve into amyloid fibrils. Both on-pathway and off-pathway species could be biologically relevant species. But, the lack of atomic-level structural information for these Aβ species leads to the difficulty in the understanding of their biological roles in amyloid toxicity and amyloid formation. Methods and Findings Here, we model a series of molecular structures of Aβ globulomers assembled by monomer and dimer building blocks using our peptide-packing program and explicit-solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Structural and energetic analysis shows that although Aβ globulomers could adopt different energetically favorable but structurally heterogeneous conformations in a rugged energy landscape, they are still preferentially organized by dynamic dimeric subunits with a hydrophobic core formed by the C-terminal residues independence of initial peptide packing and organization. Such structural organizations offer high structural stability by maximizing peptide-peptide association and optimizing peptide-water solvation. Moreover, curved surface, compact size, and less populated β-structure in Aβ globulomers make them difficult to convert into other high-order Aβ aggregates and fibrils with dominant β-structure, suggesting that they are likely to be off-pathway species to amyloid fibrils. These Aβ globulomers are compatible with experimental data in overall size, subunit organization, and molecular weight from AFM images and H/D amide exchange NMR. Conclusions Our computationally modeled Aβ globulomers provide useful insights into structure, dynamics, and polymorphic nature of Aβ globulomers which are completely different from Aβ fibrils, suggesting that these globulomers are likely off-pathway species and explaining the independence of the aggregation kinetics between Aβ globulomers and fibrils."
https://openalex.org/W2077148929,"Dysregulation of liver functions leads to insulin resistance causing type 2 diabetes mellitus and is often found in chronic liver diseases. However, the mechanisms of hepatic dysfunction leading to hepatic metabolic disorder are still poorly understood in chronic liver diseases. The current work investigated the role of hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) in regulating glucose metabolism. We studied HBx-overexpressing (HBxTg) mice and HBxTg mice lacking inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Here we show that gene expressions of the key gluconeogenic enzymes were significantly increased in HepG2 cells expressing HBx (HepG2-HBx) and in non-tumor liver tissues of hepatitis B virus patients with high levels of HBx expression. In the liver of HBxTg mice, the expressions of gluconeogenic genes were also elevated, leading to hyperglycemia by increasing hepatic glucose production. However, this effect was insufficient to cause systemic insulin resistance. Importantly, the actions of HBx on hepatic glucose metabolism are thought to be mediated via iNOS signaling, as evidenced by the fact that deficiency of iNOS restored HBx-induced hyperglycemia by suppressing the gene expression of gluconeogenic enzymes. Treatment of HepG2-HBx cells with nitric oxide (NO) caused a significant increase in the expression of gluconeogenic genes, but JNK1 inhibition was completely normalized. Furthermore, hyperactivation of JNK1 in the liver of HBxTg mice was also suppressed in the absence of iNOS, indicating the critical role for JNK in the mutual regulation of HBx- and iNOS-mediated glucose metabolism. These findings establish a novel mechanism of HBx-driven hepatic metabolic disorder that is modulated by iNOS-mediated activation of JNK."
https://openalex.org/W1967761082,"Background Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is a mitochondrial rare disease, which molecular origin is associated with defect in the expression of frataxin. The pathological consequences are degeneration of nervous system structures and cardiomyopathy with necrosis and fibrosis, among others. Principal Findings Using FRDA fibroblasts we have characterized the oxidative stress status and mitochondrial biogenesis. We observed deficiency of MnSOD, increased ROS levels and low levels of ATP. Expression of PGC-1α and mtTFA was increased and the active form of the upstream signals p38 MAPK and AMPK in fibroblasts from two patients. Interestingly, the expression of energetic factors correlated with the natural history of disease of the patients, the age when skin biopsy was performed and the size of the GAA expanded alleles. Furthermore, idebenone inhibit mitochondriogenic responses in FRDA cells. Conclusions The induction of mitochondrial biogenesis in FRDA may be a consequence of the mitochondrial impairment associated with disease evolution. The increase of ROS and the involvement of the oxidative phosphorylation may be an early event in the cell pathophysiology of frataxin deficiency, whereas increase of mitochondriogenic response might be a later phenomenon associated to the individual age and natural history of the disease, being more evident as the patient age increases and disease evolves. This is a possible explanation of heart disease in FRDA."
https://openalex.org/W2094822389,"Background Because pain often signals the occurrence of potential tissue damage, a nociceptive stimulus has the capacity to involuntarily capture attention and take priority over other sensory inputs. Whether distraction by nociception actually occurs may depend upon the cognitive characteristics of the ongoing activities. The present study tested the role of working memory in controlling the attentional capture by nociception. Methodology and Principal Findings Participants performed visual discrimination and matching tasks in which visual targets were shortly preceded by a tactile distracter. The two tasks were chosen because of the different effects the involvement of working memory produces on performance, in order to dissociate the specific role of working memory in the control of attention from the effect of general resource demands. Occasionally (i.e. 17% of the trials), tactile distracters were replaced by a novel nociceptive stimulus in order to distract participants from the visual tasks. Indeed, in the control conditions (no working memory), reaction times to visual targets were increased when the target was preceded by a novel nociceptive distracter as compared to the target preceded by a frequent tactile distracter, suggesting attentional capture by the novel nociceptive stimulus. However, when the task required an active rehearsal of the visual target in working memory, the novel nociceptive stimulus no longer induced a lengthening of reaction times to visual targets, indicating a reduction of the distraction produced by the novel nociceptive stimulus. This effect was independent of the overall task demands. Conclusion and Significance Loading working memory with pain-unrelated information may reduce the ability of nociceptive input to involuntarily capture attention, and shields cognitive processing from nociceptive distraction. An efficient control of attention over pain is best guaranteed by the ability to maintain active goal priorities during achievement of cognitive activities and to keep pain-related information out of task settings."
https://openalex.org/W2034809458,"Despite the importance of early life stages in individuals' life history and population dynamics, very few studies have focused on the constraints to which these juvenile traits are subjected. Based on 10 years of automatic monitoring of over 2500 individuals, we present the first study on the effects of environmental conditions and individual pre-fledging traits on the post-fledging return of non-banded king penguins to their natal colony. Juvenile king penguins returned exclusively within one of the three austral summers following their departure. A key finding is that return rates (range 68-87%) were much higher than previously assumed for this species, importantly meaning that juvenile survival is very close to that of adults. Such high figures suggest little juvenile dispersal, and selection occurring mostly prior to fledging in king penguins. Pre-fledging conditions had a strong quadratic impact on juvenile return rates. As expected, cohorts reared under very unfavourable years (as inferred by the breeding success of the colony) exhibited low return rates but surprisingly, so did those fledged under very favourable conditions. Juvenile sojourns away from the colony were shorter under warm conditions and subsequent return rates higher, suggesting a positive effect of climate warming. The longer the post-fledging trip (1, 2 or 3 years), the earlier in the summer birds returned to their natal colony and the longer they stayed before leaving for the winter journey. The presence of juveniles in the colony was more than twice the duration required for moulting purposes, yet none attempted breeding in the year of their first return. Juvenile presence in the colony may be important for acquiring knowledge on the social and physical colonial environment and may play an important part in the learning process of mating behaviour. Further studies are required to investigate its potential implications on other life-history traits such as recruitment age."
https://openalex.org/W1995061985,"Cytoplasmic caspase recruiting domain (CARD)-containing molecules often function in the induction of potent antimicrobial responses in order to protect mammalian cells from invading pathogens. Retinoic acid-induced gene-I (RIG-I) and nucleotide binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) serve as key factors in the detection of viral and bacterial pathogens, and in the subsequent initiation of innate immune signals to combat infection. RIG-I and NOD2 share striking similarities in their cellular localization, both localize to membrane ruffles in non-polarized epithelial cells and both exhibit a close association with the junctional complex of polarized epithelia. Here we show that RIG-I and NOD2 not only colocalize to cellular ruffles and cell-cell junctions, but that they also form a direct interaction that is mediated by the CARDs of RIG-I and multiple regions of NOD2. Moreover, we show that RIG-I negatively regulates ligand-induced nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling mediated by NOD2, and that NOD2 negatively regulates type I interferon induction by RIG-I. We also show that the three main Crohn disease-associated mutants of NOD2 (1007fs, R702W, G908R) form an interaction with RIG-I and negatively regulate its signaling to a greater extent than wild-type NOD2. Our results show that in addition to their role in innate immune recognition, RIG-I and NOD2 form a direct interaction at actin-enriched sites within cells and suggest that this interaction may impact RIG-I- and NOD2-dependent innate immune signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1964792621,"P2X receptors are ATP-gated cation channels. The x-ray structure of a P2X4 receptor provided a major advance in understanding the molecular basis of receptor properties. However, how agonists are coordinated, the extent of the binding site, and the contribution of the vestibules in the extracellular domain to ionic permeation have not been addressed. We have used cysteine-scanning mutagenesis to determine the contribution of residues Glu(52)-Gly(96) to human P2X1 receptor properties. ATP potency was reduced for the mutants K68C, K70C, and F92C. The efficacy of the partial agonist BzATP was also reduced for several mutants forming the back of the proposed agonist binding site. Molecular docking in silico of both ATP and BzATP provided models of the agonist binding site consistent with these data. Individual cysteine mutants had no effect or slightly increased antagonism by suramin or pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulfonate. Mutants at the entrance to and lining the upper vestibule were unaffected by cysteine-reactive methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents, suggesting that it does not contribute to ionic permeation. Mutants that were sensitive to modification by MTS reagents were predominantly found either around the proposed ATP binding pocket or on the strands connecting the binding pocket to the transmembrane region and lining the central vestibule. In particular, ATP sensitivity and currents were increased by a positively charged MTS reagent at the G60C mutant at the interface between the central and extracellular vestibule. This suggests that dilation of the base of the central vestibule contributes to gating of the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2053670662,"Large-scale proliferation and multi-lineage differentiation capabilities make neural stem cells (NSCs) a promising renewable source of cells for therapeutic applications. However, the practical application for neuronal cell replacement is limited by heterogeneity of NSC progeny, relatively low yield of neurons, predominance of astrocytes, poor survival of donor cells following transplantation and the potential for uncontrolled proliferation of precursor cells. To address these impediments, we have developed a method for the generation of highly enriched immature neurons from murine NSC progeny. Adaptation of the standard differentiation procedure in concert with flow cytometry selection, using scattered light and positive fluorescent light selection based on cell surface antibody binding, provided a near pure (97%) immature neuron population. Using the purified neurons, we screened a panel of growth factors and found that bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP-4) demonstrated a strong survival effect on the cells in vitro, and enhanced their functional maturity. This effect was maintained following transplantation into the adult mouse striatum where we observed a 2-fold increase in the survival of the implanted cells and a 3-fold increase in NeuN expression. Additionally, based on the neural-colony forming cell assay (N-CFCA), we noted a 64 fold reduction of the bona fide NSC frequency in neuronal cell population and that implanted donor cells showed no signs of excessive or uncontrolled proliferation. The ability to provide defined neural cell populations from renewable sources such as NSC may find application for cell replacement therapies in the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2081275125,"Patient-specific analysis of molecular networks is a promising strategy for making individual risk predictions and treatment decisions in cancer therapy. Although systems biology allows the gene network of a cell to be reconstructed from clinical gene expression data, traditional methods, such as Bayesian networks, only provide an averaged network for all samples. Therefore, these methods cannot reveal patient-specific differences in molecular networks during cancer progression. In this study, we developed a novel statistical method called NetworkProfiler, which infers patient-specific gene regulatory networks for a specific clinical characteristic, such as cancer progression, from gene expression data of cancer patients. We applied NetworkProfiler to microarray gene expression data from 762 cancer cell lines and extracted the system changes that were related to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Out of 1732 possible regulators of E-cadherin, a cell adhesion molecule that modulates the EMT, NetworkProfiler, identified 25 candidate regulators, of which about half have been experimentally verified in the literature. In addition, we used NetworkProfiler to predict EMT-dependent master regulators that enhanced cell adhesion, migration, invasion, and metastasis. In order to further evaluate the performance of NetworkProfiler, we selected Krueppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) from a list of the remaining candidate regulators of E-cadherin and conducted in vitro validation experiments. As a result, we found that knockdown of KLF5 by siRNA significantly decreased E-cadherin expression and induced morphological changes characteristic of EMT. In addition, in vitro experiments of a novel candidate EMT-related microRNA, miR-100, confirmed the involvement of miR-100 in several EMT-related aspects, which was consistent with the predictions obtained by NetworkProfiler."
https://openalex.org/W1993588442,"Background Little is known about the combined impacts of global environmental changes and ecological disturbances on ecosystem functioning, even though such combined impacts might play critical roles in shaping ecosystem processes that can in turn feed back to climate change, such as soil emissions of greenhouse gases. Methodology/Principal Findings We took advantage of an accidental, low-severity wildfire that burned part of a long-term global change experiment to investigate the interactive effects of a fire disturbance and increases in CO2 concentration, precipitation and nitrogen supply on soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in a grassland ecosystem. We examined the responses of soil N2O emissions, as well as the responses of the two main microbial processes contributing to soil N2O production – nitrification and denitrification – and of their main drivers. We show that the fire disturbance greatly increased soil N2O emissions over a three-year period, and that elevated CO2 and enhanced nitrogen supply amplified fire effects on soil N2O emissions: emissions increased by a factor of two with fire alone and by a factor of six under the combined influence of fire, elevated CO2 and nitrogen. We also provide evidence that this response was caused by increased microbial denitrification, resulting from increased soil moisture and soil carbon and nitrogen availability in the burned and fertilized plots. Conclusions/Significance Our results indicate that the combined effects of fire and global environmental changes can exceed their effects in isolation, thereby creating unexpected feedbacks to soil greenhouse gas emissions. These findings highlight the need to further explore the impacts of ecological disturbances on ecosystem functioning in the context of global change if we wish to be able to model future soil greenhouse gas emissions with greater confidence."
https://openalex.org/W2005587943,"The importance of rhamnolipid to swarming of the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa is well established. It is frequently, but not exclusively, observed that P. aeruginosa swarms in tendril patterns—formation of these tendrils requires rhamnolipid. We were interested to explain the impact of surface changes on P. aeruginosa swarm tendril development. Here we report that P. aeruginosa quorum sensing and rhamnolipid production is impaired when growing on harder semi-solid surfaces. P. aeruginosa wild-type swarms showed huge variation in tendril formation with small deviations to the “standard” swarm agar concentration of 0.5%. These macroscopic differences correlated with microscopic investigation of cells close to the advancing swarm edge using fluorescent gene reporters. Tendril swarms showed significant rhlA-gfp reporter expression right up to the advancing edge of swarming cells while swarms without tendrils (grown on harder agar) showed no rhlA-gfp reporter expression near the advancing edge. This difference in rhamnolipid gene expression can be explained by the necessity of quorum sensing for rhamnolipid production. We provide evidence that harder surfaces seem to limit induction of quorum sensing genes near the advancing swarm edge and these localized effects were sufficient to explain the lack of tendril formation on hard agar. We were unable to artificially stimulate rhamnolipid tendril formation with added acyl-homoserine lactone signals or increasing the carbon nutrients. This suggests that quorum sensing on surfaces is controlled in a manner that is not solely population dependent."
https://openalex.org/W2131286559,"Predators can strongly influence prey populations and the structure and function of ecosystems, but these effects can be modified by environmental stress. For example, fluid velocity and turbulence can alter the impact of predators by limiting their environmental range and altering their foraging ability. We investigated how hydrodynamics affected the foraging behavior of the green crab (Carcinus maenas), which is invading marine habitats throughout the world. High flow velocities are known to reduce green crab predation rates and our study sought to identify the mechanisms by which flow affects green crabs. We performed a series of experiments with green crabs to determine: 1) if their ability to find prey was altered by flow in the field, 2) how flow velocity influenced their foraging efficiency, and 3) how flow velocity affected their handling time of prey. In a field study, we caught significantly fewer crabs in baited traps at sites with fast versus slow flows even though crabs were more abundant in high flow areas. This finding suggests that higher velocity flows impair the ability of green crabs to locate prey. In laboratory flume assays, green crabs foraged less efficiently when flow velocity was increased. Moreover, green crabs required significantly more time to consume prey in high velocity flows. Our data indicate that flow can impose significant chemosensory and physical constraints on green crabs. Hence, hydrodynamics may strongly influence the role that green crabs and other predators play in rocky intertidal communities."
https://openalex.org/W2005364288,"The coordinated motion of a cell is fundamental to many important biological processes such as development, wound healing, and phagocytosis. For eukaryotic cells, such as amoebae or animal cells, the cell motility is based on crawling and involves a complex set of internal biochemical events. A recent study reported very interesting crawling behavior of single cell amoeba: in the absence of an external cue, free amoebae move randomly with a noisy, yet, discernible sequence of 'run-and-turns' analogous to the 'run-and-tumbles' of swimming bacteria. Interestingly, amoeboid trajectories favor zigzag turns. In other words, the cells bias their crawling by making a turn in the opposite direction to a previous turn. This property enhances the long range directional persistence of the moving trajectories. This study proposes that such a zigzag crawling behavior can be a general property of any crawling cells by demonstrating that 1) microglia, which are the immune cells of the brain, and 2) a simple rule-based model cell, which incorporates the actual biochemistry and mechanics behind cell crawling, both exhibit similar type of crawling behavior. Almost all legged animals walk by alternating their feet. Similarly, all crawling cells appear to move forward by alternating the direction of their movement, even though the regularity and degree of zigzag preference vary from one type to the other."

In evoked neurotransmission, interactions between SNAREs and the Munc18-1 protein, a member of the Sec1/Munc18 (SM) protein family, are essential for exocytosis, whereas other SM proteins are dispensable. To address if the exclusivity of Munc18-1 demonstrated in neuroexocytosis also applied to fast insulin secretion, we characterized the presence and function of Munc18-1 and its closest homologue Munc18-2 in β-cell stimulus-secretion coupling. We show that pancreatic β-cells express both Munc18-1 and Munc18-2. The two Munc18 homologues exhibit different subcellular localization, and only Munc18-1 redistributes in response to glucose stimulation. However, both Munc18-1 and Munc18-2 augment glucose-stimulated hormone release.

Such a key accessory regulator in synaptic transmission is Munc18-1, a member of the Munc18 (mammalian homologue of the unc-18 gene) family (6Verhage M. Maia A.S. Plomp J.J. Brussaard A.B. Heeroma J.H. Vermeer H. Toonen R.F. Hammer R.E. van den Berg T.K. Missler M. Geuze H.J. Südhof T.C. Science. 2000; 287: 864-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). In addition to Munc18-1 (with two alternatively spliced variants, Munc18-1a and Munc18-1b), Munc18-2 and Munc18-3 isoforms have also been identified (7Hata Y. Südhof T.C. J. Biol.

Neurochem. 1996; 66: 889-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Munc18-2, also named Munc18b or muSec1 (mammalian ubiquitously Sec1), is the closest homologue of Munc18-1, showing 63% amino acid sequence identity (7Hata Y. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13022-13028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar).The 67-kDa hydrophilic Munc18-1 protein has been shown to be necessary not only for vesicle exocytosis but also for docking of vesicles to the plasma membrane (10Burgoyne R.D. Barclay J.W. Ciufo L.F. Graham M.E. Handley M.T. Morgan A. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2009; 1152: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Indeed, in the absence of Munc18-1 in neuronal cells, neither evoked nor spontaneous neurotransmission can operate (6Verhage M. Maia A.S. Plomp J.J. Brussaard A.B. Heeroma J.H. Vermeer H. Toonen R.F.

However, besides the reported positive effect of Munc18-1 in regulated exocytosis (6Verhage M. Maia A.S. Plomp J.J. Brussaard A.B. Heeroma J.H. Vermeer H. Toonen R.F. Hammer R.E. van den Berg T.K.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 360: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Still, Munc18-1 is primarily considered to be a neuronal protein, whereas the homologue Munc18-2 has a wider tissue expression profile. For instance, Munc18-2 is prominent in epithelial cells (16Riento K. Jäntti J. Jansson S. Hielm S. Lehtonen E. Ehnholm C. Keränen S. Olkkonen V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 638-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and has been identified as a binding partner of Cab45, a Ca2+-binding protein prominent in pancreatic acini (17Lam P.P. Hyvärinen K. Kauppi M. Cosen-Binker L. Laitinen S. Keränen S. Gaisano H.Y. Olkkonen V.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2473-2480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently Cab45/Munc18-2 was also detected in the endocrine β-cell (18Zhang Y. Kang Y.H. Chang N. Lam P.P. Liu Y. Olkkonen V.M. Gaisano H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 20840-20847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Munc18-2 exhibits the same syntaxin selectivity as Munc18-1 by binding syntaxin 1A, 2, and 3 (7Hata Y.

Worth mentioning is also that Munc18-2 has been shown to increase the secretory capacity of other mammalian cells, such as HeLa, HEK-293, and HT-1080 cells, and a mutation in the gene encoding Munc18-2 has been reported to impair cytotoxic granule exocytosis and cause familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis type 5, FHL-5 (20Peng R.W.

Munc18-3 is expressed ubiquitously and has been demonstrated to be a functional partner of syntaxin 4 in the regulation of insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT-4 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (22Tellam J.T.

Diabetes. 2009; 58: 1165-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).Phosphorylation of Munc18 proteins has been shown to affect exocytosis. Two kinases that have been identified to modify the function of Munc18-1 are cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) and protein kinase C (PKC) (26Snyder D.A. Kelly M.L. Woodbury D.J. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 45: 111-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cdk5 is a small serine/threonine kinase that plays a pivotal role in many, in particular neuronal, processes by phosphorylating several different substrates (27Dhavan R. Tsai L.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar, 28Lalioti V. Pulido D. Sandoval I.V. Cell Cycle. 2010; 9: 284-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, emerging evidence has demonstrated that Cdk5 is also vital in non-neuronal tissues, for example during muscle development, wound healing, and in insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells (29Lilja L. Johansson J.U. Gromada J. Mandic S.A. Fried G. Berggren P.O. Bark C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29534-29541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 30Lilja L. Yang S.N.

BioEssays. 2006; 28: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For its activation, Cdk5 is dependent upon association with one of the two regulatory subunits, p35 or p39 (32Ko J. Humbert S. Bronson R.T. Takahashi S. Kulkarni A.B. Li E. Tsai L.H. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6758-6771Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Tang D. Wang J.H. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1996; 2: 205-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). PKC, which is part of the diacylglycerol second messenger pathway, is a kinase that exists in many isoforms, of which several have an established regulatory role in distinct physiological steps of the exocytotic process (34Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. Barclay J.W. Craig T.J. Prescott G.R. Ciufo L.F. Evans G.J. Graham M.E. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 1341-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that endocrine β-cells share the same core exocytotic machinery as highly specialized neuronal synapses, regulated insulin secretion may require additional versatility. Primary β-cells have, in addition to the fastest phase of regulated exocytosis, slower phases of insulin secretion displaying different kinetics compared with the initial stimulated release (35Henquin J.C. Diabetologia. 2009; 52: 739-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 36Jewell J.L. Oh E. Thurmond D.C. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2010; 298: R517-R531Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In addition to maintaining a normal basal insulin secretion, the triggering threshold for stimulated insulin exocytosis and the magnitude of released hormone from β-cells need to be precisely tailored to different physiological conditions. To explore if the essential key regulator in synaptic transmission, Munc18-1, but also the closely related Munc18-2 protein contribute to the adaptability of insulin exocytosis from β-cells, we characterized their presence, abundance, and intracellular compartmentalization as well as their influence on Ca2+ sensitivity of the fastest phase of insulin secretion. We could demonstrate that both Munc18-1 and Munc18-2 affect insulin secretion, and depending on their phosphorylation status, they display distinct subcellular localization and control of Ca2+ sensitivity of exocytosis. We now suggest that in β-cells the fine-tuning of Ca2+ sensitivity of the exocytotic machinery partly relies on the presence of different Munc18 variants and their phosphorylation status, and these variations contribute to the versatility of regulated insulin release.DISCUSSIONThe pancreatic β-cell, in which the main function is to produce and secrete insulin, is a classic example of an endocrine cell. Nevertheless, β-cells express the full repertoire of SNARE and SNARE-regulating proteins found in neuronal cells, including the neuronal Munc18-1 protein. In addition, β-cells also express exocytotic proteins previously implicated in only non-neuronal exocytosis; for example, Munc18-2. We hypothesize that the presence of operators for several secretory pathways in β-cells might be one of the underlying reasons why this cell manages multiple phases of insulin secretion and demonstrates such a diversity and adaptability of the secretory response. This is an attribute important for the β-cell ability to tightly control glucose homeostasis in the body.We first characterized the expression and abundance of endogenous Munc18 mRNAs and their corresponding syntaxin partners in islets, brain, and the insulinoma cell line MIN6. The results showed that the relative level of Munc18-2 was surprisingly high in islets from ob/ob mice, which on average contain 90–95% β-cells. The matching syntaxin isoforms 1 and 3 were also expressed.Sec1/Munc18 proteins, originally identified as essential for membrane trafficking and secretion in yeast, are highly conserved among organisms. Null mutations of Munc18 homologue genes in a variety of species resulted in disruption or disturbances in regulated membrane fusion and/or specific intracellular trafficking pathways (42Toonen R.F. Verhage M. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 177-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 43Novick P. Field C. Schekman R. Cell. 1980; 21: 205-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). Particularly remarkable was the finding that targeted disruption of the mouse Munc18-1 gene produced a mutant that died shortly after birth (6Verhage M. Maia A.S. Plomp J.J. Brussaard A.B. Heeroma J.H. Vermeer H. Toonen R.F. Hammer R.E. van den Berg T.K. Missler M. Geuze H.J. Südhof T.C. Science. 2000; 287: 864-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). Even though brain development appeared normal, embryos from these mouse mutants were paralyzed due to the complete absence of both spontaneous and evoked synaptic transmission (6Verhage M. Maia A.S. Plomp J.J. Brussaard A.B. Heeroma J.H. Vermeer H. Toonen R.F. Hammer R.E. van den Berg T.K. Missler M. Geuze H.J. Südhof T.C.

Neurosci. 2004; 19: 2944-2952Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). However, analyses in neuroendocrine chromaffin cells from Munc18-1 null embryos demonstrated a small but significant evoked secretion of catecholamines (45Voets T. Toonen R.F. Brian E.C. de Wit H. Moser T. Rettig J. Südhof T.C. Neher E. Verhage M. Neuron. 2001; 31: 581-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). This could indicate that some excitable cells possess both a Munc18-1-dependent secretory pathway and a yet redundant bypass route, allowing regulated exocytosis to occur in a Munc18-1-independent way.Despite being the subject of intense studies, the precise regulatory roles and the sites of action of the Munc18-1 protein are not entirely elucidated. Several studies of Munc18-1 function in different organisms have demonstrated both negative and positive roles in regulated exocytosis (10Burgoyne R.D. Barclay J.W. Ciufo L.F. Graham M.E. Handley M.T. Morgan A. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2009; 1152: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For example, in β-cells, the Munc18-1 protein has been proposed to have both inhibitory and positive effects on insulin release (14Zhang W. Efanov A. Yang S.N. Fried G. Kolare S. Brown H. Zaitsev S. Berggren P.O. Meister B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41521-41527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 15Dong Y. Wan Q. Yang X. Bai L. Xu P. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 2004; 279: 29534-29541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Inconsistency in these results in β-cells could of course be a consequence of different experimental techniques measuring different phases of the insulin secretory cascade and thereby emphasizing different roles of the Munc18-1 protein. An additional possibility is that in some Munc18-1-expressing cells there also exists Munc18-1-independent secretory pathways. Besides binding monomeric syntaxin 1 in the closed conformation, recent findings show that Munc18-1 is capable of binding to the N-terminal part of syntaxin 1 in the open configuration (46Rickman C. Medine C.N. Bergmann A. Duncan R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12097-12103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This direct interaction of Munc18-1 with the assembled SNARE complex promotes fusion and fusion pore kinetics (47Dulubova I. Khvotchev M. Liu S. Huryeva I. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 2697-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). This positive effect contradicts the traditional theory of Munc18-1 playing an inhibitory role in secretion (46Rickman C. Medine C.N. Bergmann A. Duncan R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12097-12103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 47Dulubova I. Khvotchev M. Liu S. Huryeva I. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 2697-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). However, the negative effect on secretion is believed to be mediated through the formation of a high affinity syntaxin-1/Munc18-1 interaction, likely during vesicle docking, and thus preventing syntaxin-1 to assembly into the trimeric SNARE complex (46Rickman C. Medine C.N. Bergmann A. Duncan R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12097-12103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 47Dulubova I. Khvotchev M. Liu S. Huryeva I. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 2697-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Transitions between the different binding modes of Munc18-1 are believed to be regulated by dynamic phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, and thereby kinase activity also partly contributes to the function ambiguity (48Toonen R.F. Verhage M. Trends Neurosci. 2007; 30: 564-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar).Munc18-1 and Munc18-2 can both bind the two target SNAREs syntaxin 1 and 3, which show 64% identity in amino acid structure and share conserved protein domains. Interestingly, in HIT-T15 cells the plasma membrane protein syntaxin 3 has also been detected in the cytoplasm, functioning both as a modulator of insulin secretion and of Ca2+ channel activity (49Kang Y. Huang X. Pasyk E.A. Ji J. Holz G.G. Wheeler M.B. Tsushima R.G. Gaisano H.Y. Diabetologia. 2002; 45: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Munc18-2 has mostly been studied in epithelial tissues, where it controls apical regulated exocytosis, and in pancreatic acini, where it has been demonstrated to control Slp4a/granuphilin-syntaxin interactions and amylase secretion (17Lam P.P. Hyvärinen K. Kauppi M. Cosen-Binker L. Laitinen S. Keränen S. Gaisano H.Y. Olkkonen V.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2473-2480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Fukuda M. Imai A. Nashida T.

Coexpression of Munc18-1 and Munc18-2 has been confirmed in β-cells, somatotrophs in the anterior pituitary, mast cells, and PC12 cells (18Zhang Y. Kang Y.H. Chang N. Lam P.P. Liu Y. Olkkonen V.M.

Cell. 2009; 20: 4962-4975Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).Phosphorylation of exocytotic proteins plays an important role in membrane trafficking and regulated secretion. We have previously shown that Munc18-1 is expressed in pancreatic β-cells and, together with Cdk5/p39, acts as a positive regulator of induced insulin exocytosis (29Lilja L. Johansson J.U. Gromada J. Mandic S.A. Fried G. Berggren P.O. Bark C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29534-29541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The Cdk5 protein demonstrated a subcellular translocation from membrane-bound to cytosolic fractions when β-cells were stimulated by glucose (30Lilja L. Yang S.N. Webb D.L. Juntti-Berggren L. Berggren P.O. Bark C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34199-34205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To investigate if WT or phosphorylation mutants of the Munc18 proteins changed localization as a response to cellular stimulation, we used transiently transfected MIN6 cells. Importantly, these experiments were performed using epitope-tagged Munc18 constructs, as Munc18 antibodies usually show a high degree of cross-reactivity between the different Munc18 isoforms. We observed a translocation of the Munc18-1 WT protein to plasma membrane fractions during glucose stimulation of β-cells, consistent with recent findings by Halban and co-workers (11Tomas A. Meda P. Regazzi R. Pessin J.E. Halban P.A. Traffic. 2008; 9: 813-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the absence of functional Cdk5 or PKC phosphorylation sites sequestered the Munc18-1 protein at the plasma membrane already under unstimulatory conditions, and these mutants remained membrane-bound also after stimulation. Obviously, both Cdk5 and PKC activity are required for the correct cycling of the Munc18-1 protein between the cytosolic- and membrane-bound state in β-cells. On the other hand, both Munc18-2 WT and its Cdk5 phosphorylation mutant remained cytosolic both in unstimulated and glucose-stimulated β-cells. Despite the difference in subcellular localization, both Munc18-1 and Munc18-2 were able to augment glucose-stimulated secretion. The increase in released hormone was modest but reproducible. It is possible to trigger additional signaling pathways and further enhance released hGH by adding a mixture of secretagogues (see for example Ref. 11Tomas A. Meda P. Regazzi R. Pessin J.E. Halban P.A. Traffic. 2008; 9: 813-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), but we chose to look on only glucose-dependent secretion. In light of our findings it is of interest to compare with studies made in another cell type, namely the pituitary somatotrophs, where co-existence of Munc18-1 and Munc18-2 has also been observed (52Korteweg N. Maia A.S. Thompson B. Roubos E.W. Burbach J.P. Verhage M. Biol. Cell. 2005; 97: 445-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Anterior pituitary cells from Munc18-1 null mutants did not exhibit a complete absence of stimulated peptide secretion from large dense core vesicles. However, the large dense core vesicles appeared to reside at a larger distance from the membrane in mutants compared with WT cells when Munc18-1 was absent (52Korteweg N. Maia A.S. Thompson B. Roubos E.W. Burbach J.P. Verhage M. Biol. Cell. 2005; 97: 445-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).The Munc18-1 protein is involved in both early steps of the exocytotic cascade and in the events close to the actual membrane fusion. We investigated the fastest phase of regulated exocytosis by using the high resolution slow photorelease of caged Ca2+ and carefully evaluated the effects of Munc18 WT and phosphorylation mutated templates on the rate and amplitude of the first seconds of Ca2+-triggered release in pancreatic β-cells. When Munc18-1 was overexpressed in β-cells, a higher [Ca2+]i than in control cells was required to trigger secretion of release-competent vesicles. This may be explained by the fact that Munc18-1 together with syntaxin-1 forms a stable protein complex engaged in secretory granule docking, and higher intracellular Ca2+ levels are required for augmenting Munc18-1 transition and vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. On the other hand, Munc18-2 overexpression shifted the Ca2+ sensitivity so that fusion of granules was also initiated at lower Ca2+ concentrations. This suggests that the different Munc18 proteins may support different granule populations that release their content at different [Ca2+]i. Indeed, the fastest phase of exocytosis could be divided further in two components demonstrating different fusion kinetics, rate1 and rate2, and with different amplitudes, amp1 and amp2. Both coexpression of Munc18-1 and Munc18-2 and single introduction of Munc18-2 further supported this by significantly increasing the number of releasable granules (amp2) exocytosed during the second secretory phase. This suggests that Munc18-2, in addition to assisting the release of the fastest phase of secretion (amp1), likely is important for refilling the granule pool released during amp2. Partial silencing of the Munc18-1 WT protein or the Munc18-2 protein (reduced to ∼10–15%), quantified by Western blot, had no significant effect on the fastest phase of the exocytotic response. This suggests that the remaining endogenous protein is still sufficient to manage this phase of secretion. However, one should bear in mind that Munc18 is a regulatory protein involved in many steps preceding the fastest phase of regulated vesicle fusion, and a partial down-regulation of the expression level may not be the rate-limiting factor for the secretory step studied in our experimental set up. Munc18-1 Cdk5 phosphorylation mutant or Munc18-1 WT in combination with p35 lowered the Ca2+ sensitivity, i.e. increased the Ca2+ “threshold” for triggering of fusion. The non-phosphorylated form of the Munc18-1 protein is, similar to the WT template, still capable of stably docking the granules, which is followed by the shift to higher Ca2+ sensitivity, but the absence of Cdk5 phosphorylation leads to a negative effect on the rate and amplitude of exocytosis. On the other hand, adding p39 with Munc18-1 WT restored the Ca2+ sensitivity to the control levels compared with single overexpression of Munc18-1 WT, thus apparently increasing the release probability of this vesicle pool. This is similar to our earlier findings where Cdk5/p39 facilitated stimulated"
https://openalex.org/W2080909121,"The 13th century BC witnessed the zenith of the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean civilizations which declined at the end of the Bronze Age, ∼3200 years ago. Weakening of this ancient flourishing Mediterranean world shifted the political and economic centres of gravity away from the Levant towards Classical Greece and Rome, and led, in the long term, to the emergence of the modern western civilizations. Textual evidence from cuneiform tablets and Egyptian reliefs from the New Kingdom relate that seafaring tribes, the Sea Peoples, were the final catalyst that put the fall of cities and states in motion. However, the lack of a stratified radiocarbon-based archaeology for the Sea People event has led to a floating historical chronology derived from a variety of sources spanning dispersed areas. Here, we report a stratified radiocarbon-based archaeology with anchor points in ancient epigraphic-literary sources, Hittite-Levantine-Egyptian kings and astronomical observations to precisely date the Sea People event. By confronting historical and science-based archaeology, we establish an absolute age range of 1192–1190 BC for terminal destructions and cultural collapse in the northern Levant. This radiocarbon-based archaeology has far-reaching implications for the wider Mediterranean, where an elaborate network of international relations and commercial activities are intertwined with the history of civilizations."

By enabling neuronal population imaging with subcellular resolution, this modality offers an approach for gaining a fundamental understanding of brain anatomy and physiology. Proper analysis of calcium imaging data requires denoising, that is separating the signal from complex physiological noise. To analyze two-photon brain imaging data, we present a signal plus colored noise model in which the signal is represented as harmonic regression and the correlated noise is represented as an order autoregressive process. We provide an efficient cyclic descent algorithm to compute approximate maximum likelihood parameter estimates by combing a weighted least-squares procedure with the Burg algorithm. We use Akaike information criterion to guide selection of the harmonic regression and the autoregressive model orders. Our flexible yet parsimonious modeling approach reliably separates stimulus-evoked fluorescence response from background activity and noise, assesses goodness of fit, and estimates confidence intervals and signal-to-noise ratio. This refined separation leads to appreciably enhanced image contrast for individual cells including clear delineation of subcellular details and network activity. The application of our approach to in vivo imaging data recorded in the ferret primary visual cortex demonstrates that our method yields substantially denoised signal estimates. We also provide a general Volterra series framework for deriving this and other signal plus correlated noise models for imaging. This approach to analyzing two-photon calcium imaging data may be readily adapted to other computational biology problems which apply correlated noise models."
https://openalex.org/W2034975847,"Neuropeptide signaling plays roles in coordinating cellular activities and maintaining robust oscillations within the mammalian suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Prokineticin2 (PK2) is a signaling molecule from the SCN and involves in the generation of circadian locomotor activity. Prokineticin receptor 2 (PKR2), a receptor for PK2, has been shown to be expressed in the SCN. However, very little is known about the cellular action of PK2 within the SCN. In the present study, we investigated the effect of PK2 on spontaneous firing and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) using whole cell patch-clamp recording in the SCN slices. PK2 dose-dependently increased spontaneous firing rates in most neurons from the dorsal SCN. PK2 acted postsynaptically to reduce γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic function within the SCN, and PK2 reduced the amplitude but not frequency of mIPSCs. Furthermore, PK2 also suppressed exogenous GABA-induced currents. And the inhibitory effect of PK2 required PKC activation in the postsynaptic cells. Our data suggest that PK2 could alter cellular activities within the SCN and may influence behavioral and physiological rhythms."

However, some aversive concentrations appear to act as positive reinforcers, increasing attraction to an odour with which they have been paired. We test whether this surprising dissociation between the unconditioned and conditioned response depends on the larvae's experience of salt concentration in their food. We find that although the point at which a NaCl concentration becomes aversive shifts with different rearing experience, the dissociation remains evident. Testing larvae using a substrate 0.025M above the NaCl concentration on which the larvae were reared consistently results in aversive choice behaviour but appetitive reinforcement effects."

This reaction led to the formation of the dioxygen adduct of IDO and supported the oxidation of Trp to N-formylkynurenine. Formation of the dioxygen adduct and oxidation of Trp were accelerated by the addition of small amounts of hydrogen peroxide, and both processes were inhibited in the presence of either superoxide dismutase or catalase. Anaerobic reaction of IDO with NADH proceeded only in the presence of a mediator (e.g. methylene blue) and resulted in formation of the ferrous form of the enzyme. We propose that trace amounts of peroxide previously proposed to occur in NADH solutions as well as solid NADH activate IDO and lead to aerobic formation of superoxide and the reactive dioxygen adduct of the enzyme.

https://openalex.org/W2002443278,"Background Pre-pandemic development of an inactivated, split-virion avian influenza vaccine is challenged by the lack of pre-existing immunity and the reduced immunogenicity of some H5 hemagglutinins compared to that of seasonal influenza vaccines. Identification of an acceptable effective adjuvant is needed to improve immunogenicity of a split-virion avian influenza vaccine. Methods and Findings Ferrets (N = 118) were vaccinated twice with a split-virion vaccine preparation of A/Vietnam/1203/2004 or saline either 21 days apart (unadjuvanted: 1.9 µg, 7.5 µg, 30 µg, or saline), or 28 days apart (unadjuvanted: 22.5 µg, or alum-adjuvanted: 22.5 or 7.5 µg). Vaccinated animals were challenged intranasally 21 or 28 days later with 106 EID50 of the homologous strain. Immunogenicity was measured by hemagglutination inhibition and neutralization assays. Morbidity was assessed by observed behavior, weight loss, temperature, cytopenias, histopathology, and viral load. No serum antibodies were detected after vaccination with unadjuvanted vaccine, whereas alum-adjuvanted vaccination induced a robust antibody response. Survival after unadjuvanted dose regimens of 30 µg, 7.5 µg and 1.9 µg (21-day intervals) was 64%, 43%, and 43%, respectively, yet survivors experienced weight loss, fever and thrombocytopenia. Survival after unadjuvanted dose regimen of 22.5 µg (28-day intervals) was 0%, suggesting important differences in intervals in this model. In contrast to unadjuvanted survivors, either dose of alum-adjuvanted vaccine resulted in 93% survival with minimal morbidity and without fever or weight loss. The rarity of brain inflammation in alum-adjuvanted survivors, compared to high levels in unadjuvanted vaccine survivors, suggested that improved protection associated with the alum adjuvant was due to markedly reduced early viral invasion of the ferret brain. Conclusion Alum adjuvant significantly improves efficacy of an H5N1 split-virion vaccine in the ferret model as measured by immunogenicity, mortality, morbidity, and brain invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2085691755,"Surface layers (S-layers) represent an almost universal feature of archaeal cell envelopes and are probably the most abundant bacterial cell proteins. S-layers are monomolecular crystalline structures of single protein or glycoprotein monomers that completely cover the cell surface during all stages of the cell growth cycle, thereby performing their intrinsic function under a constant intra- and intermolecular mechanical stress. In gram-positive bacteria, the individual S-layer proteins are anchored by a specific binding mechanism to polysaccharides (secondary cell wall polymers) that are linked to the underlying peptidoglycan layer. In this work, atomic force microscopy-based single-molecule force spectroscopy and a polyprotein approach are used to study the individual mechanical unfolding pathways of an S-layer protein. We uncover complex unfolding pathways involving the consecutive unfolding of structural intermediates, where a mechanical stability of 87 pN is revealed. Different initial extensibilities allow the hypothesis that S-layer proteins adapt highly stable, mechanically resilient conformations that are not extensible under the presence of a pulling force. Interestingly, a change of the unfolding pathway is observed when individual S-layer proteins interact with secondary cell wall polymers, which is a direct signature of a conformational change induced by the ligand. Moreover, the mechanical stability increases up to 110 pN. This work demonstrates that single-molecule force spectroscopy offers a powerful tool to detect subtle changes in the structure of an individual protein upon binding of a ligand and constitutes the first conformational study of surface layer proteins at the single-molecule level."
https://openalex.org/W2055646210,"Electrical Impedance measurements can be used to estimate the content of intra-thoracic air and thereby give information on pulmonary ventilation. Conventional Impedance measurements mainly indicate relative changes, but no information concerning air-volume is given. The study was performed to test whether a 3-point-calibration with known tidal volumes (VT) during conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) allows subsequent calculation of VT from total Tidal-Impedance (tTI) measurements using Quadrant Impedance Measurement (QIM). In addition the distribution of TI in different regions of the thorax was examined.QIM was performed in five neonatal piglets during volume-controlled CMV. tTI values at three different VT (4, 6, 8 ml/kg) were used to establish individual calibration curves. Subsequently, each animal was ventilated with different patterns of varying VT (2-10 ml/kg) at different PEEP levels (0, 3, 6, 9, 12 cmH(2)O). VT variation was repeated after surfactant depletion by bronchoalveolar lavage. VT was calculated from tTI values (VT(calc)) and compared to the VT delivered by the ventilator (VT(PNT)). Bland-Altman analysis revealed good agreement between VT(calc) and VT(PNT) before (bias -0.08 ml; limits of agreement -1.18 to 1.02 ml at PEEP = 3 cmH(2)O) and after surfactant depletion (bias -0.17 ml; limits of agreement -1.57 to 1.22 ml at PEEP = 3 cmH(2)O). At higher PEEP levels VT(calc) was lower than VT(PNT), when only one fixed calibration curve (at PEEP 3 cmH(2)O) was used. With a new calibration curve at each PEEP level the method showed similar accuracy at each PEEP level. TI showed a homogeneous distribution over the four assessed quadrants with a shift toward caudal regions of the thorax with increasing VT.Tidal Impedance values could be used for precise and accurate calculation of VT during CMV in this animal study, when calibrated at each PEEP level."
https://openalex.org/W1970596394,"Previously, challenges faced by women scientists have made it difficult for them to realize their dreams. The remarkable growth of Asian bioscience over the past decade, however, has created opportunities for young women in their home countries. The time is ripe for women in Asia to pursue their scientific aspirations. Previously, challenges faced by women scientists have made it difficult for them to realize their dreams. The remarkable growth of Asian bioscience over the past decade, however, has created opportunities for young women in their home countries. The time is ripe for women in Asia to pursue their scientific aspirations. The year 2011 marks 100 years since Marie Curie, one of the most notable scientists of the 20th century, was awarded her second Nobel Prize. In an era when it was still unthinkable for a woman to have a career, let alone one as a scientist, Dr. Curie faced—and overcame—insurmountable odds in her quest for knowledge. Dr. Curie was one of many pioneers whose courage, tenacity, and groundbreaking achievements spurred generations of young women to follow in her inspiring footsteps, and today, the notion that women do not belong in the sciences is as antiquated as corsets and foot binding. Women across the globe have come a long way since the days of Dr. Curie, and more are opting to pursue careers in the life sciences. In Asia, changing mindsets and the recent growth in the bioscience sector has also enhanced career prospects in recent years. For instance, a decade or more ago, educational and career opportunities in the biosciences in this region were few and far between. Hence, it was not unusual for a young woman with a keen interest in the life sciences to head west to the US or Europe for education and training, as that was where pioneering research and exciting new advancements and breakthroughs were occurring. These were also the countries where women were less likely to face gender-related barriers or obstacles due to traditional cultural norms. On most occasions, after undergoing undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral training, young scientists would choose to remain in these countries to pursue careers in academia or industry since that is where the opportunities were. However, in the past decade, life science development in Asia has grown by leaps and bounds as countries in the region have placed a strong emphasis on establishing and developing their own home-grown industries. Research innovations, capabilities, output, and advances within the region are now on par with Western Europe and the US. While some of these are a result of government policies that aim to develop an environment of biomedical innovation and creativity, and a knowledge-based society, others are fueled by the private sector through strategic collaborations between research institutes and biopharmaceutical companies. For example, in China, the government has identified development of science and technology as one of the major goals of its national development strategy. Thus, through the country's “12th Five-Year Plan,” the government aims to increase the R&D funding from 1.8% of GDP in 2010 to 2.2% in 2015 (Gov.cn, 2011Gov.cn. (2011). China on ‘National Twelfth Five-Year Plan.’ http://www.gov.cn/2011lh/content_1825838.htm.Google Scholar). In addition, leading pharmaceutical companies such as GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer, Novartis, Bayer, Eli Lilly, and Hoffman-La Roche have set up their R&D centers in China (Wikipedia, 2011Wikipedia. (2011). R&D centers in China. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_industry_in_the_People's_Republic_of_China.Google Scholar). Regardless, these initiatives are opening up educational, training, and career opportunities in the region in areas such as basic and translational research, drug discovery, clinical research and development, regulatory affairs, biopharmaceutical manufacturing, and marketing and sales. Furthermore, a lot of the work is focused on areas at the forefront of bioscience. These developments have spurred many overseas-based Asian scientists to return to their “homelands” to take advantage of these opportunities, and utilize their expertise and experiences to help the development of local industries as well as train and serve as mentors to young scientists. In fact, China launched the Thousand-Talent Scheme in 2009 as a means of attracting Chinese scientists and industry professionals working in other countries to return to their homeland. Thus, there are considerable opportunities and avenues for young women eager to pursue a career in science. It is evident that career development is highly dependent on the opportunities available. As the recent initiatives in bioscience development are country specific, there are naturally different opportunities available across the region. Furthermore, gender inequality continues to persist in some countries more than others, such that women in one country may find it harder to progress in her career than her peers in another country. Gender disparity is not unique to Asia. Global statistics indicate that gender inequality is still present, particularly at the higher echelons of academia and industry, in most developed countries. In fact, gender disparity in the sciences has been the subject of debate for many years. As highlighted in the report commissioned by the InterAcademy Council, numerous studies have been conducted to identify the causes and many countries have developed initiatives, in the form of committees, commissions, and proposals, to tackle this problem (InterAcademy Council, 2004InterAcademy Council. (2004). Women for Science: An Advisory Report InterAcademy Council. http://www.interacademycouncil.net/CMS/Reports/Women4Science.aspx.Google Scholar). While efforts are being made to increase the participation of women in science at all levels, from recruiting more female graduate students to the appointment of women as senior research fellows and other high-level positions, the number of women in senior level positions is still very low. The key issue is determining whether women are intentionally held back from excelling by external factors or whether they hold themselves back. For each, different sets of initiatives have to be implemented. In Asia, gender disparity can be attributed to cultural factors and societal pressures related to the traditional roles women play in society. Therefore, in patriarchic societies such as South Korea and Japan, women are heavily under-represented in upper levels of academia and industry. In Japan, women make up only 12.4% of scientists in academia and even today, continue to be marginalized and passed over for senior positions due to their gender (Nature, 2008NatureOne woman is still not enough.Nature. 2008; 451: 865Google Scholar). Similarly, the population of female researchers in Korea is 17.4% (in 2008) and only 10.4% of these were in faculty positions (MEST, 2009MEST. (2009). Report on Women in Science and Technology 2009. http://www.mest.go.kr/web/1013/ko/board/download.do?boardSeq=41136.Google Scholar). In China, a society which has always encouraged women to participate in the workplace, gender inequality also persists in the sciences. For example, in the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), the prestigious and leading academic institution in China, a disparity is seen between the number of male and female Academicians, with ∼6% female representation (CAS, 2011CAS. (2011). Percentage of female CAS members. http://www.casad.cas.cn/ysxx/xbfbt/.Google Scholar). However, as an ever increasing number of Chinese women pursue careers in science and technology, China is contributing the major share of women scientists in Asia. For example, in 2008, 14 million women (∼40% of the total) were working in science and technology fields, while ∼46% of the total graduate students are female (Chen, 2010Chen, Z.-L. (2010). Chinese Women and China's Science & Technology. http://www.womenofchina.cn/html/node/108780-1.htm.Google Scholar). Various reasons have been identified to account for the relatively low female representation, particularly in the upper echelons of science. Studies have shown that gender inequality is not apparent at the undergraduate and postgraduate level. However, the disparity is evident beyond that level. Hence, young women choose to study science, but they do not choose to pursue careers in science. In fact, in the past hundred years, 15 women have won the Nobel Prize in science, 3 of which were in 2009 (The Nobel Prize Internet Archive, 2011The Nobel Prize Internet Archive. (2011). Female Nobel Prize Laureates. http://nobelprizes.com/nobel/women.html.Google Scholar). There are several explanations for this. Women may lack confidence and motivation due to perceived barriers to entry-level faculty positions, discriminatory hiring practices, perceptions of the challenges women faculty members face, and a lack of role models and mentors in the field. Many women also put their career aspirations on hold or give them up altogether when they reach the period of their lives where they want to start a family, based on the idea that family-work commitments will impact their careers and place them at a disadvantage in academia. In fact, many young women in science opt out of a competitive academic career path in order to spend more time with their families. In Asia, the problem has been more acute due to the fact that there have been few training opportunities available locally. Until recently, most aspiring scientists had to leave their home countries for the US or Europe for further training and to pursue a credible career in science. As many Asian societies are patriarchic, this would be difficult, requiring mutual family consensus. Furthermore, in Asian families, women are expected to shoulder more of the responsibilities of taking care of the family, so unless they have family support, it is very difficult for them to invest the time and dedication required for the demands of a career in the sciences. Thus, the gender disparity has stemmed from insufficient role models and the relative lack of support for women who strive for a career and a family. Recent societal changes in Asia aim to improve the situation, though. In countries such as China and Singapore, there is greater shared responsibility within the family structure, allowing women the freedom to pursue a career they desire. Policy implementation may also make a difference. The report commissioned by the InterAcademy Council has identified the following strategies to increase the number of women in science. Greater commitment from the top levels of the organization, establishment of an infrastructure such as a diversity committee, reviewing policies and procedures to ensure there are no differential impact on men and women, transparency in all communication, recruitment, promotion and awards, widening the inner circle, leadership training and mentoring, supporting a healthy work-family balance, and regular collecting of sex-disaggregated data and monitoring of progress (InterAcademy Council, 2004InterAcademy Council. (2004). Women for Science: An Advisory Report InterAcademy Council. http://www.interacademycouncil.net/CMS/Reports/Women4Science.aspx.Google Scholar). However, it is up to the individual institutions to implement these strategies. Thus, to promote gender parity, many universities now provide maternity pay and child care facilities, and equal opportunities are enshrined in law. Furthermore, many schemes have been developed both on a global scale as well as locally. One well-known global initiative is the L'Oréal-UNESCO Awards (L'Oréal-UNESCO, 2011L'Oréal-UNESCO. (2011). UNESCO-L'Oréal international fellowships. http://www.loreal.com/_en/_ww/index.aspx?direct1=00008&direct2=00008/00001.Google Scholar). Jointly established by L'Oréal Corporate Foundation and UNESCO, over the past 13 years under the umbrella of “For Women in Science,” the awards aim to promote women researchers who have made outstanding contributions to their field of work. Each year, five women scientists are presented with the L'Oréal-UNESCO For Women in Science Award, one from each of the following continents: Africa and Arab states, Asia, Europe, North America, and Latin America. Furthermore, 15 women postdoctoral researchers, 3 from each region, are awarded the UNESCO- L'Oréal International Fellowships for Women in Science. Since its establishment, 67 women have been presented with the prestigious L'Oréal-UNESCO award, two of whom received the Nobel Prize in 2009, while 864 fellowships have been awarded to young women scientists from 93 countries. Individual countries, especially those with poor gender parity, are also implementing strategies to promote better work-life balance for women in an effort to encourage women to pursue careers in academic research. In Japan, for example, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) has established programs that aim to encourage female researchers to return to work after having a child. These include regulations to protect women scientists from losing their grants while on extended maternity leave, as well as offering competitive grants to women returning to science after giving birth (OECD, 2006OECD. (2006). Women in Scientific Careers: Unleashing the Potential. ISBN 92-64-02537-5.Google Scholar). Korea has also implemented several strategies to encourage female participation in the sciences. The country's Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MEST) along with the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) established the “Women Scientists of the Year” award in 2001. Comprised of a commendation from the Education, Science and Technology Minister and KRW 10 million in prize money, the award is presented annually to one female scientist and one female engineer making outstanding contributions to scientific development (MEST, 2011MEST. (2011). Strategies encourage participation of women scientists in Korea. http://english.mest.go.kr/web/42208/en/board/enlist.do?bbsId=265&currentPage=4.Google Scholar). Other organizations have also established similar award schemes. For example, the Korean Federation of Women's Science & Technology Associations (KOFWST) a body overseeing the country's women's science and technology organizations, along with AMOREPACIFIC, has established the “AMOREPACIFIC Award for Outstanding Women in the Sciences” to promote the scientific contributions and achievements of women scientists so as to encourage future women scientists (KOFWST, 2011KOFWST. (2011). AMOREPACIFIC: Award for outstanding women in the sciences. http://www.kofwst.org/amore_eng/sub1.php#2.Google Scholar). Similarly, among the many initiatives in China includes the China Young Women Scientists' Award, jointly established by the All-China Women's Federation, the China Association for Science and Technology, the Chinese National Commission for UNESCO, and L'Oreal (China) Ltd. The purpose of the award is to honor young women who have made important and innovative achievements in science and to encourage more women scientists to engage in natural science research (Baicheng, 2005Baicheng, J. (2005). Award set up to honour female scientists. http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-07/22/content_350421.htm.Google Scholar). The CAS has also identified increasing women representation in science as an important priority. The organization hosted the Third World Organization for Women in Science (TWOWS) 4th General Assembly and International Conference in Beijing in 2010, a forum to address gender disparity in the developing world and promote initiatives to support and encourage the full participation of women in science and technology (CAS, 2009CAS. (2009). http://www.cas.cn/xw/zyxw/ttxw/200912/t20091214_2707746.shtml.Google Scholar). Additional progress toward overall gender equality in the country can be seen by the recent announcement by the Chinese Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security on its review of the retirement age of women in China. Under the current regulations, regular female workers retire at the age of 50 and female public servants retire at 55, while the retirement age for men is 60 (China.org.cn, 2011China.org.cn. (2011). China to review women's retirement age. http://www.china.org.cn/china/2011-02/28/content_22015246.htm.Google Scholar). Overall, all of these various schemes bring visibility to women scientists and by promoting their achievements on the world stage, highlight the role of women in scientific excellence. Furthermore, they encourage and inspire young women and give them the confidence to follow their dreams and aspirations. While it is essential to implement sound policies to support young women in their careers, women must also have the right attitude, be persistent, and be prepared to pursue their dreams with focused enthusiasm and drive. Success, I believe, firmly goes hand-in-hand with attributes such as creativity, aptitude, determination, and most importantly, passion. In fact, these are the qualities that have been the motivating force for me when striving for the seemingly unattainable or when faced with insurmountable obstacles. Young women should not be disillusioned by the issue of gender disparity. While gender disparity will not be eliminated overnight, as long as women are aware of its existence and the various support mechanisms that are available to them to support their upward career mobility, they can still excel. Young women should also proactively seek out mentors during the early stage of their scientific careers. In fact, an area close to my heart is mentoring and encouraging women who are enthusiastic toward the advancement of scientific knowledge. Mentors provide support and encouragement, as well as invaluable guidance on research and career paths. They can also help dissipate unfounded fears. Young women should also be encouraged to join professional women's organizations in science and technology as they provide invaluable support as well as host forums on essential career-related topics. On the whole, young women must not hesitate to seek out assistance, if need be. My personal journey has been exhilarating and inspiring, filled with discoveries and disappointments, and a road compounded by both enormous challenges and a great sense of satisfaction. The strong sense of curiosity and the pure joy of learning and discovery has been the driving force that sparked my lifelong scientific career. Even while undergoing the rigorous training that is part of becoming a scientist, I was continuously inspired by potential new discoveries. With the encouragement of outstanding mentors, from my high school biology teacher to distinguished scientists, I was provided with equal opportunities and a supportive environment to build my career. Furthermore, I strived to identify with good role models in my field of interest. A major role model was Dr. Rita Levi-Montalcini, an eminent neuroscientist and currently the oldest living Nobel laureate. Dr. Levi-Montalcini, a legend in her own right, excelled in the face of insurmountable odds. She pursued her dreams despite the objections of her father, who believed that a science career would affect her duties of a wife and mother. During the early stage of her career, with no funding and under the circumstances of war, she continued to undertake outstanding research from a home laboratory to study the growth of nerve fibers in chicken embryos. These studies laid the groundwork for her future work that shaped the understanding of neurogenesis. Later in her career, she chose to make tremendous contributions to the development of neuroscience in her home country of Italy. I was thus inspired to always pursue scientific excellence and also to promote neuroscience and life science in Hong Kong. After receiving my PhD and postdoctoral training at Harvard Medical School, I worked in industry, first as Laboratory Head at Lifecodes Corporation and then as Senior Staff Scientist at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, both biopharmaceutical companies based in the US. However, in 1993, I decided to return to Hong Kong with my family, and in spite of not having any university administrative or teaching experience, I jumped at the opportunity to join the then newly established Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). Along with my colleagues, I enthusiastically embraced the challenge to help shape the life science programs at the university. During this period, science development was at its initial phase in Hong Kong; there were few commercial ventures and the biopharmaceutical industry was very much in its infancy. Therefore, in addition to developing the life science programs within the university, it was also our goal to lay the foundations for developing advanced neuroscience research, and in time, the capabilities to undertake drug discovery as well. Thus, a vision was born. At HKUST, I decided to continue my work on trophic factors as well as neuronal development and synaptic plasticity, areas of interest that were sparked during the early stages of my career in the US. However, the research environment was quite different from the US, and creative strategies had to be established. With dedication and determination, my research flourished and I rose through the ranks within the university. An important factor in this success was networking with previous mentors, peers, and other scientists in the field. As I worked to build my research portfolio and credibility, I also strived to turn my vision of developing a neuroscience hub in Hong Kong into a reality. For example, under my helm as Director of the Biotechnology Research Institute at the University, we established a multifaceted state-of-the-art drug discovery technology platform to drive local biomedical research toward a higher standard of excellence. Numerous prominent academic and industrial collaborations were also established to enhance the scope and quality of our research and strengthen the credibility of our work. With the invaluable contributions and support of committed colleagues and team members, I then spearheaded the establishment of the Molecular Neuroscience Center, with the mission to consolidate expertise and research initiatives in molecular neuroscience, and based on this strong foundation, our project on molecular neuroscience was selected as an Area of Excellence. This was an enormous achievement, as it allowed us to undertake exciting new initiatives in molecular neuroscience and drug discovery and, more recently, has garnered recognition from the China's Ministry of Science and Technology through the establishment of the State Key Laboratory (SKL) of Molecular Neuroscience at HKUST. The SKL represents China's recognition of HKUST's unremitting efforts and excellence in the study of molecular neuroscience. Life science development at HKUST and in Hong Kong today is vastly different from when I first returned 18 years ago. Much progress has been made, such that there is a greater degree of funding support for innovative projects, there are more training opportunities locally, and the territory is beginning to witness the emergence of a dynamic research culture. Furthermore, HKUST is now recognized for leading-edge neuroscience research. In fact, due to its world-class reputation, extensive research outputs, and capacity to establish strong connections with leading neuroscientists and Nobel laureates, the university has been given the honor as the permanent site for the prestigious Gordon Research Conference in “Molecular and Cellular Neurobiology,” lending further credence to the quality of work undertaken at the university. A career as a scientist is highly rewarding. It is important to note, however, that accomplishments cannot be garnered overnight, but rather, are built one step at a time. There will be obstacles and numerous setbacks, but in my own personal experience, the keys to success have been passion, perseverance, dedication, teamwork, and developing an excellent support network. Asia is currently experiencing an exciting period of scientific development which requires tremendous input of talent, regardless of gender. There are infinite possibilities available to those who have the tenacity and determination to forge ahead with confidence and seize the opportunities. It is my hope that, over the next few years, these current advances in Asian biosciences will result in a significant increase in women scientists in the region such that one day gender will no longer be an issue and scientists will be viewed by their accomplishments alone."
