https://openalex.org/W3095415353,"Objective To investigate the blood coagulation function in COVID-19 patients, and the correlation between coagulopathy and disease severity. Methods We retrospectively collected 147 clinically diagnosed COVID-19 patients at Wuhan Leishenshan Hospital of Hubei, China. We analyzed the coagulation function in COVID-19 patients through the data including thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), α2-plasmininhibitor-plasmin Complex (PIC), thrombomodulin (TM), t-PA/PAI-1 Complex (t-PAIC), prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen (FIB), thrombin time (TT), D-Dimer (DD), and platelet (PLT). Result The levels of TAT, PIC, TM, t-PAIC, PT, INR, FIB, and DD in COVID-19 patients were higher than health controls (p<0.05), and also higher in the patients with thrombotic disease than without thrombotic disease (p<0.05). What’s more, the patients with thrombotic disease had a higher case-fatality (p<0.05). TAT, PIC, TM, t-PAIC, PT, INR, APTT, FIB, DD, and PLT were also found correlated with disease severity. Meanwhile, we found that there were significant difference in TAT, TM, t-PAIC, PT, INR, APTT, DD, and PLT in the death and survival group. Further using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis also found that t-PAIC and DD were independent risk factors for death in patients and are excellent predicting the mortality risk of COVID-19. Conclusion Most COVID-19 patients with inordinate coagulation systems, dynamic monitoring of coagulation parameters might be a key in the control of COVID-19 death."
https://openalex.org/W3095248707,"This study builds upon the literature documenting gender disparities in science by investigating research productivity and recognition among elite scientists in three countries. This analysis departs from both the general comparison of researchers across organizational settings and academic appointments on one hand, and the definition of “elite” by the research outcome variables on the other, which are common in previous studies. Instead, this paper’s approach considers the stratification of scientific careers by carefully constructing matched samples of men and women holding research chairs in Canada, the United States and South Africa, along with a control group of departmental peers. The analysis is based on a unique, hand-curated dataset including 943 researchers, which allows for a systematic comparison of successful scientists vetted through similar selection mechanisms. Our results show that even among elite scientists a pattern of stratified productivity and recognition by gender remains, with more prominent gaps in recognition. Our results point to the need for gender equity initiatives in science policy to critically examine assessment criteria and evaluation mechanisms to emphasize multiple expressions of research excellence."
https://openalex.org/W3096174763,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common complication of diabetes, and it is the consequence of microvascular retinal changes due to high glucose levels over a long time. Metabolomics profiling is a rapidly evolving method used to identify the metabolites in biological fluids and investigate disease progression. In this study, we used a targeted metabolomics approach to quantify the serum metabolites in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. Diabetes patients were divided into three groups based on the status of their complications: non-DR (NDR, n = 143), non-proliferative DR (NPDR, n = 123), and proliferative DR (PDR, n = 51) groups. Multiple logistic regression analysis and multiple testing corrections were performed to identify the significant differences in the metabolomics profiles of the different analysis groups. The concentrations of 62 metabolites of the NDR versus DR group, 53 metabolites of the NDR versus NPDR group, and 30 metabolites of the NDR versus PDR group were found to be significantly different. Finally, sixteen metabolites were selected as specific metabolites common to NPDR and PDR. Among them, three metabolites including total DMA, tryptophan, and kynurenine were potential makers of DR progression in T2D patients. Additionally, several metabolites such as carnitines, several amino acids, and phosphatidylcholines also showed a marker potential. The metabolite signatures identified in this study will provide insight into the mechanisms underlying DR development and progression in T2D patients in future studies."

Imitation and interpersonal synchrony impairments of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) might contribute to their difficulties in connecting and learning from others. Previous fMRI studies investigated cortical activation in children with ASD during finger/hand movement imitation; however, we do not know whether these findings generalize to naturalistic face-to-face imitation/interpersonal synchrony tasks. Using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), the current study assessed the cortical activation of children with and without ASD during a face-to-face interpersonal synchrony task. Fourteen children with ASD and 17 typically developing (TD) children completed three conditions: a) Watch—observed an adult clean up blocks; b) Do—cleaned up the blocks on their own; and c) Together—synchronized their block clean up actions to that of an adult. Children with ASD showed lower spatial and temporal synchrony accuracies but intact motor accuracy during the Together/interpersonal synchrony condition. In terms of cortical activation, children with ASD had hypoactivation in the middle and inferior frontal gyri (MIFG) as well as middle and superior temporal gyri (MSTG) while showing hyperactivation in the inferior parietal cortices/lobule (IPL) compared to the TD children. During the Together condition, the TD children showed bilaterally symmetrical activation whereas children with ASD showed more left-lateralized activation over MIFG and right-lateralized activation over MSTG. Additionally, using ADOS scores, in children with ASD greater social affect impairment was associated with lower activation in the left MIFG and more repetitive behavior impairment was associated with greater activation over bilateral MSTG. In children with ASD better communication performance on the VABS was associated with greater MIFG and/or MSTG activation. We identified objective neural biomarkers that could be utilized as outcome predictors or treatment response indicators in future intervention studies."
https://openalex.org/W3096090251,"The aim of our study was to examine the effects of crocin (0.5 (C0.5), 1 (C1) and 1.5 (C1.5) mM) and naringenin (50 (N50), 100 (N100) and 150 (N150) μM) in cryopreservation extender for freezing rooster semen. Sperm motility, viability, abnormalities, membrane functionality, active mitochondria, apoptosis status, lipid peroxidation (LP), GPX, SOD, TAC, the mRNA expression of pro-apoptotic (CASPASE 3) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2) genes, fertile eggs, hatched eggs and hatching rate were investigated following freeze-thawing. C1 and N100 resulted in higher (P < 0.05) total motility and progressive motility in comparison to the control group. The C1 and N100 groups improved viability, membrane functionality and reduced lipid peroxidation. We found higher values for active mitochondria with C1 and N100 compared to control group. The C1 and N100 groups showed lower percentages of early apoptosis when compared with control group. Also, C1 and N100 had higher TAC, compared to the control group. The mRNA expressions of BCL-2 in the C1 and N100 groups were significantly higher than that of other treatments. The expression of CASPASES 3 was significantly reduced in C1 and N100 group (P < 0.05) when compared to control group. Significantly higher percentages of fertile eggs, hatched eggs and hatching rate were observed in C1 and N100 compared to the control group. In conclusion, crocin at 1 mM and naringenin at 100 μM seem to improve the post-thawing rooster semen quality, fertility and could protect the sperm by reducing the pro-apoptotic (CASPASE 3) and increasing anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2) genes."
https://openalex.org/W3097439296,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although Thailand has been fairly effective at controlling the spread of COVID-19, continued disease surveillance and information on antibody response in recovered patients and their close contacts remain necessary in the absence of approved vaccines and antivirals. Here, we examined 217 recovered COVID-19 patients to assess their viral RNA shedding and residual antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. We also evaluated antibodies in blood samples from 308 close contacts of recovered COVID-19 patients. We found that viral RNA remained detectable in 6.6% of recovered COVID-19 cases and up to 105 days. IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 13.8%, 88.5%, and 83.4% of the recovered cases 4–12 weeks after disease onset, respectively. Higher levels of antibodies detected were associated with severe illness patients experienced while hospitalized. Fifteen of the 308 contacts (4.9%) of COVID-19 cases tested positive for IgG antibodies, suggesting probable exposure. Viral clearance and the pattern of antibody responses in infected individuals are both crucial for effectively combating SARS-CoV-2. Our study provides additional information on the natural history of this newly emerging disease related to both natural host defenses and antibody duration."
https://openalex.org/W3095015438,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are recruited and activated by solid tumors and play a role in tumor progression and metastasis. Here we show that MSCs promote metastasis in a panel of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. MSCs elicit transcriptional alterations in lung cancer cells leading to increased expression of factors implicated in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and secreted proteins including matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9). MSCs enhance secretion of enzymatically active MMP9 in a panel of lung adenocarcinoma cells. High expression of MMP9 is linked to low survival rates in lung adenocarcinoma patients. Notably, we found that ABL tyrosine kinases are activated in MSC-primed lung cancer cells and functional ABL kinases are required for MSC-induced MMP9 expression, secretion and proteolytic activity. Importantly, ABL kinases are required for MSC-induced NSCLC metastasis. These data reveal an actionable target for inhibiting MSC-induced metastatic activity of lung adenocarcinoma cells through disruption of an ABL kinase-MMP9 signaling axis activated in MSC-primed lung cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W3095951276,"Objective The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between grip strength and hypertension in the Korean population aged 65 years or older. Furthermore, individual differences in BMI were taken into account to examine whether grip strength or a relative grip strength predicted hypertension better. Methods Data from the Korean Longitudinal Study of Ageing from 2006 to 2016 were assessed, and a total of 3,383 participants were analyzed in our study (Male: 1,527, Female: 1,856). Using the generalized estimating equation model, the association between grip strength and hypertension, assessed by the response to the question 'have you ever been diagnosed with hypertension from your doctor?', over the follow-up period was analyzed. The relative grip strength, calculated by dividing the mean grip strength by BMI, was also analyzed in association of hypertension. Results Both grip strength and relative grip strength were significantly associated with hypertension in our sample. However, the results were more significant in the total sample when relative grip strength was used. In terms of grip strength, as the High group as reference: Low (Odds Ratio (OR): 1.238, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.096, 1.397), Middle Low (OR: 1.104, 95% CI: 0.990, 1.231), and Middle high (OR: 1.024, 95% CI: 0.934, 1.122). In the analysis using relative grip strength, as High group as reference: Low (OR: 1.393, 95% CI: 1.234, 1.573), Middle low (OR: 1.232, 95% CI: 1.104, 1.374), and Middle high (OR:1.104, 95% CI: 1.009, 1.209). Furthermore, the lower QIC measure in the model with relative grip strength (QIC: 25,251) compared with the one using grip strength (QIC: 25,266) indicated a better model fit in the former. Conclusions The results of the current study strengthen the previous findings in regards to hand grip strength and health. Furthermore, the results of our study shines light on the necessity of considering individual differences in BMI, when using a physical measure as a study variable."
https://openalex.org/W3096160574,"Background Global epidemiological transition across various countries have documented the coexistence of undernutrition and overnutrition. South Asian countries are facing this public health hazard in remarkable manner. To enrich the evidence and relation with women’s health in the Maldives, this study was undertaken to examine the prevalence and associated factors of underweight, overweight and obesity among reproductive age women. Methods This study was conducted utilizing data from the Maldives Demographic and Health Survey 2016–17. After presenting descriptive analyses, multivariable logistic regression analysis method was used to examine the prevalence and associations between different nutritional status categories. These were grouped based on the WHO recommended cut-off value and relevant socio-demographic determinants among reproductive age women. Results A total weighted sample of 6,634 reproductive age Maldivian women (15–49 years) were included in the analysis. The overall prevalence of overweight and obesity was 63%, while the underweight prevalence was 10%. The younger age group (15–24 years) had a higher prevalence of underweight (26%). On the other hand, an overweight and obesity prevalence of 82.6% was observed among the older age group (35–49 years). Regression analysis showed that residents of the North and Central Provinces, those in the higher quintiles of wealth index, married women and those with parity of more than two children, were all significantly negatively correlated to being underweight. Increased age, being married or separated/divorced/widowed and having more than three children was found to have a significant positive association with overweight and obesity. Conclusions Maldives is facing nutritional transition and a major public health hazard demonstrated by the high burden of overweight and obesity and persistence of chronic problem of undernutrition. Surveillance of vulnerable individuals with identified socio-demographic factors and cost-effective interventions are highly recommended to address the persistent underweight status and the emerging problem of overweight/obesity."
https://openalex.org/W3097147724,"Objective Toxic metals are suspected to play a role in the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration. However, difficulties in detecting the presence of multiple toxic metals within the intact human retina, and in separating primary metal toxicity from the secondary uptake of metals in damaged tissue, have hindered progress in this field. We therefore looked for the presence of several toxic metals in the posterior segment of normal adult eyes using elemental bioimaging. Methods Paraffin sections of the posterior segment of the eye from seven tissue donors (age range 54–74 years) to an eye bank were examined for toxic metals in situ using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry, a technique that detects multiple elements in tissues, as well as the histochemical technique of autometallography that demonstrates inorganic mercury, silver, and bismuth. No donor had a visual impairment, and no significant retinal abnormalities were seen on post mortem fundoscopy and histology. Results Metals found by laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry in the retinal pigment epithelium and choriocapillaris were lead (n = 7), nickel (n = 7), iron (n = 7), cadmium (n = 6), mercury (n = 6), bismuth (n = 5), aluminium (n = 3), and silver (n = 1). In the neural retina, mercury was present in six samples, and iron in one. Metals detected in the optic nerve head were iron (N = 7), mercury (N = 7), nickel (N = 4), and aluminium (N = 1). No gold or chromium was seen. Autometallography demonstrated probable inorganic mercury in the retinal pigment epithelium of one donor. Conclusion Several toxic metals are taken up by the human retina and optic nerve head. Injury to the retinal pigment epithelium from toxic metals could damage the neuroprotective functions of the retinal pigment epithelium and allow toxic metals to enter the outer neural retina. These findings support the hypothesis that accumulations of toxic metals in the retina could contribute to the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3097404996,"Virtual reality (VR) technology is commonly used in balance research due to its ability to simulate real world experiences under controlled experimental conditions. However, several studies reported considerable differences in balance behavior in real world environments as compared to virtual environments presented in a head mounted display. Most of these studies were conducted more than a decade ago, at a time when VR was still struggling with major technical limitations (delays, limited field-of-view, etc.). In the meantime, VR technology has progressed considerably, enhancing its capacity to induce the feeling of presence and behavioural realism. In this study, we addressed two questions: Has VR technology now reached a point where balance is similar in real and virtual environments? And does the integration of visual cues for balance depend on the subjective experience of presence? We used a state-of-the-art head mounted VR system and a custom-made balance platform to compare balance when viewing (1) a real-world environment, (2) a photo-realistic virtual copy of the real-world environment, (3) an abstract virtual environment consisting of only spheres and bars (‘low presence’ VR condition), and, as reference, (4) a condition with eyes closed. Body sway of ten participants was measured in three different support surface conditions: (A) quiet stance, (B) stance on a sway referenced surface, and (C) surface tilting following a pseudo-random sequence. A 2-level repeated measures ANOVA and PostHoc analyses revealed no significant differences in body sway between viewing the real world environment and the photo-realistic virtual copy. In contrast, body sway was increased in the ‘low presence’ abstract scene and further increased with eyes closed. Results were consistent across platform conditions. Our results support the hypothesis that state of the art VR reached a point of behavioural realism in which balance in photo-realistic VR is similar to balance in a real environment. Presence was lower in the abstract virtual condition as compared to the photo-realistic condition as measured by the IPQ presence questionnaire. Thus, our results indicate that spatial presence may be a moderating factor, but further research is required to confirm this notion. We conceive that virtual reality is a valid tool for balance research, but that the properties of the virtual environment affects results."
https://openalex.org/W3095279680,"The first cases of COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus were reported in China in December 2019. The disease has since spread globally. Many countries have instated measures to slow the spread of the virus. Information about the spread of the virus in a country can inform the gradual reopening of a country and help to avoid a second wave of infections. Our study focuses on Denmark, which is opening up when this study is performed (end-May 2020) after a lockdown in mid-March.We perform a phylogenetic analysis of 742 publicly available Danish SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences and put them into context using sequences from other countries.Our findings are consistent with several introductions of the virus to Denmark from independent sources. We identify several chains of mutations that occurred in Denmark. In at least one case we find evidence that the virus spread from Denmark to other countries. A number of the mutations found in Denmark are non-synonymous, and in general there is a considerable variety of strains. The proportions of the most common haplotypes remain stable after lockdown.Employing phylogenetic methods on Danish genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2, we exemplify how genetic data can be used to trace the introduction of a virus to a country. This provides alternative means for verifying existing assumptions. For example, our analysis supports the hypothesis that the virus was brought to Denmark by skiers returning from Ischgl. On the other hand, we identify transmission routes which suggest that Denmark was part of a network of countries among which the virus was being transmitted. This challenges the common narrative that Denmark only got infected from abroad. Our analysis concerning the ratio of haplotypes does not indicate that the major haplotypes appearing in Denmark have a different degree of virality."
https://openalex.org/W3095413843,"Purpose The aim of the present study is to analyze the changes in retinal vessel density (VD), using Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCT-A), in patients that received endoscopic endonasal approach for the removal of an intra-suprasellar pituitary adenoma compressing optic chiasm. Methods We evaluated the VD in Superficial Capillary Plexus (SCP), Deep Capillary Plexus (DCP), Radial Peripapillary Capillary (RPC) and the Foveal Avascular Zone (FAZ) area in a series of fourteen patients (7 males, 7 females, mean age 56 ± 13 years), as compared to healthy controls. We also detected the structural Spectral Domain (SD)-OCT parameters: Ganglion Cell Complex (GCC), Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer (RNFL), visual field parameters (Mean Deviation, Pattern Standard Deviation) and Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA). These measurements were performed prior than surgery and 48 hours after. Results The patients showed a significant decrease in VD of the macular and papillary regions, a significant increase in FAZ area, a significant impairment in SD-OCT, VF parameters and BCVA respect to 14 eyes of 14 healthy controls (p<0.05), at pre-op evaluation. In patients group the VD in SCP, DCP and RPC increased after surgery respect to baseline but the difference turned to be out statistically significant only in RPC (p = 0.003). Also the BCVA (p = 0.040) and the Mean Deviation at visual field (p = 0.015) significantly improved after surgery. While there was a reduction in structural OCT parameters but it was statistically significant only in GCC (p = 0.039). A positive correlation was found between the preoperative VD of the RPC, Mean Deviation, BCVA and the postoperative Mean Deviation (r = 0.426 p = 0.027; r = 0.624 p = 0.001; r = 0.515 p = 0.006). Conclusion OCT-A allows to detect the early changes occurring within 48 hours after surgery showing that the improvement in retinal vessel density could occur before the recovery of the structural OCT parameters and can be a positive predictive factor for the functional recovery."
https://openalex.org/W3095218577,"Introduction Women migrating to high-income countries may have increased risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes as compared with native-born women. However, little is known whether migrant women are more likely to have unhealthy body mass index (BMI) or gestational weight gain (GWG), which is of importance considering the well-established links between unhealthy BMI and GWG with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Hence, the aim of the study was to examine the prevalence and estimate odds ratios (ORs) of underweight and obesity in the first trimester as well as inadequate and excessive GWG across birth regions in migrant (first-generation) and Swedish-born women in a population-based sample of pregnant women in Sweden. Methods This population-based study included 535 609 pregnancies from the Swedish Pregnancy Register between the years 2010–2018. This register has a coverage of approximately 90% and includes data on body weight, height, birth country and educational attainment. BMI in the first trimester of pregnancy was classified as underweight, normal weight, overweight and obesity whereas GWG was classified as inadequate, adequate and excessive according to the recommendations from the National Academy of Medicine, USA. BMI and GWG were examined according to 7 birth regions and the 100 individual birth countries. Adjusted ORs of underweight, obesity as well as inadequate or excessive GWG by birth regions were estimated using multinomial logistic regression. Results There were large disparities in unhealthy BMI and GWG across birth regions. For instance, women born in North Africa and Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa had 1.40 (95% CI 1.35–1.44) and 2.13 (95% CI 2.03–2.23) higher odds of obesity compared with women born in Sweden. However, women born in Sub-Saharan Africa had also considerably higher odds of underweight (OR, 2.93 [95% CI 2.70–3.18]) and inadequate GWG (OR, 1.97 [95% CI 1.87–2.07]). The limitations of the study include the lack of a validated measure of acculturation and that the study only had data on first-generation migration. Conclusions The large differences across the 7 regions and 100 countries highlights the importance of considering birth region and country-specific risks of unhealthy BMI and GWG in first-generation migrant women. Furthermore, inadequate GWG was common among pregnant first-generation migrant women, especially in women born in Sub-Saharan Africa, which demonstrates the need to promote adequate GWG, not only the avoidance of excessive GWG. Thus, our findings also indicate that additional support and interventions may be needed for first-generation migrant women from certain birth regions and countries in order to tackle the observed disparities in unhealthy BMI and GWG. Although further studies are needed, our results are useful for identifying groups of women at increased risk of unhealthy BMI and weight gain during pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W3095268398,"Hypnosis is a powerful tool to affect the processing and perception of stimuli. Here, we investigated the effects of hypnosis on the processing of auditory stimuli, the time course of event-related-potentials (ERP; N1 and P3b amplitudes) and the activity of cortical sources of the P3b component. Forty-eight participants completed an auditory oddball paradigm composed of standard, distractor, and target stimuli during a hypnosis (HYP), a simulation of hypnosis (SIM), a distraction (DIS), and a control (CON) condition. During HYP, participants were suggested that an earplug would obstruct the perception of tones and during SIM they should pretend being hypnotized and obstructed to hear the tones. During DIS, participants’ attention was withdrawn from the tones by focusing participants’ attention onto a film. In each condition, subjects were asked to press a key whenever a target stimulus was presented. Behavioral data show that target hit rates and response time became significantly reduced during HYP and SIM and loudness ratings of tones were only reduced during HYP. Distraction from stimuli by the film was less effective in reducing target hit rate and tone loudness. Although, the N1 amplitude was not affected by the experimental conditions, the P3b amplitude was significantly reduced in HYP and SIM compared to CON and DIS. In addition, source localization results indicate that only a small number of neural sources organize the differences of tone processing between the control condition and the distraction, hypnosis, and simulation of hypnosis conditions. These sources belong to brain areas that control the focus of attention, the discrimination of auditory stimuli, and the organization of behavioral responses to targets. Our data confirm that deafness suggestions significantly change auditory processing and perception but complete deafness is hard to achieve during HYP. Therefore, the term ‘deafness’ may be misleading and should better be replaced by ‘hypoacusis’."
https://openalex.org/W3095395785,"Introduction Physical inactivity among adults aged 50 years and over is a worldwide health concern. The objectives of the study were to investigate the perspectives of those involved with existing physical activity programmes on optimising recruitment, sustainability and scalability of physical activity programmes for adults aged 50 years and over. Methods The study was conducted in Ireland’s Midwest region, where community-based physical activity programmes are delivered to groups by state-funded Local Sports Partnerships. Programme attendees, physical activity professionals and community advocates were recruited. One-to-one interviews and focus groups were conducted in 2018, recorded, transcribed and analysed by an interdisciplinary team experienced in qualitative research. Over a series of meetings, a thematic approach was used to code and analyse the transcripts, categorising data into higher order codes, themes and overarching themes with the purpose of making meaning of the data. Twenty-nine people participated in four focus groups and 18 participated in one-to-one interviews. Findings Data analysis produced three overarching themes. “Age appropriate” explains how communication and the environment should be adapted to the needs of adults aged 50 years and older. “Culture and connection” refer to the interplay of individual and social factors that influence participation, including individual fears and insecurities, group cohesion and added value beyond the physical gains in these programmes. “Roles and partnerships” outlines how key collaborations may be identified and managed and how local ownership is key to success and scalability. Conclusion Successful recruitment, sustainability and scalability require an understanding that the target population has unique needs that must be catered for when planning interventions, communicating messages and choosing personnel. The findings of this study can inform the development of community-based programmes to increase physical activity in adults aged 50 years and older."
https://openalex.org/W3095429254,"The complex undulated geometry of seal whiskers has been shown to substantially modify the turbulent structures directly downstream, resulting in a reduction of hydrodynamic forces as well as modified vortex-induced-vibration response when compared with smooth whiskers. Although the unique hydrodynamic response has been well documented, an understanding of the fluid flow effects from each geometric feature remains incomplete. In this computational investigation, nondimensional geometric parameters of the seal whisker morphology are defined in terms of their hydrodynamic relevance, such that wavelength, aspect ratio, undulation amplitudes, symmetry and undulation off-set can be varied independently of one another. A two-factor fractional factorial design of experiments procedure is used to create 16 unique geometries, each of which dramatically amplifies or attenuates the geometric parameters compared with the baseline model. The flow over each unique topography is computed with a large-eddy simulation at a Reynolds number of 500 with respect to the mean whisker thickness and the effects on force and frequency are recorded. The results determine the specific fluid flow impact of each geometric feature which will inform both biologists and engineers who seek to understand the impact of whisker morphology or lay out a framework for biomimetic design of undulated structures."
https://openalex.org/W3095508529,"Ongoing losses of pollinators are of significant international concern because of the essential role they have in our ecosystem, agriculture, and economy. Both chemical and non-chemical stressors have been implicated as possible contributors to their decline, but the increasing use of neonicotinoid insecticides has recently emerged as particularly concerning. In this study, honey bees were exposed orally to sublethal doses of the neonicotinoid clothianidin in the field in order to assess its effects on the foraging behavior, homing success, and dance communication. The foraging span and foraging activity at the contaminated feeder decreased significantly due to chronic exposure at field-realistic concentrations. Electrostatic field of dancing bees was measured and it was revealed that the number of waggle runs, the fanning time and the number of stop signals were significantly lower in the exposed colony. No difference was found in the homing success and the flight duration between control and treated bees released at a novel location within the explored area. However, a negative effect of the ambient temperature, and an influence of the location of the trained feeder was found. Finally, the residues of clothianidin accumulated in the abdomens of exposed foraging bees over time. These results show the adverse effects of a chronic exposure to sublethal doses of clothianidin on foraging and dance communication in honey bees."
https://openalex.org/W3095732374,"There has been considerable focus on the main, expansionary, and inter-regionally linked or ‘globalising’ periods in Old World pre- and proto-history, with a focus on identifying, analyzing and dating collapse at the close of these pivotal periods. The end of the Early Bronze Age in the late third millennium BCE and a subsequent ‘intermediate’ or transitional period before the Middle Bronze Age (~2200–1900 BCE), and the end of the Late Bronze Age in the late second millennium BCE and the ensuing period of transformation during the Early Iron Age (~1200–900 BCE), are key examples. Among other issues, climate change is regularly invoked as a cause or factor in both cases. Recent considerations of “collapse” have emphasized the unpredictability and variability of responses during such periods of reorganization and transformation. Yet, a gap in scholarly attention remains in documenting the responses observed at important sites during these ‘transformative’ periods in the Old World region. Tell Tayinat in southeastern Turkey, as a major archaeological site occupied during these two major ‘in between’ periods of transformation, offers a unique case for comparing and contrasting differing responses to change. To enable scholarly assessment of associations between the local trajectory of the site and broader regional narratives, an essential preliminary need is a secure, resolved timeframe for the site. Here we report a large set of radiocarbon data and incorporate the stratigraphic sequence using Bayesian chronological modelling to create a refined timeframe for Tell Tayinat and a secure basis for analysis of the site with respect to its broader regional context and climate history."
https://openalex.org/W3096948397,"The genus Pygocentrus contains three valid piranha species (P. cariba, P. nattereri and P. piraya) that are allopatric in tropical and subtropical freshwater environments of South America. This study uses acoustic features to differentiate the three species. Sounds were recorded in P. cariba, two populations of P. nattereri (red- and yellow-bellied) and P. piraya; providing sound description for the first time in P. cariba and P. piraya. Calls of P. cariba were distinct from all the other studied populations. Red- and yellow-bellied P. nattereri calls were different from each other but yellow-bellied P. nattereri calls were similar to those of P. piraya. These observations can be explained by considering that the studied specimens of yellow-bellied P. nattereri have been wrongly identified and are actually a sub-population of P. piraya. Morphological examinations and recent fish field recordings in the Araguari River strongly support our hypothesis.

Methods Using a Swedish cohort of men selected randomly as controls to men with prostate cancer diagnosed 2007–2013, we estimated the association between medications prescribed during the previous year and mortality rates, using Cox regression stratified for age. Results Among the 326,450 older men with median age of 69 years included in this study, 73% were categorized as free of comorbidity according to the Charlson Comorbidity Index; however, 84% had received at least one prescription during the year preceding the follow-up. This was associated with a 60% overall increase in mortality rate (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.56 to 1.64). Some drugs that were unexpectedly associated with mortality included locally acting antacids (HR = 4.7, 95% CI 4.4 to 5.1), propulsives (HR = 4.7, 95% CI 4.4 to 5.0), vitamin A and D (HR = 4.6, 95% CI 4.3 to 4.9), and loop diuretics, for example furosemide (HR = 3.7; 95% CI 3.6 to 3.8). Thiazide diuretics, however, were only weakly associated with a mortality risk (HR = 1.5; 95% CI 1.4 to 1.5). Surprisingly, only weak associations with mortality were seen for major cardiovascular drug classes. Conclusions A majority of older men had a history of prescribed medications and many drug classes were associated with mortality rate, including drug classes not directly indicated for a specific comorbidity represented in commonly used comorbidity measures. Prescription history can improve baseline risk assessment but some associations might be context-sensitive."
https://openalex.org/W3096339318,"Introduction Unhealthy lifestyles may hinder bariatric surgery outcomes. This non-randomized controlled study aimed to evaluate the effects of an integrated post-operative exercise-based educational and motivational program in improving behaviors, quality of life, anthropometric features, cardiorespiratory and physical fitness in bariatric patients respect to the only surgical intervention. Methods A group of adult sedentary bariatric patients chose to attend a 12-month exercise program integrated with diet education and motivational support, or to receive usual care. Dietary habits, binge eating disorder, physical activity, obesity-related quality of life, Body Mass Index, waist and hip circumference, VO2max, strength and flexibility were assessed at the start and at the end of the study in both groups. Results On a total of 82 patients enrolled, follow-up measures were obtained from 28 (85.7% females, mean age 38.2±8.7) and 42 (71.4% females, mean age 40.2±9.5) patients included in the intervention and control group, respectively. All the behavioral and physical outcomes improved significantly in the participants to the intervention, while the control group showed lesser changes, especially regarding quality of life and physical fitness. Conclusions Notwithstanding the self-selection, these results suggest that a timely postoperative behavioral multidisciplinary program for bariatric patients may be effective in establishing healthy behaviors which can lead to better surgery outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3096020469,"Background In the context of an aging population, quality of life (QOL) is an important consideration for the well-being of the elderly. However, there is limited information on the QOL of the elderly in Myanmar. This study aimed to explore the risk factors for low QOL among the elderly in urban and peri-urban areas of the Yangon Region, Myanmar. Methods A community-based, cross-sectional study was conducted among the elderly aged 60 years or older in two urban and two peri-urban townships in the Yangon Region from July to September 2019. A multi-stage sampling method was used to recruit study participants using a pre-tested questionnaire. A total of 616 (305 males and 311 females) elderly people were interviewed using a face-to-face interview technique. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed on the four domains (physical health, psychological health, social relationship, and environment) of QOL measured with the WHOQOL-BREF. Results Income level and having intimate friends influenced the QOL scores of the elderly in all domains, while education level and marital status influenced psychological health, social relationship, and environment domains. Social interaction with neighbors increased the QOL scores for physical health, social relationship, and environment domains. Living in peri-urban areas was associated with lower QOL scores for physical health, psychological health, and environment, while participation in group activities increased QOL scores in these domains. Having comorbidities affected the QOL for psychological health and environment domains, while the frequency of going out affected physical health, and the frequency of religious performance affected social relationship. Conclusion Residential location, education level, marital status, income, comorbidities, social interactions with neighbors and friends, participation in group activities, and frequencies of going out and religious activities should be considered in planning and implementing programs for the elderly in Myanmar. Peri-urban development, strengthening healthcare and social security systems, and encouraging social interaction and participation in group activities play critical roles in improving the QOL for elderly residing in Myanmar."
https://openalex.org/W3097548998,"Temporal lobe adult-onset seizures (TAOS) related to autoimmunity represent an increasingly recognized disease syndrome within the spectrum of epilepsies. In this context, certain autoantibodies (autoABs) were often associated with limbic encephalitis (LE). Here, we aimed to gain insights into (a) the distribution of ‘neurological’ autoABs (neuroABs, defined as autoABs targeting neuronal surface structures or ‘onconeuronal’ ABs or anti-glutamate acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) autoABs) in a large consecutive TAOS patient cohort, to characterize (b) clinical profiles of seropositive versus seronegative individuals and to find (c) potential evidence for other autoABs. Blood sera/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of TAOS patients (n = 800) and healthy donors (n = 27) were analyzed for neuroABs and screened for other autoABs by indirect immunofluorescence on hippocampal/cerebellar sections and immunoblots of whole brain and synaptosome lysates. Serological results were correlated with clinico-neuropsychological features. 13% of TAOS patients (n = 105) were neuroAB+, with anti-GAD65 and anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) as most frequent autoABs in this group. In our screening tests 25% of neuroAB- patients (n = 199) were positive (screening+), whereas all control samples were negative (n = 27). Intriguingly, key clinico-neuropsychological characteristics including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, epileptiform electroencephalographic (EEG) activity, and inflammatory cellular infiltrates in CSF were shared to a greater extent by neuroAB+ with neuroAB-/screening+ patients than with neuroAB-/screening- patients. Serological testing in a large consecutive TAOS patient series revealed seropositivity for anti-GAD65 autoABs as the most frequent neuroAB. Intriguingly, neuroAB+ individuals were virtually indistinguishable from neuroAB-/screening+ patients in several major clinical features. In contrast, neuroAB-/screening- TAOS patients differed in many parameters. These data support the potential presence of so far unrecognized autoABs in patients with TAOS."
https://openalex.org/W3097930639,"Radiation for pelvic cancers can result in severe bladder damage and radiation cystitis (RC), which is characterized by chronic inflammation, fibrosis, and vascular damage. RC development is poorly understood because bladder biopsies are difficult to obtain. The goal of this study is to gain understanding of molecular changes that drive radiation-induced cystitis in cancer survivors using urine samples from prostate cancer survivors with history of radiation therapy. 94 urine samples were collected from prostate cancer survivors with (n = 85) and without (n = 9) history of radiation therapy. 15 patients with radiation history were officially diagnosed with radiation cystitis. Levels of 47 different proteins were measured using Multiplex Luminex. Comparisons were made between non-irradiated and irradiated samples, and within irradiated samples based on radiation cystitis diagnosis, symptom scores or hematuria. Statistical analysis was performed using Welch’s t-test. In prostate cancer survivors with history of radiation therapy, elevated levels of PAI 1, TIMP1, TIMP2, HGF and VEGF-A were detected in patients that received a radiation cystitis diagnosis. These proteins were also increased in patients suffering from hematuria or high symptom scores. No inflammatory proteins were detected in the urine, except in patients with gross hematuria and end stage radiation cystitis. Active fibrosis and vascular distress is detectable in the urine through elevated levels of associated proteins. Inflammation is only detected in urine of patients with end-stage radiation cystitis disease. These results suggest that fibrosis and vascular damage drive the development of radiation cystitis and could lead to the development of more targeted treatments."
https://openalex.org/W3094739108,"Introduction Measuring the performance of a primary care system is one of the very first steps to find out whether there is room for improvement. To obtain an objective and comprehensive view, this measurement should come from both the supply and demand sides of the system. Patients’ experiences of primary care have been studied around the world, but much less energy has been invested in researching providers’ perspectives. This research aims to explore how primary care physicians working at commune health centers in Vietnam evaluate their performance and their opinions on how to improve the quality of primary care services. Materials and methods First, a quantitative study was conducted using the validated Vietnamese PCAT questionnaire—provider expanded version (VN PCAT PE) targeting all primary care physicians (PCPs) working at commune health centers in a province of Central Vietnam. Next, a qualitative study was carried out, consisting of in-depth interviews with PCPs, to better understand the results of the quantitative survey and gain insight on barriers of primary care services and how to overcome them. Results In the quantitative portion of our study, 150 PCPs rated the quality of ongoing care and first contact in CHCs as the best (3.09 and 3.11 out of 4, respectively), and coordination as the worst performing core domain (2.53). Twenty-two PCPs also participated in our qualitative research. In regards to challenges that primary care physicians face during their daily practice, three central themes emerged: 1) patient factors such as client attitude and knowledge, 2) provider factors such as the burden of administrative work and lack of training opportunities, and 3) contextual factors such as low income and lack of resources including medicines and diagnostics. Participants recommended more health promotion campaigns in the media, increasing the number of services available at CHCs (such as being able to take blood samples), reducing the workload related to administration for CHC leaders, greater government subsidies, and providing more training courses for PCPs. Conclusions Findings from this study offer a valuable view from the supply-side of the primary care system, specifically those who directly deliver primary care services. Along with the earlier study on consumers’ evaluation of the Vietnamese primary care system, and literature from other low and middle-income countries, these findings offer emerging evidence for policymakers to improve the quality of primary care in Vietnam."
https://openalex.org/W3095472530,"Motor learning studies demonstrate that an individual’s natural motor variability predicts the rate at which she learns a motor task. Individuals exhibiting higher variability learn motor tasks faster, presumably because variability fosters exploration of a wider space of motor parameters. However, it is unclear how individuals regulate variability while learning a motor task together with a partner who perturbs their movements. In the current study, we investigated whether and how variability affects performance and learning in such joint actions. Participants learned to jointly perform a sequence of movements with a confederate who was either highly variable or less variable in her movements. A haptic coupling between the actors led to translation of partner’s movement variability into a force perturbation. We tested how the variability and predictability of force perturbations coming from a partner foster or hamper individual and joint performance. In experiment 1, the confederate produced more or less variable range of force perturbations that occurred in an unpredictable order. In experiment 2, the confederate produced more or less variable force perturbations in a predictable order. In experiment 3, the confederate produced more or less variable force perturbations in which the magnitude of force delivered was predictable whereas the direction of the force was unpredictable. We analysed individual performance, measured as movement accuracy and joint performance, measured as interpersonal asynchrony. Results indicated that in all three experiments, participants successfully regulated the variability of their own movements. However, individual performance was worse when partner produced highly variable force perturbations in an unpredictable order. Interestingly, predictability of force perturbations offset the detrimental effects of variability on individual performance. Furthermore, participants in the high variability condition achieved higher flexibility and resilience for a wide range of force perturbations, when the partner produced predictable movements. Participants improved their joint performance with a highly variable partner only when the partner produced partially predictable movements. Our results indicate that individuals involved in a joint action selectively rely on either their own or their partner’s variability (or both) for benefitting individual and joint action performance, depending on the predictability of the partner’ movements."
https://openalex.org/W3096056060,"Background Blood transfusion is a therapeutic procedure that has proven to be effective in saving millions of lives. However, its safety is still a crucial issue that needs due attention. Unsafe blood transfusion is one of the sources of transmission for infectious agents. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the sero-prevalence of Transfusion Transmittable Infections (TTIs) such as Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Hepatitis C virus (HCV), Treponema pallidum, and associated factors among blood donors in Ethiopia. Methods A retrospective cross-sectional study design was used to measure the prevalence of transfusion transmittable infections using data collected from 2014 to 2019 in fourteen blood bank facilities in Ethiopia. Screening of HIV, HBV and HCV was done by using the Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Presence of Treponema pallidum infection was assessed using rapid plasma reagin (RPR). Records of blood donors were collected using a checklist from Central Blood Bank Laboratory (BBL) electronic database and reviewed. Data was entered, cleaned and analyzed using SPSS version 23. Logistic regression was fitted to identify factors associated with cumulative TTIs positivity, and for each of the transfusion transmittable infection. P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result A total of 554,954 blood donors in the fourteen blood bank facilities from 2014–2019 was included in the study. The overall sero-prevalence of HBV, Treponema pallidum, HIV and HCV, was 2.4%, 0.9%, 0.4% and 0.4% respectively. The prevalence of TTIs was comparatively higher in 2014, 5.70% and lowest in 2019, 3.40%. The odds of screening HBV in blood donors in age group of 35–39 and 40–44 were 1.2 [1.1, 1.3] and 1.3 [1.1, 1.5] respectively. The odds of screening HCV in blood donors in the age group of 25–34, 35–44 and 45–54 were 1.3 [1.1, 1.5], 1.3 [1.1, 1.7] and 1.7 [1.2, 2.2] respectively. The likelihood of having at least one infection among blood donors was 1.2 [1.1, 1.3] times in male blood donors compared to female. The odds of getting at least one TTI and Treponema pallidum in unemployed blood donors were 2.4 [2.0, 2.8] and 8.1 [6.1, 10.7] respectively. The probability of getting those who have at least one TTIs, HBV and Treponema pallidum were higher in blood donors those who live in Semi Urban and Rural parts of the country than those who live in Urban areas. The odds of having at least one TTI, HBV and HCV in blood donors with mobile mode of blood donation were 1.4 [1.3, 1.6], 1.6 [1.4, 1.8], and 1.6 [1.1, 2.2]. Conclusion The current magnitudes of TTIs are lower when compared to other previous studies conducted in Ethiopia. Older age, male, occupation, donations from mobile sites, residents of semi urban and rural settings were found to be strongly associated with sero-positivity of TTIs. Hence, strict donor screening and testing particularly taking the above factors into consideration is strongly recommended."
https://openalex.org/W3094820098,"To prevent transmission of the pathogenic chytrid fungi Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal), hygiene protocols prescribe the single use of disposable gloves for handling amphibians. We discovered that rinse water from nitrile gloves instantly kills 99% of Bd and Bsal zoospores. Transmission experiments using midwife toads (Alytes obstetricans) and Bd, and Alpine newts (Ichthyosaura alpestris) and Bsal, show that the use of the same pair of gloves for 2 subsequent individuals does not result in significant transmission of any chytrid fungus. In contrast, handling infected amphibians bare-handed caused transmission of Bsal in 4 out of 10 replicates, but did not result in transmission of Bd. Based on the manufacturer’s information, high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) and colorimetric tests, calcium lactate and calcium nitrate were identified as compounds with antifungal activity against both Bd and Bsal. These findings corroborate the importance of wearing gloves as an important sanitary measure in amphibian disease prevention. If the highly recommended single use of gloves is not possible, handling multiple post-metamorphic amphibians with the same pair of nitrile gloves should still be preferred above bare-handed manipulation."
https://openalex.org/W3095168061,"Background Historically, Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) are disproportionately affected by disasters. In Pacific Island Countries (PICs), the risks and vulnerabilities of PwDs arise from social inequalities, as well as environmental barriers. As the frequency and intensity of disasters will increase over the next decade, it is critical that the challenges faced by PwDs are addressed and that they are prepared. Objective This study explores disaster preparedness, perceptions, and experiences with disasters among PwDs in Tuvalu. Methods This qualitative study was carried out among people with physical and sensory disabilities and without post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), who are aged 21 and above. Using grounded theory methodology, semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with 24 participants, with 7 then participating in a Focus Group Discussion (FGD). Results A total of 31 PwDs participated, of which 65% were male and 35% female, with a mean age of 44 ±15.70. The results showed how the PwDs ability to prepare, their perceptions, and experiences with disasters have contributed to their resilience to disasters. Conclusion This study highlights the importance of understanding PwDs lived disaster experience to improve their preparedness and resilience for future disasters. This knowledge will assist government and non-government organisations, communities, and families to develop policies and plans that will enhance the preparedness of PwDs for disasters."
https://openalex.org/W3095498561,"Background In Ethiopia about 25% of rural women are chronically malnourished. Non-pregnant and non-lactating women present an opportunity to implement strategies to correct maternal and child health status and to potentiate improved pregnancy outcomes in developing countries like Ethiopia. The determinant factors of chronic energy deficiency vary across settings and contexts; hence, it is important to identify local determinant factors in order to implement effective and efficient intervention strategies. Objective To assess the determinants of chronic energy deficiency of non-pregnant, non-lactating rural women within the reproductive age group (15–49 years), in rural kebeles of Dera district, North West Ethiopia, 2019. Methods A community based unmatched case control study was conducted. A total of 552 participants were involved and a multi-stage sampling technique was used to select the samples. Data was collected from January 15 to February 30, 2019 using face-to-face interviews and anthropometric assessments. EPI-info version 7 and SPSS™ version 23 were used for data entry and analysis, respectively. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to analyze the association between dependent and independent variables. Association was considered statistically significant at 95% CI with p-value < 0.05 in multivariable logistic regression. Result A total of 548 non-pregnant, non-lactating women with 137 cases and 411 controls were included in the study with a response rate of 99.3%. High family size (AOR = 1.88, 95% CI: 1.085, 3.275), low educational status (AOR = 3.389, 95% CI: 1.075, 10.683), inadequate meal frequency (AOR = 5.345, 95% CI: 2.266, 12.608), absence of home garden (AOR = 5.612, 95% CI: 3.177, 9.915) and absence of latrine facility (AOR = 6.365, 95% CI: 3.534, 11.462) were found positively associated with chronic energy deficiency. Conclusion and recommendation Inadequate meal frequency, absence of home gardening, absence of latrine facility, high family size and educational status of illiterate were the determinants of chronic energy deficiency, thus indicating the imperative for a multi-sectoral approach with health, agriculture and education entities developing and delivering interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3096295388,"Worldwide, many pollinator populations are in decline. Population reductions have been documented for the agriculturally important honey bee (Apis mellifera), and other bee species such as bumble bees that are also critical for pollinating crops and natural landscapes. A variety of factors contribute to the observed population reductions, including exposure to agrochemicals. In recent decades, neonicotinoid pesticide use has dramatically increased, as have concerns regarding the safety of these chemicals for pollinator health. Here we assessed the toxicity of the neonicotinoid acetamiprid to the bumble bee Bombus impatiens, a species commercially available for use in agricultural settings in North America. Using the microcolony model, we examined nest growth, development and subsequent nest productivity as measured by drone production. We found that high concentrations of acetamiprid in syrup (11,300 μg/L) significantly impacted nest growth and development, and ultimately drone production, and exposure to 1,130 μg/L acetamiprid also significantly decreased drone production. The no observable adverse effect level was 113 μg/L. Overall, acetamiprid delivered in syrup can negatively impact B. impatiens nest development and productivity, however only at concentrations above which would be expected in the environment when used according to label rates."
https://openalex.org/W3095952331,"The genus Oecomys (Rodentia, Sigmodontinae) is distributed from southern Central America to southeastern Brazil in South America. It currently comprises 18 species, but multidisciplinary approaches such as karyotypic, morphological and molecular studies have shown that there is a greater diversity within some lineages than others. In particular, it has been proposed that O. constitutes a species complex with three evolutionary units, which have been called the northern, eastern and western clades. Aiming to clarify the taxonomic status of O. and determine the relevant chromosomal rearrangements, we investigated the karyotypes of samples from eastern Amazonia by chromosomal banding and FISH with Hylaeamys megacephalus (HME) whole-chromosome probes. We detected three cytotypes for O. paricola: A (OPA-A; 2n = 72, FN = 75), B (OPA-B; 2n = 70, FN = 75) and C (OPA-C; 2n = 70, FN = 72). Comparative chromosome painting showed that fusions/fissions, translocations and pericentric inversions or centromeric repositioning were responsible for the karyotypic divergence. We also detected exclusive chromosomal signatures that can be used as phylogenetic markers. Our analysis of karyotypic and distribution information indicates that OPA-A, OPA-B and OPA-C are three distinct species that belong to the eastern clade, with sympatry occurring between two of them, and that the paricola group is more diverse than was previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W3097177230,"In recent years, deep learning (DL) networks have been widely used in super-resolution (SR) and exhibit improved performance. In this paper, an image quality assessment (IQA)-guided single image super-resolution (SISR) method is proposed in DL architecture, in order to achieve a nice tradeoff between perceptual quality and distortion measure of the SR result. Unlike existing DL-based SR algorithms, an IQA net is introduced to extract perception features from SR results, calculate corresponding loss fused with original absolute pixel loss, and guide the adjustment of SR net parameters. To solve the problem of heterogeneous datasets used by IQA and SR networks, an interactive training model is established via cascaded network. We also propose a pairwise ranking hinge loss method to overcome the shortcomings of insufficient samples during training process. The performance comparison between our proposed method with recent SISR methods shows that the former achieves a better tradeoff between perceptual quality and distortion measure than the latter. Extensive benchmark experiments and analyses also prove that our method provides a promising and opening architecture for SISR, which is not confined to a specific network model."
https://openalex.org/W3097536401,"In this paper, we propose a new interface to control VR(Virtual reality) contents, games, and animations in real-time using the user’s breath and the acceleration sensor of a mobile device. Although interaction techniques are very important in VR and physically-based animations, UI(User interface) methods using different types of devices or controllers have not been covered. Most of the proposed interaction techniques have focused on screen touch and motion recognition. The direction of the breath is calculated using the position and angle between the user and the mobile device, and the control position to handle the contents is determined using the acceleration sensor built into the mobile device. Finally, to remove the noise contained in the input breath, the magnitude of the wind is filtered using a kernel modeling a pattern similar to the actual breath. To demonstrate the superiority of this study, we produced real-time interaction results by applying the breath as an external force of VR contents, games, and animations."
https://openalex.org/W3094671423,"Pathogen-host interactions are important components of epidemiological research, but are scarcely investigated in chelonians. Red-eared sliders (Trachemys scripta elegans), are recognized as a model for frog virus-3 infection (FV3), a ranavirus in the family Iridoviridae that infects multiple classes of ectothermic vertebrates. Previous challenge studies observed differences in disease outcome based on environmental temperature in this species, but the host response was minimally evaluated. We challenged red-eared sliders with an FV3-like ranavirus at both 28°C and 22°C. We monitored several host response variables for 30 days, including: survival (binary outcome and duration), clinical signs, total and differential leukocytes, and select cytokine transcription in the buffy coat (IL-1β, TNFα, IFYg, IL-10). After 30 days, 17% of challenged turtles survived at 28°C (Median survival time [MST]: 15 days, range: 10–30 days) and 50% survived (MST: 28.5 days, range: 23–30 days) at 22°C (range 23–30 days). The most common clinical signs were injection site swelling, palpebral swelling, and lethargy. The heterophil/lymphocyte ratio at 22°C and interleukin-1 beta (IL1β) transcription at both 22°C and 28°C were significantly greater on days 9, 16, and 23 in FV3 challenged groups. Tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-10 were transcribed at detectable levels, but did not display significant differences in mean relative transcription quantity over time. Overall, evidence indicates an over-robust immune response leading to death in the challenged turtles. FV3 remains a risk for captive and free-ranging chelonian populations, and insight to host/pathogen interaction through this model helps to elucidate the timing and intensity of the host response that contribute to mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3095565601,"Objective To evaluate the convergent validity of the six-minute stepper test (6MST) with the variables used in the diagnosis of sarcopenia (appendicular muscle mass, handgrip strength and six-meter gait speed test), as well as to evaluate test-retest reliability and safety when applied to hospitalized elderly patients. Finally, we aimed to compare the performance in the 6MST between hospitalized elderly patients and healthy elderly from the community. Materials and methods Observational and cross-sectional study. Elderly patients admitted to a private hospital and healthy elderly from the community were recruited. On the first day, the patients included underwent the following assessments: anthropometric, handgrip strength (HGS), six-meter gait speed test (6GST) and 6MST. On the second day, before breakfast, patients underwent body composition assessment. The healthy elderly were evaluated on a single day and performed only anthropometric assessment and 6MST. Results 30 hospitalized patients (age 71.0±7.9 years) and 15 healthy elderly (age 68.1±5.8 years) were included. There was a high correlation of 6MST with 6GST (r = 0.78; p<0.001), moderate correlation with HGS (r = 0.59; p<0.001) and low correlation with appendicular muscle mass (r = 0.45; p = 0.01). There was no statistical difference between the first and second 6MST performed by hospitalized elderly (196.2±91.0 cycles vs. 191.3±103.7 cycles; p = 0.66), in addition to an excellent agreement between these measures (ICC = 0.90; 95% IC 0.78–0.95). Only one adverse event (3.3%) occurred in the sample. Conclusion 6MST showed convergent validity with the functional variables used in the diagnosis of sarcopenia. In addition, excellent test-retest reliability was observed, which indicates the need for a single assessment in hospitalized elderly patients. The prevalence of adverse events during the application of the test is low, without resulting in clinical symptoms; therefore, the test is considered safe for this population. In addition, hospitalized elderly patients perform worse in the 6MST compared to healthy elderly from the community."

However, this parasite has recently been found to be distributed worldwide in various other avian species. This parasitic disease is common in captive falcons in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East. This study aimed to examine and identify the genetic variation of T. gallinae obtained from three species of falcons in Saudi Arabia via the sequencing analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. Swab samples from 97 saker falcons (Falco cherrug), 24 peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus) and 37 gyrfalcons (Falco rusticolus) were cultured and analysed for infection between 2018 and 2019. The overall prevalence of infection by T. gallinae was 26.58% (n = 42), of which 35 (83.33%) were collected from Riyadh region and seven (16.67%) were collected from Qassim region. The results indicate the presence of four genotypes of T. gallinae in Saudi falcons: A, C, II, and KSA11.

https://openalex.org/W3096120286,"Objective The role of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in acute heart failure is unknown. We recently showed that interleukin 8, a putative NETs stimulator, was associated with myocardial recovery in acute heart failure complicating ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). In this exploratory post-hoc study, we aimed to investigate the role of NETs components in relation to myocardial function and interleukin 8 in STEMI patients with symptomatic acute heart failure. Methods In 61 STEMI patients developing acute heart failure within 48 hours of successful revascularization, wall motion score index (WMSI), global longitudinal strain (GLS) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were assessed by echocardiography at baseline and on day 5. Blood drawn at baseline and days 1, 2 and 5 was used to quantify double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes (MPO-DNA) and citrullinated histone 3 (CitH3). The area under the curve (AUC) of each NETs marker and interleukin 8 was approximated for the first 5 days. Results dsDNAAUC and MPO-DNAAUC correlated significantly with change in WMSI from baseline to day 5 (rs = 0.28 for both, p≤0.05), whereas NETs AUCs did not correlate with changes in GLS and LVEF. dsDNAAUC was significantly correlated with interleukin 8AUC (r = 0.40, p = 0.003). However, mixed model regression could not identify a significant effect of the NETs components on myocardial function parameters. Conclusions In this cohort with acute heart failure complicating STEMI, NETs components were partly correlated with myocardial function and interleukin 8 levels, yet no causal relationship between NETs components and myocardial recovery could be established.

We analyzed antiretroviral (ARV) drug use and HIV drug resistance among HIV-positive FSW in the Dominican Republic and Tanzania. Methods Plasma samples collected at study entry with viral loads >1,000 copies/mL were tested for ARV drugs and HIV drug resistance. ARV drug testing was performed using a qualitative assay that detects 22 ARV drugs in five classes. HIV genotyping was performed using the ViroSeq HIV-1 Genotyping System. Phylogenetic analyses were performed to determine HIV subtype and assess transmission clusters. Results Among 410 FSW, 144 (35.1%) had viral loads >1,000 copies/mL (DR: n = 50; Tanzania: n = 94). ARV drugs were detected in 36 (25.0%) of 144 samples. HIV genotyping results were obtained for 138 (95.8%) cases. No transmission clusters were observed in either country. HIV drug resistance was detected in 54 (39.1%) of 138 samples (31/35 [88.6%] with drugs detected; 23/103 [22.3%] without drugs detected); 29/138 (21.0%) had multi-class resistance (MCR). None with MCR had integrase strand transfer inhibitor resistance. In eight cases, one or more ARV drug was detected without corresponding resistance mutations; those women were at risk of acquiring additional drug resistance. Using multivariate logistic regression, resistance was associated with ARV drug detection (p<0.001), self-reported ART (full adherence [p = 0.034]; partial adherence [p<0.001]), and duration of HIV infection (p = 0.013). Conclusions In this cohort, many women were on ART, but were not virally suppressed. High levels of HIV drug resistance, including MCR, were observed. Resistance was associated with detection of ARV drugs, self-report of ART with full or partial adherence, and duration of HIV infection. These findings highlight the need for better HIV care among FSW to improve their health, reduce HIV drug resistance, and decrease risk of transmission to others."
https://openalex.org/W3094882840,"Here we present a discrete-time-evolution model with one day interval to forecast the propagation of Covid-19. The proposed model can be easily implemented with daily updated data sets of the pandemic publicly available by distinct online sources. It has only two adjustable parameters and it predicts the evolution of the total number of infected people in a country for the next 14 days if parameters do not change during the analyzed period. The model incorporates the main aspects of the disease such as the fact that there are asymptomatic and symptomatic phases (both capable of propagating the virus), and that these phases take almost two weeks before the infected person status evolves to the next (asymptomatic becomes symptomatic or symptomatic becomes either recovered or dead). A striking advantage of the model for its implementation by the health sector is that it gives directly the number of total infected people in each day (in thousands, tens of thousands or hundred of thousands). Here, the model is tested with data from Brazil, UK and South Korea, presenting low error rates on the prediction of the evolution of the disease in all analyzed countries. We hope this model may be a useful tool to estimate the propagation of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W3097908020,"The response of netizens toward controversial events plays an important guiding role in the development of events. Based on the identification of such responses, this study aimed to determine the critical outbreak time window of events. The microblog texts related to an event were divided into seven emotional categories via multi-emotional analysis to capture the subtle emotions of netizens toward an event, i.e., public opinion. By detecting the characteristics of the text and regional coverage of emotions, an emotional coverage index that reflects the intensity of emotional impact was proposed to determine the mainstream emotion of netizens. By capturing the mutation characteristics of the impact intensity of mainstream emotions, the critical time window of the public opinion toward the event was obtained. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method can effectively identify the critical outbreak time window of controversial events, which can help authorities in preventing the further aggravation of events."
https://openalex.org/W3094730799,"Background Respiratory pathogens including Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, are implicated in the pathogenicity of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI). These are also commonly found in both healthy and sick children. In this study, we describe the first data on the most frequent bacteria and viruses detected in the nasopharynx of children from the general population in the Eastern DR Congo. Methods From January 2014 to June 2015, nasopharyngeal samples from 375 children aged from 2 to 60 months attending health centres for immunisation or growth monitoring were included in the study. Multiplex real-time PCR assays were used for detection of 15 different viruses and 5 bacterial species and for determination of pneumococcal serotypes/serogroups in the nasopharyngeal secretions. Results High levels of S. pneumoniae were detected in 77% of cases, and H. influenzae in 51%. Rhinovirus and enterovirus were the most commonly found viruses, while respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was rare (1%). Co-occurrence of both bacteria and viruses at high levels was detected in 33% of the children. The pneumococcal load was higher in those children who lived in a dwelling with an indoor kitchen area with an open fire, i.e. a kitchen with an open fire for cooking located inside the dwelling with the resultant smoke passing to the living room and/or bedrooms; this was also higher in children from rural areas as compared to children from urban areas or children not living in a dwelling with an indoor kitchen area with an open fire/not living in this type of dwelling. Immunization with 2-3 doses of PCV13 was associated with lower rates of pneumococcal detection. Half of the identified serotypes were non-PCV13 serotypes. The most common non-PCV13 serotypes/serogroups were 15BC, 10A, and 12F, while 5, 6, and 19F were the most prevalent PCV13 serotypes/serogroups. Conclusions The burden of respiratory pathogens including S. pneumoniae in Congolese children was high but relatively few children had RSV. Non-PCV13 serotypes/serogroups became predominant soon after PCV13 was introduced in DR Congo."
https://openalex.org/W3095017770,"OBJECTIVE To report the clinical and MRI-based volumetric mid-term outcome after image guided percutaneous sclerotherapy (PS) of venous malformations (VM) of the head and neck. METHODS A retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database was performed, including patients with VM of the head and neck who were treated with PS. Only patients with available pre- and post-interventional MRI were included into this study. Clinical outcome, which was subjectively assessed by the patients, their parents (for paediatric patients) and/or the physicians, was categorized as worse, unchanged, minor or major improvement. Radiological outcome, determined by MRI-based volumetric measurements, was categorized as worse (>10% increase), unchanged (≤10% increase to <10% decrease), minor (≥10% to <25% decrease), intermediate (≥25% to <50% decrease) or major improvement (≥50% decrease). RESULTS Twenty-seven patients were treated in 51 treatment sessions. After a mean follow-up of 31 months, clinical outcome was worse for 7.4%, unchanged for 3.7% of the patients, while there was minor and major improvement for 7.4% and 81.5%, respectively. In the volumetric imaging analysis 7.4% of the VMs were worse and 14.8% were unchanged. Minor improvement was observed in 22.2%, intermediate improvement in 44.4% and major improvement in 11.1%. The rate of permanent complications was 3.7%. CONCLUSION PS can be an effective therapy to treat the symptoms of patients with VMs of the head and neck and to downsize the VMs. MRI-based volumetry can be used to objectively follow the change in size of the VMs after PS. Relief of symptoms frequently does not require substantial volume reduction."
https://openalex.org/W3096122048,"The Illinois Agility Test (IAT) is a standard agility course used to assess and train able-bodied athletes as well as wheelchair-sport athletes and rehabilitation of wheelchair users. It has been shown to be a reliable and valid tool to assess the able-bodied population, but the reliability of this test for assessing wheelchair propulsion has never been shown. The purpose of this study is to investigate the test-retest reliability of IAT to assess wheelchair propulsion. In this paper, the test-retest reliability of using IAT for wheelchair users is found for peak and average velocity, acceleration, tangential and total force of the push, each for the left and the right wheel. Each of these variables was found for thirty-two decisive points throughout the IAT path. The Intra-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) was found to be very strong for 15 out of 16 variables. The average ICC was 89% and the average 95% confidence interval was [44% 96%]. In addition, thirty-seven other significant propulsion parameters were found that are clinically important, such as the number of pushes participants take to go around cones on the right, relative to turning around the cones on the left. Also, all thirty-seven variables were compared between the two sessions using four separate MANOVAs; the results showed no significant difference between IAT performed in the two sessions which were at least one week apart. This, in turn, backs the reliability of IAT for wheelchair users. These results are sufficient evidence to show that IAT is a reliable tool to test wheelchair agility for fifteen variables tested for non-wheelchair users. Since experienced wheelchair users are much more consistent in wheelchair propulsion compared to non-wheelchair-users, the results of this study show that IAT can be used as a reliable tool to assess and train wheelchair users, both for clinical and athletic applications."
https://openalex.org/W3097267967,"Introduction In patient-doctor interaction both parties play a role. Primary objective was to determine if the concordance among rheumatologists and their patients of their ideal of autonomy was associated with a better patient-doctor relationship. Secondary objective was to describe factors associated to a patient paternalistic ideal of autonomy (PPIA). Materials and methods This cross-sectional study had 3 steps. Step-1 consisted in translation/cultural local adaption of Ideal Patient Autonomy Scale (IPAS), a 14-items Dutch questionnaire. Step-2 consisted of IPAS validity and reliability in 201 outpatients. Step-3 consisted of the application of IPAS and the patient-doctor relationship questionnaire (PDRQ) to 601 outpatients with a medical encounter, and of IPAS to the 21 attending rheumatologists. Each patient-physician encounter was classified into with/without concordance in the ideal of autonomy and PRDQ scores were compared (Man Whitney U test). Regression analysis was used for associations. Results Step-1 followed ISPOR task force recommendations. Patients from Step-2 and Step-3 were representative outpatients with rheumatic diseases. IPAS structure underwent a modification; the 14 items were redistributed into four subscales, further combined into PPIA vs. patient-centered autonomy ideal. IPAS was valid and reliable. There were 497 patients with a preferred ideal of autonomy, primarily (84.9%) PPIA. There were 363 patient-doctor encounters with concordance in the autonomy ideal and their PDRQ-9 scores were higher. Religious beliefs and higher PDRQ-9 item 8 score (“I feel pleased with my doctor´s treatment”) were associated to a PPIA. Conclusions Concordance of autonomy ideal among patients and their rheumatologists positively impacts on the patient-doctor relationship."
https://openalex.org/W3097382196,"Time series of individual subjects have become a common data type in psychological research. The Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model, which predicts each variable by all variables including itself at previous time points, has become a popular modeling choice for these data. However, the number of observations in typical psychological applications is often small, which puts the reliability of VAR coefficients into question. In such situations it is possible that the simpler AR model, which only predicts each variable by itself at previous time points, is more appropriate. Bulteel et al. (2018) used empirical data to investigate in which situations the AR or VAR models are more appropriate and suggest a rule to choose between the two models in practice. We provide an extended analysis of these issues using a simulation study. This allows us to (1) directly investigate the relative performance of AR and VAR models in typical psychological applications, (2) show how the relative performance depends both on n and characteristics of the true model, (3) quantify the uncertainty in selecting between the two models, and (4) assess the relative performance of different model selection strategies. We thereby provide a more complete picture for applied researchers about when the VAR model is appropriate in typical psychological applications, and how to select between AR and VAR models in practice."
https://openalex.org/W3095304790,"The paradox between idle homesteads in rural areas and the shortage of construction land in urban areas is concerning. Hence, local governments encourage farmers to reclaim their idle homesteads and farmlands to generate quota. However, the current quota price, which is based on the land reclamation cost, is often inadequate to motivate farmers. This study proposed that the construction land quota and construction land are complementary items, and hence, their pricing should be studied simultaneously instead of independently. Therefore, the classical sequential auction model with complementarity was improved using the core characteristics of quota transactions and those were applied to design optimal pricing mechanisms. Subsequently, the influence of relevant factors on the bidding price was analysed. The results indicated that the bidding price decreases with an increase in the number of bidders and that a bidder’s revenue is at a loss when they acquire the quota but fail to obtain the land; hence, the revenue probability is lost. However, bidding prices increase when the fine of delaying construction increases. To raise the quota price and encourage relatively more farmers to reclaim their idle homesteads, local governments should appropriately increase the delaying construction fines or repurchase the quota at a premium from the bidder who acquires the quota but fails to obtain the land, which is beneficial for easing conflict between construction land demands and farmland protection and for promoting the sustainable development of China’s social economy."

https://openalex.org/W3097770530,"A re-description of the freshwater, Early Cretaceous osteoglossomorph Laeliichthys ancestralis Santos, 1985, from the Sanfranciscana Basin of Brazil, is provided. New anatomical details and a revised diagnosis, as well as a new phylogeny are presented. A phylogenetic analysis places this taxon within the Osteoglossomorpha most likely as a member of the Notopteroidei. Within this clade Laeliichthys is the sister-taxon of the Notopteridae. The subfamily Laeliichthyinae is elevated to family rank. The revised phylogenetic position revealed in this study has important consequences on the biogeography of Notopteroidei as it extends their distribution to western Gondwana, prior to the separation of South America and Africa, and extends the evolutionary origins of notopteroid lineages by at least ~27 Myr before their first appearance in the fossil record."
