https://openalex.org/W2091403769,"The p27 mammalian cell cycle protein is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Both in vivo and in vitro, p27 was found to be degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The human ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes Ubc2 and Ubc3 were specifically involved in the ubiquitination of p27. Compared with proliferating cells, quiescent cells exhibited a smaller amount of p27 ubiquitinating activity, which accounted for the marked increase of p27 half-life measured in these cells. Thus, the abundance of p27 in cells is regulated by degradation. The specific proteolysis of p27 may represent a mechanism for regulating the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases."

Analysis of a clinically isolated tox- strain (Tx30a) indicated secretion of a 93-kDa product from a 3933-base pair vacA open reading frame. Characterization of 59 different H. pylori isolates indicated the existence of three different families of vacA signal sequences (s1a, s1b, and s2) and two different families of middle-region alleles (m1 and m2). All possible combinations of these vacA regions were identified, with the exception of s2/m1 (p"

Msh2-deficient cells have lost mismatch binding and have acquired microsatellite instability, a mutator phenotype, and tolerance to methylating agents. Moreover, in these cells, homologous recombination has lost dependence on complete identity between interacting DNA sequences, suggesting that Msh2 is involved in safeguarding the genome from promiscuous recombination. Msh2-deficient mice display no major abnormalities, but a significant fraction develops lymphomas at an early age. Thus, Msh2 is involved in MMR, controlling several aspects of genome stability; loss of MMR-controlled genome stability predisposes to cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1994957003,"Phosphoinositide-3 kinase activity is implicated in diverse cellular responses triggered by mammalian cell surface receptors and in the regulation of protein sorting in yeast. Receptors with intrinsic and associated tyrosine kinase activity recruit heterodimeric phosphoinositide-3 kinases that consist of p110 catalytic subunits and p85 adaptor molecules containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains. A phosphoinositide-3 kinase isotype, p110 gamma, was cloned and characterized. The p110 gamma enzyme was activated in vitro by both the alpha and beta gamma subunits of heterotrimeric guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins (G proteins) and did not interact with p85. A potential pleckstrin homology domain is located near its amino terminus. The p110 gamma isotype may link signaling through G protein-coupled receptors to the generation of phosphoinositide second messengers phosphorylated in the D-3 position."
https://openalex.org/W2000605935,"Eukaryotic DNA polymerase beta (pol beta) can catalyze DNA synthesis during base excision DNA repair. It is shown here that pol beta also catalyzes release of 5'-terminal deoxyribose phosphate (dRP) residues from incised apurinic-apyrimidinic sites, which are common intermediate products in base excision repair. The catalytic domain for this activity resides within an amino-terminal 8-kilodalton fragment of pol beta, which comprises a distinct structural domain of the enzyme. Magnesium is required for the release of dRP from double-stranded DNA but not from a single-stranded oligonucleotide. Analysis of the released products indicates that the excision reaction occurs by beta-elimination rather than hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2075240053,"Using gene targeting in embryonic stem cells, we have derived mice with a null mutation in a DNA mismatch repair gene homolog, PMS2. We observed microsatellite instability in the male germline, in tail, and in tumor DNA of PMS2-deficient animals. We therefore conclude that PMS2 is involved in DNA mismatch repair in a variety of tissues. PMS2-deficient animals appear prone to sarcomas and lymphomas. PMS2-deficient males are infertile, producing only abnormal spermatozoa. Analysis of axial element and synaptonemal complex formation during prophase of meiosis I indicates abnormalities in chromosome synapsis. These observations suggest links among mismatch repair, genetic recombination, and chromosome synapsis in meiosis."

Because of the many parallels in the function of these biochemically based genetic circuits and electrical circuits, a hybrid modeling approach is proposed that integrates conventional biochemical kinetic modeling within the framework of a circuit simulation. The circuit diagram of the bacteriophage lambda lysislysogeny decision circuit represents connectivity in signal paths of the biochemical components. A key feature of the lambda genetic circuit is that operons function as active integrated logic components and introduce signal time delays essential for the in vivo behavior of phage lambda."

Since phosphoinositide 3-kinase and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate have also been implicated in actin reorganization, we investigated the possibility that Rho family members interact with phosphoinositide kinases. We found that both GTP- and GDP-bound Rac1 associate with phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase in vitro and in vivo. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase also bound to Rac1 and Cdc42Hs, and these interactions were GTP-dependent. Stimulation of Swiss 3T3 cells with platelet-derived growth factor induced the association of PI 3-kinase with Rac in immunoprecipitates. PI 3-kinase activity was also detected in Cdc42 immunoprecipitates from COS7 cells. These results suggest that phosphoinositide kinases are involved in Rho family signal transduction pathways and raise the possibility that the effects of Rho family members on the actin cytoskeleton are mediated in part by phosphoinositide kinases.

https://openalex.org/W2151915336,"Receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase beta (RPTP beta) is expressed in the developing nervous system and contains a carbonic anhydrase (CAH) domain as well as a fibronectin type III repeat in its extracellular domain. Fusion proteins containing these domains were used to search for ligands of RPTP beta. The CAH domain bound specifically to a 140 kDa protein expressed on the surface of neuronal cells. Expression cloning in COS7 cells revealed that this protein is contactin, a GPI membrane-anchored neuronal cell recognition molecule. The CAH domain of RPTP beta induced cell adhesion and neurite growth of primary tectal neurons, and differentiation of neuroblastoma cells. These responses were blocked by antibodies against contactin, demonstrating that contactin is a neuronal receptor for RPTP beta. These experiments show that an individual domain of RPTP beta acts as a functional ligand for the neuronal receptor contactin. The interaction between contactin and RPTP beta may generate unidirectional or bidirectional signals during neural development."

However, mutations in En-1 and En-2 produce different phenotypes. En-1 mutant mice die at birth with a large mid-hindbrain deletion, whereas En-2 mutants are viable, with cerebellar defects. To determine whether these contrasting phenotypes reflect differences in temporal expression or biochemical activity of the En proteins, En-1 coding sequences were replaced with En-2 sequences by gene targeting. This rescued all En-1 mutant defects, demonstrating that the difference between En-1 and En-2 stems from their divergent expression patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2020610229,"The crystal structure of restriction endonuclease Bam HI complexed to DNA has been determined at 2.2 angstrom resolution. The DNA binds in the cleft and retains a B-DNA type of conformation. The enzyme, however, undergoes a series of conformational changes, including rotation of subunits and folding of disordered regions. The most striking conformational change is the unraveling of carboxyl-terminal alpha helices to form partially disordered ""arms."" The arm from one subunit fits into the minor groove while the arm from the symmetry related subunit follows the DNA sugar-phosphate backbone. Recognition of DNA base pairs occurs primarily in the major groove, with a few interactions occurring in the minor groove. Tightly bound water molecules play an equally important role as side chain and main chain atoms in the recognition of base pairs. The complex also provides new insights into the mechanism by which the enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of DNA phosphodiester groups."
https://openalex.org/W2164282000,"We have analyzed early phases of the cotranslational transport of the secretory protein preprolactin through the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Following recognition of the signal sequence of the nascent polypeptide chain in the cytosol by the SRP, the chain is transferred into the membrane, where a second signal sequence recognition step takes place for which the presence in the lipid bilayer of the Sec61p complex is essential and sufficient. This step leads to a tight junction between the ribosomenascent chain complex and the Sec61p complex, and to the productive insertion of the nascent chain into the translocation site. These results show that a translocation substrate is subjected to two recognition events before being allowed to cross the ER membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2021047790,"All-trans-retinoic acid (RA) activates ligand-dependent transcription factors that regulate retinoid-responsive gene expression. It is assumed that all-trans-RA is formed within cells through in situ oxidation of retinol derived from the circulation. However, the circulation contains low levels of all-trans-RA (approximately 0.2-0.7% of that of plasma retinol). Our studies investigated the extent to which plasma all-trans-RA contributes to tissue pools of this retinoid and explored factors responsible for regulating its uptake by tissues and cells. Rats were continuously infused, to steady state, with all-trans-[3H]RA. From measures of specific activities of all-trans-[3H]RA at steady state, we determined that the preponderance of all-trans-RA in brain and liver was derived from the circulation. For six other tissues, approximately 10-30% of the retinoid was derived from the circulation, but pancreas and testis derived very little from the circulating pool. In other studies, we showed that retinoid nutritional status influences clearance of a bolus dose of all-trans-RA and that neither the rate of cellular all-trans-RA uptake nor its intracellular half-life is influenced by cellular lipid levels.

Retinoids (vitamin A) are essential for vision, reproduction, growth and differentiation, and maintenance of the general health of the organism(1Moore T. Vitamin A.

Retinoic acid and possibly some of its metabolites are the active retinoid forms responsible for mediating most of the nonvisual functions of this class of compounds. Both 9-cis- and all-trans-retinoic acid interact in the nucleus with ligand-dependent transcription factors to regulate expression of retinoid-responsive genes(4Mangelsdorf D.M. Umesono K. Evans R.M.

Ultimately, all retinoids in the body are derived from the diet. The bulk of dietary retinoid, consumed as either preformed vitamin A or provitamin A (carotenoids), is taken up in the intestine and packaged as retinyl ester, along with other dietary lipids, in chylomicrons (6Goodman D.S. Blaner W.S. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1984: 1-41Google Scholar, 7Blaner W.S. Olson J.A. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S.

The majority of this retinyl ester is delivered to the liver (6Goodman D.S. Blaner W.S. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1984: 1-41Google Scholar, 7Blaner W.S. Olson J.A. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids, Biology, Chemistry, and Medicine. 2nd Ed.

A small portion of the dietary retinyl ester in chylomicrons is taken up by some extrahepatic tissues, particularly bone marrow, kidney, and adipose tissue, where the retinyl ester may serve as a source of retinoid for meeting tissue needs(7Blaner W.S. Olson J.A. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids, Biology, Chemistry, and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 283-318Google Scholar). Within the liver, the newly arrived dietary retinoid is either stored as retinyl ester in hepatic stellate cells or secreted into the circulation as retinol bound to its specific plasma transport protein, retinol-binding protein (RBP)(7Blaner W.S. Olson J.A. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids, Biology, Chemistry, and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 283-318Google Scholar, 9Soprano D.R. Blaner W.S. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids, Biology, Chemistry, and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 257-282Google Scholar). It is generally thought that tissue retinoid needs are satisfied primarily through the delivery of retinol to cells via RBP. Plasma retinol is internalized by cells from RBP through a process involving the action of CRBP(9Soprano D.R. Blaner W.S. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids, Biology, Chemistry, and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 257-282Google Scholar, 10Noy N. Blaner W.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6380-6386Google Scholar). Within the cell, the retinol can be oxidized to retinoic acid through enzymatic processes (7Blaner W.S. Olson J.A. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids, Biology, Chemistry, and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 283-318Google Scholar) which have also been proposed to involve CRBP(11Posch K.C. Boerman M.H.E.M. Burns R.D. Napoli J.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6224-6230Google Scholar, 12Smith J.E. Milch P.O. Muto Y. Goodman D.S. Biochem. J. 1973; 132: 821-827Google Scholar). In addition to the transport process described above, other pathways for the delivery of retinoid to tissues may operate within the body. A small fraction of dietary retinoid is converted to retinoic acid in the intestine (or may arrive as such in the diet) and is absorbed via the portal system as retinoic acid bound to albumin(7Blaner W.S. Olson J.A. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids, Biology, Chemistry, and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 283-318Google Scholar, 8Blomhoff R. Green M.H. Berg T. Norum K.R.

In plasma, retinoic acid circulates bound to albumin(12Smith J.E. Milch P.O. Muto Y. Goodman D.S. Biochem. J. 1973; 132: 821-827Google Scholar). The fasting plasma level of all-trans-retinoic acid is very low, being in the range of 4-14 nmol/liter in humans (about 0.2-0.7% of plasma retinol levels) (13De Leenheer A.P. Lambert W.E. Claeys I. J. Lipid Res. 1982; 23: 1362-1367Google Scholar, 14Eckhoff C. Nau H. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1445-1454Google Scholar) and 7.3-9 nmol/liter in rats(15Cullum M.E. Zile M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10590-10596Google Scholar, 16Napoli J.L. Pramanik B.C. Williams J.B. Dawson M.I. Hobbs P.D. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 387-392Google Scholar). It is presently not clear to what extent plasma retinoic acid contributes to tissue pools of this retinoid. Our studies reported below address this question. In addition, they explore whether retinoic acid accumulation by tissues from plasma is specific and regulated in response to physiologic state and whether the lipid content of a cell influences either the rate of uptake or half-life of retinoic acid within a cell. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) ranging in weight from 400 to 500 g and maintained on a commercial chow diet (Ralston Purina Inc., St. Louis, MO), without any source of carotenoid, were employed for all of our studies. Rats were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine and xylazine prior to jugular vein cannulation. Polyethylene catheters were inserted into both the right and left jugular veins and externalized by routing through subcutaneous dorsal tunnels(17Makover A. Moriwaki H. Ramakrishnan R. Saraiva M.J.M. Blaner W.S. Goodman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8598-8603Google Scholar). The catheters were fixed with dental cement to the cranial area, and the lines were filled with either 200 units of sodium heparin in saline or a mixture of 50 units of sodium heparin and 40% polyvinylpyrrolidone in saline to ensure that they remained patent. The catheterized rats awoke within 1-3 h after surgery and were allowed to recover for at least 1 day prior to the start of the experiments. Animals were allowed free access to water and chow throughout the studies. To study the contribution of plasma retinoic acid to tissue retinoic acid pools, physiologic doses of all-trans-[3H]retinoic acid (50.6 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) were infused continuously into control animals. The retinoic acid dose consisted of 1-1.5 μCi of all-trans-[3H]retinoic acid dispersed in 1.0 ml of 1% fatty acid-free rat albumin (the physiologic carrier of retinoic acid in the circulation) (12Smith J.E. Milch P.O. Muto Y. Goodman D.S. Biochem. J. 1973; 132: 821-827Google Scholar) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 10 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM sodium chloride, pH 7.2). The infusate was pumped through one jugular cannula at a flow rate of 0.78 ml/h. The infusion rate was chosen, based on preliminary studies, to provide measurable radioactivity in tissues without significantly perturbing the plasma retinoic acid pool. Three to five serial blood samples (each of approximately 0.5 ml) were taken from the second jugular cannula at 1-h intervals to establish that the plasma all-trans-[3H]retinoic acid levels had reached a steady state. Immediately following the final sampling and usually 5 h after the start of infusion, the animals were sacrificed with a mixture of ketamine and xylazine, and tissues (brain, liver, kidney, epididymal fat, perinephric fat, seminal vesicle, epididymis, pancreas, and testis) were quickly perfused with ice-cold PBS and excised for HPLC analysis of retinoic acid levels. Urine was collected throughout the infusion period so that the hydration status of the animal could be monitored. For some studies, rats were given a bolus injection of a dose consisting of 5 μCi of all-trans-[3H]retinoic acid (50.6 Ci/mmol) and 0.5 μCi of [14C]oleic acid (55.5 mCi/mmol) in 1.0 ml of 1% fatty acid-free rat albumin in PBS through one jugular cannula. Between 1.5 and 10 min after injection, three to five serial blood samples (each of approximately 0.5 ml) were taken from the second jugular cannula for analysis of [3H]retinoic acid and [14C]oleic acid remaining in the circulation. At 10 min, the injected animals were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine; the whole body was perfused with ice-cold PBS; and brain, liver, kidney, epididymal fat, perinephric fat, seminal vesicles, epididymis, pancreas, and testis were taken for extraction and analysis of tissue levels of [3H]retinoic acid and [14C]oleic acid as described in the section below. In preliminary experiments developing and characterizing the methodologies used for our studies, it quickly became obvious that plasma retinoic acid was being taken up by most tissues and was very rapidly being metabolized. We observed that after the stoppage of the circulation of a perfused rat (i.e. upon sacrifice) the metabolism of retinoic acid by tissues continued. Thus, a critical point in the design of these experiments was to allow very little time to elapse between the stoppage of circulation and the dissection of tissues. This ensured that our measures provided accurate estimations of the contribution which plasma retinoic acid makes to tissue pools. With this in mind and as part of our experimental design, we limited the maximum period of time between stoppage of the circulation and flash freezing of the final dissected tissue to 5 min. Only approximately 10 tissues could be dissected and processed (weighed and frozen) in 5 min. Because of this experimental limitation, we chose to study only the 10 tissues listed above. All extraction and analytical procedures were carried out in a darkened room using brown glass tubes to protect the retinoids from exposure to light. Plasma samples were diluted with equal volumes of PBS prior to extraction. Tissues were homogenized in PBS (2 ml of PBS/g of tissue) using three 15-s pulses of a Brinkmann Polytron PT 300 homogenizer (Brinkmann Instruments), at setting 5 on the homogenizer. An internal standard consisting of a known amount of all-trans-7-(1,1,3,3,-tetramethyl-5-indanyl)-3-methyl-octa-2,4,6-trienoic acid (kindly provided by Dr. A. Levin, Hoffmann-LaRoche, Inc., Nutley NJ) was added in 0.1 ml of ethanol to each plasma or tissue sample in order to monitor the recovery of retinoic acid during the extraction and HPLC procedures(18Napoli J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 123: 112-124Google Scholar). Retinoic acid was extracted from the tissue homogenates and plasma using a modification of the procedure described by Tang and Russell(19Tang G. Russell R.M. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 30: 175-182Google Scholar, 20Tang G. Russell R.M. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1991; 2: 2100-2213Google Scholar). This extraction procedure is quite gentle and does not cause retinoyl-β-glucuronide hydrolysis. Briefly, plasma and tissue homogenates (3 ml) were extracted twice with chloroform/methanol (2:1), and the chloroform extracts were combined and concentrated, under a gentle stream of N2, to a final volume of less than 1 ml. This retinoid-containing chloroform extract was then applied to 100 or 500 mg aminopropyl solid phase extraction columns (Baxter Labs. Inc., Chicago) that had previously been equilibrated with hexane. Under these chromatographic conditions, most lipids are retained by the column. The neutral lipids were eluted first from the column with 5 ml of chloroform/isopropanol (2:1). After the neutral lipids were eluted, the retinoic acid was eluted from the aminopropyl column with 5 ml of 2% acetic acid in diethyl ether containing 0.01% butylated hydroxytoulene as an antioxidant. The acetic acid/diethyl ether eluates were collected, evaporated to dryness under a gentle stream of N2, and redissolved in HPLC mobile phase (hexane/acetonitrile/acetic acid, 99.5:0.4:0.1) for injection onto the HPLC. All-trans-retinoic acid levels were determined by normal phase HPLC employing two silica columns linked in tandem. The silica columns consisted of a 3.9 × 150-mm Waters 5 μ Resolve (Waters Associates, Milford, MA) followed by a 4.6 × 150-mm 3 μ Supelcosil LC-Si (Supelco Inc., Bellefonte, PA). The first column was preceded by a Waters silica Guard-PAK guard column. For chromatography, we employed an isocratic system where the mobile phase consisted of hexane/acetonitrile/acetic acid (99.5:0.4:0.1) flowing at 1.8 ml/min. The mobile phase was made fresh daily and filtered and degassed immediately prior to use. The solvent was delivered by a Varian Star 9010 pump (Varian Instruments, Sugarland, TX). We routinely injected 90 μl of sample onto the columns using a Varian Star 9095 Autosampler. Retinoic acid mass was detected at 350 nm using a Spectra-Physics Spectra 100 variable wavelength detector (Spectra Physics Inc., Piscataway, NJ). All-trans-retinoic acid levels were quantitated from the integrated area under its peak using a standard curve, constructed with authentic standards of all-trans-retinoic acid of known mass. All-trans-[3H]retinoic acid was detected and quantitated with an in-line Berthold LB506C-1 radioactivity monitor (EG& Berthold, Nashua, NH). This normal phase system was selected because it allowed for maximal detection of 3H counts/min compared to other normal phase and reverse phase HPLC systems, where more quenching of radioactivity was observed. For standards, authentic all-trans- and 9-cis-retinoic acid were obtained as a kind gift of Dr. Art Levin (Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc., Nutley, NJ) and authentic 13-cis-retinoic acid was obtained from Sigma. Low limits of detections for all-trans-, 13-cis-, and 9-cis-retinoic acid in our HPLC assay were estimated to be respectively, 0.7, 1.0, and 0.7 ng/g tissue. For some studies, rats were maintained for 10 weeks on one of two different nutritionally complete purified diets which supplied different levels of retinoid. The purified diets assessed were a nutritionally complete control diet which contained 2.4 μg of retinol/g of diet and a totally retinoid-deficient but otherwise complete diet. These diets and their use have been described in detail in the literature(21Blaner W.S. Smith J.E. Dell R.B. Goodman D.S. J. Nutr. 1985; 115: 856-864Google Scholar, 22Kato M. Blaner W.S. Mertz J.R. Das K. Kato K. Goodman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4832-4838Google Scholar). After 10 weeks on the diets, bolus infusion studies were carried out on these animals as described above. To determine whether lipid content of cells and tissues influences retinoic acid uptake and retention we investigated the ability of cultured preadipocytes and adipocytes to take up all-trans-retinoic acid from the culture medium. BFC-1β preadipocytes and adipocytes were cultured and maintained according to procedures we have previously described(23Tsutsumi C. Okuno M. Tannous L. Piantedosi R. Allan M. Goodman D.S. Blaner W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1805-1810Google Scholar, 24Zovich D.C. Orologa A. Okuno M. Wong Yen Kong L. Talmage D.A. Piantedosi R. Goodman D.S. Blaner W.S. J. Biol.

Preadipocytes were cultured in 75-cm2 plastic tissue culture flasks. For our studies of retinoic acid uptake and metabolism, the preadipocytes were used on the day they reached confluence. Similarly, BFC-1β adipocytes were cultured in 75-cm2 flasks and were used when greater than 75% of the cells present in the flask had undergone adipose conversion as evidenced by the presence of characteristic lipid droplets within the cells. Five μCi of all-trans-[3H]retinoic acid in 5 μl of ethanol were dispersed in 1.0 ml of fatty acid-free rat albumin in PBS, and 0.1 ml of the dispersion was added directly to 3 ml of the appropriate culture medium(23Tsutsumi C. Okuno M. Tannous L. Piantedosi R. Allan M. Goodman D.S. Blaner W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1805-1810Google Scholar, 24Zovich D.C. Orologa A. Okuno M. Wong Yen Kong L. Talmage D.A. Piantedosi R.

Chem. 1994; 269: 16559-16565Google Scholar). The final concentration of the all-trans-retinoic acid in the culture medium was 3 × 10-8M. After the labeled medium was provided to the cells, they were incubated at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 for periods of up to 6 h. After incubation, the medium was removed for analysis of retinoic acid. The cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and scraped from the plate into a small volume of PBS. The medium and cells were immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −70°C for up to 1 week prior to analysis for retinoic acid levels. Retinoic acid was extracted from the cells and medium and analyzed as described in the above sections. The half-life of all-trans-retinoic acid in preadipocytes and adipocytes was calculated from the slope obtained by regression analysis of a linear plot of total system (cells + medium) all-trans-retinoic acid levels and time (for times ranging from 1 through 6 h after addition of all-trans-retinoic acid to the medium). For these plots, at each time of analysis, cellular and medium all-trans-retinoic acid levels were determined in triplicate, and the average value was used for half-life calculation. The specific activity of [3H]retinoic acid present at steady state in each tissue (and plasma) was determined from individual measurements of radiolabeled retinoic acid (dpm/g of tissue) and retinoic acid mass (pmol or ng/g of tissue) carried out for each tissue. The purpose of the continuous infusion of all-trans-[3H]retinoic acid was to establish a steady state among the infused retinoic acid, plasma retinoic acid, and tissue retinoic acid pools. Since the pool of retinoic acid present within each tissue must be composed of the retinoic acid synthesized endogenously by the tissue from retinol oxidation (and possibly from retinoyl-β-glucuronide hydrolysis (26Barua A.B. Olson J.A. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 403-409Google Scholar) but not carotenoid cleavage, because the rats employed for our studies received no carotenoid in the diet) and the retinoic acid taken up from the circulation, the contribution that plasma retinoic acid makes to a tissue pool is simply the ratio of the specific activity of all-trans-[3H]retinoic acid present in the tissue to plasma all-trans-[3H]retinoic acid specific activity: %Plasmacontribution=TissueretinoicacidspecificactivityPlasmaretinoicacidspecificactivity×100%(Eq. 1) The fractional catabolic rate (FCR) in plasma pools per hour was determined from the following equation: FCR=[3[H]Retinoicacidinfusionrateindpm/hdpm[3H]Retinoicacid/mlplasma)×W×0.04(Eq. 2) where W is the weight of the rat in grams and rat plasma volume is assigned to be 0.04 ml/g total body weight(27Caster W.O. Poncelett J. Simon A.V. Armstrong W.D. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1956; 91: 122-126Google Scholar). The absolute catabolic rate (ACR) in ng/h was determined from the following equation: ACR=[3[H]Retinoicacidinfusionrateindpm/hplasmaRetinoicacid/specificactivity)indpm/ng(Eq. 3) Since we were concerned that residual plasma contamination of our perfused tissues might influence our calculations, we determined the amount of plasma contamination in the perfused tissues of four representative rats (which were different from those employed for retinoic acid continuous infusion). For this purpose, a bolus dose of 125I-RBP, prepared as described previously(28Blaner W.S. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 189: 270-281Google Scholar), was intravenously injected in PBS into the rats through a jugular vein catheter and allowed to circulate for 3-5 min. This time period is sufficiently short so that very little 125I-RBP would be expected to be taken up by cells within the rat tissues(29van Bennekum A.M. Blaner W.S. Seifert-Bock I. Moukides M. Brouwer A. Hendriks H.F.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1727-1733Google Scholar). The animals were then sacrificed, and tissues were perfused and excised as described above for the experimental animals. Levels of 125I in the tissues and plasma were measured directly using an LKB RIAGAMMA (LKB-Pharmacia Instruments, Piscataway, NJ). The maximum residual plasma contamination of each tissue was calculated assuming that the level of 125I measured in each tissue arose solely from the residual plasma present in the tissue. From these measurements, we determined that the residual plasma contamination for each tissue was both very small (<1% of the total 125I counts/min present in the circulation) and very reproducible for the four rats. Our calculations of the percent contribution which plasma retinoic acid makes to tissue pools were made both uncorrected and corrected for possible residual plasma content of the tissues. The two sets of calculated values were found to be very similar, and for no tissue were differences of greater than 5% observed. The data in this report are given without correcting for average residual plasma present in each tissue. For the bolus studies, only three to five samples could be obtained from each animal. Therefore, the data from all animals on the same diet had to be pooled. With this in mind, different sampling times were used for different animals so that, taken together, data were available at seven to eight distinct time points for each diet. The data were expressed as percent of injected dose and were fitted by a two-pool model to estimate plasma FCR(30Goldberg I.J. Blaner W.S. Vanni T.M. Moukides M. Ramakrishnan R. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 463-473Google Scholar). The tissue data were expressed as percent of injected dose per g of tissue at 10 min after injection. Retinoic acid and oleic acid levels were compared by paired t tests. In preliminary experiments with approximately 20 rats, we demonstrated that, for our experimental conditions, a steady state in plasma retinoic acid and tissue retinoic acid pools was established within 2.5 h after the start of continuous retinoic acid infusion. Repeated plasma samples (usually three or four) were taken over 6 h (for some animals this period ranged up to 24 h) after the start of infusion and plasma all-trans-[3H]retinoic acid specific activity was measured. When computer-determined slopes of plots of plasma retinoic acid specific activities for different animals were statistically analyzed, they were not found to be significantly different from zero, the slope of a horizontal line. Thus, when plasma all-trans-[3H]retinoic acid specific activity was plotted as a function of time, for times greater than 2.5 h, there was no consistent trend with time. We concluded from this analysis that a steady state was reached within 2.5 h after the start of infusion. This conclusion was also supported by measures of 3H counts/min levels in urine collected over defined time intervals which began 2.5 h after infusion started. Although none of the 3H counts/min present in the urine were present as retinoic acid, the total 3H counts/min determined in the timed urine samples were reproducibly found to be equal to the total all-trans-[3H]retinoic acid infused into the animal over the time interval of urine collection. The observation that the radioactivity infused into an experimental animal equals that being excreted by the animal would indicate that the whole body pool of retinoic acid is at isotopic steady state. These two observations, when taken together, fully support the conclusion that plasma and tissue retinoic acid pools are in a steady state condition within 2.5 h after the start of all-trans-[3H]retinoic acid infusion. This conclusion is further supported by our data which indicate that the fractional catabolic rate of plasma all-trans-retinoic acid is very large (see below). We employ"

We demonstrate that the epidermal growth factor-like domain of the LIN-3 protein can induce either of two distinct vulval cell fates: a high dose of LIN-3 induces a 1 degree fate; a lower dose of LIN-3 induces a 2 degrees fate. A high dose of LIN-3 can also induce adjacent vulval precursor cells to assume 1 degree fates; thus, high levels of LIN-3 can override the lateral signaling that normally inhibits formation of adjacent 1 degree fates. We propose that the invariant pattern of vulval cell fates is generated by a graded distribution of LIN-3 that promotes different vulval fates according to local concentration and by a lateral signal that reinforces this initial bias."
https://openalex.org/W2091473682,"Nitrogen regulation of transcription in Escherichia coli requires sensation of the intracellular nitrogen status and control of the dephosphorylation of the transcriptional activator NRI~P. This dephosphorylation is catalyzed by the bifunctional kinase/phosphatase NRII in the presence of the dissociable PII protein. The ability of PII to stimulate the phosphatase activity of NRII is regulated by a signal transducing uridylyltransferase/uridylyl-removing enzyme (UTase/UR), which converts PII to PII-UMP under conditions of nitrogen starvation; this modification prevents PII from stimulating the dephosphorylation of NRI~P. We used purified components to examine the binding of small molecules to PII, the effect of small molecules on the stimulation of the NRII phosphatase activity by PII, the retention of PII on immobilized NRII, and the regulation of the uridylylation of PII by the UTase/UR enzyme. Our results indicate that PII is activated upon binding ATP and either 2-ketoglutarate or glutamate, and that the liganded form of PII binds much better to immobilized NRII. We also demonstrate that the concentration of glutamine required to inhibit the uridylyltransferase activity is independent of the concentration of 2-ketoglutarate present. We hypothesize that nitrogen sensation in E. coli involves the separate measurement of glutamine by the UTase/UR protein and 2-ketoglutarate by the PII protein."

https://openalex.org/W2031435019,"Trypanosoma cruzi invades most nucleated mammalian cells by as yet unknown mechanisms. We report here that while T. cruzi attaches to epithelial cells lacking signaling transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) receptor I or II, the adherent parasites cannot penetrate and replicate inside the mutant cells, as they do in parental cells. Invasion of the mutants is restored by transfection with the TGF beta receptor genes, as are biological responses to TGF beta. Similar rescue of both TGF beta antiproliferative response and T. cruzi invasion was demonstrated in a hybrid of TGF beta-resistant bladder and colon carcinoma cells. In addition, T. cruzi did not efficiently invade epithelial cells with dysfunction of the intracellular signaling cascade caused by the constitutive expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase cdk4 or of the oncogene H-ras. Treatment with TGF beta, but not with other antiproliferative agents of non-phagocytic cells, greatly enhances T. cruzi invasion. Moreover, infective, but not noninfective, trypanosomes strongly induce a TGF beta-responsive reporter gene in TGF beta-sensitive, but not in TGF beta-insensitive, cell lines. Thus, T. cruzi itself may directly trigger activation of the TGF beta signaling pathway required for parasite entry into the mammalian cells."

In particular, the highly conserved central loop of domain V (residues 2043-2625(2Noller H.F. Kop J.A. Wheaton V. Brosius J. Gutell R.R. Kopylov A.M. Dohme F. Herr W. Stahl D.A. Gupta R. Woese C.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6167-6189Google Scholar, 3Noller H.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 119-162Google Scholar)) has been shown to be a fundamental component of the peptidyl transferase activity. The evidence is principally based on chemical footprinting experiments (4Noller H.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 191-227Google Scholar) and photoaffinity cross-linking studies (reviewed in (5Brimacombe R. Mitchell P. Osswald M. Stade K. Bochkariov D. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 161-167Google Scholar)) using components of the translational apparatus (e.g. tRNA, mRNA, ribosomal proteins) or inhibitors of ribosomal function such as antibiotics (reviewed in (6Cundliffe E. Hill W.E. Dahlberg A. Garrett R.A. Moore P.B. Schlessinger D. Warner J.R. The Ribosome: Structure, Function, and Evolution. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1990: 479-490Google Scholar)). The recent report that the peptidyl transferase function of Thermus aquaticus ribosomes is retained by the 23 S rRNA after extensive depletion of ribosomal proteins (7Noller H.F. Hoffarth V. Zimniak L. Science. 1992; 256: 1416-1424Google Scholar) demonstrates that 23 S rRNA plays a direct and major role in the peptidyl transferase reaction. Woese (8Woese C.R. Chambliss G. Craven G.R. Davies J. Davis K. Nomura M. Ribosomes: Structure, Function, and Genetics. University Park Press, Baltimore1980: 3-32Google Scholar) has defined three criteria for functionally interactive regions of ribosomal RNA: 1) universal sequence conservation, 2) single strandedness (defined by secondary structure), and 3) surface proximity (defined by three-dimensional structure). Further, it has been suggested that the occurrence of posttranscriptional modifications in functionally interactive regions is evidence that these modifications are involved in modulation of specific structural features(9Noller H.F. Woese C.R. Science. 1981; 212: 403-411Google Scholar). The primary structure of the central loop of domain V of 23 S rRNA contains nucleotide sequences that are almost universally conserved(10Gutell R.R. Schnare M.N. Gray M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 20: 2095-2109Google Scholar), including several nucleotides that are posttranscriptionally modified (11Fellner P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 11: 12-27Google Scholar, 12Stahl D.A.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10825-10834Google Scholar, 15Bakin A. Ofengand J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9754-9762Google Scholar). However, in contrast to tRNA, for which the chemical identities(16Limbach P.A. Crain P.F. McCloskey J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2183-2196Google Scholar), sequence locations(17Steinberg S. Misch A. Sprinzl M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3011-3015Google Scholar), and functional roles(18Bjrk G. Ericson J.U. Gustafsson C.E.D. Hagervall T.G. Jnsson Y.H. Wikstrm P.M. Annu. Rev.

CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 23-85Google Scholar) of modification have been studied in greater detail, the structures and functions of modification in rRNA have received considerably less attention, and detailed examination has been confined to relatively few organisms, principally higher eukaryotes (20Maden B.E.H. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1990; 39: 241-303Google Scholar) and Escherichia coli. In the case of E. coli 23 S rRNA, approximately 22 sites of modification are reported (summarized in (14Smith J.E. Cooperman B.S. Mitchell P. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10825-10834Google Scholar) and (15Bakin A. Ofengand J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9754-9762Google Scholar)), but some assignments are regarded as tentative, and a total census of modifications is yet incomplete. Because of the functional importance of domain V in 23 S rRNA, we have examined modifications in two segments around the central loop, residues 2423-2473 and 2481-2519, using a combination of methods based on mass spectrometry designed for characterization and sequence placement of modified nucleotides(21Kowalak J.A. Pomerantz S.C. Crain P.F. McCloskey J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4577-4585Google Scholar). We recently reported the detection of the modified nucleoside 5,6-dihydrouridine in a total nucleoside digest of E. coli 23 S rRNA(22Kowalak J.A. McCloskey J.A. Nierhaus K.H. Franceschi F. Subramanian A.R. Erdmann V.A. Wittman-Liebold B. The Translational Apparatus. Plenum Press, New York1993: 79-88Google Scholar), an observation in concert with an early literature report(23Johnson J.D. Horowitz J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 247: 262-279Google Scholar). We presently report that dihydrouridine occurs at position 2449, close to the CCA-aminoacyl terminus of tRNA in the ribosomal P-site established by cross-linking experiments(24Steiner G. Kuechler E. Barta A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3949-3955Google Scholar). 50 S ribosomal subunits were prepared from frozen E. coli MRE 600 cells (1/2 log phase; Grain Processing Corp., Muscatine, IA)(25Moazed D. Van Stolk B.J. Douthwaite S. Noller H.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 483-493Google Scholar). Ribosomal RNA (23 and 5 S) was isolated from 50 S subunits by extraction with phenol and chloroform(25Moazed D. Van Stolk B.J. Douthwaite S. Noller H.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 483-493Google Scholar). 23 S rRNA was separated from 5 S rRNA by precipitation of the former in the presence of 2 M LiCl. Purity of the 23 S rRNA isolate was assessed by gel electrophoresis (1% agarose; 3.5 × 50-mm tube) using an Applied Biosystems model 230A micro-preparative electrophoresis system. DNA oligonucleotides complementary to the gene sequence of E. coli 23 S rDNA from positions 2423 through 2473 (51-mer) and from positions 2481 through 2519 (39-mer), respectively, were synthesized on a 1.0-μmol scale using an Applied Biosystems model 380B DNA synthesizer at the University of Utah Protein/DNA Core Facility. The DNA 51-mer and 39-mer were purified by DEAE anion exchange HPLC,1 1The abbreviations used are: HPLChigh performance liquid chromatographym2A2-methyladenosinem6AN6-methyladenosineCm2′-O-methylcytidineLC/MScombined high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometryMneutral moleculeMH+protonated moleculeBH2+fragment ion corresponding to the protonated free base of a nucleoside. as described below. high performance liquid chromatography 2-methyladenosine N6-methyladenosine 2′-O-methylcytidine combined high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry neutral molecule protonated molecule fragment ion corresponding to the protonated free base of a nucleoside. In separate preparations, synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides (100 nmol), complementary to residues 2423-2473 and 2481-2519, respectively, of E. coli 23 S rRNA were combined with E. coli 23 S rRNA (10 nmol) in annealing buffer (100 mM KCl, 10 mM NH4OAc, pH 5.3, 10 mM Zn(OAc)2, 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol). The RNA was denatured by heating at 100°C for 2 min and then quickly cooled in an ice-water slush. The oligodeoxynucleotide was annealed to the ribosomal RNA during a 3-h incubation at 37°C. The RNA:DNA hybrid was then treated with mung bean nuclease (10,000 units; Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37°C for 30 min to hydrolyze all RNA not protected in the RNA:DNA duplex. The enzyme was removed by extraction with phenol and chloroform, and the RNA:DNA duplex was precipitated with 2 volumes of ethanol, pelleted by centrifugation, and dried in a Savant SpeedVac vacuum centrifuge. The sample was redissolved in 10 mM NH4OAc, pH 5.3, and 5 mM Mg(OAc)2 and digested with DNase I (1,000 units; Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37°C for 30 min. The rRNA 51-mer(2423-2473) and 39-mer(2481-2519) were separated from the resultant mixture of small oligodeoxynucleotides (n ≤ 6) by DEAE-anion exchange HPLC, as described below. E. coli 23 S rRNA (0.1 nmol) and enzymatically produced fragments thereof (0.9 nmol of 51-mer and 0.15 nmol of a 7-mer prepared from the 51-mer; 0.8 nmol of 39-mer and 0.16 nmol of a trimer and a 7-mer prepared from the 39-mer) were hydrolyzed to nucleosides using nuclease P1 (Life Technologies, Inc.), venom phosphodiesterase (Sigma), and alkaline phosphatase (Calbiochem)(26Crain P.F. Methods. Enzymol. 1990; 193: 782-790Google Scholar). The RNA 51-mer (8.0 nmol) and 39-mer (8.0 nmol) from E. coli 23 S rRNA were digested using RNase T1 (2,000 units; Ambion) for 30 min at 37°C(21Kowalak J.A. Pomerantz S.C. Crain P.F. McCloskey J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4577-4585Google Scholar). The synthetic DNA 51-mer and 39-mer were purified by anion exchange chromatography on a Nucleogen DEAE 60-7 column (4 × 125 mm) and precolumn (4 × 30 mm) (The Nest Group, Southborough, MA) installed on a Beckman model 332 liquid chromatograph with a Beckman model 160 UV monitor for detection at 254 nm. The eluant was a linear gradient of 0.025 M triethylammonium bicarbonate, pH 6.4, 20% CH3CN to 1.0 M triethylammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.8, 20% CH3CN at 1.0 ml/min for 50 min. The RNA 51-mer and 39-mer were separated from mixtures of oligodeoxynucleotides by DEAE-anion exchange chromatography using the same conditions described above. The oligonucleotide mixtures from complete RNase T1 digestion of the E. coli 23 S RNA 51-mer and 39-mer were fractionated by anion exchange chromatography(21Kowalak J.A. Pomerantz S.C. Crain P.F. McCloskey J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4577-4585Google Scholar). Subsequent reversed phase purification and subfractionation of specific DEAE oligonucleotide fractions was accomplished by HPLC with a Supelcosil LC-18S column (4.6 × 250 mm) and precolumn (4.6 × 30 mm) using a linear gradient of 0.025 M triethylammonium bicarbonate, pH 6.4, 2% CH3CN and CH3CN:H2O (4:6)(21Kowalak J.A. Pomerantz S.C. Crain P.F. McCloskey J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4577-4585Google Scholar). The mass spectrometer for LC/MS analyses consists of a non-commercial quadrupole mass analyzer, with thermospray ionization interface (Vestec Corp, Houston, TX), controlled by a Vector/One data system (Teknivent Corp., St. Louis, MO). Separation of nucleosides was carried out with a Beckman 322 liquid chromatograph with Waters 440 dual wavelength (254 and 280 nm) UV monitor placed in series between the chromatograph and mass spectrometer, using a Supelcosil LC-18S 4.6 × 250-mm column and 4.6 × 30-mm C18 precolumn (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA) thermostatted at 32°C. The HPLC gradient elution system of Buck et al.(27Buck M. Connick M. Ames B.N. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 129: 1-13Google Scholar) with 0.25 M ammonium acetate (pH 6.0) and acetonitrile was used with minor modifications in the gradient profile (28Pomerantz S.C. McCloskey J.A. Methods. Enzymol. 1990; 193: 796-824Google Scholar). Mass spectra were acquired every 1.7 s during the 35-min chromatographic separation. The instrument, procedures, and interpretation of data for characterization of nucleosides in RNA hydrolysates have been described(28Pomerantz S.C. McCloskey J.A. Methods. Enzymol. 1990; 193: 796-824Google Scholar, 29Edmonds C.G. Vestal M.L. McCloskey J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8197-8206Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides from RNase T1 hydrolysis of the 51-mer and 39-mer fragments from E. coli 23 S rRNA were dissolved in H2O and diluted with CH3OH to 1:9 (v/v) at a final sample concentration of 8.0 pmol/μl (assuming quantitative recovery from two chromatographies). Samples were continuously infused at a flow rate of 2.0 μl/min using a Harvard model 22 syringe pump into the electrospray ion source of a Sciex API III+ mass spectrometer (Ontario), operated with quadrupole-3 in rf-only mode. The mass spectrum presented in Fig. 3 is the sum of ten scans (m/z 200 through m/z 1200) acquired at a rate of 40 s/scan. Calibration of the mass scale was accomplished using synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides as mass reference standards(21Kowalak J.A. Pomerantz S.C. Crain P.F. McCloskey J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4577-4585Google Scholar). The sequence location and structural characterization of posttranscriptionally modified residues in two segments (totaling 90 nucleotides) of the primary sequence of E. coli 23 S rRNA (2904 nucleotides) as described in the following sections is based on a nuclease protection strategy used in combination with recently developed mass spectrometric methodologies(21Kowalak J.A. Pomerantz S.C. Crain P.F. McCloskey J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4577-4585Google Scholar), in which posttranscriptional modifications are detected by mass shifts (e.g. U ⟶ D, +2 Da) not predicted by the rDNA sequence. A UV absorbance chromatogram corresponding to the LC/MS analysis of ribonucleosides present in an enzymatic hydrolysate of 0.1 nmol of intact E. coli 23 S rRNA is shown in Fig. 1A. Reconstructed ion chromatograms based on specific mass values characteristic of nucleosides of interest are presented in Fig. 1, B-D. In Fig. 1B, the ion of m/z 247, at 3.3 min elution time(28Pomerantz S.C. McCloskey J.A. Methods. Enzymol. 1990; 193: 796-824Google Scholar), corresponds to the protonated molecular ion (MH+) of dihydrouridine. The other m/z 247 signals at 5.1 and 7.1 min result from minor isotope peaks of cytidine and uridine, respectively, which are present in great molar excess relative to D (gene sequence indicates the RNA composition C639U591G912A762). The total number of D residues in E. coli 23 S rRNA is presently not known but is presumed to be one. The presence of a previously unidentified ribonucleoside species of m/z 259 is detected at 10.9 min (Fig. 1C). A protonated molecular mass of 259 Da is consistent with a monomethyl uridine derivative, Mr 258. Based on relative retention time(28Pomerantz S.C. McCloskey J.A. Methods. Enzymol. 1990; 193: 796-824Google Scholar), the known (16Limbach P.A. Crain P.F. McCloskey J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2183-2196Google Scholar) RNA methyluridine isomers 3- and 5-methyluridine, 1-methylpseudouridine, and 2′-O-methyluridine are excluded. Structural characterization and sequence location of the Mr 258 nucleoside, which is located outside of domain V, is being investigated separately. Also observed are ions of m/z 259 at 14.8 and 16.7 min that correspond to the protonated molecular ions of 5-methyluridine (m5U) and 2′-O-methyluridine, respectively. LC/MS analysis of 2′-O-methylated nucleosides (and their 3′ neighbors), prepared from RNase T2 hydrolysis of E. coli 23 S rRNA, shows an ion of m/z 113 at 16.7 min (data not shown) that corresponds to the protonated non-methylated base ion (BH2+) of uracil. Clearly, these results do not support the earlier report of 3-methyluridine based on HPLC data alone (30Gehrke C.W. Kuo K.C. J. Chromatogr. 1989; 471: 3-36Google Scholar) but agree with early reports of 2′-O-methyluridine in E. coli 23 S rRNA (e.g.(31Nichols J.L. Lane B.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 30: 477-489Google Scholar)). The minor ion profiles of m/z 259, at 11.7 and 13.5 min in Fig. 1C, represent the 13C isotope peaks of 5-methylcytidine and 2′-O-methylcytidine, respectively. The detection of 2-methyladenosine and N6-methyladenosine is shown in Fig. 1D. The thermospray mass spectra of these isomers are similar; both species produce a protonated molecular ion of m/z 282 (corresponding to Mr 281) at 24.8 min (m2A) and 25.3 min (m6A) and protonated base fragment ion of m/z 150 (data not shown). These isomers are differentiated by their relative retention times (28Pomerantz S.C. McCloskey J.A. Methods. Enzymol. 1990; 193: 796-824Google Scholar) and their characteristic UV absorbance ratios (A254/A280) (data not shown). This result agrees with an earlier report based on HPLC data (30Gehrke C.W. Kuo K.C. J. Chromatogr. 1989; 471: 3-36Google Scholar) that both m2A and m6A are present in E. coli 23 S rRNA. Determination of the sequence location of m2A is presented below. N6,N6-Dimethyladenosine was previously reported in substoichiometric amount in E. coli 23 S RNA (30Gehrke C.W. Kuo K.C. J. Chromatogr. 1989; 471: 3-36Google Scholar) but is clearly absent in the present study (tR 30.6 min; region not shown in Fig. 1A). Detection in the earlier work is judged to result from contamination by 16 S RNA. An RNA 51-mer was prepared by hybridization of an oligodeoxynucleotide (complementary to positions 2423-2473) to 23 S rRNA, followed by enzymatic removal of the non-hybridized RNA and excess cDNA. This approach is conceptually similar to the strategy of Maden(32Maden B.E.H. Nature. 1980; 288: 293-296Google Scholar), although we have made several changes in experimental detail (see “Materials and Methods”). The yield of RNA 51-mer (8.9 nmol) was determined by UV absorbance at 260 nm. An aliquot (1/10 of the sample) was enzymatically hydrolyzed to nucleosides and analyzed by LC/MS (Fig. 2A). Mass spectra from selected time points are presented in Fig. 2, B-D. Fig. 2B was recorded at 3.3 min and reveals ions of m/z 115 and 247 corresponding to BH2+ and MH+ ions of dihydrouridine(29Edmonds C.G. Vestal M.L. McCloskey J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8197-8206Google Scholar). Fig. 2C shows the mass spectrum recorded at 3.5 min and reveals the MH+ ion of pseudouridine at m/z 245. The protonated base (aglycone) ion, BH2+ of m/z 166 at 19.7 min, corresponds to N2-methylguanosine (Fig. 2D). The MH+ ion, usually of low abundance, was observed in the mass spectrum of this component in the analysis of a separate 51-mer isolate (data not shown). Inspection of the E. coli 23 S rDNA sequence shows that the unmodified base composition of the 51-mer is C13U7A17G14. The molar ratio of pseudouridine relative to uridine was determined to be 1:5 based on the comparison of molar response ratios of these nucleosides relative to those residues in a hydrolysate of E. coli tRNATyr.2 2J. A. McCloskey, unpublished results. Furthermore, the molar ratio of pseudouridine relative to N2-methylguanosine was determined to be 1:1 based on comparison of molar response ratios from UV detection compared to that of authentic standards.3 3J. M. Peltier, unpublished results. Taken in toto, the mass spectrometric detection of dihydrouridine and the molar ratio of one pseudouridine residue per five uridine residues exactly accounts for the seven uridines predicted from the gene sequence(33Brosius J. Dull T.J. Noller H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 201-204Google Scholar). The RNA 51-mer (8.0 nmol) was digested with RNase T1, and the resultant oligonucleotide mixture was separated into 25 fractions using DEAE-anion exchange HPLC (data not shown)(21Kowalak J.A. Pomerantz S.C. Crain P.F. McCloskey J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4577-4585Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide fractions were dried in a vacuum centrifuge, dissolved in H2O, and rechromatographed by reversed phase HPLC (data not shown) to facilitate subsequent analysis by electrospray mass spectrometry. For example, the electrospray mass spectrum of one of the HPLC fractions from the 7-mer oligonucleotide pool is presented in Fig. 3. Interpretation of the mass spectrum reveals that five molecular species (an unexpectedly large number) are present. The exact base composition (and net modification when present) of each oligonucleotide was determined directly from each mass spectrometrically measured molecular mass(21Kowalak J.A. Pomerantz S.C. Crain P.F. McCloskey J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4577-4585Google Scholar, 34Pomerantz S.C. Kowalak J.A. McCloskey J.A. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1993; 4: 204-209Google Scholar). The resulting oligonucleotide molecular weights and compositions are listed in Table 1. The mass spectrum (Fig. 3) is dominated by multiply charged ions associated with component M1, with ions corresponding to loss of six through two protons in terms of the neutral oligonucleotide (i.e. ions (M − 6H)6- through (M − 2H)2-), from which the value of M was determined to be 2293.33. Based on the experimentally determined molecular mass of this oligonucleotide and the absence of methylation (see below), the sole composition and net modification allowed is CUA4Gp + 2H (Mr 2293.43 (calculated)), which indicates that the oligonucleotide measured is 2448-AUAACAGp-2454, as dictated by the gene sequence, and that the single uridine residue has been posttranscriptionally modified (by reduction) to 5,6-dihydrouridine. The compositions of all other molecular species present in the electrospray mass spectrum are also readily determined by accurate mass measurement and are consistent with sequence elements of the 2448-2454 residue 7-mer. For example, ions of m/z 399.22, 532.59, and 799.44 (Fig. 3) correspond to the (M − 4H)4- through (M − 2H)2- ions of an oligonucleotide of Mr 1600.87. The composition of this species (M2) is CUA3>p + 2H (Mr = 1600.98 (calculated), see Table 1). Interestingly, the ion at m/z 538.60 corresponds to the (M − 3H)3- charge state of an oligonucleotide of Mr 1618.80, which is 18 mass units (H2O) greater than that of M2 (Table 1) and therefore is assigned as CUA3p + 2H (Mr = 1619.00 (calculated)), component M3. Similarly, the peak at m/z 636.25 is assigned as the molecular ion of the dinucleotide (U, A) > p + 2H (Mr = 637.38 (calculated), M4). The ion at m/z 691.28 (M5) is assigned as the molecular ion, (M − H)-, of the dinucleotide AGp (Mr = 692.43 (calculated)). This assignment is supported by the mass measurement of the sodium ion adduct, i.e. the replacement of a proton by a sodium cation (M − 2H + Na)-, at +22 m/z units (Mr = 713.29 (measured)). The base compositions of the minor constituents M2 through M5 imply that they are fragments of the principal component M1, although it cannot be determined from the present evidence whether they are formed by nucleolytic hydrolysis or by gas-phase dissociation of M1 ions.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab An aliquot of the 7-mer sample (0.15 nmol) was hydrolyzed to its nucleoside constituents using nuclease P1 and alkaline phosphatase (26Crain P.F. Methods. Enzymol. 1990; 193: 782-790Google Scholar) and analyzed by LC/MS to verify the base composition (CUA4Gp + 2H = CDA4Gp) determined by molecular mass measurement. The UV detection chromatogram resulting from this LC/MS analysis is shown in Fig. 4A. The composition of this oligonucleotide was measured as C1.04A3.87G1.00 based on comparison of molar response ratios from UV detection compared to authentic standards (data not shown). The mass spectrum recorded at 3.3 min elution time (similar to Fig. 2B, data not shown) reveals the presence of dihydrouridine, thus confirming the composition (CDA4G) independently determined directly by mass measurement. Fig. 4B shows the mass spectrum of the 18.9-min eluant, in which ions of m/z 247, 136, and 268 are detected; these are interpreted as the MH+ ion of dihydrouridine and the BH2+ and MH+ ions of adenosine, respectively. All three ions exhibit the same chromatographic profile, with an elution time different from those of the constituent nucleosides, indicative (35Takeda N. Pomerantz S.C. McCloskey J.A. J. Chromatogr. 1991; 562: 225-235Google Scholar) of a D,A-containing dinucleotide. This result supports the nucleotide sequence element ADA in the 7-mer. Using the same strategy described above, an RNA 39-mer residue(2481-2519) was also prepared. The yield of RNA 39-mer was determined by UV absorbance at 260 nm as 8.8 nmol. An aliquot (1/10 of the sample) was enzymatically hydrolyzed to nucleosides and analyzed by LC/MS (Fig. 5A). Due to an electronic baseline zero-point malfunction, the true baseline in Fig. 5A was not digitized. Reconstructed ion chromatograms based on specific m/z values characteristic of nucleosides of interest are presented in Fig. 5, B-D. In Fig. 5B, the ion of m/z 245, at 3.6 min elution time, corresponds to the MH+ of pseudouridine (Ψ). The other m/z 245 signals at 5.2 and 7.5 min result from a minor isotope peak of cytidine and the protonated molecular ion (MH+) of uridine, respectively. The detection of Ψ in the region 2481-2519 is consistent with the recent identification of pseudouridine at position 2504 by Bakin and Ofengand(15Bakin A. Ofengand J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9754-9762Google Scholar). In Fig. 5C, the ion of m/z 258 at 14.5 min elution time corresponds to the protonated molecular ion (MH+) of 2′-O-methylcytidine. The detection of Cm within the segment 2481-2519 is consistent with previous literature reports(2Noller H.F. Kop J.A. Wheaton V. Brosius J. Gutell R.R. Kopylov A.M. Dohme F. Herr W. Stahl D.A.

The ion of m/z 282 at 24.3 min (Fig. 5D) corresponds to the MH+ ion of a monomethyl adenosine. The assignment specifically as m2A is based on relative retention time (which is 0.6 min earlier than m6A (28Pomerantz S.C. McCloskey J.A. Methods.

The RNA 39-mer (8.0 nmol) was digested with RNase T1, and the resultant oligonucleotide mixture was separated into 17 fractions using DEAE-anion exchange HPLC (data not shown)(21Kowalak J.A.

As described above, the oligonucleotide fractions were dried in a vacuum centrifuge, dissolved in H2O, and rechromatographed by reversed phase HPLC (data not shown) to facilitate subsequent analysis by electrospray mass spectrometry. Two oligonucleotides were found to contain posttranscriptionally modified residues, based on accurate mass measurement. The mass of an oligonucleotide trimer was measured as Mr = 1013.0 (spectrum not shown), which mandates the base composition and net modification as UAGp + CH2 (Mr 1012.63 (calculated)), which indicates that the modification-containing oligonucleotide measured represents 2503-AUGp-2505 as dictated by the gene sequence in this region.

Genetic and biochemical studies have identified several proteins, encoded by sec genes, that are required for the translocation of proteins across the plasma membrane in bacteria (reviewed in (1Bieker K.L. Phillips G.J. Silhavy T.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomemb. 1990; 22: 291-310Google Scholar)). These proteins include soluble/peripheral components (SecB and SecA) and a membrane-bound translocase complex that includes SecY and SecE(2Emr S.D. Hanley-Way S. Silhavy T.J. Cell. 1981; 23: 79-88Google Scholar, 3Shiba K. Ito K. Yura T. Cerretti D.P. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 631-635Google Scholar, 4Schatz P.J. Riggs P.D. Annick J. Fath M.J. Beckwith J.

Other integral membrane proteins, SecD and SecF, appear to participate in the later stages of the translocation process(6Gardel C. Johnson K. Jacq A. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3209-3216Google Scholar). SecY is a particularly interesting protein that spans the membrane 10 times (7Akiyama Y. Ito K. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3351-3356Google Scholar) and is homologous to the SEC61α protein involved in protein transport across the endoplasmic reticulum (8Grlich D. Prehn S. Hartmann E. Kalies K.-U. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 489-503Google Scholar). This observation suggests that these translocation mechanisms are fundamentally similar and derived from a common ancestor. Several lines of evidence have indicated that a Sec-type mechanism also operates for the transport of proteins across the thylakoid membrane. Nuclear-encoded thylakoid lumen proteins are synthesized with bipartite presequences containing “envelope transit” and “thylakoid transfer” signals in tandem; the transfer signals are similar in several structural respects to bacterial export, or “signal” peptides(9Hageman J. Robinson C. Smeekens S. Weisbeek P. Nature. 1986; 324: 567-569Google Scholar, 10James H.E. Bartling D. Musgrove J.E. Kirwin P.M. Herrmann R.G. Robinson C. J. Biol.

Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 479-494Google Scholar). SecY homologs have also been found in the plastid genomes of red algae and cyanophytes(13Douglas S.E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 298: 93-96Google Scholar, 14Flachmann R. Michalowski C.B. Lffelhardt W. Bohnert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7514-7519Google Scholar), and recent studies have shown the involvement of SecA in the transport of proteins across the chloroplast thylakoid membrane(15Nakai M. Goto A. Nohara T. Sugita D. Endo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31338-31341Google Scholar, 16Yuan J. Henry R. McCaffrey M. Cline K. Science. 1994; 266: 796-798Google Scholar). A major surprise, however, has been the demonstration of a second, ΔpH-driven thylakoidal protein translocase which has very different features (reviewed in (17Robinson C. Klsgen R.B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 26: 15-24Google Scholar)). To date, no sec genes have been cloned from higher plants, and it is unclear whether the Sec-dependent translocation system of thylakoids is similar in structural terms to those of prokaryotes. In this report we describe the sequence of an Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA encoding a SecY homolog, cpSecY, which is synthesized with a presequence and imported into the thylakoid membrane of pea chloroplasts. Clone 107N18T7 was obtained from the Arabidopsis biological resource center in Columbus, OH, after partial sequence analysis of random clones in the MSU Arabidopsis thaliana Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) programme indicated that this clone contained regions homologous to known secY genes in the data base; approximately 420 bp1 1The abbreviations used are: bpbase pair(s)kbkilobase(s). was sequenced in the laboratory of T. Newman (Michigan). The insert was excised using SalI and NotI, end-labeled, and used to screen an Arabidopsis cDNA library (λZipLox™ (Life Technologies Inc.) that was also obtained from the Ohio stock center. One of the clones isolated, psecY17, contained a 1.8-kb insert; in vitro transcription-translation of this clone generated a 58-kDa protein which was found to import into chloroplasts and is thus full-length (see text). Both strands of psecY17 were fully sequenced. base pair(s) kilobase(s). Protocols for transcription-translation and chloroplast import have been described elsewhere(9Hageman J. Robinson C. Smeekens S. Weisbeek P. Nature. 1986; 324: 567-569Google Scholar). Preparation of enriched envelope and thylakoid membrane fractions was carried out using a method modified from that of Flgge et al.(18Flgge U.-I. Fischer K. Gross A. Sebald W. Lottspeich F. Eckershorn C. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 39-46Google Scholar). Chloroplasts from an import experiment were lysed on ice for 5 min in 10 mM Hepes-KOH, 5 mM MgCl2, pH 8.0, to a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml chlorophyll. The lysate was centrifuged for 30 s at 3700 × g to pellet thylakoid membranes, and the supernatant was recentrifuged twice at 3700 × g to recover remaining thylakoids; these pellets were pooled and washed once in the same buffer. The final pellet corresponds to the “thylakoid” fraction described in Fig. 3B. A second sample of thylakoid fraction was incubated with thermolysin (0.2 mg/ml) for 30 min on ice (= protease-treated thylakoid fraction). The supernatants from the three 30-s centrifugations were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 15 min to recover envelope membranes; the supernatant (= stromal fraction) was removed and the envelope membranes were washed once to generate the “envelope” fraction. Samples of each fraction were analyzed by fluorography to visualize the imported cpSecY polypeptides, and by immunoblotting using an Amersham International plc kit for enhanced chemiluminescence. The MSU Arabidopsis EST programme carries out the partial sequencing of random cDNA clones in order to identify, by comparison with DNA and protein data bases, putative clones encoding proteins of interest. One of the clones was reported to be homologous to secY genes, and we have characterized the clone and related gene product to determine the full sequence and location of the encoded protein. The 1.1-kilobase pair insert of clone 107N18T7 was used to screen an Arabidopsis cDNA library, and one of the positives, psecY17, contained a 1.8-kilobase pair insert which was fully sequenced. The cDNA sequence predicts a protein of 551 residues (Fig. 1). Comparison with the secY genes from Synechococcus(19Nakai M. Tanaka A. Omata T. Endo T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1171: 113-116Google Scholar) and Escherichia coli(20Cerretti D.P. Dean D. Davis G.R. Bedwell D.M. Nomura M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 2599-2619Google Scholar) shows that psecY17 is highly homologous to these genes but contains approximately 120 additional residues at the amino terminus (Fig. 2); this putative presequence is similar in terms of amino acid composition to the presequences of numerous stromal proteins, suggesting a plastid-targeting function. As would be expected for a chloroplast protein, given the strong evidence for the evolution of chloroplasts from cyanobacteria, the Arabidopsis SecY protein is more homologous to Synechococcus SecY than to the E. coli protein (41% and 33% identity, respectively, at the amino acid level if the amino-terminal extension is ignored). Areas of homology are found over most of the “mature” protein sequence but are particularly pronounced in the second transmembrane segment and the hydrophilic sections on either side.Figure 2:Alignment of the A. thaliana SecY protein (A.thal) with SecY sequences from Synechococcus (Synech) and E. coli. Identical residues are indicated by asterisks, and conserved residues by dots. A putative cleavage site for the stromal processing peptidase is indicated by an arrowhead. Transmembrane segments in the E. coli protein are underlined and numbered in parentheses.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In overall structural terms, the Arabidopsis protein is also similar to other SecY proteins. Topology analysis of E. coli SecY strongly suggests that the protein contains 10 transmembrane segments(7Akiyama Y. Ito K. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3351-3356Google Scholar), and the hydropathy profile of the protein encoded by psecY17 is very similar to those of other SecY proteins (not shown). The general organization of the protein thus appears to have been highly conserved in various genera of bacteria, in the plastid genomes of eukaryotic algae, and now also in higher plants. It remains to be determined whether Sec-dependent protein translocation is similar in mechanistic terms in these disparate organisms. Although the sequence of the Arabidopsis secY cDNA is consistent with the presence of a presequence in the initial translation product, it was deemed important to determine experimentally whether this is the case, and whether the protein is targeted into chloroplasts. There is no consensus sequence for chloroplast-targeting signals, and mitochondrial targeting signals are not dissimilar in terms of amino acid composition(21von Heijne G. Steppuhn J. Herrmann R.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 535-545Google Scholar). This point was addressed by preparing an in vitro transcription-translation product of psecY17 and incubating the labeled protein with intact pea chloroplasts (Fig. 3A). The data show that the SecY homolog is synthesized as a 58-kDa precursor protein, efficiently imported into the organelles and processed to a mature size of 46 kDa which is protected from proteolysis (confirming import). These data demonstrate that psecY17 does indeed encode a chloroplast SecY homolog, which we have termed cpSecY. Fractionation studies were carried out to determine the location of the imported protein, and the results are shown in Fig. 3B. Following import, the chloroplasts were lysed and separated into a stromal fraction, and fractions enriched in envelope and thylakoid membranes. The purity of the membrane fractions was assessed using antisera raised against the 30-kDa phosphate translocator of the inner envelope membrane (18Flgge U.-I. Fischer K. Gross A. Sebald W. Lottspeich F. Eckershorn C. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 39-46Google Scholar) and the 23-kDa protein of the oxygen-evolving complex (a thylakoid lumen protein). The immunoblot in Fig. 3B shows that the envelope fraction does in fact contain the vast majority of envelope membranes, since virtually all of the phosphate translocator is found in this fraction. The envelope fraction also contains a significant proportion of the 23-kDa protein, indicating contamination with thylakoid membranes. The thylakoid fraction (T) is less contaminated, containing most of the 23-kDa protein and very little phosphate translocator. The lumenal 23-kDa protein in the thylakoid fraction is resistant to proteolysis (lane Tp), as expected of a thylakoid lumen protein. Quantitation of the imported cpSecY in these fractions (graph in Fig. 3B) shows that most of the protein (44%) is found in the thylakoid membrane, where it is sensitive to proteolysis. 33% of the cpSecY is found in the envelope fraction, but the immunoblot data indicate that most (if not all) of this protein is present in contaminating thylakoid membranes: if the cpSecY were targeted into the envelope, the vast majority of protein would be localized in the envelope fraction, as is the case with the phosphate translocator. The remainder of the imported cpSecY is found in the stromal fraction. We conclude from this experiment that cpSecY is targeted to the thylakoid membrane, although we cannot formally rule out the possibility that some protein resides in the envelope membranes. The stromal fraction presumably contains cpSecY molecules which are en route to the thylakoid membrane. Most integral thylakoid membrane proteins are synthesized with stroma-targeting presequences, with information in the mature proteins specifying localization in the thylakoid (rather than the envelope) membrane. The cpSecY presequence appears to fulfill a similar function, because it does not resemble the bipartite presequences which usually target lumenal proteins across the thylakoid membrane. The latter peptides contain a hydrophobic region followed by an Ala-X-Ala (or very similar) motif specifying processing by the thylakoidal processing peptidase, and there is no evidence for this type of peptide. The presequence is, however, relatively long for a stroma-targeting signal if the mature cpSecY protein is of a similar size to other SecY proteins. The start of the mature protein cannot be identified empirically because there is no strict consensus cleavage site for the stromal processing peptidase. Nevertheless, many stroma-targeting peptides end with a loosely conserved motif (Val/Ile-X-Ala/Cys↓Ala)(22Gavel Y. von Heijne G. FEBS Lett. 1990; 261: 455-458Google Scholar), and a motif of this description can be found in the pre-cpSecY sequence as indicated in Fig. 2. The cleavage point would then occur after 121 residues of presequence, leaving a mature protein of 430 residues. As with most stroma-targeting presequences(21von Heijne G. Steppuhn J. Herrmann R.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 535-545Google Scholar), the presequence is highly enriched in hydroxylated residues (40 out of 121 if cleavage is where indicated), and overall positively charged, although it also contains several acidic residues (probably 5 or 6) which are uncommon in chloroplast protein presequences. Given that cpSecY is almost certainly synthesized with a stroma-targeting presequence, the implication is that information in the mature protein specifies integration into the thylakoid membrane. One or more of the 10 transmembrane segments may therefore serve as a thylakoid integration signal, and it will be interesting to determine mechanistic details of the integration process. cpSecY is probably the most hydrophobic protein known to be imported into chloroplasts, and it will be equally interesting to determine how this protein is prevented from aggregating during passage through the stromal phase. Most importantly, however, the sequence data reported here will enable more detailed studies to be carried out on the membrane-bound proteins of the Sec apparatus. Due to the extreme hydrophobicity of SecY, biochemical studies on its role have relied on the use of antibodies to block the action of the protein(23Watanabe M. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1895-1899Google Scholar), and it has only proved possible to raise antibodies to peptide fragments corresponding to hydrophilic, exposed areas of the SecY protein. Antibodies raised against E. coli SecY do not cross-react with cpSecY from pea or spinach,2 2V. Laidler, A. M. Chaddock, T. G. Knott, D. Walker, and C. Robinson, unpublished data. but it should now be possible to generate antibodies to the Arabidopsis protein and probe the role of cpSecY in some detail.

INTRODUCTIONSaliva is the first digestive fluid secreted by the gastrointestinal pathway and performs a variety of functions. It is essential in the formation of small boluses of food, provides lubrication for swallowing and speech, dissolves a number of chemicals in food substances, and provides digestive enzymes such as amylase and lipase (12Hamosh M. Scow R.O. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 88-95Google Scholar; 7Field R.B. Hand A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: G217-G225Google Scholar). About 90% of saliva is produced by three major glands, the parotid, the submaxillary, and the sublingual glands, whose secretions drain into the oral cavity. von Ebner's glands are unique salivary glands contained within the tongue that drain directly into the clefts of the circumvallate and foliate papillae, which contain the major taste buds. Secretions of von Ebner's gland directly modulate taste perception (11Gurkan S. Bradley R.M. Chem. Senses. 1988; 13: 655-661Google Scholar). Although von Ebner's gland is known to secrete certain proteins, such as lipase, very little is known of the protein composition of the gland's secretions or the molecular mechanisms whereby they influence taste perception. In the present study we have identified a novel von Ebner's gland protein, designated Ebnerin, which appears to be formed in the ducts of von Ebner's gland and released into fluid bathing the taste buds contained in the taste papillae.MATERIALS AND METHODSPolymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) 1The abbreviations used are: PCRpolymerase chain reactionVEGvon Ebner's glandSRCRscavenger receptor cysteine-richPBSphosphate-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: PCRpolymerase chain reactionVEGvon Ebner's glandSRCRscavenger receptor cysteine-richPBSphosphate-buffered saline. and Northern AnalysisCircumvallate papillae containing taste buds and tongue epithelium were dissected as described previously (17Hwang P.M. Verma A. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7395-7399Google Scholar), and RNA was extracted from the circumvallate papillae. 10 μg of total RNA were reverse transcribed using 1 μg of oligo(dT) as primer. 1 μl of the reverse transcription mix was used in a 25-μl PCR containing 1.5 mM MgCl2, 400 nM primers, 200 μM dNTP, and 0.5 unit of Taq polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim). To search for genes associated with salty taste, degenerate primers based on the published sequences of the amiloride-sensitive sodium channel (4Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 467-470Google Scholar) were used to amplify mRNA from rat circumvallate papillae. PCR conditions were 35 cycles of 1 min at 95°C, 2 min at 45°C or 65°C, and 1 min at 72°C. PCR products were then subcloned into Bluescript vector and sequenced. The PCR primers used in this study were the forward primer (GGACAGAATTCGNGGNAA(T/C)TA(T/C)GGNGA(T/C)TG) and the reverse primer (GATCCACTCGAGNGA(T/C)TTNACNGANGGCCA), which correspond, respectively, to S372LGGNYGDC380 and W520PSVKSQ526 of the amiloride-sensitive sodium channel (Canessa et al., 1993). Total RNA (20 μg) was prepared from various rat tissues, fractionated on 1% agarose/formaldehyde gels, and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. [32P]dCTP-labeled PCR product (400 base pairs) was used as a probe. The blot was hybridized in 50% formamide and 5 × SSC hybridization buffer at 42°C and washed with 0.1 × SSC at 65°C. The blot was then exposed to x-ray film for 1 day at −70°C.Constructing and Screening of a Rat Circumvallate Papillae cDNA LibraryA rat taste cDNA library was constructed as described previously (24Li X.J. Blackshaw S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1814-1818Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from the circumvallate papillae of 500 rats. Poly(A+) RNA was prepared by passing RNA through an oligo(dT) column twice. About 5 μg of poly(A+) RNA were converted to cDNA for construction of the cDNA library using a Lambda Zap vector cDNA library synthesis kit (Stratagene). The library consists of 1.5 × 106 independent clones with an average insert size about 1.2 kilobase pairs. The cDNA clone generated by PCR was labeled using a random primer kit and [32P]dCTP and was used to screen a rat circumvallate papillae cDNA library under high stringency (50% formamide and 5 × SSC at 42°C for hybridization and 1 × SSC at 55°C for a final wash). Positive clones were purified, and cDNA was prepared for restriction mapping and sequence analysis.In Situ HybridizationcRNA probes were made for in situ hybridization on rat tongue tissue sections. A PCR clone in a Bluescript vector containing a 400-base pair insert was used to generate antisense RNA probes with [33P]UTP labeling (DuPont NEN). Sense RNA probes provided negative controls. Tissue sections (16 μm) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, and digested with 10 μg/ml proteinase K at 37°C for 30 min. Sections were then rinsed in 0.1 M triethanolamine, acetylated in 0.25% acetic anhydride for 10 min, and dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol solutions. Hybridization was performed with 106 cpm/100 μl of probe in 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 0.3 M MgCl2, 10 mM Tris (pH 8), 1 × Denhardt's solution, 0.5 mg/ml tRNA, and 10 mM DTT overnight at 55°C. Excess cRNA probe was removed by digestion with RNase A (20 μg/ml) for 30 min and washed at a final stringency of 0.1 × SSC at 60°C for 30 min. Slides were hand-dipped in Kodak NTB2 emulsion, exposed for 3-4 days at 4°C, developed, and stained with Giemsa stain (Sigma).Immunoblot and ImmunohistochemistryA peptide corresponding to a partial amino sequences of Ebnerin (F929TTDHSVTRRGFRADYYS946) was synthesized with the addition of a lysine on the N terminus to facilitate conjugating to bovine serum albumin with glutaraldehyde. The conjugated antigen was injected into rabbits, and antisera were purified by an Affi-Gel 15 (Bio-Rad) affinity column following standard procedures (Harlow & Lane, 1988). The purified antiserum contains 12 μg/ml antibody. In Western blot analysis, a 1:100 dilution of purified antiserum was used. Protein samples were prepared from various tissues homogenized in PBS buffer containing proteinase inhibitors (1 mM pepstatin A, 0.1 mM aprotinin, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mM leupeptin). Protein samples (100 μg) were denatured in SDS sample buffer at 100°C for 5 min before loading onto a SDS gel. The secretions from VEG were collected by gently removing the mucous materials on the apical region of circumvallate papillae from 5 rats using a razor blade, and half of the collected materials were loaded onto a 6% SDS gel. Fractionated proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and blots were blocked in PBS with 5% nonfat dry milk. Blots were then incubated with a 1:200 dilution antibody in the same buffer overnight at 4°C. Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) assay was used to detect stained proteins following instructions from the kit (Amersham).Tissue sections for immunohistochemical studies were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min, 0.4% Triton in PBS for 30 min, and 0.3% H2O2 in methanol for 15 min with washes in PBS following each treatment. Sections were then blocked in 5% normal goat serum in PBS for 1 h and incubated with 1:200 diluted antibody in PBS for 24 h at 4°C. ABC and DAB detecting kits (Vector) were used to visualize immunoreactivity signals in the tissue sections.RESULTSMolecular Cloning of EbnerinIn a search for taste bud-associated proteins linked to salty taste perception, we conducted PCR analysis employing primers based on the sequence of the amiloride-sensitive sodium channel, which is involved in salty taste perception (14Heck G.L. Mierson S. DeSimone J.A. Science. 1984; 223: 403-405Google Scholar; 33Schiffman S.S. Lockhead E. Maes F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6136-6140Google Scholar). We identified a novel PCR product unrelated to the amiloride-sensitive channel. Initial Northern blots of this PCR product revealed selective enrichment in von Ebner's gland. We employed the PCR product to screen a cDNA library derived from circumvallate papillae containing taste buds and obtained a cDNA of 4267 base pairs that encodes a protein of 1290 amino acids that is designated Ebnerin (Fig. 1). Ebnerin displays sequence homology to a variety of proteins (Fig. 1a and 2). It possesses four repeat domains with 50-70% amino acid identity to various members of the scavenger receptor protein family, which binds a variety of proteins and peptides (Kodama et al., 1990; 32Rohrer L. Freeman M. Kodama T. Penman M. Krieger M. Nature. 1990; 343: 570-572Google Scholar). There also are three repeat domains with about 30-35% amino acid identity to bone morphogenetic type-I protein (Fukagawa et al., 1994), transforming growth factor β receptor type III (25Lopez-Casillas F. Cheifetz S. Doody J. Andres J.L. Lane W.S. Massague J. Cell. 1991; 67: 785-795Google Scholar; 36Wang X.-F. Lin H.Y. Ng-Eaton E. Downward J. Lodish H.F. Weinberg R.A.

In the C-terminal area of Ebnerin, a 305-amino-acid domain displays 12-22% amino acid identity to the zona pellucida region in a sperm-binding protein of eggs (23Lepage T. Ghiglione C. Gache C. Development. 1992; 114: 147-163Google Scholar) and in uromodulin (Pennica et al., 1987) and to the glycoprotein of zymogen granule membranes (Fukuoka et al., 1991). Ebnerin possesses a single 23-amino-acid transmembrane region with a very short, 17-amino-acid presumed intracellular C-terminal area. There are 15 N-linked glycosylation sites in the putative extracellular domain (Fig. 1b).Figure 2:Alignment of amino acid sequence of Ebnerin compared with other proteins. a, repeated domains of Ebnerin (R1, R2, R3, and R6) show 72% amino acid sequence identity to the SRCR domain in WC1 (37Wijngaard P.L. Metzelaar M.J. MacHugh N.D. Morrison W.I. Clevers H.C. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3273-3277Google Scholar), 64% to CD6 (2Aruffo A. Melnick M.B. Linsley P.S. Seed B. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 949-952Google Scholar), and 47% to the macrophage scavenger receptor (SCAVR) (21Kodama T. Freeman M. Rohrer L. Zabrecky J. Matsudaira P. Krieger M. Nature. 1990; 343: 531-535Google Scholar). b, the repeated domains of R4, R5, and R7 show 30% amino acid identity to bone morphogenetic type-I (BMP-1) protein (9Fukagawa M. Suzuki N. Hogan B.L. Jones C.M. Dev. Biol. 1994; 163: 175-183Google Scholar), 32% to metalloendopeptidase (MEPD) (5Elaroussi M.A. DeLuca H.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 1-8Google Scholar), 33% to serum-inducible protein (PS4E) (6Feng P. Liau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21453-21454Google Scholar), and 34% to enteropeptidase precursor (ENPR) (27Matsushima M. Ichinose M. Yahagi N. Kakei N. Tsukada S. Miki K. Kurokawa K. Tashiro K. Shiokawa K. Shinomiya K. Umeyama H. Inoue H. Takahashi T. Takahashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19976-19982Google Scholar). c, the extracellular region near the transmembrane domain of Ebnerin (F3) shows 12.3% and 22% amino acid identity to the zona pellucida region of the glycoprotein in pancreatic secretory granule membranes (GP-2) (10Fukuoka S.

Goeddel D.V. Science. 1987; 236: 83-88Google Scholar), respectively. Amino acids in Ebnerin that are identical to other proteins are in bold type, and conserved cysteine residues are indicated by asterisks above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Localization of Ebnerin mRNAWe conducted Northern blot analysis of Ebnerin in a variety of tissues (Fig. 3). The most prominent expression of Ebnerin mRNA occurs in VEG with an intense band at about 4.5-5 kilobase pairs. Circumvallate papillae tissue displays a similarly intense band of the same size. Because circumvallate papillae tissue contains VEG tissue, this band probably derives from contaminating VEG material. Tissue of the olfactory epithelium and the lateral nasal gland displays less intense bands that are slightly smaller than those in VEG. We fail to detect mRNA expression in any other tissue examined including epithelium from the frontal region of the tongue, tongue tissue that is devoid of VEG, or in parotid gland, submaxillary gland, liver, lung, kidney, colon, testes, brain, and spleen.Figure 3:Tissue distribution of Ebnerin mRNA analyzed by Northern blot. 20 μg of total RNA from various rat tissues were loaded on each lane and hybridized with Ebnerin cDNA probe under high stringency. The blot was exposed to x-ray film for 24 h. TE, tongue epithelium; VEG, von Ebner's gland; CV, circumvallate papillae; PG, parotid gland; SG, submaxillary gland; LNG, lateral nasal gland; Olf, olfactory epithelial tissues. An mRNA species of approximately 5 kilobases was detected in VEG, circumvallate papillae, lateral nasal gland, and olfactory epithelial tissues.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In situ hybridization reveals discrete localizations of Ebnerin mRNA (Fig. 4). Autoradiographic grains are highly localized to VEG located immediately beneath the circumvallate papillae. Higher power magnification reveals very high levels of grains associated with the openings of the ducts of VEG.Figure 4:a, In situ hybridization of 33P-Ebnerin cRNA probe on tongue in saggital section (×10).

Note that the hybridization signals are confined to the duct opening in VEG.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Localization of Ebnerin ProteinWe developed an antiserum to an 18-amino-acid peptide in the repeat domain that is homologous to bone morphogenetic protein-I. Western blot analysis reveals a single immunoreactive band of 210 kDa that occurs only in VEG. HEK293 cells transfected with cDNA for Ebnerin display a band of about 170 kDa, whereas untransfected cells have no immunoreactivity (Fig. 5a). The fact that native Ebnerin is larger than transfected protein could be due to N-glycosylation of protein in VEG or an additional N-terminal peptide not revealed by cDNA cloning. We detect no immunoreactivity in tongue tissue lacking VEG or in kidney, lung, brain, or colon. Preabsorption with the immunizing peptide eliminates immunoreactivity (Fig. 5b). Western blots also reveal more intensive immunoreactivity in soluble proteins than the particulate form in VEG. The molecular mass of protein in secretions from VEG is about 4-5 kDa smaller than in VEG (Fig. 5c)Figure 5:Western blot analysis of Ebnerin. a, protein (100 μg/lane) extracted from a variety of tissues was separated by electrophoresis on a 4-12% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter.

Staining is also evident in the clefts in apical portions of the circumvallate papillae. Preabsorption with the immunizing peptide abolishes immunoreactivity. High magnification reveals staining selectively localized to the apical region of the taste buds. Staining is also evident at the openings of the ducts of VEG. In the VEG itself intense staining overlies the epithelium of the ducts of the gland, whereas the acinar tissue does not stain.Figure 6:Immunohistochemical localization of Ebnerin in rat tongue. Antibodies (1:200) (a) and antibodies preabsorbed with peptide antigen (20 μg/ml) (b) were incubated with rat tongue tissue sections containing circumvallate papillae (CV) and VEG. Note in a the intense immunoreactivity in the VEG, its duct opening, the cleft of circumvallate papillae, and the surface of tongue epithelium (TE). Taste buds (TB) are located near the duct openings of VEG (×100). c, higher magnification of circumvallate papillae section immunostained for Ebnerin antibodies. The intense immunoreactivity is in the cleft of circumvallate papillae where taste buds are located (×400). d, higher magnification of the VEG section immunostained for Ebnerin. Note that intense immunoreactivity is confined to the epithelial cells of secretory ducts (SD) and is absent from secretory acini (SA) (×400).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONIn the present study we have identified and cloned the cDNA for a novel protein, Ebnerin, selectively expressed and released by VEG, which is the sole salivary gland providing secretion directly to taste buds. Ebnerin displays substantial homology to a number of proteins. The greatest homology lies in four repeated domains that correspond to the scavenger receptor cysteine rich (SRCR) domain of a variety of proteins. Some of these proteins are expressed on the surfaces of cells involved in host defense mechanisms of the immune system, such as T cells, B cells, and macrophages, and exemplified by the macrophage scavenger receptor proteins. Others are secreted and appear to participate in host defense, such as complement factor I C1r and C1s (18Journet A. Tosi M. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 783-787Google Scholar; 26Mackinnon C.M. Carter P.E. Smyth S.J. Dunbar B. Fothergill J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 169: 547-553Google Scholar), cyclophilin C-binding protein (8Friedman J. Trahey M. Weissman I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6815-6819Google Scholar), or MAC II-binding protein (22Koths K. Taylor E. Halenbeck R. Casipit C. Wang A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14245-14249Google Scholar). Members of this family are expressed in a wide range of organisms from mammals to invertebrates. A prominent member of the family is a speract receptor that occurs in sea urchin sperm and binds speract, the sperm-activating peptide secreted by eggs and involved in the chemotaxis of sea urchin eggs and sperm (3Bleil J.D. Wassarman P.M. Cell. 1980; 20: 873-882Google Scholar; 19Kinloch R.A. Roller R.J. Fimiani C.M. Wassarman D.A. Wassarman P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 85: 6409-6413Google Scholar; Lepage et al., 1992). The SRCR family resembles the immunoglobulin superfamily of proteins with multiple copies of cysteine-rich domains occurring both in secreted and membrane-associated proteins.Because members of the SRCR family bind proteins and other ligands, it is possible that Ebnerin possesses a similar function. It is unclear whether the SRCR domains would be involved in ligand binding. They do not appear to participate in ligand binding of the macrophage scavenger receptor (Rohrer et al., 1990). However, almost the entire extracellular domain of the speract receptor comprises SRCR domains, which presumably mediate binding to speract secreted by eggs (Kinloch et al., 1992; Lepage et al., 1992). Interestingly, the C-terminal region of Ebnerin displays modest homology to the zona pellucida protein, which is released by eggs and interacts with the sperm outer membrane. It is unclear whether the coincidence of homology with egg and sperm signaling proteins in the Ebnerin sequence has physiological relevance.Ebnerin also possesses three repeated domains that display 30-35% amino acid identity to domains that are held in common by bone morphogenetic protein-I, complement I receptor, and the Drosophila protein Tolloid, which determines dorsal-ventral patterning (Wozney et al., 1988; 35Shimell M.J. Ferguson E.L. Childs S.R. O'Connor M.B. Cell. 1991; 67: 469-481Google Scholar). The repeated domain that is common to these proteins and Ebnerin is thought to play a role in ligand binding (Shimell et al., 1991).Despite its putative transmembrane domain, Ebnerin exists mainly as a soluble protein. The putative transmembrane domain may participate in translocation of Ebnerin to the plasma membrane where the cleavage of this domain would occur in analogy to other membrane-anchored secretory proteins such as granule secretory proteins and uromodulin (31Rindler M.J. Naik S.S. Li N. Hoops T.C. Peraldi M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20784-20789Google Scholar; Fukuoka et al., 1991; 15Hoops T.C. Rindler M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4257-4263Google Scholar). The cleavage might occur through glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored regions or at a lysine-lysine bond. In such a cleavage the very short cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains would be removed, giving rise to a smaller protein, consistent with Western blots in which proteins that are collected from fluids on the apical region of circumvallate papillae are smaller than in VEG.The selective localization of Ebnerin in cells of the ducts of VEG but not in the acinar cells distinguishes Ebnerin from lipase, mucin, and other proteins secreted by the acinar cells of salivary glands (Hamosh & Scow, 1973; Field & Hand, 1987). It is unclear whether Ebnerin primarily binds to soluble proteins or other tastants or preferentially binds directly to surface proteins of the taste buds. One protein that might interact with Ebnerin is the von Ebner's gland protein that is also a secretory protein specifically expressed in von Ebner's gland and whose sequence resembles that of the odorant-binding protein (34Schmale H. Holtgreve-Grez H. Christiansen H. Nature. 1990; 343: 366-369Google Scholar; 30Pevsner J. Reed R.R. Feinstein P.G. Snyder S.H. Science. 1988; 241: 336-339Google Scholar). Growth hormone is secreted by the parotid and submaxillary salivary glands, (1Amano O. Yoshino Y. Nishikawa K. Iseki S. Cell Tissue Res. 1993; 273: 467-474Google Scholar; 16Humphreys-beher M.G. Macauley S.P. Chegini N. van Setten G. Purushotham K. Stewart C. Wheeler T.T. Schultz G.S. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 963-970Google Scholar), but this possibility has not been investigated for VEG. The structural similarity of Ebnerin to binding proteins for growth hormone such as bone morphogenetic protein-I (Fukagawa et al., 1994) and transforming growth factor β receptor III (Lopez-Casillas, 1991; Wang et al., 1991; Moren et al., 1992) suggests that it might serve as a carrier for putative growth factors produced by VEG. INTRODUCTIONSaliva is the first digestive fluid secreted by the gastrointestinal pathway and performs a variety of functions. It is essential in the formation of small boluses of food, provides lubrication for swallowing and speech, dissolves a number of chemicals in food substances, and provides digestive enzymes such as amylase and lipase (12Hamosh M. Scow R.O. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 88-95Google Scholar; 7Field R.B. Hand A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: G217-G225Google Scholar). About 90% of saliva is produced by three major glands, the parotid, the submaxillary, and the sublingual glands, whose secretions drain into the oral cavity. von Ebner's glands are unique salivary glands contained within the tongue that drain directly into the clefts of the circumvallate and foliate papillae, which contain the major taste buds. Secretions of von Ebner's gland directly modulate taste perception (11Gurkan S. Bradley R.M. Chem. Senses. 1988; 13: 655-661Google Scholar). Although von Ebner's gland is known to secrete certain proteins, such as lipase, very little is known of the protein composition of the gland's secretions or the molecular mechanisms whereby they influence taste perception. In the present study we have identified a novel von Ebner's gland protein, designated Ebnerin, which appears to be formed in the ducts of von Ebner's gland and released into fluid bathing the taste buds contained in the taste papillae.

https://openalex.org/W2038113019,"To investigate the role of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in modulating the activity and location of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, we used site-directed mutagenesis to construct four mutant forms of cytidylyltransferase. These forms were 5SP ⟶ AP, in which five of the seven Ser-Pro sequences were converted to Ala-Pro; 7SP ⟶ AP, in which all of the seven Ser-Pro sequences converted to Ala-Pro; 16S ⟶ A, in which all sixteen Ser residues that can be phosphorylated in wild type cytidylyltransferase were converted to Ala; and 16S ⟶ E, in which all sixteen Ser residues were converted to Glu. The mutant enzymes were expressed in the strain 58 Chinese hamster ovary cell line, which is temperature-sensitive for growth and cytidylyltransferase activity. All mutant enzyme forms were enzymatically as active as the wild type when assayed under optimal conditions. In untreated cells, more of the Ser ⟶ Ala mutants were membrane-associated than in cells expressing wild type enzyme, consistent with the phosphorylation state of the enzyme affecting its affinity for membranes. About half of the 16S ⟶ A mutant remained soluble, however, indicating that dephosphorylation alone does not trigger membrane association. Although the amount of membrane-associated enzyme in the 16S ⟶ A mutant was about 10-fold greater than that of wild type, phosphatidylcholine synthesis was increased by only about 75%, suggesting that membrane association does not necessarily cause full activation. All mutant forms, including the 16S ⟶ E mutant, translocated to the particulate fraction upon oleate treatment, indicating that a high negative charge in the phosphorylation region does not preclude association of cytidylyltransferase with membranes. All mutant enzymes were able to support growth of strain 58 at 40°C, and the rate of phosphatidylcholine synthesis was not greatly altered in the cell lines expressing mutant cytidylyltransferase forms. These results are consistent with a role for phosphorylation in the equilibrium distribution of cytidylyltransferase but suggest that changes in enzyme activity and location are not triggered exclusively by changes in the phosphorylation state.

CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase catalyzes the conversion of phosphocholine to CDP-choline, an important regulatory step for phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis in mammalian cells(1Kent C. Prog.

Cytidylyltransferase is mainly regulated at the post-transcriptional level, although alterations in mRNA levels for cytidylyltransferase have been reported(2Houweling M. Tijburg L.B. Vaartjes W.J.

Activation of cytidylyltransferase is accompanied by conversion to the particulate form (1Kent C. Prog. Lipid Res. 1990; 29: 87-105Google Scholar) or, in some cells, to a soluble lipoprotein complex(7Weinhold P.A. Charles L. Rounsifer M.E. Feldman D.A. J. Biol.

Soluble cytidylyltransferase is highly phosphorylated(16Watkins J.D. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2190-2197Google Scholar); 15-16 Ser residues near the carboxyl terminus have been determined to be the phosphorylation sites in baculovirus-expressed cytidylyltransferase (17MacDonald J.I. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10529-10537Google Scholar). Activation and translocation to the membrane are accompanied by extensive dephosphorylation(18Watkins J.D. Kent C. J. Biol.

Although it appears that phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are key components in the inactivation and activation of cytidylyltransferase, the precise contribution of the phosphorylation state of cytidylyltransferase to its activity and location are presently unknown. Treatment of CHO1 1The abbreviations used are: CHOChinese hamster ovaryPCRpolymerase chain reaction. cells with okadaic acid, an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 and 2A, prevents dephosphorylation and translocation of cytidylyltransferase in response to phospholipase C, indicating that protein dephosphorylation is a necessary component of activation(18Watkins J.D. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21113-21117Google Scholar). It is not clear, however, whether the protein that must be dephosphorylated is cytidylyltransferase or another protein involved in the transduction of the signal from exogenous phospholipase C to cytidylyltransferase. Okadaic acid does not block translocation and dephosphorylation of cytidylyltransferase in HeLa cells stimulated with oleate(19Wang Y. MacDonald J.I. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5512-5518Google Scholar), suggesting either that the target of okadaic acid in the CHO cell system is a protein distinct from cytidylyltransferase or that different protein phosphatases activate cytidylyltransferase in the different cell systems. Chinese hamster ovary polymerase chain reaction. To approach the role of protein phosphorylation in the function and location of cytidylyltransferase, we have chosen to use site-directed mutagenesis of the phosphorylation sites followed by expression of the mutant enzymes in a heterologous cell. We previously found that a suitable expression system is the strain 58 CHO cell line, in which endogenous cytidylyltransferase is temperature-sensitive and is present at very low levels even at the permissive temperature(5Wang Y. Sweitzer T.D. Weinhold P.A. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5899-5904Google Scholar, 20Esko J.D. Raetz C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5192-5196Google Scholar, 21Esko J.D. Wermuth M.M. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7388-7393Google Scholar). We first mutated a putative casein kinase II site, Ser362, to Ala and found that this change did not affect the activity of cytidylyltransferase, its ability to translocate upon stimulation of cells expressing the mutant, or its ability to support growth of the transfected cells at 40°C(22Sweitzer T.D. Kent C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 107-116Google Scholar). Subsequent analysis of additional mutants in which only a single site was mutated also revealed little, if any, change in cytidylyltransferase function or location.2 2Y. Wang, F. Shi, and C. Kent, unpublished observations. In the present study, we characterized mutants in which 5-16 phosphorylation sites were altered. We report that, although these modifications dramatically altered the phosphorylation state of cytidylyltransferase and in some cases modified its location, the activation state of the enzyme was not appreciably altered. Sodium oleate, Ham's F-12 medium, and phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were from Sigma. 32Pi (400-800 mCi/ml) was from ICN. [methyl-3H]Choline chloride and [methyl-14C]choline chloride were from Amersham Corp. Protein A agarose, Lipofectin reagent, and G418 were from Life Technologies, Inc. QIAGEN supplied a plasmid purification kit. The pCMV5 vector was a gift from Dr. David Russell, University of Texas. All other reagents were from previously described sources(17MacDonald J.I. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10529-10537Google Scholar, 19Wang Y. MacDonald J.I. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5512-5518Google Scholar). To make the 5SP ⟶ AP and 7SP ⟶ AP mutants, the HindIII-XbaI fragment of cytidylyltransferase from pCMV4RCCT (22Sweitzer T.D. Kent C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 107-116Google Scholar) was transferred into the pAlter vector of the Promega Altered Sites mutagenesis system. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out to construct a 4SP ⟶ AP mutant; the oligonucleotides were 5′-ATGAGTAGGGGCGCTGCTGGGAGCCTGCTTGGA for S319A,S323A and 5′-TGCTGGGGCGGAAGATGGGGCAGTCTTGC for S343A,S347A. The HindIII-XbaI fragment was then transferred to M13mp19, and the Amersham in vitro mutagenesis kit was used to convert Ser315 to Ala with the oligonucleotide 5′-GCTTGGGAGCGATGGCCT to give 5SP ⟶ AP. The 7SP ⟶ AP mutation was then constructed with 5SP ⟶ AP as template and 5′-GGAGGGGGCGGGGGCGCGCTCAT as the mutagenic oligonucleotide to introduce S329A and S331A. The resulting mutant constructs were sequenced entirely to ensure that only the desired mutants were obtained. The HindIII-XbaI fragments were then cloned into the HindIII-XbaI site of pCMV5. The strategy for making the 16S ⟶ A and 16S ⟶ E mutants was to use multiple-round PCR to make a mutated fragment that became longer at the COOH terminus with each round; the COOH-terminal primer for the second through the fifth rounds overlapped with the COOH-terminal primer from the previous round. The first round introduced mutations at Ser residues 315, 319, 321, 322, and 323; the second round introduced mutations at Ser residues 329, 331, and 333; the third round introduced mutations at Ser residues 339, 343, 345, 346, and 347; the fourth round introduced mutations at Ser residues 350 and 352; and the fifth round introduced the mutation at Ser residue 362. The template for the PCR was pCMV5CT, which was constructed by subcloning the HindIII-XbaI fragment of cytidylyltransferase from pCMV4RCCT into the pCMV5 HindIII-XbaI site. The PCR program was 92°C for 1 min, 52°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 2 min for 20 cycles for each round. The NH2-terminal primer for all rounds, corresponding to the first 16 base pairs of the coding region for cytidylyltransferase, was 5′-CGCGGATCCAGATCTATGGGATGCACAGAGTTCA. For the first round, wild type rat liver cytidylyltransferase cDNA in plasmid pCMV5CT was used as template; the COOH-terminal primers were 5′-GAGTAGGGGCGGCGGCGGGAGCCTGCTTGGGAGCGATGGCCTGCAGCAT for 16S ⟶ A and 5′-ATGAGTAGGTTCCTCTTCGGGTTCCTGCTTGGGTTCGATGGCCTGCAGCAT for 16S ⟶ E. The PCR product from the first round was separated from wild type template by agarose gel electrophoresis and used as the second round PCR template. For the second round the COOH-terminal primers were 5′-GGCCACCGAAAGGCGGGGGCGGGGGCGCGCTCATGAGTAGGGGCGGCGG for 16S ⟶ A and 5′-GAAGGGCCACCGAAATTCAGGCTCGGGTTCGCGCTCATGAGTAGGTTCCTC for 16S ⟶ E. The template for the third, fourth, and fifth rounds were the PCR products from the previous rounds. The COOH-terminal primers for the third round were 5′-TGGGGCGGCAGCTGGGGCAGTCTTGCCAGCGAAGGGCCACCGAAAGGCG for 16S ⟶ A and 5′-TTCTGCTGGTTCCTCTTCTGGTTCAGTCTTGCCTTCGAAGGGCCACCGAAA for 16S ⟶ E. The COOH-terminal primers for the fourth round were 5′-CACAGGTCACAGCCTTGCACCTAGCGAGAGCTGCTGGGGCGGCAGCTGG for 16S ⟶ A and 5′-GATGTCACAGGTCACAGCCTTGCACCTTTCGAGTTCTTGCTGGTTCCTC for 15S ⟶ E. The COOH-terminal primers for the fifth round were 5′-TGCTCTAGATTAGTCCTCTTCATCCTCGGCGATGTCACAGGTCACAGCCT for 16S ⟶ A and 5′-TGCTCTAGATTAGTCCTCTTCATCCTCTTCGATGTCACAGGTCAC for 16S ⟶ E. The final PCR products were purified and subcloned into the BamHI and XbaI sites of M13mp19. The 0.6-kilobase pair EcoRV-XbaI fragment of the COOH-terminal portion of the cDNA (23Kalmar G.B. Kay R.J. Lachance A. Aebersold R. Cornell R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6029-6033Google Scholar) was sequenced to ensure that no undesired mutation occurred during the multiple-round reactions. The EcoRV-XbaI portions were then subcloned into pCMV5CT, from which the EcoRV-XbaI portion had been removed; the resulting plasmids were pCMV5CT16S ⟶ A and pCMV5CT16S ⟶ E. All of the constructed plasmids were purified with the QIAGEN Maxi-kit. CHO strain 58 cells were cultured with Ham's F-12 medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum at 34°C with 5% CO2. Stably transfected cell lines were cultured with the same medium for experiments and with the addition of 20 mM HEPES and 0.8 mg/ml G418 for regular maintenance. Cells were plated at 1 × 106 cells/60-mm dish for 1 day at 34°C before experiments unless otherwise specified. Wild type and mutant constructs of cytidylyltransferase were transfected into CHO 58 cells with Lipofectin as recommended by the manufacturer. Cells were plated at 2 × 105 cells/60-mm dish, cultured for 1 day, and then incubated with Lipofectin and the DNA overnight. The transfection was stopped by the addition of medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum, after which the cells were incubated in normal medium for 2 days. The cells were then trypsinized and subcultured in four 150-mm dishes with 0.8 mg/ml G418. Single colonies were picked, replated, and screened by indirect immunofluorescence (19Wang Y. MacDonald J.I. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5512-5518Google Scholar) for expression of cytidylyltransferase. For measuring the rate of choline incorporation into phosphatidylcholine, cells were plated at 1 × 106 cells/60-mm dish at 34°C for 1 day. The cells were then washed twice with calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in 1.5 ml of culture medium containing 2 μCi/ml [3H]choline for 0.5-2 h at either 34 or 40°C. The cells were then washed twice with calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline and harvested by scraping into 1.0 ml of H2O at 0°C. Lipids were extracted from 0.8 ml of the cell extract by the Bligh-Dyer method(24Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar). The chloroform phase containing the lipids was dried and counted. For measuring pools of phosphatidylcholine and aqueous choline metabolites, cell were plated at 2 × 105 cells/60-mm dish and incubated at 34°C for 1 day. The cells were then washed twice with calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline, fed with culture medium containing 0.5 μCi/ml [14C]choline, and incubated at 34°C for 1 more day. Maintaining the cells in the labeled medium, two dishes of each cell line were then kept at 34°C for an additional day, while two other dishes were incubated at 40°C for the additional day. The cells were then washed twice with calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline and harvested by scraping into 1 ml of H2O. Lipids and aqueous metabolites were separated by Bligh-Dyer extraction, and the lipid phase was dried and counted. Under these conditions 90% of the lipid-associated label was in phosphatidylcholine. The aqueous phase was dried, dissolved in 60 μl of methanol:H2O (1:1), and chromatographed on a silica gel G thin layer plate in methanol:5% NaCl:ammonia (50:50:1). The plates were dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen, and metabolites were quantitated in a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Labeling, immunoprecipitation, and detection of cytidylyltransferase by Western blotting and autoradiography were performed as described(19Wang Y. MacDonald J.I. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5512-5518Google Scholar). Two-dimensional peptide mapping was performed as described(17MacDonald J.I. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10529-10537Google Scholar); the electrophoresis buffer was 1% ammonium bicarbonate. Western blots were performed as described (19Wang Y. MacDonald J.I. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5512-5518Google Scholar) except that a 1:6000 dilution of amino-terminal antiserum was used as the first antibody. Cells were plated at 2.3 × 104 cells/60-mm dish and incubated for 1 day at 34°C. The cells were then incubated at 40°C for up to 5 days. Viable cell counts were determined by counting cells excluding trypan blue. Two dishes of each cell line were counted each day. Cells were fractionated into soluble and particulate fractions by use of digitonin(19Wang Y. MacDonald J.I. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5512-5518Google Scholar). Cytidylyltransferase activity was determined with previously described conditions for enzyme incubation (25Weinhold P.A. Feldman D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 248-258Google Scholar) and binding of the product to charcoal(6Morand J.N. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13785-13792Google Scholar). Cells were treated with 0.25 mM sodium oleate in F12 medium without serum for 20 min at 34°C. Under these conditions the cells were viable as determined by the exclusion of trypan blue, and the translocation of cytidylyltransferase was reversible by transfer to fresh medium without oleate. Protein was determined by the Bradford method (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). In order to test the effect of phosphorylation on the properties of cytidylyltransferase, we introduced mutations in phosphorylation sites by site-directed mutagenesis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The sequences encoded by the wild type and mutant constructs are listed in Table 1. In the 5SP ⟶ AP mutant, the Ser residues followed by Pro that are found in the repeated SPSSSP sequence plus an additional Ser followed by Pro at position 315 were changed to Ala. In the 7SP ⟶ AP mutant, the remaining two Ser residues followed by Pro were similarly modified. All 16 Ser residues from position 315 to the COOH terminus were mutated to Ala in 16S ⟶ A, so that the resulting mutant cytidylyltransferase could not be phosphorylated. The same residues were changed to Glu in 16S ⟶ E in an attempt to mimic the negatively charged phosphorylated enzyme. Stable cell lines of strain 58 CHO cells transfected with each mutant were isolated and screened with indirect immunofluorescence to monitor purity of the clones. Cytidylyltransferase was nuclear in all clones expressing either wild type cytidylyltransferase or the phosphorylation site mutants.TABLE I Open table in a new tab To determine the level of phosphorylation of the cytidylyltransferase mutants, the cells expressing the mutant enzymes were labeled with 32Pi, and the mutant enzymes were immunoprecipitated and analyzed by Western blotting and autoradiography (Fig. 1). As expected, there was no phosphorylation detected in the mutants in which all 16 phosphorylation sites were mutated either to Ala or Glu. The extents of phosphorylation of 5SP ⟶ AP and 7 SP ⟶ AP were considerably decreased. The low degree of phosphorylation in the latter two mutants suggested that one or more Pro-directed protein kinases may be important in determining whether or not other sites are modified. The labeled phosphopeptides in the partially phosphorylated cytidylyltransferase mutants were analyzed by two-dimensional peptide mapping (Fig. 2). Even though 11 phosphorylation sites remain in the 5SP ⟶ AP mutant, only two major phosphopeptides were observed for 5SP ⟶ AP. When the 5SP ⟶ AP peptides were mixed with those of the wild type, the two major peptides from 5SP ⟶ AP did not coincide with the major peptides of wild type cytidylyltransferase. Only one major phosphorylated peptide was observed with 7SP ⟶ AP. From the position of this peptide, it appears to correspond to the COOH-terminal tryptic pepide, which contains a putative casein kinase II site(22Sweitzer T.D. Kent C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 107-116Google Scholar). The minor phosphopeptide does not appear to coincide with peptides from the wild type. Because of the low amount of label associated with 7SP ⟶ AP, there was insufficient material to mix with wild type peptides. To determine if the changes in phosphorylation sites dramatically affected the catalytic ability of cytidylyltransferase, soluble and particulate fractions were assayed under optimal conditions in the presence of lipids, and the activity was normalized to the amount of cytidylyltransferase protein in the fraction as determined by immunoblotting (Table 2). Under these conditions, the activities of the cytidylyltransferase mutants were essentially the same as the activity of wild type cytidylyltransferase. The mutant enzymes required lipids for maximal activity in the assay in vitro, as does the wild type enzyme; the extent of activation of the mutant enzymes by lipids was the same as that of the wild type enzyme (data not shown).TABLE II Open table in a new tab To study the effects of the phosphorylation site mutations on the partitioning of cytidylyltransferase between soluble and membrane fractions, the cell lines expressing wild type and mutant cytidylyltransferase constructs were harvested by digitonin extraction. Cytidylyltransferase activity was determined in the presence of lipids (Table 3), and the mass of cytidylyltransferase was determined by Western blotting (Fig. 3). As judged by the activity measurements, mutation of Ser to Ala affected the distribution of cytidylyltransferase in a cumulative manner (Table 3), with the amount of membrane-associated enzyme increasing from 5% with the wild type to about 20, 30, and 40% with 5SP ⟶ AP, 7SP ⟶ AP, and 16S ⟶ A, respectively. It is notable that removal of all the phosphorylation sites, however, did not cause complete translocation to the membrane of 16S ⟶ A; about 60% of the 16S ⟶ A mutant enzyme remained soluble. As expected, conversion of all the sites to Glu resulted in a normal, soluble distribution in unstimulated cells. The Western blots agreed with the activity measurements regarding the subcellular distributions and expression levels of the mutants (Fig. 3). The 16S ⟶ E mutants had a considerably slower mobility than the 16S ⟶ A mutant. This decreased mobility is similar to the effect of phosphorylation on protein mobility and is consistent with the higher charge of this mutant cytidylyltransferase.TABLE III Open table in a new tab Fatty acid treatment causes translocation and activation of cytidylyltransferase in HeLa and other cultured cells (11Pelech S.L. Cook H.W. Paddon H.B. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 795: 433-440Google Scholar, 27Pelech S.L. Pritchard P.H. Brindley D.N. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6782-6788Google Scholar, 28Whitlon D.S. Anderson K.E. Mueller G.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 835: 369-377Google Scholar). CHO cells are much more sensitive to oleate treatment than HeLa cells, but we determined that cells remained viable when treated with 0.25 mM oleate for 20 min, which is sufficient for translocation of cytidylyltransferase. To ask if the phosphorylation mutants could translocate in response to cell stimulation, the cell lines were treated with oleate, and the distributions were determined by activity measurements and Western blots. Oleate stimulated translocation of 77% of wild type cytidylyltransferase to the particulate fraction (Table 3), and this correlated with a shift in mobility from multiple bands in the soluble fraction to a faster migrating band in the particulate fraction (Fig. 3). All of the Ser to Ala mutants translocated to a similar extent as the wild type enzyme. A considerable amount of the 16S ⟶ E mutant also translocated in response to oleate. Although the percentage of total 16S ⟶ E enzyme that translocated appeared less than that in wild type, the actual amount of membrane-associated enzyme in the 16S ⟶ E mutant was about three times higher than in wild type due to the higher level of expression of this mutant. Thus, the high negative charge in the phosphorylation region of the 16S ⟶ E mutant did not preclude its association with the membrane. Because of its temperature-sensitive cytidylyltransferase, the strain 58 cell line cannot grow or synthesize phosphatidylcholine at 40°C(20Esko J.D. Raetz C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5192-5196Google Scholar, 21Esko J.D. Wermuth M.M. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7388-7393Google Scholar). Expression of rat liver cytidylyltransferase in strain 58 cells, however, corrects the defect and allows both phosphatidylcholine synthesis and growth at 40°C (22Sweitzer T.D. Kent C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 107-116Google Scholar). All phosphorylation site mutants were capable of supporting growth of strain 58 CHO cells at 40°C (Fig. 4), consistent with the fact that these mutant enzymes retain catalytic activity (Table 2). At either 34°C or 40°C, all cell lines expressing wild type or mutant cytidylyltransferases incorporated radiolabeled choline into phosphatidylcholine far better than did untransfected strain 58 control (Fig. 5). The rates of choline incorporation relative to wild type were somewhat variable for most mutants; cells expressing 16S ⟶ A, however, always had a somewhat higher rate of choline incorporation than the wild type and other mutants. The increased choline incorporation in 16S ⟶ A, however, was far less than expected, considering there was about 10-fold more membrane-associated enzyme in these cells (Table 3). In a total of six labeling experiments, including one pulse-chase protocol, the rate of phosphatidylcholine synthesis was 74 ± 46% higher than in the wild type. This suggests that cytidylyltransferase can be membrane-associated and still be relatively inactive.Figure 5:Incorporation of choline into lipids. Cells were plated and left at 34°C for 1 day. The cells were then washed twice with calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with [3H]choline at 40°C for the indicated times. The cells were then harvested and extracted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” WT, wild type; CHO 58, untransfected strain 58 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The levels of aqueous choline metabolites were also determined at both 34 and 40°C. As expected, the phosphocholine level was high and the CDP-choline level was low for strain 58. The wild type and phosphorylation mutants had lower phosphocholine levels and higher CDP-choline levels than untransfected strain 58, which would be expected from their abilities to complement the genetic defect. There were, however, no consistent differences in metabolite levels between cells expressing the wild type enzyme and those expressing the phosphorylation site mutants (data not shown). Experiments described in this paper used site-directed mutagenesis to determine the role of phosphorylation on the properties of cytidylyltransferase. Mutations of as many as all 16 of the phosphorylated residues did not dramatically alter enzymatic activity as judged by assay in vitro in the presence of activating lipids, suggesting that the COOH-terminal phospho-rylation region does not interact closely with the more central catalytic core under these conditions. The mutations do alter the mobility of the enzyme in SDS gels, as would be expected from previous evidence showing that the slower mobility of the soluble enzyme is due to phosphorylation(18Watkins J.D. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21113-21117Google Scholar, 19Wang Y. MacDonald J.I. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5512-5518Google Scholar). Conversion of all 16 Ser residues to Ala resulted in the same mobility as the fastest form of wild type cytidylyltransferase. Conversion of the same residues to Glu resulted in a slow moving enzyme, which is consistent with the mobility differences being due to a high degree of negative charge in this region. Previous studies in which the phosphorylation sites of baculovirus-expressed cytidylyltransferase were determined by chemical sequencing failed to detect any phosphorylated residues other than the 16 Ser residues near the COOH terminus(17MacDonald J.I. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10529-10537Google Scholar). Radiolabeling with 32P of the 16S ⟶ A and 16S ⟶ E mutants confirmed the protein chemistry, indicating that no other residues are phosphorylated in these mammalian cells. Labeling of the mutants in which Ser-Pro sites were modified to Ala-Pro sites resulted in rather dramatic changes in labeling; loss of a third of the 16 phosphorylatable sites in the 5SP ⟶ AP mutant reduced labeling to only two major tryptic peptides, and loss of only two additional sites in the 7SP ⟶ AP mutant nearly eliminated labeling. These results suggest that modification by a Ser-Pro-directed protein kinase may be important for subsequent phosphorylation events by other protein kinases. This is supported by the observations of Jackowski(29Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3858-3867Google Scholar), who has shown that the phosphorylation state of cytidylyltransferase varies with the cell cycle, in which several Ser-Pro-directed kinases function. The subcellular location of the 16S ⟶ E mutant in control cells did not differ from that of the wild type enzyme, which is not surprising given that most of the wild type enzyme in control cells is soluble and highly phosphorylated. On the other hand, the subcellular location of all mutants in which Ser residues were changed to Ala was modified considerably. The specific activities of membrane-associated mutant enzymes assayed in vitro were 5-17-fold higher than that of wild type cytidylyltransferase in control cells, suggesting that dephosphorylation certainly promoted membrane association. The membrane-associated enzymes were not fully activated, however, as indicated by the lack of a dramatic increase in phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. It is not likely that the membrane-associated 16S ⟶ A enzyme was actually 10-fold more active but that the rate of phosphatidylcholine degradation was also increased, because the experiments represented in Fig. 5 were measuring initial rates of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. Furthermore, there was no increase in glycerophosphocholine levels in the 16S ⟶ A cells, suggesting that increased turnover did not occur. The amount of the 16S ⟶ A mutant that remained soluble ranged from about 40 to 60%, indicating that a completely dephosphorylated cytidylyltransferase can remain soluble. This suggests that dephosphorylation of cytidylyltransferase does not cause it to associate with the membrane but rather influences the extent of its association with the membrane. The lack of extensive phosphorylation of soluble cytidylyltransferase has previously been noted upon reversal of fatty acid treatment in HeLa cells(19Wang Y. MacDonald J.I. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5512-5518Google Scholar). Within 1 or 2 min after removal of the fatty acid, cytidylyltransferase becomes predominantly soluble but migrates with the fast mobility of the membrane associated form, indicating that it is not highly phosphorylated. It was not clear from those studies, however, if the fast moving, soluble form is partially phosphorylated. In choline-starved HepG2 cells, forms of cytidylyltransferase with similarly low levels of phosphorylation are found in both soluble and membrane fractions(14Weinhold P.A. Charles L. Feldman D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1210: 335-347Google Scholar). The fact that more of the 16S ⟶ A mutant became membrane-bound with oleate treatment lends further support to the concept that a process distinct from dephosphorylation is involved in causing the enzyme to associate with membranes. In addition, the fact that the 16S ⟶ E mutant did not seem impaired in its ability to interact with membranes indicates that a high degree of negative charge in the phosphorylation region does not preclude cytidylyltransferase from associating with membranes. Although a Glu residue would not be as highly charged as phosphoserine, the evidence implies that phosphorylation per se does not keep cytidylyltransferase soluble. This is consistent with the observation that, upon treatment of rat hepatocytes with fatty acids or phospholipase C, phosphorylated cytidylyltransferase first becomes membrane-associated and subsequently is dephosphorylated(30Houweling M. Jamil H. Hatch G.M. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7544-7551Google Scholar). Fig. 6 depicts the state of cytidylyltransferase in its various possible forms. Form I is soluble, relatively inactive, and highly phosphorylated. Form IV is membrane-associated, active, and extensively dephosphorylated. Both forms I and IV are well established from many previous studies. The forms in columns II and III are hypothetical intermediates in the transition between forms I and IV. Forms IIa-IIc would be produced in one step from form I, and forms IIIa-IIIc would be produced in one step from form IV. A in a circle and I in a square refer to the relative state of activation in the cell (active and inactive, respectively); all forms are proposed to be fully activable in vitro. The existence of the intermediate forms that are connected by arrows are supported by some evidence. Form IIa would correspond to a situation in which activation of the enzyme is not accompanied by dephosphorylation or appreciable translocation to membranes, such as in phorbol ester-treated HeLa cells(16Watkins J.D. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2190-2197Google Scholar). Form IIa may be active in a soluble form because it is activated by association with a lipoprotein complex(9Weinhold P.A. Rounsifer M.E. Charles L. Feldman D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1006: 299-310Google Scholar). Form IIb would correspond to the 16S ⟶ A mutant in control cells where much of the enzyme remains soluble. Whether such a form exists for wild type cytidylyltransferase remains to be determined. The fact that the 16S ⟶ E mutant can readily associate with membranes in oleate-treated cells supports the existence of form IIIa. Moreover, form IIIa is strongly indicated by the translocation of phosphorylated cytidylyltransferase in rat hepatocytes discussed above(30Houweling M. Jamil H. Hatch G.M. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7544-7551Google Scholar). Form IIIb, which is soluble, active, and relatively dephosphorylated, is found in choline-starved HepG2 cells (14Weinhold P.A. Charles L. Feldman D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1210: 335-347Google Scholar) and immediately after removal of oleate from HeLa cells(19Wang Y. MacDonald J.I. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5512-5518Google Scholar). Form IIIc would correspond to the 16S ⟶ A mutant that is membrane-associated but relatively inactive in control cells. We are not aware of evidence supporting form IIc, in which inactive, phosphorylated cytidylyltransferase is membrane-associated, but such a form cannot yet be ruled out. Although evidence suggests that these various forms can exist, the preferred route of interconversion of forms I and IV is not yet clear. Multiple pathways may operate in some circumstances. For example, the route of formation for form IIIb in choline-starved cells may be I ⟶ IIa ⟶ IIIa ⟶ IV ⟶ IIIb. The fact that membrane-associated 16S ⟶ A is not fully activated suggests that an additional component in the membrane is required to activate the enzyme. The question as to what causes activation of cytidylyltransferase in vivo is currently unresolved, but much evidence supports the concept that a suitably altered change in membrane lipid content can activate cytidylyltransferase(1Kent C. Prog. Lipid Res. 1990; 29: 87-105Google Scholar, 31Jamil H. Hatch G.M. Vance D.E. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 419-427Google Scholar). What role, if any, does phosphorylation play? It seems evident that phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are not the triggers to inactivate and activate, respectively, cytidylyltransferase. The phosphorylation state of the enzyme, however, may be important for stabilizing it in either its soluble or membrane-associated forms. This in turn would shift the equilibrium between soluble and membrane forms, serving to promote the continued activation or inactivation of the enzyme. We thank Jharna Saha for technical assistance."

In macrophage-phagocytosing zymosan particles, MacMARCKS was concentrated around nascent phagosomes as detected by immunofluorescent microscopy. The effector domain of MacMARCKS contains the phosphorylation sites, a calmodulin binding site, as well as a putative actin binding site. Stable J774 macrophage cell lines constitutively expressing effector domain deletion mutants of MacMARCKS were generated. When given zymosan particles, these transfectants showed approximately a 90% reduction in their phagocytic capacity. The receptor-mediated endocytosis of acetylated low density lipoproteins, however, was not affected by the mutant. These results strongly suggest the involvement of MacMARCKS in macrophage phagocytosis. A major protein kinase C substrate, MacMARCKS (F52, MPR), was examined for its role in phagocytosis.

These results strongly suggest the involvement of MacMARCKS in macrophage phagocytosis. Macrophage phagocytosis requires efficient signal transduction from the phagocytic receptors to the actin-based cytoskeleton. Such signals induce a massive membrane-cytoskeleton rearrangement(1Silverstein S.C. Greenberg S. Di Virgilio F. Steinberg T.H. Paul W.E. Fundamental Immunology. Raven Press Ltd., New York1989: 703-720Google Scholar), providing the motile force to drive the internalization of particles. This process is accompanied by the formation of pseudopodia (3Griffin F.M. Griffin J.A. Leider J.E. Silverstein S.C. J. Exp. Med. 1975; 142: 1263-1282Google Scholar, 4Griffin F.M. Griffin J.A. Silverstein S.C. J. Exp. Med. 1976; 144: 788-809Google Scholar) or membrane ruffles(5Francis C.L. Ryan T.A Jones B.D. Smith S.J. Falkow S. Nature. 1993; 364: 639-642Google Scholar), and F-actin is essential for the internalization of ligand-coated particles(4Griffin F.M. Griffin J.A. Silverstein S.C. J. Exp. Med. 1976; 144: 788-809Google Scholar, 6Zigmond S.H. Hirsch J.G. Exp. Cell Res. 1972; 73: 383-393Google Scholar, 7Greenberg S. Di Virgilio F. El-Khoury J. Silverstein S.C. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 453aGoogle Scholar). However, the signals that induce actin-cytoskeleton rearrangements and the mechanism of such a rearrangement are not yet identified. A number of cytoskeleton-associated proteins, such as talin (8Greenberg S. Burridge K. Silverstein S.C. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1853-1856Google Scholar) and paxillin(9Greenberg S. Chang P. Silverstein S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3897-3902Google Scholar), have been implicated in this process. Tyrosine phosphorylation is part of the signal transduction pathway(s)(10Mitchell M.A. Huang M.M. Chien P. Indik Z.K. Pan X.Q. Schreiber A.D. Blood. 1994; 84: 1753-1759Google Scholar). Another major signal transduction pathway involved in macrophage phagocytosis requires protein kinase C (PKC).1 1The abbreviations used are: PKCprotein kinase CMARCKSmyristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substratePBSphosphate-buffered salineIEF-SDS-PAGEisoelectrofocusing and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresisLDLlow density lipoproteinAcLDLacetylated LDLEDeffector domain deletion mutant of MacMARCKSFMfull-length wild type MacMARCKSPVDFpolyvinylidene difluoride. Activation of PKC with phorbol esters profoundly enhances phagocytosis mediated both by C3 receptors (11Wright S.D. Silverstein S.C. J. Exp. Med. 1982; 156: 1149-1164Google Scholar) and Fc receptors(12Gresham H.D. Zheleznyak A. Mormol J.S. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7819-7826Google Scholar, 13Zheleznyak A. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12042-12048Google Scholar). However, little is known about the events after PKC activation, nor is it known how the PKC signal is transduced to the cytoskeleton to initiate the internalization of particles. One approach to these questions is to investigate the role of PKC substrates in these processes. protein kinase C myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate phosphate-buffered saline isoelectrofocusing and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis low density lipoprotein acetylated LDL effector domain deletion mutant of MacMARCKS full-length wild type MacMARCKS polyvinylidene difluoride. Among the PKC substrates, the MARCKS (myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate) family has received much attention. MARCKS is a membrane-associated, actin-binding protein with ubiquitous distribution (reviewed in (14Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 71: 713-716Google Scholar) and (15Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1501-1504Google Scholar)). Its membrane association and actin binding activities are regulated both by Ca2+/calmodulin and by PKC-mediated phosphorylation(16Thelen M. Rosen A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Nature. 1991; 351: 320-322Google Scholar, 17Hartwig J.H. Thelen M. Rosen A. Janmey P.A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Nature. 1992; 356: 618-622Google Scholar). As an actin-binding protein, it is involved in a number of actin-cytoskeleton-related cellular activities, such as motility (18Hinrichsen R.D. Blackshear P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1585-1589Google Scholar) and secretion(19Sawai T. Negishi M. Nishigaki N. Ohno T. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1995-2000Google Scholar). Besides MARCKS, macrophages also express another member of the MARCKS family of PKC substrate, MacMARCKS/F52/MPR(20Li J. Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 70: 791-801Google Scholar, 21Blackshear P.J. Verghese G.M. Johnson J.D. Haupt D.M. Stumpo D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13540-13546Google Scholar, 22Umekage T. Kato K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 286: 147-151Google Scholar). The synthesis and phosphorylation of MacMARCKS in macrophages are dramatically increased when macrophages encounter bacteria(20Li J. Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 70: 791-801Google Scholar), a finding that suggests the potential role of this protein in macrophage defense against infection. A comparison of primary structure shows similar domain organization between MacMARCKS and MARCKS. They both contain a myristoylated membrane targeting domain that is important for the membrane association of these proteins(20Li J. Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 70: 791-801Google Scholar, 23George D.J. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24879-24885Google Scholar, 24Graff J.M. Gordon J.I. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1989; 246: 503-506Google Scholar). These two proteins also share an almost identical basic domain that contains PKC phosphorylation sites and calmodulin and actin binding sites(20Li J. Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 70: 791-801Google Scholar, 21Blackshear P.J. Verghese G.M. Johnson J.D. Haupt D.M. Stumpo D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13540-13546Google Scholar, 25Kim J. Blackshear P.J. Johnson J.D. McLaughlin S. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 227-237Google Scholar). This basic domain is therefore called the effector domain. In vitro experiments have shown that MacMARCKS binds calmodulin in a phosphorylation-dependent manner(20Li J. Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 70: 791-801Google Scholar, 21Blackshear P.J. Verghese G.M. Johnson J.D. Haupt D.M. Stumpo D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13540-13546Google Scholar). Such regulated calmodulin binding activity has been demonstrated with a similar protein, neuromodulin(26Liu Y. Storm D.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 107-111Google Scholar). However, whether MacMARCKS interacts with actin is yet to be determined. The in vivo function of MacMARCKS is the focus of the current study. We report that MacMARCKS protein is highly enriched on phagosomes containing zymosan particles. We further generated an effector domain deletion mutant of MacMARCKS (ED). Expression of this mutant showed a dominant negative effect and dramatically reduced the phagocytic activity of J774 macrophage cells toward zymosan particles. The J774.a1 macrophage cell line was obtained from ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Zymosan A (Catalogue No. Z4250) and fluorescein-conjugated phalloidin (Catalogue No. P5282) were purchased from Sigma. Fluorescein-conjugated zymosan particles (Catalogue No. Z2841), Dil-conjugated low density lipoprotein (LDL) (Catalogue No. L3484), and Texas Red™-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Catalogue No. T2767) were purchased from Molecular Probes. Rabbit anti-MacMARCKS antibody was originally generated in Dr. A. Aderem's laboratory (Rockefeller University). Anti-Fcγ (2.4G2) and anti-CD11b (M1/70) were kindly provided by Dr. R. Steinman (Rockefeller University). To obtain a cDNA construct encoding the effector domain-deleted MacMARCKS, two fragments flanking this domain were generated using polymerase chain reaction. One fragment encoded amino acids 1-85, and another encoded amino acids 109-200 of MacMARCKS. The two fragments were then ligated through the MluI sites. The mutant DNA was then inserted into a eukaryotic expression vector (p463) (27Costa T.E. Franke R.R. Sanchez M. Misulovin Z. Nussenzweig M.C. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1669-1676Google Scholar) that was kindly provided by Dr. M. Nussenzweig (Rockefeller University). The final DNA construct was then electroporated into J774 cells as described(28Stacey K.J. Ross I.L. Hume D.A. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1993; 71: 75-85Google Scholar). The transfected cells were subjected to G418 (800 μg/ml) selection 48 h later. After selection, positive clones were randomly picked, and the expression was examined by two-dimensional isoelectrofocusing and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (IEF-SDS-PAGE)(29O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Google Scholar, 30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Then the proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore Catalogue No. IPVH304F0) followed by immunoblotting with anti-MacMARCKS antibodies. The anti-MacMARCKS antiserum recognizes both mutant protein and the wild type protein with the same efficiency (data not shown). For simplification, ED is used to refer the effector domain deletion mutant of MacMARCKS. As a control, cDNA encoding full-length MacMARCKS was also inserted into vector p463 and transfected into J774 cells using the above method. Again, for simplification, FM is used to refer to the full length MacMARCKS. Parental J774 cells, FM control cells, and ED mutant cells were cultured on coverslips overnight. Zymosan particles were added to the culture at a final concentration of 25 μg/ml. The cells were allowed to bind zymosan particles for 45 min at 12°C, and ingestion was allowed to proceed for 15 min at 37°C. After fixation with 10% formalin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min at 4°C, the cells were permeabilized with acetone at −20°C for 5 min. MacMARCKS was visualized with affinity-purified rabbit anti-MacMARCKS antibody followed by Texas Red™-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG as described(31Rosen A. Keenan K.F. Thelen M. Nairn A.C. Aderem A.A. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1211-1215Google Scholar). To visualize F-actin at the same time, fluorescein-conjugated phalloidin was added to cells at a concentration of 10 ng/μl together with secondary antibody. To assay the attachment index of macrophages, the cells were incubated with 25-μg zymosan particles at 12°C for 45 min. After three washes in PBS, the cells were fixed, and attached zymosan particles were counted. To assay the phagocytic activity of macrophages, the cells were given zymosan particles for 1 h at 37°C to achieve maximum uptake (32Greenberg S. El Khoury J. Kaplan E. Silverstein S.C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 115-122Google Scholar) and to verify that ED mutant cells did not phagocytose more slowly than the FM control cells and parental J774 cells. After fixation, the internalized zymosan particles were counted in samples from three parallel experiments. At least 300 cells were counted in each sample. The internalized zymosan particles can be distinguished easily by their refractile appearance in phagocytic vacuoles(33Speert D.P. Silverstein S.C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1985; 38: 655-658Google Scholar). This assay was adopted from Liao et al.(34Liao G. Simone J. Simon S.R. Blood. 1994; 83: 2294-2304Google Scholar). J774 cells cultured in 60-mm dishes were allowed to ingest fluorescein-conjugated zymosan particles for 1 h at 37°C. Most of the excess zymosan particles was removed by three washes in PBS. The cells were then treated with trypsin/EDTA for 1.5 h at 37°C to free any bound zymosan from the cell surface and cells from the plate. After fixation with 10% formalin, the cells were analyzed using flow cytometry at 488 nm. Free zymosan particles were distinguished from cells containing zymosan by their different light scattering behavior. This assay was adopted from Suzuki et al.(35Suzuki K. Sakata N. Kitani A. Hara M. Hirose T. Hirose W. Norioka K. Harigai M. Kawagoe M. Nakamura H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1042: 210-216Google Scholar). J774 cells in 60-mm dishes were starved in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 30 min before adding acetylated LDL (AcLDL). Dil-conjugated AcLDL was then added to the culture to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. The cells were cultured for an additional 30 min before being washed in PBS twice and fixed in 10% formalin. The uptakes of Dil-AcLDL were determined by flow cytometry. We first examined the subcellular localization of MacMARCKS during uptake of zymosan particles. The J774 cell line was used in this study for two reasons. First, J774 cells express endogenous MacMARCKS. Second, they have been used in previous studies of the phagocytosis of zymosan(33Speert D.P. Silverstein S.C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1985; 38: 655-658Google Scholar). Unopsonized zymosan particles are phagocytosed by macrophages through multiple receptors such as complement and mannose receptors, as well as through potential unidentified receptors(33Speert D.P. Silverstein S.C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1985; 38: 655-658Google Scholar, 36Ross G.D. Cain J.A. Lachmann P.J. J. Immunol. 1985; 134: 3307-3315Google Scholar). Thus, these particles are particularly suitable for simultaneously monitoring phagocytosis via multiple receptors. To visualize MacMARCKS protein, polyclonal rabbit anti-MacMARCKS antibodies were affinity-purified as described(31Rosen A. Keenan K.F. Thelen M. Nairn A.C. Aderem A.A. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1211-1215Google Scholar), and their specificity was demonstrated by three criteria. First, the antibodies immunoprecipitated a single smear band from 32Pi-labeled total J774 cell lysate (Fig. 1A). Second, they recognized a single protein (doublet) on a Western blot of total J774 cell lysate resolved on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A). MacMARCKS has been shown to appear as a smear band or doublet on SDS-PAGE(20Li J. Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 70: 791-801Google Scholar, 37Aderem A.A. Keum M.M. Pure E. Cohn Z.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5817-5821Google Scholar). Third, the affinity-purified antibodies did not stain free zymosan particles outside the cells (Fig. 1B). J774 cells on coverslips were allowed to phagocytose unopsonized zymosan for 15 min. Using affinity-purified antibodies, MacMARCKS was seen concentrated beneath the phagosomes at the periphery of the cells (Fig. 1B, MacMARCKS, arrowheads). Using fluorescein-conjugated phalloidin, F-actin was also seen concentrated beneath these same phagosomes (Fig. 1B, Actin, arrowhead). The phagosomal association of MacMARCKS was selective. A number of perinuclear-distributed mature phagosomes were seen in these cells (Fig. 1B, arrows). However, MacMARCKS and actin were not concentrated around those phagosomes. F-actin has been shown to associate only with nascent phagosomes(8Greenberg S. Burridge K. Silverstein S.C. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1853-1856Google Scholar), and our results thus suggest that MacMARCKS-decorated phagosomes are also nascent phagosomes. This phagosomal association of MacMARCKS prompted us to further examine whether it is involved in macrophage phagocytosis. The effector domain of MacMARCKS is a basic domain that contains the PKC phosphorylation sites(20Li J. Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 70: 791-801Google Scholar), calmodulin binding site (25Kim J. Blackshear P.J. Johnson J.D. McLaughlin S. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 227-237Google Scholar), and a putative actin binding site(17Hartwig J.H. Thelen M. Rosen A. Janmey P.A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Nature. 1992; 356: 618-622Google Scholar). Thus, deleting this domain is likely to generate a nonfunctional MacMARCKS that might serve as a dominant negative mutant in vivo to compete with endogenous wild type MacMARCKS. A cDNA-encoding effector domain deletion mutant of MacMARCKS (ED) (Fig. 2A) was generated and introduced into J774 cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” J774 cells expressing the ED mutant were selected by subjecting the cells to selection with 800 μg/ml G418. Three stable ED cell lines were randomly picked and expended as ED1, ED2, and ED3. Two-dimensional IEF-SDS-PAGE was used to separate ED mutant (pI 3.84) from endogenous MacMARCKS (pI 4.37), and the expression level of these proteins was determined using immunoblot with anti-MacMARCKS antibodies. The ratios of endogenous MacMARCKS to ED mutant were 1:1.06 for ED1, 1:0.81 for ED2, and 1:0.96 for ED3 (Fig. 2C). As a control, cDNA-encoding full-length MacMARCKS (FM) was also transfected into J774 cells. Because FM is identical with the endogenous MacMARCKS in J774 cells, we could not determine their expression separately. However, the total amount of MacMARCKS in FM control cells was about twice as much as in parental J774 cells (Fig. 2B), suggesting that FM was expressed to the same level as endogenous MacMARCKS. In the resting state, ED mutant cells, FM control cells, and their parental J774 cells appeared round and refractile, with no obvious difference in their appearance (Fig. 3, upper panel). Once the zymosan particles were added, FM control cells and parental J774 cells quickly spread out and started to phagocytose. However, little phagocytosis occurred in ED mutant cells, despite the apparent attachment of zymosan particles to the surface of these cells (Fig. 3, lower panel). During the 1-h incubation with zymosan, the ED mutant cells remained round and refractile and therefore appeared smaller than those control cells that spread out and phagocytosed zymosan particles (Fig. 3). The phagocytic index (number of ingested particles per 100 cells) was obtained by counting the ingested particles(33Speert D.P. Silverstein S.C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1985; 38: 655-658Google Scholar). The ingested zymosan particles appear refractile, while those outside the cells are dark and can be counted easily. We observed that parental J774 cells phagocytosed unopsonized zymosan with a phagocytic index of 325 ± 58 (n = 3) (Fig. 3). A similar phagocytic index of unopsonized zymosan by J774 cells had been reported earlier(33Speert D.P. Silverstein S.C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1985; 38: 655-658Google Scholar). However, the ED mutant cells showed a 10× reduction in phagocytic capacity toward unopsonized zymosan. The phagocytic indexes were 16 ± 8 (n = 3) for ED1, 23 ± 5 (n = 3) for ED2, and 19 ± 9 (n = 3) for ED3 (Fig. 3), whereas FM control cells showed approximately same phagocytic index of 349 ±48 (n = 3) as parental J774 cells (Fig. 3). This observation suggests that the reduction of phagocytosis indeed resulted from the expression of ED mutant, not from the integration of transfected foreign DNA. To minimize the possible miscounting due to human error, a modified flow cytometry method described by Liao et al.(34Liao G. Simone J. Simon S.R. Blood. 1994; 83: 2294-2304Google Scholar) was used to measure the phagocytosis of zymosan particles. In brief, fluorescein-conjugated zymosan particles were given to ED mutant cells, FM control cells, and parental J774 cells. After 1 h, cell surface-bound zymosan particles were removed by extensive trypsin digestion, and cell-associated fluorescence was measured using flow cytometry. Microscopy showed that the cells appeared as a dark shadow around bright fluorescent zymosan particles (Fig. 4, upper panel). Most FM control cells and parental J774 cells contained more than one fluorescent zymosan particle, whereas most of the ED mutant cells remained dark (no zymosan inside) or contained only one particle. Analyzed with flow cytometer, parental J774 cells and FM cells showed fluorescence with relative average intensities of 29.9 and 37.1, respectively (Fig. 4, lower panel). With ED mutant cells, only a small percentage of cells showed fluorescence with relative average intensities of only 1.58 for ED1, 1.15 for ED2, and 1.32 for ED3. Both ED mutant cells and FM control cells showed similar binding capacity toward zymosan particles (Fig. 3) as their parental J774 cells. In addition, the surface expression of Fcγ and complement receptor (CD11b) were similar to parental J774 cells as well (data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that the ED mutant blocked phagocytosis at the internalization stage. We examined whether ED mutant affected general membrane trafficking as measured by receptor-mediated endocytosis. The uptake of AcLDL is mediated both by the LDL receptor and macrophage scavenger receptor (38Arai H. Kita T. Yokode M. Narumiya S. Kawai C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 1375-1382Google Scholar) through receptor-mediated phagocytosis. It was therefore used to measure the effect of MacMARCKS mutant on endocytosis. After endocytosing Texas Red™-conjugated AcLDL for 30 min, the cells were washed, fixed, and subjected to flow cytometry analysis as described(35Suzuki K. Sakata N. Kitani A. Hara M. Hirose T. Hirose W. Norioka K. Harigai M. Kawagoe M. Nakamura H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1042: 210-216Google Scholar). All ED mutant cells showed similar amounts of AcLDL uptake compared to FM control cells and parental J774 cells (Fig. 5). This similarity in the uptake by all the cell lines was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy (data not shown). Thus, the defect in phagocytosis caused by MacMARCKS mutant did not seem to affect receptor-mediated AcLDL uptake. The results of our study suggest that MacMARCKS plays an important role in macrophage phagocytosis. It has been demonstrated previously that the activation of PKC strongly enhances phagocytosis(11Wright S.D. Silverstein S.C. J. Exp. Med. 1982; 156: 1149-1164Google Scholar, 13Zheleznyak A. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12042-12048Google Scholar). As a major PKC substrate, MacMARCKS is a logical candidate to be examined for its potential involvement in this process. The phagosomal association of MacMARCKS initially suggested that MacMARCKS might be involved in phagocytosis. This enrichment of MacMARCKS appears only on nascent phagosomes, whereas perinuclear-distributed mature phagolysosomes are devoid of MacMARCKS (Fig. 1B). Such a distribution of MacMARCKS very much resembles the selective enrichment of actin on nascent phagosomes(8Greenberg S. Burridge K. Silverstein S.C. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1853-1856Google Scholar). Our data indeed showed that MacMARCKS and actin are colocalized on the same phagosomes (Fig. 1B). F-actin was demonstrated to be essential for macrophage phagocytosis (reviewed in (1Silverstein S.C. Greenberg S. Di Virgilio F. Steinberg T.H. Paul W.E. Fundamental Immunology. Raven Press Ltd., New York1989: 703-720Google Scholar)). A number of other cytoskeleton-associated proteins, such as talin (8Greenberg S. Burridge K. Silverstein S.C. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1853-1856Google Scholar) and paxillin (9Greenberg S. Chang P. Silverstein S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3897-3902Google Scholar), showed similar phagosomal association as well. Since MacMARCKS protein contains a putative actin binding domain, its phagosomal association and colocalization with actin encouraged a more detailed investigation into its potential role in phagocytosis. A more direct suggestion of the role of MacMARCKS in phagocytosis comes from the expression of an effector domain deleted mutant of MacMARCKS (ED). The effector domain is a basic domain that contains PKC phosphorylation sites(20Li J. Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 70: 791-801Google Scholar), a calmodulin binding site(25Kim J. Blackshear P.J. Johnson J.D. McLaughlin S. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 227-237Google Scholar), and a putative actin binding site(17Hartwig J.H. Thelen M. Rosen A. Janmey P.A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Nature. 1992; 356: 618-622Google Scholar). Deletion of this domain abolished PKC-mediated phosphorylation and calmodulin binding.2 2J. Li, unpublished results. Our data showed that all three randomly selected ED mutant cell lines expressed approximately the same amount of mutant protein with a ratio to endogenous MacMARCKS of about 1:1. All three ED mutant cell lines showed approximately a 90% reduction in phagocytosis of zymosan particles compared with FM control cells. This result strongly suggests that MacMARCKS plays a role in macrophage phagocytosis and that the ED mutant acts as a “dominant negative” suppressor of MacMARCKS functions. In general, phagocytosis consists of two steps: binding and internalization of particles. Our data showed that there were as many bound zymosan particles on the mutant cells as on the control cells, implying a normal ligand binding of ED mutant cells (Fig. 3). Therefore, the ED mutant specifically blocks phagocytosis at the internalization step. MARCKS protein has been shown to bind and cross-link actin filaments (17Hartwig J.H. Thelen M. Rosen A. Janmey P.A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Nature. 1992; 356: 618-622Google Scholar) and possibly regulates membrane-cytoskeleton interaction(14Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 71: 713-716Google Scholar). MacMARCKS contains an almost identical actin binding domain (within the effector domain) as MARCKS, and deletion of this domain might therefore affect actin-based cytoskeleton and thereby causes a defect in phagocytosis. That the expression of ED mutant did not affect receptor-mediated endocytosis of AcLDL seems to favor such a hypothesis, because the main difference between phagocytosis and endocytosis is their dependence on actin-based cytoskeleton. Phagocytosis depends on the actin-based cytoskeleton, whereas endocytosis does not. In addition, upon adding zymosan, ED mutant cells failed to spread out as normal J774 cells do, thus appearing smaller. Such spreading is important for macrophage phagocytosis, and the actin-based cytoskeleton is primarily responsible for such a spreading process(5Francis C.L. Ryan T.A Jones B.D. Smith S.J. Falkow S. Nature. 1993; 364: 639-642Google Scholar). The difference in spreading was more dramatic when Salmonella was added to these cells.2Salmonella induced the formation of massive membrane ruffles in macrophages as part of its entry mechanism, and this process is actin-dependent(39Alpuche-Aranda C.M. Racoosin E.L. Swanson J.A. Miller S.I. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 601-608Google Scholar). We observed that Salmonella induced extension of lamellipodia in control cells as soon as 30 s, whereas no change was observed in ED mutant cells.2 Therefore, we speculate that the MacMARCKS may be involved in regulating membrane-cytoskeleton rearrangement during macrophage phagocytosis.

Then one of them (except the last) changed color (test stimulus) and served as the go signal: The monkey was required to produce a motor response in the direction of the stimulus that followed the test stimulus. When the test stimulus was the second in the sequence, there was a change in motor cortical activity from a pattern reflecting the direction of this stimulus to the pattern associated with the direction of the motor response. This change was abrupt, occurred 100 to 150 milliseconds after the go signal, and was evident both in the activity of single cells and in the time-varying neuronal population vector.

https://openalex.org/W2134889144,"Since reticulocytes have a high demand for iron, which is required for heme biosynthesis, these cells are highly specialized in the endocytosis of the iron carrier transferrin (Tf). From the resulting endocytic vesicles (EVs), iron is released and the vesicles rapidly return to the cell membrane where they fuse, causing the release of the apotransferrin. Due to a lack of other intracellular compartments, the endocytic vesicles can be readily isolated. In this study, we have investigated the fusogenic properties of EVs, using liposomes as target membranes.

ATP, GTP, and/or cytosol are not necessary to obtain fusion. However, trypsin treatment of the endocytic vesicles inhibits fusion, indicating the involvement of (a) protein(s) in the fusion event. Vesicular transport along the endocytic and secretory pathways involves the budding of vesicles from a donor compartment, specific targeting of the vesicles to an acceptor compartment, followed by a fusion event between target and vesicular membranes. To investigate the mechanisms and regulation of such vesicular transport processes, many cell-free systems have been developed to reconstitute intercompartmental transport. This has led to the recognition and identification of a growing number of molecular factors (proteins, nucleotides) thought to be involved in the distinct interaction steps (1Sztul E.S. Melanon P. Howell K.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 381-386Google Scholar, 2Takizawa P.A. Malhotra V. Cell. 1993; 75: 593-596Google Scholar). With regard to budding, adaptins and clathrin have been recognized in the endocytic pathway as the major proteins involved in receptor sorting and vesicle formation from plasma membrane and trans Golgi network(3Pley U. Parham P. Critical Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 431-464Google Scholar). As to the subsequent steps in intracellular trafficking, i.e. vesicle docking and fusion, a host of molecules have been identified, including small GTPases (rab proteins), heterotrimeric G proteins, NSF, SNAP, and SNARE. The function of most of these factors is largely obscure, although these components may well be part of a machinery, common to all vesicle fusion events, as unified in the so-called SNARE hypothesis(4Sllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Google Scholar). According to this hypothesis, SNAPs bind to their receptors, SNAREs, on the vesicle (v-SNARE) and on the target membrane (t-SNARE). NSF subsequently binds to SNAPs, which causes ATP hydrolysis, thus inducing complex dissolution, which may precede or follow the merging of membranes. Recently, it has been shown that cellubrevin, a member of the SNARE family(5McMahon H.T. Ushkaryov Y.A. Edelmann L. Link E. Binz T. Niemann H. Jahn R. Sdhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 364: 346-349Google Scholar), is involved in the recycling of the Tf1 1The abbreviations used are: TftransferrinDOPCdioleoylphosphatidylcholineDOPEdioleoylphosphatidylethanolamineEVendocytic vesicleN-Rh-PEN-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl)-phosphatidylethanolamineR18octadecylrhodamine B-chlorideZ-fFGcarbobenzoxy-D-phenylalanyl-L-phenylalanylglycinePCphosphatidylcholinePSphosphatidylserineMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidGTPγSguanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). 1The abbreviations used are: TftransferrinDOPCdioleoylphosphatidylcholineDOPEdioleoylphosphatidylethanolamineEVendocytic vesicleN-Rh-PEN-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl)-phosphatidylethanolamineR18octadecylrhodamine B-chlorideZ-fFGcarbobenzoxy-D-phenylalanyl-L-phenylalanylglycinePCphosphatidylcholinePSphosphatidylserineMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidGTPγSguanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). receptor, as observed in permeabilized Chinese hamster ovary cells(6Galli T.

Balch W.E. Nature. 1989; 339: 397-398Google Scholar), has been shown to be crucial to homotypic fusion of endosomes(8Diaz R. Mayorga L.S. Weidman P.J. Rothman J.E. Stahl P.D. Nature. 1989; 339: 398-400Google Scholar). The functioning of rab proteins in the fusion of endocytic vesicles does not seem to depend on the GTPase activity, as revealed by the use of rab GTPase mutants (9Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Ltcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Google Scholar) and fusion experiments in the presence of nonhydrolyzable GTP(10Barbieri M.A. Li G. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18720-18722Google Scholar). However, it is evident that the molecular mechanism of membrane fusion is far from understood. transferrin dioleoylphosphatidylcholine dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine endocytic vesicle N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl)-phosphatidylethanolamine octadecylrhodamine B-chloride carbobenzoxy-D-phenylalanyl-L-phenylalanylglycine phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylserine 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). transferrin dioleoylphosphatidylcholine dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine endocytic vesicle N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl)-phosphatidylethanolamine octadecylrhodamine B-chloride carbobenzoxy-D-phenylalanyl-L-phenylalanylglycine phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylserine 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). Receptor-mediated endocytosis refers to the cell's capacity to internalize components after their binding to specific receptors. Depending on the receptor-ligand complex involved, molecules are then delivered to the lysosomes for degradation. Reticulocytes are highly exceptional in that they are hyperspecialized for uptake of iron, which is needed for the biosynthesis of heme. In fact, to meet this requirement, endocytic membrane traffic consists primarily of the transferrin-transferrin receptor complex constituting the sole complex internalized by reticulocytes. As indicated by the quasi-absence of lysosomes, there is no sorting event in the endosomal compartment. Rather, after release of iron, Tf rapidly recycles to the cell surface (5 min for sheep reticulocytes(11Adam M. Wu C. Turbide C. Larrick J. Johnstone R.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1986; 127: 8-16Google Scholar); less than 4 min for rat reticulocytes(12Grasso J.A. Bruno M. Yates A.A. Wei L. Epstein P.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 266: 261-272Google Scholar)), making Tf available for another round of iron transport. Apart from the few lysosomes left, reticulocytes are also anucleated cells containing only vestigial remnants of Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum(13Rapoport S.M. Schewe T. Thiele B.-J. Harris J.R. Blood Cell Biochemistry:Erythroid Cells. Plenum Press, New York1991: 151-194Google Scholar). Hence, the virtual lack of other internal compartments and their highly specific endocytic function makes these cells an excellent source and model to isolate and study the properties, respectively, of endocytic vesicles. Previously, it has been shown that these vesicles contain several small GTPases, which presumably regulate the intracellular trafficking in the cell(14Vidal M.J. Stahl P.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 60: 261-267Google Scholar). In the present work, we have initiated a study aimed at investigating the fusogenic properties of the endocytic vesicles. To bypass molecular factors that regulate trafficking and docking, although essential prerequisites to fusion in vivo, we have used artificial membranes as target membranes. Various assays based on lipid mixing and content mixing were employed, allowing us to conveniently determine initial kinetics of endocytic vesicle fusion. Thus parameters that affect the fusion process can be readily evaluated in this manner. We show that fusion is rapid, temperature dependent, and is markedly affected by the lipid composition of the target membrane, strongly supporting a role for lipids capable of forming hexagonal lipid phases. Fusion is mediated by a trypsin-sensitive factor, which is present on the membrane of endocytic vesicles. Dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC), dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), phosphatidylserine (PS, bovine brain), cholesterol, and carbobenzoxy-D-phenylalanyl-L-phenylalanylglycine (Z-fFG) were purchased from Sigma. Octadecylrhodamine B-chloride (R18), N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl)-phosphatidylethanolamine (N-Rh-PE) were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Cyclosporin A was from Sandoz (Basel, Switzerland)). 1-Palmitoyl,2-[14C]oleoyl,3-phosphatidylcholine (53 mCi/mmol) was purchased from Amersham-France (Les Ulis, France). Staphylococcus aureus (Pansorbin) was a product from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Large unilamellar vesicles were prepared as described by Kremer et al.(15Kremer J.M.H. van den Esker M.W. Pathmamaoharan C. Wiersema P.H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 3932-3935Google Scholar). Briefly, lipids were mixed from stock solutions, dried under nitrogen, and redissolved in ethanol. The ethanolic solution (5 μmol of phospholipids in 50 μl of alcohol) was injected with a Hamilton syringe into 2.5 ml of saline buffer (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4), under vigorous stirring. By quasi-elastic light scattering using a Coulter particle analyzer (model N4S), it was determined that the liposome size of the various DOPC/DOPE-containing vesicles varied between 140 and 160 nm. The size of DOPC and PS vesicles varied between 110 and 130 nm. Note that this similarity in vesicle sizes will exclude a significant contribution of curvature to the fusion kinetics. Phospholipid content was quantified as described by Bartlett(16Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Google Scholar). Anemia was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by phenylhydrazine injections. Blood was withdrawn by heart puncture and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min. After removing the buffy coat, the red blood cells (reticulocyte percentage was generally >70%) were washed three times with the saline buffer. Endocytic vesicles (EVs) were prepared as described previously(14Vidal M.J. Stahl P.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 60: 261-267Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were resuspended (50% hematocrit) in lysis buffer (50 mM NaCl, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 mM NaN3, 100 mM MES, pH 6.5) and lysed by two cycles of rapid freezing followed by thawing with gentle agitation at 4°C. The non-lysed cells and debris were pelleted at 20,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was ultracentrifuged at 65,000 × g for 60 min. The pellet enriched with EVs was gently resuspended with 250 mM sucrose, 20 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, at a protein concentration of about 5 mg/ml, and kept in aliquots at −80°C. For the gradient analysis experiments, the EVs were labeled with N-Rh-PE or 125I-Tf. To this end, reticulocytes were preincubated at 4°C for 1 h in RPMI containing N-Rh-PE (8 μM solubilized in ethanol; final ethanol concentration <1%, v/v)) or 125I-Tf (20 μg/ml). To trigger membrane internalization, the cells were warmed to 37°C. After 30 min, the cells were washed three times with the saline buffer, and EVs were isolated as described above. Tf-labeled EV preparations were loaded onto a Sepharose 6B column (20 × 1 cm) equilibrated with saline buffer to remove free 125I-Tf before gradient analysis. EVs were labeled with R18 by injection (under vigorous vortexing) of 10 μl of an ethanolic solution of R18 (14 mM) into 1 ml of saline buffer containing the vesicles (1 mg protein/ml, 1.3 mM phospholipid). The mixture was incubated on ice for 1 h in the dark. Labeled EVs were separated from unincorporated R18 using a Sephadex G-75 column (20 × 1 cm), equilibrated with saline buffer. By measuring R18 fluorescence versus phospholipid prior to and after gel filtration, it could be determined that the efficiency of labeling varied from 50-70%. This implies that the final EV preparations contained approximately 5-7% R18 with respect to total phospholipid, i.e. roughly 2.5-3.5 mol % with respect to total lipid. These numbers are similar to the extent and efficiency of labeling seen for various viruses(18Hoekstra D. de Boer T. Klappe K. Wilschut J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5675-5681Google Scholar). Aliquots of R18-EVs were kept at −20°C. The probe remained firmly membrane associated and no release was seen (as determined by gel filtration) upon prolonged storage nor when the labeled membranes were incubated at 37°C for 60 min. Neither was significant degradation of the probe apparent after a 1-h incubation at 37°C, as revealed by lipid extraction and analysis by thin layer chromatography. This is consistent with the notion that nonspecific esterase activity is not associated with EVs(44Bette-Bobillo P. Vidal M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 199-205Google Scholar). Quenching (Q) was calculated according to Q = 1 − F/F∞, where F is fluorescence and F∞ the fluorescence measured after addition of Triton X-100 (0.5% v/v). Immunoisolation of R18-EVs was carried out using S. aureus, coated with an antibody raised against a peptide (24 AA) of the cytosolic domain of the Tf-R(17Rutledge E.A. Mikoryak C.A. Draper R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21125-21130Google Scholar), generously provided by Rockford Draper (University of Texas, Dallas, TX). Fusion of R18-EVs with liposomes was measured by the R18 assay(18Hoekstra D. de Boer T. Klappe K. Wilschut J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5675-5681Google Scholar). Fluorescence was measured using a thermostated SLM Aminco Bowman Series 2 luminescence spectrometer with 1-s time resolution at 560 and 590 nm excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. Fusion was initiated by injecting 200 μl of liposomes (2 mM stock) into a magnetically stirred cuvette containing the appropriate amount of R18-EVs in saline buffer. The final incubation volume was 2 ml. The residual fluorescence of R18-EVs in the cuvette, before addition of liposomes, was set to 0%. The fluorescence after addition of Triton X-100 (0.5% v/v), corrected for dilution, was taken as 100%. Data are expressed as the initial rate of fusion, determined from the fluorescence tracings at time 0. A discontinuous sucrose density gradient was prepared by sequential layering of 50, 40, 30, and 20% sucrose, 1 ml each, and 0.5 ml of 10% sucrose (w/w). The samples (0.25 ml), containing either EVs or liposomes or both, were layered on top of the gradient. After centrifugation at 35,000 revolutions/min for 1 h at 4°C in an SW 50 Beckman rotor, fractions of 450 μl were collected from the bottom of the tube. Depending on the experiment, aliquots of the fractions were (i) analyzed for N-Rh-PE fluorescence (after addition of Triton X-100 (λ560, λ590), (ii) counted in a β-counter (Beckman LS 5000TD) to quantify the presence of [14C]PC, or (iii) counted in a γ-counter (Packard Cobra) to determine 125I-Tf. Endocytic vesicles were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The characteristics of the EV preparation were similar to those previously described(14Vidal M.J. Stahl P.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 60: 261-267Google Scholar), including the enrichment of the Tf-R as assessed by Western blots. EVs thus prepared were then labeled with R18 using an ethanol injection method(18Hoekstra D. de Boer T. Klappe K. Wilschut J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5675-5681Google Scholar). It has been shown that this method allows the introduction of the probe into biological membranes, resulting in a concentration-dependent self-quenching of fluorescence. At the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures,” incorporation of R18 was such that the quenching of fluorescence was usually higher than 0.9. To confirm that R18 was specifically incorporated in endocytic vesicles, we immunoisolated the vesicles via the Tf-R and analyzed the associated fluorescence. The immunoisolation was carried out using S. aureus coated with an antibody raised against a peptide contained in the cytosolic domain of the Tf-R(17Rutledge E.A. Mikoryak C.A. Draper R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21125-21130Google Scholar). S. aureus coated with the anti-TfR was able to pellet three times more R18 fluorescence than S. aureus coated with an irrelevant antibody, thus confirming the colocalization of lipid probe and Tf-R in EVs. To determine the fusion activity of EVs, the R18-labeled vesicles were mixed with unlabeled liposomes. The procedure implies that fusion of both membranes will result in dilution of the fluorescent lipid analog, causing relief of self-quenching. Hence an increase in fluorescence reports, in principle, the occurrence of fusion. As shown in Fig. 1A (curve a), addition of the liposomes to R18-labeled EVs resulted in a time-dependent increase of fluorescence. From the slope of the fluorescence tracing at time 0, the initial rate of fluorescence increase was calculated (Fig. 1B). Typically, the rate of lipid mixing was in the order of approximately 5%/min, while the increase of fluorescence development leveled off after 15-20 min (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 1, both the rate and extent of dilution depend on the concentration of liposomes, showing an increase when the concentration increases. Moreover, when the saline buffer was replaced by an isoosmotic sucrose buffer, lipid mixing was virtually abolished, showing a residual rate of 0.46%/min, i.e. less than 10% of the rate in saline buffer (cf. curve a versus curve d in Fig. 1). Neither was substantial lipid dilution observed when the experiments were carried out at 10°C, where an initial rate was seen of 0.15%/min, i.e. less than 5% of that obtained at 37°C (see Fig. 7). Taken together, these experiments indicate that if these conditions reflect conditions at which fluorescence development only occurs as a result of spontaneous movement of the probe, such monomeric transfer would contribute at most 5-10% to the fluorescence development obtained at fusogenic conditions.Figure 2:Kinetics of R18 fluorescence development upon fusion between EVs and liposomes. R18-labeled EVs were mixed with DOPC/DOPE (6:4) liposomes at 37°C. The kinetics of R18 fluorescence were monitored continuously at conditions that were otherwise identical to those described in the legend to Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 7:Temperature dependence of EV-liposome fusion. EVs-R18 were equilibrated in saline buffer at the indicated temperatures, and 200 μM of liposomes of DOPC/DOPE at a molar ratio of 6:4 equilibrated similarly were added. Initial rates of fusion were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Although the latter observations, in particular, supported the occurrence of lipid dilution as a result of fusion, rather than transfer of R18 monomers between labeled and unlabeled membranes, several additional control experiments were carried out to corroborate this notion. EVs and liposomes can be separated on sucrose density gradients because of a difference in density. After fusion, the fusion product will differ in composition, and hence density. Indeed, a shift in density was observed when R18-labeled EVs had been incubated with liposomes for 30 min at 37°C (not shown). An identical result was obtained when EVs were labeled endogenously. This was accomplished by labeling the reticulocyte membrane with the non-exchangeable phospholipid analog N-Rh-PE. Using an analogous procedure as outlined for R18, the probe can be intercalated at low temperature in the plasma membrane of cells. Warming of the labeled cells results in internalization of the probe by endocytosis, as has been shown to occur in BHK cells (19Kok J.W. ter Beest M. Scherphof G. Hoekstra D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 53: 173-184Google Scholar) and HepG2 cells(20Zaal K.J.M. Kok J.W. Sormunen R. Eskelinen S. Hoekstra D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 63: 10-19Google Scholar). With this procedure, N-Rh-PE-labeled EVs (note that the probe is asymmetrically located, i.e. in the inner leaflet only) were isolated after in situ labeling. Subsequent incubation with unlabeled liposomes for 30 min at 37°C, dictated by the R18 assay (Fig. 1), showed that a fusion product was obtained with a density that was less than that of the EVs per se (Fig. 3). Furthermore, measurements of rhodamine fluorescence before and after addition of Triton X-100 revealed that relative to the fluorescence measured in fractions 4-6 (Fig. 3), the fluorescence in fractions 8-10 was dequenched (approximately 50%). Although no efforts were undertaken to correlate the extent of dequenching to the extent of fusion, it is apparent that a relative dequenching, in conjunction with a shift in density, is consistent with the occurrence of dilution due to merging of labeled EVs with unlabeled liposomes. Apart from membrane mixing, fusion should also lead to the mixing of contents, bounded by the membranes of the vesicle populations involved. For membrane vesicles of biological origin, such an approach is commonly impossible. In this case, however, the exclusiveness of the system could be exploited in that Tf is the sole substrate carried by the EVs. Therefore, EVs were isolated that contained 125I-Tf. As shown in Fig. 4, when such vesicles had been incubated with liposomes for 30 min at 37°C, a shift to lower density occurred for the Tf in the gradient. In fact, the vesicle fraction of lower density was recovered at a density identical to that observed for the N-Rh-PE-labeled fusion product (Fig. 3). This result strongly supports the view that the shift in contents localization reliably reflects a shift due to membrane mixing as a result of fusion. Furthermore, quantification of the contents mixing can be approximated by subtracting the gradient patterns (Fig. 4B). It can thus be estimated that approximately 20% of the internal contents of the endocytic vesicles is shifted to lower density due to fusion. This number corresponds very well with the level of lipid dilution, obtained in case of the R18 assay. Thus, in a parallel experiment, R18-labeled EVs were incubated with liposomes at otherwise identical conditions. After 30 min at 37°C, the extent of dilution was determined by measuring fluorescence prior and after addition of Triton X-100. In three separate experiments the dilution amounted 18.3 ± 1.4%. The similarity in both these numbers, derived from contents and lipid mixing, also indicates that R18 per se does not significantly interfere with the fusion reaction, as has been noted before(18Hoekstra D. de Boer T. Klappe K. Wilschut J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5675-5681Google Scholar). Taken together these results validate the use of the R18 assay, reflecting the occurrence of EV fusion in a reliable manner, as monitored by lipid mixing. As target membranes, liposomes represent a convenient tool for initial characterization of a fusion event because their lipid composition can be readily modified. The effect of liposomal lipid composition on endocytic vesicle fusion was thus investigated. As shown in Fig. 5, the presence of DOPE in the liposomal bilayer strongly promotes fusion of the endocytic vesicles with artificial bilayers. As a function of the molar ratio of DOPE to total phospholipid, the fusion efficiency increased as reflected by the increase of the initial rate. At 10 mol %, a rate of 2.7%/min was obtained, which further increased to 3.4%/min at 20 mol %, up to 5.1%/min at 40 mol % PE. Interestingly, PS vesicles, which have been reported to fuse very efficiently with a variety of biological target membranes(21Kagiwada S. Murata M. Hishida R. Tagaya M. Yamashina S. Ohnishi S.-I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1430-1435Google Scholar, 22Vogel S.S. Chernomordick L.V. Zimmerberg J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25640-25643Google Scholar, 23Klappe K. Wilschut J. Nir S. Hoekstra D. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 8252-8260Google Scholar, 24Arts E.G.J.M. Kuiken J. Jager S. Hoekstra D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 1001-1009Google Scholar), represent a relatively poor target for endocytic vesicles, as shown in Fig. 5. Inclusion of PS (10 mol %) in DOPE/DOPC bilayers did not significantly affect the fusion efficiency, as obtained for DOPE/DOPC vesicles per se. Neither did addition of cholesterol or cholesterol hemisuccinate affect the fusion efficiency. Finally, it is relevant to note that the similarity in vesicle sizes (see “Experimental Procedures”) excludes that curvature effects contribute to the observed differences in fusion kinetics. Taken together, these results suggest a specific role of DOPE in the fusion event of the endocytic vesicles. Apart from its low state of hydration, DOPE has a propensity to form in isolation the hexagonal HII phase. This bilayer to nonbilayer transition is mediated through formation of inverted micelles. Evidently, when apposed membranes fuse, membrane destabilization has to occur(25Siegel D.P. Biophys. J. 1986; 49: 1171-1183Google Scholar), and the potentially membrane-destabilizing properties of DOPE may therefore be of relevance, irrespective of the nature of the intermediate structure, which depends on the experimental conditions. Cyclosporin A and Z-fFG are known to stabilize membranes by interfering with non-bilayer transitions(26Kelsey D.R. Flanagan T.D. Young J. Yeagle P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12178-12183Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, both compounds strongly inhibited the fusion of EVs with DOPE/DOPC liposomes. For both compounds, the maximal efficiency of inhibition was about 70-80% (Fig. 6). Furthermore, mass action kinetic analysis of the data obtained in the presence of the peptide reveals that the fusion rate constant decreases approximately 4-fold at these conditions, with little effect on the aggregation rate constant.2 2M. Vidal, S. Nir, and D. Hoekstra, unpublished observations. Hence, the peptide interferes with the fusion step per se rather than the close approach of EVs and liposomes. The specificity of the inhibitory effect is apparent by the observation that the tripeptides Z-GGG and Z-GGA were without effect on fusion (Fig. 6). Moreover, cyclosporin A did not interfere with the fusion between EVs and PS vesicles, implying that identical kinetics were obtained in the presence or absence of the drug (not shown). To further characterize the fusogenic properties of EV with DOPE/DOPC membranes, various parameters were examined which were thought to play a role in the overall fusion event in vivo. Addition of ATP (1 mM), GTP (1 mM), and GTPγS (20 μM) did not affect the fusion reaction, implying that the fusogenic interaction between EV and liposomes does not depend on energy and/or GTPase activity. Intriguingly, addition of cytosol (final concentration 0.6 mg/ml) strongly inhibited the rate of lipid dilution by approximately 90%, while the addition of AlF4 (10 mM NaF, 20 μM AlCl3) did not affect the fusion between EVs and liposomes. When increasing concentrations of Ca2+ were included in the incubation medium (up to 5 mM), no effect on both the rate or extent of fluorescence increase was seen, suggesting that the fusion event was Ca2+-independent. Finally, fusion between EV and DOPE/DOPC liposomes is strongly dependent on temperature. As shown in Fig. 7, lowering the temperature from 37 to 14°C gradually inhibited the fusion, the"

With pLeu-RS cultures, the A240 peak appeared after 5 h. Much less pronounced A240 peaks appeared in the spectra of other cultures, including JM101 host cells culture, after 24 h of incubation. TLC confirmed that Hcy thiolactone was formed in pIle-RS, pLeu-RS, and pMet-RS cultures after 5 h and in other cultures after 24 h of incubation. In all cases, a UV-absorbing, base-sensitive spot that stained yellow with ninhydrin(4Jakubowski H. Fersht A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3105-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), comigrating with authentic Hcy thiolactone, was detected after culture media samples were subjected to TLC. Quantitation of Hcy thiolactone formed in bacterial cultures (Table 1) indicates that in overproducers of Ile-RS, Leu-RS, and Met-RS, the rate of synthesis of Hcy thiolactone is up to 30-fold greater than in the JM101 E. coli host. Overproducers of other AARS such as Arg-RS, Asp-RS, Cys-RS, Lys-RS, Phe-RS, Pro-RS, Ser-RS, Trp-RS, and Val-RS produced Hcy thiolactone at very low levels, similar to that observed for the JM101 E. coli host strain (Table 1). No detectable (by UV absorption) Hcy thiolactone was formed in the absence of bacterial cells or exogenous Hcy. It should be noted that in the absence of exogenous Hcy, the thiolactone is detectable in bacterial cultures labeled with [35S]sulfate; under these conditions, Hcy thiolactone is formed at a rate of about 0.1 μM/1 h(9Jakubowski H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4504-4508Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To show that increased Hcy thiolactone synthesis in some overproducers of AARS is in fact due to a particular synthetase, effects of cognate and noncognate amino acids on the thiolactone synthesis were determined. As expected, in experiments with the Ile-RS-, Leu-RS-, and Met-RS-overproducing strains, 90-97% inhibition of Hcy thiolactone synthesis was observed only in the presence of a corresponding cognate amino acid (Table 2). For example, synthesis of Hcy thiolactone in cultures overproducing Ile-RS was 97% inhibited by isoleucine but not by methionine. The inhibition was specific for Ile-RS; isoleucine did not significantly inhibit Hcy thiolactone synthesis in Leu-RS- and Met-RS-overproducing cultures. For unknown reasons, isoleucine stimulated Hcy thiolactone synthesis in the Met-RS overproducer. Lysine and cysteine, used as controls, did not significantly affect Hcy thiolactone synthesis in any of the tested cultures (Table 2). Thus, the high levels of Hcy thiolactone synthesis in Ile-RS-, Leu-RS-, and Met-RS-overproducing cultures are due to a particular synthetase that was overproduced. Attempts to determine contribution by each synthetase to Hcy editing in the wild type JM101 strain were also made. Due to the relatively low ratio of signal to noise observed with this strain, only qualitative assessments by TLC were possible. The low level of Hcy thiolactone produced by JM101 was abolished when isoleucine, leucine, and methionine were simultaneously added to the culture. Either amino acid alone partially inhibited the synthesis of Hcy thiolactone by JM101. This indicates that Ile-RS, Leu-RS, and Met-RS, expressed from the chromosome in JM101, contribute about equally to editing of exogenous Hcy in bacterial cells. Val-RS and Lys-RS that edit Hcy in vitro (albeit much less efficiently than Ile-RS, Met-RS, and Leu-RS) do not seem to contribute significantly to editing in vivo, even when overexpressed. Thus, for AARS that exhibit inadequate initial selectivity, editing of errors in amino acid selection is a physiologically important function. The present discovery that Ile-RS and Leu-RS, in addition to Met-RS, are responsible for editing of exogenous (taken up from the medium) Hcy does not contradict the original observation that Met-RS is exclusively involved in editing of endogenous (formed in the methionine biosynthetic pathway) Hcy(9Jakubowski H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4504-4508Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 12Gao W. Goldman E. Jakubowski H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11528-11535Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Taken together, results of the present and previous experiments demonstrate that endogenous Hcy is accessible only to, and edited only by, Met-RS. On the other hand, exogenous Hcy is accessible to, and edited by, any synthetase that is able to misactivate it efficiently. This further indicates that the extent of editing of Hcy in bacterial cells is governed by compartmentation or channeling of Hcy metabolism that may limit access of some synthetases to a particular intracellular amino acid pool.

The SHPTP2 phosphatase (also termed PTP1D, SHPTP3, PTP2C, PTPL1, or Syp) is one member of a family of cytosolic protein tyrosine-specific phosphatases that contain two amino-terminal SH2 domains and a carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain(12Freeman Jr., R.M.

Science. 1993; 259: 1607-1611Google Scholar). These SH2 domains target SHPTP2 to the tyrosine-phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor, the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor, and IRS1(13Vogel W. Lammers R. Huang J. Ullrich A. Science. 1993; 259: 1611-1614Google Scholar, 18Kuhne M.R. Pawson T. Lienhard G.E. Feng G.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11479-11481Google Scholar, 19Lechleider R.J. Freeman Jr., R.M. Neel B.G. J.

In addition to mediating the targeting of SHPTP2, the SH2 domains also appear to regulate SHPTP2 catalytic activity. Several studies have demonstrated that the unoccupied SH2 domains maintain the SHPTP2 phosphatase activity in a repressed state, whereas the binding of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins or peptides results in a marked activation of protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity(22Sugimoto S.

Furthermore, the phosphorylation of SHPTP2 on tyrosine 542 in response to PDGF may also contribute to the activation of its phosphatase activity(28Li W. Nishimura R. Kashishian A. Batzer A.G. Kim W.J. Cooper J.A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 509-517Google Scholar, 29Bennett A.M. Tang T.L. Sugimoto S. Walsh C.T. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7335-7339Google Scholar). In general, tyrosine phosphatases function as the inactivating arms of kinase activation pathways; however, they may also function as positive effectors for downstream signaling. In the case of T cell receptor signaling, the CD45 protein-tyrosine phosphatase dephosphorylates the inhibitory carboxyl-terminal tyrosine phosphorylation site on Fyn and/or Lck(30Biffen M. McMichael-Phillips D. Larson T. Venkitaraman A. Alexander D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1920-1929Google Scholar). The subsequent relief of this kinase inhibition is an essential requirement for T cell receptor-mediated biological responses (31Koretzky G.A. Picus J. Thomas M.L. Weiss A. Nature. 1990; 346: 66-68Google Scholar, 32Koretzky G.A. Picus J. Schultz T. Weiss A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2037-2041Google Scholar). Similarly, SHPTP2 is the mammalian homologue of the Drosophila SH2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase, termed corkscrew(33Ambrosio L. Mahowald A. Perrimon N. Nature. 1989; 342: 288-290Google Scholar). Genetic epistasis experiments have also demonstrated that corkscrew is an essential gene for the appropriate development of anterior/posterior structures during embryogenesis, functioning downstream of the torso tyrosine kinase, a homologue of the mammalian PDGF receptor, and upstream of polehole, a homologue of the mammalian raf serine/threonine kinase(34Casanova J. Struhl G. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 2025-2038Google Scholar, 35Sprenger F. Stevens L.M. Nuesslein-Volhard C. Nature. 1989; 338: 478-483Google Scholar, 36Perkins L.A. Larsen I. Perrimon N. Cell. 1992; 70: 225-236Google Scholar). Recently, several studies have suggested that SHPTP2 also plays an important positive role in insulin signaling. Although increased levels of tyrosine phosphatase activity would be expected to inhibit signaling events, expression of the wild-type catalytically active SHPTP2 had no significant effect on insulin-stimulated biological responsiveness (37Noguchi T. Matszaki T. Horita K. Fujioka Y. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6674-6682Google Scholar, 38Milarski K.L. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21239-21243Google Scholar, 39Yamauchi K. Milarski K.L. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 664-668Google Scholar). Furthermore, microinjection of SHPTP2-specific antibodies completely blocked insulin-stimulated DNA synthesis in fibroblasts expressing high levels of the insulin receptor(40Xiao S. Rose D.W. Sasaoka T. Maegawa H. Bruke Jr., T.R. Roller P.P. Shoelson S.E. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21244-21248Google Scholar). In addition, expression of the SHPTP2 SH2 domains or a full-length catalytically inactive SHPTP2 mutant blocked activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway as well as c-fos transcription and DNA synthesis without significant effect on the tyrosine phosphorylation state of IRS1 or Shc(37Noguchi T. Matszaki T. Horita K. Fujioka Y. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6674-6682Google Scholar, 38Milarski K.L. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21239-21243Google Scholar, 39Yamauchi K.

Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21244-21248Google Scholar). Even though these data have provided strong evidence for a positive signaling role of SHPTP2 in mediating insulin action, a physiological substrate has not been identified. In this report, we have identified an insulin-stimulated tyrosine-phosphorylated protein (pp115) that is the major SHPTP2-binding protein and that may be an important substrate for the SHPTP2 phosphatase. Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing ~3 × 106 human insulin receptors/cell (CHO/IR) were isolated and maintained in minimal Eagle's medium containing nucleotides plus 10% fetal bovine serum as described previously(41Frattali A.L. Treadway J.L. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9829-9834Google Scholar). 3T3L1 preadipocytes were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and were differentiated into the adipocyte phenotype as described by Rubin et al.(42Rubin C.S. Lai E. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3554-3557Google Scholar). Briefly, 3T3L1 preadipocytes were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum. The cells were differentiated into adipocytes by replacement with fresh medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.25 μM dexamethasone, 500 μM isobutylmethylxanthine, and 1 μg/ml insulin for 3 days. The cells were then medium-changed into Dulbecco's modified Eagles's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 8-14 days. The Myc epitope (MEQKLISEEDL) was introduced into the amino terminus of SHPTP2 by cloning an oligonucleotide linking upstream of the initiation methionine codon. This domain was introduced both in the wild-type SHPTP2 cDNA (Myc-WT-SHPTP2) and in the catalytically inactive SHPTP2 mutant in which cysteine 459 was replaced with serine (Myc-C/S-SHPTP2) by site-directed mutagenesis. These cDNAs were then subcloned into the high efficiency mammalian expression vector CLDN(43Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4427-4434Google Scholar). To obtain a high degree of transfection efficiency necessary for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting of whole cell extracts, CHO/IR cells were electroporated with a total of 40 μg of plasmid DNA at 340 V and 960 microfarads as described previously(44Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol Chem. 1994; 269: 31107-31114Google Scholar). Under these conditions, ~80-95% of the viable cell population was functionally transfected as assessed by in situ β-galactosidase staining. Thirty-six h following transfection, the cells were serum-starved for 6 h and either untreated or incubated for 5 min in the presence of 100 nM insulin or 100 ng/ml PDGF prior to the preparation of whole cell lysates. Whole cell extracts were prepared by detergent solubilization in lysis buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 100 mM sodium fluoride, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μM leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1.5 mM pepstatin) for 1 h at 4°C. The resultant cell extracts were subjected to Western blotting using an amino-terminal SHPTP2 antibody (Transduction Laboratories), a Myc epitope antibody (9E10; Santa Cruz), or a phosphotyrosine antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (PY20-HRP; Santa Cruz) and visualization with the ECL detection system (Amersham Corp.). Immunoprecipitation of the whole cell lysates was performed by a 5-fold dilution of the detergent-solubilized cell extracts (lysis buffer without Triton X-100) and incubation with 4 μg of a carboxyl-terminal SHPTP2 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz), monoclonal antibody 9E10, a Grb2 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz), a Crk monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories), a Nck monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), or an IRS1 rabbit polyclonal antiserum (a kind gift from Dr. Gus Lienhard, Dartmouth Medical School) for 2 h at 4°C. The primary polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies were incubated with protein A-agarose or protein G plus-agarose, respectively, for 1 h at 4°C. The resulting immunoprecipitates were then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotted as described above. Insulin stimulation has previously been observed to result in the specific association of SHPTP2 with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS1 (5Sun X.-J. Crimmins D.L. Myers Jr., M.G. Miralpeix M. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7418-7428Google Scholar, 9Zhou S.Y. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B.

Chem. 1993; 268: 11479-11481Google Scholar). To assess the potential association of SHPTP2 with other effector proteins, we initially examined the ability of an amino-terminal SHPTP2 antibody to coimmunoprecipitate phosphotyrosine-containing proteins following growth factor stimulation (Fig. 1). Treatment of CHO/IR cells with 100 nM insulin for 10 min resulted in the coimmunoprecipitation of SHPTP2 with a tyrosine-phosphorylated 185-kDa band identified as IRS1 (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2). However, the major insulin-dependent tyrosine-phosphorylated species that coimmunoprecipitated with SHPTP2 migrated as a broad band at ~115 kDa (Fig. 1A, lane 2). In several experiments, the broad tyrosine-phosphorylated 115-kDa protein band appeared to be composed of multiple distinct species that were not always resolved (for example, see Fig. 3). In contrast, stimulation of CHO/IR cells with 100 ng/ml PDGF resulted in the coimmunoprecipitation of the tyrosine-phosphorylated PDGF receptors (α and β) as well as a tyrosine-phosphorylated band of 68 kDa with SHPTP2 (Fig. 1A, lane 3). However, the amount of SHPTP2-coimmunoprecipitated tyrosine-phosphorylated 115-kDa protein did not differ significantly between control and PDGF-treated cells (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 3). Western blots with an SHPTP2 antibody demonstrated that approximately equal amounts of SHPTP2 protein were immunoprecipitated under these conditions. Moreover, the 68-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated band observed in response to PDGF (Fig. 1A, lane 3) comigrated with the SHPTP2 protein (Fig. 1A, lanes 4-6). These data are consistent with previous reports demonstrating the direct tyrosine phosphorylation and association of SHPTP2 with the PDGF receptor, but not with the insulin receptor (18Kuhne M.R.

CHO/IR cells (A) and differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes (B) were either left untreated (lane 1) or incubated with 100 nM insulin for 0.5 (lane 2), 2 (lane 3), 5 (lane 4), 15 (lane 5), 30 (lane 6), and 60 (lane 7) min at 37°C.

IP, immunoprecipitation; IB, immunoblot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To ensure that the association of SHPTP2 with pp115 was not restricted to CHO cells expressing high levels of the insulin receptor, we also investigated the association of the pp115 protein with SHPTP2 in the insulin-responsive 3T3L1 adipocytes. In this cell type, insulin also stimulated the coimmunoprecipitation of SHPTP2 with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS1 (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2). Similar to the CHO/IR cells, the relative amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS1 that associated with SHPTP2 was small compared with the association of pp115 with SHPTP2 (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2). PDGF treatment of 3T3L1 adipocytes resulted in the coimmunoprecipitation of the tyrosine-phosphorylated PDGF receptor as well as tyrosine-phosphorylated SHPTP2 without any significant increase in the amount of the tyrosine-phosphorylated 115-kDa protein (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 3). Under these conditions, essentially identical amounts of SHPTP2 protein were immunoprecipitated as determined by an anti-SHPTP2 immunoblot (Fig. 1B, lanes 4-6). To determine the insulin sensitivity of pp115 tyrosine phosphorylation and association with SHPTP2, we treated both CHO/IR and 3T3L1 adipocytes with various concentrations of insulin for 10 min. The cells were detergent-solubilized and immunoprecipitated with an SHPTP2 antibody, followed by phosphotyrosine immunoblotting (Fig. 2). In these experiments, a small amount of pp115 was coimmunoprecipitated with SHPTP2 in untreated CHO/IR cells (Fig. 2A, lane 1). Incubation of the cells with insulin resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the extent of tyrosine-phosphorylated pp115 in the SHPTP2 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2A, lanes 2-5). Insulin treatment of 3T3L1 adipocytes also resulted in a similar dose response of coimmunoprecipitated pp115 (Fig. 2B, lanes 1-4). In multiple experiments, the ED50 for both cell types was ~1 nM. As observed in Fig. 1, the amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS1 coimmunoprecipitated by the SHPTP2 antibody in both the CHO/IR and 3T3L1 adipocyte cell extracts was relatively low compared with that of pp115. In addition, the insulin concentration dependence of pp115 tyrosine phosphorylation and association with SHPTP2 was similar to that observed for insulin receptor β-subunit, IRS1, and Shc tyrosine phosphorylation (data not shown). To examine the rapidity of these events, we next determined the insulin time dependence of pp115 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 3). In CHO/IR cells, approximately half-maximal tyrosine phosphorylation of pp115 was observed in the SHPTP2 immunoprecipitates after only a 0.5-min stimulation with insulin (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 2). Maximal tyrosine phosphorylation of pp115 occurred by 2 min and remained at this level over the next 60 min (Fig. 3A, lanes 3-7). Similarly, maximal phosphorylation of IRS1 (185 kDa) and the insulin receptor β-subunit (95 kDa) was observed between 0.5 and 2 min and declined slightly over the following 60-min time period (data not shown). Insulin stimulation of 3T3L1 adipocytes for 0.5 min resulted in a partial increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation and association of pp115 with SHPTP2 (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 2). Maximal tyrosine phosphorylation of the SHPTP2-associated pp115 protein occurred by 2 min and remained unchanged following 15 min of insulin stimulation (Fig. 3B, lanes 3-5). Consistent with previous studies demonstrating the specific association of tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS1 with SHPTP2, we have observed the presence of IRS1 in the SHPTP2 immunoprecipitates from CHO/IR and 3T3L1 adipocyte cell extracts (Figs. 1-3). However, the relative phosphotyrosine signal intensity of IRS1 was low compared with that of the pp115 protein. Since antibodies to the pp115 protein were not available, we therefore determined the relative amount of IRS1 that was associated with SHPTP2 compared with the total amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS1 (Fig. 4). As previously observed, treatment of 3T3L1 adipocytes with insulin stimulated the association of SHPTP2 with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS1, pp115, and a band that comigrated with the apparent mobility of Shc (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 2). However, immunoprecipitation of the resulting supernatant from the first SHPTP2 immunoprecipitation with an IRS1 antiserum demonstrated that the majority of tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS1 was not associated with SHPTP2 (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 4). In addition, two tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins distinct from pp115 were also detected. These could represent either other proteins associated with IRS1, including the insulin receptor β-subunit, or more likely degradation productions of IRS1. In any case, the tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS1 present in the second immunoprecipitation was ~96% of the total amount of IRS1 immunoprecipitated from the cell extracts, whereas the percentage of IRS1 coimmunoprecipitated with SHPTP2 was ~4%. To determine the efficiency of the initial SHPTP2 immunoprecipitation, SHPTP2 immunoblotting was performed on the initial SHPTP2 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4A, lanes 5 and 6), and the resulting supernatants were subjected to a second round of SHPTP2 immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4A, lanes 7 and 8). These data demonstrate that the initial immunoprecipitation with the SHPTP2 antibody quantitatively immunoprecipitates all of the SHPTP2 protein present in the cell extract. The small amount of immunoblotted SHPTP2 protein detected in Fig. 4A (lane 7) represents spill-over from lane 6 and was not due to incomplete clearance from the initial SHPTP2 immunoprecipitation. In a complementary approach, we next determined the relative amount of the total SHPTP2 pool associated with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS1 (Fig. 4B). 3T3L1 adipocyte extracts from control and insulin-stimulated cells were immunoprecipitated with the IRS1 antiserum. Phosphotyrosine Western blotting demonstrated the expected presence of IRS1 following insulin stimulation (Fig. 4B, lanes 1 and 2). The resulting supernatants from the initial IRS1 immunoprecipitation were then subjected to a second round of IRS1 immunoprecipitation. Phosphotyrosine Western blotting following the second IRS1 immunoprecipitation demonstrated the presence of tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS1, but at a significantly reduced level (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 4). Laser scanning densitometry of several experiments indicated that the initial incubation with the IRS1 antiserum resulted in the immunoprecipitation of ~80% of the total tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS1 pool. Nevertheless, the IRS1 immunoprecipitate from insulin-stimulated cell extracts displayed barely detectable levels of immunoreactive SHPTP2 protein (Fig. 4B, lanes 5 and 6). In contrast, when the supernatants from the initial IRS1 immunoprecipitation were incubated with an SHPTP2 antibody, essentially all of the SHPTP2 protein was detected (Fig. 4B, lanes 7 and 8). Even though the amount of SHPTP2 protein detected in the initial IRS1 immunoprecipitate from extracts of insulin-stimulated cells was relatively low (Fig. 4B, lane 6), after correction for the efficiency of IRS1 immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4B, lanes 2 and 4), we estimate that <2% of the total SHPTP2 protein pool was associated with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS1. We next attempted to determine whether pp115 was related to other known tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of this approximate molecular mass range. Following insulin stimulation, CHO/IR cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with antibodies to c-Dbl, STAT2, Jak1, Jak2, Jak3, Tyk2, Ras GTPase-activating protein, and the p120 Src substrate. These antibodies failed to demonstrate the presence of any specific tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in phosphotyrosine immunoblots (data not shown). In addition, a very weak pp120 tyrosine-phosphorylated band was detected in c-Cbl immunoprecipitates; however, it was not insulin-dependent (data not shown). We next determined whether the small adapter proteins Crk, Nck, and Grb2 could specifically interact with pp115 (Fig. 5). As controls, SHPTP2 immunoprecipitation of extracts from untreated and insulin-stimulated CHO/IR cells demonstrated the coimmunoprecipitation of tyrosine-phosphorylated pp115, IRS1, and a small amount of Shc (Fig. 5A, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, immunoprecipitation with a Crk (Fig. 5A, lanes 3 and 4) or Nck (lanes 5 and 6) antibody did not indicate the presence of pp115. Similarly, immunoprecipitation with a Grb2 antibody (Fig. 5B, lanes 3 and 4) clearly demonstrated the insulin-dependent coimmunoprecipitation of tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS1 and Shc, but not pp115. Furthermore, the amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS1 coimmunoprecipitated by the Grb2 antibody was substantially greater than that coimmunoprecipitated by the SHPTP2 antibody (Fig. 5B, lanes 1 and 2). Consistent with Fig. 4, these data indicate that the IRS1•Grb2 complex does not contain significant amounts of the SHPTP2 protein. The Grb2 and SHPTP2 immunoprecipitates also contained similar amounts of a phosphotyrosine band that migrated with the molecular mass of Shc. This finding is in agreement with previous studies demonstrating that tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc is a major Grb2-binding protein(43Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4427-4434Google Scholar, 46Sasaoka T. Draznin B. Leitner J.W. Langlois W.J. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10734-10738Google Scholar). Since the series of coimmunoprecipitations described above failed to identify the nature of this insulin-stimulated tyrosine-phosphorylated protein, we further characterized the binding interaction between SHPTP2 and the pp115 protein by increased expression of SHPTP2 (Fig. 6). Mammalian expression plasmids were constructed that contained an amino-terminal Myc epitope tag with either a wild-type SHPTP2 cDNA (Myc-WT-SHPTP2) or a catalytically inactive SHPTP2 point mutant in which cysteine 459 was replaced by serine (Myc-C/S-SHPTP2). Quantitative expression of these cDNAs by electroporation into CHO/IR cells (44Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol Chem. 1994; 269: 31107-31114Google Scholar) resulted in an ~3-fold increase in the total amount of SHPTP2 protein levels compared with cells transfected with the empty vector alone (data not shown). As expected, immunoprecipitation with the Myc epitope monoclonal antibody (9E10) did not result in the coimmunoprecipitation of the SHPTP2 protein from mock-transfected cells (Fig. 6A, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, the SHPTP2 protein was readily observed in the 9E10 immunoprecipitates from CHO/IR cells transfected with either wild-type SHPTP2 (Myc-WT-SHPTP2) or the phosphatase-inactive SHPTP2 mutant (Myc-C/S-SHPTP2) (Fig. 6A, lanes 3-6). Furthermore, insulin treatment had no significant effect on the expression levels of the SHPTP2 proteins (Fig. 6, compare lanes 3 and 5 with lanes 4 and 6, respectively). To determine the effect of SHPTP2 expression on the coimmunoprecipitation and tyrosine phosphorylation of pp115, the transfected CHO/IR cells were immunoprecipitated with an SHPTP2 antibody and subjected to phosphotyrosine immunoblotting (Fig. 6B). As previously observed, pp115 was coimmunoprecipitated with SHPTP2 in cells transfected with the empty expression vector (Fig. 6B, lanes 1 and 2). Increased expression of wild-type SHPTP2 (Myc-WT-SHPTP2) had no significant effect on the extent of SHPTP2-coimmunoprecipitated tyrosine-phosphorylated pp115 following insulin stimulation (Fig. 6B, lanes 3 and 4). However, expression of the phosphatase-negative SHPTP2 mutant (Myc-C/S-SHPTP2) increased the basal coimmunoprecipitation of pp115 with SHPTP2 (Fig. 6B, lane 5) and markedly enhanced the detection of tyrosine-phosphorylated pp115 following insulin stimulation (Fig. 6B, lane 6). To confirm the association of pp115 with the proteins encoded by the transfected SHPTP2 cDNAs, we also immunoprecipitated the transfected SHPTP2 proteins with the 9E10 antibody (Fig. 6C). The insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the pp115 protein was also detected in the 9E10 immunoprecipitates from cells expressing the wild-type SHPTP2 cDNA (Myc-WT-SHPTP2), but not from cells transfected with the empty vector (Fig. 6C, lanes 1-4). In addition, a small amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS1 was coimmunoprecipitated with the 9E10 antibody in the Myc-WT-SHPTP2-transfected cells following insulin stimulation, but not in the mock-transfected cells. In contrast, a marked increase in the amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated pp115 was detected in the 9E10 immunoprecipitates of extracts from cells expressing the catalytically inactive SHPTP2 mutant (Myc-C/S-SHPTP2) (Fig. 6C, lanes 5 and 6). Furthermore, both the basal and insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the mutant SHPTP2 protein was observed (Fig. 6C, lanes 5 and 6). These changes in tyrosine phosphorylation occurred with no effect on the extent of coimmunoprecipitated tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS1. It should be noted that both a pp120 protein and the insulin receptor β-subunit were also apparently coimmunoprecipitated with the 9E10 monoclonal antibody. However, the presence of these proteins in the immunoprecipitates from mock-transfected cells indicates that they were nonspecifically immunoprecipitated with the 9E10 antibody (Fig. 6C, lanes 1 and 2). Nevertheless, these data clearly demonstrate that the degree of pp115 tyrosine phosphorylation and/or its extent of association with SHPTP2 largely depends upon the protein tyrosine-specific phosphatase activity of SHPTP2. Over the past several years, substantial progress has been made in elucidating various intracellular signaling events mediating positive protein-protein interactions by tyrosine kinase receptor activation. On the other hand, the processes that mediate the inactivation of these events through tyrosine dephosphorylation remain less defined. The tyrosine phosphatase SHPTP2 is characteristic of a family of related cytosolic enzymes that contain two amino-terminal SH2 domains(12Freeman Jr., R.M. Plutzky J. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11239-11243Google Scholar, 13Vogel W. Lammers R. Huang J. Ullrich A. Science. 1993; 259: 1611-1614Google Scholar, 14Hiraga A. Munakata H. Hata K. Suzuki Y. Tsuiki S. Eur. J.

This phosphatase is ubiquitously expressed and is regulated by its association with a variety of tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors and receptor substrates through engagement of its SH2 domains. For example, SHPTP2 has been observed to associate with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS1, resulting in the stimulation of catalytic activity(22Sugimoto S. Lechleider R.J. Shoelson S.E. Neel B.G. Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22771-22776Google Scholar, 23Sugimoto S. Wandless T. Shoelson S.E. Neel B.G. Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13614-13622Google Scholar, 24Lechleider R.J.

Several laboratories have also demonstrated that expression of a catalytically inactive SHPTP2 protein inhibits the insulin stimulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, thereby blocking c-fos transcription and mitogenesis(37Noguchi T. Matszaki T. Horita K. Fujioka Y. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6674-6682Google Scholar, 38Milarski K.L. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21239-21243Google Scholar, 39Yamauchi K.

Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21244-21248Google Scholar). Thus, SHPTP2 appears to serve an essential role in the growth-promoting actions of insulin in a fashion analogous to the Drosophila homologue of SHPTP2, corkscrew, which is required for normal anterior/posterior development(33Ambrosio L. Mahowald A. Perrimon N. Nature. 1989; 342: 288-290Google Scholar, 34Casanova J. Struhl G. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 2025-2038Google Scholar, 35Sprenger F. Stevens L.M. Nuesslein-Volhard C. Nature. 1989; 338: 478-483Google Scholar, 36Perkins L.A. Larsen I. Perrimon N. Cell. 1992; 70: 225-236Google Scholar). Even though these data suggest that SHPTP2 is a required positive effector of tyrosine kinase signaling, its physiological targets have not been identified. Based upon in vitro studies, it was suggested that the insulin-stimulated association of SHPTP2 with IRS1 functioned to dephosphorylate the tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS1 protein (47Kuhne M.R. Zhao Z. Rowles J. Lavan B.E. Shen S.H. Fischer E.H. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15833-15837Google Scholar). However, expression of either wild-type SHPTP2 or a catalytically inactive SHPTP2 mutant did not significantly affect the insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation state of IRS1(37Noguchi T. Matszaki T. Horita K. Fujioka Y. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6674-6682Google Scholar, 38Milarski K.L. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21239-21243Google Scholar, 39Yamauchi K. Milarski K.L. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 664-668Google Scholar). Consistent with these reports, we have observed that only a very small fraction (<4%) of the total pool of tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS1 was associated with SHPTP2 following insulin stimulation of 3T3L1 adipocytes. Although we have been unable to quantitatively immunoprecipitate IRS1 from 3T3L1 cell extracts, semiquantitative analysis also indicated that only a very small fraction (<2%) of the total SHPTP2 pool was coimmunoprecipitated with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS1. Taken together, these data suggest that IRS1 is not the predominant target of SHPTP2 binding and/or function in 3T3L1 adipocytes. To identify the insulin-stimulated substrate(s) and/or protein(s) associated with SHPTP2, we screened cell extracts for tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins that were coimmunoprecipitated with an SHPTP2 antibody. In this manner, we have identified a predominant tyrosine-phosphorylated band in the 115-kDa region of SDS gels that was coimmunoprecipitated with SHPTP2 from insulin-stimulated CHO/IR and 3T3L1 adipocytes. The tyrosine phosphorylation and/or association of this broad pp115 band with SHPTP2 was not observed following PDGF stimulation, although a doublet migrating in this molecular mass range has been reported following epidermal growth factor stimulation(17Feng G.-S. Hui C.-C. Pawson T. Science. 1993; 259: 1607-1611Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, we have also detected a similar SHPTP2-associated pp115 protein in both epidermal growth factor- and nerve growth factor-treated PC12 cells (data not shown). In addition to its function as the predominant tyrosine-phosphorylated SHPTP2-binding protein, pp115 also appears to be an in vivo substrate for the SHPTP2 phosphatase. This speculation is consistent with the large increase in the amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated pp115 that was coimmunoprecipitated with SHPTP2 following expression of the catalytically inactive SHPTP2 mutant. However, it should be noted that in these studies, we were not able to distinguish between the amount of pp115 bound to SHPTP2 versus the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation. Interestingly, the pp115 protein was highly diffuse, perhaps representing heterogeneity at the level of phosphorylation or, alternatively, the presence of multiple, closely related molecular mass phosphoproteins. In some gels, this region appeared to be composed of several closely spaced but discrete protein bands. However, this separation was quite variable, and we have not yet found a gel system to reproducibly separate these bands. Since a variety of proteins in the 115-125-kDa range have been shown to be tyrosine-phosphorylated, we attempted to identify these components by immunoprecipitation with known antibodies. However, we were unable to coimmunoprecipitate any insulin-stimulated tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins with antibodies directed against Jak1, Jak2, Jak3, Tyk2, STAT2, Ras GTPase-activation protein, c-Dbl, c-Cbl, or the p120 Src substrate. In addition, Grb2 and Crk have been observed to coimmunoprecipitate several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in this molecular mass range following T cell activation(21Sawasdikosol S. Ravichandran K.S. Lee K.K. Chang J.-H. Burakoff S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2893-2896Google Scholar, 45Donovan J.A. Wange R.L. Langdon W.Y. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22921-22926Google Scholar). However, coimmunoprecipitation with Grb2, Crk, and Nck antibodies was also unsuccessful in identifying any insulin-stimulated tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in this molecular mass range. Recently, a tyrosine-phosphorylated SHPTP2-associated 120-kDa protein was detected in NIH 3T3 cells expressing high levels of the human insulin receptor(38Milarski K.L. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21239-21243Google Scholar). However, the pp115 protein identified in this study has distinctly different properties. For example, the previously described 120-kDa protein could not be detected by immunoprecipitation with an SHPTP2 antibody. In addition, the tyrosine-phosphorylated 120-kDa protein was only observed in cells expressing a catalytically inactive SHPTP2 mutant by precipitation with an amino-terminal SHPTP2 SH2 domain fusion protein. In contrast, the pp115 protein identified in the present study was readily detected by coimmunoprecipitation with an SHPTP2 antibody in extracts from both control and wild-type SHPTP2-expressing cells. Furthermore, we have not observed any precipitation of pp115 from either CHO/IR or 3T3L1 adipocyte cell extracts with the SHPTP2 SH2 fusion protein (data not shown). In summary, we have identified the predominant insulin-stimulated tyrosine-phosphorylated SHPTP2-associated protein(s) as a diffuse pp115 band. The tyrosine phosphorylation and association with SHPTP2 displayed a similar insulin dose responsiveness compared with IRS1 and the insulin receptor β-subunit itself. Furthermore, since pp115 was tyrosine-phosphorylated with a slightly slower time course than IRS1, we speculate that pp115 functions as a direct substrate of the insulin receptor kinase, which subsequently associates with SHPTP2. In addition, the increased association and tyrosine phosphorylation of pp115 observed in cells expressing a catalytically inactive SHPTP2 mutant strongly suggest that pp115 functions as an in vivo substrate for the SHPTP2 phosphatase activity. The fact that SHPTP2 appears to be an essential upstream effector for insulin-dependent stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling also argues for a role of pp115 in this pathway. Clarification of these issues and identification of the physiological function of pp115 will require the molecular cloning and isolation of pp115-specific antibodies.

This enzyme system consists of two inducible protein components, which were purified, characterized, and identified as reductase and oxygenase. The yellow reductase is a monomeric iron-sulfur flavoprotein (Mr, 38,000), containing flavin adenine dinucleotide and plant-type ferredoxin [2Fe-2S]. It transferred electrons from NADH to the oxygenase or to some artificial electron acceptors. The red-brown oxygenase (Mr, 330,000) consists of six identical subunits (Mr, 55,000) and was identified as an iron-sulfur protein, possessing about six Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] clusters and additional iron. It was reduced by NADH plus catalytic amounts of reductase. For monooxygenase activity, reductase, oxygenase, NADH, molecular oxygen, and substrate were required. The activity was considerably enhanced by the addition of polyethylene glycol and Fe2+. 2-Oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline 8-monooxygenase revealed a high substrate specificity toward 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline, since none of 25 other tested compounds was converted.

The soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida 86 utilizes quinoline as sole source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy. The occurrence of the metabolites 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline, 8-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline, 8-hydroxycoumarin, and 2,3-dihydroxyphenylpropionic acid revealed that the degradation of quinoline proceeds in this organism via the so called “coumarin pathway”(1Schwarz G.

Quinoline 2-oxidoreductase from this organism, catalyzing the initial nucleophilic attack of quinoline at C-2, yielding 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline, is investigated thoroughly(3Bauder R. Tshisuaka B.

However, no enzymatic study is available concerning the further conversions of 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline in the “coumarin pathway.” In this paper, we present the purification and characterization of 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline 8-monooxygenase.

After 15 h of growth, cells were washed twice with 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) and suspended (adjusting A578 to 2.2) in fresh mineral salts medium containing (i) 2.8 mM 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline or (ii) 2.8 mM 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline plus 50 mg/liter chloramphenicol. Degradation of 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline was monitored spectrophotometrically at 323 nm. Large-scale growth of bacteria was carried out in a 100-liter fermenter with quinoline as substrate. Bacterial growth and concentrations of quinoline and 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline were measured spectrophotometrically according to Bauder et al.(3Bauder R. Tshisuaka B. Lingens F. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1990; 371: 1137-1144Google Scholar). After 9, 23, 32, and 48 h of fermentation, bacteria were fed with 4 mM quinoline. After total consumption of quinoline and 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), and stored at −20°C. All purification steps were carried out at 4°C, except for fast protein liquid chromatography (DEAE-Fractogel EMD and Superose 12), which was performed at room temperature. All pH values given refer to room temperature. In Step 1, frozen cells (40 g, wet weight) were thawed in 40 ml of standard buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.3) and disrupted 5 min in time intervals of 0.5 s in a sonifier (model 450, Branson Inc., Danbury, CT) with maximal power. The suspension was centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 40 min. In Step 2, the supernatant was diluted with the same volume of standard buffer and loaded for anion-exchange chromatography onto a DEAE-cellulose DE-52 column (2.5 × 39 cm) equilibrated in standard buffer. The column was washed with the same buffer, and bound proteins were desorbed with a linear gradient (800 ml) of KCl (0-0.6 M) in standard buffer at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. This purification step largely separated the reductase from the oxygenase. In Step 3, fractions containing the reductase were combined and adjusted to 0.8 M (NH4)2SO4. For hydrophobic interaction chromatography, the solution was applied to a column of phenyl-Sepharose (2.5 × 5 cm) equilibrated in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.8 M (NH4)2SO4 and 1 mM dithiothreitol. The column was rinsed with 200 ml of the same buffer, and proteins were eluted with a linear gradient (300 ml) of 0.8-0 M (NH4)2SO4, 50-10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0-10% (v/v) ethanol, containing 1 mM dithiothreitol. The flow rate was 3 ml/min. The combined fractions with reductase activity were rinsed with 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, containing 1 mM dithiothreitol, by ultrafiltration with a YM-10 membrane. In Step 4, for a second anion-exchange chromatography, the concentrated protein solution was applied to a DEAE-Fractogel EMD column (1 × 14 cm) equilibrated in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, containing 1 mM dithiothreitol. The column was rinsed with 3 ml of the same buffer, and a linear gradient (35 ml) of 0-0.5 M (NH4)2SO4 was applied at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Active fractions were pooled and concentrated to 0.5 ml by ultrafiltration with a YM-10 membrane. In Step 5, for gel filtration, the protein solution was loaded onto Superose 12 (1.5 × 28 cm), which was equilibrated in 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, containing 1 mM dithiothreitol. Proteins were separated at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions containing the reductase were pooled and stored at −80°C. Preparation of crude extract (Step 1′) and chromatography on DEAE-cellulose DE-52 (Step 2′) were performed as described above for the reductase, except that a crude extract from 20 g (wet weight) of cells was used. In Step 3′, fractions from DEAE-cellulose DE-52 containing the oxygenase were pooled and adjusted to 0.6 M (NH4)2SO4 and 3% (w/v) glycerol. The solution was loaded on a column of phenyl-Sepharose (2.5 × 5 cm), equilibrated in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.6 M (NH4)2SO4, 3% (w/v) glycerol, and 0.1 mM 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline. The column was washed with the same buffer, and the oxygenase was eluted by omitting (NH4)2SO4 from the buffer. To avoid severe losses of oxygenase activity, fast performance of all steps demanding high (NH4)2SO4 concentrations was substantial (flow rate, 10 ml/min). In Step 4′, after concentrating the eluate by ultrafiltration (YM-30 membrane), it was passed through a Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration column (2.5 × 92 cm; flow rate, 0.5 ml/min) using standard buffer containing 50 mM KCl and 0.1 mM 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline. In Step 5′, for adsorption chromatography on hydroxyapatite, which was prepared by the method of Atkinson et al.(6Atkinson A. Bradford P.A. Selmes I.P. J. Appl. Chem. Biotechnol. 1973; 23: 517-529Google Scholar), fractions with oxygenase activity were combined and adjusted to pH 7.2 with 1 M acetate buffer, pH 5.0. Glycerol was included to a final concentration of 3% (w/v), and 1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, was added to a final concentration of 10 mM. The solution was applied to a column of hydroxyapatite (2.5 × 5 cm), equilibrated in 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 3% (w/v) glycerol and 0.1 mM 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline. The column was washed with the same buffer. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient (300 ml) of 10-300 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2 (3% (w/v) glycerol and 0.1 mM 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline), at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. For reproducible results, hydroxyapatite was used only once. Fractions containing the oxygenase were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration with a YM-30 membrane, and stored at −80°C. Since the oxygenase lost 50% specific activity when stored in standard buffer for 3 days at 4°C, different stabilizers were tested: 10% (w/v) glycerol, 10% (v/v) ethanol, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1-10 mM mercaptoethanol, 1 mM glutathione, 0.1-1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1-1 mM (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2, and 0.1 mM 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline. Further attempts to preserve enzyme activity were made by using other buffers (pH 6-8.5) or purification procedures such as precipitation with (NH4)2SO4, PEG, or ethanol, chromatography on Superdex 200, chelating Sepharose, calcium tartrate or Mono-Q (anion exchange), and preparative native gel electrophoresis. Progress in enzyme purification was monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with 10% separating and 4% stacking gels(7Schgger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Google Scholar). The 1-mm slab gels were stained in 0.2% (w/v) Coomassie Blue R-250 in water/methanol/acetic acid (40:50:10). Analytical isoelectric focusing was performed in rehydrated gels as recommended by Pharmacia(8Schickle H. Westermeier R. Pharmacia Bulletin. Freiburg, Germany1987Google Scholar). The native molecular weight of the reductase was determined by gel filtration through Superose 12 in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, containing 150 mM NaCl. The native molecular weight of the oxygenase was estimated by gel filtration on Superdex 200 in 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. The molecular weights of peptides under denaturing conditions were determined using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis(7Schgger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Google Scholar). Absorption spectra were measured in cells of 1-cm path length at 25°C with a Uvicon 930 spectrometer (Kontron Instruments, Neufahrn, Germany). The flavin cofactor was extracted from the reductase by two methods. The component in 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) was boiled for 4 min or treated with trichloroacetic acid as described by Siegel(9Siegel L.M. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 53: 419-429Google Scholar). After removal of protein by centrifugation and ultrafiltration, the yellow filtrate was examined by UV-visible spectroscopy (ϵFAD, 450 nm, 11,300 M-1 cm-1(10Whitby L.G. Biochem. J. 1953; 54: 437-442Google Scholar)) and by reversed phase HPLC on a Lichrospher RP18 column according to Nielsen et al.(11Nielsen P. Rauschenbach P. Bacher A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 122: 209-220Google Scholar). 0.2 M formic acid, 0.1 M ammonia/methanol (3:1) was used as eluent. Acid-labile sulfur was determined by the formation of methylene blue as described by Beinert(12Beinert H. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 373-378Google Scholar). Bovine milk xanthine oxidase was used as a standard. Analysis of metals was done with an x-ray fluorescence spectrometer (System 77 Finnigan Int. Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Protein concentrations were determined according to Bradford (13Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard. The activity of 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline 8-monooxygenase was measured at 25°C spectrophotometrically at 365 nm as NADH consumption (standard assay, ϵ365, 3,400 M-1 cm-1(14Bergmeyer H.U. Z. Klin. Chem. Klin. Biochem. 1975; 13: 507-508Google Scholar)) or polarographically as oxygen uptake with a Clark-type oxygen electrode (YSI4004, Yellow Springs Instrument Co., Yellow Springs, OH). The reaction was optimized for temperature, pH, and buffer as well as for the concentrations of buffer, PEG, Fe2+, NADH, and 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline. The 21 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) contained 7% PEG, 0.05 mM (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2, 0.25 mM NADH, and suitable amounts of reductase and oxygenase components. The reaction was started by the addition of 0.2 mM 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline. All estimations were corrected for NADH or oxygen consumption recorded in the absence of substrate. 1 unit of 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline 8-monooxygenase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that consumed 1 μmol of NADH or 1 μmol of oxygen per min. The enzyme activity was not proportional to the crude extract concentration in the assay mixture. To achieve a proportional relationship, the activity of the reductase was measured in the presence of an excess amount of the oxygenase component and vice versa. These components to be added had been enriched by the purification steps 1 and 2. They were stored at −80°C until use. Substrate consumption and product formation were monitored by HPLC (Nucleosil RP18 column, eluent: 30% (v/v) methanol) with UV-visible spectroscopic detection at 200-400 nm. Substrate conversion was further confirmed by thin layer chromatography of ethyl acetate extracts of the acidified assay mixtures (silica gel plates; solvent system, toluene/dioxane/acetic acid (72:16:1.6)(1Schwarz G. Bauder R. Speer M. Rommel T.O. Lingens F. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1989; 370: 1183-1189Google Scholar)). Authentic 8-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline served as product reference in both assays. The reaction mixtures contained 1.1 units of reductase, 12.5 milliunits of oxygenase, 0.05 mM (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2, 2 mM NADH, and 2 mM 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5). Transformation of other putative substrates, causing oxygen consumption, was monitored likewise. Enzyme activity under anaerobic conditions (achieved by repeated degassing and flushing with nitrogen) was examined by thin layer chromatography as described above. NADH:acceptor reductase activity was assayed at 25°C spectrophotometrically as reduction of the artificial electron acceptors INT (ϵ503, 19,300 M-1 cm-1(15Babson A.L. Babson S.R. Clin. Chem. 1973; 19: 766-769Google Scholar)), DCPIP (ϵ600, 21,000 M-1 cm-1(16Armstrong J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 86: 194-197Google Scholar)), cytochrome c (ϵ550, 21,000 M-1 cm-1(17Massey V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1959; 34: 255-256Google Scholar)), and potassium hexacyanoferrate III (ferricyanide) (ϵ420, 1,020 M-1 cm-1(18Schellenberg K.A. Hellerman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 231: 547-556Google Scholar)). The reaction mixture contained 27 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 0.05 mM electron acceptor, and 0.25 mM NADH. The reaction was started by the addition of 5-20 μl of protein solution. 1 unit of NADH:acceptor reductase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that reduced 1 μmol of electron acceptor per min. The effects of several putative inhibitors on NADH:DCPIP reductase activity and on 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline 8-monooxygenase activity (standard assay) were examined in the absence of Fe2+. Assay mixtures were preincubated 2 min with each compound (0.5 mM). The protein concentrations were 14 μg/ml in the NADH:DCPIP reductase assay and 760 μg/ml in the standard assay. Cells of P. putida 86, grown on glucose as sole source of carbon and energy, did not metabolize 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline in the presence of chloramphenicol, an inhibitor of protein synthesis. Without chloramphenicol, these cells degraded 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline after a lag phase of 2 h. Cells, grown on 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline, converted this substrate immediately when added anew without being affected by the addition of chloramphenicol. Thus, the degradation of 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline was dependent on protein biosynthesis induced by 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline. Extracts of cells, grown on glucose or succinate, showed neither reductase nor oxygenase activity of 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline 8-monooxygenase. If cells were grown on 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline, a specific reductase activity of 1.24 units/mg protein and a specific oxygenase activity of 0.35 units/mg protein was measured in the cell extracts. Therefore, we propose that both components of 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline 8-monooxygenase in P. putida 86 are inducible by the substrate 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline. The results of a typical purification procedure are summarized in Table 1. The reductase was purified 108-fold in a yield of 3%. The oxygenase activity was enriched only 2.4-fold. However, as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, a high enrichment of the oxygenase protein in relation to other cell proteins was evident (Fig. 1). A rough estimate by comparing the gels of the oxygenase and reductase suggests that the increase in specific activity should have been around 100-fold. We assume that the oxygenase lost activity during the purification procedure despite stabilizing it with glycerol and substrate. Other tested stabilizers or purification procedures were even less effective in preserving enzyme activity.TABLE I Open table in a new tab The preparations of reductase and oxygenase were nearly homogeneous as shown by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1). The native molecular weight of purified reductase was determined to 39,000 by gel filtration. Its molecular weight determined under denaturing and reducing conditions by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was 37,000. Thus, we propose the reductase to be a monomer. Gel filtration of the oxygenase resulted in a native molecular weight of 330,000. Since SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the oxygenase revealed only one protein band corresponding to a molecular weight of 55,000, we suggest that the oxygenase is composed of six identical subunits. The isoelectric point of the purified reductase was 4.6. The oxygenase, which was nearly homogeneous as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, separated in isoelectric focusing as a cluster of bands within the range of pH 4.9-5.4. As observed by other authors(19Frater R. J. Chromatogr. 1970; 50: 469-474Google Scholar, 20Cann J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 61: 142-147Google Scholar), the formation of multiple bands might be an artifact due to complex formation of proteins with carrier ampholytes. In the oxidized state, the reductase was yellow in color. The UV-visible absorption spectrum showed maxima at 271 and 456 nm, a broad double peak at 337 and 381 nm, and shoulders at about 427 and 550 nm (Fig. 2). The reductase was reduced and bleached by the addition of NADH. After boiling and centrifuging a reductase solution, the supernatant had an absorption spectrum (Fig. 2, inset) typical for a flavin. Solutions of purified oxygenase, as isolated in the oxidized state, had a red-brown color. The UV-visible absorption spectrum showed maxima at 280, 328, and 460 nm and a shoulder at 545 nm (Fig. 3). Boiling of the oxygenase resulted in the loss of color. The oxygenase as isolated was bleached by chemical reduction with dithionite or by enzymatical reduction with NADH and catalytic amounts of reductase. The addition of NADH alone did not reduce the oxygenase. This finding indicated that the reductase, which was reduced directly by NADH, mediated the electron transfer from NADH to the terminal oxygenase component. Analysis by HPLC revealed an amount of 0.7 mol of FAD/mol of reductase. Spectrophotometrical determination of the FAD content resulted in a ratio of 0.9 mol of FAD/mol of reductase. Average contents of 1.7 ± 0.3 g atom iron and 1.6 ± 0.15 g atom acid-labile sulfur were determined per mol of reductase. 1 mol of oxygenase contained 13.1 ± 1.8 g atom iron and 9.1 ± 0.9 g atom acid-labile sulfur. The absorption spectra (Figure 2:, Figure 3:) indicate that the iron is not bound to a heme-like structure but is part of iron-sulfur clusters. Electron paramagnetic resonance studies revealed that a plant-type ferredoxin [2Fe-2S] cluster with gav = 1.95 is present in the reductase component, whereas the oxygenase component harbors Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] clusters (gav = 1.89).3 3B. Rosche, S. Fetzner, F. Lingens, W. Nitschke, and A. Riedel, submitted for publication. We propose that the reductase contains one FAD and one plant-type ferredoxin [2Fe-2S] cluster and that the oxygenase includes six Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] clusters (i.e. one [2Fe-2S] per subunit) and additional iron. Reductase, oxygenase, NADH, molecular oxygen, and substrate were required for 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline 8-monooxygenase activity. Polarographic determinations of O2 uptake with limiting concentrations of either 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline or NADH revealed a 1:1:1 stoichiometry for 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline:O2:NADH. From the highest specific activities under conditions of the standard assay, turnover numbers of 1235 min-1 (reductase) and 320 min-1 (oxygenase) were calculated. No catalytic activity was detectable under anaerobic conditions. The pH optimum of the enzyme activity was pH 7.5. The optimal temperature was in the range of 25-30°C. The reductase component of 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline 8-monooxygenase showed NADH:acceptor reductase activity not only toward the oxygenase component of this enzyme system but also toward some artificial electron acceptors. Reductase with a specific activity of 40 units/mg, measured in the presence of the oxygenase component (standard assay), showed specific activities of 53, 89, 404, and 501 units/mg with INT, DCPIP, cytochrome c, and ferricyanide, respectively. The oxygenase showed no oxidoreductase activity with these acceptors. In the DCPIP reductase assay, the reductase would reach only 1.3% activity if NADH was replaced by NADPH. The addition of Fe2+ and FAD led to an increase in 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline 8-monooxygenase activity (Table 2). We suggest that these additives might supplement cofactors lost during purification. FMN did not replace FAD, and NADPH was less effective as electron donor than NADH (Table 2). A preincubation of the enzyme components with Fe2+ and FAD (30 min, 4°C) did not further enhance activity.TABLE II Open table in a new tab None of the metal cations Mg2+, Ca2+, Fe3+, Co2+, and Ni2+ (50 μM each) substituted Fe2+ in its enzyme-activating effect. However, the addition of 50 μM Mn2+, Zn2+, or Cu2+ resulted in 14, 56, or 100% loss of activity, respectively, compared to the activity without any supplementary metal salt. In contrast to the 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline 8-monooxygenase activity, the NADH:DCPIP reductase activity was not increased by the addition of Fe2+ or FAD. The NADH:DCPIP reductase was inhibited by Zn2+ and Cu2+ (33 and 100% inhibition), but it was not affected by Mn2+. 2-Oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline (0.2 mM) did not influence the NADH:DCPIP reductase activity. A surprisingly strong activating effect on 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline 8-monooxygenase was observed by the addition of PEG to the enzyme assay. In the absence of PEG, the assay was nonlinear, initially showing only 14% of activity, which slowly increased to 38% within 12 min but never reached 100% as determined in the presence of PEG (Table 2). However, NADH:DCPIP reductase activity was diminished in the presence of PEG (67% residual activity). Substances that modify sulfhydryl groups (p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, N-ethylmaleimide, and iodoacetate, 0.5 mM each) affected both NADH:DCPIP reductase activity (98, 66, and 43% inhibition) and the activity of the complete monooxygenase system (97, 30, and 23% inhibition). Metal chelating agents (EDTA, 4,5-dihydroxy-1,3-benzene disulfonic acid, and 1,10-phenanthroline, 0.5 mM each) did not influence the NADH:DCPIP reductase activity, but the complete enzyme system was inhibited (12, 14, and 95%). 8-Hydroxyquinoline, 8-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline, and coumarin (0.1 mM each) caused substrate-dependent oxygen consumption without being converted. No oxygen consumption was observed with quinoline, 2-/8-monochloroquinoline, 2-/8-monomethylquinoline, quinoline 2-/8-monocarboxylic acid, 4-/5-/6-/7-monohydroxyquinoline, 2,4-/2,6-dihydroxyquinoline, isoquinoline, 1-oxo-1,2-dihydroisoquinoline, pyridine, acridine, indole, carbazole, hypoxanthine, 2-hydroxynaphthalene, and anthraquinone (0.1 mM each). An inducible two-component enzyme system, which catalyzes the NADH-dependent monooxygenation of 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline to 8-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline, was purified from P. putida 86. The enzyme system was termed 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline 8-monooxygenase with the systematic name 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline, NADH:oxygen oxidoreductase (8-hydroxylating). 2-Oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline 8-monooxygenase revealed a high substrate specificity toward 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline, since none of 25 other compounds tested was converted. However, 8-hydroxyquinoline, 8-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline, and coumarin caused substrate-dependent oxygen consumption without being attacked. We assume that these compounds served as pseudosubstrates, uncoupling electron transfer from substrate hydroxylation with concomitant production of H2O2. This effect has been reported for some other oxygenases, e.g. orcinol hydroxylase(21Ribbons D.W. Ohta Y. FEBS Lett. 1970; 12: 105-108Google Scholar), salicylate hydroxylase(22White-Stevens R.H. Kamin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2358-2370Google Scholar), or 4-methoxybenzoate monooxygenase(23Bernhardt F.-H. Erdin N. Staudinger H. Ullrich V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 35: 126-134Google Scholar). Since exogenously added H2O2 decayed spontaneously under our test conditions, even in absence of any protein, H2O2 consequently was undetectable in the enzyme assay. A first hint that 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline 8-monooxygenase is a multicomponent enzyme system was the nonproportional relationship between enzyme activity and protein concentration. The specific enzyme activity decreased with protein dilution instead of remaining constant. Since contact of the two soluble enzyme components is a prerequisite for monooxygenase activity, a delayed binding may explain the nonlinear time dependence of activity in the absence of PEG (Table 2). The mechanism of enzyme activation by PEG might be based on strengthening the component contact due to its hygroscopic property. To profit from this activating effect, other multicomponent enzyme systems should be tested for the influence of PEG. Fig. 4 presents a model for the electron transport chain from NADH to the substrate hydroxylating terminal oxygenase. NADH transmits two electrons simultaneously as hydride, whereas iron-sulfur centers are restricted to one-electron reactions. The function of the reductase is to mediate this two-electron/one-electron transformation by its flavin cofactor. The oxygenase contains besides its Rieske-type iron-sulfur clusters additional iron. The necessity of iron for the catalytic function of the oxygenase component is demonstrated by the fact that metal chelating agents inhibited 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline 8-monooxygenase activity, while NADH:acceptor reductase activity was not affected. This agrees with the result that added ferrous iron did not increase NADH:acceptor reductase activity, whereas the complete enzyme reaction was accelerated. Therefore, we propose that ferrous iron is a weakly associated cofactor of the oxygenase component, which is abstracted easily by metal chelating agents or during enzyme purification and which may be replaced by exogenously added ferrous iron. According to our data, 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline 8-monooxygenase belongs to the group of non-heme iron multicomponent oxygenases, which contain both iron-sulfur clusters and additional iron in their oxygenase component. In contrast to flavin-containing single component monooxygenases or cytochrome P-450 multicomponent monooxygenases, which activate dioxygen by FAD or heme-bound iron, respectively(24Sariaslani F.S. Crit. Rev. Biotechnol. 1989; 9: 170-257Google Scholar), non-heme iron oxygenases are supposed to activate dioxygen by protein-bound iron(25Mason J.R. Cammack R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 277-305Google Scholar). In the case of the oxygenase component of the O-demethylating 4-methoxybenzoate monooxygenase (putidamonooxin), mononuclear non-heme iron was demonstrated to mediate the electron transfer from a Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] cluster to molecular oxygen, thus activating the dioxygen as iron-peroxo complex for the electrophilic attack of the organic substrate(26Adrian W. Bernhardt F.-H. Bill E. Gersonde K. Heymann E. Trautwein A. Twilfer H. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1980; 361: 211Google Scholar, 27Bill E. Bernhardt F.-H. Trautwein A.X. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 121: 39-46Google Scholar). This model might be representative for all known multicomponent non-heme iron oxygenases, which contain Rieske-type iron-sulfur clusters and mononuclear iron in their terminal oxygenase component.

Ballou D.P. Correll C.C. Mller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 543-556Google Scholar) grouped them into the three classes I, II, and III, based on the number of protein components and on the redox centers involved in electron transport from NAD(P)H to the terminal oxygenase component. At least two redox centers, a flavin and a [2Fe-2S] center, are involved in this electron transfer. A second [2Fe-2S] center is possible. The redox centers can be located on one or two protein components, thus constituting two- or three-component enzyme systems. Class I enzymes are two-component enzyme systems with a flavin (FMN in class IA, FAD in class IB) and a plant-type ferredoxin [2Fe-2S] in the reductase. In class II enzymes, the flavin (always FAD) and the [2Fe-2S] center are located on separate components. The [2Fe-2S] center is a plant-type ferredoxin (class IIA) or a Rieske-type center (class IIB). Class III enzymes contain FAD and plant-type ferredoxin in the reductase as well as a Rieske-type center in a second component. According to this classification, 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline 8-monooxygenase belongs to class IB enzyme systems, as do 2-halobenzoate 1,2-dioxygenase(36Fetzner S. Mller R. Lingens F. J.

However, the oxygenase components of these three class IB enzymes are heteromultimers, whereas 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline 8-monooxygenase is a homomultimer like the class IA enzymes listed in Table 3.TABLE III Open table in a new tab 2-Oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline 8-monooxygenase also bears structural resemblance to other multicomponent non-heme iron monooxygenases like toluene 4-monooxygenase(55Whited G.M. Gibson D.T. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3010-3016Google Scholar), phenol hydroxylase(56Powlowski J. Shingler V. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6834-6840Google Scholar), or xylene monooxygenase(57Suzuki M.

Biochem. 1992; 209: 51-61Google Scholar), but the oxygenase components of these enzyme systems apparently do not possess iron-sulfur centers. Whether 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline 8-monooxygenase is a true monooxygenase or whether the monohydroxylated product is due to spontaneous dehydration of an unstable 7,8- or 8,8a-dihydrodiol of 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline, thus implying a dioxygenase reaction, is uncertain. Consequently, it remains to be determined whether 8-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline is an in vivo intermediate in the “coumarin pathway” of quinoline degradation by P. putida 86. However, no intermediate was detected during the enzyme reaction in vitro, even not under moderate conditions, taking into account the instability of a putative dihydrodiol intermediate. A 7,8-dihydrodiol was formed from the substrate analog 2-chloroquinoline by resting cells of P. putida 86(59Fetzner S. Vogler B. Lingens F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 112: 151-158Google Scholar). This activity is now shown to be independent from 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline 8-monooxygenase because the latter enzyme system did not convert 2-chloroquinoline. This paper demonstrates once more the diversity of hydroxylating enzymes encountered in quinoline-degrading bacteria. Schwarz et al.(1Schwarz G. Bauder R. Speer M. Rommel T.O. Lingens F. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1989; 370: 1183-1189Google Scholar) described two pathways of quinoline degradation. In the first step of both pathways, quinoline is converted to 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline, catalyzed by quinoline 2-oxidoreductase, which incorporates a hydroxyl group deriving from water(3Bauder R. Tshisuaka B. Lingens F. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1990; 371: 1137-1144Google Scholar, 60Peschke B. Lingens F. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1991; 372: 1081-1088Google Scholar). Whereas the quinoline 2-oxidoreductases even from distantly related bacteria exhibit far-reaching similarities(3Bauder R. Tshisuaka B. Lingens F. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1990; 371: 1137-1144Google Scholar, 60Peschke B. Lingens F. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1991; 372: 1081-1088Google Scholar, 61Hettrich D. Peschke B. Tshisuaka B. Lingens F. Biol. Chem.

Lingens, submitted for publication. the oxygenases catalyzing the next degradation step attack the same substrate (2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline) at different positions. The 5,6-dioxygenating enzyme of Comamonas testosteroni4 consequently totally differs from the enzyme system of P. putida 86, hydroxylating at C-8 (this paper). The capabilities of enzymes, performing nucleophilic as well as electrophilic regio- (and stereo-)selective hydroxylations should give a stimulus to their industrial use for biotransformations(62Holland H.L.

We also show that the different isoforms are differentially expressed in the fetal tissues. The persistence of sequences between exon 3 and 4 results in the synthesis of a 9G8 protein lacking the SR domain which is expected to be inactive in constitutive splicing.

Numerous splicing factors have been characterized in both lower (mainly the PRP factors) and higher eukaryotes. In higher eukaryotes, a unique set of factors, which belong to the family of the splicing factors (called the SR factors) rich in serine and arginine residues, is involved in the first steps of splice sites recognition. At present, seven SR factors have been identified and characterized: SF2/ASF (22Krainer A.R. Conway G.C. Kozak D. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1158-1171Google Scholar, 23Krainer A.R. Conway G.C. Kozak D.

All these factors share two common characteristics: one or two RNA binding domains (RBD) near the amino terminus and a domain rich in serine/arginine (the SR domain) at the carboxyl terminus.

It has been argued that the various SR factors are interchangeable in constitutive splicing because each is able to complement SR-deficient extracts (for instance a cytoplasmic S100 extract) (15Fu X.D. Mayeda A. Maniatis T. Krainer A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11224-11228Google Scholar; 32Mayeda A. Zahler A.M. Krainer A.R. Roth M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1301-1304Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that SF2/ASF and SC35 are able to form commitment complexes with a pre-mRNA substrate (12Fu X.-D. Nature. 1993; 365: 82-85Google Scholar) and that they are required for the stable interaction of U1 snRNP with the 5′ splice site (21Kohtz J.D. Jamison S.F. Will C.L. Zuo P. Lhrmann R. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Manley J.L. Nature. 1994; 368: 119-124Google Scholar). In agreement with these results, the region of SF2/ASF containing the two RBDs is able to recognize a typical 5′ splice site in a short transcript (21Kohtz J.D. Jamison S.F. Will C.L. Zuo P. Lhrmann R. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Manley J.L. Nature. 1994; 368: 119-124Google Scholar). An interesting aspect of SR factors is that they may modulate alternative splicing in a concentration-dependent manner when several 5′ splice sites are in competition. Increasing amounts of SF2/ASF or SC35 generally result in the preferred selection of the more proximal 5′ splice site (23Krainer A.R. Conway G.C. Kozak D. Cell. 1990; 62: 35-42Google Scholar; 16Ge H. Manley J.L. Cell. 1990; 62: 25-34Google Scholar; 15Fu X.D. Mayeda A. Maniatis T. Krainer A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11224-11228Google Scholar). However, a more extended comparison, including SRp40, SRp55, and SRp75, indicates that each SR factor has a differential ability to modulate alternative splicing in vitro (45Zahler A.M. Neugebauer K.M. Lane W.S. Roth M.B. Science. 1993; 260: 219-222Google Scholar). Moreover, as these factors are differentially expressed in different tissues, 45Zahler A.M. Neugebauer K.M. Lane W.S. Roth M.B. Science. 1993; 260: 219-222Google Scholar proposed that the SR factors may be involved in tissue-specific regulation of alternative splicing in vivo. In support of this idea, overexpression of SF2/ASF by transfection experiments led to a modulation of alternative splicing in vivo (6Caceres J.F. Stamm S. Helfman D.M. Krainer A.R. Nature. 1994; 265: 1706-1709Google Scholar). We have isolated recently the 9G8 factor with a molecular mass (~30 kDa) similar to those of SF2/ASF and SC35 (8Cavaloc Y. Popielarz M. Fuchs J.-P. Gattoni R. Stvenin J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2639-2649Google Scholar). However, its primary sequence in the RBD is only ~40% conserved relative to SF2/ASF and SC35. In addition, 9G8 presents some specific features since it contains an RRSRSXSX consensus sequence repeated six times in the SR domain and a CCHC zinc knuckle motif in its median region (8Cavaloc Y. Popielarz M. Fuchs J.-P. Gattoni R. Stvenin J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2639-2649Google Scholar). The occurrence of a large family of SR splicing factors which are differentially expressed in organisms raises questions related to the structure of their genes, the existence of a common ancestral gene, and the molecular basis of their modulated expression. In contrast with the abundant data on the SC35/PR264 gene (42Vellard M. Sureau A. Soret J. Martinerie C. Perbal B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2511-2515Google Scholar; 42Vellard M. Sureau A. Soret J. Martinerie C. Perbal B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2511-2515Google Scholar), very little is known about the genomic structure and the expression of these factors. We report here the isolation and characterization of the 9G8 gene, the determination of the exon/intron organization, a succint analysis of the promoter, and the determination of the structure of the mRNA isoforms produced by alternative splicing and polyadenylation. A 5′ 32P-labeled 38-nt probe spanning positions +153/+190 of the cDNA (QE203) or a 32P-labeled random priming cDNA PCR product using the QO60 and QN140 oligonucleotides (+682/+902) have been used to screen a human placental genomic library in λGEM 12. Duplicate plaque lifts were prepared and probed as described (37Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Three positive genomic clones containing inserts of 17 (λ9G8-I), 15 (λ9G8-II), and 17 kb (λ9G8-III) were isolated from 8.105 recombinant phages. cDNA 1 probe, a 330-bp BstBI-BglII fragment (265/595) and cDNA 2 probe, a 709-bp EcoRI-EcoRI fragment (262/971) were obtained from the 9G8 cDNA clone 3 (8Cavaloc Y. Popielarz M. Fuchs J.-P. Gattoni R. Stvenin J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2639-2649Google Scholar); 3′-untranslated region, a 383-bp NdeI-AvaII fragment (1003/1386), was obtained from the 3.2-kb SacI subclone of λ9G8-III. The probes used for the recognition of intron 3 were obtained by an amplification by PCR of a fragment of 1064 bp containing the total intron 3 and short sequences of the surrounding exons using the primers QM95 (5′-TTTGATAGACCACCTGCC-3′) and QP101 (5′-TTCGTCCCCTGCTCCTGCTGC-3′). The resulting fragment was then cleaved with RsaI and XbaI, and two DNA bands of 450 bp (IVS 3 up) and 327 bp (IVS 3 down) were gel-purified. Each probe was labeled with [32P]dCTP by random priming. For the Southern blot analysis of the recombinant phages, 2 μg of each DNA were digested with SacI or EcoR I restriction enzymes. One μg was run on 5% polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to a nylon membrane filter Hybond N+ with 0.4 M NaOH as described by the supplier. The phage DNA digested by SacI was used to subclone, by shotgun technique, the different fragments produced. For the genomic Southern analysis, 15 μg of human placental DNA digested by EcoRI and SacI were electrophoresed on 0.8% agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond N+). The blot containing the recombinant phages DNA was probed with the 38-mer QE203 oligonucleotide or the QO60/QN140 PCR product (+682/+902), labeled with 32P. The blot containing human placental DNA was probed with the 32P-labeled random priming cDNA 1 and cDNA 2 probes. The hybridization was performed at 42°C for 16 h in the hybridization solution (2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, 1 × Denhardt's solution, 30% formamide, and 10 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA), except for the QE203 probe where formamide was omitted. The filters were then washed with 0.2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 45°C (QE203 probe) or at 60°C (other probes) and subjected to an overnight autoradiography. The 5′32P labeled QM94 (5′-GCAGCGCCCAGGGCTCGAGTGAC-3′) or QO14 (5′-GTAACGCGACATGATGACAGACC-3′) were annealed overnight with aliquots of 1 μg of 293 cells poly(A)+ RNA in a solution 1 × NPES (250 mM NaCl, 40 mM Pipes, pH 6.4, 5 mM EDTA, 0.2% SDS). After precipitation and washing, the extension reaction was performed with 10 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase for 30 min at 42°C. The RNA was then degraded by 0.2 M NaOH at 42°C and the extension DNA product was electrophoresed on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 8 M urea. Artificial restriction sites HindIII and BamHI were inserted by PCR technique at positions −420 and +25, respectively. After endonuclease digestion, the PCR product was inserted in the corresponding sites of the pBLCAT3 (30Luckow B. Schtz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Google Scholar), giving the 9G8 “full-length” construct (9G8FL) (Fig. 6B). This region contains one StuI site at position −205 and a NotI site at position −38. Deletions mutants 9G8 ΔH/S and 9G8ΔS/N were obtained by releasing respectively HindIII-StuI and StuI-NotI fragments from the 9G8FL vector, blunting, and religating the vector backbone. Deletion mutant 9G8ΔS/-72 was obtained by releasing the StuI-NotI fragment from the 9G8FL vector and inserting the phosphorylated double-stranded 36-mer oligonucleotide corresponding to the +72/NotI fragment of the wild type promoter. The 9G8Δ-88/-34 mutant was generated by cutting the 9G8FL construct with SphI and digesting with Bal-31 for various times. DNA was then blunted with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase and religated. All constructs were confirmed by restriction analysis and sequencing. The pE1A, pSVCREMτ, and pSVBmyb clones that express the 293-amino acid protein of adenoviral E1A unit, CREMτ, and c-Myb, respectively, were described previously (27Leff T. Elkaim R. Goding C.R.

JEG-3 human choriocarcinoma cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and were transfected by calcium phosphate coprecipitation technique. Cells were plated at a density of 106 cells/10-cm plate and transfected with 10 μg of total plasmid DNA. 3 μg of reporter plasmid was included in each transfection sample together with 1 μg of pSVCREMτ, pE1A, or pSVBmyb expression plasmids. CAT activity was assayed as described previously (38Sassone-Corsi P. Lamph W.W. Kamps M. Verma I.M. Cell. 1988; 54: 553-560Google Scholar) and was quantified by PhosphorImager counting. The activity values correspond to the percentage of chloramphenicol modified by the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. The human fetal multiple tissue Northern blot, containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from each tissue was obtained from Clontech (catalog number 7761-1). The membrane was prehybridized and hybridized in pre/hybridization solution (5 × SSC, 10 × Denhardt's solution, 45% formamide, 1.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA) at 42°C. After a 20-h hybridization with radiolabeled probe (2 × 106 cpm/ml), the blot was washed 30 min at 55°C in 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS and exposed 16 h with Kodak X-Omat film or was quantified by PhosphorImager counting. We previously cloned a cDNA encoding the 9G8 SR factor (8Cavaloc Y. Popielarz M. Fuchs J.-P. Gattoni R. Stvenin J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2639-2649Google Scholar). To isolate the corresponding genomic clone, a 38-nt oligonucleotide probe encompassing an amino acid sequence of the RBD not present in the other SR factors was used to screen a placental human genomic library in λGEM12. We obtained two genomic clones λ9G8-I and −II containing inserts of 17 and 15 kb, respectively (see also 8Cavaloc Y. Popielarz M. Fuchs J.-P. Gattoni R. Stvenin J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2639-2649Google Scholar). However, preliminary analysis indicated that they do not cover the entire open reading frame of the 9G8 mRNA. Therefore, a 211-bp PCR product, from positions 692 to 902 of the 9G8 mRNA, covering the C-terminal region of the 9G8 factor, allowed the isolation of another 17-kb clone (λ9G8-III). Analysis of the three clones by restriction endonuclease mapping and Southern blotting using the specific probes mentioned above revealed that the inserts overlap and together cover the entire open reading frame of the 9G8 gene (Fig. 1). The 5.5-kb SacI fragment at the 3′ terminus of the clone I insert, as well as the 2.6-kb internal fragment and 3.2-kb fragment at the 3′ terminus of the clone III insert were subcloned into pBluescript SK+ and used for further characterization and sequencing analysis. Complete exon-intron organization of the 9G8 gene was determined by sequencing the totality of the gene. Using the previously cloned 9G8 cDNA sequence as the reference mRNA sequence, we have determined that the 9G8 gene is 7745 nucleotides long and contains 8 exons and 7 introns (Table 1). The exons range from 36 (exon 7) to 1572 bp (last exon), and the intron sizes vary from 308 to 1298 bp (Table 1). From the sizes of exons and introns as well as the splice site sequences which fulfill the GT-AG rule (4Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Google Scholar), we deduced that the 9G8 gene exhibits features typical of many eukaryotic genes. The translated sequence of 9G8 is highly cut up as the open reading frame is distributed over the 8 exons. Interestingly, the RBD is contained in exon 2, and the exon 3 encodes for the zinc knuckle motif (8Cavaloc Y. Popielarz M. Fuchs J.-P. Gattoni R. Stvenin J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2639-2649Google Scholar). In contrast, the SR domain which is 110 amino acids in size covers exons 4-8. A study of the DNA sequence downstream the stop codon reveals two polyadenylation signals at 610 and 1511 bp downstream of the stop codon.TABLE I Open table in a new tab Southern blot analysis of human genomic DNA digested by EcoR I or SacI was performed using the two cDNA probes cDNA 1 (positions 265/595) covering exons 2 and 3 and cDNA 2 (positions 262/971) covering exon 2 to exon 8 (Fig. 2). The short cDNA probe revealed a single band after digestion with either EcoRI (2.7 kb) or SacI (7.5 kb), in agreement with what was expected from structure of genomic clones (Fig. 1). In contrast, the extended probe (cDNA 2) detected an additional fragment in the EcoRI (~8 kb) and SacI (2.5 kb) restriction digests (Fig. 2), consistent with the structure of the λ9G8-III clone shown in Fig. 1. Thus, these results confirm the structural organization of the 9G8 gene. They indicate also that 9G8 is encoded by a single copy gene and that no pseudogenes are present in the genome. The chromosomal location of the 9G8 gene was determined by in situ hybridization using the cDNA 2 probe. Analysis of 100 metaphase cells revealed a total of 237 silver grains on chromosomes, and 51 of these (21.5%) were located on chromosome 2. Analysis of the grain distribution indicated that 36 out of 51 (70.6%) of these mapped to the p22-21 region on the short arm of chromosome 2, with an intense localization in the p21 band (Fig. 3). This result allows to unequivocally assign the 9G8 gene to the p22-21 region of human chromosome 2.Figure 3:Idiogram of distribution of signals on chromosome 2. In situ hybridization of human metaphase chromosomal spreads were performed as described (31Mattei M.G. Bruce B. Karsenty G. Genomics. 1993; 16: 786-788Google Scholar). 70.6% of grains located on chromosome 2 mapped to the p22-21 region of short arm, with a maximum in the p21 band.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine the transcription initiation site, we performed a primer extension analysis (Fig. 4). Primer extension on poly(A)+ RNA isolated from 293 cells, using two 23-mer oligonucleotides QM94 (upstream the AUG codon) and QO14 (encompassing the AUG codon) resulted in the synthesis of cDNAs of 72-70 residues (Fig. 4) or 117-115 residues (not shown), respectively. Comparing the extension products with a sequence ladder generated by extending the same primers from a plasmid containing incomplete 9G8 cDNA localized the initiation site at a G residue, downstream from the CT-rich sequence CTCTTCCTC/G + 1. It is not known if the cDNA beginning 2 residues downstream of the longer cDNA (Fig. 4) corresponds to a true initiation site at an A residue or to a premature stop of the primer extension. Analysis of the sequence of the 5′-flanking region of the 9G8 gene contained in the 5.5-kb SacI subfragment reveals a high GC content (57%) and several promoter elements (Fig. 5). A TATA motif (TATATAA) is present at position −29, and three potential SP1 binding sites (GGCGGG) are found at positions −87, −148, and −224. Computer search reveals also putative regulatory elements (Locker and Buzard, 1990; Faisst and Meyer, 1992). Two sequence motifs for liver-specific factors A1 (LFA1), TGAACC and TGACCC, are present at positions −149 and −345, and one possible AP-2 motif (GCCTGGg), which deverges from the AP-2 consensus by one nucleotide, is located at position −298. In addition, an ATGACGcA sequence, which exhibits a good match with the consensus ATF site is present at position −59 and overlaps a TGACGcat sequence, with a significant homology to the CRE motif. Sequences identical to the core consensus for Ets (GGAAPu) are also present at positions −266, −261, −208, and −115. Finally, minimal consensus sites for Myb (AACNG) are located at positions −96, −121, −239, and −375. To characterize the upstream region of the 9G8 gene, a DNA fragment spanning from −414 to +26 (clone 9G8FL), as well as fragments containing various deletions, were fused to the bacterial CAT reporter gene in the pBLCAT3 plasmid (Fig. 6A). These constructs were transiently expressed into JEG-3 cells, which express 9G8 mRNA at levels similar to those of HeLa cells and cellular extracts were assayed for CAT activity 36 h after transfection. In Fig. 6B, we show that the upstream region was able to induce significant CAT activity. However, a deletion of the −202 to −36 region (clone 9G8ΔS/N), which leaves the TATA motif intact, results in an 8-fold reduction of the CAT activity (compare the first and the fifth bars). A similar reduction was observed with the almost complete deletion of the 9G8 upstream region from −414 to −36 (not shown). Moreover, two smaller deletions −202/-72 (clone 9G8ΔS/-72) and −88/-34 (clone 9G8Δ-88/-34), which cover the −202 to −36 deletion (Fig. 6A), resulted in both cases in a ~2.5-fold reduction compared with the wild type construct. In contrast, deletion of the region −414 to −203 (clone 9G8ΔH/S) induced a 2-fold stimulation of the promoter activity (compare the first and the second bars), indicating that the most upstream sequences do not contain strong positive acting elements and that some negative elements may be present. Thus, this deletional analysis shows that the upstream region of the 9G8 gene is effective in activating a CAT reporter gene and that the positive acting elements are mainly concentrated all along the −202 to −34 region, immediately upstream of the TATA box. The presence of many putative regulatory elements served as a guide for testing, in a preliminary manner, several trans-acting factors. The effect of CREMτ+PKA, Myb, and E1A factors, which are known to activate many cellular genes, were analyzed by cotransfection experiments. We found that each factor stimulates the transcription around three fold (not shown), suggesting that the 9G8 promoter is able to respond to different trans-acting factors. Northern blot analysis of human fetal poly(A)+ RNA isolated from the brain, liver, kidney, and lung (Clontech) was carried out using a 330-nt cDNA probe, covering exons 2 and 3 of the 9G8 RNA (cDNA 1). We detect five mRNAs of approximately 1.3, 2.0, 2.4, 2.6, and 3.8 kb in size, respectively, the 2.4- and 2.6-kb being very close (Fig. 7, lanes 1-4). We observed that the same five transcripts are present in adult poly(A)+ RNAs (Multiple Tissue Northern blot 1, Clontech), suggesting that none of the isoforms is specific for a developmental stage (not shown). To further analyze the different isoforms, the blot was hybridized with DNA probes specific for (i) the 3′-noncoding region between the two potential poly(A) signals (3′ UTR; Fig. 7, lanes 5-8). We have used this probe because the distance observed between the two potential polyadenylation signals (~1 kb) could account for different sizes of mRNA observed. (ii) The intron 3, since further characterization of the cDNA clones for 9G8 isolated previously (8Cavaloc Y. Popielarz M. Fuchs J.-P. Gattoni R. Stvenin J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2639-2649Google Scholar) indicated that two out of nine cDNA clones contained this intron (not shown). We observed that the 3.8- and 2.6-kb mRNA species use the distal poly(A) signal (Fig. 7, second panel), and that only the 3.8-, 2.4-, and 2.0-kb species contain intron 3 sequences (not shown). Nevertheless, the 2.0-kb species is too short to contain the entire intron 3. Looking for consensus signals within this intron, we have found one potential 3′ splice site in its middle. By using DNA probes specific for the sequences downstream (Fig. 7, lanes 9-12) and upstream (Fig. 7, lanes 13-16) of this splice site, we show that the 2.0-kb mRNA is generated by the use of this alternative 3′ splice site and that the 3.8- and 2.4-kb mRNA contain the totality of intron 3 sequences. The putative structure of all the mRNA isoforms is given in Fig. 7. A quantitative analysis of the relative abundance of the different species in various fetal tissues indicates that the 1.3-kb species, which encodes the whole 9G8 factor, is highly predominant in the liver, but it appears as a minor isoform in the kidney. In contrast, the 2.4-kb isoform, which contains the entire intron 3, is the predominant species in kidney. A quantitative estimation of the 9G8 mRNA isoforms indicates that the relative ratio of the intron 3 minus transcripts (1.3- and 2.6-kb species) to the intron 3 plus transcripts (2.0-, 2.4-, and 3.8-kb species) varies from about 1 to 5 between the kidney and the liver, respectively. The 9G8 gene is divided into eight exons and seven introns, and the coding sequence is highly divided, since it starts in exon 1 and stops in exon 8. Thus, its exon/intron organization is very different from those of the two other SR factors SC35/PR264 (39Sureau A. Perbal B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 932-936Google Scholar) or RBP1 (20Kim Y.-J. Zuo P. Manley J.L. Baker B.S. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2569-2579Google Scholar), since in these genes, the coding sequence is contained only in two exons. Previous comparison of amino acid sequences of RBD has shown that 9G8 presents a good homology with SRp20 and RBP1 (8Cavaloc Y. Popielarz M. Fuchs J.-P. Gattoni R. Stvenin J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2639-2649Google Scholar), suggesting that several SR factors may originate from a common ancestral gene, as already proposed (2Birney A. Sanjay K. Krainer A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5803-5816Google Scholar). However, the very different organization of 9G8 and RBP1 genes indicates that profound modifications have occurred after ancient gene duplication. It has been proposed that the intron sequences frequently demarcate important functional or structural domains of proteins. We observe indeed that the RNA binding domain of the 9G8 factor covers precisely exon 2 sequences, whereas the middle region containing the specific CCHC zinc knuckle is located in the third exon. Finally, the SR domain of 9G8 is distributed in the exons 4-8, but a specific region of this domain, not found in the other SR factors, is encoded precisely in exon 5. This region contains four conserved repetitions of the consensus RRSRSXSX (8Cavaloc Y. Popielarz M. Fuchs J.-P. Gattoni R. Stvenin J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2639-2649Google Scholar) and might originate from intragenic recombination occurred during evolution. We have shown that the 9G8 gene is located in human on the chromosome 2p22-21. This region is the site of several known genes, including T cell leukemia virus enhancer factor (HTLF) (28Li C. Lusis A.J. Sparkes R. Tran S.-M. Gaynor R. Genomics. 1992; 13: 658-664Google Scholar), and translocations of chromosome 2p22-16 with chromosome 11p23 have been reported in human leukemia (3Bloomfield C.D. de la Chappelle A. Semin. Oncol. 1987; 14: 372-383Google Scholar). Examination of the 400-bp region upstream of the 9G8 gene shows several interesting features. The G + C content of 57% and the CpG content of 7% are indicators that the promoter region of the 9G8 gene is in a CpG island (25Larsen F. Gundersen G. Lopez R. Prydz H. Genomics. 1992; 13: 1095-1107Google Scholar). However, the presence of a TATA box and many potential regulatory elements does not allow us to classify this gene as a typical housekeeping gene (Locker and Buzard, 1990; Faisst and Meyer, 1992). The promoter of the 9G8 gene has been shown to be functional in JEG-3 cells and to respond to several trans-acting factors. In this respect, the 9G8 promoter resembles the SC35/PR264 gene which contains several Myb-responsive elements (42Vellard M. Sureau A. Soret J. Martinerie C. Perbal B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2511-2515Google Scholar). In fact, 9G8 expression, similar to that of the other SR factors, is likely ubiquitous, but it has been shown that the SR factors recognized by mAb104 (SRp20, SRp30, SRp40, SRp55, and SRp75) are expressed at different levels in various calf tissues (45Zahler A.M. Neugebauer K.M. Lane W.S. Roth M.B. Science. 1993; 260: 219-222Google Scholar). We show in this paper that the expression of the 9G8 mRNA is the target of different regulations such as alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation, leading to five well detectable species from 1.3 to 3.8 kb. One interesting feature is the retention of the entire or a part of the intron 3, because it leads to the translation of a truncated form of the 9G8 protein devoid of the SR domain by introducing a stop codon downstream of the exon 3/intron 3 junction (Fig. 8). In fact, although there are no important variations in the total amounts of 9G8 transcripts within the tested fetal tissues (Fig. 7), some important changes within the distribution of each species occur. The existence of the alternative splicing of intron 3, most likely due to the existence of a suboptimal 3′ splice site at the end of this intron (see the sequence in Fig. 8) seems puzzling if it is thought that maximal levels of SR factors are required for an efficient splicing machinery. However, we have to take into account that levels of SR factors are variable (45Zahler A.M. Neugebauer K.M. Lane W.S. Roth M.B. Science. 1993; 260: 219-222Google Scholar) and may participate to the modulation of alternative splicing, as proposed by these authors. Moreover, our data raise the interesting possibility that the splicing of intron 3 might be submitted to regulation, because its 3′ splice site is similar to other weak 3′ splice sites, such as the female-specific 3′ splice site of double-sex pre-mRNA (35Ryner L.C. Baker B.S. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 2071-2085Google Scholar; 19Hedley M.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1991; 65: 579-586Google Scholar) or the fibronectin ED1 exon (7Caputi M. Casari M. Guenzi S. Tagliabue R. Sidoli A. Melo C.A. Baralle F.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1018-1022Google Scholar). In this respect, purine-rich motifs of the form CAGGAGGAA, CAGCAGGAG, and CAGGGACGAAG, located downstream within the exon 4 of this gene, resemble cis-acting motifs found in the M2 exon of IgM gene (41Tanaka K. Watakabe A. Shimura Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1347-1354Google Scholar), troponin (43Xu R. Teng J. Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3660-3674Google Scholar), fibronectin (26Lavigueur A. La Branche H. Kornblihtt A.R. Chabot B. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2405-2417Google Scholar; 7Caputi M. Casari M. Guenzi S. Tagliabue R. Sidoli A. Melo C.A. Baralle F.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1018-1022Google Scholar), or bovine growth hormon gene (9Dirksen W.P. Hampson R.K. Sun Q. Rottman F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6431-6436Google Scholar). They may be important for the excision of the whole intron 3. In fact, a mRNA variant containing a retained intron had also been previously described for the ASF/SF2 protein (17Ge H. Zuo P. Manley J.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 373-382Google Scholar), but the amount of this species was small (<5%). Interestingly, the ΔSR splice variant of ASF/SF2 conserves all its ability to modulate the alternative splicing, but loses its characteristics of constitutive splicing factor (47Zuo P. Manley J.L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4727-4737Google Scholar; 5Caceres J.F. Krainer A.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4715-4726Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is still unknown whether this type of truncated SR factors is involved in the regulation of alternative splicing pathways in vivo. We also show that the 9G8 pre-mRNA is alternatively processed in its 3′-untranslated region. Looking at polyadenylation signals within the genomic primary sequence, we find one ATTAAA motif at position 1433 and one AATAAA motif at position 2334 that are used in vivo. It had been observed that SC35/PR264 pre-mRNA was submitted to an alternative polyadenylation coupled to alternative splicing within its 3′-untranslated region (39Sureau A. Perbal B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 932-936Google Scholar). Differences in the stability of the SC35/PR264 mRNA species have been demonstrated in agreement with studies showing that sequences contained in the 3′-untranslated region are involved in the stability of the mRNA or in the control of translation (36Sachs A.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 413-421Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have identified splice variants of the 9G8 transcript that may allow the synthesis of significant and variable amounts of 9G8 SR factor deleted of the SR domain. It will be interesting to determine whether the differential expression of the 9G8 factor may be involved in the modulation of alternative splicing in vivo. We are grateful to Dr. I.

To ascertain the underlying defect responsible for TTD, we have expressed the TTD mutant proteins in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and determined if these mutations can rescue the inviability of a rad3 null mutation.

Expression of the wild type XPD protein or the XPD Arg-48 protein carrying a mutation in the DNA helicase domain restores viability to the rad3 null mutation. Interestingly, the XPD variants containing TTD mutations fail to complement the lethality of the rad3 null mutation, strongly suggesting that TTD mutations impair the ability of XPD protein to function normally in RNA polymerase II transcription.

https://openalex.org/W1555795064,"The recombinant porcine m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (rPm2R) from Chinese hamster ovary cells has been purified to homogeneity. Two mg of purified rPm2R, with a specific activity of 12 nmol of R-(-)-quinuclidinyl benzilate/mg of protein, were obtained from 30 ml of packed Chinese hamster ovary cells. The apparent molecular mass (78.5 kDa) and specific activity for the rPm2R preparation were the same as that for the Pm2R purified from atrial tissue, but the yield was 100 times greater. Purified rPm2R bound agonist and antagonist with the same affinities and coupled to the inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding protein with the same efficiency as the purified native atrial Pm2R. Ligand binding studies were consistent with a single class of antagonist binding sites but two subclasses of agonist binding sites. The fraction of rPm2R having high affinity for agonists was increased by mM Mg2+, low detergent concentration, and low temperature. Circular dichroism spectra obtained for the purified rPm2R with and without agonists were indistinguishable, but spectra for the antagonist-occupied receptor showed reproducibly deeper characteristic negative deflections at 208 and 220 nm. Secondary structure analysis of the CD spectra predicted 53% alpha-helix for the free receptor and 49% alpha-helix for the R-(-)-quinuclidinyl benzilate-receptor complex."

Thermococcus TBP can replace archaeal transcription factor B (aTFB) in cell-free transcription reactions. This transcriptional activation is TATA box-dependent and occurs both on tRNAVal and protein-encoding genes as templates indicating that Thermococcus TBP is a general transcription factor. Antibodies raised against Thermococcus TBP bind to Methanococcus aTFB and inhibit aTFB activity.

The genomes of hyperthermophilic Archaea Pyrococcus woesei and Thermococcus celer include sequences that would encode proteins similar to eucaryal transcription factor IIB (1Ouzounis C. Sander C.

Genes of archaeal TBPs encode two repeated domains that show 42-38% identity to the sequence repeats of human TBP, respectively(4Marsh T.L. Reich C.I. Whitelock R.B. Olsen G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5788-5791Google Scholar). The protein translation of the gene encoding Pyrococcus TBP was shown to bind to the TATA box of a putative homologous promoter and seems also to be expressed in Pyrococcus cells(3Rowlands T. Baumann P. Jackson S.P. Science. 1994; 264: 1326-1329Google Scholar), suggesting homology of eucaryal and archaeal TBPs. However, an actual function of the gene products of TBPs from hyperthermophiles in transcription has not been demonstrated as a Pyrococcus transcription system has not yet been described. We have shown recently that yeast and human TBP can functionally replace archaeal transcription factor B in a Methanococcus thermolithotrophicus cell-free transcription system(5Wettach J. Gohl H.P. Tschochner H. Thomm M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 472-476Google Scholar). M. thermolithotrophicus is a moderate thermophile that can grow still at temperatures close to the lower temperature range of growth of Thermococcus(6Huber H. Thomm M. Knig H. Thies G. Stetter K.O. Arch. Microbiol. 1982; 132: 47-50Google Scholar). Hence, a cell-free system derived from this organism may prove useful to investigate also the function of transcription factors from hyperthermophiles. We show here that recombinant Thermococcus TBP substitutes for Methanococcus aTFB in transcription reactions and provide immunochemical evidence for a structural relationship between these proteins. Our data imply a similar function for aTFB, Thermococcus TBP, and eucaryal TBPs. TATA-binding protein archaeal transcription factor B archaeal transcription factor A. The standard template used was plasmid pIC31/2 containing the tRNAVal gene of Methanococcus vannielii. pIC31/44 is a single-point mutant of this template containing a T → G transversion at position −26. pIC31/61 contains a substitution of internal sequences of tRNAVal from position 5 to 88 by Escherichia coli DNA(5Wettach J. Gohl H.P. Tschochner H. Thomm M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 472-476Google Scholar, 7Hausner W. Frey G. Thomm M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 495-508Google Scholar). Plasmid pKS304Δ16 harbors the promoter region of the gene encoding the histone hmf1 from Methanothermus fervidus that shows a tandem repeat of the TATA box(8Thomm M. Sandman K. Frey G. Koller G. Reeve J.N. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 174: 3508-3513Google Scholar). Linearized templates for analyses of run-off transcripts were prepared as described previously(5Wettach J. Gohl H.P. Tschochner H. Thomm M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 472-476Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was purified by repeated centrifugation in CsCl density gradients as described previously(9Frey G. Thomm M. Brdigam B. Gohl H.P. Hausner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1361-1367Google Scholar). RNA polymerase and aTFB were purified as described previously(10Hausner W. Thomm M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24047-24052Google Scholar). aTFA was isolated by phosphocellulose chromatography (9Frey G. Thomm M. Brdigam B. Gohl H.P. Hausner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1361-1367Google Scholar). Residual processing activity was eliminated by heating the aTFA fraction for 15 min at 95°C and subsequent removal of precipitated material by centrifugation. aTFA activity is heat-stable and remains in the supernatant. A DNA fragment encoding the gene of Thermococcus TBP was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the oligonucleotides 5′-CGTCTTAC(CATATG)AGCAATGTAAAGCTCAG-3′ and 5′-GTCATTC(GAATTC)ACCACTCCTCTTCTTCCCC-3′. The DNA fragment was hydrolyzed with NdeI and EcoRI (restriction sites of the oligonucleotides are in parentheses) and ligated between the NdeI and EcoRI sites of the expression vector pET14b (Novagen, Madison, WI). The resulting plasmid pTBPTc.14 contained the coding region of the TBP from Thermococcus and a His-tag at the N terminus of the protein under the control of an inducible T7 promoter(11Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Google Scholar). The construct was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). The expression of the protein was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (final concentration, 1 mM) to a growing culture (OD = 0.7). The recombinant protein was purified using affinity chromatography on immobilized Ni2+ columns according to the instructions of Novagen. Thermococcus TBP fractions were pooled for further purification, diluted with 3 volumes of TN50 buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl, 50 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 8.0), and applied to a Mono Q column (HR 5/5, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient (15 ml/50-1000 mM NaCl). Fractions that were able to replace aTFB activity in a Methanococcus cell-free transcription system were pooled and further purified by chromatography on a Superdex 200 column (HR 16/60, Pharmacia) equilibrated with TN300 buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl, 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 8.0). 100-μl transcription reactions were performed as described previously(9Frey G. Thomm M. Brdigam B. Gohl H.P. Hausner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1361-1367Google Scholar). Reactions contained 10 μl of the phosphocellulose fraction of aTFA, 5 μl of Superdex fraction of RNA polymerase (5 units; (10Hausner W. Thomm M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24047-24052Google Scholar)), and 10 μl of Superdex fraction of aTFB (1.5 units; (10Hausner W. Thomm M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24047-24052Google Scholar)). In experiments investigating the effect of anti-Thermococcus TBP IgG on transcription, aTFB was preincubated in a total volume of 50 μl with various quantities of anti-Thermococcus TBP or preimmune IgG fractions for 30 min at room temperature, and the reaction was completed by the addition of aTFA, RNA polymerase, and ribonucleoside triphosphates. Purified protein (500 μg) was used for immunization of a rabbit. Immunization was performed by Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium) following the standard immunization protocol. The anti-Thermococcus TBP and the preimmune IgG fractions (each 2.5 mg/ml) were isolated from the serum by affinity chromatography on protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia). Various protein fractions of Methanococcus were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (BA-S 85, Schleicher & Schuell) by semi-dry blotting. The membrane was incubated for at least 1 h or overnight in TBST buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.5) containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk (Gluecksklee, Nestle Frankfurt). After blocking, the membrane was incubated with either preimmune or anti-Thermococcus TBP IgG for 1 h. IgG was diluted 1:333 in TBST buffer. Unbound antibodies were removed by washing three times with TBST buffer for 10 min. After this step, the membrane was incubated with a 1:2000 dilution of peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (from sheep) for 1 h. The membrane was washed then with TBST buffer three times for 15 min. Chemiluminescence detection was performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Boehringer Mannheim). To address the question whether the putative homolog of TBP in Thermococcus genome shows transcription factor activity in vitro, this gene was overexpressed in E. coli, and the function of the recombinant polypeptide was investigated in a Methanococcus cell-free system. In Methanococcus, two transcription factors, aTFA and aTFB, and RNA polymerase are required for specific cell-free transcription from a tRNAVal promoter (7Hausner W. Frey G. Thomm M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 495-508Google Scholar, 12Thomm M. Hausner W. Hethke C. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1994; 16: 648-655Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, lanes 1-8). When aTFA was replaced by Thermococcus TBP, the system was incapable of synthesizing a specific RNA product (Fig. 1, lane 9). However, substitution of aTFB by Thermococcus TBP resulted in synthesis of pre-tRNAVal (Fig. 1, lane 10). Increasing the amount of Thermococcus TBP in the transcription reactions led to increased synthesis of specific RNA products (Fig. 1, lanes 10 and 11). This finding demonstrates that Thermococcus TBP shows transcription factor activity and suggests homology of Methanococcus aTFB and Thermococcus TBP. To investigate whether transcription activation mediated by Thermococcus TBP is brought about by the TATA box, template activities of several archaeal promoters harboring a TATA box were assayed together with promoter mutants of a tRNAVal gene in the Methanococcus/Thermococcus hybrid transcription system. Analysis of run-off transcripts from a template containing a promoter-down single-point mutation of the TATA box (pIC31/44; Fig. 2) revealed that the latter was essential for aTFB (7Hausner W. Frey G. Thomm M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 495-508Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, lane 3) and Thermococcus TBP (Fig. 2, lane 4) mediated initiation of transcription. As expected, deletion of internal sequences of tRNAVal (pIC31/61) did not affect expression by the Methanococcus cell-free system (7Hausner W. Frey G. Thomm M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 495-508Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, lane 5) and the Methanococcus/Thermococcus hybrid system (Fig. 2, lane 6). RNA products were also synthesized by both systems with high activity from the promoter of histone hmf1 (plasmid pKS304Δ16) from M. fervidus containing two tandem TATA boxes (Fig. 2, lanes 7 and 8) and from the promoter of nifH1 gene from M. thermolithotrophicus encoding an archaeal nitrogenase (data not shown). These findings indicate that Thermococcus TBP recognizes promoters of archaeal protein-encoding genes. Thermococcus TBP produced in E. coli showed an apparent molecular mass of 23.5 kDa (Fig. 3A) when analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis. A polyclonal antibody raised against this polypeptide was probed with protein immunoblots of the three transcriptional components of the Methanococcus cell-free system. Both aTFA fraction and RNA polymerase showed no serological cross-reaction (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 2). However, in the aTFB fraction, a single band corresponding to a molecular mass of 28 kDa bound antibodies (Fig. 3B, lane 3). The molecular mass of this cross-reacting polypeptide is identical to the molecular mass of aTFB determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis(10Hausner W. Thomm M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24047-24052Google Scholar). This finding demonstrates that Thermococcus TBP and aTFB are structurally related. To provide further evidence for a functional similarity between Thermococcus TBP and aTFB, the effect of the antiserum directed against Thermococcus TBP on cell-free transcription by the Methanococcus system was studied. When increasing amounts of purified IgG were added in preincubation reactions to aTFB fraction, specific transcription was inhibited, which depended on the amount of antibodies added to the reactions (Fig. 4, lanes 2-5). Preincubation with IgG purified from preimmune serum led to a weak, presumably nonspecific inhibition of transcription, in particular at high concentrations (Fig. 4, lanes 6-9; compare with control in lane 1). However, this inhibition was clearly less than that observed in the presence of specific antibodies (Fig. 4, lanes 6 −9, compare with lanes 2-5). This finding unequivocally demonstrates that the activity in Methanococcus aTFB fraction and that of Thermococcus TBP are identical. We describe here the interaction of recombinant Thermococcus TBP with Methanococcus transcriptional machinery. The findings presented provide evidence that the gene that exhibits sequence similarity to eucaryal TBP, which was detected recently in the genome of Thermococcus, encodes an archaeal transcription factor that has a function similar to that of aTFB. First, Thermococcus TBP can substitute for aTFB in a Methanococcus-derived cell-free system (Fig. 1). Second, activation of transcription brought about by this polypeptide requires a TATA box (Fig. 2, lane 4). TATA boxes are essential elements of archaeal promoters(7Hausner W. Frey G. Thomm M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 495-508Google Scholar, 13Reiter W.D. Hdepohl U. Zillig W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9509-9513Google Scholar), and recently the TATA box has been identified as the binding site for aTFB.2 2H. P. Gohl, B. Grndahl, and M. Thomm, manuscript in preparation. Third, TATA boxes of protein-encoding archaeal genes are recognized by Thermococcus TBP (Fig. 2, lane 8) indicating that it acts (like aTFB(10Hausner W. Thomm M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24047-24052Google Scholar)) as a general transcription factor. Finally, antibodies raised against Thermococcus TBP bind to aTFB in Western blots (Fig. 3B) and inhibit aTFB-dependent transcription in the Methanococcus cell-free transcription system (Fig. 4). Our finding that the functions of aTFB and Thermococcus TBP are very similar indicates a high degree of conservation of the protein between these two Euryarchaeota(15Woese C.R. Kandler O. Wheelis M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4576-4579Google Scholar) although the genera Methanococcus and Thermococcus show considerable phylogenetic divergence (16Olsen G. Woese C.R. Overbeek R. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1-6Google Scholar) and the two species M. thermolithotrophicus and Thermococcus celer a different optimum growth temperature(6Huber H. Thomm M. Knig H. Thies G. Stetter K.O. Arch. Microbiol. 1982; 132: 47-50Google Scholar, 17Stetter K.O. Fiala G. Huber G. Huber R. Segerer A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 75: 117-124Google Scholar). The observation that a Thermococcus transcription factor is able to direct specific transcription by Methanococcus RNA polymerase is in line with our recent finding that yeast and human TBP can substitute for aTFB in the Methanococcus cell-free system(5Wettach J. Gohl H.P. Tschochner H. Thomm M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 472-476Google Scholar). Hence, Methanococcus transcriptional machinery appears extremely conserved and highly suitable to detect similarities of transcriptional components originating from evolutionary unrelated organisms at the functional level. The translation products of open reading frames encoding putative TBPs from hyperthermophilic Archaea (3Rowlands T. Baumann P. Jackson S.P. Science. 1994; 264: 1326-1329Google Scholar, 4Marsh T.L. Reich C.I. Whitelock R.B. Olsen G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5788-5791Google Scholar) give a molecular mass of 21,000 daltons and do not show the N-terminal extension encountered in eucaryal TBPs(14Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 161-190Google Scholar). The molecular mass of Methanococcus aTFB determined by electrophoresis under denaturing conditions was 28,000 daltons(10Hausner W. Thomm M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24047-24052Google Scholar), and this polypeptide showed serological cross-reaction with anti-Thermococcus TBP antibodies (Fig. 3B). Hence, aTFB most likely contains the N-terminal extension missing in TBPs from hyperthermophiles. The serological cross-reaction between Methanococcus aTFB and Thermococcus TBP indicates a close relationship of these polypeptides also at the structural level. The demonstration of similar function and structure of a Thermococcus and Methanococcus transcription factor provided here clearly indicates homology of these polypeptides. We therefore suggest that one designates aTFB as Methanococcus TBP. Our finding that Thermococcus TBP shows an activity directing specific transcription from archaeal TATA boxes strongly supports the conclusion that the genomes of Archaea encode transcription factors closely related to eucaryal TBPs and provides biochemical evidence for the hypothesis that archaeal and eucaryal transcriptional machineries are basically homologous(3Rowlands T. Baumann P. Jackson S.P. Science. 1994; 264: 1326-1329Google Scholar, 4Marsh T.L. Reich C.I. Whitelock R.B. Olsen G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5788-5791Google Scholar, 5Wettach J. Gohl H.P. Tschochner H. Thomm M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 472-476Google Scholar). We would like to thank Dr. Roger Garrett (Institute of Molecular Biology, Copenhagen) for comments on the manuscript, Drs. Terrance Marsh, Claudia Reich, and Gary Olsen (Department of Microbiology, University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign) for providing the gene encoding Thermococcus TBP before publication, Dr. Carl Woese (Department of Microbiology, University at Urbana Champaign) for stimulating discussions, and Jutta Kock for technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W1545239702,"In mammalian cells, α-1,2-mannosidases play an essential role in the early steps of N-linked oligosaccharide maturation. We previously reported (Herscovics, A., Schneikert, J., Athanassiadis, A., and Moremen, K. W.(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 9864-9871) the isolation of mouse α-mannosidase IB cDNA clones from a Balb/c 3T3 cDNA library. Clone 4 encodes a type II membrane protein of 641 amino acids with a cytoplasmic tail of 35 amino acids, followed by a transmembrane domain and a large C-terminal catalytic domain, whereas clone 16 encodes only the last 471 amino acids. Their overlapping sequences (from amino acid 152) are identical, except for three point mutations that result in three amino acid differences in the catalytic domain of the enzyme (Thr411, Leu468, and Ser592 in clone 4 to Met411, Phe468, and Phe592 in clone 16, respectively). Both sequences could be amplified by polymerase chain reaction using templates of cDNAs derived from colon and brain of CD1 mice and from L cells derived from the C3H/An mouse, indicating that both are natural isoforms found in two inbred and one outbred mouse strains. When expressed in COS7 cells as a secreted protein A fusion protein, the catalytic domain of clone 16 displays α-1,2-mannosidase activity using [3H]mannose-labeled Man9GlcNAc as substrate, but the corresponding region of clone 4 is poorly secreted under identical conditions. The contribution of each point mutation to this differential secretion and enzyme activity of the two fusion proteins was assessed by testing the six recombinants corresponding to all the possible sequence permutations. Mutation of Phe592 to Ser592, as found in clone 4, is sufficient to abolish α-1,2-mannosidase activity, whereas mutation of Met411 to Thr411 or of Phe468 to Leu468 affects secretion with relatively little effect on enzyme activity. Phe592 is part of a highly conserved region that seems important for enzyme activity of class 1 α-1,2-mannosidases."
https://openalex.org/W1486509619,"Early studies suggested that the Escherichia coli tryptophan synthase α-subunit unfolded in a two-step process in which there was a stable intermediate composed of a native α-1 folding unit (residues 1-188) and a completely unfolded α-2 folding unit (residues 189-268). More recent evidence has indicated that such a structure for the intermediate seems unlikely. In this report, single Trp residues (absent in the wild-type α-subunit) are substituted separately for Phe residues at positions 139 (in α-1) and 258 (in α-2) to produce the F139W, F258W, and F139W/F258W mutant α-subunits. The UV absorbance and fluorescence properties of the F139W/F258W double mutant are identical with those of equimolar mixtures of the single mutants, suggesting that the Trp residue at each position can independently report the behavior of its respective folding unit. Each mutant α-subunit is wild-type enzymatically, and when UV absorbance is monitored, the urea-induced unfolding of the three tryptophan-containing α-subunits is virtually identical to the wild-type protein. These wild-type properties make these proteins attractive candidates for a fluorescence examination of the behavior of the individual folding units and the structure of potential intermediate(s) and as host proteins for the insertion of our existing destabilizing and/or stabilizing mutational alterations. Early studies suggested that the Escherichia coli tryptophan synthase α-subunit unfolded in a two-step process in which there was a stable intermediate composed of a native α-1 folding unit (residues 1-188) and a completely unfolded α-2 folding unit (residues 189-268).

The α-subunit of the Escherichia coli and/or Salmonella typhimurium tryptophan synthase has long been used as a model to explore the stability and unfolding and folding properties of proteins and polypeptides. The α-subunit consists of a single polypeptide chain of 268 amino acid residues and contains no prosthetic groups. Structurally(1Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Padlan E.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17857-17871Google Scholar), it is a member of the α/β barrel family, belonging to a subgroup that includes phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase, indoleglycerolphosphate synthase, and triosephosphate isomerase (2Faber G.K. Petsko G.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1980; 15: 228-234Google Scholar) and is composed of 11 α-helices and 8 β-strands (α11β8). Studies on the unfolding properties of the E. coli protein by urea and/or guanidine were initiated more than a decade ago by the Yutani(3Yutani K. Ogasahara K. Suzuki M. Sugino Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1979; 85: 915-921Google Scholar, 4Iwahashi H. Yutani K. Ogasahara K. Tsunasawa S. Kyogoko Y. Sugino Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 744: 189-192Google Scholar), Matthews(5Matthews C.R. Crisanti M.M. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 784-792Google Scholar), and Miles (6Miles E.W. Higgins W. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6266-6269Google Scholar, 7Miles E.W. Yutani K. Ogasahara K. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2586-2592Google Scholar) groups. The unfolding behavior indicated the presence of a partially unfolded, stable intermediate during the unfolding process. This conclusion was supported by the finding that there was a hypersensitive trypsin site at Arg188(6Miles E.W. Higgins W. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6266-6269Google Scholar), subsequently determined to be located within a region (residues 178-191) that is highly mobile in the crystal structure(1Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Padlan E.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17857-17871Google Scholar). Cleavage at this site yields two fragments, an N-terminal α7β6 fragment (α-1) composed of β-strands 1-6 of the barrel structure and a C-terminal α4β2 fragment (α-2) containing the remaining barrel β-strands 7 and 8. In guanidine, each of these can unfold and refold independently, and when combined, the α-2 folding unit unfolds prior to α-1. These results led initially to the notion that a stable unfolding intermediate existed containing a native α-1 unit and an essentially completely unfolded α-2 unit. In a subsequent extensive analysis by Matthews' groups(8Crisanti M.M. Matthews C.R. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2700-2706Google Scholar, 9Beasty A.M. Matthews C.R.

The Matthews group has employed several singly and doubly altered α-subunits in examining temperature effects on urea denaturation by UV and proton NMR methods. It was concluded that the α-2 unit can assume an organized structure in the intermediate state. The total structure is proposed to be a loosened form of the barrel structure in which β-strand 6 (in α-1) and β-strand 7 (in α-2) have altered packing, although they continue to interact. Not inconsistent with these results, the Yutani group, utilizing calorimetry, CD, and tyrosine fluorescence, has described the equilibrium intermediate structure as a molten globule form. To utilize our collection of 70-80 trpA mutants(18Milton D.L. Napier M.L. Myers R.M. Hardman J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16604-16615Google Scholar, 19Lim W.K. Brouillette C. Hardman J.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 34-41Google Scholar), which exhibit a broad spectrum of thermal instability, we have constructed several wild-type-like host proteins into which we could insert these mutational changes. The goal in preparing such wild-type-like host α-subunits was to be able to monitor separately the behavior of the putative individual α-1 and α-2 folding units while still utilizing the intact protein. To this end, we have substituted a single tryptophan residue within the α-1 folding region (at position 139) in one such host protein and one tryptophan residue within the α-2 folding region (at position 258) in another. The normal α-subunit contains no tryptophan. We report here the suitability (i.e. the spectral properties and wild-type behavior) of these tryptophan-containing α-subunits to serve as host proteins and to provide additional information regarding both the unfolding and refolding pathways for each folding unit and the structure of potential intermediate(s). All chemicals (reagent or ultrapure grade) and enzymes for mutagenesis and sequencing were obtained from Sigma or New England Biolabs. Ultrapure urea was from Life Technologies, Inc. and was used without further purification. Urea concentrations were determined by refractive index measurements. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on a Milligen Biosearch model 8700 DNA synthesizer and purified by reverse phase chromatography on Waters oligo-pak columns. For the Phe139→ Trp139 change, the oligonucleotide 5′-GAGTCCGCGCCCTGGCGGCAGGCCGCG-3′ was used. The sequence alterations from the wild-type sequence (TTCCGG) are underlined and represent those that encode Phe139-Arg140 in the α-subunit. There is a 3-base pair change, which results in the Phe → Trp substitution only but introduces an additional BglI site into the trpA gene that can be used for the initial mutant selection. For the Phe258→ Trp258 change, the oligonucleotide 5′-GGCGCGACTGAAAGTTTGGGTCCAACCGATGAAAGCGGCG-3′ was used. The changes from the wild-type sequence (TTTGTA), again underlined, result in a Phe → Trp substitution only, but in this case there is the loss of an RsaI site in trpA, and this is used for initial mutant selection. The sequence alterations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The mutagenesis/sequencing vector for Phe139 mutagenesis was similar to those described before (18Milton D.L. Napier M.L. Myers R.M. Hardman J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16604-16615Google Scholar, 20Sarken K.D. Hardman J.K. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 21: 130-139Google Scholar) except that a trpA BsaHIXhoI sequence (encoding residues 124-177 in the α-subunit) from ptactrpAMK (20Sarken K.D. Hardman J.K. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 21: 130-139Google Scholar) was inserted immediately 3′-distal to the GC clamp. The mutagenesis/sequencing vector for Phe258 mutagenesis was pGCtrpAVI as described before(20Sarken K.D. Hardman J.K. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 21: 130-139Google Scholar). The procedures for oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis and confirmation of the sequence change by restriction nuclease/DNA sequencing are described elsewhere (20Sarken K.D. Hardman J.K. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 21: 130-139Google Scholar). The mutagenized fragments containing the altered sequences at positions 139 and 258 were subcloned as described before (20Sarken K.D. Hardman J.K. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 21: 130-139Google Scholar) into modified expression vectors of pCATtrpA and ptactrpAMK, respectively. These subclonings yielded expression vectors pCATtrpF139W and ptactrpFW258, which encode the F139W and F258W mutant α-subunits. The double mutant, F139W/F258W, was constructed by substituting the trpA BglII-XhoI fragment (encoding residues 1-177) from pCAT trpF139W for the corresponding wild-type fragment in ptactrpF258W to yield ptactrpF139W/F258W. The α-subunits (wild type, F139W, F258W, and F139W/F258W) were purified from E. coli strain RB797 containing, respectively, ptactrpAMK, pCATtrpF139W, ptactrpF258W, and ptactrpF139W/F258W. Growth conditions and α-subunit purification protocols were identical for all and have been described before(20Sarken K.D. Hardman J.K. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 21: 130-139Google Scholar). The β-subunit was obtained also as previously detailed(20Sarken K.D. Hardman J.K. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 21: 130-139Google Scholar). Wild-type α-subunit concentrations were determined using the molar extinction coefficients at 278 nm of 12,700 cm-1. Concentrations of the tryptophan-containing α-subunits were determined initially by the microbiuret assay (21Leggett-Bailey J. Techniques in Protein Chemistry. Elsevier Scientific Publishing Co., Inc., New York1962: 249Google Scholar) and by comparison with the microbiuret results with the wild-type protein; the molar extinction coefficients at 278 nm were estimated for the F139W, F258W, and F139W/F258W α-subunits. The concentration of the β-subunit was estimated with the E278nm1% of 6.5(22Faeder E.J. Hammes G.G. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 4043-4049Google Scholar). The enzymatic activities of the α-subunits in the tryptophan synthase β- and αβ-reactions were performed according to Lim et al.(23Lim W.K. Sarkar S.A. Hardman J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20205-20212Google Scholar); the α-reaction assays were according to Sarkar et al.(20Sarken K.D. Hardman J.K. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 21: 130-139Google Scholar). Values of kcat for the wild-type α-subunit (in the presence of the β-subunit) in the α-, β-, and αβ-reaction assays were 0.18 s-1, 11.9 s-1, and 6.21 s-1, respectively. All measurements were recorded at ambient temperatures, invariably 23-24°C. The buffer in all experiments is 10 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.8), 0.2 mM disodium EDTA, and 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol. Corrections were made for buffer and denaturant. UV absorbance measurements for equilibrium studies were made with a Perkin-Elmer dual-beam γ 3A spectrophotometer. A Perkin-Elmer luminescence/fluorescence spectrometer model LS50B was used for the fluorescence spectral analysis. The experimental data for the unfolding experiments presented here represent the average of three to six experiments. The standard deviation for each measurement is ±5-10% or less. The data analysis program is a standard non-linear regression utilizing the Levenberg-Marquardt method as described in Press et al.(24Press W.H. Flannery B.P. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Numerical Recipes: The Art of Scientific Computing. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1986Google Scholar). The goal in selecting residue sites within the α-subunit at which to insert tryptophan residues to produce suitable wild-type host proteins was that the substitution would not itself lead to major changes in function and/or stability to denaturants. The selection of Phe139 (the second residue in helix 4) in the α-1 folding unit and Phe258 (a middle residue in helix 9) in the α-2 folding unit was based on a variety of considerations such as lack of conservation at the site, relative residue size, hydrophobicity, secondary structure-forming tendencies, and solvent accessibility. Despite such considerations, it was difficult to predict accurately the effect of tryptophan substitutions at these sites. It was important, therefore, at the outset to characterize some of their enzymatic spectroscopic and urea stability properties. The tryptophan-containing α-subunits were examined for their enzymatic activity in the three tryptophan synthase reactions: the α-, β-, and αβ-reactions. The α-reaction measures the functional integrity of the α-active site with respect to the catalysis of the aldolysis of indole-3-glycerol phosphate to indole and D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. The β-reaction measures the structural capacity of an α-subunit to (a) allow access of indole from the solvent to the β-active site; (b) provide the proper alignment of the intramolecular indole channel between the subunits; and (c) bring about proper conformational changes in the β-subunit to activate its catalysis of indole plus L-serine to L-tryptophan. The αβ-reaction measures the ability of an α-subunit to (a) catalyze an accelerated rate of aldolysis of indole-3-glycerol phosphate at the α-active site; (b) transfer the enzymatically formed indole intramolecularly to the β-active site; and (c) undergo conformational changes induced by the β-subunit (following binding of L-serine to the β-active site) that lead to the increased rate of indole-3-glycerol phosphate utilization. α-Subunits F139W, F258W, and F139W/F258W had relative specific activities, respectively, of 96, 89, and 105% that of the wild-type α-subunit in the α-reaction; 98, 92, and 106% that of the wild-type α-subunit in the β-reaction; and 102, 104, and 100% that of the wild-type α-subunit in the αβ-reaction. All have expected increases in UV absorbance. Mutant α-subunits F139W, F258W, and F139W/F258W have estimated molar extinction coefficients at 278 nm of 16,700 cm-1, 16,690 cm-1, and 20,800 cm-1, respectively, compared to that of 12,700 cm-1 of the wild-type α-subunit. These increases in molar extinction values (above that of the wild-type α-subunit) of 4000 cm-1, 3990 cm-1, and 8100 cm-1, respectively, are consistent with the introduction of either one or two tryptophan residues. A molar extinction value of 4400 cm-1 for L-tryptophan is obtained under similar conditions. The fluorescence behavior of the tryptophan-containing mutants is shown in Fig. 1. All exhibit an emission γmax shift to lower wavelengths and fluorescence intensity increases of varying magnitude (relative to free tryptophan), suggesting that the tryptophan residues are buried in less polar environments within the respective proteins. The spectrum and relative fluorescence intensities of a equimolar mixture of F139W and F258W are virtually identical to the double mutant. For comparative purposes, the urea stability behavior of the wild-type and mutant α-subunits was monitored by UV absorbance changes according to the methods of Matthews and co-workers (5Matthews C.R. Crisanti M.M. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 784-792Google Scholar, 25Beasty A.M. Hurle M.R. Manz J.T. Stackhouse T. Onuffet J.J. Matthews C.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2965-2974Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the absorbance changes upon urea addition to the wild-type and mutant α-subunits; the differences reflect the differences in their respective extinction coefficients. Applying corrections for these differences and assuming that the absorbance changes at 6 M urea represent essentially complete unfolding(5Matthews C.R. Crisanti M.M. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 784-792Google Scholar, 25Beasty A.M. Hurle M.R. Manz J.T. Stackhouse T. Onuffet J.J. Matthews C.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2965-2974Google Scholar), the fractional unfolding versus urea concentrations is given in Fig. 3, A-D, where fapp = (ε−εn)/(εu−εn), ε is the observed extinction coefficient, and εu and εn are the extinction coefficients of the native and unfolded forms. All commence unfolding at 2.2-2.5 M urea and are essentially completely unfolded at 5-5.5 M urea. α-Subunit F139W appears virtually identical to the wild-type α-subunit; α-subunits F258W and F139W/F258W appear to be only slightly more stable. In addition, the unfolding transitions for all appear to be completely reversible (Fig. 3, A-D, open circles).Figure 3:The fractional unfolding, Fapp, versus urea concentration for wild-type (A), F139W (B), F258W (C), and F139W/F258W (D) α-subunits (solid circles). The solid line is that for a two-step, three-state unfolding transition. The open circles represent the calculated Fapp observed upon dilution from 6 M urea to the indicated urea concentration. Panels A′-D′ present the fractions of native (f), intermediate (f), and unfolded (f) forms during unfolding of wild-type (A′), F139W (B′), F258W (C′), and F139W/F258W (D′) α-subunits.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A quantitative comparison of these equilibrium data was made by statistically modeling each data set for a two-step, three-state unfolding model, following the classical treatment for multistep unfolding processes in which there are populated intermediates: Kapp=KD[1+∑iZiKi/KD]/[1+∑i(1−Zi)Ki](Eq. 1) where Kapp is the apparent equilibrium constant, Kd is the product of the Ki values for the individual steps, and Zi is the fractional change in the measured parameter for the product of each step. For the case of a three-state, two-step model as suggested for the α-subunit, namely N⇌K1I⇌K2U(Eq. 2) this relationship can be reformulated as: fapp=K1(Z+K2)1+K1+K1K2(Eq. 3) where K1 and K2 are the equilibrium constants for the N → I, I → U transitions, respectively, and Z = (εi−εn)/(εu−εn) where εI is the extinction coefficient of the intermediate form. The results of these statistical analyses for the wild-type and tryptophan-containing α-subunits are shown by the solid lines on Fig. 3, A-D. For all the α-subunits (wild-type, F139W, F258W, and F139W/F258W), the fit to a two-step model appears to fit the data well. Assuming a linear dependence of free energy on urea concentration, the free energy of unfolding in the absence of denaturant, GH2O, was estimated for each step according to Pace(26Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Google Scholar) : ΔG1=ΔG1H2O+m1C(Eq. 4) and ΔG2=ΔG2H2O+m2C(Eq. 5) where m1, m2 (the slopes) are the cooperativity factors for each plot, and C is the urea concentration. The ΔGH2O, m, and Z values for the four α-subunits are given in Table 1. The values for the wild-type α-subunit compare favorably to those obtained by Beasty et al.(25Beasty A.M. Hurle M.R. Manz J.T. Stackhouse T. Onuffet J.J. Matthews C.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2965-2974Google Scholar) and are shown in parentheses. Mutant α-subunit differences from the wild-type (at zero urea concentrations) in ΔG1H2O and ΔG2H2O vary between −0.6 and −1.4 kcal/mol.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab As pointed out by Beasty et al.(25Beasty A.M. Hurle M.R. Manz J.T. Stackhouse T. Onuffet J.J. Matthews C.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2965-2974Google Scholar) and Cupo and Pace(27Cupo F.J. Pace C.N. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2654-2658Google Scholar), because of potential errors due to the large extrapolation required to determine ΔGH2O and the legitimacy of a linear relationship in this extrapolated range, a more appropriate comparison of stability would be at a urea concentration other than zero. A suitable reference point for comparison would be the urea concentration at the midpoints of the two transitions (N → I, I → U) for the reference wild-type α-subunit, at which ΔG1 and ΔG2 are zero. Utilizing the Z values obtained, the relative proportions of native (fN), intermediate (fI), and unfolded (fU) species for wild-type and tryptophan-containing mutants can be determined; these are shown in Fig. 3, A′-D′, together with the urea concentration (Ci), at which the intermediate is maximal. Only relatively minor differences from the wild-type α-subunit are apparent. The midpoints, Cm1 and Cm2 for each transition for each protein are given also in Table 1. Values of ΔΔG (Table 1) obtained for the mutant proteins at 2.51 and 3.73 M (the midpoints of the N → I and I → U transitions for wild-type α-subunit) vary between −0.26 and 0.33 Kcal/mol. Thus, it appears that the replacement of a phenylalanine by a tryptophan residue at either or both the 139- or 258-residue sites does not appear to significantly alter the stability to urea. The apparent wild-type enzymatic and urea stability (as monitored by UV absorbance) properties of these tryptophan-containing α-subunits would seem to make them ideal host proteins for the introduction of our collection of potentially stabilizing/destabilizing mutational alterations. Moreover, a comparison of both the UV and fluorescence properties of the native forms of F139W and F258W and that of the double mutant, F139W/F258W, indicates that the tryptophan residue in each of these regions of the protein is displayed independently spectroscopically. Therefore, the tryptophan residues substituted at positions 139 and 258 can function as separate reporter groups for monitoring the behavior of the putative α-1 and α-2 folding units in the intact α-subunit. The equilibrium and kinetic unfolding and refolding properties of these mutant α-subunits monitored by fluorescence changes, currently underway, should provide interesting information regarding the intermediate(s) in these pathways and also serve as the wild-type reference behavior for a study of the effects of our other α-subunit mutants."
