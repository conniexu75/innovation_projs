https://openalex.org/W2079188969,"X-ray diffraction and infrared absorption spectra show that the spicules of the common tropical ascidian, Herdmania momus, are mineralized with vaterite. These are the first strictly marine organisms known to normally precipitate vaterite. The biomineralization of vaterite may constitute another link between the urochordates and vertebrates. The vaterite of ascidian spicules immersed in natural seawater remains mineralogically unchanged for 1 year, which indicates that vaterite may be preserved transiently in marine sediments."

Antiserums directed specifically at products of either the H-2K or H-2D loci have no effect on this response."

https://openalex.org/W2056018070,Carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance studies were made on mouse hemoglobin specifically labeled at the C-2 histidine position. Measurement of the spin lattice relaxation times of the label before and after hemolysis of the erythrocytes provides information on the intracellular fluid viscosities.

It is shown how altered consequences may be obtained by different, but equally plausible, interpretations of those constants."

https://openalex.org/W1998117296,"TAYLOR and Ounsted1,2 have proposed a model to account for the age of onset of developmental disorders and their relative incidence between the two sexes. They propose that there is a period in the maturational continuum during which the child is particularly vulnerable to a particular disorder. Males develop more slowly than females and they should therefore reach this “dangerous state” later, and take longer to pass through it. It is therefore predicted for any developmental disorder, that males should show a later age of onset and a higher incidence than females2; but that females are more likely to suffer seriously than males1, (although this does not follow directly from the model). Evidence relevant to these predictions is reported here for congenital hydrocephalus."
