Strong similarities with the resonance Raman spectra of plant phytochrome A indicate that in Agp1 the methine bridge isomerization state of the chromophore is ZZZasa in Pr and ZZEssa in Pfr, with all pyrrole nitrogens being protonated. Photoexcitation of Pr is followed by (at least) three thermal relaxation components in the formation of Pfr with time constants of 230 μs and 3.1 and 260 ms. H2O/D2O exchange reveals kinetic isotope effects of 1.9, 2.6, and 1.3 for the respective transitions that are accompanied by changes of the amplitudes. The second and the third relaxation correspond to the formation and decay of Meta-RC, respectively. Resonance Raman measurements of Meta-RC indicate that the chromophore adopts a deprotonated ZZE configuration. Measurements with a pH indicator dye show that formation and decay of Meta-RC are associated with proton release and uptake, respectively. The stoichiometry of the proton release corresponds to one proton per photoconverted molecule. The coupling of transient chromophore deprotonation and proton release, which is likely to be an essential element in the Pr → Pfr photocon-version mechanism of phytochromes in general, may play a crucial role for the structural changes in the final step of the Pfr formation that switch between the active and the inactive state of the photoreceptor.

The stoichiometry of the proton release corresponds to one proton per photoconverted molecule. The coupling of transient chromophore deprotonation and proton release, which is likely to be an essential element in the Pr → Pfr photocon-version mechanism of phytochromes in general, may play a crucial role for the structural changes in the final step of the Pfr formation that switch between the active and the inactive state of the photoreceptor. Phytochromes are photoreceptors that utilize light as a source of information for controlling numerous biological processes (1Kendrick R.E. Kronenberg G.H.M. Photomorphogenesis in Plants. 2nd. Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994Crossref Google Scholar, 2Quail P.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). The chromophore, a methine-bridged tetrapyrrole (Fig. 1), acts as a photo-switch between two stable, spectrally distinct forms, denoted as Pr and Pfr according to the red and far-red absorption maxima, respectively. The Pr/Pfr interconversion is initiated by the rapid Z/E photoisomerization of the C-D methine bridge (3Rüdiger W. Thümmler F. Cmiel E. Schneider S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6244-6248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), followed by chromophore relaxations that are coupled to structural changes of the apoprotein (4Song P.S. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 32: 215-225Google Scholar). These structural changes are the trigger for signal transduction. Resonance Raman (RR) 2The abbreviations used are: RR, resonance Raman; Agp1, Agrobacterium phytochrome 1; BV, biliverdin; BVM, BV dimethyl ester; Cph1, cyanobacterial phytochrome 1; phyA, plant phytochrome A; Pfr, far-red absorbing form of phytochrome; Pr, red-absorbing form of phytochrome; SVD, singular value decomposition; H/D, H2O/D2O. and IR spectroscopy have provided valuable insight into light-induced chromophore and protein structural changes (e.g. see Refs. 5Mizutani Y.

Soc. 2004; 126: 16734-16735Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), but molecular and mechanistic details are not yet known and no crystal structure of a phytochrome has been reported so far. While phytochromes were originally thought to be restricted to plants, the discovery of these chromoproteins in cyanobacteria (11Hughes J. Lamparter T. Mittmann F. Hartmann E. Gärtner W. Wilde A. Börner T. Nature. 1997; 386: 663Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) and other bacteria points to the prokaryotic origin of this family of photo-receptors. In contrast to plant phytochromes, typical bacterial phytochromes are light-regulated histidine kinases. Despite the quite different regulatory functions (12Vierstra R.D. Davis S.J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 13Lamparter T. FEBS Lett. 2004; 573: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), plant and bacterial phytochromes exhibit structural and mechanistic similarities. The phytochromobilin chromophore of plant phytochromes and the phycocyanobilin chromophore of cyanobacterial phytochromes (1Kendrick R.E. Kronenberg G.H.M. Photomorphogenesis in Plants. 2nd.

Nature. 2001; 414: 716-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) are covalently bound to Cys residues in the so-called GAF domain. Furthermore, the chromophore configurations and conformations of the parent states as well as the reaction kinetics have been shown be to quite comparable in plant phytochrome A (phyA) and cyanobacterial phytochrome Cph1 (8Remberg A. Lindner I. Lamparter T. Hughes J. Kneip K. Hildebrandt P. Braslavsky S. Gärtner W. Schaffner K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13389-13395Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). For Cph1, significant kinetic H/D isotope effects and a transient proton translocation during Pr → Pfr photoconversion have been observed (8Remberg A. Lindner I. Lamparter T. Hughes J. Kneip K. Hildebrandt P. Braslavsky S. Gärtner W. Schaffner K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13389-13395Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 15van Thor J.J. Borucki B. Crielaard W. Otto H. Lamparter T. Hughes J. Hellingwerf K.J. Heyn M.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11460-11471Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, it is not yet clear if proton transfer also occurs in other phytochromes and if the chromophore is involved. Another group of bacterial phytochromes incorporates biliverdin (BV) as chromophore (14Bhoo S.H. Davis S.J. Walker J. Karniol B. Viestra R.D. Nature. 2001; 414: 716-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), which is covalently bound to a cysteine close to the N terminus of the protein (13Lamparter T. FEBS Lett. 2004; 573: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 16Lamparter T. Michael N. Mittmann F. Esteban B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11628-11633Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 17Lamparter T. Carrascal M. Michael N. Martinez E. Rottwinkel G. Abian J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3659-3669Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The biophysical properties of BV-binding phytochromes have not yet been analyzed in great detail. As far as Pr/Pfr photoreversibility and UV-visible spectral properties of Pr and Pfr are concerned, these phytochromes share common features with their cyanobacterial and plant orthologs. In view of the above similarities, mechanisms found for bacterial phytochromes may well be of universal significance and also be valid for plant phytochromes. In the present work, we have studied the recently discovered phytochrome Agp1 from Agrobacterium tumefaciens (16Lamparter T. Michael N. Mittmann F. Esteban B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11628-11633Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), which belongs to the group of BV-binding phytochromes. Site-directed mutagenesis and mass spectrometry studies showed that BV is covalently bound to Cys20 of Agp1 via its ring A vinyl side chain (13Lamparter T. FEBS Lett. 2004; 573: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 16Lamparter T. Michael N. Mittmann F. Esteban B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11628-11633Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 17Lamparter T. Carrascal M. Michael N. Martinez E. Rottwinkel G. Abian J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3659-3669Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The BV-Agp1 adduct displays a reversible Pr → Pfr phototransformation characteristic for all representatives of the phytochrome family. As in other bacterial phytochromes, the histidine kinase activity of Agp1 is deactivated upon conversion from Pr to Pfr (16Lamparter T. Michael N. Mittmann F. Esteban B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11628-11633Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We have employed transient absorption and RR spectroscopy to analyze the Pr → Pfr photoconversion of BV-Agp1. Specifically, we have investigated (i) the dynamics of the chromophore-protein interaction and the protonation state of the protein on the μs and ms time scale of the Pr/Pfr reaction cycle and (ii) the chromophore structures in the parent and intermediates states. Sample Preparation—Expression and purification of Agp1 as well as the formation of the BV-Agp1 adduct have been described in detail elsewhere (16Lamparter T. Michael N. Mittmann F. Esteban B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11628-11633Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The protein was purified by affinity chromatography and size exclusion chromatography. After chromatography, BV-Agp1 was essentially pure as checked by SDS-PAGE (see supplemental Fig. 1). The specific absorbance ratio deduced from UV-visible spectra (supplemental Fig. 2) was routinely between 0.95 and 1.0. In cases where high protein concentrations were required, the volume of the sample was reduced by ultrafiltration. Buffer exchange for measurements in D2O and for de/reprotonation measurements was performed with the use of desalting columns. For low temperature UV-visible absorption spectroscopy and Resonance Raman measurements, protein solutions contained 5 mm EDTA, 300 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris at a pH and pD of 7.8 in H2O and D2O solutions, respectively. Flash photolysis experiments were performed either in 20 mm Tris at pH 7.8 and pD 7.8, respectively, or in unbuffered solutions at pH 7.8 containing 50 mm NaCl and a 0-120 μm concentration of the pH indicator dye cresol red. BV-Agp1 concentrations, determined from the absorption at 700 nm using an extinction coefficient of 90 mm-1 cm-1 for Pr (16Lamparter T. Michael N. Mittmann F. Esteban B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11628-11633Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), were 16-22 μm and 3 mm in UV-visible absorption and RR spectroscopic measurements, respectively. Photoconversion to Pfr and Pr was achieved by irradiating the solution with 660 and 784 nm light, respectively, using either a light-emitting diode, a white lamp with appropriate filters, or a laser diode. Low Temperature UV-visible Absorption Spectroscopy—Low temperature UV-visible absorption spectra were measured with a Cary 50 Bio, equipped with an Oxford cryostat. All experiments were carried out with a sample in aqueous buffer solution with the protein being largely (>90%) in one of the parent states. The background scattering resulting from the opaque frozen samples was removed by subtracting a fitted λ4-curve from the measured spectrum. Transient UV-visible Absorption Spectroscopy—Flash photolysis of BV-Agp1 was performed by excitation with 10-ns pulses using an excimer-pumped dye laser with an emission maximum at 695 nm (Pyridine 1) and a maximum output energy of 5 mJ/cm2 (15van Thor J.J. Borucki B. Crielaard W. Otto H. Lamparter T. Hughes J. Hellingwerf K.J. Heyn M.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11460-11471Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 18Borucki B. Otto H. Heyn M.P. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1999; 103: 6371-6383Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Prior to each flash excitation the sample was re-converted to Pr to more than 95% with 784 nm illumination (60 milliwatts, 20 s). We note that the remaining fraction of Pfr was negligible for the transient absorption spectroscopic measurements in view of the lower extinction coefficient (∼30 mm-1 cm-1 at 695 nm) and the low quantum yield (∼0.004) of Pfr (16Lamparter T. Michael N. Mittmann F. Esteban B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11628-11633Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Absorbance changes were monitored at different wavelengths in the Soret (360-450 nm) and Q-band region (600-800 nm), from 100 ns to 5 s after flash excitation. The signals were corrected for energy fluctuations of the pulses and irreversible bleaching, which was found to be 10% after 450 laser flashes. Photoinduced proton release (and uptake) of BV-Agp1 was determined by monitoring the absorbance changes of the pH indicator dye cresol red (pKa = 8.2) at 570 nm as described (15van Thor J.J. Borucki B. Crielaard W. Otto H. Lamparter T. Hughes J. Hellingwerf K.J. Heyn M.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11460-11471Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 19Borucki B. Devanathan S. Otto H. Cusanovich M.A. Tollin G. Heyn M.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10026-10037Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Transient absorption data at multiple wavelengths ΔA(λ,t) were analyzed by singular value decomposition (SVD) and simultaneous fitting (20Henry E.R. Hofrichter J. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 129-192Crossref Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 21Borucki B. Otto H. Rottwinkel G. Hughes J. Heyn M.P. Lamparter T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13684-13697Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The amplitude spectra Bi(λ) were constructed from the results of this analysis (21Borucki B. Otto H. Rottwinkel G. Hughes J. Heyn M.P. Lamparter T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13684-13697Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Resonance Raman Spectroscopy—RR spectra were obtained with 1064 nm excitation (Nd-YAG cw laser, line width < 1 cm-1) with a Digilab Bio-Rad Fourier transform Raman spectrometer (4 cm-1 spectral resolution) (7Kneip C. Hildebrandt P. Schlamann W. Braslavsky S.E. Mark F. Schaffner K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15185-15192Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). All spectra were measured at -140 °C using liquid nitrogen-cooled cryostats from CryoVac (7Kneip C. Hildebrandt P. Schlamann W. Braslavsky S.E. Mark F. Schaffner K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15185-15192Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) or Resultec (Linkam). The laser power was between 400 and 700 milliwatts at the sample, which does not cause any laser-induced damage of the protein samples as checked by comparing the spectra obtained before and after a series of measurements. The total accumulation time was ∼2 h for each spectrum. In all RR spectra shown in this work, a linear background was subtracted. RR spectroscopic measurements of phyA have been described previously (7Kneip C. Hildebrandt P. Schlamann W. Braslavsky S.E. Mark F. Schaffner K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15185-15192Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Preparation and RR spectroscopic measurements of BV dimethyl ester (BVM) photoisomers have been reported before (22Matysik J. Hildebrandt P. Smit K. Mark F. Gärtner W. Braslavsky S.E. Schaffner K. Schrader B. J. Pharmacol. Biomed. Anal. 1997; 15: 1319-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Kinetics of the Photoinduced Pr → Pfr Transformation—Transient absorption changes of BV-Agp1 in H2O and D2O, monitored after 695 nm excitation, display multiphasic behavior (Fig. 2), indicating a sequence of spectral transitions in the Pr → Pfr photoconversion. Since the primary photoproduct of phytochromes including BV-Agp1 is formed on the picosecond time scale (24Heyne K. Herbst J. Stehlik D. Esteban B. Lamparter T. Hughes J. Diller R. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1004-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), 3I. Y. Chan, F. Peters, J. Herbst, D. Stehlik, N. Michael, T. Lamparter, and Diller, R., submitted for publication. beyond the time resolution of the present set up, the kinetics studied in this work refer to the thermal relaxation steps on the route to Pfr that proceed on the micro- to millisecond time scale. The formation of Pfr is completed within seconds as concluded from the signal at 750 nm (Fig. 2C), which remains constant after about 3 s. The absorbance changes at 700 and 725 nm (Fig. 2, A and B) in the time range 1-5 s are due to Pr → Pfr conversion induced by the probe light. In the time range below 1 s, the effect of the measuring light is negligible and the signals exclusively reflect thermal relaxation processes following flash excitation of the Pr state. As shown in Fig. 2, H2O/D2O exchange affects both time constants and amplitudes of the Pr → Pfr spectral transitions. A quantitative analysis of the time traces obtained at 35 wavelengths was performed for the time range from 2 μs to 1 s. In this way, the noisy data below 2 μs and the effects of the measuring light for irradiation times > 1 s are omitted. SVD analysis revealed four relevant components in H2O and D2O. Additional components, with singular values of less than 1% with respect to the singular value of the first component, show very noisy time traces and were thus neglected. An excellent global fit to the traces was achieved with four exponentials (see Fig. 3). In H2O time constants of 6.9 and 230 μs and 3.1 and 260 ms were obtained which are indicated by dashed vertical lines in Fig. 3 and summarized in TABLE ONE. The first component, which shows a small negative amplitude only at the emission maximum of the laser and which has essentially the same time constant (τ1) in H2O and D2O, is most likely due to a flash artifact although a contribution from absorption changes of BV-Agp1 cannot be ruled out. The other three components, which represent true relaxation processes, display considerable deuterium kinetic isotope effects of 1.9 (τ2), 2.6 (τ3), and 1.3 (τ4) (Fig. 3 and TABLE ONE). From the amplitudes of the fits to the weighted V-traces and the associated basis spectra, the amplitude spectra were calculated as described before (21Borucki B. Otto H. Rottwinkel G. Hughes J. Heyn M.P. Lamparter T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13684-13697Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The amplitude spectra B0(λ) (Fig. 4), determined from the constants of the fits for the measurements in H2O and D2O, reflect the extrapolated final spectra after flash excitation of the Pr state. These spectra agree very well with the scaled down steady-state “Pfr - Pr” difference spectra (dashed lines). This agreement confirms that the relaxation cascade of the Pr → Pfr photoconversion is completed within the time window of the transient measurements and that the time constant τ4 reflects the formation of the Pfr state. From the scaling factor of the steady-state Pfr - Pr difference spectrum the excitation efficiency was estimated to be 20 ± 2%.TABLE ONETime constants (τ), amplitudes (Bi), and activation energies (EA) of the photoinduced Pr → Pfr conversion of BV-Agp 1 determined in flashphotolysis experimentsSolventParameterRelaxation componentsB1B2B3B4H2Oτ6.9 μs230 μs3.1 ms260 msD2Oτ7.3 μs440 μs8.2 ms340 msH2OEA/kJ·mol−167 ± 286 ± 4109 ± 2D2OEA/kJ·mol−169 ± 385 ± 6112 ± 5 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 4Amplitude spectra Bi(λ) calculated from the amplitudes of the exponential fits and the corresponding SVD basis spectra, from measurements in H2O (A) and D2O (B).

When scaled to the same number of photoconverted molecules, these amplitudes are larger by ∼20% in H2O than in D2O. The amplitudes of the subsequent relaxation component (Fig. 4) show large positive and negative values at ∼680 and 760 nm, respectively. Whereas the 680 nm amplitude is solvent-independent, the 760 nm amplitude is increased in D2O. The fourth component (Fig. 4) includes a negative amplitude in the 600-800 nm range (maximum at ∼750 nm), which is larger by ∼30% in H2O than in D2O, and positive (≤400 nm) and negative (410-450 nm) contributions in the Soret band region. Control experiments in H2O solutions that contain 0.2 m sucrose, corresponding to the same solvent viscosity as D2O, reveal the same kinetic data as in the absence of sucrose (data not shown). We conclude, therefore, that the changes of the time constants and amplitudes in D2O represent true kinetic isotope effects. Increasing temperatures in the range from 10 to 35 °C accelerate the decays of the three relevant components, while their amplitudes remain almost unchanged. The activation energies that are derived from the Arrhenius plots (data not shown) do not differ in H2O and D2O within experimental error (TABLE ONE). Photoinduced Proton Release—To detect protonation changes in the external medium, we measured the transient absorption changes of the pH indicator dye cresol red that was added to the unbuffered solution at different concentrations. To correct for contributions of the protein, absorption changes were measured also without pH indicator dye. The dye signal (ΔΔA, the difference between the signals with and without pH indicator dye) displays a proton release phase followed by a proton uptake phase and can be described by two exponentials with time constants that agree very well with τ3 and τ4 determined for the photoinduced Pr → Pfr transformation under the same conditions (Fig. 5A). Thus, proton release occurs synchronously with the formation of the precursor of Pfr, whereas the subsequent proton uptake can be related to the final transition to Pfr. The kinetics and the pattern of de/reprotonation are similar to that observed with cyanobacterial phytochrome Cph1 (15van Thor J.J. Borucki B. Crielaard W. Otto H. Lamparter T. Hughes J. Hellingwerf K.J. Heyn M.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11460-11471Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The dependence of the (maximal) absorbance changes on the dye concentration (Fig. 5B) allows determining the number of protons transiently released per photoconverted protein (19Borucki B. Devanathan S. Otto H. Cusanovich M.A. Tollin G. Heyn M.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10026-10037Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), yielding a value of 1.1 ± 0.2. However, proton release is not fully reversed (<50%; Fig. 5A), indicating a net acidification of the protein in the Pfr state, which was confirmed by stationary dye and pH electrode measurements in Pr and in the Pr/Pfr photoequilibrium (data not shown). Low Temperature UV-visible Absorption Spectroscopy—After conversion to Pr, BV-Agp1 was frozen to -140 °C and subsequently irradiated with 700 nm light. Even after prolonged irradiation for 30 min, no changes in the absorption spectrum were observed whereas at ambient temperature these irradiation conditions are more than sufficient to convert BV-Agp1 to Pfr. This finding implies that either Pr forms a photo-reversible equilibrium with the primary photoproduct that exhibits only a very small photostationary concentration or that photoconversion is completely blocked at low temperature. Taking into account the band narrowing at low temperature and uncertainties due to the λ4 subtraction, the spectra of Pr and Pfr that are obtained by this procedure are very similar to those measured from the protein solution at ambient temperature (16Lamparter T. Michael N. Mittmann F. Esteban B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11628-11633Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The experiments were repeated upon stepwise increasing the temperature at which the sample was irradiated. Only at ∼-25 °C, the absorption spectra display substantial changes indicating the accumulation of an intermediate state. Subtracting the residual contribution of unphotolyzed Pr, an absorption spectrum is obtained that is reminiscent of the Meta-RC state found in phyA (Fig. 6) (25Eilfeld P. Rüdiger W. Z. Naturforsch. 1985; 40C: 109-114Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The difference spectrum “intermediate minus Pfr” reveals close similarities to the amplitude spectrum of the fourth relaxation component (B4) obtained in the time-resolved measurements and an even better agreement is achieved for a mixture of 85% of B4 and 15% of B3. Thus, the cryogenically trapped state mainly corresponds to the precursor of Pfr and is, therefore, denoted as Meta-RC(Agp1) in analogy to the Pfr precursor of phyA stabilized at the same temperature (25Eilfeld P. Rüdiger W. Z. Naturforsch. 1985; 40C: 109-114Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Resonance Raman Spectroscopic Analysis of the Chromophore Structures in the Parent States—The RR spectra of the Pr and Pfr states in H2O and D2O were obtained by photoconversion of BV-Agp1 into the respective state at ambient temperature and subsequent cooling to -140 °C in the dark. For both states, the overall vibrational band patterns display far reaching similarities with the RR spectra of the respective states of phyA (Fig. 7). In particular, the prominent bands between 1500 and 1650 cm-1 of both Pr and Pfr show a one-to-one correspondence between phyA and BV-Agp1. Slightly different frequencies and relative intensities mainly originate from the different chemical constitutions of the chromophores (phytochromobilin versus BV; Fig. 1), as indicated by preliminary normal mode calculations. For the Pr state of phyA, it has been demonstrated that the chromophore adopts the ZZZasa configuration with all pyrrole nitrogens being protonated (7Kneip C. Hildebrandt P. Schlamann W.

Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 16734-16735Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The double bond configuration of the Pfr chromophore, which is also in the protonated form, has been shown to be ZZE (10Mroginski M.A. Murgida D.H. von Stetten D. Kneip C. Mark F. Hildebrandt P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 16734-16735Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Theoretical calculations furthermore suggest a (partial) rotation around the A-B single bond in Pfr. This conclusion is based on the substantial downshift of the C=C stretching of the A-B methine bridge from 1643 (Pr) to 1618 cm-1 (Pfr), which is only reproduced by the calculated spectrum for the ZZEssa configuration (10Mroginski M.A. Murgida D.H. von Stetten D. Kneip C. Mark F. Hildebrandt P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 16734-16735Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In BV-Agp1, the downshift of this mode compared with the Pr state is about the same as in phyA. The most characteristic marker band for the (protonated) cationic form of the tetrapyrrole originates from the N-H in-plane bending of the rings B and C (7Kneip C. Hildebrandt P. Schlamann W. Braslavsky S.E. Mark F. Schaffner K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15185-15192Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), which leads to relatively intense bands at 1574 (Pr) and 1555 cm-1 (Pfr) in phyA and at similar frequencies in BV-Agp1. Upon H/D exchange, these bands disappear concomitant to a 5- and 7-cm-1 downshift of the bands at 1626 and 1600 cm-1 of Pr and Pfr, respectively. This band originates from the C=C stretching of the C-D methine bridge and exhibits the strongest RR intensity in cationic and neutral tetrapyrroles in general (7Kneip C. Hildebrandt P. Schlamann W. Braslavsky S.E. Mark F. Schaffner K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15185-15192Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 10Mroginski M.A. Murgida D.H. von Stetten D. Kneip C. Mark F. Hildebrandt P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 16734-16735Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, this band shows an appreciable frequency downshift upon H/D exchange only in the cationic form. Thus, we conclude that (i) the respective methine bridge isomerization state of the chromophores in Pr and Pfr is the same in BV-Agp1 and phyA, i.e. ZZZasa in Pr and ZZEssa in Pfr, and (ii) in both parent states the chromophore is protonated. Subtle details in the chromophore structures may be different for each of the parent states, as it can be concluded from the RR spectra of BV-Agp1 and phyA in the frequency range below 1500 cm-1. Chromophore Structure of the Meta-RC(Agp1) Intermediate—Following the protocol employed in low temperature UV-visible absorption measurements, Meta-RC(Agp1) was accumulated and studied by RR spectroscopy. The RR spectra obtained under these conditions also include contributions from the unphotolyzed parent state Pr, which were subtracted using characteristic bands of Pr (e.g. at 1626 and 1570 cm-1 in H2O) as a reference (7Kneip C. Hildebrandt P. Schlamann W. Braslavsky S.E. Mark F. Schaffner K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15185-15192Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The most prominent band in the spectrum of Meta-RC(Agp1) in H2O (Fig. 8A) that is attributable to the C=C stretching of the C-D methine bridge is found at 1590 cm-1, which is lower in frequency by ∼10 cm-1 than the corresponding band of the Pfr spectrum (Fig. 7), despite the putatively same (E) configuration of the C-D methine bridge. This band remains largely unchanged in D2O in contrast to the corresponding modes in Pr and Pfr (Figs. 7 and 8A). Moreover, no band attributable to the N-H in-plane bending of the rings B and C is observed in the region between 1500 and 1590 cm-1, which only displays weak bands that are invariant upon H/D exchange. Only the 1619-cm-1 band that originates from a mode involving the C=C stretching of the A-B methine bridge and a small contribution from the N-H in plane bending of ring A exhibits a 4-cm-1 downshift and an intensity decrease in D2O. Thus, the lack of the marker bands for cationic tetrapyrroles indicates that the chromophore in Meta-RC(Agp1) adopts a ZZE configuration with one of the inner rings B or C being deprotonated. This interpretation is confirmed by comparison with the RR spectra of the ZZE isomer of deprotonated BVM that can be obtained by photoconversion of the helical BVM (ZZZsss) (Fig. 8B) (22Matysik J. Hildebrandt P. Smit K. Mark F. Gärtner W. Braslavsky S.E. Schaffner K. Schrader B. J. Pharmacol. Biomed. Anal. 1997; 15: 1319-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The frequencies and the relative band intensities as well as the spectral changes brought about by H/D exchange are very similar to those in the spectra of Meta-RC(Agp1). Mechanisms of the Pr → Pfr Phototransformation—On the basis of the available RR spectra, we conclude that in BV-Agp1, phyA and Cph1 (7Kneip C. Hildebrandt P. Schlamann W. Braslavsky S.E. Mark F. Schaffner K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15185-15192Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 8Remberg A. Lindner I. Lamparter T. Hughes J. Kneip K. Hildebrandt P. Braslavsky S. Gärtner W. Schaffner K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13389-13395Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), the chromophore adopts a protonated ZZZasa and a protonated ZZEssa configuration in Pr and Pfr, respectively. Whereas in Cph1 and phyA the corresponding chromophore structures agree even in details, minor differences exist in BV-Agp1 due to slightly different interactions with the protein environment that may be related to the specific chromophore-binding site in Agp1 and the different chemical constitution of the chromophore. Nevertheless, the gross chromophore structural changes during the Pr → Pfr conversion are likely to be the same, including the Z/E double bond isomerization at the C-D methine bridge in the primary photoprocess (3Rüdiger W. Thümmler F. Cmiel E. Schneider S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6244-6248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Mroginski M.A. Murgida D.H. von Stetten D. Kneip C. Mark F. Hildebrandt P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 16734-16735Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and a thermal rotation around the single bond of the A-B methine bridge. Also the number of the thermal chromophore relaxations and their decay times after photoexcitation of the Pr state are similar in BV-Agp1 (TABLE ONE), Cph1 (8Remberg A. Lindner I. Lamparter T. Hughes J. Kneip K. Hildebrandt P. Braslavsky S. Gärtner W. Schaffner K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13389-13395Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 15van Thor J.J. Borucki B. Crielaard W. Otto H. Lamparter T. Hughes J. Hellingwerf K.J. Heyn M.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11460-11471Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and phyA (26Schmidt, P. Gensch, T., Remberg, A., Gärtner, W., Braslavsky S.E. Schaffner K. Photochem. Photobiol. 1998; 68: 755-762Google Scholar, 27Aramendía P.E. Ruszicska B.P. Braslavsky S.E. Schaffner K. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1418-1422Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Adopting the nomenclature established for phyA (25Eilfeld P. Rüdiger W. Z. Naturforsch. 1985; 40C: 109-114Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar), we therefore assign τ2, τ3, and τ4 to the decay times of Lumi-R(Agp1), Meta-RA(Agp1), and Meta-RC(Agp1), respectively. However, the amplitude changes of BV-Agp1 in D2O cannot be reconciled with a simple sequential reaction scheme but indicate the involvement of branching and/or back reactions (equilibria). The activation energies for the Pr → Pfr photoconversion of BV-Agp1 increase in the sequence of the relaxation processes and, at least, for the first decay (Lumi-R(Agp1)) the activation energy is higher (∼67 kJ/mol) than in the case of phyA (50-60 kJ/mol; (28)). Thus, it is surprising that unlike in phyA, it was not possible to trap cryogenically either Lumi-R(Agp1) or Meta-RA(Agp1), and the only relaxation product that is stabilized at low temperatures is Meta-RC(Agp1), the precursor of Pfr. This discrepancy suggests that in BV-Agp1 either the primary photo-process is blocked up to a temperature of ∼-25 °C, or the intermediates Lumi-R(Agp1) and Meta-RA(Agp1) can be efficiently photo-converted back to Pr. The thermal relaxation processes of Lumi-R(Agp1) and Meta-RA(Agp1) are associated with relatively large kinetic isotope effects of 1.9 and 2.6, respectively (TABLE ONE), which are nearly as large as those observed for the Pr → Pfr photoconversion of Cph1 (8Remberg A. Lindner I. Lamparter T. Hughes J. Kneip K. Hildebrandt P. Braslavsky S. Gärtner W. Schaffner K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13389-13395Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Kinetic isotope effects of this magnitude are consistent with a proton transfer as the rate-limiting step. Whereas the molecular event associated with the isotope effect of the Lumi-R(Agp1) decay cannot be identified, the subsequent transition to Meta-Rc(Agp1) correlates with the proton release of Agp1. Since in Meta-Rc(Agp1) the tetrapyrrole is deprotonated, it is concluded that proton release is coupled to the deprotonation of the chromophore which is assigned to be the rate-limiting step in the formation of Meta-Rc(Agp1). A transient deprotonation of the tetrapyrrole may result from the reorganization of the hydrogen bond network associated with a rotation around the A-B methine bridge single bond, which has to occur during the thermal relaxation steps to Pfr. Thus, it is tempting to assume that this rotation is linked to the chromophore deprotonation in Meta-RC(Agp1), which in turn is coupled to the transient release of one proton to the solvent. The subsequent reprotonation of the chromophore in Pfr only leads to a substoichiometric proton re-uptake of less than 0.5 H+ implying that the protein structural changes associated with the Pfr formation cause a pKa alteration of one (or more) protonable residue(s). The far reaching similarities with respect to the chromophore structures in the parent states and the kinetics of the photoinduced processes in Agp1, Cph1, and phyA suggest that the Pr → Pfr conversion proceeds via the same mechanism in all phytochromes. As shown in this work, the transient deprotonation of the chromophore represents a crucial reaction step in this mechanism. Proton release and (partial) uptake associated with the rise and decay of Meta-RC could be observed with Agp1 (this study) as well as with Cph1 (15van Thor J.J. Borucki B. Crielaard W. Otto H. Lamparter T. Hughes J. Hellingwerf K.J. Heyn M.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11460-11471Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, so far, an intermediate with a deprotonated chromophore has only been unambiguously identified in Agp1. For phyA, RR spectroscopic studies have led to conflicting conclusions about the protonation state of Meta-RC (5Mizutani Y. Tokutomi S. Kitagawa T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 7Kneip C. Hildebrandt P. Schlamann W. Braslavsky S.E. Mark F. Schaffner K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15185-15192Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), although these discrepancies could be due to the involvement of the chromophore in an acid-base equilibrium. Since the positions of such equilibria sensitively depend on the local protein environment of the various phytochromes, accumulation of the deprotonated Meta-RC form that is sufficient for a safe spectroscopic identification may not be possible in each case. In fact, H/D effects on the amplitudes of the thermal relaxation steps of the Pr → Pfr phototransformation observed for Agp1 in this work are consistent with acid-base equilibria. Thus, we conclude that the coupling of chromophore structural changes and proton translocation revealed for BV-Agp1 is an essential element for the photoinduced reaction mechanism of phytochromes in general, and only details of the kinetics and positions of the acid-base equilibria may be different among the various representatives of this photoreceptor family.

https://openalex.org/W2080422741,"BAL1 (B-aggressive lymphoma 1) was originally identified as a risk-related gene in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. BAL1 encodes a nuclear protein with N-terminal macro domains and a putative C-terminal poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) active site. Macro domains are sequences homologous to the non-histone region of histone macroH2A. Several lines of evidence suggest that these domains may modulate transcription, including a high concentration of histone macroH2A in the inactive X chromosome, direct interference with transcription factor binding in a positioned nucleosome, and structural similarity to DNA binding domains. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is a critical post-translational modification that regulates chromatin configuration and transcription. In this report we describe two additional BAL family members, BAL2 and BAL3, with N-terminal macro domains and putative C-terminal PARP active sites and assess the function of these specific regions in BAL family members. Herein, we demonstrate that BAL macro domains repress transcription when tethered to a promoter. In addition, we show that BAL2 and BAL3, but not BAL1, exhibit PARP activity. In agreement with these data, BAL1 lacks several critical donor and acceptor residues that are conserved in the BAL2 and -3 PARP active sites. Of interest, BAL family members with inactive or functional PARP domains differed in their ability to repress transcription. BAL family members are the only described proteins with both PARP and macro domains, underscoring the potential functional significance of this unique combination.

The BAL1 (B-Aggressive lymphoma 1) gene was originally identified in a genome-wide search for risk-related genes in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) 3The abbreviations used are: DLBCL, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; contig, group of overlapping clones; aa, amino acid(s); PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; GST, glutathione S-transferase; 3-ABA, 3-aminobenzamide; DBD, DNA binding domain; TK, thymidine kinase.3The abbreviations used are: DLBCL, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; contig, group of overlapping clones; aa, amino acid(s); PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; GST, glutathione S-transferase; 3-ABA, 3-aminobenzamide; DBD, DNA binding domain; TK, thymidine kinase. (1Aguiar R.C. Yakushijin Y. Kharbanda S. Salgia R. Fletcher J.A. Shipp M.A. Blood. 2000; 96: 4328-4334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a pilot series of primary DLBCLs, BAL expression was significantly higher in chemoresistant tumors. In our initial report, we also showed that BAL1 encodes a nuclear protein with a duplicated N-terminal domain homologous to the non-histone region of histone macroH2A (2Pehrson J.R. Fried V.A. Science. 1992; 257: 1398-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). This ≈135-aa non-histone region, which contains a short stretch of basic residues and a putative leucine zipper motif, has been termed a macro domain (3Ladurner A.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1-3Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 4Aravind L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 273-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that macro domains may modulate transcription. First, histone macroH2A is enriched in the inactive mammalian X chromosome, potentially implicating the macro domain-containing protein in gene silencing (5Costanzi C. Pehrson J.R. Nature. 1998; 393: 599-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). More specifically, the macro domain of histone macroH2A represses transcription in vitro (6Perche P.Y. Vourc'h C. Konecny L. Souchier C. Robert-Nicoud M. Dimitrov S. Khochbin S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1531-1534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and directly interferes with transcription factor binding in nucleosomes containing this variant histone (7Angelov D. Molla A. Perche P.Y. Hans F. Cote J. Khochbin S. Bouvet P. Dimitrov S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1033-1041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In addition, the crystallographic structure of a macro domain-only protein (AF1521, from Archaeoglobus fulgidus) includes a known DNA binding motif, further suggesting that macro domains might interact with nucleic acids (8Allen M.D. Buckle A.M. Cordell S.C. Lowe J. Bycroft M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In addition to containing N-terminal candidate macro domains, the BAL1 protein includes a C-terminal region with homology to the catalytic domain of PARP (poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase) proteins. PARPs catalyze the transfer of ADP-ribose onto acceptor proteins using NAD+ as a substrate (9Ame J.C. Spenlehauer C. de Murcia G. BioEssays. 2004; 26: 882-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar, 10Smith S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 174-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The resulting poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of acceptor proteins has been principally associated with functions of the prototype PARP-1 enzyme and its role in DNA repair (9Ame J.C. Spenlehauer C. de Murcia G. BioEssays. 2004; 26: 882-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). Recently, other PARP domain-containing proteins have been identified and implicated in additional nuclear processes (11Ju B.G. Solum D. Song E.J. Lee K.J. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 2004; 119: 815-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 12Kim M.Y. Mauro S. Gevry N. Lis J.T. Kraus W.L.

This diverse group of proteins contains a minimal PARP active site embedded within a larger polypeptide (9Ame J.C. Spenlehauer C. de Murcia G. BioEssays. 2004; 26: 882-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). In these proteins, termed the PARP superfamily, the functional consequences of PARP activity may be dependent on additional functional domains. For example, the PARP family member, Tankyrase 1, controls telomere physiology via poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and inhibition of TRF-1, a negative regulator of telomere length (14Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). In our initial description of BAL-1, we noted homology between the BAL-1 C terminus and the Tankyrase 1 PARP-like catalytic domain (1Aguiar R.C. Yakushijin Y. Kharbanda S. Salgia R. Fletcher J.A. Shipp M.A. Blood. 2000; 96: 4328-4334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, BAL-1 did not exhibit PARP-like activity in preliminary functional assays. More recently, we identified additional BAL family members with potential critical differences in their C-terminal PARP-like regions. Given the emerging evidence that PARP family proteins represent possible cancer treatment targets (15Seimiya H. Muramatsu Y. Ohishi T. Tsuruo T. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 25-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 16Farmer H. McCabe N. Lord C.J. Tutt A.N. Johnson D.A. Richardson T.B. Santarosa M. Dillon K.J.

Nature. 2005; 434: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (3628) Google Scholar) and the reported association between BAL-1 expression and chemoresistance in DLBCL, we performed detailed structure/function analyses of BAL family members. Cloning and Chromosomal Localization of BAL2 and BAL3—BAL1 cDNA and protein sequences were used to search human nucleotide and protein databases (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST). Candidate homologue genes were further characterized by 5′-RACE-PCR and reverse transcription-PCR. For 5′-RACE-PCR, RNAs from normal mature B-cells and DLBCL cell lines were reverse-transcribed with a gene-specific primer (sequence available upon request) and submitted to successive rounds of nested amplification as previously described (18Aguiar R.C. Yakushijin Y. Kharbanda S. Tiwari S. Freeman G.J. Shipp M.A. Blood. 1999; 94: 2403-2413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm the RACE-PCR findings, cDNAs from normal mature B-cells and DLBCL cell lines were also used for reverse transcription-PCR with primers derived from the newly identified 5′ and 3′ sequences. To define the chromosomal location of BAL2 and BAL3, we initially searched the human genome data base with these gene sequences. To confirm these in-silica findings, we obtained a series of YAC (CEPH-Généthon, Paris, France) and BAC clones (BACPAC Resources Center, Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute, Oakland, California) with previously assigned chromosomal locations (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mapview). DNA from these clones was isolated, and PCR was performed as previously described (19Aguiar R.C. Chase A. Coulthard S. Macdonald D.H. Carapeti M. Reiter A. Sohal J. Lennard A. Goldman J.M. Cross N.C. Blood. 1997; 90: 3130-3135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analyses of BAL Family Sequences—The full-length N- or C-terminal domains of BAL1-related proteins were analyzed in detail for conservation of critical residues using the MegAlign™ 5.8 software package (DNAStar, Inc., Madison, WI). These alignments were also displayed as phylogenetic trees and sequence distance matrixes. Phylogenetic trees depict the evolutionary relationships predicted from the multiple sequence alignment where the length of each pair of branches represents the distance between sequence pairs. The distance matrix displays the divergence and percent identity values for each sequence pair in an alignment; divergence is calculated by comparing sequence pairs in relation to the phylogeny reconstructed by MegAlign™. Percent identity compares sequences directly without accounting for phylogenetic relationships. Note that divergence is not usually the inverse of percent identity (i.e. the sum of the percent identity and divergence values for a given pair is not usually 100). PARP Activity Assays—The putative C-terminal PARP catalytic domains of the BAL family proteins (BAL1 aa 590–854, BAL2B aa 1455–1638, BAL3 aa 448–673) were fused to GST and the recombinant proteins generated using the pGEX-4T3 expression system (Amersham Biosciences). Poly(ADP-ribose) activity assays were carried out as previously described (14Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar, 20Simonin F. Poch O. Delarue M. de Murcia G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8529-8535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions contained ≈2 μg of purified BAL proteins or 0.1 μg of high purity recombinant PARP protein (Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego CA) as a positive control. Reactions were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min in assay buffer (0.1 ml) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and with or without 200 ng of activated DNA (Sigma). In radioactive reactions 1.3 μm [32P]NAD+ (4 μCi; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used, whereas 0.1–1 mm concentrations of unlabeled NAD+ (Roche Applied Science) served as substrate in nonradioactive assays. In certain assays the PARP inhibitor, 3-aminobenzamide (3-ABA) (Calbiochem), was included at 1 mm final concentration. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 20% trichloroacetic acid. Precipitated proteins were rinsed once in 5% trichloroacetic acid, suspended in SDS loading buffer, and fractionated by SDS-PAGE. In radioactive reactions, proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue stain and exposed to autoradiography. For nonradioactive reactions, after size fractionation the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and immunoblotted with a polyclonal antibody to poly(ADP-ribose) (LP98–10, Alexis Biochemicals). Transcription Repression Assays—Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). For these experiments human embryonic kidney 293 cells were seeded on 6-well plates at 1 × 105 cells/well 1 day before transfection. Cells were triple-transfected (Effectene Transfection Reagent, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) with combinations of plasmid DNAs including 100 ng of the report plasmid (Gal4-TK-Luc), 100 ng of the specific effector plasmid, and 100 ng of pCMV-Beta (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) as previously described (6Perche P.Y.

The effector plasmids were generated by PCR and included the Gal4 DNA binding domain (DBD) fused to full-length BAL1 (aa 2–854), BAL1 N terminus complete, including the macro domains (aa 2–464), BAL1 N terminus proximal (aa 2–119), BAL3 full-length (aa 2–673), BAL3 macro domains (aa 58–454), and BAL3 PARP domain (aa 450–673). All these fragments were cloned in-frame with amino acids 1–147 of Gal4 protein in a pcDNA3 backbone. Gal4 DBD-HDAC5 (histone deacetylase domain of HDAC5) served as a positive control. The latter construct as well as the reporter plasmid were gifts of Saadi Kochbin (Grenoble, France) and were described previously (6Perche P.Y. Vourc'h C. Konecny L. Souchier C. Robert-Nicoud M. Dimitrov S. Khochbin S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1531-1534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). All constructs were verified by sequencing. Transfected cells were harvested after 24 h. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured using the luciferase assay system and β-galactosidase enzyme assay, respectively (Promega, Madison, WI). The β-galactosidase activity from pCMVBeta was used as control for transfection efficiency. All experiments were performed in triplicate. In dose-dependent experiments, the total amounts of plasmid DNA were kept constant by adding appropriate amounts of empty vectors. Western blot with an anti-Gal4 antibody indicated that all fusion proteins were expressed (data not shown). The BAL Gene Family Is Composed of Three Genes—We previously identified an additional highly conserved BAL1-like sequence, suggesting that BAL1 is a member of a larger gene family (1Aguiar R.C. Yakushijin Y. Kharbanda S. Salgia R. Fletcher J.A. Shipp M.A. Blood. 2000; 96: 4328-4334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For this reason, we used BAL1 cDNA and protein sequences to search human EST, nucleotide, and protein databases (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and identify two related genes termed BAL2 and BAL3 (Fig. 1). BAL2 corresponds to the partially characterized KIAA1268 sequence (Entrez GeneID 54625) (1Aguiar R.C. Yakushijin Y. Kharbanda S. Salgia R. Fletcher J.A. Shipp M.A. Blood. 2000; 96: 4328-4334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using 5′-RACE-PCR, we identified additional BAL2 5′ sequences, generating a ≈ 4.5-kilobase open reading frame that is 120 aa longer than the previously described N terminus (locus NM_017554, updated on December 2004). However, the extended BAL2 cDNA lacks an in-frame stop codon upstream of the most 5′ ATG, raising the possibility that BAL2 encodes a protein with additional N-terminal sequences. The existence of BAL2 rat and chicken orthologues with longer N termini supports this hypothesis (data not shown). Of interest, BAL2 includes three N-terminal macro domains (Fig. 1). In addition, we used 3′-RACE-PCR to fully characterize the 3′ end of BAL2 and identify 2 alternatively spliced transcripts that encode 33- or 154-aa unique C termini (BAL2A and BAL2B, respectively, Fig. 1; GenBank™ accession numbers DQ063585 and DQ063584). Whereas BAL2B encodes a protein containing a putative PARP catalytic domain, BAL2A lacks these sequences, suggesting that these C-terminal differences might be functionally relevant. In Northern blot analysis of multiple human tissues, we found similar patterns of BAL1 and BAL2 expression with the highest transcript levels in lymphocyte-rich tissues (spleen, lymph node, and peripheral blood leukocytes) and the lowest in total brain (data not shown and Ref. 1Aguiar R.C. Yakushijin Y. Kharbanda S. Salgia R. Fletcher J.A. Shipp M.A. Blood. 2000; 96: 4328-4334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An additional group of incompletely characterized BAL-like cDNA clones were identified that did not correspond to BAL2 (RefSeq accession NM_152615.1; mRNA for predicted protein FLJ40597, recently reassigned to Entrez GeneID 165631). Using reverse transcription-PCR, these sequences were organized into an open reading frame of ≈2025 nucleotides, which encoded a 656-amino acid protein termed BAL3 (Fig. 1) (GenBank™ accession number DQ063586). The BAL3 N terminus is substantially longer than that of the predicted protein encoded by GeneID 165631. However, there are still unidentified coding sequences at the 5′ end of BAL3, whereas cloning of 3′ BAL3 is complete. Using electronic resources (UniGene EST ProfileViewer and Gene Expression Omnibus, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo), the expression pattern of BAL3 in human tissues was found to be similar to that of BAL1 and BAL2 (data not shown). BAL1 was previously mapped to chromosome 3q21 (1Aguiar R.C. Yakushijin Y. Kharbanda S. Salgia R. Fletcher J.A. Shipp M.A. Blood. 2000; 96: 4328-4334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By searching the human genome data base with the BAL2 and -3 cDNA sequences, we found that these genes also mapped to chromosome band 3q21. In fact, the three genes are localized in tandem within ∼ 200 kilobases (contig, NT 005612), reinforcing the notion that they are functionally (and evolutionarily) related. These in-silica findings were confirmed by PCR amplification of BAC/YAC clones assigned to this chromosomal region (data not shown). BAL2 and BAL3, but Not BAL1, Exhibit PARP Activity—All three BAL family members have C termini that include sequences with partial identity to the PARP-1 catalytic domain (Fig. 1 and 2A). The putative PARP active site (the minimal PARP-1 fragment retaining catalytic activity) (9Ame J.C. Spenlehauer C. de Murcia G. BioEssays. 2004; 26: 882-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar) of BAL2B and BAL3 is ∼20% identical to that of the prototype enzyme, PARP-1, and ∼26% identical to that of another PARP family member, Tankyrase 1 (14Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). Of note, BAL2B and BAL3 are ∼72% identical at their PARP active site; these sequences also include the requisite catalytic glutamic acid residue (aa 1631 in BAL2B and 649 in BAL3) and additional highly conserved donor (NAD+) and acceptor (polymer binding) sites (Fig. 2A) (10Smith S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 174-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 21Augustin A. Spenlehauer C. Dumond H. Menissier-De Murcia J. Piel M. Schmit A.C. Apiou F.

In contrast, the BAL1 C terminus is only ≈14% identical with the PARP-1 catalytic domain; in addition, this BAL-1 sequence lacks the required catalytic glutamic acid (position 988 in PARP-1) and additional donor and acceptor sites conserved in BAL2B and -3 (Figs. 2, A and B). Further analyses of the divergence and evolutionary relationships between these PARP active sites indicate that the BAL1 sequence is more closely related to that of BAL2 and 3 than that of PARP-1 or Tankyrase 1 (Figs. 2, B and C). To determine whether any of the BAL family members exhibit PARP activity, we generated recombinant GST-tagged BAL1, BAL2B, and BAL3 C termini for use in PARP functional assays (8Allen M.D. Buckle A.M. Cordell S.C. Lowe J. Bycroft M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 13Tulin A. Spradling A. Science. 2003; 299: 560-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). In these experiments, recombinant PARP-1 was included as a positive control. We first measured the ability of these proteins to add radiolabeled ADP-ribose moieties to protein acceptors using [32P]NAD+ as a substrate. Coomassie Blue staining of the gel before exposure to x-ray film confirmed that comparable amounts of BAL1, 2B, and 3 were used in these assays (Fig. 3A, left panel). The C-terminal domains of BAL2B and BAL3, but not BAL1, were capable of auto(ADP-ribosyl)ation (Fig. 3A, right panel). Inclusion of the PARP-specific inhibitor, 3-ABA, markedly decreased the auto(ADP-ribosyl)ation of BAL2B and -3, confirming the specificity of these reactions (Fig. 3A, right panel). In similar reactions carried out with cold NAD+, auto(ADP-ribosyl)ated PARP-1, BAL2B and -3, but not BAL1, were also identified with an antisera directed against poly(ADP-ribose) (anti-PAR) (Fig. 3B). The observed auto(ADP-ribosyl)ation of BAL2B, BAL3, and PARP-1 was inhibited by 3-ABA, again confirming the specificity of the assay (Fig. 3B). Of interest, the PARP activity of BAL3 was DNA-independent; the absence of DNA in the reaction buffer did not change the extent of BAL3 auto poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, whereas it markedly decreased PARP-1 activity (Fig. 3C). The BAL Proteins Contain Multiple N-terminal Macro Domains —BAL1, -2 (isoforms A and B), and -3 include N-terminal sequences with partial homology to previously described macro domains (Figs. 1 and 4A). BAL1 and BAL3 sequences include two macro domains, whereas BAL2 A and B contain three similar regions (Figs. 1 and 4A). These seven macro domains are 26–37% identical to the consensus macro sequence (identified by reciprocal PSI-BLAST searches in multiple species and described as the A1pp domain (conserved domains data base, CDD www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=cdd) (Figs. 4, A and B). However, the percent identity among the BAL-derived macro domains varies from 18 to 61% (Fig. 4B). Analyses of the divergence and evolutionary relationships of BAL macro domains identify specific pairings and four separate subgroups (Figs. 4, B and C). As shown, the first (most N-terminal) macro domains of BAL1 and BAL2 form one cluster, the second macro domain of BAL2 and the first of BAL3 define another pair, and the third macro domain of BAL2 segregates with the second macro domain of BAL3 (Fig. 4C). Although it is most related to the latter pair, the second macro domain of BAL1 branches independently from the others (Fig. 4C). These patterns suggest that the individual macro domains within a given BAL protein might have subtle functional distinctions that are conserved in all three BAL proteins. The Macro Domain Superfamily—Analyses of the most recent human genome assemblies revealed the existence of at least five additional human genes encoding macro domain proteins (Figs. 4, A–C). Two of these genes are the well characterized and related histone macroH2A1 and macroH2A2. Histone macroH2A1 (H2AFY), the original member of this family (2Pehrson J.R. Fried V.A. Science. 1992; 257: 1398-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), is expressed as two functionally distinct alternatively spliced transcripts, macroH2A1.1 and 1.2 (H2AFY isoform 1 and 2). The more recently described histone macroH2A2 (H2AFY2) (24Costanzi C. Pehrson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21776-21784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 25Chadwick B.P. Willard H.F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1101-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) encodes a single protein that is more closely related to macroH2A1.2 (Fig. 4C). Much less is known about the other three human genes encoding single macro domain proteins, GDAP2, LRP16, and c20orf113. The first two, which are conserved from plants to high mammals, have been implicated in ganglioside-induced neural differentiation (GDAP2) (26Liu H. Nakagawa T. Kanematsu T. Uchida T. Tsuji S. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1781-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and increased proliferation of MCF-7 cells (LRP16) (27Han W.D. Mu Y.M. Lu X.C. Xu Z.M. Li X.J. Yu L. Song H.J. Li M. Lu J.M. Zhao Y.L. Pan C.Y. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2003; 10: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). c20orf113 (GeneID 170486) was cloned as part of a human cDNA sequencing project and does not yet have an ascribed function. In summary, there are 8 human genes encoding 9 proteins with 13 distinct macro domains. Additional structural and functional features, such as the presence of histone or PARP domains, delineate specific gene families (histone macroH2A and BAL). A third cluster, GDAP2, LRP16, and c20orf113, is defined by the evolutionary relationship of their respective macro domains (Fig. 4C). Of note, BAL family members are the only known genes with multiple macro domains in the same protein (Fig. 1). The BAL Proteins Mediate Transcription Repression; Role of the Macro Domains—Given the described association of the macro domain of histone macroH2A with transcriptional repression (6Perche P.Y. Vourc'h C. Konecny L. Souchier C. Robert-Nicoud M. Dimitrov S. Khochbin S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1531-1534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), we next assessed the possibility that the prototype BAL family member, BAL1, might have a similar function. Initially, we investigated the ability of BAL1 to repress transcription when tethered (via a Gal4 DNA binding domain) to the thymidine kinase (TK) promoter (Fig. 5A). This experimental approach, which is often used to characterize the repressive activity of chromatin-associated proteins, previously defined the repressive activities of the macro domain of histone macroH2A1 (6Perche P.Y.

A, schematic representation of the BAL1 and BAL3 proteins, effector plasmids, and luciferase reporter Gal4-TK-Luc. The indicated constructs were fused in-frame to the DBD of the transcription activator, Gal4. Gal4-DBD fused to the histone deacetylase domain of HDAC5 served as a positive control. The luciferase reporter plasmid contains five copies of the Gal4-binding site (5×Gal4) upstream from the TK core promoter (nucleotides 2105–152). B, dose-dependent transcription repression mediated by BAL1. As previously reported (28Wang A.H. Bertos N.R. Vezmar M. Pelletier N. Crosato M. Heng H.H. Th'ng J. Han J. Yang X.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7816-7827Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), Gal4DBD alone (100 ng) increased the activity of the TK promoter by ≈50%. Conversely, Gal4DBD-BAL1 decreased TK-driven transcription in a dose-dependent manner and at 100 ng, reduced luciferase to ∼40% of no effector base line or ∼ 30% of Gal4DBD alone. Results are shown as the luciferase activity normalized by β-galactosidase (±S.D.). C, domain mapping. The BAL1 N terminus proximal construct, which lacks the macro domains, had no effect on TK-driven luciferase activity. In contrast, the N-terminal construct including macro domains and the full-length BAL1 protein were equally effective in repressing transcription. D, analysis of BAL3 transcription repression. Gal4DBD-BAL3 full-length was significantly less effective than Gal4DBD-BAL1 full-length in repressing TK-driven transcription (p = 0.004), likely due to the PARP activity of BAL3. All the experiments were repeated at least three times and performed in triplicate.

https://openalex.org/W2050114809,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is important in embryonic development and tumorigenesis. Smad-interacting protein 1 (SIP1) can induce EMT by repressing the transcription of E-cadherin through recruitment of the corepressor C-terminal-binding protein (CtBP). How the activity of SIP1 is regulated still remains unclear. Here we show in vivo and in vitro that SIP1 is covalently modified by sumoylation at two conserved sites, Lys391 and Lys866. The polycomb protein Pc2, but not the PIAS (protein inhibitor of activated STAT) family proteins, acts as a Small ubiquitin-like modifier E3 ligase for SIP1. Sumoylation of SIP1 does not affect its subcellular localization, but regulates its transcriptional activity. Compared with the wild-type, a SIP1 sumoylation null mutant shows more potent repression on E-cadherin transcription but similar repression on two transforming growth factor-β-responsive reporter genes and comparable activation on vitamin D3 receptor transcription. Coexpression of SIP1 with Pc2 can partially relieve E-cadherin repression by SIP1. We further show that SIP1 sumoylation disrupts the recruitment of CtBP. Thus SIP1 sumoylation regulates its transcriptional activity in a promoter context-dependent manner and may represent an important intervention target to modulate EMT in tumorigenesis.

The epithelial cell-cell junction protein E-cadherin is a potent suppressor of tumor cell invasion and metastasis (1Cavallaro U. Schaffhauser B. Christofori G.

Down-regulation of E-cadherin is often accompanied by conversion from well organized epithelial cells into migratory, invasive, and fibroblast-like cells, an event collectively referred to as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). 2The abbreviations used are: EMTepithelial-mesenchymal transitionSIP1Smad-interacting protein 1SUMOSmall ubiquitin-like modifierTGF-βtransforming growth factor-βCtBPC-terminal-binding proteinHDAChistone deacetylasePIASprotein inhibitor of activated STATPIASyprotein inhibitor of activated STAT yPcGpolycomb groupPMLpromyelocytic leukemia proteinVD3Rvitamin D3 receptorMDCKMadin-Darby canine kidney cellsP/CAFp300/CBP-associated factorHAhemagglutininGSTglutathione S-transferaseE1ubiquitin-activating enzymeE2ubiquitin carrier proteinE3ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligaseSTATsignal transducers and activators of transcriptionCMVcytomegalovirusN-ZFN-terminal zink-fingerC-ZFC-terminal zinc-fingerCIDCtBP-interacting domainYFPyellow fluorescent proteinHDAC4histone deacetylase 4HDhomeodomain. 2The abbreviations used are: EMTepithelial-mesenchymal transitionSIP1Smad-interacting protein 1SUMOSmall ubiquitin-like modifierTGF-βtransforming growth factor-βCtBPC-terminal-binding proteinHDAChistone deacetylasePIASprotein inhibitor of activated STATPIASyprotein inhibitor of activated STAT yPcGpolycomb groupPMLpromyelocytic leukemia proteinVD3Rvitamin D3 receptorMDCKMadin-Darby canine kidney cellsP/CAFp300/CBP-associated factorHAhemagglutininGSTglutathione S-transferaseE1ubiquitin-activating enzymeE2ubiquitin carrier proteinE3ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligaseSTATsignal transducers and activators of transcriptionCMVcytomegalovirusN-ZFN-terminal zink-fingerC-ZFC-terminal zinc-fingerCIDCtBP-interacting domainYFPyellow fluorescent proteinHDAC4histone deacetylase 4HDhomeodomain. A typical EMT program comprises dissolution of tight junctions, modulation of adherent junctions, reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, loss of apical-basal polarity, and induction of mesenchymal gene expression (4Savagner P.

EMT is a highly conserved and fundamental process that governs morphogenesis in multicellular organisms (6Thiery J.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 442-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (5366) Google Scholar). Multiple signaling pathways, such as receptor tyrosine kinases, small GTPases, mitogen-activated protein kinases, integrin-linked kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), matrix-metalloproteinases, and extracellular matrix components, have been implicated in the regulation of EMT and tumor progression, but the cross-talk among these pathways and their downstream targets remains largely unknown (6Thiery J.P.

SIP1 plays a crucial role in normal embryonic development of neural structures and the neural crest (16Mowat D.R. Wilson M.J. Goossens M. J. Med. Genet. 2003; 40: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). SIP1 is a member of the zfh-1 family of two-handed zinc-finger transcription factors, which also includes δEF1 (17Remacle J.E.

They share the unique structure of two zinc-finger clusters separated by a homeodomain, where each of the zinc-finger clusters binds to an E-box element in the promoter region of target genes (17Remacle J.E.

Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6391-6396Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In addition to Smad-binding domains, zfh-1 family members also contain consensus binding motifs for the corepressor CtBP (19Furusawa T. Moribe H. Kondoh H. Higashi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8581-8590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6683-6688Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). SIP1 and δEF1 were both shown to be present in a CtBP corepressor core complex, which binds to the E-cadherin promoter and represses its transcription (21Shi Y. Sawada J.-i. Sui G. Affar E.B. Whetstine J.R. Lan F. Ogawa H. Po-Shan L uke M. Nakatani Y. Shi Y. Nature. 2003; 422: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). However, it seems that SIP1 might also be able to repress E-cadherin independent of CtBP binding (22van Grunsven L.A. Michiels C. Van de Putte T. Nelles L. Wuytens G. Verschueren K. Huylebroeck D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26135-26145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Besides E-cadherin, SIP1 and δEF1 have been shown to repress the transcription of many other genes depending on the cell types (23Postigo A.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2443-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). This includes suppression of interleukin 2, immunoglobulin μ heavy chain, CD4, GATA-3, and α4 integrin in hematopoietic cells; inhibition of p73 gene expression in mesenchymal cells, and repression of type I and type II collagen expression in osteoblasts. δEF1 can also activate the vitamin D3 receptor (VD3R) gene (24Lazarova D.L. Bordonaro M. Sartorelli A.C. Cell Growth & Differ. 2001; 12: 319-326PubMed Google Scholar) and ovalbumin (25Dillner N.B. Sanders M.M. Mol. Cell.

Recently, SIP1 and δEF1 were shown to exert opposing effects on TGF-β/Smad signaling through the recruitment of coactivators p300 and/or P/CAF and displacement of CtBP by δEF1 (23Postigo A.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2443-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 26Postigo A.A. Depp J.L. Taylor J.J. Kroll K.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2453-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Smad is the key signal transducer of TGF-β, which plays a pivotal role in multiple cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, apoptosis, and importantly tumorigenesis (27Siegel P.M. Massagué J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 807-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 by the ligand-activated transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors results in heteromeric complex formation with Smad4, and translocation into the nucleus, where transcription of target genes is regulated through direct DNA binding and/or the recruitment of transcriptional coactivators or corepressors (28Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Science. 2002; 296: 1646-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar, 29Dijke P.T. Hill C.S. Trends Biochem.

Sumoylation is a covalent modification that adds small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) to lysine residues. It occurs at a consensus motif ΨKX(D/E), where Ψ is a hydrophobic amino acid (31Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar, 32Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar). This modification involves the coordinated action of multiple enzymes, in a manner very similar to ubiquitination. These enzymes include E1 SUMO-activating enzyme (heterodimer of SAE1/SAE2), E2-conjugating enzyme Ubc9, and an E3 ligase, which promotes the transfer of SUMO from Ubc9 to specific proteins (31Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar, 32Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar).

Cell. 2003; 113: 127-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) have been identified as SUMO E3 ligases. Sumoylation is negatively regulated by multiple proteases, which remove SUMO from its substrates (38Melchior F. Schergaut M. Pichler A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 612-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Unlike ubiquitination, which signals proteins for degradation by the proteasome or enhances trafficking of transmembrane proteins for degradation in the lysosome, protein sumoylation has been shown to regulate a variety of activities, including protein stability, subcellular localization, transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, as well as genome integrity (31Hay R.T.

We have mapped the sumoylation sites to two conserved lysine residues, Lys391 and Lys866, in SIP1, and show that polycomb protein Pc2, acts as a SUMO E3 ligase for SIP1. Importantly, a sumoylation negative mutant of SIP1 shows more potent repression toward E-cadherin. We further show that Pc2-mediated sumoylation can partially relieve the E-cadherin repression by SIP1. Our results provide an example of how sumoylation regulates transcription in a promoter context-dependent manner. Constructs—Human SIP1 cDNA was amplified by PCR from clone pBluescript-KIAA0569 (kindly provided by T. Nagase), human δEF1 cDNA was assembled through PCR from two overlapping expressed sequence tag clones (National Institutes of Health Image clones 4245215 and 6180372, Open Biosystems). Myc (six copies), HA, FLAG, GFP, GAL4-tagged SIP1, and δEF1 were constructed by subcloning the cDNAs into pCS3–6Myc, pcDNA3.1-HA, pCMV5-FLAG, pEGFP-C2 (BD Biosciences), and pSG424, respectively. YFP-SIP1 was constructed by first replacing SUMO1 coding region in YFP-SUMO1 (41Weger S. Hammer E. Engstler M. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 290: 13-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and then transferring the YFP-SIP1 fusion region into pCMV5. Myc-tagged SIP1 deletion mutants were constructed by restriction enzymes digestion. SIP1 domains were subcloned into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) to generate GST fusion proteins for use in GST pull-down assays. One or more different SIP1 and δEF1 sumoylation sites mutants, as well as the CtBP-binding mutant of SIP1 (where four consensus motifs were simultaneously mutated as previously (22van Grunsven L.A.

HeLa, HEK293T, COS-1, Mv1Lu/L17 (mink-lung epithelial cells), and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Transient transfections were performed using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Immunoprecipitations were usually carried out as previously described (44Long J. Wang G. Matsuura I. He D. Liu F. Proc. Natl.

FLAG-SIP1-bound proteins were purified from FLAG-SIP1-transfected 293T cells by anti-FLAG-M2 affinity gel (Sigma) and eluted with 150 μg/ml 3×FLAG peptide (Sigma). In Vivo Sumoylation Assay—In vivo sumoylation assay of SIP1 was carried out the same as previously described (43Long J. Wang G. He D. Liu F. Biochem.

The lysis buffer is a 3:1 mixture of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% sodium azide) and SDS sample buffer (5% SDS, 0.15 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 30% glycerol), plus 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, protease inhibitors, and phosphatase inhibitors. Cells were then sonicated briefly and boiled for 10 min. The clear lysates from centrifugation were separated on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted against appropriate primary antibody (anti-Myc or anti-HA). To confirm the in vivo sumoylation, lysates were diluted 10-fold into phosphate-buffered saline/0.5% Nonidet P-40 and immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody followed by immunoblot with anti-FLAG antibody. In Vitro Sumoylation Assay—The 35S-labeled, Myc-tagged wild-type, and mutant SIP1 were synthesized by in vitro translation using the SP6 TnT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega). Purification of GST-SUMO1 (48Tatham M.H. Jaffray E. Vaughan O.A. Desterro J.M.P. Botting C.H. Naismith J.H. Hay R.T. J. Biol.

Wang G. He D. Liu F. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Alternatively, 35S-labeled Myc-SIP1 was incubated with an in vitro sumoylation control kit (LAE Biotech, Rockville, MD), in the absence or presence of increasing amount of bacterially purified His-Pc2 protein (AmProx, Carlsbad, CA). Reaction products were separated on 4–10% gradient gel and analyzed by autoradiography. GST Pull-down Assay—N-terminal and C-terminal zinc-finger clusters (N-terminal, 90–383; C-terminal, 957–1156), and the middle region (384–956) were expressed as GST fusion protein in Escherichia coli together with empty vector. GST proteins were purified from glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). Beads with 1 μg of GST proteins were mixed with 1 μg of His-Pc2 protein (AmProx) in phosphate-buffered saline/0.5% Nonidet P-40 buffer and subjected to the pull-down assay (44Long J. Wang G. Matsuura I. He D. Liu F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). SIP1-bound Pc2 were detected by anti-His antibody. Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay—293T, Mv1Lu/L17, and COS-1 cells in 12 well plates were transfected by Lipofectamine. Human E-cadherin-luc (-1008/+49) (49Tsai C.-N. Tsai C.-L. Tse K.-P. Chang H.-Y.

Bordonaro M. Sartorelli A.C. Cell Growth & Differ. 2001; 12: 319-326PubMed Google Scholar) was used to compare Myc-SIP1 and its sumoylation mutant together with Myc-δEF1, for their transactivation ability on VD3R in COS-1 cells. Luciferase activities were normalized with cotransfected β-galactosidase control driven by pSV-β-gal (Promega). Data presented are means ± S.D. from at least three independent experiments. Confocal Immunofluorescence Microscopy—COS-1, HeLa, 293T, or MDCK cells grown on coverslips in 24-well plates were transfected with plasmids to be tested by Lipofectamine. 40 h post transfection, cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and analyzed by direct or indirect immunofluorescence microscopy in a LSM510 confocal system (Zeiss). SIP1 Is Modified by Sumoylation—To gain insight into the regulation of the EMT process, we have focused on post-translational regulation of one of the key mediators of EMT, SIP1. Sequence inspection revealed that SIP1 and δEF1 sequences contain multiple ΨKX(D/E) consensus motifs, so we asked whether SIP1 and δEF1 can be modified by sumoylation. To address this, we first generated mammalian expression constructs for SIP1 and δEF1. As previously observed for δEF1 (51Funahashi J. Sekido R. Murai K. Kamachi Y. Kondoh H. Development. 1993; 119: 433-446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), both SIP1 and δEF1 had apparent molecular masses higher than calculated (170 kDa for Myc-SIP1 and 190 kDa for Myc-δEF1, Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 3). To test for in vivo sumoylation, COS-1 cells were transfected with Myc-SIP1 and Myc-δEF1, together with FLAG-SUMO1 (Fig. 1A). As a control for sumoylation, we included Smad4, a key mediator of TGF-β signaling, which is modified by sumoylation at Lys-159 and Lys-113 (Fig. 1A, lanes 6 and 7) (43Long J. Wang G. He D. Liu F. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 52Lee P.S.W. Chang C. Liu D. Derynck R. J. Biol.

Cotransfection of FLAG-SUMO1 with Myc-SIP1 or Myc-δEF1 led to slower migrating bands of 230 and 220 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–2 and 4–5). The slower migrating band of SIP1 was further “shifted” when a 2FLAG-SUMO1 construct was transfected (lane 3), confirming that the 230-kDa band of SIP1 is a SUMO conjugate. These results suggest that SIP1, as well as its homologue δEF1, is subjected to sumoylation, the size difference being consistent with the addition of two or three SUMO molecules. SIP1 Sumoylation Sites Localize to the Repression Domain—To systematically map the sumoylation sites in SIP1, we generated several deletion mutants and tested their in vivo sumoylation to delineate domains of SIP1 required for sumoylation. SIP1 is a member of the two-handed zinc-finger transcription factor family, and has N- and C-terminal zinc-finger clusters, N-ZF and C-ZF, separated by a central homeodomain (HD), a Smad-binding domain, and CtBP-interacting domains (CIDs) (see Fig. 1B for details). Deletion of the N-terminal 303 amino acids failed to affect sumoylation (Fig. 1B, dm1, lane 3), whereas a protein with an N-terminal deletion of 413 residues showed a significant decrease in sumoylation (dm2, lane 4), suggesting that the region between N-ZF and the Smad-binding domain (303–413) regulates or contains the major sumoylation sites. Interestingly, we found that the N-terminal 266 amino acids are necessary but not sufficient for efficient sumoylation of deletion mutants. This domain can promote the sumoylation of dm3, which alone showed very little sumoylation potential (lanes 6 versus 5). However the N-terminal 266 amino acids failed to rescue the modification of the C-ZF mutant (975–1214, dm7, lane 8). We speculate that the N-terminal 266 residues may serve as an adaptor to recruit components of the sumoylation machinery (E2-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 and/or E3 ligase) to dm3, which harbors sumoylation site(s). The different sumoylation potential of dm"

How these two signals cooperate to control cell growth and death, however, remains unclear and debated. Here we provide the first linkage by the identification of Forkhead transcription factor FOXO3a, the PI3K/Akt downstream substrate, as a positive regulator for the induction of AR gene expression. Both Western blot and real time PCR assays demonstrate that FOXO3a can induce AR expression at the protein and mRNA levels, and gel shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays further demonstrate that FOXO3a can induce 5′ AR promoter activity via binding to the consensus DNA-binding sequence in the AR 5′ promoter -1290 to -1297 (5′-TTGTTTCA-3′). Under normal growth conditions, blocking PI3K/Akt signals by LY294002 causes LNCaP cell arrest in G1 phase rather than apoptosis. However, further blocking of AR functions by AR small interfering RNA leads to dramatic LNCaP cell death, suggesting that AR may play important protective roles when the PI3K/Akt signal pathway is blocked by LY294002.

The AR is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that is composed of a variable NH2-terminal domain, a highly conserved DNA-binding domain, a hinge domain, and a ligand-binding domain. Although the functional significance of the androgen-AR signaling pathway in PCa progression is well studied, regulation of AR gene expression and its potential linkage to PCa progression remains largely unknown. The FOXO subfamily of Forkhead transcription factors, FOXO1 (FKHR), FOXO3a (FKHRL1), and FOXO4 (AFX), is regulated by the PI3K/Akt pathway. Direct phosphorylation of FOXO proteins by Akt results in cytoplasmic retention and the inactivation of FOXOs, inhibiting the expression of FOXO-regulated genes, which control diverse functions, including cell differentiation, proliferation, cell death, metabolism, and longevity (5Accili D. Arden K.C. Cell. 2004; 117: 421-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). In tumor cells, in vitro studies found that the induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest by FOXOs through regulating target genes like p27KIP, cyclin D, FasL, and BIM depends on cell types and physiological conditions (6Birkenkamp K.U. Coffer P.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 292-297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Burgering B.M. Kops G.J. Trends Biochem.

A study found that FOXO3a induces apoptosis in LAPC4 prostate cancer cells via the up-regulation of its direct target tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) (8Modur V. Nagarajan R. Evers B.M. Milbrandt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47928-47937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Also, FOXOs play a complex role in tumorigenesis (7Burgering B.M. Kops G.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 352-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). In tumor cells Akt is often constitutively activated either through deletions or mutations in phosphatase and tensin homologue on chromosome 10 (PTEN) or through the activity of autocrine growth factors (6Birkenkamp K.U. Coffer P.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 292-297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, in prostate cancer LNCaP cells the loss of PTEN activity results in constitutively active Akt and leads to the inactivation of FOXO factors. In the present study, we demonstrated that activated FOXO3a could enhance AR gene expression and AR transactivation via binding to the AR 5′ promoter region. This suggests that inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway, the dominant survival factor in prostate cancer LNCaP cells, may result in the activation of the FOXO3a transcription factor, which may then induce the AR gene expression to protect cells from apoptosis caused by inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathway. This important finding implies that inhibition of both PI3K/Akt and AR signaling may become a powerful approach to treat the prostate cancer.

U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7200-7205Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody was from Sigma, and anti-FKHRL1(FOXO3a) (number 06951) was from the Upstate Group. The anti-phospho-FOXO3a, and the alkaline phosphatase-conjugated or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The AR small interfering RNA (siRNA) expression vector was constructed as described previously (12Yeh S. Hu Y.-C. Wang P.-H. Xie C. Xu Q. Tsai M.-Y. Dong Z. Wang R.-S. Lee T.-H. Chang C. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1899-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfections—The AR-positive human prostate cancer LNCaP cells with a passage number less than 35 for all the experiments were purchased from ATCC. LNCaP cells and CWR22R cells (a gift from Dr. C. Kao) were maintained in 10% FBS, RPMI 1640. Transfection was performed by using either SuperFect™ (Qiagen) or electroporation (Bio-Rad, gene pulser). For electroporation, the voltage setting was 280 V and capacitance 950 microfarads; the sample volumes were 400 μl, and the total DNA amounts were 10 μg. Luciferase Reporter Assays—The cells were transfected with plasmids in 10% CD-FBS media for 16 h and then treated with ethanol or 10 nm DHT for 24 h, or without any treatment if the cells were cultured in normal medium. After washing with PBS and harvesting, the cell lysates were prepared and used for luciferase assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). The results were obtained from at least three sets of transfection and are presented as the mean ± S.D. Immunofluorescence and Microscopy—Briefly, LNCaP cells were plated on slide chambers, incubated overnight, transfected with FOXO3a-WT and FOXO3a-TM for 24 h, and then treated with 20 μm LY294002 or EtOH for another 24 h. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and permeabilized with 100% methanol for 15 min at 4 °C. The slides were rinsed with PBS twice and incubated in 5% BSA for 30 min. The primary antibody against FOXO3a was added for 1 h. The secondary antibodies were added for 1 h, followed by application of the counter medium containing 4′,6-diaminodino-2-phenylindole. Slides were examined by microscope. A FITC-conjugating anti-rabbit antibody was used as secondary antibody. Northern Blot Analysis—LNCaP cells were cultured following the methods described previously and treated with or without 10 nm DHT for 24 h. Total RNA was isolated, and Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (10Yang L. Lin H.K. Altuwaijri S. Xie S. Wang L. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16820-16827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts and EMSA were carried out as described previously (13Wang H. Yang L. Jamaluddin M.S. Boyd D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22674-22683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear extract proteins were prepared from EtOH or 20 μm LY29400-treated LNCaP cells, and 8 μg of nuclear extract protein was incubated in a reaction solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl/pH 7.9, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC). After 20 min, the 32P-end-labeled duplex oligonucleotide (2 × 104 cpm) was added, and the reaction was incubated for another 20 min in ice. For antibody supershift analysis, 2 μg of anti-FOXO3a antibody (Upstate Group) or normal rabbit IgG was added to the reaction mixtures and preincubated in ice for 20 min. The sequence of the probes used is 5′-GAACAAATTATGTCCTTGTTTCAGCCTGTTCATCT-3′. RNA Interference—The pSuperior.retro.puro vector (OligoEngine) was used for the expression of siRNA in LNCaP cells. FOXO3a siRNA vector was generated by a gene-specific insert (GTGGAGCTGGACCCGGAGT) to target FOXO3a. A scrambled control vector was constructed using an insert (GTGTCTGTAGGAGTCATCC) with no significant homology to any mammalian gene sequence. Detection of Apoptosis and Cell Cycle Using Flow Cytometry Assay—LNCaP cells grown in 100-mm dishes were treated with either ethanol or 20 μm LY294002 for 24 h, or transfected with AR siRNA or empty vector, and then treated with either ethanol or 20 μm LY294002 for 24 h. The cells were digested with trypsin/EDTA. Approximately 1 × 106 cells were fixed by 70% EtOH overnight at 4 °C, harvested, and then stained with propidium iodine for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were washed twice with PBS, and the fluorescence of cells was measured by flow cytometry as reported previously (14Ni J. Chen M. Zhang Y. Li R. Huang J. Yeh S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 357Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay (ChIP)—The ChIP assays were performed essentially as described previously (13Wang H. Yang L. Jamaluddin M.S. Boyd D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22674-22683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) but with some modifications. Cell lysates were precleared sequentially with normal rabbit IgG (sc-2027, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and protein A-agarose. Anti-FOXO3a antibody (2.0 μg) was added to the lysate and incubated at 4 °C overnight. For the negative control, no antibody was added in the sample. The following primer pairs, which span the region -1412 to -1181 of the AR promoter, were used for the amplification of PCR product (including real time PCR): forward primer, 5′-AGCCTTTCCCAAATGACAATG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GCACAGCCAAACATCATAGG-3′. Real Time PCR Analysis—For AR expression assay, total RNAs from 5 × 106 LNCaP cells that were transfected with 10 mg of FOXO3a-WT, FOXO3a-TM, or empty vector were isolated for 24 h after transfection by using TRIzol following the manufacturer's protocol. 5 mg of RNA were reverse-transcribed by Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was subjected to real time PCR using the SYBR Green PCR Reagents kit (Bio-Rad). Experiments were performed in triplicate for each data point. PCR primers were as follows: AR forward, 5′-CCTGGCTTCCGCAACTTACAC-3′; AR reverse, 5′-GGACTTGTGCATGCGGTACTCA-3′. For the ChIP assay, real time PCR was performed essentially as described previously (13Wang H. Yang L. Jamaluddin M.S. Boyd D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22674-22683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The same primer pair used for the conventional PCR was used for real time PCR. Blockade of PI3K/Akt Enhances AR Expression and AR Transactivation—Early reports indicated that PI3K/Akt and AR may cooperate with each other to promote prostate cancer cell survival and growth. For example, AR transactivation can be induced by LY294002, a selective PI3K inhibitor, to play a dominant role in cell proliferation to compensate for the loss of PI3K/Akt signaling (9Yang L. Wang L. Lin H.K. Kan P.Y. Xie S. Tsai M.Y. Wang P.H. Chen Y.T. Chang C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 10Yang L. Lin H.K. Altuwaijri S. Xie S. Wang L. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16820-16827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 11Lin H.K. Yeh S. Kang H.Y. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7200-7205Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 15Xie S. Lin H.K. Ni J. Yang L. Wang L. di Sant'Agnese P.A. Chang C. Prostate. 2004; 60: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Here we further demonstrate that addition of LY294002 in LNCaP cells results in the increase of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) mRNA expression with DHT treatment (Fig. 1A). PSA is an androgen-induced target gene that has been used as a marker to monitor the progress of prostate cancer. This increase suggests that blockade of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway will enhance AR transactivation. To dissect the potential mechanism of how PI3K/Akt modulates AR transactivation, we treated LNCaP cells with LY294002 and applied Western blot analyses to detect the protein level of phosphorylated Akt (pAkt), PSA, and AR. As shown in Fig. 1B, pAkt was inhibited by LY294002 treatment, but PSA and AR protein levels were increased significantly, suggesting that blockade of PI3K/Akt pathway may enhance AR transactivation via the increase of AR protein expression. FOXO3a-TM Enhances AR Expression at the mRNA and Protein Levels—In our previous report we demonstrated that overexpression of Akt is able to phosphorylate AR and cause AR ubiquitination and degradation (16Lin H.-K. Wang L. Hu Y.-C. Altuwaijri S. Chang C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4037-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). However, this does not rule out the possibility that additional mechanisms exist between Akt and AR when the PI3K/Akt pathway is inhibited. To find out how inhibition of PI3K/Akt increases AR protein expression, we hypothesized that PI3K/Akt might also go through its downstream target gene(s) to modulate AR gene expression. The FOXO family of Forkhead factors, FOXO1, FOXO3a, and FOXO4, are direct downstream targets for Akt, and phosphorylation of the FOXO by Akt can result in the cytoplasmic retention with inactivation (7Burgering B.M. Kops G.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 352-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Early studies also showed LNCaP cells express these FOXO factors with the FOXO3a as the predominant one (8Modur V. Nagarajan R. Evers B.M. Milbrandt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47928-47937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In LNCaP cells, Akt is constitutively active, resulting in FOXO3a being constitutively phosphorylated and inactivated (6Birkenkamp K.U. Coffer P.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 292-297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kau T.R. Schroeder F. Ramaswamy S. Wojciechowski C.L. Zhao J.J. Roberts T.M. Clardy J. Sellers W.R. Silver P.A. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 463-476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). FOXO3a-TM is a constitutively active form of FOXO3a, with all three Akt phosphorylation sites (Thr-32, Ser-252, and Ser-314) mutated to alanine. Here we first transfected LNCaP cells with FOXO3a-WT or FOXO3a-TM and assayed for their influence on AR expression. As shown in Fig. 2A, FOXO3a-TM was located in the nucleus and FOXO3a-WT in the cytosol. Treatment with LY294002 caused FOXO3a-WT to translocate from the cytosol into the nucleus. Next we tested the effects of FOXO3a on AR expression. As shown in Fig. 2, B and C, both AR protein expression (by Western blot analysis) and AR mRNA expression (by real time PCR quantitation) were enhanced by transfected FOXO3a-TM, but not FOXO3a-WT, suggesting that the Akt downstream target FOXO3a might be able to modulate AR expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. The expression and phosphorylation of FOXO3a are shown by Western blot analysis in Fig. 2D. FOXO3a-TM Enhances AR Expression at the Transcriptional Level via Binding to the AR 5′ Promoter Region—A 3.6-kb AR 5′ promoter linked to a luciferase reporter was then used to test the potential influence of FOXO3a-TM on AR expression at the transcriptional level. As shown in Fig. 3A, in LNCaP cells, FOXO3a-TM, but not FOXO3a-WT, significantly enhanced AR 5′ promoter activity. Moreover, LY294002 treatment further enhanced AR 5′ promoter activity with or without transfection of FOXO3a-WT. To test if the enhanced AR expression by FOXO3a-TM also resulted in the enhancement of AR transactivation, we assayed its potential effects on ARE reporter activity. As shown in Fig. 3B, lower panel, FOXO3a-TM, but not FOXO3a-WT, enhanced AR transactivation by increasing the ARE reporter activity in LNCaP cells. Similarly enhanced effects were also observed, as shown in Fig. 3B, upper panel, when we replaced LNCaP cells with CWR22R, another prostate cancer cell line with active Akt (18Godoy-Tundidor S. Cavarretta I.T. Fuchs D. Fiechtl M. Steiner H. Friedbichler K. Bartsch G. Hobisch A. Culig Z. Prostate. 2005; 64: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although FOXO3a induces AR expression and enhances AR transactivation, it is still not clear whether FOXO3a is necessary for the LY294002-mediated effect on AR expression and transcription regulation. We constructed a FOXO3a siRNA plasmid and found it inhibited endogenous FOXO3a expression efficiently in LNCaP cells (Fig. 3C). However, LY294002 treated LNCaP cells, which had been transfected with FOXO3a-siRNA, still showed slightly increased expression of AR (Fig. 3D), indicating that FOXO3a is not the only mechanism for LY294002-mediated AR expression and activity. Previously we reported that Akt can phosphorylate AR to induce AR degradation. The inhibition of Akt stabilizes the AR protein (16Lin H.-K. Wang L. Hu Y.-C. Altuwaijri S. Chang C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4037-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Therefore, other mechanisms, such as AR stability, may contribute to the observation that knocking down FOXO3a cannot completely abolish the LY294002 effect on AR expression. Sequence analysis of the AR 5′ promoter region found that it contains one putative FOXO3a consensus binding site, which is -1290 to -1297 (5′-TTGTTTCA-3′). We first performed EMSA to determine the DNA binding capacity of FOXO3a. The 35-bp double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide probe was added to nuclear extracts from LNCaP cells treated with either 20 μm LY294002 or vehicle. As shown in Fig. 4A, LNCaP cell nuclear extracts were generated and subjected to EMSA by using a probe encompassing the consensus FOXO3a binding site region mentioned above. Nuclear extracts from the vehicle or LY294002-treated cells yielded a slowly migrating band (as indicated by protein-DNA complex from Fig. 4A, lanes 2-5). Conversely, inclusion of an anti-FOXO3a antibody that results in a supershift band confirmed that this band was FOXO3a (Fig. 4A, lane 4). Thus, our in vitro data suggested that FOXO3a bound to the AR promoter. FOXO3a antibody did not completely abolish the DNA-protein complex, and the vehicle-treated nuclear extracts also showed the existence of a protein-DNA binding complex, suggesting other trans-factors may also bind to this region. Because the chromatin environment modulates transcription factor binding, an issue that cannot be addressed by EMSA, ChIP assays were undertaken to determine whether FOXO3a was bound to the endogenous AR promoter when PI3K/Akt was blocked. LNCaP cells were treated with 20 μm LY294002 for 24 h. DNA-protein complexes in the LNCaP cells were cross-linked in situ, and the chromatin was isolated and sheared. Subsequently, the chromatin was immunoprecipitated with the anti-FOXO3a antibody, and the DNA was purified and subjected to real time PCR for quantification using AR promoter-specific primers. As shown in Fig. 4B, this primer set specifically amplified a fragment of the predicted size. By using quantitative real time PCR, we found that the anti-FOXO3a antibody caused more than 3-fold up-regulation (Fig. 4C), suggesting that this transcription factor indeed is bound in vivo to the regulatory portion of the AR gene. A single amplification product was evident in the melting curve following the real time PCR, again confirming specificity of the assay for the AR promoter. Taken together, these findings suggest that LY294002 treatment caused the recruitment of FOXO3a to the AR promoter consensus sites, suggesting FOXO3a induces AR expression by binding directly to the AR promoter region. Figs. 3 and 4 both demonstrated that the Akt downstream target substrate, FOXO3a, is able to enhance AR expression at the transcriptional level via binding to the AR 5′ promoter region at a specific DNA binding consensus site. AR Plays Important Roles in LY294002-induced LNCaP Cell Apoptosis—What are the potential consequences after the Akt down-stream target substrate, FOXO3a, exerts its effects on the increase of AR expression and AR transactivation? One possibility is that induced AR expression and AR transactivation might be able to protect LNCaP cells from apoptosis because of the loss of PI3K/Akt activity. Early reports showed that the PI3K/Akt pathway was a dominant survival factor in LNCaP cells (19Lin J. Adam R.M. Santiestevan E. Freeman M.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2891-2897PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of PI3K activity by LY294002 would lead to the induction of apoptosis in androgen-deprived LNCaP cells, but the addition of androgen would rescue the cells from LY294002-induced apoptosis. It is therefore conceivable that the inhibition of PI3K/Akt by LY294002 might lead to the induction of apoptosis as well as the activation of the Akt downstream target, FOXO3a. The activated, nonphosphorylated form of FOXO3a would then translocate into the nucleus and be able to bind to the AR 5′ promoter, to enhance AR expression and AR transactivation after the cells were supplied with androgens. This could be one of the reasons that the addition of androgen can rescue LY294002-induced apoptosis. To test the above hypothesis, assuming AR can play protective roles in LNCaP cell apoptosis (20Altuwaijri S. Lin H.-K. Chuang K.-H. Lin W.-J. Yeh S. Hanchett L.A. Rahman M.M. Kang H.-Y. Tsai M.-Y. Zhang Y. Yang L. Chang C. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7106-7112PubMed Google Scholar), we applied RNA interference strategy to reduce AR protein amounts, and we examined the subsequent effects on the LY294002-induced cell apoptosis. AR siRNA plasmid was constructed previously (12Yeh S. Hu Y.-C. Wang P.-H. Xie C. Xu Q. Tsai M.-Y. Dong Z. Wang R.-S. Lee T.-H. Chang C. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1899-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5A, Western blot analysis showed that AR siRNA significantly suppressed AR protein expression. By using flow cytometric assay with propidium iodide staining (Fig. 5B), we found that under normal growth medium culture conditions, the addition of LY294002 leads to cell arrest but not to cell death. It was shown that LY294002 increased cell G1 arrest from 56.3 (EtOH treatment control) to 88.0% (Fig. 5C). Most interestingly, knocking down AR by siRNA caused 51.0% of the cells to enter sub-G1 phase, and also caused an increase in G2 arrest in the remaining cells. Co-transfection of AR siRNA plus LY294002 treatment further induced cell apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 5D, 65.7% of cells under-went apoptosis, suggesting that AR existence in the cells plays an important protective role for LY294002-induced cell apoptosis. Although the relationship between AR and Akt remains controversial, a variety of mechanisms has been suggested to account for how Akt influences AR signaling pathways. These include the following: 1) Akt directly interacts with AR and then suppresses AR activity (9Yang L. Wang L. Lin H.K. Kan P.Y. Xie S. Tsai M.Y. Wang P.H. Chen Y.T. Chang C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 10Yang L. Lin H.K. Altuwaijri S. Xie S. Wang L. Chang C. J. Biol.

Palvimo J.J. 84th Annual Meeting of the Endocrine Society. 2002; (San Francisco, CA, June 19-22, 2002, The Endocrine Society, Chevy Chase, MD)Google Scholar); 2) Akt directly interacts with AR and then enhances AR activity in a ligand-independent manner (22Wen Y. Hu M.C. Makino K. Spohn B. Bartholomeusz G. Yan D.H. Hung M.C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6841-6845PubMed Google Scholar); 3) Akt indirectly enhances AR transactivation via the inhibition of GSK3β, the downstream substrate of PI3K/Akt, protein kinase A, and mitogen-activated protein kinase; GSK3β was found to suppress directly AR transactivation (23Wang L. Lin H.-K. Hu Y.-C. Xie S. Yang L. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32444-32452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar); and 4) Akt indirectly enhances AR transactivation by inhibiting GSK3β to positively regulate β-catenin (24Sharma M. Chuang W.W. Sun Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30935-30941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). β-Catenin has been reported as a ligand-dependent AR co-activator (25Truica C.I. Byers S. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4709-4713PubMed Google Scholar). With different ligand requirements to influence AR activity, GSK3β and β-catenin may cooperate but also may act independently to modulate AR activity at different levels (23Wang L. Lin H.-K. Hu Y.-C. Xie S. Yang L. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32444-32452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). How Akt influences AR may depend on cell physiological conditions. Recently, we found Akt either suppresses or enhances AR activity, depending on the LNCaP cell passage number (26Lin H.-K. Hu Y.-C. Yang L. Altuwaijri S. Chen Y.-T. Kang H.-Y. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50902-50907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In this study, by using LNCaP cells with a passage number less than 35 for all the experiments, we confirmed that the PI3K/Akt inhibitor, LY294002, strongly enhanced AR expression and activity. It is unlikely that GSK3β and β-catenin play the dominant role; otherwise, LY394002 should reduce AR expression. In addition to our finding that Akt can directly suppress AR function, our current studies suggest that FOXO3a, a substrate of Akt, might be one of the mediators linking PI3K/Akt and AR. The FOXO3a binding consensus sequence has been reported as TTGTTTAC (27Furuyama T. Nakazawa T. Nakano I. Mori N. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, we found that the AR promoter contains a putative FOXO3a-responsive element located from -1290 to -1297 (5′-TTGTTTCA-3′). In this study, both EMSA and ChIP assays demonstrated that FOXO3a could directly bind to the AR promoter through this consensus sequence. This finding strongly supports our hypothesis that PI3K/Akt can communicate with AR via FOXO3a. LNCaP is a PTEN-null prostate cancer cell line that contains constitutively active Akt. Accordingly, FOXO3a could be constitutively phosphorylated and inactivated as a result of PI3K/Akt signaling (6Birkenkamp K.U. Coffer P.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 292-297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kau T.R. Schroeder F. Ramaswamy S. Wojciechowski C.L. Zhao J.J. Roberts T.M. Clardy J. Sellers W.R. Silver P.A. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 463-476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). PI3K/Akt has been reported as a dominant growth factor-activated cell survival pathway in LNCaP cells (19Lin J. Adam R.M. Santiestevan E. Freeman M.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2891-2897PubMed Google Scholar). It is suggested that the inhibition of PI3K/Akt should result in cell apoptosis. Indeed, under serum-free medium culture conditions, LY294002 induced LNCaP cell apoptosis (19Lin J. Adam R.M. Santiestevan E. Freeman M.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2891-2897PubMed Google Scholar). However, androgen can rescue LNCaP from LY294002-induced apoptosis (19Lin J. Adam R.M. Santiestevan E. Freeman M.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2891-2897PubMed Google Scholar, 28Torring N. Dagnaes-Hansen F. Sorensen B.S. Nexo E. Hynes N.E. Prostate. 2003; 56: 142-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Here we found that AR plays a critical role for this protection. Knocking down AR expression by AR siRNA caused LNCaP cell death, and the blocking of the PI3K/Akt pathway together with knocking down AR expression further induced LNCaP cell apoptosis. Based on our findings, we provide a model to interpret how PI3K/Akt communicates with AR (Fig. 6). Under normal conditions, Akt is constitutively activated in LNCaP cells, which leads to the phosphorylation and inactivation of FOXO3a. When PI3K/Akt is inhibited by LY294002, FOXO3a translocates into the nucleus and binds to the AR promoter and then induces AR gene expression to protect LNCaP cells from apoptosis. However, we cannot rule out other possible mechanisms; for example, it has been reported that AR may form a complex with FOXO1, another Forkhead transcription factor, to inhibit FOXO1 DNA binding ability, resulting in the repression of FOXO1-induced genes expression to protect cell from apoptosis (29Li P. Lee H. Guo S. Unterman T.G. Jenster G. Bai W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 104-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Several recent reports also correlated the relationship between Akt and AR signaling in prostate cancer. The phosphorylated form of Akt is predominantly expressed in prostate cancer tissue, and almost no expression is in non-neoplastic tissues of the patients (30Ayala G. Thompson T. Yang G. Frolov A. Li R. Scardino P. Ohori M. Wheeler T. Harper W. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 6572-6578Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Moreover, the phosphorylated forms of Akt levels are significantly higher in patients with a high Gleason score of 8 and above than with the other grades of prostate cancer (31Malik S.N. Brattain M. Ghosh P.M. Troyer D.A. Prihoda T. Bedolla R. Kreisberg J.I. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 1168-1171PubMed Google Scholar). Meanwhile, the majority of androgen-independent prostate cancers still express functional AR (1Feldman B.J. Feldman D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 34-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (1976) Google Scholar), which remains crucial for prostate cancer cell survival, even at the hormone refractory stage after androgen deprivation (33Zegarra-Moro O.L. Schmidt L.J. Huang H. Tindall D.J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1008-1013PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that in a rat prostate cancer model, increased phospho-Akt is associated with loss of AR during the progression of prostate carcinogenesis induced with N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (34Liao Z. Wang S. Boileau T.W. Erdman J.W.J. Clinton S.K. Prostate. 2005; 64: 186-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This finding indirectly supports our hypothesis that Akt plays an important role in AR gene expression in vivo. However, our model still needs to be examined directly by in vivo evidence. Despite the extensive studies on modulation of AR functions (35Heinlein C.A. Chang C. Endocr. Rev. 2004; 25: 276-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar), transcription regulation of the AR gene expression remains largely untouched (36Keller E.T. Ershler W.B. Chang C. Front. Biosci. 1996; 1: 59-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 37Lee D.K. Chang C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 88: 4043-4054Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The AR 5′ upstream promoter region does not contain a typical TATA box, a binding site for the general transcription factor TFIID/TFIID-binding protein (38Takane K.K. McPhaul M.J. Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 1996; 119: 83Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The AR promoter region contains Sp1-binding sites, cAMP-response element in the human AR gene, and the NF1 site in the rat AR gene. Sp1 has been reported to recruit the TFIID/TFIID-binding protein and mediate the transcription from the TATA-less promoters (37Lee D.K. Chang C. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Until now, few transcription factors other than general transcriptional machinery have been identified to regulate AR promoter activity (32Zhang L. Charron M. Wright W.W. Chatterjee B. Song C.S. Roy A.K. Brown T.R. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 781-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Here we report that the AR gene expression can be regulated by FOXO3a at the transcriptional level. Under certain physiological conditions when the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is inhibited, FOXO3a induces AR expression at both the protein and mRNA levels. Our EMSA and ChIP assays demonstrated that FOXO3a directly binds to the AR 5′ promoter, suggesting FOXO3a can directly regulate AR gene transcription. In summary, when survival factor Akt activity is inhibited, FOXO3a may up-regulate AR expression and function to protect the cells from apoptosis, suggesting a critical role for FOXO3a in maintaining LNCaP cellular homeostasis. These results may have significant implications for targeting both androgen receptor and Akt in human prostate cancer therapy. We are grateful to Drs. M. Greenberg and C. Y. Young for their reagents. We thank Karen Wolf and Hector Avila for helpful reading of the manuscript. We also thank the members in Dr. Chang's laboratory for technical support and insightful discussion."

In an attempt to further understand the biological function of ADAMTS-1, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed using the carboxyl-terminal region of ADAMTS-1 as bait. As a result, the extracellular matrix protein fibulin-1 was identified as a potential interacting molecule. Through a series of analyses that included ligand affinity chromatography, co-immunoprecipitation, pulldown assays, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the ability of these two proteins to interact was substantiated. Additional studies showed that ADAMTS-1 and fibulin-1 colocalized in vivo. Furthermore, fibulin-1 was found to enhance the capacity of ADAMTS-1 to cleave aggrecan, a proteoglycan known to bind to fibulin-1. We confirmed that fibulin-1 was not a proteolytic substrate for ADAMTS-1. Together, these findings indicate that fibulin-1 is a new regulator of ADAMTS-1-mediated proteoglycan proteolysis and thus may play an important role in proteoglycan turnover in tissues where there is overlapping expression.

Evaluation of secondary follicles in the ovaries of ADAMTS-1 null mice revealed poor cumulus expansion and defective ovulation.

Thus, a concrete understanding of the array of ADAMTS-1 biological functions will likely rely on insights from its substrates and regulation of catalytic function.The fibulins are a family of secreted glycoproteins that are components of elastic matrix fibers and basement membranes. Currently, there are six members of the fibulin family (16Argraves W.S. Greene L.M. Cooley M.A. Gallagher W.M. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1127-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The prototypic member, fibulin-1, contains the signature structural features of all fibulin family members, a series of epidermal growth factor-like repeats followed by a fibulin-type module at its carboxyl terminus (16Argraves W.S. Greene L.M. Cooley M.A. Gallagher W.M. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1127-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar).Functionally, fibulin-1 binds to many ECM proteins, including laminin, fibrinogen, fibronectin, nidogen-1, and endostatin, and to the proteoglycans, aggrecan and versican (17Timpl R.

Mice lacking fibulin-1 die perinatally and display vascular anomalies in the kidney in addition to extensive hemorrhage in several organs, likely related to abnormalities in endothelial cell interactions with subendothelial ECM (23Kostka G.

These findings, together with those showing that fibulin-1 can bind to aggrecan, led us to speculate that fibulin-1 acts to enhance ADAMTS-1-mediated proteolysis by facilitating a ternary complex formation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Two-hybrid Screening—The Matchmaker Two-hybrid System 2 (Clontech Laboratories Inc. Palo Alto, CA) was used following the manufacturer's recommendations. A cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 827-951 of human ADAMTS-1 (GenBank™ accession number AF060152) was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-CACCTACTTCGTACATATGAAGAAG-3′ and 5′-CTTAAACCAGTCGACTGCATTCTG-3′ and inserted into the vector pAS2-1 previously digested with NdeI and SalI restriction enzymes. The resulting construct encoded a GAL4BD-ADAMTS-1827-951 chimeric protein. A library of prey proteins from human placenta was obtained from Clontech Laboratories Inc. Both bait and prey vectors were simultaneously introduced into Saccharomyces cerevisiae CG-1945 cells and double transformants selected on synthetic minimal medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine. Colonies were restreaked and tested for β-galactosidase activity using a filter assay. DNA from positive colonies were amplified by PCR using Matchmaker 5′- and 3′-AD LD-Insert Screening Amplimers and the resulting amplicons sequenced.Pulldown Assay—Fibulin-1 or BSA (5 μg each) were individually covalently linked to magnetic M450 tosyl-activated dynabeads (DYNAL, Brown Deer, WI) by overnight incubation in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 37 °C. The beads were subsequently washed with 200 mm Tris, pH 8.5, with 0.1% BSA and incubated overnight at 4 °C with ADAMTS-1 (2 μg) in a volume of 400 μl. Dynabeads were magnetically collected and washed with phosphate-buffered saline to remove unbound proteins. Bound proteins were released using sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol and separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to Optitran nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell, Keene, NH), and immunoblotted with guinea pig anti-ADAMTS-1 polyclonal antibody (GPB).Co-immunoprecipitation Analysis—Fragments of human full-term placenta were homogenized in cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm iodoacetamide, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.02% NaN3, 1 mm PMSF, complete protease inhibitor mixture tablets following the manufacturer's direction (Roche Applied Science), 1% Triton X-100 using a Waring blender. The lysate was incubated with protein G-agarose beads (Roche Applied Science) overnight at 4 °C to absorb resin-binding proteins. Aliquots of the lysates (1 ml) were then incubated with antibodies to fibulin-1 (mAb 3A11), ADAMTS-1 (GPB), or mouse IgG (Sigma) for 3 h at 4°C. Antibody complexes were precipitated for 1 h at 4°C using either protein G-agarose (Roche Applied Science) for mouse IgGs or protein A-agarose (Roche Applied Science) for GPB. The agarose-bound complexes were pelleted by centrifugation at 1,000 × g and the pellets washed with 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Bound proteins were released using sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol and separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to Optitran nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell), and analyzed by immunoblotting.Conditioned medium from fibulin-1C-expressing HT1080 cells cultured in the absence of serum was collected and precleared with protein G-agarose beads (Roche Applied Science) for 16 h at 4 °C. Fibulin-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb 3A11) was added to 1-ml aliquots and incubated for 4 h at 4°C. Immunocomplexes were pelleted with protein G-agarose beads and the pellets washed extensively using 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 buffer. These fibulin-1-immobilized immunocomplexes were incubated with ADAMTS-1 (87-kDa form) for 2 h at 4 °C and unbound protein removed by washing with 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 buffer. After several washes, bound proteins were released using sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol, separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to Optitran nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell). The presence of ADAMTS-1 and fibulin-1 was evaluated by immunoblotting with GPB and mAb 3A11, respectively.Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Purified ADAMTS-1 (2.5 μg/ml) or fibulin-1 (10 μg/ml) in binding buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm Tris, pH 8.2) was coated on Costar high binding 96-well plates for 16 h at 4 °C. Coated wells were incubated with 2% BSA in TBS with 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2 for 90 min at room temperature. Wells coated with ADAMTS-1 were incubated with fibulin-1 (10 μg/ml) in TBS with 0.5% BSA, 0.5 mm CaCl2, and 0.5 mm MgCl2 and vice versa for 90 min at room temperature. Plates were washed with TBS with 0.5% BSA, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2. Bound proteins were detected with either mouse monoclonal antibodies against ADAMTS-1 (mAb 3E4C6B4) or fibulin-1 (mAb 3A11), and anti-mouse-IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate. Colorimetric reactions were performed using p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate (Sigma) and read at λ = 405 nm using a SpectraMax Plus spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).Solid Binding Assays—Microtiter plate wells were coated with human fibronectin, ADAMTS-1, or BSA at 3 μg/ml in TBS, pH 8.0, for 2 h at 37 °C and then rinsed three times with TBS, pH 7.4. Unbound sites were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% nonfat milk in TBS, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4. Wells were then rinsed three times with TBS, pH 7.4, and incubated with varying concentrations of fibulin-1 (ranging from 100 to 0.137 μg/ml) for 3-4 h at 37 °C in TBS containing 3% nonfat milk, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2. After rinsing with TBS, 0.1% Tween 20 and 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4 (wash buffer), wells were incubated with anti-fibulin-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb 3A11) at 1 μg/ml in TBS, pH 7.4, containing 3% nonfat milk and 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2. Wells were then rinsed with wash buffer three times and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG (1:5000 dilution, Amersham Biosciences) diluted in TBS, pH 7.4, containing 3% nonfat milk and 0.1% Tween 20. The wells were rinsed three times with wash buffer, and detection was performed using TMB substrate (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) with color development measured spectroscopically at λ = 650 nm. Curve fitting of data was performed using Sigmaplot 2001 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).ADAMTS-1 Affinity Chromatography—ADAMTS-1 (2 mg) was coupled to 2 ml of CNBr-activated CL-4B-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. Placental tissue (30 g) was extracted in 100 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.02% NaN3, 1 mm PMSF, 0.2 units/ml aprotinin, and 5 mm iodoacetamide, pH 8.0) using a Waring blender. The lysate was centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and then ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The lysate was precleared by passing through a 2-ml precolumn of glycine-Sepharose CL-4B (pre-equilibrated in lysis buffer) and loaded onto a 2-ml column of ADAMTS-1-Sepharose CL-4B (pre-equilibrated in lysis buffer) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min (Biologic Work station; Bio-Rad). The column was washed sequentially with 15 ml of lysis buffer and 15 ml of washing buffer (20 mm ethanolamine, 0.2% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm PMSF, pH 9). Bound proteins were eluted with a gradient starting at 20 mm ethanolamine, 0.2% n-octylglucoside, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm PMSF, pH 9, and finishing at 20 mm ethanolamine, 0.2% n-octylglucoside, 1 m NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm PMSF, pH 12. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and neutralized with 0.1 volume of 1 mm Tris, pH 6.7. Eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-fibulin-1 (mAb 3A11).Analysis of ADAMTS-1, Fibulin-1, and Aggrecan Expression in Embryonic Kidneys—Kidneys harvested from E15.5 embryos were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde overnight, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 5 μm. Sections were deparaffinized and incubated with blocking buffer (BB, 5% goat serum and 2.5% BSA in PBS) for 2 h at room temperature. Sections were incubated with guinea pig anti-ADAMTS-1 (GP12) at 1:200 dilution in 0.5× BB, rabbit anti-fibulin-1 (Rb1323) (24Argraves W.S. Dickerson K. Burgess W.H. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1989; 58: 623-629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) at 10 μg/ml in 0.5× BB, rabbit anti-aggrecan G1 domain or TASELE neo-epitope at 1:200 dilution in 0.5× BB for 2 h at room temperature. Sections were then incubated with anti-guinea pig IgG conjugated to biotin (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) at 1:250 dilution in 0.5× BB for 1.5 h, followed by incubation with streptavidin conjugated to CY3 (Sigma) at 1:100 dilution in 0.5× BB and anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) at 1:150 dilution in 0.5× BBfor 1 h at room temperature. Fluorescence immunohistochemistry was analyzed using a Bio-Rad MRC 1024ES laser confocal microscope.Anti-ADAMTS-1 GP12 antibody was raised in guinea pig by BIOSOURCE (Camarillo, CA) using purified ADAMTS-1 protein as immunizing antigen. Antibody specificity was tested against conditioned medium and cell lysates from T47D cells transfected with ADAMTS-1 or empty vector construct.Digestion of Fibulin-1 with ADAMTS-1—Fibulin-1 (1 μg) was incubated with ADAMTS-1 at 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3 molar ratio in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm CaCl2, 80 mm NaCl overnight at 37 °C in a total volume of 60 μl. Digests were separated in 10% SDS-PAGE electrophoresis under reducing conditions using β-mercaptoethanol and followed by immunoblotting with antibodies to the amino terminus (mAb 3A11) or the carboxyl terminus (mAb 5D12) of fibulin-1.Fibulin-1 was biotinylated with Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce Biotechnology) following the manufacturer's protocol. Biotinylated fibulin-1 was then dialyzed in PBS to remove unbound biotin. Soluble biotinylated fibulin-1 was incubated with 2× molar ratio of ADAMTS-1, catalytically inactive ADAMTS-1 (zinc mutant), or buffer control in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm CaCl2, 80 mm NaCl overnight at 37 °C in a total volume of 60 μl. Biotinylated fibulin-1 was also incubated in fibronectin-coated 96-well plates. Fibronectin-immobilized fibulin-1 was subsequently incubated with 2 molar ratio of ADAMTS-1 or zinc mutant in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm CaCl2, 80 mm NaCl overnight at 37 °C in a total volume of 60 μl. Digests were separated on SDS containing 10% polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions with β-mercaptoethanol. Biotinylated proteins were detected with avidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (Vector Labs).Proteoglycan Digestion—Rat aggrecan was a generous gift from Dr. John Sandy (Shriners Hospital for Children, Tampa, FL). Aggrecan is further purified to obtain the intact form and removed processed forms; however, 250-kDa fragments are frequent contaminants, and this degree of contamination varies from 10 to 50%. Thus, controls for each purification lot are always included. Aggrecan (7.5 μg) either alone or in the presence of ADAMTS-1 (0.5-1 μg) was incubated in 60 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm CaCl2, 80 mm NaCl for 2 h at 37°C containing fibulin-1, fibronectin, vitronectin, fibrinogen, or BSA (1 μg each). The reaction mixtures were deglycosylated in 50 mm sodium acetate, 50 mm Tris, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.6 with 1.8-15 milliunits of chondroitinase ABC (Sigma) at 37 °C for 1 h prior to separation on 10% SDS-PAGE electrophoresis in reducing conditions with β-mercaptoethanol and immunoblotting. Rat aggrecan was also digested with ADAMTS-1 in the presence of varying amounts of fibulin-1 (0.35, 0.7, or 1.5 μg) or laminin-1 (0.7, 1.5, or 3.0 μg) for 2 h at 37°C (60-μl reaction volume) followed by chondroitinase digestion as mentioned above. Digests were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE or 4-12% gradient polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen). The extent of aggrecan cleavage was determined by immunoblotting using rabbit anti-G1 aggrecan antibody (a generous gift from Dr. John Sandy). ADAMTS-1 was detected in immunoblotting with GPB, laminin-1 was detected with anti-laminin (Sigma), and fibulin-1 was detected with mAb 3A11 antibodies.RNA Isolation and Northern Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from several organs at E16.5, E17.5, and E18.5. Purification of mRNA was performed as previously described (25Thai S.N. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Mech. Dev. 2002; 115: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Fractionation of mRNA (2 μg/lane) was performed on agarose/formaldehyde gels, and subsequent transfer was done onto nylon membranes. Probes included a 951-bp cDNA fragment for ADAMTS-1 and a 360-bp fragment encoding the 3′-end of fibulin-1.Generation of ADAMTS-1 Null Mice—Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone number 413009 carrying genomic fragments of adamts1 from mouse strain 129/SvJ was purchased from Genome Systems, Inc. (St. Louis, MI). An 8.4-kb EcoRI fragment extending from the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) to exon 2 and a 6.6-kb HindIII fragment spanning from intron 7 to the 3′-UTR were obtained after digestion of BAC clone number 413009 and were subsequently subcloned into pGEM11ZF(+) and pGEM7ZF(+) (Promega, Madison, WI), respectively. The targeting construct was generated by subcloning a 3.2-kb HindIII-XbaI fragment spanning the 5′-UTR to part of intron 1, a 3.6-kb BamHI-BamHI fragment encompassing exon 9 and the 3′-UTR and a 2.0-kb flox-PGK-Neo (XbaI) into pGEM11ZF(+). The flox-PGK-Neo construct was a generous gift from Dr. K. Lyons. The resulting targeting construct was linearized with XhoI and HindIII to remove the pGEM11ZF(+) plasmid prior to being introduced into 129/SvJ-derived embryonic stem cells by electroporation at the UCLA Molecular Genetics and Technology Center. Embryonic stem cells were then selected in growth medium containing G418 (300 μg/ml), and homologous recombinants were identified by Southern blot analysis. Chimeric males were generated from two independent targeted embryonic stem cell clones injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts (UC Irvine Transgenic Mouse Facility, Irvine, CA). Male chimeras were crossbred with BALB/c females, and germ line transmission was obtained from both independent embryonic stem clones.PCR Genotyping of ADAMTS-1 Mice—Genomic DNA was isolated from tails of embryos using a standard phenol:chloroform extraction protocol. Wild-type locus was amplified using primers that anneal to the 5′-end (5′-TGCCACACCTCACTGCTTAC-3′) and the 3′-end of exon 9 (5′-TTAATGGACACCCTGCTTCC-3′). Targeted locus was amplified using primers to the 3′-end of exon 9 as mentioned and the 5′-PGK-neo cassette sequence (5′-TATCGCCGCTCCCGATTC-3′). PCR was performed using HOTMASTER Taq polymerase (Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany) with annealing temperature of 62 °C for 35 cycles.RESULTSIdentification of Fibulin-1D by Yeast Two-hybrid Screening as an ADAMTS-1-binding Protein—A yeast two-hybrid screen of a human placenta cDNA library was conducted to identify proteins capable of interacting with ADAMTS-1. A fragment of the carboxyl-terminal portion of human ADAMTS-1 containing the two last thrombospondin type I repeats (amino acid residues 827-951) was used as a bait to screen for potential binding proteins (Fig. 1). Among several positive clones identified, one clone, designated F3.3.2, contained a 1371-bp insert that corresponded to nucleotides 1439-2810 of a human fibulin-1D cDNA (GenBank™ accession number AF126110). The sequence encoded by clone F3.3.2 corresponds to the carboxyl-end of fibulin-1D (amino acid residues 476-703), including the two last epidermal growth factor-like elements and the carboxyl-terminal fibulin-type module (Fig. 1).Evaluation of the ADAMTS-1-Fibulin-1 Binding Interaction—The interaction between ADAMTS-1 and fibulin-1 was further validated by several biochemical approaches. Tosyl-activated magnetic beads coupled to fibulin-1 were able to bind to purified ADAMTS-1 in solution, whereas BSA-coated magnetic beads did not (Fig. 2A). Fibulin-1C immunoprecipitated from conditioned medium with mAb 3A11 was able to pull down ADAMTS-1 (Fig. 2B, lane 2). Anti-fibulin-1 mAb 3A11 only recovered trace amounts of ADAMTS-1 when in the absence of fibulin-1C (Fig. 2B, lane 5). In addition, the interaction was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using purified proteins. As shown in Fig. 2C, fibulin-1 bound to immobilized ADAMTS-1. The reciprocal experiment was also performed, and ADAMTS-1 was found to bind to immobilized fibulin-1 (Fig. 2C). The binding affinity between these two proteins was also determined. Fibronectin was used as a positive control because it has been shown to interact with fibulin-1 (19Tran H. VanDusen W.J. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22600-22606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 26Balbona K. Tran H. Godyna S. Ingham K.C. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20120-20125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 96-well plates were coated with human fibronectin, ADAMTS-1, or BSA (negative control) at 3 μg/ml and subsequently allowed to bind fibulin-1 at varying concentrations. Based on a fit of the data to a form of the binding isotherm (26Balbona K. Tran H. Godyna S. Ingham K.C. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20120-20125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), fibulin-1 bound to ADAMTS-1 with an apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of 1.0 μm as compared with Kd of 0.43 μm for fibulin-1 binding to fibronectin (Fig. 2D). As previously shown for fibulin-1-fibronectin interactions (19Tran H. VanDusen W.J. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22600-22606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), saturable binding was not achieved between fibulin-1 and immobilized ADAMTS-1. The basis for this may relate to the fact that fibulin-1 can self associate (19Tran H. VanDusen W.J. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22600-22606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar); thus, with increased binding of solution phase fibulin-1 to the immobilized ADAMTS-1, additional fibulin-1 binding sites are created.FIGURE 2Demonstration of ADAMTS-1-fibulin-1 binding.

As shown in Fig. 3A, low ionic strength buffer released weakly interacting fibulin-1 (fractions 3-13). Subsequent exposure to higher pH and high ionic strength buffer released tightly bound fibulin-1 (fraction 22).

These experiments revealed that ADAMTS-1 could be co-immunoprecipitated with fibulin-1 (Fig. 3B, lane 3). Conversely, fibulin-1 was found to co-immunoprecipitate with ADAMTS-1 antibodies (Fig. 3B, lane 1, GPB).

We assessed the hypothesis that disturbances in Ca2+ handling linked Gαq activity to apoptosis because resting Ca2+ levels were significantly increased prior to development of apoptosis. Treating cells with EGTA lowered Ca2+ and blocked both loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (an indicator of permeability transition pore opening) and apoptosis (assessed by DNA fragmentation). When cytosolic Ca2+ and mitochondrial membrane potential were simultaneously measured by confocal microscopy, sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)-driven slow Ca2+ oscillations (time-to-peak ∼4 s) were observed in Q209L-expressing cells. These oscillations were seen to transition into sustained increases in cytosolic Ca2+, directly paralleled by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Ca2+ transients generated by caffeine-induced release of SR Ca2+ were greatly prolonged in Q209L-expressing cells, suggesting a decreased ability to extrude Ca2+. Indeed, the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX), which removes Ca2+ from the cell, was markedly down-regulated at the mRNA and protein levels. Adenoviral NCX expression normalized cytosolic Ca2+ levels and prevented DNA fragmentation in cells expressing Q209L. Interestingly, constitutively activated Akt, which rescues cells from Q209L-induced apoptosis, prevented the decrease in NCX expression, normalized cytosolic Ca2+ levels and spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations, shortened caffeine-induced Ca2+ transients, and prevented loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential. Our findings demonstrate that NCX down-regulation and consequent increases in cytosolic and SR Ca2+ can lead to Ca2+ overloading-induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and suggest that recovery of Ca2+ dysregulation is a target of Akt-mediated protection.

Cardiomyocyte apoptosis has been suggested to be a major factor contributing to the transition from compensated hypertrophy to dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure (1.Hirota H. Chen J. Betz U.A.

Administration of a caspase inhibitor to Gαq transgenic mice (GαqTG) decreases apoptosis, improves cardiac function, and completely suppresses mortality due to peripartal cardiomyopathy (5.Hayakawa Y.

Transgenic mice expressing a constitutively activated form of Gαq also develop a dilated cardiomyopathy (9.Mende U. Kagen A. Cohen A. Aramburu J. Schoen F.J. Neer E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13893-13898Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Thus, although moderate activation of Gαq is a well established mediator of cardiac hypertrophy, excessive Gαq activation can lead to apoptosis that contributes to the transition from hypertrophy to heart failure (2.Adams J.W. Sakata Y. Davis M.G. Sah V.P. Wang Y. Liggett S.B. Chien K.R. Brown J.H. Dorn II, G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10140-10145Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 10.Adams J.W.

Enhanced stimulation of Gαq is not limited to transgenic overexpression but can also occur in physiological settings when hormones that act on Gq-coupled receptors are elevated (11.Swedberg K.

We previously described parallel in vitro and in vivo models in which expression of wild-type Gαq (GαqWT) induced hypertrophy, whereas expression of constitutively activated Gαq (GαqQ209L; Q209L) induced hypertrophy that rapidly progressed to apoptosis (2.Adams J.W. Sakata Y. Davis M.G. Sah V.P. Wang Y. Liggett S.B. Chien K.R. Brown J.H. Dorn II, G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10140-10145Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 14.Adams J.W. Pagel A.L. Means C.K. Oksenberg D. Armstrong R.C. Brown J.H. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 1180-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The development of apoptosis was shown to be associated with mitochondrial membrane depolarization resulting from opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PT-pore) (14.Adams J.W. Pagel A.L. Means C.K. Oksenberg D. Armstrong R.C. Brown J.H. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 1180-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), a mega-channel with permeability to ions and solutes up to ∼1,500 daltons. Inhibition of PT-pore opening with bongkrekic acid rescued Gαq-induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization and apoptosis, implicating the mitochondrial PT-pore as a critical site for intervention (14.Adams J.W. Pagel A.L. Means C.K. Oksenberg D. Armstrong R.C. Brown J.H. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 1180-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The proapoptotic BH-3 only protein, Nix, was subsequently implicated in Gαq-induced apoptosis and heart failure development in vivo (4.Yussman M.G. Toyokawa T. Odley A. Lynch R.A. Wu G. Colbert M.C. Aronow B.J. Lorenz J.N. Dorn II, G.W. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In addition we reported that Akt activity was compromised and that constitutively activated Akt rescued cells from Q209L-induced apoptosis (15.Howes A.L. Arthur J.F. Zhang T. Miyamoto S. Adams J.W. Dorn I.G. Woodcock E.A. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40343-40351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The predictive potential of the Q209L cell model encouraged us to utilize this paradigm to further evaluate mechanisms contributing to PT-pore opening and to identify mechanisms of Akt-mediated protection. Previous studies examining cardiomyocytes from Gαq transgenic mice revealed prolongation of Ca2+ transients and decreases in cardiomyocyte Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) (16.Mitarai S. Reed T.D. Yatani A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H139-H148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggested that the ability to decrease cytosolic Ca2+ was compromised. Elevated cytosolic Ca2+ has been implicated in cell death pathways, and Ca2+ overloading in the mitochondrial matrix has been suggested to lead to opening of the PT-pore (17.Di Lisa F. Menabò R.

Res. 2003; 93: 292-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The experiments described here provide evidence that sustained stimulation of Gαq leads to alterations in cytosolic Ca2+ regulation and cytosolic Ca2+ overloading that predisposes to Ca2+-induced increases in mitochondrial depolarization and apoptosis. Importantly, the mechanism underlying these changes is shown to be decreased NCX expression. In addition, we demonstrated that protective effects of Akt involve restoration of NCX expression, cytosolic Ca2+, and mitochondrial membrane potential. Adenoviral Infection—Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes were isolated from 1–2-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat pups and infected as described previously (2.Adams J.W. Sakata Y. Davis M.G. Sah V.P. Wang Y. Liggett S.B. Chien K.R. Brown J.H. Dorn II, G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10140-10145Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Fura-2 Measurements of Ca2+—Cells plated on a coverslip were loaded with 2 μm fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at room temperature in medium composed of 121 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaHCO3,10 mm Na-Hepes, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm glucose (pH 7.4) and placed on an inverted microscope. Fluorescence was recorded with a dual-excitation fluorescence photomultiplier system (IonOptix) at room temperature. Intracellular Ca2+ concentration was calibrated by in vitro calibration. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS) Analysis of TMRE Fluorescence—Mitochondrial membrane potential has been commonly utilized as an indicator of PT-pore opening (21.Akao M. O'Rourke B. Teshima Y. Seharaseyon J. Marbán E. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 24.Petronilli V. Penzo D. Scorrano L. Bernardi P. Di Lisa F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12030-12034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), because prolonged PT-pore opening leads to mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Cells were loaded with 50 nm of the fluorescent potential-dependent indicator, tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE) (Molecular Probes) for 20 min at room temperature and collected by trypsinization (0.05% trypsin, 0.53 mm EDTA). The fluorescence intensity was monitored at 582 nm (FL-2 channel) by FACScan (BD Biosciences) (15,000 cells/sample). Confocal Imaging of Cytosolic Ca2+ and Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—To simultaneously measure cytosolic Ca2+ and mitochondrial membrane potential, Ca2+ imaging (fluo-4) by confocal microscopy (rather than fura-2) was utilized. Cells were loaded with 3 μm fluo-4/AM (Molecular Probes) for 30 min and with 50 nm TMRE for the final 20 min at room temperature. Confocal imaging was carried out using a Bio-Rad MRC1024ES imaging system equipped with a Kr/Ar-ion laser fitted to an Olympus BX50WI inverted microscope with assistance from Drs. Matt Conklin and Nicholas C. Spitzer (University of California San Diego). Images were captured using ×60 objective (Olympus, LUMplanFI) (optical section was <0.8 μm). Fluo-4 and MitoTracker Green (Molecular Probes) were excited at 488 nm and TMRE was excited at 568 nm. Fluorescence was recorded using two photomultipliers and emission filters of 522DF35 for fluo-4 and MitoTracker Green and HQ598/40 for TMRE. Fluorescences values were background subtracted and expressed as a relative value (100 F/F0, where F is the measured fluorescence and F0 is that at the beginning of the experiment), because calibration of absolute value is not possible with single excitation/emission dyes. Experiments were analyzed using Scion Image (Scion Corporation). Validation of Simultaneous Ca2+ and PT-pore Measurements—The use of confocal imaging of TMRE fluorescence to detect PT-pore opening in cardiomyocytes was validated in several ways. First we determined that TMRE fluorescence colocalized with MitoTracker Green, a membrane potential-independent mitochondrial probe (25.Metivier D. Dallaporta B. Zamzami N. Larochette N. Susin S.A. Marzo I. Kroemer G. Immunol. Lett. 1998; 61: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and that disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential with FCCP abolished TMRE fluorescence without affecting that of MitoTracker Green (data not shown). In addition, we determined that ionomycin, a Ca2+ ionophore, induced robust elevations in cytosolic Ca2+, followed within 500 s by a decrease in TMRE fluorescence to background levels, confirming that large elevations in cytosolic Ca2+ can elicit mitochondrial membrane depolarization. These data further established conditions under which fluo-4 and TMRE fluorescences could be measured simultaneously as independent variables (i.e. interference between these two fluorescent indicators is negligible). Statistical Analysis—Results are reported as averages ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined using analysis of variance followed by the Tukey post-hoc test. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Cytosolic Ca2+ was measured in control adenovirus (AdCMV)-, Q209L-, and GαqWT-expressing cells using the ratiometric Ca2+ dye, fura-2. Resting (diastolic) levels of cytosolic Ca2+ in Q209L-expressing cells were modestly elevated at 8 h and significantly higher than in GαqWT-expressing or control cells at 24 h after virus removal (Fig. 1A). DNA fragmentation, an indicator of apoptosis, was evident at 36 h in Q209L-expressing, but not in control cells (Fig. 1B). When cells expressing Q209L were cultured in normal medium to which EGTA (or the intracellular Ca2+ chelator BAPTA/AM) was added, cytosolic Ca2+ was maintained at control levels (Fig. 1A) and apoptosis was markedly attenuated (Fig. 1C). Similar inhibition was seen when cells were cultured with BAPTA/AM (not shown). We previously reported that Q209L expression resulted in mitochondrial membrane depolarization and that this effect was prevented by bongkrekic acid, a PT-pore inhibitor (14.Adams J.W. Pagel A.L. Means C.K. Oksenberg D. Armstrong R.C. Brown J.H. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 1180-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To determine whether elevated Ca2+ contributes to the Q209L-induced PT-pore opening and consequent loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, cardiomyocytes were loaded with TMRE, a mitochondrial membrane potential indicator. Cells were sorted by FACS analysis, and the procedure was validated utilizing FCCP, an H+ ionophore that acts on mitochondria to dissipate the mitochondrial membrane potential. As shown in Fig. 2A, FCCP treatment decreased the cell population showing high intensity TMRE fluorescence (i.e. normal mitochondrial membrane potential) in a time-dependent manner. We then analyzed cells expressing control adenovirus, GαqWT, or Q209L. FACS analysis revealed that Q209L expression led to a dramatic time-dependent decrease in the number of myocytes with high intensity TMRE fluorescence (Fig. 2B). The loss of mitochondrial membrane potential was evident by 24 h after virus removal and extensive by 36 h (Fig. 2B) when DNA fragmentation was first observed (Fig. 1B). EGTA treatment did not affect control cells but significantly inhibited the loss of high intensity TMRE fluorescence in Q209L-expressing cells at 24 h (not shown) and 36 h (Fig. 2C) after virus removal. The observation that chelating Ca2+ in Q209L-expressing cells normalized cytosolic Ca2+ levels and prevented loss of mitochondrial membrane potential supports the hypothesis that elevated Ca2+ or its sequelae mediate PT-pore opening in response to Q209L expression. Ca2+ movements were then examined by fluo-4 fluorescence imaging using confocal microscopy. GαqWT-expressing cells, examined at 8–36 h after virus removal, showed regular spontaneous Ca2+ transients (Fig. 3A, 24 h). In contrast a significant portion of Q209L-expressing cells, examined at 24 h after virus removal in at least two dozen separate experiments, showed large slow Ca2+ oscillations (Fig. 3, A–C, and Fig. 4A, top panels). Ryanodine and thapsigargin treatment abolished these large and slow Ca2+ oscillations (Fig. 3C), providing evidence that they are driven by release of Ca2+ from the SR. Chelating Ca2+ with EGTA or BAPTA/AM also blocked the appearance of Ca2+ oscillations. However, addition of verapamil (1 μm) to inhibit Ca2+ influx had no effect on these Ca2+ movements (data not shown).FIGURE 4Relationship between Ca2+ elevation and TMRE fluorescence.

Over time the slow Ca2+ transients frequently resolved into high sustained cytosolic Ca2+ increases (Ca2+ overloading) (Fig. 3B). Because there was a population of cells that also showed decreased mitochondrial membrane potential at this time (24 h after virus removal, see Fig. 2B), we surmise that the cells showing slow Ca2+ transients and Ca2+ overloading are those captured in their transition to the apoptotic state. To determine whether the observed cytosolic Ca2+ overloading contributed to the opening of the mitochondrial PT-pore, we carried out experiments in which fluo-4 and TMRE fluorescence changes were examined simultaneously in the same cardiomyocyte (Fig. 4). TMRE fluorescence was stable in control AdCMV-infected cells (90.1 ± 3.2% of F0 at 35 min, n = 5) and also in GαqWT-expressing cells, indicating that it was unaffected by the regular spontaneous Ca2+ transients observed in those cells. In contrast, as the slow Ca2+ oscillations in Q209L-expressing cells (Fig. 4A, top panels) resolved into high sustained cytosolic Ca2+ increases, TMRE fluorescence gradually decreased until fluorescence was no longer detectable (Fig. 4A, lower panels). Fig. 4B shows another example of a cell in which the onset of Ca2+ oscillations and development of a sustained increase in Ca2+ were paralleled by a decrease in TMRE fluorescence. We previously reported that bongkrekic acid, a PT-pore inhibitor, blocks mitochondrial membrane depolarization and resultant apoptosis in Q209L-expressing cells (14.Adams J.W. Pagel A.L. Means C.K. Oksenberg D. Armstrong R.C. Brown J.H. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 1180-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Addition of bongkrekic acid, although blocking loss of TMRE fluorescence, did not prevent the rise in cytosolic Ca2+ in Q209L-expressing cells (not shown). This supports our suggestion that the dysregulated Ca2+ transients lead to, rather than result from release of Ca2+ from depolarized mitochondria. The results described above provide evidence that large increases in cytosolic Ca2+ can induce PT-pore opening in a living single cell. To determine the threshold for Ca2+ to induce PT-pore opening, we measured TMRE fluorescence in cells permeabilized with saponin and exposed to a range of Ca2+ concentrations controlled by titration with EGTA. Saponin treatment permeabilized the plasma membrane, as indicated by loss of cytosolic fluo-4 fluorescence, TMRE fluorescence was not diminished (Fig. 5A), indicating that mitochondria were still intact. The TMRE fluorescence observed at 0.1 μm Ca2+ was not significantly affected when Ca2+ was increased to 1.25 μm, but 2 μm Ca2+ fully depolarized mitochondria, as indicated by complete loss of TMRE fluorescence (Fig. 5B). The finding that Q209L-expressing cells have elevated cytosolic Ca2+ and show large/slow Ca2+ oscillations emanating from the SR suggested that Ca2+ extrusion to the extracellular space was diminished. To examine this possibility, we used caffeine to induce Ca2+ release through SR Ca2+ release channels and examined cytosolic Ca2+ transients. Because the SR is unable to retain Ca2+ in the presence of caffeine, the declining phase of the caffeine-induced Ca2+ transients has been used to evaluate cellular capacity for Ca2+ extrusion by NCX, a major mechanism for extruding cytosolic Ca2+ from cardiomyocytes (26.Bers D.M. Nature. 2002; 415: 198-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3209) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 shows representative traces of caffeine-induced Ca2+ transients. Caffeine induced a rapid transient increase in Ca2+ that returned to baseline in control (Fig. 6A) or GαqWT-expressing (Fig. 6B) cells. In contrast, prolonged and frequently sustained caffeine-induced Ca2+ transients were seen in Q209L-expressing cells (two separate cells are shown in Fig. 6C). The amplitudes of these Ca2+ transients, indicative of SR Ca2+ load, were also greater in Q209L-expressing cells. The averaged half-decay time, shown graphically in Fig. 6F (calculated as described in the figure legends), was increased 4-fold in Q209L-expressing cells. The half-decay times were also significantly increased in Q209L-expressing cells treated with EGTA or BAPTA/AM (Fig. 6F), although EGTA and BAPTA/AM treatments normalized the cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations (Fig. 1A) and the amplitude of the caffeine-induced Ca2+ transients (Fig. 6, D and E). The prolonged caffeine-induced Ca2+ transient, seen even when cytosolic and stored Ca2+ are normalized, suggested that Ca2+ extrusion by NCX was diminished in Q209L-expressing cells. To further explore this hypothesis, we assessed the level of NCX expression. Small decreases in NCX protein were observed in Q209L-expressing cells versus control cells at 8 h, with marked decreases (50 and 70%) at 24 and 36 h after virus removal, respectively (Fig. 7A). This was associated with significantly decreased NCX mRNA levels as assessed by real-time PCR experiments (44.4 ± 13.1% of control at 24 h after virus removal). In contrast, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) expression was unchanged in Q209L-expressing versus control or GαqWT cells (92.5 ± 14.1% of control at 24 h after virus removal, n = 5). To determine whether the down-regulation of NCX plays a critical role in Ca2+ dysregulation and consequent apoptosis, we tested the ability of NCX overexpression to rescue these responses. When cells were co-infected with NCX and Q209L, the increase in resting cytosolic Ca2+ was prevented (Fig. 7B) and the amplitude and time course of the caffeine-induced Ca2+ transient were shortened (Fig. 7C). The spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations characteristic of Q209L-expressing cells were no longer observed (not shown). Finally, the development of DNA fragmentation was fully inhibited (Fig. 7D). These findings support a central role for NCX down-regulation in the observed cytosolic Ca2+ accumulation and apoptosis. As we have previously reported (15.Howes A.L. Arthur J.F. Zhang T. Miyamoto S. Adams J.W. Dorn I.G. Woodcock E.A. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40343-40351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), constitutively activated Akt (myr-Akt) rescues cells from apoptosis induced by Q209L expression (Fig. 8A). The Q209L-induced loss of TMRE fluorescence, quantitated by FACS analysis, was significantly attenuated by myr-Akt (Fig. 8B). This implies that Akt rescue occurs, in part, upstream of mitochondrial PT-pore opening. Because we postulated that decreased NCX expression and increased cytosolic Ca2+ were upstream signals for PT-pore opening, we examined the effect of myr-Akt on these parameters. Remarkably myr-Akt nearly abolished the decrease in NCX expression (Fig. 8C) and mRNA levels (90.2 ± 29.0% of control at 24 h after virus removal), consistent with its ability to normalize caffeine-induced Ca2+ transients as shown in Fig. 8D, lower panel. Co-expression of myr-Akt also normalized the spontaneous Ca2+ transients to resemble those in GαqWT-expressing cells (Fig. 8D, top). Finally, the elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ was inhibited by myr-Akt expression (Fig. 8E). Thus, NCX expression and concomitant regulation of cytosolic Ca2+ levels appear to be targets for Akt action in cardiomyocytes. We have previously shown that excessive stimulation of Gαq induces cardiomyocyte apoptosis through PT-pore opening (14.Adams J.W. Pagel A.L. Means C.K. Oksenberg D. Armstrong R.C. Brown J.H. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 1180-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We also reported that constitutively activated Akt inhibits development of apoptosis in this system (15.Howes A.L. Arthur J.F.

Neither the mechanisms underlying induction of the PT-pore nor the mechanisms of Akt-mediated protection have been fully elucidated. We have demonstrated here that NCX down-regulation and resultant Ca2+ accumulation play an important role as apoptotic stimuli in response to the sustained activation of Gαq in cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Akt-mediated cardioprotection can occur at the level of Ca2+ regulation. The involvement of elevated cytosolic Ca2+ in Gαq-induced apoptosis is supported by our finding that EGTA or BAPTA/AM treatments block Q209L-induced cytosolic Ca2+ accumulation, loss of the mitochondrial membra"
https://openalex.org/W2126629855,"Utrophin up-regulation in muscle fibers of Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients represents a potential therapeutic strategy. It is thus important to delineate the regulatory events presiding over utrophin in muscle in attempts to develop pharmacological interventions aimed at increasing utrophin expression. A number of studies have now shown that under several experimental conditions, the abundance of utrophin is increased without a corresponding elevation in its mRNA. Here, we examine whether utrophin expression is regulated at the translational level in regenerating muscle fibers. Treatment of mouse tibialis anterior muscles with cardiotoxin to induce muscle degeneration/regeneration led to a large (∼14-fold) increase in the levels of utrophin A with a modest change in expression of its transcript (40%). Isolation of the mouse utrophin A 5′-untranslated region (UTR) revealed that it is relatively long with a predicted high degree of secondary structure. In control muscles, the 5′-UTR of utrophin A caused an inhibition upon translation of a reporter protein. Strikingly, this inhibition was removed during regeneration, indicating that expression of utrophin A in regenerating muscles is translationally regulated via its 5′-UTR. Using bicistronic reporter vectors, we observed that this translational effect involves an internal ribosome entry site in the utrophin A 5′-UTR. Thus, internal ribosome entry site-mediated translation of utrophin A can, at least partially, account for the discordant expression of utrophin A protein and transcript in regenerating muscle. These findings provide a novel target for up-regulating levels of utrophin A in Duchenne muscular dystrophy muscle fibers via pharmacological interventions.

Neuromuscul. Disord. 1991; 1: 19-29Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). Although the genetic defect underlying DMD was identified 20 years ago (2Anderson M.S. Kunkel L.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 289-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 3Cohn R.D. Campbell K.P. Muscle Nerve. 2000; 23: 1456-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), there is still no effective treatment to alter the relentless progression of this debilitating neuromuscular disease (4Chakkalakal J.V. Thompson J. Parks R.J. Jasmin B.J. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 880-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). DMD is caused by deletions/mutations in the dystrophin gene, which prevents production of full-length dystrophin molecules in skeletal muscle fibers. One therapeutic strategy to treat DMD consists in up-regulating the endogenous levels of a protein in muscle fibers of affected patients, which, once expressed at the appropriate location, could functionally compensate for the absence of dystrophin. An ideal candidate for such a role is utrophin (5Jasmin B.J. Angus L.M. Belanger G. Chakkalakal J.V. Gramolini A.O. Lunde J.A. Stocksley M.A. Thompson J. J. Physiol. Paris. 2002; 96: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 6Khurana T.S. Davies K.E. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2003; 2: 379-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Utrophin is a large cytoskeletal protein that displays a high degree of structural and functional similarity to dystrophin. In this context, overexpression of utrophin in muscle fibers of a DMD mouse model has been shown to alleviate the dystrophic pathology (7Tinsley J.M. Blake D.J. Roche A. Fairbrother U. Riss J. Byth B.C. Knight A.E. Kendrick-Jones J. Suthers G.K. Love D.R. Edwards Y.H. Davies K.E. Nature. 1992; 360: 591-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 8Tinsley J.M. Potter A.C. Phelps S.R.

Med. 1997; 3: 1216-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), thereby demonstrating that increased expression of utrophin could indeed yield important clinical benefits. A major difference between utrophin and dystrophin relates to their pattern of expression in skeletal muscle fibers. Whereas dystrophin localizes along the cytoplasmic face of the entire muscle fiber, utrophin preferentially accumulates at the levels of the myotendinous and neuromuscular junctions (10Ohlendieck K. Ervasti J.M. Matsumura K. Kahl S.D. Leveille C.J. Campbell K.P. Neuron. 1991; 7: 499-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 11Bewick G.S. Nicholson L.V. Young C. O'Donnell E.

Disord. 1992; 2: 177-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To be valid as a therapeutic strategy for DMD, utrophin expression must therefore be extended in extrasynaptic compartments of dystrophic muscle fibers. Thus, elucidating the nature of the molecular events controlling expression of utrophin in muscle fibers becomes important, since it could lead to the rational design of pharmacological interventions aimed at up-regulating utrophin in muscle fibers of DMD patients. Two full-length isoforms of utrophin have now been identified and named utrophin A (13Dennis C.L. Tinsley J.M. Deconinck A.E. Davies K.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1646-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and utrophin B (14Burton E.A. Tinsley J.M. Holzfeind P.J. Rodrigues N.R. Davies K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14025-14030Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These isoforms are encoded by mRNAs that are transcribed from two different promoters. These two mRNAs differ mostly in their 5′-untranslated region (UTR) as well as in their initial coding portion, resulting in protein products that slightly differ in their N termini. Utrophin A is the major full-length isoform expressed in skeletal muscle fibers, whereas expression of utrophin B is relatively higher in the vasculature (15Weir A.P. Burton E.A. Harrod G. Davies K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45285-45290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To date, most of the studies that have examined the mechanisms regulating utrophin A expression in muscle cells have focused on transcriptional regulation. For example, the synaptic accumulation of utrophin A has been shown to involve the local transcriptional activation of the utrophin A promoter through an N-box motif and the Ets-related transcription factor GA-binding protein, which is activated by heregulin stimulation (16Gramolini A.O. Angus L.M. Schaeffer L. Burton E.A. Tinsley J.M. Davies K.E. Changeux J.P. Jasmin B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3223-3227Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 17Khurana T.S. Rosmarin A.G. Shang J. Krag T.O. Das S. Gammeltoft S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2075-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Recent studies have also shown that utrophin A is expressed at low levels in extrasynaptic compartments of slow muscle fibers and, in this case, is subject to regulatory events involving the calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cells signaling pathway (18Chakkalakal J.V. Stocksley M.A. Harrison M.A. Angus L.M. Deschenes-Furry J. St. Pierre S. Megeney L.A. Chin E.R. Michel R.N. Jasmin B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7791-7796Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 19Chakkalakal J.V. Harrison M.A. Carbonetto S. Chin E. Michel R.N. Jasmin B.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In addition to transcriptional mechanisms, there is mounting evidence indicating that post-transcriptional mechanisms also regulate utrophin expression in muscle. This is coherent with the fact that post-transcriptional mechanisms are known to control expression of several synaptic proteins in muscle cells (20Chakkalakal J.V. Jasmin B.J. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In particular, we have previously shown that distinct elements within the utrophin 3′-UTR are important for controlling the stability of utrophin transcripts in muscle cells and for targeting them to specific subcellular locations (21Gramolini A.O. Belanger G. Jasmin B.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1173-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 22Gramolini A.O. Belanger G. Thompson J.M. Chakkalakal J.V. Jasmin B.J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 281: C1300-C1309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Converging lines of evidence also indicate that utrophin may be regulated at the translational and/or post-translational level. For example, we have previously demonstrated that utrophin levels are greatly up-regulated during muscle regeneration without a corresponding increase in expression of its mRNA (23Gramolini A.O. Karpati G. Jasmin B.J. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 58: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the same study, we also noted that although utrophin levels are increased in muscle biopsy samples from DMD patients, levels of utrophin mRNA are similar to those seen in normal muscle samples (23Gramolini A.O. Karpati G. Jasmin B.J. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 58: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 24Chen Y.W. Zhao P. Borup R. Hoffman E.P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1321-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Since these initial findings, several other laboratories have also reported discordant patterns of expression of utrophin protein and transcript. Specifically, Weir et al. (15Weir A.P. Burton E.A. Harrod G. Davies K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45285-45290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) detected an increase in the abundance of utrophin A in muscle from mdx mice with no parallel elevation in the levels of utrophin A transcript. Similarly, utrophin protein levels in muscle change significantly during the life span of mdx mice with little alteration in the expression of utrophin mRNAs (25Roma J. Munell F. Fargas A. Roig M. Acta Neuropathol. (Berl.). 2004; 108: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Finally, results from several other studies also support the idea that utrophin is regulated via translational mechanisms (26Courdier-Fruh I. Barman L. Briguet A. Meier T. Neuromuscul. Disord. 2002; 12: 95-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 27Moghadaszadeh B. Albrechtsen R. Guo L.T. Zaik M. Kawaguchi N. Borup R.H. Kronqvist P. Schroder H.D. Davies K.E. Voit T. Nielsen F.C. Engvall E. Wewer U.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 2467-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). With this in mind, we have therefore initiated in the present study a series of experiments to examine whether the regulation of utrophin A in vivo involves translational events. Generation of Reporter Constructs—To obtain the murine utrophin A 5′-UTR, reverse transcription and PCR experiments using total RNA obtained from C2C12 myotubes were carried out. The 5′ and 3′ primers amplified a 508-base pair fragment (5′ primer, 5′-GTTGTGGAGTCGCCCT-3′; 3′ primer, 5′-CCCCATACTTGGCCAT-3′) (15Weir A.P. Burton E.A. Harrod G. Davies K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45285-45290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This fragment was sequenced to confirm its identity. It was subsequently inserted into the multiple cloning site of pCMV SPORT-βGAL (Invitrogen) (called pβGAL here) to generate pUtrA/βGAL (see Fig. 1 for all plasmids used). The utrophin A 5′-UTR was also inserted into the XhoI site of the bicistronic vector pβGAL/CAT (28Holcik M. Lefebvre C. Yeh C.L. Chow T. Korneluk R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) to generate pβGAL/UtrA/CAT (see Fig. 1). The pβGAL/X-chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP)/CAT construct containing the ∼1-kb XIAP 5′-UTR (28Holcik M. Lefebvre C. Yeh C.L. Chow T. Korneluk R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) was used in our experiments as a control for IRES activity. The promoterless bicistronic constructs p(-cmv)βGAL/CAT and p(-cmv)βGAL/UtrA/CAT were created by removing the CMV promoter using NruI and HindIII restriction sites. Excision of the β-galactosidase gene was accomplished by cutting with NotI and religating to create the monocistronic pUtrA/CAT plasmid. Cell Culture—C2C12 myoblasts were cultured in growth media in 35-mm plates as previously described in detail elsewhere (29Gramolini A.O. Burton E.A. Tinsley J.M. Ferns M.J. Cartaud A. Cartaud J. Davies K.E. Lunde J.A. Jasmin B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 736-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected when they reached 60-80% confluence. Two μg of pβGAL and pUtrA/βGAL constructs were co-transfected with 2 μg of pCAT control vector (Promega, Mississauga, Canada) using 7.5 μl of Lipofectamine (2 mg/ml) (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfections using the bicistronic vectors were performed using 4 μg of plasmid with 8 μl of Lipofectamine (2 mg/ml). Cells were lysed 24 h after transfection using 400 μl of 1× reporter lysis buffer according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega), and the reporter activity was determined as described below. Direct Plasmid Injection and Cardiotoxin Treatment—For in vivo studies, 25 μl of cardiotoxin (Latoxan, Rosans, France) at 10-5m were injected into the right tibialis anterior (TA) muscle of 4-week-old C57BL/10 mice (Charles River Laboratories, St. Constant, Canada) to induce muscle degeneration and regeneration as previously described (23Gramolini A.O. Karpati G. Jasmin B.J. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 58: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Seven days later, cardiotoxin-treated and control, untreated TA muscles were excised and frozen in liquid nitrogen. For immunofluorescence experiments (see below), some TA muscles were frozen in melting isopentane precooled with liquid nitrogen. To examine the expression of the reporter constructs during muscle regeneration, 25 μl of plasmid at 2 μg/μl in PBS was directly injected in both regenerating and control TA muscles 3 days after cardiotoxin treatment. Four days later, TA muscles were excised and frozen in liquid nitrogen. TA muscles injected with plasmids were homogenized using a Polytron homogenizer in 1 ml of 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega), freeze-thawed twice, and centrifuged for 20 min at 12,000 × g. Supernatants were collected and frozen until further analysis. Reporter Assays—Assays for βGAL enzymatic activity were performed on homogenized TA muscles or C2C12 myoblast lysates using the β-galactosidase enzyme assay system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). CAT activity was measured by analyzing the conversion of chloramphenicol to butyryl chloramphenicol by incorporation of [14C]butyryl coenzyme A using the CAT enzyme kit (Promega). Counting was performed in a liquid scintillation counter (Wallac 1414 liquid scintillation counter with 1414 Winspectral Windows software). Background levels for both reporter assays were determined by analyzing reporter activity in nontransduced TA muscle and nontransfected C2C12 cells. RNA Extraction and RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from C2C12 cells or TA muscle using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. To quantitate the levels of endogenous transcripts in cardiotoxin-treated and untreated TA muscles, RT-PCR was performed to amplify utrophin A and S12 ribosomal RNA as previously described in detail elsewhere (18Chakkalakal J.V. Stocksley M.A. Harrison M.A. Angus L.M. Deschenes-Furry J. St. Pierre S. Megeney L.A. Chin E.R. Michel R.N. Jasmin B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7791-7796Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Negative controls consisted of RT mixtures in which total RNA was replaced by sterile, diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water. For quantitation of endogenous utrophin A mRNA and S12 ribosomal RNA levels, PCR products were separated on Vista Green (Amersham Biosciences)-containing agarose gels, and the intensity of the signal was quantitated using ImageQuant version 5.1 (Amersham Biosciences). The relative levels of utrophin A transcripts were standardized according to the amount of S12 ribosomal RNA levels present in the same samples. For RT-PCR analysis of reporter expression in transfected C2C12 cells and transduced TA muscles, Trizol-extracted RNA was first DNase I-treated (Invitrogen) for 1 h to eliminate plasmid contamination according to the manufacturer's instructions. For TA muscles injected with pβGAL and pUtrA/βGAL and co-transduced with pCAT, RT-PCR was carried out with primers to amplify a portion of CAT (5′-TGGCAATGAAAGACGGTGAG-3′; 5′-GAAAACGGGGGCGAAGAAGT-3′), and a portion of βGAL (5′-GTGACGGCAGTTATCTGG-3′; 5′-TTGGCAGTGCTCGTAGTA-3′) mRNAs. Negative controls consisted of an RT mixture that had the reverse transcriptase replaced with diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water. Denaturation was performed at 94 °C for 45 s, followed by an annealing step of 55 °C of 1 min and an extension step at 72 °C for 1 min for both βGAL and CAT PCRs. For βGAL amplification, 20-27 cycles were used for quantitative analysis, whereas 23-28 cycles were used for CAT. Cycling was followed by a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. It is important to note that for all RT-PCR experiments used to quantify the relative abundance of transcripts, cycle numbers were optimized to be within the linear range of amplification as previously described in detail (22Gramolini A.O.

To control for the presence of an intact bicistronic reporter transcript following C2C12 transfections and direct plasmid injection into TA muscles with pβGAL/CAT and pβGAL/UtrA/CAT plasmids, RT-PCR using total RNA was performed using a 5′ primer spanning 142 nucleotides of the LacZ gene and a 3′ primer spanning 459 nucleotides of the CAT gene that flanked the utrophin A 5′-UTR (5′-TTTTTCCCGATTTGGCTACA-3′; 5′-TGAAACTCACCCAGGGATTG-3′). This RT-PCR strategy is summarized in Fig. 6. The RT-PCR products were sub-cloned using the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) and sequenced to verify their identity. For quantitative RT-PCR, reverse transcription was carried out using the First-Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Amersham Biosciences) with NotI-d(T)18 primers. The quantitative real time RT-PCR was performed using the QuantiTect SYBR green RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) and analyzed on an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system using the ABI Prism 7000 SDS Software. Quantitative PCRs were carried out to detect βGAL (5′-ACTATCCCGACCGCCTTACT-3′;5′-CTGTAGCGGCTGATGTTGAA-3′) and CAT (5′-GCGTGTTACGGTGAAAACCT-3′; 5′-GGGCGAAGAAGTTGTCCATA-3′) for muscle samples transduced with the bicistronic vectors. In order to control for DNA contamination, quantitative PCRs were performed directly on RNA samples. Northern Blotting—For Northern blot analysis, electrophoresis of total RNA was performed using a denaturing agarose/formaldehyde gel followed by transfer onto a Hybond, positively charged nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) for 2.5 h using downward alkaline transfer. The membranes were preincubated for 4 h at 42°C in a shaking water bath with 10 ml of DIG easy hyb buffer (Roche Applied Science). The membrane was then incubated overnight with a linearized cDNA probe for CAT (301 bp) or βGAL (333 bp) labeled with Redivue [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) using the Rediprime II random prime labeling system (Amersham Biosciences). Washes were carried out for 1 × 5 min and 1 × 10 min at room temperature with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, and then for 1 × 2 min at 65 °C with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS. The blot was rinsed in 2× SSC and exposed to Kodak BioMax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Western Blotting—A polyclonal antibody directed against utrophin A was raised as previously described (18Chakkalakal J.V. Stocksley M.A. Harrison M.A. Angus L.M. Deschenes-Furry J. St. Pierre S. Megeney L.A. Chin E.R. Michel R.N. Jasmin B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7791-7796Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This utrophin A antibody was purified from production bleeds of antisera using the SulfoLink Kit (Pierce), according to the manufacturer's instructions. For Western blots, cardiotoxin-treated and untreated TA muscles from 4-week-old mice were homogenized in a previously described extraction buffer (32Lu J.Y. Schneider R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12974-12979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) using a Dounce homogenizer and then boiled and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g. One hundred μg of the protein extracts were separated using a 5% SDS-PAGE gel with a 4% stacking gel at 200 V for 5 h. Gels were transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were incubated with Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% dried skim milk for 1 h and then incubated for 1 h with the primary antibody (1:10,000) diluted in 5% milk Tris-buffered saline buffer. The membranes were washed thoroughly in Tris-buffered saline and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) secondary antibody (1:25,000) for 1 h. Protein detection was carried out using SuperSignal West Dura extended duration substrate (Pierce) and exposed to Kodak BioMAX MR film. The average intensities of the bands were quantitated using Kodak digital science 1D version 3.0.2 image analysis software. Equal loading of protein was confirmed with the SYPRO Ruby protein blot stain (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), as recommended by the manufacturer, and was further quantified using a monoclonal anti-actin antibody (Sigma). Immunofluorescence—Immunofluorescence experiments were performed as previously described (18Chakkalakal J.V. Stocksley M.A. Harrison M.A. Angus L.M. Deschenes-Furry J. St. Pierre S. Megeney L.A. Chin E.R. Michel R.N. Jasmin B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7791-7796Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Briefly, the polyclonal anti-utrophin A antibody was used to identify utrophin A expression on longitudinal sections of untreated or cardiotoxin-treated TA muscles. Alexa 488-conjugated α-bungarotoxin 594 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) was used to label acetylcholine receptors and, hence, to identify the presence of neuromuscular junctions. Statistical Analysis—The presence of significant differences between group means was determined using Student's t test. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05. Means ± S.E. are shown throughout. Discordant Expression of Utrophin A and Its mRNA in Regenerating Muscle—Treatment of skeletal muscle with the snake venom cardiotoxin induces severe myonecrosis and subsequent muscle regeneration while leaving the innervating nerve intact. This is a well established model to study muscle regeneration (33Charge S.B. Rudnicki M.A. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 209-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (2001) Google Scholar, 34Yan Z. Choi S. Liu X.

Under these conditions, we have previously shown that the content of total utrophin (using an antibody that recognized both utrophin A and B isoforms) is significantly up-regulated several days after cardiotoxin treatment (23Gramolini A.O. Karpati G. Jasmin B.J. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 58: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Here, we examined the specific effect of cardiotoxin treatment on expression of the utrophin A isoform, which is selectively expressed in skeletal muscle (15Weir A.P. Burton E.A. Harrod G. Davies K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45285-45290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 18Chakkalakal J.V. Stocksley M.A. Harrison M.A. Angus L.M. Deschenes-Furry J.

Western blot analysis of muscles treated with cardiotoxin for 3-10 days revealed that the greatest levels of utrophin A expression were obtained at 7 days after cardiotoxin treatment. At this time point, we found that utrophin A expression was increased ∼14-fold (p < 0.05) compared with untreated control muscles (Fig. 2, A and B). Immunofluorescence experiments revealed that whereas utrophin A expression in control muscles is confined to neuromuscular junctions (Fig. 3, A and B) (10Ohlendieck K. Ervasti J.M. Matsumura K.

However, in sharp contrast to this dramatic induction of protein, utrophin A mRNA levels were modestly increased in regenerating muscle (40% increase; Fig. 2C). This relatively small increase in the abundance of utrophin A mRNA is in stark contrast to the dramatic increase in protein levels, thereby suggesting that changes in protein stability and/or in the translational efficiency of utrophin A mRNA could have an important regulatory function.FIGURE 3Utrophin A is expressed in extrasynaptic regions during muscle regeneration. Immunofluorescence experiments performed with longitudinal sections of TA muscles using a utrophin A-specific antibody. A and B show the localization of utrophin A in the synaptic regions of control muscle fibers. The arrows identify neuromuscular junction regions as identified by α-bungarotoxin staining of the acetylcholine receptor. C and D show the absence of utrophin A labeling in the extrajunctional regions of normal muscle fibers.

Scale bar, 50 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Utrophin A 5′-UTR Confers Translational Regulation—On the basis of these findings, we next examined the possibility that utrophin is translationally regulated and decided to specifically assess whether mechanisms involving the utrophin A 5′-UTR could account for the discrepancy between the levels of protein and transcript observed during muscle regeneration. To this end, we isolated the murine utrophin A 5′-UTR from total RNA obtained from C2C12 myogenic cells and found that it was relatively long (15Weir A.P. Burton E.A. Harrod G. Davies K.E. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2068412376,"Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP+) has been identified as a novel second messenger triggering Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. Here we report that murine cortical astrocytes in culture and in acute slices respond with transient intracellular Ca2+ increases to extracellularly applied NAADP+ and express the NAADP+ -producing enzyme CD38. The Ca2+ transients triggered by NAADP+ occurred with an average delay of 35 s as compared with ATP-triggered Ca2+ signaling, suggesting that NAADP+ may have to enter the cell to act. Blockage of connexin hemichannels (a possible entry route for NAADP+ into the cell) reduced the number of astrocytes responding to NAADP+. Disruption of lysosomes as the suggested site of NAADP+ receptors reduced the number of astrocytes responding to NAADP+ strongly. The NAADP+ -triggered Ca2+ signal also depended on intact endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores linked to activation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors and on the activity of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Adenosine receptor-mediated signaling contributes to the NAADP+ -evoked signal, since it is strongly reduced by the adenosine receptor blocker CGS-15943. Moreover, NAADP+ triggered responses in all other cell types (cultured cerebellar neurons, microglia, and oligodendrocytes) of the central nervous system.

Moreover, NAADP+ triggered responses in all other cell types (cultured cerebellar neurons, microglia, and oligodendrocytes) of the central nervous system. Astrocytes are in intimate contact with neurons, in particular with synapses, and are able to sense, react to, and even influence neuronal activity. The astrocytic response to neuronal activity can be most readily detected by observing changes in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration mediated via transmitter receptors (e.g. glutamate, GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid), or acetylcholine) or via other messengers, such as nitric oxide. Ca2+ increases can occur by Ca2+ influx via the plasma membrane as found for the nitric oxide-mediated neuron-glia signaling in the cerebellum (1Matyash V. Filippov V. Mohrhagen K. Kettenmann H. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2001; 18: 664-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Ca2+ can furthermore be released from intracellular stores by activation of metabotropic receptors such as GABAB receptors, which mediate neuron-glia signaling in the hippocampus (2Kang J. Jiang L. Goldman S.A. Nedergaard M. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Indeed, astrocytes express a variety of receptors linked to the Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores (3Verkhratsky A. Orkand R.K. Kettenmann H. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 99-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). To produce specific signals with one and the same messenger (Ca2+), several second messenger pathways and different sources of Ca2+ are involved. It seems important, at the current stage, to decipher the astrocytic Ca2+ code, since this would lead to further understanding of how these cells can react to and influence the neuronal network. The best investigated second messenger linking activation of metabotropic receptors and Ca2+ release is inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). 2The abbreviations and trivial names used are: IP3inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphatecADPRcyclic ADP-riboseNAADP+nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphateNAADnicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphateHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyGPNglycyl-l-phenylalanine 2-naphthylamideFCSfetal calf serumPBphosphate bufferTTXtetrodotoxintACPDtrans-(1S,3R)-1-amino-1,3-cyclopentanedicarboxylic acidCGS15943,9-chloro-2-(2-furanyl)-(1,2,4)triazolo[1,5-c]quinazolin-5-amine;DHPG,(S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine2-APB2-aminoethoxydiphenylborane. 2The abbreviations and trivial names used are: IP3inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphatecADPRcyclic ADP-riboseNAADP+nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphateNAADnicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphateHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyGPNglycyl-l-phenylalanine 2-naphthylamideFCSfetal calf serumPBphosphate bufferTTXtetrodotoxintACPDtrans-(1S,3R)-1-amino-1,3-cyclopentanedicarboxylic acidCGS15943,9-chloro-2-(2-furanyl)-(1,2,4)triazolo[1,5-c]quinazolin-5-amine;DHPG,(S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine2-APB2-aminoethoxydiphenylborane. The importance of other intracellular messengers, such as cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR), is less well understood (4Guse A.H. Curr. Mol. Med. 2004; 4: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) or still hypothetical as for the two sphingomyelin metabolites sphingosine 1-phosphate (5Spiegel S. Milstien S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar) and sphingosylphosphorylcholine (6Meyer zu H.D. Himmel H.M. Jakobs K.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 178-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Almost a decade ago, a novel intracellular Ca2+-releasing second messenger was identified in sea urchin eggs, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP+) (7Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), which binds to an unknown receptor. Since its discovery, there is increasing evidence that NAADP+ also has a physiological role in Ca2+ signal transduction in vertebrates, including mammalian cells (8Cancela J.M. Charpentier G. Petersen O.H. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2003; 446: 322-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the vertebrate nervous system, intracellular Ca2+ release by NAADP+ has only been demonstrated from rat brain microsome preparations (9Bak J. White P. Timar G. Missiaen L. Genazzani A.A. Galione A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 751-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and in frog motoneurons (10Brailoiu E. Miyamoto M.D. Dun N.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 718-724PubMed Google Scholar). NAADP+ -specific binding sites are found in gray and white matter of rat brain, but the cellular specificity of the binding site has not yet been determined (11Patel S. Churchill G.C. Sharp T.

Chem. 2000; 275: 36495-36497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate cyclic ADP-ribose nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate high pressure liquid chromatography glycyl-l-phenylalanine 2-naphthylamide fetal calf serum phosphate buffer tetrodotoxin trans-(1S,3R)-1-amino-1,3-cyclopentanedicarboxylic acid 15943,9-chloro-2-(2-furanyl)-(1,2,4)triazolo[1,5-c]quinazolin-5-amine;DHPG,(S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborane. inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate cyclic ADP-ribose nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate high pressure liquid chromatography glycyl-l-phenylalanine 2-naphthylamide fetal calf serum phosphate buffer tetrodotoxin trans-(1S,3R)-1-amino-1,3-cyclopentanedicarboxylic acid 15943,9-chloro-2-(2-furanyl)-(1,2,4)triazolo[1,5-c]quinazolin-5-amine;DHPG,(S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborane. The major way of NAADP+ synthesis in mammalian tissue takes place under acidic conditions and in the presence of nicotinic acid from NADP+ by the type II transmembrane glycoprotein ADP-ribosyl cyclase CD38. In a neutral or alkaline environment, CD38 exclusively catalyzes the conversion of NAD+ into cADPR (12Aarhus R. Graeff R.M. Dickey D.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30327-30333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Apart from cell membrane localization, CD38 has been located to various intracellular organelle membranes and can moreover be internalized by endocytosis (13Zocchi E. Usai C. Guida L. Franco L. Bruzzone S. Passalacqua M. De Flora A. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Therefore, NAADP+ synthesis most likely takes place in membranes of intracellular acidic organelles such as lysosomes or late endosomes, whereas CD38 in the plasma membrane synthesizes cADPR. Regarding the mammalian central nervous system, CD38 expression was demonstrated in the rat cerebral and cerebellar cortex for neurons and astrocytes by immunoelectron microscopy (14Yamada M. Mizuguchi M. Otsuka N. Ikeda K. Takahashi H. Brain Res. 1997; 756: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Also, cultured rat hippocampal astrocytes are immunopositive for CD38, with plasma membrane staining and staining in the perinuclear Golgi region (15Verderio C. Bruzzone S. Zocchi E. Fedele E. Schenk U. De Flora A. Matteoli M. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 646-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CD38 activity could be detected in rat cortical astrocytic cultures and their membrane preparations, where activity was also found intracellularly (16Hotta T. Asai K. Fujita K. Kato T. Higashida H. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 669-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), in rat hippocampal astrocytic cultures (15Verderio C. Bruzzone S. Zocchi E. Fedele E. Schenk U. De Flora A. Matteoli M. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 646-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and in mouse (17Ceni C. Pochon N. Brun V. Muller-Steffner H. Andrieux A. Grunwald D. Schuber F. De Waard M. Lund F. Villaz M. Moutin M.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 175-183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and rat brain homogenates (18Chini E.N. Dousa T.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). NAADP+ as an intracellular messenger acts at very low concentrations. The cytoplasmic concentration has been determined for human red blood cells to be as low as ∼60 nm (19Churamani D. Carrey E.A. Dickinson G.D. Patel S. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In contrast to invertebrate cells, where NAADP+ binding is irreversible and the receptor is inactivated even at subthreshold concentrations (20Aarhus R. Dickey D.M. Graeff R.M. Gee K.R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8513-8516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), NAADP+ binding is reversible in mammalian cells, and the receptor is only inactivated at high concentrations (∼50-100 μm) (8Cancela J.M. Charpentier G. Petersen O.H. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2003; 446: 322-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The intracellular Ca2+ stores sensitive to NAADP+ were in most studies in cell-free systems different from the thapsigargin-sensitive stores, which respond to IP3 and cADPR (21Lee H.C. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1133-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), although there is one report in which NAADP+ appears capable to release Ca2+ directly from the nuclear envelope by acting on ryanodine receptors, a process that is thapsigargin-sensitive (22Gerasimenko J. Maruyama Y. Tepikin A. Petersen O.H. Gerasimenko O. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 76-78Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NAADP+- induced Ca2+ signaling can be abolished by glycyl-l-phenylalanine 2-naphthylamide (GPN), a substrate of lysosomal cathepsin C whose hydrolysis leads to the specific osmotic lysis of lysosomes, which can also function as Ca2+ stores (23Churchill G.C. Okada Y. Thomas J.M. Genazzani A.A. Patel S. Galione A. Cell. 2002; 111: 703-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). In intact cells, both types of stores interact, and it was suggested that the NAADP+- activated stores serve to prime the other stores and are involved in initiating Ca2+ oscillations then maintained by IP3 and cADPR (24Cancela J.M. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Nature. 1999; 398: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). In addition, there is evidence for Ca2+ influx in response to NAADP+ (25Moccia F. Lim D. Nusco G.A. Ercolano E. Santella L. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1907-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The general aim of this study was to investigate whether extracellularly applied NAADP+ could elicit Ca2+ signaling in intact cells of the mouse central nervous system, specifically in astrocytes. In most studies carried out with intact cells so far, NAADP+ was injected into single cells (7Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) or released intracellularly by flash photolysis of the caged compound (26Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Gee K.R. Kestner T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4172-4178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In one case, application of extracellular NAADP+ was tested on starfish oocytes, but no Ca2+ rise was detected (27Santella L. Kyozuka K. Genazzani A.A. De Riso L. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8301-8306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We showed for the first time that all cell types of the murine central nervous system are able to respond to extracellular NAADP+. Aware of the fact that there is no physiological evidence for an extracellular action of NAADP+, it was applied extracellularly at relatively high concentration, assuming its uptake into the cells. Similarly, cADPR, the other product of CD38, or its precursor, NAD+, could be applied extracellularly and was effective in evoking Ca2+ responses in cultured astrocytes (15Verderio C. Bruzzone S. Zocchi E. Fedele E. Schenk U. De Flora A. Matteoli M. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 646-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and Müller cells (28Esguerra M. Miller R.F. Glia. 2002; 39: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Animals, Preparation of Brain Slices—For slice preparation, 10-14-day old mice (NMRI mice) were decapitated, and their brains were removed. Cortical slices of 250 μm thickness were cut in ice-cold bicarbonate buffer (134 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1.3 mm MgCl2, 26 mm NaHCO3, 1.25 mm K2HPO4, and 10 mm glucose) using a vibratome (VT 1000 S; Leica, Heidelberg, Germany). By gassing with carbogen, the pH was adjusted to 7.4. Slices were stored at room temperature in gassed buffer for at least 45 min prior to staining. Glial Culture Preparations—Cultures were prepared from the brains of newborn NMRI mice as described previously (29Lyons S.A. Kettenmann H. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1998; 18: 521-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) with small modifications. For cortical astrocyte cultures, only the cortex was used, whereas for the preparation of microglial and oligodendrocyte cultures, the whole brain was taken. Briefly, brain tissue was freed from blood vessels and meninges, trypsinized, and gently triturated with a fire-polished pipette in the presence of 0.05% DNase (Worthington). After washing twice, cells were cultured in 75-cm2 flasks and for astrocyte cultures also directly plated on poly-l-lysine (100 μg/ml; Sigma)-coated glass coverslips (∅ 15 mm) at densities of 3-5 × 104 cells/coverslip, kept in ∅-10-cm-dishes using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. One day later, cultures were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution to remove cellular debris. To obtain astrocytic cultures, the cells were maintained for 4 days, and after reaching a subconfluent state, microglial cells and oligodendrocytes as well as their early precursors were dislodged by manual shaking and removed by washing with Hanks' balanced salt solution. The purity of the astrocytes was routinely determined by immunofluorescence using an antibody against glial fibrillary acidic protein (Sigma), a specific astrocytic marker. The cultures typically showed more than 90% cells positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein. To obtain microglial and oligodendrocytic cultures, mixed glial cells were maintained longer (9-12 days) with medium changes every third day until the astrocytes were confluent. Microglial cells were then separated from the underlying astrocytic monolayer by gently shaking the bottles for 1 h at 37°C in a shaker-incubator (100 rpm). The microglia were seeded on glass coverslips at a density of 5 × 104 cells/coverslip, kept in four-well Nunc culture plates. Cultures usually contained >95% microglial cells, as revealed by staining with Griffonia simplicifolia isolectin B4 (Sigma), a marker for microglia. Cultures were used for experiments 1-5 days after plating. Oligodendrocytes and their early precursors were then dislodged from the astrocytic monolayer by strong manual shaking and plated on poly-l-lysine (20 μg/ml)-coated glass coverslips at densities of 3-5 × 104 cells/coverslip, kept in ∅-10-cm-dishes in SATO medium supplemented with 2% FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Without additional growth factors, most precursors develop into oligodendrocytes, which begin to mature within a few days. Cerebellar Neuron Preparation—Cerebellar neurons were prepared from 5-day-old NMRI mice as described by Schnitzer and Schachner (30Schnitzer J. Schachner M. J. Neuroimmunol. 1981; 1: 471-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, neurons were dissociated from freshly dissected cerebelli by mechanical disruption in the presence of trypsin (Roche Applied Science) and DNase in HANKS (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany). Afterwards, neurons were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated (100 μg/ml) glass coverslips, kept in ∅-10-cm-dishes at a density of 3 × 105 cells/coverslip in basal medium Eagle, 10% FCS, 25 mm KCl, 32 mm glucose. After 1 day, the culture medium was changed to SATO medium supplemented with 2% FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and cytosine arabinoside (10 μm; Sigma) was added to prevent proliferation of glial cells. Experiments started a week after plating. Cell Lines—The mouse glioma cell line GL261 was purchased from NCI-Frederick, and the 1321N1 human astrocytoma cell line was a kind gift of Georg Reiser (Institut für Neurobiochemie, Universität Magdeburg, Germany). Cell lines were kept in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in 75-cm2 flasks. The cell line GL261 was stably transfected with the red fluorescent protein dsRedII (BD Bioscience, Heidelberg, Germany), and Geneticin (G-418 sulfate; Invitrogen) was added to their medium at a concentration of 0.15 mg/ml for selection of dsRed-positive cells. Medium was changed twice a week, and cells were split after reaching confluence, usually once a week. Cells were plated on coverslips, which were kept in ∅-10-cm dishes at a density of 4 × 105 cells/coverslip. They were washed to remove cellular debris the day after plating. All cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2. Cell media and supplements were purchased from Invitrogen if not stated otherwise. Ca2+ Imaging—Slices were incubated with the Ca2+ indicator dyes Fluo-4-acetoxymethylester (10 μm; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) in bicarbonate buffer containing 0.02% Pluronic-127 (Molecular Probes) at room temperature for 40-50 min followed by 10-15 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Slices were transferred to a perfusion chamber on an upright microscope (Axioskop FS, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with a ×20 water immersion objective (UMPlanFl; numeric aperture 0.5; Olympus, Hamburg, Germany) and fixed in the chamber using a U-shaped platinum wire with a grid of nylon threads. Slices were superfused with gassed bicarbonate buffer at a flow rate of 4-6 ml/min. Substances were applied by changing the perfusate. Intracellular Ca2+ changes were detected using either a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Sarastro 2000; Molecular Dynamics) with an open pinhole or a conventional imaging system with a cooled CCD camera (SensiCam; PCO, Kelheim, Germany). As a light source for fluorophore excitation, we used the 488-nm band of an Ar+/Kr+ laser for the laser-scanning microscope or a monochromator set to 488 nm for the imaging system (Till Photonics, München, Germany). Emission was detected with a 510-nm-long pass filter. Due to the scanning rate of the confocal microscope, the sampling rate was limited to 0.25 Hz, whereas with the CCD camera, 0.5 Hz was achieved. Images were stored on a PC and processed with conventional software (ImagePro; Media Cybernetics). The magnitudes of Ca2+ concentration changes were detected by temporal analysis of single cells and expressed as fluorescence intensity ratios F/F0. The resting fluorescence value F0 was determined at the beginning of each experiment. To study the effect of drugs on NAADP+ signaling, we applied NAADP+ twice, separated by a washout and/or drug preincubation interval of at least 10 min. The response of a given slice during the second NAADP+ application in the presence of a drug was then compared with the response during the first “control” NAADP+ application with regard to the responding cell population and the amplitude of the Ca2+ responses. All experiments were carried out at room temperature. Cultured or acutely isolated cells were plated on glass coverslips, loaded with Fluo-4-acetoxymethylester (5 μm for 30 min at room temperature in HEPES (150 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 0.83 mm MgSO4, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm glucose adjusted to pH 7.4) containing 0.01% Pluronic-127 (Molecular Probes)). Subsequently, cells were washed and kept in bath solution (HEPES) for 15-20 min prior to experiments. All other procedures were identical with the description for brain slices. Immunohistochemistry—Mice were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/kg body weight; Sanofi, Paris, France), and perfused intracardially with a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (PB; pH 7.4). Brains were dissected out and postfixed for 24 h at 4 °C in the same fixative. Subsequently, they were transferred to a 20% sucrose-containing PB and incubated for several days. Brains were quickly frozen in isopentane cooled by dry ice. Cryosections (16 μm thick) were mounted on gelatin-coated slides, allowed to dry for at least 30 min at room temperature, and then stored at -80 °C. After thawing, sections were postfixed for 15 min with 4% PA and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PB for 15 min and incubated in blocking buffer (0.5% bovine serum albumin, 1% horse serum, 4% normal goat serum, 0.01% Triton X-100 in PB) for 45 min at room temperature. Rabbit anti S-100β antibodies (Swant, Bellinzona, Switzerland) were diluted 1:500 (in PB, 1% bovine serum albumin, 1% horse serum) and incubated with the sections for 5 h at room temperature. Sections were washed with PB and then incubated with 1:20 diluted purified rat anti-mouse CD38 monoclonal antibody (Cedarlane, Ontario, Canada) overnight. Sections were again washed with PB followed by incubation with the two secondary antibodies Cy2-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) (1:100 dilution; Jackson/Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) for αS-100 antibody and Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rat IgG (H + L) (1:200 dilution; Molecular Probes) for αCD38 antibody detection for 5 h at room temperature. After three washes, sections were mounted with CitiFluor (Agar Scientific, Stansted, Essex, UK) and inspected with the confocal microscope described above. Specificity of immunoreactivity was controlled by incubation of tissue sections in dilution buffer instead of primary antibodies. In these control experiments, the immunocytochemical reactions were always negative. Cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, washed with TBS (150 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4), permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100 in TBS, and incubated in a blocking solution (TBS plus 5% bovine serum albumin and 5% normal goat serum) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were incubated at 4 °C with rabbit anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein antibodies (Sigma) for 1 h. Then the cells were washed with TBS plus 0.5% Tween 20 and incubated with the secondary antibody Alexa-568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) (Molecular Probes) for 1 h and washed again. As a control, cells were incubated in buffer without primary antibodies followed by incubation in secondary antibody solution. Cells were mounted by the ProLong Antifade Kit (Molecular Probes). Solutions and Chemicals—Drugs were applied with the bath solution in the following concentrations: 10 μm adenosine, 100 μm ATP, 100 μm carbenoxolone, 10 μm 9-chloro-2-(2-furanyl)-(1,2,4)triazolo-[1,5-c]quinazolin-5-amine (CGS-15943), 1000 μm EGTA, 200 μm GPN, 5 μm NAAD, 5/25 μm NAADP+, 5 μm NADP+, 20 μm DHPG, 50 μm tACPD, 1 μm thapsigargin, all purchased from Sigma, and 100 μm 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborane (2-APB), 1 μm tetrodotoxin (TTX), 100 μm verapamil, purchased from Tocris. All ingredients of buffers were purchased from Sigma, except for K2HPO4 and glucose, which were from Merck. Statistical Analysis—The population of cells within a slice, which responded during application of NAADP+, was determined for both the “control” administration and the administration in the presence of a drug, and both were compared; the number of cells responding the second time was expressed as percentage of the number of cells responding the first time. It was distinguished between cells that reacted both times or only the second. The results for a given condition obtained from the different slices were averaged. As a second measure, an activity parameter was evaluated and compared for the first and the second response: the “Ca2+ signaling activity.” It was defined as the average change in the F/F0 value of single cells between two consecutive images (equal to 4.5 s) within a set time frame of about 2 min during an NAADP+ application. The Ca2+ signaling activity during the first and second NAADP+ application was then compared for cells that reacted both times; each cell's activity during the second NAADP+ application was expressed as a percentage of that during the first. Then it was averaged for cells within one slice, and subsequently results from the different slices were averaged for a given condition. All values are expressed as mean ± S.D. Means and S.D. were calculated with Excel (Microsoft, Silicon Valley, CA). Further statistical analysis of the data was performed with the SPSS software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). The multiple Kruskal-Wallis Test was used to test for significant differences between all groups within one set of groups (four sets; cell numbers and average F/F0 amplitude change or maximal amplitudes for both the NAADP+ and control experiments, respectively) and if it was positive, each group was separately compared with its respective control by the paired Mann-Whitney Test. Significance was defined as p < 0.05. NAADP+ Induced Different Types of Ca2+ Responses in Astrocytes—We tested whether extracellularly applied NAADP+ induced Ca2+ signaling in cortical astrocytes in acute brain slices of 10-14-day-old mice. By an appropriate protocol, we preferentially loaded the Ca2+ sensor Fluo-4-acetoxymethylester into astrocytes (31Peters O. Schipke C.G. Hashimoto Y. Kettenmann H. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 9888-9896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Superfusion with NAADP+ (5 μm, duration of application 2-3 min) triggered an increase in Fluo-4 fluorescence, reflecting the change in [Ca2+]i in astrocytes (Fig. 1). The time course of the response showed considerable variations; single, transient responses, oscillations, a sustained elevated level, and oscillations followed by an elevated level were observed (n = 74 slices, ∅ cell number per slice = 21 ± 10; Fig. 1, A (bottom) and B). Generally, the Ca2+ responses already declined with time of NAADP+ application, and we did not observe any specific effect of the washout. Oscillations had an average frequency of 1.9 ± 0.7 transients/min (for analysis: 59 oscillating cells from 21 slices). There was a considerable delay of 64 ± 17 s between the application of NAADP+ to the slice and the Ca2+ response (n = 11 slices, ∅ cell number per slice = 18 ± 9). To estimate whether this delay exceeded the time required for the substance to simply reach the astrocytic membranes within the slice, we applied ATP (100 μm) to activate cell membrane-located purinergic receptors. This led to a more rapid Ca2+ response with a 20 ± 9-s delay (n = 11 slices, ∅ cell number per slice = 16 ± 7). This difference was also confirmed with experiments in which NAADP+ and ATP were applied to the same slice, separated by a 10-min washout. The NAADP+ response occurred 32 ± 3 s (n = 5 slices, ∅ cell number per slice = 69 ± 25) later as compared with the ATP response.

https://openalex.org/W2023547728,"Tristetraprolin (TTP), a member of the tandem CCCH zinc finger protein family, promotes deadenylation of tumor necrosis factor-α and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor mRNAs after binding to the AU-rich elements (ARE) in their 3′-untranslated regions. The high affinity TTP-ARE binding occurs between the tandem zinc finger domain and the preferred nonamer UUAUUUAUU. By mutating a well defined core sequence of 24 bases from the tumor necrosis factor-α ARE, we compared the influence of four possible nonameric TTP-binding sites in the wild-type ARE with that of a single binding site in the mutated probe on the binding of TTP to the RNA and the subsequent deadenylation of the poly(A) tail. By inserting this 24-base ARE into an otherwise stable transcript, we also attempted to determine the extent of the instability conferred by the presence of one or two TTP-binding sites. These sites were created or modified by mutating the As in the UUAUUUAUU nonamer or by changing the central U in the nonamer, in both cases to C residues. The results suggest that even a single nonamer TTP-binding site can confer at least partial sensitivity to the TTP-mediated mRNA turnover on an otherwise stable mRNA, but that two binding sites make the transcript much more unstable. Even though the central U of the nonamer binding site was predicted by structural studies possibly to permit base substitution, mutation of this U to C greatly inhibited the binding of TTP to the ARE, thus reducing the ability of the TTP to promote deadenylation and instability of the mRNA.

Tristetraprolin (TTP) 2The abbreviations used are: TTP, tristetraprolin; TNF, tumor necrosis factor α; GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; ARE, AU-rich elements; TZF, tandem zinc finger; MLP, MARCKS-like protein; HA, influenza hemagglutinin; MARCKS, myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate; UTR, untranslated region; ELAV, embryonic lethal abnormal visual system; CMV, cytomegalovirus; BS+, Bluescribe + vector. is a member of a small family of three tandem CCCH zinc finger proteins in man that can bind to AU-rich elements in single-stranded mRNA and promote the successive deadenylation and degradation of those RNA species (for review see Ref. 1Blackshear P.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 945-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Experiments in TTP knock-out mice and cells derived from them demonstrated that tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) transcripts were physiological targets for TTP-mediated destruction (2Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Blood. 2000; 95: 1891-1899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both transcripts contain the so-called class 2 AU-rich elements (ARE) (4Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar), and TTP was shown to bind to these elements through its tandem zinc finger (TZF) domain (2Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). This binding is thought to be the first step in the process of subsequent transcript deadenylation and destruction. More recently, details of the minimal ARE sequence required for TTP binding have emerged. For example, Worthington et al. (6Worthington M.T. Pelo J.W. Sachedina M.A. Applegate J.L. Arseneau K.O. Pizarro T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48558-48564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) demonstrated through random selection procedures that the optimum minimum binding site was the nonamer UUAUUUAUU. By using a synthetic 73-amino acid peptide comprising the TTP TZF domain, we showed that the same nonamer was necessary for high affinity binding to the synthetic peptide, and that a 24-base RNA oligonucleotide derived from the TNF mRNA ARE could bind 2 mol of peptide/mol of RNA at two tandem nonamer binding sites (7Blackshear P.J. Lai W.S. Kennington E.A. Brewer G. Wilson G.M. Guan X. Zhou P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19947-19955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In the same paper, we showed by HSQC NMR analyses that the same nonamer represented the minimum ARE-binding site oligonucleotide required for a characteristic conformational shift of the TTP peptide, and that even minor shortening of the oligonucleotide resulted in changes in the peptide-RNA complex conformation. Similarly, by using a solution binding assay with the same synthetic 73-amino acid TTP TZF peptide, Brewer et al. (8Brewer B.Y. Malicka J. Blackshear P.J. Wilson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27870-27877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) found that shortening the UUAUUUAUU nonamer to a UAUUUAU heptamer increased the Kd from 3.0 to 19 nm. On the other hand, lengthening the nonamer by adding two Us to each end did not affect the binding affinity. Very recently, Hudson et al. (9Hudson B.P. Martinez-Yamout M.A. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) solved an NMR structure for the TZF domain of the TTP family member TIS11D (ZFP36L2), which is 73% identical to the TTP TZF domain over the 64 amino acids of the core TZF domain, in complex with the same UUAUUUAUU nonamer. They found that this nonamer bound to the TZF domain peptide in the absence of RNA secondary structure, suggesting that the RNA primary sequence is the critical determinant of effective binding. They also noted that the first U residue in the nonamer was unstructured in the complex, perhaps allowing for substitutions at that site in naturally occurring AREs. We used the coordinates of this complex to model the human TTP TZF domain in complex with the same oligonucleotide, and we found that the amino acid residues in contact with the RNA were identical in the two proteins, increasing the likelihood that this modeled TTP TZF domain-RNA complex is valid (10Carrick D.M. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Arthritis Res. Ther. 2004; 6: 248-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). An important question that arises is: What is the relative contribution of each ARE nonameric TTP-binding site to TTP-mediated RNA turn-over in naturally occurring mRNAs? In one naturally occurring target, the TNF mRNA, there are often five partly overlapping nonamers in the mammalian transcripts, with some variation among mammalian species (10Carrick D.M. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Arthritis Res. Ther. 2004; 6: 248-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). There are fewer nonamers in the GM-CSF mRNA, and in the most common mammalian pattern, three nonamers overlap significantly (10Carrick D.M. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Arthritis Res. Ther. 2004; 6: 248-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Perhaps coincidentally, GM-CSF mRNA in bone marrow-derived stromal cells has a half-life of 99 min (3Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Blood. 2000; 95: 1891-1899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas TNF in bone marrow-derived macrophages from normal mice has a half-life of 39 min (2Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The main objective of the present study was to determine whether an individual TTP-binding site conferred instability on an otherwise stable transcript, and whether two tandem binding sites conferred even greater instability. We used a well defined core sequence of 24 bases from the mouse TNF ARE, which in its unmutated state is able to bind two tandem molecules of TTP TZF peptide per molecule of RNA (7Blackshear P.J. Lai W.S. Kennington E.A. Brewer G. Wilson G.M. Guan X. Zhou P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19947-19955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This core sequence was then mutated at one or both of the As in the nonamer, or the central Us, to permit 2, 1, or 0 mol/mol of peptide binding, and the effects of these mutations were evaluated in cell co-transfection assays with full-length TTP and in cell-free deadenylation assays. The results suggest that even a single nonamer TTP-binding site can confer some instability on an otherwise stable mRNA, but that two makes the transcript much more unstable. In addition, they indicate the importance of the central U residues in binding of TTP to RNA. This binding and the ability of the TTP to degrade RNA were greatly decreased when these U residues were changed to Cs, even though the central U residue (U5), like the terminal U9, is thought to form only a single hydrogen bond with an amino acid in the protein (9Hudson B.P. Martinez-Yamout M.A. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), and thus might be assumed to be replaceable with minimal loss of activity. Expression plasmids CMV·hTTP·tag and its tandem zinc finger (TZF) domain alone (CMV·hTTP-(97-173)·tag) were made as described (11Lai W.S. Carballo E. Thorn J.M. Kennington E.A. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17827-17837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The CMV·HuR·tag, which expresses the widely expressed human ELAV-like HuR protein (12Ma W.J. Cheng S. Campbell C. Wright A. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8144-8151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar), was constructed as follows. A cDNA coding for the open reading frame of HuR was made using reverse transcription-PCR from HeLa cell total RNA. The 5′ primer for the PCR amplification was 5′-ACGTggtaccACAATGTCTAATGGTTATGAAGACC-3′, and the 3′ primer was 5′-AAGctcgagTTAAGCGTAATCCGGGACGTCGTATGGGTATTTGTGGGACTTGTTGG-3′, where the lowercase letters indicate the restriction sites for Asp718 and XhoI, respectively. The underlined letters represent the initiator methionine (5′ primer) and the stop codon (3′ primer). The italic letters in the 3′ primer encode the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope. The resulting PCR product was digested with the restriction enzymes and ligated into the Asp718 and XhoI sites of the expression vector CMV·BHG3′/BS+ (5Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). The sequence of the HuR insert corresponds to bp 116-1196, from -3 bp before the start codon to the last amino acid, of GenBank™ accession number U38175. CMV·HuB·FLAG, which expresses the human ELAV-like neuronal protein 1(Hel-N1, HuB), was made by PCR using a plasmid kindly provided by Dr. Jack Keene, Duke University (13Levine T.D. Gao F. King P.H. Andrews L.G. Keene J.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 3494-3504Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), as a template. The 5′ primer for the PCR amplification was 5′-ACGTggtaccATGGAAACACAACTGTCTAATGG-3′, and the 3′ primer was 5′-AAGctcgagTTACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAATCGGCTTTGTGCGTTTTGTTTGTC-3′, where the lowercase letters indicate the restriction sites for Asp718 and XhoI, respectively. The underlined letters represent the initiator methionine codon (5′ primer) and the stop codon (3′ primer). The italic letters in the 3′ primer encode the FLAG epitope. The resulting PCR product was digested with the restriction enzymes and ligated into the Asp718 and XhoI sites of the expression vector CMV·BHG3′/BS+. The insert sequence of HuB corresponds to bp 585-1661 (from the initiation codon to the last amino acid) of GenBank™ accession number U12431. The correct sequences of both the HuR·tag and HuB·FLAG DNA inserts were confirmed by dRhodamine terminator cycle sequencing (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Preparation of RNA Probes—Plasmid pTNFα-(1309-1332) (bp 1309-1332 of GenBank™ accession number X02611) and plasmid TNFα-(1309-1332) (A)50/SK- were constructed as described (5Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 14Lai W.S. Kennington E.A. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 3798-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). To make the mutant TNFα-(1309-1332) (A)50 probes, a series of double-stranded oligonucleotides that encoded the corresponding RNA sequences listed in Fig. 1A was made to substitute for the wild-type TNFα-(1309-1332) sequence in the EcoRV and XbaI sites of pTNFα-(1309-1332) (A)50/SK-. The templates for probes were PCR-amplified (primers M13 forward and T50Xba) from the plasmids and were sequenced to verify the 3′ ends, as described (14Lai W.S. Kennington E.A. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 3798-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The template for probe ARE was prepared by linearizing plasmid pTNFα-(1309-1332) with XbaI, and for probe V by linearizing vector SK-. The RNA probes were transcribed in the presence of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol). Linearized plasmids or PCR amplification products were used as templates, and the Promega riboprobe in vitro transcription systems protocol was employed. The resulting probes were separated from the free nucleotides using G-50 columns for RNA gel shift assays; for cell-free deadenylation assays, the probes were purified from urea-TBE gels. Transfection of HEK 293 Cells and Preparation of Cell Extracts—To each 100-mm plate of 293 cells was added 5 μg of vector DNA (BS+) alone, or 0.2 μg of CMV·hTTP·tag, or 2 μg of the TZF domain expression plasmid CMV·hTTP-(97-173)·tag (11Lai W.S. Carballo E. Thorn J.M. Kennington E.A. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17827-17837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), or 0.5 μg of CMV·HuB·FLAG, or 0.5 μg CMV·HuR·tag. Vector DNA (BS+) was added to each plate to make the total amount of co-transfected DNA 5 μg per plate by using the calcium-phosphate precipitation method. Twenty four h after the removal of the transfection mixture, the cell monolayers were rinsed with ice-cold Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline and then scraped into phosphate-buffered saline. After centrifugation at 600 × g for 3 min at 4 °C, the cell pellet was gently rinsed in ice-cold diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water containing 8 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A. The cells were lysed in a hypotonic buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 5 mm KCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.25% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 8 μg/ml leupeptin. After a 15-min centrifugation for 15,000 × g at 4 °C, KCl and glycerol were added to the supernatant to achieve final concentrations of 40 mm and 15% (v/v), respectively. The cell extracts were stored at -70 °C. The expression of proteins from these constructs was determined by Western blotting with an antibody directed at the HA epitope tag (1:2,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or the FLAG epitope tag (1:10,000, Sigma), essentially as described (11Lai W.S. Carballo E. Thorn J.M. Kennington E.A. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17827-17837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). RNA Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Extracts prepared from 293 cells as described above (5 μg of protein) were incubated with 2 × 105 cpm of RNA probe (RNase TI-treated, 10 units/reaction, Epicenter) in 25 μl of a buffer that contained 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 40 mm KCl, 3mm MgCl2,50 μg of heparin, 1.2 μg of yeast tRNA, as described (5Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar), and the protein-RNA complexes formed were resolved on 8% nondenaturing acrylamide (37.5:1) gels. In Vitro Deadenylation Assay—Extracts prepared from 293 cells as described above (10 μg of protein) were incubated with 5 × 104 cpm of RNA probe as described (14Lai W.S. Kennington E.A. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 3798-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Aliquots of reaction products were analyzed on 6% acrylamide gels containing 7 m urea. The resulting gels were exposed to x-ray films and were analyzed by PhosphorImager to quantify the amount of intact probe remaining. Plasmids—A series of plasmids was constructed with each containing the following components: a CMV promoter, the protein coding sequence of the mouse MARCKS-like protein (MLP), used because both the protein and mRNA are relatively stable in the 293 cell co-transfection system; an HA epitope tag attached in-frame to the MLP protein sequence; a 24-base RNA insertion corresponding to the core ARE of human and mouse TNF; and the 3′-UTR and polyadenylation signal sequence from the bovine growth hormone mRNA 3′-UTR (see Fig. 1B). This was the parent plasmid for subsequent mutants, and served as the “target” for TTP-mediated mRNA turnover in the cell transfection assays. The various mutant forms of this plasmid and their construction are described in detail below, but they basically represented a group of substitution mutants of the wild-type plasmid described above at the 24-base ARE region. They include a series of mutant ARE-containing plasmids based on the mutants of the TNF ARE described in Blackshear et al. (7Blackshear P.J. Lai W.S. Kennington E.A. Brewer G. Wilson G.M. Guan X. Zhou P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19947-19955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), as well as two novel mutations of the middle U residue in some of the UUU triplets. A schematic representation of these target plasmids is shown in Fig. 1B. For the parent MLP expression plasmid CMV·MLP-HA, the protein coding region of mouse MLP (GenBank™ accession number NM_010807) was fused at its carboxyl terminus in-frame with the HA epitope coding sequence and inserted into CMV·BGH3′/BS+ (5Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). To create the fusion insert, plasmid pF52.ab, consisting of the mouse Mlp cDNA (16Umekage T. Kato K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 286: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), was used as a PCR template. The 5′ primer for PCR amplification was 5′-AATTggatccCATCATGGGCAGCCAG-3′, and the 3′ primer was 5′-TATGctcgagcTTAAGCGTAATCCGGGACGTCGTATGGGTACTCATTCTGCTCAGCACTGG-3′. The lowercase letters in the primers indicate the restriction sites for Asp718 and XhoI, respectively; the sequences representing the initiator methionine and the stop codon are underlined. The uppercase letters contain the sequences bp 182-198 and bp 767-786 from GenBank™ accession number NM_010807, respectively. The italic sequence encodes the HA epitope. The resulting PCR product was an ∼0.6-kb cDNA that was digested with Asp718 and XhoI. To make CMV·MLP-HA (ARE), which contained the mouse TNF core ARE (bp 1309-1332 of GenBank™ accession number X02611, identical to the core ARE of human TNF, see bp 1341-1364 of GenBank™ accession number NM_000594.2), a double-stranded oligonucleotide TTATTTATTTATTATTTATTTATT, including the XhoI and XbaI sequences at its 5′ or 3′ ends, respectively, was inserted between the XhoI and XbaI sites 3′ to the stop codon of CMV·MLP-HA. This is designated as plasmid AAAAAA, with each of the six As representing the consecutive As in the native ARE sequence (Fig. 1). The first set of mutant plasmids, representing derivatives of CMV·MLP-HA in which single or multiple As in the 24-base ARE (Fig. 1B) were mutated to Cs, was made in a similar fashion. In each case the base substitution is underlined. The last two mutant plasmids contained mutations to the same ARE in which some of the As and the middle U of one or more UUU motifs was replaced by C (Fig. 1, A and B) so that the ARE contained one or two UUAUCUAUU nonamers. Correct insertion of the inserts in the vector, and the correct sequences of the intended mutations, were confirmed by dRhodamine terminator cycle sequencing. Cell Transfection Assays in 293 Cells—These were performed exactly as described (5Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). The cells were co-transfected with the vector alone plasmid (BS+), the wild-type human TTP-expressing plasmid CMV·hTTP·tag, the human HuB expression plasmid CMV·HuB·FLAG, and the various target MLP plasmids. The amount of transfected DNA was adjusted so that each plate was transfected with the same amount of DNA (5 μg); this was made up of 10 ng of CMV·hTTP·tag or 30 ng of CMV·HuB·FLAG and 0.5 μg (or otherwise indicated) of MLP plasmids, and the total of 5 μg was made up by BS+. The cells were harvested, and total cellular RNA was prepared using RNeasy (Qiagen). For Northern blotting, the probes consisted of either a mouse MLP cDNA probe consisting of bp 281-1429 of GenBank™ accession number NM_010807 or a mouse TTP cDNA probe (5Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar), with or without the HuB DNA probe. Northern blotting was performed as described (5Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). In some experiments, the total cellular RNA was used for transcript level determination by real time PCR, so that large numbers of experiments could be evaluated conveniently. For this purpose, RNA isolated from transfected 293 cells was treated with DNase to remove plasmid DNA. This was done by treating 1.2 μg of RNA with 5 μl of RQ1 DNase (1 unit/μl; Promega) in 3.35 μl of buffer (final concentration, 33.3 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2); the total reaction volume was 25 μl. The RNA and DNase mixture was incubated for 15 min at room temperature. After addition of 2.5 μl of 25 mm EDTA to terminate the reaction, the mixture was heated at 65 °C for 10 min to inactivate the DNase and then immediately placed on ice for 5 min and centrifuged, and the DNase-treated RNA was converted to cDNA using a high capacity cDNA archive kit (Applied Biosystems). 40 μl of cDNA was made by incubating 20 μl of DNase-treated RNA with 20 μl of reverse transcription mix according to the manufacturer's instructions (per 40 μl of reaction: 4 μl of 10× buffer, 1.6 μl of 25× dNTPs, 4 μl of 10× random primers, and 0.5 μl of reverse transcriptase, 50 units/μl). The reaction was incubated at 25 °C for 10 min and then at 37 °C for 2 h. Real Time PCR Analysis—Levels of the bovine growth hormone mRNA sequences expressed in the transfected cells were analyzed by quantitative real time PCR. Primers and the 6-carboxyfluoresein-labeled minor groove binder probe were designed using Primer Express software and synthesis (Applied Biosystems). The primer sequences were as follows: forward 5′-GTTGCCAGCCATCTGTTGTTT-3′; reverse 5′-GACAGTGGGAGTGGCACCTT-3′; probe 5′-CCTCCCCCGTGCCTTCCTTGA-3′; these corresponded to bp 716-736, 767-786, and 740-760, respectively, of the bovine growth hormone mRNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number NM_180996.1). The Taqman reactions were as follows: 3 μl of cDNA, 12.5 μl of Taqman Universal PCR Master mix (Applied Biosystems), 1.25 μl of probe/primer mix (5 μm probe, 18 μm each primer), and 8.25 μl of H2O. The reactions were performed in 96-well plates in an Applied Biosystems Prism 7700 real time PCR instrument. The thermal cycle conditions were as follows: 2 min at 50 °C and 10 min at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s each and 60 °C for 60 s. Each sample was analyzed in duplicate. A positive control cDNA was analyzed on each plate in order to minimize plate-to-plate variations. A negative control (293 cells transfected with a TNF plasmid alone) cDNA was also assayed on each plate in order to remove any contribution from nonspecific 293 cell background. A modified version of the ΔΔCt method of relative quantification (17Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (127155) Google Scholar) was used to determine the fold change in expression in ARE and TTP-transfected cells versus ARE and empty vector control-transfected cells (BS). Briefly, this was done by normalizing the resulting threshold cycle (Ct) values of the samples to the Ct values obtained with the negative control (293 cells transfected with TNF plasmid) to account for 293 cell background (ΔΔCt = Ctsample - Ct293 control). The background-normalized Ct values were then calibrated to the Ct values from empty vector control (BS) and ARE-transfected cells that were treated at the same time as the TTP- and ARE-transfected cells; ΔΔCt = ΔCtARE sample - ΔCtBS sample. The fold change in expression was then obtained (2-(ΔΔCt)). Statistical Analysis—The mean fold changes in expression in the six groups of ARE and TTP co-transfected cells (normalized to BS control transfected cells) were analyzed with SAS Enterprise Guide 2.0 software. Differences in real time PCR mRNA levels among all six groups of transfected cells were determined by analysis of variance followed by Tukey-Kramer post hoc analysis, using α level = 0.05. In some experiments, the expression of the MLP protein was determined by Western blotting with an antibody directed at the HA epitope tag. TTP or TZF Domain Peptide Binding to Mutant ARE Probes—We showed previously by gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays that both full-length TTP and its TZF domain peptide expressed in 293 cells could bind to the ARE sequence of the TNFα-(1309-1332) (A)50 probe (ARE-A50) (7Blackshear P.J.

Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 3798-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In the present study, a series of mutant probes was made in which the flanking As of the AUUUA pentamers were mutated to Cs (Fig. 1A); the number of nonamer(s) UUAUUUAUU found in these probes is listed in Fig. 1A. A pair of mutant probes with central U mutations was also made (Fig. 1A); and the number(s) of UUAUCUAUU nonamers in them is also listed (Fig. 1A). Note that for the last two central U probes there are no intact original nonamers remaining in either probe (Fig. 1A). These probes were digested with RNase T1 to release the 24-base ARE from the vector sequence and the poly(A) tail, and were then used in gel shift analysis with extracts prepared from 293 cells transfected with TTP or its TZF domain expression constructs. Extracts from 293 cells transfected with constructs expressing members of the Hu family ARE-binding proteins, HuB and HuR (human members of the ELAV family; for review, see Ref. 18Brennan C.M. Steitz J.A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar), were also used in the assays. For the A to C mutant probes, we previously determined the apparent mole of synthetic TTP73 peptide that bound per mol of the respective ARE probe (Fig. 1A, right-hand column) (7Blackshear P.J.

These results were confirmed in the present study by gel shift analysis, using a TZF domain peptide (77 amino acids) that was expressed in 293 cells, with the gel shifts being performed with cytosolic extracts from those cells (Fig. 2A). For the U to C mutant probes, whose sequences and abbreviations are shown in Fig. 1A, binding to both full-length TTP and its TZF domain peptide is shown in Fig. 2B. These gel shift data were used to calculate the apparent mol/mol of the TZF peptide bound to these RNA probes (Fig. 1A, right-most column), with the presence of the lower band indicating 1 mol per mol of binding and the upper band indicating 2 mol per mol. The wild-type sequence is labeled AAAAAA to indicate the six A residues in the 24-base sequence; although it contains four possible nonamer binding sites, it was found p"

In the present study, we demonstrate that the human telomerase template sequence not only determines the composition, but also the rate of synthesis, of telomere repeats. Mutagenesis of the template sequence identified variants that reconstitute enzymes with repeat extension rates that were either faster or slower than wild type template. Changes in extension rate could not be attributed solely to altered heteroduplex melting, strongly suggesting that specific interactions between telomerase template, protein, and products contribute significantly in determining repeat extension rate. Furthermore, some substitutions that had no effect on extension rate led to striking increases in repeat processivity, indicating that processivity and extension rates can be regulated independently of each other. Our results suggest that telomerase RNA template sequence is a key determinant of the contribution of telomerase to telomere length regulation.

Our results suggest that telomerase RNA template sequence is a key determinant of the contribution of telomerase to telomere length regulation. Protection of chromosome termini by telomere repeats is one of several strategies eukaryotic cells have developed to maintain the integrity of their genomes. The biosynthesis of telomeres, which are composed of short, repeated sequences, is accomplished by the action of telomerase, a specialized reverse transcriptase. Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein complex, its active form minimally consisting of a catalytic protein subunit, the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), 2The abbreviations used are: TERT, telomerase reverse transcriptase; TR, telomerase RNA; h, human; MH, modified human; IVR, in vitro reconstituted; t, template; a, alignment. and an integral RNA subunit, telomerase RNA (TR). The TERT protein contains the polymerase activity, which utilizes a short, well defined region within the TR as the template for telomeric repeat synthesis. To facilitate synthesis of defined repeats of telomeric DNA, telomerase has evolved the ability to copy the template sequence in TR in a reiterative action. Consequently, telomerase can remain associated with the DNA strand being extended for many rounds of template copying, thus processively synthesizing many telomeric repeats. In vitro, repeat synthesis by human telomerase has been shown to be highly processive, with nearly all products of a given cycle of template copying being further extended rather than released by the enzyme at the end of each round (1Maine I.P. Chen S.F. Windle B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15325-15332Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) 3W. C. Drosopoulos, unpublished data.. Mechanistic models of repeat synthesis by telomerase include successive cycles of enzymatic copying to the end of templating sequence followed by translocation and repositioning of the 3′-end of the nascent product with the 3′-end of the templating segment of TR (2Collins K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 187-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 3Kelleher C. Teixeira M.T. Forstemann K. Lingner J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 572-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In addition to templating repeat synthesis, the TR assists in realignment of translocated product at the end of each round of template copying. Most TRs contain partial repeats of the templating sequence 3′ to the templating region, referred to as the alignment region. Through base-pairing interactions with alignment nucleotides, the translocated product can be properly positioned for a new round of template-directed polymerization. Sequences within the RNA also form secondary structures, which allow for template recognition (4Miller M.C. Collins K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6585-6590Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and define template boundaries for terminating each cycle of telomere synthesis (5Chen J.L. Greider C.W.

Fulton T.B. Roy J. Blackburn E.H. Science. 2000; 288: 863-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Furthermore, regions within the TR have been shown to contribute to repeat processivity, presumably through base-pairing interactions between telomeric products and TR during translocation (8Gavory G. Farrow M. Balasubramanian S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4470-4480Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 9Chen J.L. Greider C.W.

It has been shown that telomerases can tolerate significant variation in the template sequences they copy. Template alterations, including single point mutations, deletions, additions, as well as complete template substitutions, have been made in the TRs of several organisms, predominantly ciliates (12Yu G.L.

However, these modifications can result in significant changes in the in vitro and in vivo behavior of the enzyme. Thus, the sequence being copied and the resulting products contribute to enzyme activity, with the particular composition of the template sequence rendering specific properties required for efficient in vitro and in vivo function. In the present study, we have examined the effects of modification of the templating and adjoining alignment sequences of human TR (hTR) on the biochemical behavior of human telomerase. hTR template mutants were made with substitutions in either the templating region alone, alignment region alone, or in both. Our results reveal that alterations in the template region can directly influence the overall repeat extension rate as well as rate of synthesis at individual template positions, probably by modulating interactions between telomerase protein, hTR, and telomerase products. Our results further show that product/template composition can independently affect the rate of repeat translocation during template copying and repeat processivity. Oligonucleotides—Oligonucleotide substrates were purified via denaturing PAGE followed by gel extraction and ethanol precipitation. Cloning of hTERT—Full-length hTERT cDNA was cloned from human testes cDNA library (Clontech, Palo Alto CA) via PCR. Two segments, a 5′ segment and a 3′ segment were independently amplified and ligated together by the unique MluI site in hTERT to form the complete full-length cDNA. The oligonucleotides used for the 5′ PCR were ACAAGAATTCCGTCTCACCGCGCGCTCCCCGCTGCCGA (EcoHTRT4) and TGCCAGAGAGAGCGCACCCTCCAAAGAGG (HTRT9), and for the 3′ PCR, GCAGGACGCGTGGACCGAGTGA (Mlu hTERTup) and AGTCAGATCTGTCGACGAATTCAGTCCAGGATGGTCTTGAAGTCTGA (3′-hTERT Eco). The full-length hTERT cDNA was cloned into the in vitro expression plasmid pCITE4b (Novagen, Madison, WI) as follows. The pCITE4b vector was digested with MscI and BglII to remove the entire MCS and all epitope tags. The full-length hTERT cDNA fragment along with a linker containing a FLAG epitope sequence was inserted into the pCITE vector to yield the plasmid pNFLAGhTERT. The hTERT nucleotide sequence in pNFLA-GhTERT was verified against the published sequence (GenBank™ accession number NM_003219) and was then used to express N-terminally tagged full-length hTERT protein in vitro in a coupled transcription-translation system. Cloning of Human Telomerase Template RNA cDNA—The 451-nucleotide full-length hTR sequence was amplified from HeLa cell total RNA via RT-PCR using the primers CTGACTGCTCAGGGTTGCGGAGGGTGGGCCTG (HTR1) and TAGCGAATTCTGCGCATGTGTGAGCCGAGTCC (HTRF). The amplified sequence was cloned into pBluescript II KS(+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, Ca) to generate the plasmid phTRF. The hTR sequence in phTRF is inserted directly following the T7 transcriptional promoter such that the first base transcribed is the first 5′ base of hTR. The hTR nucleotide sequence in phTRF was verified against the published sequence (GenBank™ accession number U86046) to ensure the integrity of the sequence. Site-directed Mutagenesis of hTR—A cassette strategy (29Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 275: 538-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) was used to generate mutants of hTR. An intermediate vector was generated from phTR by PCR in which the region of hTR encompassing nucleotides 36–64 was replaced with a pair of BsmBI endonuclease sites, resulting in a self excising sequence based on downstream cleavage by type IIs restriction endonucleases. By digesting this plasmid, designated phTRFdel, with BsmBI, the self-excising segment is released, and a vector backbone with cohesive ends is generated, into which new sequences can readily be introduced. phTRFdel was digested with BsmBI, dephosphorylated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase, and the 3.4-kb vector backbone agarose was gel-purified. Pairs of complementary oligonucleotides containing modified human (MH) hTR template sequences (for example, TGGCCATTTTTTGTCTTCCCCTTCCTGAGAAGG (MH1 Top) and ACGCCCTTCTCAGGAAGGGGAAGACAAAAAATG (MH1 Bottom), comprising the mutant MH1 (Fig. 1)) were phosphorylated and annealed, and the annealed cassettes were ligated into the phTRFdel backbone. The resultant constructs were transformed, isolated, and sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired changes and the absence of unintended modifications. Transcription and Purification of Human Telomerase RNA—To prepare full-length hTR RNA, phTR (or its mutant derivatives) was first digested with FspI, releasing a 615-bp fragment containing the hTR sequence under T7 promoter control. The 615-bp FspI fragment was then gel-purified and used as a template for in vitro transcription of hTR RNA. Transcription reactions were performed with gel-purified template using a MegaScript transcription kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Transcribed RNA was electrophoretically separated on 8 m urea-4% polyacrylamide gels, and the RNA was excised from the gel. Gel slices were crushed, and RNA was eluted in 0.3 m sodium acetate for 1 h at 37°C. The eluted material was then phenol-extracted and ethanol-precipitated. The recovered, purified hTR RNA was dissolved in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7, and stored at –80 °C until needed. In Vitro Reconstitution of Human Telomerase—Telomerase activity was reconstituted in vitro by synthesizing hTERT protein in the presence of purified hTR RNA using a TnT-coupled transcription-translation kit. Reactions containing pNFLAGhTERT (0.77 pmol (0.04 μg)/μl) and purified hTR RNA (0.82 pmol (0.12 μg)/μl) were assembled as recommended by the manufacturer, with the exception that both minus methionine and minus cysteine amino acid mixes were used here. In vitro reconstitutions were carried out at 30 °C for 3.5 h, then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until needed. Aliquots of the reconstitutions were also analyzed via SDS-PAGE to quantitate the in vitro synthesized hTERT protein. Telomerase Activity Assay—Telomerase activity was measured via a direct primer extension assay using radiolabeled primer and unlabeled deoxynucleotides. Typical primer extension reactions with radiolabeled primer contained 2 μl of in vitro reconstituted (IVR) telomerase, 1 pmol of 5′32P-end-labeled substrate primer d(TTAGGG)3, 1 mm dATP, 1 mm dGTP, and 1 mm TTP in PE reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm Spermidine) in a total volume of 10 μl. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min then terminated by adding an equal volume of stop solution (RNase A (100 μg/ml) in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 20 mm EDTA) and incubating at 37 °C for 10 min. Reaction products were then isolated from terminated reactions by first treating with an equal volume of PK/SDS solution (proteinase K (0.2 mg/ml) and 0.3%SDS in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0) for 10 min at 37 °C followed by extraction with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and ethanol precipitation. The recovered reaction products were dissolved in Urea-PAGE sample buffer (95% formamide/20 mm EDTA) and resolved on 8 m urea/10% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were then dried, and reaction products were detected and analyzed via PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) using ImageQuaNT software (Molecular Dynamics). Relative activities were determined by measuring the total amount of extended substrate primer for each reaction, correcting for background and normalizing against unextended primer (which represented >95% of the recovered material) followed by expressing values thus obtained as a percentage of wild type activity. Primer positioning assays were carried out as described above except deoxy-(dNTP) and/or dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs) were present at 0.5 mm. Competitive Primer Challenge Assay—A competitive primer challenge (“bind and chase”) assay similar to that described by Bryan et al. (30Bryan T.M. Goodrich K.J. Cech T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24199-24207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) was employed to assess processive DNA synthesis by IVR telomerase. IVR hTERT (8 μl) was combined with 5′-32P-labeled substrate primer d(TTAGGG)3 (4 pmol) in 1× PE reaction buffer (total volume, 24 μl) and incubated for 5 min at 30 °C to allow TERT to bind the substrate primer. 16 μl of 40 μm unlabeled (cold) competitor (chase) primer plus 2.5 mm dATP, 2.5 mm dGTP, and 2.5 mm TTP (in 1× PE salts) was then added to initiate a reaction time course of primer extension. The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C, and aliquots (10 μl) were removed at 0–5 min and combined with an equal volume of stop solution to terminate the reaction. As a control, the effectiveness of the unlabeled competitor primer was tested by combining labeled primer (1 pmol), unlabeled primer (160 pmol), and dNTPs (1.25 mm) in 1.25× PE buffer first and then adding IVR hTERT (2 μl). This mixture was incubated at 30 °C generally for 5 min unless otherwise indicated, allowing for extension of labeled primer in the presence of competitor to be measured. The products of the primer extension reactions were then processed and analyzed via standard protocol described above for telomerase activity assay. Relative repeat extension rates were calculated by comparing the modal size of the radiolabeled products associated with actively polymerizing complexes, at a given time point. Specifically, the population of products containing substrate primers that could be further elongated during the chase period (as observed at later time points) was selected for quantitation (for example, see wild type (WT) lanes in Fig. 4, A and B). This population consisted primarily of substrate primers associated with active complexes, along with a minor population of stalled/dissociated complexes. Individual band intensities of this group of bands were measured, the percentage of the total for each band was determined, and these values were used to establish a modal product band in this population of bands. The relative extension rates were then calculated by dividing the number of repeats in the modal band by time. In these studies, relative repeat extension rates were calculated from the 3-min time point of a given experiment, and were expressed relative to wild type. The choice of 3-min time point was based on the reasoning that it allowed one to easily distinguish the products of actively polymerizing complexes (which corresponded to the most abundant products with more than five repeats added) from relatively abundant products resulting from low efficiency translocation (characteristically seen during the first few rounds of template copying), as well as for accurate size determination. Repeat processivity was calculated as a processivity index, i.e. the ratio of long products (>500 nucleotides) to total products (products <500 nucleotides plus products >500 nucleotides). All values obtained were corrected for background and normalized against unextended primer. Relative processivity values are calculated as the processivity index of a given enzyme compared with that of wild type. Enzymatic Activity of Reconstituted Human Telomerase Template Mutants—Telomeric repeat synthesis by human telomerase is characterized by reiterative cycles of template copying. In vitro products of such polymerization are observed as six nucleotide ladders of extension synthesis, each band of the ladder representing enzyme pausing, stalling, or dissociation at the end of a cycle of template copying. In general only minor product bands are seen between the major “rungs” of the ladder, implying that, compared with reinitiating new rounds of template copying, copying across the template sequence is accomplished with relative ease. In addition, the abundance of the minor “intrarepeat” products is relatively uniform, indicating that polymerization/pausing across every template position occurs with roughly equal efficiency. This suggests that human telomerase evolved its wild type templating/alignment sequence to be inherently optimal for extension synthesis. To examine this notion, hTR template mutants were created and examined (Fig. 1). To maintain hybridization potential and to avoid mismatches during realignment, the identical changes were made in both the templating and alignment sequences in these mutants. To avoid disrupting the natural termini of the template and alignment sequences, the sites of modification were limited to template nucleotides 49AAU47 and alignment nucleotides 55AAU53 in hTR. In addition, leaving the terminal nucleotides 50C, 51C (template), and 52C (alignment) unaltered would allow the use of a common substrate primer d(TTAGGG)3, based on the natural telomeric sequence to test the activity of the mutants. Telomerase activity of the mutant enzymes was measured via a direct primer extension assay. As observed from the results in Fig. 2, all of the mutant templates were active to some extent, although the level of activity varied from minimally active to wild type-like. Specifically, the amount of d(TTAGGG)3 primer elongation by the MH3 and MH4 mutants was, generally, very similar to wild type. The next most active, with somewhat less than wild type activity, were the MH5, MH8, and MH9 enzymes. The mutants MH1, MH2, MH6, and MH7 exhibited relatively little activity, yet were nevertheless able to extend the substrate primer significantly. Because these relative activities were determined with a single primer and, in the case of the mutants, some substrate/template mismatches were present for the first repeat of synthesis, it was possible that these mismatches could, at least partially, have resulted in the reduced overall activity observed with some of the mutants. Therefore, we tested the effect of using perfectly matched primers with mutants MH1 and MH2, two of the least active mutants. When assays were performed with the perfectly complementary primer to MH1 (d(GAAGGG)3 or separately, with a primer to MH2 (d(AAAGGG)3), we found no significant difference in relative overall activity of these mutants, compared with wild type (and the MH3, MH8, and MH9 mutants), from that determined with the standard wild type primer (data not shown). This indicated that the overall activities exhibited by the mutants with the standard d(TTAGGG)3 primer seemed inherent to the enzymes and were not significantly influenced by altered DNA-RNA interactions in the template region resulting from primer mismatches during initial (first round) primer extension. Moreover, the ability of all of these mutants to perform telomeric elongation demonstrates that human telomerase, like the other, better studied telomerases of ciliates and yeasts, is quite tolerant of variation in the template sequence being copied. More importantly, it was also evident from the primer extension reactions that the mutants could synthesize long products, an indication of processive polymerization by telomerase. Most of the mutants were capable of elongating the substrate primer by more than one hundred repeats over the course of the 30-min reaction. The relatively active mutants MH3, MH4, MH8, and MH9 all appeared to produce a significant proportion of long products, observed as dark, slow migrating patches at the top of the lanes (Fig. 2). Based on the proportion of long products (>500 nucleotides) to total products, an index of repeat processivity, it appears that these mutant enzymes were at least as processive as wild type. Interestingly, the MH1, MH2, and MH6 mutants, despite not being very active, were also able to produce a relatively high proportion of long products (Fig. 2). These results indicate that repeat processivity is not necessarily related to overall activity, because once these mutant enzymes successfully add a few repeats, they become very efficient at additional extension. The only enzyme that was unable to synthesize appreciable amounts of long extension products was the MH7 mutant, indicating a possible defect in repeat processivity. Mutations in Template Residues Can Affect Copying at Unmodified Template Positions—In addition to differences in catalytic activity, the observed banding patterns of the elongation products synthesized by most of the mutants varied significantly from that of wild type hTR (see Fig. 2, A and B, and their enlarged sections). To establish exact templating positions corresponding to particular product bands, primer extension reactions were performed where dGTP was replaced with ddGTP to determine initial primer positioning. When assayed under these conditions, elongation of the d(TTAGGG)3 primer by wild type enzyme results in termination after addition of four nucleotides, including the terminal ddGMP (Fig. 3, lane WTdd), indicating primer 3′ terminal G binding to C50 of the template. This is the primary predicted alignment based on fewest primer/template mismatches. Similarly, ddGTP termination of primer extension by the mutant enzymes indicated that the predominant binding preference (with the exception of MH6 and MH7) was alignment of the substrate primer terminus to C50. The MH6 mutant primarily aligned primer terminal G with C51, whereas the MH7 mutant displayed a fairly equal usage of two alignments, one with primer terminus binding to C51 and one with terminal binding to C50. Based on the d(TTAGGG)3 substrate primer positioning, the specific sites at which product bands were accumulating during template copying were identified. The mutants seemed to be divided into two classes defined by their propensity to generate distinct product patterns. The MH3, MH4, MH5, and MH7 mutants were similar to the wild type in that their major products could be observed in clear patterns repeated in regular six nucleotide intervals, however (with the exception of MH7), there were significant differences in the patterns themselves (Fig. 2). Specifically, repeat synthesis by the MH3 (A48U) mutant was characterized by many abundant products early (within the first four to five repeats) which, similar to wild type, settled into a pattern with a single major product at the end of the repeat. However, the relative difference between the major product and minor product bands was much less than observed with wild type. Even greater changes from the wild type pattern were seen with the MH4 and MH5 mutants, which produced ladders of a doublet or a triplet, respectively. In addition to the major end of repeat product observed with wild type hTR, a two-nucleotide longer major product was seen for both MH4 and MH5, corresponding to a template copying at C50 (Fig. 2A, cf. lanes WT, MH4, and MH5). A third major product, corresponding to a template copying at C51, was also observed for MH5 (Fig. 2A, lane MH5). It is striking that the sites where template copying was affected were not the sites of template mutation (U47 and A48 for MH4 and U47 for MH5). In fact, no apparent change is detected when copying at the altered positions in these mutants. Although a similar observation had previously been observed in Tetrahymena telomerase (16Gilley D. Lee M.S. Blackburn E.H. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2214-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), this is the first demonstration via direct primer extension of such an effect for human telomerase. The other group of mutants, MH1, MH2, MH6, MH8, and MH9 enzymes, did not produce regularly repeated 6-base ladders but uniform accumulation at every position. These enzymes initially synthesized products in a weak to modest pattern, which subsequently became much less distinct after a few rounds of template copying (Fig. 2, lanes MH1, MH2, MH6, MH8, and MH9). This behavior was the most pronounced in the MH2 mutant, where any discernible pattern quickly disappeared after the first two rounds of template copying. The MH9 mutant exhibited a slight variation in behavior relative to the other mutants of this group. The major synthesis products of template copying by the MH9 mutant almost appear to be shifting from round to round and finally to no readily perceptible pattern. The ability of mutations in hTR template nucleotides to influence the copying at sites other than at the mutated positions suggests that interactions with templating nucleotides are occurring outside of the polymerization site which can affect copying. Alterations in the Template Region Can Directly Affect Repeat Extension Rates—The accumulation of products of a given size can be indicative of either pausing during template copying or enzyme dissociation from the growing product. Because repeat synthesis by human telomerase is highly processive, it is possible to distinguish transiently paused products from those either associated with non-productively stalled enzyme or completely dissociated from the enzyme via competitor challenge (“bind and chase”) assays. Because pausing events are transient, accumulated products at positions where pausing has occurred will, in time, continue to be extended further when “chased” by competitor. To further characterize the modified template copying behavior observed in the standard telomerase assays, primer extension reactions were performed with hTR mutants under bind and chase conditions (Fig. 4). In general, patterns observed in the bind and chase assay reflected patterns seen in the standard assay (compare Fi"

Whether calnexin can also directly recognize polypeptide components of substrates is controversial. We found that calnexin displayed significant conformational lability for a chaperone and that heat treatment and calcium depletion induced the formation of calnexin dimers and higher order oligomers. These conditions enhanced the chaperone activity of calnexin toward glycosylated and non-glycosylated major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I heavy chains, and enhanced calnexin binding to MHC class I heavy chains. In contrast to these observations, calnexin binding to oligosaccharide substrates has been reported to be impaired under calcium-depleting conditions. Calnexin dimers were induced in HeLa cells upon heat shock and under calcium-depleting conditions, and heat shock enhanced calnexin binding to MHC class I heavy chains in HeLa cells. Virus-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress also resulted in the appearance of calnexin dimers. Tunicamycin treatment of HeLa cells induced a slow accumulation of calnexin dimers, the appearance of which correlated with enhanced calnexin binding to deglycosylated MHC class I heavy chains. In vitro, the presence of calnexin-specific oligosaccharides inhibited the formation of calnexin dimers and higher order structures. Together, these data indicate that polypeptide binding is favored by conditions that induce partial unfolding of calnexin monomers, whereas oligosaccharide binding is favored by conditions that enhance the structural stability (folding) of calnexin monomers. Conditions that induce the calnexin “polypeptide-binding” conformation also induce self-association of calnexin if the concentration is sufficiently high; however, calnexin dimerization/oligomerization per se is not essential for polypeptide substrate binding.

Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Calnexin shares a high degree of sequence similarity with calreticulin, a soluble ER-resident lectin that also has specificity for proteins containing monoglucosylated oligosaccharides. Calreticulin and calnexin have been shown to function as molecular chaperones by enhancing the assembly of a variety of cellular and viral substrates. This function is attributed to the ability of calnexin/calreticulin in the ER to bind to glycoproteins carrying monoglucosylated oligosaccha-rides and to retain such proteins in the ER. Newly synthesized glycoproteins carrying three glucose residues on the oligosaccharide chain (GlcNAc2Man7-9Glc3) are trimmed by the sequential action of ER glucosidases I and II. Glucosidase II can also catalyze the removal of the terminal glucose residue, and the resulting non-glucosylated glycoproteins either traffic out of the ER if properly folded, or become associated with the ER luminal enzyme UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase, if misfolded. UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase binds to misfolded but not native structures, causing the regeneration of monoglucosylated oligosaccharide-containing glycoproteins. Thus, UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase is an important protein folding sensor in the ER, and calnexin and calreticulin have been suggested to cooperate with UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase by binding to and ensuring ER retention of glycoproteins that are tagged by UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase as being misfolded (reviewed in Ref. 2Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). In the studies described here, we investigated whether calnexin could also function as a direct protein folding sensor in the ER. In vitro analyses have indicated that both calnexin and calreticulin are capable of direct functional interactions with non-glycosylated polypeptide substrates, inhibiting their aggregation (3Saito Y. Ihara Y. Leach M.R. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Williams D.B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6718-6729Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 4Ihara Y. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Saito Y. Williams D.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). However, more recent studies in our laboratory have indicated that specific conditions are required for efficient observation of the binding of calreticulin to polypeptide substrates lacking monoglucosylated oligosaccharides (5Rizvi S.M. Mancino L. Thammavongsa V. Cantley R.L. Raghavan M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Calreticulin had surprising conformational lability for a chaperone, with heat treatment or calcium depletion inducing the conversion of calreticulin monomers into specific oligomeric forms. We observed that conditions that enhanced oligomerization of calreticulin also enhanced the ability of calreticulin to bind glycosylated and non-glycosylated polypeptide substrates and enhanced the chaperone activity of calreticulin toward such substrates. However, oligomerization per se was not required for enhanced polypeptide substrate recognition by calreticulin. In this study, we examined whether calnexin shares some of the properties we have described for calreticulin. We investigated the conformations of calnexin under different conditions and their effects on polypeptide substrate recognition by calnexin. Many parallels were observed between calreticulin and calnexin, emphasizing the likely existence of multiple conformational states of these chaperones with distinct substrate recognition properties.

Mancino L. Thammavongsa V. Cantley R.L. Raghavan M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, the indicated cells in 150-cm2 culture flasks under the indicated conditions were lysed in 400 μl of lysis buffer (1% digitonin (Waco Chemical & Supply Co.; for analysis in HeLa cells) or 1% Triton X-100 (for analyses in Huh7 and FCA4 cells), 10 mm Tris, 10 mm phosphate, 130 mm NaCl, and 10 mm iodoacetamide, pH 7.5), and calnexin was visualized by immunoblotting with anti-calnexin antisera using a color-imetric alkaline phosphatase kit (Bio-Rad). MHC Class I Interactions with Calnexin in HeLa Cells—HeLa cell lysates were prepared as described above, and immunoprecipitation analyses were conducted as described previuosly (5Rizvi S.M. Mancino L. Thammavongsa V. Cantley R.L. Raghavan M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) using the rabbit anti-calnexin polyclonal antisera. Calnexin Undergoes Structural Changes upon Heat Treatment and under Calcium-depleting Conditions—Studies by Ou et al. (13Ou W.J. Bergeron J.J. Li Y. Kang C.Y. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18051-18059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) suggested that purified soluble calnexin undergoes conformational changes following calcium binding. Using a canine soluble calnexin comprising residues 1-461 of the mature protein (9Vassilakos A. Michalak M. Lehrman M.A. Williams D.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3480-3490Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), we analyzed calnexin structure by native PAGE at different temperatures and in the absence or presence of calcium (Fig. 1). In the absence of calcium, at least five calnexin species were resolved even at 37 °C, forming a ladder of bands (Fig. 1A, upper panel). The size of the fastest migrating band is consistent with that of a calnexin monomer (∼65 kDa), and the size of the second band is consistent with that of a calnexin dimer (∼125 kDa). Heat treatment enhanced the formation of high molecular mass calnexin bands and a corresponding reduction in the intensities of calnexin monomer/dimer bands (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 4 and 6). Compared with the calcium-depleting condition, the presence of 1 mm Ca2+ revealed higher levels of calnexin monomers and lower levels of dimers/oligomers at 37 °C (Fig. 1, A, compare upper and middle panels; and B, corresponding quantifications) and slower kinetics of temperature-induced calnexin oligomerization (Fig. 1B, lower panel). In the presence of 5 mm Ca2+, calnexin monomers were the predominant species observed even at 47 °C (Fig. 1, A, lower panel; and B). Thus, both heat treatment and calcium depletion enhanced calnexin dimer/higher order oligomer formation at the expense of monomers. Both low temperatures and high concentrations of calcium stabilized calnexin monomers. The extent of dimers and oligomers observed was also a function of calnexin concentration. Higher concentrations of calnexin promoted dimer/oligomer formation (data not shown). Heat Treatment and Calcium Depletion Enhance the Ability of Calnexin to Bind to Polypeptide Substrates—Calcium depletion has been previously shown to abrogate calnexin binding to oligosaccharide substrates (9Vassilakos A. Michalak M. Lehrman M.A. Williams D.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3480-3490Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Because calcium binding and heat treatment influenced calnexin structure (Fig. 1), we wanted to examine the effects of these conditions upon calnexin interactions with polypeptide substrates. We used a soluble MHC class I heterodimer (HLA-A2, the heavy chain and the β2m light chain) that was expressed in and purified from insect cell supernatants (7Mancino L. Rizvi S.M. Lapinski P.E. Raghavan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5931-5936Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although the HLA-A2 heavy chain is glycosylated, it is not expected to contain monoglucosylated oligosaccharide structures that calnexin can recognize. These structures are transient intermediates during glycoprotein trafficking through the ER. Because insect cells lack the class I-specific peptide transporter, class I molecules purified from insect cells are peptide-deficient, and the heavy chains are thermally unstable (7Mancino L. Rizvi S.M. Lapinski P.E. Raghavan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5931-5936Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the presence of 1 mm CaCl2, no binding of the HLA-A2 heavy chain to calnexin was detectable at 37 °C as assessed by co-immunoprecipitation analyses with the MHC class I heavy chain-specific antibody HC-10 and Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 2A, lane 4). However, under the same conditions, binding of heat-treated calnexin to the peptide-deficient HLA-A2 heavy chain was readily detectable (Fig. 2, A, compare lanes 3 and 4; and C, quantifications of calnexin and HLA-A2 band intensities from the immunoprecipitations). Calcium depletion of calnexin also enhanced binding to HLA-A2 heavy chains at 37 °C (Fig. 2, B, compare lanes 2 and 4; and C). When both HLA-A2 and calnexin were simultaneously heat-treated at 50 °C in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2, efficient complex formation occurred between calnexin and the HLA-A2 heavy chains (Fig. 2B, lane 6), which was coincident with calnexin-mediated suppression of HLA-A2 thermal aggregation (Fig. 2D). The ability of calnexin to suppress heat-induced aggregation of HLA-A2 heavy chains was assessed by heat treatment of HLA-A2 at 50 °C in the presence of buffer, calnexin, or the control protein IgG. The amount of precipitated HLA-A2 heavy chains was quantified under the different conditions (Fig. 2D, upper panel). Compared with the IgG control, calnexin efficiently inhibited heat-induced precipitation of the HLA-A2 heavy chain (Fig. 2D, lower panel, compare lane 3 with lanes 5 and 7). The efficiency of calnexin was similar to that described previously for calreticulin (Fig. 2D) (7Mancino L. Rizvi S.M. Lapinski P.E. Raghavan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5931-5936Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Together, these observations suggest that heat treatment and calcium depletion enhance the ability of calnexin to bind to substrates via polypeptide-based interactions. The above findings do not imply that calnexin is unable to bind substrates at 37 °C in the absence of heat treatment or calcium depletion. Rather, the assay may have limited sensitivity, and heat treatment and calcium depletion simply allow for a signal that is above the detection threshold. To demonstrate this possibility, immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting and ELISAs were used to assess complex formation between calnexin and MHC class I molecules under physiological conditions. HLA-A2 and HLA-E heavy chains were purified as inclusion bodies and refolded with β2m following established procedures, but in the absence of peptides (8Garboczi D.N. Utz U. Ghosh P. Seth A. Kim J. VanTienhoven E.A. Biddison W.E. Wiley D.C. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5403-5410PubMed Google Scholar). Refolded empty heterodimers were further purified by gel filtration chromatography. For co-immunoprecipitation analyses, calnexin and HLA-A2 were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5, following which complexes were immunoprecipitated with the antibody HC-10. Fig. 3A (left panel) shows a silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel of the co-immunoprecipitation analysis. An additional band consistent with the size of the HLA-A2 heavy chains was present in the sample containing HLA-A2 + calnexin compared with the sample containing calnexin alone (Fig. 3A, left panel, compare lanes 3 and 5). Half of the immunoprecipitated samples were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-calnexin antisera (Fig. 3A, right panel). A low level of nonspecific binding of calnexin was detectable in control immunoprecipitations that did not contain HLA-A2 (Fig. 3A, right panel, lane 3). However, significantly higher levels of calnexin were detectable in immunoprecipitated samples that had both calnexin and HLA-A2 (Fig. 3A, right panel, lane 5), indicating that calnexin indeed bound to HLA-A2 under physiological conditions. To further confirm these results, we assessed whether calnexin·class I complexes could be observed using ELISA-based detection. Refolded non-glycosylated HLA-A2 heterodimers were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to verify the presence of both heavy chains and β2m (Fig. 3B, upper left panel, second lane) and then coated overnight onto 96-well ELISA plates in 50 mm Tris and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. 10 μg of purified soluble calnexin in 100 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5, was then added to the wells, and complexes were allowed to form during incubation at 37 °C for 4 h. Detection of calnexin·class I complexes was performed by the addition of anti-calnexin antisera. Fig. 3B (upper right panel) shows that the amount of calnexin that was detectable increased with the amount of HLA-A2 heterodimers coated onto the plate. The binding signal was specific, as equal amounts of β2m or bovine serum albumin coated onto the plates yielded significantly lower absorbance signals. A parallel set of analyses was undertaken with non-glycosylated HLA-E (Fig. 3B, lower panels). These analyses verify that calnexin is indeed able to recognize and bind to non-glycosylated MHC class I heavy chains under physiological conditions. Heat Treatment and Calcium Depletion Enhance Calnexin Chaperone Activity toward a Protein Substrate—It was a possibility that the enhanced binding observed between calnexin and peptide-deficient HLA-A2 heavy chains upon heat treatment and under calcium-depleting conditions reflected nonspecific associations induced by conditions that generated unfolded/aggregated forms of calnexin. To rule out this possibility, we assessed calnexin function in a MHC class I refolding assay (Fig. 4). HLA-A2/β2m heterodimers were purified after baculovirus-mediated expression in insect cells, dialyzed into buffer containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, and concentrated to 100 μm.2 μl of protein was diluted with rapid stirring into 100 μl of aggregation assay buffer (Fig. 4A, left panel, lanes 9 and 10) or buffer containing the indicated proteins at 2 μm (lanes 1-8). Samples were then centrifuged to separate soluble and insoluble HLA-A2 heavy chains. Pellets were resuspended in a volume equal to the supernatant, and both fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 4A, left panel). When refolding was conducted in the presence of buffer alone, the majority of HLA-A2 heavy chains precipitated (Fig. 4A, left panel, lanes 9 and 10). The presence of the control protein (IgG) did not significantly alter the extent of rescue of the HLA-A2 heavy chain (Fig. 4A, left panel, lanes 7 and 8). At a 1:1 ratio relative to HLA-A2, a protective effect of calnexin was observed. Higher levels of HLA-A2 heavy chain were recovered in the soluble fraction compared with the IgG and buffer controls (Fig. 4A, left panel, compare lane 5 with lanes 7 and 9). The amount of HLA-A2 heavy chains recovered in the supernatant was highest in the presence of calnexin that had been preincubated at 47 °C for 1 h (Fig. 4A, left panel, compare lane 3 with lanes 5, 7, and 9). Fig. 4A (right panel) shows a quantification of HLA-A2 heavy chain recovery in the supernatant and pellet fractions (averaged over two independent experiments) following refolding under the indicated conditions. These analyses indicate that the chaperone activity of calnexin was not destroyed by the heat treatment, but was in fact enhanced. To investigate whether HLA-A2 heavy chains that were rescued by calnexin were maintained in a folding-competent state, the assembly of heavy chains with peptides and β2m was assessed. For these analyses, we used a fluorescent HLA-A2-specific peptide (LLDCFPTAAV) and native gel-based fluoroimaging analyses for quantification of assembled HLA-A2·β2m·LLDCFPTAAV complexes (5Rizvi S.M. Mancino L. Thammavongsa V. Cantley R.L. Raghavan M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The remaining supernatants recovered from the analyses shown in Fig. 4A were incubated overnight at 4 °C with excess LLDCFPTAAV and β2m, followed by native PAGE and fluoroimaging analyses to visualize HLAA2·β2m·LLDCFPTAAV complexes. Under these conditions, significantly higher HLA-A2·LLDCFPTAAV complex assembly was apparent under conditions in which calnexin or heat-treated calnexin was present during refolding, with heat-treated calnexin being more efficient (Fig. 4B, left panel). Fig. 4B (right panel) shows a quantification of the relative intensities of the fluorescent bands (averaged over two independent refolding analyses), with the signal obtained for HLA-A2 refolding with heat-treated calnexin set to 100%. Inhibition of HLA-A2 aggregation by calnexin (Fig. 4A, right panel) correlated with a subsequent increase in HLA-A2·peptide complex assembly (Fig. 4B, right panel), indicating that heavy chains rescued from precipitation by calnexin were being maintained in a folding-competent state. Untreated calnexin was ∼2-fold less efficient than heat-treated calnexin, and heat-treated calnexin was at least 4-fold more efficient than the control protein IgG in maintaining a folding-competent form of the HLA-A2 heavy chain. To examine whether calnexin could also enhance the refolding efficiency of a non-glycosylated form of HLA-A2, we used HLA-A2 heavy chains that were separately expressed in E. coli and purified as inclusion bodies using established procedures (8Garboczi D.N. Utz U. Ghosh P. Seth A. Kim J. VanTienhoven E.A. Biddison W.E. Wiley D.C. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5403-5410PubMed Google Scholar). HLA-A2 heavy chains in guanidine hydrochloride (in the absence of β2m) were diluted into refolding buffer (100 mm Tris, 400 mm l-arginine, 5 mm reduced glutathione, 0.5 mm oxidized glutathione, protease inhibitors, and 0.1 mm CaCl2, pH 8.0) containing IgG, untreated calnexin, heat-shocked calnexin, or EGTA-treated calnexin as indicated (Fig. 5A). In the case of calnexin that had been incubated with 10 mm EGTA, HLA-A2 was diluted into refolding buffer that did not contain CaCl2. Under each condition, the amount of heavy chain recovered in the supernatant was quantified (Fig. 5B). When refolding was undertaken in the presence of buffer alone, the majority of HLA-A2 heavy chains precipitated (Fig. 5A, upper and lower panels, lanes 6 and 7). Calnexin protected against HLA-A2 precipitation compared with the IgG control (Fig. 5, A, upper and lower panels, compare lanes 4 and 8; and B, quantifications averaged over two independent experiments). Calnexin-mediated refolding of bacterially expressed HLA-A2 was less efficient compared with refolding of HLA-A2 purified from insect cell supernatants (Fig. 4B at 1:1 HLA-A2/calnexin compared with Fig. 5B at 1:4 HLA-A2/calnexin), as β2m was not included during refolding of bacterially expressed heavy chains, and the heavy chains were already oxidized in the protein purified from insect cells. However, as shown above in Fig. 4, heat-treated calnexin was also more efficient in inhibiting precipitation of non-glycosylated HLA-A2 heavy chains compared with untreated calnexin (Fig. 5, A, upper panel, compare lanes 2 and lane 4; and B, quantifications averaged over two independent experiments). Inhibition of HLA-A2 aggregation was also enhanced when refolding was undertaken in the presence of calnexin and EGTA (Fig. 5, A, lower panel, compare lanes 2 and 4; and B, quantificati"

As expected, the edited form of larch mitochondrial tRNAHis precursor was processed in the isolated organelles. By contrast, no mature tRNAHis was detected when using the unedited version of trnH. However, precursor molecules could be characterized by reverse transcription-PCR. These data demonstrate that the potato mitochondrial editing machinery is not able to recognize these “foreign” editing sites and confirm that these unedited tRNA precursor molecules are not correctly processed in organello. As a consequence, the fate of these RNA precursor molecules is likely to be degradation. Indeed, we detected by PCR two 3′-end truncated precursor RNAs.

Taken together, these data suggest that, in plant mitochondria, a defective unedited RNA precursor that cannot be processed to give a mature stable tRNA, is degraded through a polyadenylation-dependent pathway. In plant mitochondria, the generation of functional tRNA molecules from larger primary transcripts requires several processing steps including the removal of 5′- and 3′-extensions. The processing of the 5′-end is catalyzed by the endoribonuclease RNase P (1Marchfelder A. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1995; 22: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and the removal of the 3′-extremity is performed by another endonuclease termed RNase Z (2Kunzmann A. Brennicke A. Marchfelder A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 108-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Unlike in Escherichia coli, the CCA end of tRNAs is not encoded by plant mitochondrial tRNA genes and this sequence is subsequently added post-transcriptionally by a tRNA nucleotidyltransferase activity (3Fey J. Tomita K. Bergdoll M. Marechal-Drouard L. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 470-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial tRNAs also contain a low number of post-transcriptionally modified nucleotides. Some of these modifications are essential to yield active tRNAs. For instance, initiator tRNAMet has to be formylated (4Maréchal L. Guillemaut P. Grienenberger J.M. Jeannin G. Weil J.H. Plant Mol. Biol. 1986; 7: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and tRNAIle(LAU) is encoded by a mitochondrial gene possessing a methionine-specific CAU anticodon that will be subsequently transformed in a L*AU anticodon (L*, derivative of lysidine), (5Weber F. Dietrich A. Weil J.H. Marechal-Drouard L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5027-5030Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Finally, in higher plant mitochondria, although post-transcriptional cytidine to uridine conversion known as editing mostly affects mRNAs, three tRNAs were also shown to be edited. In the case of potato or Oenothera mitochondrial tRNAPhe and larch mitochondrial tRNAHis, in vitro experiments have shown that editing of precursors is a prerequisite for 5′ and 3′ processing to generate a mature tRNA (6Maréchal-Drouard L.

Chem. 1996; 271: 1898-1903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although biological systems are accurate enough to end up with a high proportion of functional macromolecules, a small number of them probably escape one or several maturation steps leading to defective products. These defective products will likely not accumulate in the cell, first because of potential deleterious effects. As a consequence, various quality control mechanisms exist to correct or eliminate defective macromolecules. DNA repair mechanisms, tmRNA-directed proteolysis of unfinished protein, or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay represent good examples of such mechanisms. However, despite their importance, RNA quality control of stable RNAs is still largely unknown with only few and recent data available. It was shown in E. coli that stable RNA precursors that cannot be converted to their mature forms are polyadenylated and subsequently degraded (9Li Z. Pandit S. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12158-12162Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and that a defective denaturable tRNATrp does not accumulate to normal levels because its precursor is rapidly degraded (10Li Z. Reimers S. Pandit S. Deutscher M.P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1132-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a polyadenylation-mediated RNA surveillance is involved in rRNA biogenesis (11Kuai L. Fang F. Butler J.S. Sherman F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8581-8586Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and was shown to be implicated in the elimination of aberrant tRNAiMet (12Vanacova S. Wolf J. Martin G. Blank D. Dettwiller S. Friedlein A. Langen H. Keith G. Keller W. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e189Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). In plant mitochondria, the existence of such RNA surveillance process remains to be determined. A possible way to investigate a putative RNA surveillance mechanism in plant mitochondria is the expression of defective foreign genes in organello. Indeed, two in organello approaches have been successfully developed for the transformation of isolated plant mitochondria. First, an electroporation-mediated method was described in wheat mitochondria (13Farre J.C. Araya A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2484-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Using this method, splicing and editing of transgene products were studied allowing recognition of cis-elements (14Farre J.C. Leon G. Jordana X. Araya A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6731-6737Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 15Farre J.C. Araya A. Plant J. 2002; 29: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 16Choury D. Farre J.C. Jordana X. Araya A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 6397-6406Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Second, exogenous DNA was incorporated into isolated potato mitochondria via direct DNA uptake (17Koulintchenko M. Konstantinov Y. Dietrich A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1245-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The authors showed that the imported DNA was transcribed within the mitochondria but no other molecular approaches were developed to analyze further the potential use of this transformation procedure in studying the multiple steps involved in plant mitochondrial gene expression. In the present paper, we have taken advantage of this new methodology to determine the fate of tRNA precursor molecules that cannot be efficiently converted in their mature forms in plant mitochondria. We introduced via direct DNA uptake the edited or unedited version of larch mitochondrial trnH into isolated potato mitochondria and expressed them under the control of potato mitochondrial 18 S rRNA promoter. We first show that upon uptake and expression in isolated potato mitochondria, edited larch mitochondrial tRNAHis precursors were faithfully processed in the organelles. By contrast, we present evidence that unedited larch tRNAHis precursor transcripts, although expressed in organello, cannot be edited and converted in mature and stable tRNAs. Rather, two 3′-end truncated precursor RNA species exhibiting poly(A) tails, a hallmark of degradation in plant mitochondria, were detected. These results suggest that, in plant mitochondria, a defective unedited RNA precursor that cannot be processed to give a mature stable tRNA, is transiently polyadenylated and subsequently degraded. Gene Construct for Mitochondrial DNA Import—Edited or unedited larch mitochondrial tRNAHis cDNA sequences with 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences of 21 and 25 nucleotide, respectively (7Maréchal-Drouard L. Kumar R. Remacle C. Small I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3229-3234Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) were amplified by PCR. Using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (18Small I. Marechal-Drouard L. Masson J. Pelletier G. Cosset A. Weil J.H. Dietrich A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1291-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), these fragments were fused downstream of a 178-nucleotide-long fragment containing the promoter sequence of the potato mitochondrial 18 S rRNA gene ((19Giese A. Thalheim C. Brennicke A. Binder S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 429-436PubMed Google Scholar) amplified by PCR from potato (Solanum tuberosum) mitochondrial DNA (Fig. 1). The resulting PCR products were cloned using the TOPO cloning kit (Invitrogen). Finally, the DNA substrates used for mitochondrial DNA import were PCR-amplified from the two constructs with primers flanking the cloning sites. Isolation of Potato Mitochondria, Mitochondrial Import Assays, and Mitochondrial Transcription of Imported DNA—Mitochondria were isolated from potato (S. tuberosum) tubers by differential centrifugation and purification on Percoll gradient as described in (20Fey J. Vermel M. Grienenberger J. Marechal-Drouard L. Gualberto J.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial import of DNA followed by mitochondrial transcription of imported DNA sequences was mostly carried out as described in Ref. 17Koulintchenko M. Konstantinov Y. Dietrich A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1245-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar. Standard mitochondrial DNA import was carried out in 40 mm potassium phosphate and 0.4 m sucrose, pH 7.0 (import buffer). The samples (200 μl) containing 200 ng of DNA and an amount of purified mitochondria corresponding to 1 mg of proteins were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min under mild shaking. After incubation, mitochondria were washed twice with 1 ml of import buffer and resuspended in 240 μl of transcription medium (330 mm sucrose, 90 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 12 mm Tricine, 3The abbreviations used are: Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; L, lysidine; RT, reverse transcription; cRT, circularized reverse transcription. 5 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm EGTA, 1 mm GTP, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ADP, 10 mm sodium succinate, 0.15 mm CTP, 0.15 mm UTP) according to Farre and Araya (13Farre J.C. Araya A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2484-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Upon further incubation for 3 h at 25°C under mild shaking, mitochondria were pelleted, and nucleic acids were extracted with 150 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% (w/v) SDS, pH 7.5, and 1 volume of phenol. After centrifugation, the nucleic acids recovered in the aqueous phase were purified by gel-filtration through a Sephadex G-50 spin column and submitted to RNase-free DNase I (RQ1 DNase, Promega) digestion according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. After ethanol precipitation, the RNA was used as a template for RT-PCR or circular RT-PCR (cRT-PCR). Alternatively, unlabeled UTP was replaced by [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol) in the above transcription medium (100 μCi/240 μl of medium) to generate radioactive transcripts. Following DNA import and transcription, nucleic acids were extracted as above and unincorporated [α-32P]UTP was eliminated by gel-filtration through a Sephadex G-50 spin column. Southern, RT-PCR, and cRT-PCR Analyses—Labeled RNAs were hybridized to Southern blots carrying 1 μg per lane of PCR-generated DNA corresponding to either larch mitochondrial tRNAHis precursor cDNA sequence (see above) or to potato mitochondrial tRNAPhe cDNA precursor sequence (6Maréchal-Drouard L.

All primer sequences used in this study are indicated below and their respective location are shown on the appropriate figures. For RT-PCR experiments, cDNA were synthesized using Super-script™ III (Invitrogen) and the reverse primer P3. PCRs were performed with pairs of primers P3/P4 or P3/P5 using Invitrogen TaqDNA polymerase as follows: 94 °C for 3 min; 30 cycles at 92 °C for 20 s, 50 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. Circular RT-PCR was used to determine 5′- and 3′-extremities of RNA substrates. DNase-treated RNA extracted from mitochondria was incubated with 40 units of T4 RNA ligase (New England Biolabs) in the supplied buffer supplemented with 2 units of RNase inhibitor and in a total volume of 25 μl. After phenol extraction and ethanol cDNAs were synthesized using ImProm-II™ precipitation, reverse transcriptase (Promega) in the presence of reverse primer P1. The region containing the junction of 5′- and 3′-extremities was then amplified by PCR using P1 and P2 primers. PCR amplification was performed as follow: 94 °C for 3 min; 30 cycles at 92 °C for 20 s, 50 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. When indicated, prior to circularization by T4 RNA ligase, RNAs were treated with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions to generate primary transcripts with a 5′-monophosphate extremity. Primer Sequences—PCR primers used in this study are: P1, TCTGACACTCTGACCTATTG; P2, GAAAACACGGGTTCGAATCC; P3, GGGAGAGGGCCTGGTCG; P4, CTTAAGCAAAAATCATAAGA; P5, GAAGAAAAGTTCACAGAAGG. Expression of the Edited Version of Larch trnH in Potato Mitochondria—A PCR product containing the edited version of the larch mitochondrial trnH sequence under the control of the promoter sequence of the potato mitochondrial 18 S rRNA gene (Fig. 1) was incubated with isolated potato mitochondria in standard DNA import conditions. Following import, mitochondria were further incubated for 3 h in a transcription medium and in the presence of [α-32P]UTP to yield labeled transcripts. Labeled transcripts were then hybridized to Southern blots carrying the larch trnH gene or potato trnF gene as internal control. A strong hybridization signal was obtained with the labeled RNAs extracted from mitochondria transformed with the larch trnH gene, whereas no signal was observed with RNA from control mitochondria (i.e. incubated without larch trnH) (Fig. 2). Our results indicated that larch mitochondrial trnH incorporated into potato mitochondria via direct DNA uptake was expressed under the control of a heterologous potato mitochondrial 18 S rRNA promoter. The Edited Version of Larch tRNAHis Is Correctly Processed in Potato Mitochondria—The expression of larch trnH in isolated potato mitochondria was further confirmed by cRT-PCR. Following DNA uptake, mitochondrial RNAs were extracted, circularized by T4 RNA ligase, and used for cRT-PCR analysis. The location of primer P1, used to initiate cDNA synthesis, and of primer P2, used with P1 for PCR amplification, are shown on Fig. 3A. No RT-PCR product was detected when no exogenous DNA was added during the import step preceding transcription. By contrast, a specific reverse transcriptase-dependent product of about 70 nucleotide was amplified when using RNAs extracted from mitochondria transformed with trnH construct (Fig. 3B). The size of this PCR product corresponds to the size of the expected product if the expressed tRNAHis was correctly processed in organello. To confirm this hypothesis, the PCR product was cloned and several clones were analyzed by sequencing. Out of 15 sequences, 7 revealed fully processed larch tRNAHis (Fig. 4) harboring an extra CCA sequence at the 3′-end and a 5′-extremity containing an extra G residue (called G-1), a characteristic of all tRNAHis molecules (21Marck C. Grosjean H. RNA (N. Y.). 2002; 8: 1189-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The presence of these fully processed tRNA molecules indicate correct removal of the 5′- and 3′-extensions on the precursor molecules, thus implying that both potato mitochondrial endonucleases, RNase P at the 5′-end and RNase Z at the 3′-end, were able to recognize, in organello, the edited version of this foreign larch mitochondrial tRNAHis. Furthermore, the post-transcriptional addition of the 3′-CCA sequence demonstrate a correct recognition by the endogenous mitochondrial tRNA-nucleotidyltransferase. Four sequences revealed the same 5′-extremities at G-1, but the 3′ termini was incomplete: either the CCA (2 clones) or CA (2 clones) sequences were missing. The presence of such 3′-truncated tRNA molecules represents a classical situation, resulting for instance from nucleolytic attacks. Unexpectedly, four other sequences revealed the presence of an extra non-encoded T present either at the 5′- or the 3′-ends of the tRNA. Three of these sequences do not contain the additional CCA 3′-end sequence whereas the fourth one does. In conclusion, these experiments showed that the larch mitochondrial trnH precursor transcript expressed in isolated potato mitochondria can be fully processed by removal of the 5′- and 3′-extensions and by 3′-CCA addition. An Unedited Version of Larch Mitochondrial trnH Transcribed in Potato Mitochondria Is Neither Edited nor Correctly Processed—Using direct DNA uptake into plant mitochondria, we tested whether the unedited version of larch mitochondrial tRNAHis precursor transcript could be recognized by the editing machinery of potato mitochondria. We thus introduced in potato mitochondria a chimeric construct corresponding to the unedited version of the larch mitochondrial trnH sequence under the control of the potato mitochondrial 18 S rrn promoter sequence (Fig. 5A). Following transformation, mitochondria were further incubated for 3 h in a transcription medium and total nucleic acids were extracted. As judged by PCR, DNA uptake was efficient (data not shown). However, in contrast to the specific reverse transcriptase-dependent product amplified by cRT-PCR when using the chimeric edited trnH construct (Fig. 3), no cRT-PCR product could be obtained in the presence of primers P1 and P2 (data not shown). Two reasons could explain the absence of an amplification product: either there was no expression of the incorporated DNA in potato mitochondria, or the processing steps leading to a mature and stable tRNAHis were impossible from the unedited tRNA primary transcript. To test the first hypothesis, we performed RT-PCR experiments with the following strategy. First-strand cDNA was synthesized in the presence of primer P3. PCR amplification experiments were then conducted using primer P3 in combination with either primer P4, located upstream of the potato mitochondrial 18 S rRNA promoter sequence, or primer P5, located dowstream of this promoter. A band of 250 bp was amplified only with the P3-P5 combination (Fig. 5B). Cloning and sequencing of this product confirmed the amplification of the unedited version of larch mitochondrial tRNAHis (data not shown). As expected, primer P4 being located upstream of the initiation transcription site, no amplification was observed with the couple of primers P3 and P4. These results indicate that no mature unedited or edited tRNAHis can accumulate in potato mitochondria, although the exogenous DNA was expressed. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that the unedited tRNA precursor molecules are not correctly processed in organello suggesting that the potato mitochondrial editing machinery is not able to recognize these “foreign” editing sites. Analysis of the Fate of Larch Mitochondrial Unedited tRNAHis Precursor Molecules in Potato Mitochondria—As the unedited tRNAHis precursor transcripts are not correctly processed in organello, they represent defective RNA molecules. As a consequence, the fate of these RNAs is likely to be degradation. The long precursor molecules starting close to the initiation transcription site were detected by RT-PCR (Fig. 5). However, these RNA species were not observed in cRT-PCR experiments possibly because the presence of a triphosphate at the 5′ termini of primary transcripts prevents their circularization by T4 RNA ligase. To convert the 5′-triphosphate of primary transcripts to a monophosphate, total RNAs extracted from potato mitochondria transformed with the chimeric 18 S-unedited trnH construct were incubated in the presence of tobacco acid pyrophosphatase prior to their circularization by T4 RNA ligase (Fig. 6A). Circular RT-PCR was then conducted as described above. Interestingly, one major product of 250 bp and a minor product of 180 bp were amplified using primers P1 and P2 (Fig. 6B). The two PCR products were cloned and sequenced. Five clones were analyzed from the largest product and were identical (Fig. 6C, open triangles). The 5′-ends of these cDNAs were located a few nucleotides downstream the nonanucleotide motif usually present in dicot promoters and found in potato mitochondrial 18 S rRNA promoter region (Figs. 1 and 6 and Ref. 19Giese A. Thalheim C. Brennicke A. Binder S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 429-436PubMed Google Scholar). As no cRT-PCR products were obtained in the absence of RNA dephosphorylation, it is likely that this 5′-end corresponds to a true transcription initiation site. Fine-scale mapping of the potato mitochondrial 18 S rRNA primary transcript terminus by primer extension revealed several bands in addition to the bona fide transcription initiation site (19Giese A. Thalheim C. Brennicke A. Binder S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 429-436PubMed Google Scholar). These bands were attributed to premature stops of the reverse transcriptase. Our results suggest that the GTTCA sequence located a few nucleotides downstream from the nonanucleotide motif and corresponding to the region where the extra bands were observed might also initiate transcription. Our data are well supported by those obtained by Kuhn et al. (22Kuhn K. Weihe A. Borner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). They showed, by an extensive analysis of transcription initiation sites using in vitro capping experiments, that most Arabidopsis thaliana mitochondrial genes are expressed from multiple promoters and in particular, four transcription initiation sites were identified for A. thaliana mitochondrial 18 S rrn gene (22Kuhn K. Weihe A. Borner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Vector sequences were still present at the 3′-ends of the transcripts (Fig. 6C) implying that they do not represent true biological intermediates. However, it is interesting to note that these transcripts are polyadenylated (Fig. 6C). Very similar results were obtained when analyzing 8 clones from the 180-bp-long PCR product (Fig. 6C, black arrows). All cDNAs showed the same 5′ termini. Their 5′-ends exactly correspond to the bona fide transcription initiation site determined by primer extension and capping experiments (19Giese A. Thalheim C. Brennicke A. Binder S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 429-436PubMed Google Scholar). This result validates the efficient use of an additional dephosphorylation step before ligation for the analysis of primary transcripts that is otherwise not possible when using this 5′- to 3′-end ligated method. The 3′ termini of the eight cDNAs were located at the 3′-end of the T-stem of larch tRNAHis and short poly(A) tails were observed. Due to the presence of an A in the tRNA sequence, the precise 3′ termini could not be determined: either it is after the last T in the T-stem or it is after the following A. For the same reason, the length of the tails was between 9 and 11 nucleotides. Five clones out of eight exhibited homopolymeric stretches of As, whereas we detected one T and two Cs in the poly(A) tails of the two other cDNAs. The presence of poly(A) tails has already been found at the 3′-end of several plant mitochondrial RNAs (23Perrin R. Meyer E.H. Zaepfel M. Kim Y.J. Mache R. Grienenberger J.M. Gualberto J.M.

Biol. 2001; 21: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and it has been shown that polyadenylation promotes degradation of RNA molecules in plant mitochondria (29Gagliardi D. Stepien P.P. Temperley R.J. Lightowlers R.N. Chrzanowska-Lightowlers Z.M. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 260-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we identified the presence of two types of transcripts corresponding to unedited tRNA precursors both harboring poly(A) tails at their 3′-truncated extremities. It is currently impossible to use stable transformation of higher plant mitochondria to study organellar gene expression. However, two in organello approaches have been recently developed: eletroporation and direct DNA uptake (14Farre J.C. Leon G. Jordana X. Araya A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6731-6737Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 17Koulintchenko M. Konstantinov Y. Dietrich A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1245-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In this report, we have used this direct DNA uptake methodology to transform isolated potato mitochondria with a transgene corresponding to a foreign larch mitochondrial trnH under the control of the potato mitochondrial 18 S rRNA promoter region. As larch mitochondrial trnH shows little homology with the endogenous “chloroplast-like” trnH expressed on the potato mitochondrial genome and contains three editing sites (7Maréchal-Drouard L. Kumar R. Remacle C. Small I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3229-3234Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), it was an interesting substrate to study the fate of precursor transcripts once expressed in the mitochondria. We first showed that precursor transcripts of the edited larch tRNAHis were faithfully processed: the 5′- and 3′-extremities were presumably removed by the RNase P and RNase Z enzymes, and the CCA sequence was added at the 3′-end by the tRNA-nucleotidyltransferase. This is the first report demonstrating that DNA directly incorporated into purified plant mitochondria can be transcribed and subjected to different post-transcriptional steps, leading to a mature and stable RNA. Direct DNA uptake of short DNA fragments into mitochondria is relatively efficient. However, the study of gene expression using this technique still needs to be optimized as, in our hands, expression of the incorporated DNA was not always observed. Among tRNAs, tRNAHis is unique in that it contains an extra base pair in the acceptor stem between G-1 and C73 (Fig. 4). This feature is essential for recognition by histidyl-tRNA synthetase and is conserved between prokaryotes and eukaryotes (30Himeno H. Hasegawa T. Ueda T. Watanabe K. Miura K.S., M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7855-7863Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Whereas the G-1 nucleotide is added post-transcriptionally in eukaryotes (31Cooley L. Appel B. Soll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6475-6479Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), it is present in the precursor transcript in prokaryotes and in chloroplasts because RNase P cuts between -2 and -1 rather than between -1 and 1 as in all other precursor tRNAs (32Burkard U. Soll D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9578-9581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both chloroplast-like potato mitochondrial trnH and larch mitochondrial trnH genes contain a G at the -1 position. When edited larch mitochondrial tRNAHis precursor transcripts were processed in vitro in the presence of an heterologous potato mitochondrial protein extract, two 5′ termini corresponding to G1 and C2 were found by primer extension experiments (7Maréchal-Drouard L. Kumar R. Remacle C. Small I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3229-3234Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). By contrast, we reported here that about two thirds of the mature RNAs obtained after in organello processing corresponded to larch tRNAHis ending at G-1. We cannot exclude a two-step process including first a cleavage by RNase P between G-1 and G1 followed by addition of an extra G as in eukaryotes. However, in organello expression conditions are likely to better reflect the in vivo environment than in vitro experiments. Thus we favor a RNase P cut between -2 and -1 of tRNAHis precursors as in prokaryotes and chloroplasts. When unedited larch mitochondrial tRNAHis precursors were expressed in transformed potato mitochondria, no RNA editing at any of the three usual sites was detected. No homologous sequence of larch mitochondrial tRNAHis does exist in potato mitochondria (7Maréchal-Drouard L. Kumar R. Remacle C. Small I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3229-3234Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The absence of editing modification when transferred in another plant may reflect the absence of the editing trans-factors required for the specific recognition of sequence determinants present on the tRNA precursor molecule. Accordingly, in higher plant mitochondria as well as in chloroplasts, it has been shown that the editing machinery recognizes cis-elements surrounding the C residues involved in mRNA editing. Editing site selection is sequence specific and likely requires trans-factors (for a review, see Ref. 33Gagliardi D. Gualberto J.M. Day D.A. Millar H. Whelan J. Plant mitochondria: From Genome to Function. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2004: 55-82Google Scholar). For instance, when the second exon of petunia mitochondrial coxII-2 gene was transcribed in transgenic tobacco chloroplasts, no RNA editing was observed, demonstrating the presence of editing components that are specific of each organelle (34Sutton C.A. Zoubenko O.V. Hanson M.R. Maliga P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1377-1381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, transcripts of mitochondrial Sorghum bicolor atp6-1 gene expressed in organello upon introduction via electroporation into isolated maize mitochondria, were not edited (35Staudinger M. Bolle N. Kempken F. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2005; 273: 130-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Here, we showed that a foreign mitochondrial tRNA precursor was also not edited when incorporated in the mitochondria of another plant species, supporting the involvement of sequence-specific trans-factors for editing not only of mRNAs but also of stable RNAs. In the absence of editing modification, larch mitochondrial tRNAHis precursor molecules remained unprocessed in potato mitochondria and no accumulation of mature tRNAHis was observed. These in organello data confirmed those obtained in vitro; when incubated with a heterologous potato mitochondrial processing extract, only the edited form of larch mitochondrial tRNAHis precursors were efficiently processed (7Maréchal-Drouard L. Kumar R. Remacle C. Small I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3229-3234Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). As a consequence, the unprocessed tRNA precursor molecules are likely to be considered as defective RNAs by the mitochondria and thus are likely to be degraded. Indeed, we detected, two 3′-truncated polyadenylated primary transcripts. The longest product almost corresponded to a full-length primary transcript, whereas the second one ended within the tRNA molecule. Recently, several authors reported that in plant mitochondria polyadenylated mRNAs and rRNAs are the target for rapid exoribonucleolytic degradation (for a review, see Ref. 33Gagliardi D. Gualberto J.M. Day D.A. Millar H. Whelan J. Plant mitochondria: From Genome to Function. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2004: 55-82Google Scholar). Thus, polyadenylation promotes degradation of RNAs not only in bacteria such as E. coli and in chloroplasts but also in plant mitochondria. In plant mitochondria polyadenylation was shown to regulate the steady-state level of transcripts by acting on several aspects of RNA metabolism such as maturation or degradation. This was recently illustrated for A. thaliana mitochondrial 18 S rRNA metabolism (27Perrin R. Lange H. Grienenberger J.M. Gagliardi D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 5174-5182Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A link between quality control and polyadenylation was also suggested by the characterization of high levels (80%) of polyadenylated 3′-unprocessed transcripts such as atp9 and orfB (23Perrin R. Meyer E.H. Zaepfel M. Kim Y.J. Mache R. Grienenberger J.M. Gualberto J.M. Gagliardi D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25440-25446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether these long pretranscripts can truly be considered as defective. Here we show that when a defective unedited transcript cannot be processed to give a mature and stable tRNA, 3′-truncated and polyadenylated intermediate products are generated. Taking polyadenylation as a hallmark of degradation, these intermediate products are likely good substrates for the plant mitochondrial degradation machinery. The degradation of an unstable tRNATrp has been reported to be dependent on polyadenylation of the precursor molecule in E. coli (10Li Z. Reimers S. Pandit S. Deutscher M.P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1132-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This supports the idea that polyadenylation might serve as a signal to trigger RNA degradation when defective RNAs are not correctly and/or efficiently processed and shows that a quality control system is present in eubacteria for eliminating “bad” RNAs. In S. cerevisiae, a polyadenylation-mediated RNA surveillance was shown to be implicated in the elimination of aberrant tRNAiMet (12Vanacova S. Wolf J. Martin G. Blank D. Dettwiller S. Friedlein A. Langen H. Keith G. Keller W. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e189Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Removal of yeast polyadenylated rRNAs could also be explained by the existence of a surveillance mechanism (11Kuai L. Fang F. Butler J.S. Sherman F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8581-8586Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Here our data suggest that such an RNA quality control involving polyadenylation also probably exists in plant mitochondria. Additional studies are required to know whether this RNA quality control can be extended to other types of defective plant mitochondrial RNAs and whether the activities involved in this process are similar to those already implicated in mRNA and rRNA degradation."

https://openalex.org/W2057313821,"Leptospirosis is an emerging infectious disease whose pathology includes a hemorrhagic response, and sequencing of the Leptospira interrogans genome revealed an ortholog of the vitamin K-dependent (VKD) carboxylase as one of several hemostatic proteins present in the bacterium. Until now, the VKD carboxylase was known to be present only in the animal kingdom (i.e. metazoans that include mammals, fish, snails, and insects), and this restricted distribution and high sequence similarity between metazoan and Leptospira orthologs strongly suggests that Leptospira acquired the VKD carboxylase by horizontal gene transfer. In metazoans, the VKD carboxylase is bifunctional, acting as an epoxidase that oxygenates vitamin K to a strong base and a carboxylase that uses the base to carboxylate Glu residues in VKD proteins, rendering them active in hemostasis and other physiologies. In contrast, the Leptospira ortholog showed epoxidase but not detectable carboxylase activity and divergence in a region of identity in all known metazoan VKD carboxylases that is important to Glu interaction. Furthermore, although the mammalian carboxylase is regulated so that vitamin K epoxidation does not occur unless Glu substrate is present, the Leptospira VKD epoxidase showed unfettered epoxidation in the absence of Glu substrate. Finally, human VKD protein orthologs were not detected in the L. interrogans genome. The combined data, then, suggest that Leptospira exapted the metazoan VKD carboxylase for some use other than VKD protein carboxylation, such as using the strong vitamin K base to drive a new reaction or to promote oxidative damage or depleting vitamin K to indirectly inhibit host VKD protein carboxylation.

The vitamin K-dependent (VKD) 2The abbreviations used are: VKD, vitamin K-dependent; Gla, γ-carboxylated glutamic acid; ORF, open reading frame; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; BES, N,N-bis[2-hydroxyethyl]-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid. carboxylase converts Glu residues to γ-carboxylated Glu (or Gla) residues in VKD proteins. In mammals this post-translational modification is required for VKD protein activities in a wide range of physiologies that includes hemostasis, calcium homeostasis, and growth control (1Berkner K.L. Runge K.W. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2004; 2: 2118-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). VKD protein carboxylation cannot occur in the absence of reduced vitamin K, as the carboxylase uses the energy of oxygenation of the reduced vitamin K to drive Glu carboxylation. Combined chemical modeling and biochemical studies indicate that the carboxylase deprotonates reduced vitamin K to generate a highly reactive vitamin K intermediate (K- in Fig. 1) with sufficient basicity (pKa ∼25) to deprotonate Glu (2Dowd P. Hershline R. Ham S.W. Naganathan S. Science. 1995; 269: 1684-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This Glu carbanion is then carboxylated to Gla by the addition of CO2 while the vitamin K base is protonated to form the vitamin K epoxide product. The carboxylase, then, acts as both a vitamin K epoxidase and a Glu carboxylase and so is a bifunctional enzyme. The carboxylase is characterized by complex interactions with VKD proteins. All mammalian VKD proteins contain a high affinity carboxylase-binding site, usually a propeptide that is cleaved subsequent to carboxylation, that targets them to the carboxylase. Propeptide tethering results in processive carboxylation so that multiple Glu residues in the Gla domains of VKD proteins are all converted to Gla residues (3Stenina O. Pudota B.N.

Full carboxylation transforms the Gla domain into a calcium binding module that promotes binding of the VKD proteins to cell surfaces that contain exposed anionic phospholipids or to hydroxyapatite. Carboxylation was first discovered in mammals; however, more recent studies show that carboxylase activity that depends upon vitamin K is also present in nonmammalian organisms, namely the marine snail Conus and Drosophila (5Bandyopadhyay P.K.

The Conus VKD peptides and mammalian VKD proteins exhibit the same overall organization, i.e. they have a propeptide that is immediately upstream of the Gla domain. However, there is no obvious homology between Conus and mammals in either of these two domains. Nonetheless, interspecies cross-reactivity occurs: the Conus carboxylase can carboxylate a pentapeptide (FLEEL) derived from the mammalian Gla domain as well as a mammalian-derived propeptide-containing substrate (6Czerwiec E.

The Drosophila VKD carboxylase has also been shown to carboxylate FLEEL (7Li T. Yang C.T. Jin D. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18291-18296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Drosophila VKD proteins have not been identified, however, and so the functional consequences of VKD carboxylation in this organism are currently unknown. An important point regarding the Conus and Drosophila carboxylase orthologs is that in both cases they use vitamin K epoxidation to drive Glu carboxylation. Therefore, the fundamental role of vitamin K in these organisms is the same as that in mammals. Until now, the VKD carboxylase was known to be present only in multicellular organisms. Although vitamin K is found in some bacteria and plants, it is used there in respiration or photosynthesis, respectively, and VKD proteins are not present in these organisms. It was therefore a surprise when a VKD carboxylase ortholog was observed in the bacterial pathogen Leptospira interrogans (serovars Lai and Copenhageni) as a consequence of genome sequencing projects (10Nascimento A.L.

Pathogenic Leptospira species that include L. interrogans and L. borgpetersenii cause leptospirosis, a global zoonotic disease characterized by the infection of a wide spectrum of animals and by the potential for severe morbidity and mortality in humans (12Faine S. Leptospira and Leptospirosis. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1994Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms of leptospirosis are poorly understood due to the lack of a transformation method for studying the pathogenic strains (13Zuerner R. Haake D. Adler B. Segers R. Saier M.H. Garcia-Lara J. The Spirochetes: Molecular and Cellular Biology. Horizon Scientific Press, Oxford2001: 137-145Google Scholar). A notable phenotype of fulminant leptospirosis is the hemorrhagic response which, given the critical role of the mammalian carboxylase in hemostasis, raised the question of whether the VKD carboxylase ortholog plays some role in the pathogenesis of this disease. We therefore expressed and analyzed the Leptospira ortholog as a first step toward understanding its function. Our results showed that the Leptospira ortholog is an active enzyme that catalyzes vitamin K epoxidation, but unlike all other known VKD carboxylase orthologs it did not show detectable carboxylation. The Leptospira enzyme was also distinctly different from the mammalian ortholog in showing significant amounts of epoxidation in the absence of Glu substrate. The acquisition of the VKD carboxylase in a pathogen and the altered properties of the acquired protein suggest that vitamin K epoxidation has been adapted for a novel biochemical purpose that may play a role in Leptospira pathology. Isolation and Expression of the L. borgpetersenii VKD Carboxylase Ortholog ORF—The VKD carboxylase ORF was isolated by PCR based on the genome sequence of the region from the L. borgpetersenii serovar hardjo strain JB197. L. borgpetersenii genomic DNA was used as template to amplify the ORF in two parts: a 5′-half using primers Lborg1S (CTGCAGCGATCGGTTCCGGTTATTATGCGA) and Lborg1AS (GGAGCATACTTCTGGATTTCAG) and two different 3′-halves that used primers Lborg2S (GCCACTTTGTTTTTCTCCCC) and either Lborg2AS (GGTACCCTATTCTTCGTCTCCGGAGAAAAC) or Lborg2NAS (TGCGGCCGCTTCTTCGTCTCCGGAGAAAAC). The Lborg2S+Lborg2AS oligonucleotides amplify the 3′-ORF and stop codon, whereas the Lborg2S+Lborg2NAS oligonucleotides replace the stop codon with nine base pairs that encode 3 Alas and a NotI site. The three PCR products were separately cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The correct 5′-PstI-BglII product and 3′-BglII-Acc65 I product from the Lborg2S+Lborg2AS amplification were cloned into PstI-Acc65 I-digested pBacPAK8 (Clontech). The resulting plasmid, Lepto.borg-pBacPAK8, was digested with Acc65 I and BglII, and the large fragment was ligated with the BglII-NotI fragment from Lborg2S+Lborg2NAS and the annealed oligonucleotides NotFLAG (GGCCGCTGACTACAAAGACGATGACGACAAGTGAG) and Acc65FLAG (GTACCTCACTTGTCGTCATCGTCTTTGTAGTCAGC). The resulting plasmid, Lepto.borgFLAG-pBacPAK8, contains the L. borgpetersenii VKD carboxylase ortholog ORF with 3 Alas followed by the FLAG epitope tag (DYKDDDDK), which was confirmed by resequencing the entire ORF. Both plasmids (Lepto.borg-pBacPAK8 and Lepto.borgFLAG-pBacPAK8) were used to generate baculovirus, as before (14Berkner K.L. McNally B.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 282: 313-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and plaques were screened by a Western using anti-FLAG antibody or by activity assay. Preparative amounts of baculovirus were then generated by amplifying the virus in insect cells (15Rishavy M.A. Pudota B.N. Hallgren K.W. Qian W. Yakubenko A.V. Song J.H. Runge K.W. Berkner K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13732-13737Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Enzyme Assays—Microsomes (4 mg/ml) were solubilized with CHAPS (0.5% final concentration) in the presence of 5 μm factor X propeptide, followed by centrifugation at 105 × g for 1 h, all at 4 °C. The supernatants were either assayed directly or were first purified on anti-FLAG-agarose (Sigma). Supernatant (0.5-1 ml) was adsorbed to resin (100 μl) by overnight incubation at 4 °C, and the resin was then washed with 25 mm Tris, 0.25% CHAPS, 0.25% phosphatidyl choline, and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. Enzyme was eluted by incubating the resin with FLAG peptide (100 μg/ml; Sigma) for 1 h at 20°C. As indicated under “Results,” in one experiment resin-bound protein was assayed, rather than eluted material, because the Leptospira ortholog was not expressed at very high levels and assaying the resin-bound material allowed more concentrated samples to be analyzed. Carboxylase activity was assayed in reactions containing final concentrations of 0.6 m ammonium sulfate, 0.06% CHAPS, 0.06% sodium cholate, 0.06% phosphatidyl choline, 1.1 mm [14CO2]NaHCO3, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 9 μm propeptide, 130 μm vitamin K hydroquinone, 45 mm BES, pH 6.6, and 2.5 mm substrate (FLEEL (Sigma), EEL (Bachem), or TxIX (Anaspec)). Reactions were quenched with trichloroacetic acid and then processed for scintillation counting as previously described (14Berkner K.L. McNally B.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 282: 313-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Epoxidase activity was assayed using the same reaction mixture except that the NaHCO3 was unlabeled. The epoxidase reactions were quenched by the addition of 2.5 volumes of 3:2 2-propanol:hexane. Samples were extracted and analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography as before (16Pudota B.N. Miyagi M. Hallgren K.W. West K.A. Crabb J.W. Misono K.S. Berkner K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13033-13038Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) except for the addition here of a standard (2 nmol K25, GL Synthesis) added after reaction quenching, which controlled for variation in vitamin K recovery during extraction. Vitamin K epoxide formation was quantitated either by direct integration of the peak using the high pressure liquid chromatography system or by scanning the chromatogram and creating TIFF files that were then analyzed by ImageQuant (Amersham Biosciences). Both methods were validated using a vitamin K epoxide standard curve. To determine the specific activity of the Leptospira ortholog, the amount of protein was quantitated using a fluorescence-based assay. Leptospira ortholog samples were gel electrophoresed along with a standard curve of human carboxylase of known concentration as well as a control FLAG-BAP fusion protein (Sigma). The gel was then processed in a Western using anti-FLAG antibody (0.4 μg/ml), doubly purified anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Bio-Rad), and AttoPhos substrate (Promega, used as instructed) followed by quantitation using a StormImager.

Orthologs from two additional Leptospira pathogens were subsequently identified: the sequenced genome of L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni was shown to encode a protein (REFSEQ: accession NC_005823.1) identical to the L. interrogans serovar Lai ORF except for an N238K substitution (10Nascimento A.L.

S1 and S2). A reciprocal BLAST search using the L. interrogans serovar Lai ORF as the query against the non-redundant protein data base identified VKD carboxylases in fish (Opsanus tau), a marine snail (Conus textile), insect (Drosophila melanogaster), and in several mammals, with E values ranging from 10-26 to 10-22. Notably, the sequence similarities extended over most of the length of the proteins (Fig. 2). In addition, protein structural predictions reinforced the similarity between the metazoan and Leptospira VKD orthologs, as their sequences all predicted similar membrane topologies (supplemental Fig. S2) (5Bandyopadhyay P.K.

VKD substrates for the carboxylase were not detected in the L. interrogans genome as no significant matches were found (E values >0.06) to the human VKD proteins factor VII, factor IX, protein Z, protein C, protein S, matrix Gla protein, osteocalcin, PRGP1, PRGP2, TMG3, TMG4, and Gas6. The existence of the VKD carboxylase ortholog in Leptospira was quite surprising because previously VKD carboxylases were only known to be present in the animal kingdom (i.e. Fig. 3, metazoans). The BLAST search with the L. interrogans ORF as the query also revealed VKD carboxylase orthologs in Cytophaga hutchinsonii and in environmental sequences (i.e. sequences isolated from shotgun sequencing of random bacterial samples from the Sargasso sea) (18Venter J.C. Remington K. Heidelberg J.F. Halpern A.L. Rusch D. Eisen J.A. Wu D. Paulsen I. Nelson K.E. Nelson W. Fouts D.E. Levy S. Knap A.H. Lomas M.W. Nealson K. White O. Peterson J. Hoffman J. Parsons R. Baden-Tillson H. Pfannkoch C. Rogers Y.H. Smith H.O. Science. 2004; 304: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (3222) Google Scholar). This occurrence in bacteria is low, as scores of bacterial genomes have now been sequenced and VKD carboxylase orthologs are not detected in these genomes. In addition, similar VKD carboxylase orthologs are not observed in fungi, plants, protozoa, or archea bacteria despite the presence of a large number of completely sequenced genomes from these kingdoms (Fig. 3). This restricted distribution and the high degree of homology between these bacterial and metazoan orthologs strongly suggest horizontal transfer of genetic information between species (19Syvanen M. Kado C.I. Horizontal Gene Transfer. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2002Google Scholar), with VKD carboxylase mRNA from a Leptospira-infected animal being incorporated into the bacterial genome. This interpretation is supported by the presence of several other sequences in the L. interrogans serovar Lai and Copenhageni genomes that are similar to mammalian genes, i.e. platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (NP_712325 and YP_001728), two von Willebrand factor type A domain proteins: batA (NP_714598 and YP_003432) and batB (NP_714599 and YP_003433) and paraoxonase 3 (NP_710580 and YP_000337) (10Nascimento A.L.

The evolution of these Leptospira proteins and their relationships to metazoan counterparts provides a unique opportunity to examine their structure and function. Therefore, the L. borgpetersenii VKD carboxylase ortholog was expressed and analyzed as a first step in the characterization of these proteins. The Leptospira VKD Carboxylase Ortholog Is a Membrane-bound Protein—The Leptospira VKD carboxylase ortholog was produced in SF21 cells because these cells do not express endogenous carboxylase activity but can synthesize active enzyme when cDNAs encoding carboxylases from several different species (mammals, Conus, and Drosophila) (6Czerwiec E. Begley G.S. Bronstein M. Stenflo J. Taylor K. Furie B.C. Furie B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 6162-6172Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 7Li T. Yang C.T. Jin D. Stafford D.W. J. Biol.

A. 1993; 90: 8372-8376Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) are exogenously introduced. Baculovirus containing the Leptospira ortholog with a C-terminal FLAG epitope was generated and used to infect SF21 cells, and the expression of this protein was monitored by Western analysis. Virtually all of the Leptospira ortholog was recovered in the microsomal fraction (Fig. 4A), which is the same result obtained with mammalian (bovine and human) VKD carboxylases and is consistent with the hydrophobic sequences predicted by the Leptospira gene (supplemental Fig. S2). The gene also predicted a potential N-glycosylation site that would not result in glycosylation in the Leptospira bacterium but could conceivably be glycosylated during insect cell expression. We therefore tested for endoglycosidase H sensitivity. Treatment of human carboxylase with endoglycosidase H resulted in a decrease in the size of the observed band (Fig. 4B), as expected. The Leptospira ortholog, however, was unaffected by endoglycosidase H treatment, indicating that N-glycosylation did not occur and therefore would not affect the function of the Leptospira ortholog expressed by insect cells. The Leptospira Ortholog Has Epoxidase Activity—In all known VKD carboxylases, the epoxidation of vitamin K hydroquinone provides the energy required for the carboxylation reaction, and so epoxidation is a prerequisite of carboxylation. We therefore tested whether the Leptospira ortholog could convert vitamin K hydroquinone to vitamin K epoxide. The results showed that the Leptospira ortholog, like the human VKD carboxylase ortholog, had epoxidase activity that was dose-dependent (Fig. 5). Activity was not observed in mock-infected cells or in cells infected with an irrelevant virus (containing factor IX), showing that activity was specific to the Leptospira or human orthologs. The specific activity of the Leptospira epoxidase was compared with that of the human enzyme by performing epoxidase assays in parallel with protein determination by a quantitative Western. This analysis showed that the Leptospira ortholog specific activity was lower (18%, TABLE ONE) but still comparable with that of the human carboxylase.TABLE ONEThe Leptospira VKD epoxidase specific activity is similar to that of the human ortholog Ortholog Specific activity pmol KO epoxide/pmol enzyme/h % Human 1171 100 Leptospira 215 18 Open table in a new tab The human and Leptospira orthologs were both tagged at the C terminus with a FLAG epitope, which we showed did not have any effect upon their specific activities. Thus, we previously showed that FLAG-tagged and untagged human carboxylases have the same specific activity (15Rishavy M.A. Pudota B.N. Hallgren K.W. Qian W. Yakubenko A.V. Song J.H. Runge K.W. Berkner K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Another condition that was tested for effect on Leptospira activity was pH value, because epoxidation is initiated by a catalytic base that requires deprotonation for reactivity (Fig. 1) and therefore is dependent upon pH values. Comparison of the activities of the Leptospira and human orthologs at several pH values showed that the response of activity to pH was similar for both enzymes (data not shown). Leptospira Vitamin K Epoxidation Does Not Result in Detectable Carboxylation—Human carboxylase and the Leptospira ortholog were assayed for carboxylase activity by measuring 14CO2 incorporation into peptide substrates, and epoxidase assays were carried out in parallel. Activity was measured using either solubilized microsomes or samples concentrated and purified on anti-FLAG antibody resin. When human carboxylase was assayed using mammalian-derived substrates (EEL, FLEEL), the amount of epoxidation observed was almost identical to that of carboxylation (i.e. giving an epoxidation:carboxylation ratio of 1.1:1.2, TABLE TWO). These data for human carboxylase were obtained with enzyme assayed in the presence of propeptide. However, the same ratio was observed when the human carboxylase was assayed in the absence of propeptide (data not shown), which is consistent with results previously reported with bovine carboxylase (21Sugiura I. Furie B. Walsh C.T. Furie B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In developing rat cerebellum, <i>Lot1</i> expression is high in cerebellar granule cells (CGC), a neuronal population undergoing postnatal neurogenesis. The time course of <i>Lot1</i> cerebellar expression closely matches the expression of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) receptors coupled to adenylyl cyclase. The aim of this study was to ascertain whether <i>Lot1</i> expression is regulated by cAMP-dependent pathways and to identify mechanisms of <i>Lot1</i> activation in CGC cultures. Our results show that <i>Lot1</i> expression in CGC is cAMP-dependent, as treatments with either forskolin or PACAP-38 induced an increase in its expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. This effect on <i>Lot1</i> expression was mimicked by dibutyryl cAMP and suppressed by protein kinase A and MEK inhibitors. In parallel, we found that treatments with forskolin and PACAP-38 in precursor CGC inhibited bromodeoxyuridine incorporation by 25 and 35%, respectively, indicating a negative effect on neuronal precursor proliferation. Luciferase reporter analysis and mutagenesis of the <i>Lot1</i> promoter region indicated a crucial role of the AP1-binding site (located at -268 bp) in cAMP-induced <i>Lot1</i> transcription. In addition, cotransfection experiments indicated that the c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimer is responsible for cAMP-dependent <i>Lot1</i> transcriptional activation. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that, in CGC, <i>Lot1</i> is under the transcriptional control of cAMP through an AP1 site regulated by the c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimer and suggest that this gene may be an important element of the cAMP-mediated pathway that regulates neuronal proliferation through the protein kinase A-MEK signaling cascade."

https://openalex.org/W2112824098,"Prematurity is one of the leading causes of infant mortality. It may result from intrauterine infection, which mediates premature labor by stimulating the production of inflammatory lipid mediators such as prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α). The biological effects of PGF2α are mediated via the G protein-coupled receptor FP; however, the molecular mechanism(s) of FP signaling that mediates inflammatory lipid mediator production remains unclear. We reported previously that in the human uterus, a composite organ in which fibroblast, epithelial, and smooth muscle cells are the major constituents, an inverse relationship exists between the levels of PGF2α and a steroid-inducible anti-inflammatory protein, uteroglobin. Here we report that, in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and human uterine smooth muscle cells, FP signaling is mediated via multi-kinase pathways in a cell type-specific manner to activate NF-κB, thus stimulating the expression of cyclooxygenase-2. Cyclooxygenase-2 is a critical enzyme for the production of prostaglandins from arachidonic acid, which is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2, the expression of which is also stimulated by PGF2α. Most importantly, uteroglobin inhibits FP-mediated NF-κB activation and cyclooxygenase-2 gene expression by binding and most likely by sequestering PGF2α into its central hydrophobic cavity, thereby preventing FP-PGF2α interaction and suppressing the production of inflammatory lipid mediators. We propose that uteroglobin plays important roles in maintaining homeostasis in organs that are vulnerable to inadvertent stimulation of FP-mediated inflammatory response.

Uteroglobin (UG), 4The abbreviations used are: UG, uteroglobin; AA, arachidonic acid; BSA, bovine serum albumin; COX, cyclooxygenase; cPLA2, cytosolic phospholipase 2; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; FBS, fetal bovine serum; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; hUG, human uteroglobin; hUSM, human uterine smooth muscle; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; NF, nuclear factor; PG, prostaglandin; PGA1, prostaglandin A1; PGF2α, prostaglandin F2α; PKC, protein kinase C; PLA2, phospholipase 2. also known as Clara cell 10-kDa protein (CC10), is a founding member of the secretoglobin superfamily (1Klug J. Beier H.M. Bernard A. Chilton B.S. Fleming T.P. Lehrer R.I. Miele L. Pattabiraman N. Singh S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 923: 349-356Google Scholar). This protein is secreted by the mucosal epithelia of all mammalian organs that communicate with the external environment. In the uterus, UG gene expression is induced by progesterone (2Krishnan R.S. Daniel Jr., J.C. Science. 1967; 158: 490-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and this induction is further augmented by prolactin (3Hewetson A. Chilton B.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 136: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In the respiratory system, the tracheobronchial epithelia constitutively express UG at a very high level and may be further stimulated by corticosteroids. During the past two decades it has been established that UG is a multifunctional protein with potent anti-inflammatory and anti-chemotactic properties (reviewed in Ref. 4Mukherjee A.B. Kundu G.C. Mantile-Selvaggi G. Yuan C.J. Mandal A.K. Chattopadhyay S. Zheng F. Pattabiraman N. Zhang Z. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 771-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that this protein may have receptor-mediated functions (5Kundu G.C. Mantile G. Miele L. Cordella-Miele E. Mukherjee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22819-22824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Furthermore, UG has been reported to bind hydrophobic ligands such as progesterone (7Beato M. J. Steroid Biochem. 1976; 7: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and polychlorinated biphenyls (8Nordlund-Moller L. Andersson O. Ahlgren R. Schilling J. Gillner M. Gustafsson J.A. Lund J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12690-12693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Structurally, UG is a homodimer in which the two 70-amino acid subunits are joined in antiparallel orientation by two interchain disulfide bridges forming a large central hydrophobic cavity, which may harbor hydrophobic ligands (9Mandal A.K. Zhang Z. Ray R. Choi M.S. Chowdhury B. Pattabiraman N. Mukherjee A.B. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 1317-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Each subunit of UG forms four α-helices, and the active site of its anti-inflammatory properties appears to reside in a nonapeptide region (residues 39-47) of the α-helix 3 (10Miele L. Cordella-Miele E. Facchiano A. Mukherjee A.B. Nature. 1988; 335: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). We reported previously that in the human uterus (11Kikukawa T. Cowan B.D. Tejada R.I. Mukherjee A.B. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1988; 67: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and in fetal rabbit lungs (12Peri A. Dubin N.H. Dhanireddy R. Mukherjee A.B. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 96: 343-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) an inverse relationship exists between the levels of UG and prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α). Prostaglandins (PGs) are a family of biologically active lipids that mediate numerous physiological and pathological processes (13Moncada S. Flower S.J. Vane J.R. Gilman A.G. Goodman L.S. Rall T.W. Murad F. The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics. 7. McGraw-Hill, New York1985: 660-673Google Scholar) via heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptors. Cyclooxygenases (COXs) (14Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33157-33160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar) are the key enzymes responsible for PG synthesis from arachidonic acid, which is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2 (PLA2) catalysis (15Murakami M. Kudo I. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2003; 525: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). One of the PGs, PGF2α, plays critical roles in important biological processes such as inflammation, uterine smooth muscle contraction, cervical ripening, and initiation of parturition (reviewed in 16Soloff M.S. Wynn R.M. Jollie W.P. Biology of the Uterus. 2nd. Plenum Medical Publishing, New York1989: 559-607Crossref Google Scholar). During normal pregnancy, the strong contractions of uterine smooth muscles (i.e. myometrium) do not occur until term. It has been reported that PGF2α mediates uterine smooth muscle contractility via its receptor, FP (17Senior J. Marshall K. Sangha R. Clayton J.K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 108: 501-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), and that mice in which the FP gene has been inactivated by gene targeting fail to initiate parturition (18Sugimoto Y. Yamasaki A. Segi E. Tsuboi K. Aze A. Nishimura T. Oida H. Yoshida N. Tanaka T. Katsuyama M. Hasumoto K.-Y. Murata T. Hirata M. Ushikubi F. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. Narumiya S. Science. 1997; 277: 681-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been reported that inhibitors of COX-2, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, may adversely affect fertilization, decidualization, implantation, and, consequently, delay the initiation of parturition (19Norman R.J. Wu R. Fertil. Steril. 2004; 81: 493-494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although these important biological functions of PGF2α may be mediated via FP (20Senior J. Sangha R. Baxter G.S. Marshall K. Clayton J.K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 107: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), neither the molecular mechanisms of FP signaling nor the mechanism(s) by which the maternal organisms prevent inadvertent stimulation of PGF2α-induced pro-inflammatory lipid mediator production in the uterus are clear. This is an important question, as it has been reported that intrauterine infection is a major cause of premature labor and birth (reviewed in 21Romero R. Espinoza J. Chaiworapongsa T. Kalache K. Semin. Neonatol. 2002; 7: 259-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) that may be induced by PGs (22Wu W.X. Ma X.H. Coksaygan T. Chakrabarty K. Collins V. Rose J. Nathanielsz P.W. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 1444-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), although the molecular mechanisms are unknown. Here we report that FP signaling is mediated via multi-kinase pathways in a cell type-specific manner, leading to the activation of NF-κB. The activation of NF-κB stimulates the expression of COX-2, critical for the generation of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids by cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2), the expression of which is also stimulated by PGF2α. Thus, PGF2α coordinately mediates the expression of two genes, COX-2 and cPLA2, which are critical for inflammatory lipid mediator generation. Most importantly, our results demonstrate that UG binds and most likely sequesters PGF2α, preventing interaction with its receptor and down-regulating FP-mediated activation of NF-κB, thereby inhibiting COX-2 gene expression. We propose that these effects of UG play important roles in maintaining homeostasis in organs that are prone to invasion by myriad agents that can inadvertently stimulate PGF2α-mediated inflammatory response. Materials—The NIH 3T3 and human uterine smooth muscle cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and Cambrex, Inc. (Walkersville, MD), respectively. PGs were purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). RNAzol B was purchased from Tel Test Inc. (Friendswood, TX). [α32P]dCTP and the Hybond N+ membrane were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. [3H]PGF2α was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. (St Louis, MO). A protein kinase C inhibitor (bisindolyl maleimide III), a p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580), NF-κB-specific inhibitors (pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate and NF-κB SN50), and a p44/42 inhibitor (PD98059) were purchased from Calbiochem. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was from Hyclone (Logan, UT), and Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium, penicillin G, streptomycin, and glutamine were from Biofluids (Rockville, MD). ExpressHyb solution was purchased from Clontech. Mouse monoclonal anti-cPLA2 and goat polyclonal anti-COX-2 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). An FP receptor antibody was purchased from Cayman chemical company (Ann Arbor, MI). The recombinant human uteroglobin (hUG) was produced in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (23Miele L. Cordella-Miele E. Mukherjee A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6427-6435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Mantile G. Miele L. Cordella-Miele E. Sing G. Katyal S.L. Mukherjee A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20343-20351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Treatment—Human uterine smooth muscle (hUSM) cells were grown in their specified SmGM-2 medium (Biowhittaker, Inc., Walkersville, MD). At 70% confluence, the cells were washed one time with smooth muscle basal medium (without the growth factors and serum) and then cultured in smooth muscle basal medium with PGF2α (100 nm), hUG (10-150 nm), and BSA (150 nm) for the indicated periods of time (Fig. 1A). The NIH 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were grown in their respective recommended growth medium to 70-80% confluence, washed once with the OptiMem-1 medium (Invitrogen) containing 2.5% FBS and then treated with effectors as described in 20 ml of OptiMem-1 medium containing 2.5% FBS for the indicated periods of time (Fig. 1B) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. All kinase inhibitors were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), and for each inhibitor a final concentration of 10 μm was maintained. Inhibition of FP Expression by FP Antisense S-Oligonucleotide—A phosphorothioate FP antisense oligo (5′-TCTCGATGGCCATCGCACTG-3′) was designed to inhibit FP expression. As a control, the corresponding sense oligo (5′-CAGTGCGATGGCCATCGAGA-3′) was used. When the cells reached 30-40% confluence, they were rinsed once with serum-free Opti-MEM I medium. The oligonucleotides were then delivered to the cells by Oligofectamine™ reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 28 h, the cells were stimulated with PGF2α, and total proteins were isolated. The relative levels of FP and COX-2 proteins were estimated by Western blot analysis. RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNAs were isolated from cells using RNAzolB (TelTest, Friendswood, TX) following the supplier's protocol. Equal amounts (40 μg) of the total RNA, loaded on each lane, were resolved by electrophoresis on 1.5% formaldehyde/formamide-agarose gels. Following electrophoresis, RNAs were transferred to the maximum strength Hybond N+ and cross-linked using the UV Stratalinker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The RNA blots were hybridized at 68 °C in ExpressHyb solution containing [α32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probes generated by random priming (Invitrogen). The RNA blots were then washed several times with 2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at room temperature and twice with 0.1× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 50 °C for 40 min. Normalization of the amount of RNA loaded was achieved by hybridizing the same blots with a GAPDH probe after removal of the previous probe by boiling in 0.5% SDS for 10 min. Western Blot Analysis—Semi-confluent cells, previously grown in their recommended growth medium in 12-well culture plates, were washed once with OptiMem-1 medium containing 2.5% FBS and then treated with PGF2α for indicated time intervals in OptiMem-1 medium containing 2.5% FBS. Cell lysates were prepared in presence of protease inhibitors. Total proteins in the samples were estimated by using Bio-Rad protein assay dye (Bio-Rad Laboratories) using BSA as the standard. Equal amounts (40 μg) of the total protein from each sample were loaded in the gel and resolved by electrophoresis using 7.5 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under denaturing and reducing conditions. Proteins were then electrotransferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Immobilon P; Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA), blocked with 5% BSA in 1× phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 0.1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C overnight, and then subjected to immunoblot analysis using mouse monoclonal anti-cPLA2/goat polyclonal anti-COX-2 or rabbit polyclonal FP antibodies. This was followed by incubation with anti-mouse/goat or rabbit IgGs conjugated with horse-radish peroxidase and detection of chemiluminesence by an ECL system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Analysis—Cells were grown previously in their respective growth medium to 70-80% confluence, washed once with the OptiMem-1 medium (Invitrogen) containing 2.5% FBS and then treated with 20 ml of OptiMem-1 medium containing 2.5% FBS and other effectors as indicated for 1 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were then harvested, washed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline buffer, and used for nuclear extract preparation following a supplied protocol of GENEKA Biotech Inc. (Montreal, Canada). Electrophoretic mobility shift analyses (EMSAs) were performed using the nuclear extracts (20 μg protein) on a non-denaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel following a supplied protocol of GENEKA Biotech Inc. (Montreal, Canada) with the oligonucleotides 5′-GAGAGGTGAGGGGATTCCCTTAGTTAGGAC-3′ (wild type NF-κB) and 5′-GAGAGGTGAGATGATAGCCTTAGTTAGGAC-3′ (mutated NF-κB). NF-κB double-stranded oligonucleotides were generated by annealing sense and antisense oligonucleotides without and with mutations (boldface residues). Specificity of protein-DNA complexes was verified either by competing with non-radioactive wild type NF-κB/murine NF-κB oligos or by immunoreactivity with polyclonal antibodies specific for p65/p50 subunits of NF-κB. UG-[3H]PGF2α Binding Assay—An assay for the detection of the UG-[3H]PGF2α complex was performed as described previously (9Mandal A.K. Zhang Z. Ray R. Choi M.S. Chowdhury B. Pattabiraman N. Mukherjee A.B. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 1317-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, in 20 μl of reaction mixture 50 pmol of [3H]PGF2α were incubated with 25 pmol of recombinant UG in the absence and presence of varying concentrations of non-radioactive PGF2α. After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, aliquots were resolved by electrophoresis using non-denaturing and non-reducing 15% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried, and autoradiographs were obtained by using a BAS-15 phosphorimaging device (Fuji). Molecular Modeling—The two-dimensional chemical structure of PGF2α was converted to a three-dimensional structure using the CONCORD module of Tripos software (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO). Docking of one molecule of PGF2α into the hydrophobic cavity of hUG (25Pattabiraman N. Matthews J.H. Ward K.B. Mantile-Selvaggi G. Miele L. Mukherjee A.B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 923: 113-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) was difficult, as there were no hydrogen bonds between the COOH and OH groups in the five-membered ring and the Tyr-21 residues in the two monomers. On analyzing the docking modes, we found that the cis double bond in the A chain of PGF2α makes the chain shorter and does not interact symmetrically with Tyr-21 residues in the dimer. A high-resolution crystal structure of PGF2α has been published and is available in the Cambridge Data Base (26Weinges K. Huber W. Huber-Patz U. Imgartinger H. Nixdorf M. Rodewald H. Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1984; : 761-772Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This compound was crystallized as a dimer in which the hydrophobic A and B chains interact and form a structure such that the COOH groups are in the opposite side of the dimer. Because of this stacking interaction, two molecules of PGF2α could interact symmetrically with Tyr-21 in both monomers, which is similar to the interaction found in the reported crystal structure of the UG-polychlorinated biphenyl complex (27Hard T. Barnes H.J. Larsson C. Gustafsson J.A. Lund J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 983-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We docked two PGF2α molecules into the central hydrophobic cavity of the reported crystal structure of hUG (25Pattabiraman N. Matthews J.H. Ward K.B. Mantile-Selvaggi G. Miele L. Mukherjee A.B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 923: 113-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), which was energy minimized using the cff91 force field of the DISCOVER module of InsightII molecular simulation software (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA). A distance-dependent dielectric constant was used for the calculation of the electrostatic interaction. PGF2α Stimulates COX-2 Gene Expression—During the past decade it has been increasingly evident that two COX enzymes, COX-1 and COX-2, play critical roles in the production of PGH2, the first step in eicosanoid biosynthesis. It was further realized that COX-1 is essential for the production and maintenance of physiological levels of prostanoids and that COX-2 is responsible for the production of prostanoids that are found in sites of disease and inflammation. Thus, COX-2 has been the prime target of anti-inflammatory drug development (reviewed in Ref. 28Warner T.D. Mitchell J.A. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 790-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). It has been reported that COX-2 gene expression is inducible by various agonists (13Moncada S. Flower S.J. Vane J.R. Gilman A.G. Goodman L.S. Rall T.W. Murad F. The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics. 7. McGraw-Hill, New York1985: 660-673Google Scholar, 14Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33157-33160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar, 29Morita I. Schindler M. Regier M.K. Otto J.C. Hori T. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol.

Therefore, we sought to determine whether PGF2α stimulates COX-2 gene expression in hUSM and in NIH 3T3 cells. Accordingly, we treated hUSM and NIH 3T3 cells with PGF2α at varying concentrations and for varying lengths of time and analyzed the expression of COX-2 mRNA by Northern blot analyses. We found that PGF2α, in a time-dependent manner, stimulates COX-2 mRNA and COX-2 protein expression in both hUSM (Fig. 1A) and NIH 3T3 (Fig. 1B) cells. The ethanol-treated control cells did not show any elevation of COX-2 expression over basal levels. Taken together, these results suggest that in hUSM and NIH 3T3 cells PGF2α stimulates COX-2 gene expression. PGF2α-stimulated COX-2 Expression Is Mediated via FP—To determine whether PGF2α stimulates COX-2 expression via its receptor, FP, we determined the expression of the FP protein in hUSM and in NIH 3T3 cells by Western blot analysis. The results show that both of these cell types express FP (Fig. 2A). To further delineate whether PGF2α-mediated COX-2 expression is mediated via FP, we inhibited FP expression in NIH 3T3 cells by FP antisense S-oligonucleotide treatment followed by stimulation of the cells with PGF2α. The FP sense S-oligo treatment served as a control. The results show that antisense-mediated inhibition of FP expression (Fig. 2B, upper section, far right lane) markedly suppresses COX-2 expression (Fig. 2B, middle section, far right lane). As expected, the expression of FP and COX-2 proteins was not inhibited in untreated and FP sense S-oligo-treated cells (Fig. 2B, upper and middle sections, second and third lanes from the left). These results demonstrate that both NIH 3T3 and hUSM cells express FP and that PGF2α-mediated COX-2 gene expression requires FP. PGF2α Stimulates cPLA2 Expression—The biological effects of PGF2α on uterine smooth muscle contraction, cell proliferation, luteolysis, and parturition are suggested to be mediated via pro-inflammatory lipid mediator production (17Senior J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 21505-21513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Thus, in the present study we sought to determine whether PGF2α stimulates the expression of genes that play critical roles in the production of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators (e.g. PGs, leukotrienes, and the platelet-activating factor). The rate-limiting substrate for the generation of these mediators is arachidonic acid (AA), the production of which from membrane phospholipids is catalyzed by PLA2s; 15). Because cPLA2 expression is reported to be stimulated by various agonists (38Nakao A. Watanabe T. Taniguchi S. Nakamura M. Honda Z. Shimizu T. Kurokawa K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 155: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and because NIH 3T3 cells express FP (our results and Refs. 39Watanabe T. Satoh H. Togoh M. Taniguchi S. Hashimoto Y. Kurokawa K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 169: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar and 40Yamamoto K. Arakawa T. Ueda N. Yamamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31315-31320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar), we first determined if cPLA2 expression in NIH 3T3 cells is stimulated by PGF2α. Accordingly, we treated NIH 3T3 cells with PGF2α for varying lengths of time and analyzed the expression of cPLA2 mRNA and protein by Northern and Western blot analyses, respectively. Our results show that PGF2α stimulates the expression of cPLA2 mRNA (Fig. 3A) and protein (Fig. 3B) suggesting that FP signaling may regulate AA release from cellular phospholipids mediated by cPLA2 catalysis. FP Signaling Is Mediated via Multiple Kinase Pathways in a Cell Type-specific Manner—Prostaglandins are known to exert their biological effects via heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptors. To delineate the intracellular mechanism(s) of signaling via the PGF2α receptor, FP, we examined various signaling pathways using specific pharmacological inhibitors of kinases. We found that PGF2α-mediated stimulation of COX-2 mRNA expression was strongly inhibited by a specific PKC-inhibitor, bisindolyl maleimide III, in NIH 3T3 (Fig. 4A) cells. In contrast, treatment of hUSM cells with inhibitors of p38 MAPK (SB203580) and p44/42 MAPK (PD98059) as well as PKC caused marked inhibition of PGF2α-stimulated COX-2 mRNA expression (Fig. 4B, lanes 2, 3, and 4). These results indicate that FP signaling is mediated via PKC, p38 MAPK, and p44/42 MAPK in a cell type-specific manner. FP Signaling Activates NF-κB—COX-2 is an agonist-inducible gene, and in the 5′-promoter region of this gene there are several transcriptional regulatory elements such as the cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREBP), AP2, SP1, GATA box, the nuclear factor of interleukin 6 (NF-IL6), and NF-κB (reviewed in 41Wu K.K. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 2005; 72: 89-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Among these elements, NF-IL6 and NF-κB act as positive regulatory elements for COX-2 gene expression in some cell lines (42Sontag E. Sontag J.M. Garcia A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5662-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The results of our present experiments suggest that COX-2 expression by FP signaling is mediated via PKC, p38 MAPK, and p44/42 MAPK in a cell type-specific manner. This prompted us to examine the activation of NF-κB by PGF2α, as it has been reported that PKC activates this nuclear factor, required for COX-2 expression, in NIH 3T3 cells (43Lin X. O'Mahony A. Mu Y. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2933-2940Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) as well as in other cell types (44D'Acquisto F. Iuvone T. Rombola L. Sautebin L. Di Rosa M. Carnuccio R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we examined the effects of the NF-κB inhibitors pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate and NF-κB SN-50 on PGF2α receptor-mediated induction of COX-2 mRNA expression. We found that PGF2α receptor-mediated COX-2 mRNA expression is inhibited by specific inhibitors of NF-κB (Fig. 4C), suggesting that PGF2α, via multiple kinase pathways, mediates NF-κB activation, which stimulates COX-2 gene expression. Uteroglobin Inhibits PGF2α-mediated Stimulation of COX-2 Gene Expression—UG is a low molecular weight anti-inflammatory protein secreted by the mucosal epithelia of virtually all mammalian organs (4Mukherjee A.B. Kundu G.C. Mantile-Selvaggi G. Yuan C.J. Mandal A.K. Chattopadhyay S. Zheng F. Pattabiraman N. Zhang Z. Cell. Mol.

It has been previously reported that there is an inverse relationship between the levels of PGF2α and uteroglobin in the human uterus (11Kikukawa T. Cowan B.D. Tejada R.I. Mukherjee A.B. J. Clin.

https://openalex.org/W1970971342,"IN his report on radiocarbon evidence of the age of the Irish Sea Glaciation in the Vale of Clwyd1, Rowlands expressed surprise that the radiocarbon dating of a mammoth carpal from deposits in Ffynnon Beuno cave containing “Aurignacian and Proto-Solutrean artefacts” was only 18,000±1,400−1,200 yr BP (Birm.−146); because, on the basis of comparison with the radiocarbon ages of such industries in France, the dating was expected to be 10,000 yr older. I believe that he will be reassured to hear that a fossil bone found in the same archaeological context at another Welsh site proved to be of almost identical antiquity. In 1968, the radiocarbon age of collagen extracted from the skeleton of Paviland Man, preserved in the University Museum, Oxford, was measured by Richard Burleigh in the British Museum Research Laboratory, and the result he obtained was: 18,460±340 yr BP (BM−374). In reporting this date of the “Red Lady of Paviland”2 I pointed out that the records of excavation at the site (Goat's Hole) showed that the human skeleton was associated with remains of mammoth and with Upper Palaeolithic artefacts including types identified by D. A. E. Garrod as Final Aurignacian and Proto-Solutrean. Some archaeologists were surprised that the Paviland dating was not higher, but I was sufficiently sure of its reliability to infer provisionally that in South-West Britain, Proto-Solutrean points and Aurignacoid artefacts were being made long after they had been superseded in France. In the forthcoming Catalogue of Fossil Hominids, Part 2 (Europe), I have therefore indicated the cultural horizon of Paviland Man as late Proto-Solutrean."

https://openalex.org/W1984935062,"WE have mapped the area containing the suspected galaxies Maffei 1 and 2 at a wavelength of 11 cm with half-power beam-width 5′.0 using the 300 foot transit telescope of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory at Green Bank, West Virginia, from January 28 to 31, 1971. A three-feed system with four receivers was used; the centre feed provided independent right-and left-hand circularly polarized beams at the same point in the sky, and two outrigger beams (2′ north and 2′ south of the centre beam) each received right hand circularly polarized radiation. Several transits with the telescope set at different declinations provided full mapping of an area between right ascensions 02 h 25 m and 02 h 43 m (1950.0) and between declinations + 59° 15′ and 59° 33′ (1950.0). The output of the radiometers was recorded every 4 s. With the parametric amplifiers used, the lower flux density limit was set by confusion rather than by system noise. We estimate that the lower flux density limit for detection of a point source is 0.06 f.u."
https://openalex.org/W2060047109,"THE conclusion that Maffei 1 and 2 are previously unrecognized nearby galaxies1 has aroused considerable interest; a positive detection of high frequency radio emission from Maffei 2 has been reported2,3 as also has a null result in the direction of Maffei 1 (ref. 4). Here we report observations at a much lower frequency; they are results obtained during a radio survey5 using the Cambridge 178 MHz pencil-beam synthesis instrument, with beam size 18′.5 × 23′.4."
