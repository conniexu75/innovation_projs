https://openalex.org/W2014019937,"University students were asked to draw the path a moving object would follow in several different situations. Over half of the students, including many who had taken physics courses, evidenced striking misconceptions about the motion of objects. In particular, many students believed that even in the absence of external forces, objects would move in curved paths."
https://openalex.org/W1987334472,"We have found that a rather simple thermal model of the Martian surface, in combination with current observations of the atmospheric composition, points strongly toward the conclusion that the polar caps of Mars consist almost entirely of frozen CO(2). This study was based upon the following principal assumptions. 1) Carbon dioxide is a major constituent of the Martian atmosphere. 2) The blanketing effect of the atmosphere is small, and due principally to the absorption band of CO(2) near 15 microns. 3) Lateral and convective heat transfer by the atmosphere is negligible. 4) The far-infrared emissivity of the Martian soil and of solid CO(2) are near unity. 5) The reflectivities of the soil and of solid CO(2) in the visible part of the spectrum are about 0.15 and 0.65, respectively. 6) Values for soil conductivity, density, and specific heat are those characteristic of powdered minerals at low gas pressure. 7) Water is a minor constituent of the Martian atmosphere, the maximum total amount in the atmosphere being 10 to 30 X 1O(-4) g cm(-2). In addition, several simplifications were made, which might have significant effects but should not alter our principal conclusions. Among these are the following. 1) Local blanketing or snowfall effects due to clouds or polar haze were ignored. 2) Dark and light areas were not differentiated in this study, although Sinton and Strong (6) have observed temperature differences between such areas. 3) The effects of local topography and microrelief were neglected. We believe that these must have quite significant effects at the higher latitudes, especially in connection with the evaporation of the remanent south polar cap. 4) Variation of reflectivity with angle of incidence of the sunlight was neglected. 5) Temperature dependence of soil conductivity and specific heat was ignored. 6) Effects of saturation of the soil by ice upon the thermal properties of the soil were neglected. Although in our main investigation we used certain specific values for the various relevant parameters, we also tested the effects of moderate changes in these quantities. Specifically, the soil conductivity was varied by a factor of 3, the albedo and emissivity of the surface were changed by 15 to 20 percent, and the effects of a gross amount of atmospheric blanketing were studied, as described. Only the last of these variations had any significant effect on the model, and other results of the atmospheric blanketing were in disagreement with other physical observations of the planet. Consequently, we find it difficult to avoid the conclusion that CO(2) must condense in large amounts relative to H(2)0. The main conclusions indicated by this study are the following. 1) The atmosphere and frost caps of Mars represent a single system with CO(2) as the only active phase. 2) The appearance and disappearance of the polar caps are adequately explained on the presumption that they are composed almost entirely of solid CO(2) with perhaps an occasional thin coating of water ice. 3) If the currently reported water-vapor observations are correct, water-ice permafrost probably exists under large regions of the planet at polar and temperate latitudes. 4) The geochemically anomalous enrichment of CO(2) relative to N(2) in the present Martian atmosphere may be a result of selective trapping of CO(2) in the solid phase at and under the surface. 5) If the basic evaporation and condensation mechanisms for CO(2) and H(2)O discussed in this article are correct, the possible migration of volatile organic compounds away from the warm temperate regions of the planet and their possible accumulation in the polar regions need to be carefully considered."
https://openalex.org/W2053728993,"Reproductive output from enlarged or reduced magpie broods showed that each female generally lays a clutch of optimal size. This size varies considerably between females. Approximately 85 percent of the within-years variation in clutch size was associated with differences between territories. Colonial bird species, lacking individual foraging territories, have a smaller clutch size variation than territorial species."
https://openalex.org/W2012902515,Experiments with developing ambrosia beetles and fungi indicate that beetles may feed on more than one species growing in their tunnels. The yeast-like ambrosia propagules in mycangia of beetles arise from conida and ascospores picked up by callow adults during their stay in tunnels.
https://openalex.org/W1996709874,"A new mineral, essentially a potassium-copper-iron sulfide, occurs in accessory amounts in the enstatite chondrites Kota Kota (a find) and St. Marks (a fall), and has been identified visually in the enstatite achondrite Pena Blanca Springs (a fall). The x-ray diffraction pattern, electron-microprobe analysis, and its appearance in polished sections all serve to identify it."
https://openalex.org/W1969603157,"Although males and females occur in similar frequency in the broods of most scolytid beetles, certain individuals of several species produce offspring highly aberrant in the ratio of sexes-all or mostly female. In some instances this condition reflects gynogenesis (parthenogenesis stimulated by mating); in others, a maternally transmitted factor."
https://openalex.org/W1995849087,"In the Ross Sea, Antarctica, distributions of calcareous Foraminifera and other calcareous microorganisms are dominantly controlled by a shallow calcium carbonate solution boundary that occurs at depths of about 500 meters. Possible causes of substantial undersaturation of Ross Sea bottom waters in calcium carbonate are very low temperatures and high salinities, which favor the solution of calcium carbonate and, possibly, high concentrations of carbon dioxide."

https://openalex.org/W2075591506,"Samples of natural fine-grained carbonate sediment from Florida Bay, Florida, undergo mole-for-mole cation exchange with aqueous solutions of MgCl(2) and CaCl(2) in the laboratory. The exchange reaction, which involves the surface of the grains of sediment, can be essentially described by a simple mass action-law equation. Enrichment of Mg++ beyond the amounts found within particle interiors should take place on the surface of CaCo(3) sediments immersed in sea water; it may be on both exchangeable and unexchangeable sites."
https://openalex.org/W1999844124,"The metastable kyaniteandalusite equilibrium in the Al(2)SiO(5) system has been reversed at 700 degrees , 750 degrees , and 800 degrees C at elevated water pressures, with a variety of natural and synthetic kyanites and andalusites as starting materials. Sillimanite, the stable form of Al(2)SiO(5) under these conditions, did not appear. The value of the transition pressure at 750 degrees C is 6.6 +/- 0.4 kilobars, several kilobars below pressures given by several convergent previous determinations. The Al(2)SiO(5) pressure-temperature triple point now indicated lies far from the points found by others. The revised aluminum silicate phase diagram indicates that many rocks crystallized at lower pressures than formerly thought possible."
https://openalex.org/W2067081587,"Oxygen isotope analyses were obtained for six Ivory Coast tektites, two samples of Bosumtwi Crater glass, and two new moldavites. The Ivory Coast tektites are 2 to 5 per mil richer in oxygen-18 than other known tektites, and they are similar in oxygen-18 content to the impactite glass from the nearby Bosumtwi Crater. These data are compatible with a terrestrial origin for the Ivory Coast tektites."
https://openalex.org/W2000606644,"Probable molluscan fossils have been discovered in the Reed Dolomite, White-Inyo Mountain area, Inyo County, California. They consist of small orthoconic shells with relatively large bilaterally symmetrical protoconch-like initial termini. Some individuals have a 'U-shaped"" (in transverse section) internal structure. The fossils occur at least 900 meters below the strata containing the earliest known olenellid trilobites and are therefore considered Precambrian."

This finding suggests the coexistence of two photoreceptive systems, ocellar and nonocellar."
