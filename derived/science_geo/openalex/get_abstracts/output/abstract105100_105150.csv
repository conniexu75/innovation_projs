https://openalex.org/W2036475318,"The neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF) binds a DNA sequence element, called the neuron-restrictive silencer element (NRSE), that represses neuronal gene transcription in nonneuronal cells. Consensus NRSEs have been identified in 18 neuron-specific genes. Complementary DNA clones encoding a functional fragment of NRSF were isolated and found to encode a novel protein containing eight noncanonical zinc fingers. Expression of NRSF mRNA was detected in most nonneuronal tissues at several developmental stages. In the nervous system, NRSF mRNA was detected in undifferentiated neuronal progenitors, but not in differentiated neurons. NRSF represents the first example of a vertebrate silencer protein that potentially regulates a large battery of cell type-specific genes, and therefore may function as a master negative regulator of neurogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2030624761,"Many members of the cytokine receptor superfamily initiate intracellular signaling by activating members of the Jak family of tyrosine kinases. Activation of the same Jaks by multiple cytokines raises the question of how these cytokines activate distinct intracellular signaling pathways. Selection of particular substrates—the transcriptional activator Stat3 and protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP1D—that characterize responses to the ciliary neurotrophic factor-interleukin-6 cytokine family depended not on which Jak was activated, but was instead determined by specific tyrosine-based motifs in the receptor components—gp130 and LIFR—shared by these cytokines. Further, these tyrosine-based motifs were modular, because addition of a Stat3-specifying motif to another cytokine receptor, that for erythropoietin, caused it to activate Stat3 in a ligand-dependent fashion."
https://openalex.org/W1971602395,"We report the identification of ligands for Tyro 3 (alternatively called Sky, rse, brt, or tif) and Axl (alternatively, Ark or UFO), members of a previously orphan family of receptor-like tyrosine kinases. These ligands correspond to protein S, a protease regulator that is a potent anticoagulant, and Gas6, a protein related to protein S but lacking any known function. Our results are reminiscent of recent findings that the procoagulant thrombin, a protease that drives clot formation by cleaving fibrinogen to form fibrin, also binds and activates intracellular signaling via a G protein-coupled cell surface receptor. Proteases and protease regulators that also activate specific cell surface receptors may serve to integrate coagulation with associated cellular responses required for tissue repair and growth, as well as to coordinate protease cascades and associated cellular responses in other systems, such as those involved in growth and remodeling of the nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1991736202,"Cell cycle checkpoints enhance genetic fidelity by causing arrest at specific stages of the cell cycle when previous events have not been completed. The tumor suppressor p53 has been implicated in a G1 checkpoint. To investigate whether p53 also participates in a mitotic checkpoint, cultured fibroblasts from p53-deficient mouse embryos were exposed to spindle inhibitors. The fibroblasts underwent multiple rounds of DNA synthesis without completing chromosome segregation, thus forming tetraploid and octaploid cells. Deficiency of p53 was also associated with the development of tetraploidy in vivo. These results suggest that murine p53 is a component of a spindle checkpoint that ensures the maintenance of diploidy."

https://openalex.org/W1999582446,"Two candidate genes for controlling thymocyte differentiation,T-cellfactor-1 (Tcf-1) and lymphoid enhancer-binding factor (Lef-1), encode closely related DNA-binding HMG-box proteins1,2. Their expression pattern is complex and largely overlapping during embryogenesis, yet restricted to lymphocytes postnatally3. Here we generate two independent germline mutations in Tcf-1 and find that thymocyte development in (otherwise normal) mutant mice is blocked at the transition from the CD8+, immature single-positive to the CD4+/CD8+ double-positive stage. In contrast to wild-type mice, most of the immature single-positive cells in the mutants are not in the cell cycle and the number of immunocompetent T cells in peripheral lymphoid organs is reduced. We conclude that Tcf-1 controls an essential step in thymocyte differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W2046447629,"In response to specific ligands, various STAT proteins (signal transducers and activators of transcription) are phosphorylated on tyrosine by Jak protein kinases and translocated to the nucleus to direct gene transcription. Selection of a STAT at the interferon gamma receptor as well as specific STAT dimer formation depended on the presence of particular SH2 groups (phosphotyrosine-binding domains), whereas the amino acid sequence surrounding the phosphorylated tyrosine on the STAT could vary. Thus, SH2 groups in STAT proteins may play crucial roles in specificity at the receptor kinase complex and in subsequent dimerization, whereas the kinases are relatively nonspecific."

The membrane bilayer, which surrounds the approximately 400 A diameter nucleocapsid, is penetrated by 80 spikes arranged in a T = 4 lattice. Each spike is a trimer of heterodimers consisting of glycoproteins E1 and E2. Cryoelectron microscopy and image reconstruction of Ross River virus showed that the T = 4 quaternary structure of the nucleocapsid consists of pentamer and hexamer clusters of the capsid protein, but not dimers, as have been observed in several crystallographic studies. The E1-E2 heterodimers form one-to-one associations with the nucleocapsid monomers across the lipid bilayer. Knowledge of the atomic structure of the capsid protein and our reconstruction allows us to identify capsid-protein residues that interact with the RNA, the glycoproteins, and adjacent capsid-proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2070318111,"Signal transduction molecules within the two-component family represent a conserved adaptation for the control of genes involved in pathogenesis. The Bordetella virulence control locus, bvgAS, activates and represses gene expression in response to environmental signals. While infection requires virulence gene activation, the role of gene repression during infection is not understood. By altering regulatory genes and reversing regulatory connections, we found evidence that the BvgAS-repressed genes responsible for motility are neither required nor expressed during colonization of the host. Expression of this Bvg- phase-specific phenotype in the Bvg+ growth phase resulted in a defect in tracheal colonization. Therefore, BvgAS promotes virulence both by activating genes required for colonization and by repressing genes that inhibit the development of infection."

We have discovered that low concentrations of DNCB completely inactivated human or bovine thioredoxin reductase, with a second order rate constant in excess of 200 M-1 s-1, which is almost 10,000-fold faster than alkylation of GSH. Total inactivation of 50 nM reduced thioredoxin reductase was obtained by 100 μM DNCB after 5 min of incubation at 20°C also in the presence of 1 mM GSH. The inhibition occurred with enzyme only in the presence of NADPH and persisted after removal of DNCB, suggesting alkylation of the active site nascent thiols as the mechanism of inactivation. Thioredoxin reductase modified by DNCB lacked reducing activity with oxidized thioredoxin, 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid), or sodium selenite. However, the DNCB-modified enzyme oxidized NADPH at a rate of 4.7 nmol/min/nmol of enzyme in the presence of atmospheric oxygen. This activity was not dependent on the presence of DNCB in solution and constituted a 34-fold increase of the inherent low NADPH oxidase activity of the native enzyme. DNCB is a specific inhibitor of mammalian thioredoxin reductase, which reacted 100-fold faster than glutathione reductase. The inactivation of the disulfide reducing activity of thioredoxin reductase and thioredoxin with a concomitant large increase of the NADPH oxidase activity producing reactive oxygen intermediates may mediate effects of DNCB on cells in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2014411191,"Swinholide A, isolated from the marine sponge Theonella swinhoei, is a 44-carbon ring dimeric dilactone macrolide with a 2-fold axis of symmetry. Recent studies have elucidated its unusual structure and shown that it has potent cytotoxic activity. We now report that swinholide A disrupts the actin cytoskeleton of cells grown in culture, sequesters actin dimers in vitro in both polymerizing and non-polymerizing buffers with a binding stoichiometry of one swinholide A molecule per actin dimer, and rapidly severs F-actin in vitro with high cooperativity. These unique properties are sufficient to explain the cytotoxicity of swinholide A. They also suggest that swinholide A might be a model for studies of the mechanism of action of F-actin severing proteins and be therapeutically useful in conditions where filamentous actin contributes to pathologically high viscosities."
https://openalex.org/W2026952659,"Cytochrome P-450TYR, which catalyzes the N-hydroxylation of L-tyrosine in the biosynthesis of the cyanogenic glucoside dhurrin in Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench has recently been isolated (Sibbesen, O., Koch, B., Halkier, B. A., and M⊘ller, B. L. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 92, 9740-9744). Reconstitution of the enzyme activity in lipid micelles containing cytochrome P-450TYR and NADPH-cytochrome P-450 oxidoreductase demonstrates that cytochrome P-450TYR catalyzes the conversion of L-tyrosine into p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde oxime. Earlier studies with microsomes have demonstrated that this conversion involves two N-hydroxylation reactions of which the first produces N-hydroxytyrosine. We propose that the product of the second N-hydroxylation reaction is N,N-dihydroxytyrosine. N,N-dihydroxytyrosine is dehydrated to 2-nitroso-3-(p-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid which decarboxylates to p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde oxime. The dehydration and decarboxylation reactions may proceed non-enzymatically. The E/Z ratio of the p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde oxime produced by reconstituted cytochrome P-450TYR is 69:31. Lipid micelles made from L-α-dilauroyl phosphatidylcholine are more than twice as effective in reconstituting cytochrome P-450TYR activity as compared to other lipids. The Km and turnover number of the enzyme is 0.14 mM and 200 min−1, respectively, when assayed in the presence of 15 mM NaCl whereas the values are 0.21 mM and 230 min−1 when assayed in the absence of added salt. The multifunctional nature cytochrome P-450TYR is confirmed by demonstrating that binding of L-tyrosine or N-hydroxytyrosine mutually excludes binding of the other substrate. These results explain why the conversion of tyrosine to p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde oxime as earlier reported (M⊘ller, B. L., and Conn, E. E.(1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 3049-3056) shows the phenomenon of catalytic facilitation (“channeling”). Cytochrome P-450TYR is the first isolated multifunctional heme-thiolate enzyme from plants.

N-Hydroxylases of the cytochrome P-450 type with high substrate specificity have not previously been reported. Seedlings of Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench contain large amounts of the cyanogenic glucoside dhurrin (β-D-glucopyranosyloxy-(S)-p-hydroxymandelonitrile) (1Akazawa T. Miljanich P. Conn E.E. Plant. Physiol. 1960; 35: 535-538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The key intermediates in the biosynthesis of dhurrin are N-hydroxytyrosine, p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde oxime, p-hydroxyphenylacetonitrile, and p-hydroxymandelonitrile(2McFarlane I.J. Lees E.M.

The pathway has been elucidated through biosynthetic studies using microsomes isolated from etiolated sorghum seedlings. The microsomal fraction catalyzes the in vitro conversion of L-tyrosine to p-hydroxymandelonitrile(2McFarlane I.J. Lees E.M. Conn E.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 21114-21121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two of these oxygen molecules are consumed in the conversion of tyrosine to p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde oxime(7Halkier B.A. M⊘ller B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21114-21121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The involvement of a monooxygenase of the cytochrome P-450 (heme thiolate) type in the conversion of tyrosine to N-hydroxytyrosine has previously been reported(8Halkier B.A. M⊘ller B.L. Plant. Physiol. 1991; 96: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Cytochrome P-450 monooxygenases consist of a NADPH-cytochrome P-450 oxidoreductase transferring reducing equivalents from NADPH to cytochrome P-450, which is the substrate binding and catalytic component of the monooxygenase(9White R.E. Coon M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 315-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). A heme-thiolate enzyme designated cytochrome P-450TYR has recently been isolated from microsomes prepared from etiolated seedlings of S. bicolor (L.) Moench(10Sibbesen O. Koch B.

DEAE-Sepharose fast flow, 2′,5′-ADP Sepharose 4B, Sephadex G-50, and Sephacryl S-100 were purchased from Pharmacia Biosystems, Uppsala, Sweden. Cibacron Blue Agarose and Reactive Red 120 Agarose were obtained from Sigma. Reduced Triton X-100 was from Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany, and RENEX 690 from J. Lorentzen A/S, Kvistgård, Denmark. N-Hydroxytyrosine was synthesized from L-tyrosine(12M⊘ller B.L. McFarlane I.J. Conn E.E. Acta. Chem. Scand. B. 1977; 31: 343-344Crossref Google Scholar). All other chemicals used were of reagent grade and purchased from Sigma. [U-14C]L-Tyrosine (450 mCi/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Ltd. [U-14C]-p-Hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde oxime was synthesized from [U-14C]L-tyrosine using the sorghum microsomal system prepared in the absence of dithiothreitol(4M⊘ller B.L. Conn E.E. J. Biol.

Quantitative determination of total cytochrome P-450 was carried out by difference spectroscopy using an extinction coefficient of 91 cm−1 mM−1 for the adduct between reduced cytochrome P-450 and carbon monoxide(14Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2379-2385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cytochrome P-450 substrate binding spectra were recorded on SLM-Aminco DW-2C and DW-2000 spectrophotometers according to Jefcoate(15Jefcoate C.R. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 27: 258-279Crossref Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Isolation of the cytochrome P-450TYR enzyme was performed essentially as described previously (10Sibbesen O. Koch B. Halkier B.A. M⊘ller B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 92: 9740-9744Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. After elution of the cytochrome P-450 from the Reactive Red Agarose 120 column, the eluate was gel filtrated through a Sephadex G-50 column, equilibrated in a buffer composed of 50 mM KPi, pH 7.9, 400 mM KCl, 0.1% CHAPS, 2 mM DTT. Eluted cytochrome P-450TYR was dialyzed for 2 h against 50 mM KPi, pH 7.9, 2 mM DTT, diluted 4-fold with dialysis buffer in an Amicon ultrafiltration cell fitted with an YM-30 membrane, and concentrated to 1.45 nmol/ml. The purification of the NADPH-cytochrome P-450 oxidoreductase was modified from Halkier and M⊘ller (8Halkier B.A. M⊘ller B.L. Plant. Physiol. 1991; 96: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) as follows. The oxidoreductase containing eluate from the 2′,5′-ADP Sepharose 4B column was extensively dialyzed toward a buffer composed of 10 mM KPi, pH 7.9, 1 mM DTT (dialysis buffer) until the concentration of KCl was less than 10 mM as monitored by conductivity measurements. The dialyzed sample was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column (5 × 50 mm), equilibrated in dialysis buffer fortified with 0.1% RENEX 690. The column was washed with 20 ml of dialysis buffer. The RENEX 690 was exchanged with CHAPS by washing the column with 20 ml of dialysis buffer fortified with 0.1% CHAPS. The NADPH-cytochrome P-450 oxidoreductase was eluted with a 0-1 M linear KCl gradient (2 × 5 ml) prepared in dialysis buffer fortified with 0.1% CHAPS. A major part of the oxidoreductase was reversibly inactivated during the purification procedure and was reactivated by addition of DTT to a final concentration of 8 mM and subsequent incubation for 30 min at room temperature. After incubation, the sample was diluted 4-fold with 50 mM KPi, pH 7.9, and concentrated in an Amicon ultrafiltration cell fitted with an YM-30 membrane to a final activity of 15 units/ml where 1 unit is defined as the amount of NADPH-cytochrome P-450 oxidoreductase which reduces 1 μmol of cytochrome c/min at 25°C in an assay mixture containing 50 mM KPi, pH 7.9, 0.05 mM cytochrome c, and 0.25 mM NADPH(16Benveniste I. Gabriac B. Durst F. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Lipid (10 mg/ml) was suspended in 50 mM KPi, pH 7.9, by sonication (1 min) using a Branson Sonifier 250 equipped with a 3-mm microtip, set at lowest intensity. The lipid suspension (10 μl) was mixed in a glass vial with NADPH-cytochrome P-450 oxidoreductase (0-0.15 unit), cytochrome P-450TYR (0-1.5 pmol) and adjusted to the desired final volume with 50 mM KPi, pH 7.9. [U-14C]L-tyrosine (10 μl, 0.5 μCi) or [U-14C]L-p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde oxime (10 μl, 0.5 μCi) were tested as substrates. NADPH (10 μl, 25 mg/ml) was added as electron donor. The reaction mixture was then sonicated for 1 min using a Branson 5200 sonication bath and incubated at 30°C. The reaction was stopped by transferring the glass vials onto ice. The radioactively labeled intermediates formed were extracted into 50 μl of ethyl acetate and quantified by TLC/autoradiography (8Halkier B.A. M⊘ller B.L. Plant. Physiol. 1991; 96: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) or by HPLC analysis/solid state scintillation counting (13Halkier B.A. Olsen C.E. M⊘ller B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264 (19487-19494)PubMed Google Scholar) as previously reported, except that the isocratic elution of the reverse phase column was performed using a mobile phase composed of 10% 2-propanol in 1 mM Tricine (pH 7.9). The heme-thiolate enzyme cytochrome P-450TYR was isolated as described previously(10Sibbesen O. Koch B. Halkier B.A. M⊘ller B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For use in reconstitution experiments, a gel filtration step was included to lower the CHAPS concentration followed by a dilution/concentration step to reduce the concentration of KCl from 400 mM to less than 10 mM. In the preparation of the NADPH-cytochrome P-450 oxidoreductase, a small ion-exchange column was introduced to exchange detergent from RENEX 690 to CHAPS and as a concentration step. The activity of the oxidoreductase was increased severalfold by a DTT treatment. In reconstitution experiments, the two membrane proteins were added to micelles of DLPC and subjected to gentle sonication to facilitate membrane fusion. [14C]L-tyrosine and [14C](E,Z)-p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde oxime were used as substrates. Two different analytical procedures were used. The HPLC method permits the separation of (E)- and (Z)-isomers of p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde oxime (Fig. 1) whereas in the TLC system the (E)- and (Z)-oxime isomerize rapidly and comigrate (Fig. 2). The TLC system is advantageous in being more sensitive compared to the HPLC procedure. When reconstituted into micelles of DLPC, cytochrome P-450TYR catalyzes the conversion of L-tyrosine all the way to p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde oxime (Figure 1:, Figure 2:). No conversion is seen in those reaction mixtures from which NADPH (Fig. 1) or NADPH-cytochrome P-450 oxidoreductase (Fig. 2) is excluded. The formation of p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde oxime (Fig. 1) demonstrates that cytochrome P-450TYR is a multifunctional heme-thiolate protein catalyzing reactions in addition to the initial N-hydroxylation of tyrosine. Using the TLC-autoradiography system, minute amounts of radiolabeled products comigrating with authentic p-hydroxybenzaldehyde and 1-nitro-2-(p-hydroxyphenyl) ethane are detected in the reaction mixtures.Figure 2:The catalytic properties of reconstituted cytochrome P-450TYR as analyzed by TLC chromatography using radiolabeled L-tyrosine or p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde oxime as substrates in the presence or absence of NADPH-cytochrome P-450 oxidoreductase. The chromatographic mobility of authentic standards is indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Different lipids were tested for their ability to reconstitute the cytochrome P-450TYR monooxygenase (Fig. 3). DLPC as used in the experiments described above was found to be more than twice as effective as any of the other lipids tested. Metabolism of L-tyrosine to p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde oxime was observed even in the absence of added lipid. Using DLPC for the reconstitution experiments, the optimum concentration of NaCl was found to be 15 mM (Fig. 4). In the presence of 15 mM NaCl in the reconstitution assay, a Km value of 0.14 mM and a Vmax value of 198 turnovers min−1 was obtained. The corresponding values in the absence of added NaCl were 0.21 mM and 228 turnovers min−1.Figure 4:Lineweaver-Burk plot showing the effect of NaCl on the kinetics of the cytochrome P-450TYR enzyme. The assay mixture (50 μl) contained 1.3 pmol of cytochrome P-450TYR, 0.15 unit of NADPH-cytochrome P-450 oxidoreductase, 50 μg of DLPC, 0-12 nmol of [U-14C]L-tyrosine (0.5 μCi in each experiment), 165 pmol of NADPH, ±750 nmol of NaCl, and 2.5 μmol of KPi, pH 7.9.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) p-Hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde oxime exists in two geometric forms, the E- and Z-isomers. The two isomers are relatively stable in the buffer system used with less than 5% isomerization taken place after 30 min of incubation(13Halkier B.A. Olsen C.E. M⊘ller B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264 (19487-19494)PubMed Google Scholar). An E/Z equilibrium ratio of 58:42 is reached upon prolonged standing(13Halkier B.A. Olsen C.E. M⊘ller B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264 (19487-19494)PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the ratio between the oxime isomers produced by cytochrome P-450TYR, the reconstituted monooxygenase was incubated with tyrosine as substrate for different time periods at the end of which the two isomers were quantified by HPLC analysis (Fig. 5). Both isomers were present at all time periods tested with a slight decrease in the E/Z ratio upon prolonged incubation. The percentage of Z-isomer of the total amount of oxime may be fitted to the exponential function % Z-oxime = 39.5 - 8.1• e-x/43, where x is the incubation time in minutes. Extrapolation of the data predicts that the E/Z ratio initially produced by the monooxygenase is 69:31 whereas the thermodynamic equilibrium ratio achieved under these experimental conditions is 60:40. Cytochrome P-450TYR has previously been reported to produce a Type I substrate binding spectrum in the presence of L-tyrosine(10Sibbesen O. Koch B. Halkier B.A. M⊘ller B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 92: 9740-9744Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 11Sibbesen O. Koch B.M. Rouzé P. M⊘ller B.L. Halkier B.A. Soc. Exp. Biol. Semin. Ser. 1994; 56: 227-241Google Scholar). In accordance with the ability of the isolated enzyme to catalyze the formation of p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde oxime upon reconstitution, its ability to bind N-hydroxytyrosine was tested (Fig. 6). A substrate binding spectrum identical to that obtained with L-tyrosine was obtained using N-hydroxytyrosine as substrate. When a saturating amount of N-hydroxytyrosine was added to isolated cytochrome P-450TYR already saturated with L-tyrosine or vice versa, the size of the substrate binding spectrum (ΔA390-420) remained unchanged. This demonstrates that the two substrates are competing for the same active site and confirms that cytochrome P-450TYR is a multifunctional enzyme. From the amounts of cytochrome P-450TYR used, the absorption coefficient (∊390-420) is calculated to 67 cm−1 mM−1. A complete transition from a low spin state to a high spin state would have resulted in an absorption coefficient of 138 cm−1 mM−1(15Jefcoate C.R. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 27: 258-279Crossref Scopus (394) Google Scholar). A priori, reconstituted cytochrome P-450TYR was expected to convert L-tyrosine into N-hydroxytyrosine, which has previously been shown to be the first intermediate in dhurrin biosynthesis(4M⊘ller B.L. Conn E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8575-8583PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the reconstitution experiments demonstrate that cytochrome P-450TYR is multifunctional catalyzing the conversion of tyrosine to p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde oxime, i.e. the same conversion as catalyzed by sorghum microsomes prepared in the absence of a reducing agent(2McFarlane I.J. Lees E.M. Conn E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4708-4713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17M⊘ller B.L. Conn E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3049-3056PubMed Google Scholar). As discussed below, the demonstrated multifunctionality of cytochrome P-450TYR gives rize to new interpretations of the results obtained in previous biosynthetic experiments concerning the identity and number of intermediates involved in the biosynthetic pathway and provides a biochemical mechanism by which the previously reported “channeling phenomenon” (17M⊘ller B.L. Conn E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3049-3056PubMed Google Scholar) can be explained. Initial elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway for cyanogenic glucosides involved in vivo administration of radioactively labeled amino acids to excised plant parts(18Koukol J. Miljanich P. Conn E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3223-3228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Farnden K.F. Rosen M.A. Conn E.E. Phytochemistry. 1973; 12: 2673-2677Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Efficient incorporation of radioactivity into cyanogenic glucosides was observed, but no intermediates were detectable. In vitro biosynthetic studies using microsomes demonstrated efficient conversion of amino acids to cyanohydrins with oximes as the only intermediate to accumulate in significant amounts(2McFarlane I.J. Lees E.M. Conn E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4708-4713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4M⊘ller B.L. Conn E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8575-8583PubMed Google Scholar). The additional compounds listed as intermediates in the pathway have been included based on in vitro trapping and feeding experiments demonstrating the ability of microsomes to catalyze the formation as well as further metabolism of the compounds (2McFarlane I.J. Lees E.M. Conn E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4708-4713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Shimada M. Conn E.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 180: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 4M⊘ller B.L. Conn E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8575-8583PubMed Google Scholar, 5Halkier B.A. Lykkesfeldt J. M⊘ller B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7). Stoichiometric studies showed that two molecules of oxygen are consumed in the conversion of tyrosine to p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde oxime(7Halkier B.A. M⊘ller B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21114-21121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Biosynthetic studies using [18O]oxygen and tyrosine and N-hydroxytyrosine as substrates have shown that the oxygen atom of the hydroxyamino group of N-hydroxytyrosine introduced by N-hydroxylation of L-tyrosine is specifically lost in the overall conversion of N-hydroxytyrosine to p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde oxime whereas the second oxygen atom incorporated by N-hydroxylation of N-hydroxytyrosine is quantitatively retained in the p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde oxime formed(5Halkier B.A. Lykkesfeldt J. M⊘ller B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The ability of the microsomes to discriminate between the two oxygen atoms introduced by the consecutive N-hydroxylation reactions precludes the possibility of free rotation around the Cα-N single bond as would occur if an intermediate produced by one enzyme would have to diffuse to a second enzyme before further metabolism takes place (Fig. 7). In light of these findings and considerations, a likely route for the formation of the oxime would be via N,N-dihydroxytyrosine (Fig. 7). This compound is extremely labile. It would dehydrate non-enzymatically to produce 2-nitroso-3-(p-hydroxyphenyl)propionate which would decarboxylate into p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde oxime. Cytochrome P-450TYR would then exert its catalytic function by catalyzing two N-hydroxylation reactions whereas the subsequent dehydration and decarboxylation reactions would not necessarily need to be enzyme catalyzed. Decarboxylation reactions have not previously been shown to involve cytochrome P-450 enzymes(20Fukuda H. Fujii T. Sukita E. Tazaki M. Nagahama S. Ogawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 516-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In previous studies using [α-2H]tyrosine as substrate for the microsomal system, the α-hydrogen atom of tyrosine was shown to be quantitatively retained in the p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde oxime produced(13Halkier B.A. Olsen C.E. M⊘ller B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264 (19487-19494)PubMed Google Scholar). The pathway outlined in Fig. 7 is in agreement with this observation. Earlier biosynthetic experiments showed that N-hydroxytyrosine produced by the microsomal system does not freely equilibrate with exogenously added N-hydroxytyrosine thus exhibiting the phenomenon of catalytic facilitation (channeling) with facilitation ratios between 25 and 160 dependent on the experimental conditions(17M⊘ller B.L. Conn E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3049-3056PubMed Google Scholar). The channeling and 18O2-labeling data can now be explained by the fact that both N-hydroxylation reactions are catalyzed by a multifunctional monooxygenase with a single catalytic site in which each of the two oxygen atoms have fixed positions mediated, e.g. by hydrogen bonds, metal chelation, or by a positively charged amino acid side chain. Thus, N-hydroxytyrosine is not a genuine free intermediate and possibly best considered a stable form of a “transition state.” The demonstrated ability of the microsomal system to produce and metabolize 1-nitro-2-(p-hydroxyphenyl)ethane (5Halkier B.A. Lykkesfeldt J. M⊘ller B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 7Halkier B.A. M⊘ller B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21114-21121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in combination with the consumption of two molecules of oxygen in the conversion of tyrosine to p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde oxime (7Halkier B.A. M⊘ller B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21114-21121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) previously led us to the conclusion that 2-nitro-3(p-hydroxyphenyl)propionate and aci-1-nitro-2-(p-hydroxyphenyl)ethane are intermediates in the biosynthetic pathway(5Halkier B.A. Lykkesfeldt J. M⊘ller B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 7Halkier B.A. M⊘ller B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21114-21121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A reduction step would then be required to convert the aci-nitro compound to the oxime. 1-Nitro-2-(p-hydroxyphenyl)ethane is also produced in low amounts when L-tyrosine is administered to the reconstituted cytochrome P-450TYR enzyme (Fig. 2). According to the biosynthetic pathway outlined in Fig. 7, the minute amounts of nitro compound produced constitutes a side product. The nitro compound would be formed if N,N-dihydroxytyrosine or its dehydration product 2-nitroso-3-(p-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid is subjected to an additional N-hydroxylation reaction before leaving the catalytic site. Alternatively, a small percentage of the N,N-dihydroxytyrosine may be prone to chemical oxidation instead of dehydration. Perturbation of cytochrome P-450TYR during preparation of microsomes or during enzyme isolation may generate low amounts of a conformation of the enzyme which favors nitro compound formation. It is to be noted that the glucoside of 1-nitro-2-(p-hydroxyphenyl)ethane accumulates in osmotically stressed cell suspension cultures of California poppy (Eschscholtzia californica Cham.)(21Hösel W. Berlin J. Hanzlik T.N. Conn E.E. Planta (Berl.). 1985; 166: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The intact plant produces the tyrosine-derived cyanogenic glucosides triglochinin and dhurrin, which do not accumulate in the cell suspension cultures. Whether the nitro compound accumulates in intact plants under osmotic stress remains unknown. These data demonstrate that the nitro compound is easily derived from the pathway. The observed ability of the microsomal system to catalyze a low rate of cyanide formation from 1-nitro-2-(p-hydroxyphenyl)ethane may reflect an unspecific enzymatic activity associated with the microsomal membranes. The reconstituted cytochrome P-450TYR enzyme produces (E)- and (Z)-p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde oxime in an E/Z ratio of 69:31. In biosynthetic studies using the microsomal enzyme system, the E/Z ratio of the produced oxime varied between 70:30 and 77:23(13Halkier B.A. Olsen C.E. M⊘ller B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264 (19487-19494)PubMed Google Scholar). The microsomal system initially produces the (E)-isomer. The (E)-isomer is then converted to the (Z)-isomer as an obligatory step in its further conversion to p-hydroxymandelonitrile(13Halkier B.A. Olsen C.E. M⊘ller B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264 (19487-19494)PubMed Google Scholar). The latter information makes us propose that the (Z)-isomer is the in vivo product of cytochrome P-450TYR although the (E)-isomer is the major isomer formed in the two in vitro systems. Possibly, the cytochrome P-450TYR used in the in vitro studies has been perturbed during the isolation and reconstitution procedure resulting in an enzyme with a differently contoured active site favoring unrestricted release of the (E)-isomer from the active site before its conversion to the (Z)-isomer. Such a perturbation may also explain why relatively large amounts of the nitro compound are produced using the reconstituted system compared with the microsomal system (Fig. 2). Further studies are needed to clarify this matter. Other reconstituted cytochrome P-450 enzymes have previously been documented to possess slightly altered catalytic properties(22Eberhart D.C. Parkinson A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 291: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 23Ikushiro S.-i. Kominami S. Takemori S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 984: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The activity of the reconstituted cytochrome P-450TYR is quantitatively dependent on the type of lipid used for micelle formation with DLPC providing more than twice as high rates as any of the other tested lipids. The majority of the previously reconstituted cytochrome P-450 enzymes reconstitute well with DLPC, but specific requirements for unsaturated phospholipids have also been observed (22Eberhart D.C. Parkinson A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 291: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the reconstitution of cytochrome P-450TYR, a mixture of all lipids tested is not as effective as DLPC alone indicating that other lipids may prevent proper interaction between cytochrome P-450TYR, NADPH-cytochrome P-450 oxidoreductase, and DLPC. In contrast, the adrenal cytochrome P-45011β is best reconstituted in the presence of a mixture of lipids(23Ikushiro S.-i. Kominami S. Takemori S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 984: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The kinetic properties of the reconstituted enzyme system are influenced by the NaCl concentration. Using L-tyrosine as substrate, the highest Vmax value is obtained in the absence of NaCl. On the other hand, the Km value is decreased from 0.21 to 0.14 mM upon addition of 15 mM NaCl indicating that a higher ionic strength facilitates substrate binding. A high ionic strength has previously been reported to facilitate electron transport from NADPH-cytochrome P-450 oxidoreductase to cytochrome P-450(16Benveniste I. Gabriac B. Durst F. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The Km value of 0.14 mM obtained after optimization of the reconstitution procedure should be compared with a Km value of 0.03 mM for the enzyme when assayed as a component of the microsomal system(4M⊘ller B.L. Conn E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8575-8583PubMed Google Scholar). Using the microsomal enzyme system and L-tyrosine as substrate, the Vmax value is 145 nmol of hydrogen cyanide/mg protein/h(17M⊘ller B.L. Conn E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3049-3056PubMed Google Scholar). In this system, the conversion of tyrosine to N-hydroxytyrosine is the rate-limiting step(5Halkier B.A. Lykkesfeldt J. M⊘ller B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The total content of cytochrome P-450 enzymes in the microsomal system as determined by the carbon monoxide difference spectrum is approximately 0.2 nmol of total cytochrome P-450/mg protein of which the cytochrome P-450TYR enzyme constitutes about 20%(10Sibbesen O. Koch B. Halkier B.A. M⊘ller B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 92: 9740-9744Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The calculated turnover number of the cytochrome P-450TYR enzyme when present as a component of the microsomal system is therefore approximately 60 min−1. The turnover number of reconstituted cytochrome P-450TYR is 228 min−1. The higher turnover number obtained with the reconstituted system may reflect that the ratio between NADPH-cytochrome P-450 oxidoreductase and cytochrome P-450TYR is much lower in the microsomal membrane compared to the reconstituted system. At the saturating substrate conditions used, NADPH-cytochrome P-450 oxidoreductase may limit the activity of the microsomal system. The corresponding turnover numbers for cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase are 0.055 min−1 for the reconstituted enzyme and 20 min−1 for the microsomal system(16Benveniste I. Gabriac B. Durst F. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The reported turnover numbers for reconstituted cytochrome P-450 enzymes vary considerably as further exemplified by reconstituted geraniol 10-hydroxylase isolated from Catharanthus roseus which has a turnover number of 1740 min−1(25Meijer A.H. Waal A.D. Verpoorte R. J. Chromatogr. 1993; 635: 237-249Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar) whereas reconstituted 3,9-dihydroxypterocarpan 6a-hydroxylase from Glycine max has a turnover number of 9 min−1(26Kochs G. Griesebach H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 273: 543-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Residual amounts of detergents, suboptimal choice of lipids, or inefficient interaction with NADPH-cytochrome P-450 oxidoreductase may serve to lower the measurable activity of reconstituted cytochrome P-450 monooxygenases. In conclusion, reconstitution of the cytochrome P-450TYR monooxygenase has demonstrated that cytochrome P-450TYR is multifunctional and catalyzes the conversion of L-tyrosine to p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde oxime. The pathway for biosynthesis of cyanogenic glucosides has previously been demonstrated to be channeled(17M⊘ller B.L. Conn E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3049-3056PubMed Google Scholar). The present data explain why the first half of the pathway is channeled."

https://openalex.org/W2042344054,"YB-1 is a member of a newly defined family of DNA- and RNA-binding proteins, the Y box factors. These proteins have been shown to affect gene expression at both the transcriptional and translational levels. Recently, we showed that YB-1 represses interferon-gamma-induced transcription of class II human major histocompatibility (MHC) genes (1). Studies in this report characterize the DNA binding properties of purified, recombinant YB-1 on the MHC class II DRA promoter. The generation of YB-1-specific antibodies further permitted an analysis of the DNA binding properties of endogenous YB-1. YB-1 specifically binds single-stranded templates of the DRA promoter with greater affinity than double-stranded templates. The single-stranded DNA binding sites of YB-1 were mapped to the X box, whereas the double-stranded binding sites were mapped to the Y box of the DRA promoter, by methylation interference analysis. Most significantly, YB-1 can induce or stabilize single-stranded regions in the X and Y elements of the DRA promoter, as revealed by mung bean nuclease analysis. In concert with the findings that YB-1 represses DRA transcription, this study of YB-1 binding properties suggests a model of repression in which YB-1 binding results in single-stranded regions within the promoter, thus preventing loading and/or function of other DRA-specific transactivating factors."

https://openalex.org/W2032262769,"Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to insulin resulting in association with and activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), thereby initiating some of the effects of insulin. We have recently shown that the insulin-like effects of growth hormone (GH) in adipocytes can be inhibited by the selective PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (Ridderstråle, M., and Tornqvist, H.(1994) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 203, 306-310), suggesting a similar role for PI 3-kinase in GH action. Here we show that IRS-1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated in a time- and dose-dependent manner in response to GH in primary rat adipocytes. This phosphorylation coincided with the extent of interaction between IRS-1 and the 85-kDa subunit of PI 3-kinase as evidenced by coimmunoprecipitation. Stimulation with 23 nM GH increased the PI 3-kinase activity associated with IRS-1 4-fold. Our data suggest that GH-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and the subsequent docking of PI 3-kinase are important postreceptor events in GH action. The mechanism for the phosphorylation of IRS-1 induced by GH is unknown, but involvement of JAK2, the only known GH receptor-associated tyrosine kinase, seems possible. Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to insulin resulting in association with and activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), thereby initiating some of the effects of insulin. We have recently shown that the insulin-like effects of growth hormone (GH) in adipocytes can be inhibited by the selective PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (Ridderstråle, M., and Tornqvist, H.(1994) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 203, 306-310), suggesting a similar role for PI 3-kinase in GH action. Here we show that IRS-1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated in a time- and dose-dependent manner in response to GH in primary rat adipocytes. This phosphorylation coincided with the extent of interaction between IRS-1 and the 85-kDa subunit of PI 3-kinase as evidenced by coimmunoprecipitation. Stimulation with 23 nM GH increased the PI 3-kinase activity associated with IRS-1 4-fold. Our data suggest that GH-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and the subsequent docking of PI 3-kinase are important postreceptor events in GH action. The mechanism for the phosphorylation of IRS-1 induced by GH is unknown, but involvement of JAK2, the only known GH receptor-associated tyrosine kinase, seems possible."

Deconvolutions of Wide Field Planetary Camera images indicate that the diameters of some fragments may have been as large as approximately 2 to 4 kilometers, assuming a geometric albedo of 4 percent, but significantly smaller values (that is, < 1 kilometer) cannot be ruled out. Most of the fragments (or nuclei) were embedded in circularly symmetric inner comae from July 1993 until late June 1994, implying that there was continuous, but weak, cometary activity. At least a few nuclei fragmented into separate, condensed objects well after the breakup of the SL9 parent body, which argues against the hypothesis that the SL9 fragments were swarms of debris with no dominant, central bodies. Spectroscopic observations taken on 14 July 1994 showed an outburst in magnesium ion emission that was followed closely by a threefold increase in continuum emission, which may have been caused by the electrostatic charging and subsequent explosion of dust as the comet passed from interplanetary space into the jovian magnetosphere. No OH emission was detected, but the derived upper limit on the H2O production rate of approximately 10(27) molecules per second does not necessarily imply that the object was water-poor."

However, the function(s) and the physiological differences of the subtypes are virtually unknown, in part because their differential coupling to different intracellular signaling mechanisms has not been characterized. Studies on the coupling of α2 adrenergic subtypes to adenylyl cyclase have shown that the rat α2 subtypes couple differently to adenylyl cyclase in certain cells (12Duzic E. Coupry I. Downing S. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24045-24052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and point to the possibility of further differences and increased plasticity in the coupling of subtypes to other effectors, including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). 1The abbreviations used are: MAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseCHOChinese hamster ovaryPMAphorbol myristate acetateEGFepidermal growth factorMEMminimum Eagle's mediumPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. mitogen-activated protein kinase Chinese hamster ovary phorbol myristate acetate epidermal growth factor minimum Eagle's medium polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. MAPK, also known as extracellular signal-regulated kinase, is a central component of an evolutionarily conserved kinase cascade, which integrates various extracellular signals converging to it(13Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5889-5892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). The cascade consists of three consecutive kinases, which relay and at the same time switch tyrosine phosphorylation signals, initiated from cell surface receptors, to serine/threonine phosphorylation of downstream serine/threonine protein kinases and other effectors that regulate mitogenesis, differentiation, and cellular metabolism. Thus, upon activation, p74raf-1, a serine/threonine kinase, acts as MAPK kinase kinase (MEKK) phosphorylating and activating MAPK kinase, a dual specificity protein kinase, that activates MAPK by dual phosphorylation at closely spaced residues Thr-183 and Tyr-185. A parallel p74raf-1-independent pathway, including MEKK (instead of p74raf-1) that can phosphorylate and activate MAPK kinase, is thought to operate in the transmission of signals initiated by certain G protein receptors(14Lange-Carter C.A. Pleiman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). Although in most systems different isoforms of MAPK, mainly p42 and p44 MAPK, are coactivated by a variety of stimuli, p42 MAPK is selectively activated independently of p44 MAPK in some cells(15Thompson H.L. Shiroo M. Saklatvala J. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The activated MAPK activates, by phosphorylating consensus sites, downstream effectors, including p90rsk and phospholipase A2 in the cytosol and transcription factors (c-jun, c-myc, c-fos, p62TCF) in the nucleus, where MAPK translocates when activated (16Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ligand activation of tyrosine kinase receptors (like the EGF receptor) stimulates MAPK via a pathway that involves accumulation of active GTP-bound p21ras. However, EGF activates also, in rat-1 and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, a Ca2+-dependent signaling pathway capable of phosphorylating p42 MAPK in a p21ras-independent way(17Burgering B.M.T. Vries-Smits A.M.M. Medema R.H. Weeren P. Tertoolen L.G. Bos J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7248-7256Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In a similar way some G protein-coupled receptors (like the endogenous thrombin receptor and the lysophosphatidic acid receptor in hamster lung fibroblasts and rat-1 cells) use activated p21ras in signaling to MAPK(18Van Corven E.J. Hordijk P.L. Medema R.H. Bos J.L. Moolenaar W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1257-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 19Howe L.R. Marshall C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20717-20720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yet other G protein-linked receptors (like the platelet-activating factor receptor in CHO cells) utilize a p21ras-independent pathway(20Honda Z. Takano T. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Ito K. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2307-2315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently it has been reported that the agonist-stimulated α2A adrenergic receptor activates MAP kinase activity in rat-1 fibroblasts through the activation of the p21ras pathway (21Alblas J. Van Corven E.J. Hordijk P.L. Milligan G. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22235-22238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is not known if the activation of MAPK by α2 adrenergic receptor stimulation is subtype-specific and, furthermore, if there are cell type-related differences in the signaling pathway employed by α2 subtypes. To characterize potential differences of the biochemical signals induced upon stimulation of cloned α2 adrenergic receptor subtypes, we have expressed the rat α2D, α2B, and α2X subtypes in CHO cells and studied their coupling to MAPK. We have found that in CHO cells α2 adrenergic receptor subtypes couple to this effector with different efficacy and that they transmit their signal to MAPK activation through a p21ras-independent pathway probably involving different protein kinase C.

Stable transfectants, CHO-2D, CHO-2B, CHO-2C, were selected and amplified using MEM α medium without ribo- and deoxyribonucleosides and amplified (CHO-2D and CHO-2C) using methotrexate as described(22Kaufman R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 537-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). CHO transfectants were grown in MEM α medium, without ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides, supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 IU/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). For the experiments, cells in 60-mm dishes were grown to near confluence, serum-starved for 24 h, and subsequently treated under various conditions. The assay for cAMP accumulation was carried out with cells in suspension as described previously (10Remaury A. Larrouy D. Daviaud D. Rouot B. Paris H. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) 3H. Paris, personal communication. , using a cAMP Kit (Amersham Corp.). Membranes were prepared from cultured transfectants and ligand binding assays were carried out, with appropriate amounts of membrane protein, basically as described(23Bresnahan M.R. Flordellis C.S.

The KD values of clones CHO-2D and CHO-2C were found to be 21.3 and 0.12 nM, respectively. The Bmax value of the CHO-2D was 9.8 ± 1.16 pmol/mg of protein, of the CHO-2B was 3.0 pmol/mg of protein, and of the CHO-2C was 4.8 ± 0.68 pmol/mg of protein. Confluent non-transfected and transfected CHO cells were incubated for 24 h in serum-free medium in 60-mm dishes. After stimulation with epinephrine, under different conditions, the cells were washed three times with 10 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped into 1 ml of 25 mM Hepes buffer pH 7.4 (containing 5 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaF, 100 μM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin), and homogenized by passing repeatedly through a 25-gauge needle. Insoluble material was eliminated by centrifugation of the lysate (100,000 × g, 20 min at 4°C). The supernatant, containing the MAPK activity, was aliquoted and stored at −80°C until use. 200 μg of supernatant proteins were precleared with protein A-Sepharose prior to immunoprecipitation with anti-MAPK antibody and protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at room temperature. The pellets were washed four times with lysis buffer and resuspended in kinase buffer (25 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mM MgCl2). An aliquot was incubated for MAPK activity determined as described elsewhere using 25 μg of a synthetic peptide (APRTPGGRR) corresponding to amino acids 95-98 of bovine myelin basic protein(24Seth A. Gonzales R.A. Gupta S. Raden D.L. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24796-24804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Baron-Delage S. Capeau J. Barbu V. Chastre E. Levy P. Gespach C. Cherqui G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18686-18693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Control incubations without synthetic peptide or without addition of cell lysate were also performed. For the mobility shift of MAPK, cell lysates were prepared as in the assay for the MAPK activity, and proteins were separated on 8-15% continuous gradient SDS-PAGE gel (26Tournier C. Gavaret J.M. Jacquemin C. Pierre M. Saunier B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar) followed by immunoblotting. The blots were incubated with the anti-MAPK antibody and then with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibody (1:600). Immunostained proteins were visualized using the ECL detection system. For the Western blotting analysis of G proteins, membrane proteins were prepared as described(27Levistre R. Masliah J. Béréziat G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 23: 295-303Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Membrane proteins (50 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE, electroblotted to nitrocellulose, and the filters were incubated with anti-G protein antibodies (diluted 1:1000) and processed as described above. Nearly confluent cells in 100-mm dishes were serum-starved for 8 h and then labeled with 125 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for an additional 16 h in serum-free phosphate-free medium. After agonist stimulation, incubations were terminated by washing three times 10 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were lysed in Triton X-114 buffer(25Baron-Delage S. Capeau J. Barbu V. Chastre E. Levy P. Gespach C. Cherqui G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18686-18693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane-bound p21ras was recovered by detergent phase splitting and immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibodies Y13-259 and Y13-238 coupled to rabbit anti-rat IgG/protein A-Sepharose complex. Guanine nucleotides bound to p21ras were eluted from the immunoprecipitate and analyzed by ascending thin layer chromatography on a polyethyleneimine cellulose plate as described elsewhere(28Burgering B.M.T. Medema R.H. Maassen J.A. Van De Wetering M.L. Van Der Eb A.J. McCormick F. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1103-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). After autoradiography the spots corresponding to GTP and GDP were scraped off the TLC plates, and the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation. In initial experiments we analyzed the CHO transfectants by ligand binding and determined that they express comparable levels of α2 adrenergic receptors in the range of 3-10 pmol/mg of membrane protein (see “Experimental Procedures”). This was necessary as receptor density such as in our clones (pmol/mg protein) has been found to permit consistent and comparable analysis of α2 adrenergic receptor-mediated responses(29Eason M.G. Kurose H. Holt B.D. Raymond J.R. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15795-15801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Measurement of the cAMP in agonist-stimulated CHO clones verified that the expressed subtypes are functionally linked, but in a different way, to adenylyl cyclase in CHO cells. Epinephrine activation of α2B and α2X subtypes inhibited forskolin-stimulated elevation of cAMP, whereas activation of α2D receptor produced a biphasic effect with a maximum inhibition at 100 nM, followed by stimulation at doses of 1-100 μM epinephrine (results not shown). Cells were stimulated with concentrations of epinephrine varying between 100 nM and 100 μM. Maximum activation of MAPK was observed at 10 μM epinephrine for clones CHO-2D and CHO-2C, whereas for clone CHO-2B the maximum effect was observed at 100 μM epinephrine. At a lower dose (10-7M) epinephrine was less effective. The dose of epinephrine (10 μM) that induces maximal activation of MAPK in CHO-2D has a very weak inhibitory effect on the accumulation of intracellular cAMP level. This indicates that there is probably no correlation between inhibition of cAMP and stimulation of MAPK in CHO cells (data not shown). Kinetic analysis of MAPK activation in response to epinephrine (10 μM) showed almost identical time courses in the three clones with a rapid, transient increase in the MAPK activity. MAPK increase was measurable at 1 min after stimulation, reached a maximum at 5 min, and decreased rapidly thereafter, with continued epinephrine treatment, so that at 30 min MAP kinase activity was to nearly prestimulated levels. The time course of the activation was paralleled by an identical time course in the phosphorylation and subsequent mobility shift of p42 MAP kinase (results not shown). This uniform time course of activation of MAPK by the α2 subtypes is similar to what has been found with other G-protein-coupled receptors (α-thrombin, lysophosphatidic acid, platelet-activating factor receptors) (18Van Corven E.J. Hordijk P.L. Medema R.H. Bos J.L. Moolenaar W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1257-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 19Howe L.R. Marshall C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20717-20720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Honda Z. Takano T. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Ito K. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2307-2315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a variety of cells, as well as receptor tyrosine kinases in certain cell types (like EGF receptor in PC12 cells)(30Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Yamashita T. Hoshi M. Kawakami M. Sakai H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, epinephrine applied at 10 μM for 5 min activates MAPK in all three clones but with substantially different efficiencies. The order of activation is CHO-2B ∼ CHO-2D ≫ CHO-2C. No activation was observed in non-transfected CHO cells. The activation of MAPK by epinephrine is 80% of the effect of serum on MAPK activity in clone CHO-2D, 75% in clone CHO-2B, and 25% in CHO-2C. Yohimbine (10 μM) caused partial inhibition of activation of MAP kinase, whereas pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml) for 4 h inhibited the epinephrine-induced activation completely in CHO-2C and almost completely in CHO-2D and CHO-2B cells (85 and 67% inhibition, respectively), without affecting basal MAPK activity (not shown). This proves that the activating effect of epinephrine through α2 adrenergic receptor subtypes is mediated by pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi proteins. Pertussis toxin had only a moderate inhibitory effect on the serum activation of MAP kinase, an expected result of many of the growth factors present in the serum signal to MAP kinase through tyrosine kinase receptors. The changes in enzymatic activity of MAP kinase were paralleled by modifications of MAP kinase phosphorylation. Fig. 2 shows that epinephrine induced a different degree of shift in the mobility of p42 MAP kinase in the different clones: minor shift in CHO-2C, moderate in CHO-2D, and pronounced in CHO-2B cells. In this last clone specifically, retarded migration of an additional electrophoretic zone can be observed, most likely representing the 44-kDa (p44) form of MAP kinase. The slower migrating forms of p42/p44 on anti-MAPK immunoblots represent the threonine and tyrosine phosphorylated and activated form of MAPK(31Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Incubation of the same filter with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody showed that the shifted electrophoretic bands are tyrosine-phosphorylated (not shown). Consistent with the enzymatic activity of MAPK, the retardation in the electrophoretic mobility of p42/p44 MAPK is prevented partially by yohimbine and completely by pertussis toxin treatment. The substantial quantitative differences in the MAPK activation observed among the CHO clones in this study cannot be attributed to differences in receptor number, since the three CHO clones express comparable levels of receptor protein. They also express similar levels of Gi protein, as shown by immunoblot analysis of Gαi subunits (Fig. 3). In this context it should be noted that, in the course of these experiments, while preparing the cells by serum deprivation for the MAP kinase assays, we have observed a reproducible induction of the levels of Gi proteins. The immunoblots of Fig. 3 show clearly the induction of both Gi2 and Gi3 proteins (the Gi isoforms expressed in CHO cells) (32Dell'Acqua M.L. Carroll R.C. Peralta E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5676-5685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) when parental or transfected CHO cells were serum-depleted for 24 h. The functional significance of these changes in conditioning the signal transduction apparatus is currently under investigation. We report these preliminary findings here in order to show that the Gi levels change under serum deprivation in the same direction (increase) in all clones studied. We reason therefore that the found differences in MAPK activation rather reflect different coupling efficiency of different subtypes to the same signaling pathway to MAPK or reflect the employment by the subtypes of different signaling pathways regulating MAPK activation such as p21ras activation, protein kinase C activation, or Ca2+ mobilization(17Burgering B.M.T. Vries-Smits A.M.M. Medema R.H. Weeren P. Tertoolen L.G. Bos J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7248-7256Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Agonist stimulation of α2A subtype has been reported to activate rapidly p21ras in rat-1 fibroblasts(21Alblas J. Van Corven E.J. Hordijk P.L. Milligan G. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22235-22238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to test if the same happens in CHO cells we determined the activation of p21ras of clones CHO-2D and CHO-2B, in which effective activation of MAPK was found, by measuring the GTP-bound form of p21ras after epinephrine stimulation. It can be seen in the thin layer chromatogram of Fig. 4 that epinephrine at 10 μM, a concentration that induced maximal activation of MAPK, did not cause any detectable increase of GTP-bound p21ras in these cells 5 min after stimulation. CHO cells transfected with insulin receptor were used as a positive control of p21ras activation(33Barbu V. Caron M. Delage S. Mailleau C. Wicek D. Capeau J. Cherqui G. Exp. Clin. Endocrinol. 1993; 101: 84-86Google Scholar); 1 μM insulin produced a 2-fold increase of GTP bound to p21ras (Fig. 4) 5 min after stimulation. This result shows that in CHO cells the α2 adrenergic receptors activate MAPK through a p21ras-independent pathway. p21ras-independent activation of MAPK is not without precedent. It has been described among others for platelet-activating factor receptor in CHO cells(20Honda Z. Takano T. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Ito K. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2307-2315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the finding of stimulation of MAPK activity by all α2 adrenergic receptor subtypes without activation of p21ras is to our knowledge the first concerning the α2 receptor. It is in contrast to the p21ras-mediated activation of MAPK by the human α2A and the m2 muscarinic receptor subtype in rat-1 cells (21Alblas J. Van Corven E.J. Hordijk P.L. Milligan G. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22235-22238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Winitz S. Russel M. Qian N.X. Gardner A. Dwyer L. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19196-19199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by the fluoroaluminate AlF4 in PC 12 cells(35Robbins D.J. Cheng M. Zhen E. Vanderbilt C.A. Feig L.A. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6924-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and it shows that activated p21ras, like other signaling effectors, can be employed by the same receptors in an alternative way depending on the cell type(36Vallar L. Muca C. Magni M. Albert P. Bunzow J. Meldolesi J. Civelli O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10320-10326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively the inability to detect p21ras activation by epinephrine in our study may mean that a very slight, undetectable increase in the GTP-p21ras is sufficient for the activation of MAP kinase by α2 adrenergic subtypes in CHO cells. We examined the possibility of protein kinase C as a signaling pathway in the activation of p42 MAPK by epinephrine. Fig. 5 demonstrates that stimulation of protein kinase C by PMA activated MAPK in the three clones. Furthermore, combined application of epinephrine (10 μM) and PMA had a potent cooperative, but not additive, effect in clones CHO-2D and CHO-2B but not in CHO-2C. These results suggest that protein kinase C is probably involved in a different fashion in the signaling by the three α2 adrenergic receptor subtypes. In conclusion, our results show that α2 adrenergic receptor subtypes expressed in CHO cells utilize differently biochemical pathways signaling to MAPK in a p21ras-independent way.

The data showed three outbursts. The first flash lasted about 40 seconds and was followed 1 minute after its peak by a second flash that lasted about 3 minutes. A third, longer lasting flare began 6 minutes after the first flash and lasted for 10 minutes. At its maximum brightness, the flare outshone Jupiter. The two short flashes are probably associated with the initial meteor trail and the subsequent fireball, respectively. The bright flare occurred when the impact site rotated into view. These data show that the explosion ejected material at least 1300 kilometers above the visible cloud tops. The luminosity of the impact site during the long bright flare was probably maintained by the release of gravitational potential energy, as this material fell back onto the lower atmosphere."
