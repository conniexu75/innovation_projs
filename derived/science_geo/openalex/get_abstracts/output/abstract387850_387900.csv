https://openalex.org/W2075063459,"THE human brain contains hundreds of different types of nerve cells of varying structures. Each type is found in a circumscribed area, and forms, either on its own or together with a few other types of nerve cells, a grey centre or ‘griseum’. As a result of the aggregation of the representatives of one cell type in a circumscribed region, the task of following the life-history of that particular cell type under normal or pathogenic conditions becomes possible, or at least easier."

https://openalex.org/W2025025303,"THERE is good reason for believing that gastric hydrochloric acid is neutralized by ammonia formed most probably by urease from circulating urea. This enzyme is present in the mucosa. This mechanism was first noted by Luck1 and by Luck and Seth2 in the dog and cat, and Linderstrøm-Lang and Ohlsen3 noted also that in the dog the urease was most potent in the superficial rather than the deep mucosa. Furthermore, Linderstrøm-Lang and Ohlsen3 held that urease was not present in all animals; for example, they held there was none present in the pig. From personal work we have shown that this ferment exists in at least man, dog, cat, rabbit, pig and rat. The amount in the first three species of animal appears to be much greater than in the latter three. Rigoni4 had shown its presence in man, and, like Linderstrøm-Lang and Ohlsen, had speculated on its possible significance."

https://openalex.org/W2057682505,"IN trying out several emulsifying agents having at a fairly neutral pH a stabilizing effect upon emulsions of olive oil, monobutyrine, ethylbutyrate, methylbutyrate and ethylpropionate, the following observations were made. Gummi arabicum activates on one hand the cleavage of olive oil to a very remarkable degree, but exerts no influence upon the cleavage of monobutyrine. It causes on the other hand a very sharp inhibition of the saponification of such esters where glycerol is substituted by lower alcohols. This inhibitory effect amounted in several instances (depending upon the source of the lypolytic enzymes employed) to 100 per cent, and in no case was finally less than 65 per cent. In the tests with olive oil, the activating effect of gummi arabicum proved to be dependent upon the stability of the emulsion, which on its part depends principally upon the procedure of preparation and to a much less degree upon the absolute amount of gummi arabicum added. Thus, in several instances, where no stable emulsions were obtained, the activating effect was either nil or very small."

https://openalex.org/W2005658250,"THE procedure of the demonstration of living organisms in the vaginal discharges of cattle represents the most satisfactory method at present available for the positive diagnosis of infection with Trichomonas fÅtus. Considerable difficulties are involved, however, not the least of which arises through the capricious appearance and disappearance of the organisms from these discharges; and it was in an endeavour to find an explanation that some investigations of the properties of the discharges were made and finally led to the demonstration of trichomonas agglutinins in the mucus secretions of the vagina."

https://openalex.org/W2094561182,"USING the micro-stimulation apparatus referred to in a recent communication, further experiments have now been performed with the object of elucidating the process of visual fixation. It was found that there was a small scotoma (blind spot) for red rays, which was situated in my own fovea, about seven cone units away from the fixation point for green rays. Since it is unlikely that this spot alters its position on the retina, successive determinations of the position of the fixation point for green rays, relative to this spot, enables any changes in the former to be detected. The fixation point for green rays (5,200 A.) was found in this way to be very constant in position (see Table 1)."

https://openalex.org/W1986689916,"As a preliminary to genetic studies in which one of us will be concerned in collaboration with Prof. K. Hrubý, the pigments of the flower petals of Gladiolus gandavensis (large-flowered florist's gladioli) have been re-examined. The different varieties contain more or less of an anthoxanthin which appears to be a glycoside of apigenin or a simple derivative; this functions as a strong co-pigment. An acid aqueous extract of the yellow ‘Hofmann's Glory’ added to synthetic peonin or malvin makes the red solutions much bluer, and they then simulate the appropriate flower extracts. The petals do not contain a carotenoid soluble in benzene or ethyl acetate."
https://openalex.org/W2055172406,"IN mid-November, 1945, two cultures were made on Dox's agar of Botrytis conidia from conidiophores produced on onion leaves. These had been sent by Mr. D. E. Green of the Royal Horticultural Society, Wisley, as typical specimens showing symptoms of attack by Botrytis squamosa Walker. Apothecia were observed in one culture on January 7, 1946, and more were produced during the period January 7-February 15. The other culture also produced a few apothecia during the period January 20-February 10."

https://openalex.org/W2046676305,"A method is presented whereby certain constituents of serum or other liquids may be concentrated by the swelling of undissolved gelatin. Applications to chemistry, to the study of antibodies, and to the serology of syphilis have been indicated. Colloids, such as proteins and cholesterol, were found to be concentrated as expected. Chlorides also complied with expectation, fully entering the swelling gelatin. An anomaly was found with calcium in blood serum; all of it behaved like nondiffusible material, in contrast with known facts pertaining to dialysis and ultrafiltration."
https://openalex.org/W2050089631,"IN the presence of an alkali, chloral undergoes a fission at the C—C bond with the formation of chloroform and an alkali formate. This communication gives a preliminary report on the investigation of this reaction in the presence of heavy hydrogen water. 1 c.c. of a solution containing 0.002 mole of chloral hydrate is mixed with 1 c.c. of a solution containing 0.002 mole of sodium hydroxide. The reaction is complete within one minute at 30° C. and, after this period, the reaction mixture is frozen. The chloroform and the water are removed by pumping off the vapours of these substances from the frozen mixture. When the sodium formate which remains in the vessel is perfectly dry, it is decomposed by the action of heat. Sodium oxalate and hydrogen are formed and the latter is then converted to water. The excess density of this water is determined by the micro-pyknometer method of Gilfillan and Polanyi1. The results of experiments in the presence of normal water and of heavy hydrogen water respectively, are listed below. The excess density of the original heavy water, allowing for the exchange between the hydrogen of the hydroxyl groups of the reagents and that of the water was 2650 p.p.m."

SEABORG has again added to the general knowledge of the trans-uranic elements by his introductory remarks to a meeting of the American Chemical Society and his lecture there on ""The Impect of Nuclear Chemistry""1. According to the rather tentative definition with which Seaborg prefaces his introductory address, ""nuclear chemistry should be denned as embracing the chemical aspects of the study and application of nuclear reactions, the investigation of radio-chemistry, and the application of radio-active isotopes and nuclear methods to the study of chemical problems in general""."

https://openalex.org/W4236485974,"THE recently formed Industrial Spectroscopic Group of the Institute of Physics held its first conference at the Wellcome Research Institution, London, during July 5 and 6. Mr. F. Twyman, chairman of the Group, presided at the conference, which was attended by representatives from Belgium, France and Holland in addition to a large number of British members. Under the general heading “Recent Developments in Industrial Emission and Absorption Spectroscopy”, the five principal contributions dealt with modern equipment and techniques for both emission spectrography and infra-red absorption spectroscopy; a full report of the papers will appear in due course in the Journal of Scientific Instruments. Lack of time prevented any detailed consideration of ultra-violet absorption spectroscopy; this subject, however, has received very recent attention at another general discussion on spectroscopic analysis (see Nature, June 29, p. 883)."

https://openalex.org/W4250690597,"WITHIN the limits of its survey, the report of the Royal Society on the needs of research in fundamental science after the War indicates that there is little the matter with the existing structure of research in Great Britain: with increased endowment the provision of new research institutes in such fields as oceanography, microbiology, meteorology, geophysics, ecology, and with an adequate supply of scientific workers, it should be capable of expansion, without substantial modification, to meet the increased needs of to-day. There is, however, one important direction in which the findings of the report are closely parallel with those of the report which, under the title “Science—the Endless Frontier”, Dr. Vannevar Bush presented last year to the President of the United States. One of the specific questions on which Dr. Bush was asked for recommendations was what could be done to make known to the world, as soon as possible, the contributions to scientific knowledge which had been made during the war effort. Dr. Bush's review of the structure of research in the United States gives emphasis to this question of the full and free interchange of publication and its value as a stimulus to scientific research, and it is clearly recognized by him, as by the committee under Dr. Irwin Stewart which reported to Dr. Bush on this subject, that this is a matter requiring international collaboration as well as national action."
