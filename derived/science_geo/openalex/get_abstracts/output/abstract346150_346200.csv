The brain should thus be able to efficiently infer the causes underlying our sensory events. Here we use multisensory cue combination to study causal inference in perception. We formulate an ideal-observer model that infers whether two sensory cues originate from the same location and that also estimates their location(s). This model accurately predicts the nonlinear integration of cues by human subjects in two auditory-visual localization tasks. The results show that indeed humans can efficiently infer the causal structure as well as the location of causes. By combining insights from the study of causal inference with the ideal-observer approach to sensory cue combination, we show that the capacity to infer causal structure is not limited to conscious, high-level cognition; it is also performed continually and effortlessly in perception."

Multipotent bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to inhibit the function of various immune cells by undefined paracrine mediators in vitro. Yet, the therapeutic potential of MSC-derived molecules has not been tested in immunological conditions in vivo. Herein, we report that the administration of MSC-derived molecules in two clinically relevant forms-intravenous bolus of conditioned medium (MSC-CM) or extracorporeal perfusion with a bioreactor containing MSCs (MSC-EB)-can provide a significant survival benefit in rats undergoing FHF. We observed a cell mass-dependent reduction in mortality that was abolished at high cell numbers indicating a therapeutic window. Histopathological analysis of liver tissue after MSC-CM treatment showed dramatic reduction of panlobular leukocytic infiltrates, hepatocellular death and bile duct duplication. Furthermore, we demonstrate using computed tomography of adoptively transferred leukocytes that MSC-CM functionally diverts immune cells from the injured organ indicating that altered leukocyte migration by MSC-CM therapy may account for the absence of immune cells in liver tissue. Preliminary analysis of the MSC secretome using a protein array screen revealed a large fraction of chemotactic cytokines, or chemokines. When MSC-CM was fractionated based on heparin binding affinity, a known ligand for all chemokines, only the heparin-bound eluent reversed FHF indicating that the active components of MSC-CM reside in this fraction. These data provide the first experimental evidence of the medicinal use of MSC-derived molecules in the treatment of an inflammatory condition and support the role of chemokines and altered leukocyte migration as a novel therapeutic modality for FHF."
https://openalex.org/W2161521198,"Bacteria of the genus Deinococcus are extremely resistant to ionizing radiation (IR), ultraviolet light (UV) and desiccation. The mesophile Deinococcus radiodurans was the first member of this group whose genome was completely sequenced. Analysis of the genome sequence of D. radiodurans, however, failed to identify unique DNA repair systems. To further delineate the genes underlying the resistance phenotypes, we report the whole-genome sequence of a second Deinococcus species, the thermophile Deinococcus geothermalis, which at its optimal growth temperature is as resistant to IR, UV and desiccation as D. radiodurans, and a comparative analysis of the two Deinococcus genomes. Many D. radiodurans genes previously implicated in resistance, but for which no sensitive phenotype was observed upon disruption, are absent in D. geothermalis. In contrast, most D. radiodurans genes whose mutants displayed a radiation-sensitive phenotype in D. radiodurans are conserved in D. geothermalis. Supporting the existence of a Deinococcus radiation response regulon, a common palindromic DNA motif was identified in a conserved set of genes associated with resistance, and a dedicated transcriptional regulator was predicted. We present the case that these two species evolved essentially the same diverse set of gene families, and that the extreme stress-resistance phenotypes of the Deinococcus lineage emerged progressively by amassing cell-cleaning systems from different sources, but not by acquisition of novel DNA repair systems. Our reconstruction of the genomic evolution of the Deinococcus-Thermus phylum indicates that the corresponding set of enzymes proliferated mainly in the common ancestor of Deinococcus. Results of the comparative analysis weaken the arguments for a role of higher-order chromosome alignment structures in resistance; more clearly define and substantially revise downward the number of uncharacterized genes that might participate in DNA repair and contribute to resistance; and strengthen the case for a role in survival of systems involved in manganese and iron homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2135289622,"The magnetic compass of migratory birds has been suggested to be light-dependent. Retinal cryptochrome-expressing neurons and a forebrain region, ""Cluster N"", show high neuronal activity when night-migratory songbirds perform magnetic compass orientation. By combining neuronal tracing with behavioral experiments leading to sensory-driven gene expression of the neuronal activity marker ZENK during magnetic compass orientation, we demonstrate a functional neuronal connection between the retinal neurons and Cluster N via the visual thalamus. Thus, the two areas of the central nervous system being most active during magnetic compass orientation are part of an ascending visual processing stream, the thalamofugal pathway. Furthermore, Cluster N seems to be a specialized part of the visual wulst. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that migratory birds use their visual system to perceive the reference compass direction of the geomagnetic field and that migratory birds ""see"" the reference compass direction provided by the geomagnetic field."
https://openalex.org/W2028971906,"Altered homeostasis of metal ions is suspected to play a critical role in neurodegeneration. However, the lack of analytical technique with sufficient spatial resolution prevents the investigation of metals distribution in neurons. An original experimental setup was developed to perform chemical element imaging with a 90 nm spatial resolution using synchrotron-based X-ray fluorescence. This unique spatial resolution, combined to a high brightness, enables chemical element imaging in subcellular compartments. We investigated the distribution of iron in dopamine producing neurons because iron-dopamine compounds are suspected to be formed but have yet never been observed in cells. The study shows that iron accumulates into dopamine neurovesicles. In addition, the inhibition of dopamine synthesis results in a decreased vesicular storage of iron. These results indicate a new physiological role for dopamine in iron buffering within normal dopamine producing cells. This system could be at fault in Parkinson's disease which is characterized by an increased level of iron in the substantia nigra pars compacta and an impaired storage of dopamine due to the disruption of vesicular trafficking. The re-distribution of highly reactive dopamine-iron complexes outside neurovesicles would result in an enhanced death of dopaminergic neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2094803867,"Bacillus spores are notoriously resistant to unfavorable conditions such as UV radiation, gamma-radiation, H2O2, desiccation, chemical disinfection, or starvation. Bacillus pumilus SAFR-032 survives standard decontamination procedures of the Jet Propulsion Lab spacecraft assembly facility, and both spores and vegetative cells of this strain exhibit elevated resistance to UV radiation and H2O2 compared to other Bacillus species.The genome of B. pumilus SAFR-032 was sequenced and annotated. Lists of genes relevant to DNA repair and the oxidative stress response were generated and compared to B. subtilis and B. licheniformis. Differences in conservation of genes, gene order, and protein sequences are highlighted because they potentially explain the extreme resistance phenotype of B. pumilus. The B. pumilus genome includes genes not found in B. subtilis or B. licheniformis and conserved genes with sequence divergence, but paradoxically lacks several genes that function in UV or H2O2 resistance in other Bacillus species.This study identifies several candidate genes for further research into UV and H2O2 resistance. These findings will help explain the resistance of B. pumilus and are applicable to understanding sterilization survival strategies of microbes."
https://openalex.org/W2007714938,"Background Investigation of dynamics and regulation of the TGF-β signaling pathway is central to the understanding of complex cellular processes such as growth, apoptosis, and differentiation. In this study, we aim at using systems biology approach to provide dynamic analysis on this pathway. Methodology/Principal Findings We proposed a constraint-based modeling method to build a comprehensive mathematical model for the Smad dependent TGF-β signaling pathway by fitting the experimental data and incorporating the qualitative constraints from the experimental analysis. The performance of the model generated by constraint-based modeling method is significantly improved compared to the model obtained by only fitting the quantitative data. The model agrees well with the experimental analysis of TGF-β pathway, such as the time course of nuclear phosphorylated Smad, the subcellular location of Smad and signal response of Smad phosphorylation to different doses of TGF-β. Conclusions/Significance The simulation results indicate that the signal response to TGF-β is regulated by the balance between clathrin dependent endocytosis and non-clathrin mediated endocytosis. This model is useful to be built upon as new precise experimental data are emerging. The constraint-based modeling method can also be applied to quantitative modeling of other signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2144369985,"Background Alcohol dependence and associated cognitive impairments apparently result from neuroadaptations to chronic alcohol consumption involving changes in expression of multiple genes. Here we investigated whether transcription factors of Nuclear Factor-kappaB (NF-κB) family, controlling neuronal plasticity and neurodegeneration, are involved in these adaptations in human chronic alcoholics. Methods and Findings Analysis of DNA-binding of NF-κB (p65/p50 heterodimer) and the p50 homodimer as well as NF-κB proteins and mRNAs was performed in postmortem human brain samples from 15 chronic alcoholics and 15 control subjects. The prefrontal cortex involved in alcohol dependence and cognition was analyzed and the motor cortex was studied for comparison. The p50 homodimer was identified as dominant κB binding factor in analyzed tissues. NF-κB and p50 homodimer DNA-binding was downregulated, levels of p65 (RELA) mRNA were attenuated, and the stoichiometry of p65/p50 proteins and respective mRNAs was altered in the prefrontal cortex of alcoholics. Comparison of a number of p50 homodimer/NF-κB target DNA sites, κB elements in 479 genes, down- or upregulated in alcoholics demonstrated that genes with κB elements were generally upregulated in alcoholics. No significant differences between alcoholics and controls were observed in the motor cortex. Conclusions We suggest that cycles of alcohol intoxication/withdrawal, which may initially activate NF-κB, when repeated over years downregulate RELA expression and NF-κB and p50 homodimer DNA-binding. Downregulation of the dominant p50 homodimer, a potent inhibitor of gene transcription apparently resulted in derepression of κB regulated genes. Alterations in expression of p50 homodimer/NF-κB regulated genes may contribute to neuroplastic adaptation underlying alcoholism."
https://openalex.org/W2046690406,"Background We examined a model of multiple mediating pathways of income poverty, material hardship, parenting factors, and child health status to understand how material hardship and parental factors mediate the effects of poverty on child health. We hypothesized that: (a) poverty will be directly associated with material hardship, parental depression, and health status, and indirectly with parenting behaviors through its effects on parental depression and material hardship; (b) material hardship will be associated with parental depression, parenting behaviors, and health status; and (c) parental depression will be correlated with parenting behaviors, and that both parental depression and parenting behaviors will predict child health. Methods and Results We used data from the 2002 National Survey of American Families for a sample of 9,645 6-to-11 year-olds to examine a 4-step structural equation model. The baseline model included covariates and income poverty. In the hardship model, food insufficiency and medical need were added to the baseline model. The parental model included parental depression and parenting behavior and baseline model. In the full model, all the constructs were included. First, income poverty had a direct effect on health status, and an indirect effect through its association with material hardship, parental depressive affect, and parenting behaviors. Medical need and food insufficiency had negative effects on child health, and indirect effects on health through their association with parental depression and parenting behaviors. Finally, parental depression and parenting behaviors were associated with child health, and part of the effect of parental depression on health was explained by its association with parenting behaviors. Conclusions Poverty has an independent effect on health, however, its effects are partially explained by material hardship, parental depression and parental behaviors. To improve children's health would require a multi-pronged approach involving income transfers, health insurance coverage, food and nutrition assistance, and parenting interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2133877095,"Background The Wnt signaling system plays key roles in development, regulation of stem cell self-renewal and differentiation, cell polarity, morphogenesis and cancer. Given the multifaceted roles of Wnt signaling in these processes, its transcriptional effects on the stromal cells that make up the scaffold and infrastructure of epithelial tissues are of great interest. Methods and Results To begin to investigate these effects, we used DNA microarrays to identify transcriptional targets of the Wnt pathway in human lung fibroblasts. Cells were treated with active Wnt3a protein in culture, and RNA was harvested at 4 hours and 24 hours. Nuclear accumulation of ß-Catenin, as shown by immunofluorescence, and induction of AXIN2 demonstrate that fibroblasts are programmed to respond to extracellular Wnt signals. In addition to several known Wnt targets, we found many new Wnt induced genes, including many transcripts encoding regulatory proteins. Transcription factors with important developmental roles, including HOX genes, dominated the early transcriptional response. Furthermore, we found differential expression of several genes that play direct roles in the Wnt signaling pathway, as well as genes involved in other cell signaling pathways including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. The gene most highly induced by Wnt3a was GREMLIN2, which encodes a secreted BMP antagonist. Conclusions Elevated expression of GREMLIN2 suggests a new role for Wnt signals in the maintenance of stem cell niches, whereby Wnt signals induce nearby fibroblasts to produce a BMP antagonist, inhibiting differentiation and promoting expansion of stem cells in their microenvironment. We suggest that Wnt-induced changes in the gene expression program of local stromal cells may play an important role in the establishment of specialized niches hospitable to the self-renewal of normal or malignant epithelial stem cells in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2144920054,"Understanding the mechanisms that maintain diversity is important for managing ecosystems for species persistence. Here we used a long-term data set to understand mechanisms of coexistence at the local and regional scales in the Cape Floristic Region, a global hotspot of plant diversity. We used a dataset comprising 81 monitoring sites, sampled in 1966 and again in 1996, and containing 422 species for which growth form, regeneration mode, dispersal distance and abundances at both the local (site) and meta-community scales are known. We found that species presence and abundance were stable at the meta-community scale over the 30 year period but highly unstable at the local scale, and were not influenced by species' biological attributes. Moreover, rare species were no more likely to go extinct at the local scale than common species, and that alpha diversity in local communities was strongly influenced by habitat. We conclude that stochastic environmental fluctuations associated with recurrent fire buffer populations from extinction, thereby ensuring stable coexistence at the meta-community scale by creating a “neutral-like” pattern maintained by niche-differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2023704692,"Fragile X syndrome (FX), the most common heritable cause of mental retardation and autism, is a developmental disorder characterized by physical, cognitive, and behavioral deficits. FX results from a trinucleotide expansion mutation in the fmr1 gene that reduces levels of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Although research efforts have focused on FMRP's impact on mGluR signaling, how the loss of FMRP leads to the individual symptoms of FX is not known. Previous studies on human FX blood cells revealed alterations in the cyclic adenosine 3′, 5′-monophosphate (cAMP) cascade. We tested the hypothesis that cAMP signaling is altered in the FX nervous system using three different model systems. Induced levels of cAMP in platelets and in brains of fmr1 knockout mice are substantially reduced. Cyclic AMP induction is also significantly reduced in human FX neural cells. Furthermore, cAMP production is decreased in the heads of FX Drosophila and this defect can be rescued by reintroduction of the dfmr gene. Our results indicate that a robust defect in cAMP production in FX is conserved across species and suggest that cAMP metabolism may serve as a useful biomarker in the human disease population. Reduced cAMP induction has implications for the underlying causes of FX and autism spectrum disorders. Pharmacological agents known to modulate the cAMP cascade may be therapeutic in FX patients and can be tested in these models, thus supplementing current efforts centered on mGluR signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2038306186,"Bacterial and viral upper respiratory infections (URI) produce highly variable clinical symptoms that cannot be used to identify the etiologic agent. Proper treatment, however, depends on correct identification of the pathogen involved as antibiotics provide little or no benefit with viral infections. Here we describe a rapid and sensitive genotyping assay and microarray for URI identification using standard amplification and hybridization techniques, with electrochemical detection (ECD) on a semiconductor-based oligonucleotide microarray. The assay was developed to detect four bacterial pathogens (Bordetella pertussis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae) and 9 viral pathogens (adenovirus 4, coronavirus OC43, 229E and HK, influenza A and B, parainfluinza types 1, 2, and 3 and respiratory syncytial virus. This new platform forms the basis for a fully automated diagnostics system that is very flexible and can be customized to suit different or additional pathogens. Multiple probes on a flexible platform allow one to test probes empirically and then select highly reactive probes for further iterative evaluation. Because ECD uses an enzymatic reaction to create electrical signals that can be read directly from the array, there is no need for image analysis or for expensive and delicate optical scanning equipment. We show assay sensitivity and specificity that are excellent for a multiplexed format."
https://openalex.org/W2036309095,"The expression of interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a key event in T helper (Th) lymphocyte activation, controlling both, the expansion and differentiation of effector Th cells as well as the activation of regulatory T cells. We demonstrate that the strength of TCR stimulation is translated into the frequency of memory Th cells expressing IL-2 but not into the amount of IL-2 per cell. This molecular switch decision for IL-2 expression per cell is located downstream of the cytosolic Ca2+ level. Here we show that in a single activated Th cell, NFATc2 activation is digital but NF-κB activation is graded after graded T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. Subsequently, NFATc2 translocates into the nucleus in an all-or-none fashion per cell, transforming the strength of TCR-stimulation into the number of nuclei positive for NFATc2 and IL-2 transcription. Thus, the described NFATc2 switch regulates the number of Th cells actively participating in an immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2029706268,"The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is an elaborate protein machine that mediates macromolecular transport across the nuclear envelope in all eukaryotes. The NPC is formed by nucleoporins that assemble in multiple copies around an 8-fold symmetry axis. Homology modeling suggests that most architectural nucleoporins are composed of simple β-propeller and α-helical repeat domains. Here we present the crystal structure of Nic96, the Nup93 homolog in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, one of the major components of the NPC. This is the first structure of an α-helical nucleoporin domain. The protein folds into an elongated, mostly α-helical structure. Characteristically, non-canonical architectural features define the Nic96 structure. Sequence conservation among Nup93 homologs across all eukaryotes strongly suggests that the distinct topology is evolutionarily well maintained.

Nuclear compartmentalization requires permanent shuttling of macromolecules across the NE. Nucleocytoplasmic transport is exclusively mediated by nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), large proteinaceous channels spanning the NE (1Tran E.J. Wente S.R.

The NPC is composed of about 30 proteins, termed nucleoporins (Nups), each of which is present in multiple copies (4Cronshaw J.M. Krutchinsky A.N. Zhang W. Chait B.T. Matunis M.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 915-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 5Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Suprapto A. Hjertaas K. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 635-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy studies of yeast and frog NPCs show that despite differences in overall size, the basic architecture of the NPC is well conserved between species. In all cases, a channel is formed in the center of the 8-fold rotational symmetrical NPC. At about 6 nm resolution, the best current reconstruction of the NPC is its structure from the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum obtained with cryoelectron tomography (6Beck M. Lucic V. Förster F. Baumeister W. Medalia O. Nature. 2007; 449: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Three basic elements stand out as follows: the nuclear basket, the central core, and the cytoplasmic fibrils. About one-third of all nucleoporins contain FG repeat domains, long filamentous peptides bearing characteristic phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeats. These FG repeats adopt no defined structure but extend into the central channel of the NPC and form a barrier, limiting the diffusion of macromolecules larger than 20–40 kDa, which can only traverse the NPC efficiently if facilitated by adaptor proteins called karyopherins. Karyopherins can interact with both transport substrates and nucleoporins (7Pemberton L.F. Paschal B.M. Traffic. 2005; 6: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). A concentration gradient of the small G protein Ran enforces the directionality of karyopherin-mediated transport. Ran is highly enriched in its GTP-bound form in the nucleus, and GTP hydrolysis by Ran is directly coupled to the import/export cycle (8Fried H. Kutay U. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1659-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The karyopherin-mediated protein transport cycle is mechanistically well understood in large part because of structures of intermediates provided by x-ray crystallographic studies (9Cook A. Bono F. Jinek M. Conti E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 647-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 10Suel K.E. Cansizoglu A.E. Chook Y.M. Methods (Duluth). 2006; 39: 342-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Other facilitated transport processes such as the nuclear export of RNA and ribosomal subunits are less understood, but their regulation appears to be at least partially different from that governing protein traffic across the NE (1Tran E.J. Wente S.R. Cell. 2006; 125: 1041-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 11Köhler A. Hurt E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 761-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). To understand nucleocytoplasmic transport in detail, structural information of the NPC itself is required. The complexity and size of the NPC make this a significant endeavor. However, recent studies of the assembly and the organization of the NPC components indicate that the apparent structural complexity of the NPC is reduced by multiple layers of modularity (12Schwartz T.U. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). First, there is the limited set of nucleoporins that assemble in multiples of eight (4Cronshaw J.M. Krutchinsky A.N. Zhang W. Chait B.T. Matunis M.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 915-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 5Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Suprapto A. Hjertaas K. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 635-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar), reflecting the rotational symmetry apparent from electron micrographs. Second, among the ∼30 nucleoporins, only a subset is stably attached to the NPC to form the structural scaffold, whereas others associate transiently (13Rabut G. Lenart P. Ellenberg J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Third, recent crystal structures and computational analysis have indicated that most architectural nucleoporins consist of simple domain structures, predominantly β-propellers, α-helical solenoid domains, or combinations of the two (10Suel K.E. Cansizoglu A.E. Chook Y.M. Methods (Duluth). 2006; 39: 342-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 14Berke I.C. Boehmer T. Blobel G. Schwartz T.U. J.

The nine proteins of the Nup107–160 subcomplex are symmetrically localized on the cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic face of the NPC and form two outer rings that sandwich a second scaffold module called the inner ring. This module is built from a subcomplex that contains at least four proteins, Nup205, Nup188, Nup53, and Nup93/Nic96 (18Grandi P. Dang T. Pane N. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Forbes D. Hurt E. Mol. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1141-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Nup93/Nic96 directly interacts with the heterotrimeric Nup62 subcomplex, which resides at the center of the NPC and consists of FG repeat containing nucleoporins, held together by coiled-coil domains (21Bailer S.M. Balduf C. Hurt E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7944-7955Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 22Grandi P. Doye V. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3061-3071Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Nup93/Nic96 is essential, as shown in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Aspergillus nidulans, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Danio rerio (22Grandi P. Doye V. Hurt E.C.

Cell. 2006; 17: 4946-4961Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Quantification of Nup93/Nic96 in rat liver cells and S. cerevisiae suggests it is the most abundant nucleoporin with 32–48 or more copies per NPC (4Cronshaw J.M. Krutchinsky A.N. Zhang W. Chait B.T.

Nature. 2003; 425: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (2952) Google Scholar). It alone contributes more than 10% of the mass of the NPC. In nuclear reconstitution experiments using Nup93-immunodepleted Xenopus laevis egg extracts, nuclear pore assembly is defective, and the size-exclusion barrier for transport substrates is lowered (18Grandi P. Dang T. Pane N. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Forbes D. Hurt E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2017-2038Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 24Galy V. Mattaj I.W. Askjaer P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 5104-5115Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Thus, Nup93/Nic96 acts in the assembly and homeostasis of the NPC. In addition, it has been linked to chromatin organization and gene regulation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation with Nic96 suggests it, among other nucleoporins, recruits certain actively transcribed genes to the NPC (27Casolari J.M. Brown C.R. Komili S. West J. Hieronymus H. Silver P.A. Cell. 2004; 117: 427-439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) in a process referred to as “gene gating” (28Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8527-8529Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Nup93/Nic96 is composed of two predicted structural domains, an N-terminal coiled-coil domain, of about 150 residues, and a C-terminal helical domain, of about 600 residues. Direct interaction between the coiled-coil domain and members of the Nup62 subcomplex was shown in yeast (29Grandi P. Schlaich N. Tekotte H. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 76-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region is suggested to interact with the Nup205 complex (20Zabel U. Doye V. Tekotte H. Wepf R. Grandi P. Hurt E.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1141-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, Nup93/Nic96 tethers the Nup62 and the Nup205 subcomplexes. To understand Nup93/Nic96 on a molecular level and to be able to dissect its various functions, we have solved the crystal structure of the yeast homolog of Nup93, Nic96, lacking the N-terminal coiled-coil region. This structure reveals that Nic96 folds into an elongated, mostly helical domain of distinct topology. Structure-guided primary sequence alignment of Nup93 homologs spanning the phylogenetic spectrum of eukaryotes indicates that its architecture and specific surface features are well conserved. Fluorescence microscopy shows that the helical domain is recruited to the NPC independently of the N-terminal coiled coils. The structure will now allow targeted experiments to address the function of Nup93/Nic96. Protein Expression—The coding region for the noncoiled-coil portion of Nic96 (residues 186–839) was amplified from genomic DNA of S. cerevisiae and cloned into the pET28a bacterial expression vector (Novagen) to yield an N-terminally His-tagged protein. The resulting vector was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) RIL strains (Stratagene). Cells were grown in LB medium containing 0.5% (w/v) glucose, 25 μg/ml kanamycin, and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 30 °C to an A600 of 0.8 and then the temperature was shifted to 17 °C, and protein expression was induced by addition of 0.2 mm isopropyl β-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were grown 10–14 h postinduction. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer (30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and lysed using a French press. The crude lysate was supplemented with 0.2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min. Selenomethionine derivatives were prepared according to published protocols (30Doublie S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar), except that the bacterial culture was grown at 23 °C. Protein purification was carried out as for the native protein. Protein Purification—The clarified lysate was incubated with nickel-charged HisSelect resin (Sigma). After binding, the resin was washed three times with 10 bed volumes of lysis buffer, loaded onto a disposable column (Pierce), and washed with 5 bed volumes of washing buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 400 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The protein was eluted in 5 bed volumes of elution buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 150 mm imidazole, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The eluate was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol. The N-terminal His tag was removed by proteolytic cleavage. The protein was further purified twice via gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) and concentrated to 10 mg/ml using a centrifugal concentrator. Protein Crystallization—The protein was crystallized at 16 °C with the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Initial crystals grew in aggregates in drops mixed from 1.5 μl of protein solution with 1.5 μl of reservoir solution containing 0.1 m BisTris propane, pH 8.0–8.2, 17–20% (w/v) PEG 3350, and 0.2 m KSCN. Single crystals were obtained after adding 1 mm cetyltrimethylammonium bromide to the drop. Crystals were quick-soaked in reservoir solutions containing 10–15% glycerol and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Selenomethionine-labeled protein crystallized in the same conditions. Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement—A SAD data set to 2.6 Å of a SeMet derivative and a native data set to 2.5 Å were collected at 100 K at beamline 24-IDC at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne, IL). Data were processed with the HKL2000 package (31Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). The statistics of the data collection are listed in Table 1. Twenty two selenium sites (out of 24 possible for two molecules per asymmetric unit) were found with the program SHELXD and were used for phasing with SHARP (32La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1796) Google Scholar). The resulting solvent-flattened electron density map was used to build the initial SeMet model with Coot (33Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22534) Google Scholar). Molecular replacement with the SeMet model was used to find the native structure. The structure was first refined against the native data using CNS (34Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar). Final refinement, including TLS refinement, was performed with the PHENIX suite (35Adams P.D. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Hung L.W. Ioerger T.R. McCoy A.J. Moriarty N.W. Read R.J. Sacchettini J.C. Sauter N.K. Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3548) Google Scholar). The refined structure of Nic96 consists of residues 200–835. Residues 361–365, 375–404, 445–454, 516–532, and 748–752 were not defined in the 2Fo - Fc electron density map and are absent from the final model. The quality of the final model was validated using Molprobity (36Lovell S.C. Davis I.W. Arendall III, W.B. de Bakker P.I. Word J.M. Prisant M.G. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Proteins. 2003; 50: 437-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (3748) Google Scholar). 96.2% of the residues are in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran, and 3.8% are in the additionally allowed regions.

Multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) were edited with JalView (37Clamp M. Cuff J. Searle S.M. Barton G.J. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2004; 20: 426-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar). Homology modeling was performed using Modeler (38Fiser A. Sali A. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 461-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). The sequences of homologs to be modeled were aligned with the Nic96 structure omitting poorly ordered loop regions. Electrostatic surface potentials were calculated with APBS (39Baker N.A. Sept D. Joseph S. Holst M.J. McCammon J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10037-10041Crossref PubMed Scopus (5699) Google Scholar) and displayed with PyMOL (DeLano Scientific, Palo Alto, CA). GFP-tagged Nic96 Constructs and Fluorescence Microscopy—Wild-type S. cerevisiae W303 diploid strain was used in this study. General yeast manipulations were conducted by standard methods with transformation by the lithium acetate method. Cells were grown at 30 °C in YPD medium. The GFP/KanMX4 cassette was amplified from the pYM27 plasmid as described (40Janke C. Magiera M.M. Rathfelder N. Taxis C. Reber S. Maekawa H. Moreno-Borchart A. Doenges G. Schwob E. Schiebel E. Knop M. Yeast. 2004; 21: 947-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (1328) Google Scholar) and was fused in-frame either with full-length Nic96 to generate Nic96-GFP or with residues 1–185 to construct Nic96ΔCter-GFP. To generate Nic96ΔNter-GFP, residues 200–835 of Nic96 were amplified in fusion with the GFP/KanMX4 cassette with recombination sites flanking the full-length gene. After transformation, cells were selected on YPD-G418 (G418/geneticin: Invitrogen) medium (200 mg G418/l). Correct chromosomal integration was confirmed by PCR and fluorescence microscopy. The cells, grown to log phase at 30 °C, were immobilized on coverslips with a solution of 1% poly-l-lysine. Localization of Nic96-GFP, Nic96ΔNter-GFP, and Nic96ΔCter-GFP was visualized by direct fluorescence microscopy, and images were recorded using an Axio Imager Z.1 AX10 (Zeiss) with a ×60 objective. Overall Structure—Nic96 (residues 185–839) from S. cerevisiae was recombinantly expressed in E. coli, purified to homogeneity, and crystallized. The structure was solved by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD), using selenomethionine-labeled protein. The experimental SAD electron density map was of excellent quality, allowing for building of the majority of the model. The final structure of the native protein was refined to 2.5 Å resolution. Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. Selenomethionine and native crystals were both monoclinic, but with different cell parameters. Both crystal forms have two molecules in the asymmetric unit with the same relative orientation to one another. The contacts between the two molecules in the asymmetric unit and between crystallographically related molecules are not extensive and do not suggest dimerization in vivo. Accordingly, size-exclusion chromatography indicates that Nic96 is a monomer in solution (data not shown). The structure is shown in Fig. 1. Overall, it has an elongated cuboid shape with dimensions of ∼140 × 45 × 45 Å. The protein folds into one continuous domain composed of 30 α-helices and one short β-sheet of two strands. Starting at the N terminus, located in the middle of the domain, the first 70 residues form three helices that propagate in a zig-zag pattern to one end of the molecule. The next 140 residues fold into an irregular ensemble of 8 helices (α4–α11), shaping one end of the domain. Helix α9 is poorly ordered suggesting that it is only loosely attached to the body of the domain. It could be partially modeled (Fig. 1) from the electron density map obtained from the selenomethionine data set, but it is absent in the final model of the native protein. The following 7 helices (α12–α18, covering about 140 residues) form one of two tetratricopeptide (TPR)-like segments of the domain (see below) and trace back toward the C-terminal end of the molecule, pairing with helices α1–α3. The following helix α19 is interrupted by a short β-hairpin of 12 residues. Within helices α20 to α30, 4 antiparallel helical pairs form the second TPR-like subdomain that makes up the C-terminal end of the domain. Several loops (connecting helices α7–8, α11–12, α15–16, and α26–27) are not modeled completely because they are poorly resolved in the electron density map, presumably because of their inherent flexibility. Both crystal forms we obtained contain two Nic96 molecules in the asymmetric unit, thus we have a total of four protein copies in different packing environments. A superposition of the respective models shows no significant positional differences except for side chains directly involved in crystal contacts (r.m.s.d. comparing equivalent C-α positions below 0.6 Å for all mutual superpositions). The overall fold is identical in all copies suggesting that the domain is rather rigid. Comparison with α-Helical Solenoid Proteins—Solenoid proteins are defined by their buildup from repeating structural units, arranged in such a way that the polypeptide chain forms a continuous superhelix (41Kobe B. Kajava A.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 509-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The superhelix can be described by three basic parameters; overall curvature and handedness, as well as twist between the consecutive repeating elements. Furthermore, N and C termini of solenoids are typically localized at opposite ends of the domain. α-Helical solenoids form the most populated subclass, where the repeating unit is made up from two or three helices, prominent examples being HEAT, Armadillo, and TPR repeat proteins. Karyopherins, the mediators of transport through the NPC, are composed of Armadillo or HEAT repeats that form regular elongated or spiral-shaped superhelices (10Suel K.E. Cansizoglu A.E. Chook Y.M. Methods (Duluth). 2006; 39: 342-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Structure predictions based on threading algorithms suggest that many architectural nucleoporins, including Nic96, form α-helical repeat structures similar to karyopherins (17Devos D. Dokudovskaya S. Williams R. Alber F. Eswar N. Chait B.T. Rout M.P. Sali A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2172-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Our structure does not confirm such predictions. Nic96 does not share the hallmark features of solenoid proteins. N and C termini are not at opposite ends, and an overall repeat pattern is not apparent. Without a repeat pattern, handedness and twist are irrelevant parameters. Furthermore, the molecule has no overall curvature; it adopts a straight cuboid shape not characteristic of α-helical solenoids. We performed three-dimensional structure comparison using the Dali and VAST programs. Nic96 has substructures that resemble known proteins, but as a whole, its domain architecture is novel. The substructures expand over two separate regions (Fig. 2). Both substructure modules M1 and M2 have homology to TPR-like domains. The first module M1, comprising helices α12–α18, is most similar to a region within the HAT-C domain (half a TPR) of CstF-77, one of the multiple factors required for polyadenylation and 3′-end cleavage of mammalian pre-mRNAs (r.m.s.d. of 3.1 Å over 100 C-α atoms; orange in Fig. 2). SMG7, a protein involved in non-sense-mediated mRNA decay is similarly close (data not shown). The second module M2 includes an interrupted portion of the C-terminal region of helices α20–α30 and resembles the prokaryotic TPR protein NlpI (r.m.s.d. 3.7 Å over 112 C-α atoms; yellow in Fig. 2) and similarly the Bro1 domain. The similarity with the closest matches found in three-dimensional alignments of both substructures appears to be mainly architectural, not functional, as the sequence conservation between Nic96 and its closest structural homologs is very low (below 10%). M1 contains three TPR-like helical repeats, α12–13, α14–15 and α16–17, capped by α11 and α18 on either side. In most TPR repeats, the two helices have approximately equal lengths and are connected via a sharp turn. M1 is more irregular in that the length of the helices varies from 8 to 15 residues. The three repeats are slightly curved to form a shallow concave surface. Module M2 has four TPR-like repeats, composed of helix pairs α20–21, α22–23, α25–26, and α28–29, respectively. Two short helices, α24 and α27, are interspersed in the repeat pattern. The C-terminal helix of Nic96, α30, packs against the helix hairpin α28–29 and forms a hydrophilic cap as seen in other TPR-like structures. Compared with M1, the helices in M2 are longer, and their relative orientation compared with TPR-like domains is more irregular. Most prominently, the typical shallow concave groove formed by TPR-like domains, which is often used for functionally important protein-protein interactions, is closed in Nic96. Helices α22 and α28 roll over helix α25 and directly interact with each other. This way, the concave surface curvature is lost and the module adopts a more compact shape. Sequence Comparison Shows Strong Conservation of the Nic96 Architecture—Apart from the similarities with TPR-like domains of the modules mentioned above, Nic96 has several specific architectural features, two being particularly noteworthy. On one end of the elongated molecule, residues 269–444 form an irregular but compact bundle consisting of helices α4–α11 connected by several extended, poorly ordered loops. Helix α6 (residues 333–343) is at the center of the bundle and is encased by helices α4, α5, α7, α10, and α11 (Fig. 3A). Because α6 is completely shielded from the solvent, it is mostly hydrophobic, a feature that was noticed when Nic96 was first described (22Grandi P. Doye V. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3061-3071Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). No structural homologs of the helical bundle could be found using either VAST or Dali. A second noticeable feature of Nic96 is helix α19, which connects the two TPR-like modules. Helix α19 is interrupted by a 12-residue insertion forming a short β-hairpin. To interrupt the helix, two g"
https://openalex.org/W1994994978,"Background While many studies have investigated the occurrence of extra-pair paternity in wild populations of birds, we still know surprisingly little about whether individual females differ intrinsically in their principal readiness to copulate, and to what extent this readiness is affected by male attractiveness. Methodology/Findings To address this question I used captive zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) as a model system. I first measured female readiness to copulate when courted by a male for the first time in life. Second, I conducted choice-chamber experiments to assess the mating preferences of individual females prior to pair formation. I then paired females socially with a non-desired mate and once they had formed a stable pair bond, I observed the inclination of these females to engage in extra-pair copulations with various males. Females showing a high readiness to copulate when courted by a male for the first time in life were much more likely to engage in extra-pair copulations later in life than others. Male attractiveness, as measured in choice tests, was a useful predictor of whether females engaged in extra-pair copulations with these males, but, surprisingly, the attractiveness of a female's social partner had no effect on her fidelity. However, it remained unclear what made some males more attractive than others. Contrary to a widespread but rarely tested hypothesis, females did not preferentially copulate with males having a redder beak or singing at a higher rate. Rather it seemed that song rate was a confounding factor in choice-chamber experiments: song attracted the female's attention but did not increase the male's attractiveness as a copulation partner. Conclusions/Significance Intrinsic variation in female readiness to copulate as well as variation in the attractiveness of the extra-pair male but not the social partner decided the outcome of extra-pair encounters."
https://openalex.org/W2027213961,"Crocodilians have a wide distribution, often in remote areas, are cryptic, secretive and are easily disturbed by human presence. Their capacity for large scale movements is poorly known. Here, we report the first study of post-release movement patterns in translocated adult crocodiles, and the first application of satellite telemetry to a crocodilian. Three large male Crocodylus porosus (3.1-4.5 m) were captured in northern Australia and translocated by helicopter for 56, 99 and 411 km of coastline, the last across Cape York Peninsula from the west coast to the east coast. All crocodiles spent time around their release site before returning rapidly and apparently purposefully to their capture locations. The animal that circumnavigated Cape York Peninsula to return to its capture site, travelled more than 400 km in 20 days, which is the longest homeward travel yet reported for a crocodilian. Such impressive homing ability is significant because translocation has sometimes been used to manage potentially dangerous C. porosus close to human settlement. It is clear that large male estuarine crocodiles can exhibit strong site fidelity, have remarkable navigational skills, and may move long distances following a coastline. These long journeys included impressive daily movements of 10-30 km, often consecutively."
https://openalex.org/W2071893696,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small noncoding RNA gene products, on average 22 nt long, found in a wide variety of organisms. They play important regulatory roles by targeting mRNAs for degradation or translational repression. There are 377 known mouse miRNAs and 475 known human miRNAs in the May 2007 release of the miRBase database, the majority of which are conserved between the two species. A number of recent reports imply that it is likely that many mammalian miRNAs remain to be discovered. The possibility that there are more of them expressed at lower levels or in more specialized expression contexts calls for the exploitation of genome sequence information to accelerate their discovery.In this article, we describe a computational method-mirCoS-that uses three support vector machine models sequentially to discover new miRNA candidates in mammalian genomes based on sequence, secondary structure, and conservation. mirCoS can efficiently detect the majority of known miRNAs and predicts an extensive set of hairpin structures based on human-mouse comparisons. In total, 3476 mouse candidates and 3441 human candidates were found. These hairpins are more similar to known miRNAs than to negative controls in several aspects not considered by the prediction algorithm. A significant fraction of predictions is supported by existing expression evidence.Using a novel approach, mirCoS performs comparably to or better than existing miRNA prediction methods, and contributes a significant number of new candidate miRNAs for experimental verification."

It is now well established that αBC is a major player in the function of muscular tissues, for example it protects cardiomyocytes from adverse conditions such as ischemic stress (4Martin J.L.

Physiol. 2002; 283: H85-H91Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). αBC and sHsps in general are widely believed to act as molecular chaperones, preventing the aggregation and precipitation of damaged or misfolded proteins in an ATP-independent way in stress conditions (5Jakob U.

At the cellular level, sHsps protect cells from noxious conditions as diverse as toxicity promoted by aberrantly folded proteins, oxidative conditions, and proteasome inhibition. Distinct mechanisms have been proposed for the protective effects of sHsps, including chaperone-like activity, anti-apoptotic effects, or intracellular redox homeostasis (13Chavez Zobel A.T.

Mutations in sHsps are associated with the development of several degenerative diseases. A number of mutations in αB-crystallin were identified that lead to the degeneration of distinct tissues, including the lens of the eye and/or cardiac and skeletal muscles (20Vicart P. Caron A.

Which of the tissues actually is affected depends on the specific mutation, and currently it is not known what causes this clinical heterogeneity. In addition, two others sHsps, Hsp22 and Hsp27, have been associated with the human degenerative diseases Charcot-Marie-Tooth and distal hereditary motor neuron diseases (27Irobi J. Van Impe K.

The first discovered sHsp mutation is the missense mutation R120G in αBC (R120GαBC) (20Vicart P. Caron A. Guicheney P. Li Z. Prevost M.C. Faure A. Chateau D. Chapon F. Tome F. Dupret J.M. Paulin D. Fardeau M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar), and to date this is the best studied mutation. The R120G mutation in αBC results in dominant gain-of-function properties and causes a particular subtype of myofibrillar myopathy (desmin-related myopathy or αB-crystallinopathy) with associated cardiac involvement and cataract formation. The R120GαBC protein exhibits changes in its secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structural features (34Perng M.D. Muchowski P.J. van Den I.P. Wu G.J. Hutcheson A.M. Clark J.I. Quinlan R.A. J. Biol.

FEBS J. 2005; 272: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It is more polydisperse than the wild-type αBC (WTαBC) (36Bova M.P. Yaron O. Huang Q. Ding L. Haley D.A. Stewart P.L. Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6137-6142Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) and is inherently unstable in solution (37Treweek T.M. Rekas A. Lindner R.A. Walker M.J. Aquilina J.A. Robinson C.V. Horwitz J. Perng M.D. Quinlan R.A. Carver J.A. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These structural disturbances correlate with a decreased in vitro chaperone-like activity (36Bova M.P. Yaron O. Huang Q. Ding L. Haley D.A. Stewart P.L. Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6137-6142Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). A recent study has established that R120GαBC directly promotes the aggregation of the desmin filament network and that desmin networks are differently affected, depending on the cellular backgrounds (38Perng M.D. Wen S.F. van den I.P. Prescott A.R. Quinlan R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2335-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In various cell lines, independent of desmin levels, R120GαBC aggregates in a time-dependent process starting with the formation of multiple foci of insoluble proteins in the cytoplasm. Subsequently, these foci coalesce into large amorphous perinuclear aggregates in a microtubular network-dependent manner. Expression of R120GαBC leads to the formation of a cage of type III intermediate filament proteins such as vimentin, but also of a cage of type II intermediate filament proteins such as keratins, suggesting a general response of the intermediate filament networks to the aggregate formation. Nevertheless, these intermediate filament proteins have not been found as components of the aggregates by themselves, in contrast to desmin (13Chavez Zobel A.T. Loranger A. Marceau N. Theriault J.R. Lambert H. Landry J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 1609-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Moreover, R120GαBC and its pseudophosphorylated mutants are unable to confer resistance to differentiation-induced apoptosis during C2C12 myoblast differentiation because of their impaired capacity to inhibit the proteolytic activation of caspase-3 (39Kamradt M.C. Chen F. Sam S. Cryns V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38731-38736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Overexpression of R120GαBC in cardiomyocytes of transgenic mice results in a 100% mortality by early adulthood in high expressing lines, whereas a modest expression level results in a strikingly similar phenotype to that observed in patients with R120GαBC-associated cardiomyopathies (40Wang X. Osinska H. Klevitsky R. Gerdes A.M. Nieman M. Lorenz J. Hewett T. Robbins J. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In these transgenic mice, the desmin network, myofibril alignment, mitochondrial-sarcomere architecture, mitochondrial function, and the ubiquitin/proteasome system (UPS) were significantly impaired (41Maloyan A. Sanbe A. Osinska H. Westfall M. Robinson D. Imahashi K. Murphy E. Robbins J. Circulation. 2005; 112: 3451-3461Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 42Chen Q. Liu J.B. Horak K.M. Zheng H. Kumarapeli A.R. Li J. Li F. Gerdes A.M. Wawrousek E.F. Wang X. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 1018-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In addition, a hypertrophic response occurred, and the apoptotic pathways were activated (41Maloyan A. Sanbe A. Osinska H. Westfall M. Robinson D. Imahashi K. Murphy E. Robbins J. Circulation. 2005; 112: 3451-3461Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Taken together, it appears that all the known protective functions of αBC are impaired. The two other αBC mutations that are associated with myofibrillar myopathy are the nonsense mutation Q151X (Q151XαBC) and the frameshift mutation 464delCT (464αBC) (22Selcen D. Engel A.G. Ann. Neurol. 2003; 54: 804-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Both mutants caused the formation of cytoplasmic aggregates in skeletal muscles, without cardiac or eye lens involvement. No further information on these two mutants is available. Recently, several studies have investigated the potential of sHsp overexpression for the treatment of degenerative diseases. Hsp22, Hsp27, and WTαBC revealed a high capacity to dissociate the aggregates formed by R120GαBC expression in several cell lines (13Chavez Zobel A.T. Loranger A. Marceau N. Theriault J.R. Lambert H. Landry J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 1609-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 43Ito H. Kamei K. Iwamoto I. Inaguma Y. Tsuzuki M. Kishikawa M. Shimada A. Hosokawa M. Kato K. Cell. Mol.

Chem. 2007; 282: 555-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, recent studies in cardiomyocytes suggest that the resulting hetero-oligomers of WTαBC/R120GαBC were more toxic for the cells than the homo-oligomers formed by the R120GαBC alone (44Sanbe A. Osinska H. Villa C. Gulick J. Klevitsky R. Glabe C.G. Kayed R. Robbins J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13592-13597Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In contrast, both Hsp22 and Hsp25 (murine equivalent of Hsp27) co-expression with R120GαBC rescued cell viability (45Sanbe A. Yamauchi J. Miyamoto Y. Fujiwara Y. Murabe M. Tanoue A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 555-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). So far, there is no explanation for this differential effect of αBC and Hsp22 or Hsp27/Hsp25 to date. In this study we have determined properties of the three mutants of αBC (MTTαBC), R120GαBC, Q151XαBC, and of 464αBC, that are associated with myofibrillar myopathy. We show that all three mutant proteins form abnormal cytoplasmic aggregates in both cardiomyocytes and in COS-7 cells. Moreover, MTTαBC proteins expressed in COS-7 cells distribute into additional cell fractions as compared with WTαBC. We also show that all three mutant proteins are hyperphosphorylated in all the three known phosphorylation sites (serine residues 19, 45, and 59) when expressed in COS-7 cells. We also investigated the interaction properties of these three MTTαBC with themselves, with WTαBC, and with Hsp20, Hsp22, and Hsp27. These sHsps are known as interaction partners of αBC and are abundant in muscles (46Kato K. Goto S. Inaguma Y. Hasegawa K. Morishita R. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15302-15309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Sugiyama Y. Suzuki A. Kishikawa M. Akutsu R. Hirose T. Waye M.M. Tsui S.K. Yoshida S. Ohno S. J. Biol.

Using the yeast two-hybrid (TH) method, chemical cross-linking (CL), pulldown (PD) assays, and the quantitative fluorescence resonance energy transfer (qFRET) method in live mammalian cells, we show here that all three MTTαBC proteins are able to interact with themselves, with WTαBC, and with the other sHsps. We have identified a unique interaction pattern for each mutant with the other sHsps. It is expected that these identified abnormal properties of the three studied MTTαBC forms will contribute to a better understanding of the molecular processes that lead to the associated diseases and to the design of therapeutic strategies. Vector Constructs—TH vector constructs were made using the vectors pACT2 and pAS2 (Clontech). Cyan (CFP) and citrine (Cit) fluorescent fusion protein expression vectors were made using the vectors pECFP-N1, pECFP-C1 (both from Clontech), and pCit-N1 and pCit-C1 (49Hoppe A. Christensen K. Swanson J.A. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 3652-3664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Myc/His-tagged and untagged protein constructs were made using the vectors pcDNA3.1(+)/myc-His B and pcDNA3, respectively (both from Invitrogen). A list of all used constructs and more detailed cloning information is given in supplemental Table 1 (construct numbers as used in this study are given in square braquets). Additional information on the constructs used is also given in previous publications (20Vicart P. Caron A. Guicheney P. Li Z. Prevost M.C. Faure A. Chateau D. Chapon F. Tome F. Dupret J.M. Paulin D.

Two-hybrid Method—Small scale sequential transformation of yeast strain AH109 was performed as described in the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). Colonies were selected on -Trp, -Leu, -His medium for the phenotypes His+ (growth) and LacZ+ (blue color). The interaction assays were considered positive if both reporter genes were activated. For negative controls, yeast were transformed with each used vector alone and tested on -Trp, -Leu, and -His medium (not shown). Additionally, yeast were co-transformed with each vector and with the 'empty’ partner vector as indicated in the figure legends (C1–C11, cf. supplemental Figs. 1B, 2A, 3A, and 4A). In none of these controls were the reporter genes activated. Cell Culture and Transfections—COS-7 cells were grown in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Invitrogen) and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. One day prior to transfections, cells were trypsinized and plated as specified below. Transfections were carried out using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) with 0.75 μg (single construct) or 1.5 μg (two constructs) of vector DNA for CFP or Cit constructs or 2 μg of vector DNA for pcDNA3 or pcDNA3.1(+)/myc-His B constructs. Cardiomyocyte Isolation, Culture, and Infection—Rat neonatal ventricular myocytes were isolated by standard batch collagenase digestion and subsequently preplated to remove the fibroblasts. Cardiomyocytes were then counted and plated on gelatin-coated dishes in serum-free PC-1 medium (BioWhittaker). Twenty four hours after plating, the cells were washed, and the medium was changed to DMEM/M199 (4:1) maintenance medium. The cells were then transduced with adenovirus expressing the appropriate CFP fusion at an multiplicity of infection of 50. Two days later the cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde solution, and rhodamine-phalloidin was stained before imaging. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—COS-7 cells were grown on coverslips, transfected, and 48 h later were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, fixed, and permeabilized at 4 °C for 5 min with cold methanol/acetone (7:3). Subsequently, cells were incubated for 1 h each at room temperature with primary polyclonal rabbit antibody (diluted 1:200 in PBS, 2% FCS) directed against the first 10 residues of αBC (Abcam) and with secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody (diluted 1:1000 in PBS, 2% FCS) coupled to AlexaFluor 11034 (Invitrogen). The coverslips were mounted on slides using Mowiol (Sigma). Images were collected using a fluorescent microscope (Leitz) equipped with a digital camera ORCA-ER (Hamamatsu) and processed using the Simple PCI 6.0 software (Compix Inc. Imaging Systems). Live Cell Imaging—COS-7 cells were grown in 6-well glass-bottom culture plates (MatTek Corp.). 48 h after transfection with the various CFP and Cit fusion protein vectors, cells were washed twice with PBS and kept in DMEM without phenol red (Invitrogen). For fluorescence microscopy an inverted epifluorescence microscope (Eclipse TE-2000 U; Nikon) was used equipped with a 100-watt mercury arc-lamp, exciter filters 430/25 and 500/20, a dichroic microscope filter 86002bs, and with a 505dcxr Dual View Micro Imager MSMI.DV.CC (Optical Insights) with the emission filters 470/30 and 535/30. Images were collected by a digital CoolSnap CCD camera (Photometrics) and processed using Metamorph image processing software version 6.2r5 (Molecular Devices). For determination of the fraction of cells with aggregates, microscopic fields were selected randomly using a Plan fluor ELWD ×40/0.6 objective lens (Nikon). At least 100 cells per sample group were included in these evaluations. Quantitative Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer Measurements in Live Cells—The qFRET method was applied for quantification of apparent fluorescence resonance energy transfer efficiencies (AAFE) as indicators of protein interaction. The configuration of the microscope was as described above for live cell imaging using a Fluor ELWD ×40/1.3 oil Dic H objective lens (Nikon). Maintenance and transfection of COS-7 cells with the various CFP and Cit fusion protein vectors was as described for live cell imaging. In each cell to be analyzed, three cytoplasmic areas without protein aggregates were selected for qFRET measurements. Images from at least 30 microscopic fields per sample group were acquired and background/shading-corrected prior to computation by the qFRET algorithm. The calculated output data were expressed as (EA + ED)/2 (EA is apparent acceptor efficiency calculated from sensitized emission and dependent on the fraction of acceptor in complex; ED is apparent donor efficiency calculated relative to donor fluorescence and dependent on the fraction of the donor in complex). More details concerning qFRET are given in earlier publications (49Hoppe A. Christensen K. Swanson J.A. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 3652-3664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 51Fontaine J.M. Sun X. Hoppe A.D. Simon S. Vicart P. Welsh M.J. Benndorf R. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 2168-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). As negative controls, the cells were transfected with the “empty” CFP (peCFP-N1) and Cit (peCit-N1) vectors (Fig. 3D) or with the empty Cit (peCit-N1/C1) and the various CFP constructs (supplemental Figs. 2C, 3C, and 4D). AAFE values that were significantly different from the control signals indicated interaction. Quantitative data are expressed as the mean of AAFE values ±S.E. The data between groups were analyzed using one-way ANOVA. When overall significance was detected, a post hoc multiple group comparison was conducted using Tukey HSD adjustment. Differences between groups were considered statistically significant if p < 0.05. Analysis of the Phosphorylation Status of αB-crystallin—COS-7 cells were grown in 6-well plates. 48 h after transfection, cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and lysed using the ReadyPrep protein extraction kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One volume of buffer A (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 400 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% bromphenol blue) was added, and the samples were boiled for 3 min followed by SDS-PAGE/Western blotting. Equal loading of the samples was verified by visualization of vimentin on the same blots using a monoclonal anti-vimentin antibody diluted to 1:2000 (Sigma). Phosphorylation of the three known serine phosphorylation sites (Ser-19, Ser-45, and Ser-59) of αBC (52Kato K. Ito H. Kamei K. Inaguma Y. Iwamoto I. Saga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28346-28354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) was determined using phosphorylation site-specific polyclonal antibodies, diluted to 1:2000 (Stress-Gen). After electrotransfer of the proteins, the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was blocked with bovine serum albumin free of IgG (Interchim). For immunodetection, secondary goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies diluted to 1:10,000 (Pierce) were used. The degree of phosphorylation of the various αBC species was quantified on scanned images using ImageJ software (53Abramoff M.D. Magelhaes P.J. Ram S.J. Biophotonics International. 2004; 11: 36-42Google Scholar). The base-line signal was obtained from untransfected control cells. Protein Fractionation—COS-7 cells were grown in 10-cm cell culture dishes and transfected with vectors coding for Myc/His-tagged αBC species [5–7]. 48 h after transfection, ∼4 × 106 cells were harvested, and the cell proteins were differentially extracted yielding the fractions of cytosolic proteins, membrane/organelle proteins, nuclear proteins, and cytoskeletal proteins using the ProteoExtract subcellular proteome extraction kit (Calbiochem) according to the man"
https://openalex.org/W2001209104,"EDD (or HYD) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase in the family of HECT (homologous to E6-AP C terminus) ligases. EDD contains an N-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain, which is present in a variety of proteins involved in ubiquitin-mediated processes. Here, we use isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), NMR titrations, and pull-down assays to show that the EDD UBA domain binds ubiquitin. The 1.85Å crystal structure of the complex with ubiquitin reveals the structural basis of ubiquitin recognition by UBA helices α1 and α3. The structure shows a larger number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds than observed in previous UBA/ubiquitin complexes. Two of these involve ordered water molecules. The functional importance of residues at the UBA/ubiquitin interface was confirmed using site-directed mutagenesis. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements show that the EDD UBA domain does not have a strong preference for polyubiquitin chains over monoubiquitin. This suggests that EDD binds to monoubiquitinated proteins, which is consistent with its involvement in DNA damage repair pathways. EDD (or HYD) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase in the family of HECT (homologous to E6-AP C terminus) ligases. EDD contains an N-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain, which is present in a variety of proteins involved in ubiquitin-mediated processes. Here, we use isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), NMR titrations, and pull-down assays to show that the EDD UBA domain binds ubiquitin. The 1.85Å crystal structure of the complex with ubiquitin reveals the structural basis of ubiquitin recognition by UBA helices α1 and α3.

Both belong to the family of HECT (homologous to E6-AP C terminus) E3 ubiquitin ligases, which target specific proteins for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. The highly conserved ubiquitin/proteasome pathway controls the degradation of many critical regulatory proteins. Proteins are targeted by conjugation of a 76-residue ubiquitin moiety to lysine residues via an isopeptide bond. This occurs through a combined set of reactions involving activating (E1), conjugating (E2), and ligating (E3) enzymes. E3 enzymes physically interact with their substrates and are thus critical determinants of the specificity of ubiquitination. Two main groups of E3 ubiquitin ligases include RING finger (1Kwon Y.T.

In Drosophila, EDD is required for regulation of cell proliferation during development (3Mansfield E. Hersperger E. Biggs J. Shearn A. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 507-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It is inferred that EDD functions in signal transduction downstream of the receptors to initiate and/or maintain proliferation as well as signals to terminate proliferation (3Mansfield E. Hersperger E. Biggs J. Shearn A. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 507-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Cells with mutations in EDD fail to properly terminate proliferation leading to a tumorous phenotype. The mutations also result in developmental abnormalities such as adult sterility due to germ cell defects (4Callaghan M.J. Russell A.J. Woollatt E. Sutherland G.R. Sutherland R.L. Watts C.K.

Recently, EDD was shown to activate the DNA damage checkpoint kinase CHK2 (9Henderson M.J. Munoz M.A. Saunders D.N. Clancy J.L. Russell A.J. Williams B. Pappin D. Khanna K.K. Jackson S.P.

EDD also interacts with the calcium and integrin-binding protein (CIB) in a DNA damage-dependent manner (10Henderson M.J. Russell A.J. Hird S. Munoz M. Clancy J.L. Lehrbach G.M. Calanni S.T.

Finally, EDD is an in vivo substrate for the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1 and 2 (11Eblen S.T. Kumar N.V. Shah K. Henderson M.J. Watts C.K. Shokat K.M. Weber M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14926-14935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). As a ubiquitin ligase, EDD was shown to control the levels of poly(A)-binding protein interacting protein 2 (Paip2) (12Yoshida M. Yoshida K. Kozlov G. Lim N.S. De Crescenzo G. Pang Z. Berlanga J.J. Kahvejian A. Gehring K. Wing S.S. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1934-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Structurally, EDD contains a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain at its N terminus (10Henderson M.J. Russell A.J. Hird S. Munoz M. Clancy J.L. Lehrbach G.M. Calanni S.T. Jans D.A. Sutherland R.L.

Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 7120-7136Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), a domain homologous to the C-terminal domain of poly(A)-binding protein (PABC), and a HECT domain at its far C terminus. UBA domains were originally identified in a variety of proteins involved in ubiquitin-mediated processes (14Hofmann K. Bucher P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 172-173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 15Hurley J.H. Lee S. Prag G. Biochem. J. 2006; 399: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of a UBA domain shows a bundle of three α-helices (16Dieckmann T. Withers-Ward E.S. Jarosinski M.A. Liu C.F. Chen I.S. Feigon J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1042-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). UBA domains generally contain surface patches of hydrophobic residues, which are involved in protein-protein interactions. Most UBA domains bind ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like (UBL) domains (17Mueller T.D. Feigon J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1243-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Two structures of a UBA domain in complex with monoubiquitin determined by NMR spectroscopy show that the first loop and the C-terminal part of helix α3 of the UBA domain bind to the β-sheet of ubiquitin centered on Ile44 (18Ohno, A., Jee, J., Fujiwara, K., Tenno, T., Goda, N., Tochio, H., Kobayashi, H., Hiroaki, H., and Shirakawa, M. (2005) Structure. 13, 521-532Google Scholar, 19Swanson K.A. Hicke L. Radhakrishnan I. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 713-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In particular, the methionine residue from the α1–α2 loop, conserved in many UBA domains, makes key hydrophobic contacts with ubiquitin. Despite the existing structural information, the mechanism of ubiquitin recognition is still not understood for a number of UBA domains. For instance, some UBA domains do not contain the critical methionine or even a hydrophobic residue in the corresponding position and still bind to ubiquitin efficiently (20Raasi S. Varadan R. Fushman D. Pickart C.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 708-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The low sequence homology between UBA domains makes predicting and understanding their function difficult. For example, recent high-resolution crystal structures of UBA domains from Cbl ubiquitin ligases revealed that, unlike previously studied UBA domains, the Cbl-b UBA domain binds ubiquitin via UBA helix α1 (21Peschard P. Kozlov G. Lin T. Mirza I.A. Berghuis A.M. Lipkowitz S. Park M. Gehring K. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 474-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) while the c-Cbl UBA domain dimerizes (22Kozlov G. Peschard P. Zimmerman B. Lin T. Moldoveanu T. Mansur-Azzam N. Gehring K. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27547-27555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Here, we used pull-down assays, SPR, ITC, and NMR spectroscopy to show that UBA from EDD ligase binds to monoubiquitin and polyubiquitin chains. To understand the structural basis of this binding, we performed x-ray crystallography and mutational analysis of this UBA domain. We report the crystal structure of EDD UBA in complex with ubiquitin. The structure improves our understanding of ubiquitin recognition by UBA domains and provides a basis for further functional studies of the ubiquitin ligase EDD. Protein Expression, Preparation, and Purification—The UBA domain from human EDD ligase (residues 180–230) was cloned into a pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) in rich (LB) medium as a fusion with N-terminal GST tag. To aid quantification, an I180Y mutation was introduced into the constructs used for NMR and ITC. The wild-type sequence was used for crystallization, SPR, pull-down assays, and site-directed mutagenesis studies. GST fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose resin, and the tag was removed by cleavage with thrombin, leaving a two-residue Gly-Ser N-terminal extension. The cleaved protein was additionally purified using size-exclusion chromatography (Superdex-75) and buffer exchanged using Centricon 5000 concentrators. For NMR experiments, the protein was labeled by growth in M9 minimal medium with [15N]ammonium sulfate or [15N]ammonium sulfate/[13C]glucose as the sole sources of nitrogen and carbon. Bovine ubiquitin was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using QuikChange™ (Stratagene) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. In Vitro Binding Assays—Expression of GST-UBA in E. coli BL21 was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. Bacteria were lysed by sonication in TNE buffer (50 mm Tris·Cl pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA) containing 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and the lysates cleared by ultracentrifugation. Binding assays were carried out by incubating bacterial lysates containing 1 μg of GST-UBA with 12 μl of ubiquitin-agarose (120 μg of ubiquitin) (Boston Biochem, Inc.) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed extensively with TGH buffer (50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) and the bound proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunodetection with anti-GST. Alternatively, 1 μg of GST-UBA fusion protein immobilized on glutathione Sepharose was incubated with 2 μg of either K48- or K63-linked ubiquitin chains (Boston Biochem, Inc.) for 1 h at 4 °C, washed extensively with TGH buffer, and the bound proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunodetection. Anti-ubiquitin (P4D1) and anti-GST (B-14) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) Measurements—Experiments were carried out on a MicroCal VP-ITC titration calorimeter (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA) using the VPViewer software for instrument control and data acquisition. The buffer used for ITC experiments contained 25 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 70 mm NaCl. During a titration experiment, 50 μm sample of UBA from EDD was thermostatted at 293 K in a stirred (260 rpm) reaction cell of 1.4 ml. Thirty-seven injections, each of 8-μl volume and 10-s duration with a 5-min interval between injections, were carried out using a 296-μl syringe filled with 1.0 mm ubiquitin solution. The calorimetric data were processed, and the binding affinity determined using the software ORIGIN (version 5.0) provided by the manufacturer. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)-based Biosensor Analysis — The interaction of UBA from EDD with the synthetic ubiquitin was analyzed by SPR (23Jonsson U. Fagerstam L. Ivarsson B. Johnsson B. Karlsson R. Lundh K. Lofas S. Persson B. Roos H. Ronnberg I. Sjulander S. Stenberg E. Stahlberg R. Urbaniczky C. Ostlin H. Malmqvist M. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 620-627PubMed Google Scholar) using a BIACORE 3000 optical biosensor (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Protein dilutions were performed in running buffer, which contained 10 mm HEPES at pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, and 0.005% Tween 20. The concentration of EDD UBA was determined by hydrolysis and amino acid analysis. In a first series of experiments, monoubiquitin, K48-linked, K63-linked di- and tetraubiquitin were immobilized onto CM5 biosensor chip flow cells using amine coupling chemistry as described previously (23Jonsson U. Fagerstam L. Ivarsson B. Johnsson B. Karlsson R. Lundh K. Lofas S. Persson B. Roos H. Ronnberg I. Sjulander S. Stenberg E. Stahlberg R. Urbaniczky C. Ostlin H. Malmqvist M. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 620-627PubMed Google Scholar), leading to 2000 RUs of monoubiquitin, 3200 and 6300 RU of K63- and K48-diubiquitin, 11500 and 11000 RU of K48- and K63-tetraubiquitin. Biosensor experiments were repeated a minimum of two times and corrected for binding to a separate control flow cell (activated and blocked). The experiments were performed at 25 °C using a flow rate of 50 μl/min. For each experiment, at least 5 different concentrations of EDD UBA were injected over each experimental and control flow cell (1 min injections, extraclean procedure). In a second series of experiments, EDD UBA was biotinylated by addition and 90 min of incubation of 2 mg of EZ-Link® NHS-Chromogenic-Biotin (Pierce Biotechnology) to 0.6 μmol of EDD UBA in 1 ml buffer (10 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) plus 200 μl Me2SO. Biotinylated protein was purified by gel filtration and quantified by optical spectroscopy (354 nm). The biotinylated EDD UBA (85 RU) was captured onto a streptavidin-coated (SA) sensor-chip flow cell previously prepared by three successive pulses of 1 m NaCl in 50 mm NaOH, according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Injections of monoubiquitin, K48- and N-to-C-linked diubiquitin were performed in duplicate over EDD UBA and control (streptavidin only) surfaces. Thermodynamic dissociation constants (Kd) were determined using control-corrected plateau values; the Kd was derived from fitting of the experimental values. For analysis of ubiquitin chains binding to the UBA-derivatized surface, a global analysis was used in which the number of binding sites on the surface was constrained to be equal in all experiments. Crystallization—Conditions were identified utilizing hanging drop vapor diffusion using the JCSG crystallization suite (Qiagen). The best crystals of the complex were obtained by equilibrating a 0.6-μl drop of an equimolar protein mixture (15 mg/ml total) in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), mixed with 0.6 μl of reservoir solution containing 0.1 m citric acid (pH 5.0) and 20% (w/v) PEG 6000 and suspended over 0.6 ml of reservoir solution. Crystals grew in 3–7 days at 20 °C. For data collection, crystals were picked up in a nylon loop and flash-cooled in a N2 cold stream. The solution for cryoprotection contained the reservoir solution with addition of 20% (v/v) of glycerol. The crystals contained four UBA and four ubiquitin molecules in the asymmetric unit corresponding to Vm = 2.2 Å3 Da-1 and a solvent content of 44% (24Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7917) Google Scholar). Structure Solution and Refinement—Diffraction data from a single crystal of the UBA-ubiquitin complex were collected on an ADSC Quantum-315 CCD detector (Area Detector Systems Corp.) at beamline X29 at the NSLS, Brookhaven National Laboratory (Table 1). Data processing and scaling were performed with HKL2000 (25Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38526) Google Scholar). The structure was determined by molecular replacement with Phaser (26Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar), using the coordinates of ubiquitin (PDB entry 1UBQ) and the UBA domain from Cbl-b (PDB entry 2OOA). The initial model obtained from Phaser was completed and adjusted with the program Xfit (27McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2021) Google Scholar) and was improved by several cycles of refinement, using the program CNS v.1.1 (28Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16957) Google Scholar) and model refitting. The refinement statistics are given in Table 1. Out of 53 residues in the UBA construct, the current model does not include residues Arg226–Asp230 in chain B, Glu229–Asp230 in chains D and F, and Asp228–Asp230 in chain H. The three C-terminal residues of ubiquitin are also disordered in the chains A and G, while chains C and E are complete due to crystal packing. The final model has good stereochemistry (Table 1) according to the program PROCHECK (29Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar).

Protein signal assignments were performed using standard techniques, including three-dimensional experiments HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, and 15N NOESY-HMQC. NMR samples contained 0.7–1.4 mm protein in 25 mm phosphate, 70 mm NaCl at pH 7.0. Signals for unliganded EDD UBA were reassigned using 15N NOESY-HMQC. For NMR titrations, unlabeled ubiquitin was added to the 15N-labeled 0.5–1.0 mm wild-type UBA or its mutants to the final molar ratio of 3 to 1 or 4 to 1, respectively. All NMR experiments were performed at 303 K using Varian 500 MHz and Bruker 600 MHz spectrometers. NMR spectra were processed using NMRPipe (30Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11529) Google Scholar) and analyzed with XEASY (31Bartels C. Xia T.H. Billeter M. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar). EDD UBA Binds to Ubiquitin and Polyubiquitin Chains—To study the previously uncharacterized UBA domain, residues Ile180 to Asp230 of EDD were cloned for expression in E. coli. We tested its binding to ubiquitin using pull-down assays with ubiquitin agarose (Fig. 1A). EDD UBA bound to monoubiquitin with an affinity similar to that of the UBA domain from the Cbl-b ubiquitin ligase (21Peschard P. Kozlov G. Lin T. Mirza I.A. Berghuis A.M. Lipkowitz S. Park M. Gehring K. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 474-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Because many UBA domains have higher affinity for ubiquitin chains than for monoubiquitin, we also performed in vitro binding assays with K48- and K63-linked ubiquitin chains. While EDD UBA bound both forms of polyubiquitin, it displayed relatively higher affinity for K63-linked chains compared with the UBA domain from Cbl-b (Fig. 1B). To further characterize the binding, we applied isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to determine binding constant and thermodynamic parameters of interactions between the EDD UBA domain and ubiquitin (Fig. 1C). The affinity (Kd) of the EDD UBA domain for monoubiquitin was measured to be 60 ± 15 μm, which is higher than the affinity of most characterized UBA domains (32Hicke L. Schubert H.L. Hill C.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 610-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar) but again very similar to the affinity of Cbl-b (21Peschard P. Kozlov G. Lin T. Mirza I.A. Berghuis A.M. Lipkowitz S. Park M. Gehring K. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 474-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). EDD UBA Does Not Have Specificity for Ubiquitin Chains—We used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments to verify the pull-down results and quantify the affinity of the EDD UBA domain for different ubiquitin chains (Fig. 2). Five different SPR surfaces were prepared and EDD UBA domain was injected over them (Fig. 2A). At the highest UBA concentration (0.55 mm), the binding curves did not reach saturation, which limited the extent of analysis possible. In addition, the surfaces appeared to suffer from heterogeneity resulting from multiple modes of ubiquitin and polyubiquitin coupling to the surface. This led to large overestimates of the Kd's but still allowed qualitative comparisons between surfaces. As a control, the UBA domain of Mud1 was used (33Trempe J.F. Brown N.R. Lowe E.D. Gordon C. Campbell I.D. Noble M.E. Endicott J.A. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3178-3189Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Kd values of EDD UBA for the polyubiquitin surfaces were roughly half the Kd for monoubiquitin (Fig. 2A). The UBA domain showed slightly better affinity for K63-diubiquitin than for K48-diubiquitin but there was no difference between the two tetraubiquitin surfaces. In contrast, the Mud1 UBA showed a 5-fold preference for K48-linked polyubiquitin with Kd values of 58 μm for the K48-Ub4 surface and 283 μm for the K63-Ub4 surface (supplemental Fig. S1). Our conclusion is that unlike Mud1, the UBA domain from EDD did not show markedly higher affinity for the K48- or K63-linked polyubiquitin surfaces. We also carried out reciprocal SPR experiments injecting ubiquitin chains over a surface on which the EDD UBA domain had been captured (Fig. 2B). Although we were limited by the amounts and types of ubiquitin chains that could be used, this second approach had the advantage that a single surface could be used to compare affinities. The lower loading of the surface also significantly improved the agreement between affinity of monoubiquitin measured by SPR (127 μm) and ITC (60 μm). On the UBA surface, K48-linked and N-to-C diubiquitin both bound with higher affinity than monoubiquitin but also with detectable negative cooperativity (Fig. 2B). The Kd for N-to-C diubiquitin was half that of K48-diubiquitin, consistent with the more open conformation of this type of chain in solution (34Varadan R. Assfalg M. Haririnia A. Raasi S. Pickart C. Fushman D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7055-7063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The results from the SPR experiments suggest that the EDD UBA domain binds to polyubiquitin relatively poorly compared with other UBA domains (20Raasi S. Varadan R. Fushman D. Pickart C.M. Nat.

The higher apparent affinity for polyubiquitin results from the larger number monoubiquitin units available for binding (avidity effects) and is not due to specific recognition of polyubiquitin chains. K63-linked and N-to-C chains showed better binding due to the more open conformation of these types of chains (34Varadan R. Assfalg M. Haririnia A. Raasi S. Pickart C. Fushman D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7055-7063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In contrast, K48-linked chains bound somewhat less well due to their relatively closed conformation where competition exists between ubiquitin-ubiquitin interactions and UBA binding (35Varadan R. Walker O. Pickart C. Fushman D. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Structure of EDD UBA—To understand the structural basis of the ubiquitin-binding properties of EDD UBA, we co-crystallized ubiquitin with the EDD UBA domain and solved the structure of the complex at 1.85-Å resolution (Table 1). The crystals contained four UBA-ubiquitin complexes in the asymmetric unit. All four complexes were nearly identical; their backbone atoms could be overlaid with an r.m.s.d. of 0.37 Å. The UBA structures themselves could be overlaid with an r.m.s.d. of 0.29 Å. The EDD fragment shows the canonical UBA fold consisting of a three-helical bundle (α1–α3) (Fig. 3). The domain has a well-defined hydrophobic core that includes Ile190, Ala193, Leu197, Ile205, Leu209, Ala219, and Leu223 (Fig. 3A). Among the notable features, the N-terminal portion before the UBA domain contains a short helical turn that packs against helices α1 and α2. This α0-helix covers the hydrophobic patch consisting of Ile190, Ile206, and Leu214 that would be otherwise solvent-exposed (Fig. 3B). Residues Ile180–Pro186 adopted an essentially identical conformation in all four copies in asymmetric unit, which suggests that the α0-helix is structurally relevant. In addition, mutagenesis of Leu189, Ile190, and Ile206 destabilized the protein (see below). On the other hand, NMR experiments showed that the helix is only partially populated. Heteronuclear NOEs revealed that the Ile180–Ser183 region is relatively mobile in solution (supplemental Fig. S2) and 15N NOESY NMR data did not show the medium range NOEs characteristic of a helical turn (data not shown). Superposition of the EDD UBA structure with related structures reveals that EDD UBA is structurally similar to CUE (coupling of ubiquitin conjugation to endoplasmic reticulum degradation) domains. CUE domains are a conserved monoubiquitin-binding fold that resembles UBA domains at the level of amino acid sequence, size, tertiary fold, and ubiquitin binding (18Ohno, A., Jee, J., Fujiwara, K., Tenno, T., Goda, N., Tochio, H., Kobayashi, H., Hiroaki, H., and Shirakawa, M.

https://openalex.org/W2006901635,"Urban areas and their voracious appetites are increasingly dominating the flows of energy and materials around the globe. Understanding the size distribution and dynamics of urban areas is vital if we are to manage their growth and mitigate their negative impacts on global ecosystems. For over 50 years, city size distributions have been assumed to universally follow a power function, and many theories have been put forth to explain what has become known as Zipf's law (the instance where the exponent of the power function equals unity). Most previous studies, however, only include the largest cities that comprise the tail of the distribution. Here we show that national, regional and continental city size distributions, whether based on census data or inferred from cluster areas of remotely-sensed nighttime lights, are in fact lognormally distributed through the majority of cities and only approach power functions for the largest cities in the distribution tails. To explore generating processes, we use a simple model incorporating only two basic human dynamics, migration and reproduction, that nonetheless generates distributions very similar to those found empirically. Our results suggest that macroscopic patterns of human settlements may be far more constrained by fundamental ecological principles than more fine-scale socioeconomic factors."
https://openalex.org/W2020674176,"During HIV-1 infection coreceptor switch from CCR5- (R5)- to CXCR4 (X4)-using viruses is associated with disease progression. X4 strains of HIV-1 are highly cytopathic to immature thymocytes. Virtually no studies have evaluated the HIV-1 quasispecies present in vivo within thymic and lymphoid tissues or the evolutionary relationship between R5 and X4 viruses in tissues and peripheral blood.High-resolution phylodynamic analysis was applied to virus envelope quasispecies in longitudinal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues collected post mortem from therapy naïve children with AIDS. There were three major findings. First, continued evolution of R5 viruses in PBMCs, spleen and lymph nodes involved multiple bottlenecks, independent of coreceptor switch, resulting in fitter quasispecies driven by positive selection. Second, evolution of X4 strains appeared to be a sequential process requiring the initial fixation of positively selected mutations in V1-V2 and C2 domains of R5 variants before the emergence of high charge V3 X4 variants. Third, R5 viruses persisted after the emergence of CXCR4-using strains, which were found predominantly but not exclusively in the thymus.Our data indicate that the evolution of X4 strains is a multi-step, temporally structured process and that the thymus may play an important role in the evolution/amplification of coreceptor variants. Development of new therapeutic protocols targeting virus in the thymus could be important to control HIV-1 infection prior to advanced disease."
https://openalex.org/W1974785215,"After ligand binding and endocytosis, cell surface receptors can continue to signal from endosomal compartments until sequestered from the cytoplasm. An important mechanism for receptor downregulation in vivo is via the inward budding of receptors into intralumenal vesicles to form specialized endosomes called multivesicular bodies (MVBs) that subsequently fuse with lysosomes, degrading their cargo. This process requires four heterooligomeric protein complexes collectively termed the ESCRT machinery. In yeast, ESCRT-I is a heterotetrameric complex comprised of three conserved subunits and a fourth subunit for which identifiable metazoan homologs were lacking. Using C. elegans, we identify MVB-12, a fourth metazoan ESCRT-I subunit. Depletion of MVB-12 slows the kinetics of receptor downregulation in vivo, but to a lesser extent than inhibition of other ESCRT-I subunits. Consistent with these findings, targeting of MVB-12 to membranes requires the other ESCRT-I subunits, but MVB-12 is not required to target the remaining ESCRT-I components. Both endogenous and recombinant ESCRT-I are stable complexes with a 1:1:1:1 subunit stoichiometry. MVB-12 has two human homologs that co-localize and co-immunoprecipitate with the ESCRT-I component TSG101. Thus, MVB-12 is a conserved core component of metazoan ESCRT-I that regulates its activity during MVB biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2089642295,"The contractile stimulation of smooth muscle tissues stimulates the recruitment of proteins to membrane adhesion complexes and the initiation of actin polymerization. We hypothesized that integrin-linked kinase (ILK), a β-integrin-binding scaffolding protein and serine/threonine kinase, and its binding proteins, PINCH, and α-parvin may be recruited to membrane adhesion sites during contractile stimulation of tracheal smooth muscle to mediate cytoskeletal processes required for tension development. Immunoprecipitation analysis indicted that ILK, PINCH, and α-parvin form a stable cytosolic complex and that the ILK·PINCH·α-parvin complex is recruited to integrin adhesion complexes in response to acetylcholine (ACh) stimulation where it associates with paxillin and vinculin. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-ILK and GFP-PINCH were expressed in tracheal muscle tissues and both endogenous and recombinant ILK and PINCH were recruited to the membrane in response to ACh stimulation. The N-terminal LIM1 domain of PINCH binds to ILK and is required for the targeting of the ILK-PINCH complex to focal adhesion sites in fibroblasts during cell adhesion. We expressed the GFP-PINCH LIM1-2 fragment, consisting only of LIM1-2 domains, in tracheal smooth muscle tissues to competitively inhibit the interaction of ILK with PINCH. The PINCH LIM1-2 fragment inhibited the recruitment of endogenous ILK and PINCH to integrin adhesion sites and prevented their association of ILK with β-integrins, paxillin, and vinculin. The PINCH LIM1-2 fragment also inhibited tension development, actin polymerization, and activation of the actin nucleation initiator, N-WASp. We conclude that the recruitment of the ILK·PINCH·α-parvin complex to membrane adhesion complexes is required to initiate cytoskeletal processes required for tension development in smooth muscle.

We conclude that the recruitment of the ILK·PINCH·α-parvin complex to membrane adhesion complexes is required to initiate cytoskeletal processes required for tension development in smooth muscle. Smooth muscle tissues from hollow organs are subjected to large changes in shape and volume under physiologic conditions in vivo. When subjected to external mechanical forces, the muscle must rapidly adapt its compliance and contractility to accommodate to changes in external mechanical forces. External forces that are imposed on smooth muscle tissues are transmitted to the interior of the cells via adhesion complexes, which link the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. Transmembrane integrins, which are ligands for extracellular matrix proteins, can mediate the transduction of mechanical signals from the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton (1Brakebusch C.

Furthermore, the inhibition of actin polymerization or cytoskeletal reorganization can inhibit tension development in the absence of an effect on myosin light chain phosphorylation (7Mehta D.

The actin nucleating protein, N-WASp, regulates the initiation of actin polymerization in tracheal smooth muscle during contractile activation (9Zhang W. Wu Y. Du L. Tang D.D. Gunst S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: C1145-C1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In tracheal smooth muscle, N-WASp activation can be regulated by phosphorylation of the adhesion complex protein, paxillin, which couples the SH2/SH3 adaptor protein CrkII to N-WASp to catalyze its activation by the small GTPase cdc42 (8Tang D.D.

However, the mechanisms by which external signals mediated by integrin receptors are coupled to the cytoskeletal signaling pathways that regulate actin polymerization and cytoskeletal dynamics are not known. Integrins are linked to the actin cytoskeleton via macromolecular protein complexes that interact with the cytoplasmic domains of integrin proteins and with actin filaments. These complexes are composed of adaptor and structural proteins as well as proteins with enzymatic activity. Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) 2The abbreviations used are: ILK, integrin-linked kinase; PSS, physiological saline solution; TES, N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescence protein; ACh, acetylcholine; WT, wild type; MLC, myosin light chain; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. 2The abbreviations used are: ILK, integrin-linked kinase; PSS, physiological saline solution; TES, N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescence protein; ACh, acetylcholine; WT, wild type; MLC, myosin light chain; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. is a multidomain protein that binds directly to the cytoplasmic domain of β1 integrins and serves as a scaffolding protein for the organization of cytoskeletal signaling proteins at adhesion complexes (21Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M.G. Radeva G. Filmus J. Bell J.C. Dedhar S. Nature. 1996; 379: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). ILK forms a heterotrimeric complex with the adaptor protein PINCH, an adaptor protein that consists of a tandem array of 5 LIM domains, and α-parvin (also known as actopaxin and CH-ILKBP) (22Attwell S. Mills J. Troussard A. Wu C. Dedhar S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4813-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 23Wu C. Dedhar S. J.

The N-terminal ankyrin domain of ILK binds to the N-terminal LIM domain of PINCH, and the C-terminal domain of ILK binds to α-parvin, which binds to actin filaments (25Tu Y. Huang Y. Zhang Y. Hua Y.

Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 460-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). ILK and its binding partners are thus positioned to coordinate signaling pathways that regulate cytoskeletal functions and the organization of structural links between integrin proteins and the actin cytoskeleton (22Attwell S. Mills J. Troussard A. Wu C. Dedhar S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4813-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 32Zervas C.G. Gregory S.L. Brown N.H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1007-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that ILK may play a pivotal role in the regulation of actin polymerization and cytoskeletal dynamics during contractile activation and tension generation in tracheal smooth muscle. To evaluate the role of ILK in these processes, we inhibited the recruitment of ILK to integrin complexes by expressing a truncated N-terminal fragment of PINCH (PINCH LIM1-2) in tracheal smooth muscle tissues. PINCH LIM1-2 contains only the first 2 LIM domains and competes with endogenous PINCH for binding to ILK, thereby disrupting the recruitment of ILK to integrin adhesion sites (33Wu C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4485-4489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that the contractile activation of tracheal smooth muscle stimulates the recruitment of the ILK·PINCH complex to membrane adhesion complexes and increases its interaction with β1 integrins and other adhesion complex proteins. We find that the assembly of the ILK protein complex at membrane adhesion sites in tracheal smooth muscle tissues is critical for the regulation of N-WASp-mediated actin polymerization and tension development during contractile activation. Our findings suggest that integrin-linked kinase is an important mediator of signals from integrin receptors to downstream pathways that regulate actin polymerization and cytoskeletal organization in smooth muscle during contractile stimulation.

Solutions 1-3 were maintained at pH 7.1 and aerated with 100% O2. Solution 4 was maintained at pH 7.4 and aerated with 95% O2, 5% CO2. After 30 min in Solution 4, CaCl2 was added gradually to reach a final concentration of 2.4 mm. The strips were then incubated in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 2 days in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5 mm Na2ATP, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10 μg/ml plasmids.

The strips were then placed in a 37 °C shaking water bath at 80 oscillations/min for 20-30 min, followed by washing three times with a HEPES-buffered saline solution (in mm: 130 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1.0 CaCl2, 1.0 MgCl2, 20 HEPES, and 10 d-glucose, pH 7.4) and trituration with a pipette to liberate individual smooth muscle cells from the tissue. Live freshly dissociated cells were plated onto glass coverslips and allowed to adhere for 30-120 min before visualization. The localization of GFP-labeled ILK and PINCH was monitored in live cells by scanning them once/s for 60 s using a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope with an Apo ×40 (NA 1.2) water immersion objective. EGFP was excited with a 488-nm argon laser light, and fluorescence emissions were collected at 500-530 nm. The optical pinhole was set to resolve optical sections of ∼1 μm in cell thickness. Contraction was stimulated by adding acetylcholine (ACh) to the PSS bathing the cell on the coverslip to achieve a concentration of 100 μm. Analysis of Protein Localization by Immunofluorescence—The effects of ACh stimulation on the localization of endogenous and recombinant cytoskeletal proteins was evaluated in freshly dissociated smooth muscle cells (9Zhang W.

The dissociated smooth muscle cells were stimulated with 10−4 m ACh or left unstimulated, fixed, and reacted with primary antibodies specific for the proteins of interest (ILK, PINCH, paxillin, and N-WASp) and with secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 546). The cellular localization of fluorescently labeled proteins was determined using a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope. Image Analysis—Images of smooth muscle cells were analyzed for regional differences in fluorescence intensity of labeled proteins by quantifying the pixel intensity with a series of six cross-sectional line scans along the entire length of each cell as previously described (9Zhang W. Wu Y. Du L. Tang D.D. Gunst S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: C1145-C1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 10Zhang W. Gunst S.J. J.

Physiol. 2004; 286: C433-C447Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The area of the nucleus was excluded from the analysis. The ratio of pixel intensity between the cell periphery and the cell interior was computed for each line scan by calculating the ratio of the average maximum pixel intensity at the cell periphery to the average minimum pixel intensity in the cell interior. The ratios of pixel intensities between the cell periphery and the cell interior for all of the six line scans performed on a given cell were averaged to obtain a single value for the ratio for each cell. The ratio of fluorescence intensity at the cell periphery to that at the cell interior was compared in cells at rest and in cells stimulated with ACh (10−4 m). Immunoprecipitation of Proteins—Pulverized muscle tissues were mixed with extraction buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 0.3% NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, phosphatase inhibitors (in mm: 2 sodium orthovanadate, 2 molybdate, and 2 sodium pyrophosphate), and protease inhibitors (in mm: 2 benzamidine, 0.5 aprotinin, and 1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Each sample was centrifuged (14,000 × g) for the collection of supernatant. Muscle extracts containing equal amounts of protein were precleared for 30 min with 50 μl of 10% protein A-Sepharose and then incubated overnight with primary antibodies. Samples were then incubated for 2 h with 125 μl of a 10% suspension of protein A-Sepharose beads. Immunocomplexes were washed three times in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100. All procedures of immunoprecipitation were performed at 4 °C. Measurement of Intracellular Ca2+ Concentration—Tracheal smooth muscle strips were pinned in a dish at a slightly stretched length (1.2 times slack length) and incubated in PSS containing 20 μm fura 2-AM, which was dissolved in 0.5% Me2SO premixed with 0.01% Pluronic 127 for 3.5 h at room temperature. They were then washed in PSS for 30 min to remove extracellular fura 2-AM and allowed time for the hydrolytic conversion of intracellular fura 2-AM to fura 2. Tissues were mounted in a cuvette and attached to a force transducer for the simultaneous measurement of force and fura-2 fluorescence using a ratio fluorescence spectrophotometer (system model C-14, Photon Technology International). The muscle was illuminated alternately at excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm at a frequency of 2 Hz. Emitted light was collected through a single long-pass filter (510 nm) and detected with a photomultiplier tube. The ratio of fluorescence at 340 nm to fluorescence at 380 nm was continuously computed by a dedicated computer. Measurement of Myosin Light Chain (MLC) Phosphorylation—Frozen muscle strips were immersed in dry ice precooled acetone containing 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and 10 mm dithiothreitol. Proteins were extracted in 8 m urea, 20 mm Tris base, 22 mm glycine, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. Phosphorylated and unphosphorylated myosin lights chains were separated by glycerol-urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, then immunoblotted for proteins of MLC (9Zhang W. Wu Y. Du L. Tang D.D. Gunst S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: C1145-C1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 10Zhang W. Gunst S.J. J. Physiol. 2006; 572: 659-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The ratio of phosphorylated to unphosphorylated MLCs was determined by scanning densitometry. Analysis of F-actin and G-actin—The relative proportions of F-actin and G-actin in smooth muscle tissues were analyzed using an assay kit from Cytoskeleton (Denver, CO) as previously described (9Zhang W. Wu Y. Du L. Tang D.D. Gunst S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: C1145-C1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 10Zhang W. Gunst S.J. J. Physiol. 2006; 572: 659-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, each of the tracheal smooth muscle strips was homogenized in 200 μl of F-actin stabilization buffer (50 mm PIPES, pH 6.9, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.001% antifoam, 1 mm ATP, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, and 500 μg/ml tosyl arginine methyl ester). Supernatants of the protein extracts were collected after centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 60 min at 37 °C. The pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of ice-cold distilled water containing 10 μm cytochalasin D and then incubated on ice for 1 h to depolymerize F-actin. The resuspended pellets were gently mixed every 15 min. Four microliters of supernatant (G-actin) and pellet (F-actin) fractions were subjected to immunoblot analysis using antiactin antibody (clone AC-40; Sigma). The ratios of F-actin to G-actin were determined using densitometry. Endogenous ILK and PINCH Are Recruited to the Cell Membrane during Contractile Stimulation of Smooth Muscle with ACh—The effect of stimulation with acetylcholine (ACh) on the cellular localization of endogenous ILK and PINCH was evaluated in smooth muscle cells freshly dissociated from intact tissues. Freshly dissociated cells were plated onto glass coverslips, stimulated with 10−4 m ACh or left unstimulated, then fixed and stained for immunofluorescence analysis of the distribution of ILK and PINCH (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 shows 4 optical sections from an unstimulated smooth muscle cell and from a stimulated smooth muscle cell, each double stained for ILK and PINCH. Optical sections are shown at the top, bottom, and 2 midsections of the cell. The distribution of ILK was evaluated in midsections of the cell, where a striking difference in the distribution of ILK and PINCH can be seen in unstimulated and ACh-stimulated cells. In cells that were stimulated with ACh, the fluorescence intensity of both ILK and PINCH along the cell membrane relative to the interior was more marked than in the unstimulated cell (Fig. 1A). The cellular distribution of ILK and PINCH was quantified using line scans across a mid-level optical section of each cell as previously described (9Zhang W. Wu Y. Du L. Tang D.D. Gunst S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: C1145-C1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 10Zhang W. Gunst S.J. J. Physiol. 2006; 572: 659-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 16Opazo-Saez A. Zhang W. Wu Y. Turner C.E. Tang D.D. Gunst S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C433-C447Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Examples of a single profile of pixel intensity from one line scan on each cell are shown in Fig. 1A. In unstimulated cells (n = 32), the ratio of the fluorescence intensity between the cell periphery to the cell interior for both ILK and PINCH was ∼1.3, indicating a higher fluorescence of both proteins at the membrane of the cell relative to the interior. In cells stimulated with ACh (n = 32), the fluorescence intensity ratio rose to about 3 for both ILK and PINCH, suggesting that contractile stimulation with ACh leads to the recruitment of endogenous ILK and PINCH to the membrane of smooth muscle cells. The Stimulation of Freshly Dissociated Tracheal Smooth Muscle Cells with ACh Causes the Rapid Recruitment of GFP-ILK and GFP-PINCH to the Cell Periphery—GFP-ILK and GFP-PINCH were expressed in tracheal smooth muscle tissues to monitor the localization of ILK and PINCH during contractile stimulation. Cells were then enzymatically dissociated from the tissues and evaluated by confocal fluorescence microscopy. As observed previously for other proteins, GFP-ILK or GFP-PINCH fluorescence was observed in ∼90% of the dissociated cells (9Zhang W. Wu Y. Du L. Tang D.D. Gunst S.J. Am. J.

https://openalex.org/W1977760077,"Previous theoretical work has suggested that females should prefer to mate with older males, as older males should have higher fitness than the average fitness of the cohort into which they were born. However, studies in humans and model organisms have shown that as males age, they accumulate deleterious mutations in their germ-line at an ever-increasing rate, thereby reducing the quality of genes passed on to the next generation. Thus, older males may produce relatively poor-quality offspring. To better understand how male age influences female mate preference and offspring quality, we used a genetic algorithm model to study the effect of age-related increases in male genetic load on female mate preference. When we incorporate age-related increases in mutation load in males into our model, we find that females evolve a preference for younger males. Females in this model could determine a male's age, but not his inherited genotype nor his mutation load. Nevertheless, females evolved age-preferences that led them to mate with males that had low mutation loads, but showed no preference for males with respect to their somatic quality. These results suggest that germ-line quality, rather than somatic quality, should be the focus of female preference in good genes models."
https://openalex.org/W2004216064,"It is known that some blood-sucking insects have the ability to reach vessels under the host skin with their mouthparts to feed blood from inside them. However, the process by which they locate these vessels remains largely unknown. Less than 5% of the skin is occupied by blood vessels and thus, it is not likely that insects rely on a ""random search strategy"", since it would increase the probability of being killed by their hosts. Indeed, heterogeneities along the skin surface might offer exploitable information for guiding insect's bites.We tested whether the bug Rhodnius prolixus can evaluate temperature discontinuities along the body surface in order to locate vessels before piercing the host skin. When placed over a rabbit ear, the bug's first bites were mostly directed towards the main vessels. When insects were confronted to artificial linear heat sources presenting a temperature gradient against the background, most bites were directly addressed to the warmer linear source, notwithstanding the temperature of both, the source and the background. Finally, tests performed using uni- and bilaterally antennectomized insects revealed that the bilateral integration of thermal inputs from both antennae is necessary for precisely directing bites.R. prolixus may be able to exploit the temperature differences observed over the skin surface to locate blood vessles. Bugs bite the warmest targets regardless of the target/background temperatures, suggesting that they do not bite choosing a preferred temperature, but select temperature discontinuities along the skin. This strategy seems to be an efficient one for finding blood vessels within a wide temperature range, allowing finding them on different hosts, as well as on different areas of the host body. Our study also adds new insight about the use of antennal thermal inputs by blood sucking bugs."
https://openalex.org/W2034695923,"Francisella tularensis is the causative agent of tularemia, which is a highly lethal disease from nature and potentially from a biological weapon. This species contains four recognized subspecies including the North American endemic F. tularensis subsp. tularensis (type A), whose genetic diversity is correlated with its geographic distribution including a major population subdivision referred to as A.I and A.II. The biological significance of the A.I - A.II genetic differentiation is unknown, though there are suggestive ecological and epidemiological correlations. In order to understand the differentiation at the genomic level, we have determined the complete sequence of an A.II strain (WY96-3418) and compared it to the genome of Schu S4 from the A.I population. We find that this A.II genome is 1,898,476 bp in size with 1,820 genes, 1,303 of which code for proteins. While extensive genomic variation exists between ""WY96"" and Schu S4, there is only one whole gene difference. This one gene difference is a hypothetical protein of unknown function. In contrast, there are numerous SNPs (3,367), small indels (1,015), IS element differences (7) and large chromosomal rearrangements (31), including both inversions and translocations. The rearrangement borders are frequently associated with IS elements, which would facilitate intragenomic recombination events. The pathogenicity island duplicated regions (DR1 and DR2) are essentially identical in WY96 but vary relative to Schu S4 at 60 nucleotide positions. Other potential virulence-associated genes (231) varied at 559 nucleotide positions, including 357 non-synonymous changes. Molecular clock estimates for the divergence time between A.I and A.II genomes for different chromosomal regions ranged from 866 to 2131 years before present. This paper is the first complete genomic characterization of a member of the A.II clade of Francisella tularensis subsp. tularensis."
https://openalex.org/W2011575793,"Background The serine/threonine kinase Aurora-A (Aur-A) is a proto-oncoprotein overexpressed in a wide range of human cancers. Overexpression of Aur-A is thought to be caused by gene amplification or mRNA overexpression. However, recent evidence revealed that the discrepancies between amplification of Aur-A and overexpression rates of Aur-A mRNA were observed in breast cancer, gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and ovarian cancer. We found that aggressive head and neck cancers exhibited overexpression and stabilization of Aur-A protein without gene amplification or mRNA overexpression. Here we tested the hypothesis that aberration of the protein destruction system induces accumulation and consequently overexpression of Aur-A in cancer. Principal Findings Aur-A protein was ubiquitinylated by APCCdh1 and consequently degraded when cells exited mitosis, and phosphorylation of Aur-A on Ser51 was observed during mitosis. Phosphorylation of Aur-A on Ser51 inhibited its APCCdh1-mediated ubiquitylation and consequent degradation. Interestingly, constitutive phosphorylation on Ser51 was observed in head and neck cancer cells with protein overexpression and stabilization. Indeed, phosphorylation on Ser51 was observed in head and neck cancer tissues with Aur-A protein overexpression. Moreover, an Aur-A Ser51 phospho-mimetic mutant displayed stabilization of protein during cell cycle progression and enhanced ability to cell transformation. Conclusions/Significance Broadly, this study identifies a new mode of Aur-A overexpression in cancer through phosphorylation-dependent inhibition of its proteolysis in addition to gene amplification and mRNA overexpression. We suggest that the inhibition of Aur-A phosphorylation can represent a novel way to decrease Aur-A levels in cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2040141159,"Stress conditions inhibit mRNA export, but mRNAs encoding heat shock proteins continue to be efficiently exported from the nucleus during stress. How HSP mRNAs bypass this stress-associated export inhibition was not known. Here, we show that HSF1, the transcription factor that binds HSP promoters after stress to induce their transcription, interacts with the nuclear pore-associating TPR protein in a stress-responsive manner. TPR is brought into proximity of the HSP70 promoter after stress and preferentially associates with mRNAs transcribed from this promoter. Disruption of the HSF1-TPR interaction inhibits the export of mRNAs expressed from the HSP70 promoter, both endogenous HSP70 mRNA and a luciferase reporter mRNA. These results suggest that HSP mRNA export escapes stress inhibition via HSF1-mediated recruitment of the nuclear pore-associating protein TPR to HSP genes, thereby functionally connecting the first and last nuclear steps of the gene expression pathway, transcription and mRNA export.

The up-regulation of heat shock proteins such as HSP70 that occurs in response to exposure to elevated temperature and many other stress conditions is vital for the ability of cells to survive these stresses. Because of their crucial cytoprotective function, it is very important that up-regulation of HSP expression after stress occur as rapidly and as efficiently as possible. An intriguing finding of past studies is that stress conditions inhibit the export of many mRNAs from the nucleus, but mRNAs encoding heat shock proteins continue to be efficiently exported during stress (1Sadis S.

However, the mechanism by which HSP mRNAs bypass this stress-associated export inhibition was not known. HSF1 is the transcription factor responsible for up-regulating transcription of HSP70 and other genes in response to elevated temperature and other stress conditions. HSF1 performs this function by undergoing stress-induced trimerization to the DNA-binding form and then interacting with heat shock elements in the promoters of these genes to increase their transcription (8Voellmy R.

During the course of yeast two-hybrid experiments in our laboratory, we identified the existence of an interaction between HSF1 and the TPR protein. The results presented here suggest that the HSF1-TPR interaction could be important for the export of HSP mRNAs during stress conditions. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—The interactions between pGBD-HSF1 and pVP16-TPR-(14–117) and pVP16-TPR-(1218–1320) were characterized by streaking yeast (strain pJ694A) containing these constructs or pGBD-HSF1 bait and empty pVP16 plasmid (as a negative control) on plates lacking tryptophan and leucine; tryptophan, leucine, and histidine; or tryptophan, leucine, and alanine. In Vitro Binding Assay—In vitro translated 35S-labeled TPR-(14–117) or TPR-(1218–1320) was incubated with GST 5The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathione S-transferase; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; RSV, Rous sarcoma virus; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation assay. -HSF1 and GST bound to glutathione-agarose. After washing, bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography to detect the 35S-labeled TPR proteins. The amounts of GST-HSF1 and GST proteins bound to the beads were determined by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using goat anti-GST polyclonal antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation Analysis—HeLa cells (American Type Culture Collection) were heat-shocked at 42 °C for 1 h, and extracts of these cells were then subjected to immunoprecipitation using rabbit anti-HSF1 polyclonal antibody (21Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar) or rabbit nonspecific IgG followed by Western blotting using mouse anti-TPR monoclonal antibody (Oncogene Research Products). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—ChIP assays were performed with Jurkat cells as described previously (22Xing H. Wilkerson D.C. Mayhew C.N. Lubert E.J. Skaggs H.S. Goodson M.L. Hong Y. Park-Sarge O.K. Sarge K.D. Science. 2005; 307: 421-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) using mouse anti-TPR monoclonal antibody and mouse nonspecific IgG (as a negative control). The primers used to amplify the promoter regions of the stress-inducible HSP70i gene and histone H4 gene were as follows: HSP70i, 5′-ctcagggtccctgtccc-3′ and 5′-tgagccaatcaccgagc-3′; and histone H4, 5′-gagagggcggggacaattga-3′ and 5′-ttggcgtgctcggtgtaggt-3′. PCR products were then separated on polyacrylamide gels and stained with ethidium bromide. ChIP samples were also analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR as described below. HSP mRNA Export Analysis—pEGFP-TPR-(14–117) and pEGFP-TPR-(1218–1320) were generated using a PCR-based strategy to amplify the relevant regions while adding restriction sites to each end to allow ligation into the pEGFP-C2 vector. Cloning junctions were checked by sequencing. One μg of each plasmid or empty vector was cotransfected with either the HSP70i-luciferase (luciferase expressed from the stress-inducible human HSP70i promoter) (21Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar) or RSV-luciferase plasmid using Effectene (Qiagen Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. The RSV-luciferase plasmid was a kind gift of Dr. Dan Noonan and was generated by replacing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase coding sequence from the RSV-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase plasmid (23Giguere V. Hollenberg S.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Evans R.M. Cell. 1986; 46: 645-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar) with the luciferase coding sequence. Cells were heat-shocked at 42 °C for 1 h, and cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were then prepared by hypotonic lysis as follows. Cells were swollen in 5 packed cell volumes of 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Buffer A) for 10 min on ice. Cells were then centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min, resuspended in 2 packed cell volumes of Buffer A, and lysed by 20 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer (type B pestle). The nuclei and cytoplasm were separated by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 10 min. Separation was verified by viewing fractions with a microscope. mRNA was extracted from each fraction using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. To analyze mRNA concentrations, each pool was subjected to an RNase protection assay using SuperSignal RPA III (Ambion, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions with a probe for either luciferase or L32 ribosomal protein mRNA. The probe for luciferase mRNA was constructed via in vitro transcription using MAXIscript (Ambion, Inc.) and biotinylated UTP (Roche Applied Science). The template for in vitro transcription was created by PCR with the HSP70-luciferase plasmid and primers 5′-cacggaaagacgatgacg-3′ and 5′-taatacgactcactataggttgggtaacgccaggg-3′. This PCR product contained the 3′-end of the luciferase mRNA, ending with the polyadenylation signal (yielding a protected fragment of 325 bp) and untranscribed vector sequence (resulting in an unprotected fragment of 438 bb). The construction of the L32 probe was described previously (24Hobbs M.V. Weigle W.O. Noonan D.J. Torbett B.E. McEvilly R.J. Koch R.J. Cardenas G.J Ernst D.N. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3602-3614PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether expression of the two HSF1-binding regions of TPR affects endogenous HSP70 mRNA levels, GFP-TPR-(14–117) and GFP-TPR-(1218–1320) or empty vector were transfected into HeLa cells according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were heat-shocked and fractionated as described above. Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol according to the manufacturer's instruction. RNA was resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm CaCl2 and incubated with RNase-free DNase I to remove possible genomic contamination. cDNA was prepared from samples using ImProm-II reverse transcriptase (Promega Corp.) and oligo(dT)16 primers. cDNA samples were assayed by quantitative real-time PCR as described below. RNA Immunoprecipitation Analysis—HeLa cells (1.5 × 106) were transfected with 2 μg of either the HSP70i-luciferase or RSV-luciferase plasmid using Effectene following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were then heat-shocked for 1 h at 42 °C, washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and cross-linked with 2% paraformaldehyde for 12 min while rotating. Cross-linking was quenched with 125 mm glycine for 5 min; and cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested by scraping, and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cells were resuspended in 2 ml of low stringency radioimmune precipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.05% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and 80 units of RNaseOUT (Invitrogen)), pipetted 20 times, and incubated on ice for 10 min. Cells were then sonicated three times (80–90% output) for 20 s and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was precleared with 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) and washed with low stringency RIPA buffer and 100 μg/ml yeast tRNA (Ambion, Inc.) for 2 h at 4 °C. During the preclearing, the low stringency RIPA buffer-washed protein G-Sepharose beads were coated with 5 μg of either anti-TPR antibody or mouse IgG (Sigma) in low stringency RIPA buffer. The precleared supernatant was then incubated with the antibody-coated beads for 90 min at 4 °C with rotation. Complexes were washed five times for 10 min each at room temperature with 1 ml of high stringency RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 1 m NaCl, 1 m urea, and 0.2 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Beads were then resuspended in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% SDS, and cross-links were reversed for 1 h at 70 °C. mRNA was isolated as described above, and samples were analyzed by quantitative PCR as described below. Quantitative Real-time PCR—This was performed with the Mx4000 system (Stratagene) using Brilliant SYBR Green QPCR Master Mix (Stratagene). Samples were checked for specific amplification using dissociation curve analysis included with the software. PCR products were also assayed on polyacrylamide gels with ethidium bromide staining to ensure that they were of the expected size. For quantitative PCR analysis of the TPR-HSP70 promoter ChIP assay, the primers used were as follows: HSP70, 5′-caacacccttcccaccgccactc-3′ and 5′-ctgattggtccaaggaaggctgg-3′; and histone H4, 5′-gagagggcggggacaattga-3′ and 5′-ggtcatgtccggctgtggaaag-3′. The Ct values were normalized to input DNA (DNA before the immunoprecipitation step) and IgG controls. Data are represented as -fold differences above mouse control IgG relative to input DNA using the formula 2((Ct(IgG)–Ct(Input))–(Ct(TPR)–Ct(Input))). For the experiments analyzing luciferase cDNA, primers used for quantitative PCR analysis were 5′-gtctgaattccagtcgatgtacacgttcg-3′ and 5′-cacgaagcttgcatgcgagaactccacgc-3′. The Ct values were normalized to input cDNA (cDNA made from total RNA before the immunoprecipitation step) and IgG controls, which were set as 1 unit. Data are represented as -fold differences relative to these two values using the formula 2((Ct(IgG)–Ct(Input))–(Ct(TPR)–Ct(Input))). For experiments analyzing endogenous HSP70 mRNA levels, the following primers were used: human HSP70, 5′-caccttgccgtgttgga-3′ and 5′-ttctcgcggatccagtg-3′; and human L32, 5′-catctccttctcggcatca-3′ and 5′-aaccctgttgtcaatgcctc-3′. The data presented represent two independent experiments in which values obtained utilizing the formula 2–ΔΔCt were averaged. The results are graphed as relative differences between cytoplasmic and nuclear HSP70 mRNA levels compared with the control samples (GFP alone), which were set to a value of 1. To further the understanding of the regulation and function of HSF1, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using the HSF1 protein as a bait. Two of the interacting clones that were obtained from this screen represented two different regions of the TPR protein. One of the HSF1-interacting regions of TPR identified by the yeast two-hybrid screen comprises a sequence near the N terminus (amino acids 14–117), whereas the other is located close to the middle of the protein (amino acids 1218–1320) (Fig. 1, A and B). As an independent test of the interaction between HSF1 and these two regions of TPR and to determine whether the interaction is direct, in vitro binding experiments were performed in which in vitro translated 35S-labeled TPR-(14–117) and TPR-(1218–1320) were incubated with GST-HSF1 or GST bound to glutathione-agarose beads. The results confirmed the ability of both regions of TPR to interact with HSF1 (Fig. 1C). To determine whether endogenous HSF1 and TPR proteins interact and, if so, whether the interaction between these proteins is regulated in a stress-dependent manner, immunoprecipitation analysis was performed using extracts of cells kept at 37 °C or cells subjected to heat stress at 42 °C for 1 h. Fig. 2 shows that endogenous HSF1 and TPR did associate and that more HSF1-TPR complex was observed in extracts of stressed cells compared with non-stressed cells. In multicellular eukaryotes, HSF1 binds to heat shock gene promoters in response to stress conditions. Therefore, the data presented in Fig. 2 indicating that HSF1 interacts with TPR in a stress-induced manner prompted the question of whether TPR might also associate with the promoter of the stress-inducible HSP70 gene when cells are exposed to stress. We tested this hypothesis using the ChIP assay. The results demonstrate that a low level of TPR association was detected within cross-linking distance of the HSP70 promoter in cells kept at 37 °C and that a higher level of TPR was associated with the HSP70 promoter in cells that were subjected to stress treatment at 42 °C for 1 h (Fig. 3A, upper panels). TPR was not found to associate with the promoter region of the histone H4 gene, indicating the specificity of its HSP70 promoter association (Fig. 3A, lower panels). As a complementary approach, we repeated this experiment and used quantitative real-time PCR for the analysis. The results (Fig. 3B) are consistent with the finding of increased association between TPR and the HSP70 promoter in response to exposure to stress conditions. On the basis of previous results indicating a role for TPR in mRNA export (13Bangs P. Burke B. Powers C. Craig R. Purohit A. Doxsey S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1801-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 18Vinciguerra P. Iglesias N. Camblong J. Zenklusen D. Stutz F.

A. 2003; 100: 1010-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), including the finding that the yeast TPR ortholog Mlp1p interacts with the mRNA export heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein Nab2p (19Green D.M. Johnson C.P. Hagan H. Corbett A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1010-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the recruitment of TPR to the HSP70 promoter might function as a way to specifically promote association between TPR and the stress-induced transcripts that arise from this gene. We tested this hypothesis using an RNA immunoprecipitation approach. In this experiment, HeLa cells were transfected with expression constructs in which the luciferase gene is transcribed from either the stress-inducible human HSP70 gene promoter or the RSV promoter. The transfected cells were subjected to 1 h of heat shock treatment (42 °C), after which they were incubated with the chemical cross-linking agent paraformaldehyde, and extracts of these cells were then immunoprecipitated using anti-TPR antibody. RNA isolated from the TPR-containing complexes was reverse-transcribed into cDNAs, which were then analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR using a luciferase primer pair. The results of this experiment (Fig. 4) indicate that significantly more luciferase mRNA transcripts generated from the HSP70 promoter were associated with the TPR protein compared with luciferase mRNAs transcribed from the RSV promoter. The results described above indicate that stress conditions result in increased interaction between HSF1 and TPR, increased association of TPR with the HSP70 promoter, and the preferential association of TPR with mRNAs arising from transcription from the HSP70 promoter. In light of the data suggesting a role for TPR in mRNA export (13Bangs P. Burke B. Powers C. Craig R. Purohit A. Doxsey S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1801-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 18Vinciguerra P. Iglesias N. Camblong J. Zenklusen D. Stutz F.

A. 2003; 100: 1010-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that these events could be part of a mechanism for specifically enhancing the export of mRNAs transcribed from heat shock gene promoters. To test this hypothesis, we sought to determine whether export of the HSP70 promoter-driven luciferase mRNAs described above is affected by cotransfecting the cells with expression constructs encoding the two regions of the TPR protein (amino acids 14–117 and 1218–1320) that were shown by our data to interact with HSF1 (Fig. 1). We reasoned that if HSF1-TPR interaction is important for export of mRNAs expressed from HSP gene promoters, then expressing either of these two HSF1-binding regions of TPR could inhibit export of these mRNAs expressed from HSP gene promoters by decreasing the ability of HSF1 and TPR to associate. Fig. 5A shows that both GFP fusion constructs were expressed at levels similar to that of GFP alone. Fluorescence microscopy analysis of cells transfected with these constructs revealed that a significant proportion of each GFP-TPR fragment fusion construct was found in the nuclei of these cells, where they would need to be to exert their effects in this experiment (supplemental Fig. S1). Co-immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that transfection of the GFP-TPR-(14–117) and GFP-TPR-(1218–1320) constructs, but not the GFP expression construct, resulted in decreased levels of the HSF1-TPR complex in stressed cells (Fig. 5B). Next, cells were cotransfected with the GFP-TPR-(14–117), GFP-TPR-(1218–1320), or GFP-alone construct along with the construct containing luciferase expressed from either the HSP70 promoter or the RSV promoter (non-heat shock element-containing) and subjected to heat shock treatment at 42 °C for 60 min, and mRNA from the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of these cells was then analyzed by RNase protection assay using a probe that detects luciferase mRNA or mRNA encoding the L32 ribosomal protein (as a control). The results indicate that cells transfected with GFP-TPR-(14–117) or GFP-TPR-(1218–1320) exhibited a decrease in the cytoplasmic levels of luciferase mRNA expressed from the heat shock element-containing HSP70 promoter compared with cells transfected with GFP (Fig. 5C, upper panels). Transfection of GFP-TPR-(14–117) or GFP-TPR-(1218–1320) did not change the nuclear versus cytoplasmic levels of luciferase mRNA expressed from the non-heat shock element-containing RSV promoter compared with transfection of GFP alone, indicating the HSP70 promoter selectivity of the effect (Fig. 5C, lower panels). Finally, to test whether expression of these two regions of the TPR protein is able to inhibit export of endogenous HSP70i mRNAs, we performed an experiment similar to the one shown in Fig. 5D, except that the cells were transfected with only the GFP-TPR-(14–117), GFP-TPR-(1218–1320), or GFP expression construct (no luciferase reporter constructs). After subjecting the transfected cells to heat shock treatment at 42 °C for 60 min, mRNA from the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of these cells was reverse-transcribed and then analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR using primers that amplify the HSP70i sequence or the L32 sequence (normalizing control). The results of this experiment (Fig. 5D) are presented graphically as the relative levels of endogenous HSP70 mRNA in the nucleus or cytoplasm, normalized for L32 mRNA levels, compared with the results for the control cells (transfected with GFP alone), which were set to a value of 1. The results indicate that the export of endogenous HSP70i mRNA, like that of the heat shock element-driven luciferase mRNAs above, was decreased in cells transfected with GFP-TPR-(14–117) or GFP-TPR-(1218–1320) compared with cells transfected with GFP (Fig. 5D). The results presented in this work indicate that, in response to stress, the TPR protein interacts with the stress gene transcriptional regulator HSF1, is recruited to the HSP70 promoter region, and preferentially associates with mRNAs transcribed from this promoter compared with those expressed from a non-stress-induced promoter and that the HSF1-TPR interaction is required for efficient export of HSP mRNAs from the nucleus during stress. The association of TPR with these mRNAs may be assisted by its interaction with mRNA-binding heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins such as Nab2p (19Green D.M. Johnson C.P. Hagan H. Corbett A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1010-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The TPR protein is known to be able to form homodimers (25Hase M.E. Kuznetsov N.V. Cordes V.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2433-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, once it is complexed with HSP mRNAs, TPR could facilitate their export by docking with TPR found at the nucleoplasmic face of nuclear pore complexes (10Cordes V.C. Reidenbach S. Rackwitz H.R.

These results reveal the existence of a direct functional connection between the first and last nuclear steps in the gene expression pathway, transcription and export of mRNAs from the nucleus. The HSF1-TPR interaction and its downstream events could serve as a mechanism for bypassing the inhibition of mRNA export that occurs in response to stress and/or to increase the kinetics of export of HSP mRNAs so that cells can express these crucial cytoprotective proteins as soon as possible. One intriguing question for future studies is whether the TPR protein is recruited to other genes to aid in the export of their mRNAs from the nucleus.

https://openalex.org/W2145794389,"Conflict within mutually beneficial associations is predicted to destabilize relationships, and theoretical and empirical work exploring this has provided significant insight into the dynamics of cooperative interactions. Within mutualistic associations, the expression and regulation of conflict is likely more complex than in intraspecific cooperative relationship, because of the potential presence of: i) multiple genotypes of microbial species associated with individual hosts, ii) multiple species of symbiotic lineages forming cooperative partner pairings, and iii) additional symbiont lineages. Here we explore complexity of conflict expression within the ancient and coevolved mutualistic association between attine ants, their fungal cultivar, and actinomycetous bacteria (Pseudonocardia). Specifically, we examine conflict between the ants and their Pseudonocardia symbionts maintained to derive antibiotics against parasitic microfungi (Escovopsis) infecting the ants' fungus garden. Symbiont assays pairing isolates of Pseudonocardia spp. associated with fungus-growing ants spanning the phylogenetic diversity of the mutualism revealed that antagonism between strains is common. In contrast, antagonism was substantially less common between more closely related bacteria associated with Acromyrmex leaf-cutting ants. In both experiments, the observed variation in antagonism across pairings was primarily due to the inhibitory capabilities and susceptibility of individual strains, but also the phylogenetic relationships between the ant host of the symbionts, as well as the pair-wise genetic distances between strains. The presence of antagonism throughout the phylogenetic diversity of Pseudonocardia symbionts indicates that these reactions likely have shaped the symbiosis from its origin. Antagonism is expected to prevent novel strains from invading colonies, enforcing single-strain rearing within individual ant colonies. While this may align ant-actinomycete interests in the bipartite association, the presence of single strains of Pseudonocardia within colonies may not be in the best interest of the ants, because increasing the diversity of bacteria, and thereby antibiotic diversity, would help the ant-fungus mutualism deal with the specialized parasites."
https://openalex.org/W2014283464,"Specific protein associations define the wiring of protein interaction networks and thus control the organization and functioning of the cell as a whole. Peptide recognition by PDZ and other protein interaction domains represents one of the best-studied classes of specific protein associations. However, a mechanistic understanding of the relationship between selectivity and promiscuity commonly observed in the interactions mediated by peptide recognition modules as well as its functional meaning remain elusive. To address these questions in a comprehensive manner, two large populations of artificial and natural peptide ligands of six archetypal PDZ domains from the synaptic proteins PSD95 and SAP97 were generated by target-assisted iterative screening (TAIS) of combinatorial peptide libraries and by synthesis of proteomic fragments, correspondingly. A comparative statistical analysis of affinity-ranked artificial and natural ligands yielded a comprehensive picture of known and novel PDZ ligand specificity determinants, revealing a hitherto unappreciated combination of specificity and adaptive plasticity inherent to PDZ domain recognition. We propose a reconceptualization of the PDZ domain in terms of a complex adaptive system representing a flexible compromise between the rigid order of exquisite specificity and the chaos of unselective promiscuity, which has evolved to mediate two mutually contradictory properties required of such higher order sub-cellular organizations as synapses, cell junctions, and others – organizational structure and organizational plasticity/adaptability. The generalization of this reconceptualization in regard to other protein interaction modules and specific protein associations is consistent with the image of the cell as a complex adaptive macromolecular system as opposed to clockwork."

Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The c subunit of the F-ATPase is an 8-kDa protein that contains two transmembrane helices (TMs). The second TM contains a buried acidic amino acid that is critical for proton transport (15Dmitriev O.Y. Jones P.C. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7785-7790Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The F-ATPase c subunits are arranged in a ring. In contrast with the F-ATPase, which contains only a single type of proteolipid subunit, the V-ATPases contain either two or three different proteolipid subunits. In yeast, all three proteolipid subunits have been shown to be essential for activity (14Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Subunits c and c′ have molecular masses around 17 kDa and contain four transmembrane helices. Subunit c″ has a molecular mass of 23 kDa and contains a fifth transmembrane helix at the N terminus (14Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Each proteolipid subunit contains a buried glutamic acid residue critical for proton transport. This critical residue resides in TM4 of subunits c and c′ but in TM3 of subunit c″ (14Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Subunit c″ contains an additional buried glutamic acid residue in TM5, but this residue is not essential for activity. The essential glutamic acid residues in each subunit are thought to undergo reversible protonation and deprotonation during proton transport through the V0 domain. Although evidence from quantitative amino acid analysis suggests that the proteolipid subunits of the V-ATPase form a six-membered ring (16Arai H. Terres G. Pink S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8796-8802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the arrangement of the proteolipids in the ring is not known. The purpose of this study was to determine which of the possible arrangements of the three proteolipid subunits give rise to a functional V-ATPase complex. This was addressed by construction of a series of gene fusions in which pairs of the proteolipid subunits were constrained to adopt a particular orientation. The results suggest that the V-ATPase proteolipid subunits in the functionally assembled complex adopt a unique orientation. Materials—Zymolyase 100T was obtained from Seikagaku America, Inc. Protease inhibitors (leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin), the monoclonal antibody 3F10 (directed against the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) antigen) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, mouse monoclonal antibody 8B1-F3 against the yeast V-ATPase A subunit, and the mouse monoclonal antibody 10D7 against the 100-kDa subunit a were from Invitrogen. Bacterial and yeast culture media were purchased from Difco. Restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase, and other molecular biology reagents were from Invitrogen, Promega, and New England Biolabs. Concanamycin A, ATP, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and most other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Plasmid Construction and Epitope Tagging—We genetically fused the different proteolipid subunits to each other in six different combinations (Fig. 1a). The plasmid pYW3-16 encoding the fusion of c and c″(ΔTM1) was constructed by ligation of plasmid pTN3 containing VMA3 with a PCR product derived from pTN16 encoding a VMA16 lacking amino acids 1–48 but containing a single HA tag at the C terminus. The linker region connecting c and c″(ΔTM1) was 14 amino acids in length and included the C-terminal 6 amino acids of c and amino acids 49–54 of c″ (Fig. 1b). pYW16-3, pYW16-11, pYW11-16, and pYW11-3 were all constructed using the same strategy as pYW3-16 and contained linker regions of 14 amino acids (for the first three) or 10 amino acids (for pYW11-3) (Fig. 1b). pYW16-3, pYW11-16, and pYW11-3 contained single HA tags at the C terminus, whereas pYW16-11 contained three tandem HA tags at the C terminus. Initial attempts to construct a fusion protein containing c followed by c′ using the same strategy failed because of cleavage of the fusion protein in the linker region connecting the two subunits. To solve this problem, the linker region was replaced with the 14-amino acid linker from pYW3-16 (Fig. 1b), which then gave a stable fusion construct. pYW3-11 again contained a single HA tag at the C terminus. For construction of 11-3pRS316, an XhoI and SpeI fragment of pYW11-3 was recloned into pRS316. For construction of 3-16pRS316, an EcoRI and SalI fragment of pYW3-16 was recloned into pRS316. The oligonucleotides used for amplification of fusion genes are as follows: pYW3-11 forward, GTCGGATCCTTCTTGTTAAGGACATCCGCTCCCTTTTTCGGGTTCGC, and pYW3-11 reverse, GAAACTAGTTTAGGCGTAGTCGGGCACGTCGTAGGG; pYW3-16 forward, GTCGGATCCTTCTTGTTAAGGACATCC, and the same reverse primer as pYW3-11; pYW11-3 forward, CGGATTCATGACTGAATTGTGTCCTG, and pYW11-3 reverse, CGGGAATCCTTAGGCGTAGTCGGGCACGTCGTAGGG; pYW16-3 forward, GGGACGCGTACTGAATTGTGTCCTGTC, and the same reverse primer as pYW11-3; pYW16-11 forward, ACGCGTGTCGACATGTCAACGCAACTC, and pYW16-11 reverse, CGGGAATTCTTAGGCGTAGTCGGGCACGTCGTAGGGGTAACAGACAACATCTTGAGT. Strains and Culture Conditions—The yeast strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Tables 1 and 2. HA-tagged forms of each proteolipid subunit (and the c″(ΔTM1) construct) were expressed in the strain in which the corresponding gene was disrupted. All fusion proteins were also HA-tagged. The c-c′ and c′-c fusions were expressed in a strain disrupted in subunit c′ but containing the endogenous copies of subunits c and c″. Similarly, the c-c″ and c″-c fusions were expressed in a strain disrupted in c″ but containing the endogenous copies of subunits c and c′. The c′-c″ and c″-c′ fusions were expressed in a strain disrupted in c′ and c″ but containing the endogenous copy of subunit c. By expressing all fusions in strains containing the wild-type c gene, we could ensure that the requisite number of copies of subunit c to form a functional ring would be present. All yeast strains were cultured in synthetic dropout minimal media supplemented with the appropriate amino acids or YEPD media buffered to pH 5.5 using 50 mm succinate/phosphate. To test for a vma– phenotype, saturated cultures were diluted to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.20. Serial dilutions of the cultures were prepared in YEPD media buffered to pH 7.5, and growth was monitored on YEPD plates buffered to the same pH.TABLE 1Yeast strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSource/Ref.TN101MATa, ura3-52, lys2-801, ade2-101, trp1-Δ63, his3-Δ200, leu2-Δ1, vma3::TRP126Nishi T.

St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 201425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar). The transformants were selected on ura minus plates (for 11-3pRS316 and 3-16pRS316) or histidine minus plates for other strains, and growth phenotypes of the mutants were assessed on YEPD plates buffered with 50 mm KH2PO4 or 50 mm succinic acid to either pH 7.5 or pH 5.5. Protein Preparation, SDS-PAGE, and Immunoblot Analysis—Whole cell lysates were prepared using a modification of the previously described protocol (18Pfeifer K. Arcangioli B. Guarente L. Cell. 1987; 49: 9-18Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar); 5-ml yeast cultures were grown overnight at 30 °C to an absorbance at 600 nm of 1.0. Cells were collected by centrifugation and washed with 1 ml of cold extraction buffer (150 mm ammonium sulfate, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 200 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 2 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors). Cells were resuspended in 200 μl of extraction buffer and vortexed with glass beads five times for 1-min pulses. Unbroken cells were removed by sedimentation for 3 min at 4000 rpm, and samples of the supernatant were collected. Vacuolar membrane vesicles were isolated as described previously (19Uchida E. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1090-1095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whole cell lysates and vacuolar membranes were separated by SDS-PAGE on 4–15% gradient acrylamide gels, as described previously (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Expression of the fusion proteins was analyzed by Western blotting using the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal antibody 3F10 against HA, whereas subunit a and subunit A were detected using the monoclonal antibodies 10D7 and 8B1-F3, respectively, followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, as described previously (21Arata Y. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11301-11307Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 22Arata Y. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3357-3363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Blots were developed using a chemiluminescent detection method obtained from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories. ATPase Activity and ATP-dependent Proton Transport—ATPase activity was measured using a coupled spectrophotometric assay (23Vasilyeva E. Liu Q. MacLeod K.J. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 255-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The reactions were carried out at 30 °C, and vacuolar membrane vesicles were incubated with Me2SO or 1 μm concanamycin A (in Me2SO) for 5 min prior to measurement of ATPase activity. ATP-dependent proton transport was measured by fluorescence quenching with the fluorescence probe 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine in transport buffer (50 mm NaCl, 30 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, 0.2 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol (pH 7.0)) as described (23Vasilyeva E. Liu Q. MacLeod K.J. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 255-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) in the presence or absence of 1 μm concanamycin A. Construction of Proteolipid Fusion Proteins—Previous results from studies of the bovine clathrin-coated vesicle and yeast V-ATPases suggest that the proteolipid ring of the yeast V-ATPase consists of four copies of subunit c and one copy of subunits c′ and c″ (16Arai H. Terres G. Pink S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8796-8802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Powell B. Graham L.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23654-23660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The arrangement of subunits in the proteolipid ring, however, is not known. To determine which arrangements of the subunits in the proteolipid ring are able to give rise to a functional V-ATPase complex, a series of six gene fusions was constructed between pairs of proteolipid subunit genes (Fig. 1a). These fusion constructs were then expressed in the appropriate deletion strains (Tables 1 and 2). By expressing proteolipid subunits as fusion constructs, the resultant oligomer is restricted in the possible arrangements that the proteolipid subunits can adopt. Assuming that each proteolipid subunit inserts in the ring with the same internal arrangement of transmembrane helices (see “Discussion”), there are five possible arrangements of the three proteolipid subunits in a six-membered ring (Fig. 2). In two of these, subunits c′ and c″ are adjacent to each other, either clockwise or counterclockwise relative to each other (models A and B). In two other arrangements, subunits c′ and c″ are separated by a single copy of subunit c (c′ and c″ are again either clockwise or counterclockwise relative to each other, models C and D). In the final arrangement, subunit c′ and c″ are on opposite sides of the six-membered ring separated by two copies of subunit c (model E). Each of these arrangements makes specific predictions about which proteolipid fusions should give rise to a functional V-ATPase (Table 3).TABLE 3Ability of fusion constructs to form proteolipid rings shown in Fig. 2Model AModel BModel CModel DModel EResultc-c′+-+++-c-c″ (ΔTM1)-+++++c′-c-+++++c′-c″ (ΔTM1)+-----c″ (ΔTM1)-c+-+++-c″ (ΔTM1)-c′-+---+ Open table in a new tab Topological studies of the yeast proteolipids suggest that subunit c″ has five transmembrane helices with the N terminus on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, whereas subunits c and c′ both have four transmembrane helices with both the N and C terminus on the luminal side of the membrane (25Flannery A.R. Graham L.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39856-39862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It was therefore necessary to delete TM1 of subunit c″ to ensure that construction of fusion proteins containing subunit c″ at the C terminus did not change the way in which the transmembrane segments of subunit c″ were inserted (Fig. 1a). We and others have shown previously that strains expressing subunit c″ from which TM1 had been deleted still gave rise to a functional V-ATPase complex (25Flannery A.R. Graham L.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39856-39862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 26Nishi T. Kawasaki-Nishi S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5821-5827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thus, c″ (ΔTM1) was used in place of c″ in construction of fusion proteins in this study. Care was taken to define the transmembrane segments as well as the minimal length of the loop connecting the two proteins. We defined the transmembrane helix/connecting loop boundaries of the yeast proteolipids by comparing them to the NtpK subunit of the V-type (Na+)-ATPase from Enterococcus hirae (27Murata T. Yamato I. Kakinuma Y. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Science. 2005; 308: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). If the connecting loop between the fused proteins is too short, it may not allow the two halves of the protein to adopt a native conformation or insert properly into the membrane. However, if the connecting loop is too long, it could allow for another c subunit to insert between the two halves of the fusion construct. Using a model of the c12 ring from the Escherichia coli F-ATPase and the c10 ring from E. hirae V-ATPase (15Dmitriev O.Y. Jones P.C. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7785-7790Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 27Murata T. Yamato I. Kakinuma Y. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Science. 2005; 308: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), we estimate that a loop length of 10–14 amino acids is sufficient to connect adjacent subunits without allowing an additional copy of subunit c to insert between them. Therefore, all proteolipid fusions were constructed with a linker length of 10–14 amino acids. In Vivo Function and Stability of V-ATPase Containing Proteolipid Subunit Fusions—To address the functional role of different fusions, we first tested the ability of these constructs to complement the phenotype of yeast strains from which the various proteolipid genes have been deleted. It has been shown previously that yeast lacking any of the V-ATPase proteolipid genes display a conditional lethal phenotype (vma–) characterized by an inability to grow at pH 7.5 but retaining the ability to grow at pH 5.5 (28Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3503-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Data from our laboratory and others have shown previously that plasmid-borne VMA3, VMA11, VMA16, or VMA16ΔTM1 were able to complement their own disruption (25Flannery A.R. Graham L.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39856-39862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 26Nishi T. Kawasaki-Nishi S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5821-5827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The c-c″(ΔTM1), c″(ΔTM1)-c′, and c′-c fusion proteins were all able to confer wild-type growth on YEPD media buffered at pH 7.5, whereas the c-c′, c′-c″(ΔTM1), and c″(ΔTM1)-c constructs could not (Fig. 3). We also observed that the c-c″(ΔTM1) fusion construct did not support growth at pH 7.5 of the vma3Δ,vma16Δ double deletion strain, whereas the c′-c fusion construct did not support growth at pH 7.5 of the vma3Δ,vma11Δ double deletion strain (data not shown). This latter result is consistent with the need for multiple copies of subunit c, which cannot be provided by the fusion constructs alone in the double deletion strains. Next the expression and stability of the fusion proteins as well as their ability to assemble into a V-ATPase complex was tested. Western blot analysis was performed on whole cell lysates using the monoclonal antibody 10D7 for subunit a, 8B1-F3 for subunit A, and 3F10 for the HA tag. Because there is currently no available antibody raised against any of the proteolipid subunits, an HA epitope tag was added at the C-terminal end of all constructs. Three HA tags were added to the C terminus of c″(ΔTM1)-c′ because of the weak signal observed with only one tag. All the proteolipid fusions had apparent molecular masses of 32–36 kDa, whereas the monomers (c, c′, or c″(ΔTM1)) had a molecular mass of 17 kDa (Fig. 4). The lower level of antibody staining of the c″(ΔTM1)-c construct in whole cell lysate may reflect altered reactivity of the HA epitope in this construct or the low expression or degradation of the fusion protein in this mutant strain. These results demonstrate that five of the six fusion proteins are expressed and are stable. Previous studies have shown that the loss of subunit c or subunit d results in reduced levels of subunit a (29Bauerle C. Ho M.N. Lindorfer M.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12749-12757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), likely because of reduced subunit a stability when not assembled into V0. In contrast, because V1 assembles independently of V0 (29Bauerle C. Ho M.N. Lindorfer M.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12749-12757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Doherty R.D. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16845-16851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), V1 subunits are unaffected by the deletion of V0 subunits. To determine whether the proteolipid fusion constructs were able to stabilize subunit a, Western blotting was performed on whole cell lysates. As expected, lysates from all strains, including that carrying the empty vector, showed normal levels of subunit A (Fig. 4). Lysates isolated from strains expressing c-c″(ΔTM1), c″(ΔTM1)-c′, or c′-c showed almost the same level of subunit a relative to strains carrying the c, c′, or c″(ΔTM1) controls. Strains carrying the c-c′, c′-c″(ΔTM1), or c″(ΔTM1)-c showed reduced levels of subunit a, suggesting that these proteolipid fusions do not assemble properly. To confirm this assembly defect and to test for proper targeting of the V-ATPase subunits to the vacuolar membrane, partially purified vacuoles were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analysis was performed. As can be seen in Fig. 5, Western blots of isolated vacuoles carrying c-c″(ΔTM1), c″(ΔTM1)-c′, or c′-c showed slightly reduced levels of subunits a and A relative to vacuoles isolated from the strains expressing the monomer of the three proteolipid subunits, whereas the c-c′, c′-c″(ΔTM1), and c″(ΔTM1)-c constructs showed dramatically reduced levels of subunits a and A, showing that the latter three constructs were unable to assemble into either a stable V0 or V1V0 complex. These results suggest that the fusions c-c′, c′-c″(ΔTM1), and c″(ΔTM1)-c cannot form the proper arrangement of proteolipid subunits in the V0 domain, whereas the c-c″(ΔTM1), c″(ΔTM1)-c′, and c′-c are"
https://openalex.org/W2085965022,"It has long been known that during the closed mitosis of many unicellular eukaryotes, including the fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe), the nuclear envelope remains intact while the nucleus undergoes a remarkable sequence of shape transformations driven by elongation of an intranuclear mitotic spindle whose ends are capped by spindle pole bodies embedded in the nuclear envelope. However, the mechanical basis of these normal cell cycle transformations, and abnormal nuclear shapes caused by intranuclear elongation of microtubules lacking spindle pole bodies, remain unknown. Although there are models describing the shapes of lipid vesicles deformed by elongation of microtubule bundles, there are no models describing normal or abnormal shape changes in the nucleus. We describe here a novel biophysical model of interphase nuclear geometry in fission yeast that accounts for critical aspects of the mechanics of the fission yeast nucleus, including the biophysical properties of lipid bilayers, forces exerted on the nuclear envelope by elongating microtubules, and access to a lipid reservoir, essential for the large increase in nuclear surface area during the cell cycle. We present experimental confirmation of the novel and non-trivial geometries predicted by our model, which has no free parameters. We also use the model to provide insight into the mechanical basis of previously described defects in nuclear division, including abnormal nuclear shapes and loss of nuclear envelope integrity. The model predicts that (i) despite differences in structure and composition, fission yeast nuclei and vesicles with fluid lipid bilayers have common mechanical properties; (ii) the S. pombe nucleus is not lined with any structure with shear resistance, comparable to the nuclear lamina of higher eukaryotes. We validate the model and its predictions by analyzing wild type cells in which ned1 gene overexpression causes elongation of an intranuclear microtubule bundle that deforms the nucleus of interphase cells."
https://openalex.org/W1978226747,"The small proteins encoded by KCNE1 and KCNE2 have both been proposed as accessory subunits for the HERG channel. Here we report our investigation into the cell biology of the KCNE-HERG interaction. In a co-expression system, KCNE1 was more readily co-precipitated with co-expressed HERG than was KCNE2. When forward protein trafficking was prevented (either by Brefeldin A or engineering an ER-retention/retrieval signal onto KCNE cDNA) the intracellular abundance of KCNE2 and its association with HERG markedly increased relative to KCNE1. HERG co-localized more completely with KCNE1 than with KCNE2 in all the membrane-processing compartments of the cell (ER, Golgi and plasma membrane). By surface labeling and confocal immunofluorescence, KCNE2 appeared more abundant at the cell surface compared to KCNE1, which exhibited greater co-localization with the ER-marker calnexin. Examination of the extracellular culture media showed that a significant amount of KCNE2 was extracellular (both soluble and membrane-vesicle-associated). Taken together, these results suggest that during biogenesis of channels HERG is more likely to assemble with KCNE1 than KCNE2 due to distinctly different trafficking rates and retention in the cell rather than differences in relative affinity. The final channel subunit constitution, in vivo, is likely to be determined by a combination of relative cell-to-cell expression rates and differential protein processing and trafficking."
https://openalex.org/W2051459746,"Background The molecular components determining the timing for birth remain an incompletely characterized aspect of reproduction, with important conceptual and therapeutic ramifications for management of preterm, post-term and arrested labor. Methodology/Principal Findings To test the hypothesis that oxytocin mediates circadian regulation of birth, we evaluated parturition timing following shifts in light cycles in oxytocin (OT)-deficient mice. We find that, in contrast to wild type mice that do not shift the timing of birth following a 6-h advance or delay in the light cycle, OT-deficient mice delivered at random times of day. Moreover, shifts in the light-dark cycle of gravid wild type mice have little impact on the pattern of circadian oxytocin release.

C contained lactate-polymer, fructose, glucose and glucose polymer, while G contained fructose and glucose. Peak power output and VO2 on a cycle ergometer were 408+/-13 W and 67.4+/-3.2 mlO2 x kg(-1) x min(-1). Subjects performed 3 bouts of CE with C, and 2 with G at 62% VO2peak for 90 min, followed by high intensity (HI) exercise (86% VO(2)peak) to volitional fatigue. Subjects consumed 250 ml fluid immediately before (-2 min) and every 15 min of cycling. Drinks at -2 and 45 min contained 100 mg of [U-(13)C]-lactate, -glucose or -fructose. Blood, pulmonary gas samples and 13CO2 excretion were taken prior to fluid ingestion and at 5,10,15,30,45,60,75, and 90 min of CE, at the end of HI, and 15 min of recovery. HI after CE was 25% longer with C than G (6.5+/-0.8 vs. 5.2+/-1.0 min, P<0.05). 13CO2 from the -2 min lactate tracer was significantly elevated above rest at 5 min of exercise, and peaked at 15 min. 13CO2 from the -2 min glucose tracer peaked at 45 min for C and G. 13CO2 increased rapidly from the 45 min lactate dose, and by 60 min of exercise was 33% greater than glucose in C or G, and 36% greater than fructose in G. 13CO2 production following tracer fructose ingestion was greater than glucose in the first 45 minutes in C and G. Cumulative recoveries of tracer during exercise were: 92%+/-5.3% for lactate in C and 25+/-4.0% for glucose in C or G. Recoveries for fructose in C and G were 75+/-5.9% and 26+/-6.6%, respectively. Lactate was used more rapidly and to a greater extent than fructose or glucose. CytoMax significantly enhanced HI."
https://openalex.org/W2045513654,"Zonula occludens proteins (ZOs), including ZO1/2/3, are tight junction-associated proteins. Each of them contains three PDZ domains. It has been demonstrated that ZO1 can form either homodimers or heterodimers with ZO2 or ZO3 through the second PDZ domain. However, the underlying structural basis is not well understood. In this study, the solution structure of the second PDZ domain of ZO2 (ZO2-PDZ2) was determined using NMR spectroscopy. The results revealed a novel dimerization mode for PDZ domains via three-dimensional domain swapping, which can be generalized to homodimers of ZO1-PDZ2 or ZO3-PDZ2 and heterodimers of ZO1-PDZ2/ZO2-PDZ2 or ZO1-PDZ2/ZO3-PDZ2 due to high conservation between PDZ2 domains in ZO proteins. Furthermore, GST pulldown experiments and immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that interactions between ZO1-PDZ2 and ZO2-PDZ2 and their self-associations indeed exist both in vitro and in vivo. Chemical cross-linking and dynamic laser light scattering experiments revealed that both ZO1-PDZ2 and ZO2-PDZ2 can form oligomers in solution.

TJs, the most apical component of the junction complex, separate the apical from the lateral plasma membrane through forming a continuous belt-like attachment at the outer end of the intercellular space between cells. TJs play important roles in regulating the passage of ions and molecule through the paracellular pathway (2Poon I.K. Jans D.A.

TJs are also crucial for correct function of blood-brain barrier. Disruption of the TJs in blood-brain barrier is a hallmark of many central nervous system pathologies, including stroke, human immunodeficiency virus encephalitis, Alzheimer disease, multiple sclerosis, and bacterial meningitis. Systemic-derived inflammation has been shown to cause disruption of TJs and increased paracellular permeability (6Huber J.D. Egleton R.D. Davis T.P.

They are mainly located at the submembranous region of the junction complex.

Biol. 2000; 11: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Recent studies have provided accumulated evidences to unveil domains that are responsible for the interactions between ZO proteins. The association between ZO1 and ZO2/ZO3 is through their second PDZ domains (20Itoh M. Morita K. Tsukita S. J. Biol.

Utepbergenov's group showed significant amount of ZO1 homodimers in MDCK cells and demonstrated that the second PDZ domain is both necessary and sufficient for the dimerization (22Utepbergenov D.I.

The SH3/GK domain was also reported to be important in ZO1 dimerization, similarly as of in other MAGUK proteins, such as PSD-95 and Dlg/SAP90/SAP102 (23Umeda K. Ikenouchi J. Katahira-Tayama S.

Dimerization or oligomerization of ZO proteins plays a pivotal role in determining the activity of their binding partners. Claudins are thought to constitute the backbone of TJ strands (30Tsukita S. Furuse M. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 268-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). They can form homo- and hetero-oligomers during their engagement in the formation of paracellular channels or pores (31Aijaz S. Balda M.S. Matter K. Int. Rev.

ZOs bind to claudin YV C termini through their first PDZ domain (36Itoh M. Furuse M. Morita K. Kubota K. Saitou M. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1351-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). The dimerization of ZO1 (probably also ZO2) not only initiates the polymerization of claudins, namely the formation of TJ strands, but also directs the correct localization of TJ strands (23Umeda K. Ikenouchi J. Katahira-Tayama S. Furuse K. Sasaki H. Nakayama M. Matsui T. Tsukita S. Furuse M. Tsukita S. Cell. 2006; 126: 741-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular basis of the PDZ domain-mediated dimerization/oligomerization of ZO family proteins, we have determined the solution structure of ZO2-PDZ2 using NMR spectroscopy. Unexpectedly, ZO2-PDZ2 forms very tight 2-fold symmetric homodimers via a three-dimensional domain swapping assembly mode (37Bennett M.J. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1464-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). To the best of our knowledge, this ZO2-PDZ2 dimer is the first example for dimerization of PDZ domain via three-dimensional domain swapping. Further chemical cross-linking and dynamic laser light scattering experiments demonstrated that both ZO1-PDZ2 and ZO2-PDZ2 can form oligomers in solution. The ZO2-PDZ2 dimer structure is ideally suited for the tight assembly of ZOs in TJs. Oligonucleotides—The sequences of the oligonucleotides for target cDNA PCR amplification used in this study are listed as follows: P1, 5′-CATATGACTAAAGTCACACTGGTGAAATC-3′; P2, 5′-CTCGAGTTCATCTCTTTGAACTACC-3′; P3, 5′-CATATGATCGGGGTCCTCCTGATGAAAAG-3′; P4, 5′-CTCGAGGCTGTCTCTCAACACCACTAGCTG-3′; P5, 5′-GCGAATTCTATGACTAAAGTCACACTGGTG-3′; and P6, 5′-GCGAATTCTATGATCGGGGTCCTCCTGATG-3′. Reagents and Antibodies—Monoclonal antibodies used in this study are mAb-GFP (TaKaRa, Japan) and mAb-FLAG (Sigma). EZview™ Red ANTI-FLAG® M2 affinity gel was a kind gift from Prof. Xuebiao Yao. Restriction enzymes were purchased mostly from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Medium compounds were obtained from Oxid (Basingstroke Hampshire, UK). Plasmids Construction—The DNA fragments coding for human ZO1-PDZ2 domain (Q07157 amino acid residues Thr-185 to Glu-264) and ZO2-PDZ2 domain (Q9UDY2 amino acid residues Ile-306 to Ser-385) were amplified, respectively, from the human brain cDNA library (Clontech) using primer pair P1/P2 or P3/P4 (see “Oligonucleotides”). The amplified DNA fragments were inserted into the NdeI/XhoI-cleaved plasmid pET22b(+) (Novagen) to generate His-ZO1-PDZ2 or His-ZO2-PDZ2 with His6 tag fusion at their C termini. They were subsequently subcloned into NdeI/XhoI sites of modified pGEX-4T-1 vector for the preparation of GST-ZO1-PDZ2 and GST-ZO2-PDZ2. In addition, the gene fragments coding for ZO1-PDZ2 and ZO2-PDZ2 domain generated from PCR reactions using primer pair P2/P5 or P4/P6 were digested using restriction enzymes EcoRI and XhoI and subcloned, respectively, into the EcoRI/SalI-cleaved pEGFP-C1 vector for the preparation of GFP-ZO1-PDZ2 and GFP-ZO2-PDZ2 or EcoRI/XhoI sites of p3×-FLAG-Myc-CMV-24 expression vector for the preparation of FLAG-ZO1-PDZ2 and FLAG-ZO2-PDZ2. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Expression and Purification of Fusion Proteins—The recombinant plasmids harboring the respective target genes were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) host cells for large scale protein production. The purified recombinant protein His-ZO2-PDZ2 contains an N-terminal Met and a C-terminal His tag (-LEHHHHHH), whereas the purified recombinant His-ZO1-PDZ2 protein contains a C-terminal His6 tag, with the N-terminal Met being cleaved during expression (data from unpublished mass spectrum). The GST and GST fusion proteins were purified through the glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). The soluble His6-tagged fusion proteins were purified using HiTrap Chelating columns (Amersham Biosciences) according to the procedures specified by manufacturer. The purity of recombinant proteins were confirmed by Tricine-SDS-PAGE (15%, w/v), and the concentration was measured using BCA kits (Pierce). Uniformly 15N- and 15N/13C-labeled His6-tagged proteins were prepared through growing bacteria in SV40 medium using 15NH4Cl (0.5g/liter) and 13C6-glucose (2.5g/liter) as stable isotope sources. In Vitro Binding Assay using GST Fusion Proteins—For in vitro binding studies, the bacterially purified His-ZO1-PDZ2 was equally divided into three parts. Then they were mixed with GST alone, GST-ZO2-PDZ2 or GST-ZO1-PDZ2 fusion protein coupled to the glutathione beads individually. His-ZO2-PDZ2 protein was also equally divided and mixed with GST, GST-ZO1-PDZ2, or GST-ZO2-PDZ2 fusion protein coupled to the glutathione beads individually. The GST-conjugated Glutathione-Sepharose beads were used as a negative control. Samples were then centrifuged at 4000 rpm at 4 °C for 4 min and washed ten times using 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Proteins were eluted from beads by 5-min boiling in sample buffer (Bio-Rad) and separated on 15% denatured SDS-PAGE gel, followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Western Blot Analysis and Co-immunoprecipitation—H1299 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Transfection of cells with mammalian expression vectors (see “Plasmids Construction”) was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's specifications. For Western blot analysis, cells were washed with 1×PBS and resuspended using 5 volumes of cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The cell lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min and were then centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C. Equal amounts of total cellular proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the resolved proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking with 5% nonfat milk in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for overnight at 4 °C, the blot was incubated with primary antibody for 2 h at room temperature, and followed by incubating with a alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. After washing three times with TBST, the blots were developed using the chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. To perform co-immunoprecipitation, we co-transfected H1299 cells with pEGFP-ZO1-PDZ2 and p3×FLAG, p3×FLAG-ZO1-PDZ2 or p3×FLAG-ZO2-PDZ2, or with pEGFP-ZO2-PDZ2 and p3×FLAG, p3×FLAG-ZO1-PDZ2 or p3×FLAG-ZO2-PDZ2. 24 h later, cells were harvested and resuspended with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). After incubated on ice for 2 h, the cell lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C. Successively, the supernatants were collected and incubated with EZview™ Red ANTI-FLAG® M2 affinity gel for 4 h at 4 °C, bound proteins were recovered by boiling the washed beads in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblot. Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography Size-exclusion Chromatography—The purified His6-tagged proteins were concentrated and then gel-filtered with Superdex 75 10/300 GL column (Amersham Biosciences), which was equilibrated with 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) and 200 mm NaCl, at 25 °C. Elution was performed using the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, at 25 °C. Previously, the column was calibrated using known molecular mass proteins: bovine albumin (67 kDa, monomer), albumin egg (45 kDa), chymotrypsinogen (25 kDa), myoglobin (17.8 kDa), and lysozyme (14.4 kDa). Sedimentation Velocity Analysis—Sedimentation velocity studies were carried out with a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge with an An60Ti rotor at 20 °C and 56,000 rpm. The partial specific volumes (0.7389 ml/g for ZO1-PDZ2 and 0.7448 ml/g for ZO2-PDZ2), and molecular masses of the monomers (10010 Da for ZO1-PDZ2 and 10081Da for ZO2-PDZ2) were calculated based on their amino acid composition using the program SEDNTERP. Protein samples (at approximate concentrations of 5 mg/ml and 0.5 mg/ml) were prepared in sedimentation buffer (PBS buffer including 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2). 380-μl samples and 400-μl reference volumes were loaded into cells. Absorbance scans at 280 or 235 nm were collected at a time interval of 2 min. Sedimentation profiles were analyzed with the software SEDFIT (version 8.9) using the continuous distribution c(s) Lamm equation model (38Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2978) Google Scholar, 39Schuck P. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 320: 104-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). NMR Experiments—The purified proteins were dissolved to a final concentration of 0.8 mm in 500 μl of 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), containing 200 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA. Unless otherwise specified, all NMR spectra were acquired at 310K on a Bruker DMX 600 spectrometer. 1H-15N HSQC spectra were acquired on uniformly 15N-labeled or 15N/13C-labeled samples. The latter sample was also used to collect triple resonance spectra. Backbone resonance assignments of ZO2-PDZ2 were carried out by inspection of three-dimensional HNCO, HN(CA)CO, CBCANH, and CBCA(CO)NH. Side-chain resonance assignments of ZO2-PDZ2 were obtained from HBHA(CBCACO)NH, 15N-NOESY-HSQC, 15N-TOCSY-HSQC, H(C)(CO)NH-TOCSY, (H)C(CO)NH-TOCSY, HCCH-COSY, HCCH-TOCSY, and 13C-NOESY-HSQC. Aromatic protons were assigned using two-dimensional 1H-NOESY and 1H-TOCSY spectra of the unlabeled protein in D2O. For the H/D exchange experiment, the 15N-labeled sample was lyophilized and then redissolved in 99.96% D2O, which was followed immediately with HSQC experiments to monitor the disappearance of NH signal at 293 K. The 15N-separated NOESY and 13C-separated NOESY were both collected with a mixing time 130 ms. To determine whether domain swapping has occurred, 13C F1-filtered, F2-edited two-dimensional NOESY spectra were recorded separately for samples of ZO1-PDZ2 and ZO2-PDZ2 (40Otting G. Wüthrich K. J. Magn. Reson. 1989; 85: 586-594Google Scholar). These samples were made from a 1:1 mixture of uniformly 15N/13C-labeled and unlabeled proteins by unfolding and refolding with 8 m urea, which therefore contained 25% labeled-labeled, 50% labeled-unlabeled, and 25% unlabeled-unlabeled dimers. The appropriate processing of such spectra yields a sub-spectrum where predominantly only NOESY cross-peaks resulting from intermolecular interactions are observed. All of NMR spectra were processed with NMRPipe (41Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11280) Google Scholar) and analyzed using Sparky3 software. 4T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, Sparky3, University of California, San Francisco. Structure Calculations of ZO2-PDZ2 Domain—NMR distance restraints were collected from two different NOESY spectra: three-dimensional 15N-separated NOESY in H2O for amide protons and three-dimensional 13C-separated NOESY in D2O for aliphatic protons. NOEs were grouped into four distance ranges according to their relative intensity: strong, 1.8-3.0 Å; medium, 1.8-4.0 Å; weak, 1.8-5.0 Å; very weak, 1.8-7.0 Å. The 1.8-Å lower limits were imposed only implicitly by the van der Waals repulsion force. The NOEs were specified as intermolecular and intramolecular according to domain swapped topology inferred from the 13C F1-filtered, F2-edited two-dimensional NOESY spectrum. Dihedral restraints (φ and ψ) were determined using the 1Hα, 15N, 13Cα, 13Cβ, and 13CO chemical shifts and the program TALOS (43Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol.

Hydrogen bond (H-bond) restraints were generated by a combination of the H/D exchange experiment and the standard secondary structure of the protein based on NOE patterns. Structures were calculated using the program CNS version 1.1 (44Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J.

Cross-linking of His Fusion Proteins—Purified His fusion proteins were diluted into indicated concentrations and centrifuged at 13,200 rpm for 5 min. The supernatants were then collected and treated with Me2SO alone or disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) in Me2SO from a 10-fold stock solution to a final concentration of 5 mm. After incubating at 37 °C for 30 min, the cross-linker was quenched by the adding of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH7.5) to a final concentration of 20 mm at room temperature for 15 min. Samples were then solubilized in sample buffer (Bio-Rad), boiled, and centrifuged at 13,200 rpm for 5 min. His fusion proteins were separated on 15% SDS-PAGE gel, followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Dynamic Laser Light Scattering Measurements—DLS measurements (47Berne, B. J., and Pecora, R. (1976) Dynamic Light Scattering: with Applications to Chemistry, Biology, and Physics, pp. 11-53, Wiley, New YorkGoogle Scholar) were conducted on an ALV/DLS/SLS-5022F spectrometer with a multi-τ digital time correlation (ALV5000) and a cylindrical 22-milliwatt UNIPHASE He-Ne laser (λ0 = 632 nm) as the light source. The intensity-intensity time correlation function G(2)(t,q) was measured to determine the line-width distribution G(Γ). For diffusive relaxation, Γ is related to the translational diffusion coefficient (D) of the scattering object (macromolecules or colloid particles) in dilute solution or dispersion by D = (〈Γ〉/q2)C→0,q→0 and further to hydrodynamic radius (Rh) from the Stokes-Einstein equation: Rh = kBT/(6πηD), where η, kB, and T are the solvent viscosity, the Boltzmann constant, and the absolute temperature, respectively. Hydrodynamic radius distribution f(Rh) was calculated from the Laplace inversion of a corresponding measured G(2)(t,q) using the CONTIN program. All DLS measurements were conducted at a scattering angle (θ) of 45° at 37.0 °C. Protein samples (at approximate concentrations of 3.0 × 10-3g/ml) were prepared in physiological buffer conditions (PBS buffer including 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2). The Interactions between ZO1-PDZ2 and ZO2-PDZ2 and Their Self-associations—It has been demonstrated that ZO1 interacts with both ZO2 and ZO3. Deletion of any PDZ2 domain of these proteins can disrupt the complex formation (20Itoh M. Morita K. Tsukita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5981-5986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 21Fanning A.S. Jameson B.J. Jesaitis L.A. Anderson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29745-29753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). The striking homology (67.5%) between ZO1-PDZ2 and ZO2-PDZ2 suggests a great possibility of their self-associations. To test this possibility, we transformed E. coli BL21(DE3) with the plasmids encoding GST-ZO1-PDZ2, GST-ZO2-PDZ2, or GST alone. The lysate from each transformant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and mixed with bacterially purified His-ZO1-PDZ2 or His-ZO2-PDZ2 proteins in pulldown buffer. As shown in Fig. 1A, His-ZO1-PDZ2 was retained by both GST-ZO2-PDZ2 and GST-ZO1-PDZ2; His-ZO2-PDZ2 was retained by both GST-ZO1-PDZ2 and GST-ZO2-PDZ2, indicating that ZO1-PDZ2 and ZO2-PDZ2 were able to bind not only to each other, but also to themselves. Neither His-ZO1-PDZ2 nor His-ZO2-PDZ2 was remained by GST alone. To further confirm the physical interactions between PDZ2 domains of ZO1 and ZO2 in vivo, co-immunoprecipitation was performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” As expected, GFP-ZO1-PDZ2 could be co-precipitated by both FLAG-ZO2-PDZ2 and FLAG-ZO1-PDZ2, and GFP-ZO2-PDZ2 could be co-precipitated by both FLAG-ZO1-PDZ2 and FLAG-ZO2-PDZ2. Neither GFP-ZO1-PDZ2 nor GFP-ZO2-PDZ2 was co-precipitated by FLAG only (Fig. 1B). The above results strongly suggest that interactions between ZO1-PDZ2 and ZO2-PDZ2 as well as their self-associations indeed exist in mammalian cells. ZO1-PDZ2 and ZO2-PDZ2 Form Both Homodimer and Heterodimer Tightly in Solution—As shown in Fig. 2A, ZO1-PDZ2 was eluted out at a molecular mass of 28 kDa, and ZO2-PDZ2 was eluted out as a 25-kDa molecule, suggesting that they both exist as dimers. Their association states were further examined by analytical ultracentrifugation. Only one major peak was detected for each of these two proteins, indicating that they are structurally homogeneous in solution. The results of data analysis with Sedfit version 8.9d showed that ZO1-PDZ2 and ZO2-PDZ2 sediment at 1.95 S and 1.83 S, corresponding to a molecular masses of 21.2 and 20.6 kDa, respectively (Fig. 2B). These results confirmed that ZO1-PDZ2 and ZO2-PDZ2 both exist as dimers, in agreement with the results of gel-filtration chromatography. The two dimers are very tight, because no monomeric fraction was detected by sedimentation velocity analysis. To characterize the dimeric states of ZO1-PDZ2 and ZO2-PDZ2 by NMR spectroscopy, equivalent amounts of 15N and 13C labeled and unlabeled proteins were mixed in a buffer (containing 20 mm PBS, 200 mm NaCl, and pH 6.5) to reach a heterolabeled dimer. The mixture of proteins was treated with 8 m urea to make the protein unfolded and then refolded through dialysis. Two-dimensional 13C F1-filtered, F2-edited NOESY experiments performed on the newly prepared samples of ZO1-PDZ2 and ZO2-PDZ2 both allowed the identification of a set of intermonomer NOE connectivities, supporting our conclusion that PDZ2 domains of ZO1/2 form dimers in solution. A two-dimensional-NOESY experiment with unlabeled sample showed the Hα, Hα connectivities characteristic of antiparallel β-sheets for ZO2-PDZ2. A total of twelve such NOEs, both intramolecular and intermolecular, were observed (Fig. 3A). In t"

We measured levels of 24 different CH compounds of individual male D. melanogaster hourly under a variety of environmental (LD/DD) conditions. Using a model-based analysis of CH variation, we developed an improved normalization method for CH data, and show that CH compounds have reproducible cyclic within-day temporal patterns of expression which differ between LD and DD conditions. Multivariate clustering of expression patterns identified 5 clusters of co-expressed compounds with common chemical characteristics. Turnover rate estimates suggest CH production may be a significant metabolic cost. Male cuticular hydrocarbon expression is a dynamic trait influenced by light and time of day; since abundant hydrocarbons affect male sexual behavior, males may present different pheromonal profiles at different times and under different conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2022633326,"A-type lamins, predominantly lamins A and C, are nuclear intermediate filaments believed to act as scaffolds for assembly of transcription factors. Lamin A/C is necessary for the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) stabilization through unknown mechanism(s). Two oncoproteins, gankyrin and MDM2, are known to promote pRB degradation in other contexts. Consequently, we tested the hypothesis that gankyrin and/or MDM2 are required for enhanced pRB degradation in Lmna-/- fibroblasts. Principal Findings. To determine if gankyrin promotes pRB destabilization in the absence of lamin A/C, we first analyzed its protein levels in Lmna-/- fibroblasts. Both gankyrin mRNA levels and protein levels are increased in these cells, leading us to further investigate its role in pRB degradation. Consistent with prior reports, overexpression of gankyrin in Lmna+/+ cells destabilizes pRB. This decrease is functionally significant, since gankyrin overexpressing cells are resistant to p16(ink4a)-mediated cell cycle arrest. These findings suggest that lamin A-mediated degradation of pRB would be gankyrin-dependent. However, effective RNAi-enforced reduction of gankyrin expression in Lmna-/- cells was insufficient to restore pRB stability. To test the importance of MDM2, we disrupted the MDM2-pRB interaction by transfecting Lmna-/- cells with p14(arf). p14(arf) expression was also insufficient to stabilize pRB or confer cell cycle arrest, suggesting that MDM2 also does not mediate pRB degradation in Lmna-/- cells.Our findings suggest that pRB degradation in Lmna-/- cells occurs by gankyrin and MDM2-independent mechanisms, leading us to propose the existence of a third proteasome-dependent pathway for pRB degradation. Two findings from this study also increase the likelihood that lamin A/C functions as a tumor suppressor. First, protein levels of the oncoprotein gankyrin are elevated in Lmna-/- fibroblasts. Second, Lmna-/- cells are refractory to p14(arf)-mediated cell cycle arrest, as was previously shown with p16(ink4a). Potential roles of lamin A/C in the suppression of tumorigenesis are discussed."

Among the proteins encoded by the viral genome, Tax has been identified as a key player in HTLV-1-induced pathogenesis. Functioning as a transcriptional trans-activator, Tax is known to aberrantly regulate cellular genes, prompting the genesis of ATL by interacting with a host of cellular transcription factors and signaling molecules to enhance or repress cellular gene expression (2Matsuoka M. Jeang K.T. Nat. Rev. 2007; 7: 270-280Crossref Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 3Harhaj E.W. Good L. Xiao G. Sun S.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 4Ng P.W.

Tax affects the expression of several factors that may contribute to cellular transformation, including altered regulation of several cytokines and receptors involved in T cell growth and proliferation, such as granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, TNF-α, IL-15, IL-2, and IL-2Rα (5Azimi N.

In addition, in vivo studies have demonstrated that transgenic mice expressing Tax develop a variety of cancers, including neurofibrosarcomas and large granular lymphocytic leukemias, depending on the promoter driving expression of the tax gene (8Grossman W.J.

Hatanaka M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1071-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Tax has been described as an intracellular protein localizing to the nucleus by virtue of an amino-terminal nuclear localization signal (10Smith M.R. Greene W.C. Virology. 1992; 187: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and has also been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm (11Burton M. Upadhyaya C.D. Maier B. Hope T.J. Semmes O.J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2351-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), suggesting that cytoplasmic Tax serves additional roles (reviewed in Ref. 12Alefantis T. Jain P. Ahuja J. Mostoller K. Wigdahl B. J. Biomed. Sci. 2005; 12: 961-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Supporting this hypothesis, we previously demonstrated that Tax contains a leucine-rich nuclear export signal between amino acids 188 and 202 that facilitates its export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (13Alefantis T. Barmak K. Harhaj E.W. Grant C. Wigdahl B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21814-21822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Tax may localize to the cytoplasm as an intermediary step during the course of its release from HTLV-1-infected cells, as demonstrated by its presence in cytoplasmic secretory-like vesicles (14Alefantis T. Mostoller K. Jain P. Harhaj E. Grant C. Wigdahl B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17353-17362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Upon its release, secreted Tax may function as an extracellular cytokine. Many pathologic abnormalities associated with HAM/TSP have been attributed to extracellular Tax. Important to the genesis of neurologic disease, cell-free Tax has recently been detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of HAM/TSP patients (15Cartier L. Ramirez E. Arch Virol. 2005; 150: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and in vitro studies have demonstrated that extracellular Tax has detrimental effects on central nervous system-resident cell populations. Specifically, extracellular Tax causes the induction of TNF-α in human neuronal cells (16Cowan E.P. Alexander R.K. Daniel S. Kashanchi F. Brady J.N. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6982-6989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and has been demonstrated to induce the production of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in adult human microglial cells and peripheral blood macrophages (17Dhib-Jalbut S. Hoffman P.M. Yamabe T. Sun D. Xia J. Eisenberg H. Bergey G. Ruscetti F.W. Ann. Neurol. 1994; 36: 787-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Local production of these factors could facilitate the maintenance of an inflammatory state and possibly contribute to the process of demyelination observed during the course of disease progression. For example, HAM/TSP has been characterized by a persistent and highly active immune response dominated by a large population of Tax-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes present in both the peripheral blood and the cerebrospinal fluid, with a number of studies suggesting their relevance to disease pathogenesis (18Kubota R.

Consistent with this avenue of thought, we have demonstrated that extracellular Tax can induce the expression of several genes involved in activation and maturation of dendritic cells, the most potent antigen-presenting cells (24Ahuja J. Kampani K. Datta S. Wigdahl B. Flaig K.E. Jain P. J. Neurovirol. 2006; 12: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated that Tax alters dendritic cell function and induces T cell proliferation in a mixed lymphocyte culture (25Jain P. Ahuja J. Khan Z.K. Shimizu S. Meucci O. Jennings S.R. Wigdahl B. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2007; 82: 44-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Additionally, these studies have confirmed that cell-free Tax can be taken up by antigen-presenting cells and presented to T cells. It has also been suggested that extracellular Tax serves pathogenic functions in the central nervous system (26Grant C. Barmak K. Alefantis T. Yao J. Jacobson S. Wigdahl B. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 190: 133-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, the process by which Tax exits the cell and the mechanism of Tax secretion have not been fully delineated. Studies have demonstrated that Tax can be released from HTLV-1-transformed cells by a mechanism other than cell death (27Brady J.N. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1992; 8: 724-727PubMed Google Scholar, 28Lindholm P.F. Marriott S.J. Gitlin S.D. Bohan C.A. Brady J.N. New Biologist. 1990; 2: 1034-1043PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we have investigated the active secretion of Tax in vitro. In this regard, we previously determined that Tax contains a leucine-rich nuclear export signal (13Alefantis T. Barmak K. Harhaj E.W. Grant C. Wigdahl B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21814-21822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and is secreted from Tax-transfected mammalian cells using a model cell line for secretion studies (baby hamster kidney, BHK-21), and a human kidney epithelial cell line (14Alefantis T. Mostoller K. Jain P. Harhaj E. Grant C. Wigdahl B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17353-17362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Moreover, an increase in Tax secretion was observed following treatment of cells with the secretagogues phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin, indicating that a significant amount of Tax was present in the regulated secretory pathway (14Alefantis T. Mostoller K. Jain P. Harhaj E. Grant C. Wigdahl B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17353-17362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a Tax mutant lacking the carboxyl-terminal 139 amino acids displayed a reduced ability to be secreted, 4T. Alefantis and B. Wigdahl, unpublished observations. 4T. Alefantis and B. Wigdahl, unpublished observations. suggesting that critical amino acid motifs in the carboxyl-terminal domain of Tax may direct the protein to the cellular secretory pathway, since Tax does not contain a leader sequence typical of many secreted proteins (14Alefantis T. Mostoller K. Jain P. Harhaj E. Grant C. Wigdahl B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17353-17362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Studies reported herein provide information concerning the transport of Tax from the cytoplasm to the extracellular environment as well as the identification of amino acid signals participating in Tax secretion. Using the BHK-21 model cell line, we have demonstrated the interaction of Tax with a number of proteins comprising the cellular secretory pathway, including those that facilitate transport from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi, and from the post-Golgi to the plasma membrane (PM). These observations were reproducible in C8166 cells, an HTLV-1-infected T cell line serving as a physiologically relevant cell system to study Tax secretion. Comparison of the Tax amino acid sequence with amino acid signals known to target proteins of the cellular secretory pathway yielded the identification of a number of potential motifs that may be involved in targeting Tax for secretion. In agreement with previous studies, Tax localized to the nucleus and in a punctate distribution throughout the cell extending to the plasma membrane. However, mutations in the putative secretory signal DHE as well as a four-amino acid dihydrophobic tyrosine-based motif (YTNI) altered the subcellular distribution of Tax, resulting in an abundant amount of Tax localized to areas immediately surrounding the nucleus. Although Tax mutants retain the ability to trans-activate the HTLV-1 LTR, implying that aberrant localization to the ER or Golgi is not due to gross misfolding of Tax, a comparison of parental Tax versus YTNI and DHE double mutants revealed significant differences in percentage of total Tax secreted. These studies suggest that the putative secretory signals YTNI and DHE are involved in facilitating the egress of Tax through the secretory pathway en route to Tax secretion. Cell Culture—BHK-21 cells (CCL-10; ATCC, Manassas, VA) were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium (ATCC). The HTLV-1-infected T cell line C8166 provided by Dr. Shao-Cong Sun (Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine) and the CD4+ T cell line Jurkat (clone E6-1; catalog number TIB-152; ATCC) were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Mediatech, Herndon, VA). All growth media were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) with penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (Mediatech Inc.). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 at 90% relative humidity. Tax Fusion Protein Constructs and Plasmid Purification—HTLV-1 Tax constructs utilized in fluorescence microscopy analyses were constructed by cloning full-length Tax cDNA sequence into yellow or green fluorescent protein constructs (pEYFP-N1 and pEGFP-N1, respectively) (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), yielding constructs encoding fusion proteins in which YFP or GFP were fused to the carboxyl terminus of Tax as described (13Alefantis T. Barmak K. Harhaj E.W. Grant C. Wigdahl B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21814-21822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Mutations in putative secretory signals of Tax were made with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Specifically, Tax-YFP was converted to Tax-ATNI-YFP (312YTNI315 to 312ATNI315), Tax-YTNA-YFP (312YTNI315 to 312YTNA315), Tax-ATNA-YFP (312YTNI315 to 312ATNA315), Tax-AA-YFP (319LL320 to 319AA320), Tax-AHA-YFP (330DHE332 to 330AHA332), and Tax-ΔV-YFP (deletion of Val353). The Tax-His6 protein expression vector (pTax-His6) was generously provided by Dr. Chou-Zen Giam (Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, MD). For quantitative analysis, parental Tax and mutant Tax sequences were cloned into pIRES-EGFP (Clontech) following PCR with Tax-specific primers that added FLAG (DDDDK) or His6 tags as described (14Alefantis T. Mostoller K. Jain P. Harhaj E. Grant C. Wigdahl B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17353-17362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Combination mutations in Tax that were constructed include Tax-AHA-ATNI (330DHE332 to 330AHA332 and 312YTNI315 to 312ATNI315), Tax-AHA-ATNA (330DHE332 to 330AHA332 and 312YTNI315 to 312ATNA315), and Tax-AHA-AA (330DHE332 to 330AHA332 and 319LL320 to 319AA320). GST-tagged Tax was generated by cloning the Tax coding sequence into pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) between the BamHI and EcoRI sites. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing using a Beckman Coulter CEQ 8800 sequencer located in the DNA Sequencing Laboratory of the Center for Molecular and Functional Genomics in the Institute for Molecular Medicine and Infectious Disease, Drexel University College of Medicine. The sequence was analyzed by MegAlign under the cluster-W method using Lasergene software (DNASTAR, Madison, WI). Purification of Tax-His6 and FLAG-Tax-His6 Proteins—Tax protein was expressed in Escherichia coli HB101 by the pTax-His6 plasmid and purified using the His-bind purification system (Novagen, Madison, WI) as described (13Alefantis T.

Neurovirol. 2004; 10: 358-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). FLAG-Tax-His6 (FTH6) was constructed by inserting the FLAG coding sequence at the 5′ end of the Tax-His6 gene in the pTax-His6 expression vector as described (14Alefantis T. Mostoller K. Jain P. Harhaj E. Grant C. Wigdahl B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17353-17362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Purified protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE and was stained using the Silver Stain Plus reagent (Bio-Rad). The concentration of FTH6 protein was quantitated using densitometry. The activity of the protein was determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay with respect to enhancement of cAMP-response element-binding protein (kindly provided by Dr. Jennifer Nyborg, Colorado State University, Ft. Collins, CO) binding to the 21-bp HTLV-1 promoter proximal repeat of Tax-responsive element 1 (30Zhao L.J. Giam C.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11445-11449Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Cellular Secretory Pathway Protein Array—BHK-21 cells were plated at a concentration of 3 × 106 cells/plate (100 mm) and were transfected using 24 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and 9.6 μg of FTH6 DNA. The DiscoverLight™ protein array kit for use with His-tagged proteins was utilized to examine the interaction of Tax with cellular cytoplasmic proteins (Pierce). Antibodies to cellular proteins (actin (sc-1615; Sigma), rabbit IgG (sc-2040; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), mouse IgG (sc-2025; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), IKK-γ (sc-8256; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), calreticulin (NB600-101; Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO), calregulin (C-17; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), calregulin (N-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), CRM-1 (H-300; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), CRM-1 (N-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), SCAMP1 (ab3430; Abcam, Cambridge, CO), SCAMP2 (ab3431; Novus Biologicals), SNAP23 (ab4114; Abcam), RanBP2 (ab2938; Abcam), Nup50 (ab4005; Abcam), O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (nucleoporin p62, ab2736; Abcam), NTF p97 (ab2811; Abcam), βCOP (ab6324; Abcam), COPII (PA1-069; Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO), kinesin (ab9097; Abcam), tubulin (ab6160; Abcam)) were manually spotted (1 μl) on a nitrocellulose membrane grid at predetermined positions. Arrays were blocked for 1 h and incubated for 2 h with either whole cell lysate (1.5 mg/ml) from untransfected BHK-21 cells or lysate from BHK-21 cells transfected with FTH6 expression constructs, followed by incubation for 2 h with purified Tax-His6 protein (2 μg/ml); this step was not necessary following membrane incubation with lysate from FTH6-transfected cells. After washing, the arrays were probed for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-His6 monoclonal antibody (ab1187; Abcam), developed using the Western Lightning kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and radiography and densitometry were performed on two separate experimental determinates. Global Antibody Microarray Analyses—A recently developed antibody microarray (XPRESS Profiler725; Sigma) targeting the global expression of a broad range of cellular proteins known to be involved in a variety of different biological pathways was used to examine the expression of these genes in a HTLV-1-transformed T cell line (C8166). This antibody array contains 725 antibodies spotted in duplicate on nitrocellulose-coated glass slides. HTLV-1-transformed C8166 cells plated at 5 × 106 cells/plate (100 mm) were left untransfected or transfected using 18 μl of FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) and 6 μg of FTH6 DNA. Nontransfected Jurkat T cells were used as a comparative negative control. Cells were harvested for protein extraction 24 h post-transfection, and equal amounts of protein extracts (>1 mg/ml) were labeled using Cy3 or Cy5 monoreactive reactive dyes (Amersham Biosciences) as described by the manufacturer (Sigma). Labeled samples with a dye/protein molar ratio >2 were applied to the antibody microarray in Array Incubation Buffer (Sigma) and incubated for 45 min protected from light with gentle shaking. The array was then washed three times with 5 ml of Washing Buffer (Sigma), air-dried completely, and scanned using a GenePix 4000B microarray scanner (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Image analysis was performed with GenePix Pro 5.0 software that provides a tool to obtain the position and content of each spot on the array. Data were mined to include proteins of the cellular secretory pathway as well as known Tax-interacting proteins. GST Pull-down Assays—To confirm the interactions between Tax and selected proteins from the antibody array, a MagneGST™ pull-down system was utilized (Promega, Madison, WI). Full-length SCAMP1, SCAMP2, SNAP23, and COPII were cloned in expression vectors designed to construct prey proteins. The primer sequences used for PCR were as follows: SCAMP1, Forward 5′-CACCATGTCGGCTTTCGACA-3′, Reverse 5′-AGAGGCAGGCGAGAGAAAG-3′; SCAMP2, Forward 5′-CACCATGTCGGATTTCGACAGT-3′, Reverse 5′-GCGGAGAAAAAGGTACAG-3′; SNAP23, Forward 5′-CACCATGTTTAGTGTTTTCATCCT-3′, Reverse 5′-TGGTGAAACCCTGTCTCTACTAAA-3′; COPII, Forward 5′-CACCATGACGGCGGCTGAGAAC-3′, Reverse 5′-GATGTTGGAGTCCAGTAAGCCC-3′. Following PCR amplification from a human cDNA template, plasmids were generated by cloning into pcDNA™3.1D/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen). Constructs were confirmed by sequencing in both directions as described above. To verify the binding of Tax to IKK-γ, the MGC full-length IKK-γ clone (Clone ID 606257; Invitrogen) was inserted into the pcDNA™3.1D/V5-His-TOPO vector. Prey proteins (IKK-γ, SCAMP1, SCAMP2, SNAP23, and COPII) were translated in vitro with the TNT® quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). Tax-GST and Rex-GST bait proteins and GST control vector were expressed in the DH5α-T1R strain of E. coli (Invitrogen). Bacterial cultures (1 ml) was lysed by freeze-thaw treatment and gentle mixing (30 min) in lysis buffer. Cell lysates were incubated with GSH-linked magnetic particles at room temperature with gentle mixing to allow GST fusion bait protein to be immobilized on the particles. The Tax-GST, Rex-GST, or GST alone bound particles were magnetically removed from the lysate, washed, and incubated with in vitro translation reaction (20 μl) for 1 h at room temperature. Particles were magnetically separated from the TNT reaction and washed six times, and the bound protein was eluted by incubating the particles in Laemmli Sample Buffer (Bio-Rad). Eluted protein samples were analyzed by western immunoblotting. Briefly, samples were heat-denatured and loaded onto 12% Tris-HCl SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad), subjected to electrophoresis, and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Pall Corp., Ann Arbor, MI). Blots were blocked and incubated with α-IKK-γ (clone FL-419, directed against full-length IKK-γ), α-SCAMP1, α-SCAMP2, α-SNAP23, or α-COPII followed by either anti-rabbit horse-radish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and developed using the Western Lightening kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Assays were performed in duplicate and repeated three times. Silencing of Potential Tax-interacting Proteins and Their Effect on Tax Secretion—The interaction of Tax with proteins of the secretory pathway was further confirmed using RNA interference and examining the subsequent effect on Tax secretion. Briefly, a SmartPool containing four RNA duplexes (19 bp with a 3′-UU overhang and 5′-phosphorylated antisense strand) specific to SCAMP1, SNAP23, or COPII was purchased from Dharmacon RNA Technologies (Lafayette, CO). C8166 cells (1 × 106 cells/well) were transfected using DharmaFECT transfection reagent and 2 μm small interfering RNA against components of the secretory pathway. Western immunoblot analyses were performed to confirm silencing at the protein level at 48 h post-transfection. Cells were then transfected with FTH6 DNA using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science), and the effects of silencing were examined by a FLAG-based ELISA to detect Tax in the supernatants of transfected cells. Detection of Tax Secretion by ELISA—Culture medium harvested post-transfection was loaded onto a 96-well plate precoated with anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma). Reference standards were made with serial dilutions of purified FTH6 protein. The plate was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, washed, and incubated with anti-His6-horseradish peroxidase antibody (ab1187; Abcam) at a 1:1000 dilution at 4 °C for 2 h. Bound protein was detected using tetramethyl benzidine substrate as described by the manufacturer (Pierce) and measured using a Spectramax Plus microplate reader at 450 nm (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). Fluorescence Microscopy—For analysis of the subcellular localization of parental and mutant Tax-GFP, cells were plated in 35-mm culture plates at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/plate. Transfections were performed using 2.4 μg of parental or mutant Tax-GFP and 6 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) diluted in culture medium 20 min prior to viewing. For co-localization of Tax-YFP with cytoplasmic organelles, 2.5 × 105 cells/plate were plated in 35-mm culture plates and transfected using 6 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), 2.4 μg of Tax-YFP or Tax mutant-YFP DNA, and 1.0 μg of cyan fluorescent protein constructs (pECFP-N1 (vector control), pECFP-Nuc (nucleus), pECFP-ER (endoplasmic reticulum), or pECFP-Golgi (Golgi apparatus); Clontech). Cells were visualized using an Olympus IX-81 automated microscope equipped with the appropriate filter cubes for visualizing enhanced yellow fluorescent protein and enhanced cyan fluorescent protein or visualizing enhanced green fluorescent protein and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Images were obtained with a Cook CCD Sensicam digital camera controlled by Slide-book software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Denver, CO). All components of the microscopy system were controlled using an Apple Macintosh G4 dual 1-Ghz processor computer (Apple, Cupertino, CA). Raw fluorescent images were deconvolved (no-neighbors method) using Slidebook. Luciferase Assays—Cells were plated at a density of 8 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plates 24 h prior to transfection. Transfections were performed using 1.5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), 36 ng of pU3R-luciferase, 8.5 ng of pRL-TK, and 286 ng of either pUC18 or each of the Tax-GFP constructs. Cells were harvested, washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed with radioimmune precipitation buffer (NaCl (150 mm), Igepal (1%), deoxycholate (0.5%), and Tris (50 mm, pH 8.0)). Cell extracts were assayed for luciferase and Renilla using a Fluoroskan Ascent FL (Thermo Labsystems, Beverly, MA) as described for the dual luciferase assay system (Promega). Detection of Tax Secretion—BHK-21 cells were plated at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates 24 h prior to transfection and transfected using 4 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with 1.6 μg of either control FTH6 vector or each of the mutants.

MCMV encodes the m145 family of putative immunoevasins with predicted major histocompatibility complex, class I (MHC-I) structure. Functions attributed to some family members include down-regulation of host MHC-I (m152) and NKG2D ligands (m145, m152, and m155) and interaction with inhibitory or activating NK receptors (m157). We present the cellular, biochemical, and structural characterization of m153, which is a heavily glycosylated homodimer, that does not require β2m or peptide and is expressed at the surface of MCMV-infected cells. Its 2.4-Å crystal structure confirms that this compact molecule preserves an MHC-I-like fold and reveals a novel mode of dimerization, confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis, and a distinctive disulfide-stabilized extended N terminus. The structure provides a useful framework for comparative analysis of the divergent members of the m145 family.

The structure provides a useful framework for comparative analysis of the divergent members of the m145 family. A major strategy for immune evasion, employed by the large DNA viruses like herpes- and poxviruses, is the expression of a variety of molecules that attenuate the host's immune response. Some of these impair the cellular pathways of antigen processing and presentation, whereas others serve as decoys, mimicking host molecules crucial to natural killer (NK) 4The abbreviations used are: NK, natural killer; MHC-I, major histocompatibility class I; MCMV, mouse cytomegalovirus; HCMV, human cytomegalovirus; TAP, transporter associated with antigen processing; SeMet, selenomethionine; SAD, single anomalous dispersion; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; p.i., post infection; SEC, size exclusion chromatography; BiFC, bimolecular fluorescence complementation; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; GFP, green fluorescent protein; mAb, monoclonal antibody; HA, hemagglutinin; TLS, translation, libration, screw; NCS, non-crystallographic symmetry. or T-cell recognition (1Tortorella D.

The genome of MCMV, which serves as a model for the human virus (HCMV), encodes a set of proteins that are predicted to be structural analogs of class I major histocompatibility (MHC-I) glycoproteins (2Arase H.

The detailed function of each of these viral MHC-I-like molecules (MHC-Iv) has not yet been determined, but several examples suggest that they either down-regulate host MHC-I or MHC-I-like molecules or directly bind to NK-cell inhibitory receptors. Thus, they can interfere with key components of T-cell recognition or NK-cell activation, thereby promoting virus survival. MHC-I molecules, transmembrane cell surface receptors consisting of a heavy chain, a β2-microglobulin (β2m) light chain, and bound peptides, are poised for recognition by clonotypic αβ receptors on CD8+ T cells or by inhibitory or activating receptors on NK cells. MHC-I are classic (Ia) or non-classic (Ib) molecules based on their amino acid sequence polymorphism, function, and tissue-specific expression. The heavy chain consists of an α1α2 domain unit containing two α-helices set atop an eight-stranded β-sheet platform and an Ig-like α3 domain (5Bjorkman P.J. Parham P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 253-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). MHC-Ib molecules exhibit less polymorphism, most do not bind peptide, and they vary in their association with β2m (6Natarajan K. Li H. Mariuzza R.A. Margulies D.H. Rev. Immunogenet. 1999; 1: 32-46PubMed Google Scholar). MHC-Ib proteins function both in immune recognition and in other physiological settings (7Margulies D.H. Natarajan K. Rossjohn J. McCluskey J. Paul W.E. Fundamental Immunology. Lippincott, Williams, and Wilkins, Philadelphia2007Google Scholar). Only one MCMV protein, m144, like its HCMV counterpart UL18 (8Beck S. Barrell B.G. Nature. 1988; 331: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), is clearly related to MHC-I based on amino acid sequence similarity (9Farrell H.E. Vally H. Lynch D.M. Fleming P. Shellam G.R. Scalzo A.A. Davis-Poynter N.J. Nature. 1997; 386: 510-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). m144 allows virus-infected cells to evade the NK cell response, but its mechanism of action and the nature of any ligand remain unclear. Expression studies of m144 indicate that, unlike MHC-Ia molecules, it does not require peptide for cell surface expression (10Chapman T.L. Bjorkman P.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 460-466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Natarajan K. Hicks A. Mans J. Robinson H. Guan R. Mariuzza R.A. Margulies D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 157-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of m144 reveals an MHC-I-like protein, bound to β2m but not associated with peptide, confirming predictions based on sequence comparison. The molecule is characterized by a large angle between α1α2 and α3, a unique stabilizing disulfide bond in α1α2, and relatively loose association of the heavy chain with β2m (11Natarajan K. Hicks A. Mans J. Robinson H. Guan R. Mariuzza R.A. Margulies D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 157-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In addition to m144, MCMV encodes the eight molecules of the m145 family, all of which are predicted to have an MHC-I protein fold (2Arase H. Mocarski E.S. Campbell A.E. Hill A.B. Lanier L.L.

Four of the family members (m145, m152, m155, and m157) function as immunoevasins. m145, m152, and m155 down-regulate the cell surface expression of ligands of the activating receptor NKG2D (12Hasan M.

Alternatively it can interact with the NK-activating receptor Ly49H in strains (e.g. C57BL/6) that are resistant to MCMV infection (2Arase H. Mocarski E.S. Campbell A.E. Hill A.B. Lanier L.L.

Science. 2002; 296: 1323-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). Its crystal structure revealed several deviations from the MHC-Ia fold: an extended, helical N terminus, designated α0, that precedes the canonical α1 helix and imparts a three-helix structure to the N-terminal α1α2 domain; a long α2 helix that extends into the α3 domain; short interhelical distances and close interactions of the α1α2 domain with α3 resulting in a molecule significantly more compact than classic MHC-I; and an α3 domain whose Ig fold is less twisted than typical Ig folds (18Adams E.J. Juo Z.S. Venook R.T. Boulanger M.J. Arase H. Lanier L.L. Garcia K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 10128-10133Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The unique functions of m145, m152, m155, and m157 suggest that each member of the m145 family is important in modulating the response of the host to MCMV infection. The structural features of m144 and m157 imply that other members of the m145 family also may have evolved significant structural deviations from typical MHC-I to solve novel difficulties in their encounter with the immune system. An understanding of the evolution and function of the MHC-I-like molecules of MCMV demands examination of the cellular expression, immunological function, and molecular structure of each of these molecules. To gain further insight into another member of the m145 family, we have examined m153 in detail. We first demonstrate that m153 is a functional gene that directs the expression of its encoded protein to the surface of MCMV-infected cells. Surface expression is independent of the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) or β2m. In surprising contrast to MHC-I molecules, recombinant soluble m153 is homodimeric. The crystal structure of m153 described here reveals the mode of dimerization in addition to other distinguishing features. Thus, although prediction algorithms group members of the m145 family together within the broad MHC-I structural family, the details of the individual structures show wide variation from MHC-I and demonstrate the robustness and adaptability of the MHC-I fold in the service of diverse biological functions. NIH3T3, RMA, and RMA-S were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 5 × 10−5 m 2-mercaptoethanol, 1× non-essential amino acids (BioWhittaker), and 50 μg/ml gentamicin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. R1.1 and R1E were cultured in RPMI containing the same supplements as above. Drosophila S2 cells were maintained in Insect Express medium (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 50 μg/ml gentamicin except where mentioned otherwise. Rabbit antiserum was produced against m153 expressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli. Reduced, denatured SDS-gel-purified m153 was emulsified in complete Freund adjuvant prior to immunization. The mouse monoclonal antibody mAb153.16, generated with the extracellular domain of mature m153 (amino acids 1-314) expressed in S2 cells, stains m153-transfected cells and immunoprecipitates m153 from transfected or virus-infected cells. Insect Cell Expression—cDNA encoding the extracellular domain of the mature form of m153 (amino acids 1-314) was PCR-amplified from MCMV-infected cell culture supernatants (Smith strain, American Type Culture Collection, catalog no. VR-1399) using primers 5′GGATCCGAGGTCGTGCGGCCCGAAGTTAAC and 5′GGTACCTCAATGGTGATGGTGATGATGGCTGCCGCGCGGCACCAGGGTCAGTCTCGAATCGTTGATCGTC. A BamHI restriction site was incorporated into the forward primer, and a thrombin cleavage site (LVPRG), a His6 tag, a termination codon, and a KpnI restriction site were incorporated into the reverse primer. The m153 PCR product was directly cloned into the pCR4-Topo-TA vector (Invitrogen), the sequence was verified, and then the excised BamHI/KpnI m153 fragment was inserted in the BglII and KpnI sites of pMT-Bip-V5-His (Invitrogen). Mammalian Cell Expression—The full-length m153 gene (encoding amino acids -22-382, including the signal peptide sequence) was amplified from MCMV-infected cell culture supernatants and an N-terminal FLAG tag introduced by sequential PCR. The sequential forward primers used were: A, 5′TCAGCGGAGGTCGACTACAAGGATGACGATGACAAGGTGCGGCCCGAAGTTAACAGG; B, 5′TTGGTTCTCATCTCAGGAGGGTTCTGGGCGTGCGGCTCAGCGGAGGTCGACTACAAG; and C, 5′GCTACGGGATCCATGATTCCCCTTCTCCTTCTGCCGTTGGTTCTCATCTCAGGAGGG. The reverse primer was 5′TACGCTGAATTCTTACACCACATTCTCCTCCGTATCCGAGCA. 5′ BamHI and a 3′ EcoRI restriction sites were incorporated in the forward and reverse primers, respectively, for subsequent cloning into the pIRES-hr-GFP-II vector (Stratagene). Mammalian expression vectors encoding the N-terminal 1-154 residues (N-YFP) or the C-terminal 155-238 residues (C-YFP) of YFP were a kind gift from Dr. K. Ozato, NICHD, National Institutes of Health. m153 and m144 were amplified from existing full-length constructs using primers m153_5YFP (5′ACGGGATCCATGATTCCCCTTCTCCTTCTGCCG) and m153_3YFP (5′ACGGAATTCGCCACCACATTCTCCTCCGTATCCG), and m144 was amplified using primers m144_5YFP (5′ACGAGATCTATGAGGGCTCTGGCGCTG) and m144_3YFP (5′ACGGAATTCGCAATGCTGGGATCCGGGACCGTG). The PCR products were digested and inserted into the BglII and EcoRI sites of N-YFP and C-YFP, and the sequences were verified. The resulting constructs encode fusion proteins of m153 and m144 linked at their C termini to either the N- or C-terminal fragments of YFP. A 12- to 13-amino acid spacer separates the viral proteins from the YFP fragments. The Amaxa nucleofector (Amaxa Biosystems) was used to introduce the pIRES-hr-GFP II vector (Stratagene) encoding either FLAG-m153 or H-2Dd into R1.1 and R1E cells (solution V, program A30) or into RMA and RMA-S cells (solution T, program A30) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 18-24 h post transfection the cells were stained for surface expression of FLAG-tagged m153 with the M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) and a phycoerythrin-labeled anti-mouse IgG1 antibody (Southern Biotech). H-2Dd was detected using the phycoerythrin-labeled 34-5-8S antibody (BD Biosciences). Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences). 70% confluent NIH3T3 cells were infected with MCMV-GFP (a virus containing GFP at an innocuous site (19Mathys S. Schroeder T. Ellwart J. Koszinowski U.H. Messerle M. Just U. J. Infect. Dis. 2003; 187: 988-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar)) at a multiplicity of infection of two. Twenty-four hours post infection (p.i.) the cells were detached with a non-enzymatic cell dissociation solution (Cellstripper, Cellgro) and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% fetal calf serum and 0.1% NaN3. F(ab′)2 fragments were generated from monoclonal antibody mAb153.16 with the Immunopure IgG1 F(ab′)2 kit (Pierce). Infected and uninfected cells were incubated with the F(ab′)2 followed by anti-mouse IgG-allophycocyanin. Dead cells were excluded by propidium iodide gating. Cells were analyzed with a FACSCalibur, and virus-infected cells were gated on GFP expression. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with 153-N-YFP and 153-C-YFP or 144-N-YFP and 144-C-YFP using the Amaxa nucleofector (solution R, program U30). Cells were then seeded on chambered coverslides and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C. A Leica TCS AOBS SP2 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems) equipped with a 63 × 1.4 numerical aperture PL APO objective was used to examine live cells at room temperature for YFP fluorescence complementation. Leica TCS v2.1547 software was used to capture the images. After analysis the cells were detached with trypsin, and the YFP-positive cells were quantified by flow cytometry. Transiently transfected and virus-infected cell lines were processed for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting as detailed in the supplemental “Experimental Procedures.” The pMT-Bip-m153-His construct together with puromycin and blasticidin resistance-encoding plasmids (10:1:1 ratio by weight) were transfected into S2 cells using Fugene6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 48 h after transfection the cells were transferred to selective medium containing 5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) and 5 μg/ml blasticidin (Calbiochem). Resistant cells were maintained in selective medium in shaker cultures (28 °C, 100 rpm). Expression of m153 was induced with 1 mm CuSO4 at a cell density of 2 × 107/ml. m153 was purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen) and then subjected to SEC (Shodex KW802.5 or Amersham Biosciences Superdex 75). The His tag was removed by thrombin cleavage at 37 °C for 2 h, and the protein was purified by anion exchange chromatography (Mono Q, Amersham Biosciences). For preparation of a selenomethionine (SeMet) derivative of m153, the m153/S2 cells were grown in Orbigen insect cell medium to 2 × 107 cells/ml. The cells were then washed in methionine-free medium (Orbigen) and starved in this medium for 6 h under normal growth conditions. Protein expression was induced by simultaneous addition of 1 mm CuSO4 and 60 μg/ml SeMet (Sigma). The SeMet-labeled protein was purified as described for the native protein. Crystals of the SeMet derivative of m153 were grown in hanging drops at 18 °C over 25% polyethylene glycol 2000 MME, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8 (Solution 24, The PEGs Suite, Qia-gen). Addition of 0.5% β-d-maltoside to the drops yielded crystals that diffracted to 2.3 Å. Diffraction data for SAD phasing were collected on a single crystal on beamline X29A at the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven, at a wave-length of 0.9791 Å and processed with HKL2000 (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38609) Google Scholar). The automated SOLVE/RESOLVE scripts as incorporated in the AutoSol module of the PHENIX suite (21Adams P.D. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Hung L.W. Ioerger T.R. McCoy A.J. Moriarty N.W. Read R.J. Sacchettini J.C. Sauter N.K. Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3664) Google Scholar) were used with data truncated at 2.8 Å to obtain SAD phases followed by automated model building and docking to the m153 sequence. Ambiguously placed residues were rebuilt manually into the SAD-phased map in Coot as alanines (22Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23605) Google Scholar). To extend the resolution to 2.4 Å a molecular replacement search was carried out in Phaser (23Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar) with the partially built model yielding Z-scores of 11.0 and 23.7 for the rotation and translation functions, respectively, for one dimer in the asymmetric unit. Rigid body refinement specifying α1α2 and α3 as separate domains yielded a model with initial R and Rfree of 36.9% and 38.6%, respectively. Refinement at 2.4 Å was continued in Refmac5 (24Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13911) Google Scholar) with tight NCS restraints between chains A and B with further model building guided by 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc maps generated in Coot. Although data were collected to 2.3 Å, data in the 2.38-2.3 shell were of insufficient quality and completeness. Therefore only data to 2.4 Å were used in refinement. Residues in the 231-237 loop, which had little or no electron density, were omitted from the NCS restraints. Optimal domains for TLS refinement were identified and input files for TLS refinement were generated using the TLSMD web server (25Painter J. Merritt E.A. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). TLS refinement using 10 TLS groups per chain decreased Rfree from 29.9% to 28%. Finally, waters were added with CNS (26Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar), and a final round of refinement was performed without NCS restraints. The final model has Rcryst = 23% and Rfree = 27.9%, includes residues 2-230 and 238-277 of chain A and residues 5-277 of chain B and has 57 waters. The atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (27Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27906) Google Scholar) under accession number 2O5N. Buried surface area calculations were performed in CNS. Figures were generated using PyMOL, according to the manufacturer’s manual (28DeLano W.L. The PyMOL User's Manual. DeLano Scientific, Palo Alto, CA2002Google Scholar). Hinge angles were calculated using HINGE, a program written by Peter Sun. HINGE calculates an ellipsoid (defined by axes a, b, and c) for each indicated domain and reports the angle between the long axes of the adjacent domains as the hinge angle. HINGE is available at http://sis.niaid.nih.gov/programs/hinge.html. Alanine mutations were introduced simultaneously at four residues (Thr-128, Ser-131, Arg-225, and Ser-241) in the m153-N-YFP construct using the QuikChange Multi mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Wild-type and mutated m153 (residues -22-382) genes were PCR-amplified from the m153-N-YFP and m153-N-YFP-mutant constructs using primers 5′CGTCACCCATGGCAATTCCCCTTCTCCTTCTGCCGTTGGTTCTC and 5′ACTTCGCTCGAGGGTGAGTCTCGAATCGTTGATCGTCCTCTG. The PCR products were digested with NcoI and XhoI and inserted into the corresponding sites of the pIEx-4 SF9 expression vector (Novagen). 200 μg of m153-pIEx-4 or quadruple mutant-m153-pIEx-4 were transfected into 1 × 108 exponentially growing SF9 cells in 100 ml with 1 ml of Insect GeneJuice transfection reagent (Novagen). 72 h after transfection the cell supernatants were collected. Wild-type and quadruple mutant m153 were then purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid and SEC columns as described for S2 insect cell expression. Sedimentation velocity experiments were conducted with a ProteomeLab XLI ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter). 400-μl samples were loaded at concentrations of 0.3 mg/ml for m153 wild-type and 0.5 and 0.1 mg/ml for the m153 mutant and centrifuged at 50,000 rpm at 20 °C. Sedimentation data were acquired with the Ray-leigh interference optical system at 1-min intervals, and data were analyzed using SEDFIT software (29Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3087) Google Scholar). m153 Is Expressed on the Surface of MCMV-infected Fibroblasts—The open reading frame of the m153 gene predicts a type I transmembrane glycoprotein with a core molecular mass of 45 kDa. As a first step in the functional characterization of m153, we examined its expression in MCMV-infected fibroblasts. NIH3T3 cells, infected with MCMV at a multiplicity of infection of 2, expressed readily detectable levels of m153 at the cell surface 24 h p.i. as detected by the monoclonal antibody mAb153.16, specific for the extracellular domain of m153 (Fig. 1A). Uninfected cells did not stain with this antibody. By immunoprecipitation m153 was detected in lysates of infected cells as early as 3 and up to 48 h after infection with protein levels peaking at 24 h p.i. (data not shown). Immunoprecipitation of cell lysates followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis of m153 revealed an unexpectedly high apparent molecular mass of 80 kDa, which was decreased to 45 kDa upon deglycosylation with peptide N-glycosidase F (Fig. 1B). Such heavy glycosylation is consistent with six predicted sites for asparaginyl-carbohydrate addition. Cell Surface Expression of m153 Is Independent of β2m or TAP Expression—Because the MHC-I fold was predicted for all members of the MCMV m145 family (4Smith H.R. Heusel J.W. Mehta I.K. Kim S. Dorner B.G. Naidenko O.V. Iizuka K. Furukawa H. Beckman D.L. Pingel J.T. Scalzo A.A. Fremont D.H. Yokoyama W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8826-8831Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar), we next determined whether m153 shares the requirements of classic MHC-I molecules for β2m and peptide for stable expression. To investigate its requirement for β2m, we transfected N-terminally FLAG-tagged m153 (FLAG-m153) into a cell line deficient in β2m (R1E (30Allen H. Fraser J. Flyer D. Calvin S. Flavell R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7447-7451Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar)) as well as itsβ2m-sufficient counterpart (R1.1). m153 surface expression was equivalent in both cell types indicating that m153 does not require β2m for stable surface expression (Fig. 1C). To evaluate the requirement for bound peptide, we examined surface expression of m153 in RMA-S, a TAP-deficient cell line that fails to transfer peptides from the cytosol to the endoplasmic reticulum (31Townsend A. Ohlen C. Foster L. Bastin J. Ljunggren H.G. Karre K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1989; 54: 299-308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MHC-Ia molecules expressed in such cells are unstable at the cell surface. We transfected RMA-S and RMA (TAP+) cells with FLAG-m153 and evaluated surface expression of the viral protein in comparison to transfected H-2Dd, an MHC-Ia molecule (Fig. 1D). TAP deficiency had no effect on m153 surface expression, whereas expression of H-2Dd was clearly reduced. We conclude that m153 does not require β2m or bound peptide for stable surface expression. MHC-I Fold of m153—To elucidate the structure of m153 an SeMet derivative was prepared by biosynthetic labeling of the protein expressed in Drosophila S2 cells. SEC indicated that soluble m153 was a dimer (supplemental Fig. S1). Diffraction data from a single crystal were collected, the structure was solved by SAD phasing, and the model was refined at 2.4-Å resolution to final Rcryst and Rfree of 23 and 27.9, respectively (Table 1). There is a single dimer in the asymmetric unit with chains designated A and B. We observed continuous electron density for residues 2-230 and 238-277 of chain A and residues 5-277 of chain B. No electron density was observed for the C-terminal residues 278-314 of either chain, and these were omitted from the model. The average B-factor was 42 Å2 for chain A and 32 Å2 for chain B. We selected chain B to describe the structural features of the monomer as they relate to the MHC-I fold, because it is more complete and has lower B-factor values.TABLE 1Data collection, refinement, and validation statisticsData collectionSpace groupP21Unit cell dimensionsa, b, c61.7, 78.2, 62,7α, β, γ90, 90.4, 90.0Molecules per asymmetric unit2Resolution (Å)2.3Total observations335,101Unique reflections26,191Completeness (%)aValues in parentheses are statistics for the highest resolution shell used in refinement (2.48-2.38 Å).97.5 (94.2)I/σIaValues in parentheses are statistics for the highest resolution shell used in refinement (2.48-2.38 Å).9.7 (2.0)RsymaValues in parentheses are statistics for the highest resolution shell used in refinement (2.48-2.38 Å).,bRsym(I) = ∑|Ij - <I>|/∑Ij, where Ij is the intensity of the jth observation of a reflection and <I> is the mean intensity from multiple measurements of that reflection.0.081 (0.44)RefinementResolution range62.75-2.4ReflectionsWorking set23,443Test set1183Rcryst (%)cRcryst = ∑||Fo| - |Fc||/∑|Fo|, where Fo and Fc are the observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2014406778,"Neonates are clearly more susceptible to severe disease following infection with a variety of pathogens than are adults. However, the causes for this are unclear and are often attributed to immunological immaturity. While several aspects of immunity differ between adults and neonates, the capacity of dendritic cells in neonates to process and present antigen to CD8+ T cells remains to be addressed. We used human CD8+ T cell clones to compare the ability of neonatal and adult monocyte-derived dendritic cells to present or process and present antigen using the MHC class I pathway. Specifically, we assessed the ability of dendritic cells to present antigenic peptide, present an HLA-E–restricted antigen, process and present an MHC class I-restricted antigen through the classical MHC class I pathway, and cross present cell-associated antigen via MHC class I. We found no defect in neonatal dendritic cells to perform any of these processing and presentation functions and conclude that the MHC class I antigen processing and presentation pathway is functional in neonatal dendritic cells and hence may not account for the diminished control of pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2033832693,"The vertebrate nucleoporin Nup98 can be expressed in two distinct forms from differentially spliced mRNAs, either as a 98-kDa protein or as the 195-kDa Nup98/Nup96 polyprotein. Both forms undergo autoproteolytic processing to generate the 90-kDa Nup98 and either an 8-kDa tail or the nucleoporin Nup96. An equivalent cleavage event occurs in one yeast ortholog, Nup145, to produce Nup145N and Nup145C. We previously proposed that Nup145N, and possibly the other orthologs Nup116 and Nup100, might bind to Nup145C as demonstrated for Nup98 and Nup96. Here we have further investigated the interaction of both yeast and vertebrate Gly-Leu-Phe-Gly nucleoporins with the nuclear pore. We find that dynamic Nup98 binding can be recapitulated in vitro and that simultaneous translation and folding as a polyprotein are not required to allow subsequent binding between Nup98 and Nup96. We show that Nup145N and Nup145C do indeed bind to each other, and we have determined the dissociation constants for these interactions in vitro. Additionally, we characterize two sites of molecular interaction for each binding pair. Of the yeast orthologs, Nup116 binds far less robustly to Nup145C than does Nup145N, and Nup100 binding is barely detectable. Thus, we conclude that Nup116 and Nup100 likely use means of incorporation into the nuclear pore complex that are distinct from those used by Nup145N.

Transport between the nucleus and cytoplasm of a eukaryotic cell is mediated by nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), 2The abbreviations used are: NPC, nuclear pore complex; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase. 2The abbreviations used are: NPC, nuclear pore complex; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase. highly selective gateways embedded in the nuclear envelope. NPCs are composed of about 30 different protein species, known as nucleoporins or Nups. Each NPC has numerous copies of each nucleoporin and an approximate total mass of 40 or 60 MDa in yeast or metazoans, respectively. Structural studies, most recently by cryoelectron microscopy, have revealed with considerable detail an NPC with 8-fold symmetry about an axis perpendicular to the plane of the nuclear envelope (1Beck M. Forster F. Ecke M. Plitzko J.M. Melchior F. Gerisch G. Baumeister W. Medalia O. Science. 2004; 306: 1387-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 2Tran E.J. Wente S.R.

The central core region containing most of the mass of the complex consists of rings on each face of the nuclear envelope with spokes in between. Fibrils extend from the rings into either the cytoplasm or nucleoplasm and on the nucleoplasmic face join to form a basket-like structure. Nups of the core region are distributed symmetrically with respect to the plane of the envelope, whereas the cytoplasmic and nuclear fibrils are each composed of a distinct set of nucleoporins. In yeast, a few Nups have been shown to have a biased distribution relative to the nuclear envelope, being enriched on but not exclusive to one face or the other (4Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Suprapto A. Hjertaas K. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 635-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). Many Nups associate into subcomplexes that act as building blocks in NPC assembly, underscoring the modular nature of this symmetrical structure (2Tran E.J. Wente S.R. Cell. 2006; 125: 1041-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 5Schwartz T.U. Curr. Opin. Struct.

A. 2006; 103: 2172-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Additionally there are interspersed throughout the NPC a class of Nups containing repeat domains, each with many copies of the sequence Phe-Gly (FG) or variants of this sequence such as FXFG (were X is any amino acid) or Gly-Leu-Phe-Gly (GLFG). These domains function as natively unstructured regions responsible for interaction with transport receptors (7Denning D.P. Patel S.S. Uversky V. Fink A.L. Rexach M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2450-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 8Bayliss R. Littlewood T. Stewart M.

Cell. 2007; 129: 83-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), and for the association of some nucleoporins with the pore (11Griffis E.R. Craige B. Dimaano C. Ullman K.S. Powers M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1991-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 12Stochaj U. Banski P. Kodiha M. Matusiewicz N. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 2490-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The preceding findings present a static, architectural picture of the NPC. However, more recent studies in vertebrate cells indicate that NPC structure is, at least in part, dynamic. Although many Nups reside stably in the pore, others associate more transiently, and, in some cases, shuttle between nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments (13Griffis E.R. Altan N. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Powers M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1282-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 14Rabut G. Doye V. Ellenberg J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1114-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). To fully understand the function of the NPC, it will be necessary to characterize the molecular structures of the individual nucleoporins and the nature of the interactions between them, both stable and dynamic. One case in which interaction between two nucleoporins has been described at the molecular level is the pore-targeting interaction of the Nup98 C-terminal domain with Nup96. Nup98 is the sole GLFG repeat nucleoporin in metazoans, although there is a family of orthologs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Nup145, Nup116, and Nup100. Nup98 is found on both cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic faces of the NPC and is a relatively dynamic Nup (13Griffis E.R. Altan N. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Powers M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1282-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 14Rabut G. Doye V. Ellenberg J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1114-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Nup98 can be translated from two major alternatively spliced mRNA transcripts. The shorter transcript encodes a 920-amino acid, 98-kDa protein. The larger transcript encodes a 195-kDa Nup98/Nup96 polyprotein (Fig. 1). Post-translationally, both proteins are cleaved by cis-autoproteolysis to yield an N-terminal cleavage product of 90 kDa (generally referred to as Nup98) and a C-terminal cleavage product of either a 57 amino acid peptide (referred to here as the Nup98 “tail”) or the nucleoporin Nup96, which is identical in its first 51 amino acid residues to the Nup98 tail (15Fontoura B.M. Blobel G. Matunis M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1097-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). An equivalent cleavage event takes place in the yeast ortholog, Nup145, yielding the nucleoporins Nup145N and Nup145C (16Teixeira M.T. Siniossoglou S. Podtelejnikov S. Benichou J.C. Mann M. Dujon B.

Chem. 1999; 274: 32439-32444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Two other yeast orthologs, Nup100 and Nup116, are homologous only to the N-terminal cleavage product, Nup98, and do not carry out autoproteolysis. The targeting of Nup98 to the NPC is, in part, through binding between its C-terminal domain and Nup96 (18Griffis E.R. Xu S. Powers M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 600-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 19Hodel A.E. Hodel M.R. Griffis E.R. Hennig K.A. Ratner G.A. Xu S. Powers M.A. Mol.

Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 339-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and in keeping with this, the products of Nup98 autoproteolysis can bind each other noncovalently in vitro. Because of the sequence identity between the Nup98 tail and Nup96, both bind identically to Nup98 and can compete with each other for binding (18Griffis E.R. Xu S. Powers M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 600-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Therefore in vivo, if Nup98 is expressed from the smaller transcript, the tail peptide must be released to allow Nup98 to associate with Nup96 at the NPC (18Griffis E.R. Xu S. Powers M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 600-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 19Hodel A.E. Hodel M.R. Griffis E.R. Hennig K.A. Ratner G.A. Xu S. Powers M.A. Mol.

Furthermore, although Nup96 incorporates into a large and highly stable subcomplex of the NPC, Nup96 expressed in vivo independently of Nup98 did not enter the nucleus and did not incorporate into NPCs with normal efficiency (15Fontoura B.M. Blobel G. Matunis M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1097-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Thus, proper assembly of Nup98 and Nup96 into the NPC requires a complex series of interactions and processing. The crystal structure of the Nup98 C-terminal domain revealed molecular details of the binding interaction between Nup98 and Nup96. Binding is mediated in large part by interactions between the first seven residues of the tail/Nup96 and a binding groove in Nup98 (19Hodel A.E. Hodel M.R. Griffis E.R. Hennig K.A. Ratner G.A. Xu S. Powers M.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 347-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In addition, a run of acidic residues in the tail/Nup96, although not directly visible in the structure, were constrained to lie in proximity to a basic patch in Nup98; electrostatic interactions in this region would further contribute to binding between Nup98 and Nup96. Amino acids involved in both autocatalysis and binding are generally conserved between yeast Nup145 and human Nup98. We, therefore, postulated that Nup145N and Nup145C were likely to interact analogously at the yeast NPC (19Hodel A.E. Hodel M.R. Griffis E.R. Hennig K.A. Ratner G.A. Xu S. Powers M.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 347-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Although Nup116 and Nup100 lack residues required for autocatalytic cleavage, molecular modeling predicts some structural similarity to both Nup98 and Nup145N, including conservation of the patch of basic amino acids. Thus, Nup145C might act also as a binding site for Nup116 and Nup100 in addition to Nup145N. Here we have further investigated the nature of the interactions between these GLFG nucleoporins and the NPC. We find that the dynamics of the Nup98/Nup96 interaction can be recapitulated in vitro using purified protein domains, indicating that additional factors are not required to facilitate such exchange. Binding can occur between the independently expressed Nup98 pore-targeting domain and the Nup98 tail/Nup96 fragment, suggesting that simultaneous translation and folding are not required to produce the appropriate structural folds. Using fluorescence polarization, we have determined the binding constant for this interaction. Furthermore, we extended our analysis to the yeast GLFG orthologs and find that, as expected, Nup145N utilizes the same mechanism for interaction with Nup145C. However, despite sharing considerable sequence homology, Nup116 binds far less robustly to Nup145C, and significant binding between Nup100 and Nup145C was not detected, suggesting that these nucleoporins use, at least in part, distinct means of incorporation into the NPC. Production of Recombinant Proteins—For expression of GST fusions, fragments of Nup98, Nup145, Nup100, or Nup116 genes were cloned into pGEX-4T vectors and expressed in BL21(DE3) cells induced at either 37 °C for 3 h or 17°C overnight. Frozen cell pellets from 1 liter of culture were resuspended in binding buffer 1 (BB1; 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA) with 0.1% Triton X-100 and COMPLETE protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) to a final volume of 15 ml/liter of culture and lysed in a French press. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and clarified lysates were either frozen for later use or incubated with glutathione-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) at 700 μl of beads/liter of culture for 1 h at 4°C. The beads were washed extensively, first in BB1 with 0.1% Triton-X and then in BB1 alone. Bound fusion proteins were eluted with 100 mm reduced glutathione in 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, and dialyzed against BB1. Products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining and judged to have purity in excess of 90%. Purified proteins or clarified lysates were stored in aliquots at –80 °C after addition of glycerol to 7% final concentration. To produce C-terminal GFP fusions, fragments of Nup96, Nup98/96, Nup145, or Nup145C were cloned upstream of a modified GFP2 gene (21Prasher D.C. Eckenrode V.K. Ward W.W. Prendergast F.G. Cormier M.J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 111: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar) in pET-28a and expressed in BL21(DE3) cells induced at 37° for 3 h. For purification of GFP-hexahistidine-tagged proteins, frozen cell pellets were resuspended in nickel binding buffer consisting of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and lysed in a French press. After the pelleting of insoluble material, the protein was bound to a HiTrap chelating column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with a gradient of 0–500 mm imidazole in nickel binding buffer. Fractions containing the protein were pooled and dialyzed against BB1 containing 10% glycerol, separated into aliquots, and stored at –80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay with bovine serum albumin as a protein standard. Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene; Austin, TX), and mutations were verified by sequencing. Mutant proteins were expressed and purified as described above. Bead Binding Assays—For trans binding assays, 75 μgof purified GST-fusion protein and 37.5 μl of washed glutathione-Sepharose beads in a total volume of 250 μl of BB1 were incubated for 75 min at 4 °C. After incubation, beads were pelleted and washed 3 times in cold BB1 with 0.1% Triton X and once with BB1 alone. 1.5 mg of purified tail-GFP-His-tagged protein in 500 μl of BB1 was then added to the washed beads and incubated for 3 h at 4°C to allow binding. After incubation, beads were pelleted and washed once in BB1 with 0.1% Triton-X and 3 times with BB1 alone. Bound proteins were then eluted by boiling in Laemmli gel sample buffer (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar) and analyzed on 14% acrylamide gels followed by Coomassie Blue R250 staining. Final loads were adjusted to give approximately equal amounts of GST head protein. For exchange binding assays, 37.5 μl of washed beads were added to 500 μl of clarified lysate containing GST fusion protein, corresponding to 80 ml of expression culture. These samples were incubated to allow binding and washed in the same manner as the trans binding assays. 1.5 mg of purified GFP-His-tagged protein in 1 ml of BB1 was then added to the washed beads, and the samples were incubated, washed, and processed in the same manner as trans binding assays. For immunoblots of bead binding assays, proteins were transferred from polyacrylamide gels to Immobilon membranes (Millipore; Billirica, MA), and tail fragments were detected using a mouse antibody against the hexahistidine tag (H-15; Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Santa Cruz, CA) and goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Zymed Laboratories Inc.; South San Francisco, CA). Fluorescence Polarization Assays—For polarization assays, three fluorescently labeled peptides (sequences given in Table 1) were prepared by solid phase peptide synthesis at the Keck Biotechnology Resource Center at Yale University, New Haven, CT. After the actual Nup96 or Nup145C sequence, each peptide terminates with a diglycine linker followed by an ϵ-(5/6-carboxyfluorescein)-l-lysine residue, referred to as K(fam), and a final glycine required C-terminal to K(fam) in the synthetic process. High performance liquid chromatography analysis revealed no significant peaks other than those corresponding to the intended products.TABLE 1Binding constants for analogs of autoproteolytic nucleoporin cleavage productsN-terminal fragmentC-terminal peptideC-terminal peptide sequenceKdμmNup98Nup98/96 β-strand plus acidic residuesSKYGLQDSDEEEEEGGK*G0.11 ± 0.01Nup98Nup98/96 β-strand onlySKYGLQDSGGK*G2.6 ± 0.1Nup98Nup145 β-strand plus acidic residuesSIWGLVNEEDAEIDEDDGGK*G0.25 ± 0.01Nup145Nup145 β-strand plus acidic residuesSIWGLVNEEDAEIDEDDGGK*G0.12 ± 0.01Nup145Nup98/96 β-strand plus acidic residuesSKYGLQDSDEEEEEGGK*G0.16 ± 0.01Nup145Nup98/96 β-strand onlySKYGLQDSGGK*G1.6 ± 0.1Nup116Nup145 β-strand plus acidic residuesSIWGLVNEEDAEIDEDDGGK*G1.3 ± 0.1Nup100Nup145 β-strand plus acidic residuesSIWGLVNEEDAEIDEDDGGK*G36 ± 1 Open table in a new tab To obtain binding curves, purified GST head fragments in concentrations ranging from 1 nm to greater than 50 μm were incubated at room temperature with 1.0 × 10–8 m fluoresceinated peptide in BB1 for at least 2.75 h to reach full equilibrium. Fluorescence polarization was measured at 25 °C over 15 read cycles on a Beacon 2000 Fluorescence Polarization System (Invitrogen). For each combination of head fragment and tail peptide, measurements were made at 20 or more different concentrations of head protein resulting from serial dilutions of 1:1.6. Fluorescent peptide was kept at 1.0 × 10–8 m in all incubations. Four independent dilution series were prepared for each combination of head fragment and tail peptide unless otherwise indicated. A binding constant, KD, was determined for each binding curve by nonlinear least squares fitting using ProFit software (QuantumSoft; Uetikon am See, Switzerland) and Equation 1, θ=(HT+KD+TT)-(-HT-KD-TT)2-4HTTT2TT(Eq. 1) where θ is the fraction of tail protein bound given as the fraction of the polarization maximum observed at saturating concentrations of head protein, HT is the total concentration of head protein, bound and unbound, in each reaction, and TT equals 10.0 nm, i.e. the total concentration of tail peptide, both bound and unbound, in each reaction. Nup98 is one of a subset of nucleoporins that undergo dynamic interactions with the nuclear pore. Nup98 is unique among nucleoporins in that the precise site of its interaction with the pore has been determined at the molecular level (18Griffis E.R. Xu S. Powers M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 600-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 19Hodel A.E. Hodel M.R. Griffis E.R. Hennig K.A. Ratner G.A. Xu S. Powers M.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 347-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The Nup98 C-terminal domain undergoes an autocatalytic cleavage that releases either an 8-kDa protein tail or the nucleoporin Nup96 depending upon whether Nup98 was expressed as a single protein or as the polyprotein precursor, Nup98/Nup96 (Fig. 1 and Fontoura et al. (15Fontoura B.M. Blobel G. Matunis M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1097-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar)). After cleavage, Nup98 remains bound to amino acid residues immediately after the cleavage site. These residues are identical in either the tail peptide or the N terminus of Nup96, and this binding to Nup96 is thought to be the major site of Nup98 interaction with the NPC. To advance our understanding of the dynamic nature of the NPC, we set out to both further characterize the binding interaction between Nup98 and Nup96 and to extend our analysis to the orthologous yeast GLFG nucleoporins. In Vitro Binding Is Dynamic and Does Not Require Simultaneous Protein Folding—Initially it was uncertain whether dynamics of the interaction between Nup98 and the tail peptide/Nup96 would be recapitulated in vitro or whether some additional factor might be required to release the tail peptide from Nup98. To test this we developed an exchange binding assay in which a GST-tagged Nup98 NPC-targeting domain including the cleavage site and tail peptide (amino acids 712–920; “GST-head-tail”) was bound to glutathione beads and then incubated with a second form of this same Nup98 domain in which the tail peptide was fused to GFP (Fig. 2A; “head-tail-GFP”). After incubation, the beads with bound GST-Nup98 head were retrieved, and the presence of the tail-GFP fragment was assessed by gel electrophoresis as an indication of dynamic exchange between the head and tail fragments. When the GST was fused to a wild type Nup98 head-tail construct, which could undergo autocatalytic cleavage to separate head and tail fragments, there was clearly dynamic exchange in which some of the original tail peptide was replaced by tail-GFP (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4). When GST was fused to a mutant form of Nup98 (S864A), which we had previously shown to be inactive for autocatalytic cleavage and release of the tail (19Hodel A.E. Hodel M.R. Griffis E.R. Hennig K.A. Ratner G.A. Xu S. Powers M.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 347-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), there was no exchange, and no tail-GFP was recovered on the beads (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 6). We concluded, therefore, that dynamic interaction between Nup98 and the tail/Nup96 residues downstream of the cleavage site did not require additional factors from the NPC; the interaction remained dynamic in vitro. The autocatalytic activity of Nup98 identifies it as a member of a family of self-processing proteases that includes both intein and NTN proteins (for review, see Ref. 23Perler F.B. Xu M.Q. Paulus H. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1997; 1: 292-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It has been suggested for some members of this family that expression as a polyprotein followed by autocatalytic cleavage to separate the components is necessary to obtain protein conformations that can only be achieved by simultaneous folding as a single polypeptide (24Xu Q. Buckley D. Guan C. Guo H.C. Cell. 1999; 98: 651-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Such conformations would not be obtainable from components expressed independently and then combined, as was shown in the case of glycosyl asparaginase (25Riikonen A. Tikkanen R. Jalanko A. Peltonen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4903-4907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Similarly, simultaneous folding in the form of Nup98 with its tail peptide or the Nup98/Nup96 polyprotein might be essential for Nup98 and Nup96 to achieve conformations that allow correct recognition of each other as binding partners. To test this possibility, we used a trans binding assay (Fig. 2B) in which GST-Nup98 head truncated at the site of cleavage (amino acids 712–863) was bound to glutathione beads and incubated together with independently expressed tail-GFP (amino acids 864–920). The ability of the proteins to bind each other was queried by retrieval of the beads and detection of bound tail-GFP by PAGE and Coomassie staining. Expression in bacteria leads to removal of the initiator methionine, thus leaving the authentic serine as the first residue of the tail-GFP construct. When these separately produced partners were mixed, we found that the two components had each independently folded into a conformation that was compatible with binding; tail-GFP was retrieved on glutathione beads along with GST-head (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 3). As before, the non-cleavable mutant head, which cannot release the tail peptide, did not bind the tail-GFP protein (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 5). Nup98/Nup96 Binding Constant Determined by Fluorescence Polarization—Because we appeared to have recapitulated authentic dynamic binding in vitro, we next determined the binding constant for this interaction. For these measurements, we used fluorescence polarization assays in which GST-Nup98 head (amino acids 712–863) was incubated with a synthetic fluorescent peptide corresponding to the first 14 amino acids of the tail/Nup96 followed by a diglycine linker and a fluorescently labeled lysine residue (see the sequence in Table 1). This sequence includes the tail/Nup96 residues previously observed by crystallography to directly bind to Nup98 as well as the stretch of acidic residues we predicted to be positioned for interaction with a cluster of basic residues in Nup98 (Ref. 19Hodel A.E. Hodel M.R. Griffis E.R. Hennig K.A. Ratner G.A. Xu S. Powers M.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 347-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar and Table 1). The binding curve obtained from the polarization assays indicated a dissociation constant of 0.11 μm (Fig. 3 and Table 1). When the tail peptide was shortened by removal of the acidic residues, the binding constant increased ∼10-fold to 1.3 μm, indicating a significant contribution of the acidic residues to binding. S. cerevisiae Nup145N and Nup145C Bind Each Other in a Manner Equivalent to Nup98/Nup96—In the budding yeast S. cerevisiae, Nup98 has three orthologs Nup145, Nup116, and Nup100 (26Suntharalingam M. Wente S.R. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 775-789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Of these three proteins, only Nup145 undergoes autocatalytic cleavage to yield Nup145N and Nup145C. Nup145N resembles Nup98 in both the C-terminal and GLFG repeat domains, although it lacks a binding site for the mRNA export factor Rae1/Gle2 (Fig. 1). It is not established whether Nup145N interacts stably or dynamically with the yeast NPC; however, based upon our results with Nup98, we predicted that Nup145N would bind to the post-cleavage N terminus of Nup145C. To test this possibility, we expressed GST-Nup145N (amino acids 439–605; head) and Nup145C (amino acids 606–631; tail-GFP) constructs analogous to the GST-Nup98 head and Nup98 tail-GFP proteins and utilized these in both exchange (Fig. 4A, left panel) and trans (Fig. 4A, right panel) binding assays. Like Nup98, Nup145 fragments undergo dynamic interactions in vitro and are capable of binding each other efficiently when expressed in trans. As expected, the homologous uncleavable mutation in Nup145 (S606A) was completely unable to bind to the Nup145 tail-GFP in an exchange assay (Fig. 4A, lanes 4 and 5 and lanes 8 and 9). To further test our prediction that the post-cleavage interaction between Nup145N and Nup145C is equivalent to the interaction seen for Nup98 and Nup96, we synthesized a fluorescent Nup145C peptide analogous to the Nup98 tail peptide for fluorescence polarization binding analysis (27Checovich W.J. Bolger R.E. Burke T. Nature. 1995; 375: 254-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). This peptide corresponded to the first 17 amino acids of Nup145C including the cluster of acidic residues (Table 1). Binding to the Nup145 head resulted in a binding curve with a dissociation constant of 0.12 μm (Fig. 4B and Table 1). This value is remarkably similar to that obtained from the Nup98 assays, suggesting an equivalent and conserved binding interaction. Indeed, we found that the Nup98 head could bind to the Nup145 tail with only slightly more than a 2-fold decrease in affinity compared with binding between the Nup98 head and Nup98 tail (Fig. 3 and Table 1). Conversely, the Nup145N head construct bound the Nup98 tail with virtually the same affinity as it bound its natural partner (Fig. 4B and Table 1). Again, there was a clear contribution of the acidic residues to both these heterologous interactions since, in their absence, the affinity of binding between the Nup145N head and the Nup98 tail was reduced 10-fold exactly as had been observed for binding between th"

Despite the progress in DNA vaccine development, the intracellular transport and fate of naked plasmid DNA in eukaryotic cells is poorly understood, and need to be clarified in order to facilitate the development of novel vectors and vaccine strategies.Using confocal microscopy, we have demonstrated for the first time that after plasmid DNA uptake an inhibition of the acidification of the lysosomal compartment occurs. This lack of acidification impaired antigen presentation to CD4 T cells, but did not alter the recruitment of MyD88. The recruitment of Rab 5 and Lamp I were also altered since we were not able to co-localize plasmid DNA with Rab 5 and Lamp I in early endosomes and late endosomes/lysosomes, respectively. Furthermore, we observed that the DNA capture process in macrophages was by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In addition, we observed that plasmid DNA remains in vesicles until it is in a juxtanuclear location, suggesting that the plasmid does not escape into the cytoplasmic compartment.Taken together our data suggests a novel mechanism involved in the intracellular trafficking of plasmid DNA, and opens new possibilities for the use of lower doses of plasmid DNA to regulate the immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2053934383,"Social scientists have suggested that cultural diversity in a nation leads to societal instability. However, societal instability may be affected not only by within-nation or alpha diversity, but also diversity between a nation and its neighbours or beta diversity. It is also necessary to distinguish different domains of diversity, namely linguistic, ethnic and religious, and to distinguish between the direct effects of diversity on societal instability, and effects that are mediated by economic conditions.We assembled a large cross-national dataset with information on alpha and beta cultural diversity, economic conditions, and indices of societal instability. Structural equation modeling was used to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of cultural diversity on economics and societal stability. Results show that different types and domains of diversity have interacting effects. As previously documented, linguistic alpha diversity has a negative effect on economic performance, and we show that it is largely through this economic mechanism that it affects societal instability. For beta diversity, the higher the linguistic diversity among nations in a region, the less stable the nation. But, religious beta diversity has the opposite effect, reducing instability, particularly in the presence of high linguistic diversity.Within-nation linguistic diversity is associated with reduced economic performance, which, in turn, increases societal instability. Nations which differ linguistically from their neighbors are also less stable. However, religious diversity between neighboring nations has the opposite effect, decreasing societal instability."
https://openalex.org/W2071819261,"Dendritic localization of mRNA/RNA involves interaction of cis-elements and trans-factors. Small, non-protein coding dendritic BC1 RNA is thought to regulate translation in dendritic microdomains. Following microinjections into cultured cells, BC1 RNA fused to larger mRNAs appeared to impart transport competence to these chimeras, and its 5′ ID region was proposed as the cis-acting dendritic targeting element. As these ID elements move around rodent genomes and, if transcribed, form a long RNA stem-loop, they might, thereby, lead to new localizations for targeted gene products. To test their targeting ability in vivo we created transgenic mice expressing various ID elements fused to the 3′ UTR of reporter mRNA for Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein. In vivo, neither ID elements nor the BC1 RNA coding region were capable of transporting EGFP RNA to dendrites, although the 3′ UTR of α-CaMKII mRNA, an established cis-acting element did produce positive results. Other mRNAs containing naturally inserted ID elements are also not found in neuronal dendrites. We conclude that the 5′ ID domain from BC1 RNA is not a sufficient dendritic targeting element for mRNAs in vivo."

INT6 expression is altered in human cancers, but the precise role of disrupted INT6 in tumorigenesis remains unclear, and an animal model to study Int-6 physiological function has been lacking.Here, we create an in vivo model of Int6 function in zebrafish, and through genetic and chemical-genetic approaches implicate Int6 as a tissue-specific modulator of MEK-ERK signaling. We find that Int6 is required for normal expression of MEK1 protein in human cells, and for Erk signaling in zebrafish embryos. Loss of either Int6 or Mek signaling causes defects in craniofacial development, and Int6 and Erk-signaling have overlapping domains of tissue expression.Our results provide new insight into the physiological role of vertebrate Int6, and have implications for the treatment of human tumors displaying altered INT6 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2064714436,"Mitochondrial encephalomyopathies are a heterogeneous group of clinical disorders generally caused due to mutations in either mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or nuclear genes encoding oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). We analyzed the mtDNA sequences from a group of 23 pediatric patients with clinical and morphological features of mitochondrial encephalopathies and tried to establish a relationship of identified variants with the disease.Complete mitochondrial genomes were amplified by PCR and sequenced by automated DNA sequencing. Sequencing data was analyzed by SeqScape software and also confirmed by BLASTn program. Nucleotide sequences were compared with the revised Cambridge reference sequence (CRS) and sequences present in mitochondrial databases. The data obtained shows that a number of known and novel mtDNA variants were associated with the disease. Most of the non-synonymous variants were heteroplasmic (A4136G, A9194G and T11916A) suggesting their possibility of being pathogenic in nature. Some of the missense variants although homoplasmic were showing changes in highly conserved amino acids (T3394C, T3866C, and G9804A) and were previously identified with diseased conditions. Similarly, two other variants found in tRNA genes (G5783A and C8309T) could alter the secondary structure of Cys-tRNA and Lys-tRNA. Most of the variants occurred in single cases; however, a few occurred in more than one case (e.g. G5783A and A10149T).The mtDNA variants identified in this study could be the possible cause of mitochondrial encephalomyopathies with childhood onset in the patient group. Our study further strengthens the pathogenic score of known variants previously reported as provisionally pathogenic in mitochondrial diseases. The novel variants found in the present study can be potential candidates for further investigations to establish the relationship between their incidence and role in expressing the disease phenotype. This study will be useful in genetic diagnosis and counseling of mitochondrial diseases in India as well as worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W2146944927,"Frizzled receptors have seven membrane-spanning helices and are considered as atypical G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The mating response of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is mediated by a GPCR signaling system and this model organism has been used extensively in the past to study mammalian GPCR function. We show here that human Frizzled receptors (Fz1 and Fz2) can be properly targeted to the yeast plasma membrane, and that they stimulate the yeast mating pathway in the absence of added Wnt ligands, as evidenced by cell cycle arrest in G1 and reporter gene expression dependent on the mating pathway-activated FUS1 gene. Introducing intracellular portions of Frizzled receptors into the Ste2p backbone resulted in the generation of constitutively active receptor chimeras that retained mating factor responsiveness. Introducing intracellular portions of Ste2p into the Frizzled receptor backbone was found to strongly enhance mating pathway activation as compared to the native Frizzleds, likely by facilitating interaction with the yeast Galpha protein Gpa1p. Furthermore, we show reversibility of the highly penetrant G1-phase arrests exerted by the receptor chimeras by deletion of the mating pathway effector FAR1. Our data demonstrate that Frizzled receptors can functionally replace mating factor receptors in yeast and offer an experimental system to study modulators of Frizzled receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2136869804,"Background The development of new high-throughput genotyping technologies has allowed fast evaluation of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on a genome-wide scale. Several recent genome-wide association studies employing these technologies suggest that panels of SNPs can be a useful tool for predicting cancer susceptibility and discovery of potentially important new disease loci. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present paper we undertake a careful examination of the relative significance of genetics, environmental factors, and biases of the data analysis protocol that was used in a previously published genome-wide association study. That prior study reported a nearly perfect discrimination of esophageal cancer patients and healthy controls on the basis of only genetic information. On the other hand, our results strongly suggest that SNPs in this dataset are not statistically linked to the phenotype, while several environmental factors and especially family history of esophageal cancer (a proxy to both environmental and genetic factors) have only a modest association with the disease. Conclusions/Significance The main component of the previously claimed strong discriminatory signal is due to several data analysis pitfalls that in combination led to the strongly optimistic results. Such pitfalls are preventable and should be avoided in future studies since they create misleading conclusions and generate many false leads for subsequent research."
