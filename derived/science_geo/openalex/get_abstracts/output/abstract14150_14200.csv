https://openalex.org/W2045281368,"Messenger RNAs from mouse myeloma cells contain N-6-methyl adenosine and novel 5' termini having 7-methy-guanosine in a 5', 5' triphosphate linkage with ribose-methylated nucleosides. Ten common 5'-terminal sequences of the forms m-7-G-5'-PPP-5'-NmpNp and m-7-G-5'-ppp-5'-NmpNmpNp are reported. Structures like this may be a general feature of mRNA in eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W1496974366,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) was labeled with 125-I by a lactoperoxidase technique. The unlabeled, monoiodinated and diiodinated species were separated by DEAE-cellulose chromatography and found to possess equivalent biological activities. The binding of monoiodinated epidermal growth factor to human fibroblasts was specific in that unrelated polypeptides did not affect the binding reaction. The binding reaction was a saturable process and was time- and temperature-dependent. A Scatchard analysis of the binding data indicated that each cell was capable of binding approximately 100, 000 molecules of 125-I-EGF. The apparent dissociation constant for the binding reaction was calculated to be 2.7 to 4.3 times 10-minus 10 M. Subsequent to the binding of 125-I-EGF to the fibroblasts, the growth factor was degraded by a cell-mediated proteolysis and [125-I]monoiodotyrosine appeared in the medium. The extent of degradation was reduced by the protease inhibitors, tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone and the benzyl ester of guanidobenzoic acid. Active binding sites of 125-I-egf appeared to be present in some but not all cell types. These results demonstrated that cells derived from a number of species (human, mouse, rat, and chick) possessed receptors that interacted with this mouse-derived growth factor."

https://openalex.org/W1490501514,"Previous studies have shown that guanine nucleotides, acting at a site termed nucleotide regulatory site, are required for activation of hepatic adenylate cyclase and that glucagon facilitates this process. This study shows that only guanine nucleotides containing triphosphate groups at the 5' position of ribose (or 3'-deoxyribose) are capable of activating the enzyme. The terminal phosphate is not utilized in the activation process since 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p and 5'-guanylyl methylenediphosphonate, analogues of GTP that are not utilized in transferase or hydrolase reactions, stimulate enzyme activity. The nucleotides bind in their free form at the regulatory site; chelation by magnesium ion shifts the apparent concentration dependence for activation by Gpp(nh)p. GDP inhibits competitively Gpp(NH)p-stimulated activity and inhibits basal activity and activities stimulated by glucagon. Activation of the enzyme by Gpp(NH)p is a slow process; the length of the lag time increases as an inverse function of nucleotide concentration and is as long as 4 min before onset of increased enzyme activity. Following pretreatment with Gpp(NH)p and extensive washing of hepatic membranes, the enzyme displays immediate increases in activity with rates that are a function of the nucleotide concentration during pretreatment; the rates remain constant for at least 6 min despite the absence of Gpp(NH)p in the medium. Studies with labeled Gpp(NH)p show that the intact nucleotide remains firmly bound to the membranes after extensive washing, suggesting that the persistence of adenylate cyclase activity may be related to slow dissociation of the nucleotide from the regulatory site. Addition of 1 nM glucagon, a submaximal concentration, does not abolish the lag phase of Gpp(NH)p activation even at saturating concentration of the nucleotide (1 muM or higher). The maximal steady state rate is achieved under these conditions. Addition of 2 muM glucagon, a saturating hormone concentration, does not alter the steady state rate but abolishes the lag phase of Gpp(NH)p activation. The transient kinetics of Gpp(NH)p activation and the effects of glucagon thereon are discussed in terms of a three state model in which the guanine nucleotide induces the formation of an intermediate transition state that displays no increase in enzyme activity over the basal state and which slowly isomerizes to a high activity state of the adenylate cyclase system; glucagon acts by accelerating the rate of isomerization."

https://openalex.org/W1672787784,"This paper presents a steady state kinetic model for hepatic adenylate cyclase. The activity of the enzyme has been assayed in the presence of a range of concentrations of magnesium, adenylylimidodiphosphate (App(NH)p), 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p), and in the presence and absence of saturating concentrations of glucagon. The data were tested against proposed models using an iterative least squares curve fitting program (SAAM25) and confidence estimates for the model parameters were obtained. Hepatic adenylate cyclase is viewed as an enzyme having three characteristic states of catalytic function (E, E', E''). Each state has its own intrinsic activity in carrying out the catalysis of MgApp(NH)p-3 minus to form cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate. It is shown, in agreement with a proposal by de Haen, that unchelated substrate can inhibit adenylate cyclase activity. It is further concluded that this inhibition is principally due to App(NH)pH-3 minus. The three catalytic states differ markedly in their susceptibility to inhibition as well as in their Vmax, but the Km for MgApp(NH)p-2 minus is essentially the same for all states. The state transitions induced by Gpp(NH)p and by hormone are considered. Gpp(NH)p binding to state E causes transformation to state E'. State E' undergoes spontaneous transformation to state E''. Glucagon augments the transition from E' to E''. We conclude that the activating species of Gpp(NH)p is an unchelated form, most probably Gpp(NH)p-4 minus. Our results indicate that state E' is significantly more susceptible to inhibition by App(NH)pH-3 minus than the other two states. Certain phenomena occurring in fat cell adenylate cyclase are discussed in light of our findings in hepatic adenylate cyclase."

https://openalex.org/W1490742333,"The amino acid sequences of garden bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) trypsin inhibitor II and a related molecular species II' have been examined. The entire sequence of II' has been determined with the exception of five internal residues. The garden bean inhibitors are highly homologous to the Bowman-Birk soybean inhibitor and lima bean trypsin inhibitor IV. The trypsin-reactive site has been located in the second half of the molecule, while the first reactive site has been found to be directed against elastase. Garden bean inhibitor II (and II') is thus a double-headed inhibitor, simultaneously inhibiting 1 molecule of trypsin and 1 of elastase."

Additionally, two HL-A antigens show profoundly altered reactivities with specific antisera2, which in total demonstrates that three diverse gene products are markedly abnormal in Werner's fibroblasts. The purpose of our study was to document further this phenomenon in Werner's cells. We now report a high heat-labile fraction of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6-PGD), an enzyme involved in the hexose monophosphate shunt, and hypoxanthineâ€“guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT), an enzyme concerned with purine metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W1591082574,"The major coat protein of bacteriophage f1 radioactively labeled with specific amino acids was solubilized with deoxycholate and digested with trypsin or alpha-chymotrypsin. The degree of proteolysis of the coat protein was assayed by gel filtration chromatography of the digest in the presence of deoxycholate. Hydrolysis occurred at residues in the hydrophilic termini of the coat, releasing peptides containing proline, lysine, and phenylalanine. No cleavage occurred at the tyrosine or methionine residues in the hydrophobic core. However, chymotrypsin could cleave somewhat at these residues in the absence of deoxycholate. A model for the topography of the micellar complex of coat protein and deoxycholate is presented in which the hydrophobic sequence of the coat is bound to deoxycholate within a micelle, while the hydrophilic termini of the coat project from the micelle."
https://openalex.org/W1981825923,"THE plutonium isotope 239Pu is a known carcinogen but its ability to produce genetic damage has not been so well investigated. The radionuclide is found in gonads after intravenous injection into humans1 and after administration to animals by various routes2. Retention of 239Pu in the gonads is prolonged and the genetic effects there have been estimated on the basis of average dose in the gonads3. Inhomogeneity of distribution of plutonium within gonads has, however, been noted4 giving rise to the possibility that some cells may receive a greater radiation dose than others. No investigations of the effects of this inhomogeneity upon dose-rate to the cells involved in gametogenesis have been reported. Here we report briefly that a non-uniform distribution of 239Pu in the testis results in increased radiation of the spermatogonial stem-cells."
https://openalex.org/W1517674875,"alpha-Isopropylmalate isomerase, the second enzyme specific for leucine biosynthesis, can be purified from extracts of yeast utilizing a chromatographic procedure that allows separation of proteins in the presence of high concentrations of (NH4)2SO4. The purification procedure utilizes the stabilizing effect of glycerol and (NH4)2SO4 on the isomerase and their opposing effects on protein retention on valine-Sepharose and leucine-Sepharose. The method effectively separates the isomerase from fumarase, a stable internal marker protein that was co-purified in early steps. High ionic strength hydrophobic chromatography, based on differential retention as a function of the length of the hydrophobic sidearm and ionic strength, yields approximately 200-fold purified alpha-isopropylmalate isomerase and may be of general utility in purifying unstable enzymes requiring high ionic strength."
https://openalex.org/W1607590325,"UDPglucose 4-epimerase from Saccharomyces fragilis catalyzes a freely reversible reaction between UDP-galactose and UDP-glucose. With UDP-galactose as the substrate the enzyme shows a classical hyperbolic kinetics but when UDP-glucose is used as the substrate a distinct allostericity is observed. As a consequence, at low concentrations of UDP-glucose, the enzyme fails to establish the equilibrium at a significant rate. Glucose 6-phosphate acts as a strong activator for the enzyme with low concentrations of UDP-glucose as the substrate. In view of these rather unusual kinetic data for an enzyme catalyzing a freely reversible reaction, UDPglucose 4-epimerase may play a regulatory role in controlling the flux of galactose metabolism."
