https://openalex.org/W2020006133,"Optical near-field microscopes can beat the optical diffraction limit when probing electromagnetic fields in the vicinity of microscopic objects, but cannot match the atomic-scale resolution of an electron microscope. Barwick et al. have now developed an ingenious blend of these two imaging modalities — they show how the enhanced electron–photon interactions mediated by these evanescent electromagnetic fields can be detected using an ultrafast electron microscope, generating images of these fields that are well resolved in space and time. This work demonstrates the potential of photon-induced imaging in general and for nanoscale studies of fields at interfaces in particular. Optical near-field microscopies can achieve spatial resolutions beyond the diffraction limit, but they cannot match the atomic-scale resolution of electron microscopy. Here, the development of photon-induced near-field electron microscopy — an ingenious blend of these two imaging modalities — opens the way for direct space-time imaging of localized fields at interfaces and visualization of phenomena related to photonics, plasmonics and nanostructures. In materials science and biology, optical near-field microscopies enable spatial resolutions beyond the diffraction limit1,2, but they cannot provide the atomic-scale imaging capabilities of electron microscopy3. Given the nature of interactions4,5,6,7,8 between electrons and photons, and considering their connections9,10 through nanostructures, it should be possible to achieve imaging of evanescent electromagnetic fields with electron pulses when such fields are resolved in both space (nanometre and below) and time (femtosecond)11,12,13. Here we report the development of photon-induced near-field electron microscopy (PINEM), and the associated phenomena. We show that the precise spatiotemporal overlap of femtosecond single-electron packets with intense optical pulses at a nanostructure (individual carbon nanotube or silver nanowire in this instance) results in the direct absorption of integer multiples of photon quanta (nℏω) by the relativistic electrons accelerated to 200 keV. By energy-filtering only those electrons resulting from this absorption, it is possible to image directly in space the near-field electric field distribution, obtain the temporal behaviour of the field on the femtosecond timescale, and map its spatial polarization dependence. We believe that the observation of the photon-induced near-field effect in ultrafast electron microscopy demonstrates the potential for many applications, including those of direct space-time imaging of localized fields at interfaces and visualization of phenomena related to photonics, plasmonics and nanostructures."
https://openalex.org/W2054782539,"DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are highly cytotoxic lesions that are generated by ionizing radiation and various DNA-damaging chemicals. Following DSB formation, cells activate the DNA-damage response (DDR) protein kinases ATM, ATR and DNA-PK (also known as PRKDC). These then trigger histone H2AX (also known as H2AFX) phosphorylation and the accumulation of proteins such as MDC1, 53BP1 (also known as TP53BP1), BRCA1, CtIP (also known as RBBP8), RNF8 and RNF168/RIDDLIN into ionizing radiation-induced foci (IRIF) that amplify DSB signalling and promote DSB repair. Attachment of small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) to target proteins controls diverse cellular functions. Here, we show that SUMO1, SUMO2 and SUMO3 accumulate at DSB sites in mammalian cells, with SUMO1 and SUMO2/3 accrual requiring the E3 ligase enzymes PIAS4 and PIAS1. We also establish that PIAS1 and PIAS4 are recruited to damage sites via mechanisms requiring their SAP domains, and are needed for the productive association of 53BP1, BRCA1 and RNF168 with such regions. Furthermore, we show that PIAS1 and PIAS4 promote DSB repair and confer ionizing radiation resistance. Finally, we establish that PIAS1 and PIAS4 are required for effective ubiquitin-adduct formation mediated by RNF8, RNF168 and BRCA1 at sites of DNA damage. These findings thus identify PIAS1 and PIAS4 as components of the DDR and reveal how protein recruitment to DSB sites is controlled by coordinated SUMOylation and ubiquitylation."

https://openalex.org/W2044588337,"The in vivo function of E2f transcription factors has been a matter of debate. Here it is shown that E2f1–3 contribute to the activation of cell cycle genes in dividing progenitor cells during mouse development but are dispensable for cell division. However, in differentiating cells, E2f1–3 act as repressors to facilitate cell cycle exit. The in vivo function of E2f transcription factors has been a matter of debate. The effects of E2f1, E2f2 and E2f3 triple deficiency are now examined in murine embryonic stem cells, embryos and small intestines. E2f1–3 are shown to function as transcriptional activators in normal dividing progenitor cells; however, contrary to the current view, they are dispensable for cell division but are necessary for cell survival. In the established model of mammalian cell cycle control, the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) functions to restrict cells from entering S phase by binding and sequestering E2f activators (E2f1, E2f2 and E2f3), which are invariably portrayed as the ultimate effectors of a transcriptional program that commit cells to enter and progress through S phase1,2. Using a panel of tissue-specific cre-transgenic mice and conditional E2f alleles we examined the effects of E2f1, E2f2 and E2f3 triple deficiency in murine embryonic stem cells, embryos and small intestines. We show that in normal dividing progenitor cells E2f1–3 function as transcriptional activators, but contrary to the current view, are dispensable for cell division and instead are necessary for cell survival. In differentiating cells E2f1–3 function in a complex with Rb as repressors to silence E2f targets and facilitate exit from the cell cycle. The inactivation of Rb in differentiating cells resulted in a switch of E2f1–3 from repressors to activators, leading to the superactivation of E2f responsive targets and ectopic cell divisions. Loss of E2f1–3 completely suppressed these phenotypes caused by Rb deficiency. This work contextualizes the activator versus repressor functions of E2f1–3 in vivo, revealing distinct roles in dividing versus differentiating cells and in normal versus cancer-like cell cycles."

https://openalex.org/W1969954832,"How do human beings decide when to be selfish or selfless? In this study, we gave testosterone to 25 men to establish its impact on prosocial behaviors in a double-blind within-subjects design. We also confirmed participants' testosterone levels before and after treatment through blood draws. Using the Ultimatum Game from behavioral economics, we find that men with artificially raised T, compared to themselves on placebo, were 27% less generous towards strangers with money they controlled (95% CI placebo: (1.70, 2.72); 95% CI T: (.98, 2.30)). This effect scales with a man's level of total-, free-, and dihydro-testosterone (DHT). Men in the lowest decile of DHT were 560% more generous than men in the highest decile of DHT. We also found that men with elevated testosterone were more likely to use their own money punish those who were ungenerous toward them. Our results continue to hold after controlling for altruism. We conclude that elevated testosterone causes men to behave antisocially."
https://openalex.org/W2070330056,"Background Whereas cilia damage and reduced cilia beat frequency have been implicated as causative of reduced mucociliary clearance in smokers, theoretically mucociliary clearance could also be affected by cilia length. Based on models of mucociliary clearance predicting that cilia length must exceed the 6–7 µm airway surface fluid depth to generate force in the mucus layer, we hypothesized that cilia height may be decreased in airway epithelium of normal smokers compared to nonsmokers. Methodology/Principal Findings Cilia length in normal nonsmokers and smokers was evaluated in aldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded endobronchial biopsies, and air-dried and hydrated samples were brushed from human airway epithelium via fiberoptic bronchoscopy. In 28 endobronchial biopsies, healthy smoker cilia length was reduced by 15% compared to nonsmokers (p<0.05). In 39 air-dried samples of airway epithelial cells, smoker cilia length was reduced by 13% compared to nonsmokers (p<0.0001). Analysis of the length of individual, detached cilia in 27 samples showed that smoker cilia length was reduced by 9% compared to nonsmokers (p<0.05). Finally, in 16 fully hydrated, unfixed samples, smoker cilia length was reduced 7% compared to nonsmokers (p<0.05). Using genome-wide analysis of airway epithelial gene expression we identified 6 cilia-related genes whose expression levels were significantly reduced in healthy smokers compared to healthy nonsmokers. Conclusions/Significance Models predict that a reduction in cilia length would reduce mucociliary clearance, suggesting that smoking-associated shorter airway epithelial cilia play a significant role in the pathogenesis of smoking-induced lung disease."
https://openalex.org/W2012579732,"Kisspeptin and its G protein-coupled receptor (GPR) 54 are essential for activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis. In the rat, the kisspeptin neurons critical for gonadotropin secretion are located in the hypothalamic arcuate (ARC) and anteroventral periventricular (AVPV) nuclei. As the ARC is known to be the site of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pulse generator we explored whether kisspeptin-GPR54 signalling in the ARC regulates GnRH pulses.We examined the effects of kisspeptin-10 or a selective kisspeptin antagonist administration intra-ARC or intra-medial preoptic area (mPOA), (which includes the AVPV), on pulsatile luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion in the rat. Ovariectomized rats with subcutaneous 17beta-estradiol capsules were chronically implanted with bilateral intra-ARC or intra-mPOA cannulae, or intra-cerebroventricular (icv) cannulae and intravenous catheters. Blood samples were collected every 5 min for 5-8 h for LH measurement. After 2 h of control blood sampling, kisspeptin-10 or kisspeptin antagonist was administered via pre-implanted cannulae. Intranuclear administration of kisspeptin-10 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in circulating levels of LH lasting approximately 1 h, before recovering to a normal pulsatile pattern of circulating LH. Both icv and intra-ARC administration of kisspeptin antagonist suppressed LH pulse frequency profoundly. However, intra-mPOA administration of kisspeptin antagonist did not affect pulsatile LH secretion.These data are the first to identify the arcuate nucleus as a key site for kisspeptin modulation of LH pulse frequency, supporting the notion that kisspeptin-GPR54 signalling in this region of the mediobasal hypothalamus is a critical neural component of the hypothalamic GnRH pulse generator."
https://openalex.org/W2086010114,"Although the message of ""global climate change"" is catalyzing international action, it is local and regional changes that directly affect people and ecosystems and are of immediate concern to scientists, managers, and policy makers. A major barrier preventing informed climate-change adaptation planning is the difficulty accessing, analyzing, and interpreting climate-change information. To address this problem, we developed a powerful, yet easy to use, web-based tool called Climate Wizard (http://ClimateWizard.org) that provides non-climate specialists with simple analyses and innovative graphical depictions for conveying how climate has and is projected to change within specific geographic areas throughout the world.To demonstrate the Climate Wizard, we explored historic trends and future departures (anomalies) in temperature and precipitation globally, and within specific latitudinal zones and countries. We found the greatest temperature increases during 1951-2002 occurred in northern hemisphere countries (especially during January-April), but the latitude of greatest temperature change varied throughout the year, sinusoidally ranging from approximately 50 degrees N during February-March to 10 degrees N during August-September. Precipitation decreases occurred most commonly in countries between 0-20 degrees N, and increases mostly occurred outside of this latitudinal region. Similarly, a quantile ensemble analysis based on projections from 16 General Circulation Models (GCMs) for 2070-2099 identified the median projected change within countries, which showed both latitudinal and regional patterns in projected temperature and precipitation change.The results of these analyses are consistent with those reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, but at the same time, they provide examples of how Climate Wizard can be used to explore regionally- and temporally-specific analyses of climate change. Moreover, Climate Wizard is not a static product, but rather a data analysis framework designed to be used for climate change impact and adaption planning, which can be expanded to include other information, such as downscaled future projections of hydrology, soil moisture, wildfire, vegetation, marine conditions, disease, and agricultural productivity."
https://openalex.org/W2062155001,"The activating E2f transcription factors (E2f1, E2f2 and E2f3) induce transcription and are widely viewed as essential positive cell cycle regulators. Indeed, they drive cells out of quiescence, and the 'cancer cell cycle' in Rb1 null cells is E2f-dependent. Absence of activating E2fs in flies or mammalian fibroblasts causes cell cycle arrest, but this block is alleviated by removing repressive E2f or the tumour suppressor p53, respectively. Thus, whether activating E2fs are indispensable for normal division is an area of debate. Activating E2fs are also well known pro-apoptotic factors, providing a defence against oncogenesis, yet E2f1 can limit irradiation-induced apoptosis. In flies this occurs through repression of hid (also called Wrinkled; Smac/Diablo in mammals). However, in mammals the mechanism is unclear because Smac/Diablo is induced, not repressed, by E2f1, and in keratinocytes survival is promoted indirectly through induction of DNA repair targets. Thus, a direct pro-survival function for E2f1-3 and/or its relevance beyond irradiation has not been established. To address E2f1-3 function in normal cells in vivo we focused on the mouse retina, which is a relatively simple central nervous system component that can be manipulated genetically without compromising viability and has provided considerable insight into development and cancer. Here we show that unlike fibroblasts, E2f1-3 null retinal progenitor cells or activated Müller glia can divide. We attribute this effect to functional interchangeability with Mycn. However, loss of activating E2fs caused downregulation of the p53 deacetylase Sirt1, p53 hyperacetylation and elevated apoptosis, establishing a novel E2f-Sirt1-p53 survival axis in vivo. Thus, activating E2fs are not universally required for normal mammalian cell division, but have an unexpected pro-survival role in development."
https://openalex.org/W2138438738,"The amyloid-β 42 (Aβ42) is thought to play a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the molecular mechanisms by which Aβ42 induces neuronal dysfunction and degeneration remain elusive. Mitochondrial dysfunctions are implicated in AD brains. Whether mitochondrial dysfunctions are merely a consequence of AD pathology, or are early seminal events in AD pathogenesis remains to be determined. Here, we show that Aβ42 induces mitochondrial mislocalization, which contributes to Aβ42-induced neuronal dysfunction in a transgenic Drosophila model. In the Aβ42 fly brain, mitochondria were reduced in axons and dendrites, and accumulated in the somata without severe mitochondrial damage or neurodegeneration. In contrast, organization of microtubule or global axonal transport was not significantly altered at this stage. Aβ42-induced behavioral defects were exacerbated by genetic reductions in mitochondrial transport, and were modulated by cAMP levels and PKA activity. Levels of putative PKA substrate phosphoproteins were reduced in the Aβ42 fly brains. Importantly, perturbations in mitochondrial transport in neurons were sufficient to disrupt PKA signaling and induce late-onset behavioral deficits, suggesting a mechanism whereby mitochondrial mislocalization contributes to Aβ42-induced neuronal dysfunction. These results demonstrate that mislocalization of mitochondria underlies the pathogenic effects of Aβ42 in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2073278072,"Kuiper belt objects occupy a region of the Solar System beyond the orbit of Neptune. Many — including the dwarf planets Pluto, Haumea and Makemake — are more than 100 km in diameter. At the opposite end of the scale, sub-kilometre-sized objects cannot be observed directly. But they should be detectable as occultations of background stars and one such detection is now reported. A survey of archival data reveals an occultation by a body with a radius of about 500 metres at a distance of 45 astronomical units (Neptune orbits at about 30 AU) from the Sun. The fact that just one event was found in the survey suggests a deficit of sub-kilometre bodies, compared to that expected from extrapolation of the population of '50-km' bodies: this may mean that the smaller Kuiper belt objects are gradually disappearing as they collide with one another. The Kuiper belt is a remnant of the primordial Solar System. Small, sub-kilometre-sized, Kuiper belt objects elude direct detection, but the signature of their occultations of background stars should be detectable. Analysis of archival data now reveals an occultation by a body with an approximately 500-metre radius at a distance of 45 astronomical units. The detection of only one event reveals a deficit of sub-kilometre-sized Kuiper belt objects and implies that these small bodies are undergoing collisional erosion. The Kuiper belt is a remnant of the primordial Solar System. Measurements of its size distribution constrain its accretion and collisional history, and the importance of material strength of Kuiper belt objects1,2,3,4. Small, sub-kilometre-sized, Kuiper belt objects elude direct detection, but the signature of their occultations of background stars should be detectable5,6,7,8,9. Observations at both optical10 and X-ray11 wavelengths claim to have detected such occultations, but their implied abundances are inconsistent with each other and far exceed theoretical expectations. Here we report an analysis of archival data that reveals an occultation by a body with an approximately 500-metre radius at a distance of 45 astronomical units. The probability of this event arising from random statistical fluctuations within our data set is about two per cent. Our survey yields a surface density of Kuiper belt objects with radii exceeding 250 metres of , ruling out inferred surface densities from previous claimed detections by more than 5σ. The detection of only one event reveals a deficit of sub-kilometre-sized Kuiper belt objects compared to a population extrapolated from objects with radii exceeding 50 kilometres. This implies that sub-kilometre-sized objects are undergoing collisional erosion, just like debris disks observed around other stars."
https://openalex.org/W2083797848,"Background Currently, only few techniques are available for quantifying systemic metastases in preclinical model. Thus techniques that can sensitively detect metastatic colonization and assess treatment response in real-time are urgently needed. To this end, we engineered tumor cells to express a naturally secreted Gaussia luciferase (Gluc), and investigated its use as a circulating biomarker for monitoring viable metastatic or primary tumor growth and their treatment responses. Methodology/Principal Findings We first developed orthotopic primary and metastatic breast tumors with derivative of MDA-MB-231 cells expressing Gluc. We then correlated tumor burden with Gluc activity in the blood and urine along with bioluminescent imaging (BLI). Second, we utilized blood Gluc assay to monitor treatment response to lapatinib in an experimental model of systemic metastasis. We observed good correlation between the primary tumor volume and Gluc concentration in blood (R2 = 0.84) and urine (R2 = 0.55) in the breast tumor model. The correlation deviated as a primary tumor grew due to a reduction in viable tumor fraction. This was also supported by our mathematical models for tumor growth to compare the total and viable tumor burden in our model. In the experimental metastasis model, we found numerous brain metastases as well as systemic metastases including bone and lungs. Importantly, blood Gluc assay revealed early growth of metastatic tumors before BLI could visualize their presence. Using secreted Gluc, we localized systemic metastases by BLI and quantitatively monitored the total viable metastatic tumor burden by blood Gluc assay during the course of treatment with lapatinib, a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor of EGFR and HER2. Conclusion/Significance We demonstrated secreted Gluc assay accurately reflects the amount of viable cancer cells in primary and metastatic tumors. Blood Gluc activity not only tracks metastatic tumor progression but also serves as a longitudinal biomarker for tumor response to treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2091051137,"The early evolution of living marsupials is poorly understood in part because the early offshoots of this group are known almost exclusively from jaws and teeth. Filling this gap is essential for a better understanding of the phylogenetic relationships among living marsupials, the biogeographic pathways that led to their current distribution as well as the successive evolutionary steps that led to their current diversity, habits and various specializations that distinguish them from placental mammals.Here we report the first skull of a 55 million year old peradectid marsupial from the early Eocene of North America and exceptionally preserved skeletons of an Oligocene herpetotheriid, both representing critical groups to understand early marsupial evolution. A comprehensive phylogenetic cladistic analysis of Marsupialia including the new findings and close relatives of marsupials show that peradectids are the sister group of living opossums and herpetotheriids are the sister group of all living marsupials.The results imply that North America played an important role in early Cenozoic marsupial evolutionary history and may have even been the center of origin of living marsupials and opossums. New data from the herpetotheriid postcranium support the view that the ancestral morphotype of Marsupialia was more terrestrial than opossums are. The resolution of the phylogenetic position of peradectids reveals an older calibration point for molecular estimates of divergence times among living marsupials than those currently used."
https://openalex.org/W2028753219,"The YidC/Oxa1/Alb3 family of membrane proteins controls the insertion and assembly of membrane proteins in bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts. Here we describe the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction of Alb3 with the chloroplast signal recognition particle (cpSRP). The Alb3 C-terminal domain (A3CT) is intrinsically disordered and recruits cpSRP to the thylakoid membrane by a coupled binding and folding mechanism. Two conserved, positively charged motifs reminiscent of chromodomain interaction motifs in histone tails are identified in A3CT that are essential for the Alb3-cpSRP43 interaction. They are absent in the C-terminal domain of Alb4, which therefore does not interact with cpSRP43. Chromodomain 2 in cpSRP43 appears as a central binding platform that can interact simultaneously with A3CT and cpSRP54. The observed negative cooperativity of the two binding events provides the first insights into cargo release at the thylakoid membrane. Taken together, our data show how Alb3 participates in cpSRP-dependent membrane targeting, and our data provide a molecular explanation why Alb4 cannot compensate for the loss of Alb3. Oxa1 and YidC utilize their positively charged, C-terminal domains for ribosome interaction in co-translational targeting. Alb3 is adapted for the chloroplast-specific Alb3-cpSRP43 interaction in post-translational targeting by extending the spectrum of chromodomain interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1996935657,"The ecological factors contributing to the evolution of tropical vertebrate communities are still poorly understood. Primate communities of the tropical Americas have fewer folivorous but more frugivorous genera than tropical regions of the Old World and especially many more frugivorous genera than Madagascar. Reasons for this phenomenon are largely unexplored. We developed the hypothesis that Neotropical fruits have higher protein concentrations than fruits from Madagascar and that the higher representation of frugivorous genera in the Neotropics is linked to high protein concentrations in fruits. Low fruit protein concentrations in Madagascar would restrict the evolution of frugivores in Malagasy communities.We reviewed the literature for nitrogen concentrations in fruits from the Neotropics and from Madagascar, and analyzed fruits from an additional six sites in the Neotropics and six sites in Madagascar. Fruits from the Neotropical sites contain significantly more nitrogen than fruits from the Madagascar sites. Nitrogen concentrations in New World fruits are above the concentrations to satisfy nitrogen requirements of primates, while they are at the lower end or below the concentrations to cover primate protein needs in Madagascar.Fruits at most sites in the Neotropics contain enough protein to satisfy the protein needs of primates. Thus, selection pressure to develop new adaptations for foods that are difficult to digest (such as leaves) may have been lower in the Neotropics than in Madagascar. The low nitrogen concentrations in fruits from Madagascar may contribute to the almost complete absence of frugivorous primate species on this island."
https://openalex.org/W2126429400,"This study aimed at developing an alternative host for the production of penicillin (PEN). As yet, the industrial production of this beta-lactam antibiotic is confined to the filamentous fungus Penicillium chrysogenum. As such, the yeast Hansenula polymorpha, a recognized producer of pharmaceuticals, represents an attractive alternative. Introduction of the P. chrysogenum gene encoding the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) delta-(L-alpha-aminoadipyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine synthetase (ACVS) in H. polymorpha, resulted in the production of active ACVS enzyme, when co-expressed with the Bacillus subtilis sfp gene encoding a phosphopantetheinyl transferase that activated ACVS. This represents the first example of the functional expression of a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase in yeast. Co-expression with the P. chrysogenum genes encoding the cytosolic enzyme isopenicillin N synthase as well as the two peroxisomal enzymes isopenicillin N acyl transferase (IAT) and phenylacetyl CoA ligase (PCL) resulted in production of biologically active PEN, which was efficiently secreted. The amount of secreted PEN was similar to that produced by the original P. chrysogenum NRRL1951 strain (approx. 1 mg/L). PEN production was decreased over two-fold in a yeast strain lacking peroxisomes, indicating that the peroxisomal localization of IAT and PCL is important for efficient PEN production. The breakthroughs of this work enable exploration of new yeast-based cell factories for the production of (novel) beta-lactam antibiotics as well as other natural and semi-synthetic peptides (e.g. immunosuppressive and cytostatic agents), whose production involves NRPS's."
https://openalex.org/W2055898731,"Background Although several studies suggest that genetic factors are associated with human UTI susceptibility, the role of DNA variation in regulating early in vivo urine inflammatory responses has not been fully examined. We examined whether candidate gene polymorphisms were associated with altered urine inflammatory profiles in asymptomatic women with or without bacteriuria. Methodology We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in 1,261 asymptomatic women ages 18-49 years originally enrolled as participants in a population-based case-control study of recurrent UTI and pyelonephritis. We genotyped polymorphisms in CXCR1, CXCR2, TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, and TIRAP in women with and without ASB. We collected urine samples and measured levels of uropathogenic bacteria, neutrophils, and chemokines. Principal Findings Polymorphism TLR2_G2258A, a variant associated with decreased lipopeptide-induced signaling, was associated with increased ASB risk (odds ratio 3.44, 95%CI; 1.65–7.17). Three CXCR1 polymorphisms were associated with ASB caused by gram-positive organisms. ASB was associated with urinary CXCL-8 levels, but not CXCL-5, CXCL-6, or sICAM-1 (P≤0.0001). Urinary levels of CXCL-8 and CXCL-6, but not ICAM-1, were associated with higher neutrophil levels (P≤0.0001). In addition, polymorphism CXCR1_G827C was associated with increased CXCL-8 levels in women with ASB (P = 0.004). Conclusions TLR2 and CXCR1 polymorphisms were associated with ASB and a CXCR1 variant was associated with urine CXCL-8 levels. These results suggest that genetic factors are associated with early in vivo human bladder immune responses prior to the development of symptomatic UTIs."

https://openalex.org/W2006665219,"Background Cardiac glycosides are Na+/K+-pump inhibitors widely used to treat heart failure. They are also highly cytotoxic, and studies have suggested specific anti-tumor activity leading to current clinical trials in cancer patients. However, a definitive demonstration of this putative anti-cancer activity and the underlying molecular mechanism has remained elusive. Methodology/Principal Findings Using an unbiased transcriptomics approach, we found that cardiac glycosides inhibit general protein synthesis. Protein synthesis inhibition and cytotoxicity were not specific for cancer cells as they were observed in both primary and cancer cell lines. These effects were dependent on the Na+/K+-pump as they were rescued by expression of a cardiac glycoside-resistant Na+/K+-pump. Unlike human cells, rodent cells are largely resistant to cardiac glycosides in vitro and mice were found to tolerate extremely high levels. Conclusions/Significance The physiological difference between human and mouse explains the previously observed sensitivity of human cancer cells in mouse xenograft experiments. Thus, published mouse xenograft models used to support anti-tumor activity for these drugs require reevaluation. Our finding that cardiac glycosides inhibit protein synthesis provides a mechanism for the cytotoxicity of CGs and raises concerns about ongoing clinical trials to test CGs as anti-cancer agents in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2116049164,"Background Flavivirus infected cells produce infectious virions and subviral particles, both of which are formed by the assembly of prM and E envelope proteins and are believed to undergo the same maturation process. Dengue recombinant subviral particles have been produced in cell cultures with either modified or chimeric proteins but not using the native forms of prM and E. Methodology/Principal Findings We have used a codon optimization strategy to obtain an efficient expression of native viral proteins and production of recombinant subviral particles (RSPs) for all four dengue virus (DV) serotypes. A stable HeLa cell line expressing DV1 prME was established (HeLa-prME) and RSPs were analyzed by immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy. We found that E protein is mainly present in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where assembly of RSPs could be observed. Biochemical characterization of DV1 RSPs secretion revealed both prM protein cleavage and homodimerization of E proteins before their release into the supernatant, indicating that RSPs undergo a similar maturation process as dengue virus. Pulse chase experiment showed that 8 hours are required for the secretion of DV1 RSPs. We have used HeLa-prME to develop a semi-quantitative assay and screened a human siRNA library targeting genes involved in membrane trafficking. Knockdown of 23 genes resulted in a significant reduction in DV RSP secretion, whereas for 22 others we observed an increase of RSP levels in cell supernatant. Conclusions/Significance Our data describe the efficient production of RSPs containing native prM and E envelope proteins for all dengue serotypes. Dengue RSPs and corresponding producing cell lines are safe and novel tools that can be used in the study of viral egress as well as in the development of vaccine and drugs against dengue virus."
https://openalex.org/W2167454336,"Recombinant monoclonal antibodies have emerged as important tools for cancer therapy. Despite the promise shown by antibody-based therapies, the large molecular size of antibodies limits their ability to efficiently penetrate solid tumors and precludes efficient crossing of the blood-brain-barrier into the central nervous system (CNS). Consequently, poorly vascularized solid tumors and CNS metastases cannot be effectively treated by intravenously-injected antibodies. The inherent tumor-tropic properties of human neural stem cells (NSCs) can potentially be harnessed to overcome these obstacles and significantly improve cancer immunotherapy. Intravenously-delivered NSCs preferentially migrate to primary and metastatic tumor sites within and outside the CNS. Therefore, we hypothesized that NSCs could serve as an ideal cellular delivery platform for targeting antibodies to malignant tumors.As proof-of-concept, we selected Herceptin (trastuzumab), a monoclonal antibody widely used to treat HER2-overexpressing breast cancer. HER2 overexpression in breast cancer is highly correlated with CNS metastases, which are inaccessible to trastuzumab therapy. Therefore, NSC-mediated delivery of trastuzumab may improve its therapeutic efficacy. Here we report, for the first time, that human NSCs can be genetically modified to secrete anti-HER2 immunoglobulin molecules. These NSC-secreted antibodies assemble properly, possess tumor cell-binding affinity and specificity, and can effectively inhibit the proliferation of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells in vitro. We also demonstrate that immunoglobulin-secreting NSCs exhibit preferential tropism to tumor cells in vivo, and can deliver antibodies to human breast cancer xenografts in mice.Taken together, these results suggest that NSCs modified to secrete HER2-targeting antibodies constitute a promising novel platform for targeted cancer immunotherapy. Specifically, this NSC-mediated antibody delivery system has the potential to significantly improve clinical outcome for patients with HER2-overexpressing breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2090110038,"Steatornis caripensis (the oilbird) is a very unusual bird. It supposedly never sees daylight, roosting in huge aggregations in caves during the day and bringing back fruit to the cave at night. As a consequence a large number of the seeds from the fruit they feed upon germinate in the cave and spoil.Here we use newly developed GPS/acceleration loggers with remote UHF readout to show that several assumptions about the behaviour of Steatornis caripensis need to be revised. On average, they spend only every 3(rd) day in a cave, individuals spent most days sitting quietly in trees in the rainforest where they regurgitate seeds.This provides new data on the extent of seed dispersal and the movement ecology of Steatornis caripensis. It suggests that Steatornis caripensis is perhaps the most important long-distance seed disperser in Neotropical forests. We also show that colony-living comes with high activity costs to individuals."

Despite the ubiquitous expression of expanded, polyQ-Huntingtin (ExpHtt) in the brain, striatal neurons present a higher susceptibility to the mutation. A commonly admitted hypothesis is that Dopaminergic inputs participate to this vulnerability. We previously showed that D2 receptor stimulation increased aggregate formation and neuronal death induced by ExpHtt in primary striatal neurons in culture, and chronic D2 antagonist treatment protects striatal dysfunctions induced by ExpHtt in a lentiviral-induced model system in vivo. The present work was designed to elucidate the signalling pathways involved, downstream D2 receptor (D2R) stimulation, in striatal vulnerability to ExpHtt. Methodology/Principal Findings Using primary striatal neurons in culture, transfected with a tagged-GFP version of human exon 1 ExpHtt, and siRNAs against D2R or D1R, we confirm that DA potentiates neuronal dysfunctions via D2R but not D1R stimulation. We demonstrate that D2 agonist treatment induces neuritic retraction and growth cone collapse in Htt- and ExpHtt expressing neurons. We then tested a possible involvement of the Rho/ROCK signalling pathway, which plays a key role in the dynamic of the cytoskeleton, in these processes. The pharmacological inhibitors of ROCK (Y27632 and Hydroxyfasudil), as well as siRNAs against ROCK-II, reversed D2-related effects on neuritic retraction and growth cone collapse. We show a coupling between D2 receptor stimulation and Rho activation, as well as hyperphosphorylation of Cofilin, a downstream effector of ROCK-II pathway. Importantly, D2 agonist-mediated potentiation of aggregate formation and neuronal death induced by ExpHtt, was totally reversed by Y27632 and Hydroxyfasudil and ROCK-II siRNAs. Conclusions/Significance Our data provide the first demonstration that D2R-induced vulnerability in HD is critically linked to the activation of the Rho/ROCK signalling pathway. The inclusion of Rho/ROCK inhibitors could be an interesting therapeutic option aimed at forestalling the onset of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2049470741,"Orofacial malformations resulting from genetic and/or environmental causes are frequent human birth defects yet their etiology is often unclear because of insufficient information concerning the molecular, cellular and morphogenetic processes responsible for normal facial development. We have, therefore, derived a comprehensive expression dataset for mouse orofacial development, interrogating three distinct regions – the mandibular, maxillary and frontonasal prominences. To capture the dynamic changes in the transcriptome during face formation, we sampled five time points between E10.5–E12.5, spanning the developmental period from establishment of the prominences to their fusion to form the mature facial platform. Seven independent biological replicates were used for each sample ensuring robustness and quality of the dataset. Here, we provide a general overview of the dataset, characterizing aspects of gene expression changes at both the spatial and temporal level. Considerable coordinate regulation occurs across the three prominences during this period of facial growth and morphogenesis, with a switch from expression of genes involved in cell proliferation to those associated with differentiation. An accompanying shift in the expression of polycomb and trithorax genes presumably maintains appropriate patterns of gene expression in precursor or differentiated cells, respectively. Superimposed on the many coordinated changes are prominence-specific differences in the expression of genes encoding transcription factors, extracellular matrix components, and signaling molecules. Thus, the elaboration of each prominence will be driven by particular combinations of transcription factors coupled with specific cell:cell and cell:matrix interactions. The dataset also reveals several prominence-specific genes not previously associated with orofacial development, a subset of which we externally validate. Several of these latter genes are components of bidirectional transcription units that likely share cis-acting sequences with well-characterized genes. Overall, our studies provide a valuable resource for probing orofacial development and a robust dataset for bioinformatic analysis of spatial and temporal gene expression changes during embryogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1983145057,"Background When viewing complex scenes, East Asians attend more to contexts whereas Westerners attend more to objects, reflecting cultural differences in holistic and analytic visual processing styles respectively. This eye-tracking study investigated more specific mechanisms and the robustness of these cultural biases in visual processing when salient changes in the objects and backgrounds occur in complex pictures. Methodology/Principal Findings Chinese Singaporean (East Asian) and Caucasian US (Western) participants passively viewed pictures containing selectively changing objects and background scenes that strongly captured participants' attention in a data-driven manner. We found that although participants from both groups responded to object changes in the pictures, there was still evidence for cultural divergence in eye-movements. The number of object fixations in the US participants was more affected by object change than in the Singapore participants. Additionally, despite the picture manipulations, US participants consistently maintained longer durations for both object and background fixations, with eye-movements that generally remained within the focal objects. In contrast, Singapore participants had shorter fixation durations with eye-movements that alternated more between objects and backgrounds. Conclusions/Significance The results demonstrate a robust cultural bias in visual processing even when external stimuli draw attention in an opposite manner to the cultural bias. These findings also extend previous studies by revealing more specific, but consistent, effects of culture on the different aspects of visual attention as measured by fixation duration, number of fixations, and saccades between objects and backgrounds."
https://openalex.org/W2014642981,"One of the fundamental goals in neurosciences is to elucidate the formation and retrieval of brain's associative memory traces in real-time. Here, we describe real-time neural ensemble transient dynamics in the mouse hippocampal CA1 region and demonstrate their relationships with behavioral performances during both learning and recall. We employed the classic trace fear conditioning paradigm involving a neutral tone followed by a mild foot-shock 20 seconds later. Our large-scale recording and decoding methods revealed that conditioned tone responses and tone-shock association patterns were not present in CA1 during the first pairing, but emerged quickly after multiple pairings. These encoding patterns showed increased immediate-replay, correlating tightly with increased immediate-freezing during learning. Moreover, during contextual recall, these patterns reappeared in tandem six-to-fourteen times per minute, again correlating tightly with behavioral recall. Upon traced tone recall, while various fear memories were retrieved, the shock traces exhibited a unique recall-peak around the 20-second trace interval, further signifying the memory of time for the expected shock. Therefore, our study has revealed various real-time associative memory traces during learning and recall in CA1, and demonstrates that real-time memory traces can be decoded on a moment-to-moment basis over any single trial."
https://openalex.org/W2095723762,"The ecological radiation of mammals to inhabit a variety of light environments is largely attributed to adaptive changes in their visual systems. Visual capabilities are conferred by anatomical features of the eyes as well as the combination and properties of their constituent light sensitive pigments. To test whether evolutionary switches to different niches characterized by dim-light conditions coincided with molecular adaptation of the rod pigment rhodopsin, we sequenced the rhodopsin gene in twenty-two mammals including several bats and subterranean mole-rats. We compared these to thirty-seven published mammal rhodopsin sequences, from species with divergent visual ecologies, including nocturnal, diurnal and aquatic groups. All taxa possessed an intact functional rhodopsin; however, phylogenetic tree reconstruction recovered a gene tree in which rodents were not monophyletic, and also in which echolocating bats formed a monophyletic group. These conflicts with the species tree appear to stem from accelerated evolution in these groups, both of which inhabit low light environments. Selection tests confirmed divergent selection pressures in the clades of subterranean rodents and bats, as well as in marine mammals that live in turbid conditions. We also found evidence of divergent selection pressures among groups of bats with different sensory modalities based on vision and echolocation. Sliding window analyses suggest most changes occur in transmembrane domains, particularly obvious within the pinnipeds; however, we found no obvious pattern between photopic niche and predicted spectral sensitivity based on known critical amino acids. This study indicates that the independent evolution of rhodopsin vision in ecologically specialised groups of mammals has involved molecular evolution at the sequence level, though such changes might not mediate spectral sensitivity directly."
https://openalex.org/W1997478649,"Background Local activation of Rho GTPases is important for many functions including cell polarity, morphology, movement, and growth. Although a number of molecules affecting Rho-of-Plants small GTPase (ROP) signalling are known, it remains unclear how ROP activity becomes spatially organised. Arabidopsis root hair cells produce patches of ROP at consistent and predictable subcellular locations, where root hair growth subsequently occurs. Methodology/Principal Findings We present a mathematical model to show how interaction of the plant hormone auxin with ROPs could spontaneously lead to localised patches of active ROP via a Turing or Turing-like mechanism. Our results suggest that correct positioning of the ROP patch depends on the cell length, low diffusion of active ROP, a gradient in auxin concentration, and ROP levels. Our theory provides a unique explanation linking the molecular biology to the root hair phenotypes of multiple mutants and transgenic lines, including OX-ROP, CA-rop, aux1, axr3, tip1, eto1, etr1, and the triple mutant aux1 ein2 gnomeb. Conclusions/Significance We show how interactions between Rho GTPases (in this case ROPs) and regulatory molecules (in this case auxin) could produce characteristic subcellular patterning that subsequently affects cell shape. This has important implications for research on the morphogenesis of plants and other eukaryotes. Our results also illustrate how gradient-regulated Turing systems provide a particularly robust and flexible mechanism for pattern formation."
https://openalex.org/W2044546427,"Background DNA recombination technologies such as the Cre/LoxP system advance modern biological research by allowing conditional gene regulation in vivo. However, the precise targeting of a particular cell type at a given time point has remained challenging since spatial specificity has so far depended exclusively on the promoter driving Cre recombinase expression. We have recently established split-Cre that allows DNA recombination to be controlled by coincidental activity of two promoters, thereby increasing spatial specificity of Cre-mediated DNA recombination. To allow temporal control of split-Cre-mediated DNA recombination we have now extended split-Cre by fusing split-Cre proteins with the tamoxifen inducible ERT2 domain derived from CreERT2. Methodology/Principal Findings In the split-CreERT2 system, Cre-mediated DNA recombination is controlled by two expression cassettes as well as the time of tamoxifen application. By using two independent Cre-dependent reporters in cultured cells, the combination of NCre-ERT2+ERT2-CCre was identified as having the most favorable properties of all constructs tested, showing an induction ratio of about 10 and EC50-values for 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen of 10 nM to 70 nM. Conclusions/Significance These characteristics of split-CreERT2 in vitro indicate that split-CreERT2 will be well suited for inducing DNA recombination in living mice harboring LoxP-flanked alleles. In this way, split-CreERT2 will provide a new tool of modern genetics allowing spatial and temporal precise genetic access to cell populations defined by the simultaneous activity of two promoters."
https://openalex.org/W2000785864,"Despite considerable progress in our understanding of the interplay between immune and endocrine systems, the role of thyroid hormones and their receptors in the control of adaptive immunity is still uncertain. Here, we investigated the role of thyroid hormone receptor (TR) β1 signaling in modulating dendritic cell (DC) physiology and the intracellular mechanisms underlying these immunoregulatory effects. Exposure of DCs to triiodothyronine (T3) resulted in a rapid and sustained increase in Akt phosphorylation independently of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation, which was essential for supporting T3-induced DC maturation and interleukin (IL)-12 production. This effect was dependent on intact TRβ1 signaling as small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of TRβ1 expression prevented T3-induced DC maturation and IL-12 secretion as well as Akt activation and IκB-ϵ degradation. In turn, T3 up-regulated TRβ1 expression through mechanisms involving NF-κB, suggesting an autocrine regulatory loop to control hormone-dependent TRβ1 signaling. These findings were confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, which disclosed a new functional NF-κB consensus site in the promoter region of the TRB1 gene. Thus, a T3-induced NF-κB-dependent mechanism controls TRβ1 expression, which in turn signals DCs to promote maturation and function via an Akt-dependent but PI3K-independent pathway. These results underscore a novel unrecognized target that regulates DC maturation and function with critical implications in immunopathology at the cross-roads of the immune-endocrine circuits.

These results underscore a novel unrecognized target that regulates DC maturation and function with critical implications in immunopathology at the cross-roads of the immune-endocrine circuits. The endocrine and immune systems are interconnected via a bidirectional network in which hormones affect immune function, and, in turn, immune responses are reflected in neuroendocrine changes. This bidirectional communication is possible as both systems share common ligands (hormones and cytokines) and their specific receptors (1.Verburg-van Kemenade L. Schreck C. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 2007; 152: 352Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar).

The classic genomic actions of TH are mediated by nuclear TH receptors (TR) that act mainly as hormone-inducible transcription factors. Several TRα and TRβ isoforms are encoded by the TRA and TRB genes, respectively. The TRα1, TRα2, TRβ1, and TRβ3 isoforms are widely expressed, whereas TRβ2 is predominantly restricted to the hypothalamus-pituitary axis (2.Oetting A. Yen P.M. Best Pract. Res. Clin. Endocrinol. Metabol. 2007; 21: 193-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Recent emerging evidence has also characterized the interactions of TR with co-repressor proteins, namely the nuclear co-repressor and the silencing mediator of retinoid and TH receptors. These effects involve histone deacetylase activity that mediates TR silencing in the absence of triiodothyronine (T3) and several co-activator proteins that exhibit histone acetylase activity in the presence of this hormone (2.Oetting A. Yen P.M. Best Pract. Res. Clin. Endocrinol. Metabol. 2007; 21: 193-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). However, the notion of classical or genomic mechanisms as unique actions mediated by TRs has been challenged in the past decade by descriptions of TH actions that involve extranuclear (nongenomic) effects in a variety of cell types. These TH-dependent pathways are associated to extranuclear TR localized within the cytoplasm and the plasma membrane (3.Hiroi Y. Kim H.H. Ying H. Furuya F. Huang Z. Simoncini T. Noma K. Ueki K.

Neuroendocrinol. 2008; 29: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Several cytoplasmic T3 actions mediated by TR are linked to activation of the PI3K pathway in alveolar cells (7.Lei J.

Moeller L.C. Refetoff S. Seo H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 102-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Moreover, activation of Akt, a critical component of cell growth and survival (9.Brazil D.P. Yang Z.Z. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem.

Despite considerable progress in understanding the interplay between distinct hormones and the immune cell network, the role of TH in the control of immune cell physiology has received scarce attention with studies almost exclusively focused on effector B and T lymphocytes (11.Dorshkind K. Horseman N.D. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 292-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 12.Klecha A.J. Genaro A.M. Gorelik G. Barreiro Arcos M.L. Silberman D.M. Schuman M. Garcia S.I. Pirola C. Cremaschi G.A. J. Endocrinol. 2006; 189: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, the role of TR signaling in the initiation of adaptive immunity remains elusive. Dendritic cells (DCs) are highly specialized antigen-presenting cells that recognize, process, and present antigens to naive T cells for the induction of antigen-specific immune responses (13.Guermonprez P. Valladeau J. Zitvogel L. Théry C. Amigorena S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 621-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar). Given the remarkable plasticity of these cells, manipulation of their function to favor the induction of DCs with immunogenic or tolerogenic properties could be exploited to stimulate or attenuate immune responses (14.Steinman R.M. Banchereau J. Nature. 2007; 449: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar). After in vitro or in vivo exposure to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or other microbial products, DCs undergo activation and maturation through different signaling pathways, including MAPKK1/ERK, which favors DC survival, and the Akt and NF-κB pathways, which allow for DC maturation (15.Bottero V. Withoff S. Verma I.M. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 785-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 16.Zhang T.Y. Daynes R.A. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 2517-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Signaling through NF-κB also determines the increased expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II and co-stimulatory molecules, release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and DC migration and recruitment. This coordinated process leads to sustained T cell stimulatory capacity and IL-12 production, which result in the induction of protective Th1 immunity (15.Bottero V. Withoff S. Verma I.M. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 785-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Recently, we have provided the first evidence indicating a role for TH in the control of DC maturation (17.Mascanfroni I. Montesinos Mdel M. Susperreguy S. Cervi L. Ilarregui J.M. Ramseyer V.D. Masini-Repiso A.M. Targovnik H.M. Rabinovich G.A. Pellizas C.G. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 1032-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Our initial results demonstrated the expression of TR, mainly the β1 isoform, on bone marrow-derived murine DCs and the role of T3 in driving DC maturation (17.Mascanfroni I. Montesinos Mdel M.

In this study, we investigated the signaling pathways leading to T3 effects within the DC compartment, their impact in the immunogenicity of these cells, and the relevance of TRβ1 signaling in this process. Our results demonstrate a novel link among NF-κB-dependent TRβ1 expression, T3-induced Akt activation, and the regulation of DC physiology with critical implications in immunopathology. Female C57BL/6 mice (B6; H-2b) were obtained from Ezeiza Atomic Center (Buenos Aires, Argentina). Mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions and used at 6–10 weeks old. Animal protocols were in compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the National Institutes of Health and the local institutional animal care committee. DCs were obtained as described by Inaba et al. (18.Inaba K. Inaba M. Romani N. Aya H. Deguchi M. Ikehara S. Muramatsu S. Steinman R.M. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1693-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (3331) Google Scholar). Briefly, bone marrow progenitors were collected from the femurs of C57BL/6 mice, cultured in RPMI 1640 medium, 10% fetal calf serum depleted of TH by treatment with resin AG-1-X8 (Bio-Rad) in the presence of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor from supernatants of the J558 cell line, and fed every 2 days. At day 10 of cell culture, >85% of the harvested cells expressed MHC II, CD40, CD80, and CD11c but not Gr-1. Immature DCs (iDCs) were cultured with T3 (5 nm, DCT3) or LPS (100 ng/ml; Escherichia coli strain 0111:B4; Sigma; DCLPS). Parallel cultures were maintained without stimuli and used as controls (DCControl). T3 was purchased from Sigma and prepared according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. The concentration of T3 used in the experiments led to 60–80% of thyroid receptor occupancy, a situation in which most of the biological actions of TH take place under physiological conditions (2.Oetting A. Yen P.M. Best Pract. Res. Clin. Endocrinol. Metabol. 2007; 21: 193-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). To rule out endotoxin contamination of the T3 preparation, we checked endotoxin content after reconstitution of the hormone, which raised levels lower than 0.03 IU/ml (limit of detection) by using the Limulus amebocyte lysate assay (Sigma). SDS-PAGE and blot analysis were performed essentially as described (19.Ilarregui J.M. Croci D.O. Bianco G.A. Toscano M.A. Salatino M. Vermeulen M.E. Geffner J.R. Rabinovich G.A. Nat.

Anti-TRβ1 (mouse monoclonal antibody), anti-Akt 1/2/3, anti-PI3K p85α (rabbit polyclonal antibodies), anti-NF-κB-p65 (anti-Rel A; mouse monoclonal antibody), and anti-HDAC1 (mouse monoclonal antibody) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-TRβ1 (C4) (rabbit polyclonal antibody) was purchased from Rockland. Antibodies directed against phospho-Akt (Ser-473), phospho-ERK 1, and phospho-ERK 2, (Thr-202/Tyr-204, rabbit polyclonal), phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr-180/Tyr-182, rabbit polyclonal), and phospho-JNK (Thr-183/Tyr-185, rabbit polyclonal) were obtained from Cell Signaling. Anti-IκB-ϵ and anti-IκB-α mouse monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Pharmingen. Anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mouse monoclonal antibody was obtained from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. LY294002 hydrochloride and wortmannin (PI3K inhibitors), H89 (selective cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor), and cycloheximide (CHX) were obtained from Sigma. DCs were cultured in complete medium (1.5 × 106 cells/300 μl) in the presence of T3 (5 nm) or LPS (100 ng/ml) and 10 μm LY294002 hydrochloride, 50 nm wortmannin, 20 μm H89, or 3 mm CHX added only once, at the beginning of individual experiments, for different time periods (0–60 min or 18 h) at 37 °C. LY-294002, wortmannin, H89, and CHX were resuspended in stock solution, according to the manufacturer's instruction, and stored at −20 °C. Control DC cultures were kept under the same conditions as treated cells but in the absence of drugs. The final concentration of DMSO was identical, in every culture, irrespective of individual treatments. The reactions were stopped at the indicated times by adding cold saline solution, and samples were centrifuged. Cell pellets were resuspended in loading buffer (60 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2.3% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol), boiled at 96 °C for 5 min, and stored at −80 °C. Samples were then separated by SDS-PAGE (10 or 12%), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Sigma), and then blocked with 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20. Membranes were then blotted with anti-phospho-Akt, anti-phospho-ERK 1/2, anti-phospho-p3, or anti-phospho-JNK antibodies, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG. Specific bands were developed by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were stripped and exposed to anti-Akt 1/2/3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-α-tubulin (Sigma) monoclonal antibodies. Bone marrow-derived DCs were generated as described above and cultured on coverslips for 3 days. After treatments, cells were fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.25% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS, blocked for 1 h in PBS, pH 7.4, plus 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin fraction V (Fisher), incubated with primary antibodies (mouse anti-TRβ1 sc-738, rabbit anti-Akt 1/2/3 sc-8312, and rabbit anti-PI3K p85α sc-423, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a dilution of 1:100 for 1 h, washed, and further incubated with Alexa-conjugated goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at a dilution of 1:1000. Nuclei were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 5 min, and samples were washed in PBS and mounted on glass slides using Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL) for examination using an inverted fluorescence microscope equipped for confocal microscopy (Olympus Flowview FV500, Hamburg, Germany). Images were captured using Openlab 3.1 software (Improvision, Lexington, MA) at a magnification of ×1000. Negative controls, including omission of primary antibodies, were also performed. Cells were lysed in 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 0.7 mg/ml pepstatin, and 25 mg/ml aprotinin in 1× PBS. After 10 min on ice, samples were sonicated and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min. Protein content was measured using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Cell lysates (400 μg) were incubated for 2 h with 30 μl of A/G-protein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After pre-clearing, cell lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with mouse anti-TRβ1 or rabbit anti-Akt 1/2/3 antibodies (1 μg, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 30 μl of freshly prepared A/G-protein. The immunoprecipitates were run onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Sigma). Membranes were then blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in 1× PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 (v/v) for 1 h at room temperature and probed with anti-phospho-Akt (1:500) or anti-PI3K-p85α (1:500) rabbit antibodies or an anti-TRβ1 (1:500) mouse antibody, respectively. The membranes were stripped and exposed to a rabbit anti-TRβ1 (C4) (1:500) or a mouse anti-TRβ1 (1:500) antibodies diluted in 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in 1× PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 overnight at 4 °C under gentle rocking. After washing in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 (v/v), membranes were incubated with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a dilution of 1:4000 in 5% (w/v) milk in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 (v/v) for 1 h. Immunoreactivity was visualized by using the ECL immunodetection system (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were washed twice with PBS supplemented with 2% (v/v) fetal calf serum and resuspended in 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum in PBS. Cells were then incubated with the following fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies for 30 min at 4 °C: fluorescein isothiocyanate-anti-CD11c, PE-anti-IA/IE (MHC II), PE-anti-CD40, PE-anti-CD80, and PE-anti-CD86 (Pharmingen). To determine TRβ1 expression, DCs were fixed with 1% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, treated with fluorescence-activated cell sorter permeabilizing solution (BD Biosciences), stained with a mouse anti-TRβ1 antibody (sc-738, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a dilution of 1:100, and further incubated with an Alexa-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at a dilution of 1:1000. Intracellular cytokine detection was assessed by flow cytometry as described (20.Straw A.D. MacDonald A.S. Denkers E.Y. Pearce E.J. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 727-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) using PE-conjugated anti-IL-12 monoclonal antibody (from BD Biosciences). Briefly, DCs incubated with T3 or LPS in the absence or presence of 1 μm BAY 11-7082 or 2 nm sulfasalazine (NF-κB inhibitors), 10 μm Akt 1/2 kinase inhibitor (with no inhibitory activity on PI3K) added only once at the beginning of the individual experiments were exposed to brefeldin A (10 μg/ml; Sigma) for the last 6 h of cell culture. Cells were then fixed with 1% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, treated with fluorescence-activated cell sorter permeabilizing solution, and stained with an optimal concentration of anti-cytokine monoclonal antibody or an appropriate isotype control (all from BD Biosciences). Cells (at least 10,000 viable cells) were then analyzed in a FACSAria flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using Flowjo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR). IL-12p70 detection was performed in cell culture supernatants using standard capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Coating antibody included a rat anti-mouse IL-12p70 monoclonal antibody (clone C15.6, Pharmingen). Detection antibody included biotinylated rat anti-mouse IL-12p70 monoclonal antibody (clone C17.8, Pharmingen). Streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase and 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (Sigma) were used as enzyme and substrate, respectively. Cells were plated onto six multiwell plates and grown in complete medium. After 24 h, cells were transfected with siRNA SmartPool for thyroid hormone receptor β, Akt, Rel A, or PI3K (p85α) (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO). Dharmacon also provided the negative control siRNA (scramble siRNA). Transfection was conducted as described previously (21.Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Weber K. Tuschl T. Methods. 2002; 26: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). Briefly, 200 pmol of annealed siRNA or scramble siRNAs were incubated with 7 μl of GenePorter (Gene Therapy Systems) in a volume of 100 μl of RPMI 1640 medium (serum-free) for 30 min and added to 900 μl of DC culture (2 × 106 cells) as described above. After 4 h of incubation, an equal volume of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% (v/v) fetal calf serum was added. After 24–48 h, transfected DCs were washed and used for subsequent experiments. Silencing of target genes was checked by immunoblot analysis. Nuclear and cytoplasmic DC extracts were obtained by subcellular fractionation as described previously (22.Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). The supernatant containing cytoplasm was collected and frozen at −80 °C or used immediately. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of ice-cold buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and the tube was vigorously rocked at 4 °C for 15 min on a shaking platform. The nuclear extract was centrifuged for 5 min in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C, and the supernatant was frozen in aliquots at −80 °C or used immediately. Formaldehyde cross-linking, whole cell extract preparation, immunoprecipitation, DNA purification, and PCR analysis were performed as described previously (23.Kuo M.H. Allis C.D. Methods. 1999; 19: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) with some modifications (24.Nelson J.D. Denisenko O. Bomsztyk K. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 25.Nelson J.D. Denisenko O. Sova P. Bomsztyk K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: e2Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Antibodies used for immunoprecipitation include anti-NF-κB-p65 (10 μg, sc-8008; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and an unrelated isotype control (2 μl whole serum). Sonication treatment resulted in average DNA fragment sizes of 0.5–1 kb. PCR (25–35 cycles) was carried out in a 20-μl volume with 1:100, 1:10, and 1:1 of the immunoprecipitated material and 1:10,000 of the input material. PCR products were resolved in 2% (w/v) agarose gel and visualized with 0.004 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Oligonucleotide PCR primers used for ChIP analysis amplified a DNA fragment (206 kb) homologous to the promoter of the TRB1 gene encompassing the putative NF-κB consensus site (sense, TGATCAGAGTGAGGCTGTGC, and antisense, GCTGGTGGAGTCCTGAGTTC). The relative proportions of co-immunoprecipitated promoter fragments were determined by real time PCR using the primers listed above. PCR was performed using the iCycler iQ real time PCR detection system (7500 real time PCR system. Applied Biosystems) and a SYBR Green-based kit for quantitative PCR (Bio-Rad). The relative proportions of co-immunoprecipitated promoter fragments were determined based on the threshold cycle (CT) value for each PCR. Real time PCR data analysis followed the methods described in ChIP-quantitative PCR primer assays, quantitative real time PCR assays for chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses (user manual, SuperArray Bioscience Corp.). For promoter studies, a ΔCT value was calculated for each sample by subtracting the CT value for the input (to account for differences in amplification efficiencies and DNA quantities before immunoprecipitation) from the CT value obtained for the immunoprecipitated sample. A ΔΔCT value was then calculated by subtracting the ΔCT value for the T3-treated sample from the ΔCT value of the corresponding control sample. Fold changes in occupancy (NF-κB-p65 ChIP relative to control ChIP) were then determined by raising 2 to the −ΔΔCT power. For promoter fragment analysis, each sample was quantified in triplicate on at least two separate occasions and from at least three independent immunoprecipitation experiments. Mean ± S.D. values were determined for each fold difference, and these values were subsequently used in two-tailed paired t tests to determine statistical significance, as reported in the figures. A melt curve analysis was performed for each sample after PCR amplification to ensure that a single product of expected melt curve characteristics was obtained. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's paired t test. Wilcoxon nonparametric test for paired data was used to determine the significance of the time-response curves. p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. To adjust the significance level for multiple comparisons, Bonferroni correction was applied using a corrected significance level of 0.017. All experiments were performed at least in triplicate. Given the immunostimulatory effects of T3 and the preferential cytoplasmic localization of TRβ1 on DCs (17.Mascanfroni I. Montesinos Mdel M. Susperreguy S. Cervi L. Ilarregui J.M. Ramseyer V.D. Masini-Repiso A.M. Targovnik H.M. Rabinovich G.A. Pellizas C.G. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 1032-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), in this study we investigated the intracellular pathways triggered by TRβ1 signaling on these cells and their relevance in DC physiology. Because the Akt signaling pathway fine-tunes the immunostimulatory function of DCs (26.Lam Q.L. Zheng B.J. Jin D.Y. Cao X. Lu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27587-27597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we first examined the activation of this pathway in T3-stimulated (DCT3)and control (DCControl) DCs. Bone marrow-derived iDCs were cultured in the presence or in the absence of T3 (5 nm) for 5, 15, 30, and 60 min and 18 h. A significant increase in Ser-473 phosphorylation of Akt was detected as early as 5 min following exposure of DCs to T3 with a peak detected at 30 min of incubation (versus control). The increase in Akt phosphorylation persisted even at 18 h of addition of the thyroid hormone (Fig. 1A). Remarkably, T3-induced Akt activation seemed to be independent of PI3K, as pretreatment of iDCs with PI3K inhibitors (wortmannin and LY294002) was not capable of preventing Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 1A). In turn, T3 effects did not require de novo synthesis of proteins because the addition of CHX to iDC cultures did not alter Ser-473 phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 1A). Of note, Akt phosphorylation was barely observed on DCs exposed to LPS (Fig. 1B). Given the involvement of other major signaling pathways during DC maturation (27.Ardeshna K.M. Pizzey A.R. Devereux S. Khwaja A. Blood. 2000; 96: 1039-1046Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we further examined the phosphorylation of ERK 1/2, p38, and JNK following treatment with T3 as well as the effect of the inhibition of cAMP-activated protein kinase (protein kinase A (PKA)) signaling on T3-induced Akt phosphorylation. In contrast to LPS, T3 could not trigger ERK 1/2, p38, or JNK phosphorylation when added for different time periods to DC cultures (Fig. 1C). Moreover, H89, a potent inhibitor of PKA, could not prevent T3-induced Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 1D). In addition, as PP2A (protein phosphatase 2A) negatively regulates Akt activity in various systems (28.Kim K.Y. Baek A. Hwang J.E. Choi Y.A. Jeong J. Lee M.S. Cho D.H. Lim J.S. Kim K.I. Yang Y. Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 4018-4026Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), we further explored whether a reduction of PP2A C levels could underlie T3-mediated up-regulation of Akt. Of note, the levels of PP2A C were not reduced following treatment of DCs with T3. On the contrary, PP2A C was slightly increased compared with DCs cultured with medium alone (supplemental Fig. 1). Moreover, exposure to T3 did not alter the normal interaction between Akt and PP2A C (supplemental Fig. 2), disregarding, at least in part, the participation of this serine/threonine phosphatase in T3-mediated induction of Akt. Collectively, these results support the concept of an Akt-dependent PI3K-independent mechanism underlying T3 modulation of DC physiology. In addition, this mechanism does not appear to involve other major signaling pathways, including ERK 1/2, p38, JNK, PKA, or PP2A. Given the pronounced changes induced by T3 in Akt phosphorylation, we further examined the possible interactions between TRβ1 and Akt in DCT3 and DCControl. Confocal microscopy and co-immunoprecipitation analyses revealed a striking co-localization of TRβ1 and Akt both in DCControl as well as in DCT3 (Fig. 2, A–D). This effect was similar in the absence or presence of T3 and was specific as shown by the lack of signal when we used an irrelevant isotype control antibody for immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2, B–D). This finding suggests that TRβ1 and Akt may interact physically"
https://openalex.org/W2156363532,"In recent years, the phenotypes of leukodystrophies linked to mutations in the eukaryotic initiation factor 2B genes have been extended, classically called CACH/VWM (Childhood ataxia with cntral hypomyélination/vanishing white matter disorder). The large clinical spectrum observed from the more severe antenatal forms responsible for fetal death to milder adult forms with an onset after 16 years old and restricted to slow cognitive impairment have lead to the concept of eIF2B-related disorders. The typical MRI pattern with a diffuse CSF-like aspect of the cerebral white matter can lack particularly in the adult forms whereas an increasing number of patients with clinical and MRI criteria for CACH/VWM disease but without eIF2B mutations are found. Then we propose the use of biochemical markers to help in this difficult diagnosis. The biochemical diagnosis of eIF2B-related disorder is difficult as no marker, except the recently described asialotransferrin/transferrin ratio measured in cerebrospinal fluid, has been proposed and validated until now. Decreased eIF2B GEF activity has been previously reported in lymphoblastoid cell lines from 30 eIF2B-mutated patients. Our objective was to evaluate further the utility of this marker and to validate eIF2B GEF activity in a larger cohort as a specific diagnostic test for eIF2B-related disorders.We performed eIF2B GEF activity assays in cells from 63 patients presenting with different clinical forms and eIF2B mutations in comparison to controls but also to patients with defined leukodystrophies or CACH/VWM-like diseases without eIF2B mutations. We found a significant decrease of GEF activity in cells from eIF2B-mutated patients with 100% specificity and 89% sensitivity when the activity threshold was set at < or =77.5%.These results validate the measurement of eIF2B GEF activity in patients' transformed-lymphocytes as an important tool for the diagnosis of eIF2B-related disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2020869214,"Background Interest in the cultivation of biomass crops like the C4 grass Miscanthus x giganteus (Miscanthus) is increasing as global demand for biofuel grows. In the US, Miscanthus is promoted as a crop well-suited to the Corn Belt where it could be cultivated on marginal land interposed with maize and soybean. Interactions (direct and indirect) of Miscanthus, maize, and the major Corn Belt pest of maize, the western corn rootworm, (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte, WCR) are unknown. Adding a perennial grass/biomass crop to this system is concerning since WCR is adapted to the continuous availability of its grass host, maize (Zea mays). Methodology/Principal Findings In a greenhouse and field study, we investigated WCR development and oviposition on Miscanthus. The suitability of Miscanthus for WCR development varied across different WCR populations. Data trends indicate that WCR populations that express behavioural resistance to crop rotation performed as well on Miscanthus as on maize. Over the entire study, total adult WCR emergence from Miscanthus (212 WCR) was 29.6% of that from maize (717 WCR). Adult dry weight was 75–80% that of WCR from maize; female emergence patterns on Miscanthus were similar to females developing on maize. There was no difference in the mean no. of WCR eggs laid at the base of Miscanthus and maize in the field. Conclusions/Significance Field oviposition and significant WCR emergence from Miscanthus raises many questions about the nature of likely interactions between Miscanthus, maize and WCR and the potential for Miscanthus to act as a refuge or reservoir for Corn Belt WCR. Responsible consideration of the benefits and risks associated with Corn Belt Miscanthus are critical to protecting an agroecosystem that we depend on for food, feed, and increasingly, fuel. Implications for European agroecosystems in which Miscanthus is being proposed are also discussed in light of the WCR's recent invasion into Europe."
https://openalex.org/W2034468283,"This paper aims to investigate information-theoretic network complexity measures which have already been intensely used in mathematical- and medicinal chemistry including drug design. Numerous such measures have been developed so far but many of them lack a meaningful interpretation, e.g., we want to examine which kind of structural information they detect. Therefore, our main contribution is to shed light on the relatedness between some selected information measures for graphs by performing a large scale analysis using chemical networks. Starting from several sets containing real and synthetic chemical structures represented by graphs, we study the relatedness between a classical (partition-based) complexity measure called the topological information content of a graph and some others inferred by a different paradigm leading to partition-independent measures. Moreover, we evaluate the uniqueness of network complexity measures numerically. Generally, a high uniqueness is an important and desirable property when designing novel topological descriptors having the potential to be applied to large chemical databases."
https://openalex.org/W1984042055,"Earth has experienced five major extinction events in the past 450 million years. Many scientists suggest we are now witnessing a sixth, driven by human impacts. However, it has been difficult to quantify the real extent of the current extinction episode, either for a given taxonomic group at the continental scale or for the worldwide biota, largely because comparisons of pre-anthropogenic and anthropogenic biodiversity baselines have been unavailable. Here, we compute those baselines for mammals of temperate North America, using a sampling-standardized rich fossil record to reconstruct species-area relationships for a series of time slices ranging from 30 million to 500 years ago. We show that shortly after humans first arrived in North America, mammalian diversity dropped to become at least 15%-42% too low compared to the ""normal"" diversity baseline that had existed for millions of years. While the Holocene reduction in North American mammal diversity has long been recognized qualitatively, our results provide a quantitative measure that clarifies how significant the diversity reduction actually was. If mass extinctions are defined as loss of at least 75% of species on a global scale, our data suggest that North American mammals had already progressed one-fifth to more than halfway (depending on biogeographic province) towards that benchmark, even before industrialized society began to affect them. Data currently are not available to make similar quantitative estimates for other continents, but qualitative declines in Holocene mammal diversity are also widely recognized in South America, Eurasia, and Australia. Extending our methodology to mammals in these areas, as well as to other taxa where possible, would provide a reasonable way to assess the magnitude of global extinction, the biodiversity impact of extinctions of currently threatened species, and the efficacy of conservation efforts into the future."
https://openalex.org/W2019300513,"The receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) is a multi-ligand receptor that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell surface receptors. In diabetes and Alzheimer's disease, pathological progression is accelerated by activation of RAGE. However, how RAGE influences gross behavioral activity patterns in basal condition has not been addressed to date. In search for a functional role of RAGE in normal mice, a series of standard behavioral tests were performed on adult RAGE knockout (KO) mice. We observed a solid increase of home cage activity in RAGE KO. In addition, auditory startle response assessment resulted in a higher sensitivity to auditory signal and increased prepulse inhibition in KO mice. There were no significant differences between KO and wild types in behavioral tests for spatial memory and anxiety, as tested by Morris water maze, classical fear conditioning, and elevated plus maze. Our results raise a possibility that systemic therapeutic treatments to occlude RAGE activation may have adverse effects on general activity levels or sensitivity to auditory stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2065769916,"Background Resuscitation promoting factors (RPF) are secreted proteins involved in reactivation of dormant actinobacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis. They have been considered as prospective targets for the development of new anti-tuberculosis drugs preventing reactivation of dormant tubercle bacilli, generally associated with latent tuberculosis. However, no inhibitors of Rpf activity have been reported so far. The goal of this study was to find low molecular weight compounds inhibiting the enzymatic and biological activities of Rpfs. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we describe a novel class of 2-nitrophenylthiocyanates (NPT) compounds that inhibit muralytic activity of Rpfs with IC50 1–7 µg/ml. Fluorescence studies revealed interaction of active NPTs with the internal regions of the Rpf molecule. Candidate inhibitors of Rpf enzymatic activity showed a bacteriostatic effect on growth of Micrococcus luteus (in which Rpf is essential for growth protein) at concentrations close to IC50. The candidate compounds suppressed resuscitation of dormant (“non-culturable”) cells of M. smegmatis at 1 µg/ml or delayed resuscitation of dormant M. tuberculosis obtained in laboratory conditions at 10 µg/ml. However, they did not inhibit growth of active mycobacteria under these concentrations. Conclusions/Significance NPT are the first example of low molecular weight compounds that inhibit the enzymatic and biological activities of Rpf proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2067590923,"Histone chaperones are at the hub of a diverse interaction networks integrating a plethora of chromatin modifying activities. Histone H3/H4 chaperone ASF1 is a target for cell-cycle regulated Tousled-like kinases (TLKs) and both proteins cooperate during chromatin replication. However, the precise role of post-translational modification of ASF1 remained unclear. Here, we identify the TLK phosphorylation sites for both Drosophila and human ASF1 proteins. Loss of TLK-mediated phosphorylation triggers hASF1a and dASF1 degradation by proteasome-dependent and independent mechanisms respectively. Consistent with this notion, introduction of phosphorylation-mimicking mutants inhibits hASF1a and dASF1 degradation. Human hASF1b is also targeted for proteasome-dependent degradation, but its stability is not affected by phosphorylation indicating that other mechanisms are likely to be involved in control of hASF1b levels. Together, these results suggest that ASF1 cellular levels are tightly controlled by distinct pathways and provide a molecular mechanism for post-translational regulation of dASF1 and hASF1a by TLK kinases."
https://openalex.org/W2105281034,"Immune dysregulation in HIV-1 infection is associated with increased expression of inhibitory molecules such as CTLA-4, TGF-beta, and IL-10. In this study we examined one potential mechanism for regulating TGF-beta and IL-10 expression by HIV-specific suppressor CD8+ T cells. No overlap between TGF-beta, IL-10, and IFN-gamma cytokine production by HIV-specific CD8+ T cells was observed. TGF-beta positive and IL-10 positive cells were FOXP3 negative, CD25 negative, and displayed a heterogeneous surface expression of CD127. TGF-beta and IL-10 positive CD8+ T cells did not express CTLA-4. Nevertheless, CTLA-4 blockade resulted in a significant decrease in HIV-specific TGF-beta positive and IL-10 positive CD8+ T cell responses, and a concomitant increase in HIV-specific IFN-gamma positive CD8+ T cell responses. Depletion of CD4+ T cells abrogated the impact of CTLA-4 on HIV-specific TGF-beta positive and IL-10 positive CD8+ T cells. Our study suggests that CTLA-4 Signaling on CD4+ T cells regulates the inhibitory functions of the HIV-specific suppressor CD8+ T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2079341397,"Cardiac arrest in patients with pulmonary embolism (PE) is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Thrombolysis is expected to improve the outcome in these patients. However studies evaluating rescue-thrombolysis in patients with PE are missing, mainly due to the difficulties of clinical diagnosis of PE. We aimed to determine the success influencing factors of thrombolysis during resuscitation in patients with PE.We analyzed retrospectively the outcome of 104 consecutive patients with confirmed (n = 63) or highly suspected (n = 41) PE and monitored cardiac arrest. In all patients rtPA was administrated for thrombolysis during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. In 40 of the 104 patients (38.5%) a return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) could be achieved successfully. Patients with ROSC received thrombolysis significantly earlier after CPR onset compared to patients without ROSC (13.6+/-1.2 min versus 24.6+/-0.8 min; p<0.001). 19 patients (47.5%) out of the 40 patients with initially successful resuscitation survived to hospital discharge. In patients with hospital discharge thrombolysis therapy was begun with a significantly shorter delay after cardiac arrest compared to all other patients (11.0+/-1.3 vs. 22.5+/-0.9 min; p<0.001).Rescue-thrombolysis should be considered and started in patients with PE and cardiac arrest, as soon as possible after cardiac arrest onset."
https://openalex.org/W2075754418,"Background We studied anomalous extracellular mRNAs in plasma from patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and their survival implications. mRNAs studied have been reported in the literature as markers of poor (BCL2, CCND2, MYC) and favorable outcome (LMO2, BCL6, FN1) in tumors. These markers were also analyzed in lymphoma tissues to test possible associations with their presence in plasma. Methodology/Principal Findings mRNA from 42 plasma samples and 12 tumors from patients with DLBCL was analyzed by real-time PCR. Samples post-treatment were studied. The immunohistochemistry of BCL2 and BCL6 was defined. Presence of circulating tumor cells was determined by analyzing the clonality of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes by PCR. In DLBCL, MYC mRNA was associated with short overall survival. mRNA targets with unfavorable outcome in tumors were associated with characteristics indicative of poor prognosis, with partial treatment response and with short progression-free survival in patients with complete response. In patients with low IPI score, unfavorable mRNA targets were related to shorter overall survival, partial response, high LDH levels and death. mRNA disappeared in post-treatment samples of patients with complete response, and persisted in those with partial response or death. No associations were found between circulating tumor cells and plasma mRNA. Absence of BCL6 protein in tumors was associated with presence of unfavorable plasma mRNA. Conclusions/Significance Through a non-invasive procedure, tumor-derived mRNAs can be obtained in plasma. mRNA detected in plasma did not proceed from circulating tumor cells. In our study, unfavorable targets in plasma were associated with poor prognosis in B-cell lymphomas, mainly MYC mRNA. Moreover, the unfavorable targets in plasma could help us to classify patients with poor outcome within the good prognosis group according to IPI."
https://openalex.org/W2082906075,"Background Expansion of a CAG repeat in the coding region of exon 1 in the ATXN2 gene located in human chromosome 12q24.1 causes the neurodegenerative disease spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2). In contrast to other polyglutamine (polyQ) disorders, the SCA2 repeat is not highly polymorphic in central European (CEU) controls with Q22 representing 90% of alleles, and Q23 contributing between 5–7% of alleles. Recently, the ATXN2 CAG repeat has been identified as a target of adaptive selection in the CEU population. Mouse lines deficient for atxn2 develop marked hyperphagia and obesity raising the possibility that loss-of-function mutations in the ATXN2 gene may be related to energy balance in humans. Some linkage studies of obesity related phenotypes such as antipsychotic induced weight gain have reported significant lod scores on chromosome 12q24. We tested the hypothesis that rare loss-of-function ATXN2 variants cause obesity analogous to rare mutations in the leptin, leptin receptor and MC4R genes. Methodology/Principal Findings We sequenced the coding region of ATXN2 including intron-exon boundaries in 92 severely obese children with a body mass index (BMI) >3.2 standard deviations above age- and gender-adjusted means. We confirmed five previously identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and three new SNPs resulting in two synonymous substitutions and one intronic polymorphism. Alleles encoding >Q22 were overrepresented in our sample of obese children and contributed 15% of alleles in children identified by their parents as white. SNP rs695872 closely flanking the CAG repeat showed a greatly increased frequency of C/C homozygotes and G/C heterozygotes compared with reported frequencies in the CEU population. Conclusions/Significance Although we did not identify variants leading to novel amino acid substitutions, nonsense or frameshift mutations, this study warrants further examination of variation in the ATXN2 gene in obesity and related phenotypes in a larger case-control study with emphasis on rs695872 and CAG repeat structure."
https://openalex.org/W1967787668,"Anaplasma phagocytophilum is a tick-transmitted bacterial pathogen of humans and other animals, and is an obligate intracellular parasite. Throughout the course of infection, hosts acquire temporary resistance to granulocytic anaplasmosis as they develop immunity specific for the major antigen, major surface protein 2 (Msp2). However, the bacterium then utilizes a novel recombination mechanism shuffling functional pseudogenes sequentially into an expression cassette with conserved 5' and 3' ends, bypassing host immunity. Approximately 100 pseudogenes are present in the only fully sequenced human-origin HZ genome, representing the possibility for almost unlimited antigenic diversity. In the present study, we identified a select group of 20% of the A. phagocytophilum HZ msp2 pseudogenes that have matched preferentially to human, canine, and equine expression cassettes. Pseudogenes cluster predominantly in one spatial run limited to a single genomic island in less than 50% of the genome but phylogenetically related pseudogenes are neither necessarily located in close proximity on the genome nor share similar percent identity with expression cassettes. Pseudogenes near the expression cassette (and the origin) are more likely to be expressed than those farther away. Taken together, these findings suggest that there may be natural selection pressure to retain pseudogenes in one cluster near the putative origin of replication, even though global recombination shuffles pseudogenes around the genome, separating pseudogenes that share genetic origins as well as those with similar identities."
https://openalex.org/W1964341176,"Background Individuals of African descent in the United States suffer disproportionately from diseases with a metabolic etiology (obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes), and from the pathological consequences of these disorders (hypertension and cardiovascular disease). Methodology/Principal Findings Using a combination of genetic/genomic and bioinformatics approaches, we identified a large number of genes that were both differentially expressed between American subjects self-identified to be of either African or European ancestry and that also contained single nucleotide polymorphisms that distinguish distantly related ancestral populations. Several of these genes control the metabolism of simple carbohydrates and are direct targets for the SREBP1, a metabolic transcription factor also differentially expressed between our study populations. Conclusions/Significance These data support the concept of stable patterns of gene transcription unique to a geographic ancestral lineage. Differences in expression of several carbohydrate metabolism genes suggest both genetic and transcriptional mechanisms contribute to these patterns and may play a role in exacerbating the disproportionate levels of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease observed in Americans with African ancestry."
https://openalex.org/W2012100360,"Background Hemostasis and thrombosis are regulated by agonist-induced activation of platelet integrin αIIbβ3. Integrin activation, in turn is mediated by cellular signaling via protein kinases and protein phosphatases. Although the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1c) interacts with αIIbβ3, the role of PP1c in platelet reactivity is unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings Using γ isoform of PP1c deficient mice (PP1cγ−/−), we show that the platelets have moderately decreased soluble fibrinogen binding and aggregation to low concentrations of thrombin or protease-activated receptor 4 (PAR4)-activating peptide but not to adenosine diphosphate (ADP), collagen or collagen-related peptide (CRP). Thrombin-stimulated PP1cγ−/− platelets showed decreased αIIbβ3 activation despite comparable levels of αIIbβ3, PAR3, PAR4 expression and normal granule secretion. Functions regulated by outside-in integrin αIIbβ3 signaling like adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen and clot retraction were not altered in PP1cγ−/− platelets. Thrombus formation induced by a light/dye injury in the cremaster muscle venules was significantly delayed in PP1cγ−/− mice. Phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK3)β-serine 9 that promotes platelet function, was reduced in thrombin-stimulated PP1cγ−/− platelets by an AKT independent mechanism. Inhibition of GSK3β partially abolished the difference in fibrinogen binding between thrombin-stimulated wild type and PP1cγ−/− platelets. Conclusions/Significance These studies illustrate a role for PP1cγ in maintaining GSK3β-serine9 phosphorylation downstream of thrombin signaling and promoting thrombus formation via fibrinogen binding and platelet aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W2108632192,"The reduced folate carrier (RFC) is the major transport system for folates in mammals. We previously demonstrated the existence of human RFC (hRFC) homo-oligomers and established the importance of these higher order structures to intracellular trafficking and carrier function. In this report, we examined the operational significance of hRFC oligomerization and the minimal functional unit for transport. In negative dominance experiments, multimeric transporters composed of different ratios of active (either wild type (WT) or cysteine-less (CLFL)) and inactive (either inherently inactive (Y281L and R373A) due to mutation, or resulting from inactivation of the Y126C mutant by (2-sulfonatoethyl) methanethiosulfonate (MTSES)) hRFC monomers were expressed in hRFC-null HeLa (R5) cells, and residual WT or CLFL activity was measured. In either case, residual transport activity with increasing levels of inactive mutant correlated linearly with the fraction of WT or CLFL hRFC in plasma membranes. When active covalent hRFC dimers, generated by fusing CLFL and Y126C monomers, were expressed in R5 cells and treated with MTSES, transport activity of the CLFL-CLFL dimer was unaffected, whereas Y126C-Y126C was potently (64%) inhibited; heterodimeric CLFL-Y126C and Y126C-CLFL were only partly (27 and 23%, respectively) inhibited by MTSES. In contrast to Y126C-Y126C, trans-stimulation of methotrexate uptake by intracellular folates for Y126C-CLFL and CLFL-Y126C was nominally affected by MTSES. Collectively, these results strongly support the notion that each hRFC monomer comprises a single translocation pathway for anionic folate substrates and functions independently of other monomers (i.e. despite an oligomeric structure, hRFC functions as a monomer). The reduced folate carrier (RFC) is the major transport system for folates in mammals. We previously demonstrated the existence of human RFC (hRFC) homo-oligomers and established the importance of these higher order structures to intracellular trafficking and carrier function. In this report, we examined the operational significance of hRFC oligomerization and the minimal functional unit for transport. In negative dominance experiments, multimeric transporters composed of different ratios of active (either wild type (WT) or cysteine-less (CLFL)) and inactive (either inherently inactive (Y281L and R373A) due to mutation, or resulting from inactivation of the Y126C mutant by (2-sulfonatoethyl) methanethiosulfonate (MTSES)) hRFC monomers were expressed in hRFC-null HeLa (R5) cells, and residual WT or CLFL activity was measured. In either case, residual transport activity with increasing levels of inactive mutant correlated linearly with the fraction of WT or CLFL hRFC in plasma membranes. When active covalent hRFC dimers, generated by fusing CLFL and Y126C monomers, were expressed in R5 cells and treated with MTSES, transport activity of the CLFL-CLFL dimer was unaffected, whereas Y126C-Y126C was potently (64%) inhibited; heterodimeric CLFL-Y126C and Y126C-CLFL were only partly (27 and 23%, respectively) inhibited by MTSES. In contrast to Y126C-Y126C, trans-stimulation of methotrexate uptake by intracellular folates for Y126C-CLFL and CLFL-Y126C was nominally affected by MTSES. Collectively, these results strongly support the notion that each hRFC monomer comprises a single translocation pathway for anionic folate substrates and functions independently of other monomers (i.e. despite an oligomeric structure, hRFC functions as a monomer). IntroductionFolates are members of the B class of vitamins that are required for the synthesis of nucleotide precursors, serine, and methionine in one-carbon transfer reactions (1Stokstad E.L.R. Picciano M.F. Stokstad E.L.R. Greogory J.F. Folic Acid Metabolism in Health and Disease. Wiley-Liss, New York1990: 1-21Google Scholar). Folates are hydrophilic anionic molecules that do not cross biological membranes by diffusion alone, so it is not surprising that sophisticated membrane transport systems have evolved to facilitate folate accumulation by mammalian cells. Transporter-mediated internalization of folates is required for cellular macromolecule biosynthesis, since mammals cannot synthesize folates de novo (2Sirotnak F.M. Tolner B. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 91-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 3Matherly L.H. Goldman D.I. Vitam.

Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2007; 26: 111-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). RFC achieves uphill transport of folates into cells via a mechanism involving exchange of intracellular organic phosphates for extracellular folates (5Goldman I.D. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1971; 186: 400-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). RFC serves a generalized role in folate transport and provides specialized tissue functions (3Matherly L.H. Goldman D.I. Vitam. Horm. 2003; 66: 403-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 4Matherly L.H. Hou Z. Deng Y. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2007; 26: 111-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Further, losses of RFC expression and consequently function may contribute to physiological and developmental problems related to folate deficiency (6Matherly L.H. Curr. Pharmacogenetics. 2004; 2: 287-298Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In addition to its physiological role, RFC is pharmacologically significant because it can transport antifolate drugs, such as methotrexate (Mtx), pemetrexed, and raltitrexed used for cancer (4Matherly L.H. Hou Z. Deng Y. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2007; 26: 111-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Loss of RFC expression or synthesis of mutant RFC proteins in tumor cells leads to incomplete inhibition of intracellular enzyme targets and low levels of antifolate substrate for polyglutamate synthesis, resulting in drug resistance (4Matherly L.H. Hou Z. Deng Y. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2007; 26: 111-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 7Zhao R. Goldman I.D. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7431-7457Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar).Since its cloning in the mid 1990s, RFC structure and function have been studied extensively (4Matherly L.H. Hou Z. Deng Y. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2007; 26: 111-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 8Matherly L.H. Hou Z. Vitam. Horm. 2008; 79: 145-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Using state-of-the-art molecular biology and biochemistry methods for characterizing polytopic membrane proteins, a detailed picture of the molecular structure of human RFC (hRFC) has emerged, including its membrane topology, N-glycosylation, functionally or structurally important domains and amino acids, and packing of α-helix transmembrane domains (4Matherly L.H. Hou Z. Deng Y. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2007; 26: 111-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 8Matherly L.H. Hou Z. Vitam. Horm. 2008; 79: 145-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To test hypotheses related to structure and mechanism, a three-dimensional homology model for the 591-amino acid hRFC polypeptide was generated, based on solved structures for the bacterial lactose/proton symporter LacY and glycerol 3-phosphate/inorganic phosphate antiporter GlpT as well as biochemical data for hRFC (8Matherly L.H. Hou Z. Vitam. Horm. 2008; 79: 145-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 9Hou Z. Ye J. Haska C.L. Matherly L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33588-33596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).There is growing evidence that quaternary structure involving higher order oligomers is an essential feature of the structure and function of membrane transporters (10Veenhoff L.M. Heuberger E.H. Poolman B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 242-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 11Padan E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2008; 33: 435-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Many secondary transporters exist as higher order oligomers (e.g. dimers (NhaA and LacS) or trimers (AcrB, Glt, BetP, and CaiT)), although unambiguous evidence for monomer structures (LacY and GlpT) was also reported (10Veenhoff L.M. Heuberger E.H. Poolman B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 242-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 11Padan E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2008; 33: 435-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Outside of its importance for quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and intracellular trafficking (12Sitte H.H. Farhan H. Javitch J.A. Mol. Interv. 2004; 4: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), in only a few cases have clear functional or regulatory roles for transporter oligomerization been established. For instance, it was shown for the Streptococcus thermophilus lactose transporter LacS that individual monomers cooperate with each other during the transport cycle, implying that oligomerization is essential for transport function (13Veenhoff L.M. Heuberger E.H. Poolman B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3056-3062Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For the homodimeric NhaA Na+/H+ antiporter from Escherichia coli, monomers are fully functional, yet the dimer appears to be beneficial under extreme stress conditions at alkaline pH in the presence of Na+ or Li+ (14Rimon A. Tzubery T. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 26810-26821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Our recent study presented compelling evidence that hRFC exists as a homo-oligomer (15Hou Z. Matherly L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3285-3293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). (i) hRFC was cross-linked with homobifunctional cross-linkers to form higher order complexes with molecular masses approximating those of dimers, trimers, and tetramers. (ii) When co-expressed in hRFC-null HeLa (R5) cells, hRFC proteins with different epitope tags (Myc and hemagglutinin (HA)) co-immunoprecipitated with epitope-specific antibodies. (iii) By biotinylation of surface hRFC proteins, oligomers were localized to the cell surface. (iv) Direct evidence of co-folding hRFC monomers and intracellular trafficking of oligomeric hRFC from the ER involved dominant-negative effects of mutant hRFCs (i.e. S138C) on surface expression and transport activity of wild type (WT) hRFC. (v) For another inactive mutant (R373A) with high level surface expression, co-expression at equal levels with WT hRFC resulted in co-association and some loss of transport activity compared with WT hRFC alone, although this was not systematically studied.Indeed, it is not yet established whether the association of hRFC monomers to form oligomers is obligatory to function (i.e. whether individual monomers are themselves functional or the activity of associated monomers is somehow functionally “coupled,” resulting in net concentrative uptake of folate substrates). Clearly, structural and functional characterization of oligomeric hRFC is essential, given its potential importance to understanding the molecular mechanism of folate transport.In this report, we use established complementary approaches to examine the operational significance of hRFC oligomerization and to determine the “minimal functional unit” for (anti)folate membrane transport. These include “negative dominance” experiments (10Veenhoff L.M. Heuberger E.H. Poolman B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 242-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 13Veenhoff L.M. Heuberger E.H. Poolman B.

Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31044-31048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) involving functional studies on hRFC multimeric transporters composed of co-expressed active (either WT or cysteine-less full-length (CLFL)) and inactive (either inherently inactive due to mutation (Y281L and R373A) or resulting from inactivation of a Cys insertion mutant (Y126C) by (2-sulfonatoethyl) methanethiosulfonate (MTSES)) hRFC monomers; and expression of dimeric concatameric hRFC constructs (19Kao L.

Biol. 2005; 350: 102-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), generated by fusing CLFL and Y126C mutant hRFCs, followed by functional studies after MTSES treatment. Our results demonstrate that despite their co-association in forming oligomers, hRFC monomers are not only capable of mediating cellular uptake of folate substrates but indeed comprise the operational minimal functional unit for membrane transport by this system.DISCUSSIONThe present study significantly expands upon our recent report that hRFC, the major folate membrane transporter in human cells and tissues, exists as a homo-oligomer (15Hou Z. Matherly L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3285-3293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In our prior study, functional oligomeric WT hRFC was expressed at the cell surface of transfected R5 HeLa cells. When an inactive hRFC mutant (S138C) with impaired intracellular trafficking was co-expressed with WT hRFC, a dominant negative phenotype resulted with profoundly decreased WT hRFC surface expression due to defective intracellular trafficking and apparent retention in the ER (15Hou Z. Matherly L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3285-3293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). By contrast, another inactive hRFC mutant (R373A) was highly expressed in plasma membranes as an oligomer with WT carrier and appeared to suppress WT hRFC activity, albeit substantially less than for S138C. These results established that homo-oligomers composed of hRFC monomers are especially critical for cellular trafficking from the ER to plasma membranes and raised the possibility of a dominant negative effect of mutant hRFC on WT hRFC function, implying functional coupling between monomers. They also provided strong impetus for the functional characterization of oligomeric hRFC, as described herein. In this report, we used separate complementary approaches to characterize the minimal functional unit for hRFC (i.e. to establish whether individual hRFC monomers within the hRFC oligomer are themselves functional and/or if there was evidence of functional cooperativity between hRFC monomers).We initially applied negative dominance strategies used by others for assessing functional interactions between monomers in secondary transporters (13Veenhoff L.M. Heuberger E.H. Poolman B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3056-3062Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 16Bamber L. Harding M. Monné M. Slotboom D.J. Kunji E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 10830-10834Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 17MacKinnon R. Nature. 1991; 350: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar, 18Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31044-31048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), involving mixtures of active and inactive monomeric carriers and characterizing levels of the individual monomeric forms and net transport activities of the mixtures. These methods require that the different mutant and WT monomers be expressed independently and that their levels are directly proportional to the amounts of plasmid DNAs used for transfections. Of course, these methods also assume the random formation of hetero-oligomers between WT and mutant subunits (13Veenhoff L.M. Heuberger E.H. Poolman B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3056-3062Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), which for a dimer would constitute at most 50% of the total forms (with 25% each for the homodimeric forms). Further, should negative dominance interactions between inactive and active monomers occur, a nearly complete suppression of transport should ensue. Although it is possible that dominant inhibitory effects of mutant monomers may be incomplete, any deviation from linearity in the graphic analysis provides strong evidence for functional interactions between monomers.We co-expressed inactive hRFC mutants that efficiently targeted to the cell surface, including R373A (15Hou Z. Matherly L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3285-3293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and Y281L with WT hRFC, and CLFL with a uniquely MTSES-sensitive Cys insertion mutant (Y126C) (9Hou Z. Ye J. Haska C.L. Matherly L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33588-33596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) in a CLFL background, followed by MTSES treatment. Although it is possible that there could conceivably be differential retention in the ER and/or preferential oligomerization involving WT or mutant monomers, resulting in a somewhat biased distribution of monomers comprising membrane oligomers, mutant and WT or CLFL monomers were co-immunoprecipitated at similar levels, suggesting otherwise. For both experimental designs, essentially identical results were obtained, such that residual transport in the presence of inactive mutant (R373A, Y281L) or following inhibition of Y126C with MTSES showed a linear correlation with the fraction of active hRFC (WT and CLFL, respectively). This strongly argues that WT and CLFL hRFCs can function independently of their oligomeric associations with the inactive monomers (e.g. R373A and Y126C, respectively). The apparent loss of WT transport activity in our prior study with co-expressed R373A and WT hRFCs, compared with WT hRFC alone (15Hou Z. Matherly L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3285-3293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), probably reflects the different experimental design and may result from slight variations in co-folding of mutant and WT monomers that manifest as a modest decrease in net transport activity rather than direct functional coupling between hRFC monomers.An alternative experimental strategy that circumvents the requirement for random oligomerization involves expression of individual active and inactive monomers as covalent concatameric dimers, which increases the maximum percentage of heterodimers from 50 to 100%. This approach was first used with voltage-gated K+ channels (30Isacoff E.Y. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1990; 345: 530-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) and has since been applied to other membrane proteins, including aquaporins (31Mathai J.C. Agre P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 923-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), Na+,K+-ATPase (32Emerick M.C. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol.

Biol. 2005; 350: 102-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). With LacS, the use of covalent dimers of tandem fused active and inactive subunits, combined with LacS heterodimers of active and conditionally inactive monomers, implied a functional coupling in the proton motive force-driven uptake cycle, most likely via a conformational change associated with reorientation of the empty binding site (20Geertsma E.R. Duurkens R.H. Poolman B. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 350: 102-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).For our study, we generated and expressed covalent head-to-tail dimers between CLFL and Y126C hRFC monomers in R5 HeLa cells. The covalent dimers targeted efficiently to plasma membranes as higher molecular mass species (approximately twice that for monomeric hRFCs), whereupon they were active for [3H]Mtx transport and were trans-stimulated following preloading with a high concentration of leucovorin, establishing bidirectional transport fluxes. For the Y126C-Y126C concatamer, treatment with MTSES resulted in an appreciable loss of transport activity and a nearly complete loss of trans-stimulation. The incomplete inhibition of transport activity (∼50% of the level for CLFL-CLFL hRFC) and nominal effect on trans-stimulation for the Y126C-CLFL and CLFL-Y126C heterodimers by MTSES provided further evidence that each hRFC monomer comprises a separate translocation pathway that functions independently of the functional status of the associated monomer(s).Although our results establish the functional independence of the individual monomers comprising oligomeric hRFC, it remains an open question whether WT hRFC monomers may still require oligomerization to function, even if this involves their association with mutant inactive hRFC monomers. Unfortunately, this is not easily addressed in the absence of an approach for generating and validating mutant monomeric hRFC. Current studies are under way in this pursuit.Finally, our results raise the intriguing question of what possible biological significance there is for a functional monomeric hRFC that assembles as oligomers independent of a direct mechanistic role in membrane translocation of folate substrates. Oligomerization can be envisaged to serve a regulatory role by influencing plasma membrane stabilities of transporters or by modulating protein/protein interactions in the plasma membrane (19Kao L. Sassani P. Azimov R. Pushkin A. Abuladze N. Peti-Peterdi J. Liu W. Newman D. Kurtz I. J. Biol.

Chem. 2008; 283: 15975-15987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Our previous results (15Hou Z. Matherly L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3285-3293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) imply that hRFC oligomerization can regulate hRFC trafficking from the ER to the cell surface. Thus, hRFC oligomerization may be important to antifolate resistance and impaired accumulation via effects on membrane trafficking/transporter stability. An interesting extension of this as a potential means of circumventing drug resistance involves treatments with small molecule ligands (e.g. folates) to promote co-folding and hRFC oligomer formation, which may result in increased surface targeting of both WT and mutant hRFCs. An analogous use of “pharmacologic chaperones” to promote surface trafficking of mutant proteins was described for other membrane proteins ranging from P-glycoprotein to cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator and human ERG (38Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2005; 37: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 39Gong Q. Jones M.A. Zhou Z. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 28683-28689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For hRFC, such a mechanism may have broader regulatory significance as a means of acutely responding to levels of extracellular folate cofactors. Although no unique and unambiguous biological roles for the R27H substitution resulting from the G80A polymorphism in hRFC (4Matherly L.H. Hou Z. Deng Y. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2007; 26: 111-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 6Matherly L.H. Curr.

Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2007; 26: 111-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) have been identified, the possibility that these primary sequence modifications may impact carrier function at the level of hRFC oligomerization is not unreasonable. Similarly, no obvious biological roles for naturally occurring modified hRFC transcripts (4Matherly L.H. Hou Z. Deng Y. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2007; 26: 111-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 6Matherly L.H. Curr. Pharmacogenetics. 2004; 2: 287-298Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and encoded proteins have been described, although one form (i.e. 988 bp deletion in exon 7) was reported to functionally modulate hRFC activity (41Drori S. Sprecher H. Shemer G. Jansen G. Goldman I.D. Assaraf Y.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 690-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). By analogy, an alternatively spliced form of the oligomeric norepinephrine transporter with variations in the 3′-UTR was found to act as a dominant negative inhibitor, resulting in a reduction in the level of plasma membrane protein (42Kitayama S. Ikeda T. Mitsuhata C. Sato T. Morita K. Dohi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10731-10736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).

In addition to its physiological role, RFC is pharmacologically significant because it can transport antifolate drugs, such as methotrexate (Mtx), pemetrexed, and raltitrexed used for cancer (4Matherly L.H. Hou Z. Deng Y. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2007; 26: 111-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Loss of RFC expression or synthesis of mutant RFC proteins in tumor cells leads to incomplete inhibition of intracellular enzyme targets and low levels of antifolate substrate for polyglutamate synthesis, resulting in drug resistance (4Matherly L.H. Hou Z. Deng Y. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2007; 26: 111-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 7Zhao R. Goldman I.D. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7431-7457Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar).Since its cloning in the mid 1990s, RFC structure and function have been studied extensively (4Matherly L.H. Hou Z. Deng Y. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2007; 26: 111-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 8Matherly L.H."
https://openalex.org/W2071758387,"Peptide:N-glycanase catalyzes the detachment of N-linked glycan chains from glycopeptides or glycoproteins by hydrolyzing the beta-aspartylglucosaminyl bond. Peptide:N-glycanase in yeast binds to Rad23p through its N-terminus. In this study, the complex formed between Peptide:N-glycanase and Rad23p was found to exhibit enhanced deglycosylation activity, which suggests an important role for this enzyme in the misfolded glycoprotein degradation pathway in vivo. To investigate the role of this enzyme in this pathway, we made stepwise deletions of the N-terminal helices of peptide:N-glycanase. Enzymatic analysis of the deletion mutants showed that deletion of the N-terminal H1 helix (Png1p-DeltaH1) enhanced the deglycosylation activity of N-glycanase towards denatured glycoproteins. In addition, this mutant exhibited high deglycosylation activity towards native glycoproteins. Dynamic simulations of the wild type and N-terminal H1 deletion mutant implied that Png1p-DeltaH1 is more flexible than wild type Png1p. The efficient deglycosylation of Png1p-DeltaH1 towards native and non-native glycoproteins offers a potential biotechnological application."
https://openalex.org/W2023013751,"It has been reported that protamine (>10 microg/ml) blocks single skeletal RyR1 channels and inhibits RyR1-mediated Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum microsomes. We extended these studies to cardiac RyR2 reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers. We found that protamine (0.02-20 microg/ml) added to the cytosolic surface of fully activated RyR2 affected channel activity in a voltage-dependent manner. At membrane voltage (V(m); SR lumen-cytosol) = 0 mV, protamine induced conductance transitions to several intermediate states (substates) as well as full block of RyR2. At V(m)>10 mV, the substate with the highest level of conductance was predominant. Increasing V(m) from 0 to +80 mV, decreased the number of transitions and residence of the channel in this substate. The drop in current amplitude (full opening to substate) had the same magnitude at 0 and +80 mV despite the approximately 3-fold increase in amplitude of the full opening. This is more similar to rectification of channel conductance induced by other polycations than to the action of selective conductance modifiers (ryanoids, imperatoxin). A distinctive effect of protamine (which might be shared with polylysines and histones but not with non-peptidic polycations) is the activation of RyR2 in the presence of nanomolar cytosolic Ca2+ and millimolar Mg2+ levels. Our results suggest that RyRs would be subject to dual modulation (activation and block) by polycationic domains of neighboring proteins via electrostatic interactions. Understanding these interactions could be important as such anomalies may be associated with the increased RyR2-mediated Ca2+ leak observed in cardiac diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2115270818,"Cross-orientation suppression (COS) in striate cortex has been implicated in the efficient encoding of visual stimuli. We show that release from COS facilitates the decoding of 3-D shape. In planar surfaces overlaid with textures, slanting the surface can increase the visibility of the component parallel to the slant. Since this component provides the orientation flows that signify 3-D shape, the enhancement of visibility facilitates 3-D slant perception. Contrast thresholds reveal that this enhancement results from a decrease in COS when 3-D slant creates a frequency mismatch between texture components. We show that coupling compressive nonlinearities in LGN neurons with expansive nonlinearities in cortical neurons can model the frequency-specific component of suppression."
https://openalex.org/W2005186170,"Questions about the changes of biological systems in response to hostile environmental factors are important but not easy to answer. Often, the traditional description with differential equations is difficult due to the overwhelming complexity of the living systems. Another way to describe complex systems is by simulating them with phenomenological models such as the well-known evolutionary agent-based model (EABM). Here we developed an EABM to simulate cell colonies as a multi-agent system that adapts to hyper-gravity in starvation conditions. In the model, the cell's heritable characteristics are generated and transferred randomly to offspring cells. After a qualitative validation of the model at normal gravity, we simulate cellular growth in hyper-gravity conditions. The obtained data are consistent with previously confirmed theoretical and experimental findings for bacterial behavior in environmental changes, including the experimental data from the microgravity Atlantis and the Hypergravity 3000 experiments. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to utilize an EABM with realistic qualitative description to examine the effects of hypergravity and starvation on complex cellular entities."
