https://openalex.org/W2612285146,"Childhood maltreatment increases the risk of subsequent depression, anxiety and alcohol abuse, but the rate of resilient victims is unknown. Here, we investigated the rate of victims that do not suffer from clinical levels of these problems after severe maltreatment in a population-based sample of 10980 adult participants. Compared to men, women reported more severe emotional and sexual abuse, as well as more severe emotional neglect. For both genders, severe emotional abuse (OR = 3.80 [2.22, 6.52]); severe physical abuse (OR = 3.97 [1.72, 9.16]); severe emotional neglect (OR = 3.36 [1.73, 6.54]); and severe physical neglect (OR = 11.90 [2.66, 53.22]) were associated with depression and anxiety while only severe physical abuse (OR = 3.40 [1.28, 9.03]) was associated with alcohol abuse. Looking at men and women separately, severe emotional abuse (OR = 6.05 [1.62, 22.60] in men; OR = 3.74 [2.06, 6.81] in women) and severe physical abuse (OR = 6.05 [1.62, 22.60] in men; OR = 3.03 [0.99, 9.33] in women) were associated with clinical levels of depression and anxiety. In addition, in women, severe sexual abuse (OR = 2.40 [1.10, 5.21]), emotional neglect (OR = 4.78 [2.40, 9.56]), and severe physical neglect (OR = 9.86 [1.99, 48.93]) were associated with clinical levels of depression and anxiety. Severe emotional abuse in men (OR = 3.86 [0.96, 15.48]) and severe physical abuse in women (OR = 5.18 [1.48, 18.12]) were associated with alcohol abuse. Concerning resilience, the majority of severely maltreated participants did not report clinically significant levels of depression or anxiety (72%), or alcohol abuse (93%) in adulthood. Although the majority of severely abused or neglected individuals did not show clinical levels of depression, anxiety or alcohol use, severe childhood maltreatment increased the risk for showing clinical levels of psychopathology in adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W2612575461,"Disruption of the Gys2 gene encoding the liver isoform of glycogen synthase generates a mouse strain (LGSKO) that almost completely lacks hepatic glycogen, has impaired glucose disposal, and is pre-disposed to entering the fasted state. This study investigated how the lack of liver glycogen increases fat accumulation and the development of liver insulin resistance. Insulin signaling in LGSKO mice was reduced in liver, but not muscle, suggesting an organ-specific defect. Phosphorylation of components of the hepatic insulin-signaling pathway, namely IRS1, Akt, and GSK3, was decreased in LGSKO mice. Moreover, insulin stimulation of their phosphorylation was significantly suppressed, both temporally and in an insulin dose response. Phosphorylation of the insulin-regulated transcription factor FoxO1 was somewhat reduced and insulin treatment did not elicit normal translocation of FoxO1 out of the nucleus. Fat overaccumulated in LGSKO livers, showing an aberrant distribution in the acinus, an increase not explained by a reduction in hepatic triglyceride export. Rather, when administered orally to fasted mice, glucose was directed toward hepatic lipogenesis as judged by the activity, protein levels, and expression of several fatty acid synthesis genes, namely, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase, SREBP1c, chREBP, glucokinase, and pyruvate kinase. Furthermore, using cultured primary hepatocytes, we found that lipogenesis was increased by 40% in LGSKO cells compared with controls. Of note, the hepatic insulin resistance was not associated with increased levels of pro-inflammatory markers. Our results suggest that loss of liver glycogen synthesis diverts glucose toward fat synthesis, correlating with impaired hepatic insulin signaling and glucose disposal."
https://openalex.org/W2613573069,"End-stage differentiation of antigen-specific T-cells may precede loss of immune responses against e.g. viral infections after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Antigen-specific CD8+ T-cells detected by HLA/peptide multimers largely comprise CD45RA-/CCR7- effector memory (TEM) and CD45RA+/CCR7- TEMRA subsets. A majority of terminally differentiated T-cells is considered to be part of the heterogeneous TEMRA subset. The senescence marker CD57 has been functionally described in memory T-cells mainly composed of central memory (TCM) and TEM cells. However, its role specifically in TEMRA cells remained undefined. Here, we investigated the relevance of CD57 to separate human CD8+ TEMRA cells into functionally distinct subsets. CD57- CD8+ TEMRA cells isolated from healthy donors had considerably longer telomeres and showed significantly more BrdU uptake and IFN-γ release upon stimulation compared to the CD57+ counterpart. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) specific T-cells isolated from patients after allogeneic SCT were purified into CD57+ and CD57- TEMRA subsets. CMV specific CD57- TEMRA cells had longer telomeres and a considerably higher CMV peptide sensitivity in BrdU uptake and IFN-γ release assays compared to CD57+ TEMRA cells. In contrast, CD57+ and CD57- TEMRA cells showed comparable peptide specific cytotoxicity. Finally, CD57- CD8+ TEMRA cells partially changed phenotypically into TEM cells and gained CD57 expression, while CD57+ CD8+ TEMRA cells hardly changed phenotypically and showed considerable cell death after in vitro stimulation. To the best of our knowledge, these data show for the first time that CD57 separates CD8+ TEMRA cells into a terminally differentiated CD57+ population and a so far functionally undescribed ""young"" CD57- TEMRA subset with high proliferative capacity and differentiation plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2613325709,"African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV) is a high-consequence transboundary animal pathogen that often causes hemorrhagic disease in swine with a case fatality rate close to 100%. Lack of treatment or vaccine for the disease makes it imperative that safe and efficacious vaccines are developed to safeguard the swine industry. In this study, we evaluated the immunogenicity of seven adenovirus-vectored novel ASFV antigens, namely A151R, B119L, B602L, EP402RΔPRR, B438L, K205R and A104R. Immunization of commercial swine with a cocktail of the recombinant adenoviruses formulated in adjuvant primed strong ASFV antigen-specific IgG responses that underwent rapid recall upon boost. Notably, most vaccinees mounted robust IgG responses against all the antigens in the cocktail. Most importantly and relevant to vaccine development, the induced antibodies recognized viral proteins from Georgia 2007/1 ASFV-infected cells by IFA and by western blot analysis. The recombinant adenovirus cocktail also induced ASFV-specific IFN-γ-secreting cells that were recalled upon boosting. Evaluation of local and systemic effects of the recombinant adenovirus cocktail post-priming and post-boosting in the immunized animals showed that the immunogen was well tolerated and no serious negative effects were observed. Taken together, these outcomes showed that the adenovirus-vectored novel ASFV antigen cocktail was capable of safely inducing strong antibody and IFN-γ+ cell responses in commercial swine. The data will be used for selection of antigens for inclusion in a multi-antigen prototype vaccine to be evaluated for protective efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2612115802,"While timelines for clinical development have been extensively studied, there is little data on the broader path from initiation of research on novel drug targets, to approval of drugs based on this research. We examined timelines of translational science for 138 drugs and biologicals approved by the FDA from 2010-2014 using an analytical model of technology maturation. Research on targets for 102 products exhibited a characteristic (S-curve) maturation pattern with exponential growth between statistically defined technology initiation and established points. The median initiation was 1974, with a median of 25 years to the established point, 28 years to first clinical trials, and 36 years to FDA approval. No products were approved before the established point, and development timelines were significantly longer when the clinical trials began before this point (11.5 vs 8.5 years, p<0.0005). Technological maturation represents the longest stage of translation, and significantly impacts the efficiency of drug development."

https://openalex.org/W2613076358,"In January 2016, a combined outbreak of highly pathogenic (HP) avian influenza virus (AIV) and low pathogenicity (LP) AIV occurred in commercial turkeys in the state of Indiana, United States. Genetically, the viruses were highly similar, belonged to the North American wild bird lineage, and had not been previously detected in poultry. In order to understand the pathobiology of the H7N8 LPAIV and HPAIV, infectivity, transmission and pathogenicity studies were conducted in chickens, turkeys, and mallards. Among the three species the lowest mean infectious dose for both the LP and HP phenotype was for turkeys, and also disease from the LPAIV was only observed with turkeys. Furthermore, although the HPAIV was lethal for both chickens and turkeys, clinical signs caused by the HPAIV isolate differed between the two species; neurological signs were only observed in turkeys. Mallards could be infected with and transmit both viruses to contacts, but neither caused clinical disease. Interestingly, with all three species, the mean infectious dose of the HP isolate was at least ten times lower than that of the LP isolate. This study corroborates the high susceptibility of turkeys to AIV as well as a pathobiology that is different from chickens. Further, this study demonstrates that mallards can be asymptomatically infected with HP and LP AIV from gallinaceous poultry and may not just be involved in transmitting AIV to them."
https://openalex.org/W2612534959,"It has been hypothesized that HLA class II alleles associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) preferentially present self-antigens altered by post-translational modification, such as citrullination. To understand the role of citrullination we tested four RA-associated citrullinated epitopes and their corresponding wild-type version for binding to 28 common HLA class II. Binding patterns were variable, and no consistent impact of citrullination was identified. Indeed, in one case citrullination significantly increased binding compared to the WT peptide, in another citrullination was associated with a reduction in promiscuity by 40%. For a more comprehensive analysis, we tested over 200 citrullinated peptides derived from vimentin and collagen II for their capacity to bind the RA-associated shared epitope alleles DRB1*01:01 and DRB1*04:01. The overall effect of citrullination on binding was found to be relatively minor, and only rarely associated with 3-fold increases or decreases in affinity. Previous studies have suggested that citrullination of MHC anchor residues, in particular P4, is associated with generation of novel RA-associated epitopes. However, analysis of the predicted MHC-binding cores of all peptides tested found that in modified peptides with increased binding affinity the citrullinated residue was predicted to occupy an anchor position in only a minority of cases. Finally, we also show that identification of citrullinated peptide binders could be facilitated by using the NetMHCIIpan 3.1 algorithm, representing citrullination as a wildcard. Our studies identify a total of 117 citrullinated peptides that bound RA-associated alleles with an affinity of 1000 nM or better."
https://openalex.org/W2611966998,"How to quantify the uncertain information in the framework of Dempster-Shafer evidence theory is still an open issue. Quite a few uncertainty measures have been proposed in Dempster-Shafer framework, however, the existing studies mainly focus on the mass function itself, the available information represented by the scale of the frame of discernment (FOD) in the body of evidence is ignored. Without taking full advantage of the information in the body of evidence, the existing methods are somehow not that efficient. In this paper, a modified belief entropy is proposed by considering the scale of FOD and the relative scale of a focal element with respect to FOD. Inspired by Deng entropy, the new belief entropy is consistent with Shannon entropy in the sense of probability consistency. What's more, with less information loss, the new measure can overcome the shortage of some other uncertainty measures. A few numerical examples and a case study are presented to show the efficiency and superiority of the proposed method."
https://openalex.org/W2613852621,"The aim of this study is twofold. First, we expand on the literature by testing whether generalized trust is negatively related to anti-immigrant sentiments in Europe. Second, we examine to what extent the relation between generalized trust and anti-immigrant sentiments is dependent upon cross-group friendships. We apply multilevel linear regression modeling to representative survey data enriched with levels of ethnic diversity covering 21 European countries. Results show that both generalized trust and cross-group friendship are negatively related to anti-immigrant sentiments. However, there is a negligible positive relation between generalized trust and cross-group friendship (r = .10), and we can clearly observe that they operate independently from one another. Hence, trusting actors are not more likely to form more cross-group friendships, and cross-group friendship do not lead to the development of more generalized trust. Instead, the findings show that generalized trust leads immigrants too to be included in the radius of trusted others and, as a consequence, the benign effects of generalized trust apply to them as well. We conclude that the strength of generalized trust is a form of generalization, beyond the confines of individual variations in intergroup experiences."
https://openalex.org/W2612900737,"We have recently shown that the expression of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 2 channel, TRPV2, is upregulated in the peri-infarct zone 3-5 days following an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Further analysis has demonstrated that invading monocytes maturing to macrophages merely harbor the documented elevated expression of this channel.Assess cardiac function in TRPV2-KO mice compared to TRPV2-WT following AMI and analyze the potential involvement of TRPV2-expressing macrophages in the recovery process.TRPV2-KO or WT mice were induced with AMI by ligation of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). In another set of experiments, TRPV2-KO mice induced with AMI, were intravenously (IV) injected with WT or TRPV2-KO peritoneal macrophages in order to directly assess the potential contribution of TRPV2-expressing macrophages to cardiac healing. Cardiac parameters were obtained by echocardiography 1 day and 30 days post infarction. The relative changes in the ejection fraction (EF) and additional cardiac parameters between baseline (day 1) and day 30 were calculated and statistical significance was determined (SPSS).The in vivo study showed that while EF was significantly decreased in the WT animals between baseline and day 30, EF was only slightly and insignificantly reduced in the KO animals. Likewise LVESD and LVESA were significantly modified exclusively in the WT animals. Moreover, intravenous administration of peritoneal WT macrophages, but not KO macrophages, significantly reduced survival of post-MI TRPV2-KO mice.The data suggest that knockout of the TRPV2 channel may attenuate macrophage-dependent pro-inflammatory processes and result in better cardiac recovery. TRPV2 may thus represent a novel therapeutic target for treatment of patients undergoing an acute MI."
https://openalex.org/W2612876128,"Revision total knee arthoplasty often requires modular implants to treat bone defects of varying severity. In some cases, it may not be clear which module size and implant combination (e.g. sleeve and stem) should be chosen for a specific defect. When balancing implant stability and osseointegration against stress-shielding, it is important to choose an appropriate implant combination in order to match the given level of bone loss. Therefore, the necessity of stems in less extensive tibial defects and the advantage of different stems (lengths and stiffnesses) in combination with large metaphyseal sleeves on implant fixation and bone flexibility using a modular tibial revision knee system, were analyzed.Four different stem combinations for a tibial revision implant (Sigma TC3, DePuy) were compared to an intact bone. Standardized implantation with n = 4 synthetic tibial bones was performed after generating an Anderson Orthopaedic Research Institute (AORI) Type T1 bone defect. Axial torques around the longitudinal stem axis and varus-valgus torques were separately applied to the implant. Micromotions of bone and implant were tracked using a digital image correlation system to calculate relative micromotions at the implant-bone-interface and bone deformation.Overall, using stems reduced the proximal micromotions of tray and sleeve compared to no stem, while reducing bone deformation proximally at the same time, indicating some potential for proximal stress-shielding compared to no stem. The potential for increased proximal stress-shield due to reduced proximal deformation appeared to be greater when using the longer stems. The location of lowest relative micromotions was also more distal when using long stems as opposed to short stems. A short stem (especially a smaller diameter short stem which still achieves diaphyseal fixation) displayed less potential for stress-shielding, but greater bone deformation distal to the tip of the stem than in the natural model.In the case of tibial revision implants with metaphyseal sleeves in a simple fully contained Type I defect, the absence of a stem provides for more natural bone deformation. However, adding a stem reduces overall relative micromotions, while introducing some risk of proximal stress-shielding due to increased diaphyseal fixation. Increasing stem length intensifies this effect. Short stems offered a balance between reduced micromotions and more proximal bone deformation that reduced the potential for stress-shielding when compared to long stems. A short stem with slightly smaller diameter (simulating a less stiff stem which still has diaphyseal fixation) increased the proximal bone deformation, but also tended to increase the bone deformation even further at the distal stem's tip.In conclusion, further investigation should be conducted on fully contained Type I defects and the addition of a stem to offer better initial stability, taking into account stem length (i.e. shorter or more flexible stems) to support metaphyseal fixation and allowing bending found in intact bone. In addition, further study into more extensive tibial defects is required to determine if the stability/micromotion trends observed in this study with stems and sleeves in Type I defects still apply in cases of extensive proximal bone loss."
https://openalex.org/W2613256786,"Objective Diabetes mellitus is an emerging epidemic in the Arab world. Although high diabetes prevalence is documented in Israeli Arabs, information from cohort studies is scant. Methods This is a population study, based on information derived between 2007–2011, from the electronic database of the largest health fund in Israel, among Arabs and Jews. Prevalence, 4-year-incidence and diabetes hazard ratios [HRs], adjusted for sex and the metabolic-syndrome [MetS]-components, were determined in 3 age groups (<50 years, 50–59 years, and ≥60 years). Results The study cohort included 17,044 Arabs (males: 49%, age: 39.4±17.3) and 16,012 Jews (males: 50%, age: 40.5 ±17.6). The overall age and sex-adjusted diabetes prevalence rates were much higher among Arabs 18.4% (95%CI: 17.6–19.1); and 10.3% (95%CI: 9.7–10.9) among Jews. Arab females had higher prevalence rates 20.0% (95%CI: 19–21) than Arab males 16.7% (95%CI: 15.7–17.8). Annual incidence rates were also significantly higher among Arabs 2.9% (95%CI: 2.7–3.1) than among Jews 1.7% (95%CI: 1.6–1.8). This held true across all age and sex subgroups. Adjustment for body mass index [BMI] attenuated HR estimates associated with Arab ethnicity across all age subgroups, mainly in the <50yrs age group from HR 2.04 (95%CI: 1.74–2.40) to 1.64 (95%CI: 1.40–1.92). BMI at incident diabetes among females was higher in Arabs than Jews. Males, however, did not differ by ethnicity. Conclusion Arabs, mainly female, have high incidence and prevalence of diabetes. This excess risk is only partially explained by the high prevalence of obesity. Effective culturally-congruent diabetes prevention and treatment and an effective engagement partnership with the Arab community are of paramount need."
https://openalex.org/W2613099904,"Purpose To measure the optic disc rotation around the vertical and horizontal disc axis and to evaluate associations with general and ocular parameters. Design Population-based study Methods In the Beijing Eye Study, 3468 participants (mean age:64.6±9.8 years; range:50–93 years) underwent an ophthalmological examination which included spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) with enhanced depth imaging. Using the OCT images, we determined the amount of the rotation of the optic disc (defined as Bruch´s membrane opening (BMO)) around the vertical axis and horizontal axis. Results Optic disc rotation measurements were available for 3037 (87.6%) individuals. In multivariate analysis, larger optic disc rotation around the vertical axis (range:-4.90° to 41.0°) was associated (regression coefficient r:0.27) with high axial myopia (axial length ≥26.5 mm) (P<0.001;standardized regression coefficient beta beta:0.09), longer disc-fovea distance (P = 0.001;beta:0.09) and wider parapapillary beta/gamma zone (P<0.001;beta0.12). Larger optic disc rotation around the horizontal axis (range:-7.10° to 26.4°) was associated (r:0.32) with high axial myopia (P = 0.001;beta:0.08), larger optic disc-fovea angle (P<0.001;beta:0.13), thinner superior nasal retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness (P<0.001;beta:-0.19) and thicker inferior nasal RNFL thickness (P<0.001;beta:0.17). Conclusions Vertical optic disc rotation was associated with highly myopic axial elongation, increased disc-fovea distance and development or enlargement of parapapillary, Bruch´s membrane free, gamma zone, while macular Bruch´s membrane length is not affected. Horizontal optic disc rotation was associated with inferior dislocation of the fovea, in addition to a thinner superior nasal RNFL and thicker inferior nasal RNFL. The latter association may be taken into account in the interpretation of RNFL thickness profiles."
https://openalex.org/W2613202919,"Delay discounting-often referred to as hyperbolic discounting in the financial literature-is defined by a consistent preference for smaller, immediate rewards over larger, delayed rewards, and by failure of future consequences to curtail current consummatory behaviors. Previous research demonstrates (1) excessive delay discounting among individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), (2) common neural substrates of delay discounting and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms of ADHD, and (3) associations between delay discounting and both debt burden and high interest rate borrowing. This study extends prior research by examining associations between ADHD symptoms, delay discounting, and an array of previously unevaluated financial outcomes among 544 individuals (mean age 35 years). Controlling for age, income, sex, education, and substance use, ADHD symptoms were associated with delay discounting, late credit card payments, credit card balances, use of pawn services, personal debt, and employment histories (less time spent at more jobs). Consistent with neural models of reward processing and associative learning, more of these relations were attributable to hyperactive-impulsive symptoms than inattentive symptoms. Implications for financial decision-making and directions for future research are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2612299077,"Applying innovative methodology, we explored the efficacy of SPARK Resilience Programme--a new universal school-based resilience-promoting programme--regarding effects on depression symptoms and resilience in a high risk population in England. Quantitative and qualitative methods were combined in an exploratory two cohort treatment/control design with one cohort serving as the control group (single assessment) and a subsequent cohort as the treatment group (assessed before and immediately after treatment as well as 6 and 12 months after treatment ended), involving a total of 438 11-13 year old girls, According to analyses, depression symptoms were significantly lower directly after treatment and at 6 months but no longer at 12 months. Resilience scores, on the other hand, were significantly higher in the treatment cohort compared to the year-ahead control cohort at post-treatment and both follow-up assessments. Qualitative results demonstrated beneficial teacher experience overall. The current study provides first evidence for the efficacy of SPARK Resilience Programme. Furthermore, the applied two cohort treatment/control mixed methods design proved helpful for the preliminary testing of a school-based universal intervention programme efficacy in an authentic setting."
https://openalex.org/W2612992155,"Phaeobacter inhibens DSM 17395, a model organism for marine Roseobacter group, was studied for its response to its own antimicrobial compound tropodithietic acid (TDA). TDA biosynthesis is encoded on the largest extrachromosomal element of P. inhibens, the 262 kb plasmid, whose curation leads to an increased growth and biomass yield. In this study, the plasmid-cured strain was compared to the wild-type strain and to transposon mutants lacking single genes of the TDA biosynthesis. The data show that the growth inhibition of the wild-type strain can be mainly attributed to the TDA produced by P. inhibens itself. Oxygen uptake rates remained constant in all strains but the growth rate dropped in the wild-type which supports the recently proposed mode of TDA action. Metabolome analysis showed no metabolic alterations that could be attributed directly to TDA. Taken together, the growth of P. inhibens is limited by its own antibacterial compound due to a partial destruction of the proton gradient which leads to a higher energetic demand. The universal presence of TDA biosynthesis in genome-sequenced isolates of the genus Phaeobacter shows that there must be a high benefit of TDA for P. inhibens in its ecological niche despite the drawback on its metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2613874326,"Mouthpart structure and feeding behavior in the temperate firebug, Pyrrhocoris sibiricus Kuschakevich, an important pest that feeds on seeds of leguminous and gramineous plants, are described for the first time. Mouthparts were observed using scanning electron microscopy to examine the external morphology, distribution and abundance of sensilla on mouthparts. Feeding performance by adults on both seeds and shoots were observed using a binocular microscope. The four-segmented labium contains 3 types of sensilla trichodea, 3 types of sensilla basiconica, 1 type of sensilla placodea and 1 type of sensilla campaniformia. Among them, sensilla trichodea are most abundant. The tripartite apex of the labium consists of two lateral lobes and an apical plate. Each lateral lobe possesses a field of 12 thick-walled uniporous peg sensilla and long non-porous hair sensilla. The mandibular stylet tips have three central teeth and two pairs of lateral teeth, which may help in penetrating hard seed coats. A series of scale-like projections are present on the inner surface of the mandibular stylets. The externally smooth maxillary stylets interlock to form a larger food canal and a smaller salivary canal, and there are five tubercles near the tip of the right stylet. Cross-sections of the stylet fascicle show that each mandibular stylet has a dendritic canal. The adult feeding process involves several steps, including exploring and puncturing of the host epidermis, a probing phase, an engorgement phase, and removal of the mouthparts from the host tissue. The structure and function of the mouthparts are adapted for the seed feeding habits."
https://openalex.org/W2613913182,"The locus CDKN2A/B (9p21.3), which comprises the tumor suppressors genes CDKN2A and CDKN2B and the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) known as ANRIL (or CDKN2B-AS), was associated with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) susceptibility in several genome wide association studies (GWAS). However, the variants associated in the diverse studies were different. Recently, new and independent SNPs deregulating the locus function were also identified in association with ALL risk. This diversity in the results may be explained because different variants in each population could alter CDKN2A/B locus function through diverse mechanisms. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether the annotated risk variants in the CDKN2A/B locus affect the susceptibility of B cell precursor ALL (B-ALL) in our Spanish population and explore if other SNPs altering additional regulatory mechanisms could be also involved. We analyzed the four SNPs proposed by GWAs and two additional SNPs in miRNA binding sites in 217 pediatric patients with B-ALL and 330 healthy controls. The SNPs rs2811712, rs3731249, rs3217992 and rs2811709 were associated with B-ALL susceptibility in our Spanish population. ALL subtypes analyses showed that rs2811712 was associated with B-hyperdiploid ALL. These results provide evidence for the influence of genetic variants at CDKN2A/B locus with the risk of developing B-ALL."
https://openalex.org/W2611992772,"Plants can regenerate from a variety of tissues on culturing in appropriate media. However, the metabolic shifts involved in callus formation and shoot regeneration are largely unknown. The metabolic profiles of callus generated from tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) cotyledons and that of shoot regenerated from callus were compared with the pct1-2 mutant that exhibits enhanced polar auxin transport and the shr mutant that exhibits elevated nitric oxide levels. The transformation from cotyledon to callus involved a major shift in metabolite profiles with denser metabolic networks in the callus. In contrast, the transformation from callus to shoot involved minor changes in the networks. The metabolic networks in pct1-2 and shr mutants were distinct from wild type and were rewired with shifts in endogenous hormones and metabolite interactions. The callus formation was accompanied by a reduction in the levels of metabolites involved in cell wall lignification and cellular immunity. On the contrary, the levels of monoamines were upregulated in the callus and regenerated shoot. The callus formation and shoot regeneration were accompanied by an increase in salicylic acid in wild type and mutants. The transformation to the callus and also to the shoot downregulated LST8 and upregulated TOR transcript levels indicating a putative linkage between metabolic shift and TOR signalling pathway. The network analysis indicates that shift in metabolite profiles during callus formation and shoot regeneration is governed by a complex interaction between metabolites and endogenous hormones."
https://openalex.org/W2612195965,"New research on assessing neuropsychiatric manifestations of Alzheimer´s Disease (AD) involves grouping neuropsychiatric symptoms into syndromes. Yet this approach is limited by high inter-subject variability in neuropsychiatric symptoms and a relatively low degree of concordance across studies attempting to cluster neuropsychiatric symptoms into syndromes. An alternative strategy that involves dichotomizing AD subjects into those with few versus multiple neuropsychiatric symptoms is both consonant with real-world clinical practice and can contribute to understanding neurobiological underpinnings of neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD patients. The aim of this study was to address whether the number of neuropsychiatric symptoms (i.e., presence of few [≤2] versus multiple [≥3] symptoms) in AD would be associated with degree of significant gray matter (GM) volume loss. Of particular interest was volume loss in brain regions involved in memory, emotional processing and salience brain networks, including the prefrontal, lateral temporal and parietal cortices, anterior cingulate gyrus, temporo-limbic structures and insula. We recruited 19 AD patients and 13 healthy controls, which underwent an MRI and neuropsychiatric assessment. Regional brain volumes were determined using voxel-based morphometry and other advanced imaging processing methods. Our results indicated the presence of different patterns of GM atrophy in the two AD subgroups relative to healthy controls. AD patients with multiple neuropsychiatric manifestations showed more evident GM atrophy in the left superior temporal gyrus and insula as compared with healthy controls. In contrast, AD subjects with few neuropsychiatric symptoms displayed more GM atrophy in prefrontal regions, as well as in the dorsal anterior cingulate ad post-central gyri, as compared with healthy controls. Our findings suggest that the presence of multiple neuropsychiatric symptoms is more related to the degree of atrophy in specific brain networks rather than dependent on the global severity of widespread neurodegenerative brain changes."
https://openalex.org/W2612248855,"Aims To evaluate the relationships between open-angle glaucoma (OAG) and various anthropometric measurements. Design Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES), a population-based cross-sectional study using a complex, stratified, multistage, probability-cluster survey. Methods A total of 5,255 participants including 247 glaucoma patients, aged ≥ 19 years were included from the KNHANES V database. Glaucoma diagnosis was based on International Society of Geographical and Epidemiological Ophthalmology criteria. Various anthropometric data regarding obesity were analyzed including body mass index (BMI), total body fat mass, total body muscle mass (lean body mass, non-bone lean body mass, and appendicular skeletal muscle (ASM) mass), and waist circumference (WC). The differences in OAG prevalence with respect to anthropometric parameter quartiles were examined. Results In males, the multivariate general linear model adjusted for age, alcohol, smoking, exercise, systemic hypertension, diabetes, and intraocular pressure (IOP) showed the quartiles for the anthropometric parameters BMI, fat mass/weight ratio and fat mass/muscle mass ratio were negatively associated with OAG. However, muscle mass parameter/BMI ratio was significantly positively associated with OAG (P for trend<0.05). In females, height and fat mass/BMI showed a significant relationship with the risk of OAG. (P value<0.05) Conclusions In the present study, high fat mass was associated with low OAG risk. Body composition seemed to affect the prevalence of OAG, but further evaluation is needed."
https://openalex.org/W2612765457,"Salmonella Typhimurium is the leading cause of human non-typhoidal gastroenteritis in the US. S. Kentucky is one the most commonly recovered serovars from commercially processed poultry carcasses. This study compared the genotypic and phenotypic properties of two Salmonella enterica strains Typhimurium (ST221_31B) and Kentucky (SK222_32B) recovered from commercially processed chicken carcasses using whole genome sequencing, phenotype characterizations and an intracellular killing assay. Illumina MiSeq platform was used for sequencing of two Salmonella genomes. Phylogenetic analysis employing homologous alignment of a 1,185 non-duplicated protein-coding gene in the Salmonella core genome demonstrated fully resolved bifurcating patterns with varying levels of diversity that separated ST221_31B and SK222_32B genomes into distinct monophyletic serovar clades. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis identified 2,432 (ST19) SNPs within 13 Typhimurium genomes including ST221_31B representing Sequence Type ST19 and 650 (ST152) SNPs were detected within 13 Kentucky genomes including SK222_32B representing Sequence Type ST152. In addition to serovar-specific conserved coding sequences, the genomes of ST221_31B and SK222_32B harbor several genomic regions with significant genetic differences. These included phage and phage-like elements, carbon utilization or transport operons, fimbriae operons, putative membrane associated protein-encoding genes, antibiotic resistance genes, siderophore operons, and numerous hypothetical protein-encoding genes. Phenotype microarray results demonstrated that ST221_31B is capable of utilizing certain carbon compounds more efficiently as compared to SK222_3B; namely, 1,2-propanediol, M-inositol, L-threonine, α-D-lactose, D-tagatose, adonitol, formic acid, acetoacetic acid, and L-tartaric acid. ST221_31B survived for 48 h in macrophages, while SK222_32B was mostly eliminated. Further, a 3-fold growth of ST221_31B was observed at 24 hours post-infection in chicken granulosa cells while SK222_32B was unable to replicate in these cells. These results suggest that Salmonella Typhimurium can survive host defenses better and could be more invasive than Salmonella Kentucky and provide some insights into the genomic determinants responsible for these differences."
https://openalex.org/W2612920724,"Perceptual body size distortions have traditionally been studied using subjective, qualitative measures that assess only one type of body representation–the conscious body image. Previous research on perceived body size has typically focused on measuring distortions of the entire body and has tended to overlook the face. Here, we present a novel psychophysical method for determining perceived body size that taps into implicit body representation. Using a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC), participants were sequentially shown two life-size images of their own face, viewed upright, upside down, or tilted 90°. In one interval, the width or length dimension was varied, while the other interval contained an undistorted image. Participants reported which image most closely matched their own face. An adaptive staircase adjusted the distorted image to hone in on the image that was equally likely to be judged as matching their perceived face as the accurate image. When viewed upright or upside down, face width was overestimated and length underestimated, whereas perception was accurate for the on-side views. These results provide the first psychophysically robust measurements of how accurately healthy participants perceive the size of their face, revealing distortions of the implicit body representation independent of the conscious body image."
https://openalex.org/W2613611455,"Nitrification inhibitors (NIs) have been used extensively to reduce nitrogen losses and increase crop nitrogen nutrition. However, information is still scant regarding the influence of NIs on nitrogen transformation, nitrous oxide (N2O) emission and nitrogen utilization in plastic-film-mulched calcareous soil under high frequency drip-fertigated condition. Therefore, a field trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of nitrapyrin (2-chloro-6-(trichloromethyl)-pyridine) on soil mineral nitrogen (N) transformation, N2O emission and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in a drip-fertigated cotton-growing calcareous field. Three treatments were established: control (no N fertilizer), urea (225 kg N ha-1) and urea+nitrapyrin (225 kg N ha-1+2.25 kg nitrapyrin ha-1). Compared with urea alone, urea plus nitrapyrin decreased the average N2O emission fluxes by 6.6–21.8% in June, July and August significantly in a drip-fertigation cycle. Urea application increased the seasonal cumulative N2O emission by 2.4 kg N ha-1 compared with control, and nitrapyrin addition significantly mitigated the seasonal N2O emission by 14.3% compared with urea only. During the main growing season, the average soil ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) concentration was 28.0% greater and soil nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) concentration was 13.8% less in the urea+nitrapyrin treatment than in the urea treatment. Soil NO3--N and water-filled pore space (WFPS) were more closely correlated than soil NH4+-N with soil N2O fluxes under drip-fertigated condition (P<0.001). Compared with urea alone, urea plus nitrapyrin reduced the seasonal N2O emission factor (EF) by 32.4% while increasing nitrogen use efficiency by 10.7%. The results demonstrated that nitrapyrin addition significantly inhibited soil nitrification and maintained more NH4+-N in soil, mitigated N2O losses and improved nitrogen use efficiency in plastic-film-mulched calcareous soil under high frequency drip-fertigated condition."
https://openalex.org/W2612089705,"Dynamins and dynamin-like proteins (DLPs) belong to a family of large GTPases involved in membrane remodelling events. These include both fusion and fission processes with different dynamin proteins often having a specialised function within the same organism. Trypanosoma brucei is thought to have only one multifunctional DLP (TbDLP). While this was initially reported to function in mitochondrial division only, an additional role in endocytosis and cytokinesis was later also proposed. Since there are two copies of TbDLP present in the trypanosome genome, we investigated potential functional differences between these two paralogs by re-expressing either protein in a TbDLP RNAi background. These paralogs, called TbDLP1 and TbDLP2, are almost identical bar a few amino acid substitutions. Our results, based on cell lines carrying tagged and RNAi-resistant versions of each protein, show that overexpression of TbDLP1 alone is able to rescue the observed endocytosis and growth defects in the mammalian bloodstream form (BSF) of the parasite. While TbDLP2 shows no rescue in our experiments in BSF, this might also be due to lower expression levels of the protein in this life stage. In contrast, both TbDLP proteins apparently play more complementary roles in the insect procyclic form (PCF) since neither TbDLP1 nor TbDLP2 alone can fully restore wildtype growth and morphology in TbDLP-depleted parasites."
https://openalex.org/W2612488680,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a species-specific pathogenic virus that infects only humans and chimpanzees. Previous studies have indicated that interactions between the HCV E2 protein and CD81 on host cells are required for HCV infection. To determine the crucial factors for species-specific interactions at the molecular level, this study employed in silico molecular docking involving molecular dynamic simulations of the binding of HCV E2 onto human and rat CD81s. In vitro experiments including surface plasmon resonance measurements and cellular binding assays were applied for simple validations of the in silico results. The in silico studies identified two binding regions on the HCV E2 loop domain, namely E2-site1 and E2-site2, as being crucial for the interactions with CD81s, with the E2-site2 as the determinant factor for human-specific binding. Free energy calculations indicated that the E2/CD81 binding process might follow a two-step model involving (i) the electrostatic interaction-driven initial binding of human-specific E2-site2, followed by (ii) changes in the E2 orientation to facilitate the hydrophobic and van der Waals interaction-driven binding of E2-site1. The sequence of the human-specific, stronger-binding E2-site2 could serve as a candidate template for the future development of HCV-inhibiting peptide drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2612770222,"Molybdenum disulfide nanosheets/reduced graphene oxide (MoS2 NSs/rGO) nanohybrid as a highly effective catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) have been successfully synthesized by a facile microwave-assisted method. The results clearly reveal that direct grown of MoS2 NSs on rGO have been achieved. Electrochemical tests show that the as-prepared hybrid material exhibited excellent HER activity, with a small Tafel slope of 57 mV dec-1, an overpotential of 130 mV and remarkable cycling stability. After analysis, the observed outstanding catalytic performance can be attributed to the uniform distribution of the MoS2 NSs, which are characterized by the presence of multiple active sites as well as the effective electron transport route provided by the conductive rGO substrate. Moreover, according to the classic theory, the mechanism governing of the catalytic HER on the MoS2 NSs/rGO nanohybrid has been clarified."
https://openalex.org/W2613605096,"Obesity is believed to be one of the major risk factors for cardiovascular disease in Western countries. However, the effects of obesity should be continuously examined in the Japanese population because the average bodily habitus differs among countries. In this study, we collectively examined the significance of obesity and obesity-triggered risk factors including the low reactivity of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), for ischemic heart disease (IHD) in Japanese patients.The study patients consisted of 1252 subjects (IHD: n = 970; non-IHD: n = 282). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, and the low reactivity of BNP were significant risk factors for IHD, but body mass index (BMI) was not. A theoretical path model was proposed by positioning BMI at the top of the hierarchical model. Exploratory factor analysis revealed that BMI did not play a causative role in IHD (P = NS). BMI was causatively linked to other risk factors (P<0.001 for hypertension; P<0.001 for dyslipidemia; P<0.001 for HbA1c; P<0.001 for LogBNP), and these factors played a causative role in IHD (P<0.001 for hypertension; P<0.001 for dyslipidemia; P<0.001 for HbA1c; P<0.001 for LogBNP). The intrinsic power of the low reactivity of BNP induced by high BMI on the promotion of IHD was fairly potent.This study demonstrated that obesity per se is not a strong risk factor for IHD in Japanese patients. However, several important risk factors triggered by obesity exhibited a causative role for IHD. The low reactivity of BNP is a substantial risk factor for IHD."

The information obtained forms the basis for applying fuzzy matching and machine learning classification algorithms to more than 46 million workers in 5 categories: Iberian, Italian, Japanese, German and East European. The vast majority (96.7%) of the single surnames were identified using a fuzzy matching and the rest using a method proposed by Cavnar and Trenkle (1994). A comparison of the results of the procedures with data on foreigners in the 1920 Census and with the geographic distribution of non-Iberian surnames underscores the accuracy of the procedure. The study shows that surname ancestry is associated with significant differences in wages and schooling."
https://openalex.org/W2612646231,"This study investigated the influence of sodium restriction and antihypertensive drugs on atherogenesis utilizing hypertensive (H) low-density lipoprotein-receptor knockout mice treated or not with losartan (Los) or hydralazine (Hyd) and fed low-sodium (LS) or normal-sodium (NS) chow. Despite reducing the blood pressure (BP) of H-LS mice, the LS diet caused arterial lipid infiltration due to increased plasma total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG). Los and Hyd reduced the BP of H-LS mice, and Los effectively prevented arterial injury, likely by reducing plasma TG and nonesterified fatty acids. Aortic lipid infiltration was lower in Los-treated H-LS mice (H-LS+Los) than in normotensive (N)-LS and H-LS mice. Aortic angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor content was greater in H-NS than H-LS mice and in H-LS+Hyd than H-LS+Los mice. Carboxymethyl-lysine (CML) and receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) immunostaining was greater in H-LS than H-NS mice. CML and RAGE levels were lower in LS animals treated with antihypertensive drugs, and Hyd enhanced the AT1 receptor level. Hyd also increased the gene expression of F4/80 but not tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-10, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 or cluster of differentiation 66. The novelty of the current study is that in a murine model of simultaneous hypertension and hyperlipidemia, the pleiotropic effect of chronic, severe sodium restriction elicited aortic damage even with reduced BP. These negative effects on the arterial wall were reduced by AT1 receptor antagonism, demonstrating the influence of angiotensin II in atherogenesis induced by a severely LS diet."

The present study aims at investigating the role of ataxic variant of ALD (AVALD) in patients with adult-onset cerebellar ataxia, as well as characterizing their clinical features that distinguish AVALD from other cerebellar ataxias. Mutations in the ATP binding cassette subfamily D member 1 gene (ABCD1) were ascertained in 516 unrelated patients with ataxia. The patients were categorized into three groups: molecularly unassigned hereditary ataxia (n = 118), sporadic ataxia with autonomic dysfunctions (n = 296), and sporadic ataxia without autonomic dysfunctions (n = 102). Brain MRIs were scrutinized for white matter hyperintensity (WMH) in the parieto-occipital lobes, frontal lobes, corticospinal tracts, pons, middle cerebellar peduncles and cerebellar hemispheres. Two ABCD1 mutations (p.S108L and p.P623fs) previously linked to cerebral ALD and adrenomyeloneuropathy but not AVALD were identified. ALD accounts for 0.85% (1/118) of the patients with molecularly unassigned hereditary ataxia and 0.34% (1/296) of the patients with sporadic ataxia with autonomic dysfunctions. WMH in the corticospinal tracts and WMH in the cerebellar hemispheres were strongly associated with AVALD rather than other ataxias. To conclude, ALD accounts for approximately 0.39% (2/516) of adult-onset cerebellar ataxias. This study expands the mutational spectrum of AVALD and underscores the importance of considering ALD as a potential etiology of cerebellar ataxia."
https://openalex.org/W2612967332,"The process of domestication in animals has led to alterations in behavior, physiology and phenotypic traits, changes that may be driven by correlations with reduced fear of humans. We used Red Junglefowl, ancestors of all domesticated chickens selected for either high or low fear of humans for five generations to study the effects of selection on gene transcription in the cerebral hemisphere, which is heavily involved in behaviour control. A total of 24 individuals from the parental generation as well as from the fifth selected generation were used. Twenty-two genes were significantly differentially expressed at p < 0.05 after false discovery rate (FDR) correction. Those genes that were upregulated in the low fearful animals were found to be involved in neural functions. Gene ontology and pathway analysis revealed enrichment for terms associated with behavioural processes. We conclude that five generations of divergent selection for high or low tameness has significantly changed gene expression patterns in the cerebral hemisphere in the Red Junglefowl population used here, which could underlie a range of changes in the domestic phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2613826037,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common joint disease characterised by the focal loss of the protective cartilage layer at the ends of the bones. It is painful, disabling, multifactorial and polygenic. The growth differentiation factor 5 gene GDF5 was one of the first reported OA susceptibility signals that showed consistent association to OA, with the transcript single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs143383 demonstrating association in Asians and Europeans. The functional effect of the signal is reduced expression of the gene. The GDF5 protein is an extracellular matrix signalling molecule that is active during chondrogenesis and in mature chondrocytes. Due to the functional impact of the susceptibility, we previously assessed the effect of supplementing chondrocytes from OA patients with exogenous GDF5. Their response was highly discordant, precluding the application of GDF5 as a simple means of attenuating the genetic deficit. Since GDF5 is also active during development, we have now assessed the effect of exogenous GDF5 on bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that are undergoing chondrogenesis during cartilage disc formation. MSCs from healthy donors and OA patients were studied and the effect of GDF5 was assessed by measuring the wet mass of the discs, by histological staining, and by monitoring the change in expression of anabolic, catabolic and hypertrophic protein-coding genes. The MSCs expressed the three principal GDF5 receptor genes and responded in a significantly anabolic manner (increase in wet mass, p = 0.0022; Bonferroni corrected p = 0.018) to a variant form of GDF5 that targets the most abundantly expressed receptor, BMPR-IA. GDF5 elicited significant (p < 0.05) changes in the expression of anabolic, catabolic and hypertrophic genes with several consistent effects in healthy donors and in OA patients. Our data implies that, unlike OA chondrocytes, OA MSCs do respond in a predictable, anabolic manner to GDF5, which could therefore provide a route to modulate the genetic deficit mediated by the rs143383 association signal."

Many RNA viruses also encode helicases, which are sometimes covalently linked to proteases that cleave signaling proteins. One unresolved question is how RLRs interact with each other and with viral proteins in cells. This study examined the interactions among the hepatitis C virus (HCV) helicase and RLR helicases in live cells with quantitative microspectroscopic imaging (Q-MSI), a technique that determines FRET efficiency and subcellular donor and acceptor concentrations. HEK293T cells were transfected with various vector combinations to express cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) or YFP fused to either biologically active HCV helicase or one RLR (i.e. RIG-I, MDA5, or LGP2), expressed in the presence or absence of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), which elicits RLR accumulation at mitochondria. Q-MSI confirmed previously reported RLR interactions and revealed an interaction between HCV helicase and LGP2. Mitochondria in CFP-RIG-I:YFP-RIG-I cells, CFP-MDA5:YFP-MDA5 cells, and CFP-MDA5:YFP-LGP2 cells had higher FRET efficiencies in the presence of poly(I:C), indicating that RNA causes these proteins to accumulate at mitochondria in higher-order complexes than those formed in the absence of poly(I:C). However, mitochondria in CFP-LGP2:YFP-LGP2 cells had lower FRET signal in the presence of poly(I:C), suggesting that LGP2 oligomers disperse so that LGP2 can bind MDA5.

Such helicases function at the replication fork, forming oligomeric rings that surround one DNA strand while separating its complement, but they comprise only a small subset of all motor proteins that manipulate cellular nucleic acid structures. Ring helicases typically function as hexamers, in which each subunit contains a motor domain (2Li N. Zhai Y. Zhang Y. Li W. Yang M. Lei J. Tye B.K. Gao N.

The NS3 helicase is part of a multifunctional protein that has an N-terminal protease domain that cleaves MAVS to block the interferon response (28Foy E. Li K. Sumpter Jr., R. Loo Y.M. Johnson C.L.

Virol. 2006; 80: 6072-6083Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). RIG-I and MDA5 also interact with MAVS via their N-terminal caspase recruitment domains (CARDs). However, a direct interaction between NS3 and an RLR has not yet been demonstrated; nor has there been convincing evidence that RLR oligomerization occurs in living cells (30Louber J. Kowalinski E. Bloyet L.M. Brunel J. Cusack S. Gerlier D. RIG-I self-oligomerization is either dispensable or very transient for signal transduction.PLoS One. 2014; 9: e108770Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This project was initially designed to test the notion that homologous protein/protein interaction motifs shared between NS3 and RLRs enable the NS3 helicase domain to position the NS3 protease where it can cleave key cellular targets needed for the interferon response. For example, NS3 might locate MAVS by forming hetero-oligomers with RIG-I, MDA5, and/or LGP2. To test this hypothesis, we designed pairs of fluorescent fusion proteins (31Cubitt A.B. Heim R.

U.S.A. 1994; 91: 12501-12504Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar) was used as the donor, and YFP (34Miyawaki A. Griesbeck O. Heim R. Tsien R.Y. Dynamic and quantitative Ca2+ measurements using improved cameleons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 2135-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar) was used as the acceptor in FRET. Each protein was designed to best retain its biological activity and subcellular localization. Data revealed a new and possibly biologically relevant interaction between HCV NS3 helicase domain and LGP2. In addition, FRET data confirmed that in vivo RLR interactions occur at the mitochondria and that these interactions change in the presence of a PAMP. Seven plasmids were constructed to encode CFP-NS3, CFP-RIG-I, CFP-MDA5, CFP-LGP2, YFP-RIG-I, YFP-MDA5, and YFP-LGP2. Each fusion protein was designed to be expressed under the control of a CMV promoter upon transfection of 293T cells. All proteins were tagged at the N terminus. Both NS3 and each of the RLRs are multifunctional proteins with complex domain structures. NS3 harbors a protease domain at its N terminus linked to its C-terminal helicase domain. The NS3 protease also requires cofactor NS4A for activity and proper cellular localization. The same HCV open reading frame encodes both NS3 and NS4A, with NS4A immediately downstream of NS3. Upon translation, NS4A binds NS3 to activate the protease, which cleaves the NS3/NS4A junction. NS4A then tethers NS3 to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes as part of the viral replicase. The CFP-NS3 plasmid was therefore designed to encode full-length NS3 and NS4A proteins, with CFP fused to the NS3 N terminus. In transfected cells, such a protein formed clear foci in the cellular cytoplasm (Fig. 1A), suggesting that NS3 bound NS4A and that the membrane tether of NS4A was intact. To probe CFP-NS3 activity, the cells were co-transfected with a second plasmid that encodes the MAVS NS3 cleavage site linked to an RFP with a nuclear localization signal (NLS). In the absence of NS3, this RFP-NLS-MAVS is expressed in the cytoplasm. However, upon cleavage by NS3, MAVS migrates to the cell's nucleus (35Jones C.T. Catanese M.T. Law L.M. Khetani S.R. Syder A.J. Ploss A. Oh T.S. Schoggins J.W. MacDonald M.R. Bhatia S.N. Rice C.M. Real-time imaging of hepatitis C virus infection using a fluorescent cell-based reporter system.Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In this assay, the CFP-NS3·NS4A complex retained the ability to cleave MAVS in cells (Fig. 1A). In a control assay, RFP-NLS-MAVS harboring a mutation (C508Y) in the NS3 cleavage site was expressed, and the CFP-NS3 complex did not cause the RFP to accumulate in the nucleus (Fig. 1B). RIG-I and MDA5 each contain two CARD domains at their N terminus, followed by the helicase domain and a Zn2+-containing regulatory C-terminal domain. LGP2 is similar, but it lacks the CARD domains. We therefore tagged each RLR protein at their N termini. Others have shown that similar N-terminal tags on RLRs do not affect functional interactions with their RNA ligands or downstream signaling ability (36Sanchez David R.Y. Combredet C. Sismeiro O.

Each fluorescent RLR fusion protein used here expressed a cytoplasmic protein (Fig. 1, C–E). When each RLR-expressing cell line was co-transfected with a second plasmid encoding firefly luciferase under the control of a promoter regulated by an interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE), the RLRs stimulated the promoter's activity (Fig. 1F), suggesting that each fluorescent fusion protein retained its signaling activity. As seen in Fig. 1F, LGP2 shows less ISRE signaling activity, which is expected due to its lack of CARDs, the presence of any ISRE stimulation in the presence of overexpressed LGP2 is attributable to an interaction between LGP2 and endogenous RLRs that contain CARDs. The dual-excitation microspectral imaging technique (Q-MSI) (13Stoneman M.R. Paprocki J.D. Biener G. Yokoi K. Shevade A. Kuchin S. Raicu V. Quaternary structure of the yeast pheromone receptor Ste2 in living cells.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2016; 10.1016/j.bbamem.2016.12.008Google Scholar), a fully quantitative FRET method recently developed to analyze interactions within ensembles of proteins in living cells (12King C.

Acta. 2016; 10.1016/j.bbamem.2016.12.008Google Scholar), was used here to determine the relative FRET efficiency (Eapp) as well as the donor- and acceptor-labeled protein concentrations in selected regions of interest (ROIs). Q-MSI analyzes cells co-transfected with plasmids expressing both the donor (CFP) and acceptor (YFP) proteins excited at two wavelengths where pixel-level emission spectra are acquired for each of the two excitations (Fig. 2, C and D). The resulting “mixed” spectra are deconvoluted (i.e. unmixed) (42Raicu V. Jansma D.B. Miller R.J. Friesen J.D. Protein interaction quantified in vivo by spectrally resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer.Biochem. J. 2005; 385: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) using information obtained from similar scans of cells expressing either donor alone (Fig. 2A) or acceptor alone (Fig. 2B). Here, two-photon excitation was used to perform the “FRET scan,” with an excitation wavelength of λex,1 = 840 nm (Fig. 2C) and the “acceptor scan” with an excitation wavelength of λex,2 = 960 nm (Fig. 2D). Two excitation scans are needed to (i) account for direct excitation of YFP at λex,1 and (ii) calculate the concentration of the donor and acceptor. For each excitation scan, 200 2D fluorescence intensity images were collected, each representing the pixel-level intensities seen at wavelengths between ∼400 and ∼600 nm, with ∼1 nm resolution. For a given field of view, the acquisition of the two excitation scans is completed in ∼60 s: 10 s to acquire each set of spectral images and 40 s between the two scans to change the excitation wavelength of the laser. As discussed below, this method provides the apparent FRET efficiency, Eapp, as well as CFP and YFP concentration. However, the elapsed time between the two excitations (40 s) allows for molecular diffusion and is therefore too long to generate pixel-level information. Therefore, Eapp and concentrations were only computed as an average over an ROI (whole cell or subcellular ROI). This trade-off is necessary when the acceptor concentration also needs to be determined in FRET imaging. The first step in Q-MSI involves calculating the individual contributions of donor and acceptor signals to an experimentally obtained composite spectrum. Assuming that the composite (mixed) spectrum is a linear combination of the contributions of the donor and acceptor spectra, factors are determined that scale the fluorescence of the acceptor in the presence of the donor (kAD) and the fluorescence of the donor in the presence of the accepter (kDA) (see Equation 1) to fit the measured composite spectra (42Raicu V. Jansma D.B. Miller R.J. Friesen J.D. Protein interaction quantified in vivo by spectrally resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer.Biochem. J. 2005; 385: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These factors were determined at two excitation wavelengths for each field of view. The first wavelength (λex,1 = 840 nm) excites CFP, and the second (λex,2 = 960 nm) excites YFP, in both cases through a nonlinear process known as two-photon excitation (43Denk W. Strickler J.H. Webb W.W. Two-photon laser scanning fluorescence microscopy.Science. 1990; 248: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (8315) Google Scholar). These two factors, derived from spectral unmixing, were then used, along with the spectral integrals and standard curves generated from images of purified CFP and YFP (13Stoneman M.R. Paprocki J.D. Biener G. Yokoi K. Shevade A. Kuchin S. Raicu V. Quaternary structure of the yeast pheromone receptor Ste2 in living cells.Biochim. Biophys.

The σ-1 receptors are present in monomeric and oligomeric forms in living cells in the presence and absence of ligands.Biochem. J. 2015; 466: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), to calculate Eapp from Equation 4, donor concentration from Equation 2, and acceptor concentration from Equation 3 (see Fig. 2 and “Experimental procedures”). Q-MSI analysis was first performed using CFP-NS3 as the donor and either YFP-RIG-I, YFP-MDA5, or YFP-LGP2 as the acceptor. Pairs were co-expressed in 293T cells via transient transfection. Most cells analyzed had Eapp values near zero when either YFP-RIG-I or YFP-MDA5 was used as the acceptor. However, with YFP-LGP2 as the acceptor, about half of the cells analyzed showed some FRET, although Eapp values were typically < 20% (Fig. 2, H and I). When a similar set of transfections was performed using CFP-LGP2 as the donor, most cells expressing either YFP-RIG-I or YFP-MDA5 as the acceptor again showed no apparent FRET. However, when YFP-LGP2 was used as the acceptor, most cells showed some FRET. The average Eapp seen in cells expressing LGP2 oligomers was 12%, and some cells had Eapp values as high as 30% (Fig. 2, J and K). To explore the NS3/LGP2 interaction in more detail, three different mutant constructs expressing various deletions in the CFP-NS3·NS4A sequence were generated and used to co-transfect 293T cells with the YFP-LGP2 plasmid. In the first mutant (scNS3-4A), the membrane localization regions of NS4A were removed, and the region of NS4A that activates NS3 was covalently attached between the NS3 N terminus and CFP. Such a protein retains cellular protease activity but fails to form foci like the full-length NS3·NS4A complex (Fig. 3, A and B). The second mutant (NS3), which did not contain NS4A, lacked the ability to cleave MAVS in cells and was distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 3C). The third mutant (NS3h) lacked the entire protease domain and was also broadly distributed throughout the cells (Fig. 3D). Despite these different properties, each protein retained an ability to interact with LGP2, suggesting that the interaction occurs via the NS3 helicase domain. Most cells displayed Eapp values around 5%, but some had Eapp values as high as 30%; the single-chain NS3·NS4A protein had the highest average Eapp (Fig. 3, E and F). When whole cells were selected as ROIs in the above experiments, it is possible that Eapp values were biased toward lower values because ROIs containe"
https://openalex.org/W2614069615,"Reinforcement learning tasks are often used to assess participants' tendency to learn more from the positive or more from the negative consequences of one's action. However, this assessment often requires comparison in learning performance across different task conditions, which may differ in the relative salience or discriminability of the stimuli associated with more and less rewarding outcomes, respectively. To address this issue, in a first set of studies, participants were subjected to two versions of a common probabilistic learning task. The two versions differed with respect to the stimulus (Hiragana) characters associated with reward probability. The assignment of character to reward probability was fixed within version but reversed between versions. We found that performance was highly influenced by task version, which could be explained by the relative perceptual discriminability of characters assigned to high or low reward probabilities, as assessed by a separate discrimination experiment. Participants were more reliable in selecting rewarding characters that were more discriminable, leading to differences in learning curves and their sensitivity to reward probability. This difference in experienced reinforcement history was accompanied by performance biases in a test phase assessing ability to learn from positive vs. negative outcomes. In a subsequent large-scale web-based experiment, this impact of task version on learning and test measures was replicated and extended. Collectively, these findings imply a key role for perceptual factors in guiding reward learning and underscore the need to control stimulus discriminability when making inferences about individual differences in reinforcement learning."

Methods A total of 108 BALB/c mice were randomly divided into the following groups: control group (Control), immunosuppressed group (IS), PA pneumonia group (PA), PA pneumonia in immunosuppressed group (IS + PA), PA pneumonia with IVIG treatment in immunocompetent group (PA + IVIG) and PA pneumonia with IVIG treatment in immunosuppressed group (IS + PA + IVIG). Each group comprised 18 mice. The combined PA pneumonia in immunosuppressed model and the treatment models were established. The mice in each group were sacrificed at 4, 8, and 24 h time points. The general condition and pathological changes in the lung tissues of the mice were monitored. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) mRNA relative expression level in the lung tissues. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect the serum concentration of active transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β). Results No inflammatory response were exhibited in the lung tissues of the mice in Control group and IS group, while varying degrees of acute lung injury were revealed in the mice in PA group, IS + PA group, PA + IVIG group and IS + PA + IVIG group. Lung tissue injury was most apparent at the 8 h time point, and it indicated the greatest effect in IS + PA group. Whereas tissue damages were alleviated in PA + IVIG group and IS + PA + IVIG group compared with IS + PA group. In addition, tissue damage lessened in PA + IVIG group compared with PA group and IS + PA + IVIG group. FOXP3 mRNA expression levels in the lung tissues and the serum concentration of TGF-β were lower in IS group, PA group, IS + PA group and IS + PA + IVIG group at the 4, 8 and 24 h time points, respectively compared with Control group. FOXP3 mRNA expression levels decreased in PA + IVIG group at the 4h time point and TGF-β serum concentrations decreased at the 4 and 8h time points compared with Control group, and subsequently increased. Conclusions In the immunosuppred model with PA pneumonia, the immune system was greatly compromised. IVIG partially restored the immunosuppressed functions of Treg cells, suppressed the overactivated immune system and ameliorated the development of the disease."

https://openalex.org/W2612458285,"Shp2 played an important role in cigarette-smoke-mediated inflammation, surfactant homeostasis and asthmatic airway remodeling. However, whether shp2 plays a key role in epithelium-associated allergic reaction is still unknown. In this study, LPS and OVA were observed to induce the production of IL-25 in bronchial epithelial cells in vitro via the activation of MAPK p38 and JNK. Furthermore, blockage of Shp2 by its specific inhibitor PHPS1 or by siRNA-mediated depletion was found to reduce the production of IL-25 in epithelial cells as well as the up-regulated LPS-triggered activation of JNK but not p38. To confirm the role of intra-bronchial epithelial Shp2 in OVA-induced allergic reaction, we generated CC10-rtTA/(tetO)7-Cre/Shp2f/f mice, where Shp2 was conditionally knocked out in bronchial epithelial cells. Surprisingly, specific deletion of Shp2 in bronchial epithelial cells showed a mild but insignificant effect on the expressions of epithelium-derived cytokines as well as TH2 and TH17 polarization following allergen-induced murine airway inflammation. Collectively, our data suggested that deletion of Shp2 impaired IL-25 production in bronchial epithelial cells in vitro, but might yet have minor influence on OVA-induced allergic reaction in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2612608796,"Egg drop syndrome virus (EDSV) can markedly decrease egg production in laying hens. Duck is the natural host of EDSV. EDSV derived from ducks abrogate egg drop in laying hens. We have previously confirmed that duck-derived EDSVs have a variety of replication activities in chick embryo liver (CEL) cells. However, it is currently unclear whether duck-derived EDSV could display tropism and adaptation in laying hens. This study assessed whether duck-derived EDSV can adapt to laying hens, and estimated the inducing factors. Complete genome sequences of duck-derived EDSVs (D11-JW-012, D11-JW-017, and D11-JW-032 isolates) with various replication efficiency in CEL cells and C10-GY-001 isolate causing disease in laying hens were analyzed to find their differences. Phylogenetic analysis of complete genome sequence revealed that C10-GY-001, D11-JW-032, and strain 127 virus as vaccine were clustered into the same group, with D11-JW-012 and D11-JW-017 clustered in another group. Comparison between D11-JW-012 isolate that poorly replicated and D11-JW-017 isolate that replicated well in CEL cells in same cluster revealed six amino acid differences on IVa2, DNA polymerase, endopeptidase, and DNA-binding protein. These amino acids might be key candidates enhancing cellular tropism in chicken. When the pathogenicities of these isolates in laying hens were compared, D11-JW-032 showed severe signs similar to 127 virus, D11-JW-017 showed intermediate signs, while D11-JW-012 showed almost no sign. Eleven amino acids differed between D11-JW-032 and D11-JW-017, and 17 amino acids were different between D11-JW-032 and D11-JW-012. These results suggest that EDSVs derived from ducks have various pathogenicities in laying hens. Key amino acid candidates might have altered their affinity to tropism of laying hens, causing difference pathogenicities."
https://openalex.org/W2613858008,"Background Thyroid cancer affects over ½ million people in the U.S. and the incidence of thyroid cancer has increased worldwide at a rate higher than any other cancer, while survival has remained largely unchanged. The aim of this research was to develop, calibrate and verify a mathematical disease model to simulate the natural history of papillary thyroid cancer, which will serve as a platform to assess the effectiveness of clinical and cancer control interventions. Methods Herein, we modeled the natural pre-clinical course of both benign and malignant thyroid nodules with biologically relevant health states from normal to detected nodule. Using established calibration techniques, optimal parameter sets for tumor growth characteristics, development rate, and detection rate were used to fit Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) incidence data and other calibration targets. Results Model outputs compared to calibration targets demonstrating sufficient calibration fit and model validation are presented including primary targets of SEER incidence data and size distribution at detection of malignancy. Additionally, we show the predicted underlying benign and malignant prevalence of nodules in the population, the probability of detection based on size of nodule, and estimates of growth over time in both benign and malignant nodules. Conclusions This comprehensive model provides a dynamic platform employable for future comparative effectiveness research. Future model analyses will test and assess various clinical management strategies to improve patient outcomes related to thyroid cancer and optimize resource utilization for patients with thyroid nodules."
https://openalex.org/W2612944836,"An interesting feature of Bcl-xL protein is the presence of an unstructured loop domain between α1 and α2 helices, a domain not essential for its anti-apoptotic function and absent in CED-9 protein. Within this domain, Bcl-xL undergoes dynamic phosphorylation and dephosphorylation at Ser49 and Ser62 during G2 and mitosis in human cells. Studies have revealed that when these residues are mutated, cells harbour mitotic defects, including chromosome mis-attachment, lagging, bridging and mis-segregation with, ultimately, chromosome instability and aneuploidy. We undertook genetic experiments in Caenorhabditis elegans to understand the importance of Bcl-xL (Ser49) and (Ser62) in vivo. Transgenic worms carrying single-site S49A, S62A, S49D, S62D and dual site S49/62A mutants were generated and their effects were analyzed in germlines of young adult worms. Worms expressing Bcl-xL variants showed decreased egg-laying and hatching potency, variations in the length of their mitotic regions but not of their transition zones, appearance of chromosomal abnormalities at their diplotene stages, and increased germline apoptosis, with the exception of the S62D variants. Some of these transgenic strains, particularly the Ser to Ala variants, also showed slight modulations of lifespan compared to their controls. In addition, RNAi experiments silencing expression of the various Bcl-xL variants reversed their effects in vivo. Our in vivo observations confirmed the importance of Ser49 and Ser62 within Bcl-xL loop domain in maintaining chromosome stability."
https://openalex.org/W2612241525,"Metacommunity theory provides an understanding of how ecological processes regulate local community assemblies. However, few field studies have evaluated the underlying mechanisms of a metacommunity on a small scale through revealing the relative roles of spatial and environmental filtering in structuring local community composition. Based on a spatially explicit sampling design in 2012 and 2013, this study aims to evaluate the underlying processes of a soil mite metacommunity on a small spatial scale (50 m) in a temperate deciduous forest located at the Maoershan Ecosystem Research Station, Northeast China. Moran's eigenvector maps (MEMs) were used to model independent spatial variables. The relative importance of spatial (including trend variables, i.e., geographical coordinates, and broad- and fine-scale spatial variables) and environmental factors in driving the soil mite metacommunity was determined by variation partitioning. Mantel and partial Mantel tests and a redundancy analysis (RDA) were also used to identify the relative contributions of spatial and environmental variables. The results of variation partitioning suggested that the relatively large and significant variance was a result of spatial variables (including broad- and fine-scale spatial variables and trend), indicating the importance of dispersal limitation and autocorrelation processes. The significant contribution of environmental variables was detected in 2012 based on a partial Mantel test, and soil moisture and soil organic matter were especially important for the soil mite metacommunity composition in both years. The study suggested that the soil mite metacommunity was primarily regulated by dispersal limitation due to broad-scale and neutral biotic processes at a fine-scale and that environmental filtering might be of subordinate importance. In conclusion, a combination of metacommunity perspectives between neutral and species sorting theories was suggested to be important in the observed structure of the soil mite metacommunity at the studied small scale."
https://openalex.org/W2612925296,"Molecularly targeted therapeutics hold promise of revolutionizing treatments of advanced malignancies. However, a large number of patients do not respond to these treatments. Here, we take a systems biology approach to understand the molecular mechanisms that prevent breast cancer (BC) cells from responding to lapatinib, a dual kinase inhibitor that targets human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). To this end, we analysed temporal gene expression profiles of four BC cell lines, two of which respond and the remaining two do not respond to lapatinib. For this analysis, we developed a Gaussian process based algorithm which can accurately find differentially expressed genes by analysing time course gene expression profiles at a fraction of the computational cost of other state-of-the-art algorithms. Our analysis identified 519 potential genes which are characteristic of lapatinib non-responsiveness in the tested cell lines. Data from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database suggested that the basal expressions 120 of the above genes correlate with the response of BC cells to HER2 and/or EGFR targeted therapies. We selected 27 genes from the larger panel of 519 genes for experimental verification and 16 of these were successfully validated. Further bioinformatics analysis identified vitamin D receptor (VDR) as a potential target of interest for lapatinib non-responsive BC cells. Experimentally, calcitriol, a commonly used reagent for VDR targeted therapy, in combination with lapatinib additively inhibited proliferation in two HER2 positive cell lines, lapatinib insensitive MDA-MB-453 and lapatinib resistant HCC 1954-L cells."

https://openalex.org/W2612553069,"Background Medical devices such as implant delivery systems are commonly used during minimally invasive procedures in the cardiovascular system. These devices often have lubricious polymer coatings to reduce friction between the device and blood vessels but coatings may separate and potentially cause serious injuries to patients. Methods Lubricious coated eSheaths for transcatheter heart valve implantation were assessed for luminal integrity at the proximal, medial and distal part. We assessed the number, depths and area of luminal trails using environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM), white light interferometry (WLI) and optical profilometry using area scale fractal complexity (asfc) as surface parameters. A total of 15 eSheaths were retrieved and analyzed after successful femoral transcatheter Sapien 3 implantation in patients (23 mm valve– 14F eSheath, 26 mm valve– 14F eSheath and 29 mm valve– 16F eSheath, n = 5 for each group). Unused eSheaths (14F and 16F) served as controls (n = 5 for each group). Results ESEM revealed significantly greater number of trails after TAVR passage with the 23 mm, 26 mm and 29 mm valves compared to unused control 14F and 16F eSheaths (13.9 ± 3.1, 14.2 ± 2.3, 15.8 ± 1.7 vs. 0.08 ± 0.1 and 1.0 ± 0.5 [n]; p ≤ 0.0001 for all comparisons). Similarly, WLI showed minor, but significantly greater areas of luminal defects after 23 mm, 26 mm and 29 mm valve implantation vs. 14F and 16F unused controls (7.5 ± 0.9, 10.3 ± 1.1, 10.4 ± 1.4 vs. 4.1 ± 0.4 and 2.2 ± 0.4 [μm2], p = 0.0081). Likewise, the 3D-surface-measurement showed comparable results after implantation of the 23 mm, 26 mm and 29 mm valves vs. 14F and 16F unused control eSheaths (79.5 ± 6.3, 105.9 ± 5.3, 98.8 ± 4.8 vs. 5.1 ± 2.8 and 5.6 ± 0.5 [asfc] p = 0.0001). Conclusion Measurable defects of the luminal layer occur during balloon expandable TAVR using 14F and 16F eSheaths though this is likely clinically insignificant. Further clinical investigations including a prospective assessment of minor peripheral embolization are needed to fully address the impact of this luminal defects."
https://openalex.org/W2612993883,"A previous report indicated that a formic acid chemical extraction method for the preparation of protein extracts for matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) identification, with filtration of extracts through 0.2 μm regenerated cellulose (RC) filters, would not reliably inactivate or exclude Bacillus anthracis Vollum cells or spores when tested under high stringency conditions. B. anthracis was recovered from 13/36 extracts (3/18 from vegetative cell extracts and 10/18 from bacterial spore extracts). In this paper we report the repetition of this study but with the substitution of the 0.2 μm, regenerated cellulose, filters with 0.1 μm polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) filters. Experiments were conducted under the same high stringency post-treatment viability test methods (100% of resulting protein content; 7 days Luria (L)-broth and a further 7 days L-agar plate incubation; or 7 days L-agar plate only incubation). B. anthracis was not recovered from any of 18 replicates generated from high concentrations of vegetative cells (107 to 108 cfu), but a single B. anthracis colony was recovered from one of 18 replicates generated from high concentrations of bacterial spores (108 cfu), using a post-treatment viability culture method of 7 days on L-agar plate only. We discuss our results in the context of other similar studies and also a requirement to develop standardised post-treatment viability test methods."
