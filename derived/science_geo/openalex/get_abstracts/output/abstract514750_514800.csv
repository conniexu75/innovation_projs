https://openalex.org/W1978722318,"IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine often associated with inflammation. Inhibition of this pathway has led to successful treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, but one unforeseen potential complication of anti-IL-6 therapy is bowel perforation. Within the intestine, IL-6 has been shown to prevent epithelial apoptosis during prolonged inflammation. The role of IL-6 in the intestine during an initial inflammatory insult is unknown. Here, we evaluate the role of IL-6 at the onset of an inflammatory injury. Using two murine models of bowel injury – wound by biopsy and bacterial triggered colitis – we demonstrated that IL-6 is induced soon after injury by multiple cell types including intraepithelial lymphocytes. Inhibition of IL-6 resulted in impaired wound healing due to decreased epithelial proliferation. Using intestinal tissue obtained from patients who underwent surgical resection of the colon due to traumatic perforation, we observed cells with detectable IL-6 within the area of perforation and not at distant sites. Our data demonstrate the important role of IL-6 produced in part by intraepithelial lymphocytes at the onset of an inflammatory injury for epithelial proliferation and wound repair."
https://openalex.org/W2058335181,"Many commercially available recombinant proteins are produced in Escherichia coli, and most suppliers guarantee contamination levels of less than 1 endotoxin unit (EU). When we analysed commercially available proteins for their endotoxin content, we found contamination levels in the same range as generally stated in the data sheets, but also some that were higher. To analyse whether these low levels of contamination have an effect on immune cells, we stimulated the monocytic cell line THP-1, primary human monocytes, in vitro differentiated human monocyte-derived dendritic cells, and primary human CD1c+ dendritic cells (DCs) with very low concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; ranging from 0.002-2 ng/ml). We show that CD1c+ DCs especially can be activated by minimal amounts of LPS, equivalent to the levels of endotoxin contamination we detected in some commercially available proteins. Notably, the enhanced endotoxin sensitivity of CD1c+ DCs was closely correlated with high CD14 expression levels observed in CD1c+ DCs that had been maintained in cell culture medium for 24 hours. When working with cells that are particularly sensitive to LPS, even low endotoxin contamination may generate erroneous data. We therefore recommend that recombinant proteins be thoroughly screened for endotoxin contamination using the limulus amebocyte lysate test, fluorescence-based assays, or a luciferase based NF-κB reporter assay involving highly LPS-sensitive cells overexpressing TLR4, MD-2 and CD14."
https://openalex.org/W2035025834,"Accurate and reproducible quantification of the accumulation of proteins into foci in cells is essential for data interpretation and for biological inferences. To improve reproducibility, much emphasis has been placed on the preparation of samples, but less attention has been given to reporting and standardizing the quantification of foci. The current standard to quantitate foci in open-source software is to manually determine a range of parameters based on the outcome of one or a few representative images and then apply the parameter combination to the analysis of a larger dataset. Here, we demonstrate the power and utility of using machine learning to train a new algorithm (FindFoci) to determine optimal parameters. FindFoci closely matches human assignments and allows rapid automated exploration of parameter space. Thus, individuals can train the algorithm to mirror their own assignments and then automate focus counting using the same parameters across a large number of images. Using the training algorithm to match human assignments of foci, we demonstrate that applying an optimal parameter combination from a single image is not broadly applicable to analysis of other images scored by the same experimenter or by other experimenters. Our analysis thus reveals wide variation in human assignment of foci and their quantification. To overcome this, we developed training on multiple images, which reduces the inconsistency of using a single or a few images to set parameters for focus detection. FindFoci is provided as an open-source plugin for ImageJ."
https://openalex.org/W2045304212,"It would be of considerable interest to clinicians if the burden of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) in India were known. Herein, we estimate the burden of CPA following pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), and ABPA (and severe asthma with fungal sensitization [SAFS]) complicating asthma.We used the population estimates for India from the 2011 census data. The burden of asthma was estimated using three different methods (Global Initiative against Asthma [GINA] report statement, World Health Survey [WHS] estimates, Indian study on the epidemiology of asthma and chronic bronchitis [INSEARCH]). Global and India-specific figures were used for calculating the prevalence of ABPA and SAFS. The World Health Organization estimates were used for calculating PTB rates while the frequency of CPA was assessed from a previously published scoping review. Sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the burden in various scenarios.The total Indian population in 2011 was 1.2 billion. The asthma prevalence in adults was estimated at about 27.6 (range, 17-30) million. The burden of ABPA ranged from 0.12-6.09 million with different assumptions (best estimate, 1.38 [range, 0.86-1.52] million). The prevalence of SAFS was approximated at about 0.52-1.21 million (best estimate, 0.96 [range, 0.6-1.06] million). The incident TB cases were about 2.1 million while the annual incidence of CPA varied 27,000-0.17 million cases, with different estimates. If the mortality of CPA is estimated as 15% annually, the 5-year prevalence of CPA was placed at 290,147 cases with 5-year prevalence rate being 24 per 100,000.There is a significant burden of ABPA, SAFS and CPA in India. Prospective community-based studies are required to accurately determine the prevalence of these disorders."

Although a major source of natural rubber is the rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis), lettuce (Lactuca sativa) is also known to synthesize natural rubber. Here, we report that an unusual cis-prenyltransferase-like 2 (CPTL2) that lacks the conserved motifs of conventional cis-prenyltransferase is required for natural rubber biosynthesis in lettuce. CPTL2, identified from the lettuce rubber particle proteome, displays homology to a human NogoB receptor and is predominantly expressed in latex.

https://openalex.org/W2048284368,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been used as a useful interventional brain stimulation technique to improve unilateral upper-limb motor function in healthy humans, as well as in stroke patients. Although tDCS applications are supposed to modify the interhemispheric balance between the motor cortices, the tDCS after-effects on interhemispheric interactions are still poorly understood. To address this issue, we investigated the tDCS after-effects on interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) between the primary motor cortices (M1) in healthy humans. Three types of tDCS electrode montage were tested on separate days; anodal tDCS over the right M1, cathodal tDCS over the left M1, bilateral tDCS with anode over the right M1 and cathode over the left M1. Single-pulse and paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulations were given to the left M1 and right M1 before and after tDCS to assess the bilateral corticospinal excitabilities and mutual direction of IHI. Regardless of the electrode montages, corticospinal excitability was increased on the same side of anodal stimulation and decreased on the same side of cathodal stimulation. However, neither unilateral tDCS changed the corticospinal excitability at the unstimulated side. Unilateral anodal tDCS increased IHI from the facilitated side M1 to the unchanged side M1, but it did not change IHI in the other direction. Unilateral cathodal tDCS suppressed IHI both from the inhibited side M1 to the unchanged side M1 and from the unchanged side M1 to the inhibited side M1. Bilateral tDCS increased IHI from the facilitated side M1 to the inhibited side M1 and attenuated IHI in the opposite direction. Sham-tDCS affected neither corticospinal excitability nor IHI. These findings indicate that tDCS produced polarity-specific after-effects on the interhemispheric interactions between M1 and that those after-effects on interhemispheric interactions were mainly dependent on whether tDCS resulted in the facilitation or inhibition of the M1 sending interhemispheric volleys."

It also makes it much easier to authorize someone else to take appropriate actions to ensure the person's wellness than ever before. Information Technology may soon change the way medicine is practiced, improving the performance, while reducing the price of healthcare. We analyzed the secrecy demands of wearable devices, including Smartphone, smart watch and their computing techniques, that can soon change the way healthcare is provided. However, before this is adopted in practice, all devices must be equipped with sufficient privacy capabilities related to healthcare service. In this paper, we formulated a new improved conceptual framework for wearable healthcare systems. This framework consists of ten principles and nine checklists, capable of providing complete privacy protection package to wearable device owners. We constructed this framework based on the analysis of existing mobile technology, the results of which are combined with the existing security standards. The approach also incorporates the market share percentage level of every app and its respective OS. This framework is evaluated based on the stringent CIA and HIPAA principles for information security. This evaluation is followed by testing the capability to revoke rights of subjects to access objects and ability to determine the set of available permissions for a particular subject for all models Finally, as the last step, we examine the complexity of the required initial setup."
https://openalex.org/W2051033989,"Signal integration between IFNγ and TLRs in immune cells has been associated with the host defense against pathogens and injury, with a predominant role of STAT1. We hypothesize that STAT1-dependent transcriptional changes in vascular cells involved in cross-talk between IFNγ and TLR4, reflect pro-atherogenic responses in human atherosclerosis. Genome-wide investigation identified a set of STAT1-dependent genes that were synergistically affected by interactions between IFNγ and TLR4 in VSMCs. These included the chemokines Cxcl9, Ccl12, Ccl8, Ccrl2, Cxcl10 and Ccl5, adhesion molecules Cd40, Cd74, and antiviral and antibacterial genes Rsad2, Mx1, Oasl1, Gbp5, Nos2, Batf2 and Tnfrsf11a. Among the amplified genes was also Irf8, of which Ccl5 was subsequently identified as a new pro-inflammatory target in VSMCs and ECs. Promoter analysis predicted transcriptional cooperation between STAT1, IRF1, IRF8 and NFκB, with the novel role of IRF8 providing an additional layer to the overall complexity. The synergistic interactions between IFNγ and TLR4 also resulted in increased T-cell migration and impaired aortic contractility in a STAT1-dependent manner. Expression of the chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10 correlated with STAT1 phosphorylation in vascular cells in plaques from human carotid arteries. Moreover, using data mining of human plaque transcriptomes, expression of a selection of these STAT1-dependent pro-atherogenic genes was found to be increased in coronary artery disease (CAD) and carotid atherosclerosis. Our study provides evidence to suggest that in ECs and VSMCs STAT1 orchestrates a platform for cross-talk between IFNγ and TLR4, and identifies a STAT1-dependent gene signature that reflects a pro-atherogenic state in human atherosclerosis."

The PAR polymerase PARP1 binds to damaged chromatin and synthesizes PAR chains to signal DNA damage and recruit the DNA repair scaffold, XRCC1. Pharmacological blockade of PARP1 enzymatic activity impairs XRCC1-dependent repair of DNA damage and selectively kills cancer cells lacking other DNA repair functions. As such, PARP inhibitors are promising new therapies for repair-deficient tumors such as BRCA mutated breast cancers. Although the XRCC1-PARP1 complex is relevant to the proposed therapeutic mechanism of PARP inhibitors, the physical makeup and dynamics of this complex are not well characterized at the molecular level. Here we describe a fluorescence-based, real-time assay that quantitatively monitors interactions between PARylated PARP1 and XRCC1. Using this assay, we show that the PAR posttranslational modification by itself is a high affinity ligand for XRCC1, requiring a minimum chain length of 7 ADP-ribose units in the oligo(ADP-ribose) ligand for a stable interaction with XRCC1. This discrete binding interface enables the PAR glycohydrolase (PARG) to completely disassemble the PARP1-XRCC1 complex without assistance from a mono(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase.

https://openalex.org/W2009646193,"Grain production of rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a top priority in ensuring food security for human beings. One of the approaches to increase yield is to delay leaf senescence and to extend the available time for photosynthesis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators of aging and cellular senescence in eukaryotes. Here, to help understand their biological role in rice leaf senescence, we report identification of miRNAs and their putative target genes by deep sequencing of six small RNA libraries, six RNA-seq libraries and two degradome libraries from the leaves of two super hybrid rice, Nei-2-You 6 (N2Y6, age-resistant rice) and Liang-You-Pei 9 (LYP9, age-sensitive rice). In total 372 known miRNAs, 162 miRNA candidates and 1145 targets were identified. Compared with the expression of miRNAs in the leaves of LYP9, the numbers of miRNAs up-regulated and down-regulated in the leaves of N2Y6 were 47 and 30 at early stage of grain-filling, 21 and 17 at the middle stage, and 11 and 37 at the late stage, respectively. Six miRNA families, osa-miR159, osa-miR160 osa-miR164, osa-miR167, osa-miR172 and osa-miR1848, targeting the genes encoding APETALA2 (AP2), zinc finger proteins, salicylic acid-induced protein 19 (SIP19), auxin response factors (ARF) and NAC transcription factors, respectively, were found to be involved in leaf senescence through phytohormone signaling pathways. These results provided valuable information for understanding the miRNA-mediated leaf senescence of rice, and offered an important foundation for rice breeding."
https://openalex.org/W2036338603,"C3larvin toxin was identified by a bioinformatic strategy as a putative mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase and a possible virulence factor from Paenibacillus larvae, which is the causative agent of American Foulbrood in honey bees. C3larvin targets RhoA as a substrate for its transferase reaction, and kinetics for both the NAD(+) (Km = 34 ± 12 μm) and RhoA (Km = 17 ± 3 μm) substrates were characterized for this enzyme from the mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase C3 toxin subgroup. C3larvin is toxic to yeast when expressed in the cytoplasm, and catalytic variants of the enzyme lost the ability to kill the yeast host, indicating that the toxin exerts its lethality through its enzyme activity. A small molecule inhibitor of C3larvin enzymatic activity was discovered called M3 (Ki = 11 ± 2 μm), and to our knowledge, is the first inhibitor of transferase activity of the C3 toxin family. C3larvin was crystallized, and its crystal structure (apoenzyme) was solved to 2.3 A resolution. C3larvin was also shown to have a different mechanism of cell entry from other C3 toxins."
https://openalex.org/W2036461110,"The ability to reproducibly match tinnitus loudness and pitch is important to research and clinical management. Here we examine agreement and reliability of tinnitus loudness matching and pitch likeness ratings when using a computer-based method to measure the tinnitus spectrum and estimate a dominant tinnitus pitch, using tonal or narrowband sounds. Group level data indicated a significant effect of time between test session 1 and 2 for loudness matching, likely procedural or perceptual learning, which needs to be accounted in study design. Pitch likeness rating across multiple frequencies appeared inherently more variable and with no systematic effect of time. Dominant pitch estimates reached a level of clinical acceptability when sessions were spaced two weeks apart. However when dominant tinnitus pitch assessments were separated by three months, acceptable agreement was achieved only for group mean data, not for individual estimates. This has implications for prescription of some sound-based interventions that rely on accurate measures of individual dominant tinnitus pitch."
https://openalex.org/W2088047336,"Hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) compounds are well-established lung carcinogens. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a tyrosine kinase transmembrane receptor that regulates cell survival, tumor invasion, and angiogenesis. Our results show that chronic exposure of human bronchial epithelial (BEAS-2B) cells to Cr(VI) is able to cause malignant cell transformation. These transformed cells exhibit apoptosis resistance with reduced poly ADP-ribose polymerase cleavage (C-PARP) and Bax expression and enhanced expressions of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. These transformed cells also exhibit reduced capacity of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation along with elevated expression of antioxidant manganese superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2). The expression of this antioxidant was also elevated in lung tumor tissue from a worker exposed to Cr(VI) for 19 years. EGFR was activated in Cr(VI)-transformed BEAS-2B cells, lung tissue from animals exposed to Cr(VI) particles, and human lung tumor tissue. Further study indicates that constitutive activation of EGFR in Cr(VI)-transformed cells was due to increased binding to its ligand amphiregulin (AREG). Inhibition of EGFR or AREG increased Bax expression and reduced Bcl-2 expression, resulting in reduced apoptosis resistance. Furthermore, inhibition of AREG or EGFR restored capacity of ROS generation and decreased SOD2 expression. PI3K/AKT was activated, which depended on EGFR in Cr(VI)-transformed BEAS-2B cells. Inhibition of PI3K/AKT increased ROS generation and reduced SOD2 expression, resulting in reduced apoptosis resistance with commitment increase in Bax expression and reduction of Bcl-2 expression. Xenograft mouse tumor study further demonstrates the essential role of EGFR in tumorigenesis of Cr(VI)-transformed cells. In summary, the present study suggests that ligand-dependent constitutive activation of EGFR causes reduced ROS generation and increased antioxidant expression, leading to development of apoptosis resistance, contributing to Cr(VI)-induced tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1976671217,"With the increasing recognition of health literacy as a worldwide research priority, the development and refinement of indices to measure the construct is an important area of inquiry. Furthermore, the proliferation of online resources and research means that there is a growing need for self-administered instruments. We undertook a systematic overview to identify all published self-administered health literacy assessment indices to report their content and considerations associated with their administration. A primary aim of this study was to assist those seeking to employ a self-reported health literacy index to select one that has been developed and validated for an appropriate context, as well as with desired administration characteristics. Systematic searches were carried out in four electronic databases, and studies were included if they reported the development and/or validation of a novel health literacy assessment measure. Data were systematically extracted on key characteristics of the instruments: breadth of construct (""generic"" vs. ""content- or context- specific"" health literacy), whether it was an original instrument or a derivative, country of origin, administration characteristics, age of target population (adult vs. pediatric), and evidence for validity. 35 articles met the inclusion criteria. There were 27 original instruments (27/35; 77.1%) and 8 derivative instruments (8/35; 22.9%). 22 indices measured ""general"" health literacy (22/35; 62.9%) while the remainder measured condition- or context- specific health literacy (13/35; 37.1%). Most health literacy measures were developed in the United States (22/35; 62.9%), and about half had adequate face, content, and construct validity (16/35; 45.7%). Given the number of measures available for many specific conditions and contexts, and that several have acceptable validity, our findings suggest that the research agenda should shift towards the investigation and elaboration of health literacy as a construct itself, in order for research in health literacy measurement to progress."

Excess weight is also associated with decreases in physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness. The aim of the current study was to investigate the short-term effects of a 12-week Internet intervention in a primary care setting intended to increase cardiorespiratory fitness and HRQoL among overweight and obese adolescents.In this controlled trial, participants (13-15 years) were non-randomly allocated to an intervention- or a control group. The intervention group received 12-weeks access to an online program providing tailored physical activity counseling based on principles from Self-determination Theory and Motivational Interviewing. The control group received standard follow-up by the school nurses. The primary outcome measure of cardiorespiratory fitness was determined using a shuttle run test. The secondary outcomes: HRQoL, leisure time exercise, body image and self-determined motivation for physical activity and exercise, were assessed by self-report measures. Age- and gender-adjusted body mass index (BMI) was calculated based on measurements of height and weight. To compare pre-to post intervention differences within groups, a paired samples t-test was used while crude differences between groups were analyzed with an independent samples t-test.Of the 120 participants, 108 completed the study, 75 in the intervention group and 33 in the control group. Exposure to the intervention had a small effect on cardiorespiratory fitness (0.14; 95% CI [0.01;0.28]; P = 0.04), and a moderate effect on HRQoL (5.22; 95% CI [0.90; 9.53]; P = 0.02). Moreover, the control group increased significantly in BMI, yielding a moderate preventive effect on BMI (-0.39; 95% CI [-0.74;-0.03]; P = 0.03) for the intervention group.The results suggest that the Internet intervention with tailored physical activity counseling can have beneficial short-term effect on cardiorespiratory fitness, HRQoL and BMI among adolescents with overweight and obesity.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01700309."
https://openalex.org/W2034420014,"The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) from bee venom against acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity through CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells (Treg) in mice. Acetaminophen (APAP) is a widely used antipyretic and analgesic, but an acute or cumulative overdose of acetaminophen can cause severe hepatic failure. Tregs have been reported to possess protective effects in various liver diseases and kidney toxicity. We previously found that bee venom strongly increased the Treg population in splenocytes and subsequently suppressed immune disorders. More recently, we found that the effective component of bee venom is PLA2. Thus, we hypothesized that PLA2 could protect against liver injury induced by acetaminophen. To evaluate the hepatoprotective effects of PLA2, C57BL/6 mice or interleukin-10-deficient (IL-10−/−) mice were injected with PLA2 once a day for five days and sacrificed 24 h (h) after acetaminophen injection. The blood sera were collected 0, 6, and 24 h after acetaminophen injection for the analysis of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). PLA2-injected mice showed reduced levels of serum AST, ALT, proinflammatory cytokines, and nitric oxide (NO) compared with the PBS-injected control mice. However, IL-10 was significantly increased in the PLA2-injected mice. These hepatic protective effects were abolished in Treg-depleted mice by antibody treatment and in IL-10−/− mice. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that the protective effects of PLA2 against acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity can be mediated by modulating the Treg and IL-10 production."

In vertebrate photoreceptor cells, phototransduction begins with photon absorption by the photopigments. Rhodopsin or cone opsin triggers hydrolysis of cGMP by activating the phototransduction cascade. This closes the cGMP-gated cation channels (CNG) in the plasma membrane (PM) and hyperpolarizes the membrane (16Hunt D.M. Buch P. Michaelides M.

The role of GC1 in cGMP production is crucial for the recovery of phototransduction (19Stephen R. Filipek S. Palczewski K. Sousa M.C. Ca2+-dependent regulation of phototransduction.Photochem. Photobiol. 2008; 84: 903-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Impaired targeting of retinal membrane proteins is known to trigger degenerative diseases like retinitis pigmentosa and ciliopathies (20Lodowski K.H. Lee R. Ropelewski P. Nemet I. Tian G. Imanishi Y.

The proteins comprising the POS discs are made in the inner segment (IS) on the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) followed by post-translational modifications that occur in the ER and Golgi apparatus (22Deretic D.

A GC1 trafficking model proposes a vesicular mechanism (25Karan S. Zhang H. Li S. Frederick J.M. Baehr W.

Novel functions of photoreceptor guanylate cyclases revealed by targeted deletion.Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2010; 334: 141-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We previously showed that GC1 traffics to the POS by interacting with RD3 (15Azadi S. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. RD3, the protein associated with Leber congenital amaurosis type 12, is required for guanylate cyclase trafficking in photoreceptor cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 21158-21163Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We also showed that RD3 negatively regulates GC1, probably during protein trafficking (26Peshenko I.V. Olshevskaya E.V. Azadi S. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. Dizhoor A.M.

However, the exact mechanism of GC1 trafficking and OS targeting is still unknown. Guanylate cyclase-activating protein 1 (GCAP1) has been shown to regulate the activity of GC1 (27Sokal I. Haeseleer F. Arendt A. Adman E.T. Hargrave P.A. Palczewski K.

Biol. 2002; 514: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, studies using immunoprecipitation (IP) or direct binding assays have not established the physical interaction of GCAP1 with any other proteins. The most likely explanation for this finding is that the structure of GCAP1 varies highly under different conditions. GCAP1's binding with its partners occurs transiently under certain fluctuating ionic conditions (19Stephen R. Filipek S. Palczewski K. Sousa M.C. Ca2+-dependent regulation of phototransduction.Photochem. Photobiol. 2008; 84: 903-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 30Cuenca N. Lopez S. Howes K. Kolb H. The localization of guanylyl cyclase-activating proteins in the mammalian retina.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 1243-1250PubMed Google Scholar) known to occur during phototransduction. Mg2+ and Ca2+ levels significantly impact GC1's activation by GCAP1 (28Dizhoor A.M. Olshevskaya E.V. Peshenko I.V. Mg2+/Ca2+ cation binding cycle of guanylyl cyclase activating proteins (GCAPs): role in regulation of photoreceptor guanylyl cyclase.Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2010; 334: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Here, we report that GCAP1 directly binds to RD3 and that the presence of GC1, GCAP1, and RD3 in a complex is essential for GC1 to be successfully targeted to the POS. We show that 10 out of 24 LCA1 mutants in GC1 do not bind to RD3 in vitro. Our study suggests that a number of GC1-associated LCA1 disease phenotypes are caused by impaired RD3-GC1-GCAP1 complex formation and GC1 trafficking to the OS. All animal work was performed in strict accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals by the National Institutes of Health and the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Statement on the Use of Animals in Vision Research. All protocols were reviewed and approved by the IACUC of the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center. The human GC1 cDNA in pRcCMV was a gift from Dr. Alexander Dizhoor (Pennsylvania College of Optometry, Elkins Park, PA). Full-length human GCAP1 was generated by PCR using retinal cDNAs as templates in enhanced GFP vector (Addgene). Human GCAP2-Myc was purchased from Origene (MR202065). The GCAP-6B12 monoclonal antibody was generated in our laboratory from mice immunized with an affinity-purified GST fusion protein containing the C-terminal 45 amino acids of the mouse GCAP1 that had no homology with GCAP2. Polyclonal antibodies for RD3 and GC1 were generated against the last 16-amino acid C-terminal peptide of the mouse GC1 and RD3; details are presented in Table 1 (15Azadi S. Molday L.L. Molday R.S.

Single, double, and triple transfections were performed with 0.1 μg of human RD3, 0.2 μg of GC1, and 10 ng of GCAP1 plasmids using the calcium phosphate procedure (15Azadi S. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. RD3, the protein associated with Leber congenital amaurosis type 12, is required for guanylate cyclase trafficking in photoreceptor cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 21158-21163Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). At 22 and 48 h post-transfection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, washed with 1× PBS, and used for immunohistochemistry (IHC) and biochemical analyses. We prepared POS from retinas of post-natal 21 (P21) wild-type (WT), GC1−/−, GCAP−/−, and rd3−/− mice as described previously with slight modifications (35Martin R.E. Elliott M.H. Brush R.S. Anderson R.E. Detailed characterization of the lipid composition of detergent-resistant membranes from photoreceptor rod outer segment membranes.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2005; 46: 1147-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, retinas were fresh-frozen in liquid nitrogen in the presence of 10% sucrose and kept at −70 °C until the time of use. Three independent samples, each containing 3–5 retinas, were used. Retinal samples were homogenized in buffer A (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EDTA) with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) containing 47% sucrose in a Dounce tissue homogenizer, and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing crude POS was diluted with buffer A and centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Then the pellet was resuspended in 47% sucrose in buffer A and placed at the bottom of a discontinuous sucrose gradient layered with equal amounts of 37, 32, and 28% sucrose and centrifuged at 31,000 × g for 70 min at 4 °C. The band at the 28 and 32% interface contained purified ROS (POS), and the bands at the 37 and 47% interface contained non-ROS (POS) membranes, which also contained inner segment proteins. These were collected, diluted with buffer A, and pelleted by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Purified ROS and non-ROS pellets were resuspended to a final concentration of 1 μg/μl total protein in buffer A. IP studies using immunoaffinity matrix containing 6B12 antibody coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) were performed as described earlier (15Azadi S. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. RD3, the protein associated with Leber congenital amaurosis type 12, is required for guanylate cyclase trafficking in photoreceptor cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 21158-21163Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Human RD3 was cloned in pMAL-p5X vector (New England Biolabs, N8109S) containing a maltose-binding protein tag. Rd3-MBP was used for the following experiments. 1) For binding of bacterial RD3-MBP with endogenous bovine GCAP1, We incubated 1 μg of RD3-MB with 1 mg of bovine lysate for 2 h at 4 °C. We then added 60 μl of equilibrated 6B12-conjugated beads to the mixture and incubated for 30 min. Beads were washed and eluted with 1% SDS. 2) For binding of bacterial RD3-MBP with bacterial His-GCAP1, we incubated 1 μg of His-GCAP1 with 1 μg of RD3-MBP for 2 h in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 and MgCl2, which in our experience facilitates the binding of GCAP1 with its binding partners. Then we incubated the complex with 9D12 antibody-conjugated beads for 30 min. Beads were washed thoroughly and eluted with 10 mm amylose. The results were visualized by SDS gel and Western blotting. Approximately the same size of D2 loop of RDS (peripherin-2) was cloned in the same vector and served as a negative control under the same buffer conditions. We designed primers containing the mutations and performed site-directed mutagenesis by PCR with GeneArt site-directed mutagenesis system (Invitrogen A13282). We generated all known LCA1-causing GC1 mutants (4Karan S. Frederick J.M. Baehr W. Novel functions of photoreceptor guanylate cyclases revealed by targeted deletion.Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2010; 334: 141-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The entire GC1 cDNA was verified by sequencing. To avoid unwanted mutations in the vector backbone, the insert (GC1) for all mutants was excised and cloned in an unmodified vector. Cryosections from 21-day-old (P21) homozygous WT, GC1−/−, GCAP−/−, and rd3−/− mice, as well as COS-7 cells transfected with these genes, were labeled as described previously (42Zhong M. Molday L.L.

Samples were visualized under a ×40 objective with confocal microscopy. ImageJ software was used for quantification of IHC in COS-7 cells. In WT mouse retinas, GCAP1 is localized in the POS, IS, and the pedicles of the outer plexiform layer (Fig. 1A) (30Cuenca N. Lopez S. Howes K. Kolb H. The localization of guanylyl cyclase-activating proteins in the mammalian retina.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 1243-1250PubMed Google Scholar). In GC1−/− and rd3−/− retinas, GCAP1 is mainly located in the IS and is absent from the POS (Fig. 1, B and C). As expected, there was no GCAP1 in GCAP1/2−/−, hereafter called GCAP−/− (Fig. 1D). We initially found RD3 in the POS by mass spectrometry and IHC using acid-purified polyclonal antibody raised against this protein (15Azadi S. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. RD3, the protein associated with Leber congenital amaurosis type 12, is required for guanylate cyclase trafficking in photoreceptor cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

One of these antibodies works well in IHC without antigen retrieval, and it better reveals RD3 localization, as it labels POS, IS, axoneme, and outer plexiform layer (Fig. 1F, 62ab, see Fig. 2C for antibody specificity and characterization). Using this antibody, we found RD3 below the detection level in the GC1−/− retinas (Fig. 1G), while it accumulates in the POS of the GCAP−/− retinas and accumulates further in the photoreceptor axonemes (Fig. 1I, inset). This localization is consistent with our earlier report, but showed stronger labeling at the axonemes (15Azadi S. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. RD3, the protein associated with Leber congenital amaurosis type 12, is required for guanylate cyclase trafficking in photoreceptor cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

A, specificity of 6B12 against GCAP1 (in relation with GCAP2) was validated by expressing mouse GCAP1-GFP and mouse GCAP2-Myc in HEK293 cells. 6B12 did not recognize the GCAP2 protein. This was expected, as this antibody was raised against the C-terminal region (last 45 amino acids) of mouse GCAP1, which was quite different from GCAP2. The specificity of 6B12 was examined in bovine, mouse, pig, rat, and GCAP−/− mouse retinas. B, Western blot of 75 (GC1) antibody in WT mouse, bovine, rat, and GC1−/− mouse retinas, suggesting the specificity of the 75 antibody in mouse retina.

Neurosci. 2002; 15: 63-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We generated a new GC1 antibody (75 ab, see Fig. 2B for the specificity of the antibody), which confirms GC1 localization to the POS of rods and cones (Fig. 1K). As expected, GC1 is absent from GC1−/− (Fig. 1L) and rd3−/− retinas (Fig. 1M), confirming earlier findings (15Azadi S. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. RD3, the protein associated with Leber congenital amaurosis type 12, is required for guanylate cyclase trafficking in photoreceptor cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 21158-21163Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found GC1 labeling in the POS of the GCAP−/− retinas, albeit at a lower intensity than in WT retinas (Fig. 1N).

https://openalex.org/W1994432822,"Background In the United Kingdom, patients with locally advanced rectal cancer routinely receive neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. However, the effects of this on physical fitness are unclear. This pilot study is aimed to investigate the effect of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy on objectively measured in vivo muscle mitochondrial function and whole-body physical fitness. Methods We prospectively studied 12 patients with rectal cancer who completed standardized neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, recruited from a large tertiary cancer centre, between October 2012 and July 2013. All patients underwent a cardiopulmonary exercise test and a phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy quadriceps muscle exercise-recovery study before and after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Data were analysed and reported blind to patient identity and clinical course. Primary variables of interest were the two physical fitness measures; oxygen uptake at estimated anaerobic threshold and oxygen uptake at Peak exercise (ml.kg−1.min−1), and the post-exercise phosphocreatine recovery rate constant (min−1), a measure of muscle mitochondrial capacity in vivo. Results Median age was 67 years (IQR 64–75). Differences (95%CI) in all three primary variables were significantly negative post-NACRT: Oxygen uptake at estimated anaerobic threshold −2.4 ml.kg−1.min−1 (−3.8, −0.9), p = 0.004; Oxygen uptake at Peak −4.0 ml.kg−1.min−1 (−6.8, −1.1), p = 0.011; and post-exercise phosphocreatine recovery rate constant −0.34 min−1 (−0.51, −0.17), p<0.001. Conclusion The significant decrease in both whole-body physical fitness and in vivo muscle mitochondrial function raises the possibility that muscle mitochondrial mechanisms, no doubt multifactorial, may be important in deterioration of physical fitness following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. This may have implications for targeted interventions to improve physical fitness pre-surgery. Trial Registration Clinicaltrials.gov registration NCT01859442"
https://openalex.org/W2090109392,"Objectives To investigate the role of pericytes in constructing the malformed microvessels (MVs) and participating microvascular architecture heterogeneity of glioma. Methods Forty human glioma tissue samples (WHO grade II-IV) were included in present study. Observation of blood vessel patterns, quantitative analysis of endothelial cells (ECs)- and pericyte-labeled MVs and comparison between malignant grades based on single- or double-immunohistochemical staining. The MV number density (MVND), microvascular pericyte number density (MPND), and microvascular pericyte area density (MPAD) were calculated. The expression of PDGFβ was also scored after immunostaining. Results In grade II glioma, most of tumor MVs were the thin-wall CD34+ vessels with near normal morphology. In addition to thin-wall CD34+ MVs, more thick-wall MVs were found in grade III glioma, which often showed α-SMA positive. Most of MVs in grade IV glioma were in the form of plexus, curled cell cords and glomeruloid microvascular proliferation while the α-SMA+ cells were the main components. The MVs usually showed disordered arrangement, loose connection and active cell proliferation as shown by Ki67 and α-SMA coexpression. With the increase of glioma grades, the α-SMA+ MVND, CD34+ MVND and MPND were significantly augmented although the increase of CD34+ MVND but not MPAD was statistically insignificant between grade III and IV. It was interesting that some vessel-like structures only consist of α-SMA+ cells, assuming the guiding role of pericytes in angiogenesis. The expression level of PDGFβ was upregulated and directly correlated with the MPND in different glioma grades. Conclusion Hyperplasia of pericytes was one of the significant characteristics of malignant glioma and locally proliferated pericytes were the main constituent of MVs in high grade glioma. The pathological characteristics of pericytes could be used as indexes of malignant grades of glioma."

https://openalex.org/W1996080702,"Four crystal structures of human YKL-39 were solved in the absence and presence of chitooligosaccharides. The structure of YKL-39 comprises a major (β/α)8 triose-phosphate isomerase barrel domain and a small α + β insertion domain. Structural analysis demonstrates that YKL-39 interacts with chitooligosaccharides through hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. The binding of chitin fragments induces local conformational changes that facilitate tight binding. Compared with other GH-18 members, YKL-39 has the least extended chitin-binding cleft, containing five subsites for sugars, namely (−3)(−2)(−1)(+1)(+2), with Trp-360 playing a prominent role in the sugar-protein interactions at the center of the chitin-binding cleft. Evaluation of binding affinities obtained from isothermal titration calorimetry and intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy suggests that YKL-39 binds to chitooligosaccharides with Kd values in the micromolar concentration range and that the binding energies increase with the chain length. There were no significant differences between the Kd values of chitopentaose and chitohexaose, supporting the structural evidence for the five binding subsite topology. Thermodynamic analysis indicates that binding of chitooligosaccharide to YKL-39 is mainly driven by enthalpy. Background: Human YKL-39 is currently recognized as a biomarker for osteoarthritis. Results: Crystal structures of YKL-39 reveal that chitooligosaccharide induces local conformational changes to stabilize sugar·protein complexes and that the protein contains five binding subsites for sugars. Conclusion: YKL-39 binds to chitooligosaccharide through enthalpic reactions. Significance: Our findings suggest how YKL-39 interacts with GlcNAc moieties of the natural ligands, which may possibly activate local tissue inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2054535836,"Background Stromal cell-derived factor-1(SDF-1) is a chemotactic and angiogenic factor that mediates the repair of various tissues. As macrophages are important contributors to ischemic kidney injury, we examine the role of SDF-1 in a rodent model of ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Methods Male wild-type (WT) (C57BL/6) mice were subjected to bilateral I/R injury or sham operation in the presence or absence of macrophage depletion (liposomal clodronate [0.2 ml/20–25 g body weight i.p.]). Macrophage accumulation was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Tissue levels of SDF-1 (ELISA) and SDF-1 mRNA expression (real-time PCR) were measured. The cellular location of SDF-1 was assessed using immunohistochemical staining. Results Immunofluorescence staining of renal tissue sections confirmed macrophage depletion by liposomal clodronate. SDF-1 production was elevated in response to I/R injury and was significantly increased upon macrophage depletion. SDF-1 positive cells initially appeared initially in the cortex, and subsequently diffused to the outer medulla after I/R injury. Conclusions Our study demonstrates that SDF-1 is significantly upregulated during renal I/R. We hypothesize that SDF-1 upregulation may be an important macrophage effector mechanism during I/R injury."
https://openalex.org/W2003398380,"Background and Objective The determination of warfarin, RS/SR- and RR/SS-warfarin alcohols in oral fluid may offer additional information to the INR assay. This study aimed to establish an optimized sampling technique providing the best correlation between the oral fluid and the unbound plasma concentrations of these compounds. Materials and Methods Samples of non-stimulated and stimulated oral fluid, and blood were collected from 14 patients undergoing warfarin therapy. After acidification, analytes were extracted with a dichloromethane/hexane mixture and determined by HPLC with fluorescence detection. Plasma samples were also ultrafiltered for the determination of the unbound fraction. The chromatographic separation was carried out in isocratic conditions with a phosphate buffer/methanol mobile phase on a C-18 reversed-phase column. The absence of interfering compounds was verified by HPLC-ESI-Q-TOF. Results Stimulation generally increased the oral fluid pH to values close to blood pH in about 6 minutes. The concentration of warfarin and RS/SR-warfarin alcohols in oral fluid followed the same trend, whereas the concentration of RR/SS-warfarin alcohols was not affected. Six minute stimulation with chewing gum followed by collection with a polyester swab was the best sampling procedure, with a good repeatability (RSD <10%) and relatively low inter-subject variability (RSD = 30%) of the oral fluid to plasma ratio. This procedure provided strong correlations between the measured oral fluid and unbound plasma concentration of warfarin (r = 0.92, p <0.001) and RS/SR-warfarin alcohols (r = 0.84, p <0.001), as well as between stimulated oral fluid and total plasma concentration of warfarin (r = 0.78, p <0.001) and RS/SR-warfarin alcohols (r = 0.81, p <0.001). Conclusion The very good correlation between oral fluid and unbound plasma concentration of warfarin and RS/SR-warfarin alcohols suggests that oral fluid analysis could provide clinically useful information for the monitoring of anticoagulant therapy, complementary to the INR assay."
https://openalex.org/W2082650990,"Longan (Dimocarpus longan L.) is a tropical/subtropical fruit tree of significant economic importance in Southeast Asia. However, a lack of transcriptomic and genomic information hinders research on longan traits, such as the control of flowering. In this study, high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was used to investigate differentially expressed genes between a unique longan cultivar ‘Sijimi’(S) which flowers throughout the year and a more typical cultivar ‘Lidongben’(L) which flowers only once in the season, with the aim of identifying candidate genes associated with continuous flowering. 36,527 and 40,982 unigenes were obtained by de novo assembly of the clean reads from cDNA libraries of L and S cultivars. Additionally 40,513 unigenes were assembled from combined reads of these libraries. A total of 32,475 unigenes were annotated by BLAST search to NCBI non-redundant protein (NR), Swiss-Prot, Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases. Of these, almost fifteen thousand unigenes were identified as significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by using Reads Per kb per Million reads (RPKM) method. A total of 6,415 DEGs were mapped to 128 KEGG pathways, and 8,743 DEGs were assigned to 54 Gene Ontology categories. After blasting the DEGs to public sequence databases, 539 potential flowering-related DEGs were identified. In addition, 107 flowering-time genes were identified in longan, their expression levels between two longan samples were compared by RPKM method, of which the expression levels of 15 were confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR. Our results suggest longan homologues of SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP), GIGANTEA (GI), F-BOX 1 (FKF1) and EARLY FLOWERING 4 (ELF4) may be involved this flowering trait and ELF4 may be a key gene. The identification of candidate genes related to continuous flowering will provide new insight into the molecular process of regulating flowering time in woody plants."
https://openalex.org/W2086437274,"Background Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) has the potential to be used widely as a method of assessing body fatness and composition, both in clinical and community settings. BIA provides bioelectrical properties, such as whole-body impedance which ideally needs to be calibrated against a gold-standard method in order to provide accurate estimates of fat-free mass. UK studies in older children and adolescents have shown that, when used in multi-ethnic populations, calibration equations need to include ethnic-specific terms, but whether this holds true for younger children remains to be elucidated. The aims of this study were to examine ethnic differences in body size, proportions and composition in children aged 5 to 11 years, and to establish the extent to which such differences could influence BIA calibration. Methods In a multi-ethnic population of 2171 London primary school-children (47% boys; 34% White, 29% Black African/Caribbean, 25% South Asian, 12% Other) detailed anthropometric measurements were performed and ethnic differences in body size and proportion were assessed. Ethnic differences in fat-free mass, derived by deuterium dilution, were further evaluated in a subsample of the population (n = 698). Multiple linear regression models were used to calibrate BIA against deuterium dilution. Results In children <11 years of age, Black African/Caribbean children were significantly taller, heavier and had larger body size than children of other ethnicities. They also had larger waist and limb girths and relatively longer legs. Despite these differences, ethnic-specific terms did not contribute significantly to the BIA calibration equation (Fat-free mass = 1.12+0.71*(height2/impedance)+0.18*weight). Conclusion Although clear ethnic differences in body size, proportions and composition were evident in this population of young children aged 5 to 11 years, an ethnic-specific BIA calibration equation was not required."
https://openalex.org/W2095592075,"Blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption is common following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI can longitudinally measure the transport coefficient Ktrans which reflects BBB permeability. Ktrans measurements however are not widely used in TBI research because it is generally considered to be noisy and possesses low spatial resolution. We improved spatiotemporal resolution and signal sensitivity of Ktrans MRI in rats by using a high-sensitivity surface transceiver coil. To overcome the signal drop off profile of the surface coil, a pre-scan module was used to map the flip angle (B1 field) and magnetization (M0) distributions. A series of T1-weighted gradient echo images were acquired and fitted to the extended Kety model with reversible or irreversible leakage, and the best model was selected using F-statistics. We applied this method to study the rat brain one hour following controlled cortical impact (mild to moderate TBI), and observed clear depiction of the BBB damage around the impact regions, which matched that outlined by Evans Blue extravasation. Unlike the relatively uniform T2 contrast showing cerebral edema, Ktrans shows a pronounced heterogeneous spatial profile in and around the impact regions, displaying a nonlinear relationship with T2. This improved Ktrans MRI method is also compatible with the use of high-sensitivity surface coil and the high-contrast two-coil arterial spin-labeling method for cerebral blood flow measurement, enabling more comprehensive investigation of the pathophysiology in TBI."
https://openalex.org/W1989735120,"Setting The impact of diabetes on tuberculosis in United States and foreign-born populations in San Francisco has not been studied. Objective To determine the characteristics, prevalence and temporal trends of diabetes in US and foreign-born persons attending the San Francisco Tuberculosis Clinic. Design We analyzed data from individuals seeking medical attention at the San Francisco Tuberculosis Clinic. We included patients with diagnosis of tuberculosis, latent infection, or not infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We assessed the temporal trend and the characteristics of individuals with and without diabetes. Result Between 2005 and 2012, there were 4371 (19.0%) individuals without evidence of tuberculosis infection, 17,856 (77.6%) with latent tuberculosis, and 791 (3.4%) with tuberculosis. 66% were born in the United States, China, Mexico, and the Philippines. The prevalence of diabetes was the highest among individuals with tuberculosis and increased during the study period. Patients with tuberculosis and diabetes were more likely to be male, older than 45 years and born in the Philippines. There was a disproportionate association of TB and DM relative to LTBI and DM among Filipinos in individuals older than 45 years old. Conclusions Our data suggest that Filipinos older than 45 years old are more likely to have tuberculosis probably due to a higher prevalence of diabetes. In San Francisco, tuberculosis-screening programs in individuals with diabetes and latent tuberculosis may be beneficial in patients older than 45 years old especially from the Philippines."
https://openalex.org/W1995941333,"A seeming paradox of sickle cell disease is that patients do not suffer from a high prevalence of systemic hypertension in spite of endothelial dysfunction, chronic inflammation and vasculopathy. However, some patients do develop systolic hypertension and increased pulse pressure, an increasingly recognized major cardiovascular risk factor in other populations. Hence, we hypothesized that pulse pressure, unlike other blood pressure parameters, is independently associated with markers of hemolytic anemia and cardiovascular risk in sickle cell disease. We analyzed the correlates of pulse pressure in patients (n = 661) enrolled in a multicenter international sickle cell trial. Markers of hemolysis were analyzed as independent variables and as a previously validated hemolytic index that includes multiple variables. We found that pulse pressure, not systolic, diastolic or mean arterial pressure, independently correlated with high reticulocyte count (beta = 2.37, p = 0.02) and high hemolytic index (beta = 1.53, p = 0.002) in patients with homozygous sickle cell disease in two multiple linear regression models which include the markers of hemolysis as independent variables or the hemolytic index, respectively. Pulse pressure was also independently associated with elevated serum creatinine (beta = 3.21, p = 0.02), and with proteinuria (beta = 2.52, p = 0.04). These results from the largest sickle cell disease cohort to date since the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease show that pulse pressure is independently associated with hemolysis, proteinuria and chronic kidney disease. We propose that high pulse pressure may be a risk factor for clinical complications of vascular dysfunction in sickle cell disease. Longitudinal and mechanistic studies should be conducted to confirm these hypotheses."
https://openalex.org/W2009151188,"DDT and lindane are highly toxic organochlorine pesticides and posing adverse effects on the environment and public health due to their frequent usage in developing countries. ABCC4/MRP4 is an organic anion transporter that mediates cellular efflux of a wide range of exogenous and endogenous compounds such as cyclic nucleotides and anti-cancer drugs; however, it remains unclear whether ABCC4 and its orthologs function in the detoxification of organochlorine pesticides. Here, we demonstrated the roles of zebrafish Abcc4 in cellular efflux of DDT and lindane. Zebrafish abcc4 was maternally expressed in the oocytes and its transcripts were detected in the lens, pancreas, gills, liver, intestine and bladder of developing embryos and in adult tissues examined. DDT and lindane were able to induce the expression of abcc4 gene and overexpression of Abcc4 significantly decreased the cytotoxicity and accumulation of DDT and lindane in LLC-PK1 cells and developing embryos. In contrast, overexpression of an Abcc4-G1188D mutant abolished its transporter function without effects on its substrate binding activity, and sensitized LLC-PK1 cells and developing embryos to toxic pesticides. Moreover, glutathione (GSH) was involved in the efflux of cellular pesticides and ATPase activity in developing embryos can be induced by DDT or lindane. Thus, zebrafish Abcc4 plays crucial roles in cellular efflux of organochlorine pesticides and can be used a potential molecular marker for the monitor of DDT and lindane contamination in the aquatic environment."
https://openalex.org/W2032496997,"Objective The purpose of this study was to develop a core set of indicators that could be used for measuring and monitoring the performance of primary health care organizations' capacity and strategies for enhancing equity-oriented care. Methods Indicators were constructed based on a review of the literature and a thematic analysis of interview data with patients and staff (n = 114) using procedures for qualitatively derived data. We used a modified Delphi process where the indicators were circulated to staff at the Health Centers who served as participants (n = 63) over two rounds. Indicators were considered part of a priority set of health equity indicators if they received an overall importance rating of>8.0, on a scale of 1–9, where a higher score meant more importance. Results Seventeen indicators make up the priority set. Items were eliminated because they were rated as low importance (<8.0) in both rounds and were either redundant or more than one participant commented that taking action on the indicator was highly unlikely. In order to achieve health care equity, performance at the organizational level is as important as assessing the performance of staff. Two of the highest rated “treatment” or processes of care indicators reflects the need for culturally safe and trauma and violence-informed care. There are four indicators that can be used to measure outcomes which can be directly attributable to equity responsive primary health care. Discussion These indicators and subsequent development of items can be used to measure equity in the domains of treatment and outcomes. These areas represent targets for higher performance in relation to equity for organizations (e.g., funding allocations to ongoing training in equity-oriented care provision) and providers (e.g., reflexive practice, skill in working with the health effects of trauma)."
https://openalex.org/W1973910792,"Introduction Mucositis induced by anti-neoplastic drugs is an important, dose-limiting and costly side-effect of cancer therapy. Aim To evaluate the effect of the topical application of S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), a nitric oxide donor, on 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-induced oral mucositis in hamsters. Materials and Methods Oral mucositis was induced in male hamsters by two intraperitoneal administrations of 5-FU on the first and second days of the experiment (60 and 40 mg/kg, respectively) followed by mechanical trauma on the fourth day. Animals received saline, HPMC or HPMC/GSNO (0.1, 0.5 or 2.0 mM) 1 h prior to the 5-FU injection and twice a day for 10 or 14 days. Samples of cheek pouches were harvested for: histopathological analysis, TNF-α and IL-1β levels, immunohistochemical staining for iNOS, TNF-α, IL-1β, Ki67 and TGF-β RII and a TUNEL assay. The presence and levels of 39 bacterial taxa were analyzed using the Checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. The profiles of NO released from the HPMC/GSNO formulations were characterized using chemiluminescence. Results The HPMC/GSNO formulations were found to provide sustained release of NO for more than 4 h at concentration-dependent rates of 14 to 80 nmol/mL/h. Treatment with HPMC/GSNO (0.5 mM) significantly reduced mucosal damage, inflammatory alterations and cell death associated with 5-FU-induced oral mucositis on day 14 but not on day 10. HPMC/GSNO administration also reversed the inhibitory effect of 5-FU on cell proliferation on day 14. In addition, we observed that the chemotherapy significantly increased the levels and/or prevalence of several bacterial species. Conclusion Topical HPMC/GSNO accelerates mucosal recovery, reduces inflammatory parameters, speeds up re-epithelization and decreases levels of periodontopathic species in mucosal ulcers."
https://openalex.org/W2052420840,"Background In March 2012, The Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation trained maternal and child health workers in Southern Province of Zambia to use a new rapid syphilis test (RST) during routine antenatal care. A recent study by Bonawitz et al. (2014) evaluated the impact of this roll out in Kalomo District. This paper estimates the costs and cost-effectiveness from the provider's perspective under the actual conditions observed during the first year of the RST roll out. Methods Information on materials used and costs were extracted from program records. A decision-analytic model was used to evaluate the costs (2012 USD) and cost-effectiveness. Basic parameters needed for the model were based on the results from the evaluation study. Results During the evaluation study, 62% of patients received a RST, and 2.8% of patients tested were positive (and 10.4% of these were treated). Even with very high RST sensitivity and specificity (98%), true prevalence of active syphilis would be substantially less (estimated at <0.7%). For 1,000 new ANC patients, costs of screening and treatment were estimated at $2,136, and the cost per avoided disability-adjusted-life year lost (DALY) was estimated at $628. Costs change little if all positives are treated (because prevalence is low and treatment costs are small), but the cost-per-DALY avoided falls to just $66. With full adherence to guidelines, costs increase to $3,174 per 1,000 patients and the cost-per-DALY avoided falls to $60. Conclusions Screening for syphilis is only useful for reducing adverse birth outcomes if patients testing positive are actually treated. Even with very low prevalence of syphilis (a needle in the haystack), cost effectiveness improves dramatically if those found positive are treated; additional treatment costs little but DALYs avoided are substantial. Without treatment, the needle is essentially found and thrown back into the haystack."
https://openalex.org/W2084560547,"Understanding spreading dynamics will benefit society as a whole in better preventing and controlling diseases, as well as facilitating the socially responsible information while depressing destructive rumors. In network-based spreading dynamics, edges with different weights may play far different roles: a friend from afar usually brings novel stories, and an intimate relationship is highly risky for a flu epidemic. In this article, we propose a weighted susceptible-infected-susceptible model on complex networks, where the weight of an edge is defined by the topological proximity of the two associated nodes. Each infected individual is allowed to select limited number of neighbors to contact, and a tunable parameter is introduced to control the preference to contact through high-weight or low-weight edges. Experimental results on six real networks show that the epidemic prevalence can be largely promoted when strong ties are favored in the spreading process. By comparing with two statistical null models respectively with randomized topology and randomly redistributed weights, we show that the distribution pattern of weights, rather than the topology, mainly contributes to the experimental observations. Further analysis suggests that the weight-weight correlation strongly affects the results: high-weight edges are more significant in keeping high epidemic prevalence when the weight-weight correlation is present."
https://openalex.org/W2003120999,"The subfamily Triatominae, vectors of Chagas disease, comprises 140 species characterized by a highly homogeneous chromosome number. We analyzed the chromosomal distribution and evolution of repeated sequences in Triatominae genomes by Genomic in situ Hybridization using Triatoma delpontei and Triatoma infestans genomic DNAs as probes. Hybridizations were performed on their own chromosomes and on nine species included in six genera from the two main tribes: Triatomini and Rhodniini. Genomic probes clearly generate two different hybridization patterns, dispersed or accumulated in specific regions or chromosomes. The three used probes generate the same hybridization pattern in each species. However, these patterns are species-specific. In closely related species, the probes strongly hybridized in the autosomal heterochromatic regions, resembling C-banding and DAPI patterns. However, in more distant species these co-localizations are not observed. The heterochromatic Y chromosome is constituted by highly repeated sequences, which is conserved among 10 species of Triatomini tribe suggesting be an ancestral character for this group. However, the Y chromosome in Rhodniini tribe is markedly different, supporting the early evolutionary dichotomy between both tribes. In some species, sex chromosomes and autosomes shared repeated sequences, suggesting meiotic chromatin exchanges among these heterologous chromosomes. Our GISH analyses enabled us to acquire not only reliable information about autosomal repeated sequences distribution but also an insight into sex chromosome evolution in Triatominae. Furthermore, the differentiation obtained by GISH might be a valuable marker to establish phylogenetic relationships and to test the controversial origin of the Triatominae subfamily."

Few studies have been conducted in rural areas of China. In order to examine the association between maternal chronic HBV infection and risk of PIH in Liuyang rural area China, we enrolled 6,195 eligible pregnant women in 2010-2011 in selected 14 towns of Liuyang on their first prenatal visit to local maternity care unit. A total of 461 subjects (7.44% (95%CI: 6.79%, 8.10%)) were identified with positive HBsAg status (exposed group) and 5734 were non-HBV carriers (unexposed group). Multivariate log-binomial regression models were used to estimate the risk of PIH, gestational hypertension (GH), and preeclampsia (PE) in relation to maternal chronic HBV infection. There are total of 455 subjects diagnosed with PIH (7.34% (95%CI: 6.70%, 7.99%)), including 371 GH (5.99% (95%CI: 5.40%, 6.58%)) and 81 PE (1.31% (95%CI: 1.07%, 1.64%)). The crude risk ratio between PIH, GH, PE and maternal HBV infection were 1.20 (95%CI: 0.88, 1.64), 1.30(95%CI: 0.93, 1.81) and 0.79 (95%CI: 0.32, 1.93), respectively. After adjustment for gravidity history, abortion history, family history of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and family history of hypertension, positive HBsAg status was still not significantly associated with PIH (RR = 1.18, 95%CI: 0.87, 1.62), GH (RR = 1.27, 95%CI: 0.91, 1.78) or PE (RR = 0.79, 95%CI: 0.32, 1.95). Additional adjustment for maternal age, marital status, parity history, family history of DM, Body Mass Index at first antenatal visit, folic acid supplementation, smoking status during pregnancy and economic status of living area, multivariate analysis provided similar results. In conclusion, our study found that maternal chronic HBV infection prevalence rate is 7.4% among Liuyang rural area and there is no significant association between maternal HBV infection and the risk of PIH, GH or PE."
https://openalex.org/W2135437300,"Purpose To study the clinical correlates of pattern of deposits over the lens in patients with pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PXF) or pseudoexfoliation glaucoma. Methods This retrospective observational study screened 346 patients with PXF seen in glaucoma clinic of a tertiary hospital from 2011–2013. Details like pattern of deposits, location on the lens surface and pupillary abnormalities in slit lamp photographs and their correlation with clinical and demographic variables, were analysed. Results A total of 84 eyes of 42 patients with bilateral PXF were included for the study. Glaucoma was seen in 30 eyes with baseline IOP of 24+3.8 mm Hg. Comparing the type of deposits, namely classical (n = 39 eyes), radial pigmentary (RP) form (n = 39 eyes) and combined classical and radial pigmentary (CR) forms (n = 6 eyes) of deposits, pupillary ruff atrophy was common in all forms while poor dilatation was rare in the RP type (n = 5 vs n = 25 in classical forms, p<0.001). Mean deviation (MD) was worse in the classical and CR form as compared to RP type with the latter presenting much earlier, 43±3.2 years vs 48±4.1 years in CR and 56±5.7 years in classical form, p<0.001. The baseline IOP in the RP group (18±2.3 mm Hg) was significantly lower than the other two forms (CR 20±3.2 mm Hg, classical 28±2.3 mm Hg), p<0.001, with only 2 eyes on anti-glaucoma drugs at presentation.

Although three years have passed since the accident, residents around the FNPP are anxious about internal radiation exposure due to radiocesium. In this study, we screened internal radiation exposure doses in Iwaki city of Fukushima prefecture, using a whole-body counter. The first screening was conducted from October 2012 to February 2013, and the second screening was conducted from May to November 2013. Study participants were employees of ALPINE and their families who underwent examination. A total of 2,839 participants (1,366 men and 1,473 women, 1–86 years old) underwent the first screening, and 2,092 (1,022 men and 1,070 women, 1–86 years old) underwent the second screening. The results showed that 99% of subjects registered below 300 Bq per body in the first screening, and all subjects registered below 300 Bq per body in the second screening. The committed effective dose ranged from 0.01–0.06 mSv in the first screening and 0.01–0.02 mSv in the second screening. Long-term follow-up studies are needed to avoid unnecessary chronic internal exposure and to reduce anxiety among the residents by communicating radiation health risks."
https://openalex.org/W1965339742,"While regulation of the activity of developmental control genes at the transcriptional level as well as by specific miRNA-based degradation are intensively studied, little is known whether general cellular mechanisms controlling mRNA decay may contribute to differential stability of mRNAs of developmental control genes. Here, we investigate whether a mutation in the deadenylation dependent mRNA decay pathway may reveal differential effects on developmental mechanisms, using dopaminergic differentiation in the zebrafish brain as model system. In a zebrafish genetic screen aimed at identifying genes controlling dopaminergic neuron development we isolated the m1061 mutation that selectively caused increased dopaminergic differentiation in the caudal hypothalamus, while other dopaminergic groups were not affected. Positional cloning revealed that m1061 causes a premature stop codon in the cnot8 open reading frame. Cnot8 is a component of the Ccr4-Not complex and displays deadenylase activity, which is required for removal of the poly (A) tail in bulk mRNA turnover. Analyses of expression of developmental regulators indicate that loss of Cnot8 activity results in increased mRNA in situ hybridization signal levels for a subset of developmental control genes. We show that in the area of caudal hypothalamic dopaminergic differentiation, mRNA levels for several components of the FGF signaling pathway, including Fgf3, FGF receptors, and FGF target genes, are increased. Pharmacological inhibition of FGF signaling or a mutation in the fgf3 gene can compensate the gain of caudal hypothalamic dopaminergic neurons in cnot8m1061 mutants, indicating a role for Fgf3 in control of development of this dopaminergic population. The cnot8m1061 mutant phenotype provides an in vivo system to study roles of the Cnot8 deadenylase component of the mRNA decay pathway in vertebrate development. Our data indicate that attenuation of Cnot8 activity differentially affects mRNA levels of developmental control genes."
https://openalex.org/W2040978848,"When the head is subject to non-penetrating (blunt) impact, contusion-type injuries are commonly identified beneath the impact site (the coup) and, in some instances, at the opposite pole (the contre-coup). This pattern of injury has long eluded satisfactory explanation and blunt head injury mechanisms in general remain poorly understood. There are only a small number of studies in the open literature investigating the head's response to short duration impacts, which can occur in collisions with light projectiles. As such, the head impact literature to date has focussed almost exclusively on impact scenarios which lead to a quasi-static pressure response in the brain. In order to investigate the response of the head to a wide range of impact durations, parametric numerical studies were performed on a highly bio-fidelic finite element model of the human head created from in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan data with non-linear tissue material properties. We demonstrate that short duration head impacts can lead to potentially deleterious transients of positive and negative intra-cranial pressure over an order of magnitude larger than those observed in the quasi-static regime despite reduced impact force and energy. The onset of this phenomenon is shown to be effectively predicted by the ratio of impact duration to the period of oscillation of the first ovalling mode of the system. These findings point to dramatically different pressure distributions in the brain and hence different patterns of injury depending on projectile mass, and provide a potential explanation for dual coup/contre-coup injuries observed clinically."
https://openalex.org/W1984720273,"Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) contributes to airway smooth muscle (ASM) cell hyperplasia in asthma. Humanized single-chain variable fragment antibody (scFv) was well characterized as a CTGF antagonist in the differentiation of fibroblast into myofibroblast and pulmonary fibrosis in our previous studies. To further improve the bioactivity of scFv, we constructed a plasmid to express scFv-linker-matrilin-6×His fusion proteins that could self-assemble into the scFv dimers by disulfide bonds in matrilin under non-reducing conditions. An immunoreactivity assay demonstrated that the scFv dimer could highly bind to CTGF in a concentration-dependent manner. The MTT and EdU assay results revealed that CTGF (≥10 ng/mL) promoted the proliferation of ASM cells, and this effect was inhibited when the cells were treated with anti-CTGF scFv dimer. The western blot analysis results showed that increased phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR induced by CTGF could be suppressed by this scFv dimer. Based on these findings, anti-CTGF scFv dimer may be a potential agent for the prevention of airway remodeling in asthma."
https://openalex.org/W2089420072,"Cryptococcus gattii is unique among human pathogenic fungi with specialized ecological niche on trees. Since leaves concentrate CO2, we investigated the role of this gaseous molecule in C. gattii biology and virulence. We focused on the genetic analyses of β-carbonic anhydrase (β-CA) encoded by C. gattii CAN1 and CAN2 as later is critical for CO2 sensing in a closely related pathogen C. neoformans. High CO2 conditions induced robust development of monokaryotic hyphae and spores in C. gattii. Conversely, high CO2 completely repressed hyphae development in sexual mating. Both CAN1 and CAN2 were dispensable for CO2 induced morphogenetic transitions. However, C. gattii CAN2 was essential for growth in ambient air similar to its reported role in C. neoformans. Both can1 and can2 mutants retained full pathogenic potential in vitro and in vivo. These results provide insight into C. gattii adaptation for arboreal growth and production of infectious propagules by β-CA independent mechanism(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1996836998,"Objectives Participants with complete accelerometer data often represent a low proportion of the total sample and, in some cases, may be distinguishable from participants with incomplete data. Because traditional reliability methods characterize the consistency of complete data, little is known about reliability properties for an entire sample. This study employed Generalizability theory to report an index of reliability characterizing complete (7 days) and observable (1 to 7 days) accelerometer data. Design Cross-sectional. Methods Accelerometer data from the Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development were analyzed in this study. Missing value analyses were conducted to describe the pattern and mechanism of missing data. Generalizability coefficients were derived from variance components to report reliability parameters for complete data and also for the entire observable sample. Analyses were conducted separately by age (9, 11, 12, and 15 yrs) and daily wear time criteria (6, 8, 10, and 12 hrs). Results Participants with complete data were limited (<34%) and, most often, data were not considered to be missing completely at random. Across conditions, reliability coefficients for complete data were between 0.74 and 0.87. Relatively lower reliability properties were found across all observable data, ranging from 0.52 to 0.67. Sample variability increased with longer wear time criteria, but decreased with advanced age. Conclusions A reliability coefficient that includes all participants, not just those with complete data, provides a global perspective of reliability that could be used to further understand group level associations between activity and health outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W1994804834,"A miniature pig model of ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR) was developed by posterior mitral chordae tendinae rupture and implantation of an ameroid constrictor. A 2.5-mm ameroid constrictor was placed around the left circumflex coronary artery (LCX) of male Tibetan miniature pigs to induce ischemia, while the posterior mitral chordae tendinae was also ruptured. X-ray coronary angiography, ECG analysis, echocardiography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were used to evaluate heart structure and function in pigs at baseline and one, two, four and eight weeks after the operation. Blood velocity of the mitral regurgitation was found to be between medium and high levels. Angiographic analyses revealed that the LCX closure was 10–20% at one week, 30–40% at two weeks and 90–100% at four weeks subsequent ameroid constrictor implantation. ECG analysis highlighted an increase in the diameter of the left atria (LA) at two weeks post-operation as well as ischemic changes in the left ventricle (LV) and LA wall at four weeks post-operation. Echocardiography and MRI further detected a gradual increase in LA and LV volumes from two weeks post-operation. LV end diastolic and systolic volumes as well as LA end diastolic and systolic volume were also significantly higher in pig hearts post-operation when compared to baseline. Pathological changes were observed in the heart, which included scar tissue in the ischemic central area of the LV. Transmission electron microscopy highlighted the presence of contraction bands and edema surrounding the ischemia area, including inflammatory cell infiltration within the ischemic area. We have developed a pig model of IMR using the posterior mitral chordae tendineae rupture technique and implantation of an ameroid constrictor. The pathological features of this pig IMR model were found to mimic the natural history and progression of IMR in patients."
https://openalex.org/W2010945839,"An improved understanding of mosquito population dynamics under natural environmental forcing requires adequate field observations spanning the full range of temporal scales over which mosquito abundance fluctuates in natural conditions. Here we analyze a 9-year daily time series of uninterrupted observations of adult mosquito abundance for multiple mosquito species in North Carolina to identify characteristic scales of temporal variability, the processes generating them, and the representativeness of observations at different sampling resolutions. We focus in particular on Aedes vexans and Culiseta melanura and, using a combination of spectral analysis and modeling, we find significant population fluctuations with characteristic periodicity between 2 days and several years. Population dynamical modelling suggests that the observed fast fluctuations scales (2 days-weeks) are importantly affected by a varying mosquito activity in response to rapid changes in meteorological conditions, a process neglected in most representations of mosquito population dynamics. We further suggest that the range of time scales over which adult mosquito population variability takes place can be divided into three main parts. At small time scales (indicatively 2 days-1 month) observed population fluctuations are mainly driven by behavioral responses to rapid changes in weather conditions. At intermediate scales (1 to several month) environmentally-forced fluctuations in generation times, mortality rates, and density dependence determine the population characteristic response times. At longer scales (annual to multi-annual) mosquito populations follow seasonal and inter-annual environmental changes. We conclude that observations of adult mosquito populations should be based on a sub-weekly sampling frequency and that predictive models of mosquito abundance must include behavioral dynamics to separate the effects of a varying mosquito activity from actual changes in the abundance of the underlying population."

https://openalex.org/W2150720781,"Co-signaling molecules are responsible for full T-cell activation after solid organ transplantation. Their increased expression can lead to the release of a soluble form that can modulate the immune response post-transplantation. We analyzed the presence of co-signaling molecules (sCD30, sCD40, sCD137, sCTLA-4, sCD80, sCD28, sCD40L, sPD-1, and sPD-L1) in serum from kidney-transplanted patients (n = 59) obtained at different times (before transplantation, and 15 days, 3 months and 1 year post-transplantation) and their contribution to graft outcome was evaluated using principal component analysis. Before transplantation, high levels of soluble co-signaling molecules (mainly sCD30, sCD137 and sCD40) were detected in all patients. These molecules were modulated soon after receiving an allograft but never attained similar levels to those of healthy controls. A signature based on the determination of six soluble co-stimulatory (sCD30, sCD40, sCD137 and sCD40L) and co-inhibitory (sPD-1 and sPD-L1) molecules at 3 months post-transplantation allowed a group of patients to be identified (27.12%) with a worse long-term graft outcome. Patients with high levels of soluble molecules showed a progressive and gradual deterioration of kidney function (increased creatinine and proteinuria levels and decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate) over time and a higher risk of graft loss at 6 years post-transplantation than patients with low levels of these molecules (62.55% versus 5.14%, p<0.001). Thus, our data show an aberrant expression of soluble co-signaling molecules in kidney-transplanted patients whose quantification at 3 months post-transplantation might be a useful biomarker of immune status and help to predict long-term graft evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1978423267,"Thyroid transcription factor-1 (NKX2.1/TITF-1) is a member of the thyroid tissue-specific transcription factor family that has been proven to be closely associated with many human diseases. Recently, it was reported that NKX2.1 expression is lost or reduced in some human cancers such as lung cancer and thyroid cancer. However, there was insufficient data to suggest that NKX2.1 functionality could be used as a prognostic factor. Therefore, this study aims to investigate NKX2.1 expression and its prognostic significance in primary gastric carcinoma. Then, we attempted to investigate if NKX2.1 expression was related to the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of gastric carcinoma (GC)patients. The expression levels of NKX2.1 were analyzed in tissue samples from 205 gastric carcinoma patients by real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR), Western blotting, and immunohistochemical staining(IHC). Our qRT-PCR results showed that the expression of NKX2.1 mRNA was reduced in tumor tissue samples compared with that in matched adjacent non-tumor tissue samples (P < 0.001); this finding was confirmed by Western blot analysis (P < 0.001). Our immunohistochemical staining data indicated that NKX2.1 expression was significantly decreased in 87 of 205 (42.4%) gastric carcinoma cases. Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed that the decreased expression of NKX2.1 was significantly associated with poor prognosis in gastric carcinoma patients (P < 0.001). Multivariate Cox analysis identified NKX2.1 expression as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (P = 0.005). Furthermore, the functions of Nkx2.1 were analyzed with respect to the proliferation, migration, and invasion of GC cell lines. Our data suggest that NKX2.1 may function as a tumor suppressor in primary gastric carcinoma and that its reduced expression independently predicts an unsatisfactory prognosis in gastric carcinoma patients."
https://openalex.org/W2000394967,"Impaired kidney function is a significant health problem and a major concern in clinical routine and is routinely determined by decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR). In contrast to single assessment of a patients' kidney function providing only limited information on patients' health, serial measurements of GFR clearly improves the validity of diagnosis. The decline of kidney function has recently been reported to be predictive for mortality and vascular events in coronary patients. However, it has not been investigated for genetic association in GWA studies. This study investigates for the first time the association of cardiometabolic polymorphisms with the decline of estimated GFR during a 4 year follow up in 583 coronary patients, using the Cardio-Metabo Chip. We revealed a suggestive association with 3 polymorphisms, surpassing genome-wide significance (p = 4.0 e-7). The top hit rs17069906 (p = 5.6 e-10) is located within the genomic region of RANK, recently demonstrated to be an important player in the adaptive recovery response in podocytes and suggested as a promising therapeutic target in glomerular diseases."
