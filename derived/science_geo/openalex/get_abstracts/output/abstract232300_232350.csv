https://openalex.org/W2124076790,"A link between inflammation and cancer has long been suspected, but its molecular nature remained ill defined. A key player in inflammation is transcription factor NF-κB whose activity is triggered in response to infectious agents and proinflammatory cytokines via the IκB kinase (IKK) complex. Using a colitis-associated cancer model, we show that although deletion of IKKβ in intestinal epithelial cells does not decrease inflammation, it leads to a dramatic decrease in tumor incidence without affecting tumor size. This is linked to increased epithelial apoptosis during tumor promotion. Deleting IKKβ in myeloid cells, however, results in a significant decrease in tumor size. This deletion diminishes expression of proinflammatory cytokines that may serve as tumor growth factors, without affecting apoptosis. Thus, specific inactivation of the IKK/NF-κB pathway in two different cell types can attenuate formation of inflammation-associated tumors. In addition to suppressing apoptosis in advanced tumors, IKKβ may link inflammation to cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2146120613,"Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription is regulated primarily at the level of initiation from rRNA promoters. The unusual kinetic properties of these promoters result in their specific regulation by two small molecule signals, ppGpp and the initiating NTP, that bind to RNA polymerase (RNAP) at all promoters. We show here that DksA, a protein previously unsuspected as a transcription factor, is absolutely required for rRNA regulation. In ΔdksA mutants, rRNA promoters are unresponsive to changes in amino acid availability, growth rate, or growth phase. In vitro, DksA binds to RNAP, reduces open complex lifetime, inhibits rRNA promoter activity, and amplifies effects of ppGpp and the initiating NTP on rRNA transcription, explaining the dksA requirement in vivo. These results expand our molecular understanding of rRNA transcription regulation, may explain previously described pleiotropic effects of dksA, and illustrate how transcription factors that do not bind DNA can nevertheless potentiate RNAP for regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2086673994,"The G protein-coupled, receptor-activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase γ (PI3Kγ) mediates inflammatory responses and negatively controls cardiac contractility by reducing cAMP concentration. Here, we report that mice carrying a targeted mutation in the PI3Kγ gene causing loss of kinase activity (PI3KγKD/KD) display reduced inflammatory reactions but no alterations in cardiac contractility. We show that, in PI3KγKD/KD hearts, cAMP levels are normal and that PI3Kγ-deficient mice but not PI3KγKD/KD mice develop dramatic myocardial damage after chronic pressure overload induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Finally, our data indicate that PI3Kγ is an essential component of a complex controlling PDE3B phosphodiesterase-mediated cAMP destruction. Thus, cardiac PI3Kγ participates in two distinct signaling pathways: a kinase-dependent activity that controls PKB/Akt as well as MAPK phosphorylation and contributes to TAC-induced cardiac remodeling, and a kinase-independent activity that relies on protein interactions to regulate PDE3B activity and negatively modulates cardiac contractility."
https://openalex.org/W2023359102,"Bacterial transcription is regulated by the alarmone ppGpp, which binds near the catalytic site of RNA polymerase (RNAP) and modulates its activity. We show that the DksA protein is a crucial component of ppGpp-dependent regulation. The 2.0 A resolution structure of Escherichia coli DksA reveals a globular domain and a coiled coil with two highly conserved Asp residues at its tip that is reminiscent of the transcript cleavage factor GreA. This structural similarity suggests that DksA coiled coil protrudes into the RNAP secondary channel to coordinate a ppGpp bound Mg2+ ion with the Asp residues, thereby stabilizing the ppGpp-RNAP complex. Biochemical analysis demonstrates that DksA affects transcript elongation, albeit differently from GreA; augments ppGpp effects on initiation; and binds directly to RNAP, positioning the Asp residues near the active site. Substitution of these residues eliminates the synergy between DksA and ppGpp. Thus, the secondary channel emerges as a common regulatory entrance for transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W2110079579,"Perilipins, the major structural proteins coating the surfaces of mature lipid droplets of adipocytes, play an important role in the regulation of triacylglycerol storage and hydrolysis. We have used proteomic analysis to identify CGI-58, a member of the α/β-hydrolase fold family of enzymes, as a component of lipid droplets of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. CGI-58 mRNA is highly expressed in adipose tissue and testes, tissues that also express perilipins, and at lower levels in liver, skin, kidney, and heart. Both endogenous CGI-58 and an ectopic CGI-58-GFP chimera show diffuse cytoplasmic localization in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, but localize almost exclusively to the surfaces of lipid droplets in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The localization of endogenous CGI-58 was investigated in 3T3-L1 cells stably expressing mutated forms of perilipin using microscopy. CGI-58 binds to lipid droplets coated with perilipin A or mutated forms of perilipin with an intact C-terminal sequence from amino acid 382 to 429, but not to lipid droplets coated with perilipin B or mutated perilipin A lacking this sequence. Immunoprecipitation studies confirmed these findings, but also showed co-precipitation of perilipin B and CGI-58. Remarkably, activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase by the incubation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with isoproterenol and isobutylmethylxanthine disperses CGI-58 from the surfaces of lipid droplets to a cytoplasmic distribution. This shift in subcellular localization can be reversed by the addition of propanolol to the culture medium. Thus, CGI-58 binds to perilipin A-coated lipid droplets in a manner that is dependent upon the metabolic status of the adipocyte and the activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase.

Thus, CGI-58 binds to perilipin A-coated lipid droplets in a manner that is dependent upon the metabolic status of the adipocyte and the activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Lipid droplets, organelles that store neutral lipids, are found in nearly all types of eukaryotic cells. The most highly studied lipid droplet-associated proteins are members of the PAT 1The abbreviations used are: PAT, perilipin, adipophilin, and TIP47 family of proteins; GFP, green fluorescent protein; IBMX, isobutylmethylxanthine; Mega-8, octanoyl-N-methylglucamide; NLSD, neutral lipid storage disorder; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; TCEP, Tri(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride.

The members of the PAT family comprise the major structural proteins of lipid droplets. Studies in perilipin knockout mice have established an important role for perilipins in regulating lipolysis in adipocytes, and hence, controlling the mass of triacylglycerol deposited in adipose tissue (10Martinez-Botas J.

The mechanisms by which perilipins maintain control of adipocyte triacylglycerol metabolism are poorly understood, although recent mutagenesis studies have identified structural motifs important to perilipin function in triacylglycerol storage and lipolysis (12Garcia A.

An attractive model consistent with these data suggests that perilipins restrict the access of cytosolic lipases to triacylglycerol stored within lipid droplets, and thus suppress the rate of basal lipolysis under conditions when triacylglycerol storage is favored. When catecholamines activate β-adrenergic receptors, the resultant phosphorylation of perilipin A by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) on as many as six serines throughout the perilipin sequence facilitates the docking of hormone-sensitive lipase on lipid droplets (17Sztalryd C.

Here we report the identification of CGI-58 as a component of lipid droplets isolated from cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes (41Brasaemle D.L. Dolios G. Shapiro L. Wang R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; (August 27, 10.1074/jbcM409340200)Google Scholar). The name CGI-58 derives from a Comparative Gene Identification initiative that annotated 150 novel transcripts conserved between Caenorhabditis elegans and humans (22Lai C.H. Chou C.Y. Ch'ang L.Y. Liu C.S. Lin W. Genome. Res. 2000; 10: 703-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). CGI-58 is a member of the esterase, thioesterase, and lipase subfamily of α/β-hydrolase fold enzymes (23Lefevre C. Jobard F. Caux F. Bouadjar B. Karaduman A. Heilig R. Lakhdar H. Wollenberg A.

The protein sequence includes a highly conserved active site that, in most α/β-hydrolases, includes a nucleophilic serine residue known to be important in catalysis. Interestingly, the CGI-58 sequence encodes an asparagine in place of this catalytic serine (23Lefevre C. Jobard F. Caux F. Bouadjar B. Karaduman A. Heilig R. Lakhdar H. Wollenberg A. Verret J.L.

Significantly, eight different mutations in CGI-58 were recently identified as causative factors in Chanarin-Dorfman Syndrome (23Lefevre C. Jobard F. Caux F. Bouadjar B. Karaduman A. Heilig R.

Jobard F. Caux F. Bouadjar B. Karaduman A. Heilig R. Lakhdar H. Wollenberg A. Verret J.L. Weissenbach J. Ozguc M. Lathrop M. Prud'homme J.F. Fischer J. Am. J. Hum.

Nutr. 1997; 25: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The eight mutations known to lead to NLSD include truncations, null alleles, and three distinct point mutations. This suggests that the lipid storage phenotype of NLSD most likely arises from loss of function of CGI-58, leading to excessive storage of triacylglycerols in lipid droplets. In this study, we have investigated the tissue distribution of CGI-58 and characterized the localization of both endogenous CGI-58 and a CGI-58-green fluorescent protein (GFP) chimera in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and differentiated adipocytes. After finding extensive CGI-58 localization to lipid droplets in adipocytes but not preadipocytes, we investigated the interaction of CGI-58 with perilipin by studying 3T3-L1 preadipocytes stably expressing various mutated forms of perilipin A.

Identification of CGI-58 by Mass Spectrometric Analysis—The methods used for the isolation of lipid droplets and identification of proteins in lipid droplet preparations by mass spectrometry2 are previously described. Briefly, protein bands of interest were excised from Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels and destained. In gel reduction, alkylation, and trypsin digestion were carried out as described previously (27Dias D.C. Dolios G. Wang R. Pan Z.Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Tryptic peptides were analyzed by micro-HPLC-MS/MS analysis using an online MicroPro-HPLC system (Eldex Laboratories) coupled with a LCQ electrospray ionization trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan) operated in a data-dependent mode for measuring the molecular masses of parent peptides and collecting MS/MS peptide fragmentation spectra. The measured molecular masses of parent peptides and their MS/MS data were used to search the National Center for Biotechnology Information DNA/protein sequence databases using the program KNEXUS (Genomic Solutions). Expression of Recombinant CGI-58 and Production of Polyclonal Antisera in Rabbits—A murine CGI-58 cDNA was amplified out of a 3T3-L1 adipocyte cDNA library (kindly donated by Dr. Philipp Scherer, Albert Einstein College of Medicine) using oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the 5′ (5′-GACGGATCCAAAGCGATGGCGGCGGAGGAG-3′) and 3′ (5′-CGACGTCGACTCAGTCTACTGTGTGGCAGATC-3′) ends of the open reading frame of murine CGI-58 with added BamHI and SalI restriction sites, respectively, using the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Applied Science). The CGI-58 cDNA was subcloned into pSMT3, a bacterial expression vector encoding a 6-histidine tag and a SUMO moiety containing a Ulp1 cleavage site (28Mossessova E. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 865-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar) 5′ to the BamHI and SalI restriction sites, and in-frame with the CGI-58 coding sequence. The subcloned CGI-58 cDNA was sequenced to confirm fidelity of amplification. Bacteria expressing recombinant CGI-58 were solubilized in 500 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm Tri(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP), 10 mm octanoyl-N-methylglucamide (Mega-8; Anatrace, Maumee, OH), 10 mm Tris, pH 7.8 (Solution 1) with 5 mm imidazole, by probe sonication for 10 min on ice (15 s pulses every 45 s) followed by centrifugation in a Beckman Type 45 Ti rotor at 150,000 x g for 1 h. Supernatant was eluted over Ni-NTA agarose resin (Qiagen) packed into a XK16 low pressure FPLC column (Amersham Biosciences) with 250 mm imidazole in Solution 1. The eluted protein containing the recombinant CGI-58 was dialyzed against Solution 1 with simultaneous cleavage with Ulp1 protease (1:500 mass/mass) overnight at 4 °C, prior to elution three times over BD Talon Superflow Cobalt resin in Solution 1. Proteins were dialyzed against 150 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm TCEP, 10 mm Mega-8, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.8 (Solution 2) prior to elution over a Mono Q HR 10/10 anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) with 1 m sodium chloride, 1 mm TCEP, 10 mm Mega-8, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.8. Fractions containing recombinant CGI-58 were then dialyzed against Solution 2 prior to elution over a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences) in Solution 2. A single protein band of ∼39 kDa was observed on Coomassie Blue-stained gels from SDS-PAGE; this protein was used to immunize two rabbits to raise polyclonal antisera against murine CGI-58 (Covance Research Products, Denver, PA). Stable Expression of CGI-58-GFP Chimeras in 3T3-L1 Cells—A murine CGI-58 cDNA was amplified out of the 3T3-L1 adipocyte library using oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the 5′-coding sequence lacking the first 6 amino acids (5′-GCTCTAGAGAGGAGGTGGACTCGGCAG-3′) and 3′-coding and non-coding sequences including the stop codon (5′-GCTCTAGAGGTTCTGTGTGCTCAGTCTAC-3′) with added XbaI restriction sites using the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Applied Science). The CGI-58 cDNA was subcloned into the unique XbaI site of the pSRαMSVtkneo-GFP retroviral expression vector (12Garcia A. Sekowski A. Subramanian V. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 625-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) to express CGI-58 with an N-terminal fused GFP. An additional GFP-CGI-58 fusion retroviral expression construct was produced by amplifying the entire coding sequence of CGI-58, including the first six amino acids using 5′ (5′-GCATCTCGAGTGAAAGCGATGGCGGCGGAGGAG-3′) and 3′ (5′-GCATGGATCCTCAGTCTACTGTGTGGCAGATCTC-3′) oligonucleotide primers containing XhoI and BamHI restriction sites, respectively, the full-length CGI-58 cDNA in the pSMT3 vector as a template, and Pfu polymerase, and subcloning the product into the pLEGFP-C1 retroviral expression vector (Clontech; BD Biosciences), to express CGI-58 with an N-terminal-fused GFP. Fidelity of amplification was confirmed by sequencing. Ecotropic retroviral stocks were produced in transfected 293T cells as described previously (26Brasaemle D.L. Rubin B. Harten I.A. Gruia-Gray J.

https://openalex.org/W1994684691,"The efficacy of synaptic transmission between neurons can be altered transiently during neuronal network activity. This phenomenon of short-term plasticity is a key determinant of network properties; is involved in many physiological processes such as motor control, sound localization, or sensory adaptation; and is critically dependent on cytosolic [Ca2+]. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms and the identity of the Ca2+ sensor/effector complexes involved are unclear. We now identify a conserved calmodulin binding site in UNC-13/Munc13s, which are essential regulators of synaptic vesicle priming and synaptic efficacy. Ca2+ sensor/effector complexes consisting of calmodulin and Munc13s regulate synaptic vesicle priming and synaptic efficacy in response to a residual [Ca2+] signal and thus shape short-term plasticity characteristics during periods of sustained synaptic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2076223951,"The Runt domain transcription factor Runx2 (AML-3, and Cbfa1) is essential for osteoblast development, differentiation, and bone formation. Runx2 positively or negatively regulates osteoblast gene expression by interacting with a variety of transcription cofactor complexes. In this study, we identified a trichostatin A-sensitive autonomous repression domain in the amino terminus of Runx2. Using a candidate approach, we found that histone deacetylase (HDAC) 3 interacts with the amino terminus of Runx2. In transient transfection assays, HDAC3 repressed Runx2-mediated activation of the osteocalcin promoter. HDAC inhibitors and HDAC3-specific short hairpin RNAs reversed this repression. In vivo, Runx2 and HDAC3 associated with the osteocalcin promoter. These data indicate that HDAC3 regulates Runx2-mediated transcription of osteoblast genes. Suppression of HDAC3 in MC3T3 preosteoblasts by RNA interference accelerated the expression of Runx2 target genes, osteocalcin, osteopontin, and bone sialoprotein but did not significantly alter Runx2 levels. Matrix mineralization also occurred earlier in HDAC3-suppressed cells, but alkaline phosphatase expression was not affected. Thus, HDAC3 regulates osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. Although HDAC3 is likely to affect the activity of multiple proteins in osteoblasts, our data show that it actively regulates the transcriptional activity of the osteoblast master protein, Runx2.

Biol. 2001; 21: 6091-6101Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), which link HDAC3 to transcription factors and other co-repressors. HDAC3 is also the crucial catalytic component of several class II HDAC complexes (57Fischle W. Dequiedt F. Fillon M. Hendzel M.J. Voelter W. Verdin E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5826-5835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 58Fischle W. Dequiedt F. Hendzel M.J. Guenther M.G. Lazar M.A. Verdin E. Mol.

Thus, HDAC3 appears to be a very important factor in multiple co-repressor complexes that regulate gene expression. HDAC3-deficient animals have not been described; however, HDAC3 suppression in HeLa cells by RNA interference blocked cell proliferation and transcriptional repression by thyroid hormone receptor (59Glaser K.

Biol. 2003; 23: 5122-5131Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified HDAC3 as a transcriptional co-repressor of Runx2 using a candidate gene approach. HDAC3 interacted with the amino terminus of Runx2, which acts as an autonomous repression domain on a heterologous promoter. HDAC3 repressed Runx2-induced activation of the osteocalcin promoter and was found associated with the osteocalcin promoter in osteoblasts. Stable suppression of HDAC3 by RNA interference accelerated osteoblast mineralization and the expression of osteoblast differentiation genes. These data identify HDAC3 as a regulator of Runx2 transcriptional activity in osseous cells and suggest that its expression regulates bone formation. Cell Culture—COS and C2C12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 200 mml-glutamine, 50 units/ml of penicillin and 50 μg/ml of streptomycin. CH310T1/2, MC3T3-E1, ROS17/2.8, and UMR-106 were maintained in minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% nonessential amino acids, 200 mml-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. To induce differentiation, confluent MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured in α-MEM containing 10% FBS, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid, and 10 mm β-glycerolphosphate. The differentiation medium was replaced every 3 days. Plasmids—The GAL-TK-luciferase (Luc) reporter plasmid and the GAL-Runx2 fusion proteins were previously described (18Westendorf J.J. Zaidi S.K. Cascino J.E. Kahler R. van Wijnen A.J. Lian J.B. Yoshida M. Stein G.S. Li X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7982-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Human and mouse HDAC3 mammalian expression vectors were kindly provided by Dr. Edward Seto (Lee Moffit Cancer Center, Tampa, FL) (61Yang W.-M. Yao Y.-L. Sun J.-M. Davie J.R. Seto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28001-28007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The pSHAG and pSHAG-Firefly luciferase (Ffl) vectors were obtained from Dr. Gregory Hannon (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories) (62Paddison P.J. Caudy A.A. Bernstein E. Hannon G.J. Conklin D.S. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 948-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). The pSHAG-HDAC3 short-hairpin RNA vectors were constructed by annealing oligonucleotide pairs (purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Coralville, IA) and subcloning them into the BamHI/BseRI sites of the pSHAG vector. HDAC3 shRNA #1 recognizes bases pairs 681-713 of the murine HDAC3 cDNA. The sequences of its oligonucleotide pair are: 5′-TGCTTGTAACTCTGGTCATCAATGCCATGAAGCTTGATGGTATTGATGATCAGAGTTATAAGCATCTTTTTTT-3′ and 5′-GATCAAAAAAAGATGCTTATAACTCTGATCATCAATACCATCAAGCTTCATGGCATTGATGACCAGAGTTACAAGCACG-3′. HDAC3 shRNA #2 recognizes bases pairs 1231-1263 of the murine HDAC3 cDNA. The sequences of its oligonucleotide pair are: 5′-GTCGCCATCATAGAACTCATTGGGTGCTGAAGCTTGAGTATCCGATGAGTTCTATGATGGCGACTATTTTTTT-3′ and 5′-GATCAAAAAAATAGTCGCCATCATAGAACTCATCGGATACTCAAGCTTCAGCACCCAATGAGTTCTATGATGGCGACCG-3′. The self-inactivating (SIN) retrovirus was created from a murine stem cell virus (MSCV) expression plasmid, by removing the XbaI/NheI fragment from the 3′ long terminal repeat of the vector, pMSCV-Puro-HpaI-Gateway (a gift from Dr. Gregory Hannon (63Hemann M.T. Fridman J.S. Zilfou J.T. Hernando E. Paddison P.J. Cordon-Cardo C. Hannon G.J. Lowe S.W. Nature. 2003; 33: 396-400Google Scholar)). Short-hairpin RNAs recognizing Ffl or HDAC3 were transferred from pSHAG vectors into the pSIN-MSCV-puro-HpaI-Gateway vector with the Gateway cloning system (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmids are referred to as pSIN-MSCV-Ffl shRNA and pSIN-MSCV-HDAC3 shRNA. Creation of Stable Cell Lines—Retroviruses were produced as previously described (64Koka S. Neudauer C.L. Li X. Lewis R.E. McCarthy J.B. Westendorf J.J. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1745-1755Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T cells were co-transfected with 20 μg of pSIN-MSCV-shRNA vector and 20 μg of the helper plasmid pCL2 by calcium phosphate precipitation. At 24 and 48 h, supernatants were collected, passed through a 0.45-μm filter and stored at -80 °C. MC3T3 cells were transduced with 1 ml of viral supernatant in the presence of 8 μg/ml polybrene on two consecutive days. Transduced cells were selected by culturing in the presence of 10 μg/ml puromycin for 3 days. Antibodies—The polyclonal antibodies recognizing HDAC3 or HDAC4 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA). The polyclonal anti-Runx2 antibodies, S19 (N terminus) and C19 (C terminus) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The polyclonal anti-AML3 antibody was provided by Dr. Scott Hiebert. The monoclonal anti-HA and polyclonal anti-FLAG antibodies were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (St. Louis, MO). The monoclonal anti-β-catenin antiserum was purchased from BD Biosciences Transduction Laboratories. The FHOD1 antiserum was previously described (64Koka S. Neudauer C.L. Li X. Lewis R.E. McCarthy J.B. Westendorf J.J. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1745-1755Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Transcription Assays—COS and C3H10T1/2 cells were transiently transfected with the murine osteocalcin gene 2 (mOG2)-Luc reporter plasmid, pCMV-secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP), pCMV-Runx2 and pCMV-FLAG-HDAC3, and pSHAG-shRNA using DEAE-dextran or LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen), respectively. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with the GAL-TK-Luc reporter plasmid and GAL-Runx2 plasmids with Superfect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Luciferase activity was measured 40 h post-transfection with a luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). SEAP activity was measured as previously described (18Westendorf J.J. Zaidi S.K. Cascino J.E. Kahler R. van Wijnen A.J. Lian J.B. Yoshida M. Stein G.S. Li X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7982-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 65Berger J. Hauber J. Hauber R. Geiger R. Cullen B.R. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 66: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Luciferase values were normalized with SEAP values to control for transfection efficiency. The fold changes in activation or repression were calculated relative to samples transfected with mOG2-Luc or GAL-TK-Luc alone. Trichostatin A (TSA, Sigma) and cyclic hydroxamic acid-containing peptide 31 (CHAP31, kindly provided by Minoru Yoshida of The University of Tokyo) were added 24 h post-transfection. Immunoprecipitations and Immunoblots—ROS17/2.8 cells were lysed on ice by resuspension in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 25 mm MG132, and protease inhibitors (Mini Complete protease inhibitor mixture tablets from Roche Applied Science)). After sonication, lysates were precleared by 30-min incubations with prewashed pansorbin cells (Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp.) at 4 °C and high speed centrifugation. Lysates were then incubated with nonspecific rabbit IgG (Rockland), HDAC3 (Cell Signaling), or Runx2 antibodies (C19, S19, and AML3) as indicated for 16 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected with Protein A-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 25 μm MG132, and protease inhibitors (Mini Complete protease inhibitor mixture tablets). Proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in 2× Laemmli sample buffer for 5 min, resolved by SDS-8% PAGE, transferred to Immobilon P (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and detected by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence. COS cells were transfected with pCMV5-M2-Runx2-(1-227) and pCMV5-FLAG-HDAC (HDACs 1-6) using DEAE-dextran. The lysates were harvested and incubated with anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity beads (Sigma) as previously described (18Westendorf J.J. Zaidi S.K. Cascino J.E. Kahler R. van Wijnen A.J. Lian J.B. Yoshida M. Stein G.S. Li X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7982-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). After incubation, the beads were washed, and proteins bound to the beads were resolved by SDS-10% PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-GAL (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-FLAG (Sigma) antibodies. GST Pull-down Assays—GST and GST-Runx1 or Runx2 fusion proteins were produced in DH5α Escherichia coli and extracted with a lysis buffer containing 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors (Mini Complete protease inhibitor mixture tablets, Roche Applied Science). Lysates were sonicated on ice and cleared by centrifugation. GST proteins were purified by incubating E. coli lysates with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. HDAC3 proteins were in vitro transcribed and translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Promega) with 35S-labeled amino acids (Tran35S-label, ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Irvine, CA) from pBlue-script-HDAC3 according to the manufacturer's instructions. GST proteins and radiolabeled murine HDAC3 were mixed and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C, washed three times with lysis buffer, resolved by SDS-12% PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed in ROS17/2.8 cells as previously reported (66Shen J. Montecino M. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20284-20292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, cross-linked lysates were immunoprecipitated with no antibody, anti-HA (12CA5), Runx2 (S19 and C19), or HDAC3 antibodies. An additional control reaction (mock) contained no chromatin or antibody. Nested PCR was performed with primer pairs generated to detect bases encompassing the proximal Runx2 binding site in the rat osteocalcin promoter. External primer pairs for PCR were: 5′-GGATCTTATGGAGGCATTTTC-3′ and 5′-CCAAAGGATGCTGTGGTTGG-3′. The internal primer pairs for the nested PCR were: 5′-GAGGCTTTCTTCTTTCAAGTT-3′ and 5′-TGGGCAAAGGCCTGGAAGG-3′. cDNA Synthesis and Reverse Transcription PCR—Total RNA from MC3T3 cells stably expressing Ffl and HDAC3 shRNAs was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed to cDNA with the Invitrogen Superscript kit according to its instructions. PCR was performed on the cDNA using primers specific for HDAC3 (5′-CGGGTGCTCTACATTGATATCGACATCCAC-3′ and 5′-TACCAGGAGAGGGATATTGAAACTCTTGAC-3′), Runx2 (5′-ATGGATCCATATGCTACCTGCCATCAC-3′ and 5′-TAGAATTCATTAAACAGTTGGGGAACT-3′), and actin (5′-GACTTCGAGCAAGAGATGGCCAC-3′ and 5′-CAATGCCAGGGTACATGGTGGTG-3′). Quantitative Real-time PCR—cDNA was prepared as described above. Real-time PCR was carried out in a Lightcycler (Roche Diagnostics) using the following primer sets: HDAC3 (5′-CGGGTGCTCTACATTGATATCGACATCCAC-3′ and 5′-TACCAGGAGAGGGATATTGAAACTCTTGAC-3′), osteocalcin (5′-CTCTGTCTCTCTGACCTCACAG-3′ and 5′-GGAGCTGCTGTGACATCCATAC-3′), osteopontin (5′-TGACCCATCTCAGAAGCAG-3′ and 5′-GCTGACTTGACTCATGGCT-3′), bone sialoprotein (5′-GAAACGGTTTCCAGTCCAG-3′ and 5′-CTGCATCTCCAGCCTTCTT-3′), and actin (5′-AAGGAAGGCTGGAAAAGAGC-3′ and 5′-GCTACAGCTTCACCACCACA-3′). HDAC3, osteopontin, bone sialoprotein, and actin were amplified by adding 1 μl of cDNA diluted 1:10 to the PCR mixture (19 μl) containing each of the primers (0.5 μm), 1.25 mm MgCl2, and 10 μl of the SYBR Green Taq ReadyMix (Sigma-Aldrich Co.). The enzyme was activated at 95 °C for 5 min prior to the start of cycling. The PCR program contained 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 10 s, annealing of the primers at 56 °C for 10 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 10 s. Osteocalcin and actin were amplified by adding 2 μl of cDNA diluted 1:10 to the PCR mixture (18 μl) containing each of the primers (0.5 μm), 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10 μl of the Platinum SYBR Green qPCR Supermix uracil glycosylase (Invitrogen). Prior to cycling, the reactions were preincubated at 50 °C for 2 min for decontamination of dU-containing DNA by UDG, then at 95 °C to inactivate UDG and activate Taq. The PCR program was the same as described above. For all reactions, the temperature change rate was 20 C°/s for denaturation, annealing, and elongation. Fluorescence was measured at channel F1 at the end of each elongation cycle. Relative quantification of gene expression was determined by using the 2-ΔΔCT method where fold change in gene expression is relative to Day 0 Ffl shRNA samples (67Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124738) Google Scholar). All samples were normalized to actin. Differentiation Assays—To assess alkaline phosphatase production, differentiating MC3T3-E1 cells were stained at the indicated times in a buffer containing 100 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm MgCl2, 337.5 mg/ml nitroblue tetrazolium, and 175 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate tolidium salt. Ca2+ accumulation in the matrix was detected by staining the differentiating cell cultures with 40 mm Alizarin Red for 10 min (LabChem Inc., Pittsburgh, PA), washing with distilled water and developing in phosphate-buffered saline. The Amino Terminus of Runx2 Acts as an Autonomous Repression Domain That Is Sensitive to the HDAC Inhibitor, TSA—We previously showed that Runx2 contains multiple repression domains (18Westendorf J.J.

https://openalex.org/W2133742333,"Mammalian cells concentrate Golgi membranes around the centrosome in a microtubule-dependent manner. The mechanisms involved in generating a single Golgi ribbon in the periphery of the centrosome remain unknown. Here we show that GMAP-210, a cis-Golgi microtubule binding protein, recruits γ-tubulin-containing complexes to Golgi membranes even in conditions where microtubule polymerization is prevented and independently of Golgi apparatus localization within the cell. Under overexpression conditions, very short microtubules, or tubulin oligomers, are stabilized on Golgi membranes. GMAP-210 depletion by RNA interference results in extensive fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus, supporting a role for GMAP-210 in Golgi ribbon formation. Targeting of GMAP-210 or its C terminus to mitochondria induces the recruitment of γ-tubulin to their surface and redistribution of mitochondria to a pericentrosomal location. All our experiments suggest that GMAP-210 displays microtubule anchoring and membrane fusion activities, thus contributing to the assembly and maintenance of the Golgi ribbon around the centrosome."

Virus Res. 2003; 91: 1-161Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 2Sobrino F. Domingo E. Foot-and-Mouth Disease. Horizon Press, London2004Google Scholar). The cost of the FMD outbreak that took place in 2001 in the United Kingdom has been evaluated in 6 billion pounds sterling (3Thompson D. Muriel P. Russell D. Osborne P. Bromley A. Rowland M. Creigh-Tyte S. Brown C. Rev. Sci. Tech. Off. Int. Epiz. 2002; 21: 675-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), and it has been estimated that a large FMD outbreak in northern Europe or the United States would entail losses exceeding 100 billion dollars (4Knowles N.J. Samuel A.R. Virus Res. 2003; 91: 65-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Probably its most devastating effects are felt in underdeveloped countries because of the severe trade restrictions imposed by the disease (5Sutmoller P. Barteling S.S. Olascoaga R.C. Sumption K.J. Virus Res. 2003; 91: 101-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Difficulties for the control of FMD stem from the wide host range of FMDV, variability in pathogenic manifestations, antigenic diversity, high infectivity and transmissibility, capacity to establish persistent, asymptomatic infection affecting farm ruminants and also wildlife species, and the limited efficacy of current vaccines (1Rowlands D.J. Virus Res. 2003; 91: 1-161Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 2Sobrino F. Domingo E. Foot-and-Mouth Disease. Horizon Press, London2004Google Scholar). Some of these difficulties have their origin in a basic feature of FMDV biology, namely the error-prone nature of FMDV RNA replication, determined by the limited template copying fidelity of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) 3D (6Domingo E. Baranowski E. Escarmís C. Sobrino F. Holland J.J. Semler B.L. Wimmer E. Molecular Biology of Picornaviruses. ASM, Washington, D. C.2002: 285-298Google Scholar). To understand FMDV RNA synthesis at the molecular level, to interpret the copying-fidelity properties of the replication machinery, and to design antiviral compounds against FMD as a potential new approach to control the disease, a knowledge of the structure of the polymerase 3D is essential.Here, we report the structure of the RDRP of FMDV in a free form at 1.9-Å resolution and in complex with a template-primer RNA decanucleotide at 3.0-Å resolution. These structures represent the first complete three-dimensional structure of a picornavirus polymerase and provide new insights into the structural basis for the FMDV 3D function and the structure-based design of antiviral compounds against an important group of animal pathogens.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning of FMDV C-S8c1 3D Polymerase in Plasmid pET-28a—The genomic region coding for the 3D polymerase of FMDV was amplified by PCR from the infectious plasmid pMT28, 2García-Arriaza, J., Manrubia, S. C., Toja, M., Domingo, E., and Escarmís, C. (2004) J. Virol. 78, in press. containing a complete copy of the genome of our standard FMDV C-S8c1, and cloned in plasmid pET-28a (Novagen). An NcoI restriction site present in the 3D coding region was eliminated to allow this restriction site to be used for cloning. For this purpose, two amplifications were prepared: the region between positions 6610 and 6953 (numbering of genomic residues as in Ref. 7Escarmís C. Dávila M. Charpentier N. Bracho A. Moya A. Domingo E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 255-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) was amplified using a sense primer spanning residues 6610–6631 and an antisense primer complementary to nucleotides 6953–6929. The sense primer contained an initiating AUG preceding the 3D coding sequence and a NcoI restriction sequence upstream of the AUG. The antisense primer had the mutation G6939 → A to eliminate the NcoI internal restriction site without affecting the amino acid sequence of the protein. The second amplicon was obtained by primers spanning residues 6925–6947 (sense) containing the mutation C6939 → T, and 8019–7998 (antisense), which included the restriction sequence for NotI after the last codon. These two amplicons were shuffled in vitro in the presence of the sense primer of the first amplicon and the antisense primer of the second amplicon, and PfuI DNA polymerase. After phenol extraction the recombined DNA was digested with NcoI and NotI, the fragment obtained was purified by electrophoresis through agarose gel and ligated to the vector (pET28a) digested with the same enzymes. The ligation product was used to transform Escherichia coli BL21, and the plasmid of a positive colony was sequenced to confirm that it contained the expected 3D sequence.Expression and Purification of Recombinant 3D Polymerase—Plasmid pET-28a provided a tract of AAALE and 6 histidines at the carboxyl terminus of the protein. Kanamycin-resistant colonies were grown in L broth medium until an OD of 0.8–1 at 595 nm was reached. Then isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm and the culture grown for two additional hours. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 15 min and then kept at -20 °C. For lysis, the cells were suspended in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, 0.3 m NaCl and incubated with 20 mg/ml lysozyme for 15 min in the presence of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were then sonicated for 5 cycles of 30 s alternating with 5 cycles of 30 s in ice. Cellular debris was pelleted and the supernatant was loaded on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column. Elution was carried out with an imidazol gradient (50 to 500 mm)in50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, 0.5 m NaCl. Fractions of 2 ml were collected and analyzed for the presence of the protein. Fractions containing the protein were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol and stored in aliquots at -20 °C. The enzyme was >95% pure, its specific activity was 199 pmol of UTP incorporated/min per μg of protein (Table I) and the activity was inhibited specifically by monoclonal antibodies directed to FMDV 3D. An additional chromatographic step was performed before the crystallization trials on a size exclusion Superdex 200 HR column (Amersham Biosciences). Preparation of seleniomethionine-labeled 3D polymerase was carried out as described above except that the E. coli harboring the plasmid containing 3D was grown in a minimal medium lacking methionine and supplemented with seleniomethionine (8Budisa N.

The reaction was plotted onto a DE81 filter (Whatman) and the UTP not incorporated was cleared as previously described (24Gohara D.W. Crotty S. Arnold J.J. Yoder J.D. Andino R. Cameron C.E. J. Biol.

Radioactivity incorporated was measured both by a scintillation counter and by phosphoimager analysis (BAS1500) carrying out a radioactive marker in parallel Open table in a new tab Crystallization, Data Collection, and Processing—FMDV 3D proteins, both the native form and the seleniomethionine derivative used for the structure determination, were crystallized using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at room temperature. Typically 4 μl of protein solution (4.6 mg/ml) in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 8% glycerol were mixed with an equal volume of a reservoir solution. Tetragonal crystals, space group P41212(a = b = 93.04 Å, c = 119.05 Å), were obtained in 35% PEG 4K, 0.2 m sodium acetate, 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.6, and 4% γ-butirolactone.The 3D-RNA complex was obtained and crystallized as follows. The oligonucleotide r5′-GCAUGGGCCC-3′ (NWG-Biotech) was annealed following the procedure described in Ref. 9Arnold J.J. Cameron C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5329-5336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar. Briefly, 8 nmol of the oligonucleotide was heated to 90 °C for 1 min and slowly cooled to 10 °C at a rate of ∼5 °C/min. Then the 3D polymerase was slowly added in an equimolar proportion in the presence of 2 mm MgCl2. The crystallization trials were performed by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Trigonal P3221 crystals (a = b = 94.07 Å, c = 102.89 Å) were obtained with 30% PEG 4K, 0.2 m magnesium acetate and sodium cacodylate, pH 6.0.X-ray data of native and seleniomethionine-3D crystals were collected at the synchrotron beamlines ID13 and ID29, respectively (ESRF, Grenoble, France). Three data sets were recorded at 100 K from a single seleniomethionine crystal at wavelengths corresponding to the selenium absorption maximum, inflection point, and a hard remote (Table II). For the 3D-RNA crystals, data were collected at 100 K at beamline ID13 (ESRF) to 3.0-Å resolution. All data were processed and reduced using the DENZO/SCALEPACK package (10Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Local scaling, Patterson searches, and phasing calculations were performed using SOLVE (11Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar). All 14 selenium atoms predicted from the amino acid sequence were located from Patterson searches. Phase improvement in RESOLVE (12Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 13Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) allowed an automatic tracing of 320 residues of the 476 total residues. The initial model was manually rebuilt using TURBO (14Roussel A. Cambillau C. Turbo-Frodo, Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1989: 77-79Google Scholar) and refined with CNS (15Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16930) Google Scholar) against a wavelength-merged data set. The structure built from the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion data was further refined against the 1.9-Å data from native crystals using CNS. Additional rounds of manual rebuilding and refinement produced the present model containing the whole protein molecule, plus the five amino acid linker residues and two of the His6 tag at the COOH terminus that participates in crystal contacts, and 237 water molecules. The refinement converged to an R-factor of 20.2% (Rfree = 24.1%) with 90% of the residues lying in the most favored regions in the Ramachandran plot (Table II).The structure of the FMDV 3D in complex with the template-primer RNA was solved by molecular replacement with AMoRe (16Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1367-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) using the native 3D protein as starting model. The initial maps clearly showed the presence of extra density that would correspond to the RNA molecule. This electron density was well defined for a 5′ overhang region in particular C2A3U4 of the template strand plus the four following base pairs (G5 to C9 and their complementary G16 to C20 residues), but weakened toward the 3′ end. Refinement and manual model correction proceeded as for the native crystal. The final model, refined to 3.0-Å resolution, included 476 protein residues, 23 solvent molecules, one Mg2+ ion, and the region: 5′-CAUGGGCC-3′ of the template plus the complementary 3′-CCCGG-5′ stretch of the primer RNA oligonucleotide (Table II).RESULTSOverall Structure of the FMDV 3D Polymerase in Its Free and RNA-bound Forms—Crystals of recombinant 3D polymerase of FMDV were obtained and analyzed by x-ray crystallography both isolated and in complex with a self-annealing RNA decanucleotide in the presence of Mg2+. The structure of the unliganded FMDV 3D polymerase was determined by multiwavelength anomalous dispersion of seleniomethionated protein and the structure of FMDV 3D-RNA complex was solved by molecular replacement using the isolated 3D structure as starting model.The 476 residues of the polypeptide chain (including part of the COOH-terminal His tag) fold in 17 α-helices and 16 β-strands that form the canonical structure of a right hand with the “fingers,” “palm,” and “thumb” subdomains as seen in the three-dimensional structure of most other polynucleotide polymerases (17Steitz T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17395-17398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). In addition, there is an NH2-terminal segment (residues 1–96) bridging the fingers and the thumb subdomain that encircles the active site of the enzyme (Fig. 1, A and B). This region, also termed the fingertips, seems to be unique to the RDRP compared with other classes of nucleic acid polymerases (18Cameron C.E. Gohara D.W. Arnold J.J. Semler B.L. Wimmer E. Molecular Biology of Picornaviruses. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2002: 255-267Google Scholar, 19Bruenn J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1821-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar).The free and RNA-bound structures are in excellent agreement. The root mean square deviation of the superimposition of all 476 amino acid residues, carried out with the program SHP (20Stuart D.I. Levine M. Muirhead H. Stammers D.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 134: 109-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), is only 0.5 Å, showing that no important rearrangements of the 3D polymerase conformation were induced by the RNA binding.The Conserved Structural Motifs of the Palm Subdomain— The palm subdomain residues consist of a three-stranded β-sheet (β8, β11, and β12) sandwiched between helices α11 and α12 and followed by a pair of β-strands (β14, β15) that form an interface with the mostly helical thumb (Fig. 1A). The architecture of this region is the most highly conserved feature of all known polymerases (21O'Reilly E.K. Kao C.C. Virology. 1998; 252: 287-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). It is composed of five conserved motifs A to E, involved in nucleotide binding, phosphoryl transfer, structural integrity of the palm subdomain, and priming nucleotide binding, respectively (18Cameron C.E. Gohara D.W. Arnold J.J. Semler B.L. Wimmer E. Molecular Biology of Picornaviruses. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2002: 255-267Google Scholar) (Figs. 1A and 2). Strand β8 contains the conserved acidic residues Asp240 and Asp245 and forms motif A. The aphthovirus RDRP has an additional acidic residue within this region (Asp238). In the structure of the complex, the side chain of Asp238 is reoriented toward the active site close to the catalytic aspartic acid residues 338 and 339 of motif C (Fig. 3, A and B). Motif C (the β11-turn-β12 structure) contains the sequence GDD (Gly337-Asp338-Asp339), almost universally conserved in RDRPs. Metal ions that are likely to be involved in the nucleotidyl transfer reaction interact with these aspartate residues. In the structure of the FMDV 3D-RNA complex that was obtained in absence of NTP, only one Mg2+ ion was located at a site ∼6 Å from the expected catalytic positions. This finding is similar to that reported in the structure of the RDRP of bacteriophage φ6 crystallized in the absence of an incoming nucleotide (22Butcher S.J. Grimes J.M. Makeyev E.V. Bamford D.H. Stuart D.I. Nature. 2001; 410: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Both ions occupied similar sites. In FMDV 3D, the Mg2+ coordinates the Oδ atoms of Asp238 and Asp240 (motif A), Asp339 (motif C), and the carboxylate oxygen atoms of Val239, Ile340, and Thr384 (Figs. 1C and 3B).Fig. 2Structure based sequence alignment of the four ssRDRPs of known structure. The strictly conserved residues are in red blocks and similar residues in blue boxes. Secondary structure definitions for FMDV 3D are above the sequence alignment and the conserved sequence motifs are marked by bars below the sequences. Motif A is colored red; B, green; C, yellow; D, magenta; E, gray; and F, orange. Catalytic aspartates are marked by blue spheres, residues interacting with the RNA in the FMDV 3D complex are marked by green triangles and residues predicted to interact with the incoming NTP substrate by yellow squares. Despite FMDV RDRP sharing only 29% of sequence identity with PV polymerase and about 12% identity with caliciviral RDRPs, the RNA interacting residues are highly conserved. The amino acids that are in contact, either with the template-primer or the incoming NTP, showed 69% of identity with PV polymerase and about 50% with the calicivirus enzymes. The charged amino acids interacting with the template-primer or with the NTP substrate are conserved in 88% for PV RDRP and about 60% for calicivirus polymerases.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 3Electron density maps around the FMDV 3D active site.

Asn307 in motif B is conserved in all picornavirus and also in hepatitis C virus RDRPs. It has been described that this residue, together with Asp245 in motif A would be important for rNTP selection (23Hansen J. Long A.M. Schultz S. Structure. 1997; 15: 1109-1122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 24Gohara D.W. Crotty S. Arnold J.J. Yoder J.D. Andino R. Cameron C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25523-25532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) (see “NTP Site” section).Strands β14 and β15 are located at the junction between the palm and the thumb subdomains and form the structural motif E (Fig. 1A). In the structure of HIV-RT, the residues immediately following motif E act as a pivot point for the thumb subdomain movement upon template-primer binding (25Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). The comparison of the FMDV 3D in its free and RNA-bound forms shows that no domain movements are required in FMDV 3D to accommodate the template-primer RNA.Interactions of the Complex 3D-RNA Template-Primer—The RNA decanucleotide used in the co-crystallization work was originally designed for the analysis of the kinetics and mechanism of nucleotide incorporation by the poliovirus 3D polymerase (9Arnold J.J. Cameron C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5329-5336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This RNA sym/sub decanucleotide (sequence 5′-GCAUGGGCCC-3′) is able to form a 6-base pair duplex flanked by two, 4-nucleotide 5′ overhangs and can act as both RNA template and primer.The final refined electron density (Fig. 3B) was clear for residues, from C2 to C9 of the template strand plus the complementary G16 to C20 stretch of the primer strand. Density for the last base pairs was too weak and these residues were not included in the final model. The 5′ template overhang binds in a deep groove, with a moderately positive charge, which extends across the face of the fingers domain toward the active site cleft, making numerous interactions with residues on the NH2 terminus and fingers (Figs. 1C and 4). The nucleotide bases A3 and U4 pack against the solvent exposed hydrophobic residues Val181 and Phe162. The presence of a hydrophobic amino acid at these positions is a conserved feature of RDRPs in picornaviruses. In addition, Asp165 is hydrogen bonded to atom N6 of the adenine and the amino group of the Lys164 side chain contacts the uridine atom O4. The basic side chains Arg17, Lys20, and Arg128, mostly conserved in picornaviral RDRPs, and Thr115 are hydrogen bonded to the phosphodiester backbone of A3 and U4 driving the single-stranded RNA toward the active site cavity. In the unbound 3D structure this groove is filled with water molecules that mimic the oxygen atoms of the phosphodiester backbone of the template.Fig. 4Interactions between the FMDV 3D and its template-primer and NTP substrates. A schematic diagram of the template-primer-nucleotide chains, indicating the amino acid residues seen in contact with the RNA in the structure, yellow (template chain) and green (primer chain), and with the modeled ATP molecule (red). Residues making polar interactions with substrates are highlighted in red and those involved in hydrophobic contacts in black. The model of the ATP bound to the active site was obtained by comparison of the HIV-RT/dsDNA and φ6/ssDNA models with the FMDV 3D-template-primer complex. The two putative Mg2+ ions are highlighted in blue. Polar interactions were considered when distances were shorter that 3.5 Å.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The structural superimpositions of the five conserved motifs in the palm subdomain of FMDV 3D with the equivalent residues of φ6/ssDNA and HIV1-RT/dsDNA (22Butcher S.J.

Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar) showed that the course of the bound template overhang in its entry to the active site is in good agreement between the three structures. However, there are some differences in the degree of bending of the phosphate backbones at the 5′ end (Fig. 5, A and B).Fig. 5Ribbon diagrams showing the trajectory of the RNA template-primer in the FMDV 3D structure compared with other polymerases. The FMDV 3D polymerase is shown in a blue ribbon and the template-primer RNA in green. Comparisons were done by the structural superimpositions of the palm subdomain in the FMDV 3D with the corresponding palm residues (yellow) in: A, φ6 RDRP plus the initiation replication complex (Protein Data Bank entry 1HI0), where the ssDNA is shown in ribbon representation in brown and the NTP substrates in brown sticks, and B, HIV1-RT plus the covalently trapped catalytic complex (Protein Data Bank entry 1RTD), where the template-primer DNA is shown in red. The root mean square deviations of the superimpositions were 1.4 Å in φ6/ssDNA and 1.5 Å in HIV1-RT/dsDNA for 116 and 55 Cα atoms superimposed, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The short double-stranded stem seen in the structure forms a right-handed A-like helix with Watson-Crick base pairing from G5 to C9 on the template strand and from G16 to C20 on the primer strand. This dsRNA region stretches from the polymerase active site to the COOH-terminal end of the protein following a path that is slightly different to that taken by the template-primer duplex in the HIV1-RT/dsDNA complex (Fig. 5B). The different trajectories observed in both complexes might be explained by the different interactions with the protein residues in the fingers and thumb subdomains that are not structurally conserved in the different polymerases.The template strand of the duplex in the FMDV 3D complex contacts mainly residues in the fingers, whereas the primer strand interacts with the thumb and with motifs C and E in the palm subdomain (Fig. 4).

Mammalian TRF1 and TRF2 bind the double-stranded telomeric repeat sequence and in turn are bound by TIN2, TANK1, TANK2, and hRAP1. TRF1 is a negative regulator of telomere length in telomerase-positive cells, whereas TRF2 is important for telomere capping. TIN2 was identified as a TRF1-interacting protein that mediates TRF1 function. We show here that TIN2 also interacts with TRF2 in vitro and in yeast and mammalian cells. TIN2 mutants defective in binding of TRF1 or TRF2 induce a DNA damage response and destabilize TRF1 and TRF2 at telomeres in human cells. Our findings suggest that the functions of TRF1 and TRF2 are linked by TIN2. Telomeres are protective structures at chromosome ends and are crucial for genomic stability.

Our findings suggest that the functions of TRF1 and TRF2 are linked by TIN2. Telomeres are the DNA protein structures that cap the ends of linear chromosomes thereby protecting them from degradation and fusion by cellular DNA repair systems (1Blackburn E.H. Nature. 2000; 408: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar, 2de Lange T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 532-540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mammals, telomeres consist of several kilobase pairs of double-stranded DNA that have the repeat sequence TTAGGG followed by 100–150 nucleotides of a single-stranded TTAGGG 3′-overhang. The telomeric DNA tract is thought to loop back on itself, thereby protecting the overhang, in a structure termed the t-loop (3Griffith J.D. Comeau L. Rosenfield S. Stansel R.M. Bianchi A. Moss H. de Lange T. Cell. 1999; 97: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1905) Google Scholar). This protected or capped telomeric structure can be lost or disrupted by DNA damage, malfunctions in telomere-associated proteins, or as a consequence of the gradual attrition of telomeric DNA that occurs when cells proliferate in the absence of telomerase. Dysfunctional telomeres activate a DNA damage response, resulting in the binding of DNA damage response proteins to the chromosome end and induction of apoptosis or cellular senescence (4Karlseder J.

Some telomere-associated proteins bind directly to telomeric DNA, whereas others associate with telomeres via protein-protein interactions. Among the direct telomere-binding factors is a family of Myb domain-containing proteins that specifically bind double-stranded telomeric DNA. These proteins include Rap1p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (8Shore D. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1987; 51: 721-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), Taz1 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (9Cooper J.P. Nimmo E.R. Allshire R.C. Cech T.R.

TRF1 reduces telomere length, whereas a dominant-negative TRF1 mutant increases telomere length when overexpressed in telomerase-positive human cells (13van Steensel B. de Lange T. Nature. 1997; 385: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). These results suggest that TRF1 controls the extent to which telomerase can access and hence elongate the telomeres, presumably by modulating the telomeric structure. TRF2 is essential for t-loop formation in vitro (14Stansel R.M. de Lange T. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5532-5540Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) and telomere integrity in vivo (3Griffith J.D. Comeau L. Rosenfield S. Stansel R.M. Bianchi A. Moss H. de Lange T. Cell. 1999; 97: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1905) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that t-loop formation by TRF2 provides a mechanism to sequester the telomeric 3′-overhang, thereby preventing its degradation and/or fusion to another telomere by DNA repair processes. Disruption of TRF2 function induces (ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated) (ATM)/p53-dependent apoptosis in human tumor cells (4Karlseder J. Broccoli D. Dai Y. Hardy S. de Lange T.

Genet. 1999; 23: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), which is thought to mediate the effects of TRF1 on telomere length control and structure (16Kim S.H. Han S. You Y.H. Chen D.J. Campisi J. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). TRF1 also exists in a complex with hPOT1 (17Loayza D. De Lange T.

Sci. 1997; 22: 233-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). TRF2 also interacts with proteins that participate in DNA repair, including RAD50 (25Zhu X.D. Kuster B. Mann M. Petrini J.H. Lange T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), Ku (26Song K. Jung D. Jung Y. Lee S.G. Lee I.

Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), and there is no overlap between this region and the TRF1 region that binds TANK1 and TANK2 (20Smith S. Giriat I.

Consistent with being a TRF1-interacting protein, TIN2 also exists in a TRF1-hPOT complex (17Loayza D. De Lange T. Nature. 2003; 424: 1013-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Overexpression of wild-type TIN2 slightly shortens telomeres, whereas a TIN2 mutant that binds TRF1 but lacks an N-terminal domain elongates telomeres, but both wild type and mutant function in a telomerase-dependent fashion (15Kim S.H. Kaminker P. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 28Rubio M.A. Kim S.H. Campisi J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28609-28617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, TIN2 is shown to form an unusually large complex with TRF1 and a telomeric DNA probe (15Kim S.H. Kaminker P. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). These results and additional biochemical experiments (16Kim S.H. Han S. You Y.H. Chen D.J. Campisi J. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) suggest that TIN2 mediates the telomere length control activity of TRF1 by modulating the telomeric structure.In yeast, a single direct telomere-binding protein (Rap1p in S. cerevisiae and Taz1 in S. pombe) is the principal mediator of both telomere length and capping (9Cooper J.P. Nimmo E.R. Allshire R.C. Cech T.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 30Grossi S. Bianchi A. Damay P. Shore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8117-8128Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), suggesting that these processes are coordinated. In mammals, however, there are two direct telomere-binding proteins, TRF1 and TRF2, which do not interact. Nonetheless, perturbations in either TRF1 or TRF2 or their associated proteins, hPOT1, hRAP1, or TIN2, influence both telomere length and capping (13van Steensel B. de Lange T. Nature. 1997; 385: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar, 15Kim S.H. Kaminker P. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 17Loayza D.

Science. 2002; 295: 2446-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar), suggesting that the activities of TRF1 and TRF2 are coordinated. In addition, TRF1-deficient mouse cells show a reduction of TRF2 and TIN2 at telomeres (32Iwano T. Tachibana M. Reth M. Shinkai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1442-1448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), suggesting that the presence of TRF1 and TRF2 at telomeres may be coordinated.Here we report that TIN2 also binds TRF2 and mediates its end-capping function. We show that TIN2 interacts with TRF1 and TRF2 via distinct domains and forms complexes containing TRF1- and TRF2-interacting proteins. Moreover, TIN2 mutants elicit a DNA damage response, suggesting that TIN2 complexes are important for telomere capping in addition to telomere length control.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Characterization—We cultured HT1080 and BJ cells as described previously (28Rubio M.A. Kim S.H.

Kaminker P. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Cells (6 × 106) on 150-mm culture plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science)) was added to each plate. After incubation on ice for 30 min, cells were collected by scraping and centrifugation at 4 °C, and the supernatant (cell lysate) was recovered. We incubated 10 ml of supernatant with 200 μl of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) at 4 °C for 4 h. We washed the gel with lysis buffer, released bound complexes by adding 300 μl of 3× FLAG peptides (150 ng/μl in lysis buffer) at 4 °C for 30 min, and collected the supernatant by centrifugation. We repeated this procedure three times as recommended by the supplier.Immunoprecipitation and Western Analyses—We incubated cell lysates (300 μl) in lysis buffer with 2 μg of anti-HA 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutinin; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; GFP, green fluorescent protein; aa, amino acid. antibody (Roche Applied Science) or 10 μg of FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C and added 50 μl of a 50% protein A-Sepharose slurry (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C. We washed the immune complexes with lysis buffer and analyzed proteins by Western blotting as described previously (15Kim S.H. Kaminker P. Campisi J. Nat.

Briefly, we cultured cells on slide-chambers; cells were then fixed with 4% formalin, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, and stained with mouse anti-TRF2 (Imgenex), polyclonal anti-TRF1, polyclonal anti-TIN2 (15Kim S.H.

After washing, we stained with secondary antibodies conjugated to Texas Red or fluorescein isothiocyanate (Molecular Probes) and counterstained the nuclei with DAPI. Telomeres were visualized by in situ hybridization using a telomeric protein nucleic acid probe as described previously (35Hultdin M. Gronlund E. Norrback K. Eriksson-Lindstrom E. Just T. Roos G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3651-3656Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar).

Genet. 1999; 23: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), with which it forms stable complexes with TRF1 on telomeric DNA (16Kim S.H. Han S. You Y.H. Chen D.J. Campisi J. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To better understand its function, we expressed FLAG-tagged TIN2 and/or HA-tagged TRF1 in human HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells to isolate TIN2 complexes by FLAG affinity purification. We incubated cell lysates with immobilized anti-FLAG antibody, eluted the bound proteins using FLAG-peptide, and analyzed the eluate by Western blotting.TRF1 associates with the nuclear matrix and cannot be isolated in soluble form without harsh conditions (not shown) (36Luderus M.E. van Steensel B. Chong L. Sibon O.C. Cremers F.F. de Lange T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 867-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). We therefore overexpressed the tagged proteins and determined their interactions with soluble cellular proteins. In cells that overexpressed only FLAG-TIN2, the anti-FLAG antibody precipitated TRF2 and the TRF2-associated protein hRAP1 (Fig. 1A). The antibody did not precipitate TRF1 or the TRF1-associated proteins TANK1 and TANK2, consistent with the presence of TRF1 in the insoluble nuclear matrix fraction. However, in cells that overexpressed both FLAG-TIN2 and HA-TRF1, anti-FLAG precipitated TRF1 and the TRF1-associated proteins TANK1 and TANK2, as well as TRF2 and hRAP1 (Fig. 1A). Addition of ethidium bromide to the cell lysates did not alter these co-immunoprecipitations (not shown), indicating that they are not mediated by DNA. Together these results indicate that TIN2 may interact with TRF2 in addition to its known interaction with TRF1.TIN2 Binds TRF2—To determine whether TIN2 binds TRF2 directly, we used immunoprecipitation and Western blotting to analyze the interactions of previously characterized purified proteins (Fig. 1B) (16Kim S.H. Han S. You Y.H. Chen D.J. Campisi J. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 37Opresko P.L. von Kobbe C. Laine J.P. Harrigan J. Hickson I.D. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41110-41119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Anti-TIN2 and anti-TRF2 specifically precipitated both TIN2 and TRF2 from TIN2-TRF2 mixtures (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 7), indicating a direct interaction. Interestingly, the interaction was diminished by TRF1 (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 5 and 6 with 7 and 8), and relatively little TRF1-TIN2-TRF2 complex was detected in vitro. Thus, TIN2 formed primarily TIN2-TRF1 or TIN2-TRF2 complexes in vitro. To better understand the interactions and functions of TIN2, we created several vectors to express full-length or truncated TIN2 proteins, designated TIN2-13, TIN2-14, TIN2-15, or TIN2-15C (Fig. 1C), in yeast and human cells.First, we used TIN2-13 and TIN2-15 to map the TIN2 regions responsible for TRF2 binding using yeast two-hybrid analysis (38Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4822) Google Scholar). The results showed the expected TIN2-TRF1 interaction via a central TIN2 domain (15Kim S.H. Kaminker P. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 16Kim S.H. Han S. You Y.H. Chen D.J. Campisi J. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and confirmed that TIN2 interacts with TRF2 (Fig. 1D). Moreover, the results identified the N-terminal domain of TIN2 (which is dispensable for TRF1 binding (15Kim S.H. Kaminker P. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 16Kim S.H. Han S. You Y.H. Chen D.J. Campisi J. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)) as essential for TRF2 binding (Fig. 1D). Selection against weak contacts using 3-aminotriazole (38Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4822) Google Scholar) showed that the N terminus (TIN2-15) interacts weakly with TRF2 (Fig. 1D), which we confirmed by in vitro translation and immunoprecipitation (not shown). Thus, additional TIN2 domains may influence the strength or stability of the TIN2-TRF2 complex.To understand the interaction between TIN2 and TRF2 in vivo, we analyzed immunoprecipitates from cells expressing FLAG-TIN2 and/or HA-TRF1 (Fig. 2A). When only HA-TRF1 was expressed, anti-HA did not precipitate detectable TRF2 or TIN2, presumably because endogenous TRF1 and TIN2 are complexed with telomeres bound to the nuclear matrix (not shown) (36Luderus M.E. van Steensel B. Chong L. Sibon O.C. Cremers F.F. de Lange T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 867-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). However, when both HA-TRF1 and FLAG-TIN2 were expressed, anti-HA precipitated TIN2 and TRF2 (Fig. 2A, lane 6) with similar efficiencies (compare lane 6 with 9), suggesting that TRF1, TIN2, and TRF2 reside in the same complex in vivo. Immunoprecipitations from cells that express Myc-tagged TIN2-15C and HA-TRF1 show that TIN2-15C does not interact with TRF1, despite containing part of the TRF1 interaction domain (Fig. 2B). TIN2-15C, which lacks TRF1 binding, interacted with much less TRF2 than wild-type TIN2 or TIN2-14, both of which retain TRF1 binding and the N terminus (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 5, 6, and 7). This result supports the yeast two-hybrid (Fig. 1D) and in vitro immunoprecipitation (not shown) assays, both of which indicated a weak interaction between the N terminus of TIN2 and TRF2, suggesting that the TRF1-binding domain enhances or stabilizes the TIN2-TRF2 interaction. In addition, also confirming the yeast two-hybrid analyses, TIN2-13 binds TRF1 (Fig. 2B) but not TRF2 (Fig. 2C, compare lane 8 with 5 and 7), whereas TIN2-14 binds both TRF1 (15Kim S.H. Kaminker P. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) and TRF2 (Fig. 2C, lane 7). Together these finding indicate that TIN2 binds TRF2 in vitro and in cells and that this interaction requires a TIN2 (N-terminal) domain that is distinct from the central TRF1-binding domain.Fig. 2Wild-type TIN2 forms a complex with TRF1 and TRF2 in vivo.A, interactions of TIN2 in cells are shown. Lysates from HT1080 cells stably expressing HA-TRF1, FLAG-TIN2, or both HA-TRF1 and FLAG-TIN2 were immunoprecipitated (IP) by monoclonal anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibodies. The lysates (10% Input) and immune precipitates were analyzed for TIN2, TRF1 (anti-HA), and TRF2 by Western blotting (WB). B, interactions of TIN1-15C and TIN2-13 are shown. HT1080 cells expressing HA-TRF1 were stably infected with LXSN retroviruses expressing Myc-tagged TIN2-15C or Myc-TIN2-13. Lysates were prepared and precipitated using an anti-Myc-antibody or anti-HA-antibody (the latter is not shown). Unprecipitated lysates (Input (10%)) and the immune precipitates were analyzed for TRF1 (anti-HA) and TIN2 by Western blotting. C, interactions of TIN2-13, TIN2-14, and TIN2-15C are shown. HT1080 cells were infected with LXSN retroviruses expressing Myc-tagged wild-type TIN2 or Myc-TIN2-13, TIN2-14, or TIN2-15C. Lysates were prepared and precipitated using an anti-Myc-antibody. Unprecipitated lysates (Input (10%)) and the immune precipitates were analyzed for TRF2 and TIN2 by Western blotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)TIN2 Mutants Induce a Telomeric DNA Damage Response— Telomere dysfunction caused by dominant-negative mutants of TRF2 induce a damage response characterized by γ-H2AX and 53BP1 nuclear foci (6Takai H. Smogorzewska A. de Lange T. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1549-1556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar, 7d'Adda di Fagagna F. Reaper P.M. Clay-Farrace L. Fiegler H. Carr P. Von Zglinicki T. Saretzki G. Carter N.P. Jackson S.P. Nature. 2003; 426: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (2004) Google Scholar). If the TIN2-TRF2 complex is crucial for telomere function, its disruption by a mutant TIN2 protein should induce this response. To test this idea, we used lentiviruses to express Myc-tagged TIN2-15C or green fluorescent protein (GFP) (control) in normal human fibroblasts (strain BJ). The viruses use the cytomegalovirus promoter to express the transduced proteins at high levels. GFP fluorescence and anti-Myc immunostaining showed a 70–80% infection efficiency (Fig. 3A). Immunostaining for γ-H2AX showed that 70–80% of cells in TIN2-15C but not GFP expressing cultures had prominent nuclear foci (10–40 foci/nucleus) (Fig. 3B). Moreover, >95% of the TIN2-15C-positive cells were positive for γ-H2AX foci (not shown). Likewise, TIN2-15C (Fig. 3C) but not GFP induced 53BP1 foci, essentially all of which coincided with γ-H2AX foci (Fig. 3D), indicating that these foci were the result of a DNA damage response. Most of the 53BP1/γ-H2AX foci localized to telomeres, detected by in situ hybridization using a protein-nucleic acid probe (Fig. 3E). Thus, overexpression of a TIN2 protein that binds TRF2 but not TRF1 (TIN2-15C) caused a DNA damage response at telomeres. Likewise, a TIN2 protein that binds TRF1 but not TRF2 (TIN2-13), similarly delivered and expressed, induced damage-responsive foci (Fig. 3F). However, TIN2-14, which retains both TRF1 (15Kim S.H. Kaminker P. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 16Kim S.H. Han S. You Y.H. Chen D.J. Campisi J. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and TRF2 binding (Fig. 2C), failed to induce a DNA damage response (Fig. 3F). Together, these results indicate that disruption of either the TRF1- or TRF2-binding functions of TIN2 causes telomere uncapping.Fig. 3Effect of TIN2 mutants on the telomeric damage response.A, lentiviral infection efficiency is shown. BJ cells were infected with lenti-GFP or lenti-Myc-TIN2-15C and monitored 48 h later for GFP fluorescence or TIN2-15C expression using Myc antibodies and immunostaining. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). B and C, DNA damage response is shown. Early passage normal human fibroblasts (BJ cells) were infected with lentiviruses expressing GFP (control) or TIN2-15C (Myc-tagged) and immunostained 48 h later for γ-H2AX (B), 53BP1 (C), or TIN2-15C (anti-Myc) (C) foci. The TIN2-15C and 53BP1 images were merged (Merge). D, TIN2-15C-induced γ-H2AX and 53BP1 foci coincide. BJ cells infected with lenti-TIN2-15C were co-stained for γ-H2AX and 53BP1, and the images were merged (Merge). E, telomeric damage response is shown. BJ cells infected with lenti-TIN2-15C were co-stained for telomeres using fluorescence in situ hybridization and a protein nucleic acid probe, and γ-H2AX foci were co-stained using fluorescence immunostaining and a monoclonal antibody. F, TIN2-13 but not TIN2-14 induces damage foci. BJ cells were infected with lenti-TIN2-13 or lenti-TIN2-14 and stained 48 h later for expression of the mutant proteins (α-TIN2) and γ-H2AX or 53BP1 foci. The nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue) and merged with the γ-H2AX or 53BP1 images.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)TIN2 Mutants Destabilize and/or Disrupt TRF2 and TRF1 at Telomeres—To understand how TIN2 mutants induce a telomeric damage response, we immunostained the 53BP1/γ-H2AX foci-positive and -negative BJ cells in the lenti-TIN2-15C-infected population for TRF1 and TRF2. Most (>95%) cells with 53BP1 or γ-H2AX foci were devoid of focal TRF2 staining, whereas most cells that lacked 53BP1/γ-H2AX foci had detectable TRF2 staining (Fig. 4A). TRF1 was also affected by TIN2-15C overexpression, albeit to a lesser extent. Only some γ-H2AX-positive cells showed reduced TRF1 staining (Fig. 4B). Thus, TIN2-15C caused a telomeric damage response and reduced TRF2 and, to a lesser extent, TRF1 localization at telomeres. Likewise, TIN2-13 but not TIN2-14 reduced TRF2 immunostaining (Fig. 4C). Together, these findings indicate that TIN2 is important for telomere capping and that it requires both TRF1 and TRF2 binding to maintain functional telomeres.Fig. 4Effects of TIN2 mutants on TRF2 and TRF1 localization and stability.A and B, TIN2-15C reduces TRF2 immunostaining at damage-induced foci. BJ cells infected with lenti-TIN2-15C were co-stained for 53BP1 and TRF2 (A) or γ-H2AX and TRF1 (B). The nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue), and the images were merged (DAPI/Merge). In A, solid arrowheads show 53BP1-negative (uninfected, undamaged) cell with TRF2 staining; open arrowheads show 53BP1-positive (infected, damaged) cells that largely lack TRF2 staining.

https://openalex.org/W1976319140,"In yeast, hyperosmotic stress causes an immediate dissociation of most proteins from chromatin, presumably because cells are unprepared for, and initially unresponsive to, increased ion concentrations in the nucleus. Osmotic stress activates Hog1 MAP kinase, which phosphorylates at least two proteins located at the plasma membrane, the Nha1 Na+/H+ antiporter and the Tok1 potassium channel. Hog1 phosphorylation stimulates Nha1 activity, and this is crucial for the rapid reassociation of proteins with their target sites in chromatin. This initial response to hyperosmolarity precedes and temporally regulates the activation of stress-response genes that depends on Hog1 phosphorylation of transcription factors in the nucleus. Thus, a single MAP kinase coordinates temporally, spatially, and mechanistically distinct responses to stress, thereby providing very rapid stress relief that facilitates subsequent changes in gene expression that permit long-term adaptation to harsh environmental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2094508018,"Stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) is a CXC chemokine that is constitutively expressed in most tissues and displayed on the cell surface in association with heparan sulfate (HS). Its numerous biological effects are mediated by a specific G protein-coupled receptor, CXCR4. A number of cells inactivate SDF-1 by specific processing of the N-terminal domain of the chemokine. In particular, CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV), a serine protease that co-distributes with CXCR4 at the cell surface, mediates the selective removal of the N-terminal dipeptide of SDF-1. We report here that heparin and HS specifically prevent the processing of SDF-1 by DPP IV expressed by Caco-2 cells. The level of processing increases with the level of differentiation of these cells, which correlates with an increase of DPP IV activity. A mutant SDF-1 that does not interact with HS is readily cleaved by DPP IV, a process that is not inhibited by HS, demonstrating that a productive interaction between HS and SDF-1 is required for the protection to take place. Moreover, we found that protection depends on the degree of polymerization of the HS sulfated S-domains. Finally a structural model of SDF-1, in complex with HS oligosaccharides of defined length, rationalizes the experimental data. The mechanisms by which HS regulates SDF-1 may thus include, in addition to its ability to locally concentrate the chemokine at the cell surface, a control of selective protease cleavage events that directly affect the chemokine activity.

In particular, CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV), a serine protease that co-distributes with CXCR4 at the cell surface, mediates the selective removal of the N-terminal dipeptide of SDF-1. We report here that heparin and HS specifically prevent the processing of SDF-1 by DPP IV expressed by Caco-2 cells. The level of processing increases with the level of differentiation of these cells, which correlates with an increase of DPP IV activity. A mutant SDF-1 that does not interact with HS is readily cleaved by DPP IV, a process that is not inhibited by HS, demonstrating that a productive interaction between HS and SDF-1 is required for the protection to take place. Moreover, we found that protection depends on the degree of polymerization of the HS sulfated S-domains. Finally a structural model of SDF-1, in complex with HS oligosaccharides of defined length, rationalizes the experimental data. The mechanisms by which HS regulates SDF-1 may thus include, in addition to its ability to locally concentrate the chemokine at the cell surface, a control of selective protease cleavage events that directly affect the chemokine activity.

SDF-1 binds to CXCR4, a G-protein-coupled receptor, and coordinates a diverse array of cellular functions, in particular the control of trafficking and homing of various subsets of hematopoietic cells from the blood stream to specific anatomical sites (1Nagasawa T.

However, a large body of evidence implicates SDF-1 outside the regulation of leukocyte migration, i.e. SDF-1 and its receptor have a critical role in determining the metastatic destination of tumor cells (4Geminder H.

Inactivation of either SDF-1 or CXCR4 induces a number of defects including severe abnormalities in the immune, circulatory, and central nervous systems (9Nagasawa T. Hirota S. Tachibana K.

Finally SDF-1 is up-regulated in several diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, autoimmune disease, or allergic disorder (12Gerard C. Rollins B.J. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 108-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). Consistent with this broad range of activities, CXCR4 is widely expressed in a large variety of cells and tissues. SDF-1 is also constitutively expressed by a large number of cells (13Coulomb-L'Hermine A. Amara A. Schiff C. Durand-Gasselin I. Foussat A. Delaunay T. Chaouat G. Capron F. Ledee N. Galanaud P.

Structure-function analysis of SDF-1 has identified the N-terminal region as important for CXCR4 binding and activation (17Crump M.P. Gong J.H. Loetscher P. Rajarathnam K. Amara A.

The N-terminal domain of the chemokine SDF-1 was shown to be efficiently processed by a number of proteases, including matrix metalloproteinase (18McQuibban G.A. Butler G.S. Gong J.-H. Bendall L.

Interestingly, among these enzymes, CD26, a cell surface serine protease, co-distributes and co-immunoprecipitates with CXCR4, suggesting a functional relationship with SDF-1 (24Herrera C.

CD26 removes the N-terminal dipeptides from a number of proteins having either a Pro or an Ala residue in the penultimate position (25Mentlein R. Regul. Pept. 1999; 85: 9-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar), a characteristic shared by several chemokines (26Van Damme J. Struyf S. Wuyts A. Van Coillie E. Menten P. Schols D. Sozzani S.

The processing of SDF-1 by CD26, giving rise to SDF-1 (3–68), results in a loss of lymphocyte chemotactic activity and signaling through CXCR4. However, SDF-1 (3–68) still interacts with its receptor and is able to desensitize for Ca2+ responses toward intact SDF-1, although with a considerably lower efficiency (17Crump M.P. Gong J.H. Loetscher P. Rajarathnam K. Amara A. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Virelizier J.L. Baggiolini M. Sykes B.D. Clark-Lewis I.

Among the molecules that also regulate chemokines, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), in particular heparan sulfate (HS), play an important role. Different studies suggest that GAGs immobilize and enhance local concentrations of chemokines, promoting their oligomerization and facilitating their presentation to the receptors (28Hoogewerf A.J. Kuschert G.S. Proudfoot A.E. Borlat F. Clark-Lewis I. Power C.A. Wells T.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13570-13578Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 29Lortat-Jacob H. Grosdidier A. Imberty A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1229-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), and in vivo data suggest that, within tissues, SDF-1 is sequestered by HS (30Sweeney E.A. Lortat-Jacob H. Priestley G.V. Nakamoto B. Papayannopoulou T. Blood. 2002; 99: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 31Pablos J.L. Santiago B. Galindo M. Torres C. Brehmer M.T. Blanco F.J. Garcia-Lazaro F.J. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 2147-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This oligosaccharide, which is found ubiquitously at the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix, consists of sulfated glucosamine and iduronic residues clustered in a series of domains of variable lengths and sulfation patterns separated by regions of low sulfation and relatively uniform structure (32Murphy K.J. Merry C.L. Lyon M. Thompson J.E. Roberts I.S. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27239-27245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). SDF-1 binds with high affinity (Kd of 30 nm) to the sulfated regions of HS (called S-domains), and we have shown that amino acids Lys24 and Lys27 have a dominant role in the binding. In addition, residues Lys1, Arg41, and Lys43 participate in the recognition process but are not strictly required for the interaction to take place (33Sadir R. Baleux F. Grosdidier A. Imberty A. Lortat-Jacob H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8288-8296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Given the substrate specificity of DPP IV and the possible involvement of the N-terminal residue (Lys1) of SDF-1 in the complex with HS, the present study investigates whether heparin or HS could interfere with the processing of the chemokine by CD26. For that purpose, human colon adenocarcinoma epithelial cells (Caco-2), which express distinct levels of CD26/DPP IV depending on their degree of differentiation (34Darmoul D. Lacasa M. Baricault L. Marguet D. Sapin C. Trotot P. Barbat A. Trugnan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4824-4833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were used. We first highlighted the enzymatic activity of CD26 on solubilized Caco-2 cell membranes and used this material as a source of CD26 to show that heparin- and HS-derived oligosaccharides inhibit CD26-induced cleavage of SDF-1, depending on their degree of polymerization. Reagents—Glycyl-prolyl p-nitroanilide (Gly-Pro-pNA), diprotin A (Ile-Pro-Ile), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated ExtrAvidin, and heparin (6 and 15 kDa) were obtained from Sigma. Heparan sulfate was from Celsus. Protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Complete) were from Roche. Eagle's minimum essential medium, fetal calf serum, and Versene were from Invitrogen. A monoclonal antibody (mAb K15C) recognizing the N terminus (epitope containing the two first amino acids) of SDF-1 was kindly provided by Dr. F. Arenzana-Seisdedos (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France). Anti-mouse peroxidase-conjugated antibody was from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Bio-Gel P-10 and electrophoresis and electroblotting reagents were from Bio-Rad. Heparinase and heparitinase were from Grampian Enzymes. Cell Culture—Caco-2 cells were obtained from the European Collection of Cell Cultures. They were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1% non-essential amino acids, and 2 mm Glutamax. Cells were grown at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Caco-2 cells were routinely passaged every 6 days and kept 12 days post-confluency to induce differentiation as described (34Darmoul D. Lacasa M. Baricault L. Marguet D. Sapin C. Trotot P. Barbat A. Trugnan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4824-4833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The medium was changed regularly during cell differentiation. Preparation of Cellular Membranes and Solubilization—Caco-2 cells were detached with EDTA (Versene) and incubated for 20 min in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, containing protease inhibitors) and then disrupted by Dounce homogenization. The homogenate was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was collected and further centrifuged at 220,000 × g for 30 min. The cell membrane-containing pellet was then solubilized in 100 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.6) and 1% Triton X-100 and cleared by centrifugation at 220,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was aliquoted and used as a source of CD26/DPP IV activity. Assay for DPP IV Activity on Non-differentiated and Differentiated Caco-2 Cells—DPP IV activity was assayed using Gly-Pro-pNA as a chromogenic substrate. Caco-2 cells were seeded into 96-well flat-bottomed plates (2 × 105 cells per well) in 200 μl of Eagle's minimum essential medium with 10% fetal calf serum until confluence or 12 days post-confluence. Cells were incubated at 37 °C, for different times, with 0–4 mm Gly-Pro-pNA in 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 120 mm MgSO4, 8 mm glucose, and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Enzymatic activity was determined by monitoring the release of pNA in the supernatant with spectrophotometry at 405 nm. Cell-free and substrate-free blanks were run in parallel. Inhibition of Gly-Pro-pNA cleavage was determined in presence of specific inhibitor, diprotin A, preincubated for 15 min at 37 °C prior to the addition of the substrate. The assay was also performed using either cellular membranes or solubilized membranes from non-differentiated and differentiated Caco-2 cells. Tests were run in triplicate. To assess a possible effect of GAGs on DPP IV activity, solubilized membranes were preincubated with different concentrations of heparin or heparan sulfate and then incubated in the presence of the chromogenic substrate (2 mm). SDF-1 Synthesis—Biotinylated SDF-1 was synthesized by the Merrifield solid phase method on a fully automated peptide synthesizer using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry as described previously (35Amara A. Lorthioir O. Valenzuela A. Magerus A. Thelen M. Montes M. Virelizier J.L. Delepierre M. Baleux F. Lortat-Jacob H. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23916-23925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Selective biotinylation at the C-terminal position was achieved by incorporating a lysine residue (Lys68) bearing a 4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dioxocyclohex-1-ylidene)ethyl (Dde) protective group on the side chain. Coupling of biotin was performed on the peptide resin after Dde deprotection. A mutant SDF-1 (substitution of Lys24 and Lys27 by Ser24 and Ser27) was synthesized with the same method. Purity and molecular weights of wild type or mutant SDF-1 were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography and ion spray mass spectrometry (33Sadir R. Baleux F. Grosdidier A. Imberty A.

Preparation of Heparin- and Heparan Sulfate-derived Oligosaccharides—Heparin and heparan sulfate oligosaccharides were prepared as described previously (33Sadir R. Baleux F. Grosdidier A. Imberty A. Lortat-Jacob H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8288-8296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Briefly, porcine mucosal heparin (10 g) or heparan sulfate (8 g) were depolymerized with heparinase I (8 milliunits/ml) in 5 mm Tris, 2 mm CaCl2, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 54 h at 25 °C or with heparitinase (25 milliunits/ml) in 5 mm Tris, 2 mm CaCl2, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, respectively, for 72 h at 30 °C. Enzyme digestion was stopped by heating the reaction mixture at 100 °C for 5 min. Digestion products were then size-separated using a Bio-Gel P-10 column (150 × 4.4), equilibrated with 0.25 m NaCl, and run at 1 ml/min. Eluted material was detected by absorbency at 232 nm. Graded series of size-uniform oligosaccharides resolved from disaccharide (dp2) to octadecasaccharide (dp18) were obtained for heparin and from dp2 to dp16 for heparan sulfate. Top fractions of each peak were pooled, dialyzed against distilled water, and quantified by colorimetric assay or weighted. SDF-1 Processing by Solubilized Membranes Containing CD26— Biotinylated SDF-1 (600 nm) was incubated with Triton X-100 Caco-2 cell-solubilized membranes (1 mg/ml of total protein) for 1 h at 37 °Cin 100 mm Hepes buffer, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, and 8 mm glucose, pH 7.6. The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heating at 100 °C for few minutes. In some cases, the DPP IV specific inhibitor, diprotin A (340 μg/ml), was incubated with solubilized membranes for 15 min at 37 °C prior to the addition of biotinylated SDF-1. To investigate the effect of GAGs, biotinylated SDF-1 was preincubated with different concentrations of heparin, heparan sulfate, or size-defined oligosaccharides (dp8 to dp16) prior to incubation with solubilized membranes. SDF-1 Cleavage Analysis—SDF-1 processing was determined by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with a monoclonal antibody (mAb K15C) that selectively recognizes the N terminus of the chemokine and with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated ExtrAvidin that detects the biotin label at the C terminus. The reaction mixture was resolved by SDS-PAGE (14% polyacrylamide) followed by electroblotting onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% milk overnight at 4 °C and then incubated with mAb K15C (2 μg/ml) for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% dry milk. Detection was performed using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence. To detect the biotin label of SDF-1, the membrane was incubated overnight in stripping buffer (20 mm glycine, pH 2, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.05% Tween 20), washed, and reprobed with horseradish peroxidase-ExtrAvidin. Signals were quantified by densitometry. Molecular Modeling—The coordinates of the crystal structure of the native SDF-1 dimer (36Ohnishi Y. Senda T. Nandhagopal N. Sugimoto K. Shioda T. Nagal Y. Mitsui Y. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2000; 20: 691-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) were taken from the Protein Data Bank (37Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (26227) Google Scholar) (PDB code 1QG7). The amino acids missing on the N-terminal moiety of chain B (Pro2 to Leu5) were added using structural homology with chain A. Lys1 was added on both chains, and the missing side chains of a few amino acids were modeled. The geometry of all side chains was optimized using the Tripos force field (38Clark M. Cramer R.D.I. van den Opdenbosch N. J. Comput. Chem. 1989; 8: 982-1012Crossref Scopus (2770) Google Scholar) in the SYBYL molecular modeling package (Tripos, St. Louis, MO). Hydrogen atoms were added and optimized, and partial atomic charges were derived using the Pullman procedure (39Berthod H. Pullman A. J. Chem. Phys. 1965; 62: 942-946Google Scholar). The starting conformations of oligosaccharides with alternating 2-N-sulfated, 6-O-sulfated α-d-Glc and 2-O-sulfated α-l-iduronic acid monosaccharides were taken from our previous docking study (33Sadir R. Baleux F. Grosdidier A. Imberty A. Lortat-Jacob H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8288-8296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Atom types and partial charges were defined according to the Pérez-Imberty-Meyer (PIM) energy parameters for carbohydrates (40Imberty A. Bettler E. Karababa M. Mazeau K. Petrova P. Pérez S. Vijayan M. Yathindra N. Kolaskar A.S. Perspectives in Structural Biology. Indian Academy of Sciences and Universities Press, Hyderabad, India1999: 392-409Google Scholar) to be used within the Tripos force field. Different lengths of oligosaccharides were considered with either 8 or 12 monosaccharides and different conformations of the Lys1-Pro2 N-terminal moiety. For each complex, energy minimizations were performed with constraining only the backbone of amino acids 9–67. A distance-dependent dielectric constant was used in the calculations. Energy minimizations were carried out using the Powell procedure (41Powell M.J.D. Math. Program. 1977; 12: 241-254Crossref Scopus (1394) Google Scholar) until a gradient deviation of 0.5 kcal·mol–1·Å–1 was attained. The N-terminal Domain of SDF-1 Is Processed by Dipeptidyl Peptidase IV Activity Solubilized from Caco-2 Cells Membranes—To assess DPP IV activity in Caco-2 cells (an enterocyte-like colon cell line), we measured the production of pNA, which resulted from the cleavage of the chromogenic substrate Gly-Pro-pNA, by using freshly prepared solubilized membranes. Solubilized membranes from differentiated cells (i.e. cells maintained in a post-confluent state for 12 days in culture) displayed higher level of DPP IV activity than non-differentiated cells (Fig. 1A), which is consistent with the increase in CD26 gene expression in cells that display enterocytic differentiation (34Darmoul D. Lacasa M. Baricault L. Marguet D. Sapin C. Trotot P. Barbat A. Trugnan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4824-4833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of diprotin A, a DPP IV inhibitor, to the solubilized membranes from differentiated cells reduced the level of pNA by 85–90% (Fig. 1B), demonstrating the specificity of the assay (EDTA and Pefabloc have no effect; data not shown). The addition of heparin or HS (up to 0.5 mg/ml) to the reaction mixture did not change the amount of pNA produced (Fig. 1B), indicating that DPP IV activity was not affected by the presence of GAGs. To further demonstrate that heparin and HS did not interfere with DPP IV activity, a time course was also performed (Fig. 1B, inset) and showed that none of the GAGs either reduced or enhanced the degradation of the substrate and, thus, did not modify DPP IV activity. SDF-1 N-terminal domain processing was then investigated following exposure of the chemokine to DPP IV activity solubilized from the membrane of either non-differentiated or differentiated Caco-2 cells. For that purpose, SDF-1 carrying a biotin group on the C-terminal residue (Lys68) was incubated for 1 h with the solubilized membranes. The reaction mixture was then resolved by SDS-PAGE, and N-terminal processing of the chemokine was determined by Western blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody, K15C, the epitope of which critically contains the SDF-1 residues Lys1 and Pro2 (35Amara A. Lorthioir O. Valenzuela A. Magerus A. Thelen M. Montes M. Virelizier J.L. Delepierre M. Baleux F. Lortat-Jacob H. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. J. Biol.

Incubation of the chemokine with differentiated cell-solubilized membranes led to a complete loss of the K15C immunoreactivity, indicating an efficient processing of the SDF-1 N-terminal domain (Fig. 1C). Incubation of the chemokine with non-differentiated cell-solubilized membranes (which contained a lower level of DPP IV activity) led to a partial loss of the K15C immunoreactivity, whereas the addition to the reaction mixture of diprotin A, a specific DPP IV inhibitor, restored the K15C reactivity (Fig. 1C). To ensure that each lane contained an equivalent amount of SDF-1, the Western blot membrane was stripped, and a second detection for the biotin label was performed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated ExtrAvidin. Heparin Prevents DPP IV-induced SDF-1 Processing—To determine the effect of heparin on SDF-1 processing, the chemokine was preincubated with a range of heparin concentration and then challenged with DPP IV solubilized from differentiated Caco-2 cell membranes. The K15C immunoreactivity that was lost in the absence of heparin was recovered in the presence of heparin and increased as a function of heparin concentration (Fig. 2, A and B). Because the presence of heparin did not inhibit DPP IV activity (see Fig. 1B), this finding indicates that heparin protected SDF-1 from processing. Quantification of the chemiluminescent signals by densitometry showed that maximum protection of the chemokine was obtained with a 2-fold molar excess of heparin (15 kDa) over SDF-1 (Fig. 2A). Low molecular mass heparin (6 kDa) was similarly analyzed. A 5-fold molar excess was required to get maximum protection (Fig. 2B). However, it is worth noting that this material contains a proportion of molecules with molecular masses below 3 kDa (not shown) that are inactive regarding SDF-1 protection (see below). We next compared the N-terminal processing of the wild type and a mutant SDF-1 induced by DPP IV. The SDF-1 mutant used here was generated by the combined substitution of the amino acids Lys24 and Lys27 by Ser residues and has a strongly impaired heparin binding capacity (33Sadir R. Baleux F. Grosdidier A. Imberty A. Lortat-Jacob H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8288-8296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Our results showed that both the wild type and the mutated chemokines were almost completely processed. However, although a 5-fold molar excess of heparin significantly inhibited the cleavage of the wild type SDF-1, heparin was ineffective in protecting the mutant chemokine from DPP IV activity (Fig. 2C). Together, these data showed that heparin efficiently protected SDF-1 from processing by DPP IV activity and that a complex between the GAG and the chemokine was required for such protection to take place.

Like other inhibitory NK cell receptors, they contain immunoglobulin receptor family tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs in their cytoplasmic domains, and Siglec-7 has been demonstrated to negatively regulate NK cell activation. Based on reports of the presence of these siglecs on T cells, we sought to determine if they are capable of modulating T cell receptor (TCR) signaling using Jurkat T cells stably and transiently transfected with Siglec-7 or Siglec-9. Following either pervanadate stimulation or TCR engagement, both Siglecs exhibited increased tyrosine phosphorylation and recruitment of SHP-1. Effects of Siglec-7 and -9 were also evident in downstream events in the signaling pathway. Both siglecs reduced phosphorylation of Tyr319 on ZAP-70, known to play a pivotal role in up-regulation of gene transcription following TCR stimulation. There was also a corresponding decreased transcriptional activity of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) as determined using a luciferase reporter gene. Like all siglecs, Siglec-7 and -9 recognize sialic acid-containing glycans of glycoproteins and glycolipids as ligands. Mutation of the conserved Arg in the ligand binding site of Siglec-7 (Arg124) or Siglec-9 (Arg120) resulted in reduced inhibitory function in the NFAT/luciferase transcription assay, suggesting that ligand binding is required for optimal inhibition of TCR signaling. The combined results demonstrate that both Siglec-7 and Siglec-9 are capable of negative regulation of TCR signaling and that ligand binding is required for optimal activity.

The human siglec family of cell receptors is composed of eleven members of the Ig superfamily, which are functionally related by their ability to bind sialic acid-containing carbohydrates of glycoproteins and glycolipids as ligands (1Angata T.

Crystal structure analysis of two Siglecs, sialoadhesin (Siglec-1) and Siglec-7, have revealed a shallow sialic acid binding pocket with a conserved sequence of six amino acids in the tip of the C-C′ loop that influences the specificity for binding various sialoside sequences found in nature (7Alphey M.S.

Within this sequence, a conserved arginine residue coordinates with the C-1 hydroxyl group of the sialic acid and is required for binding as evidenced by Arg to Ala mutations that abrogate binding to sialic acid-containing ligands (11Angata T.

Another characteristic feature of the siglecs is the presence of consensus immunoglobulin receptor family tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIM) 1The abbreviations used are: ITIM, immune-globulin receptor family tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs; IRS, inhibitory-receptor superfamily; NKR, natural killer cell receptor; KOD polymerase, polymerase from Thermococcus kodakaraensis; Sig-7, Siglec-7; Sig-9, Siglec-9; TCR, T cell receptor; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T cell; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PHA, P. vulgaris red kidney bean lectin-L; PBL, peripheral blood leukocyte; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; CMV, cytomegalovirus; FCS, fetal calf serum; SHP-1, SH2 domain-containing phosphatase 1; SHIP-1, SH2 inositol phosphatase-1. 1The abbreviations used are: ITIM, immune-globulin receptor family tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs; IRS, inhibitory-receptor superfamily; NKR, natural killer cell receptor; KOD polymerase, polymerase from Thermococcus kodakaraensis; Sig-7, Siglec-7; Sig-9, Siglec-9; TCR, T cell receptor; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T cell; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PHA, P. vulgaris red kidney bean lectin-L; PBL, peripheral blood leukocyte; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; CMV, cytomegalovirus; FCS, fetal calf serum; SHP-1, SH2 domain-containing phosphatase 1; SHIP-1, SH2 inositol phosphatase-1. in the cytoplasmic domains of all but sialoadhesin (Siglec-1) and myelin-associated glycoprotein (Siglec-4) (2Crocker P.R. Varki A. Immunology. 2001; 103: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). ITIM motifs are found in an expanding group of immunoglobulin family receptors that negatively regulate immune cell activation, which have been called the inhibitory-receptor superfamily (IRS) by Lanier (13Lanier L.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 359-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar). Members of the IRS exhibit three characteristic properties: (i) they recruit SH2 domain-containing protein tyrosine-based phosphatases such as SHP-1 and/or SHP-2 via a cytoplasmic ITIM motif, (ii) they affect activation receptors in cis, and (iii) require co-ligation with the activation receptors to exert their effect (13Lanier L.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 359-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar). One of the siglecs, CD22 (Siglec-2), is well established as a negative regulator of B cell receptor signaling and fulfills all the characteristics of a member of the IRS (13Lanier L.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 359-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar, 14Cornall R.J. Goodnow C.C. Cyster J.G. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1999; 244: 57-68PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the presence of ITIM motifs in the cytoplasmic domains of most siglecs, it is generally believed that others will also be shown to be inhibitory receptors (1Angata T. Brinkman-Van der Linden E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 294-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 2Crocker P.R. Varki A.

Direct evidence that this is the case for Siglec-7 has been obtained from several laboratories. Indeed, Siglec-7 was originally cloned as a negative regulator of NK cell cytolysis (15Falco M. Biassoni R. Bottino C. Vitale M. Sivori S. Augugliaro R. Moretta L. Moretta A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Recently, Crocker and colleagues (16Nicoll G. Avril T. Lock K. Furukawa K. Bovin N. Crocker P.R. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 1642-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) demonstrated that NK cells were less able to kill target cells bearing a high affinity Siglec-7 ligand (ganglioside GD3), presumably a result of inhibition of NK activation by recruitment of Siglec-7 to the site of NK cell-target cell contact (16Nicoll G. Avril T. Lock K. Furukawa K. Bovin N. Crocker P.R. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 1642-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 17Ito A. Handa K. Withers D.A. Satoh M. Hakomori S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Antibody cross-linking of Siglec-7 or CD33 (Siglec-3) has also been associated with negative regulation of cell growth by reducing proliferation and inducing apoptosis of CD34-positive hematopoietic precursors and chronic myeloid leukemia cells (18Vitale C. Romagnani C. Falco M. Ponte M. Vitale M. Moretta A. Bacigalupo A. Moretta L. Mingari M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15091-15096Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 19Vitale C.

A. 2001; 98: 5764-5769Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Similarly, Nutku et al. (20Nutku E. Aizawa H. Hudson S.A. Bochner B.S. Blood. 2003; 101: 5014-5020Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) have shown that antibody ligation of Siglec-8 induces capsase-3-like-dependent apoptosis in eosinophils. Recently, ligation of Siglec-5 on neutrophils has been shown to augment oxidative burst induced by formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine (21Erickson-Miller C.L. Freeman S.D. Hopson C.B. D'Alessio K.J.

However, in contrast to the case of CD22 regulation of B cell receptor signaling, the activation receptor modulated by these siglecs in NK cells, eosinophils, and neutrophils has not been identified. Siglec-7 (p75/AIRM) has been classified as an inhibitory NK cell receptor (NKR) based on its structural homology to other immunoglobulin-like NKRs (22Farag S.S. Fehniger T.A. Ruggeri L. Velardi A.

Immunol. 2000; 12: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), its gene locus (19q13.3-13.4) (25Yousef G.M. Ordon M.H. Foussias G. Diamandis E.P. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 286: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) proximal to other NKR gene families (23McQueen K.L. Parham P. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and the presence of ITIM motifs in its cytoplasmic domain (24Ugolini S. Vivier E. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Although classic NKRs bind major histocompatibility complex class 1 molecules as ligands, there are a growing number of NKRs like Siglec-7 that bind other ligands or whose ligands are unknown (22Farag S.S. Fehniger T.A. Ruggeri L. Velardi A. Caligiuri M.A. Blood. 2002; 100: 1935-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that Siglec-9 is also expressed on NK cells, although it has not yet been classified as an NKR. Several NKRs are expressed on subsets of CD8+ T cells with a memory phenotype (26Uhrberg M. Valiante N.M. Young N.T. Lanier L.L. Phillips J.H. Parham P. J.

In particular, the immunoglobulin-like NK cell receptor, LIR1/ILT2, has been demonstrated to regulate cytolysis, cytokine secretion, proliferation, and actin cytoskeleton reorganization through negative regulation of the TCR complex (34Colonna M. Navarro F. Bellon T. Llano M. Garcia P. Samaridis J. Angman L. Cella M. Lopez-Botet M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1809-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 35Dietrich J. Cella M. Colonna M.

Blood. 2002; 100: 1019-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Because Siglec-7 and Siglec-9 were both detected on subsets of T cells (38Zhang J.Q. Nicoll G. Jones C. Crocker P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22121-22126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 39Nicoll G. Ni J. Liu D. Klenerman P. Munday J. Dubock S. Mattei M.G. Crocker P.R. J. Biol.

Accordingly, we investigated their ability to regulate TCR activation using Jurkat cell lines expressing Siglec-7 or Siglec-9 and their receptor-binding mutants with Arg to Ala substitutions at residues 124 and 120, respectively. The results show that both Siglec-7 and -9 can negatively regulate TCR activation by recruitment of SHP-1, resulting in reduced transcription of NFAT-mediated gene transcription. Equivalent expression of the receptor-binding mutants had no effect on TCR activation indicating that a functional ligand binding domain is required for optimal activity. The results suggest that these two siglecs may participate in modulating the activation threshold of T cells expressing them. Cells, Antibodies, and Reagents—Jurkat cells were routinely cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), and 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen). FITC-labeled anti-CD3 (UCHT1), anti-human γδ TCR, and anti-human αβ TCR mAbs, were purchased from BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). Red phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG mAb was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Anti-Siglec-7 (S7) and anti-Siglec-9 (K8) mAbs were kind gifts from Dr. Paul R.

Anti-ZAP70, and anti-phosphoZAP70 Abs were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA).

Phaseolus vulgaris red kidney bean lectin-L (PHA), anti-FLAG M2 mAb, anti-FLAG mAb-conjugated beads, anti-FLAG M2 polyclonal antibody, and Triton X-100 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Orthovanadate was from Calbiochem. Blood was collected from three healthy adult volunteers in 10 mm sodium citrate, from which resting human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) were isolated by density-gradient centrifugation using Lymphoprep (Invitrogen). The interface containing a mixed white cell population was washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and monocytes and macrophages were removed by adherence to plastic in complete RPMI medium. The nonadherent cells (PBLs) were re-suspended in complete RPMI medium and used within 12 h of isolation. Two to five analyses were performed on each donor spanning at least 1 month. Flow Cytometry and Fluorescence Microscopy—Surface expression of CD3ϵ chain, γδ TCR, and αβ TCR were routinely evaluated by FACS using direct staining with immunofluorescent antibodies. Cultured cells and PBLs were washed twice with FACS buffer (5 mm EDTA, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin containing phosphate-buffered saline), and incubated on ice for 30 min with anti-Siglec antibodies, S7, or K8 (38Zhang J.Q.

For FACS analysis, after washing twice with FACS buffer, cells were first incubated with red phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG mAb on ice for an additional 30 min and then with FITC-labeled anti-CD3ϵ chain, γδ TCR, or αβ TCR. For immunofluorescence microscopy, cells were first incubated with anti-Siglec antibodies, and after washing twice with FACS buffer, were incubated for 30 min on ice with Alexa fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG mAb (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Cells were then incubated for an additional 30 min with anti-CD3ϵ antibodies labeled with Texas Red X using Zenon Mouse IgG-labeling kits (Molecular Probes) and then washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Stained cells were mounted on glass slides with Vectashield Hard Set Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) to reduce photobleaching during observation. In all cases, isotype-matched monoclonal antibodies were used as a negative control. Expression Constructs—Expression constructs of Siglec-7 and -9 with a FLAG tag epitope at the C terminus were constructed as follows. The entire coding sequences of Siglec-7 and -9 were amplified by PCR using cDNA from peripheral blood as a template, with respective sets of specific primers, and KOD polymerase HiFi (Novagen, Milwaukee, WI). Primers used were 5′-AAAAGGAAAAGCGGCCGCACCTCCAACCCCAGATATGC-3′ and 5′-CGCGGATCCTTGGGGATCTTGATCTC-3′ for Siglec-7 and 5′-AAAAGGAAAAGCGGCCGCACCTCTAACCCCAGACATGC-3′ and 5′-CGCGGATCCCTGTGGATCTTGATCTCCGAG-3′ for Siglec-9. The PCR products were inserted into the NotI/BamHI site of the pCMV Tag 4B vector (Stratagene, San Diego, CA) to produce FLAG tag epitope fusion proteins. Mutant constructs with Arg124 to Ala substitution on Siglec-7 and Arg120 to Ala substitution on Siglec-9 were also prepared, because these substitutions have already been shown to eliminate sialic acid binding (11Angata T. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22127-22135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 12Angata T. Varki A. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The respective nucleotide substitutions for the Arg to Ala mutation in Siglec-7 and -9 were generated by crossover PCR, and the corresponding expression vectors were constructed as described above. The sequences of all expression constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Generation of Stable Expressing Cells—Jurkat cells were washed twice with RPMI medium, and added at a final density of 3 × 107/ml cells (0.4 ml) to a 0.4-cm gap cuvette (Invitrogen) containing 30 μg of the desired plasmid DNA. Electroporation was then carried out at 250 V, 950 microfarads with the use of a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad). Cells were immediately transferred to a small tissue culture plate with RPMI containing 5% FCS, and cultured for 16-18 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. To establish three independent clones, we performed transfection more than three times on each expression construct. Cells were plated at various dilutions in 12-well plates with complete RPMI medium containing 1 mg/ml G418 to generate stable cell lines. Three weeks later, clones were transferred and expanded. Expression of Siglec-7 or -9 was confirmed by FACS analysis. Transient Expression of Siglecs and NFAT Luciferase Assays—Jurkat cells, prepared as described above, were electroporated (250 V, 950 microfarads) with a total of 30 μg of plasmid DNA comprising the siglec expression vector and/or empty vector as a control. After 16-18 h of incubation at 37 °C with RPMI containing 5% FCS, viable cells were purified with Histoplaque (Sigma-Aldrich). Following TCR stimulation and incubation for 48 h in RPMI containing 10% FCS, the cells were subjected to FACS analysis, and phosphorylation status was determined by immunoblot. For NFAT luciferase assays involving transient expression of Siglec-7 or -9, Jurkat cells (1.2 × 107) were electroporated with a total of 30 μg of empty vector or Siglec-7 or Siglec-9 expression constructs, 20 μg of NFAT-luciferase reporter constructs (BD Biosciences), and 5 μg of pR-TK control constructs (Promega). For NFAT-luciferase assay using Jurkat cells stably expressing Siglec-7 or Siglec-9, 20 μg of NFAT-luciferase reporter constructs and 5 μg of pR-TK control constructs were electroporated (250 V, 950 microfarads) into 3 × 107 cells/ml (0.4 ml) in RPMI media of the desired cell line. Assays under each condition were performed in triplicate. After 18-h incubation in RPMI containing 5% FCS, viable cells were purified with Histoplaque and cultured in complete RPMI media for 48 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2 to be tested for analysis of Siglec expression by FACS analysis and luciferase assay. NFAT luciferase assay was performed with a Dual Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and luminometer (Monolight 3010, BD Biosciences) according to the supplier's instructions. Each experiment was repeated three or more times. Cellular Stimulation, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot Analysis—Unless otherwise indicated, Jurkat-derived cell lines (1 × 107) were incubated for different time periods with either anti-CD3 (5 μg/ml), PHA (1.25 μg/ml), or vanadate (200 μm sodium orthovanadate 0.03% H2O2 at 37 °C in 1 ml of RPMI, which inhibits phosphatase activity and increases protein tyrosine phosphorylation). Cells were then lysed at 4 °C in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, and complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture from Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). After pre-clearing for 1 h at 4 °C with protein G-Sephadex beads (Amersham Biosciences), lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG M2 beads, according to the Sigma manual. Alternatively, cell aliquots were directly lysed in Laemmli sample buffer for subsequent immunoblotting with anti-phospho ZAP70 and anti-ZAP70 antibodies. Precipitates or whole cell lysates were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences) and immunoblotted with indicated Abs. Bound Abs were visualized using Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Expression of Siglec-7 and Siglec-9 by αβ and γδ T Cells—In their initial reports Crocker and colleagues (38Zhang J.Q. Nicoll G. Jones C. Crocker P.R. J. Biol.

However, Vitale et al. (18Vitale C. Romagnani C. Falco M. Ponte M. Vitale M. Moretta A. Bacigalupo A. Moretta L. Mingari M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15091-15096Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) found no Siglec-7 expression in CD3-expressing T cells. Because our interest was to investigate the effects of Siglec-7 and -9 on TCR activation, we first confirmed their expression in peripheral blood leukocytes using antibodies to the CD3ϵ, αβ, and γδ TCR subunits. Representative results from three donors are shown in Fig. 1. As observed previously (38Zhang J.Q. Nicoll G. Jones C. Crocker P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22121-22126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 39Nicoll G. Ni J. Liu D. Klenerman P. Munday J. Dubock S. Mattei M.G. Crocker P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34089-34095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), there was clear surface expression of Siglec-7 and Siglec-9 on CD3ϵ chain-positive cells in all three donors. For the three donors, the fraction of CD3-positive cells expressing Siglec-7 and Siglec-9 varied from 3.8 to 10% and from 5.2 to 19%, respectively. Of the Siglec-positive CD3 cells, greater than 90% expressed the αβ TCR sub-units. The population of peripheral blood leukocytes expressing the γδ TCR was small and variable (0.15-1.8% of total cells) as pointed out previously (40Battistini L. Borsellino G. Sawicki G. Poccia F. Salvetti M. Ristori G. Brosnan C.F. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3723-3730PubMed Google Scholar). Although no expression of Siglec-9 was observed in the γδ T cells, one donor exhibited clear expression of Siglec-7 in ∼13% of the γδ T cells. The variation in the expression of the Siglecs in T cells was donor-specific variation, rather than assay-specific variation, because virtually identical results were seen for each donor in two to five separate analyses taken over a span of at least 1 month. Taken together, the results indicate that the majority of CD3-positive peripheral blood leukocytes expressing Siglec-7 or -9 are αβ T lymphocytes, and that the fraction of Siglec-expressing cells differs from donor to donor. Generation of Stable Siglec-7- and Siglec-9-expressing Jurkat Cells for Analysis of TCR Signaling—Jurkat cells are widely used to study TCR signal transduction. Flow cytometry analysis of Jurkat cells revealed that they do not express either Siglec-7 or Siglec-9 (not shown), making them ideal for the analysis of the affect of these receptors on TCR signaling. Accordingly, we adopted a strategy of comparing TCR signaling of native Jurkat cells with Jurkat cells that are stably or transiently expressing Siglec-7 or Siglec-9. As described in “Materials and Methods,” stable Jurkat cell lines were generated expressing FLAG-tagged Siglec-7 (Sig7) or Siglec-9 (Sig9) or neither siglec (mock-Jurkat; transfected with empty vector). Three independent clonal lines were prepared for each, with Siglec-7 and Siglec-9 expressing cells chosen to have similar levels of siglec expression by flow cytometry (see Fig. 2A for representative Sig-7 and Sig-9 clones).

https://openalex.org/W1986442052,"We show that proteomic analysis can be applied to study cartilage pathophysiology. Proteins secreted by articular cartilage were analyzed by two-dimensional SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry. Cartilage explants were cultured in medium containing [35S]methionine/cysteine to radiolabel newly synthesized proteins. To resolve the cartilage proteins by two-dimensional electrophoresis, it was necessary to remove the proteoglycan aggrecan by precipitation with cetylpyridinium chloride. 50–100 radiolabeled protein spots were detected on two-dimensional gels of human cartilage cultures. Of 170 silver-stained proteins identified, 19 were radiolabeled, representing newly synthesized gene products. Most of these were known cartilage constituents. Several nonradiolabeled cartilage proteins were also detected. The secreted protein pattern of explants from 12 osteoarthritic joints (knee, hip, and shoulder) and 14 nonosteoarthritic adult joints were compared. The synthesis of type II collagen was strongly up-regulated in osteoarthritic cartilage. Normal adult cartilage synthesized little or no type II collagen in contrast to infant and juvenile cartilage. Potential regulatory molecules novel to cartilage were identified; pro-inhibin βA and processed inhibin βA (which dimerizes to activin A) were produced by all the osteoarthritic samples and half of the normals. Connective tissue growth factor and cytokine-like protein C17 (previously only identified as an mRNA) were also found. Activin induced the tissue inhibitor for metalloproteinases-1 in human chondrocytes. Its expression was induced in isolated chondrocytes by growth factors or interleukin-1. We conclude that type II collagen synthesis in articular cartilage is down-regulated at skeletal maturity and reactivated in osteoarthritis in attempted repair and that activin A may be an anabolic factor in cartilage.

Since cartilage has very limited capacity for repair, the loss is effectively irreversible. Prevalence studies show that most people over the age of 65 have some evidence of the disease (1van Saase J.L. van Romunde L.K. Cats A. Vandenbroucke J.P. Valkenburg H.A. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1989; 48: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 2Lawrence R.C. Hochberg M.C. Kelsey J.L. McDuffie F.C. Medsger Jr., T.A. Felts W.R. Shulman L.E. J. Rheumatol. 1989; 16: 427-441PubMed Google Scholar). Little is known about the molecular mechanism of cartilage destruction in OA, particularly the early events. It is thought that there is an imbalance between anabolism and catabolism of the extracellular matrix, there being an increase in catabolism. It has been suggested that this increased breakdown of matrix is due to the production of degradative enzymes such as the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and members of the disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) family (3Lohmander L.S. Ionescu M. Jugessur H. Poole A.R. Arthritis Rheum. 1999; 42: 534-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 4Tetlow L.C. Adlam D.J. Woolley D.E. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). The increase in proteinase expression may be due to inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 (Il-1) and tumor necrosis factor (4Tetlow L.C. Adlam D.J. Woolley D.E. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 5Saha N. Moldovan F. Tardif G. Pelletier J.P. Cloutier J.M. Martel-Pelletier J. Arthritis Rheum. 1999; 42: 1577-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether these degradative processes are a primary event or a secondary reaction. Articular cartilage consists mainly of extracellular matrix, the principal organic components of which are type II collagen fibers and aggregates of the large proteoglycan aggrecan. The only cells in cartilage, the chondrocytes, contribute less than 5% to the total volume (6Poole A.R. Biochem. J. 1986; 236: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) and are responsible for the synthesis and degradation of matrix components. Very little is known about the normal endogenous control mechanisms of matrix turnover in articular cartilage. To study the regulation of the synthesis of proteins in cartilage and to understand better the molecular basis of the osteoarthritic process, we have developed a method for the proteomic analysis of explanted tissue in which secreted proteins are separated using two-dimensional electrophoresis and identified by mass spectrometry (MS). We analyzed secreted proteins because the tissue is mostly composed of extracellular material and used metabolic radiolabeling to detect newly synthesized molecules. Limiting the study to secreted proteins means that only a few hundred need to be separated, which is feasible by medium format two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Since cartilage cannot be directly studied in the joint, we used explanted human articular cartilage in culture. Transcriptional analyses of normal and diseased cartilage have enabled the parallel analysis of a large complement of genes in the osteoarthritic process (7Aigner T. Zien A. Gehrsitz A. Gebhard P.M. McKenna L. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 2777-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 8Bau B. Gebhard P.M. Haag J. Knorr T. Bartnik E. Aigner T. Arthritis Rheum. 2002; 46: 2648-2657Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). However, mRNA levels do not necessarily correlate with protein expression and reveal nothing about processing or post-translational modification. A proteomic approach, in which proteins are identified and quantified directly, is therefore a valuable complement to such transcriptomic studies. Our proteomic analysis shows a marked increase of type II collagen synthesis in osteoarthritic cartilage and has revealed that articular cartilage makes two potentially regulatory molecules, activin A and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). Materials—[35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine and recombinant platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Recombinant activin A and epidermal growth factor (EGF) were from R&D Systems (Abingdon, UK), and recombinant basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) was obtained from PeproTech (London, UK). Recombinant human IL-1α was prepared in-house. The activin A enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit came from R&D Systems. Pronase E was from BDH Laboratory Supplies. DMEM and fetal calf serum were obtained from BioWhittaker (Verviers, Belgium). All other reagents were the best available grade from Sigma. Sources of Cartilage—Porcine articular cartilage was dissected from the metacarpophalangeal joints of 3–6-month-old pigs within 24 h of slaughter. Human articular cartilage was obtained from Charing Cross Hospital, Hammersmith, London and the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, Stanmore, London with approval of the appropriate local ethical committee. Informed consent was given in all cases. OA cartilage came from joint replacement operations, whereas control samples were from femoral heads removed following trauma or from individuals undergoing amputations and resections for reasons other than joint disease. Some normal cartilage specimens were from fresh postmortem autopsies performed at Algemeen Ziekenhuis Sint-Jan, Bruges, Belgium or at the Department of Rheumatology, University of Ghent, Belgium. The age range was 22–86 and 53–83 years for normal and osteoarthritic patients, respectively. Details of the OA and control samples studied are summarized in Table S1 (see supplementary material). Preparation of Cartilage Explant Conditioned Medium—Cartilage explants were dissected into serum-free DMEM (1 ml/g of cartilage) supplemented with 25 mm HEPES, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and amphotericin (2 μg/ml). The explants were washed once and left overnight in serum-free DMEM. The following day, the tissue was incubated in methionine/cysteine-free DMEM (30 min) and then in the same medium containing [35S]methionine/cysteine (200 μCi/ml/g of cartilage) for 5 h. Precipitation of Proteoglycans with Cetyl Pyridinium Chloride (CPC)—Glycosaminoglycan content was estimated as chondroitin sulfate using the dimethyl methylene blue assay (9Farndale R.W. Sayers C.A. Barrett A.J. Connect. Tissue Res. 1982; 9: 247-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). Whale and shark chondroitin sulfate (Sigma) was used as a standard. A 5% aqueous (w/v) cetylpyridinium chloride solution was prepared, and 3 mg of CPC/mg of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) were added to each sample (unless otherwise stated). After 30 min at room temperature, the proteoglycan/CPC-containing precipitate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was removed. Samples for two-dimensional electrophoresis were dialyzed (100-kDa cut off) against water at 4 °C overnight and then lyophilized. The pellets were washed with 0.4 m sodium acetate in 90% ethanol and 90% ethanol to remove CPC and sodium acetate, respectively. The residual proteoglycan-rich pellet was mixed with 4 volumes of sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and then run on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—The lyophilized residues were dissolved in 9.5 m urea, 1% (w/v) dithiothreitol, 2% CHAPS, and 0.5% carrier ampholyte buffer (Amersham Biosciences) supplemented with proteinase inhibitors and loaded into 13-cm-long linear pH 3–10 immobilized pH gradient dry strip (Amersham Biosciences) by in-gel rehydration. Samples (50–100 μg) were isoelectrically focused using a Multiphor II flatbed electrophoresis system (Amersham Biosciences) at 300 V for 1 min, then ramped to 3500 V for 1.5 h, and then kept at 3500 V for 3.5 h. Prior to the second dimension separation, disulfide bonds were reduced by incubating the immobilized pH gradient strips for 15 min with 65 mm dithiothreitol in equilibration buffer (2% SDS, 6 m urea, 30% v/v glycerol, and l50 mm Tris, pH 8.8). Free SH-groups were alkylated by treatment with 260 mm iodoacetamide in equilibration buffer for 15 min. Following equilibration, the strips were transferred to a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel (Laemmli (10Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) without stacking gel) and run at 8 mA. Gels were fixed and silver-stained using a mass spectrometry-compatible protocol (11Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar). After staining, gels were soaked for 2 h in 3% glycerol and dried prior to visualization of metabolically radiolabeled proteins by autoradiography. Quantification of Protein Expression—The autoradiograms were scanned using a Bio-Rad 710 imaging densitometer, and the autoradiographic patterns were analyzed using Phoretix 2D software (version 6.01; Nonlinear Dynamic Ltd., Newcastle, UK). The area and pixel intensity of each spot were measured, enabling calculation of individual spot volumes, which were expressed as a percentage of the integrated spot volume for the entire gel. Mass Spectrometry—The dried gels were rehydrated, and silver-stained features matching radiolabeled spots were excised as described (12Westbrook J.A. Yan J.X. Wait R. Dunn M.J. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In-gel trypsinolysis was performed using an Investigator Progest (Genomic Solutions, Huntingdon, UK) robotic digestion system, as described previously (13Wait R. Gianazza E. Eberini I. Sironi L. Dunn M.J. Gemeiner M. Miller I. Electrophoresis. 2001; 22: 3043-3052Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Tandem electrospray mass spectra were recorded using a Q-Tof hybrid quadrupole/orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight spectrometer (Waters, Manchester, UK) interfaced to a Waters CapLC capillary chromatograph. Samples were dissolved in 0.1% aqueous formic acid, injected onto a Pepmap C18 column (300 μm × 0.5 cm; LC Packings, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), and eluted into the electrospray with an acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid gradient (5–70% acetonitrile over 20 min). Data-dependent MS/MS acquisitions were performed on precursors with charge states of 2, 3, or 4 over a survey mass range of 540–1200. Known trypsin autolysis products and keratin-derived precursor ions were automatically excluded. Proteins were identified by correlation of uninterpreted tandem mass spectra to entries in SwissProt/TREMBL, using ProteinLynx Global Server (14Wait R. Miller I. Eberini I. Cairoli F. Veronesi C. Battocchio M. Gemeiner M. Gianazza E. Electrophoresis. 2002; 23: 3418-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). One missed cleavage per peptide was allowed, and the fragment ion tolerance was set to 100 ppm. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was assumed, but other potential modifications were not considered in the first pass search. All matching spectra were reviewed manually, and in cases in which the score reported by ProteinLynx global server was less than 100, additional searches were performed against the NCBI non-redundant data base using MASCOT, which utilizes a robust probalistic scoring algorithm (15Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6814) Google Scholar). Isolation of Chondrocytes—Chondrocytes were isolated from the cartilage by digestion with Pronase E (1 mg/ml/g of cartilage) for 30 min at 37 °C followed by collagenase (1 mg/ml/g of cartilage) for 5 h at 37 °C. The digest was strained and then centrifuged at 500 × g for 8 min. Pellets were washed twice and then resuspended in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with 25 mm HEPES, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and amphotericin (2 μg/ml). Cells were counted and plated on 12-well plates (diameter of 22.6 mm) at a density of 2.5 million cells/well (100% confluent). Encapsulation of Chondrocytes in Alginate—Chondrocytes from the femoral condyle of a patient with OA were isolated by incubating cartilage with Pronase E (1 mg/ml) for 30 min followed by collagenase (1 mg/ml) overnight. The digest was strained and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min. The pellet was washed twice with DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Cells were counted and resuspended in 1.2% (w/v) (Keltone® LV, ISP Alginates, Tadworth, UK) in 0.15 m NaCl at a density of 4 × 106 cells/ml, which was passed dropwise through a 25-gauge needle into 102 mm CaCl2. After 10 min of polymerization, beads were washed twice in 0.15 m NaCl and finally in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and HEPES. The cells were cultured for 5 weeks in the same medium in a humid atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C. The medium was replaced twice weekly. Stimulation of Chondrocytes in Alginate—After 5 weeks of alginate culture, 30 beads (∼0.75 × 106 cells in 30 beads) were reseeded into a 24-well plate and cultured in 500 μl of DMEM supplemented with HEPES overnight. The following day, the beads were washed twice with the same medium and stimulated with either activin A (R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK) (100 ng/ml) or TGFβ (PeproTech EC Ltd., London, UK) (10 ng/ml) for 48 h. Western Blotting for TIMP-1—The harvested conditioned medium was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and subjected to SDS-PAGE with 12% (w/v) acrylamide gel. The proteins separated in the gel were electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and reacted with sheep anti-human TIMP-1 (from Professor Hideaki Nagase, Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-(sheep IgG) IgG (DAKO A/S, Glostrup, Denmark). Immunoreactive TIMP-1 was visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Chondrocytes were serum-depleted for 5 h and then stimulated for 24 h. RNA was isolated from the cells using RNeasy mini-columns (Qiagen Ltd., Crawley, UK) and reverse-transcribed into DNA using Superscript II (Invitrogen). PCR amplification was performed using PuRe Taq ready-to-go PCR beads (Amersham Biosciences). The primers used for inhibin βA subunit were 5′-CCTCCCAAAGGATGTACCCAAC-3′ (sense strand) and 5′-GTGATGATCTCCGAGGTCTGCT-3′ (antisense strand). The primers were derived from the human sequence of activin βA-chain (accession number NM_002192). Two-dimensional Electrophoresis of Proteins Secreted by Articular Cartilage, the Need for Proteoglycan Removal—In initial two-dimensional electrophoresis experiments, it was found that proteins secreted by cartilage explants did not focus in the first dimension. This was probably due to the presence of highly anionic proteoglycans, particularly aggrecan, interfering with isoelectric focusing. Aggrecan was therefore removed by precipitation with the cationic detergent CPC (16Laurent T. Scott J.E. Nature. 1964; 202: 661-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The GAG content of medium conditioned by culturing cartilage (as estimated with the dimethyl methylene blue assay) varied but was normally around 200 μg/ml for porcine and 100 μg/ml for human material. After the addition of CPC, precipitates were centrifuged, and both the supernatants and the proteoglycan-rich pellets were analyzed by one-dimensional electrophoresis (Fig. 1a). The addition of 1 mg of CPC/mg of GAG removed about 80% of the GAG from porcine cartilage conditioned medium (Fig. 1b), but some smaller proteins (molecular mass less than 30 kDa) were lost from the supernatant and were found in the precipitate (Fig. 1a). When 2–4 mg of CPC/mg of GAG were added, more than 95% of the GAG was precipitated, and little silver-stainable protein was present in the pellet, although cartilage link protein was identified by HPLC MS/MS (Fig. 1a, arrow). Precipitation was carried out at room temperature since nonspecific co-precipitation of several proteins was observed at 4 °C (data not shown). For routine use, it was decided to add 3 mg of CPC/mg of GAG, and the medium was left for 30 min at room temperature. After centrifugation, the medium was dialyzed, and the proteins secreted by porcine cartilage were then well resolved by two-dimensional electrophoresis (see supplementary material, Fig. S1 and Table S2). Two-dimensional Electrophoresis of Proteins Secreted from Human Cartilage—Human cartilage was dissected from fresh surgical samples, washed overnight with serum-free DMEM to remove extraneous proteins, and then metabolically radiolabeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 5 h. CPC precipitation was carried out as described above. Altogether, 12 osteoarthritic samples and 17 controls with macroscopically normal cartilage were analyzed (Supplementary Table S1). Several hundred protein spots were usually observable on the silver-stained gels, of which 170 were excised, digested in-gel, and identified by HPLC MS/MS (see supplementary material, Fig. S2 and Table S3). Many of these were not chondrocyte-derived but were plasma or other proteins originating from synovial fluid and blood cells (e.g. hemoglobin and carbonic anhydrase). The autoradiographic patterns representing newly synthesized chondrocyte proteins were simpler, with between 50 and 100 well focused protein spots (depending on the sample loading) being observable. A typical autoradiographic pattern from cultured osteoarthritic cartilage is shown in Fig. 2. 19 radiolabeled proteins were identified by HPLC-MS/MS (Fig. 2). These are listed in Table I, together with some nonlabeled cartilage proteins and several radiolabeled proteins, which were absent from the two-dimensional pattern but were detected by one-dimensional electrophoresis. Many are present on the two-dimensional gel (Fig. 2) as multiple gel spots because of glycosylation or other modifications. The reproducibility of the two-dimensional patterns is shown by comparison of seven autoradiograms from normal and OA joints representing a wide age range (Fig. 3).Table IProteins identified from human osteoarthritic cartilage explant medium by one-dimensional/two-dimensional electrophoresis and HPLC MS/MSIdentified proteinElectrophoresisa1D, one dimensional; 2D, two dimensional electrophoresis.RadiolabeledbY, yes; N, noMatrix proteinsASPICcASPIC, acidic secreted protein in cartilage.2DYCartilage intermediate layer2DNprotein (CILP)Chondroadherin2DNClusterin2DYCollagen II proα and α chain2DYCollagen VI2DYCollagen XI2DNCOMPdCOMP, cartilage oligomeric protein.2DY/NFibromodulin2DNFibronectin1DYLumican2DYOsteonectin2DYYKL-392DYYKL-402DYProteinases and inhibitorsCathepsin L2DYMMP-11DYMMP-22DYMMP-32DYTIMP-12DYTIMP-22DYRegulatory moleculesComplement factor B2DYCTGF2DYCytokine-like protein C-172DYInhibin βA2DYProinhibin βA2DYa 1D, one dimensional; 2D, two dimensional electrophoresis.b Y, yes; N, noc ASPIC, acidic secreted protein in cartilage.d COMP, cartilage oligomeric protein.

Proteins indicated are TIMP-1 (a), YKL-39 (b), collagen type II C-propeptide (c), inhibin βA (d), and procollagen C-proteinase enhancer (e) collagen type VI (f).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Lumican and clusterin were abundantly present in multiple isoelectric forms and hindered detection of other proteins migrating to the same region of the gel. For example, MMP-2 and MMP-3 were sometimes obscured by lumican. MMP-1 was not observed on the two-dimensional gels but may be hidden in the lumican cluster since it was identified by MS after one-dimensional electrophoresis (Table I). Relative expression levels of these MMPs in OA and control samples were therefore difficult to assess from the two-dimensional gel patterns. Expression of YKL-40 (also known as cartilage glycoprotein 39 and chitinase-3-like protein 1) is reportedly increased in OA cartilage (see Refs. 21Aigner T. Bertling W. Stoss H. Weseloh G. von der Mark K. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 91: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 24Hojima Y. van der Rest M. Prockop D.J. J. Biol.

Res. 2001; 56: 417-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, we found its production variable; it was detected in 12/14 adult controls and in 4/12 OA samples. In contrast, the related protein YKL-39 was a consistent feature of the two-dimensional patterns in both normal and OA cartilage. Two interesting potentially regulatory molecules, inhibin βA and CTGF, were identified. These proteins have not previously been described in articular cartilage (see below). Synthesis of Collagen Type II Is Increased in Cartilage Explants from Young or OA Subjects—In the osteoarthritic sample shown in Fig. 2, two high molecular mass metabolically labeled spots (apparent molecular mass >116 kDa) were identified as type II collagen. The larger species was presumed to be the pro-α-chain, and the smaller was presumed to be the processed α-chain. The type II collagen C-terminal propeptide was detected in 1–3 isoelectric forms of about 35 kDa (Figs. 2 and 3). Procollagen C-proteinase enhancer protein was also detected, but the C-proteinase itself was not found. The OA explants (Figs. 2 and 3a) were clearly synthesizing and processing type II collagen. Inspection of the two-dimensional patterns from 12 osteoarthritic and 17 normal samples listed in Supplementary Table S1 showed that the collagen II α-chain and the C-propeptide were made by most of the OA samples but not by the normal adult controls (Figs. 2 and 3, a, e, and f). Because the pro-α-chain and α-chain spots often focused poorly, the normalized spot volume of the C-propeptide was used as a measure of type II collagen synthesis (Fig. 4). The C-propeptide was a prominent feature in 9 out of 12 OA samples (0.4–6.3% of total spot volume). It was undetectable in one and only weakly present in two others (about 0.1% of total spot volume). In samples from control adult cartilage, the C-propeptide either was undetectable or comprised less than 0.3% of total spot volume. In contrast, cartilage from two very young subjects (7 weeks and 6 years) synthesized significant amounts of collagen type II α-chain and C-propeptide (Fig. 3, b and c). The latter was also just detectable in a further sample from a 13 year old (Fig. 3d). Newly synthesized type II collagen and its C-terminal propeptide were also prominent in the medium of cultured explants of porcine cartilage (see supplementary material, Fig. S1 and Table S2). The porcine cartilage was from animals that were 3–6 months old at slaughter (i.e. skeletally immature). Taken together, these results suggest that in healthy cartilage type II collagen, synthesis declines with skeletal maturity but may be reactivated in OA. Secretion of the βA-chain of Activin/Inhibin by OA Cartilage Explants—A diagonal line of spots with molecular masses around 45 kDa was identified as pro-inhibin βA by HPLC MS/MS (Figs. 2 and 3). A single spot at 14 kDa corresponded to mature inhibin βA. The increasing mass and acidity of the 45-kDa spot chain is consistent with complex or hybrid type N-glycosylation, and inspection of the sequence reveals a single Asn-X-Thr N-linked glycosylation sequence (Asn-165). By contrast, the fully processed form, which lacks this consensus glycosylation site, is observed as a single spot in a position consistent with its calculated mass and pI (12,976/7.1). Inhibin βA-chains homodimerize by disulfide bonding to form activin A or heterodimerize with inhibin α-chains to form inhibin A. Since no inhibin α-chains or other types of β-chain were detected, presumably only activin A (a βA-βA homodimer) is present. Proinhibin βA was secreted by all the OA explants, and the mature protein was present in 10/12 samples. The production of proinhibin βA and inhibin βA in adult control samples was variable and only detected in half of the samples. Production was detectable in the samples from the three youngest subjects (7 weeks, 6 years, and 13 years) (Fig. 3, b, c, and d). Activin A Is Induced by Growth Factors and Cytokines— Activin is produced by cultured fibroblasts and keratinocytes in response to stimulation by growth factors or the inflammatory cytokines IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α (17Hubner G. Werner S. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 228: 106-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Serum-starved monolayers of human chondrocytes were therefore treated for 24 h with IL-1, activin A, TGFβ1, FGF-2, PDGF, or EGF to identify potential mediators of pro-inhibin βA induction in cartilage. All of these agents, including activin A itself, induced activin A mRNA (Fig. 5a). The concentration of activin A protein in the culture medium was also increased by these stimuli; IL-1 and TGFβ caused the highest increase, consistent with their effect on the mRNA (Fig. 5b). The sample containing activin A was not assayed for protein. Activin A Induces TIMP-1 Protein in Chondrocytes—Since activin A is a member of the TGFβ family, and TGFβ is known to induce expression of TIMP-1 in chondrocytes (18Gunther M.

We have shown previously that SMC differentiation is regulated by RhoA-dependent activation of serum response factor (SRF). Because S1P is a strong activator of RhoA, we hypothesized that S1P would stimulate SMC differentiation. Treatment of primary rat aortic SMC cells with S1P activated RhoA as measured by precipitation with a glutathione S-transferase-rhotekin fusion protein. In SMC and 10T½ cells, S1P treatment up-regulated the activities of several transiently transfected SMC-specific promoters, and these effects were inhibited by the Rho-kinase inhibitor, Y-27632. S1P also increased smooth muscle α-actin protein levels in SMC but had no effect on SRF binding to the smooth muscle α-actin CArG B element. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR showed that S1P treatment of SMC or 10T½ cells did not increase the mRNA level of either of the recently identified SRF co-factors, myocardin or myocardin-related transcription factor-A (MRTF-A). MRTF-A protein was expressed highly in SMC and 10T½ cultures, and importantly the effects of S1P were inhibited by a dominant negative form of MRTF-A indicating that S1P may regulate the transcriptional activity of MRTF-A. Indeed, S1P treatment increased the nuclear localization of FLAG-MRTF-A, and the effect of MRTF-A overexpression on smooth muscle α-actin promoter activity was inhibited by dominant negative RhoA. S1P also stimulated SMC growth by activating the early growth response gene, c-fos. This effect was not attenuated by Y-27632 but could be inhibited by the MEK inhibitor, UO126. S1P enhanced SMC growth through ERK-mediated phosphorylation of the SRF co-factor, Elk-1, as measured by gel shift and Elk-1 activation assays. Taken together these results demonstrate that S1P activates multiple signaling pathways in SMC and regulates proliferation by ERK-dependent activation of Elk-1 and differentiation by RhoA-dependent activation of MRTF-A.

However, the cell signaling mechanisms by which these stimuli regulate the expression of the SMC differentiation marker genes such as SM α-actin, SM22, and SM myosin heavy chain are not well understood. The transcription factor, serum response factor (SRF), is clearly involved in regulating SMC-specific transcription, (1Mack C.P. Owens G.K. Circ.

We have shown that signaling through the small GTPase, RhoA, regulates SMC-specific transcription through SRF-dependent mechanisms, (15Mack C.P. Somlyo A.V. Hautmann M. Somlyo A.P. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 341-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) and we hypothesize that signaling through RhoA may integrate some of the diverse signals that regulate SMC phenotype. The lipid agonist, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), has recently been shown to have interesting effects on vascular development and SMC growth and migration (see Refs. 18Kluk M.J. Hla T. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar and 19Hobson J.P. Rosenfeldt H.M. Barak L.S. Olivera A. Poulton S. Caron M.G. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Science. 2001; 291: 1800-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar for reviews). S1P is present in high concentrations in serum and platelets and has been shown to affect a variety of important vascular processes by binding specifically to the S1P subfamily of the G-protein-coupled Edg receptors (16Yatomi Y.

S1P receptors are found on SMC and endothelial cells (EC), and many studies have shown that S1P can stimulate growth and migration in these and other cell types (17Ryu Y. Takuwa N. Sugimoto N.

S1P has been shown to stimulate angiogenesis, enhance angiogenic responses to basic fibroblast growth factor, and differentiate EC cultures into endothelial tubes (23Lee O.H. Kim Y.M. Lee Y.M.

Interestingly, S1P induces vessel maturation in many model systems by increasing EC adhesive interactions and pericyte/SMC investment indicating that it may be important for the full development of larger vessels (25Liu Y.

S1P-dependent signaling is fairly complex because of the expression of multiple S1P receptor isoforms (S1P1 through S1P5) that couple to several different G-proteins (see Refs. 18Kluk M.J. Hla T. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 32Windh R.T. Lee M.J. Hla T. An S. Barr A.J. Manning D.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 288-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar for reviews). S1P receptors 1, 2, and 3 have been studied in a variety of heterologous systems to identify receptor-specific actions, and it is thought that the effects of S1P on cell function are mainly determined by receptor subtype expression (28Siehler S. Manning D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 29Takuwa Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). S1P1, which is highly expressed in EC, couples almost exclusively to Gi and stimulates cell growth through activation of Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase, cell survival through AKT, and cell migration through activation of Rac1 (21Lee H. Goetzl E.J. An S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C612-C618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Wang F. Van Brocklyn J.R. Hobson J.P. Movafagh S. Zukowska-Grojec Z. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Biol.

Science. 2001; 294: 1875-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). In contrast, S1P2, which is expressed highly in adult medial SMC, couples only weakly to Gi but strongly activates the small GTPase, RhoA, by coupling to G12/13 (18Kluk M.J. Hla T. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 32Windh R.T. Lee M.J. Hla T. An S. Barr A.J. Manning D.R. J. Biol.

Activation of RhoA in SMC leads to increased actin polymerization and cellular contractility and can promote or inhibit SMC migration depending upon the model system studied (34Sugimoto N. Takuwa N.

S1P3 can also activate RhoA under some conditions, and both S1P2 and S1P3 have been shown to stimulate phospholipase C by activating Gq (31Hla T. Lee M.J. Ancellin N. Paik J.H. Kluk M.J.

Some evidence suggests that S1P may also act as an intracellular signaling molecule, but little is known about its putative role as such (38Hla T. Pharmacol. Res. 2003; 47: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The direct effects of S1P on SMC differentiation have not been addressed, yet several lines of evidence suggest that S1P signaling may be important for regulating this process. First, the expression pattern and G-protein-coupling properties of S1P1 and S1P2 correlate very well with the growth and migration properties of different SMC phenotypes. For example, although adult medial SMC express little if any S1P1, this growth-coupled receptor is expressed highly in medial SMC during development and in intimal SMC (18Kluk M.J. Hla T. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In fact, overexpression of S1P1 in adult medial SMC can restore growth responsiveness of SMC to S1P (18Kluk M.J. Hla T. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In contrast, S1P2 is highly expressed in medial SMC, and stimulation of this receptor inhibits SMC migration and stimulates SMC contraction (18Kluk M.J. Hla T. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 39Rosenfeldt H.M. Amrani Y. Watterson K.R. Murthy K.S. Panettieri Jr., R.A. Spiegel S.

Circulation. 2003; 108: 342-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Second, S1P1 targeted mice die of hemorrhage at around embryonic day 13.5 because of lack of vessel maturation with significant impairment of SMC investment of vessels (25Liu Y. Wada R. Yamashita T. Mi Y. Deng C.X. Hobson J.P. Rosenfeldt H.M. Nava V.E. Chae S.S. Lee M.J. Liu C.H. Hla T. Spiegel S. Proia R.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 951-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). This SMC phenotype may be secondary to effects on EC (41Allende M.L. Yamashita T. Proia R.L. Blood. 2003; 102: 3665-3667Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), but S1P1 deletion may also have cell autonomous effects on SMC during development. Finally, S1P is a strong activator of RhoA in cells expressing S1P2 (33An S. Zheng Y. Bleu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 288-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 36Ishii I. Ye X. Friedman B. Kawamura S. Contos J.J. Kingsbury M.A. Yang A.H. Zhang G. Brown J.H. Chun J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25152-25159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Because we have previously shown that SMC differentiation marker gene expression is positively regulated by RhoA-dependent activation of SRF (15Mack C.P. Somlyo A.V. Hautmann M. Somlyo A.P. Owens G.K. J. Biol.

The goals of the current study were to determine the extent to which S1P regulates SMC differentiation and to identify the signaling mechanisms by which S1P stimulates changes in gene expression in SMC. Results demonstrate that S1P increases the expression of multiple SMC differentiation marker genes by RhoA-mediated activation of SRF. Interestingly, these effects may be mediated by the newly described SRF co-factor, myocardin-related transcription factor A (MRTF-A). S1P also moderately stimulated SMC proliferation, a process that was dependent upon ERK and involved activation of another SRF co-factor, Elk-1. Cell Culture, Transient Transfections, and Reporter Assays—SMCs from rat thoracic aorta were isolated, cultured, and transfected as described previously (42Blank R.S. McQuinn T.C. Yin K.C.

In short, cells were maintained in 24-well plates in 10% serum and were transfected 24 h after plating at 70–80% confluency using the transfection reagent Superfect (Qiagen) as per protocol. The SM22 promoter (from –450 to +88), the SM α-actin promoter (from –2560 to +2784), the SM myosin heavy chain promoter (from –4,200 to +11,600) and the c-fos promoter (from –356 to +109) used in this study have been described previously (1Mack C.P.

For co-transfection experiments 100–250 ng of N19RhoA, MRTF-A, dominant negative MRTF-A, or empty pcDNA vector was included with promoter/reporter constructs. Prior to agonist treatment SMC were placed in completely serum-free media for 48 h. 10T½ cells were placed in 0.2% charcoal-treated serum (to remove active serum lipids). Cells were treated with sphingosine 1-phosphate for 24 h, and luciferase assays were performed using the Steady-Glo system (Promega). Sphingosine 1-phosphate used in these experiments was obtained from Matreya and was maintained in 4 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, which was used as a vehicle control. In some experiments cells were pre-treated with latrunculin B (0.5 μm) for 10 min prior to the addition of S1P. Relative promoter activities are expressed as the means ± S.E. computed from a set of at least three separate transfection experiments. We did not cotransfect a viral promoter/Lac Z construct as a control for transfection efficiency because we have previously shown that such constructs exhibit unknown and variable squelching effects on the SM-specific promoters, presumably because of competition for common transcription factors (46Shimizu R.T.

Moreover, we have found that inclusion of such controls are unnecessary in that variations in transfection efficiency between independent experimental samples is routinely very small (<10%) (46Shimizu R.T.

RhoA and ERK Activity Assays—The pull-down assay used to measure RhoA activity has been previously described (47Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar). In short, cell lysates were rotated with 40 μg of a GST-rhotekin Rho binding domain fusion protein immobilized to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 45 min at 4 °C in binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm MgCl2). Beads were washed three times (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm MgCl2) and resuspended in 2× Laemmli buffer. Proteins were separated on a 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to 0.2 μm polyvinylidene difluoride (Bio-Rad). After blocking in 3% bovine serum albumin/TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20, pH 7.4) for 2 h at room temperature, blots were probed with 2 μg/ml anti-RhoA (26C4) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. Loading controls (typically 10%) are taken from each lysate sample prior to pull downs. For ERK assays, equal amounts of S1P-treated and control cell lysates were run on a 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. ERK activity was then measured using an activation-specific antibody (Cell Signaling). In some experiments the MEK inhibitor UO126 was added 10 min prior to S1P addition. MRTF-A Western Blots and Constructs—Cell lysates were prepared from rat aortic SMC, 10T½ cells, NIH3T3 fibroblasts, and A7r5 rat fibroblasts. Seventy-five μg of protein was separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed for MRTF-A with a polyclonal MRTF-A antibody that was a generous gift of Richard Treisman (Cancer Research UK, London, UK). The Wt and δN MRTF-A constructs were a generous gift of Da-Zhi Wang (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). The dominant negative MRTF-A mutation (lacking the trans-activation domain) was generated by sub-cloning amino acids 1–631 into pcDNA3.1. Quantitative PCR—RNA was prepared using the RNeasy kit with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen) per the manufacturer's instructions, and RNA was quantified by Ribogreen Assay (Molecular Probes). One μg of RNA was used in a QPCR reaction containing 5 units of Reverse-iT RTase blend (Abgene) and 2× Absolute QPCR mix (Abgene). For rat myocardin amplification and detection, 0.05 μg of forward (5′-CCAGCCCCCATCCTATGAA-3′) and 0.05 μg of reverse (5′-GGAGTTCGTCCATCTGCTGA-3′) primers and 0.7 μm myocardin Taqman probe (FAM-CCGAGTCATTTGCTGCTTCACTGCA-TAMRA) were used in each reaction. MRTF-A was amplified and detected using 0.05 μg of forward (5′-CAACAGCCCTTGTCCCAG-3′) and 0.05 μg of reverse (5′-GTTGCAAATGAAGGCTGAGGT-3′) primers with 1.4 μm MRTF-A Taqman probe (FAM-CTGCCCAGATGGACCTGGAGCACTAMRA). GAPDH was amplified and detected as a reference gene using 0.025 μg of forward (5′-ATGGGTGTGAACCACGAGAA-3′) and 0.025 μg of reverse (5′-GGCATGGACTGTGGTCATGA-3′) primers with 1 μm GAPDH Taqman probe (TET-TGCATCCTGCACCACCAACTGCTTAG-TAMRA). Each sample was done in triplicate; reactions were analyzed using an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector. Cycling parameters were as follows: one cycle at 48 °C for 30 min, one cycle at 95 °C for 10 min and 40 cycles (95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 1 min). All expression data were normalized to expression of GAPDH. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift and Elk-1 Activation Assays—Whole cell extracts were prepared by scraping SMC in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 5 mm NaF, 0.1 μg/ml okadaic acid, 10% glycerol, 0.4 m KCl, 0.4% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm benzamidine). Lysates were left on ice for 5–10 min, and cell debris was pelleted and discarded. Supernatants were then frozen in liquid N2 and stored at –80 °C for later use. Binding reactions were set up by combining 25 μg of lysate, a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe (20,000 cpm), and 0.25 μg dI·dC in binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol). Reactions were incubated for 30 min before loading on nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel that was pre-run at 170V for 1 h. Electrophoresis was performed at 170V in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA). Gels were dried and exposed to film for 24–72 h at –80 °C. For supershift studies, 1 μl of SRF or Elk-1 antibody (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added after 20 min of incubation. For measuring Elk-1 activation, S1P-treated and control lysates were run on a 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Phosphorylation of Elk-1 at Ser-383 was measured by probing with a phosphospecific antibody (Cell Signaling). Medial SMC are known to express high levels of S1P2, a Gα12/13-coupled receptor that signals through RhoA (18Kluk M.J. Hla T. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Because we had shown previously that activation of RhoA stimulates the expression of the SMC differentiation marker genes (15Mack C.P. Somlyo A.V. Hautmann M. Somlyo A.P. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 341-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that S1P would increase SMC differentiation marker gene expression. Results shown in Fig. 1 demonstrate that S1P increased the expression of several SMC differentiation marker genes in SMC by activating RhoA. S1P stimulated a transiently transfected SM22-luciferase promoter by more than 3-fold in primary SMC, and this effect was blocked by treatment with the Rho-kinase inhibitor, Y-27632 but not by the MEK inhibitor UO126 (Fig. 1A). The multipotent mouse embryonic 10T½ cell line has also been used to study SMC-specific transcription because several SMC-specific markers can be up-regulated by stimulation with TGF-β (48Hirschi K.K. Rohovsky S.A. D'Amore P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 805-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). S1P stimulated the SM22 promoter in 10T½ cells by greater than 4-fold. Fig. 1B demonstrates that S1P also significantly up-regulated the SM α-actin and SM myosin heavy chain promoters to a similar extent in both SMC and 10T½. Importantly, the SM22 promoter, SM α-actin promoter, and SM myosin heavy chain promoters used in these studies were shown to direct SMC-specific regulation of these genes in transgenic models (1Mack C.P. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 852-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 3Madsen C.S. Regan C.P. Hungerford J.E. White S.L. Manabe I. Owens G.K. Circ.

S1P also stimulated the expression of endogenous SM α-actin as determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1C). To determine whether the effects of S1P were mediated by an SRF dependent mechanism, we transfected a SM α-actin promoter construct that contained mutations to the CArG cis-element that mediate SRF binding. As shown in Fig. 1D, the CArG mutant construct was"
https://openalex.org/W2004433299,"Therapeutic radiation is widely used in cancer treatments. The success of radiation therapy depends not only on the radiosensitivity of tumor cells but also on the radiosensitivity of endothelial cells lining the tumor vasculature. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a critical role in protecting endothelial cells against a number of antitumor agents including ionizing radiation. Strategies designed to overcome the survival advantage afforded to endothelial cells by VEGF might aid in enhancing the efficacy of radiation therapy. In this report we examined the signaling cascade(s) involved in VEGF-mediated protection of endothelial cells against gamma-irradiation. gamma-Irradiation-induced apoptosis of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMECs) was predominantly mediated through the p38 MAPK pathway as an inhibitor of p38 MAPK (PD169316), and dominant negative mutants of p38 MAPK could significantly enhance HDMEC survival against gamma-irradiation. Inhibition of the PI3K and MAPK pathways markedly up-regulated gamma-irradiation-mediated p38 MAPK activation resulting in enhanced HDMEC apoptosis. In contrast, VEGF-treated HDMECs were protected from gamma-irradiation-induced apoptosis predominantly through the PI3K/Akt pathway. Bcl-2 expression was markedly elevated in VEGF-treated HDMECs, and it was significantly inhibited by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. HDMECs exposed to irradiation showed a significant decrease in Bcl-2 expression. In contrast, VEGF-stimulated HDMECs, when irradiated, maintained higher levels of Bcl-2 expression. Taken together our results suggest that gamma-irradiation induces endothelial cell apoptosis predominantly via the activation of p38 MAPK, and VEGF protects endothelial cells against gamma-irradiation predominantly via the PI3K-Akt-Bcl-2 signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2084483488,"The organization of the motor protein myosin into motile cellular structures requires precise temporal and spatial control. Caenorhabditis elegans UNC-45 facilitates this by functioning both as a chaperone and as a Hsp90 cochaperone for myosin during thick filament assembly. Consequently, mutations in C. elegans unc-45 result in paralyzed animals with severe myofibril disorganization in striated body wall muscles. Here, we report a new E3/E4 complex, formed by CHN-1, the C. elegans ortholog of CHIP (carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein), and UFD-2, an enzyme known to have ubiquitin conjugating E4 activity in yeast, as necessary and sufficient to multiubiquitylate UNC-45 in vitro. The phenotype of unc-45 temperature-sensitive animals is partially suppressed by chn-1 loss of function, while UNC-45 overexpression in worms deficient for chn-1 results in severely disorganized muscle cells. These results identify CHN-1 and UFD-2 as a functional E3/E4 complex and UNC-45 as its physiologically relevant substrate."
https://openalex.org/W2168187266,"The mechanisms responsible for the uptake and cellular processing of the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide are not well understood. We propose that anandamide uptake may occur via a caveola/lipid raft-related endocytic process in RBL-2H3 cells. Inhibitors of caveola-related (clathrin-independent) endocytosis reduced anandamide transport by ∼50% compared with the control. Fluorescein derived from fluorescently labeled anandamide colocalized with protein markers of caveolae at early time points following transport. In this study, we have also identified a yet unrecognized process involved in trafficking events affecting anandamide following its uptake. Following uptake of [3H]anandamide by RBL-2H3 cells, we found an accumulation of tritium in the caveolin-rich membranes. Inhibitors of both anandamide uptake and metabolism blocked the observed enrichment of tritium in the caveolin-rich membranes. Mass spectrometry of subcellular membrane fractions revealed that the tritium accumulation observed in the caveolin-rich membrane fraction was not representative of intact anandamide, suggesting that following metabolism by the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), anandamide metabolites are rapidly enriched in caveolae. Furthermore, HeLa cells, which do not express high levels of FAAH, showed an accumulation of tritium in the caveolin-rich membrane fraction only when transfected with FAAH cDNA. Western blot and immunocytochemistry analyses of RBL-2H3 cells revealed that FAAH was localized in intracellular compartments distinct from caveolin-1 localization.

Nature. 1993; 365: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (4048) Google Scholar). AEA has received much attention in the last decade due to its ability to mimic the effects of the plant-derived cannabinoids such as Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, the major active component of marijuana (3Deutsch D.G.

To terminate endocannabinoid signaling, AEA undergoes a carrier-mediated uptake process that is rapid, temperature-dependent, saturable at 37 °C, inhibited by select fatty acid amide derivatives or cannabinoids in a concentration-dependent fashion, and independent of ion gradients or ATP (ATP hydrolysis) (6DiMarzo V.

However, AEA uptake occurs in cells that do not express FAAH, indicating that mechanisms other than hydrolysis by FAAH are involved in AEA transport (7Hillard C.J. Edgemond W.S. Jarrahian A.

Lipid rafts are specialized plasma membrane microdomains that are enriched in cholesterol, sphingolipids, arachidonic acid, and plasmenylethanolamine (18Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2075-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Related domains, caveolae, are non-clathrin-coated flask-shaped invaginations in the plasma membrane that have been identified by electron microscopy and other biochemical techniques (19Pike L.J.

The existence of caveolae is well substantiated, and they have been implicated in serving many functions, including the organization of key signaling proteins, cholesterol transport, endocytosis, and potocytosis (22Sowa G. Pypaert M. Sessa W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14072-14077Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This study shows that the cellular accumulation of AEA is possibly linked to a caveola-related process. Disruption of caveolae/lipid rafts by cholesterol depletion as well as treatment with agents known to inhibit caveola-related endocytic processes reduced [3H]AEA uptake in RBL-2H3 cells. Furthermore, fluorescence derived from a fluorescently labeled AEA analog was colocalized with markers for caveolae following uptake. We next determined how the intracellular processing of AEA might take place following uptake by utilizing immunocytochemistry studies, biochemical analysis of subcellular fractions, and molecular approaches. Our data show that the metabolites of AEA accumulated in the caveolin-1-rich membrane fraction obtained from sucrose gradient centrifugation. This phenomenon was not observed in cells lacking detectable FAAH. Immunocytochemistry studies of the RBL-2H3 cells confirmed that FAAH is localized to intracellular membrane compartments (11Cravatt B.F. Giang D.K. Mayfield S.P. Boger D.L. Lerner R.A. Gilula N.B.

We propose that AEA is rapidly trafficked to intracellular compartments, where it is metabolized by FAAH, and that following hydrolysis, AEA metabolites undergo recycling to the plasma membrane, where they are enriched in domains containing caveolin-1. This study suggests a new model for AEA uptake that includes endocytic processes and furthermore implicates specialized membrane microdomains in the uptake as well as possible recycling of endocannabinoids. Cell Culture—RBL-2H3 and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, and l-glutamine. Cells were grown in a humidified environment containing 5% CO2 and held at a constant temperature of 37 °C. [3H]AEA Uptake following Endocytic Inhibitor Treatments—RBL-2H3 cells were plated at 2 × 105 cells/well in a 24-well culture plate. Twenty-four hours later, cells were washed with Krebs-Ringer Hepes (KRH) buffer (120 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Hepes, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, and 1.2 mm MgSO4, pH 7.4) and incubated for 2 h in Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen) containing genistein (200 μm) or for 30 min in KRH buffer containing nystatin (25 μg/ml)/progesterone (10 μg/ml), N-ethylmaleimide (NEM; 500 μm), or chlorpromazine (28 μm). Cells were also treated with potassium-free KRH buffer for 30 min. Control cells were incubated for 30 min in 1× KRH buffer. AM404 (100 μm) was added to the indicated groups for the final 10 min of each incubation. Following the incubations, 1 nm [3H]AEA was added to all samples and allowed to incubate for 5 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed three times with 1× KRH buffer, and Microscint-20 was added to each well. The amount of 3H present was determined using a Packard TopCount microplate scintillation and luminescence counter. Immunofluorescent Localization of SKM4-45-1—The AEA analog SKM4-45-1 was synthesized as described by Muthian et al. (23Muthian S. Nithipatikom K. Campbell W.B. Hillard C.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293: 289-295PubMed Google Scholar). RBL-2H3 cells (1.5 × 105) were plated in a 6-well cell culture plate containing a coverslip that had been coated with poly-d-lysine overnight. The next day, the cells were treated with 100 nm SKM4-45-1 for 30 s at 37 °C and then immediately fixed for 30 min at room temperature with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were washed four times with PBS. Primary antibodies directed against caveolin-1 (RDI), flotillin-1 (Transduction Laboratories), and the transferrin receptor (TfR; Pharmingen) were prepared in 0.3% Triton X-100 and 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS at dilutions of 1:2000 and added to the appropriate wells. Cells were incubated for 24 h at 4 °C. The cells were then washed three times with PBS, and the secondary antibodies were added. The Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc.) was added at a 1:1500 dilution. After incubation for 1 h, cells were washed six times with PBS. Coverslips were removed from the wells, mounted on slides using ProLong Antifade, and allowed to dry overnight. Cells were imaged by oil immersion confocal microscopy at ×60 magnification with a Nikon Diaphot 300 microscope. A Bio-Rad MRC1024 confocal system was used with a krypton (488 nm)/argon (568 nm) laser, a 522-535-nm band-pass filter, and a 588-nm long-pass filter. Images were produced as an accumulation of three scans. Subcellular Fractionation of [3H]AEA-treated Cells—Cells were grown ∼85% confluence in 150-mm culture plates and washed once with 1× KRH buffer. Cells were then incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in 100 μm AM404, 500 nm methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate, or 1× KRH buffer. [3H]AEA was added to each culture dish to yield a final concentration of 1 nm, and culture plates were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. Culture plates were washed three times with ice-cold KRH buffer. On ice, treated cells were washed with cold KRH buffer and exposed to 2.5 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA) for 20 min. On ice, cell lysates were then mixed with 2.5 ml of 80% sucrose buffer and overlaid with 4 ml of 30% sucrose buffer followed by 2 ml of 5% sucrose buffer in a Beckman Model 344059 centrifuge tube (80, 30, and 5% sucrose solutions were made in lysis buffer minus detergent). The sucrose gradients were centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 18 h at 4 °C. Fractions (1 ml) were collected, with the detergent-insoluble caveolin-rich component appearing as a milky white band in approximately the second to third fractions from the top of the gradient. A total of 11 fractions were collected from the gradient. To determine the tritium content of the fractions, 50 μl of each fraction was added to individual wells of a Packard 24-well flat-bottom white polystyrene tissue culture microplate. Microscint-20 was added to each well, and tritium was determined using a Packard TopCount microplate scintillation and luminescence counter. Protein content of individual fractions was determined using the Bradford protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad) and used to normalize fractions for protein levels. In subcellular fractionation experiments performed on HeLa cells, cells were transiently transfected in 150-mm culture plates either with rat FAAH cDNA/pBluescript II SK- (generous gift from Dr. Benjamin Cravatt, Scripps Research Institute) or with vector only using the vaccinia virus T7 expression system (24Fuerst T.R.

Biochem. 1991; 194: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Fractions were prepared for gel electrophoresis by adding a 1:1 volume of Laemmli buffer (5% bromphenol blue, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, 20% glycerol, and 2% SDS). Samples were electrophoresed for 50 min at 145 V using the Mini-Protean 3 system (Bio-Rad) after being loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Only fractions 1-9 were analyzed, as previous Western blot analysis revealed that subcellular fractions 10 and 11 taken from RBL-2H3 cells contained no significant levels of the proteins of interest (data not shown). Proteins were then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using the Bio-Rad Mini Trans-Blot system. The membrane was blocked for 24 h in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% dry milk at 4 °C. The presence of FAAH, caveolin-1, flotillin-1, the TfR, and BiP/GRP78 was detected using rabbit anti-FAAH polyclonal primary antibody (epitope VGYYETDNYTMPSPAMR), rabbit anti-caveolin-1 polyclonal primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-flotillin-1 monoclonal primary antibody, mouse anti-TfR monoclonal primary antibody, and mouse anti-BiP/GRP78 monoclonal primary antibody (Transduction Laboratories), respectively, followed either by horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) or by horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody and ECL detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were then exposed to x-ray film. Immunofluorescent Localization of FAAH—RBL-2H3 cells were plated in a 6-well cell culture plate containing a coverslip that had been coated with poly-d-lysine overnight. The next day, the cells were washed two times with PBS and then fixed for 30 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were washed four times with PBS. Primary antibodies directed against FAAH and caveolin-1 were prepared in 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS at dilutions of 1:3000 and 1:2000, respectively, and added to the appropriate wells. Cells were incubated for 48 h at 4 °C. The cells were then washed six times with PBS, and the secondary antibodies were added. The Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc.) was added at a dilution of 1:4000, and the Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody was added a dilution of 1:3000. After incubation for 1 h, cells were washed six times with PBS. Coverslips were removed from the wells, mounted on slides using ProLong Antifade, and allowed to dry overnight. Cells were imaged by oil immersion confocal microscopy at ×60 magnification with a Nikon Diaphot 300 microscope. The Bio-Rad MRC1024 confocal system was used with a krypton (488 nm)/argon (568 nm) laser, a 522-535-nm band-pass filter, and a 588-nm long-pass filter. Determination of Endogenous Cannabinoids by Liquid Chromatography/Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS/MS)—A quantitative bio-analytical method utilizing LC/MS/MS was used to measure AEA in membrane fractions (26Porter A.C. Sauer J.M. Knierman M.D. Becker G.W. Berna M.J. Bao J. Nomikos G.G. Carter P. Bymaster F.P. Leese A.B. Felder C.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 301: 1020-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Following liquid extraction with organic solvent and further purification by solid-phase extraction, samples were separated using a Phenomenex Prodigy ODS-3 column with acetonitrile/water (50:50) as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Quantification of AEA was accomplished by using m/z 348 ([M + H]+) as a precursor ion and m/z 62 as a product ion in a selected reaction monitoring mode using [3H8]anandamide as an internal standard. The lower limit of quantification for AEA was 25 pg/ml. Effect of Endocytic Inhibitors on AEA Uptake—Pretreatment of cells with nystatin and progesterone disrupts synthesis of cholesterol and cholesterol transport to the membrane, thereby disrupting caveolae (27Subtil A. Gaidarov I. Kobylarz K. Lampson M.A. Keen J.H. McGraw T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6775-6780Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). To assess the effects of cholesterol depletion and the disruption of caveolae on AEA uptake, RBL-2H3 cells were pretreated with nystatin and progesterone, and [3H]AEA uptake assays were performed (Fig. 1A). Nystatin and progesterone pretreatment reduced the specific uptake of AEA in RBL-2H3 cells by ∼50%. Genistein and NEM are both known to inhibit caveola-related endocytosis (17Puri V. Watanabe R. Singh R.D. Dominguez M. Brown J.C. Wheatley C.L. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 535-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 28Aoki T. Nomura R. Fujimoto T. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 629-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 29Schnitzer J.E. Allard J. Oh P. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: H48-H55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We pretreated RBL-2H3 cells with genistein or NEM and then, as with the nystatin and progesterone treatment, assessed [3H]AEA transport. Both genistein and NEM were found to reduce AEA uptake similar to the nystatin/progesterone treatment (Fig. 1A). Previous studies have suggested that a 20 °C temperature block may interfere with caveola-related trafficking from the plasma membrane to intracellular compartments (30Norkin L.C. Anderson H.A. Wolfrom S.A. Oppenheim A. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 5156-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 31Richards A.A. Stang E. Pepperkok R. Parton R.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1750-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). When uptake assays were performed at 18 °C, the specific uptake of AEA was again reduced by ∼50% (Fig. 1A). Treatment of cells with either chlorpromazine or potassium-free buffer, both of which are known to inhibit clathrin-dependent endocytosis, had no effect on the uptake of AEA by RBL-2H3 cells (Fig. 1B). Localization of the Fluorescent AEA Derivative SKM4-45-1—The fluorescent AEA derivative SKM4-45-1 has been shown to undergo carrier-mediated uptake presumably via the same process that transports AEA. Once taken up into cells, SKM4-45-1 undergoes rapid cleavage by nonspecific esterases to release fluorescein (23Muthian S. Nithipatikom K. Campbell W.B. Hillard C.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293: 289-295PubMed Google Scholar). RBL-2H3 cells were treated with SKM4-45-1, and uptake was allowed to take place for a period of 30 s. This early time point was chosen to provide an indication for the initial entry point of AEA into cells. After fixing SKM4-45-1-treated cells, flotillin-1, caveolin-1, or the TfR was immunofluorescently labeled, and the cells were analyzed by confocal microscopy. Fluorescein derived from SKM4-45-1 appeared to be colocalized with flotillin-1 (Fig. 2A) and caveolin-1 (Fig. 2B), markers for caveolae, when cells were fixed 30 s after treatment with SKM4-45-1. Fluorescein did not colocalize with the TfR, which is a marker for clathrin-coated pits (Fig. 2C). These data directly imply that the site of SKM4-45-1 and thus AEA entry into the cell may be at caveola/lipid raft domains and support the hypothesis that AEA uptake occurs via a caveola-related endocytic process. Accumulation of Tritium in the Caveolin-rich Membrane Fraction of RBL-2H3 Cells following AEA Uptake—Subcellular fractionation of RBL-2H3 cells was performed by sucrose gradient centrifugation (19Pike L.J. Han X. Chung K.N. Gross R.W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2075-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). A milky white band representing the detergent-insoluble caveolin-rich membrane fraction typically appeared in the second fraction taken from the top of the gradient. Western blot analysis of individual fractions confirmed an enrichment of caveolin-1 in fraction 2 (Fig. 3), suggesting that we had successfully isolated caveolin-rich membranes. Large amounts of the protein flotillin-1 are also found in caveolae/lipid rafts (32Galbiati F. Volonte D. Goltz J.S. Steele Z. Sen J. Jurcsak J. Stein D. Stevens L. Lisanti M.P. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 210: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To further verify the isolation of caveola-related membranes, we probed for flotillin-1 and were able to observe the expected enrichment in fraction 2 (Fig. 3). We also verified that both the endoplasmic reticulum marker BiP/GRP78 and the TfR were excluded from the caveolin-1-rich membrane fraction (Fig. 3). Based upon the endocytic inhibitor data above, we speculated that AEA may accumulate in cells via a caveola-related process. Thus, we determined whether AEA or its metabolites could be isolated in the caveolin-1-rich cellular fractions after uptake. Subcellular fractionation of RBL-2H3 cells was performed by sucrose gradient centrifugation following the uptake of [3H]AEA (AEA was labeled on the arachidonic acid backbone of the molecule). We quantified the amount of tritium present in each fraction collected from the gradient and normalized for the protein concentration of each fraction. Tritium profiles revealed a 20-fold enrichment of tritium in the caveolin-rich membrane fraction compared with AM404-treated cells (Fig. 4A). The anandamide uptake inhibitor AM404 and the FAAH inhibitor methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate were both found to inhibit the enrichment of tritium in the caveolin-rich membrane fraction. RBL-2H3 cells pretreated with [3H]AEA labeled on the ethanolamine portion of the molecule also displayed a tritium profile similar to that observed in Fig. 4A (data not shown). RBL-2H3 cells are known to natively express the serotonin transporter and exhibit robust serotonin uptake (33Hoffman B.J. Mezey E. Brownstein M.J. Science. 1991; 254: 579-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Following uptake by RBL-2H3 cells, serotonin should be sequestered in secretory granules and would not be expected to appear in caveolin-containing microdomains. As a control experiment, we performed fractionation experiments on RBL-2H3 cells pretreated with [3H]serotonin to exclude the possibility that the observed tritium accumulation in the caveolin-rich membrane fraction was a nonspecific general phenomenon. We observed no accumulation of serotonin-associated tritium in the caveolin-1-rich membrane fraction when RBL-2H3 cells were treated with [3H]serotonin (Fig. 4B). Cells treated with [3H]serotonin demonstrated an accumulation of tritium that appeared in more dense fractions from the gradient. To determine whether the tritium accumulation observed in the caveolin-1-rich membrane fraction represented intact AEA, we performed mass spectrometry on samples collected from the fractionation of RBL-2H3 cells that had undergone uptake of AEA at 37 °C. RBL-2H3 cells were treated with unlabeled AEA at a concentration equal to [3H]AEA used in Fig. 3 above. Membrane fractions were isolated, and the AEA content in each fraction was determined by LC/MS/MS (Fig. 5). To verify successful isolation of caveolin-rich membranes, these gradient fractions were also analyzed by Western blot analysis in parallel experiments (data not shown). In the non-AM404-treated cells (representing total uptake), we observed only small amounts of intact AEA in the caveolin-rich membranes and the other fractions (Fig. 5). These data indicate that the tritium observed in the caveolin-rich membranes (without AM404) (Fig. 4A) was most likely arachidonate derived from AEA metabolism that had been targeted to the caveolae, and not intact AEA. Those fractions isolated from cells treated with AM404, which inhibits both specific uptake and metabolism by FAAH, contained intact AEA at levels that paralleled the observed tritium profile prior to normalization (Fig. 5). Since the tritium profiles in membranes from cells treated with [3H]AEA labeled on the ethanolamine moiety displayed a profile similar to that observed for the arachidonate-labeled AEA (data not shown), both arachidonate and ethanolamine may"
https://openalex.org/W2080813906,"A dramatic reduction in the expression of a novel phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx), which incorporates cysteine instead of selenocysteine in the conserved catalytic motif was observed in a microarray analysis using cDNAs amplified from mRNA of Brca1-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts. This non-selenocysteine PHGPx named NPGPx is a cytoplasmic protein with molecular mass of ∼22 kDa and has little detectable glutathione peroxidase activity in vitro. Ectopic expression of NPGPx in Brca1-null cells that were sensitive to oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide conferred a similar resistance level to that of the wild-type cells, suggesting the importance of this protein in reducing oxidative stress. Expression of NPGPx was found in many tissues, including developing mammary gland. However, the majority of breast cancer cell lines studied (11 of 12) expressed very low or undetectable levels of NPGPx irrespective of BRCA1 status. Re-expression of NPGPx in breast cancer lines, MCF-7 and HCC1937, which have very little or no endogenous NPGPx, induced resistance to eicosapentaenoic acid (an omega-3 type of polyunsaturated fatty acid)-mediated cell death. Conversely, inhibition of the expression of NPGPx by the specific small interfering RNA in HS578T breast cancer cells that originally express substantial amounts of endogenous NPGPx increased their sensitivity to eicosapentaenoic acid-mediated cell death. Thus, NPGPx plays an essential role in breast cancer cells in alleviating oxidative stress generated from polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism.

The complex interplay among genetic susceptibility, hormones, environmental carcinogens, and dietary consumption contributes to the complexity of breast cancer development, treatment, and prevention (1Ambrosone C.B.

Interestingly, many tumor susceptibility genes that have been linked to breast carcinogenesis such as p53, ATM, PTEN, BRCA1, and BRCA2 have either direct or indirect roles in cellular defense against oxidative stress as the result of excessive ROS production without concomitant up-regulation of antioxidants (6Barzilai A.

It has been reported that BRCA1-deficient embryonic stem cells are deficient in transcriptional-coupled oxidative damage repair (11Gowen L.C. Avrutskaya A.V. Latour A.M. Koller B.H. Leadon S.A. Science. 1998; 281: 1009-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). How BRCA1 exerts its role in this repair pathway remains unclear. BRCA1 serves as a transcriptional modulator to regulate the expression of the DNA damage response genes such as GADD45 (12Zheng L. Pan H. Li S. Flesken-Nikitin A. Chen P.L. Boyer T.G. Lee W.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 13Pavelic K. Gall-Troselj K. J. Mol. Med. 2001; 79: 566-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and physically interacts with repair machinery proteins such as the Rad50-MRE11-NBS1 complex upon ionizing irradiation (14Zhong Q. Chen C.F. Li S. Chen Y. Wang C.C. Xiao J. Chen P.L. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H. Science. 1999; 285: 747-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that ROS generated by either oxidative stress or IR may lead to a similar DNA damage response mediated by BRCA1 (15Riley P.A. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1994; 65: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether BRCA1 has any direct role in mediating the removal of ROS generated by oxidative stress. Extensive studies on animal cancer models have demonstrated that different forms of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) yield pronounced effects on growth of breast cancer cells (16Welsch C.W. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 2040s-2048sPubMed Google Scholar). Omega-3 forms of PUFA such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid, which are highly enriched in fish oil, are known to inhibit proliferation of many different types of cancers (17Rose D.P. Connolly J.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1993; 85: 1743-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Because EPA has been demonstrated to increase peroxisomal β-oxidation, which generates hydrogen peroxides (18Abdi-Dezfuli F. Froyland L. Thorsen T. Aakvaag A. Berge R.K. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1997; 45: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 19Aarsland A. Lundquist M. Borretsen B. Berge R.K. Lipids. 1990; 25: 546-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 20Demoz A. Willumsen N. Berge R.K. Lipids. 1992; 27: 968-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the inhibitory effect of omega-3 PUFA has been attributed to the production of oxygen radicals and initiation of intracellular lipid peroxidation (21Stoll B.A. Br. J. Nutr. 2002; 87: 193-198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lipid peroxidation involves the introduction of the polar hydroperoxy group into the hydrophobic moiety of unsaturated fatty acid (22Kuhn H. Borchert A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 154-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The resulting hydroperoxy lipids are sources for further generation of ROS and substrates for reduction by GPx4 or phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx), a distinct member of the GPx family (22Kuhn H. Borchert A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 154-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 23Brigelius-Flohe R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 951-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). Three other members of the GPx family, cytoplasmic GPx (GPx1), gastrointestinal GPx (GPx2), and extracellular GPx (GPx3), generally prefer soluble alkyl hydroperoxides as substrates instead of hydroperoxides of complex lipid and phospholipids (24Brigelius-Flohe R.

It remains unclear how each individual GPx contributes to the elimination of oxidative stress generated from endogenous cellular respiration and metabolism of exogenous mutagens. We have identified a novel GPx that shares a similar structural domain to GPx4. The presence of cysteine instead of selenocysteine, a conserved residue of the catalytic center, prompted the name non-selenocysteine phospholipid Hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase or NPGPx. Absence of NPGPx expression was found in the majority of breast cancer cell lines tested, and reconstitution of NPGPx expression in MCF-7 and HCC1937 breast cancer cells conferred resistance to EPA-mediated cell death. Conversely, inhibition of the normal expression of NPGPx in HS578T breast cancer cells by the specific siRNA increased their sensitivity to eicosapentaenoic acid-mediated cell death. These findings suggest a potential role for NPGPx in alleviating oxidative stress induced by dietary consumption of fatty acids in breast cancer cells. Chemicals and cDNAs—H2O2 and EPA were obtained from Sigma. EPA was dissolved in 100% ethanol to yield a stock concentration of 1 g/ml. MTS assay reagents were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI) and used according to the supplier's instructions. Both mouse and human full-length NPGPx cDNA clones were obtained from ATCC with GenBank™ accession numbers BC003228 and BC032788, respectively, and sequenced to verify the authenticity. Cell Culture—Breast cancer cell lines including MCF7, MDAMB231, MDAMB468, MDAMB175-7, MDAMB361, T47D, ZR75, MDAMB435, HS0578-T, HBL100, and SKBR3 were obtained from ATCC and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), except for MCF-7 and HCC1937, which were grown in RPMI in 10% FCS. A telomerase-immortalized human diploid fibroblast cell line, HS27, was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) (25Zhong Q. Chen C.F. Chen P.L. Lee W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28641-28647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) were grown in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FCS medium. Expression and Purification of NPGPx in Escherichia coli—Hexahistidine-tagged NPGPx was overexpressed in BL21 (DE3)-codon plus E. coli bacteria at room temperature by induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Soluble protein was purified from cleared cellular lysate at 4 °C by affinity chromatography using a nickel-agarose resin. After extensive washing of the resin to remove contaminating proteins, NPGPX was eluted by the addition of imidazole, followed by extensive dialysis in the assay buffer (see below). SDS-PAGE of the purified protein exhibited a single band by Coomassie Blue staining. Glutathione Peroxidase Activity Assay—Glutathione peroxidase activity was determined by using a protocol as described (26Maiorino M. Gregolin C. Ursini F. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 448-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). All reactions were performed at 25 °C in the assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.5 mm EDTA. Each reaction contained 0.25 mm NADPH, 2.1 mm reduced glutathione, 0.5 units/ml glutathione reductase (NADPH reagent), and 300 μmtert-butyl hydroperoxide or cumene hydroperoxide (for the measurement of selenium containing or non-selenium containing glutathione peroxidase activity, respectively). Bovine glutathione peroxidase (Sigma) was used as a positive control. Varying dilutions of purified NPGPx were mixed with the assay buffer and NADPH reagent to a final volume of 1.00 ml. The reaction was then initiated by the addition of hydroperoxide. Glutathione peroxidase activity was determined by measuring the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm using a kinetic program, with an initial delay of 15 s and then readings taken every 10 s. Microarray—The microarray analysis was performed as described by Desai et al. (27Desai K.V. Xiao N. Wang W. Gangi L. Greene J. Powell J.I. Dickson R. Furth P. Hunter K. Kucherlapati R. Simon R. Liu E.T. Green J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6967-6972Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Briefly, RNA was extracted from wild type, p53–/–, and p53–/–;Brca1–/– MEFs and used as the templates for making cDNAs as probes for hybridization. The microarray chip consists of 8,680 unique genes (27Desai K.V. Xiao N. Wang W. Gangi L. Greene J. Powell J.I. Dickson R. Furth P. Hunter K. Kucherlapati R. Simon R. Liu E.T. Green J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6967-6972Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Amino Acid Alignment Analysis—Megalign DNAStar program was used to analyze amino acid sequences. Clustal analysis program was used to distinguish different class of GPx family. SMART software analysis was used to predict the consensus peptide motif. Cell Viability Assay—Procedure for fatty acid treatment was adapted from Bardon et al. (28Bardon S. Le M.T. Alessandri J.M. Cancer Lett. 1996; 99: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1–3 × 103 breast cancer cells were seeded into each well of 96-well plates for 16–24 h. The medium was changed into serum-free medium for an additional 24 h. The cells were then treated, in quadruplets, with different concentrations of EPA in 0.2% ethanol and 1% FCS. Cell viability was determined 4 days later by adding MTS reagent (Promega) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Colony Formation Assay—About 3–5 × 103 cells of mouse embryonic fibroblasts were seeded into 100-mm dishes and treated with freshly diluted H2O2 in 10% FCS. The medium was changed every 2 days for 2 weeks. Colonies were counted and the ratio of colony numbers between treated and untreated cells is expressed as percentage of survivability. Preparation of RNA for RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from either tissues or cells as instructed by the manufacturer (TRIzol, Carsbald, CA). RT-PCR was performed as described (12Zheng L. Pan H. Li S. Flesken-Nikitin A. Chen P.L. Boyer T.G. Lee W.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar).

The fusion protein was expressed and purified from bacteria for serving as antigens to generate mouse polyclonal antibodies. In addition, the purified His-tagged NPGPx protein was used as antigen to generate monoclonal antibodies following the established procedures (30Chen Y. Farmer A.A. Chen C.F. Jones D.C. Chen P.L. Lee W.H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3168-3172PubMed Google Scholar, 31Durfee T. Mancini M.A. Jones D. Elledge S.J. Lee W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 609-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These anti-NPGPx antibodies were used in immunoprecipitation (32Chen P.L. Scully P. Shew J.Y. Wang J.Y. Lee W.H. Cell. 1989; 58: 1193-1198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar), Western blotting, and immunostaining following the procedures as described (30Chen Y. Farmer A.A. Chen C.F. Jones D.C. Chen P.L. Lee W.H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3168-3172PubMed Google Scholar, 31Durfee T. Mancini M.A. Jones D. Elledge S.J. Lee W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 609-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Generation of the High Titer Retrovirus for NPGPx Expression—High titer RNA virus was achieved by placing cytomegalovirus promoter in front of an upstream 5′-terminal repeat (RU5) (33Naviaux R.K. Costanzi E. Haas M. Verma I.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5701-5705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The vector contains EGFP driven by the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter as a marker for infection. NPGPx cDNA was inserted at XhoI and HindIII sites under control of RU5. The expression plasmid was co-transfected with vesicle stomatitis virus glycoprotein expressing plasmid into HEK 293-GP2 cells, which stably expressed viral packaging proteins (gag and pol) as described (34Yee J.K. Miyanohara A. LaPorte P. Bouic K. Burns J.C. Friedmann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9564-9568Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Treatment of NPGPx siRNA—The nucleotide sequence from 318 to 338 (starting from the A of the first initiation codon, ATG), 5′-AAGTACCTGGCCCAGACTTCT-3′, of the NPGPx was selected for siRNA following the rules as described (35Elbashir S.M Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8186) Google Scholar, 36Elbashir S.M. Martinez J. Patkaniowska A. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6877-6888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar). Two complementary 21-mers of RNA were commercially synthesized (Dharmacon, Dallas, TX). HS578T human breast cancer cells were seeded at 2 × 105 into each 60-mm plate for 24 h and transfected with 0.4 nmol of NPGPx siRNA or luciferase siRNA using OligofectAMINE (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For Western analysis, cells were harvested at the designated time intervals, and whole cell lysates (20 μgof protein) were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using mouse monoclonal NPGPx antibody (GenTex, San Antonio, TX). These siRNA-treated cells were re-plated at 3 × 103 into each well of the 96-well plates after 24 h of transfection in the presence of different concentrations of EPA for the viability assay as described above. Identification of NPGPx—To search for genes regulated by BRCA1, we initiated a microarray analysis using a microchip containing about 8680 genes with cDNAs amplified from the mRNA of wild type, p53–/–, and p53–/–;Brca1–/– (or Brca1-null) MEFs. The results indicated that the expression of several genes encoding lysyl oxidase (37Kirschmann D.A. Seftor E.A. Fong S.F. Nieva D.R. Sullivan C.M. Edwards E.M. Sommer P. Csiszar K. Hendrix M.J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4478-4483PubMed Google Scholar), follistatin-like (38Welt C. Sidis Y. Keutmann H. Schneyer A. Exp. Biol. Med. 2002; 227: 724-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), Src-suppressed C kinase substrate/SSeCKS (39Lin X. Nelson P. Gelman I.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7259-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and glutathione peroxidase-like (GenBank™ accession number BC032788 or AF320068) were significantly reduced in Brca1-null cells. Because loss of both wild-type alleles of Brca1 has been correlated to sensitivity to oxidative stress (11Gowen L.C. Avrutskaya A.V. Latour A.M. Koller B.H. Leadon S.A. Science. 1998; 281: 1009-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 40Cressman V.L. Backlund D.C. Avrutskaya A.V. Leadon S.A. Godfrey V. Koller B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7061-7075Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), GPx-like was further characterized. A comparison of amino acid sequences of this GPx-like with other GPx family members revealed 42% identity to mammalian cytoplasmic GPx1 and 44% to GPx4 (Fig. 1A). Three signature motifs of glutathione peroxidase are conserved in GPx-like, including the conservation of glutamine and tryptophan residues serving as the catalytic center of the enzyme (Fig. 1A). However, GPx-like incorporates cysteine instead of selenocysteine (encoded by an in-frame opal codon UGA), the third conserved residue in the catalytic center of most mammalian GPx family members (23Brigelius-Flohe R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 951-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). Moreover, amino acid sequence alignment against mammalian GPx family members revealed the presence of gaps that are conserved among PHGPx from many species (Fig. 1A) (41Ursini F. Maiorino M. Brigelius-Flohe R. Aumann K.D. Roveri A. Schomburg D. Flohe L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 38-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 42Avery A.M. Avery S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33730-33735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Therefore, GPx-like is the first reported mammalian PHGPx that uses cysteine instead of selenocysteine in the presumed catalytic site and henceforth is referred to as NPGPx (non-selenocysteine containing phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase). Query to GenBank to determine the chromosomal localization of NPGPx revealed that the NPGPx sequence is identical to Gpx7 and is located on chromosome 1p32 (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/LocusLink/LocRpt.cgi?l=27234). NPGPx is evolutionarily conserved between human and mouse, reaching up to 89% amino acid similarity, and shares ∼37% amino acid similarity with yeast PHGPx1 through PHGPx3. Unlike GPx4, NPGPx has neither mitochondrial nor nuclear targeting sequences but may contain an N-terminal signal peptide. Identification of NPGPx Protein and Its Cellular Localization—Using the NPGPx cDNA as template for in vitro transcription and translation, a doublet band with 26 kDa was detected (Fig. 1B). To confirm that the protein is authentic from the cDNA, we generated specific antibodies using antigens derived from either N-terminal glutathione S-transferase-tagged or His-tagged NPGPx proteins expressed in bacteria for identifying NPGPx. The in vitro translated NPGPx protein can be immunoprecipitated by the specific polyclonal antibodies against human NPGPx, but not by preimmune sera (Fig. 1B). The same anti-NPGPx polyclonal antibody, but not preimmune, recognized endogenous cellular NPGPx in immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1C, lane 2). Furthermore, a similar size of the protein was detected by direct straight Western blot analysis probed by αNPGPx monoclonal antibody (αNPGPx Mab-1) (Fig. 1C, lane 3). Intriguingly, the size of the endogenous NPGPx is about 22 kDa, which approximates the predicted molecular mass of NPGPx (186 amino acids), different from the in vitro synthesized protein. The mobility discrepancy in SDS-PAGE between the in vitro translated and the endogenous NPGPx suggests that NPGPx may be processed in vivo. Because NPGPx is the first mammalian PHGPx that uses cysteine instead of selenocysteine in the presumed catalytic site (Fig. 1A), it remains to be seen whether the protein has glutathione peroxidase activity. We then purified hexahistidine-tagged NPGPx to near homogeneity by affinity chromatography using a nickel-agarose resin and performed glutathione peroxidase activity assay. Little or no peroxidase activity was found under this assay condition. Although this result is consistent with many seleno-independent GPXs that have been investigated (43Imai H. Nakagawa Y. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 145-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar), an alternative possibility exists and requires further exploration. Next, the cellular localization of NPGPx in normal human diploid fibroblasts (HS27) was determined by immunostaining with either preimmune or anti-NPGPx polyclonal antibody (Fig. 1D). Specific staining was seen in the cytoplasm, with little or undetectable signal in the nucleus, suggesting that NPGPx is a cytoplasmic protein. Expression of GPx Family Members in Brca1-null MEF—To validate the results obtained from the microarray analysis and to assess the expression of other GPx family members, we performed semiquantitave RT-PCR on total RNA collected from wild-type, p53–/–, and p53–/–;Brca1–/– (Brca1-null) MEFs. As shown in Fig. 2A, there was a modest up-regulation of NPGPx mRNA expression in p53–/– MEF in comparison to wild-type MEF. However, NPGPx mRNA was significantly down-regulated in Brca1-null cells. In contrast, the expressions of other members of the GPx family such as GPx1 and GPx4 were not changed. Consistent with the RT-PCR results, the NPGPx protein expression was readily detected in both wild-type and p53–/– MEFs, but not in Brca1-null cells (Fig. 2B). Despite the similarity in the amino acid sequences among GPx family members, anti-NPGPx antibody was highly specific and recognized neither GPx1 nor GPx4, which were expressed in MEFs. Although there was a positive correlation between Brca1 and NPGPx expressions in these MEFs, we found no evidence to support a direct role for Brca1 in regulating the expression of NPGPx (data not shown and see below). Therefore, the reduction of NPGPx expression in the Brca1-null MEF may not be a direct consequence of Brca1 inactivation. Ectopic Expression of NPGPx Reduces Oxidative Stress of Brca1-null MEF—Brca1-null fibroblasts remain a useful system to test the biological function of NPGPx because they contain very little or no endogenous NPGPx. Moreover, Brca1-deficient fibroblasts have been described to be sensitive to exogenous H2O2 (40Cressman V.L. Backlund D.C. Avrutskaya A.V. Leadon S.A. Godfrey V. Koller B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7061-7075Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It is likely that reconstitution of NPGPx into Brca1-null MEFs will rescue H2O2 induced lethality. To express NPGPx ectopically in these MEFs, we used two types of high titer retroviruses carrying either EGFP alone or EGFP along with NPGPx expression units. As shown in Fig. 3B, Brca1-null MEF infected with NPGPx retrovirus expressed the protein at a significantly higher level when compared with that of wild-type or p53-null MEF. Parental Brca1-null cells infected with EGFP alone did not express detectable NPGPx protein. The ectopically expressed NPGPx mimicked the endogenous NPGPx in cytoplasmic localization as described above (Figs. 3C, right panel, and 1D). Consistently, the Brca1-null cells with little NPGPx expression did not show specific NPGPx staining. Colony formation assays were then performed on these cells to test the effect of exogenous H2O2 on cell viability. About 60–70% of p53–/– and wild-type MEFs treated with 100 μm H2O2 formed colonies after 2 weeks (Fig. 3D), whereas only about 10% of parental Brca1-null cells or infected with EGFP virus alone survived. On the other hand, significant resistance to H2O2 was observed in Brca1-null cells infected with NPGPx virus (Fig. 3D), suggesting that NPGPx is crucial for reducing the toxic effect of H2O2. However, it was noticed that the resistance to H2O2 toxicity of NPGPx virus-infected Brca1-null cells is not better than that of the wild-type or p53-null MEF although the former contained much higher level of NPGPx. NPGPx Is Expressed Ubiquitously and in Developing Mammary Gland—At least four members of the mammalian glutathione peroxidases have been characterized and their expressions have a distinct pattern of tissue distribution (23Brigelius-Flohe R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 951-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). To assess the expression pattern of NPGPx, we performed RT-PCR using specific primers directed against GPx1, GPx3, and GPx4 (Fig 4A). As reported, kidney and testis are the primary sites that express high levels of GPx3 and GPx4, respectively (Fig. 2B) (23Brigelius-Flohe R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 951-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the expression of the NPGPx mRNA was detected in testis, lung, kidney, adipose tissue, and mammary gland (Fig. 3A). Similarly, NPGPx protein was expressed in all tissues tested, including the mammary gland. We then examined the expression of NPGPx in virgin, pregnant, and lactating mammary glands. Interestingly, reduction of NPGPx mRNA and protein expression (Fig. 4D) was seen in both pregnant and lactating mammary glands in comparison to virgin glands. However, the level of GPx4 mRNA did not vary appreciably during mammary gland development, whereas the level of GPx1 mRNA was increased in lactating gland (Fig. 4C). These"

SchP2X provides a useful comparative model for the better understanding of human P2X receptor function and may also provide an alternative drug target for treatment of schistosomiasis. P2X receptors comprise a family of cation-selective ion channels gated by extracellular ATP. Mammalian species possess seven distinct P2X channel subtypes (P2X1–7), each encoded by a separate gene. These subunits assemble as functional homotrimeric or heterotrimeric channels and play an important role in a wide array of physiological processes including neurotransmission, smooth muscle contraction, immune cell function, and platelet aggregation (for a recent review see Ref. 1North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar). This remarkably diverse range of physiological roles for P2X receptors has contributed to the notion that ATP is a “primitive” extracellular signaling molecule (2Burnstock G. Drug Dev. Res. 2001; 53: 53-59Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 3Burnstock G. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2004; 4: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Functional evidence suggests that ATP-gated ion channels exist in some lower organisms including Tetrahymena thermophilia (4Kim M.Y. Kuruvilla H.G. Raghu S. Hennessey T.M. J. Exp. Biol. 1999; 202: 407-416PubMed Google Scholar), leech (5Backus K.H. Braum S. Lohner F. Deitmer J.W. J.

However, to date, definitive molecular identification of P2X channels is restricted to vertebrate species including fish (7Kucenas S. Li Z. Cox J.A. Egan T.M. Voigt M.M.

Using such a strategy, we have identified a P2X channel from the trematode worm Schistosoma mansoni. This human blood fluke is one of three main species of blood parasite that cause the disease schistosomiasis in humans. Approximately 200 million people are infected with schistosomes worldwide, and the disease is endemic in countries throughout Africa, South America, and the Middle East (11Engels D. Chitsulo L. Montresor A. Savioli L. Acta Trop. 2002; 82: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Schistosomiasis is an insidious disease, often not diagnosed until the pathology is well advanced and impacting most on childhood development (12Awasthi S. Bundy D.A. Savioli L. BMJ. 2003; 327: 431-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The World Health Organization estimates 0.2 million deaths per year from schistosomiasis with an annual morbidity impact of 1.76 million disability-adjusted life years, making this disease a substantial global health problem. Similarly as in vertebrate species, the control of intracellular calcium is fundamental in S. mansoni cell physiology, particularly in the function of adult muscle, which shows morphological and biochemical similarities with vertebrate smooth muscle (13Noel F. Cunha V.M. Silva C.L. Mendonca-Silva D.L. Mem. Inst. Oswaldo Cruz. 2001; 96: 85-88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Praziquantel, the only currently available drug used for the effective treatment of schistosomiasis, acts by an unknown mechanism, possibly through the modulation of calcium channel β-subunit function (14Kohn A.B. Anderson P.A. Roberts-Misterly J.M. Greenberg R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36873-36876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), to cause a rapid influx of calcium resulting in muscle contraction and paralysis. However, praziquantel-resistant strains of schistosomes are now emerging (15Ismail M. Botros S. Metwally A. William S. Farghally A. Tao L.F. Day T.A. Bennett J.L. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1999; 60: 932-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), and there is an acute need for alternative drugs and targets that will allow the alternation of treatment regimes to prevent the development of further resistant strains (16Fenwick A. Savioli L. Engels D. Bergquist R.N. Todd M.H. Trends Parasitol. 2003; 19: 509-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). P2X channels are known to have a significant calcium permeability (17Evans R.J. Lewis C. Virginio C. Lundstrom K. Buell G. Surprenant A. North R.A. J. Physiol. 1996; 497: 413-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and to play a central role in mammalian smooth muscle contraction (1North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar). The functional characterization of a S. mansoni P2X channel is therefore important from a therapeutic standpoint, as this receptor may represent a novel target for the development of new drugs to treat schistosomiasis or as an antigenic target for vaccines against this parasite. Furthermore, a better understanding of P2X receptors in a simple invertebrate system may shed new light on structure-function aspects of the receptor and provide insights into new signaling pathways for P2X receptors that could be extrapolated to better understand human P2X receptor function. Cloning of the S. mansoni P2X Receptor—A S. mansoni EST sequence (accession number CD081583) showing sequence homology to mammalian P2X receptors was identified by BLAST searches of the GenBank™ EST data base. The corresponding clone for this EST sequence (SmAE 609847.1) appeared to contain a partial cDNA consisting of ∼130 carboxyl-terminal amino acids and the 3′-untranslated region of a P2X-like gene. To obtain a full-length cDNA for this gene, PCR was performed on a S. mansoni cDNA library obtained from Dr. A. Agnew, University of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom (18Bentley G.N. Jones A.K. Agnew A. Gene. 2003; 314: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The forward primer (5′-GTGGTAACAACGCAGAGTA-3′) corresponded to the polylinker sequence in the library vector (Clontech SMART system), whereas the reverse primer (5′-AGTGAAGATTGAAGGAAACG-3′) corresponded to a 3′-untranslated region sequence from the CD081583 EST. A one-fiftieth dilution of the cDNA library was used as the template in a PCR reaction containing 200 μm dNTP, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 25 pmol of each primer, 1× Opti-Buffer (Bioline, London, United Kingdom), and 2.5 units of Bio-X-Act TaqDNA polymerase (Bioline). Thermal cycling consisted of 28 repetitions at 94 °C for 1 min, 48 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 1.5 min. This was followed by incubation at 68 °C for 7 min. The PCR product was separated on a 1% agarose gel, recovered, and cloned into a pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) plasmid that had been modified to contain a poly(A) tail adjacent to the 3′-untranslated region of the cloned cDNA. This cDNA insert was subsequently recloned by PCR to generate a construct (schP2X) containing a consensus Kozak sequence and the 5′-untranslated region of the human P2X1 receptor. This modification was necessary to obtain expression in Xenopus oocytes and did not change the amino acid sequence from the original non-Kozak-containing clone. Cloned inserts were sequenced on both strands using vector and insert-specific primers (Automated ABI Sequencing Service, University of Leicester, Leicester, United Kingdom). Electrophysiological Recordings in Xenopus Oocytes—Sense strand cRNA was generated from the schP2X plasmid using the T7 mMessage mMachine™ kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cRNA was quantified by spectrophotometry and dissolved in nuclease-free water at a concentration of 1 μg/μl. Manually defolliculated stage V-VI Xenopus oocytes were injected with 50 nl (50 ng) of cRNA using an Inject+Matic microinjector (J. Alejandro Gaby, Geneva, Switzerland) and stored at 18 °C in ND96 buffer (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm sodium pyruvate, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6) prior to recording 3–7 days later. Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were made from oocytes using a Turbo TEC 10C amplifier (NPI Electronic Instruments, Tamm, Germany) with a Digidata 1200 analogue to digital converter (Axon Instruments) and WinWCP acquisition software (Dr. J. Dempster, University of Strathclyde, Strathclyde, Scotland). Microelectrodes were filled with 3 m KCl, and the external solution consisted of ND96 buffer with 1.8 mm BaCl2 replacing the 1.8 mm CaCl2 to prevent activation of endogenous calcium-activated chloride channels (19Valera S. Hussy N. Evans R.J. Adami N. North R.A. Surprenant A. Buell G. Nature. 1994; 371: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Membrane currents were recorded at a holding potential of –60mV. The agonists, ATP (magnesium salt) (Sigma) and Bz-ATP (Sigma) were applied from a U-tube perfusion system (20Fenwick E.M. Marty A. Neher E. J. Physiol. 1982; 331: 599-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar), whereas ivermectin and antagonists (pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulfonic acid (PPADS) and suramin (Sigma)) were bath-perfused in addition to being present at the appropriate concentration in the U-tube with the agonist. Concentration-response curves were constructed using a 5-min recovery period between applications and by normalizing data points to two applications of 100 μm ATP (one preceding and one following the data point concentration). Non-injected and water-injected oocytes tested from at least seven separate batches of oocytes gave no detectable currents in response to ATP or Bz-ATP application (range 100 μm to 1 mm). Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Differences between means were tested using Student's paired t test. Concentration response data were fitted with the equation Y = ((X)H·M)/((X)H + (EC50)H), where Y is response, X is agonist concentration, H is the Hill coefficient, M is maximum response, and EC50 is the concentration of agonist evoking 50% of the maximum response. pEC50 is the –log10 of the EC50 value. Permeability Studies of schP2X Expressed in Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) Cells—HEK293 cells were cultured in six-well plates with Optimem1 plus Glutamax (Invitrogen). Cells were transiently transfected with a mixture of schP2X plasmid (3.6 μg) and pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) (40 ng) using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The green fluorescent protein (GFP) plasmid (pEGFP-C1) was included to allow visualization of transfected cells. For whole cell patch clamp recordings, cells were superfused at 2 ml/min with an external solution consisting of either 154 mm NaCl, 154 mm Tris-Cl, 154 mm methylamine-HCl, 154 mm dimethylamine-HCl, or 154 mm triethylammonium chloride, 2.5 mm HEPES, and 20 mm l-histidine (pH 7.3). Electrodes (2–5 megaohms) were filled with 154 mm NaCl, 10 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.3). Currents were recorded at room temperature using an Axopatch 200B amplifier, and data were collected using pClamp8.2 software (Axon Instruments). ATP was applied rapidly using a U-tube perfusion system (20Fenwick E.M. Marty A. Neher E. J. Physiol. 1982; 331: 599-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Liquid junction potentials had been measured previously, and no correction was made for the small offset. The reversal potential (Vrev) values for currents in different test cation solutions were obtained using a dual ramp protocol that stepped from a holding potential of –60mV to 60mV for 0.5 s followed by a ramp-down to –100mV over 1.6 s and a ramp-up to 60mv over 1.6 s before a step-back to –60mV. This ramp protocol was applied in the absence and presence of ATP (100 μm), and the reversal potential was taken as the points where the current traces crossed on the ramps (Fig. 6A). Recordings were made from single GFP-expressing cells following at least 5 min of whole cell recording to allow for dialysis of the intracellular solution. The difference between the two crossover points obtained for each cell (up-ramp and down-ramp) was typically <1 mV, and the mean of the two values was taken as the reversal potential of the cell. Relative permeability ratios for monovalent cations were calculated from the equation Px/PNa = exp(ΔVrevF/RT), where F is Faraday's constant, R is the universal gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. Permeability measurements of the divalent cation calcium were made with an external solution with 112 mm calcium of the composition 110 mm CaCl2, 1.8 mm Ca(OH)2, 10 mm HEPES, and 12 mm glucose (pH 7.3). ATP was applied at 1 mm, and the reversal potential was determined as described above. PCa/PNa was calculated from the equation PCa/PNa = [Na+]iexp(VrevF/RT)(1 + exp(VrevF/RT))/4[Ca2+]o. Ion activities were corrected for using values of 0.75 for sodium and all other monovalent cations and 0.25 for calcium at 112 mm (21Benham C.D. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1987; 328: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Atomic dimensions of the ions used were obtained by Prof. Alan North (University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom) from spacefilling models (van der Waals radii) of energy-minimized conformations using Desktop Molecular Modeler software. The diameter of the ions was taken as the median value for measurements taken in the x, y, and z axes. Cloning of the schP2X cDNA—PCR on the S. mansoni cDNA library using a vector polylinker forward primer and a S. mansoni-specific reverse primer yielded a product of 1492 bp that contained an open reading frame of 1314 bp. When cRNA prepared from this construct was injected into Xenopus oocytes, no functional P2X channels were detected. This original PCR clone lacked a consensus vertebrate Kozak sequence at the initiation codon of the open reading frame. One possible explanation for the lack of functional expression was an inability of Xenopus oocytes to recognize an invertebrate translation initiation codon. We therefore recloned the Schistosoma P2X PCR product, introducing a consensus Kozak sequence at the initiation codon and substituting the 5′-untranslated region of the Schistosoma gene with the 5′-untranslated region of the human P2X1 gene. The introduction of these two modifications resulted in the expression of functional P2X channels when cRNA was injected into Xenopus oocytes. Neither modification changed the amino acid sequence from the original non-Kozak-containing PCR clone. The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA clone amplified from the S. mansoni cDNA library is available in the EMBL data base under the accession number AJ783803. This sequence appears to correspond to the same gene represented by the partial EST clone SmAE 609847.1 (22Verjovski-Almeida S. DeMarco R. Martins E.A. Guimaraes P.E. Ojopi E.P. Paquola A.C. Piazza J.P. Nishiyama Jr., M.Y. Kitajima J.P. Adamson R.E. Ashton P.D. Bonaldo M.F. Coulson P.S. Dillon G.P. Farias L.P. Gregorio S.P. Ho P.L. Leite R.A. Malaquias L.C. Marques R.C. Miyasato P.A.

Genet. 2003; 35: 148-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), because the overlapping sequence between the two clones (373 bp) is identical. The predicted amino acid sequence of schP2X (437 amino acids) shows homology to the human P2X receptor family ranging from 25.8% (P2X7) to 36.6% identity (P2X4). Prediction of the membrane topology using the TopPred algorithm (23Claros M.G. von Heijne G. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 685-686PubMed Google Scholar) suggests a typical P2X topology with intracellular carboxyl and amino termini, two transmembrane domains, and a large extracellular loop region (Fig. 1). Six Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr sequons (Asn-71, Asn-170, Asn-187, Asn-223, Asn-275, and Asn-305) are present in the putative extracellular loop region of the schP2X receptor, two of which (Asn-187 and Asn-305) are conserved in some mammalian P2X receptors and have been shown to be glycosylated in the rat P2X1 receptor (24Rettinger J. Aschrafi A. Schmalzing G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33542-33547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Nucleotide-evoked Currents in Xenopus Oocytes Expressing schP2X—ATP evoked inward currents at recombinant schP2X receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes clamped at –60mV (Fig. 2A). The first currents in response to 100 μm ATP (mean peak amplitude was –5.86 ± 1.36 μA) decayed in the continued presence of agonist with a T-50% (time for current to decay to 50% of peak response) time of 6.16 ± 0.052 s (n = 9). After 5 min of recovery time between applications, the second responses had a lower peak amplitude (–3.73 ± 1.25 μA, n = 9; p < 0.01) and longer T-50% time (14.6 ± 0.07 s, n = 9; p < 0.01). Subsequent responses with 5 min between applications did not differ significantly from the second response. ATP evoked concentration-dependent responses with an EC50 value of 22.1 μm (pEC50 4.68 ± 0.06, n = 7) and a Hill slope of 1.2 ± 0.1. (Fig. 2C). The ATP analogue Bz-ATP produced similar currents to those of ATP. However, Bz-ATP was a partial agonist (maximum response of Bz-ATP was 75.4 ± 4.4% that of the maximum response produced by ATP) with a higher (p < 0.01) potency (EC50 of 3.6 μm and pEC50 of 5.54 ± 0.06, n = 6) than ATP. AMP-CPP, ADP, UTP, UDP, CTP, and ITP (100 μm) did not evoke currents at the schP2X receptor. Effects of the Antagonists PPADS and Suramin—The P2 receptor antagonist surinam reduced schP2X responses evoked by ATP (100 mm) in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 of 9.6 μm (pIC50 of 5.09 ± 0.13 μm, n = 5) (Fig. 3). At lower concentrations (0.1–10 μm), PPADS was more effective than suramin at blocking responses to 100 μm ATP at the schP2X receptor (IC50 of 0.5 μm; pIC50 of 6.81 ± 0.61 μm, n = 7). However, there was a PPADS-resistant component to the schP2X current (∼20% of the maximum current) that persisted at concentrations of up to 100 μm PPADS. This PPADS-resistant component was largely blocked when 100 μm ATP plus 100 μm suramin was applied to oocytes previously equilibrated with 100 μm PPADS (mean current in 100 μm PPADS was 22.11 ± 1.96% with no antagonist response (n = 8); mean current in 100 μm PPADS plus 100 μm suramin was 7.02 ± 1.18% with no antagonist response (n = 6)). The current produced by 100 μm ATP in the presence of both 100 μm suramin and 100 μm PPADS was higher (p < 0.01) than the current produced in the presence of 100 μm suramin (4.34 ± 0.25%, 100 μm ATP-only current, n = 12). Potentiation of schP2X Currents by Ivermectin—Ivermectin, a derivative of fermentation products of Streptomyces avermitilis, is a broad spectrum, anti-parasite medication that has been shown previously to potentiate currents in human and rat P2X4 channels (25Khakh B.S. Proctor W.R. Dunwiddie T.V. Labarca C. Lester H.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7289-7299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Priel A. Silberberg S.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 123: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the effects of ivermectin on schP2X currents. Ivermectin potentiated schP2X currents evoked by both ATP and Bz-ATP. The maximum effect of ivermectin was seen at 10 μm (effects of 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 μm ivermectin were tested at an EC50 concentration of ATP (20 μm); data not shown). At this concentration, ivermectin increased the response to 100 μm ATP by 66 ± 24% (p < 0.05, n = 6) (example traces are shown in Fig. 4A). The onset of the potentiation by ivermectin was relatively rapid (<5 min exposure for maximum effect). However, after ivermectin washout, currents remained potentiated, taking 30 min to return to their pre-ivermectin exposure amplitude (Fig. 4A). Concentration response curves for both ATP and Bz-ATP in the presence of 10 μm ivermectin showed similar EC50 values to those obtained in the absence of ivermectin (ATP had an EC50 of 18.2 μm, a pEC50 of 4.84 ± 0.15, and a Hill slope of 1.1 ± 0.19, n = 6; Bz-ATP had an EC50 of 1.6 μm, a pEC50 of 5.83 ± 0.10, and a Hill slope of 2.2 ± 0.74, n = 5) (Fig. 4B). However, the maximum response for both ATP and Bz-ATP was increased in the presence of 10 μm ivermectin. For ATP the top of the dose-response curve was 179 ± 29% of the response to 100 μm ATP in the presence of 10 μm ivermectin (versus 120 ± 7% in the absence of ivermectin), and for Bz-ATP the top of the dose response curve was 120 ± 14% of the response to 100 μm ATP in the presence of 10 mm ivermectin (versus 92 ± 6% in the absence of ivermectin). Reversal Potential of schP2X Currents in Xenopus Oocytes—To investigate the current-voltage relationship of schP2X currents, we determined the reversal potential in Xenopus oocytes by applying a ramp protocol from –100mV to 100mV in the presence and absence of 100 μm ATP (Fig. 5A). The subtracted current (current in the presence of ATP – current in the absence of ATP) was essentially linear with a mean reversal potential of –7.2 mV ± 3.0, n = 12 (Fig. 5C). A similar result was also obtained when peak currents at different holding potentials were plotted (Fig. 5, D and E). Because it is not possible to control the internal ionic composition of Xenopus oocytes via a patch clamp pipette, further experiments investigating the relative permeabilities of various cations were conducted in the human HEK293 cell line. Monovalent Cation Permeability in HEK293 Cells—To investigate the relative permeability of various cations, we expressed the schP2X channel in HEK293 cells. As HEK293 cell transfections contained 90 times more schP2X plasmid than GFP plasmid, we assumed that any GFP-positive cells would also be cotransfected with schP2X. However, we only observed schP2X currents in 53% of GFP positive cells, suggesting that expression of schP2X and/or correct trafficking to the cell membrane was less efficient in HEK293 cells compared with Xenopus oocytes (100% of injected oocytes showed schP2X currents). The reversal potentials of schP2X currents in HEK293 cells with different extracellular cations are shown in Table I. The permeability ratios (to sodium) of the monovalent cations tested roughly relate to the ionic size of the cation (Fig. 6B) and extrapolate to an estimated minimum pore diameter of 0.9 nm.Table IReversal potentials and relative permeability ratios for external cationsCationVrevPX/PNamVSodium0.38 ± 0.930.99 ± 0.02Methylamine1.75 ± 0.891.09 ± 0.02Dimethylamine-12.75 ± 1.160.62 ± 0.02Tris-32.95 ± 1.650.28 ± 0.017Triethylammonium-60.93 ± 2.050.096 ± 0.007Calcium9.7 ± 1.6323.8 ± 0.29 Open table in a new tab Calcium Permeability—The relative permeability to calcium was determined from the reversal potential of schP2X currents in 112 mm extracellular calcium solution as described previously (17Evans R.J. Lewis C. Virginio C. Lundstrom K. Buell G. Surprenant A. North R.A. J. Physiol. 1996; 497: 413-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 27Lewis C. Davies N.W. Evans R.J. Drug Dev. Res. 2001; 52: 164-169Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In 112 mm external calcium, currents in response to 100 μm ATP were 90 ± 2.7% (p < 0.01) smaller than the equivalent currents in 154 mm external sodium solution. This current inhibition at high external calcium could be overcome by using a higher concentration of ATP (1 mm ATP in 112 mm calcium produced currents corresponding to 111 ± 9.4% of currents produced by 100 μm ATP in external 154 mm sodium solution) (Fig. 6C). The reversal potential to ATP (1 mm) in 112 mm Ca2+ external solution was 10.25 ± 1.37 mV (Table I). This value corresponds to a relative permeability for calcium to sodium of 3.80 ± 0.29. Given this high calcium permeability of schP2X and the fact that praziquantel, the only currently available drug for the treatment of schistosomiasis, is known to act via a mechanism involving a rise in intracellular calcium (14Kohn A.B. Anderson P.A. Roberts-Misterly J.M. Greenberg R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36873-36876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), we explored the possibility that some of the actions of praziquantel could be mediated via modulation of schP2X currents. Praziquantel (up to 100 μm), however, had no effect on schP2X channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes (data not shown). This study describes the first example of a non-vertebrate P2X receptor and therefore provides definitive molecular evidence that the range of species known to utilize ATP as an extracellular signaling molecule extends beyond vertebrates. The presence of a P2X receptor in an invertebrate species supports the hypothesis that the emergence of P2X receptors for extracellular ATP occurred relatively early in eukaryotic evolution. However, it is interesting to note that no P2X-like protein sequences are present in the three invertebrate species for which complete genomic sequences are available (Anopheles gambiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster). Therefore, either the three invertebrate species described above have lost their P2X gene(s) during evolution, or schP2X and vertebrate P2X receptors arose from a common ancestral non-P2X protein by two evolutionary distinct events that did not occur in A. gambiae, C. elegans, or D. melanogaster. Functional evidence for ATP-gated ion channels in T. thermophilia (4Kim M.Y. Kuruvilla H.G. Raghu S. Hennessey T.M. J. Exp. Biol. 1999; 202: 407-416PubMed Google Scholar) and A. proteus (6Pothier F.

Given their central importance in the biology of protein folding and in cellular stress response, and their potential as targets in a variety of therapeutic strategies, the mechanism by which hsp90 chaperone activity is regulated and the chemistry of their interactions with client substrates are under intensive investigation.GRP94 and Hsp90 exist as obligate homodimers, with each subunit consisting of an N-terminal regulatory and ligand binding domain, a charged region, a middle domain, and a C-terminal dimerization domain. This organization and the structural similarity of their N-terminal ATP binding domains characterize the GHKL family of proteins (18Dutta R. Inouye M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 24-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar), whose members in addition to Hsp90s also include DNA gyrase, histidine kinases, DNA topoisomerase II, and MutL. By analogy to DNA gyrase (19Wigley D.B. Davies G.J. Dodson E.J. Maxwell A. Dodson G. Nature. 1991; 351: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) and MutL (20Ban C. Junop M. Yang W. Cell. 1999; 97: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that Hsp90 chaperone activity is linked to an N-domain conformational change that is coupled to ATP binding and hydrolysis and that results in the dimerization of the N-domains (21Prodromou C. Panaretou B. Chohan S. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Roe S.M. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4383-4392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Meyer P. Prodromou C. Hu B. Vaughan C. Roe S.M. Panaretou B. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 647-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Mechanistic explanations of how ATP binding and hydrolysis are coupled to Hsp90 activity have been hindered, however, by the lack of any observed change in the conformation of the N-domain in response to ligands. The complete protein, rather than just the isolated N-domain, is required for ATP hydrolysis (6Obermann W.M. Sondermann H. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 23Owen B.A. Sullivan W.P. Felts S.J. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7086-7091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), suggesting that conformational rearrangements resulting in a close interaction between the N- and middle domains are important for Hsp90 activity. Interactions with co-chaperones may also be important catalysts for ATP hydrolysis in human Hsp90 as well (24Panaretou B. Siligardi G. Meyer P. Maloney A. Sullivan J.K. Singh S. Millson S.H. Clarke P.A. Naaby-Hansen S. Stein R. Cramer R. Mollapour M. Workman P. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1307-1318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar).GRP94 and Hsp90 are greater than 50% identical in their N-domains, yet the biochemical hallmarks of Hsp90 chaperone activity are largely missing for this paralog. ATP hydrolysis above background levels has not been detected for GRP94 (25Rosser M.F. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22798-22805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), nor have co-chaperones or partner proteins been identified. In addition, although Hsp90 binds ADP/ATP with micromolar affinity (11Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar), the binding constant for adenosine nucleotides to GRP94 is estimated to be of several millimolar units (25Rosser M.F. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22798-22805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These differences suggest that the structure of GRP94 may reveal an alternative regulatory mechanism for GRP94. The structure of the N-domain of GRP94 in complex with a series of inhibitory ligands was reported recently and revealed that, unlike Hsp90, the inhibitor-bound protein was sterically incompatible with adenosine nucleotide binding (26Soldano K.L. Jivan A. Nicchitta C.V. Gewirth D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48330-48338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This indicated that ATP binding would lead to a conformational change in the N-domain of GRP94, although the extent and nature of this change was unknown. To understand the structural and mechanistic consequences of adenosine nucleotide binding to GRP94, we have now determined the structure of the N-domain of GRP94 in complex with ATP, ADP, and AMP. From these structures we show that helices 1, 4, and 5, a subdomain of the N-domain implicated in ligand binding, undergoes a dramatic conformational rearrangement in response to the bound ligand. We also show that this rearrangement results in the assembly and exposure of a large, predominantly non-polar surface that in turn mediates functionally plausible dimerization with another N-domain. GRP94 thus contains a ligand-dependent dimerization switch in its N-domain. Because this switch is likely to be responsive to the intracellular concentration of ATP, this suggests a mechanism for GRP94 action that is independent of ATP hydrolysis or co-chaperones.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Purification—The N-terminal domain of canine GRP94 (residues 69–337Δ287–327, which contain 4 glycine residues in place of the 41-amino acid-charged linker domain, residues 287–327), was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells as an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase fusion. Cells were grown in LB at 37 °C to an A600 of 1, induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and harvested after 3 h of induction. Cell pellets were resuspended in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 350 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and lysed by multiple passes through a Microfluidics M110L microfluidizer. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation, and the resulting supernatant was applied to a glutathione-agarose column in lysis buffer and subsequently washed with 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 350 mm NaCl, 5mm DTT, and cut buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT) until A280 = 0.1. 100 μg/12 liters growth of thrombin (Hematologic Technologies) in cut buffer was added to the column, and the mixture was incubated for 4 h at room temperature with mild rocking. GRP94 was eluted with 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 350 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT and subjected to Q-Sepharose Fast Flow (pH 8.0) and size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 75, Amersham Biosciences). Purified GRP94 was concentrated, and buffer-exchanged using a Millipore Ultrafree 4 into 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT to a final concentration of 30 mg/ml. Small aliquots were flash frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80 °C.Selenomethionine labeling of GRP94(69–337Δ287–327) was done according to the method of Van Duyne et al. (27Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar) and purified in a similar manner, except that the glutathione S-transferase fusion protein was eluted from the glutathione-agarose column prior to digestion with thrombin. Selenium incorporation was verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.Crystallization and Data Collection—GRP94(69–337Δ287–327) at 30 mg/ml was co-crystallized in the presence of a 5-fold molar excess of ATP, ADP, or AMP. Crystals were obtained using the hanging drop, vapor diffusion method by mixing the protein·nucleotide complex with an equal volume of reservoir solution (29–32% PEG 400, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.6–8.5, 10–80 mm MgCl2) and incubated at 18 °C. Diffraction quality crystals were obtained in 3–4 weeks with typical dimensions of 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.3 mm. SeMet GRP94 co-crystals with AMP were obtained in a similar manner except that 26–30% PEG MME 350 was used in place of PEG 400 in the reservoir solution.GRP94·nucleotide crystals were gradually equilibrated into a cryoprotectant solution containing increased precipitant (8–10% increase in PEG 400) and salt (30–50 mm increase in MgCl2) concentrations, before flash cooling in liquid nitrogen. SeMet GRP94·AMP crystals were rapidly swished through a cryo-protectant solution containing 40% PEG MME 350, 35 mm MgCl2, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.6, prior to flash cooling in liquid nitrogen.Native data sets were collected at the Advanced Photon Source on beamline 22ID using charge-coupled device detectors. MAD data sets were collected at the National Synchrotron Light Source on beamline X25 using a charge-coupled device detector. A sulfur anomalous data set was collected for the GRP94·ADP co-crystal using CrKα radiation (λ = 2.2 Å) and an R-Axis IV detector.Structure Determination and Refinement—Initial phases for the GRP94·AMP complex were obtained by molecular replacement using MolRep (28Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4120) Google Scholar). The search model was GRP94(69–337Δ287–327)·NECA (PDB code 1QYH). After the first of the two GRP94·AMP complexes in the asymmetric unit was located, model phases were combined with multiwavelength anomalous dispersion phases calculated from the SeMet sites and used to perform a phased molecular replacement search in CNS (29Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16929) Google Scholar) that found the other complex of the asymmetric unit. The complete model was partially refined using model and experimental phases in CNS. This model was subsequently used as the molecular replacement model to solve the structure of the GRP94·ADP complex. The molecular replacement solution revealed good electron density for residues 96–168, 198–284, and 329–337. The missing residues were built into the model iteratively by manual rebuilding in O (30Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar). Refinement was done using CNS. In latter rounds of refinement, restrained B-factor refinement and a maximum likelihood Hendrickson-Lattman target that included phases obtained from sulfur anomalous data were used. The refined GRP94·ADP model was used as the search model for subsequent molecular replacement into the other ATP and AMP complexes. All three nucleotide-bound forms of GRP94 were rebuilt in O and refined similarly using CNS. Structure validation was performed using Mage, KiNG, and MolProbity (31Lovell S.C. Davis I.W.

Sage H. Hsieh T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5944-5951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), with the gracious assistance of Dr. Harvey Sage. Briefly, GRP94(69–337Δ287–327) at concentrations of 1, 2, 4, 64, 167, 333, and 800 μm in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT was centrifuged with ATP at concentrations of 0, 0.2, 2, 4, 6, or 8 mm at 4 °C. The ATP concentrations cover the measured dissociation constant of ATP for intact GRP94 (3–5 mm). Because the dissociation constants for other ligands such as geldanamycin, radicicol, and NECA are the same for the N-domain as they are for the intact chaperone (data not shown), it is expected that this range also covers the dissociation constant of ATP for the GRP94 N-domain. Samples were centrifuged at both 10,000 and 18,000 rpm (optimized for the monomer and dimer molecular weights, respectively), until equilibrium, as determined by time lapse scans, was achieved. Following the establishment of equilibrium the absorbance was measured at a wavelength between 280 and 303 nm. Measurements at these wavelengths were experimentally shown to obey Beer's Law and were chosen to allow measurement of GRP94 absorption without interference from the high concentration of exogenous ATP. The data were fitted by the Ideal-1 program (Beckman Instruments) using ν4 = 0.7268 (partial specific volume of GRP94), calculated from the amino acid composition, and ρ4 = 1.0043 (solvent density).Cross-linking—GRP94(69–337Δ287–327) (10 mg/ml, ∼0.3 mm) was subjected to chemical cross-linking with BS3. ATP and radicicol were each added to a final concentration of 5 mm to the protein in cross-linking buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2). The ligand-protein mixtures, as well as the unliganded protein, were incubated on ice for 30 min before BS3 (5 mm final) was added. The reaction mixtures were subsequently incubated for 12–16 h at 4 °C before quenching with 200 mm Tris, pH 7.6. The samples were analyzed by 12.5% homogeneous SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Cross-linking experiments performed with protein concentrations of 20 mg/ml resulted in precipitation upon addition of the ATP, whereas those done at 1–3 mg/ml did not exhibit any cross-linking, consistent with an expected dimerization constant near millimolar.Coordinates—Coordinates and structure factors for the GRP94-ATP, ADP, and AMP complexes have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession codes 1TC0, 1TC6, and 1TBW, respectively).RESULTSCrystallization and Structure Determination—The structures of an engineered GRP94(69–337Δ287–327), in which 4 Gly residues replace the charged linker domain, bound to ATP, ADP, and AMP, were solved and refined at 2.2-, 1.9-, and 2.0-Å resolution, respectively. Molecular replacement using the GRP94·NECA complex (26Soldano K.L. Jivan A. Nicchitta C.V. Gewirth D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48330-48338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) as the search model did not yield interpretable electron density for the helix 1-4-5 subdomain in the GRP94·nucleotide complex, so an independent phase approach was used. Initial phases were obtained from a 2.4-Å MAD data set of an SeMet-labeled GRP94(69–337Δ287–327)·AMP complex. This model, which was only partially refined, was then used as the search model for subsequent molecular replacement using the 1.9-Å GRP94(69–337Δ287–327)·ADP data set. Model phases combined with SAD phases calculated from sulfur and phosphorus anomalous data collected using CrKα radiation allowed for a nearly complete trace of the A protomer and most of the B protomer. This refined model was then used as the molecular replacement search model for the ATP and AMP complexes, which were refined using model phases. A portion of the final electron density map for the GRP94·ADP complex is shown below in Fig. 3C.Overall Architecture—With the exception of a conformational change in the helix 1-4-5 subdomain to be discussed below, the structure of the N-domain of GRP94 in complex with ATP, ADP, and AMP resembles that seen previously for GRP94 in complex with the inhibitory ligands N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA), radicicol, and 2-chlorodideoxyadenosine, all of which were essentially identical to one another except for the different ligands (26Soldano K.L. Jivan A. Nicchitta C.V. Gewirth D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48330-48338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Although refined independently, the ATP·GRP94, ADP·GRP94, and AMP·GRP94 complexes are also nearly identical to one another. The γ-phosphate of the ATP is disordered. This parallels the observation that the terminal phosphates of the yHsp90·ATP, yHsp90·ATPγS, and hHsp90· AMPPNP complexes are also disordered in those crystal structures (6Obermann W.M. Sondermann H.

Because crystals of the GRP94·ADP complex diffracted to higher resolution than the other two nucleotide complexes, we used the ADP complex for most of the following analysis and comparisons.ADP-Protein Interactions—The interactions between the ADP ligand and the GRP94 N-domain are shown schematically in Fig. 1A, and in stereo in Fig. 1B. The adenine moiety of the nucleotide fits into the ligand binding cavity in a manner similar to that of NECA (26Soldano K.L. Jivan A. Nicchitta C.V. Gewirth D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48330-48338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and makes similar contacts with the protein. In contrast to NECA, however, the 5′ substituent of ADP does not interact with the second binding pocket. Instead, the phosphates adopt a 3′-endo G+TG+G+A- conformation (following IUPAC conventions with dihedrals listed from the sugar outward), which is spatially similar but more relaxed than the unusual 3′-endo, +sc γ arrangement previously observed in the structure of the Hsp90·ADP complex (11Prodromou C.

The residues interacting with the ADP in GRP94 are completely conserved between GRP94 and Hsp90, including the potential catalytic residue Glu-103 (Glu-33 in yeast Hsp90).Fig. 1Interaction of GRP94 with ADP.A, schematic diagram showing interactions between the protein and ADP ligand.

Structurally non-divergent regions of the molecules were used as the basis for the superposition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)There is a 250-Å2 increase in the total solvent-accessible surface area of the “open” GRP94·ADP complex compared with the “closed” GRP94·NECA complex. The proportion of polar and non-polar surface exposed to solvent differs between the open and closed conformations as well: the solvent-accessible surface of the open conformation is ∼62% non-polar (or 7,040 Å2 out of a total N-domain surface area of 11,300 Å2) compared with 55% non-polar (6060 Å2) in the closed conformation. This re-apportioning of the surface in favor of greater non-polar area favors interactions with non-polar surfaces on other proteins, including an N-domain dimeric partner (see below), and possibly client proteins or accessory factors.The rearrangement of the helix 1-4-5 subdomain into the open conformation is not an en bloc movement but is instead accompanied by remodeling within the subdomain (Fig. 2A). Helix 5 is extended by 3 residues compared with its counterpart in the closed form, and the axes of helices 4 and 5 go from being nearly parallel and coplanar in the closed form to diverging by ∼35 degrees in the open form. This divergence is coupled to a 30-degree outward rotation of helix 1 and the complete dissociation of strand 1 from the 9-stranded beta sheet core of the protein. These changes result in the incorporation of residues 76–78 into the N-terminal end of helix 1, and the uncappin"

Viroporins have been implicated in promoting virus release from infected cells and in affecting cellular functions including protein trafficking and membrane permeability. Nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) of bluetongue virus has been shown previously to be important for efficient release of newly made virions from infected cells. In this report, we demonstrate that NS3 possesses properties commonly associated with viroporins. Our findings indicate that: (i) NS3 localizes to the Golgi apparatus and plasma membrane in transfected cells, (ii) NS3 can homo-oligomerize in transfected cells, (iii) targeting of NS3 to the Golgi apparatus and plasma membrane correlates with the enhanced permeability of cells to the translation inhibitor hygromycin B (hyg-B), (iv) amino acids 118–148 comprising transmembrane region 1 (TM1) of NS3 are critical for Golgi targeting and hyg-B permeability, and (v) deletion of amino acids 156–181 comprising transmembrane region 2 (TM2) of NS3 has little to no affect on Golgi targeting and hyg-B permeability. These viroporin-like properties may contribute to the role of NS3 in virus release and may have important implications for pathogenicity of bluetongue virus infections.

Bluetongue virus (BTV) 1The abbreviations used are: BTV, bluetongue virus; NS3, non-structural protein 3; TM1, transmembrane region 1; hyg-B, hygromycin B; L-domain, late budding domain; HA, hemagglutinin; mAb, monoclonal antibody; WT, wild type; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PDI, protein disulfide isomerase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. is a member of the Orbivirus genus within the Reoviridae family of segmented double-stranded RNA viruses. BTV remains an agriculturally important veterinary pathogen transmitted primarily to sheep by biting midges. BTV encodes seven structural (VP1–7) and four non-structural (NS1, NS2, NS3, and NS3A) proteins. NS3 is a 229-amino acid protein encoded by the viral S10 RNA segment, and NS3A is a 216-amino acid protein in which synthesis is initiated from an in-frame downstream AUG codon within the Ser-10 RNA segment (1Wade-Evans A.M.

Both proteins have been shown to be N-linked glycosylated and associated with lipid membranes in infected cells (2Wu X. Chen S.Y. Iwata H. Compans R.W. Roy P. J.

Virology. 1989; 173: 21-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) were the first to provide evidence that NS3/NS3A may be involved in the late stages of BTV assembly and that NS3/NS3A were required for efficient release of virus-like particles from BTV-infected cells. For example, electron microscopic studies suggested that NS3 was associated with areas of plasma membrane perturbation (3Hyatt A.D. Gould A.R. Coupar B. Eaton B.T. J. Gen. Virol. 1991; 72: 2263-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Similar findings have been reported for the NS3 protein encoded by the closely related African horse sickness virus (5van Staden V. Smit C.C. Stoltz M.A. Maree F.F. Huismans H. Arch. Virol. Suppl. 1998; 14: 251-258PubMed Google Scholar, 8van Staden V. Stoltz M.A. Huismans H. Arch. Virol. 1995; 140: 289-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 9van Niekerk M. Smit C.C. Fick W.C. van Staden V. Huismans H. Virology. 2001; 279: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). More recently, an elegant study by Beaton et al. (10Beaton A.R. Rodriguez J. Reddy Y.K. Roy P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13154-13159Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) demonstrated that NS3 of BTV facilitates virus release by interacting with specific host-trafficking proteins at the plasma membrane. The authors suggest that NS3 functions as a bridge, linking progeny virions with cellular export machinery to promote virus release (10Beaton A.R. Rodriguez J. Reddy Y.K. Roy P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13154-13159Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Thus, NS3 appears to play a key role in virus assembly and release. We were initially intrigued by the presence of conserved PPXY and PSAP motifs within NS3 that are identical in sequence to late budding domains (L-domains) that we and others have identified in matrix proteins of RNA viruses (11Freed E.O. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 4679-4687Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). These L-domains have been shown to interact with specific host proteins, and the resultant virus-host interactions are thought to facilitate virus budding by an, as yet, undetermined mechanism. Results from our initial experiments indicated that the PPXY and PSAP motifs of NS3 did not appear to function as typical L-domains, in that these motifs did not promote the release of NS3-containing virus-like particles from mammalian cells. Interestingly, we did find that cells expressing NS3 were permeable to the translational inhibitor hygromycin B in a dose-dependent manner. This finding suggested that NS3 may be capable of permeabilizing or destabilizing lipid membranes; a property shared by a group of viral proteins termed viroporins (12Gonzalez M.E. Carrasco L. FEBS Lett. 2003; 552: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). We went on to demonstrate that NS3 possesses additional characteristics commonly associated with viroporins. For example, NS3 was able to form homo-oligomers when expressed in mammalian cells. Furthermore, like other viroporins, NS3 is a transmembrane protein containing two transmembrane domains (TM1 and TM2). Mutations introduced into TM1 to disrupt the hydrophobic nature of this region abolished the ability of NS3 to permeabilize the plasma membrane. In contrast, the deletion of amino acids comprising TM2 did not result in disruption of NS3-induced membrane permeability. Interestingly, enhanced permeability to hyg-B correlated with the ability of NS3 proteins to target predominantly to the Golgi apparatus. In sum, our results are consistent with a possible role for NS3 as a viroporin that may facilitate the release of virus particles and contribute to the pathogenesis of BTV infections. Cells and Antisera—293T or COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and 1× penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). The antisera used included anti-hemagglutinin (HA) mAb (Roche Applied Science), anti-c-Myc mAb 9E10 to detect c-Myc-tagged VP40 (University of Pennsylvania Cell Center), and horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rat and anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Plasmids—A plasmid encoding the NS3 gene from bluetongue virus (serotype 1) was generated at the Institute for Animal Health (Surrey, UK) and was kindly provided by A. Wade-Evans (1Wade-Evans A.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4920Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The NS3 open reading frame was amplified by PCR and inserted into vector pCAGGS using EcoRI and XhoI restriction endonucleases. During the PCR amplification step, a HA epitope tag (YPYDVPDYA) was joined in-frame at the C terminus of NS3 to generate NS3-WT. Mutations were introduced into the NS3 gene by PCR and site-directed mutagenesis to generate plasmids encoding NS3 mutants numbers 6 (A131E/L132E/L133E) and 7 (L124E/L125E/I126E/A131E/L132E/L133E). Deletion mutants of NS3 included NS3-ΔTM1 (amino acids 118–148) and NS3-ΔTM2 (amino acids 156–181). All mutant NS3 proteins maintain the HA epitope tag in-frame at their C termini. An expression plasmid for Ebola virus (Zaire) VP40 (pVP40-WT) has been described previously (13Licata J.M. Simpson-Holley M. Wright N.T. Han Z. Paragas J. Harty R.N. J.

Virol. 2003; 77: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). All plasmids and introduced mutations were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting–Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (13Licata J.M. Simpson-Holley M. Wright N.T. Han Z. Paragas J. Harty R.N. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 1812-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 14Han Z. Boshra H. Sunyer J.O. Zwiers S.H. Paragas J. Harty R.N. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS-1 cells were transfected with pNS3-WT or the NS3 mutants indicated above using LipofectAMINE and following the protocol of the supplier (Invitrogen). At ∼24 h post-transfection, the cells were radiolabeled with 150 μCi of [35S]Met-Cys (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 3 h. Total cell extracts were prepared in standard radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Wild type and mutant NS3 proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA mAb, and the proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For Western blots, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 3.0% BSA in 1× PBS and then incubated with the appropriate antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After several washes in 1× PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, the membranes were incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody for 30 min at room temperature. The membranes were washed as before, and the proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence and autoradiography. Hygromycin B Permeability Assay—Permeability of the plasma membrane of NS3-transfected cells to hygromycin B was determined as described previously (15Chang Y.S. Liao C.L. Tsao C.H. Chen M.C.

Virol. 1995; 69: 4095-4102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, COS-1 cells were transfected with the plasmid indicated above (pNS3-WT). At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were pretreated with hyg-B (Clontech) for 20 min, and then 150 μCi of [35S]Met-Cys were added to the culture medium. The cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 3 h in the presence or absence of hyg-B. The cell extracts were prepared in 1× radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin (Roche Applied Science). The extracts were clarified for 2 min at 13,000 revolutions/min, and the proteins were then immunoprecipitated with the appropriate antibody overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed three times in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and suspended in 1× Laemmli sample buffer. The proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Indirect Immunofluorescence—COS cells were transfected with plasmids encoding NS3-WT or various NS3 mutants. The cells were fixed with 4.0% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 24 h post-transfection, washed three times with 1× PBS, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature, and finally washed three times with 1× PBS. For the detection of NS3 and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), rat anti-HA mAb was used to detect NS3 proteins, and mouse anti-PDI mAb (Stressgen) was used to detect PDI as an ER marker. For the detection of NS3 and actin, mouse anti-HA mAb was used to detect NS3 proteins, and rhodamine-labeled phalloidin (Molecular Probes) was used to detect F-actin. The cells were mounted with Prolong antifade solution (Molecular Probes) and analyzed by confocal microscopy. NS3 Expression Permeabilizes Cells to Hygromycin B—We wanted to determine whether NS3-WT was capable of destabilizing and/or permeabilizing cell membranes by using a hyg-B permeabilization assay. Hyg-B is a general inhibitor of translation, and it is normally impermeable to mammalian cells when applied for a short period of time at low concentrations. However, hyg-B will enter mammalian cells in which the plasma membrane has been permeabilized. This assay has been used previously by others to identify proteins that can form pores in lipid membranes (15Chang Y.S. Liao C.L. Tsao C.H. Chen M.C. Liu C.I. Chen L.K. Lin Y.L. J.

COS-1 cells were transfected with NS3-WT for 24 h, pretreated with hyg-B for 20 min, and then radiolabeled with [35S]Met-Cys for 3 h. The cells were then incubated an additional 3 h in the absence or presence of hyg-B. The cell extracts were harvested, and NS3-WT was detected by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1A). Extracts from mock-transfected cells are shown as a negative control (Fig. 1A, lane 1). The amounts of NS3, NS3-G (N-linked glycosylated form as shown by digestion with PNGase-F, data not shown), and NS3A decreased in a dose-dependent manner as the concentration of hyg-B added to the growth medium was increased (Fig. 1A, lanes 2–6). The amount of total NS3 protein synthesized was quantitated by phosphorimaging analysis as indicated in Fig. 1A. Also, total cell protein synthesis in NS3-expressing cells was inhibited by hyg-B in a dose-dependent manner as determined by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (data not shown). To demonstrate further that the observed permeability to hyg-B was due to the expression of NS3, cells expressing either NS3 or the membrane-associated VP40 protein of Ebola virus were included in this assay (Fig. 1B). As observed in Fig. 1A, a significant decrease in the level of NS3 protein was observed in cells incubated with 1.0 mm hyg-B compared with those incubated in the absence of hyg-B (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 2 and 3). However, no detectable difference in the level of Ebola virus VP40 was observed under the same experimental conditions. These results suggest that there is specificity to the observed shutoff of protein synthesis and that expression of NS3-WT affects the permeability of the cell to hyg-B. Role of Transmembrane Regions TM1 and TM2 of NS3 in Permeabilizing Mammalian Cells—Because expression of NS3-WT rendered cells permeable to hyg-B, we sought to identify the region(s) of NS3 that was important for this function. We reasoned that the two transmembrane regions identified previously in NS3 would be important; thus, NS3-ΔTM1 and NS3-ΔTM2 deletion mutants were constructed (Fig. 2A) and tested in this hyg-B permeability assay (Fig. 2B). As described above, expression of NS3-WT allowed the entry of hyg-B into cells, resulting in a significant inhibition of protein synthesis, as judged by a decrease in NS3, NS3G, and NS3A protein expression (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 2 and 3). Interestingly, an identical concentration of hyg-B was unable to inhibit protein synthesis in cells expressing NS3-ΔTM1 (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 4 and 5). Unlike the results for NS3-WT, identical amounts of NS3-ΔTM1 were detected in cells incubated in the absence or presence of 1.0 mm hyg-B (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 5). These results were reproducible and indicated that amino acids 118–148 comprising TM1 of NS3 are critical for permeabilization of cells to hyg-B. In contrast to the results obtained with NS3-ΔTM1, hyg-B was able to enter and inhibit protein synthesis in cells expressing NS3-ΔTM2 (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 6 and 7). Thus, unlike TM1, amino acids 156–181 comprising TM2 of NS3 are not essential for permeability to hyg-B. Levels of NS3-WT, NS3-ΔTM1, and NS3-ΔTM2 detected by immunoprecipitation in the presence or absence of hyg-B were quantitated by phosphorimaging analysis (Fig. 2C). Mock-transfected cells served as a negative control (Fig. 2B, lane 1). Intracellular Localization of NS3-WT, -ΔTM1, and -ΔTM2 by Immunofluorescence—Because NS3-ΔTM1 was lacking the proximal transmembrane region, it was likely that the inability of NS3-ΔTM1 to allow entry of hyg-B into cells (Fig. 2) would correlate with a change in intracellular localization. Indirect immunofluorescence was used to determine the intracellular localization patterns for NS3-WT, NS3-ΔTM1, and NS3-ΔTM2 in transfected cells (Fig. 3A). COS-1 cells were transfected with the appropriate plasmid, and the cells were fixed and stained at 24 h post-transfection. As expected, NS3-WT was found to be enriched in the Golgi apparatus and was present in smaller amounts on the plasma membrane (Fig. 3A). The localization pattern for NS3-ΔTM1 was altered significantly compared with that of NS3-WT (Fig. 3A). NS3-ΔTM1 exhibited a more diffuse staining pattern throughout the cytoplasm with no obvious enrichment at either the Golgi apparatus or the plasma membrane (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, the localization pattern of NS3-ΔTM2 (Fig. 3A) more closely resembled that of NS3-WT than that of NS3-ΔTM1. This result is consistent with our finding that NS3-WT and NS3-ΔTM2 function similarly in the hyg-B permeability assay (Fig. 2). We next examined whether NS3-WT, NS3-ΔTM1, and NS3-ΔTM2 co-localized with cellular actin and PDI (ER marker protein) (Fig. 3, B and C). NS3-WT and NS3-ΔTM2 were found to co-localize in part with membrane-bound actin filaments, whereas NS3-ΔTM1 did not exhibit co-localization with actin (Fig. 3B). The majority of NS3-ΔTM1 appeared to co-localize with PDI in the ER (Fig. 3C). Although NS3-WT and NS3-ΔTM2 also displayed some ER staining, both proteins were clearly evident in the Golgi as well (Fig. 3C). Together, these findings indicate that NS3-ΔTM1 is lacking a Golgi targeting signal and that Golgi and membrane targeting appear to correlate with membrane permeabilizing activity. Mutations in TM1 of NS3 Affect Permeability of Hyg-B— Because the TM1 region of NS3 is important for Golgi targeting and membrane permeabilization, we sought to identify sequences within this region responsible for these phenotypes. Toward this end, mutations were introduced into the TM1 region of NS3 to generate mutant 6 (A131E/L132E/L133E) and mutant 7 (L124E/L125E/I126E/A131E/L132E/L133E) (Fig. 4A). Mutants 6 and 7, along with NS3-WT as a positive control and mock- or VP40-transfected cells as negative controls, were employed in the hyg-B permeability assay (Fig. 4B). Once again, protein expression as judged by the level of NS3-WT was reduced significantly in cells incubated in the presence of 1.0 mm hyg-B, whereas expression of Ebola virus VP40 remained unchanged in the absence or presence of 1.0 mm hyg-B (Fig. 4B). In contrast to cells expressing NS3-WT, cells expressing NS3 mutants 6 and 7 remained impermeable to identical amounts of hyg-B (Fig. 4B). Intracellular Localization of NS3-WT and Mutants 6 and 7 by Immunofluorescence—We next sought to determine whether the inability of mutants 6 and 7 to permeabilize cells to hyg-B correlated with an inability to localize to the Golgi. Cells were transfected with plasmids expressing NS3-WT, mutant 6, or mutant 7, and localization of these proteins was determined by indirect immunofluorescence (Fig. 5). NS3-WT localized to the Golgi apparatus and to the plasma membrane in transfected cells (Fig. 5). In contrast, neither mutant 6 nor mutant 7 were found to localize to the Golgi apparatus or to the plasma membrane (Fig. 5). Both mutants displayed an overall diffuse cytoplasmic staining pattern with little to no co-localization with actin (Fig. 5A), but rather a pronounced co-localization with PDI in the ER (Fig. 5B). Thus, these findings are consistent with the TM1 region being important for Golgi targeting and membrane permeabilization. Specifically, amino acids ALL at positions 131–133 appear to be important, and it is likely that the overall hydrophobic nature of TM1 is crucial for viroporin-like activity. Oligomerization of NS3—Virtually all of the viroporins identified to date possess the ability to oligomerize and form aggregates in mammalian cells. Oligomerization of these viral proteins is thought to be critical for the formation and expansion of the hydrophilic pore in lipid bilayers. We sought to determine whether NS3 was able to oligomerize in transfected cells. Human 293T cells were mock-transfected or transfected with NS3-WT, NS3-ΔTM1, or NS3-ΔTM2, and cell extracts were harvested at 24 h post-transfection. The cell extracts were either heated at 95–100 °C in Laemmli sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol or not incubated with β-mercaptoethanol and not heated at 95–100 °C before analysis by SDS-PAGE and Western blot (Fig. 6). A protein species migrating at ∼100–110 kDa (possibly indicative of tetramers) was detected by Western blot only in cell extracts that were not boiled and received no β-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 6, lanes 3, 5, and 7). This high molecular weight form of NS3 was not present under normal reducing conditions (Fig. 6, lanes 4, 6, and 8). The monomeric species of NS3-WT, NS3-ΔTM1, and NS3-ΔTM2 were detected under both reducing and nonreducing conditions (Fig. 6, lanes 3–8). Detection of this high molecular weight species of NS3-WT, NS3-ΔTM1, and NS3-ΔTM2 suggests that these proteins may containing disulfide linkages or may exist in an SDS-resistant form because of their hydrophobic nature. These results also suggest that the TM1 and TM2 regions are not required for homo-oligomerization of NS3. It should be noted that gel filtration analysis was also employed to demonstrate that NS3-WT, NS3-ΔTM1, and NS3-ΔTM2 were able to homo-oligomerize (data not shown). Taken together, these data clearly indicate that NS3 can oligomerize in mammalian cells and that TM1 and TM2 regions are not essential for oligomerization of NS3. The mechanism by which reoviruses, such as bluetongue virus, are released from infected cells is not completely understood. Accumulating evidence indicates that the NS3 protein plays an important role in this late stage of virus replication. The NS3 protein of BTV has recently been postulated to function as a bridging molecule between the VP2 outer capsid protein of BTV and the host annexin II-p11 complex to facilitate virus release (10Beaton A.R. Rodriguez J. Reddy Y.K. Roy P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13154-13159Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Thus, specific virus-host interactions are likely to be important for the efficient release of mature reovirions. Because the NS3 protein is thought to function in virus release, the conservation of the PPXY and PSAP motifs within NS3 was intriguing. The PPXY and PSAP motifs resemble functional L-domains conserved in viral matrix proteins (Gag, VP40, and M) of enveloped RNA viruses (retro-, filo-, and rhabdoviruses) that drive the budding process. The L-domain motifs allow Gag, VP40, and M proteins to bud from cells alone in the form of virus-like particles by mediating interactions with host proteins (11Freed E.O. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 4679-4687Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Although BTV is a nonenveloped virus, these proline-rich motifs may mediate interactions with host proteins to facilitate virus release. However, we found that the PPXY or PSAP motifs of NS3 did not appear to function as typical L-domains (data not shown). It should be noted that although the PPXY and PSAP motifs of NS3 did not function in release of NS3, the possibility that these motifs play a role in the release of infectious BTV, possibly by the recruitment of host proteins to the site of virus release, remains to be determined. Another possible mechanism by which NS3 may contribute to the release of virus particles may involve perturbation or destabilization of the plasma membrane. Indeed, expression of the NS3 protein of African horse sickness virus was shown to destabilize the plasma membrane (8van Staden V. Stoltz M.A. Huismans H. Arch. Virol. 1995; 140: 289-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 9van Niekerk M. Smit C.C. Fick W.C. van Staden V. Huismans H. Virology. 2001; 279: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The ability of NS3 to perturb the plasma membrane, together with its proposed role as a bridging molecule between virions and host proteins, may ensure efficient release of mature virus particles from infected cells (10Beaton A.R. Rodriguez J. Reddy Y.K. Roy P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13154-13159Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrated that the expression of NS3 of BTV resulted in permeability of the plasma membrane to the low molecular weight compound hyg-B. Hyg-B susceptibility assays have been used routinely by others to identify proteins termed viroporins (15Chang Y.S. Liao C.L. Tsao C.H. Chen M.C. Liu C.I. Chen L.K. Lin Y.L. J.

We found that cells expressing NS3-WT were sensitive to hyg-B in a dose-dependent manner, whereas cells expressing membrane-bound VP40 from Ebola virus remained resistant to hyg-B under identical conditions. The membrane permeabilizing activity of NS3 correlated with its targeting to the Golgi apparatus. Indeed, NS3 mutants that were unable to permeabilize cells were also unable to localize to the Golgi apparatus. A similar correlation has been identified for the coxsackievirus 2B viroporin protein (24de Jong A.S. Wessels E. Dijkman H.B. Galama J.M. Melchers W.J. Willems P.H. van Kuppeveld F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1012-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which these Golgi-targeted proteins effect permeabilization of the plasma membrane remains to be determined. In addition, the ability of NS3 to permeabilize the Golgi membrane also remains to be determined. Viroporins are classified as small hydrophobic viral proteins that can permeabilize and destabilize lipid membranes (12Gonzalez M.E. Carrasco L. FEBS Lett. 2003; 552: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Viroporins typically contain at least one stretch of hydrophobic amino acids capable of forming a hydrophilic pore in lipid membranes through which low molecular weight compounds (e.g. hyg-B) and ions (e.g. calcium) may pass. These pores are often formed as a result of oligomerization of the protein. Indeed, our findings clearly indicate that NS3 can oligomerize to form homo-oligomers readily in transfected cells (Fig. 5). Furthermore, disruption of the transmembrane regions of NS3 revealed that amino acids 118–148 of TM1, but not amino acids 156–181 of TM2, were critical for viroporin-like activity and possible pore formation. Mutations that disrupted the hydrophobic nature of TM1 and specifically amino acids 131–133 (ALL) abolished both Golgi targeting and the ability of NS3 to render cells permeable to hyg-B. NS3 of BTV joins a growing list of viral proteins identified as having viroporin-like activity. Viroporins identified thus far include: influenza A virus M2, poliovirus 2BC and 3AB, rotavirus NSP4, HIV-1 gp41, togavirus 6K, human respiratory syncytial virus SH, hepatitis A virus 3A, 2B, and 2BC, hepatitis C virus E1, coxsackievirus 2B, avian reovirus p10, and NS proteins of Japanese encephalitis virus (15Chang Y.S.

For example, the NS proteins of Japanese encephalitis virus have been postulated recently to contribute to viral pathogenesis and cytopathic effects in infected cells because of viroporin-like activity (15Chang Y.S.

A more in-depth structural and functional analysis of BTV NS3 is needed to understand further the potential viroporin-like activity in BTV-infected cells. Results from these future studies will provide us with a better understanding of the precise role of NS3 in virus release and pathogenesis. We thank Dr. A.

https://openalex.org/W2058736807,"As the first known structures of a glycoside hydrolase family 54 (GH54) enzyme, we determined the crystal structures of free and arabinose-complex forms of Aspergillus kawachii IFO4308 α-l-arabinofuranosidase (AkAbfB). AkAbfB comprises two domains: a catalytic domain and an arabinose-binding domain (ABD). The catalytic domain has a β-sandwich fold similar to those of clan-B glycoside hydrolases. ABD has a β-trefoil fold similar to that of carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) family 13. However, ABD shows a number of characteristics distinctive from those of CBM family 13, suggesting that it could be classified into a new CBM family. In the arabinose-complex structure, one of three arabinofuranose molecules is bound to the catalytic domain through many interactions. Interestingly, a disulfide bond formed between two adjacent cysteine residues recognized the arabinofuranose molecule in the active site. From the location of this arabinofuranose and the results of a mutational study, the nucleophile and acid/base residues were determined to be Glu221 and Asp297, respectively. The other two arabinofuranose molecules are bound to ABD. The O-1 atoms of the two arabinofuranose molecules bound at ABD are both pointed toward the solvent, indicating that these sites can both accommodate an arabinofuranose side-chain moiety linked to decorated arabinoxylans.

The plant cell wall is a composite structure consisting mainly of celluloses, hemicelluloses, and lignins. Hemicelluloses are the most abundant renewable biomass polymers next to cellulose, and they are the key components in degradation of the plant biomass. The complete degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose involves many enzymes. The glycosidic bond between two sugars is cleaved by GHs 1The abbreviations used are: GH, glycoside hydrolase; CBM, carbohydrate-binding module; AkAbfA, α-l-arabinofuranosidase A from A. kawachii IFO4308; AkAbfB, α-l-arabinofuranosidase B from A. kawachii IFO4308; AwAbfI, α-l-arabinofuranosidase I from A. awamori IFO4033; AwAbfII, α-l-arabinofuranosidase II from A. awamori IFO4033; GsAbfA, α-l-arabinofuranosidase A from G. stearothermophilus T-6; ABD, arabinose-binding domain; rmsd, root mean square deviation; TrSA, sialidase from T. rangeli; HjPCAbf, α-l-arabinofuranosidase from H. jecorina PC-3–7; HjRuAbf, α-l-arabinofuranosidase/β-xylosidase from H. jecorina RutC-30; RTB, ricin toxin B-chain from R. communis. such as cellulases and hemicellulases. GHs have been classified into more than 90 families based on amino acid sequence similarity (Carbohydrate Active enZYmes server at afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY) (1Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar, 2Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 695-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). They show a wide variety of substrate specificities and great structural diversity. The degradation process is often inefficient because most polymers of celluloses and hemicelluloses are either insoluble or closely associated with the insoluble cellulose matrix. GHs frequently have a comparatively small non-catalytic carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) besides the catalytic domain. CBMs enhance the hydrolysis of insoluble celluloses or hemicelluloses by binding them (3Kuno A. Shimizu D. Kaneko S. Koyama Y. Yoshida S. Kobayashi H. Hayashi K. Taira K. Kusakabe I. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 1998; 86: 434-439Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). They exhibit various types of structures and modes of substrate binding. At present, they are classified into more than 30 families based on sequence and structural similarity (4Gilbert H.J. Bolam D.N. Szabo L. Xie H. Williamson M.P. Simpson P.J. Jamal S. Boraston A.B.

Adv. 2000; 18: 403-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Some of α-l-arabinofuranosidases exhibit broad substrate specificity, acting on arabinofuranoside moieties at O-5, O-2, and/or O-3 as a single substituent (6Saha B.C. Biotechnol. Adv. 2000; 18: 403-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Arabinoxylan, a major component of hemicellulose, has a β-1,4-linked xylopyranose backbone, and generally contains heterogeneous substituents such as l-arabinose, O-acetyl, ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid, and 4-O-methylglucuronic acid (7Puls J. Schuseil J. Coughlan M.P. Hazlewood G.P. Hemicellulose and Hemicellulases. Portland Press, London1993: 1-27Google Scholar). Arabinan has an α-1,5-linked arabinose backbone that is branched via α-1,2- or α-1,3-linked arabinofuranose side chains (8Beldman G. Searle-van Leeuwen M.J.F. De Ruiter G.A. Siliha H.A. Voragen A.G.J. Carbohydr. Polym. 1993; 20: 159-168Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). α-l-Arabinofuranosidases belong to five GH families, 3, 43, 51, 54, and 62. The enzymatic hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds causes retention or inversion of the anomeric configuration. GH3, GH51, and GH54 are retaining enzymes, and GH43 enzymes are inverting ones (9Pitson S.M.

Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 1121-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and two different α-l-arabinofuranosidases, arabinofuranosidase A (AkAbfA) and arabinofuranosidase B (AkAbfB) (13Koseki T. Okuda M. Sudoh S. Kizaki Y. Iwano K. Aramaki I. Matsuzawa H. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2003; 96: 232-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). AkAbfA and AkAbfB are assigned to GH51 and GH54, respectively. GH51 enzymes only hydrolyze small substrates, including short-chain arabino-oligosaccharides, whereas GH54 enzymes are able to hydrolyze polymeric substrates such as arabinoxylans in addition to small substrates (8Beldman G.

The substrate specificities of α-l-arabinofuranosidases I and II (GH51 AwAbfI and GH54 AwAbfII) from Aspergillus awamori IFO 4033, which are highly homologous to AkAbfA and AkAbfB, have been elucidated (5Kaneko S. Arimoto M. Ohba M. Kobayashi H. Ishii T. Kusakabe I. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 4021-4027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both enzymes exhibited broad specificity, acting on α-1,2-, α-1,3- and α-1,5-l-arabinofuranosidic bonds. However, AwAbfI preferentially hydrolyzed the α-1,5-linkage of branched arabinotrisaccharide, whereas AwAbfII preferentially hydrolyzed an α-1,3-linkage in the same substrate and hydrolyzed the arabinosyl side-chain linkage of arabinan. The crystal structure and catalytic residues of GH51 Geobacillus stearothermophilus T-6 α-l-arabinofuranosidase A (GsAbfA) have been determined (15Hovel K. Shallom D. Niefind K. Belakhov V. Shoham G.

These structures revealed that AkAbfB contains a novel CBM that recognizes the arabinose side chains of arabinoxylans. Data Collection—Expression, purification, crystallization, and x-ray data collection of native and xenon-derivatized crystals were previously reported (18Miyanaga A. Koseki T. Matsuzawa H. Wakagi T.

A platinum derivative was prepared by soaking native crystals in 15 mm K2PtCl4 for 2 days. A mercury derivative was prepared by soaking in 10 mm HgCl2 for 2 days. The arabinose complex was prepared by soaking native crystals in 50 mm l-arabinose for 90 min. The xylooligosaccharides reagent, which is a mixture of <5% xylose, 50–70% xylobiose, 20–40% xylotriose, 1–20% of xylotetraose and longer xylooligosaccharides, were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical (Osaka, Japan).

The mutations were confirmed by determining the nucleotide sequences. These plasmids were transformed into Pichia pastoris GS115, and the mutant enzymes were expressed, purified, and assayed as described previously (18Miyanaga A. Koseki T. Matsuzawa H. Wakagi T. Shoun H. Fushinobu S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1286-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Overall Structure—The arabinose-free structure of AkAbfB was determined at 1.75 Å (Table I), and refined to an R-factor of 19.1% and an Rfree factor of 20.9%. Residues 18–499 (the first 17 residues having been removed as a signal peptide) were built. There was one monomer of AkAbfB per asymmetric unit. AkAbfB is an almost all-β protein and is organized into two domains: an N-terminal catalytic domain (residues 18–335) and a C-terminal domain (ABD, residues 336–499) (Fig. 1A). There are three disulfide bonds (Cys21-Cys31, Cys81-Cys86, and Cys176-Cys177) in the catalytic domain and one (Cys401-Cys439) in ABD. All these eight cysteine residues are conserved in GH54 enzymes.Table IData collection, phasing, and refinement statisticsDatasetsAkAbfBK2PtCl4HgCl2NativeArabinoseData collection statisticsBeamlinePF-AR NW12R-axis V++PF-AR NW12PF-AR NW12Wavelength (Å)1.071.541.001.00Space groupP212121P212121P212121P212121Unit-cell parametersa (Å)39.47439.47739.45539.484b (Å)97.94397.31296.89498.796c (Å)143.732143.967145.853144.281Resolution (Å)50.0—2.6072.0—2.8020.0—1.7520.0—2.07(Outer shell)(2.69—2.60)(2.90—2.80)(1.81—1.75)(2.14—2.07)Unique reflections18,09712,15657,83035,261Completeness (%)98.1 (92.8)84.9 (85.6)99.0 (95.2)88.3 (87.2)Rmerge (%)0.091 (0.184)0.109 (0.242)0.058 (0.152)0.049 (0.149)Mean 〈I/σ(I)〉7.9 (5.3)10.7 (6.1)12.5 (7.4)13.8 (5.6)Phasing statisticsPhasing power acentric/centric0.84/0.750.72/0.66Rcullis acentric/centric0.90/0.790.90/0.81Figure of merit0.240.22Number of heavy atom sites45Refinement statisticsRfac (%)19.118.8Rfree (%)20.922.1Number of waters362230Average B-factors (Å2)Protein16.523.4Solvent26.029.2N-Aceytlglucosamine24.337.4Araf129.3Araf224.6Araf328.7 Open table in a new tab At one of the two potential N-glycosylation sites in the AkAbfB sequence, Asn202 exhibited extra electron density emanating from its side-chain amide nitrogen atom. The electron density of two N-acetylglucosamine units was clearly visible, but that of the adjacent mannose unit was not observed (Fig. 2A). N-Linked glycosylation of the recombinant AkAbfB protein expressed in P. pastoris has already been confirmed by SDS-PAGE and periodic acid-Schiff staining (18Miyanaga A. Koseki T. Matsuzawa H. Wakagi T. Shoun H. Fushinobu S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1286-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The native enzyme produced by A. kawachii also contains a glycoside chain (data not shown). The glycosylated recombinant AkAbfB expressed in P. pastoris shows higher activity (29.3 μmol/min/mg) than the Escherichia coli recombinant protein (18.7 μmol/min/mg) (18Miyanaga A. Koseki T. Matsuzawa H. Wakagi T. Shoun H. Fushinobu S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1286-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), but they show almost the same thermostability (data not shown). However, a glycosylation-free (T204A) mutant expressed in P. pastoris exhibited significantly reduced thermostability and slightly reduced catalytic activity compared with the wild-type enzyme. 2T. Koseki, unpublished data. The glycosylation may contribute to the structural integrity of AkAbfB because the glycosylation site is located at the interface between the two domains, far from the active site. Catalytic Domain—The catalytic domain possesses a β-sandwich fold similar to that of concanavalin A-like lectins/glucanase, according to the classification of SCOP (28Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5595) Google Scholar). The β-sandwich fold consists of two anti-parallel β-sheets with seven (β5, β9, β11–β14, and β18) and six (β1, β10, β15–β17, and β19) strands, respectively, and one extra anti-parallel β-sheet with seven (β2–β4, β6–β8, and β20) strands is present on the β-sandwich (Fig. 1D). In addition, there are four (α1–α4) helices outside of the β-strands. The β-sandwich strands are closely packed and curved with a jelly roll topology, creating a small catalytic pocket. The acidic residues present in this pocket, e.g. Asp179, Glu184, Asp189, Asp219, Glu221, and Asp297, make it highly charged to negative (Fig. 3). According to the DALI score (29Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar), the structure of the catalytic domain is closest to that of the non-catalytic lectin-like domain of sialidase from Trypanosoma rangeli (TrSA) (Fig. 1B and Table II, Catalytic domain). Of the 318 residues of AkAbfB, 192 can be superimposed on the lectin-like domain; the Cα rmsd is 2.9 Å (DALI Z-score = 13.8). The non-catalytic lectin-like domain of TrSA is attached to the catalytic GH33 β-propeller domain (30Amaya M.F. Buschiazzo A. Nguyen T. Alzari P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 773-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Most of the β-strands of the lectin-like domain of TrSA and catalytic domain of AkAbfB can be superimposed. However, the corresponding area of the lectin-like domain of TrSA exhibits great deviation from the catalytic pocket of AkAbfB. Possible roles of the non-catalytic domain of TrSA in carbohydrate recognition and cell adhesion mechanisms have been proposed, but no direct evidence has been obtained for these hypotheses (30Amaya M.F. Buschiazzo A. Nguyen T. Alzari P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 773-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).

Structure (Lond.). 2001; 9: 513-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), e.g. GH16 κ-carrageenase and GH7 cellobiohydrolase (Table II, Catalytic domain). The DALI Z-score with κ-carrageenase from Pseudoalteromonas carrageenovora was 10.3 (rmsd = 3.2 Å for 169 residues). κ-Carrageenase folds into a curved β-sandwich, with a tunnel-like active site cleft (31Michel G. Chantalat L. Duee E. Barbeyron T. Henrissat B. Kloareg B. Dideberg O. Structure (Lond.). 2001; 9: 513-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). κ-Carrageenase hydrolyzes the β-1,4-linkage of κ-carrageenan bound to this tunnel. The DALI Z-score with cellobiohydrolase I from Hypocrea jecorina (formerly known as Trichoderma reesei) L27 was 7.8 (rmsd = 3.7 Å for 181 residues). Cellobiohydrolase I also folds into a large β-sandwich, with a 50-Å long cellulose-binding tunnel (32Divne C. Stahlberg J. Reinikainen T. Ruohonen L. Pettersson G. Knowles J.K.C. Teeri T.T. Jones T.A. Science. 1994; 265: 524-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 33Divne C. Stahlberg J. Teeri T.T. Jones T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 309-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Cellobiohydrolase hydrolyzes β-1,4-linkages from the ends of cellulose chains to liberate β-cellobiose. When AkAbfB is superimposed on these enzymes, the substrate binding pocket of AkAbfB lies near these substrate binding tunnels. Both the catalytic residues of AkAbfB (Glu221 and Asp297, described later) are located in the concave pocket of the β-jelly roll fold. However, one of the catalytic residues (Asp297) does not superimpose on any of clan-B enzymes, although the other catalytic residue (Glu221) does. Moreover, AkAbfB does not contain the E-X-D-X-X-E motif of the clan-B enzymes. Thus, the catalytic domain of GH54 AkAbfB is fairly distinct from those of clan-B enzymes, but they may have evolutional relationships. ABD—ABD of AkAbfB possesses a β-trefoil fold (Fig. 4A) (34Rutenber E. Ready M. Robertus J.D. Nature. 1987; 326: 624-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 35Murzin A.G. Lesk A.M. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 531-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). β-Trefoil proteins having a G-X-X-X-Q-X-(W/Y) motif are classified as the ricin B-like family (36Hirabayashi J. Dutta S.K. Kasai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14450-14460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This family is divided into two types, galactose-binding lectins and xylan-binding domains. The xylan-binding domain belongs to CBM family 13. According to the DALI scores, ABD is most closely related to a ricin type lectin, Amaranthus caudatus agglutinin (Z-score = 15.1, rmsd = 2.7 Å for 125 residues) (Table II, ABD). The xylan-binding domain of endo-1,4-β-xylanase from Streptomyces lividans is also structurally similar to ABD (Z-score = 13.9, rmsd = 1.9 Å for 109 residues) (Fig. 4B and Table II, ABD), although the sequence identity between them is only 4.5%. ABD contains three segments of about 50 amino acid residues long (α subdomain: 348–399, β subdomain: 400–446, γ subdomain: 447–499) (Fig. 4, C and D). Each subdomain consists of four-stranded β-hairpin turns and one additional α-helix (α-1), which is inserted between the β-3 and β-4 strands in each subdomain. There is structural similarity between each pair of subdomains (Cα rmsd, αβ:1.6 Å, βγ:1.9 Å, and γα:3.4 Å), and they assemble with a pseudo-3-fold axis. The loop between β-3 and α-1 of the γ subdomain is significantly different from those of the other two subdomains. However, amino acid sequence homology between the subdomains is almost undetectable with only three residues (serine in the β-1 strand and tyrosine and histidine in the β-2 strand) conserved in the three subdomains (Fig. 4D). Three hydrophobic residues present in all subdomains (Leu/Phe in the β-1 strand, Ile/Phe in the β-2 strand, and Trp/Phe in the β-4 strand) gather at the center of the β-trefoil fold, forming a hydrophobic core (Fig. 4D). The hydrophobic core of CBM13 proteins is also formed by hydrophobic residues at similar positions. Therefore, the structural scaffold of ABD is similar to that of CBM13 proteins. However, at least three different characteristics between CBM13 and ABD were found. First, AkAbfB does not contain the G-X-X-X-Q-X-(W/Y) motif of CBM13 (Fig. 4D) (36Hirabayashi J. Dutta S.K. Kasai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14450-14460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It is supposed that the glutamine residue plays an important role in substrate recognition and that the tryptophan residue is involved in formation of the hydrophobic core. Second, hydrophobic residues such as tyrosine are located at the position of the comparatively conserved disulfide bond of CBM13 in each subdomain. Instead, ABD contains one disulfide bond (Cys401–Cys439) on the surface of its β subdomain (Fig. 4A). Third, the sugar binding sites of AkAbfB are completely different from those of CBM13 (described later). Considering the above points, ABD, the non-catalytic β-trefoil domain of GH54, may be classified as a new CBM. In the CAZy data base, GH54 enzymes including AkAbfB have not been mentioned to have any CBMs until now, probably because they do not exhibit any detectable sequence similarity to known CBMs. However, one possible member of GH54, α-l-arabinofuranosidase from H. jecorina PC-3–7 (HjPCAbf), is reported to contain a non-catalytic xylan-binding domain in its C-terminal 18-kDa portion, which can be proteolytically cleaved by pepsin (37Nogawa M. Yatsui K. Tomioka A. Okada H. Morikawa Y. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 3964-3968Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HjPCAbf is probably a member of GH54 because its N-terminal amino acid sequence is almost identical to that of GH54 α-l-arabinofuranosidase/β-xylosidase from H. jecorina RutC-30 (HjRuAbf) (38Margolles-Clark E. Tenkanen M. Nakari-Setala T. Penttila M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3840-3846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the xylan-binding domain of HjPCAbf seems to correspond to the ABD of AkAbfB. Complex Structure with l-Arabinose—An AkAbfB crystal soaked in 50 mm l-arabinose for 90 min diffracted up to 2.07 Å (Table I). The structure was refined to an R-factor of 18.8% and an Rfree factor of 22.1%. The complex structure closely resembled the native structure (Cα rmsd = 0.13 Å). In the electron density map, one arabinofuranose molecule was found in the catalytic domain and two in ABD (Fig. 2, B–D). AkAbfB crystals soaked in 125 mm d-xylose or a 5% solution of the mixture of xylooligosaccharides (see “Experimental Procedures”) for at least 3 h were prepared to determine whether they form a complex, but no significant electron density corresponding to a sugar moiety was observed. One Arabinose Molecule in the Catalytic Domain—One arabinofuranose molecule was found in the negatively charged pocket of the catalytic domain. Because AkAbfB cleaves α-1,2- and α-1,3-arabinofuranosidic bonds, this site is assigned as subsite -1. The arabinofuranose molecule is recognized because of many hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 5). The electron density of the O-1 atom was disordered (Fig. 2B), probably because the hydroxyl group was reduced or it took both α and β configurations. Three other hydroxyl groups, e.g. O-2, O-3, and O-5, form one or two possible hydrogen bonds with AkAbfB. The location of the +1 subsite could not be confirmed in this study. The site appears to be located outside of the catalytic po"

The type 1 repeats of TSP1 differ from typical integrin ligands in that recognition is pan-β1-specific. Adhesion of cells that express one dominant β1 integrin on immobilized type 1 repeats is specifically inhibited by antagonists of that integrin, whereas adhesion of cells that express several β1 integrins is partially inhibited by each α-subunit-specific antagonist and completely inhibited by combining the antagonists. β1 integrins recognize both the second and third type 1 repeats, and each type 1 repeat shows pan-β1 specificity and divalent cation dependence for promoting cell adhesion. Adhesion to the type 2 repeats is less sensitive to α-subunit antagonists, but a β1 blocking antibody and two disintegrins inhibit adhesion to immobilized type 2 repeats. β1 integrin expression is necessary for cell adhesion to the type 1 or type 2 repeats, and β1 integrins bind in a divalent cation-dependent manner to a type 1 repeat affinity column. The widely used TSP1 function blocking antibody A4.1 binds to a site in the third type 2 repeat. A4.1 proximally inhibits β1 integrin-dependent adhesion to the type 2 repeats and indirectly inhibits integrin-dependent adhesion mediated by the TSP1 type 1 repeats. Although antibody A4.1 is also an antagonist of CD36 binding to TSP1, these data suggest that some biological activities of A4.1 result from antagonism of these novel β1 integrin binding sites.

Although three β1 integrin binding sites in TSP1 have now been described, at least two publications have noted β1 integrin-dependent activities of TSP1 that cannot be explained by these known sites. DeFreitas et al. (11DeFreitas M.F. Yoshida C.K. Frazier W.A. Mendrick D.L. Kypta R.M. Reichardt L.F. Neuron. 1995; 15: 333-343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) report that a TSP1 antibody (A4.1), which was believed to recognize the type 1 repeats (TSR, also known as properdin repeats) (10Prater C.A. Plotkin J. Jaye D. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 1031-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), inhibited α3β1-dependent neurite outgrowth on TSP1 (11DeFreitas M.F. Yoshida C.K. Frazier W.A. Mendrick D.L. Kypta R.M. Reichardt L.F. Neuron. 1995; 15: 333-343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). They further noted that a 50/70-kDa chymotryptic fragment of TSP1 containing the procollagen domain, the three TSRs, and part of the EGF-like type 2 repeats supported neurite outgrowth, which was completely inhibited by a β1 antibody. Approximately 80% of this response was inhibited by α3β1-specific antibodies. Furthermore, adhesion of osteosarcoma cells to a similar 70-kDa core fragment of TSP1 produced by limited proteolysis with chymotrypsin in the absence of calcium was α4β1-dependent (12Decker S. van Valen F. Vischer P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Notably, none of these proteolytic fragments contain the N-module or the RGD sequence of TSP1. These publications suggested that α4β1 and α3β1 recognize additional sites in the central stalk region of TSP1, possibly in the TSRs. Using recombinant regions of TSP1, we have now verified that activated α4β1 and α3β1 recognize secondary sites in this region of TSP1. We report here evidence for three such sites in the second and third TSRs and in the type 2 repeats of TSP1. However, we find that the specificity of these sites differs from those of most previously described integrin ligands in that they are pan-β1-specific. We further show that a widely used TSP1 function blocking antibody, A4.1, inhibits β1 integrin recognition of both repeats in TSP1.

All cell cultures were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-231 (American Type Culture Collection) was maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Adhesion Assays—TSP1, recombinant proteins derived from TSP1 (summarized in Fig. 1A), or type I collagen was adsorbed (triplicates of 8-μl drops) onto polystyrene dishes (Falcon 1008) by incubating overnight at 4 °C. The drops were removed, and the dishes were blocked with 1% BSA, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min. Cells were dissociated with 2 mm EDTA in PBS and resuspended in RPMI, 0.1% BSA (Jurkat, MDA-MB-231 and messangial cells) or M199, 0.1% BSA (human umbilical vein endothelial and human dermal microvascular cells) at 5 × 106 cells/ml. For activation cells were treated with 5–10 μg/ml TS2/16 antibody, 20 ng/ml PMA, or 0.1 mm MnCl2. For inhibition TSP1 antibodies A4.1 or HB8432, specific α integrin-blocking antibodies, or integrin antagonists at the indicated concentrations were used. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2, the dishes were washed 3 times with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and fixed for 30 min with 1% glutaraldehyde, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline. After staining with Diff-Quik, cells were counted microscopically in 0.25-mm2 fields for each triplicate analysis. Integrin Purification by TSR Affinity—A TSR123 affinity column was prepared using a CNBr-activated agarose bead matrix (following the manufacturer's protocol). Surface-biotinylated Jurkat cells (2–5 × 108) were lysed in the presence of 5–10 ml of buffer containing 100 mmn-octylglucoside, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After removal of insoluble material by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 20 min, the extract was concentrated to 1 ml using Centripep 10 (Millipore). The column was previously washed with equilibration buffer containing 25 mmn-octylglucoside, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 0.5 mm MnCl2. The cell extract was applied to the column and incubated for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The column was washed with equilibration buffer until protein disappeared from the eluate, then washed again with washing buffer (equilibration buffer with 300 mm NaCl) until protein disappeared from the eluate. Finally, the integrin was eluted from the column by adding washing buffer plus 15 mm EDTA. Fractions of 200–300 μl were collected in 1.5-ml tubes with 6 μl of 1 m MgCl2. The fractions were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred into polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and incubated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase. Protein bands were detected by chemiluminescence (Pierce). The fractions containing the integrins were also immunoprecipitated with anti-β1 integrin antibody. As a control for this experiment and to assure that the interaction of TSRs with β1 integrins was not mediated by fibronectin, surface-biotinylated Jurkat cells lysates were also immunoprecipitated with a fibronectin antibody (13G12) to determine the presence of this protein in the cell lysates. Competition Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—TSP1 was diluted to 0.005 μm on a subunit basis in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) plus 2mm calcium, and Probind 96-wellmicrotiter plates were coated for 16 h at 4 °C with 50 μl/well of the diluted solution. The plates were washed once with TBS plus 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) and blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk and 1% BSA for 1 h. The recombinant TSP fragments (competitors) and A4.1 were diluted so that when combined the final concentrations for each competitor was 3.0, 1.0, 0.3, 0.1, 0.03, 0.01, or 0 μm, and the final concentration of the A4.1 was 3.0 μg/ml (∼0.003 μm IgM pentamer or 0.03 μm IgM Fab segment). The competitors were added to A4.1 in microcentrifuge tubes, and the mixtures were incubated for 1 h before being added to the blocked and washed TSP1-coated plates. After 2 h in the wells, the mixtures were removed, and the wells were washed 4 times with TBST. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM (μ chain-specific) from Sigma was diluted 1:3000 in TBST plus 0.1% nonfat dried milk and 0.02% BSA and incubated for 1 h with the plate. After washing 4 times with TBST, Sigma 104 alkaline phosphatase substrate at 1 mg/ml in TBS, pH 9.0, was added to each well. Color development was monitored at 405 nm. Three Domains of TSP1 Are Recognized by β1 Integrins—In addition to the three known β1 integrin binding sites in the N-module of TSP1 (3Li Z. Calzada M.J. Sipes J.M. Cashel J.A. Krutzsch H.C.

Of several cell types examined, mesangial cells attached and spread most avidly to both the type1 and type 2 repeats, which was enhanced after activation of β1 integrins using the antibody TS2/16 (Fig. 1B). At equimolar concentrations, NoC1 supported slightly less adhesion than intact TSP1, and three constructs containing all or only the third TSR supported adhesion at ∼50% of this level. The type 2 repeats alone were weakly active at this concentration, whereas the C-terminal regions of TSP1 were inactive. Results were qualitatively similar using TS2/16-activated Jurkat T cells (Fig. 1C), although these cells do not spread due to their limited cytoplasmic volume. Dose-response curves showed that NoC1 is ∼3-fold less active than intact TSP1 for mediating cell attachment, and CTSR123 is 13-fold less active. Endothelial cells also recognized the TSRs but did not adhere at significant levels on the type 2 repeats (Fig. 1, D and E, and results not shown). As noted for the other cell types, adhesion was stimulated by the β1 antibody TS2/16 (results not shown). Adhesion of endothelial cells on the third TSR (TSR3) was completely inhibited by a β1-blocking antibody (mAb13), but 30–50% of adhesion on the second TSR was resistant to this antibody. To verify that β1 integrins are required for cell adhesion to the TSRs, a somatic mutant of Jurkat cells deficient in all β1 integrins was examined (Fig. 2). Adhesion of wild type Jurkat cells to TSR123 containing all three TSRs was stimulated by TS2/16 and to a lesser extent by phorbol ester. The latter response was completely blocked by the β1-specific blocking antibody mAb13 (Fig. 2A), indicating that the type 1 repeats are recognized by β1 but not by β2 or β7 integrins, which are also expressed on Jurkat cells (26Romzek N.C. Harris E.S. Dell C.L. Skronek J. Hasse E. Reynolds P.J. Hunt III, S.W. Shimizu Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2715-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Activation-dependent adhesion was absent in the A1 somatic mutant lacking β1 (26Romzek N.C. Harris E.S. Dell C.L. Skronek J. Hasse E. Reynolds P.J. Hunt III, S.W. Shimizu Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2715-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), further indicating that β2 and β7 integrins do not recognize the TSRs. Therefore, β1 integrins are necessary for T cell adhesion on the TSRs. Because the TSP1 TSRs are known to interact with CD36, which associates with at least two β1 integrins (27Thorne R.F. Marshall J.F. Shafren D.R. Gibson P.G. Hart I.R. Burns G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35264-35275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and with the β1 integrin ligand fibronectin (28Sipes J.M. Guo N. Negre E. Vogel T. Krutzsch H.C. Roberts D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 469-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), β1 integrin-dependent adhesion to the TSRs could be indirect. However, detergent-solubilized β1 integrins bound to an affinity column of TSR123 and were specifically eluted by chelating divalent cations (Fig. 2B). Based on immunoprecipitation with the antibody TS2/16, the major proteins eluted under these conditions corresponded to β1 integrin with a molecular mass around 130 kDa, which in Jurkat cells associates primarily with α4 and α5 subunits (140 and 135 kDa, respectively, under reducing conditions). Indirect interaction of integrins with the TSRs mediated by CD36 can be excluded because Jurkat cells do not express detectable levels of this receptor. Neither was fibronectin involved, because immunoprecipitation of biotinylated Jurkat cells using a specific fibronectin antibody did not detect this protein in the cell lysate (data not shown). Phorbol ester treatment and TS2/16 similarly induced Jurkat T cell adhesion to E123, containing the three type 2 repeats of TSP1 (Fig. 2C). PMA-stimulated adhesion to the type 2 repeats was completely inhibited by the β1 antibody mAb13, indicating specificity for β1 integrins. The Jurkat A1 mutant was inactive, demonstrating that β1 integrins are also necessary for adhesion of T cells on the EGF-like repeats of TSP1. TSP1 Type 1 Repeats Are pan-β1 Integrin Ligands—Several αβ1 dimer-specific blocking antibodies and antagonists were tested to determine which β1 integrins recognize the TSRs (Fig. 3). Remarkably, the β1 integrin specificity for adhesion on TSP1 type 1 repeats was cell type-specific. Jurkat cell adhesion on the type 1 repeats was partially inhibited by an α4β1 integrin antagonist, but α3, α2, and αv inhibitors were inactive (Fig. 3A). The potent α4 antagonist phLDVP inhibited adhesion on the type 1 repeats by ∼40%, whereas it inhibited adhesion on the N-terminal region of TSP1 by more than 80%, suggesting that additional β1 integrins may contribute to T cell adhesion on the TSRs, although α4β1 is the most abundant β1 integrin expressed by Jurkat T cells (26Romzek N.C. Harris E.S. Dell C.L. Skronek J. Hasse E. Reynolds P.J. Hunt III, S.W. Shimizu Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2715-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Notably, none of the specific β1 integrin blocking antibodies or antagonists except mAb13 significantly inhibited activation-dependent Jurkat cell adhesion on the type 2 repeats (Fig. 3A). In contrast to T cells, MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cell attachment on the TSRs was inhibited by α2β1 and α3β1 function-blocking antibodies but not by the α4β1 antagonist (Fig. 3B). Neither α3β1 nor α2β1 antibodies completely inhibited MDA-MB-231 cell attachment. In the case of the α2β1 antibody, this was not due to a limiting antibody concentration because cell attachment on type I collagen was inhibited to a much greater extent. Combining the α2 and α3 antibodies, however, produced a specific additive effect for adhesion on TSR123 but not on NoC1 or type I collagen, suggesting that both integrins recognize the TSRs. However, the α4 antagonist, which inhibited T cell adhesion to the same protein (Fig. 3A), was inactive and showed no additivity with the α2β1 antibody. Lack of activity of the α4 antagonist presumably is due to absence of α4 expression, because the α4 antagonist also had no effect on the known α4β1 ligand NoC1, which was recognized exclusively by α3β1 in the breast carcinoma cells (Fig. 3B). Based on these results, α2β1 and α3β1, but not α4β1, are adhesion receptors in MDA-MB-231 cells for the TSP1 TSRs. Notably, α2β1 and α3β1 are the most abundant integrins expressed by MDA-MB-231 cells (29Morini M. Mottolese M. Ferrari N. Ghiorzo F. Buglioni S. Mortarini R. Noonan D.M. Natali P.G. Albini A. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 87: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Mesangial cells exhibited a third phenotype (Fig. 3C). Antibodies to several β1 integrins, including α1β1, α2β1, α3β1, and α6β1, partially inhibited mesangial cell spreading on the type 1 repeats of TSP1. Small molecule antagonists of α4β1 and αv integrins were also partially inhibitory. However, the β1 antibody completely inhibited spreading (Fig. 3C) and inhibited overall cell attachment by ∼50% (results not shown). Consistent with this result and the partial inhibition by antagonizing individual integrins, additive effects were observed by combining the α2β1 antibody and the αv antagonist. Therefore, α1β1, α2β1, α3β1, α4β1, α6β1, and αvβ1 integrins all contribute to mesangial cell adhesion on the TSP1 TSRs. Although apparently contradictory, the disparate data for these three cell lines can be rationalized by considering the relative expression levels of the various β1 integrin in each cell line. Adhesion to the TSRs was inhibited by blocking the most abundant β1 integrins in cells that express a limited integrin repertoire, α4β1 in Jurkat cells (26Romzek N.C. Harris E.S. Dell C.L. Skronek J. Hasse E. Reynolds P.J. Hunt III, S.W. Shimizu Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2715-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and α2β1 and α3β1 in MDA-MB-231 cells (29Morini M. Mottolese M.

Krutzsch H.C. Roberts D.D. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1541-1548PubMed Google Scholar). Mesangial cells express a broader range of β1 integrins, including α1β1, α2β1, α3β1, α5β1, α6β1, α8β1, and αvβ1 (25Banas B. Luckow B. Moller M. Klier C. Nelson P.J. Schadde E. Brigl M. Halevy D.

Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1468-1480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and most α-specific antagonists affected adhesion of these cells to the TSRs. This suggests that the TSRs are pan-specific ligands for β1 integrins. Both TSR2 and TSR3 Are Recognized by β1 Integrins—The above results could be explained either by a single promiscuous β1 integrin binding site in the TSRs or by the presence of distinct binding sites for each integrin. To further localize the integrin binding site(s) in the TSRs of TSP1, recombinant forms of the second and third TSRs were tested for adhesive activity (Fig. 4). TS2/16 stimulated mesangial cell adhesion on both the second and third TSRs, although the third TSR was ∼2-fold more active (Fig. 4A). However, these two TSRs alone were less active than a construct containing all three TSRs (TSR123) or intact TSP1. In the absence of activation, mesangial cells also showed significant dose-dependent adhesion to TSR2, TSR123, and intact TSP1. The absence of adhesion of unstimulated cells to TSR3 may be an artifact of the limited concentration of this fragment that could be tested or its relatively inefficient adsorption on polystyrene. Adhesion to the two individual TSRs exhibited the divalent cation dependence typical of integrin mediated adhesion (Fig. 4B). The addition of 0.4 mm Mn2+-stimulated adhesion and the addition of 10 mm EDTA abolished mesangial cell spreading and cell attachment on both TSR2 and TSR3. Spreading on TSR123 was also abolished by EDTA, but attachment was only partially inhibited by EDTA. Attachment on type I collagen that was even stronger than to TSR123 was completely inhibited by EDTA, suggesting that some mesangial cell attachment on the full-length type 1 repeats is divalent cation-independent. To determine whether the apparent pan β1 integrin specificity is intrinsic to each repeat or results from each TSR recognizing different β1 integrins, we compared their activities to promote adhesion of T cells and breast carcinoma cells (Fig. 4, C–D). Adhesion of Jurkat T cells to TSR2 or TSR3 was inhibited strongly by blocking α4β1 and weakly by blocking α5β1 (Fig. 4C). Adhesion of MDA-MB-231 cells to TSR2 or TSR3 was inhibited partially by blocking α2β1 or α3β1 and completely by blocking both integrins (Fig. 4C). This additivity was not observed for adhesion of the same cells on NoC1, which MDA-MB-231 cells recognize exclusively via α3β1 (33Chandrasekaran S. Guo N. Rodrigues R.G. Kaiser J. Roberts D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11408-11416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Based on the ability of both TSR2 and TSR3 to be recognized by at least three different β1 integrins in a cell-specific manner, we conclude that at least the second and third TSRs of TSP1 have pan-specific β1 integrin binding sites. Several functional peptide sequences have been identified in the TSRs that interact with other known TSP1 ligands or receptors. To determine whether any of these known functional sequences contribute to int"
https://openalex.org/W2000408299,"The physiologies of cells depend on electrochemical signals carried by ion channels and receptors. Venomous animals produce an enormous variety of peptide toxins with high affinity for specific ion channels and receptors. The mammalian prototoxin lynx1 shares with alpha-bungarotoxin the ability to bind and modulate nicotinic receptors (nAChRs); however, lynx1 is tethered to the membrane via a GPI anchor. We show here that several classes of neurotoxins, including bungarotoxins and cobratoxins, retain their selective antagonistic properties when tethered to the membrane. Targeted elimination of nAChR function in zebrafish can be achieved with tethered alpha-bungarotoxin, silencing synaptic transmission without perturbing synapse formation. These studies harness the pharmacological properties of peptide toxins for use in genetic experiments. When combined with specific methods of cell and temporal expression, the extension of this approach to hundreds of naturally occurring peptide toxins opens a new landscape for cell-autonomous regulation of cellular physiology in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2105837877,"Lung surfactant is the surface-active agent comprised of phospholipids and proteins that lines pulmonary alveoli. Surfactant stabilizes the alveolar volume by reducing surface tension. Previously, we identified a lysosomal phospholipase A2, termed LPLA2, with specificity toward phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. The phospholipase is localized to lysosomes, is calcium-independent, has an acidic pH optimum, and transacylates ceramide. Here, we demonstrate that LPLA2 is selectively expressed in alveolar macrophages but not in peritoneal macrophages, peripheral blood monocytes, or other tissues. Other macrophage-associated phospholipase A2s do not show a comparable distribution. LPLA2 is of high specific activity and recognizes disaturated phosphatidylcholine as a substrate. The lysosomal phospholipase A2 activity is six times lower in alveolar macrophages from mice with a targeted deletion of the granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), a model of impaired surfactant catabolism, compared with those from wild-type mice. However, LPLA2 activity and protein levels are measured in GM-CSF null mice in which GM-CSF is expressed as a transgene under the control of the surfactant protein C promoter. Thus LPLA2 may be a major enzyme of pulmonary surfactant phospholipid degradation by alveolar macrophages and may be deficient in disorders of surfactant metabolism.

In the presence of ceramide, the enzyme catalyzes the formation of 1-O-acylceramide by transacylation of fatty acids from the sn-2 position of phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine. In the absence of ceramide or other alcohols as acceptors, the enzyme acts as a traditional phospholipase A2. However, the phospholipase has a pH optimum of 4.5 and is mannose-rich and calcium-independent (2Abe A. Shayman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8467-8474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The phospholipase amino acid sequence is 49% identical to human LCAT (3Hiraoka M. Abe A. Shayman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10090-10099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The homology with LCAT is highest within the catalytic domain, but the phospholipase does not recognize cholesterol as an acceptor for the fatty acid. The phospholipase colocalizes with other lysosomal proteins in cell fractionates. Upon the initial characterization of this enzyme, the functional role of this phospholipase A2 was not immediately apparent. A role for an acidic phospholipase A2 activity has previously been suggested for the degradation of pulmonary surfactant phospholipids (4Rao R.H. Waite M. Myrvik Q.N. Exp. Lung Res. 1981; 2: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The pulmonary acidic phospholipase A2 activity is also reported to be calcium-independent and inhibited by a transition state analog of arachidonate, MJ33 (5Fisher A.B. Dodia C. Chander A. Jain M.

In rats treated with MJ33 the surfactant phospholipid catabolism was inhibited by ∼40–50%, suggesting that the drug-sensitive phospholipase A2 activity contributes significantly to total surfactant degradation (6Fisher A.B. Dodia C. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: L748-L754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present paper LPLA2 was studied in alveolar macrophages to determine whether this enzyme might play a role in pulmonary surfactant catabolism. Reagents—Phosphatidylethanolamine, 1,2-dioleloyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (DOPC), and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (DPPC) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Dicetyl phosphate and monoclonal anti-c-Myc clone 9E10 mouse ascites fluid were purchased from Sigma, MJ33 was from Calbiochem, and N-Acetyl-d-erythro-sphingosine (NAS) was from Matreya (Pleasant Gap, PA). BCA protein assay reagent was obtained from Pierce. Isolation of Rat Cells and Tissues—Respiratory disease-free female Wistar rats (125–150 g) were obtained from Charles River Laboratories, Inc. (Portage, MI) and housed under specific pathogen-free conditions. For isolation of alveolar macrophages by bronchoalveolar lavage, lavage buffer consisting of 0.15 m NaCl, 2.7 mm EDTA, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 5.5 mm dextrose, and 1× antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Invitrogen) was used. Following anesthesia with subcutaneous sodium pentobarbital, lungs were surgically excised and lavaged as reported (7Peters-Golden M. Thebert P. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1987; 135: 1020-1026PubMed Google Scholar). Peritoneal macrophages were obtained by lavage of peritoneal spaces with RPMI 1640 medium containing 1× antibiotic-antimycotic solution. Contaminated erythrocytes were removed by hypotonic lysis. Peripheral blood monocytes were isolated by centrifugation with Histopaque-1077 (Sigma). After counting, cells were suspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 1× antibiotic-antimycotic solution and plated in 100-mm culture dishes followed by incubation at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. After 1 h, non-adherent cells were removed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline. Ninety-five percent of alveolar lavaged cells and 81% of peritoneal lavaged cells in the resultant adherent cell population were macrophages as confirmed by Wright-Giemsa staining (8Coffey M. Peters-Golden M. Fantone III, J.C. Sporn P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 570-576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Greater than 90% of the adherent peripheral blood mononuclear cells were monocytes (9Coffey M.J. Phare S.M. Peters-Golden M. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3592-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Isolation of Mouse Cells and Tissues—Wild-type C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). GM-CSF(–/–) was generated by Dranoff et al. (10Dranoff G. Crawford A.D. Sadelain M. Ream B. Rashid A. Bronson R.T. Dickersin G.R. Bachurski C.J. Mark E.L. Whitsett J.A. Mulligan R.C. Science. 1994; 264: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Bi-transgenic mice were generated from GM-CSF(–/–) mice by transgenic expression of a chimeric gene containing GM-CSF under the surfactant protein C (SP-C) promoter (SP-C-GM mice) (11Huffman J.A. Hull W.M. Dranoff G. Mulligan R.C. Whitsett J.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 97: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The specificity of the SP-C promoter results in targeted expression of GM-CSF by type II alveolar epithelial cells. Founder GM-CSF(–/–) and SP-C-GM mice were kindly provided by Dr. J. Whitsett (Children's Hospital, Cincinnati, OH). After anesthesia with intraperitoneal sodium pentobarbital, the trachea was cannulated and the lung was lavaged with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5 mm EDTA as described previously (12Paine III, R. Preston A.M. Wilcoxen S. Jin H. Siu B.B. Morris S.B. Reed J.A. Ross G. Whitsett J.A. Beck J.M. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2602-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The lavage fluid of each group was pooled, and the cell pellet was collected by centrifugation. All mice were housed in specific pathogen-free conditions. Mice were used at 3–5 months of age. All experiments were approved by the University of Michigan Committee on the Use and Care of Animals. RNA Extraction and cDNA Synthesis—Total RNA was extracted from each rat organ using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) followed by purification using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). For isolated cells, total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy kit. Total RNA was used to synthesize cDNA with oligo(dT)12–18 primers in the SuperScript First-Stand synthesis system (Invitrogen). Primers and Standard Plasmid for Real Time PCR—Primers were designed from the LPLA2 (GenBank™ accession number AY490816), 1-Cys-peroxiredoxin 6 (Prdx6) (NM053576), and cytosolic calcium-independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2) (XM_346803) gene sequences, respectively. The rat iPLA2 gene sequence was deduced from its amino acid sequence (P97570). The primer sets were as follows: LPLA2, 5′-A-CATGCTCTACTTTCTGCAGCGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGAAGCACAC-GTTTCAGATA-3′ (reverse); Prdx6, 5′-CAGTGTGCACCACAGAACTT-G-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGCTCTTTGGTGAAGACTCCT-3′ (reverse); and iPLA2, 5′-ACTACATCTGGCCTGCCGCAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGAA-GCATTCGGGCCATCTC-3′ (reverse). Standard plasmids were generated with the respective PCR products of LPLA2, Prdx6, and iPLA2 ligated into the pCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and followed by cloning, purification, quantification, and sequencing. Quantitative Analysis of LPLA2, Prdx6, and iPLA2 mRNA Expression by Real Time PCR—A standard curve for each primer set was generated by a serial dilution of a TOPO vector containing each partial gene sequence. One microliter of synthesized cDNA mixture was used for real time PCR. The Expand high fidelity PCR system (Roche Diagnostics) containing SYBR Green (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was used for the PCR reaction mixture. The PCR amplifications employed 40 cycles with steps at 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. The iCycler instrument (BioRad) was used to perform PCR and analyze data. The quality and quantity of each RNA were determined by the Agilent bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). The mRNA concentrations were normalized to the total RNA. Preparation of the Soluble Fraction from Rat Alveolar and Peritoneal Macrophages, Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells, and Tissues—For preparation of the soluble fractions of alveolar macrophages, peritoneal macrophages, and peripheral blood monocytes, the adherent cells on the culture dishes were washed three times with 8 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped with a small volume of phosphate-buffered saline, and transferred into a 15-ml plastic tube. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, re-suspended with 0.4–1.0 ml of cold 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), and 1 mm EDTA and disrupted by a probe-type sonicator for 10 s × 5at0 °C. The suspension was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. The resultant supernatant was passed through a 0.2-μm filter and used as a soluble fraction. For the preparation of rat tissue soluble fractions, each tissue was washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, weighed, and homogenized by a Potter-Elvehjem-type homogenizer with cold 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), and 1 mm EDTA to obtain 10% homogenate. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 600 × g at 4 °C. The resultant supernatant was sonicated by a probe-type sonicator for 10 s × 5at 0 °C and centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was passed through a 0.2-μm filter and used as a soluble fraction. For the preparation of the soluble fraction of mouse alveolar macrophages, the macrophages were collected from wild-type (C57BL/6), GM-CSF (–/–), and SP-C-GM mice by whole lung lavage and pooled as described above. The cell pellets were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in cold 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), and 1 mm EDTA. The suspension was disrupted by a probe-type sonicator and followed the same procedure as described above. Enzyme Assay (Transacylase Activity)—The phospholipids DOPC and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) along with NAS were used in the assay system as donor and acceptor, respectively, of an acyl group. The transacylase activity was determined by analysis of the 1-O-acyl-N-acetylsphingosine formation rate. The reaction mixture consisted of 45 mm sodium citrate (pH 4.5), 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 40 μm NAS incorporated into phospholipid liposomes (DOPC/PE/dicetyl phosphate/NAS (5:2:1:2 in molar ratio)), and a soluble fraction (0.7–10 μg) in a total volume of 500 μl. The reaction was initiated by adding the soluble fraction, kept for 5–60 min at 37 °C, and terminated by adding 3 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1) plus 0.3 ml of 0.9% (w/v) NaCl. The mixture was centrifuged for 5 min at room temperature. The resultant lower layer was transferred into another glass tube and dried down under a stream of nitrogen gas. The dried lipid, dissolved in 40 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1), was applied on a high performance thin layer chromatography plate and developed in a solvent system consisting of chloroform/acetic acid (9:1). The plate was dried down and soaked in 8% (w/v) CuSO4, 5H2O, 6.8% (v/v) H3PO4, and 32% (v/v) methanol. The uniformly wet plate was briefly dried down by a hair dryer and charred for 15 min in a 150 °C oven. The plate was scanned, and the amount of the reaction products was estimated by the NIH Image program version 1.62. Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine Degradation Studies—The reaction mixture consisted of 47 mm sodium citrate (pH 4.5), 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, liposomes (130 μm phospholipids), and 2.59 μg/ml of the soluble fraction of rat alveolar macrophages in a total volume of 500 μl. The liposomes consisted of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, dioleoylphosphatidylcholine, and dicetyl phosphate at a molar ratio of 50:50:16. Trace 1-palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]palmitoyl-l-3-phosphatidylcholine (2.55 × 105 cpm/assay) was added. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 15 μl of the soluble macrophage fraction or sucrose buffer and incubated for 40, 80, and 120 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 3 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1) plus 300 μl of 0.9% NaCl. The resultant lower layer was transferred into a small glass tube and dried down under a stream of nitrogen gas. The dried lipid was redissolved with chloroform/methanol (2:1) and applied to high performance thin layer chromatography plates. The free fatty acid and lysophosphatidylcholine were separated in solvent systems consisting of chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (98:2:1) and chloroform/methanol/water (60:35:8), respectively. Each plate was dried and sprayed with 10 μg/ml primulin in acetone/water (60:40). The products were detected under ultraviolet light, scraped, and transferred into scintillation vials. The silica gel was dispersed in 5 ml of ECOLUME (ICN Biomedicals) by a sonic bath and counted. Immunoblotting—The soluble fraction was precipitated by the method of Bensadoun and Weinstein (13Bensadoun A. Weinstein D. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 70: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar). The resultant pellet was dissolved with 30 μl of loading buffer consisting of 125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 1% SDS, 10% glycerol, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10 μg/ml bromphenol blue in addition to 1.5 μl of 2 m Tris for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were separated using a 12% acrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using the transfer buffer (20 mm Tris and 150 mm glycine in 20% methanol) at a constant voltage of 100 volts for 3 h at 4 °C. The membrane was incubated with an anti-mouse LPLA2 peptide (100RTSRATQFPD109) rabbit serum and monoclonal anti-c-Myc mouse ascites fluid. The antigen-antibody complex on the membrane was visualized with an anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antibody or an anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antibody using diaminobenzidine and hydrogen peroxide. A series of tissues from the Wistar rat were isolated and assayed for lysosomal phospholipase A2 activity (Fig. 1A). Because the lysosomal phospholipase A2 can transacylate ceramide at the 1-hydroxyl position, the transacylase activity was determined as the formation of 1-O-acyl-N-acetylsphingosine (1-O-acyl-NAS). The enzyme activity was comparable in a wide range of tissues including brain, kidney, spleen, thymus, and lung. Of the tissues assayed, the specific activity was highest in thymus and spleen, suggesting that hematopoietic cells might be a source of higher enzyme activity. Pulmonary alveolar macrophages were studied next. When pulmonary alveolar macrophages were isolated by bronchoalveolar lavage and assayed for phospholipase A2 activity, a >40-fold higher activity of the lipase was observed compared with that of other tissues. This difference was not present in either peritoneal macrophages or peripheral blood monocytes. A comparison of the enzyme activity between peritoneal macrophages, peripheral blood monocytes, and alveolar macrophages was made. The higher LPLA2 activity in alveolar macrophages compared with that in peritoneal macrophages and monocytes was evidenced by the formation of 1-O-acyl-N-acetylsphingosine and free fatty acid (Fig. 1B). Because the initial velocity of the reaction in the alveolar macrophage was significantly greater than that observed in other cells and tissues, the reaction time was shortened to 5 min from 30 min, and the assay protein was lowered to 0.9 μg from 10 μg (Fig. 1C). Under these conditions, the phospholipase A2 activity was linear. The enzyme activities in the peritoneal macrophages and monocytes were slightly higher but comparable with those observed in the other tissues and significantly less than that measured in the alveolar macrophages. These data suggest that elevated lysosomal phospholipase A2 is a marker of the terminally differentiated alveolar macrophage. We also evaluated the mRNA expression of LPLA2 in the tissues and macrophages using real time PCR (Fig. 1D). A good correspondence was observed in the mRNA levels normalized to total RNA and the transacylase activity. A comparison was also made between LPLA2 and another reported acidic phospholipase A2. This phospholipase, termed aiPLA2, was identified as the same protein as Prdx6, a non-selenium glutathione peroxidase (14Kim T.S. Dodia C. Chen X. Hennigan B.B. Jain M. Feinstein S.I. Fisher A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L750-L761PubMed Google Scholar, 15Chen J.W. Dodia C. Feinstein S.I. Jain M.K. Fisher A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28421-28427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The mRNA levels of Prdx6 were not significantly greater in the alveolar macrophage as compared with other tissues. Another macrophage-associated phospholipase A2 is the calcium-independent group VIA enzyme termed iPLA2 (16Winstead M.V. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 28-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). mRNA levels of iPLA2 were also not significantly greater in the alveolar macrophage compared with other tissues. We next sought to demonstrate that the high transacylase/ phospholipase A2 activity present in the alveolar macrophage was, in fact, LPLA2. A polyclonal antibody was raised to a peptide corresponding to the sequence 100RTSRATQFPD109 of the mouse LPLA2 protein. An immunoblot of the soluble protein fractions of rat peritoneal and alveolar macrophages was compared with that of c-Myc-tagged mouse LPLA2 expressed in COS-7 cells (Fig 2A). The immunoblot identified a major band in the alveolar macrophage protein fraction of the predicted molecular mass. No corresponding band was detected in the peritoneal macrophage fraction or when preimmune serum was used. The antibody recognized the c-Myc-tagged protein as well. The identity of the c-Myc-LPLA2 was confirmed with an anti-c-Myc antibody. Densitometric measurements of the detected bands demonstrated a ratio of 1:0.57 between the alveolar macrophage LPLA2 and the mouse LPLA2 (Fig. 2B). A comparison of reaction velocities was also made between the endogenous enzyme and the expressed LPLA2 (Fig. 2C). The ratio of the reaction velocities was 1:0.58. These data suggest that the transacylase/phospholipase A2 activity measured in the alveolar macrophage was due to LPLA2. The transacylase and phospholipase A2 activities in the alveolar macrophage were further evaluated for their calcium dependence and pH optima (Fig. 3A). No phospholipase A2 or transacylase activities were observed at pH 7.4 in the presence or absence of calcium. The absence of activity persisted even when the reaction was followed for up to 60 min. At pH 4.5 the formation of both 1-O-acyl-N-acetylsphingosine and free fatty acid was observed. The majority of pulmonary surfactant phospholipid is in the form of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine. Thus, it should be demonstrable that this disaturated lipid is a suitable substrate for LPLA2. Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine has a phase transition temperature of 41 °C. Therefore, liposomes containing dioleoylphosphatidylcholine, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, and dicetyl phosphate were used (Fig. 3B). Under these conditions and in the absence of N-acetylsphingosine as an acceptor, the release of both palmitic acid and oleic acid was observed (Fig. 3C). To ascertain the relative contributions of phospholipase A1 and A2 activities in the degradation of the disaturated phosphatidylcholine, a liposomal mixture containing sn-2-labeled phosphatidylcholine was incubated with a soluble fraction obtained from the alveolar macrophages (Fig. 3D). In the absence of the soluble fraction, the spontaneous but significant release of radiolabeled palmitic acid and lysophosphatidylcholine occurred in a time-dependent manner (42 cpm/min and 26 cpm/min for palmitic acid and lysophosphatidylcholine, respectively). In the presence of the alveolar macrophage fraction, significant amounts of radioactive palmitic acid and lysophosphatidylcholine were produced. Because the dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine was labeled at the C2 position, the radiolabeled lysophosphatidylcholine detected represented sn-2-lysophosphatidylcholine, the product of phospholipase A1 activity. Under these conditions, the rate of formation of sn-2-lysophosphatidylcholine was two times that of palmitic acid formation. Therefore, 33 and 66% of the palmitic acid released from dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine in this assay system is due to the respective activities of phospholipase A2 and phospholipase A1. In our original characterization of LPLA2 we noted that the enzyme was insensitive to the phospholipase A2 inhibitors bromoenol lactone and nonadecyltetraenyl trifluoromethyl ketone. However, MJ33, an inhibitor demonstrated to block surfactant phosphatidylcholine catabolism in vivo, was not evaluated. The LPLA2 activity was measured in the presence of this compound. A concentration-dependent inhibition of the transacylase activity was observed (Fig. 4). A comparable response was noted for the expressed c-Myc-tagged mouse LPLA2. Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is a disorder of the impaired catabolism of surfactant phospholipids and proteins. The GM-CSF null mouse was discovered to exhibit a phenotype consistent with this human disease. These mice display excess surfactant accumulation in the lungs associated with the engorgement of lipids within alveolar macrophages (10Dranoff G. Crawford A.D. Sadelain M. Ream B. Rashid A. Bronson R.T. Dickersin G.R. Bachurski C.J. Mark E.L. Whitsett J.A. Mulligan R.C. Science. 1994; 264: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). This phenotype is reversed in bi-transgenic mice that are GM-CSF null but express GM-CSF under the control of the SP-C promoter (11Huffman J.A. Hull W.M. Dranoff G. Mulligan R.C. Whitsett J.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 97: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). LPLA2 activity was measured in the alveolar macrophages of C57BL/6 mice, GM-CSF null mice, and bitransgenic mice that express GM-CSF under the control of the surfactant protein C promoter (Fig. 5A). LPLA2 activity, as measured by the time-dependent increase in 1-O-acyl-N-acetylsphingosine, was readily apparent in the wild-type mouse macrophages. However, this activity was six times lower in macrophages from the null mice. The GM-CSF bi-transgenic mouse macrophages demonstrated somewhat higher LPLA2 activity. Interestingly, cholesterol levels were very high in the GM-CSF–/– mouse macrophages but not detected in the wild-type of transgenic mice. An immunoblot of the proteins obtained from the isolated alveolar macrophages of the respective mice displayed parallel changes (Fig. 5B). No LPLA2 protein was detected in the GM-CSF–/– mice in our assay system. LPLA2 levels in the bi-transgenic macrophages were slightly higher than in the wild-type mice. We next attempted to determine whether GM-CSF alone was sufficient to result in LPLA2 expression in the alveolar macrophages from the null mice. GM-CSF–/– alveolar macrophages were isolated and cultured for up to 5 days in the presence or absence of GM-CSF (10 ng/ml). No change in LPLA2 activity was observed in the treated macrophages even when the reaction was followed for 60 min (Fig. 6). There are three significant findings in the present study. First, LPLA2, an acidic phospholipase of unknown function, is highly expressed in alveolar macrophages. Although LPLA2 expression and activity is ubiquitously found in all tissues assayed, the mRNA levels and enzyme activity are robustly present in the pulmonary alveolar macrophage. The LPLA2 activity in peripheral blood monocytes and peritoneal macrophages is comparably low. These data are consistent with the interpretation that LPLA2 is a marker of the differentiated alveolar macrophage. Second, LPLA2 recognizes disaturated phosphatidylcholines as substrates. Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine is the major component of the pulmonary surfactant. Phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine account for 84.1 and 1.9%, respectively, of the surfactant lipid in the C57BL/6 mouse (17Post M. van Golde L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 947: 249-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, LPLA2 may potentially serve as the primary catabolic enzyme of surfactant phospholipids. Third, LPLA2 activity is very low in alveolar macrophages from GM-CSF–/– mice. These mice have been characterized as a model of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, a disorder of impaired surfactant catabolism. The activity is restored in GM-CSF–/– mice in which GM-CSF is expressed in type II alveolar epithelial cells under the control of the SP-C promoter. Thus LPLA2 may be a link between GM-CSF deficiency and impaired surfactant lipid degradation. The enzyme or enzymes responsible for the catabolism of surfactant phospholipids have been the object of prior studies. These reports have suggested that degradation of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine occurs either through the activity of an undefined calcium-independent phospholipase A1 or through the activity of a calcium-independent phospholipase A2 that has optimal activity at an acidic pH (18Quintero O.A. Wright J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L399-L407Google Scholar). Our data indicate that both activities are present in the alveolar macrophage. The existence of an acidic phospholipase A2 activity was first described over 25 years ago (19Heath M.F. Jacobson W. Pediatr. Res. 1980; 14: 846-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 20Heath M.F. Jacobson W. Pediatr. Res. 1980; 14: 254-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Such an activity was subsequently described in rabbit lung and in rat and human alveolar macrophages. Fisher and colleagues identified such an activity in lung secretory lamellar bodies and in lysosomes (21Wang R. Dodia C.R. Jain M.K. Fisher A.B. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). They further reported that this activity was inhibited by the phospholipid transition state analogue MJ33 (6Fisher A.B. Dodia C. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: L748-L754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In support of this observation, they demonstrated that MJ33 inhibited DPPC degradation by 50% in isolated perfused rat lungs. Using MJ33 they isolated a protein with a molecular mass of 15 kDa (21Wang R. Dodia C.R. Jain M.K. Fisher A.B. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and, subsequently, at 26 kDa (14Kim T.S. Dodia C. Chen X. Hennigan B.B. Jain M. Feinstein S.I. Fisher A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L750-L761PubMed Google Scholar) as the putative lysosomal phospholipase A2. There are several reasons why aiPLA2 is unlikely to be the enzyme accounting for acidic phospholipase A2 activity that catalyzes the degradation of surfactant phospholipids. First, aiPLA2 has low specific activity, it is a cytosolic enzyme, and it lacks the mannose groups typically seen in lysosomally targeted proteins. The tissue distribution of aiPLA2 does not favor the lung, monocytes, or macrophages. For aiPLA2 to function as a phospholipase it would have to be a dual function enzyme with two separate catalytic domains, one for the lipase and one for glutathione peroxidase. Finally, gene targeting of aiPLA2 does not result in a pulmonary phenotype consistent with aberrant surfactant metabolism (22Wang X. Phelan S.A. Forsman-Semb K. Taylor E.F. Petros C. Brown A. Lerner C.P. Paigen B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25179-25190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 23Mo Y. Feinstein S.I. Manevich Y. Zhang Q. Lu L. Ho Y.S. Fisher A.B. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 192-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The acidic lysosomal transacylase is a novel type of phospholipase A2 that is structurally homologous to LCAT (3Hiraoka M. Abe A. Shayman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10090-10099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The chromosomal location of the lysosomal phospholipase A2 gene on 16q22 close to LCAT suggests that the lipase arose as a gene duplication product of LCAT. Because the lysosomal phospholipase A2 lacks activity toward cholesterol as an acceptor for the sn-2 fatty acids of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, the functional significance of this enzyme was not immediately apparent at the time it was first identified. The markedly increased expression and activity of the phospholipase A2 observed in alveolar macrophages suggest that the primary function of this enzyme is likely to be the degradation of glycerophospholipids present in a pulmonary surfactant. Apart from the absence of LPLA2 activity in GM-CSF–/– mice, two additional observations support this view. First, the specific activity of the phospholipase A2 is considerably higher than that reported for other candidate enzymes. These include Prdx6/aiPLA2 and the calcium-independent neutral macrophage associate PLA2. Second, the enzyme is inhibited by MJ33, an inhibitor previously demonstrated to block the majority of dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine degradation in murine lung. Finally, deletion of the gene for GM-CSF or its receptor in mice results in the pathological accumulation of surfactant in the lungs. This accumulation is not a consequence of increased production of surfactant components but appears to be linked to impaired surfactant catabolism by alveolar macrophages (24Ikegami M. Ueda T. Hull W. Whitsett J.A. Mulligan R.C. Dranoff G. Jobe A.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: L650-L658Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our observation that LPLA2 activity is expressed at a high level in alveolar macrophages from wild-type mice, but at a very low level in alveolar macrophages from GM-CSF null mice with impaired surfactant clearance, further supports the hypothesis that LPLA2 plays a critical role in surfactant phospholipid catabolism. Short term treatment of GM-CSF null alveolar macrophages in vitro with GM-CSF was not sufficient to induce LPLA2 expression, although transgenic expression of GM-CSF exclusively in the lungs of GM-CSF null mice did result in a high level of alveolar macrophage expression of LPLA2. This finding is not surprising insofar as long-term pharmacologic treatment with nebulized GM-CSF or gene transfer has been required to reverse the pathologic finding of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis in GM-CSF-deficient mice. Clearly, GM-CSF is necessary but not sufficient to induce alveolar macrophage differentiation. An additional unexplained finding was the presence of high cholesterol levels in the alveolar macrophages of the GM-CSF null mice. This observation does not appear to have been reported previously in the phenotypic characterization of these mice. Although the mechanism for this accumulation is not apparent, an association between GM-CSF and cholesterol metabolism has been reported previously (25Ishibashi T. Yokoyama K. Shindo J. Hamazaki Y. Endo Y. Sato T. Takahashi S. Kawarabayasi Y. Shiomi M. Yamamoto T. Maruyama Y. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 748: 630-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This observation is also consistent with a recently reported study in which our group evaluated the role of agonists that induce macrophage differentiation on LPLA2 expression in THP-1 cells (26Abe A.

In this study we observed that phorbol ester and all-trans retinoic acid induced LPLA2 transcription, but that GM-CSF was without effect. Sorting out those signals that regulate both alveolar macrophage differentiation and LPLA2 expression will require additional work. Thus, we have demonstrated the robust expression of an acidic lysosomal phospholipase A2 within the alveolar macrophage, the primary site of surfactant degradation. The low expression and activity of this phospholipase A2 in a model of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis raises the possibility that this phospholipase may mediate human disorders associated with abnormal surfactant metabolism. We are grateful for the assistance of Claudio Canetti and Marc Peters-Golden for instruction in the isolation of pulmonary alveolar cells and for helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W1993062573,"Temperature-sensitive mutant 2-20/32 of Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2155 was isolated and genetically complemented with a Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv DNA fragment that contained a single open reading frame. This open reading frame is designated Rv3265c in the M. tuberculosis H37Rv genome. Rv3265c shows homology to the Escherichia coli gene wbbL, which encodes a dTDP-Rha:α-d-GlcNAc-pyrophosphate polyprenol, α-3-l-rhamnosyltransferase. In E. coli this enzyme is involved in O-antigen synthesis, but in mycobacteria it is required for the rhamnosyl-containing linker unit responsible for the attachment of the cell wall polymer mycolyl-arabinogalactan to the peptidoglycan. The M. tuberculosis wbbL homologue, encoded by Rv3265c, was shown to be capable of restoring an E. coli K12 strain containing an insertionally inactivated wbbL to O-antigen positive. Likewise, the E. coli wbbL gene allowed 2-20/32 to grow at higher non-permissive temperatures. The rhamnosyltransferase activity of M. tuberculosis WbbL was demonstrated in 2-20/32 as was the loss of this transferase activity in 2-20/32 at elevated temperatures. The wbbL of the temperature-sensitive mutant contained a single-base change that converted what was a proline in mc2155 to a serine residue. Exposure of 2-20/32 to higher non-permissive temperatures resulted in bacteria that could not be recovered at the lower permissive temperatures.

The acid-fastness of all mycobacteria is based upon a shared universal cell wall core structure. The mycobacterial cell wall consists of an outer lipid layer and an inner peptidoglycan layer. The outer layer is highly impermeable and is composed of unique 70–90 carbon-containing lipids, known as mycolic acids. The mycolic acids are esterified to the non-reducing terminal arabinosyl residues of the polysaccharide arabinogalactan (1McNeil M. Besra G.S. Brennan P.J. Rom W.N. Garay S.M. Tuberculosis.

The reducing end of arabinogalactan is connected to the peptidoglycan via the disaccharide linker, α-l-Rha-(1→3)α-d-GlcNAc-(1→phosphate). Structural analyses showed that the integrity of the whole two-layer mycolic acid peptidoglycan assembly hinges on the presence of the rhamnosyl moiety as depicted in Fig. 1A. The complete structure of the linker is illustrated in Fig. 1B, and the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme, dTDP-Rha:α-d-GlcNAc-pyrophosphate polyprenol, α-3-l-rhamnosyltransferase (referred to as rhamnosyltransferase in this study) is shown in Fig. 1C. The rhamnosyl residue and much if not all of the arabinogalactan polysaccharide are synthesized on GlcNAc-P-P-decaprenyl carrier lipid (6Mikusova K. Mikus M. Besra G. Hancock I. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7820-7828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The eventual transfer of the arabinogalactan-Rha-GlcNAc-phosphate unit to the O-6 of a muramic acid places the polysaccharide in mass onto the peptidoglycan. Finally, at some still to be defined point, the mycolic acids are attached to arabinofuranosyl residues at the non-reducing end of arabinogalactan. To further define and characterize the essential steps involved in the synthesis of the mycobacterial cell wall core, the classic microbial approach of isolating conditional lethal mutants was undertaken. Our strategy was to isolate temperature-sensitive (TS) 1The abbreviations used are: TS, temperature-sensitive; ORF, open reading frame; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; Rha, rhamnose. mutants in the genetically amenable and relatively fast growing Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2155 (7Snapper S.B. Melton R.E. Mustafa S. Kieser T. Jacobs W.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1911-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). A preferred large temperature range that would support growth precluded Mycobacterium tuberculosis from serving as the host for the generation of TS mutants. TS mutants would be genetically complemented with M. tuberculosis genomic DNA in hopes of identifying essential genes encoding cell wall biosynthetic enzymes. Herein, we describe the isolation of a TS cell wall mutant and the independent genetic complementation of that mutant with a M. tuberculosis gene and an E. coli gene. We report biochemical characterization of the TS mutant, the deduced amino acid change due to the mutation, the genetic complementation of an E. coli mutant to confirm the function of a M. tuberculosis gene, and the effect of the mutation on mycobacterial viability after exposure to non-permissive temperatures. Isolation of TS Mutants—The strategy for the isolation and enrichment of bacterial TS mutants in a culture as outlined by A. Morris Hooke (8Hooke A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 448-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) was adapted for use in this study. M. smegmatis mc2155 (7Snapper S.B. Melton R.E. Mustafa S. Kieser T. Jacobs W.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1911-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar) was inoculated into Middlebrook 7H9 with ADC supplement (Difco) (7H9) and grown at 37 °C to ∼108 colony-forming units/ml. Nitrosoguanidine (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml, and cultures were incubated at 37 °C without aeration for 40 min. The cells were recovered by centrifugation and washed three times in fresh 7H9 medium to remove the mutagen. Samples of cells were suspended in at least 20 volumes of fresh 7H9 broth distributed into several separate flasks to help minimize the isolation of siblings and incubated with shaking at the permissive temperature of 30 °C. When cell density reached ∼5 × 107 colony-forming units/ml cultures were transferred to a shaking water bath at the non-permissive temperature of 42 °C for 1 h. To enrich the population of TS mutants in the cultures d-cycloserine (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 0.4 mg/ml. Cells were incubated at 42 °C for another 6 h, recovered by centrifugation, and washed 3 times in fresh medium to remove the antibiotic. Surviving cells were cultured in fresh broth at 30 °C until density again reached ∼5 × 107 colony-forming units/ml. The cultures were subjected to another cycle of enrichment at the non-permissive temperature as described, except the d-cycloserine was replaced with ampillicin (Sigma) at a final concentration of 2.3 mg/ml. Ampillicin was used in the second cycle to avoid enriching for d-cycloserine-resistant mutants. The treatment with either d-cycloserine or ampillicin resulted in a 99–99.9% reduction in colony-forming units. After the second enrichment the surviving cells were washed free of the antibiotic, diluted, plated on Luria Bertani agar supplement with 1% Tween 80 (Sigma), and incubated at 30 °C. M. smegmatis mc2155 grown in the presence of Tween 80 produce mucoid colonies on Luria-Bertani agar, which make them readily transferable to other plates. Colonies that arose after incubation were replica-plated onto Luria Bertani agar supplement with 1% Tween 80 and incubated at 30 °C and 42 °C to identify TS mutants. Genetic Complementation of TS Mutant Strain 2-20/32—M. tuberculosis H37Rv genomic DNA was isolated and partially digested with Sau3A (9Pascopella L. Collins F.M. Martin J.M. Lee M.H. Hatfull G.F.

Gel-purified DNA fragments of about 30 kilobases were ligated into BamHI-digested pCB7 (Table I), packaged into λ particles using Gigapack III XL packing extract (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and propagated in E. coli (XL1-Blue MR, Stratagene) on LB containing 200 μg/ml hygromycin B (Sigma). Although plasmids recovered contained significantly smaller M. tuberculosis DNA fragments than the desired 30-kilobase inserts, they were still used to attempt to complement some of the TS mutants. These smaller plasmids were probably the result of the instability of the larger constructs in the transduced E. coli host. The plasmid library was introduced into the TS mutants by electroporation (8Hooke A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 448-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on Luria Bertani agar supplement with 1% Tween 80 with 50 μg/ml hygromycin B (Sigma) at 42 °C. Fortuitously, one of the plasmids from this library, pCB120, allowed TS mutant 2-20/32 to grow at the non-permissive temperature of 42 °C. Plasmid pCB120 was sequenced and shown to contain a 1764-bp M. tuberculosis H37Rv DNA insert. A BLAST search showed that this DNA contained the entire open reading frame (ORF) of Rv3265c (10Cole S.T.

The former primer included a SacI site and a stop codon designed to be in-frame with the β-galactosidase followed by the wbbL GTG start. The latter primer included a KpnI site. The PCR products were digested with appropriate enzymes and ligated into SacI/KpnI-digested pBluescript (Stratagene) to generate pCB220.

Preparation of dTDP-[14C]Rha—dTDP-[14C]Rha was prepared from [U14C]sucrose by conversion of the glucose moiety of the sucrose to glucose 1-phosphate by sucrose phosphorylase followed by further conversion to dTDP-[14C]Glc by α-d-glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase (RmlA) and further conversion by RmlB-D to dTDP-[14C]Rha. The α-d-glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase was prepared from M. tuberculosis rmlA (16Ma Y. Mills J.A. Belisle J.T. Vissa V. Howell M. Bowlin K. Scherman M.S. McNeil M.

After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C an additional source of RmlB-D (200 μl of crude E. coli B lysate (∼5 ml/ml protein)) and additional NADPH (35 μl of 10 mm) was added to fully convert the dTDP-[14C]Glc to dTDP-[14C]Rha. Then 700 μl of absolute ethanol was added, and the precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min. The bulk of the ethanol was removed by evaporation, and the dTDP-[14C]Rha was purified by high performance liquid chromatography as described (17Stern R.J. Lee T.Y. Lee T.J. Yan W. Scherman M.S.

The acceptor for the rhamnosyl residue, GlcNAc-P-P-decaprenol, is formed in situ from exogenously added UDP-GlcNAc and from undecaprenyl phosphate present in the membrane preparations by GlcNAc-1-phosphate transferase also present in the membrane preparations. Thus, bacteria, as indicated in Table II were disrupted by sonication, and cell debris were removed by centrifugation 8,000 × g. The membrane pellets were then prepared by additional centrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 × g and resuspended in 50 mm, pH 8, MOPS containing 5 mm mercaptoethanol and 10 mm MgCl2 at protein concentrations in all cases of ∼13 mg/ml. To 150 μl of these membrane preparations were added 0.1 μCi of dTDP-[14C]Rha (221 μCi/μmol), 6 nmol of UDP-GlcNAc, 18 nmol of ATP, and additional MOPS buffer to total 320 μl. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, 200 μl of water, 400 μl of methanol, and 800 μl of chloroform were added, and the organic layer removed and counted.Table IIRhamnosyltransferase activity in membranes prepared from various E. coli strains containing different plasmidsE. coli strain (plasmid)Incubation timeTotal cpm in organic phaseaSubstrate dTDP-[14C]Rha was converted from aqueous to organic counts by the presumed attachment of the [14C]rhamnosyl residue to in situ GlcNAc-P-P-decaprenol.

Cell-free extract preparation, membrane isolation, and incubation with dTDP-Rha (non-radioactive) and UDP-[14C]GlcNAc, extraction with organic solvent, TLC chromatography, and visualization by autoradiography were as described (6Mikusova K. Mikus M. Besra G. Hancock I. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7820-7828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Viability of 2-20/32 after Treatment at the Non-permissive Temperature—Two cultures of M. smegmatis 2-20/32 and a single culture M. smegmatis 2-20/32 complemented with pCB120 were grown in LB broth at 30 °C, and the turbidity was followed at A600. At a culture A600 of ∼0.2, one of the 2-20/32 (non-transformed) and the 2-20/32 (pCB120) was shifted to 42 °C; the remaining 2-20/32 was kept at 30 °C. The monitoring at A600 was continued (see Fig. 4). After 24 h at 42 °C an inoculum of 2-20/32 and 2-20/32 (pCB120) was transferred into fresh LB broth and incubated at 30 °C, and the A600 was monitored. Isolation and Complementation of TS Mutant 2-20/32— Forty-seven M. smegmatis mc2155 TS mutants were isolated in 15 independent mutagenic experiments as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The mutagenesis and enrichment procedure yielded an average frequency of 1 TS mutant per 420 colonies screened. One TS mutant 2-20/32 was genetically complemented by pCB120, i.e. the plasmid allowed the mutant to grow at the non-permissive temperature of 42 °C. Plasmid pCB120 contained a 1764-bp M. tuberculosis H37Rv genomic DNA fragment. Sequence analysis revealed that pCB120 contained only one intact ORF. This ORF was translated and subjected to a BLAST (18Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar) search that revealed it corresponded to M. tuberculosis Rv3265c and showed significant homology to the protein product of the wbbL gene of E. coli K12 (accession L19537; see also Ref. 12Reeves P.R. Hobbs M. Valvano M.A. Skurnik M. Whitfield C. Coplin D. Kido N. Klena J. Maskell D. Raetz C.R. Rick P.D. Trends. Microbiol. 1996; 4: 495-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). This fragment DNA was known as ORF 264 in the original report (19Liu D. Reeves P.R. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). It was, therefore, postulated that the ORF in pCB120 was, in fact, the M. tuberculosis version of wbbL encoding the rhamnosyltransferase responsible for the synthesis of the α-l-Rha-(1→3)-α-d-GlcNAc linker unit (Fig. 1C). Complementation of E. coli K12 EMG2 with M. tuberculosis DNA Coding for Putative Rhamnosyltransferase—The work of Reeves and co-workers (11Stevenson G. Neal B. Liu D. Hobbs M. Packer N.H. Batley M.

Microbiology. 1994; 140: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) allowed us to readily conduct complementation experiments that could determine whether the ORF in pCB120 was a rhamnosyltransferase. The ORF in pCB120 was amplified by PCR and inserted in pBluescript to form pCB220 (Table I). In an analogous fashion the E. coli wbbL was amplified by PCR from E. coli WG1 (19Liu D. Reeves P.R. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and cloned in pBluescript to form pKM1 (Table I). Plasmids pCB220 and pKM1 were introduced into E. coli EMG2. EMG2 contains an insertionally inactivated wbbL (11Stevenson G. Neal B. Liu D. Hobbs M. Packer N.H. Batley M. Redmond J.W. Lindquist L. Reeves P.R. J.

Microbiology. 1994; 140: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and, thus, is unable to produce O-antigen. LPS profiles by non-transformed EMG2, EMG2 (pCB220), and EMG2 (pKM1) were examined by SDS-PAGE. Visualization by silver staining (Fig. 2B) showed as expected that LPS complete with O-antigen was produced by EMG2 containing the plasmid encoding the E. coli rhamnosyltransferase (19Liu D. Reeves P.R. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), whereas EMG2 without plasmid or pBluescript was devoid of O-antigen. Remarkably, a plasmid encoding the putative rhamnosyltransferase gene from M. tuberculosis also resulted in O-antigen synthesis. Relative to the E. coli wbbL, the number of O-antigen units added to the LPS appeared to be diminished with the M. tuberculosis wbbL. Blot analysis (Fig. 2C) showed that the O-antigen produced from both plasmids reacted with antibody raised against E. coli O-16 O-antigen, but no reaction occurred without plasmid or pBluescript. Known cross-reactivity of antiserum raised against E. coli O-16 O-antigen with E. coli K12 O-antigen (11Stevenson G. Neal B. Liu D. Hobbs M. Packer N.H. Batley M. Redmond J.W. Lindquist L.

https://openalex.org/W2139845246,"Receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase α (RPTPα) belongs to the subfamily of receptor-like protein-tyrosine phosphatases that are characterized by two catalytic domains of which only the membrane-proximal one (D1) exhibits appreciable catalytic activity.

They are characterized by one or two catalytic domains containing a signature sequence (I/V)HCXAGXXR(S/T/G) including a catalytic cysteine (for review, see Refs. 1Andersen J.N. Mortensen O.H.

This cysteine forms a thiol-phosphate intermediate in the dephosphorylation reaction and is therefore essential for enzyme activity (3Barford D. Jia Z. Tonks N.K. Nat. Struct.

Groen A. Van der Wijk T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species induce oxidation of catalytic cysteines, thereby inactivating these PTPs (5Lee S.R. Kwon K.S.

Inhibition of enzyme activity by oxidative stress is increasingly recognized as an important mechanism of regulation of the PTP family. Therefore, PTPs may serve as sensors of the cellular redox state. RPTPα belongs to the receptor-like PTPs that are characterized by a single transmembrane domain. RPTPα has two catalytic domains of which the N-terminal one (D1) contains almost all of the catalytic activity of the enzyme. RPTPα was found to constitutively form dimers in the cell membrane (13Jiang G. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5917-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 14Tertoolen L.G. Blanchetot C. Jiang G. Overvoorde J. Gadella Jr., T.W. Hunter T. den Hertog J. BMC Cell Biol. 2001; (http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/2/8)PubMed Google Scholar), and activity of the dimer is dependent on the relative orientation of the two monomers in the dimer (15Jiang G. den Hertog J. Su J. Noel J. Sap J. Hunter T. Nature. 1999; 401: 606-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Studies on the crystal structure of RPTPα-D1 indicate that a helix-loophelix wedge-like structure to the N-terminal side of D1 occludes the catalytic site of the dyad-related monomer (16Bilwes A.M. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The RPTP CD45 is also regulated by dimerization (17Desai D.M. Sap J. Schlessinger J. Weiss A. Cell. 1993; 73: 541-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 18Xu Z. Weiss A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 764-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Mutations in the wedge-like structure of CD45 and RPTPα abolished dimerization-induced inactivation (15Jiang G. den Hertog J. Su J. Noel J. Sap J. Hunter T. Nature. 1999; 401: 606-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 19Majeti R. Bilwes A.M. Noel J.P. Hunter T. Weiss A. Science. 1998; 279: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) proving that the wedge-like structure is essential for the regulation of RPTP activity by rotational coupling of the monomers in the dimer. Previously, we showed that the catalytically inactive C-terminal PTP domain (D2) of RPTPs has a regulatory role (20Blanchetot C. den Hertog J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12446-12452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 21Blanchetot C. Tertoolen L.G. Overvoorde J. den Hertog J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47263-47269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Recent studies on oxidative stress and RPTPα indicate that D2 acts as a redox sensor (22Blanchetot C. Tertoolen L.G. den Hertog J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Using an antibody that recognizes oxidized classical PTPs, RPTPα-D2 exhibits a higher susceptibility to oxidation than RPTPα-D1 (12Persson C. Sjöblom T. Groen A. Kappert K. Engström U. Hellman U. Heldin C.H. den Hertog J. Östman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1886-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Furthermore, H2O2 treatment induces a rapid, reversible, and catalytic site Cys-723-dependent in vivo change in protein conformation, rendering a more stable, catalytically inactive RPTPα dimer (22Blanchetot C. Tertoolen L.G. den Hertog J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Low molecular weight PTP (LMW-PTP), CDC25, and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), non-classical members of the PTP family, form intramolecular disulfide bonds between the catalytic cysteine and an adjacent cysteine upon oxidation, which protects the catalytic cysteine against irreversible further oxidation (7Caselli A.

Using RPTPα, we investigated whether disulfide bond formation is involved in oxidative stress-induced conformational changes in classical PTPs. Here we report fast and reversible in vivo intermolecular disulfide bond formation upon H2O2 treatment. By alternatively mutating all cysteines in RPTPα to serines, we localized the intermolecular disulfide bond between the cysteines at position 723 of the two monomers in the dimer. Studies with a chimeric protein encoding the RPTPα ectodomain fused to the LAR transmembrane and intracellular domains indicate that intermolecular disulfide bond formation and a subsequent change in dimer conformation are not restricted to RPTPα but are a general theme for RPTPs with two intracellular PTP domains. Oxidation-induced stable dimer formation persisted longer than the disulfide bonds, and reduction of the disulfide bonds did not disrupt stable dimer formation, which is consistent with a model in which reversible oxidation initiates, but does not maintain, stable dimer formation. Constructs—SV40-driven expression vectors have been described previously for full-length HA-RPTPα (24den Hertog J. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3016-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), Myc-RPTPα (22Blanchetot C. Tertoolen L.G. den Hertog J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), HARPTPα-C433S, HA-RPTPα-C723S, and HA-RPTPα-C433S/C723S (25Buist A. Blanchetot C. den Hertog J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Individual Cys → Ser mutants were generated by PCR using appropriate oligonucleotides and were verified by sequencing. Expression vectors for the individual RPTPα-D1 and RPTPα-D2 domains were described previously (20Blanchetot C. den Hertog J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12446-12452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 22Blanchetot C. Tertoolen L.G. den Hertog J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The fusion protein encoding the RPTPα ectodomain, human LAR transmembrane, and intracellular domain fusion protein (EDα-LAR) was generated by PCR. The ectodomain of HA-tagged RPTPα (residues 1–141) was amplified by PCR, and a KpnI site was added to the 5′-side. The transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of human LAR (residues 1235–stop) were amplified by PCR with a KpnI site engineered on the 3′-end. These two PCR products were cloned into the SV40 promoter-driven expression vector pSG5, and the entire construct was verified by sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-1 cells were routinely grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 supplemented with 7.5% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfection of COS-1 cells was done by calcium phosphate precipitation as described previously (24den Hertog J. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3016-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The medium was refreshed the day after transfection using medium without serum, and experiments were performed after another 16 h. Before cell lysis, cells were stimulated with H2O2 (Sigma) and/or pervanadate as indicated in medium without serum. Stable Dimer Detection by Co-immunoprecipitation and Non-reducing SDS-PAGE—After stimulation, cells transfected with both Myc-tagged RPTPα and HA-tagged RPTPα constructs were lysed in cell lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, aprotinin, and leupeptin) in the presence of 20 mm iodoacetamide when indicated and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min. To check for protein expression and to study homodimer formation by intermolecular disulfide bond formation, samples from the supernatant were diluted 1:1 in 2× Laemmli sample buffer with β-mercaptoethanol (reducing conditions) or without (non-reducing conditions) as indicated. Subsequently, the samples were boiled for 5 min and loaded onto 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The rest of the supernatant was rotated for 2 h at 4 °C with anti-HA antibody linked to protein A-Sepharose beads. The beads were spun down and washed four times with HNTG (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol). The samples were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer and separated on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The material on the gel was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by semidry blotting. The membranes were stained with Coomassie Blue, blocked for 1 h at room temperature in TBST (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% milk, and incubated for another h with anti-HA, anti-Myc, or anti-RPTPα antibody 5478 (26den Hertog J. Tracy S. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3020-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) in TBST + 5% milk. The blots were washed three times with TBST and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. After washing with TBST the immunoreactivity on the membranes was visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) according to standard protocols. HA Accessibility Assay—The conformation of the extracellular domain was detected by the accessibility of the HA tag at the N-terminal side of the extracellular domain of HA-α and of the EDα-LAR chimeric protein. The procedure has been described previously in detail (27Van der Wijk T. Blanchetot C. Overvoorde J. den Hertog J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13968-13974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In short, after stimulation, the living cells were incubated ice-cold with anti-HA antibody for 1 h. After extensive washing, cells were lysed, and the antibody-bound fraction of the protein was pulled down from the lysate with protein A-Sepharose. This part of the total amount of transfected protein is called the accessible fraction. The rest of the HA-tagged protein, the non-accessible fraction, was immunoprecipitated from the remaining lysate using protein A-Sepharose-bound anti-HA antibody. The immunoprecipitating proteins were visualized following SDS-PAGE by immunoblotting as described above. Rapid Formation of Intermolecular Disulfide Bonds between RPTPα Monomers in Response to H2O2—Previously, we showed that H2O2 treatment of cells transfected with differentially tagged RPTPα constructs leads to the formation of stable RPTPα dimers as detected by co-immunoprecipitation of the two constructs (22Blanchetot C. Tertoolen L.G. den Hertog J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To study whether dimer stabilization coincides with the formation of intermolecular disulfide bond(s), we co-transfected COS-1 cells with both HA- and Myc-tagged RPTPα. Cells were stimulated with different concentrations of H2O2 for 5 min (Fig. 1A). The cells were lysed, and samples were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing and non-reducing conditions. HA-RPTPα was immunoprecipitated from the remaining lysates, and co-immunoprecipitation of Myc-tagged RPTPα was detected. H2O2 treatment induced RPTPα in a dose-dependent manner to migrate at a position that corresponds to the double molecular weight of an RPTPα monomer on SDS-polyacrylamide gels under non-reducing conditions (Fig. 1A, upper panel). The RPTPα bands that appeared on SDS-polyacrylamide gels under non-reducing conditions after H2O2 stimulation were absent under reducing conditions (data not shown, cf. Fig. 5B). As shown in the middle panel of Fig. 1A, the increasing amount of RPTPα dimers under non-reducing SDS-PAGE conditions coincided with the co-immunoprecipitation of Myc-tagged RPTPα with HA-RPTPα.Fig. 5H2O2-induced rotational coupling and intermolecular disulfide bond formation in RPTPα-LAR chimera. Cells transfected with either HA-RPTPα (α-WT) or a chimera of the extracellular domain of HA-RPTPα with the transmembrane and intracellular domain of LAR (EDα-LAR) were stimulated for 5 min with 1 mm H2O2 as indicated. Subsequently, in A, cells were lysed, and the accessible fraction (top) and non-accessible fraction (bottom) of α-WT and EDα-LAR were isolated as described under “Materials and Methods.” In B, cells were lysed in the presence of iodoacetamide and loaded on non-reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gels (without β-mercaptoethanol) to investigate intermolecular disulfide bond formation. Immunoblots probed with anti-HA antibody and developed by ECL are depicted. WCL, whole cell lysate; Ab, antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Fig. 1B shows that dimer formation detected by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions and dimer formation detected by co-immunoprecipitation of differentially tagged RPTPα constructs coincided in time. Dimers were already prominently and maximally formed after 1 min of H2O2 treatment and declined slightly after ∼5 min. These results show that intermolecular disulfide bonds are formed between RPTPα monomers with similar kinetics as stable co-immunoprecipitating RPTPα dimers. Intermolecular Disulfide Bonds between Catalytic Cysteines of RPTPα—To map the cysteines involved in H2O2-induced intermolecular disulfide bond formation, we mutated all cysteines individually in the HA-tagged RPTPα construct to serines. Cells transfected with Myc-tagged wild-type RPTPα together with wild-type HA-tagged RPTPα or one of the HA-tagged RPTPα cysteine to serine mutants were stimulated with H2O2 or left untreated. Cells were lysed, and samples were taken to run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels for detection of expression levels and intermolecular disulfide bond formation (non-reducing conditions). HA-tagged RPTPα was precipitated from the rest of the lysates, and co-immunoprecipitation of Myc-tagged RPTPα was detected. As shown in Fig. 2A, Myc-RPTPα co-precipitated with all but one cysteine to serine mutant; only Cys-723 was found to be essential for the H2O2-induced stable dimer formation as detected by co-precipitation of differentially tagged RPTPα monomers. Although some of the other cysteine to serine mutants were poorly expressed (e.g. C339S and C421S), they still showed appreciable co-immunoprecipitation with Myc-RPTPα. Note that the RPTPα-C734S is lacking because expression was undetectable. Fig. 2B demonstrates that only the C433S and C723S mutant showed a decreased amount of intermolecular disulfide bond formation upon peroxide treatment, whereas this was unaffected in the rest of the cysteine mutants. To investigate the role of the catalytic cysteines in intermolecular disulfide bond formation and stable dimerization in more detail, we transfected cells with Myc-tagged wild-type RPTPα together with HA-tagged wild-type RPTPα, HA-tagged RPTPα-C433S, HA-tagged RPTPα-C723S, or the double mutant HA-tagged RPTPα-C433S/C723S. The C433S mutant behaved like wild type with respect to H2O2-induced co-immunoprecipitation of Myc-tagged RPTPα and intermolecular disulfide bond formation (Fig. 3). The C723S mutant did not show any co-immunoprecipitation with Myc-tagged RPTPα and did not show a band migrating at the molecular level of RPTPα dimers on non-reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gels. However, a band that migrated slower than the expected dimeric RPTPα band was still present in the C723S mutant after H2O2 treatment (Fig. 3). Interestingly, this band was strongly reduced in cells transfected with HA-RPTPα-C433S or HA-RPTPα-C433S/C723S in response to H2O2, suggesting that the catalytic cysteine of the RPTPα-D1 is involved in the formation of this slower migrating complex. Using constructs encoding the individual catalytic domains D1 and D2, respectively, we found that only D2 forms intermolecular disulfide-bonded dimers that migrate in SDS-polyacrylamide gels under non-reducing conditions with an apparent molecular weight of D2-D2 homodimers, which was completely dependent on Cys-723 (Fig. 4). D1 did not form intermolecular disulfide bonds upon treatment of cells with 1 mm H2O2 (Fig. 4). Because full-length RPTPα-C734S was not expressed in cells, we assessed involvement of Cys-734 in intermolecular disulfide bond formation in the D2 domain by itself. Importantly, D2-C734S acted in a similar fashion as wild-type D2 indicating that Cys-734 is not involved in intermolecular disulfide bond formation. These results suggest that upon H2O2 treatment, the catalytic Cys-723 forms a disulfide bond, cross-linking RPTPα-D2s. To check whether intermolecular disulfide bond formation upon oxidative stress is a general theme of RPTPs containing two PTP domains, a chimeric construct was made in which the HA-tagged extracellular domain of RPTPα was fused to the transmembrane and intracellular domain of LAR (HA-EDα-LAR). It has been shown that LAR-D2, like RPTPα-D2, shows a conformational change upon oxidative stress (21Blanchetot C. Tertoolen L.G. Overvoorde J. den Hertog J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47263-47269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Like HARPTPα (27Van der Wijk T. Blanchetot C. Overvoorde J. den Hertog J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13968-13974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), HA-EDα-LAR shows a change in rotational coupling of the dimer upon H2O2 treatment as detected by the accessibility of the HA tag on living cells transfected with HA-EDα-LAR (Fig. 5A). As shown in Fig. 5B, H2O2 induced HA-EDα-LAR to migrate at a level that corresponds to the double molecular weight of an HA-EDα-LAR dimer on SDS-polyacrylamide gels under non-reducing conditions, indicating that oxidation-induced intermolecular disulfide bond formation is a phenomenon not limited to RPTPα. Role of Intermolecular Disulfide Bonds in Stable RPTPα Dimer Formation—Because Cys-723 is required both for intermolecular disulfide bond formation and for stable dimer formation as detected by co-immunoprecipitation of differentially tagged RPTPα monomers and because both emerge with the same kinetics in response to H2O2 treatment (Fig. 1B), we investigated whether intermolecular disulfide bond formation is responsible for co-immunoprecipitation of differentially tagged RPTPα monomers. Analysis of the time course of recovery of H2O2-induced RPTPα dimer formation indicated a difference in persistence of the intermolecular disulfide bonds and RPTPα dimer stabilization. Cells transfected with wild-type RPTPα were treated for 5 min with 1 mm H2O2. The medium was replaced with medium without H2O2, and the cells were left to recover for 0–2 h. Fig. 6 shows that intermolecular disulfide bonds were less persistent than co-immunoprecipitating RPTPα dimers; although high molecular weight bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gels under non-reducing conditions disappeared after 90 min of recovery, still an appreciable amount of Myc-tagged RPTPα co-immunoprecipitated with HA-tagged RPTPα after 2 h of recovery. To investigate whether stable RPTPα dimers can indeed persist without an intermolecular disulfide bond, we treated cells with H2O2 and lysed the cells in the presence or absence of 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) (Fig. 7). We found that reduction with DTT abolished the intermolecular disulfide bonds, whereas stabilized RPTPα dimers were still detected. Pervanadate is a strong oxidizing agent that triply oxidizes the PTP catalytic cysteine into the sulfonic acid form, which cannot form disulfide bonds (28Huyer G. Lui S. Kelly J. Moffat J. Payette P. Kennedy B. Tsaprailis G. Gresser M.J. Ramachandran C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7, treatment of cells with pervanadate did not induce stable dimer formation nor intermolecular disulfide bond formation. To confirm triple oxidation upon pervanadate treatment, we used an antibody generated against triply oxidized PTP catalytic cysteine, anti-ox-PTP (12Persson C. Sjöblom T. Groen A. Kappert K. Engström U. Hellman U. Heldin C.H. den Hertog J. Östman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1886-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 8, 1 mm pervanadate indeed led to the formation of triply oxidized RPTPα, whereas no triply oxidized RPTPα is formed after 5 min of treatment with 1 mm H2O2. Interestingly, when cells are first treated with H2O2 for 5 min and subsequently with 1 mm pervanadate for 5 min, stable dimers and intermolecular disulfide bonds are formed comparable with treatment with H2O2 alone, indicating that disulfide bond formation protects against irreversible oxidation. Conversely, when cells are first stimulated with pervanadate and then with H2O2, a significantly smaller but appreciable amount of stable dimers and intermolecular disulfide bonds are formed, indicating that oxidation by pervanadate is not complete. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that reversible oxidation leading to the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds initiates stable dimer formation but is not required for the persistence of stable dimers.Fig. 8Pervanadate triply oxidized RPTPα and did not induce intermolecular disulfide bond formation. After stimulation with either 1 mm H2O2 or 1 mm pervanadate as indicated, cells were lysed in the presence of iodoacetamide. Part of the lysate was loaded on non-reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gels (without β-mercaptoethanol) to investigate intermolecular disulfide bond formation (top). HA-RPTPα was immunoprecipitated from the rest of the lysates, and blots were labeled with anti-oxPTP antibody (middle) and anti-RPTPα antibody (bottom), respectively.

Oxidation of the cysteine to sulfenic acid leads to reversible inactivation of the enzyme, while further oxidation to sulfinic and sulfonic acid irreversibly inactivates the enzyme. Recently, PTP1B was revealed to form cyclic sulfenyl-amide after oxidation by H2O2, in which the sulfur of the catalytic cysteine is covalently linked to the main chain nitrogen of the adjacent serine residue (29Salmeen A. Andersen J.N. Myers M.P. Meng T.C. Hinks J.A. Tonks N.K. Barford D. Nature. 2003; 423: 769-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar, 30van Montfort R.L. Congreve M. Tisi D. Carr R. Jhoti H. Nature. 2003; 423: 773-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Formation of this cyclic sulfenyl-amide results in a rapid elimination of oxygen from sulfenic acid and suppresses further irreversible oxidation. In this paper we show that RPTPα forms intermolecular disulfide bonds between the catalytic cysteines of the membrane-distal PTP domain upon treatment of cells with H2O2. Recently, by using a conformation-sensitive antibody method, we found that H2O2 treatment leads to a change in rotational coupling of the RPTPα dimers that is dependent on the catalytic Cys-723 of the membrane-distal PTP domain (27Van der Wijk T. Blanchetot C. Overvoorde J. den Hertog J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13968-13974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The conformation of untreated RPTPα dimers is similar to the conformation of the active constitutive dimer mutant RPTPα-F135C, whereas the H2O2-treated RPTPα dimers adopt the conformation as found with an inactive constitutive dimer mutant, RPTPα-P137C. The H2O2-induced intermolecular disulfide bond formation, like stabilized dimer formation and rotational coupling of RPTPα dimers, depends on the catalytic cysteine of the membrane-distal PTP domain. Furthermore, intermolecular disulfide bonds and stable dimers are formed with similar kinetics upon treatment of cells with H2O2. These results suggest that intermolecular disulfide bond formation between the Cys-723s of the RPTPα monomers in the dimer induces rotational coupling and stable dimer formation. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that oxidation to cyclic sulfenyl-amide, without disulfide bond formation, by itself can induce rotational coupling and thereby stable dimer formation. Previously, H2O2-induced conformational changes of RPTPα-D2 were studied using the fluorescence resonance energy transfer technique (FRET; Ref. 22Blanchetot C. Tertoolen L.G. den Hertog J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A decrease in FRET was found upon H2O2 treatment of lysates containing the cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)-RPTPα-D2-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) construct. Interestingly, treatment of cell lysates with H2O2 did not lead to the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds between RPTPα monomers (data not shown). This indicates that the monomers have to be in very close proximity of each other for disulfide bond formation, like in the cell membrane where they constitutively form dimers. Furthermore, these results rule out the possibility that the H2O2-induced conformational change in RPTPα-D2 is caused by the formation of disulfide bonds between RPTP-D2s. It is likely that the reversible conformational change in RPTPα-D2 is caused by the formation of cyclic sulfenyl-amide, which reportedly leads to conformational changes of the catalytic site (29Salmeen A. Andersen J.N. Myers M.P. Meng T.C. Hinks J.A. Tonks N.K. Barford D. Nature. 2003; 423: 769-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar, 30van Montfort R.L. Congreve M. Tisi D. Carr R. Jhoti H. Nature. 2003; 423: 773-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Cyclic sulfenyl-amide formation leads to the opening up of the catalytic pocket, making it more shallow and rendering the catalytic cysteine more accessible for intermolecular disulfide bond formation with the thiolate anion Cys-723 from the dyad-related RPTPα monomer. In line with the cyclic sulfenyl-amide, intermolecular disulfide bond formation excludes oxygen from the structure and protects against irreversible oxidation as shown here by the inability of pervanadate to triply oxidize the catalytic cysteine after peroxide treatment. This mechanism of intermolecular disulfide bond formation between the catalytically inactive RPTP-D2s may protect membrane-localized PTPs against irreversible oxidation by free radicals that are abundantly formed upon cell stimulation, such as growth factor receptor signaling. From our recovery studies (Fig. 5), intermolecular disulfide bond formation seemed to reverse faster than stable dimer formation. Indeed, DTT treatment of lysates from cells stimulated with H2O2 immediately reduced the intermolecular disulfide bonds between RPTPα monomers, whereas differentially tagged monomers still co-immunoprecipitated. In line with this, recovery from the H2O2-induced conformational changes of RPTPα-D2 in cells as detected by FRET was relatively slow (22Blanchetot C. Tertoolen L.G. den Hertog J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), indicating that refolding of RPTPα-D2 is independent of disulfide bond reduction but probably a result of another intrinsic property of the protein. Taken together, these findings led us to the model that H2O2-induced oxidation of the RPTPα-Cys-723 to cyclic sulfenyl-amide leads to a conformational change of RPTPα-D2s and thereby a change in rotational coupling resulting in dimer stabilization. This cyclic sulfenyl-amide reacts rapidly with the thiolate anion Cys-723 of the dyad-related monomer to form a disulfide bond. Recovery from oxidative stress first leads to a reduction of the intermolecular disulfide bond followed by a slower refolding of the protein. Formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds between RPTPs renders both monomers in the dimer in an inactive conformation, and at the same time it protects against irreversible further oxidation.

Mycobacteria cause extremely serious diseases, such as tuberculosis and leprosy, and are major causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Although little is known about the molecular mechanisms of mycobacterial pathogenesis, the data accumulated during the last decades revealed that the mycobacterial envelope plays a fundamental role in this process. This envelope is a complex structure that differs from those of other bacteria by both its molecular composition and the architectural arrangement of its constituents. It is characterized by its high lipid content, up to 60% of the dry weight of the bacteria, and by the variety of lipid compounds with unusual structures, many of which are unique to mycobacteria (1Daffé M. Draper P. Adv. Microbiol. Phys. 1998; 39: 131-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistently, genome sequence data for several mycobacterial species revealed that a high proportion of genes may be involved in lipid metabolism (∼250 genes in M. tuberculosis) (2Cole S.T. Brosch R.

Two structurally related families of lipids, phthiocerol diesters and phenolic glycolipids, have retained a special attention. These mycobacterial cell envelope constituents are produced by a small number of slow growing species, in particular the pathogenic species Mycobacterium leprae, Mycobacterium ulcerans, Mycobacterium marinum and members of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (4Daffé M. Lanéelle M.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 2049-2055PubMed Google Scholar). Phthiocerols diesters are composed of a mixture of long chain β-diols that are esterified by multimethyl-branched fatty acids. Depending on the asymmetric centers bearing the methyl branches (d or l series), the fatty acids are called mycocerosic or phthioceranic acids, respectively, and the corresponding complex lipids are named dimycocerosates of phthiocerol (DIMs) 1The abbreviations used are: DIM, dimycocerosates of phthiocerol; ADC, albumin-dextrose-catalase; BCG, Bacille Calmette-Guérin; GC, gas chromatography; GC-MS, GC-mass spectrometry; km, kanamycin; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight; OADC, oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase; PGL, phenolic glycolipid; p-HBAD, p-hydroxybenzoic acid derivative(s). 1The abbreviations used are: DIM, dimycocerosates of phthiocerol; ADC, albumin-dextrose-catalase; BCG, Bacille Calmette-Guérin; GC, gas chromatography; GC-MS, GC-mass spectrometry; km, kanamycin; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight; OADC, oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase; PGL, phenolic glycolipid; p-HBAD, p-hydroxybenzoic acid derivative(s). or diphthioceranates of phthiocerol (DIPs) (4Daffé M. Lanéelle M.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 2049-2055PubMed Google Scholar). The phenolic glycolipids (PGLs) consist of a lipid core very similar to those of DIMs or diphthioceranates of phthiocerol but ω-terminated by an aromatic nucleus that is glycosylated by a type- or species specific mono-, tri-, or tetrasaccharide (Fig. 1) (5Brennan P.J. Ratledge C. Wilkinson S.G. Microbial lipids. Academic Press, Inc., London1988: 203-298Google Scholar, 6Daffé M. Lemassu A. Doyle R.J. Glycomicrobiology. Plenum Press, New York2000: 225-273Google Scholar). Several groups have clearly shown that DIMs are involved in mycobacterial pathogenicity by demonstrating that M. tuberculosis mutants deficient in the biosynthesis or transport of these molecules display attenuated multiplication in guinea pigs and mice (7Goren M.B. Brokl O. Schaefer W.B. Infect. Immun. 1974; 9: 150-158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Camacho L.R. Ensergueix D. Perez E. Gicquel B. Guilhot C. Mol.

Results suggesting that PGLs are involved in the pathogenesis of mycobacterial infections are less clear-cut. These glycolipids exhibit biological activities in vitro that may be relevant to the pathogenesis of mycobacterial infections. For instance, the major PGLs from M. leprae (PGL-1) and from other mycobacterial species inhibit the proliferation of T lymphocytes after stimulation with concanavalin A (10Mehra V. Brennan P.J.

Immun. 1989; 57: 3653-3659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, PGL-1 seems to be associated with resistance to intracellular killing by macrophages (12Neill M.A. Klebanoff S.J. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and promotes phagocytosis of M. leprae by macrophages and Schwann cells through binding to complement component C3 and laminin-2, respectively (13Schlesinger L.S.

The molecular basis of the interaction between M. leprae and Schwann cells was recently elucidated; the saccharidyl moiety of PGL-1 binds to the α2LG1, α2LG4, and α2LG5 modules of the peripheral nerve laminin α2 chain (14Ng V.

Similarly, a M. tuberculosis mutant deficient in the biosynthesis of PGL-tb was recently shown to be attenuated in the mouse model in comparison with the parental (PGL-tb producing) strain (15Barry, C. E., III (2003) in Keystone Symposium: Tuberculosis: Integrating Host and Pathogen Biology, Taos, New MexicoGoogle Scholar). However, most clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis do not synthesize PGL-tb (16Daffé M. Lacave C. Lanéelle M.-A. Lanéelle G. Eur. J.

We recently identified a third family of molecules related to PGL in the culture supernatant of all M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis BCG strains tested (20Constant P. Perez E. Malaga W.

These compounds, called p-hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives (p-HBAD) are small glycoconjugates that contain the same glycosylated phenolic moiety as PGL-tb (20Constant P. Perez E. Malaga W.

Because of the high structural similarity between p-HBAD and the key structural determinant for the interaction of this molecule with the host cellular ligand, i.e. the saccharide moiety of PGL, the role of p-HBAD in mycobacterial pathogenesis needs to be addressed. The biosynthesis of DIM and PGL has just begun to be elucidated and has been shown to involve a common synthetic pathway in which two different precursors, either C22-C24 fatty acid or p-hydroxyphenylalkanoic acid, are elongated by three malonyl-CoA and two methylmalonyl-CoA units to yield a common lipid core (Fig. 1) (21Azad A.K.

These sequential elongation steps are believed to be catalyzed by a group of five polyketide synthases named PpsA–E. Mycocerosic acids, the class of multimethyl-branched fatty acids that esterify phthiocerol and phenolphthiocerol in members of the M. tuberculosis complex and M. leprae (4Daffé M. Lanéelle M.A. J.

More recently, we have shown that another polyketide synthase, Pks15/1, catalyzes the elongation of p-hydroxybenzoic acids to form p-hydroxyphenylalkanoates, the substrate of PpsA–E in the biosynthesis of PGL (20Constant P.

The mas, ppsA–E and pks15/1 genes are clustered in a region of the M. tuberculosis chromosome that contains six other genes encoding acyl-adenylate synthase (fadD26 and fadD28) and transporters (drrA, drrB, drrC, and mmpL7) important for DIM biosynthesis and translocation (9Cox J.S.

This region contains genes encoding proteins with similarities to methyltransferases and glycosyltransferases, both enzymes that are required for the transfer and modification of the saccharide moiety of PGL (20Constant P.

In this study, we examined the formation of the carbohydrate domains of PGL-tb and p-HBAD. We provide evidences that the Rv2962cc Rv2958c, and Rv2957 genes are involved in the sequential transfer of the three monosaccharides found in PGL-tb and p-HBAD of M. tuberculosis. Bacterial Strains and Culture Conditions—M. tuberculosis H37Rv, Mt103 (25Jackson M. Phalen S.W. Lagranderie M. Ensergueix D. Chavarot P. Marchal G. McMurray D.N. Gicquel B. Guilhot C. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 2867-2873Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Canetti (Collection Institut Pasteur 140010059) and M. bovis BCG 1173P2 (the Pasteur strain) were grown as surface biofilm on Sauton's medium (100 ml in a 500-ml glass bottle) at 37 °C for biochemical analyses. M. tuberculosis H37Rv and M. bovis BCG were also grown on Middlebrook 7H9 medium (Difco) supplemented with ADC (0.2% dextrose, 0.5% bovine serum albumin fraction V, 0.0003% beef catalase) and 0.05% Tween 80 where indicated or on solid Middlebrook 7H11 medium (Difco) supplemented with OADC (0.005% oleic acid, 0.2% dextrose, 0.5% bovine serum albumin fraction V, 0.085% NaCl, 0.0003% beef catalase). Kanamycin and hygromycin were added when required to final concentrations of 40 and 50 μg/ml, respectively. Computer Analysis—The DNA sequences of M. tuberculosis strains CDC1551 and 210 were obtained from the Institute for Genomic Research website (www.tigr.org) and M. bovis strain AF2122/97 DNA sequence (spoligotype 9) from the Sanger Institute website (www.sanger.ac.uk). Multiple sequence alignments were performed using ClustalW (26Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J.

Construction of M. tuberculosis H37Rv Mutants—Mycobacterial DNA was extracted from 5 ml of saturated cultures as described previously (28Belisle J.T. Sonnenberg M.G. Parish T. Stoker N.G. Mycobacteria Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1998: 31-34Google Scholar). DNA pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of 10 mm Tris (pH 8) buffer. PCRs were performed using M. bovis BCG genomic DNA (Table I) in a final volume of 50 μl containing 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science), 10% Me2SO, and 1 mm each primer (Rv2962A and -B for Rv2962c; Rv2958A and -B for Rv2958c; Rv2957A and -B for Rv2957)(Table I). The amplification program consisted of 1 cycle at 95 °C for 10 min followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 57 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C. A final extension at 72 °C for 10 min was then performed. The PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 0.8% agarose gels. The various fragments, 2647 bp for Rv2962c, 3345 bp for Rv2957, and 3222 bp for Rv2958c were gel-purified using the Qiaquick gel extraction purification kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) and digested with NotI and XbaI. To remove the BamHI and ApaI restriction sites from the multicloning site, to be used later, the pBlueScript vector was digested with SpeI and KpnI and religated to give pPET2. The different PCR fragments were inserted between the NotI and XbaI restriction sites of pPET2 to give pPET6 (Rv2962c), pPET3 (Rv2957), and pPET4(Rv2958c) (Table II). A kanamycin resistance cassette formed by the Ωkm cassette from pHP45Ωkm (29Fellay R. Frey J. Krisch H.M.

The resulting plasmids were named pPET15, pPET10, and pPET12, respectively (Table II). The PmeI fragments from the various plasmids, containing the disrupted gene constructs, were inserted at the XbaI site of pPR27 (31Pelicic V. Jackson M. Reyrat J.M. Jacobs W.R. Gicquel B. Guilhot C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10955-10960Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), generating pPET42 (ΔRv2962c::km), pPET36 (ΔRv2957::km), and pPET38 (Rv2958c::km) (Table II). M. tuberculosis H37Rv was electrotransformed as previously described, and transformants were selected on 7H11 + OADC + kanamycin at 32 °C (32Pelicic V. Reyrat J.-M. Gicquel B. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 919-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Two transformants obtained with each of the plasmids were grown in 5 ml of 7H9 + ADC + kanamycin + Tween at 32 °C until saturation. Dilutions of these cultures were plated on 7H11 + OADC + kanamycin + sucrose and incubated at 39 °C for 4 weeks. Colonies of M. tuberculosis H37Rv containing pPET42, pPET36, or pPET38 were screened by PCR using primers C, D, E, res1, or res2 (Table I), corresponding to the gene to disrupt. The amplification program consisted of 1 cycle of 10 min at 95 °C followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, 3 min at 72 °C. A final extension of 10 min at 72 °C was then performed. For each construct, one clone giving the pattern corresponding to allelic exchange was retained for further analysis. These strains were renamed PMM22 (ΔRv2962c::km), PMM24 (ΔRv2957::km), and PMM19 (Rv2958c::km) (Table II).Table IPrimers used for the construction of the M. tuberculosis mutant strains and the complementation plasmid pPET52GeneOligonucleotideSequenceRv2962cRv2962A5′-GCTCTAGAGTTTAAACGCGATGACCCCGCCGAAG-3′Rv2962B5′-GCGCGGCCGCGTTTAAACCGCGTAAAGGCAGACCCTC-3′Rv2962C5′-GGCAGTATCAGTAGGTCGGCG-3′Rv2962D5′-ACGACCTCGGTGTACGTACGG-3′Rv2962E5′-AGCCAGGGTCACTGCTTCCGC-3′Rv2957Rv2957A5′-GCTCTAGAGTTTAAACTGAAGGCGCTGTCGGCCG-3′Rv2957B5′-GCGCGGCCGCGTTTAAACCATCGATATCTCGGACCC-3′Rv2957C5′-CGCGAATCCGAATTCGTCCCG-3′Rv2957D5′-AGCTGGTGCCGACATACAACC-3′Rv2957E5′-ATTTTCGCCCCCAACCTCGGC-3′Rv2958cRv2958A5′-GCTCTAGAGTTTAAACGTGGGCGCGAACGCGGTC-3′Rv2958B5′-GCGCGGCCGCGTTTAAACCGCGGCGTGGACCTGGCC-3′Rv2958C5′-GTCCAGAAGATGCTCAGCCGC-3′Rv2958D5′-ATTTTCGCCCCCAACCTCGGC-3′resres15′-GCTCTAGAGCAACCGTCCGAAATATTATAAA-3′res25′-GCTCTAGATCTCATAAAAATGTATCCTAAATCAAATATC-3′ Open table in a new tab Table IIPlasmids and strains used in this studyNameRelevant characteristicsSource or referenceStrainsH37RvM. tuberculosisGift from S.

The vector pMV361 contains the integration system from mycobacteriophage L5 and a mycobacterial promoter, phsp60, upstream from a multicloning site (33Stover C.K. de la Cruz V.F. Fuerst T.R.

Nature. 1991; 351: 456-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). The full-length Rv2958c gene from M. tuberculosis H37Rv was amplified by PCR using primers Rv2958A and Rv2958B. The PCR was performed in a final volume of 50 μl containing 2.5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega, Lyon, France), 10% Me2SO, and 1 mm each primer. The amplification program consisted of 1 cycle of 10 min at 95 °C followed by 35 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 30 s at 57 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C. A final extension of 10 min at 72 °C was then applied. The PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 0.8% agarose gel. The 3.2-kilobase fragment was gel-purified using the Qiaquick gel extraction purification kit (Qiagen). It was digested with BglII and BclI and inserted into the BamHI site of pMV361H to give pPET52. In this construct, the Rv2958c gene was placed under the control of the mycobacterial promotor phsp60. The plasmid, pPET52, was used for electrotransformation of M. bovis BCG and the PMM19 mutant strain. Transformants were selected on hygromycin-containing plates. Extraction and Purification of Glycolipids—Mycobacteria were separated from the culture media, and both were kept. The media were sterilized by filtration through 0.2-μm pore size membranes and concentrated to 110 of the initial volumes. Lipids from culture media were obtained by adding 2 volumes of CH3OH and 1 volume of CHCl3 to 0.8 volume of concentrated culture medium to yield a homogeneous one-phase mixture (34Bligh E. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar). After a 2-h period, the mixture was partitioned into two phases by the addition of 1 volume of H2O/CHCl3 (1:1, v/v). The organic phases were recovered, washed twice with water (50 ml), and dried. The cells were left in CHCl3/CH3OH (1:2 v/v) for 2 days at room temperature to kill bacteria. Lipids were then extracted once with CHCl3/CH3OH (1:1 v/v) for 24 h and twice with CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1 v/v) for 24 h each, washed twice with water (50 ml), and dried. The production of glycolipids by the various strains was examined by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). Briefly, the various extracts were dissolved in CHCl3 to give a final lipid concentration of 20 mg/ml. Equivalent volumes of each extract were deposited on silica gel G 60 plates (0.3 mm, 20 × 20 cm, Merck) which were run in CHCl3/CH3OH (95:5, v/v) or CHCl3/CH3OH (97:3, v/v). Glycolipids were visualized by spraying the plates with 0.2% anthrone (w/v) in concentrated H2SO4 followed by heating. Glycolipids were purified as previously described (16Daffé M. Lacave C. Lanéelle M.-A. Lanéelle G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 167: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Crude lipid extracts from cells or culture media were subjected to chromatography on a Florisil (60–100 mesh) column and eluted with a series of concentrations of CH3OH (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 50, and 100%) in CHCl3. Each fraction was analyzed by TLC on silica gel G 60 using CHCl3/CH3OH (95:5, v/v) as the solvent system. Glycolipids were visualized as described above. When necessary, glycolipids were additionally purified by preparative chromatography on silica gel G 60 plates (0.3 mm, 20 × 20 cm, Merck) using CHCl3/CH3OH (95:5, v/v) as the developing solvent. Apolar lipids, such as DIMs, were analyzed by TLC on silica gel G 60 plates using petroleum ether/diethyl ether (9:1, v/v) as eluant. Lipid compounds were visualized by spraying the plates with 10% phosphomolybdic acid in ethanol followed by heating. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy—The 1H NMR spectra were recorded at 295 K on a Bruker DMX 500 apparatus using a 5-mm BBI probe. Samples were dissolved in 100% CDCl3. The chemical shifts obtained by NMR spectroscopy were assigned using chloroform as the reference for protons (7.23 ppm). Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption-ionization Time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) Mass Spectrometry—MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed using a Voyager DE-STR MALDI-TOF instrument (PerSeptive Biosystems) equipped with a pulse nitrogen laser emitting at 337 nm as previously described (35Laval F. Lanéelle M.-A. Deon C. Montsarrat B. Daffé M. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 4537-4544Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed in the reflector mode using an extraction delay time of 100 ns and an accelerating voltage operating in positive ion mode of 20 kV. The mass spectra were mass assigned by external calibration. Samples (1 μl of a 1 mg/ml solution in CHCl3) were directly applied onto the sample plate. The matrix solution (0.5 μl of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid at 10 mg/ml in CHCl3/CH3OH (1:1, v/v)) was added. The samples were then allowed to crystallize at room temperature. Chemical Analysis—Lipid samples were methanolized using CH3OH/HCl prepared by the acetyl chloride reaction on methanol in anhydrous conditions. Samples were dissolved in 500 μlofCH3OH/HCl (1 n) and incubated overnight at 80 °C in nitrogen atmosphere. The solvent was evaporated under nitrogen and then co-evaporated three times with anhydrous methanol. For trimethylsilyl derivatization, samples were dissolved in 200 μlof anhydrous pyridine. We then added 100 μl of hexamethyldisilazane and 50 μl of trimethylchlorosilane (36Sweeley C.C. Bentley R. Makita M. Wells W.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; 85: 2497-2507Crossref Scopus (2150) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The mixture was dried under nitrogen, and the trimethylsilyl derivatives were dissolved in diethyl ether for gas chromatography (GC) and GC-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). GC and GC-MS Analysis—GC analyses were performed using a Girdel series 30 instrument equipped with an OV1 capillary column (0.3"

In humans, heterozygous C/EBPα gene mutations were found only in acute myeloid leukemia (7Pabst T. Mueller B.U. Zhang P. Radomska H.S. Narravula S. Schnittger S. Behre G. Hiddemann W. Tenen D.G. Nat.

Disruption of the C/EBPα binding site in the clotting factor IX gene, which is preferentially expressed in liver, was shown to cause hemophilia B (8Crossley M. Brownlee G.G. Nature. 1990; 345: 444-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), indicating that C/EBPα plays an important role in maintaining liver-specific functions. Mice carrying a targeted disruption of the C/EBPα gene die within 8 h after birth from hypoglycemia caused by decreased expression of genes, including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), liver glycogen synthase (Gys2), and uncoupling protein that are involved in energy metabolism in hepatocytes and adipocytes (9Wang N.-D.

Brownlee G.G. Br. J. Haematol. 1997; 99: 578-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Furthermore, C/EBPα was found to be essential for acute-phase response to inflammation (12Burgess-Beusse B.L. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell.

The lethal phenotype resulting from embryonic disruption of C/EBPα in mice renders this model of little value in determining the function of C/EBPα in adult mice. To circumvent this problem, we originally created conditional C/EBPα-null mice using a recombinant adenovirus carrying the Cre gene used to specifically disrupt the C/EBPα gene in liver (14Lee Y.H. Sauer B. Johnson P.F. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6014-6022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These liver-specific C/EBPα-null mice exhibited reduced expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in bilirubin detoxification and gluconeogenesis, including bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, PEPCK, and Gys2 in adult liver (14Lee Y.H. Sauer B. Johnson P.F. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6014-6022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, because liver damage due to the elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase was caused by adenovirus infection in this model and the deletion was transient, a Cre-transgenic mouse line that specifically expresses the Cre gene in hepatocytes under the control of albumin promoter was used to generate liver-specific C/EBPα-null mice. In the present study, the role of hepatic C/EBPα in regulating hepatic function and gene expression in adult mice was examined. The in vivo data show that mice lacking hepatic C/EBPα exhibited impaired glucose tolerance and age-dependent hepatosteatosis. Altered expression of genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism was also found. Animals—Liver-specific C/EBPα-null mice were generated by Cre-loxP-mediated deletion (in which the Cre gene is under the control of the albumin promoter) to remove the complete coding region of the C/EBPα gene (14Lee Y.H.

Sauer B. LeRoith D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7324-7329Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. Derek LeRoith. All experiments were performed using C/EBPαflox/flox × albuminCre+ (KO) and C/EBPαflox/flox × albuminCre- (FLOX). Mice were housed in a pathogen-free animal facility under standard 12-h light/12-h dark cycle with ad libitum water and chow. All experiments with mice were carried out under the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care guidelines with approval of the NCI, National Institutes of Health Animal Care and Use Committee. PCR Genotyping for C/EBPα and Cre Genes—For C/EBPα genotyping, ∼50 ng of tail DNA was amplified in a 10-μl final reaction mixture containing 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mm deoxynucleotides triphosphates, 2.5% of Me2SO, 0.25 unit of Taq2000 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and 0.2 μm C/EBPα gene-specific primers; CEBP-1 (5′-CCACTCACCGCCTTGGAAAGTCACA-3′) and CEBP-2 (5′-CCGCGGCTCCACCTCGTAGAAGTCG-3′). Cycling conditions were 97 °C for 2 min and then 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, followed by a 10-min extension at 72 °C. These primers yield products of 309 and 355 bp for the wild-type and the floxed alleles, respectively. The Cre and microsomal epoxide hydrolase genes, as an internal control, were genotyped as described by Hayhurst et al. (16Hayhurst G.P. Lee Y.-H. Lambert G. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1393-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Northern Blot Analysis—Northern blot analysis was carried out as described previously (17Inoue Y. Hayhurst G.P. Inoue J. Mori M. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25257-25265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). All probes were amplified from a mouse cDNA library using gene-specific primers and cloned into a pCR II vector (Invitrogen). Sequences were verified using a CEQ 2000 Dye Terminator cycle sequencing kit (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) with a CEQ 2000XL DNA Analysis system (Beckman Coulter). Blood and Serum Analysis—Blood from the tail vein was analyzed for glucose levels using an automatic glucometer (Bayer, Elkhart, IN). Mice were anesthetized with 2.5% avertin and decapitated, and the trunk blood was collected in a serum separator tube (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). The serum was separated by centrifugation at 7000 × g for 5 min and stored at -80 °C prior to analysis for ammonia (Wako, Osaka, Japan) and insulin (RIA insulin kit, Linco Research, St. Charles, MO). Concentrations of total cholesterol and triglyceride (Sigma) as well as free cholesterol and phospholipid (Wako, Osaka, Japan) were measured from 12-μl aliquots of serum using commercial kits and the Hitachi 911 automated chemistry analyzer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). Determination of Liver Glycogen Content—Liver glycogen content was determined using a slight modification of a previously described procedure (18Shen W. Scearce L.M. Brestelli J.E. Sund N.J. Kaestner K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42812-42817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Liver pieces (50 mg) were digested in 250 μl of 1 n KOH at 95 °C for 30 min and neutralized with 250 μl of 1 n HCl. 250 μl of 0.3 m sodium acetate (pH 4.8) containing 10 mg/ml amyloglucosidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added into the 100 μl of the homogenate and incubated at 30 °C for 2 h. The resulting homogenate was centrifuged, and the produced glucose content was colorimetrically measured using a Glucose Trinder kit (Sigma). Determination of Liver Lipid Content—Liver triglyceride, total cholesterol, and free cholesterol contents were determined using a modification of previously described procedures (19Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Basso F. Freeman L. Knapper C.L. Remaley A. Stonik J. Neufeld E.B. Tansey T. Amar M.J.

Briefly, liver pieces (100 mg) were homogenized in 2.1 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1) and incubated at 37 °C for 40 min. Following incubation, 0.4 ml of water was added, and the mixture was stored at 4 °C overnight. The lower phase was collected, and 0.83 volume of a 47:3:48 mixture of water/chloroform/methanol was added and stored at 4 °C overnight. The organic phase was collected and dried under nitrogen gas, followed by heating at 90 °C for 10 min. The samples were dissolved in 250 μl of 2-propanol and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 3 min. The resulting supernatant was assayed for total cholesterol and triglyceride (Sigma). Glucose Tolerance Tests—Mice were fasted overnight for 14 h followed by intraperitoneal glucose injection (2 g/kg body weight). Blood obtained from the tail vein at 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after the injection was directly measured for glucose levels using an automatic glucometer. Similarly, blood obtained from the retro-orbital vein was collected, and the plasma was separated and stored at -80 °C prior to analysis for insulin (Linco Research). Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography Analysis—Plasma lipoproteins from pooled plasma samples (60 μl; n = 6) were analyzed by gel filtration on two Superose 6HR columns in series (fast-protein liquid chromatography (FPLC); Amersham Biosciences) at 0.3 ml/min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 mm EDTA and 0.02% sodium azide (21Lambert G. Amar M.J. Martin P. Fruchart-Najib J. Foger B. Shamburek R.D. Brewer Jr., H.B. Santamarina-Fojo S. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 667-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse apolipoproteins A-I, A-II, B, and E were identified by Western blotting of serum and FPLC fractions using a mixture of polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin G antisera raised against purified apolipoproteins (Biodesign, Saco, ME). Western Blot Analysis—Frozen livers, white adipose tissue, and brown adipose tissue were crushed on dry ice using a mortar and pestle, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, homogenized in a lysis buffer (9 m urea, 2% Triton X-100, 70 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and allowed to sit on ice for 30 min. The homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were used as whole cell lysates. Total protein (100 μg), determined by the Bio-Rad assay, was diluted with 3× Laemmli sample buffer, incubated at 65 °C for 15 min, fractionated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was incubated for 1 h with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, 5% dry milk, 6% glycine, and 1% fetal bovine serum, and then for 1 h with a 1:1,000–5,000 dilution of a primary antibody against C/EBPα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After washing, the membrane was incubated for 1 h with 1:10,000-diluted horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and the reaction product was visualized using an enhanced chemi-luminescent system (ECL plus, Amersham Biosciences). Histological and Immunohistochemical Analysis—Livers from 2-week-old and 2-, 6-, and 12-month-old liver-specific C/EBPα-null and control mice were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin, and sections cut at a thickness of 3 μm were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Immunohistochemical analysis was performed using antibody specifically against C/EBPα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Generation of Liver-specific C/EBPα-null Mice—A liver-specific C/EBPα-null mouse line was generated to avoid the problems, including hepatotoxicity and transient recombination caused by recombinant adenovirus carrying the Cre gene (14Lee Y.H. Sauer B. Johnson P.F. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6014-6022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The albumin-Cre transgene (AlbCre) was introduced into mice carrying two C/EBPα-floxed (flanked by loxP) alleles (C/EBPαflox/flox). The mice that were F1 (C/EBPαflox/wt; AlbCre+) were interbred with C/EBPαflox/flox littermates lacking AlbCre. All mice were genotyped by PCR, and C/EBPαflox/flox; AlbCre+ (designated KO) and C/EBPαflox/flox; AlbCre- (FLOX) mice were used for the following experiments. To assess loss of C/EBPα gene expression, Northern blot analysis was performed using total liver RNA from 4- and 7-week-old control (FLOX) and KO mice (Fig. 1A, the upper panel). Expression of C/EBPα mRNA was lost in the livers of KO mice, but expression in FLOX mice was unchanged. To confirm whether deletion of C/EBPα is a liver-specific event, Northern blot analysis was performed using white adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue where C/EBPα is highly expressed (4Birkenmeier E.H. Gwynn B. Howard S. Jerry J. Gordon J.I. Landschulz W.H. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1146-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). There was no significant difference in C/EBPα mRNA between these tissues in FLOX and KO mice (Fig. 1A, the middle and lower panel). Next, Western blot analysis was performed using liver total protein from 4- and 7-week-old KO and FLOX mice (Fig. 1B). Hepatic C/EBPα proteins (42 and 30 kDa) were detected in FLOX mice, but almost no expression was observed in KO mice, indicating that expression of C/EBPα mRNA and protein were extinguished in KO mice in a liver-specific manner. Phenotypes of 2-Week-Old and 2-Month-Old Liver-specific C/EBPα-null Mice—To determine the effects of C/EBPα deletion in adult liver, body weights, liver weights, and histology were investigated. In 2-month-old mice, there was no significant difference in body weights between KO and FLOX mice, but the livers in KO mice were enlarged relative to those in FLOX mice (Table I). Furthermore, no significant histological difference in livers of KO mice was observed as compared with FLOX mice in both 2-week-old and 2-month-old mice (Fig. 2, A–D). Immunohistochemistry with C/EBPα antibody confirmed that C/EBPα was expressed in the nuclei of FLOX mice but not in KO mice (Fig. 2, E and F). Whole body C/EBPα-null mice showed a marked reduction in liver glycogen as revealed by periodic acid-Schiff staining (9Wang N.-D. Finegold M.J. Bradley A. Ou C.N. Abdelsayed S.V. Wilde M.D. Taylor R. Wilson D.R. Darlington G.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1108-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar), but liver-specific C/EBPα-null mice did not exhibit reduced hepatic glycogen levels (FLOX, 9.8 ± 2.0 mg/g of liver; KO, 10.8 ± 2.4 mg/g of liver). There was no significant difference in fat-positive cells determined with oil red O staining (data not shown).Table ILiver weights and blood/serum analysis of liver-specific C/EBPα-null and control miceParameterAge2 months6 months12 monthsFLOXKOFLOXKOFLOXKOn1418132468Body weight (g)25.5 ± 0.825.4 ± 0.132.6 ± 0.836.1 ± 0.7ap < 0.0136.2 ± 1.939.1 ± 2.5LiverWet weight (g)1.1 ± 0.11.3 ± 0.1bp < 0.05.

The levels of triglyceride, total, free, and esterified cholesterol, and phospholipids in KO mice were indistinguishable from those in FLOX mice, but the levels of free fatty acid were significantly reduced in KO mice (Table I). Furthermore, there was no significant difference in glucose levels between KO and FLOX mice. Altered Expression of Genes Involved in Glucose Metabolism, Except Glucokinase, Was Not Observed in 2-Week-Old and 2-Month-Old Liver-specific C/EBPα-null Mice—Because C/EBPα is known to regulate genes involved in glucose metabolism such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), and liver glycogen synthase (Gys2) (9Wang N.-D. Finegold M.J. Bradley A. Ou C.N. Abdelsayed S.V. Wilde M.D. Taylor R. Wilson D.R. Darlington G.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1108-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar) at birth, Northern blot analysis was performed to determine whether expression of these genes is reduced in liver-specific C/EBPα-null mice. It was also reported that the PEPCK and Gys2 expression was reduced in the adult livers of conditional C/EBPα-null mice generated using the adenovirus-Cre gene delivery system (14Lee Y.H. Sauer B. Johnson P.F. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6014-6022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but no significant differences of PEPCK and Gys2 were observed in the livers of both 2-week-old and 2-month-old KO mice (Fig. 3, A and B). Expression of G6Pase and glucose-6-phosphatase transporter (G6Pase-T) was increased in 2-week-old KO mice, but unchanged in 2-month-old KO mice as compared with FLOX mice (Fig. 3, A and B). Expression of other enzymes involved in glucose homeostasis such as glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2), liver pyruvate kinase, pyruvate carboxylase (PC), fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, and glycogen phosphorylase was also unchanged (Fig. 3, A and B). Interestingly, expression of glucokinase (GK) was reduced in both 2-week-old and 2-month-old KO mice compared with FLOX mice (Fig. 3, A and B). Expression of C/EBPβ, a closely related member of the C/EBP family and predominantly expressed in liver (22Lekstrom-Himes J. Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28545-28548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), was unchanged (Fig. 3, A and B). Liver-specific C/EBPα-null Mice Have Hyperammonemia due to Down-regulation of Carbamoyl Phosphate Synthase-I—The urea cycle is composed of five enzymes; carbamoyl phosphate synthase-I (CPS-I), ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), argininosuccinate synthase (ASS), argininosuccinate lyase (ASL), and arginase-I. Hyperammonemia was caused by reduced expression of four genes except OTC in whole body C/EBPα-null mice (10Kimura T. Christoffels V.M. Chowdhury S. Iwase K. Matsuzaki H. Mori M. Lambers W.H. Darlington G.J. Takiguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27505-27510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the same results are obtained in adult liver-specific C/EBPα-null mice, serum ammonia levels were measured and Northern blot analysis of genes involved in the urea cycle was performed. The ammonia levels in both 2-week-old and 2-month-old KO mice were significantly higher as compared with FLOX mice (Fig. 4A). Northern blot analysis revealed that expression of CPS-I was significantly decreased in both KO mice, but expression of the other four genes was unchanged (Fig. 4B), indicating that reduced expression of CPS-I caused hyperammonemia in liver-specific C/EBPα-null mice. Aged Liver-specific C/EBPα-null Mice Exhibit Steatotic Livers and Reduced Serum Cholesterol—To investigate whether older liver-specific C/EBPα-null mice exhibit a phenotype, further analysis was performed using 6- and 12-month-old mice. In 6-month-old mice, body and liver weights in KO mice were significantly increased as compared with those in FLOX mice (Table I). In 12-month-old mice, body and liver weights in KO mice appeared to be increased as compared with those in FLOX mice, but only the liver weight in KO mice was significantly increased (Table I). These KO mice exhibited steatotic livers that were not observed in 2-week-old and 2-month-old KO mice (Fig. 2, G–J). Lipid accumulation in these KO mice was confirmed by oil red O staining (data not shown). Based on H&E staining, 83% (n = 20/24) and 80% (n = 8/10) of livers of KO mice were steatotic in 6- and 12-month-old mice, respectively. However, control FLOX mice did not exhibit steatotic livers (6-month-old; n = 0/13, 12-month-old; n = 0/6). To quantitate hepatic lipid contents in these mice, hepatic triglyceride and cholesterol levels were determined (Fig. 5). There was no difference of both levels between 2-month-old FLOX and KO mice. However, their levels were significantly increased in 6-month and 12-month-old KO mice as compared with those FLOX mice, indicating that these results are consistent with the histological results shown in Fig. 2. Serum triglyceride levels in these aged mice were unchanged and similar to 2-month-old mice, but serum total and esterified cholesterol and phospholipid levels in both 6- and 12-month-old KO mice were dramatically reduced as compared with FLOX mice (Table I). As mentioned above, this reduction was not observed in 2-month-old KO mice (Table I). To further characterize the reduction of serum lipids, serum from 6-month-old FLOX and KO mice was subjected to FPLC analysis. The levels of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-, LDL-, and HDL-cholesterol were decreased in KO mice compared with FLOX mice (Fig. 6). Western blot analysis of lipoproteins indicated that KO mice exhibited reduced apoB100 in LDL fraction as well as decreased apoA-II in HDL fraction, whereas apoA-I, E, and B48 were not significantly affected as compared with FLOX mice (Fig. 6, inset). Liver-specific C/EBPα-null Mice Exhibit Impaired Glucose Tolerance—To further characterize the influence of disruption of hepatic C/EBPα in aged mice, blood glucose levels were investigated. The levels were unchanged in 6-month-old mice, but significantly increased in 12-month-old KO mice (Table I). Hepatic glycogen content in 6-month-old mice was not significantly different between FLOX and KO mice (8.9 ± 3.6 and 6.5 ± 1.7 mg/g liver, respectively), and similar results were found in 2-month-old mice. A glucose tolerance test was performed to investigate whether KO mice exhibit impaired glucose tolerance. As shown in Fig. 7 (A and B), both 2-month and 6-month-old KO mice significantly exhibited impaired glucose tolerance as compared with FLOX mice. However, there was no significant difference in the insulin levels in both 2-month and 6-month-old KO mice as compared with FLOX mice during the glucose tolerance test (Fig. 7, C and D). Furthermore, the basal levels of serum insulin in 2-, 6-, and 12-month old KO mice were unchanged from their FLOX counterparts (Table I). Reduction of Expression of Hepatic Genes Involved in Lipid and Glucose Metabolism in Aged Liver-specific C/EBPα-null Mice—To determine the mechanism of accounting for the phenotypes of the aged KO mice, Northern blot analysis was performed using the livers of 6-month-old KO mice (Fig. 8). The expression of genes encoding apoB, A-IV, and C-III and serum amyloid A4 protein was reduced in KO mice as compared with that in FLOX mice, but apoA-II was unaffected, although serum apoA-II was slightly decreased in HDL-cholesterol fraction as shown in Fig. 6 (Fig. 8A). Furthermore, the expression of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) was slightly reduced in KO mice (Fig. 8B). Conversely, the expression of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) that is normally silent in liver was markedly increased in KO mice (Fig. 8B). Peroxisome prolif"
https://openalex.org/W1975763361,"Amino acid substitutions at the Lys-650 codon within the activation loop kinase domain of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) result in graded constitutive phosphorylation of the receptor. Accordingly, the Lys-650 mutants are associated with dwarfisms with graded clinical severity. To assess the importance of the phosphorylation level on FGFR3 maturation along the secretory pathway, hemagglutinin A-tagged derivatives were studied. The highly activated SADDAN (severe achondroplasia with developmental delay and acanthosis nigricans) mutant accumulates in its immature and phosphorylated form in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which fails to be degraded. Furthermore, the Janus kinase (Jak)/STAT pathway is activated from the ER by direct recruitment of Jak1. Abolishing the autocatalytic property of the mutated FGFR3 by replacing the critical Tyr-718 reestablishes the receptor full maturation and inhibits signaling. Differently, the low activated hypochondroplasia mutant is present as a mature phosphorylated form on the plasma membrane, although with a delayed transition in the ER, and is completely processed. Signaling does not occur in the presence of brefeldin A; instead, STAT1 is activated when protein secretion is blocked with monensin, suggesting that the hypochondroplasia receptor signals at the exit from the ER. Our results suggest that kinase activity affects FGFR3 trafficking and determines the spatial segregation of signaling pathways. Consequently, the defect in down-regulation of the highly activated receptors results in the increased signaling capacity from the intracellular compartments, and this may determine the severity of the diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2050154707,"A few mycobacterial species, most of which are pathogenic for humans, produce dimycocerosates of phthiocerol (DIM) and of glycosylated phenolphthiocerol, also called phenolglycolipid (PGL), two groups of molecules shown to be important virulence factors. The biosynthesis of these molecules is a very complex pathway that involves more than 15 enzymatic steps and has just begun to be elucidated. Most of the genes known to be involved in these pathways are clustered on the chromosome of M. tuberculosis. Based on their amino acid sequences, we hypothesized that the proteins encoded by Rv2952 and Rv2959c, two open reading frames of this locus, are involved in the transfer of methyl groups onto various hydroxyl functions during the biosynthesis of DIM, PGL, and related p-hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives (p-HBAD). Using allelic exchange and site-specific recombination, we produced three recombinant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis carrying insertions in Rv2952 or Rv2959c. Analysis of these mutants revealed that (i) the protein encoded by Rv2952 is a methyltransferase catalyzing the transfer of a methyl group onto the lipid moiety of phthiotriol and glycosylated phenolphthiotriol dimycocerosates to form DIM and PGL, respectively, (ii) Rv2959c is part of an operon including the newly characterized Rv2958c gene that encodes a glycosyltransferase also involved in PGL and p-HBAD biosynthesis, and (iii) the enzyme encoded by Rv2959c catalyzes the O-methylation of the hydroxyl group located on carbon 2 of the rhamnosyl residue linked to the phenolic group of PGL and p-HBAD produced by M. tuberculosis. These data further extend our understanding of the biosynthesis of important mycobacterial virulence factors and provide additional tools to decipher the molecular mechanisms of action of these molecules during the pathogenesis of tuberculosis.

Bacteria of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex exhibit amazing capacities to infect their host, resist bactericidal responses, and subvert the host immune response. Thus, M. tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, has colonized one-third of the population of the world and kills more than two million people annually (1Organization World Health Fact Sheet 104. World Health Organization, Geneva2002Google Scholar). This pathogenicity has been largely attributed to the unusual mycobacterial envelope. This complex structure has a high lipid content, up to 60% of the dry weight of the bacterium, and contains a large variety of lipids with unusual structures (2Daffé M. Draper P. Adv. Microb.

Schematically, from the cytoplasm to the external side of the bacterium, the cell envelope is formed by (i) a plasma membrane, (ii) a cell wall core composed of three covalently attached macromolecules, i.e. the peptidoglycan, the arabinogalactan, and the mycolic acids, which are long chain (C60-C90) fatty acids, capped with a layer of non-covalently linked lipids and glycolipids, and (iii) a capsule of polysaccharide, proteins and lipids (2Daffé M. Draper P. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1998; 39: 131-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among the extractable constituents of the cell envelope are two structurally related families of lipids, the diesters of phthiocerol and phenolglycolipids. The former class of lipids is a mixture of long chain β-diols, called phthiocerol and relatives, which are esterified by multimethyl-branched fatty acids (3Asselineau J. Indian J. Chest. Dis. 1982; 24: 143-157Google Scholar). Depending on the stereochemistry of the chiral centers bearing the methyl branches, the fatty acids are called mycocerosic or phthioceranic acids (4Daffé M. Lanéelle M.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 2049-2055PubMed Google Scholar). To date, phthiocerol dimycocerosates (DIM) 1The abbreviations used are: DIM, dimycocerosates of phthiocerol; DIP, diphthioceranates of phthiocerol; km, kanamycin; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight; ORF, open reading frames; PGL, phenolglycolipid; PGL-tb, PGL of M. tuberculosis; p-HBAD, p-hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives; TMS, trimethylsilyl; BCG, Bacille Calmette-Guérin; km, kanamycin. and diphthioceranates (DIP) have been identified in eight mycobacterial species; DIM have been found in M. tuberculosis, Mycobacterium bovis, Mycobacterium africanum, Mycobacterium leprae, Mycobacterium gastri, and Mycobacterium kansasii, whereas DIP have been found in Mycobacterium marinum and Mycobacterium ulcerans (4Daffé M. Lanéelle M.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 2049-2055PubMed Google Scholar). With the exception of M. gastri, all the DIM- or DIP-containing species are pathogenic. The mycobacterial species that produce DIM or DIP may also synthesize structurally related substances, called phenolphthiocerols and relatives, in which phthiocerol is ω-terminated by an aromatic nucleus, usually glycosylated by a type- or species-specific mono-, tri-, or a tetrasaccharide unit leading to PGL (5Brennan P.J.

Plenum Press, New York2000: 225-273Google Scholar). More recently, we identified a new group of molecules related to PGL, the glycosylated p-hydroxybenzoic acid methyl esters (p-HBAD), in the culture media of bacteria of the M. tuberculosis complex (7Constant P.

The genes involved in the biosynthesis of DIM, PGL, and p-HBAD are clustered on the chromosome of bacteria of the M. tuberculosis complex (Fig. 1) (8Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T.

Five of these genes, ppsA–E, encode a type-I modular polyketide synthase responsible for the synthesis of phthiocerol and phenolphtiocerol by the elongation of a C20-C22 fatty acyl chain or an acyl chain containing a phenol moiety with three malonyl-CoA and two methylmalonyl-CoA units (12Azad A.K.

The pks15/1 gene encodes an iterative type-I polyketide synthase catalyzing the elongation of p-HBA to form p-hydroxyphenylalkanoates, which in turn are converted into phenolphthiocerol derivatives by the PpsA–E synthase (7Constant P.

This gene is mutated in most M. tuberculosis clinical isolates, explaining why most strains of M. tuberculosis are unable to synthesize PGL even though they produce the structurally related DIM and p-HBAD. The mas gene encodes another iterative type-I polyketide synthase responsible for the synthesis of mycocerosic acids after 2–4 rounds of extension of C18-C20 fatty acids with methylmalonyl-CoA units (13Azad A.K.

Two additional genes, fadD26 and fadD28 (also named acoas), encode two acyl-adenylate synthases involved in the formation of DIM and PGL presumably by activating the various polyketide synthase substrates (11Camacho L.R.

Finally, four genes (drrA, drrB, and drrC encoding an ABC transporter and mmpL7 encoding a transporter of the RND permease superfamily) are also located in this locus and are involved in the translocation of DIM from the cytoplasm to the bacterial cell surface (11Camacho L.R.

Close examination of this genomic region revealed five putative open reading frames (ORF) encoding proteins possibly involved in the glycosylation and methylation of DIM and PGL (7Constant P.

In the present paper we show that the other two genes (Rv2959c and Rv2952) encode methyltransferases. We demonstrate (i) that the protein encoded by Rv2952 catalyzes the methylation of phthiotriol and phenophthiotriol to form phthiocerol and phenophthiocerol, respectively, and (ii) that the Rv2959c product is involved in the O-methylation of the hydroxyl group located at position 2 of the first rhamnosyl residue found in PGL-tb and p-HBAD of M. tuberculosis. We also show that Rv2959c and Rv2958c, which encodes the glycosyltransferase involved in the transfer of the terminal disaccharide moiety of PGL-tb and p-HBAD II (16Perez E. Constant P. Lemassu A.

Most of the materials and methods used are described in the accompanying article (16Perez E. Constant P. Lemassu A. Laval F. Daffé M. Guilhot C. J. Biol.

Construction of M. tuberculosis H37Rv Mutants—PCR was carried out in a final volume of 50 μl containing M. bovis Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) genomic DNA, 1 mm primer A (Rv2959A or Rv2952A), 1 mm primer B (Rv2959B or Rv2952B) (Table I), 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science), and 10% Me2SO. The amplification program consisted of 1 cycle of 10 min at 95 °C followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 57 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR product was analyzed by electrophoresis in 0.8% agarose gel. The resulting fragments, 2805 bp for Rv2952 and 2690 bp for Rv2959c, were gel-purified using the Qiaquick gel extraction purification kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France). The Rv2952 fragment was digested with SacI and XbaI, and the Rv2959c fragment was digested with NotI and XbaI. The pBlueScript vector was digested with SpeI and KpnI and religated yielding pPET2. The Rv2952c and Rv2959c PCR fragments were inserted into the pPET2 vector between the XbaI and SacI or between the XbaI and NotI restriction sites, respectively, to give pPET9 (Rv2952) and pPET5 (Rv2959c). A kanamycin resistance cassette (km) formed by the Ωkm cassette from pHP45Ωkm (17Fellay R. Frey J. Krisch H.M.

The resulting plasmids were named pPET23 and pPET14, respectively. The PmeI fragments from the various plasmids, containing the disrupted gene constructs, were inserted at the XbaI site of pPR27 (19Pelicic V. Jackson M. Reyrat J.M. Jacobs W.R. Gicquel B. Guilhot C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10955-10960Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), generating pPET34 (ΔRv2952::km) and pPET40 (Rv2959c::km). M. tuberculosis H37Rv was electrotransformed as previously described, and transformants were selected on 7H11 + oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase + km at 32 °C (20Pelicic V. Reyrat J.-M. Gicquel B. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 919-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Two transformants obtained with each of the plasmids were grown in 5 ml of 7H9 + albumin-dextrose-catalase + km + Tween at 32 °C until saturation. Dilutions of this culture were plated on 7H11 + oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase + km + sucrose and incubated at 39 °C for 4 weeks. The colonies were screened by PCR using primers C, D, E, res1, or res2. The amplification program consisted of 1 cycle of 10 min at 95 °C followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, 3 min at 72 °C, and a final 10 min at 72 °C. Two clones giving the pattern corresponding to allelic exchange were retained for further analysis. These strains were renamed PMM28 (ΔRv2952::km) and PMM28 (ΔRv2959c::km).Table IPrimers used for the construction and the characterization of the M. tuberculosis mutant strainsGeneOligonucleotideSequenceRv2959Rv2959A5′-GCTCTAGAGTTTAAACCGGCCCCGGACATGGTTG-3′Rv2959B5′-GCGCGGCCGCGTTTAAACCGTGACGGGTAAATCGGCC-3′Rv2959C5′-ATGTGGAGAAATGCTCTGCGCC-3′Rv2959D5′-ACGTTCTTCAGGTGGTTCCGG-3′Rv2959E5′-AACTCGCTCAGGATCTCCTGG-3′Rv2959F5′-GGAATGGGGCTAGTGTGGCGC-3′Rv2959G5′-TAGGGTCCAGGCCCAAACCCG-3′Rv2952Rv2952A5′-GCTCTAGAGTTTAAACGACAGATTCCAGCGCCTC-3′Rv2952B5′-GCGAGCTCGTTTAAACGCGCTCCACTAATCGTCG-3′Rv2952C5′-TCCCATTGGATGCTCGACGCC-3′Rv2952D5′-CTCGAAGGTGTAATGGCCCCG-3′Rv2952E5′-CGGCGGATCTTCCTCATAGGC-3′resres15′-GCTCTAGAGCAACCGTCCGAAATATTATAAA-3′res25′-GCTCTAGATCTCATAAAAATGTATCCTAAATCAAATATC-3′ Open table in a new tab Construction of M. tuberculosis H37Rv ΔRv2959c::res Unmarked Mutant—To recover the res-Ωkm-res cassette from M. tuberculosis PMM18, we transferred the plasmid pWM19 containing the resolvase gene of transposon γδ under the control of the mycobacterial promotor pBlaF* into this strain (18Malaga W. Perez E. Guilhot C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2003; 219: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The PMM18:pWM19 transformation mixture was resuspended in 5 ml of 7H9 + albumin-dextrose-catalase and incubated for 48 h at 32 °C to allow the expression of hygromycin resistance. Transformants were selected directly in the liquid medium by adding hygromycin to the transformation mixture and incubating the culture at 32 °C for 12 days. Viable bacteria were then recovered by plating serial dilutions on 7H11 + oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase plates without antibiotics and incubating at 39 °C, a non-permissive temperature for pWM19 replication. Twenty-one colonies picked randomly were then tested for their growth on km-containing plates. Thirteen of these colonies were unable to grow on km-containing plates but grew as the control on antibiotic-free plates. Three of these clones were analyzed by PCR using primers res1 + 2959C, 2959E + 2959C, and 2959F + 2959G. The amplification program consisted of 1 cycle of 10 min at 95 °C followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C,30 s at 55 °C, 3 min at 72 °C, and a final extension of 10 min at 72 °C. The amplification pattern revealed that the res-Ωkm-res cassette had been excised in these three clones, leaving a copy of the 132-bp res site within the Rv2959c gene. One clone, named PMM18res, was retained for further analysis. Disruption of Rv2952 and Rv2959c Genes in M. tuberculosis H37Rv by Allelic Exchange—The biosynthesis of PGL, p-HBAD, and DIM in bacteria of the M. tuberculosis complex involves the transfer of several methyl groups onto the carbohydrate moieties of PGL and p-HBAD and onto the lipid domains of PGL and DIM. This implies that several unknown methyltransferases catalyze these reactions. Previous studies have shown that many genes involved in the biosynthesis of DIM and PGL are clustered on a 70-kilobase fragment of the M. tuberculosis chromosome; that is, the DIM and PGL locus (Fig. 1). Therefore, we looked for ORFs encoding putative proteins with similarities to methyltransferase in this locus. Two such ORFs, Rv2952 and Rv2959c, were identified downstream of pks15/1. Interestingly, the protein encoded by Rv2952, but not that encoded by Rv2959c, harbored an amino acid motif conserved in several other mycobacterial methyltransferases shown to be required for the transfer of methyl groups onto fatty acids (21Jeevarajah D. Patterson J.H. McConville M.J. Billman-Jacobe H. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3079-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that the Rv2959c product is involved in the methylation of the glycosyl moiety of PGL-tb and p-HBAD and that the Rv2952 product methylates the lipid domains of both DIM and PGL-tb. To establish the exact roles of the proteins encoded by Rv2952 and Rv2959c in the biosynthesis of DIM, PGL-tb, and p-HBAD, we constructed two M. tuberculosis H37Rv mutants in which these genes were disrupted by allelic exchange. Briefly, chromosomal fragments overlapping the 5′ or 3′ ends of Rv2952 or Rv2959c were cloned flanking a km resistance cassette into the vector pPR27 (19Pelicic V. Jackson M. Reyrat J.M. Jacobs W.R. Gicquel B. Guilhot C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10955-10960Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) yielding plasmids pPET40 (Rv2959c) and pPET34 (Rv2952). These constructs were independently transferred by electroporation into M. tuberculosis H37Rv. Two transformants obtained with each plasmid were grown in liquid broth at 32 °C until stationary phase and allelic exchange mutants were selected by plating serial dilutions of the cultures on solid medium containing kanamycin and sucrose at 39 °C. PCR analysis of 10 colonies obtained with each construct on the counterselective plates using C + D, C + res2, or E + res1 primers revealed that several clones gave an amplification pattern consistent with an allelic replacement of the wild-type allele of the different genes by the disrupted allele (Fig. 2). Two clones, named PMM18 (ΔRv2959c::km) and PMM28 (ΔRv2952::km), were retained for further studies. Biochemical Phenotypes of Methyltransferase Mutants—To examine the effects of the mutations in the Rv2952 and Rv2959c genes on p-HBAD, DIM, and PGL production, we first transferred the plasmid pPET1 into the H37Rv strain and in the two mutants, PMM18 and PMM28. This plasmid carries a functional pks15/1 gene from M. bovis BCG because the wild-type H37Rv strain is unable to produce PGL-tb due to a frame-shift mutation in pks15/1 (7Constant P. Perez E. Malaga W. Lanéelle M.-A. Saurel O. Daffé M. Guilhot C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38148-38158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The p-HBAD compounds are mostly found in the culture supernatant of the H37Rv strain of M. tuberculosis, whereas DIM and PGL-tb remain associated with the bacterial cells. Therefore, the mutants and the wild-type strain (either transformed with the plasmid pPET1 or not transformed) were grown in liquid culture, and lipids were extracted from both the culture supernatant and the bacterial pellets. TLC analysis of the organic solvent extracts from the culture supernatants obtained with the various strains revealed the presence of one glycoconjugate spot in the lipid extract of H37Rv. It corresponds to the previously described p-HBAD II (tri-O-methyl-fucosyl-(α1→3)-rhamnosyl-(α1→3)-2-O-methyl-rhamnosyl-α-p-hydroxybenzoic acid methyl ester) (7Constant P. Perez E. Malaga W. Lanéelle M.-A. Saurel O. Daffé M. Guilhot C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38148-38158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). This compound is the major p-HBAD produced by M. tuberculosis H37Rv. A minor compound p-HBAD I corresponding to 2-O-methyl-rhamnosyl-α-p-hydroxybenzoic acid methyl ester is sometime visible but was undetectable in this experiment. The same pattern of glycoconjugate production was observed with the PMM28 mutant strain (Fig. 3A). In contrast, no glycoconjugates were detected in the organic-solvent extracts from the PMM18 mutant (Fig. 3A). Hence, the putative methyltransferase encoded by Rv2959c, but not that encoded by Rv2952, plays a role in the biosynthesis of p-HBAD. To determine the roles of the putative methyltransferase in the biosynthesis of PGL-tb, lipids from the bacterial cells were examined. TLC analysis of these lipids showed that the PMM28:pPET1 mutant produced two glycoconjugates, products B and C (Fig. 3B). These molecules have slightly different mobilities to PGL from M. bovis BCG (2-O-methyl-rhamnosylphenolphthiocerol dimycocerosates) and from M. tuberculosis (tri-O-methyl-fucosyl-(α1→3)-rhamnosyl-(α1→3)-2-O-methyl-rhamnosyl-phenolphthiocerol dimycocerosates). In the case of PMM18:pPET1 mutant, a glycoconjugate (product A, Fig. 3B) with a lower mobility than that of PGL-tb was observed. These results strongly suggest that both Rv2952 and Rv2959c are involved in PGL-tb biosynthesis. Because PGL and DIM are structurally related, we investigated the roles of the putative methyltransferases in the biosynthesis of DIM. As expected, the control strain (H37Rv: pPET1) produced both DIM A (phthiocerol dimycocerosates) and DIM B (phthiodiolone dimycocerosate) (Fig. 3B). The mutation in the Rv2959c gene did not affect the production of DIM, as both forms were detected in similar amounts to those found in the wild-type strain (data not shown). In contrast, the mutation in the Rv2952 gene seemed to abolish the synthesis of DIM A completely but did not affect the production of DIM B both in PMM28 and PMM28:pPET1 (Fig. 3C). When large amounts of lipid extracts were loaded on TLC plates, an additional spot (product D) was detected in the organic solvent extracts of PMM28:pPET1 in comparison with that of the wild-type strain. Thus, these preliminary analyses demonstrated that mutations in Rv2959c and Rv2952 affected the production of p-HBAD, PGL-tb, and DIM but in different ways. The protein encoded by Rv2959c seems to be required for the biosynthesis of both p-HBAD and PGL-tb but not DIM, whereas that encoded by Rv2952 appears to be required for the biosynthesis of PGL-tb and DIM A in M. tuberculosis but not p-HBAD. Because p-HBAD and PGL-tb share a common glycosyl-phenolic domain absent from DIM, whereas DIM and PGL-tb exhibit a common lipid domain absent from p-HBAD, these results support our hypothesis, based on the amino acid sequences of the two putative methyltransferases, that the Rv2959c product is involved in the methylation of the glycosyl moiety and that the Rv2952 product is involved in the methylation of the lipid domain. Structural Analysis of the Compounds Accumulated in the M. tuberculosis H37Rv ΔRv2952::km Mutant—The mutations in both genes resulted in the accumulation of new compounds (Fig. 3) that may be biosynthetic intermediates of p-HBAD, PGL-tb, and DIM. To test this hypothesis, we purified these substances by chromatography on Florisil and analyzed them further. First, products B and C, which accumulated in the M. tuberculosis PMM28:pPET1 mutant, were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The spectrum of glycoconjugate B showed a series of pseudomolecular ion (M+Na+) peaks at 1850, 1864, 1878, 1892, 1906, 1920, 1934, 1948, 1962, 1976, 1990, and 2004m/z (Fig. 4B) (the major peaks are underlined). The same peaks were observed in the mass spectrum of the purified PGL-tb from the M. tuberculosis H37Rv:pPET1 strain (Fig. 4A), but the mass values of the major pseudomolecular ion peaks corresponding to glycolipid B from the PMM28:pPET1 mutant were 14 mass units lower than those in the spectrum of PGL-tb. This suggests that the PMM28:pPET1 mutant produces a PGL-like substance that may differ from PGL-tb by the absence of a methyl group. This hypothesis was supported by the 1H NMR analysis of the glycolipid B, which showed that the 1H NMR spectrum of the purified glycoconjugate B from PMM28:pPET1 was very similar to that of PGL-tb (Fig. 5A) (7Constant P.

Two deshielded doublets were observed at 6.97 and 7.10 ppm and corresponded to proton resonances of the phenolic group of PGLs (7Constant P. Perez E. Malaga W. Lanéelle M.-A. Saurel O. Daffé M.

Three anomeric proton resonances were seen in the 1H NMR spectrum of the glycolipid B from PMM28:pPET1 at 5.50 ppm (1H) and 5.15 ppm (2H) (Fig. 5A). Their chemical shift values were identical to those of PGL-tb (7Constant P. Perez E. Malaga W. Lanéelle M.-A. Saurel O. Daffé M. Guilhot C. J. Biol.

In addition, four singlets were observed in the region of the resonances of sugar-linked methoxyl (OCH3) protons at 3.5–3.7 ppm. Again, the chemical shift values of the methoxyl proton resonances of product B (Fig. 5A) were identical to those found located on the trisaccharide portion of PGL-tb (7Constant P. Perez E. Malaga W.

The occurrence of polymethylenic (CH2) units in the glycolipid was deduced from the presence of a broad signal resonance at 1.25 ppm. The resonances of the expected terminal methyl (CH3) protons were observed at 0.8–1.0 ppm, whereas those attributable to methyl branches located on carbons 2 of fatty acyl residues were seen at 1.14 ppm. The resonance of the methine (CH) proton of the esterified β-glycol was seen at 4.83 ppm (Fig. 5A, signal a).

The principal end product of IPP metabolism in higher animals is cholesterol, and in bacteria, end products include the lipid carrier undecaprenol, involved in cell wall biosynthesis (3Reusch V.M.

Mammals and archaea possess only the mevalonate pathway for IPP biosynthesis, whereas both pathways occur amongst plants. Among pathogenic bacteria, the low G+C Gram-positive cocci possess genes that encode for enzymes of the mevalonate pathway and are essential for the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae (7Wilding E.I.

The best characterized enzyme of the mevalonate pathway in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes is 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, and crystal structures have been solved for both human (10Istvan E.S.

The eukaryotic HMG-CoA reductase is the target of the statin class of cholesterol-lowering agents (12Eisenberg D.A. Am. J. Med. 1998; 104: 25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Prokaryotic HMG-CoA reductases are over 4 orders of magnitude less sensitive to inhibition by these drugs (13Hedl M. Sutherlin A. Wilding E.I. Mazzulla M. McDevitt D. Lane P. Burgner J.W.

Thus the pathway represents a potential target for antibacterial agents against life-threatening, multidrug-resistant Gram-positive cocci. HMG-CoA synthase (EC 4.1.3.5) is the enzyme preceding HMG-CoA reductase in the mevalonate pathway (Fig. 1). HMG-CoA synthase catalyzes the biological Claisen condensation of acetyl-CoA with acetoacetyl-CoA and is a member of a superfamily of acyl-condensing enzymes that includes β-ketothiolases, fatty acid synthases (β-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase), and polyketide synthases. All members of the superfamily use a cysteine as a nucleophile and shuttle reaction intermediates through CoA molecules (14Palmer M.A. Differding E. Gamboni R. Williams S.F. Peoples O.P. Walsh C.T.

Despite low sequence homology, the overall structures of these condensing enzymes are conserved, displaying a common fold with a highly structured α/β motif and extended loop regions. However, significant differences in the structure of the active sites are apparent, reflecting substrate and mechanistic differences and suggesting functional divergence. The amino acid sequences of the staphylococcal and streptococcal HMG-CoA synthases are well conserved (44% identity), although the Gram-positive enzymes exhibit little identity (20%) with those of human and avian HMG-CoA synthases. Despite the low overall identity, the amino acid residues involved in the acetylation and condensation reactions are conserved among bacterial and eukaryotic HMG-CoA synthases. In common with other members of this superfamily, kinetic, protein chemistry, and spectroscopic studies of native and site-directed mutants of the mammalian HMG-CoA synthase suggested the involvement of a cysteine residue in the acyl transfer from the carrier CoA to the carbonyl acceptor (16Vinarov D.A.

The role of the cysteine residue is well established on the basis of mechanistic evidence, although no direct structural data from an HMG-CoA synthase from any organism have been reported. In this report, we show that the mvaS gene product from S. aureus (43.2 kDa) is an HMG-CoA synthase and report the three-dimensional crystal structure of the full-length homodimeric enzyme complexed with acetoacetyl-CoA. The structure provides the molecular basis for a potential reaction mechanism and provides insight to aid rational drug design. Cloning and Overexpression of S. aureus HMG-CoA Synthase—The HMG-CoA synthase gene (mvaS) was amplified from S. aureus WCUH29 genomic DNA (NCIMB 40771) using Pwo polymerase (Roche Applied Science) and ligated into pET28a(+) (Novagen) that had been digested with NcoI and EcoRI and dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase. The insert was sequenced to confirm that no errors were introduced during amplification, and the recombinant plasmid, pET-MvaS, was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). Protein Purification—E. coli harboring pET-MvaS were grown to mid-log phase and induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were lysed, and insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation. Ammonium sulfate was added to the soluble fraction to 70% saturation, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was concentrated and applied to a Mono Q column, and bound protein was eluted with a 0–1 m NaCl linear gradient. Fractions containing HMG-CoA synthase activity (0.30–0.35 m NaCl) were pooled, determined to be >95% pure by SDS-PAGE, and stored in 20 mm triethanolamine-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 50% glycerol at -20 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford dye binding assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. N-terminal sequencing was performed at the GlaxoSmithKline Protein Core Facility. Steady-state Kinetics—HMG-CoA synthase activity was assayed spectrophotometrically by monitoring the acetyl-CoA-dependent rate of acetoacetyl-CoA depletion at 300 nm. An extinction coefficient of 7,200 m-1 cm-1 was calculated by an end point assay, which reflects the amount of acetoacetyl-CoA in the enolate form in the presence of 20 mm MgCl2. This compares with a value of 13,600 m-1 cm-1 calculated previously (19Miziorko H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 110: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Reactions were performed in 100 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, containing 0.1 mm EDTA using a Spectramax Plus (Molecular Devices) spectrophotometer. Kinetic data were fit to the appropriate rate equations by using the nonlinear regression function of SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific). Individual saturation curves were fit to Equation 1 to determine the kinetic parameters (V and V/K) for the substrates.υ=VA/(K+A)(eq.1) Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals of HMG-CoA synthase were grown by the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method using a protein solution containing 10 mg ml-1 of HMG-CoA synthase in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm dithiothreitol with or without 15 mm acetoacetyl-CoA. Optimal crystallization conditions were 1.6–2.4 m ammonium sulfate and 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0. At lower ammonium sulfate concentrations, long hexagonal rods grew to 0.1 × 0.1 × 0.5 mm and were space group P6522. At the higher concentration range of ammonium sulfate, the crystals grew to 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.1 mm and were space group P21. The hexagonal crystals were more stable, diffracted to 2-Å resolution, and were used for initial structure determination. The P21 crystal form diffracted to 2.5-Å resolution and were sensitive to handling. However, it was found that only the monoclinic crystals contained acetoacetyl-CoA in the structure. For data collection, crystals were soaked in 2.4 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 25% (v/v) glycerol for a few seconds and then frozen at -160 °C. Data sets were collected on a Rigaku RU200 rotating anode with an Raxis IV x-ray detector or were collected at the Advanced Photon Source, beamline 17-ID (Industrial Macromolecular Crystallography Association Collaborative Access Team).

These crystals did not show any platinum binding, but the space group and unit cell were altered. Therefore the K2PtCl4 crystals were treated as the initial native data set for phasing. A second crystal was soaked in 1 mm K2PtCl4 for 24 h, and then 1 mm UO2Ac2 was added to the reservoir for soaking overnight. The uranium data were collected on a rotating anode and at the APS to take advantage of the different x-ray absorption properties of uranium with respect to x-ray energy. Initial heavy atom positions were found by inspection, confirmed by using SOLVE (21Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar), and refined using MLPHARE (22Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Model Building and Refinement—The solvent-flattened electron density map was used to build a model in the program O (24Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

The monoclinic form of HMG-CoA synthase containing the cofactor was solved via molecular replacement with the program AMORE (26Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Further refinement was completed with REFMAC5 (27Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 53: 240-255Crossref Scopus (13914) Google Scholar). The figures were made with PhotoShop (Adobe), ISIS/Draw (MDL Information Systems, Inc), Molscript (28Kraulis P.J. J. Appl.

DeLano Scientific LLC, San Carlos, CA2003Google Scholar). Coordinates—The coordinates have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (accession codes for apoHMG-CoA synthase and acetoacetyl-CoA-HMG-CoA synthase are 1TVZ and 1TXT, respectively). Cloning and Isolation of S. aureus HMG-CoA Synthase—Induction of the mvaS gene of S. aureus cloned into pET28a(+) resulted in the expression of the gene product to ∼30% of total soluble protein. Typical yields were 7.5 mg of over 95% homogenous protein/liter of induced culture. HMG-CoA synthase purifies as a homodimer with molecular weight of 86000 Daltons (388 amino acid residues/monomer). Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis indicated that the purified protein had a molecular weight of 43,077, which was within the limits of error to the expected mass of 43,073 for the full-length protein minus the N-terminal methionine residue. Certain preparations of the protein had a mass of 32 Da greater than expected, consistent with structural observations showing that the active site cysteine residue contained two additional oxygen atoms and with the observation that the protein over time lost catalytic activity. Steady-state Kinetics—S. aureus HMG-CoA synthase exhibits activity exclusively with acetyl-CoA as the acyl group donor and acetoacetyl-CoA as the substrates. The Michaelis-Menten constants determined for acetyl-CoA and acetoacetyl-CoA have values of 350 ± 50 and 3 ± 1 μm with a kcat of 0.50 ± 0.02 s-1. Additional experiments show that acyl-CoA substrates larger than two carbon units do not enzymatically condense with acetoacetyl-CoA. Three-dimensional Structure Determination and Description—The purified enzyme crystallized in two space groups (P6522 or P21). The P6522 crystal form contained two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Upon soaking these crystals in K2PtCl4 to find derivatives, the c axis was halved, and the space group was changed to P6422 with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The P21 crystal form contained four molecules in the asymmetric unit and was more sensitive to handling. Since no platinum heavy atom sites were found in the P6422 crystals, the data had been collected to 2.0-Å resolution, and the uranium data set was isomorphous, these crystals were treated as native during the structure solution with the result that only one polypeptide needed to be built and refined. The 2.0-Å resolution apoenzyme model of HMG-CoA synthase was determined in space group P6422 using heavy atom isomorphous replacement anomalous scattering and solvent flattening (Table I). The hexagonal model contained one complete polypeptide chain with the noncrystallographic 2-fold parallel to the crystallographic c axis and 198 water molecules. The P21 structure was determined by molecular replacement and includes two complete homodimers, four acetoacetyl-CoA molecules, and 388 water molecules. Only the P21 crystal form contained acetoacetyl-CoA in the active site. The overall structure of the P6422 form was identical to that of the P21 form with the exception of the substrate in the active site. HMG-CoA synthase forms a homodimer of two 43.2-kDa polypeptides (388 residues/monomer) related by a 2-fold axis and forms a rectangular box shape with the approximate dimensions 56 × 63 × 78 Å (Fig. 2). Electron density for acetoacetyl-CoA was visible within each monomer and defined the active site. Each HMG-CoA synthase monomer consists of two structural regions referred to as the upper and lower regions. The upper region is built around a five-layered core structure, α-β-α-β-α, where each α comprises two α-helices and each β is a mixed β-sheet. This core structure contains an obvious internal duplication of two similar α/β motifs. β1, β4, β5, β6, β7, α3, α5, and α6 define one half, and β9, β12, β13, β14, α7, α8, and α10 define the second half of the core. These two parts can be optimally superimposed by considering 77 equivalent residues to give a root mean square deviation of 2.2 Å on Cα-atoms. The lower region is defined by a three-stranded β-sheet (β2, β3, β15), two two-stranded β-sheets (β10 and β11 and β16 and β17, respectively), and three helices, α1, α2, and α12. The lower region does not contain any substructure or pseudo-symmetry. However, the interface of the upper and lower regions defines the acetoacetyl-CoA-binding site. The monomers form an extensive interface, as indicated by the large surface area of ∼2580 Å2 that is buried upon formation of the dimer. Several extensive monomer-monomer interactions can be defined. A major interaction is through strand β5, which interacts with β5 of the other monomer to form a 10-stranded β-sheet in the dimer. Arg-103 of strand β5 extends across the dimer interface to form a salt bridge to Glu-312 of strand β14. The C-terminal portion of α6 interacts with its symmetry mate to further define the dimer interface by a salt bridge between Asp-123 and Arg-128. Other Condensing Enzymes—The pseudo-symmetric motif of the core structure within the upper region was originally observed in thiolase (9Mathieu M. Zeelen J.P. Pauptit R.A. Erdmann R. Kunau W.H. Wierenga R.K. Structure. 1994; 2: 797-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This core structure is also seen in chalcone synthase (32Ferrer J.L. Jez J.M. Bowman M.E. Dixon R.A. Noel J.P. Nature Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) and fatty acid β-ketoacyl-ACP synthases I, II, and III (KAS I, II, and III) (33Olsen J.G.

The upper region of HMG-CoA synthase and KAS III (E. coli FabH) can be superimposed with a root mean square deviation of 1.8 Å for 265 equivalent Cα atoms, implying a common evolutionary origin. A structure-based sequence alignment shows that the catalytic triad Cys, His, and Asn is part of the conserved core structure and provides for the first step common to the respective reactions. The respective lower regions show the highest differences among the condensing enzymes. These differences primarily result from large amino acid insertions at various points in the respective proteins. HMG-CoA synthase has 67 amino acids at the C terminus; chalcone synthase has a 36-amino-acid insert near the N terminus, and thiolase has a 100-amino-acid insert near the middle. No large inserts and having the smallest lower region structure distinguish FabH. Active Site and Mechanism—The interface of the upper and lower regions defines an active site tunnel, which is long (∼13 Å) and narrow, suitable for substrate binding. The tunnel is the binding site for acetyl-CoA, the first substrate. After CoA release, acetoacetyl-CoA, the second substrate, occupies the tunnel. The well defined electron density of acetoacetyl-CoA occupying the tunnel allows the characterization of important residues for substrate binding and catalysis (Fig. 2). At the tunnel entrance, Lys-32, Lys-202, Lys-242, and Lys-238 form interactions with the phosphates of acetoacetyl-CoA. Asp-29 within helix α2 forms a hydrogen bond to the amine group of the adenosine moiety. One side of the adenosine packs against the face of helix α2; the opposite side of adenosine is solvent-exposed. Van der Waals contacts dominate the majority of interactions between the pantothenate unit of CoA and the enzyme. Deep into the tunnel, the active site is seen to contain important residues: Glu-79, Cys-111, Tyr-143, Asp-184, Phe-185, His-233, Asn-275, Tyr-305, Gly-306, Ser-307, and ordered water molecules. (Fig. 4). Overall, the mechanism of HMG-CoA synthase consists of three steps occurring via a ping-pong mechanism: first, the acylation of a cysteine by acetyl-CoA; second, the Claison condensation of acetyl-Cys with acetoacetyl-CoA; and finally, the release of HMG-CoA from the enzyme. The upper region acts as a scaffold holding the key residues in position for the first step of the reaction, which is common to all condensing enzymes: the acetylation of a Cys residue. In HMG-CoA synthase, Cys-111 sits at the bottom of the tunnel and provides the essential thiol group in the enzymatic reaction for HMG-CoA synthase. The electron density shows oxidation of the sulfhydryl of Cys-111 to sulfinic acid (-SO2H) during the crystallization. However, this oxidatation does allow for the trapping of acetoacetyl-CoA in the active site. Cys-111, His-233, and Asn-275 form a triad similar to that found in FabH and chalcone synthase (Fig. 3). His-233 and Asn-275 flank Cys-111. In the thiolase structure, the Asn and His are swapped spatially (Figs. 3b and 4). His-233 is positioned to act as a base activating Cys-111 that can then initiate the acetyl transfer by a nucleophilic attack at the carbonyl carbon of acetyl-CoA. As in the other condensing enzymes, the acetylation occurs via a tetrahedral intermediate and is stabilized by residues in the active site. A functional survey of invariant acidic residues identified Asp-83, Asp-139, and Asp-184 as important in acetyl-S-enzyme formation, which involves the formation and directed collapse of a tetrahedral adduct (36Chun K.Y. Vinarov D.A. Miziorko H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14670-14681Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The crystal structure shows that these residues are directly or indirectly a part of the active site. Only Asp-184 is involved in stabilizing the adduct; the other two aspartates are important to maintaining the tertiary structure of the protein. Asp-184 interacts with Ser-307 through hydrogen-bonding interactions to the hydroxyl group of Ser-307 and the amide proton of Gly-308. The backbone amide proton of Gly-308 and the hydroxyl group of Ser-307 define an oxyanion-stabilizing hole for the carbonyl oxygen of acetyl-CoA during the tetrahedral intermediate. Ser-307 is part of a β-turn located between strands, β13 and β14, that contains a cis peptide between Gly-308 and Ser-309. Asp-184 is also important in stabilizing the cis peptide. Asp-139 and Asp-83 are buried and form hydrogen bonds to the amide backbone hydrogen of residues Glu-79 and Arg-187, respectively, providing important interactions to maintain the structural integrity of the enzyme and not a part of the oxyanion hole. The subsequent enzymatic step diverges significantly in the different acyl-condensing enzymes. In HMG-CoA synthase, the acetylated cysteine acts as a nucleophile and attacks the second substrate. This Claisen condensation is significantly different from that seen in KAS enzymes, in which the second substrate acts as a nucleophile by releasing CO2 and attacks the acetylated cysteine residues of the KAS enzymes. In addition to being involved in the acylation of Cys-111, the invariant histidine (S. aureus His-233) appears to be important in binding of acetoacetyl CoA. As seen in the crystal structure, the penultimate carbonyl of acetoacetyl-CoA is within hydrogen-bonding distance to His-233 (Fig. 4). The end carbonyl of acetoacetyl-CoA is difficult to place due to poor electron density. The invariant Tyr-143 would suggest that it is in a position to hydrogen-bond to the end carbonyl of acetoacetyl-CoA, holding the second substrate in place. However, mutagenesis of the corresponding tyrosine in the avian enzyme (Y163L) did not show a significant decrease in the catalytic activity (37Misra I. Wang C.Z. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26443-26449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Also, the product stereochemistry would require the end carbonyl to be pointing away from Tyr-143. The invariant Glu-79 has been shown in the avian enzyme (Glu-95) to act as a general acid/base in the condensation reaction. Glu-79 is in an ideal position to act as a base and activate the acyl group of Cys-111 for a nucleophilic attack upon acetoacetyl-CoA, creating the HMG-CoA enzyme complex. The presence of structured water around the active site suggests that the release of HMG-CoA from the enzyme occurs via hydrolysis by the ordered water molecules. Based on our structure, additional mutagenesis and biochemical experiments can be proposed to test these models and further probe the mechanism. In addition, the structure of HMG-CoA synthase will facilitate the structure-based design of alternative drugs to cholesterol-lowering therapies or to novel antibiotics to the Gram-positive cocci. Crystallization efforts on human HMG-CoA synthase have been unsuccessful, whereas the S. aureus HMG-CoA synthase readily crystallizes and will prove useful for drug development against a different enzyme in the mevalonate pathway.

Previously, we have demonstrated that hypertonic shock causes a rapid inhibition of protein synthesis, the disaggregation of polysomes, the dephosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF)4E, 4E-BP1, and ribosomal protein S6, and increased association of 4E-BP1 with eIF4E. The return of cells to isotonic medium promotes a transient activation of Erk1/2 and the phosphorylation of initiation factors, promoting an increase in protein synthesis that is independent of a requirement for eIF4E phosphorylation. As de novo translation is associated with the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, we have investigated the role of the signaling pathways required for this event by the use of cell-permeable inhibitors. Surprisingly, although rapamycin, RAD001, wortmannin, and LY294002 inhibited the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and its release from eIF4E, they did not prevent the recovery of translation rates. These data suggest that only a small proportion of the available eIF4F complex is required for maximal translation rates under these conditions. Similarly, prevention of Erk1/2 activity alone with low concentrations of PD184352 did not impinge upon de novo translation until later times of recovery from salt shock. However, U0126, which prevented the phosphorylation of Erk1/2, ribosomal protein S6, TSC2, and 4E-BP1, attenuated de novo protein synthesis in recovering cells. These results indicate that the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 is mediated by both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent rapamycin-sensitive and Erk1/2-dependent signaling pathways and that activation of either pathway in isolation is sufficient to promote de novo translation.

Mammalian mRNAs have a unique cap structure at their 5′ terminus, which has a strong stimulatory effect on the translation of mRNA. The cap structure facilitates the recruitment of eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) 1The abbreviations used are: eIF, eukaryotic translation initiation factor; BP, binding protein; PABP, poly(A)-binding protein; PI3, phosphatidylinositol 3; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; TCA, trichloroacetic acid. to the mRNA to allow ribosome binding and initiation at the correct start site (reviewed in Refs. 1Gingras A.C.

Current models suggest that hypophosphorylated 4E-BP1 binds to eIF4E to inhibit cap-dependent translation, a process readily reversed following 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. The dissociation of hyperphosphorylated 4E-BP1 from eIF4E permits the binding of eIF4G to eIF4E and the initiation of protein synthesis. Recent work has suggested a role for the hamartin-tuberin complex (TSC1-TSC2) in the regulation of mTOR activity (19Tee A.R. Manning B.D. Roux P.P. Cantley L.C. Blenis J. Curr.

TSC2, a GTPase-activating protein, has activity toward the Ras family small GTPase, Rheb (Ras homolog enriched in brain), which promotes mTOR signaling by an ill-defined mechanism. TSC1/2 antagonizes the mTOR signaling pathway by stimulating the hydrolysis of GTP associated with Rheb (23Li Y. Corradetti M.N. Inoki K. Guan K.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 32-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) thereby reducing its activity. Thus, TSC1/2 and Rheb have pivotal roles in mediating growth factors, nutrient, and energy sensing signals to mTOR-dependent targets (19Tee A.R. Manning B.D. Roux P.P. Cantley L.C. Blenis J. Curr.

PI3-kinase-dependent signaling serves to inhibit the TSC1-TSC2 complex through direct Akt-mediated phosphorylation of tuberin at Ser-939 and Thr-1462, relieving the inhibitory activity of the complex on Rheb. In addition, it has been demonstrated recently that the protein kinase C-induced extracellular-signal regulated kinase pathway can also modulate the phosphorylation of tuberin at Thr-1462 (19Tee A.R.

Exposure of mammalian cells to hypertonic stress is a very effective means of inducing a transient fall in protein synthesis, which is rapidly reversible upon restoration of isotonic medium (27Novoa I. Carrasco L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2445-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 28Morley S.J. Naegele S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32855-32859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Because polysomes become completely disaggregated during hypertonic stress, the resumption of translation during recovery represents de novo recruitment of mRNA. We have used this system as a tool to study the function of the eIF4F complex during de novo recruitment of mRNA in intact cells and to demonstrate that eIF4E phosphorylation is not required for de novo protein synthesis (28Morley S.J. Naegele S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32855-32859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Here we have employed hypertonic stress and cell-permeable inhibitors to investigate the signaling pathways involved in de novo translation. Our findings indicate that although inhibition of mTOR activity during recovery prevented the hyperphosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and its release from eIF4E, it did not prevent the restoration of translation rates. Furthermore, prevention of the transient activation of Erk1/2 with PD184352 did not impinge upon translation rates during the recovery phase. However, U0126 (which prevented Erk1/2 activity, S6 phosphorylation, TSC2 phosphorylation, and the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1) attenuated the restoration of translation rates in recovering cells. Our results, therefore, provide evidence that the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 following hypertonic shock is mediated by both mTOR-dependent, and Erk1/2-dependent signaling pathways and that inhibition of both pathways is required to prevent de novo translation.

Polysome Analysis—Cells were isolated as described above and lysed by vortexing in 200 μl Buffer B (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 40 mm sodium fluoride, 80 mm KCl, 7 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm benzamidine, 2 mm MgCl2, 200 μg/ml cycloheximide, 0.5% (by volume) Igepal and deoxycholate). Extracts were fractionated on 15–50% (w/v) sucrose gradients in 20 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2 for 75 min at 42,000 rpm in a Beckman SW50.1 rotor at 4 °C and were visualized with an ISCO UA6 fractionator (28Morley S.J. Naegele S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32855-32859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). p70S6K Assays—Immunocomplex kinase assays for p70S6K were carried out as described previously using 40 S ribosomal subunits as substrate (33Lane H.A. Morley S.J. Dorée M. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1743-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 34Morley S.J. Pain V.M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1751-1760PubMed Google Scholar). Quantification of Data—In all cases, care was taken to ensure that detection of endogenous proteins was within the linear range of the response to the individual antisera. Quantification of the phosphorylation of the endogenous proteins was carried out either using a Storm PhosphorImager and Imagequant software (Amersham Biosciences) or by densitometric scanning of immunoblots using a Uvitec gel documentation scanner and UVIsoft image acquisition and analysis software (Uvitec). In all cases, phosphorylation of the endogenous proteins was adjusted for total protein using the appropriate loading control as indicated in the individual figures, and statistical analysis was carried out using GraphPad Prism 4 software. Recovery of Protein Synthesis Rates following Salt Stress Is Associated with the Activation of Multiple Signaling Pathways—Exposure of mammalian cells to hypertonic stress induces a transient fall in protein synthesis that is rapidly reversible upon restoration of isotonic medium (Fig. 1A). Whereas the integrity of eIF4G is critical for the re-programming of translation during recovery from hypertonic stress (27Novoa I. Carrasco L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2445-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), our previous data have shown that increased phosphorylation of eIF4E at Ser-209 is not obligatory (28Morley S.J. Naegele S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32855-32859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In this work, we have employed hypertonic stress and cell-permeable inhibitors to investigate the role of individual signaling pathways for de novo translation in 293 cells. Fig. 1B (lane 2 versus lane 1) shows that salt shock induces a dephosphorylation and the inactivation of a number of signaling intermediates that impinge upon the translational machinery, including components of the mTOR (Akt, TSC2, ribosomal protein S6, and 4E-BP1) and the Erk pathways (MEK1/2 and Erk1/2). Under these conditions, dephosphorylation of a key phosphorylation site in 4E-BP1 (Ser-65) was complete within 15 min, whereas that of eIF4G (Ser-1108), Akt (Ser-473), S6 (Thr-421/Ser-424), and eIF4E (Ser-209, (28Morley S.J. Naegele S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32855-32859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar)) occurred at a slower rate and were maximal at 60 min (data not shown and lane 2 versus lane 1). There was no change in the overall levels of initiation factors recovered in the extracts after this time and (in agreement with published data) little change in the phosphorylation status of eIF2α ((28Morley S.J. Naegele S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32855-32859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and data not shown). In contrast, salt shock promotes an increase in the phosphorylation (and activity) of p38 MAP kinase (Fig. 1B, lane 2 versus lane 1). Concomitant with a recovery of translation rates (Fig. 1A), returning cells to isotonic medium promotes a transient phosphorylation (and activation) of MEK1/2, with Erk1/2 phosphorylation being more persistent (Fig. 1B, quantified in the lower panel). MEK1/2 phosphorylation was evident within 10 min and decreased to basal levels after 20 min of recovery (lanes 2–5). In contrast, release from salt stress promotes a more sustained phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 1B, lower panel), S6, and 4E-BP1 (upper panel, lanes 3–8), along with a gradual inactivation of p38MAPK (lanes 2–8). Using a more detailed time course (Fig. 1C, quantified in the lower panel), we have determined that the phosphorylation of eIF4G and 4E-BP1 is detectable within 5–10 min of returning cells to isotonic medium. The phosphorylation of eIF4E is evident at 10 min of recovery at a time when translation rates are increased (Fig. 1A). 4E-BP1 Phosphorylation Is Not Required for the Recovery of Translation Rates following Hypertonic Shock—Association of 4E-BPs with eIF4E is modulated by phosphorylation events controlled via the mTOR signaling pathway (1Gingras A.C.

Current models suggest that hypophosphorylated 4E-BP1 binds to eIF4E to inhibit cap-dependent translation, a process readily reversed following 4E-BP1 phosphorylation (1Gingras A.C. Raught B.

To investigate the role of the PI3-kinase and mTOR pathways in recovery from salt shock, cells were incubated with wortmannin or rapamycin, respectively, during the last 20 min of salt treatment and throughout the recovery period and extracts prepared. SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 2A) shows that as expected wortmannin (lanes 6–8 versus lanes 3–5) but not rapamycin (lanes 9–11 versus lanes 3–5) prevents the phosphorylation of Akt on recovery in isotonic medium. However, whereas both inhibitors abrogate the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 and 4E-BP1 (lanes 6–11 versus lanes 3–5), consistent with a role for PI3-kinase and mTOR in signaling to these target proteins (18Blenis J.

https://openalex.org/W1963533732,"Tumor cell binding to components of the basement membrane is well known to trigger intracellular signaling pathways. Signaling ultimately results in the modulation of gene expression, facilitating metastasis. Type IV collagen is the major structural component of the basement membrane and is known to be a polyvalent ligand, possessing sequences bound by the α1β1, α2β1, and α3β1 integrins, as well as cell surface proteoglycan receptors, such as CD44/chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG). The role of α2β1 integrin and CD44/CSPG receptor binding on human melanoma cell activation has been evaluated herein using triple-helical peptide ligands incorporating the α1(IV)382–393 and α1(IV)1263–1277 sequences, respectively. Gene expression and protein production of matrix metalloproteinases-1 (MMP-1), -2, -3, -13, and -14 were modulated with the α2β1-specific sequence, whereas the CD44-specific sequence yielded significant stimulation of MMP-8 and lower levels of modulation of MMP-1, -2, -13, and -14. Analysis of enzyme activity confirmed different melanoma cell proteolytic potentials based on engagement of either the α2β1 integrin or CD44/CSPG. These results are indicative of specific activation events that tumor cells undergo upon binding to select regions of basement membrane collagen.

Melanoma is one of the most rapidly increasing malignancies in the world in both young and old patients, with over 50,000 newly diagnosed patients each year (1Nickoloff B.J. Nickoloff B.J. Methods in Molecular Medicine: Melanoma Techniques and Protocols. 61. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 3-14Google Scholar). 1See also www.cancer.org/docroot/STT/stt_0.asp. Mortality from cancer is frequently due to metastasis, given that surgical excision of the primary tumor considerably enhances the prognosis of a patient and prolongs survival (2Mizejewski G.J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1999; 222: 124-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Metastasis is a complex series of finely coordinated events that results in cancer cells circulating in lymph and blood vascular systems to invade remote tissues and establish secondary sites of tumor growth (3Bogenrieder T. Herlyn M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6524-6536Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Extravasation of the tumor cell into secondary tissues requires alterations in cellular behaviors, resulting from specific adhesion to components of the basement membrane. Tumor cells respond to each of the various components of the ECM, 2The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; ADAMTS, adisintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs; α1(V)436–447 fTHP, (Gly-Pro-Hyp)5-Gly-Pro-Lys(Mca)-Gly-Pro-Pro-Gly∼Val-Val-Gly-Glu-Lys(Dnp)-Gly-Glu-Gln-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)5-NH2; CS, chondroitin sulfate; CSPG, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan; Dnp, 2,4-dinitrophenyl; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; fTHP-4, (Gly-Pro-Hyp)5-Gly-Pro-Lys(Mca)-Gly-Pro-Gln-Gly∼Leu-Arg-Gly-Gln-Lys(Dnp)-Gly-Val-Arg-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)5-NH2; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; HA, hyaluronic acid; Mca, (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase(s); PBS, phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4; SSP, single-stranded peptide; THP, triple-helical peptide; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; mAb, monoclonal antibody; RT, reverse transcriptase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. including the collagens; noncollagenous glycoproteins, such as fibronectin and laminin; and proteoglycans, such as decorin and syndecan (4Faassen A.E. Drake S.L. Iida J. Knutson J.R. McCarthy J.B. Adv. Pathol. Lab. Med. 1992; 5: 229-259Google Scholar). These interactions are known to occur through several families of cell surface receptors, including the integrins and cell surface proteoglycans. Integrins are heterodimeric proteins composed of one α and one β subunit and are the best described of the cell surface adhesion molecules. To date, there are 18 different α subunits and 8 distinct β subunits identified that combine to form at least 24 heterodimers (5van der Flier A. Sonnenberg A. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 305: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, 6Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6955) Google Scholar, 7Shimaoka M. Springer T.A. Nat. Rev. Drug Discovery. 2003; 2: 703-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Although the specific integrin expression profile can fluctuate with tumor type and stage of progression, highly metastatic melanoma cells are known to up-regulate expression of α1β1, α2β1, α3β1, α4β1, α5β1, αvβ3, and α6β4 integrins while down-regulating the expression of other integrins (2Mizejewski G.J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1999; 222: 124-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 8Plantefaber L.C. Hynes R.O. Cell. 1989; 56: 281-290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Integrins are frequently capable of recognizing more than one ligand from the ECM; in turn, ECM components such as collagen and fibronectin are known to bind several different integrins. Ligand binding by integrins triggers a series of intracellular signaling events that ultimately result in the release of cytokines and proteases. Increased proteolysis eventually results in basement membrane degradation, liberation of cell surface receptors, and cytokine activation, all of which are often beneficial for tumor cell progression (9Alessandro R. Kohn E.C. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 2002; 19: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The collagen-binding integrins include α1β1, α2β1, α3β1, α10β1, and α11β1 (10Kramer R.H. Marks N. J.

More precisely, the α1β1 and α2β1 integrins are up-regulated in metastatic melanoma, whereas the α3β1 integrin is up-regulated in both primary and metastatic melanoma (2Mizejewski G.J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1999; 222: 124-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 17Klein C.E. Dressel D. Steinmayer T. Mauch C. Eckes B. Krieg T. Bankert R.B. Weber L. J.

The collagen-binding integrins have numerous roles in melanoma progression. For example, the α2β1 integrin is the primary melanoma cell adhesion molecule for type IV collagen and is used to contract and remodel type I collagen (17Klein C.E. Dressel D. Steinmayer T. Mauch C. Eckes B. Krieg T. Bankert R.B. Weber L. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 20Schön M. Schön M.P. Kuhröber A. Schirmbeck R. Kaufmann R. Klein C.E. J.

Cell. 1996; 7: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The α2β1 integrin also participates in migration of metastatic melanoma on type IV collagen (22Etoh T. Thomas L. Pastel-Levy C. Colvin R.B. Mihm Jr., M.C. Byers H.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 100: 640-647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The α2β1 integrin up-regulates the α isoform of p38 MAPK in a three-dimensional collagen matrix, resulting in stimulation of MMP-13 and type I collagen synthesis (23Heino J. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Engagement of the α2β1 integrin has also been linked to induction of MMP-1 and MMP-14 (24Riikonen T. Westermarck J.

Furthermore, MMP-1 binds to the α2β1 integrin via the I domain of the α2 subunit (27Stricker T.P. Dumin J.A. Dickeson S.K. Chung L. Nagase H. Parks W.C. Santoro S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29375-29381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The cell surface proteoglycans are a second class of receptors implicated in tumor metastasis. Melanoma cells have been shown to possess at least two distinct cell surface chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, CD44 and the melanoma-associated proteoglycan/melanoma chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (4Faassen A.E. Drake S.L. Iida J. Knutson J.R. McCarthy J.B. Adv. Pathol. Lab. Med. 1992; 5: 229-259Google Scholar, 28Iida J. Meijne A.M.L. Knutson J.R. Furcht L.T. McCarthy J.B. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1996; 7: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). CD44 binds directly to type IV collagen, and this binding is dependent upon chondroitin sulfate (CS) (21Knutson J.R. Iida J. Fields G.B. McCarthy J.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In general, melanoma cell invasion of the basement membrane is inhibited by the selective removal of the CS (21Knutson J.R. Iida J. Fields G.B. McCarthy J.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The nonspliced variant of CD44, CD44s (also known as CD44H), is the sole form of CD44 expressed by human melanoma cells (29Ranuncolo S.M. Ladeda V. Gorostidy S. Morandi A. Varela M. Lastiri J. Loria D. del Aguila R. de Kier Joffé E.B. Pallotta G. Puricelli L. Oncol. Rep. 2002; 9: 51-56PubMed Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that CD44s plays an important role in melanoma progression. Up-regulation of CD44s mRNA transcription and cell surface expression has been found in highly metastatic melanoma as compared with lowly metastatic melanoma or nontransformed melanocytes (29Ranuncolo S.M.

Enhanced expression of CD44s is also found in endothelial cells within the vasculature of tumors compared with endothelial cells from normal tissue (33Griffioen A.W. Coenen M.J.H. Damen C.A. Hellwig S.M.M. van Weering D.H.J. Vooys W. Blijham G.H. Groenewegen G. Blood. 1997; 90: 1150-1159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection of CD44 isolated from metastatic cells into nonmetastatic tumor cells results in conferment of metastatic behavior (34Naor D. Slonov R.V. Ish-Shalom D. Vande Woude G.F. Klein G. Adv. Cancer Res.71. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1997: 241-319Google Scholar). In addition, tumor cells expressing CD44s display accelerated tumor growth and metastatic spread in immunodeficient mice compared with parental cells (34Naor D. Slonov R.V. Ish-Shalom D. Vande Woude G.F. Klein G. Adv. Cancer Res.71. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1997: 241-319Google Scholar), whereas a knockout of the CD44 gene virtually eliminates metastasis in mice (35Weber G.F. Bronson R.T. Hagan J. Cantor H. Schmits R. Mak T.W. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2281-2286PubMed Google Scholar). Approaches that interfere with CD44 binding to its ligand, such as administration of high molecular weight hyaluronic acid (HA), anti-CD44 mAb, or a CD44-receptor globulin, reduce tumor formation in the lung for animal models established from CD44-expressing tumor cell lines (36Eliaz R.E. Szoka J.F.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2592-2601PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, proteolytic removal of CD44 inhibits the growth of primary tumors and curtails metastasis in a mouse B16 melanoma model (37Wald M. Olejár T. Sebková V. Zadinová M. Boubelík M.

In an attempt to dissect the roles of the α2β1 integrin and CD44 cell surface receptors in melanoma progression, we constructed type IV collagen-derived triple-helical peptide (THP) ligands for these receptors. The Gly-Phe-Hyp-Gly-Glu-Arg motif, in triple-helical conformation, has been shown to bind to the α2β1 integrin (38Knight C.G. Morton L.F. Onley D.J. Peachey A.R. Messent A.J. Smethurst P.A.

These THP ligands were employed individually, along with their linear counterparts (see Fig. 1), to study temporal changes in gene expression, at the levels of both mRNA and protein. RT-PCR was used to measure the levels of MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-8, MMP-9, MMP-13, MMP-14, heparanase A, ADAMTS-1, ADAMTS-2, ADAMTS-3, and ADAMTS-4 gene expression over 24 h. Protein expression of targets modulated by either ligand was examined by ELISA analysis. Finally, fluorogenic THP substrates were used to quantify active protease production. The molecular consequences of metalloprotease regulation by these two receptors were then considered in light of metastatic progression. Materials—The parental human melanoma cell line M14 was obtained as a generous gift from Dr. Barbara M. Mueller (La Jolla Institute for Molecular Medicine, La Jolla, CA). Tissue culture reagents were obtained from Fisher unless otherwise stated. The reagents for RT-PCR were all purchased through Invitrogen, and all of the immunologicals were supplied by Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). MMPs used as standards were expressed, purified, or purchased as described (41Lauer-Fields J.L. Sritharan T. Stack M.S. Nagase H. Fields G.B. J. Biol.

Amino acids are of the L-configuration (except for Gly). Hexanoic acid (CH3-(CH2)4-CO2H, designated C6) and decanoic acid (CH3-(CH2)8-CO2H, designated C10) were purchased from Fisher.

Preparation of Peptide and Peptide Amphiphile Ligands—Peptide resin assembly was performed on an Applied Biosystems 433A peptide synthesizer using 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl solid phase methodology, as previously described (50Yu Y.-C.

Soc. 1998; 120: 9979-9987Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar). All of the standard peptide synthesis chemicals and solvents were analytical grade or better. Edman degradation sequence analysis was performed on each peptide resin with an Applied Biosystems 477A protein and peptide sequencer, as described previously for “embedded” (noncovalent) sequencing (52Fields C.G. VanDrisse V.L. Fields G.B. Peptide Res. 1993; 6: 39-47PubMed Google Scholar). Lipidation of the peptide resin involved condensing a 4-fold molar excess of hexanoic or decanoic acid to the Nα-deprotected resin, with a 3.8-fold molar excess each of 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole in N,N′-dimethylformamide for 2 h. Cleavage and side chain deprotection of the lipidated peptide resins was accomplished by treating the resin for 1–2 h with either H2O-TFA (1:19) (for SSP-A and THP-B) or ethanedithiol-thioanisole-phenol-H2O-TFA (2.5:5:5:5:82.5) (for SSP-C, THP-D, and C10-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)5-Gly-Pro-Lys(Mca)-Gly-Pro-Gln-Gly∼Cys(4-methoxybenzyl)-Arg-Gly-Gln-Lys(Dnp)-Gly-Val-Arg-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)5-NH2). The resulting cleavage products were purified by preparative reverse phase HPLC and examined by analytical reverse phase HPLC and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry as previously described (53Fields C.G.

[M+H]+ values were: SSP-A, 1469.9 Da (theoretical 1470.7 Da); THP-B, 3610.7 Da (theoretical 3609.3 Da); SSP-C, 1658.3 Da (theoretical 1671.0 Da); THP-D, 3811.5 Da (theoretical 3813.3 Da); and C10-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)5-Gly-Pro-Lys(Mca)-Gly-Pro-Gln-Gly∼Cys(4-methoxybenzyl)-Arg-Gly-Gln-Lys(Dnp)-Gly-Val-Arg-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)5-NH2, 4846.2 Da (theoretical 4853.2 Da). Individual peptide triple helicity was assessed on a JASCO J-600 spectropolarimeter, with readings collected in the range of λ = 190–250 nm. The individual thermal transitions were determined in a thermostatted 1-cm quartz cell over the range of 5–80 °Cat λ = 225 nm, with lipidated peptide concentrations of 10–20 μm. Cell Culture—Parental M14 cells were routinely cultured in 75-cm2 flasks or 100-mm plates with RPMI 1640, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker, Inc., Walkersville, MD) and the following antibiotics: 0.1 mg/ml gentamicin sulfate, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 0.05 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate. The cells were cultured for up to eight passages and then replaced by frozen stocks to minimize phenotypic drift. All of the M14 cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. Cell Adhesion—Cell adhesion assays were performed to quantify cell binding to ligands. Melanoma cell adhesion to substrate-coated Pro-Bind™ 96-well plates (B & D Biosciences) was performed as described previously (44Lauer-Fields J.L. Malkar N.B. Richet G. Drauz K. Fields G.B. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5279-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Lipidated peptides dissolved in PBS were diluted in 70% ethanol, added to the 96-well plate, and allowed to adsorb overnight at room temperature with mixing. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were released with 5 mm EDTA in PBS, washed twice with adhesion medium (20 mm HEPES, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in RPMI 1640) and labeled with 5- or 6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate. Unincorporated fluorophore was removed by repeated washings with adhesion medium. The cells were then resuspended in adhesion medium and added to the plate. The plate was incubated 60 min at 37 °C. Nonadherent cells were removed by washing three times with adhesion medium. Adherent cells were lysed with 0.2% SDS and quantified using λexcitation = 485 nm and λemission = 538 nm with a SpectraMAX GeminiEM 96-well plate spectrafluorometer and SoftMax Pro 4.3LS software (both from Molecular Devices). Induction of Melanoma Cells—Pro-Bind™ 96-well assay plates were conditioned at room temperature overnight prior to initiation of the induction experiment with the appropriate concentration of ligand (see “Results”). The plates were then blocked by adding 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in PBS and incubated overnight at room temperature. M14 cultures used for induction experiments were typically 60–80% confluent before release from growth flasks with PBS containing 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.3. Subsequent to release, the cells were washed with adhesion media (RPMI 1640 containing 20 mm HEPES) and seeded at ∼7,500 cells/well. This cell density had been previously shown to produce efficient cell adhesion with minimization of cell-cell contacts (44Lauer-Fields J.L. Malkar N.B. Richet G. Drauz K. Fields G.B. J. Biol.

Aliquots of the melanoma-conditioned media were harvested at regular intervals over a 24-h period for later determination of metalloproteinase levels. Total RNA (∼1–2 μg) was isolated at regular intervals over a 24-h period with a S.N.A.P.™ RNA eukaryotic total RNA isolation kit and treated with DNase I to remove genomic DNA, as directed by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Both sets of samples were stored at –20 °C until analyses could be performed. To evaluate changes in gene expression for cells grown on peptide amphiphiles, RNA was isolated from 90,000 cells/time point up to 24 h. RNA yield was determined by measuring the A260 of an aliquot of the final preparation. Typical yields, on the order of 1–2 μg of total RNA, provided ample mRNA for multiple cDNA syntheses. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR—All of the reagents were from Invitrogen unless otherwise stated. DNase I-treated, total RNA isolated above was reverse transcribed in a total of 20 μl containing 125 ng of RNA following the manufacturer's recommendations for SUPERSCRIPT II. Primer-dropping PCR was performed on 10% of the resulting cDNA in a total of 50 μl following the manufacturer's recommendations for Platinum® Taq DNA polymerase. A typical PCR amplification cycle consisted of 30 s of melting at 94 °C, annealing at an optimized temperature (approximately equal to Tm (primers) – 10 °C) for 30–45 s, and extension at 72 °C for 60 s. Platinum® Taq DNA polymerase was activated for 2 min at 94 °C prior to the first amplification cycle. Annealing temperatures, total amplification cycles performed, and amplicon size are listed in Table I for the primers used in this study (see also Refs. 60Singh A. Nelson-Moon Z.L. Thomas G.J.

PCR products were electrophoresed in 3% agarose gels at 90 V for 45 min and stained with SYBR green I (BioWhittaker Molecular Applica tions). Images of stained gels were captured on a Fluor-S™ MutiImager and quantified using Quantity One® v4.3.0 software package. Microsoft Excel 98 was used to perform calculations and graphically represent trends in metalloproteinase expression. Briefly, this consisted of first determining the target to GAPDH ratio followed by normalization to the initial time point. PCR amplicons were gel-purified using an Invitrogen SNAP gel purification kit. The isolated DNA was sent to the Biotechnology Program at the University of Florida for sequencing.Table IPrimers designed for α2β1 integrin and CD44/CSPG studiesTargetSequenceAmplicon sizeCyclesAnnealing/melting temperaturebp°CGAPDH (F)GGT GAA GGT CGG AGT CAA CG4962162GAPDH (R)CAA AGT TGT CAT GGA TGA CCGAPDH-1 (F)CGA AGT CAA CGG ATT TGG TCG TAT3062062GAPDH-1 (R)AGC CTT CTC CAT GGT GGT GAA GACMMP-1 (F)ATG CGC ACA AAT CCC TTC TAC C2462760MMP-1 (R)TTT CCT CAG AAA GAG CAG CAT CMMP-2 (F)CAC CTG TCT CTG GGT CCA GAT CAG G[FAM]G73NAaNA, real time PCR was performed, and thus the cycle number was not optimized.60MMP-2 (R)CCC AAG TGG GAC AAG AAC CAMMP-3 (F)CAC ATC TCC TAC AGG ATT GTG A3553560MMP-3 (R)ACC AGG AAT AGG TTG GTA CCT GMMP-8 (F)GAT GCT ATC ACC ACA CTC CGT2833460MMP-8 (R)GCT GCG TCA ATT GCT TGG AMMP-8 (F)GAC CAA GTA ATT TGC GGA GGT GTT GG[FAM] C99NA60MMP-8 (R)CCT TGC TCA TGC CTT TCA GCMMP-9 (F)CAG GCT CCG GTG GAC GAT GCC ["

Rev is a nucleocytoplasmic transport protein that directly binds to its cis-acting Rev-responsive element RNA. Rev function depends on its ability to multimerize. The in vivo dynamics and the subcellular dependence of this process are still largely unexplored. To visualize and quantitatively analyze the mechanism of Rev multimeric assembly in live cells, we used high resolution in vivo fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. By using two different dynamic FRET approaches (acceptor photobleaching and donor bleaching time measurements), we observed a strong Rev-Rev interaction in the nucleoli of living cells. Most interestingly, we could also detect Rev multimerization in the cytoplasm; however, FRET efficiency in the cytoplasm was significantly lower than in the nucleolus. By using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, we investigated the mobility of Rev within the nucleolus. Mathematical modeling of the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching recoveries enabled us to extract relative association and dissociation constants and the diffusion coefficient of Rev in the nucleolus. Our results show that Rev multimerizes in the nucleolus of living cells, suggesting an important role of the nucleolus in nucleocytoplasmic transport.

Control of HIV RNA expression is complex and involves the interplay of cis-acting viral transactivators and several cellular proteins. Rev is a viral trans-activator protein that controls the differential expression of viral proteins at the post-transcriptional level by allowing the accumulation in the cytoplasm of unspliced and singly spliced viral RNA containing the Rev-responsive element (RRE) (1Felber B.K.

In the absence of Rev, the only viral RNA species that accumulate in the cytoplasm are multiply spliced and encode for the viral regulatory proteins. In the presence of Rev, the incompletely spliced mRNAs accumulate in the cytoplasm to serve as templates for viral structural protein synthesis or as viral genomes. Rev activity is therefore essential for virus replication. Rev is a small protein of 116 amino acids or 18 kDa. Its cellular localization is nucleolar, but it has been shown to shuttle continuously between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (1Felber B.K. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Cladaras C. Copeland T. Pavlakis G.N.

Nuclear localization is mediated by a short stretch of basic amino acids characterized by eight arginine residues located near the amino terminus of Rev that serves both as nuclear localization signal (NLS) and as an RNA binding domain (5Malim M.H. Hauber J. Le S.Y. Maizel J.V. Cullen B.R. Nature. 1989; 338: 254-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar, 11Perkins A. Cochrane A.W. Ruben S.M. Rosen C.A. J. Acquired Immune Defic.

It is flanked on both sides by sequences that contribute to Rev oligomerization on the RRE but have no detectable role in RRE binding. The NLS of Rev has been reported to associate with importin β, as well as with B23, a protein involved in the nuclear import of ribosomal proteins (13Henderson B.R. Percipalle P. J. Mol.

Nuclear export of Rev is mediated by its nuclear export signal, which is a leucine-rich domain between Leu-75 and Leu-84 located near the carboxyl terminus of the protein (15Fischer U. Huber J. Boelens W.C. Mattaj I.W. Luhrmann R. Cell. 1995; 82: 475-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). Disruption of this leucine-rich domain yields proteins (e.g. RevM10) with a dominant negative phenotype that localize to the nucleolus, bind RRE, and yet lose their ability to exit from the nucleus (5Malim M.H.

A detailed understanding of Rev multimerization requires the knowledge of timing and location of the different interactions in live cells. Therefore, we examined the molecular details of Rev multimerization and its kinetics inside living cells by fluorescence energy transfer (FRET) and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) measurements. The principle of FRET is based on the ability of a higher energy fluorophore molecule (donor) to transfer energy directly to a lower energy molecule (acceptor) when in close proximity. The presence of FRET indicates actual protein-protein interaction. The extent of FRET between a given donor and acceptor fluorescent molecule is dictated by the spectral parameter R0, i.e. the distance at which the FRET efficiency is 50%. In most cases, no FRET can be observed at distances greater than 10 nm. Therefore, FRET would occur with detectable efficiency only for those cases in which intimate interactions between the proteins were present. The mobility of a fluorescent protein can be assessed by using FRAP (26Lippincott-Schwartz J. Snapp E. Kenworthy A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 444-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar, 27Edidin M. Zagyansky Y. Lardner T.J. Science. 1976; 191: 466-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 28Axelrod D.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E145-E147Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). In this technique, fluorescent molecules in a small region of the cell are irreversibly photobleached by using a high powered laser pulse; subsequent movement of surrounding nonbleached fluorescent molecules into the photobleached area is recorded by time-lapse microscopy. Mathematical modeling of the FRAP data enables us to extract information such as relative association and dissociation constants and the apparent diffusion coefficient (30Carrero G. McDonald D. Crawford E. de Vries G. Hendzel M.J. Methods. 2003; 29: 14-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 31Phair R.D. Misteli T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 898-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). FRET and FRAP are minimally invasive and enable us to study the actual dynamics and interactions of Rev inside living cells. By using FRET, we demonstrate here that HIV Rev physically multimerizes inside living cells, and we visualize these interactions in specific subcellular compartments. We show that Rev multimerizes in the cytoplasm but forms a different complex than in the nucleolus. By using FRAP and mathematical computation, we measured the diffusion coefficient of Rev in the nucleolus and cytoplasm. Through the use of a Rev mutant that does not interact with the nucleolus and through mathematical modeling we extracted the apparent dissociation constant of Rev multimerization in vivo. Cell Culture, Transfections, and Plasmids—HeLa cells, human epithelial cells, were plated onto glass bottom microwell dishes (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA) at 0.1 × 106 cells/plate and were cultured overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech Inc., Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum until 50% confluent. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and transfected using SuperFect® (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's manual and incubated overnight. Before imaging cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and complete medium without phenol red was added. pBRev-BFP expresses the Rev protein fused to the blue fluorescent protein (BFP) emitting blue light (32Stauber R.H. Afonina E. Gulnik S. Erickson J. Pavlakis G.N. Virology. 1998; 251: 38-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). pRev-GFP and pTat-GFP plasmids produce fusion proteins of wild-type HIV-1 Rev and Tat, respectively, amino-terminally fused to the enhanced version of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) emitting green light (32Stauber R.H. Afonina E. Gulnik S. Erickson J. Pavlakis G.N. Virology. 1998; 251: 38-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Live Cell Imaging—Cells were grown in glass bottom microwell dishes; no additional manipulation was needed for imaging with an inverted microscope. All images were acquired with a laser-scanning confocal microscope (LSM 510 Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY) equipped with an Axiovert 200 microscope (Zeiss) and a 40× 1.3 NA oil immersion Plan-Neofluar objective. Live cells were imaged in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without phenol red, supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. For colocalization of BFP and GFP fusion proteins, BFP was excited with a multiphoton (Verdi/Mira 900, Coherent Inc, Auburn, CA) laser line at 780 nm and GFP with an argon laser line at 488 nm, and emissions were collected with bandpass filters of 390–465 and 500–550 nm respectively. Potential bleed through was measured by acquiring dual channel images of cells with single labels with the same setup used for cells coexpressing both labels. No bleed through was detected. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer—FRET was determined by the acceptor photobleaching method (33Kenworthy A.K. Methods. 2001; 24: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 34Kenworthy A.K. Edidin M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 69-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 35Wouters F.S.

Pixel size was 0.15 × 0.15 μm2. First, a pre-photobleach BFP (donor) and GFP (acceptor) image were acquired by exciting with the 780-nm two-photon and 488-nm laser lines, respectively. A region of interest in the cell was selected and rendered free of GFP by repeated scanning with the 488-nm laser line until all GFP was photodestructed. A second post-photobleach BFP and GFP image was acquired by scanning with the respective excitation laser lines. After correction for background and for photobleaching of the donor because of imaging, the FRET efficiencies (E) in the region of interest were calculated from the two BFP images by using Equation 1 (33Kenworthy A.K. Methods. 2001; 24: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 38Ha T. Enderle T. Ogletree D.F. Chemla D.S. Selvin P.R. Weiss S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6264-6268Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar),E=1−D0/D1(Eq.1) where D is the mean intensity of the donor in the area where the acceptor was bleached, before (D0) and after (D1) acceptor bleaching. The image and statistical analyses were performed with Matlab (Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA) and DIPimage (image processing toolbox for Matlab, Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands). The average FRET efficiency and its standard deviation were calculated from the FRET efficiencies of each individual cell. The standard Student's t test was used to determine the statistical significance of the results. Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching—Excitation of GFP was done at 488 nm and detection between 500 and 550 nm. The microwell dishes with coverslip bottom were directly mounted onto an LSM 510 microscope. Live cells were imaged at 37 °C (heating chamber, 20/20 Technology Inc., Wilmington, NC) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without phenol red and supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. FRAP experiments were performed as follows: a 2-μm wide strip throughout the cell was photobleached; bleaching was completed in 200–600 ms, and recovery images were acquired every 0.4–1 s. All images were background-subtracted first. The recovery curve was obtained by computing the ratio of the integrated intensity over the bleached region divided by the integrated intensity over the full nucleus. Taking this ratio permits an accurate correction for photobleaching of the specimen over time as well as a correct immobile fraction computation (see also Lippincott-Schwartz computation of immobile fraction) (26Lippincott-Schwartz J. Snapp E. Kenworthy A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 444-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). The recovery curve was then normalized so that the initial time point is 1. Recovery curves were fitted using the three compartments kinetic reaction model of Carrero et al. (30Carrero G. McDonald D. Crawford E. de Vries G. Hendzel M.J. Methods. 2003; 29: 14-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) by using a double exponential fit. In this method, the organelle of interest is bleached all across its middle, separating it after bleaching into two unbleached compartments of approximately the same size and a thin bleached band. All experiments were done in the same manner, with a bleached area of the same width. No obvious immobile fractions were observed in the data, so the fit did not include an immobile fraction parameter. The association and decay rates from the fit are in a relative scale (ka in %·s-1, and kdin %·%·s-1) and can therefore be compared. The diffusion coefficient was approximated by computing Dt from Carrero et al. (30Carrero G. McDonald D. Crawford E. de Vries G. Hendzel M.J. Methods. 2003; 29: 14-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and multiplying it by (l - w) × l/4 (where l is length of nucleus, and w is the width of bleach in μm in the vertical direction of the digitized image). This correction permitted determination of an absolute value for the diffusion coefficient. All bleaches were done the same way, with the same number of bleaching iterations and width (i.e. 2 μm). However, excitation intensity levels changed from cell to cell. Subcellular Localization and Colocalization of Rev in Living Cells—It has been shown biochemically that Rev multimerizes; however this multimerization has not been shown directly in living cells. To demonstrate interaction in mammalian cells, we studied the ability of wild-type Rev to relocalize a cytoplasmic Rev mutant (RevM5) to the nucleoli by in vivo microscopy. Therefore, we produced fusion constructs of the two proteins with either the blue fluorescent protein (BFP) or the green fluorescent protein (GFP). This fluorescent pair has excitation and emission spectra that can be easily separated for detection with fluorescence microscopy. Rev-BFP localizes in the nucleoli (Fig. 1, top right panel). RevM5-GFP was found predominantly in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1, left bottom panel), in agreement with published data (5Malim M.H. Hauber J. Le S.Y. Maizel J.V. Cullen B.R. Nature. 1989; 338: 254-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). RevM5 has two point mutations (R38D and R39L) in its RNA binding-site and is therefore unable to bind RRE RNA (5Malim M.H. Hauber J. Le S.Y. Maizel J.V. Cullen B.R. Nature. 1989; 338: 254-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar, 16Malim M.H. Cullen B.R. Cell. 1991; 65: 241-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). When Rev-BFP and RevM5-GFP were coexpressed, a significant fraction of RevM5-GFP was found in the Rev-BFP-containing nucleoli (Fig. 1, right bottom panel). Such colocalization of RevM5 with Rev in the nucleolus of living cells suggests interaction between the two proteins. Visualization of Rev Multimerization in the Nucleoli of Living Cells by FRET—To demonstrate a direct molecular interaction between Rev molecules in living cells, we monitored FRET between BFP-tagged Rev and GFP-tagged Rev. The principle of FRET is based on the ability of a higher energy fluorophore molecule (donor) to transfer energy directly to a lower energy molecule (acceptor) with simultaneous quenching of the donor fluorescence when the donor and acceptor are separated by less than 10 nm. Consequently, one demonstration of FRET is an increase in donor fluorescence after photobleaching the acceptor because the donor can no longer decay by nonradiative transfer of energy to the acceptor. The range over which FRET between a donor (BFP) and an acceptor (GFP) occurs, varies in a sensitive manner and is dictated by the spectral parameter R0, i.e. the distance at which the FRET efficiency is 50%. R0 for the BFP-GFP pair is 49–52 Å (40Siegel R.M. Chan F.K. Zacharias D.A. Swofford R. Holmes K.L. Tsien R.Y. Lenardo M.J. Science STKE. 2000; (http:/www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2000/PL1)PubMed Google Scholar, 41Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 509-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4983) Google Scholar). Due to the sixth power dependence on distance, the FRET efficiency with this donor-acceptor pair is <10% beyond 72 Å. In most cases, no FRET can be observed at distances greater than 100 Å. Therefore, FRET between Rev-BFP and Rev-GFP occurs only if true molecular interactions between the respective proteins were present. A first set of FRET experiments was performed in live HeLa cells. We created fusion constructs of Rev with either the BFP or the GFP. The functionality of the Rev fusion constructs has been shown earlier (32Stauber R.H. Afonina E. Gulnik S. Erickson J. Pavlakis G.N. Virology. 1998; 251: 38-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were transfected with these constructs, and corresponding FRET efficiencies were determined by the acceptor photobleaching technique (33Kenworthy A.K. Methods. 2001; 24: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 34Kenworthy A.K. Edidin M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 69-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 35Wouters F.S.

A. 1996; 93: 8407-8412Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In Fig. 2, the first acquired image (D0) is the fluorescence intensity distribution of the donor Rev-BFP directly excited by multiphoton laser at 780 nm. The second image (A0) represents the fluorescence intensity distribution of the acceptor Rev-GFP excited at 488 nm. The acceptor fluorophore was subsequently photodestructed in part of the field (A1) by repeated scanning with the 488 nm laser line, thereby eliminating energy transfer. Then a second donor fluorescence image (D1) was taken. An increase in donor fluorescence intensity is expected in the region of acceptor photobleaching only in the case of FRET. This is apparent in the nucleolus of the cells co-expressing Rev-BFP and Rev-GFP, demonstrating oligomerization of Rev proteins in the nucleolus of living cells (Fig 2A). As negative control for the FRET experiments, cells expressing Rev-BFP and Tat-GFP were used (Fig. 2B). As expected, no FRET could be observed with these proteins because Tat and Rev do not interact despite their presence in the same location. These data demonstrate for the first time true molecular oligomerization of Rev in the nucleolus of intact cells. To determine the extent of FRET, the FRET efficiency was calculated at each pixel. For statistical analysis, the average FRET efficiency from n cells analyzed was plotted as a box plot distribution showing the lower quartile, median, and the upper quartile (Fig. 2C). Cells transfected with wild-type Rev-BFP and Rev-GFP show an average FRET efficiency of 0.25 ± 0.05 that is significant higher (p < 0.01, Student's t test) than the control Tat-BFP with Rev-GFP (0.02 ± 0.03). We also measured the FRET efficiencies of the same pairs in fixed cells; there was no significant difference in FRET efficiency between fixed or live cells. A second independent assessment of FRET between Rev-BFP and Rev-GFP in cells was made from donor bleaching kinetics (Fig. 3). In FRET, direct transfer of donor energy to the acceptor provides an additional decay mechanism for the donor, thus reducing the probability of donor decay via photobleaching and resulting in a consequential increase in the photostability of the donor. Accordingly, donor bleaching time will increase. For this intention, BFP is a good fluorophore because it bleaches easily, and an increase in bleaching time can be clearly observed. The donor bleaching time was monitored by repetitive scanning with the two-photon 780 nm laser line. Repetitive excitation of BFP results in bleaching of the fluorophore. The kinetics of BFP bleaching in cells coexpressing Rev-BFP and Rev-GFP were compared with the bleaching of BFP in cells expressing Rev-BFP and Tat-GFP, a pair that does not result in FRET (Fig. 3A). Rev-BFP bleaches slower (i.e. more photostable) when it is associated with Rev-GFP, demonstrating FRET between Rev-BFP and Rev-GFP. This is also apparent from the following experiment. GFP was photobleached in part of the nucleolus of cells expressing both Rev-BFP and Rev-GFP or Rev-BFP and Tat-GFP, thus destroying potential FRET. We compared the rate of donor (BFP) bleaching in the region of the nucleolus where GFP was photodestructed with the rate of donor bleaching in the GFP-unbleached region of the same nucleolus. To do this, the ratio of the donor fluorescence in the GFP-unbleached region versus the GFP-bleached region was plotted over time (ratios were normalized to 1 for the initial time point). If FRET existed in the nucleolus, an increase in the ratio would be observed over time, reflecting the difference in donor photostability between the two regions (Fig. 3B). In the Rev-BFP- and Rev-GFP-containing nucleoli, the ratio increases over time, whereas the ratio stays 1 in the Rev-BFP- and Tat-GFP-containing nucleoli. These FRET experiments support the conclusion that Rev multimerizes in the nucleolus of cells. Rev Multimerizes in the Cytoplasm of Living Cells—The function of Rev is to transport single spliced and unspliced HIV RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. As reported above and in earlier studies (32Stauber R.H. Afonina E. Gulnik S. Erickson J. Pavlakis G.N. Virology. 1998; 251: 38-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 42Szilvay A.M.

These observations prompted us to determine whether Rev is able to oligomerize in the cytoplasm of cells. Therefore, we measured FRET between Rev38-BFP and Rev38-GFP. Rev38 has a mutation in its nuclear localization signal and is mainly found in the cytoplasm (32Stauber R.H. Afonina E. Gulnik S. Erickson J. Pavlakis G.N. Virology. 1998; 251: 38-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). FRET results for cells transfected with Rev38-BFP and Rev38-GFP are shown in Fig. 4. The first acquired image (D0) is the fluorescence intensity distribution of the donor Rev38-BFP excited by a two photon-laser at 780 nm. The second image (A0) represents the fluorescence intensity distribution of the acceptor Rev38-GFP directly excited at 488 nm. The acceptor fluorophore (GFP) was subsequently photobleached in part of the field by repeated scanning with the 488-nm laser line, thereby eliminating energy transfer. Then a second donor fluorescence image (D1) was taken. FRET is apparent in the cytoplasm of the cells, as seen by an increase in donor fluorescence intensity in the region of acceptor photobleaching, demonstrating a Rev complex in the cytoplasm (Fig 4A, D1). As a control for the FRET experiments, cells expressing Rev38-BFP and free GFP were used (Fig. 4B).

https://openalex.org/W2078551952,"Two cis-acting RNA trafficking sequences (heterogenous ribonucleoprotein A2 (hnRNP A2)-response elements 1 and 2 or A2RE-1 and A2RE-2) have been identified in HIV-1 vpr and gag mRNAs and were found to confer cytoplasmic RNA trafficking in a murine oligodendrocyte assay. Their activities were assessed during HIV-1 proviral gene expression in COS7 cells. Single point mutations that were shown to severely block RNA trafficking were introduced into each of the A2REs. In both cases, this resulted in a marked decrease in hnRNP A2 binding to HIV-1 genomic RNA in whole cell extracts and hnRNP A2-containing polysomes. This also resulted in an accumulation of HIV-1 genomic RNA in the nucleus and a significant reduction in genomic RNA encapsidation levels. Immunofluorescence analyses revealed altered expression patterns for pr55Gag and particularly that for Vpr. Vpr localization became almost completely nuclear and this was reflected in a significant reduction in virion-associated Vpr levels. These effects coincided with late steps of the viral replication cycle and were not seen at early time points post-transfection. Transcription, splicing, steady state RNA levels, and pr55Gag processing were not affected. On the other hand, viral replication was markedly compromised in A2RE-2 mutant viruses and this correlated with lowered genomic RNA encapsidation levels. These data reveal new insights into the virus-host interactions between hnRNP A2 and the HIV-1 A2REs and their influence on the patterns of HIV-1 gene expression and viral assembly.

Transcription of the integrated provirus produces one primary 9-kb transcript that is spliced to produce three size classes of RNA (1Purcell D.F. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6365-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The smallest size class, the 2-kb RNAs, is constitutively exported to the cytosol early in the HIV-1 replication cycle and encodes for the regulatory proteins Tat, Rev, and Nef. Late in the replication cycle, the two other size classes of RNA, the unspliced, 9-kb genomic RNA and the singly spliced, 4-kb RNAs make their way to the cytosol due principally to the activity of Rev, which binds to the Rev responsive element (RRE) present in these RNAs (2Malim M.H. Hauber J. Le S.Y. Maizel J.V. Cullen B.R. Nature. 1989; 338: 254-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). Whereas an abundant amount of information is available about the mechanisms, cellular cofactors, and regulation involved in Rev-mediated RNA nucleocytoplasmic transport (3Kjems J. Askjaer P. Adv. Pharmacol. 2000; 48: 251-298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), very little is understood about HIV-1 RNA trafficking following Rev's disengagement in the cytosol. Recent work demonstrates a role for the cellular human Rev-interacting protein (hRIP) at this step (4Sanchez-Velar N. Udofia E.B. Yu Z. Zapp M.L. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The HIV-1 structural protein, pr55Gag also plays a role at this late step by binding to RNA via it N-terminal matrix (MA) and C-terminal nucleocapsid (NC) domains (5Dupont S. Sharova N. DeHoratius C.

Morse 3rd., H.C. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 10508-10513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) provides a mechanism by which RNA trafficking is achieved within the cytoplasm. In support of the existence for a trafficking mechanism are data showing that kinesins and microtubules are both necessary for the trafficking of several HIV-1 RNAs (9Mouland A.J. Xu H. Cui H. Krueger W. Munro T.P. Prasol M. Mercier J. Rekosh D. Smith R. Barbarese E. Cohen E.A. Carson J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2133-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent observations of Moloney murine leukemia virus and HIV-1 indicate that vesicular trafficking on microtubules exists to achieve cytosolic trafficking of retroviral components, including the RNA, to sites of assembly (10Nydegger S.

In particular, expansion of CUG repeats in the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase RNA leads to its nuclear sequestration (13Davis B.M. McCurrach M.E. Taneja K.L. Singer R.H. Housman D.E. Proc. Natl.

Other examples include RNAs that are expressed in neural cells to influence memory and plasticity. A defect in myelination for instance is a characteristic of multiple sclerosis and may be the result of aberrant RNA trafficking (15Larocque D. Pilotte J. Chen T. Cloutier F. Massie B. Pedraza L. Couture R. Lasko P. Almazan G. Richard S. Neuron. 2002; 36: 815-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is involved in RNA transport and translation (16Caudy A.A. Myers M. Hannon G.J. Hammond S.M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2491-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar), and the absence of FMRP in fragile X syndrome could cause mRNAs to be de-repressed at the wrong intracellular address or at an inappropriate time, leading to alterations in neuronal dendritic spines (17Mazroui R. Huot M.E. Tremblay S. Filion C. Labelle Y. Khandjian E.W. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 3007-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The link between HIV-1 disease and the HIV-1 RNA localization and the cytoskeletal machinery is also very compelling (18Mandelkow E. Mandelkow W.-M.

The use of Rev transdominants for example has underscored the essential nature of Rev-mediated nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of HIV-1 RNA for HIV-1 replication (19Malim M.H. Freimuth W.W. Liu J. Boyle T.J. Lyerly H.K. Cullen B.R. Nabel G.J. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1197-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and this pathway also impinges on the cytoskeleton (20Watts N.R. Sackett D.L. Ward R.D. Miller M.W. Wingfield P.T. Stahl S.S. Steven A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Several Rev cofactors that are critical to Rev function interact with nuclear actin concomitant to RNA transport (21Hofmann W. Reichart B. Ewald A. Muller E. Schmitt I. Stauber R.H. Lottspeich F. Jockusch B.M. Scheer U. Hauber J. Dabauvalle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 895-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). HIV-1 RNA trafficking is dependent on microtubules and kinesin expression (9Mouland A.J. Xu H. Cui H. Krueger W. Munro T.P. Prasol M. Mercier J. Rekosh D. Smith R. Barbarese E. Cohen E.A. Carson J.H.

Cytoskel. 1997; 38: 318-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and we have made a link between long-term non-progression to AIDS and the trafficking signals involved based on changes at the A8 nucleotide in the A2RE-2 sequences from three non-progressors (9Mouland A.J. Xu H. Cui H. Krueger W. Munro T.P. Prasol M. Mercier J. Rekosh D. Smith R. Barbarese E. Cohen E.A. Carson J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2133-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). HIV-1 pr55Gag and the quintessential RNA trafficking protein, Staufen, physically interact (23Chatel-Chaix L. Clément J.-F. Martel C. Bériault V. Gatignol A. DesGroseillers L. Mouland A.J. Mol. Cell.

Cohen E.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5441-5451Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Finally, viral entry of the HIV-1 reverse transcription ribonucleoprotein complex depends on an intact cytoskeletal network (26McDonald D. Vodicka M. Lucero G. Svitkina Y. Borisy G. Emerman M. Hope T.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 441-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). In general, the family of hnRNP A/B proteins (A1, A1b, A2, B1) are involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation including splicing, RNA metabolism, transport, and translation (27Shyu A.B. Wilkinson M.F. Cell. 2000; 102: 135-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). They contain several functional domains including RNA recognition motifs and the M9 nuclear import/export signal in the C terminus. A general role of these proteins has been identified in HIV-1 RNA splicing regulation, binding to cis sequences on HIV-1 RNA (28Caputi M. Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Zahler A.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4060-4067Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 29Bilodeau P.S. Domsic J.K. Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Stoltzfus C.M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8487-8497Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). While recombinant hnRNP A2 has been shown to modulate splice site selection in in vitro splicing assays (29Bilodeau P.S. Domsic J.K. Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Stoltzfus C.M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8487-8497Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) several studies demonstrate that members of this family have specialized roles in transcription (30Hay D.C. Kemp G.D. Dargemont C. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3482-3490Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), in RNA trafficking (9Mouland A.J. Xu H. Cui H. Krueger W. Munro T.P. Prasol M. Mercier J.

Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 558-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and members of this family also respond differentially to hypoxia and stress (33Pioli P.A. Rigby W.F. J. Biol.

Cell Res. 2000; 256: 522-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Knockdown by siRNA also has differing degrees of effects on splicing suggesting functional differences between related hnRNPs (35Kashima T. Manley J.L. Nature Genetics. 2003; 34: 460-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the localization and functions of these proteins are not always confined to the nuclear compartment where RNA processing and maturation occur in eukaryotes (33Pioli P.A. Rigby W.F. J.

Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that the association of hnRNP A2 to two cis-acting RNA elements is important for cytoplasmic HIV-1 RNA transport in a murine oligodendrocyte RNA trafficking system (9Mouland A.J. Xu H. Cui H. Krueger W. Munro T.P. Prasol M. Mercier J. Rekosh D. Smith R. Barbarese E. Cohen E.A. Carson J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2133-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Because HIV-1 RNA trafficking was found to be dependent on hnRNP A2 expression and selective binding, we named these elements the hnRNP A2 response elements 1 & 2 or A2RE-1 and -2 (9Mouland A.J. Xu H. Cui H. Krueger W. Munro T.P. Prasol M. Mercier J. Rekosh D. Smith R. Barbarese E. Cohen E.A. Carson J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2133-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In our earlier studies using truncated RNAs, the A2RE-1 and A2RE-2 were found to act as RNA transport signals in their respective gag and vpr RNAs. Both the A2RE-1 and A2RE-2 are selectively bound by hnRNP A2 in vitro (9Mouland A.J. Xu H. Cui H. Krueger W. Munro T.P. Prasol M. Mercier J. Rekosh D. Smith R. Barbarese E. Cohen E.A. Carson J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2133-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Furthermore, both A2RE-1- and A2RE-2-containing HIV-1 RNAs were shown to colocalize and co-traffick in RNA transport granules, suggesting that different HIV-1 RNAs are trafficked by the same hnRNP A2-dependent mechanism. However, the A2RE-2-containing tat RNA, an mRNA expressed early following infection, was not transported efficiently, but gag and vpr RNA, RNAs that are expressed late in the replication cycle, were efficiently transported. This suggested that the signals encoded in these RNAs were contextual in the control of cytoplasmic RNA transport by hnRNP A2 (32Carson J.H. Cui H. Barbarese E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 558-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To explore the dependence of HIV-1 on the A2REs during HIV-1 replication we examined the relationship between hnRNP A2, the A2REs and the patterns of HIV-1 gene expression. We also explored the impact of wild-type and mutated A2RE sequences on viral replication in human T cells. Our results reveal that the A2REs function in the control of HIV-1 gene expression and have an impact on the export of HIV-1 RNA into the cytosol, the intracellular localization of pr55Gag and Vpr proteins and contribute to Vpr and genomic RNA levels in assembling virions. In addition, we show that hnRNP A2/A2RE-mediated RNA trafficking is important at a late step of the HIV-1 replication cycle. DNA Proviral Constructs—A2RE-1 and -2 are located at nt 1192-1213 and nt 6157-6178 in HxBc2-based proviral DNA, HxBru (39Yao X.J. Mouland A.J. Subbramanian R.A. Forget J. Rougeau N. Bergeron D. Cohen E.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4686-4693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. The A2RE proviruses were generated by recombinant PCR using HxBru as template. For A2RE-1, mutations were introduced in internal antisense and sense oligomers that span the A2RE-1 and 5′ SphI (SphI Sense: 5′-TCCAGTGCATGCAGGGCCTAT-3′) and 3′ ApaI (ApaI Antisense: 5′-TTGCAGGGCCCCTAGGAAAAAG-3′) containing flanking oligomers were used for PCR amplification of a 586-bp fragment. The resultant PCR fragments were digested and cloned directionally into the gag open reading frame to replace wild-type sequences. The A2RE-2 proviruses were also generated by PCR mutagenesis using a SalI-KpnI fragment in the vector pIIIEx7 (a Tat, Rev, and Nef expressor) as template (40Yao X.J. Subbramanian R.A. Rougeau N. Boisvert F. Bergeron D. Cohen E.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following religation into pIIIEx7 and selection for positive clones, a SalI-BamH1 fragment was directionally inserted into HxBru. A SphI-ApaI fragment from a provirus that harbors two silent point mutations in the A2RE-1 (A5G, A8G) was cloned into the provirus harboring A8G, T5C mutations in the A2RE-2 to produce A2RE 4Mut provirus, harboring two point mutations in each A2RE. In some experiments the 4Mut provirus was used (Fig. 1). Transient expression studies using a Tat cDNA expressor construct harboring the A8G, T5C mutations demonstrate that Tat is not expressed because tat mRNA is not translated. 2V. Bériault and A. Mouland, unpublished data. Because 4Mut harbors these mutations, we supplied Tat in trans (41Forget J. Yao X.J. Mercier J. Cohen E.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 915-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) to make up for deficits in Tat synthesis. The A8G mutations introduced in the A2REs are silent in both vpr and gag RNAs but the A2RE-2 A8G changes the Tat 2nd amino acid in the overlapping tat open reading frame from Glu2 to Gly2. This mutation does not have a repercussion on Tat structure as shown by Rice et al. (42Rice A.P. Carlotti F. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 6018-6026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), on HIV-1 expression levels, or processing (see Figs. 2A and 7B), or on its ability to transactivate the LTR. 2V. Bériault and A. Mouland, unpublished data. The ability of Tat to interact with TAR RNA or cyclin T binding is not influenced by the N-terminal domain as shown previously (43Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.M. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 451-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar), and Rev expression levels are likewise unaffected (data not shown). The proximity of the A2RE-2 mutations to splicing ESS and ESE does not influence HIV-1 RNA splicing as we show in in vitro splicing assays using homologous (HIV-1 sequences) and heterologous (non HIV-1 sequences) splicing substrates (data not shown).Fig. 2A2RE A8G blocks hnRNP A2 association to genomic RNA in whole cell lysates.A, COS7 cells were mock-transfected or transfected with HxBru, A2RE-1 A8G, or A2RE-2 A8G. Expression levels of Gag proteins, hnRNP A2, and hnRNP A1 in equal quantities of whole cell extract (determined by Bradford protein assay) are shown. The last three Hx-Bru lanes are included because lysates derived from these transfections serve as controls in the RT-PCR reactions shown in C and D. B, hnRNP A2 and hnRNP A1 were immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates in A and identified by their respective antiserum in Western blot analysis. Approximately equal expression levels of these hnRNPs were observed and the immunoprecipitations were quantitative. The use of a preimmune serum failed to immunoprecipitate either hnRNP. C, RNA was extracted from cell lysates in A, and a one-step RT-PCR reaction was performed to quantitate input HIV-1 genomic RNA and gapdh RNAs in subsequent immunoprecipitation analysis. The PCR cycle number was determined beforehand in order that the signals obtained fell within the linear range of the reaction (25 cycles for HIV-1 RNA and 20 cycles for gapdh RNA). D, from equal quantities of total cell extracts shown in C, either hnRNP A2 or hnRNP A1 (as control) was immunoprecipitated using specific antibodies (anti-hnRNP A2 or anti-hnRNP A1). One-step RT-PCR was performed on the immunoprecipitates to quantitate the amount of bound HIV-1 genomic RNA. Mutagenesis of the A2RE-1 or A2RE-2 blocked genomic RNA association by 36 and 82%, respectively, while this did not affect hnRNP A1 association. This determination was performed in three separate experiments and the average of these experiments is shown in the histogram in E A representative experiment is shown here and there was no more than a 5% deviation in the values determined for hnRNP A2 and no more than a 12% deviation for those calculated for hnRNP A1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 7Gene expression levels of wild-type and A2RE proviruses.

Viral protein expression levels were assessed in cellular extracts (lanes 1-4) and in purified virus preparations (lanes 5-8) following metabolic labeling using radiolabeled amino acids. pr55Gag, p25/24, and Vpr, (A and B) or by Western analyses for Vpr (C) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” HIV-1 genomic RNA was quantitated by Northern blot analysis (D). pr55Gag synthesis and processing were not affected by A2RE mutagenesis (A and see Fig. 2A). However, Vpr virion incorporation was found to be reduced in both A2RE-1 and A2RE-2 A8G mutants as shown in metabolic labeling and Western experiments (B and C, respectively). Rev and Vif expression levels were assessed by immunoprecipitation analyses and these were not influenced during A2RE proviral expression (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Immunoprecipitations, RT-PCR, and Polysome Isolation—COS7 or 293T cells were transfected with HxBru or A2RE mutant proviruses. 36-40 h after transfection, total cell lysates were prepared by using Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer for 30 min on ice, followed by centrifugation to remove cellular debris. An aliquot representing 25% of the cell lysates was used in a Western blot analysis for Gag, hnRNP A2, or hnRNP A1. Normalized amounts of cellular proteins were immunoprecipitated with either a mouse anti-hnRNP A2 or rabbit anti-hnRNP A1 (44Brooks S.A. Rigby W.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: E49Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (or rat anti-hnRNP A3, Ref. 45Ma A.S. Moran-Jones K. Shan J. Munro T.P. Snee M.J. Hoek K.S. Smith R. J. Biol.

DNA was digested with DNase I treatment from the remaining of the immunoprecipitates (Invitrogen, Mississauga, ON) followed by proteinase K digestion and subsequent RNA purification by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation as described (25Mouland A.J. Mercier J. Luo M. Bernier L. DesGroseillers L. Cohen E.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5441-5451Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar).

For input control, total RNA was purified from 10% of lysates and used in RT-PCR analysis to amplify genomic HIV-1 or gapdh RNA (23Chatel-Chaix L. Clément J.-F. Martel C. Bériault V. Gatignol A. DesGroseillers L. Mouland A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2637-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation using preimmune mouse or rabbit serum and an RNase A-treated sample were included as negative controls and to monitor DNA contamination in samples and nonspecific immunoprecipitation. Total cellular RNA purified from HIV-1-transfected cells served as a control in amplification and RT reactions. Interactions were calculated by relating the ratio of immunoprecipitated genomic RNA to the total hnRNP A2 or hnRNP A1 signal obtained in the immunoprecipitations in three separate experiments. The deviation from the average was calculated to be no more than 5% for hnRNP A2 binding and 12% for hnRNP A1 binding. Only PCR signals that fell within the linear range of this assay were used in the quantitation. Polysome isolation and immunoprecipitation were performed essentially as described before (44Brooks S.A. Rigby W.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: E49Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Polysomes were purified by stepwise ultracentrifugation and an equal amount of polysomes, determined by optical density (OD), were controlled for gapdh RNA levels by RT-PCR. Equal quantities of hnRNP A2-containing polysomes were subsequently immunoprecipitated using a mouse hnRNP A2 antiserum (EF67) (44Brooks S.A. Rigby W.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: E49Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and the purified RNA was used in RT-PCR analysis for total and genomic HIV-1 RNA, as described above. β-actin mRNA was quantitated in immunoprecipitates by RT-PCR using the following 5′ and 3′ PCR primers: β-Actin (sense): 5′-GTCGTCGACAACGGCTCCGGCATG; β-Actin (antisense): 5′-CCTTGGGGTTCAGGGGGGCCTCGG, which were designed to amplify a 300-bp fragment in both human and mouse cDNAs. gapdh mRNA was also identified in immunoprecipitates using an PCR primer set as described above. Northern Blotting, Metabolic Labeling, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Analyses—Wild-type and A2RE proviruses were transfected in COS7 or 293T cells. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol LS Reagent (Invitrogen) from cells at 36-40-h post-transfection, followed by Northern blotting using a [32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probe to the HIV-1 untranslated region (25Mouland A.J.

In common with the latter, it is secreted as a single chain precursor that is subsequently cleaved into two covalently associated chains. This is the first step in the activation of HGF/SF. The larger N-terminal α-chain (69 kDa) has pronounced domain structure, being comprised of an N-domain followed by four repeats of a highly cross-linked Kringle domain. By comparison, the smaller C-terminal β-chain (34 kDa) is structurally related to the serine protease domain of plasmin (1Stamos J. Lazarus R.A. Yao X. Kirchhofer D. Wiesmann C.

Interaction of HGF/SF with Met, its specific tyrosine kinase receptor, is believed to be mediated primarily by the first Kringle domain (K1) (2Lokker N.A. Mark M.R. Luis E.A. Bennnett G.L. Robbins K.A. Baker J.B. Godowski P.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2503-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Two alternatively spliced, truncated variants of HGF/SF exist naturally. Both are single chain species that correspond to part of the α-chain only. They comprise the N-domain together with either the first one or the first two Kringle domains and are designated NK1 (25 kDa) and NK2 (35 kDa), respectively. Both truncated forms can interact with the Met receptor and were variously described as antagonists or partial agonists of HGF/SF activity, depending upon the cell type and the in vitro assay used (2Lokker N.A.

Biol. 1998; 18: 1275-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and NK2 (8Otsuka T. Jakubczak J. Vieira W. Bottaro D.P. Breckenridge D. Larochelle W.J. Merlino G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2055-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) has suggested that in vivo they both can function as significant receptor agonists. In addition to interacting with Met, it is now clear that HGF/SF also interacts with a number of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), specifically heparin (9Nakamura T. Teramoto H. Ichihara A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6489-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), heparan sulfate (HS) (10Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Mizuno K. Nakamura T. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol.

Interactions with HS and DS are likely to be most important physiologically as they are widely expressed as components of proteoglycans, on the cell surface, or in the pericellular matrix and basement membranes of HGF/SF-responsive cells, e.g. epithelia/endothelia. The affinities of HGF/SF for these GAGs, i.e. KD values in the order of 10–8–10–9m (11Rahmoune H. Rudland P.S. Gallagher J.T. Fernig D.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6003-6008Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 12Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Rahmoune H. Fernig D.G. Nakamura T. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol.

It has been demonstrated in vitro that interaction with HS/DS constitutes a second necessary activation step for HGF/SF. Although HGF/SF can bind to Met in the absence of GAGs (14Mark M.R.

Chem. 2002; 277: 1040-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). As such, HS and DS appear to be equipotent in their activity, which is unusual by comparison with other GAG-dependent growth factors, which tend to be more HS-specific (for review, see Ref. 21Gallagher J.T. Lyon M. Iozzo R.V. Proteoglycans: Structure, Biology and Molecular Interactions. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York2000: 27-60Google Scholar). The molecular basis for the requirement for GAGs in facilitating Met activation by HGF/SF is still unclear. Studies with covalently cross-linked conjugates of HGF/SF and GAG oligosaccharides (either HS or DS), in a 1:1 stoichiometry, have suggested that such a “monomeric” complex is the minimal Met-activating unit (20Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1040-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Importantly, it also demonstrates that activation in vivo is likely to involve a ternary complex of GAG·HGF/SF·Met, in which HGF/SF binds simultaneously to both GAG and Met. It has also been demonstrated recently that Met possesses heparin/HS affinity in vitro (22Lietha D. Chirgadze D.Y. Mulloy B. Blundell T.L. Gherardi E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5543-5555Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 23Rubin J.S. Day R.M. Breckenridge D. Atabey N. Taylor W.G. Stahl S.J. Wingfield P.T. Kaufman J.D. Schwall R. Bottaro D.P. J.

A. 2003; 100: 12039-12044Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), which raises the additional possibility that the GAG component may also bridge both protein components within the ternary complex. In common with HGF/SF, both NK1 and NK2 are known to interact with heparin, and with similar affinities (4Lokker N.A. Godowski P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17145-17150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hartmann G. Prospero T. Brinkmann V. Ozcelik O. Winter G. Hepple J. Batley S. Bladt F. Sachs M. Birchmeier C. Birchmeier W.

GAG binding to all three proteins is to be expected, considering what is already known about the likely localization of the GAG-binding site within HGF/SF. Deletion and mutation analyses have consistently implicated the α-chain in GAG binding, with no apparent contribution from the β-chain (2Lokker N.A. Mark M.R. Luis E.A. Bennnett G.L. Robbins K.A.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9555-9561Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Indeed, most studies have suggested that the N-terminal hairpin loop structure is the major GAG-binding region (16Hartmann G. Prospero T. Brinkmann V. Ozcelik O. Winter G. Hepple J. Batley S.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5543-5555Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), have placed the major heparin interaction within the N-domain. However, there have also been some indications from affinity chromatography of domain-deleted (28Mizuno K. Inoue H. Hagiya M. Shimizu S. Nose T. Shimohigashi Y. Nakamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1131-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and point-mutated (16Hartmann G. Prospero T. Brinkmann V. Ozcelik O. Winter G. Hepple J. Batley S. Bladt F. Sachs M. Birchmeier C. Birchmeier W. Gherardi E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 8: 125-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar) forms of HGF/SF that Kringle 2 may contribute to the heparin binding properties of full-length HGF/SF, and therefore presumably NK2. Recently it was shown that a heparin oligosaccharide as small as a tetrasaccharide was able to bind with high affinity to HGF/SF, as measured on a biosensor, and to elicit a biological response to HGF/SF in the HaCaT human keratinocyte cell line made deficient in sulfated GAGs by treatment with chlorate (32Delehedde M. Lyon M. Vidyasagar R. McDonnell T.J. Fernig D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12456-12462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This suggests that the necessary GAG interaction with HGF/SF does not involve a particularly extended binding site, in contrast, for example, to the interaction of HS/heparin with fibronectin (33Lyon M. Rushton G. Askari J.A. Humphries M.J. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4599-4606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) or endostatin (34Blackhall F.H. Merry C.L.R. Lyon M. Jayson G.C. Folkman J. Javaherian K. Gallagher J.T. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 131-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, because the three-dimensional solution structure of full-length HGF/SF is unknown, it is not possible to infer that the bioactivity of HGF/SF is regulated by GAG association with the N-terminal domain alone or to infer whether additional domains, e.g. K2, are required. A likely consequence of the latter would be differences in GAG binding behavior between NK1 on the one hand and NK2 and HGF/SF on the other. We have undertaken a comparative study of the GAG binding properties of all three protein variants, i.e. NK1, NK2, and full-length HGF/SF, in an attempt to address the following questions. Is the unusual dual HS/DS binding selectivity of HGF/SF a common property of all three proteins? What is the minimal binding oligosaccharide size for both the natural GAG ligands, HS and DS, and is this a common feature for all three proteins? Do these minimal binding sequences activate HGF/SF? To help address these questions, a significant modification of the gel mobility shift assay (GMSA; described originally by Wu et al. (35Wu Z.L. Zhang L. Beeler D.L. Kuberan B. Rosenberg R.D. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar)) has been developed. The improved technique is sensitive, rapid, and easy to use. It also does not require radioactivity, and importantly, it can be generally used with all GAG species with equal efficacy and with a variety of GAG-binding proteins. Human recombinant HGF/SF was expressed in NSO myeloma cells, whereas NK1 and NK2 were expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified as described previously (30Chirgadze D.Y. Hepple J.P. Zhou H. Byrd A. Blundell T.L. Gherardi E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 72-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Glycosaminoglycan-deficient CHO pgsA-745 cells were a generous gift from Dr. Jeffrey Esko (University of California, San Diego, CA). HS derived from porcine intestinal mucosa was purchased from Celsus Laboratories Inc. (Cincinnati, OH). DS, also from porcine intestinal mucosa, was from CN Biosciences Ltd. (Nottingham, UK). Heparinase III (Flavobacterium heparinum; EC 4.2.2.8) was from Grampian Enzymes (Orkney, UK). Chondroitinase ACI (F. heparinum; EC 4.2.2.5), chondroitinase ABC (Proteus vulgaris; EC 4.2.2.4), sodium cyanoborohydride, and 2-aminoacridone were from Sigma. Bio-Gel P10 was from Bio-Rad. Prepacked PD10 desalting columns were from Amersham Biosciences. Monoclonal anti-dual phosphorylated Erk-1/2 (Thr(P)-202/Tyr(P)-204 p42/44MAPK; clone MAPK-YT) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were also from Sigma. Monoclonal antiphospho-Akt (Ser(P)-473 Akt) was from Cell Signaling Technology (New England Biolabs, Hitchin, UK). RPMI 1640 growth medium, fetal bovine serum, and all other tissue culture supplements were purchased from Invitrogen. HS and DS Oligosaccharide Purification—HS (100 mg) dissolved in 10 ml of 50 mm sodium acetate, 5 mm calcium acetate, pH 7.0, was digested with 0.1 IU of heparinase III at 37 °C for 18 h. The digest was then freeze-dried, dissolved in 1 ml of distilled water, and applied to a Bio-Gel P10 gel filtration column (1.6 × 180 cm) eluted with 0.2 m NH4HCO3 at a flow rate of 10 ml/h. Fractions of 2 ml in volume were collected, and peaks corresponding to oligosaccharides ranging from di-up to dodecasaccharides were individually pooled on the basis of absorbance at 232 nm as described previously (10Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Mizuno K. Nakamura T. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11216-11223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oligosaccharides were quantified using a molar extinction coefficient at 232 nm of 5200 m–1 cm–1. DS (50 mg) in 20 ml of 75 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, was first digested with 0.6 units of chondroitinase ACI at 37 °C for 48 h. This DS is considerably resistant to chondroitinase ACI, so after this treatment it was then partially digested with 0.1 unit of chondroitinase ABC at 37 °C over a total period of 100 min. Aliquots of 1 ml were removed every 5 min, and enzyme action was stopped by boiling. These aliquots were recombined, freeze-dried, redissolved in 1 ml of distilled water, and applied to two Bio-Gel P10 gel filtration columns (each 1.6 × 180 cm) connected in series. Chromatography was performed at a flow rate of 9 ml/h in 0.2 m NH4HCO3 with collection of 3-ml fractions. Size-separated oligosaccharides were pooled on the basis of absorbance at 232 nm (12Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Rahmoune H. Fernig D.G. Nakamura T. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 271-278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Heparin oligosaccharides were prepared by the fractionation of low molecular weight heparin as described previously (36Goger B. Halden Y. Rek A. Mosl R. Pye D. Gallagher J.T. Kungl A.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 41: 1640-1646Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Fluorescence End Labeling of Oligosaccharides—Fluorophore-labeled GAGs were produced essentially as described by Jackson (37Jackson P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 250-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Briefly, heparin, HS, or DS oligosaccharides (10, 100, and 100 μg, respectively) were dried down on a centrifugal evaporator, redissolved in 40 μl of a solution containing 0.1 m 2-aminoacridone (AMAC) in 85% Me2SO, 15% acetic acid (v/v), and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Subsequently, 40 μlof1.0 m sodium cyanoborohydride (in distilled water) was added to each reaction, and tubes were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. Samples were then concentrated for 1 h on a centrifugal evaporator. Labeled oligosaccharides were recovered from the free AMAC label by precipitation with 9 volumes of ethanol (prechilled to –20 °C) for 15 min, followed by centrifugation at 11,000 × g for 5 min. Precipitates were air-dried and then dissolved in 50% (v/v) glycerol in distilled water containing a trace of Phenol Red to give a final GAG concentration of 1 mg/ml. Gel Mobility Shift Assay—This electrophoretic assay is essentially as described by Wu et al. (35Wu Z.L. Zhang L. Beeler D.L. Kuberan B. Rosenberg R.D. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, oligosaccharides were combined with HGF/SF, NK1, or NK2 (at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends) in a total volume of 7 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 25% (v/v) glycerol for 15 min at room temperature. Samples were then applied to the wells of a non-denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel (2.6% cross-linker) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA. Electrophoresis was performed at 200 V for 10 min in a Bio-Rad Mini-Protean II system using an electrophoresis buffer comprising 40 mm Tris/acetic acid, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm EDTA. Immediately after electrophoresis, the fluorescent oligosaccharides were visualized on a UVItec gel analysis system coupled to a UVIphoto photographic imager (UVItec Ltd., Cambridge, UK). When used with a mixture of heparin oligosaccharides, the GMSA was performed instead on a 36% polyacrylamide gel (2.6% cross-linker). Electrophoresis was performed as described above, but for an extended time of 2 h. Preparation of Cross-linked HGF/SF·Heparin dp4 Conjugates—A fully sulfated heparin tetrasaccharide (dp4) was isolated by strong anion exchange-HPLC from a pool of heparin dp4s and then labeled with AMAC (as described earlier). The AMAC-labeled dp4 was then cross-linked to HGF/SF using a zero cross-linking strategy as described previously by Lyon et al. (20Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1040-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). After cross-linking, the sample was applied to a TSK-G4000PWXL (TosoHaas; 7.8 mm × 30 cm) size exclusion HPLC column eluted with 1.5 m NaCl, 10 mm phosphate, pH 7.2, at 0.5 ml/min. The high molecular weight peak corresponding to the HGF/SF·dp4 cross-linked conjugate, i.e. displaying both UV absorbance at 210 nm and fluorescence, was pooled and then desalted on a PD10 column eluted in water. Erk MAP Kinase and Akt Activation Assays in GAG-deficient Cells— CHO pgsA-745 cells were grown in 12-well cluster plates in 2 ml/well of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, penicillin (100 IU/ml), and streptomycin(100 μg/ml) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C. Supernatants were replaced with 2 ml of serum-free RPMI for 2 h before addition of the same medium containing HGF together with oligosaccharides at the indicated concentrations. After 5 (for Akt) or 20 (for Erk) min of treatment, the supernatants were removed, and the cells were solubilized in 100 μl/well of boiling Laemmli SDS sample buffer (non-reducing for Erk or reducing for Akt). After boiling for 2 min, 20-μl aliquots of cell extracts were then electrophoresed on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (2.6% cross-linker) at 200 V for 40–50 min. Proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Scientific Laboratory Supplies, Nottingham, UK) on a semidry blotter at 200 mA for 1 h. The membrane was blocked for 1 h with either phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% (w/v) nonfat milk powder (for Erk) or Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and 5% (w/v) nonfat milk powder (for Akt) before being washed three times with either phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20 or Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, respectively. Membranes were probed with mouse antiphospho-Erk 1/2 (1:1000 dilution) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and 3% (w/v) nonfat milk powder for 1 h or with rabbit antiphospho-Akt (0.5 μg/ml) in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 16 h. Subsequent incubations with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgGs (1:1000 dilution) were for 1 h. Visualization was by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (ECL) according to the manufacturer's (Amersham Biosciences) instructions. We wished to investigate in parallel the abilities of the three different variant proteins, NK1, NK2, and HGF/SF, to bind with high affinity to different sizes of both HS and DS oligosaccharides and also to ascertain the relationship between the oligosaccharide size required for activation, as opposed to binding, in the HGF/SF system. A sensitive high throughput binding assay was therefore required that could utilize small quantities of the same non-radiolabeled oligosaccharides that were to be used in activation assays in vitro. The gel mobility shift assay introduced recently by Wu et al. (35Wu Z.L. Zhang L. Beeler D.L. Kuberan B. Rosenberg R.D. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) is an attractive methodology in that it allows analysis of HS/heparin oligosaccharide-protein interactions that take place under solution conditions of physiological pH and ionic strength. The equilibrium mixture of oligosaccharide·protein complexes and free oligosaccharides/proteins can then be easily separated by rapid electrophoresis through a low percentage native (i.e. non-reducing and non-denaturing) polyacrylamide gel. Visualization was by autoradiographic detection of radiolabeled oligosaccharides after drying of the gel. Speed of analysis was thus dependent upon a high specific activity of incorporation of a relatively high energy radioisotope, i.e.35S, into the parent heparin/HS species. 35S was incorporated into the GAG by enzymatic transfer in vitro from the radiolabeled sulfate donor [35S]PAPS using specific HS sulfotransferases. We substantially modified this procedure by replacing the need for radiolabeling and adopting instead the fluorescence end labeling of GAG oligosaccharides with 2-aminoacridone. This also avoids changes to the internal native GAG structure. This labeling procedure has been used previously for analytical separations of non-GAG oligosaccharides (37Jackson P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 250-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), as well as hyaluronan- and chondroitin/dermatan sulfate-derived disaccharides (38Calabro A. Benavides M. Tammi M. Hascall V.C. Midura R.J. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and larger hyaluronan oligosaccharides (39Mahoney D.J. Aplin R.T. Calabro A. Hascall V.C. Day A.J. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 1025-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). GAG oligosaccharides are easily labeled using AMAC. We also found that the ethanol solubility of free AMAC provides an easy postlabeling clean-up and recovery step.

https://openalex.org/W2005796157,"The major function of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is the control of cell growth. Insulin and amino acids regulate the mTOR pathway, and both are needed to promote its maximal activation. To further understand mTOR regulation by insulin and amino acids, we have studied the enzyme in primary cultures of hepatocytes. We show that insulin increases mTOR phosphorylation on Ser2448, a consensus phosphorylation site for protein kinase B (PKB). Ser2448 phosphorylation is also increased by amino acids, although they do not activate PKB. Furthermore, insulin and amino acids have an additive effect, indicating that they act through distinct pathways. We also show that phosphorylation of Ser2448 does not seem to modulate in vitro phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 by mTOR. However, stimulation of hepatocytes with insulin and amino acids leads to an increase in mTOR kinase activity. Rapamycin has no effect on insulin-, glucagon-, and 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)adenosine-cAMP-induced amino acid transport. Surprisingly, glucagon and 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)adenosine-cAMP, which do not activate PKB, stimulate the phosphorylation on Ser2448 of mTOR. However, glucagon inhibits amino acid- and insulin-induced activation of ribosomal S6 protein kinase 1 and phosphorylation of the translational repressor eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1. Our results demonstrate that glucagon, which is not able to activate but rather inhibits the mTOR pathways, stimulates the phosphorylation of mTOR on Ser2448. This finding suggests that phosphorylation of this site might not be sufficient for mTOR kinase activity but is likely to be involved in other functions.

It is now established that cells respond to amino acid availability by inducing an intracellular pathway involving the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). 1The abbreviations used are: mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; PKB, protein kinase B; 4E-BP1, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1; S6K1, ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1; CPT, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)adenosine; MEM, minimum essential medium; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; AIB, 2-aminoisobutyric acid; FKBP12, FK506-binding protein 12.

Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sci. STKE. 2003; 2003: 1-17Google Scholar). The principal known function of mTOR is the regulation of cell growth, especially via the regulation of protein synthesis, where it regulates the ribosomal protein S6 kinases (S6K1 and S6K2) and the translational repressor 4E-BP1 (also known as PHAS-I (for phosphorylated heat and acid stable protein regulated by insulin)) (4Harris T.E. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sci. STKE. 2003; 2003: 1-17Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at the appropriate sites activates S6K1, which then phosphorylates ribosomal protein S6 to promote regulation of ribosome biogenesis (5Dufner A. Thomas G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). 4E-BP1 phosphorylation results in the release of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E, thereby increasing cap-dependent mRNA translation (6Lawrence J.J.

It has been shown in several cell types that the mTOR protein is activated by amino acids and more precisely by branched chain amino acids (4Harris T.E. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sci.

For insulin, it seems that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and the protein kinase B (PKB) are involved in mTOR activation (10Scott P.H. Brunn G.J. Kohn A.D. Roth R.A. Lawrence J.J. Proc. Natl.

Recently, several reports have implicated the heterodimer formed by the tumor suppressors TSC1 and TSC2 (or hamartin and tuberin, respectively) (12Shamji A.F. Nghiem P. Schreiber S.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 271-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). TSC2 encodes a putative GTPase-activating protein (GAP), whereas TSC1 contains coiled-coil domains but has no known enzymatic activity. TSC2 appears to be a direct PKB substrate and to function as a primary effector of PKB-mediated signaling to mTOR/S6K/4E-BP1 pathway (12Shamji A.F. Nghiem P. Schreiber S.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 271-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). PKB has been shown to phosphorylate mTOR in vitro on Ser2448 (13Navé B.T. Ouwens M. Withers D.J. Alessi D.R. Shepherd P.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). This residue is also phosphorylated in response to PKB activation (10Scott P.H. Brunn G.J.

These proteins, named raptor and GβL, are necessary for mTOR activity (15Kim D.H. Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. King J.E. Latek R.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Sabatini D.M.

Insulin and amino acids have been shown to individually regulate mTOR pathway, and both are needed to promote its maximal activation. However, little information is available concerning the regulation of mTOR kinase activity by these agents. Similarly, the role of mTOR in insulin action (except the regulation of protein synthesis) is not well defined, especially in the hepatocytes. Therefore, we have studied mTOR kinase in the physiological model of primary cultures of rat hepatocytes. In these cells, we have determined mTOR phosphorylation and kinase activity in the presence of insulin and/or amino acids. We also have investigated the role of mTOR in amino acids transport in response to insulin, as well as in response to an insulin antagonist, i.e. glucagon. Although our results show that system A amino acids transport is regulated by a rapamycin-insensitive pathway, we demonstrate for the first time that glucagon stimulates mTOR phosphorylation on Ser2448. Moreover, we show a concomitant decrease in insulin- and amino acid-induced phosphorylation of S6K1 on Thr389 and of 4E-BP1 on Ser64 and Thr36/45 in the presence of glucagon, indicating that the hormone has an inhibitory effect on proteins downstream of the mTOR pathway. Our study points to a multi-factorial regulation of mTOR phosphorylation on Ser2448 in hepatocytes by insulin, amino acids, and glucagon.

The antibody directed against a C-terminal peptide of 4E-BP1 and the phosphospecific antibodies that specifically recognize 4E-BP1 phosphorylated in Thr36/45 and Ser64 were obtained as described previously (20Mothe-Satney I.

Isolation and Primary Culture of Hepatocytes—Hepatocytes were isolated from adult male Wistar rats (150–175 g, from Elevage Janvier, Le Genest St. Isle, France) by collagenase dissociation of the liver as described previously (21Fehlmann M. Le Cam A. Freychet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10431-10437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Freshly isolated hepatocytes were incubated in KRB buffer (120 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 24 mm NaHCO3, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.5) supplemented with 1% (w/v) BSA and were gassed with a mixture of 5% CO2 and 95% O2. The cells were plated at a final concentration of 106 cells/6-well dish and 5 × 106cells/10-cm-diameter dish in Waymouth medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml) and maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2. After 4 h the medium was replaced with serum-free Waymouth medium containing 0.2% (w/v) BSA, penicillin, streptomycin, and gentamycin (250 μg/ml) for 17 h. The cells were then stimulated in different conditions, as described below. When the cells were used to study the effect of amino acids, the cells were washed twice with KRB buffer and incubated for 150 min in KRB buffer with 0.2% (w/v) BSA containing gentamycin prior to cell stimulation. Stimulation and Lysis of Primary Cultured Rat Hepatocytes—Depending on the experiments, the cells were stimulated with the following reagents: insulin (10–7m), glucagon (10–7m), or CPT-cAMP (10 μm), in the presence or absence of a 1× MEM amino acid solution plus l-glutamine. After stimulation, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm NaH2PO4, 1.7 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4), scraped from dishes, and homogenized at 4 °C in 250 μl (for one 6-well dish) or 1 ml (for one 10-cm diameter dish) of buffer A (50 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm potassium phosphate, 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm 1.4-dithiothreitol, and 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.4) containing the protease inhibitors 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 150 μg/ml aprotinin, and 250 μg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzene-sulfonylfluoride. Homogenization was performed at 4 °C with an Elvehjem Potter (30 s at 2000 min–1). Before use, the homogenates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were used for the experiments described below. Affinity Purification of mTOR—Recombinant GST-FKBP12 was expressed in bacteria and purified as described previously (1Sabers C.J. Martin M.M. Brunn G.J. Williams J.M. Dumont F.J. Wiederrecht G. Abraham R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 815-822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 22Brunn G.J. Hudson C.C. Sekulic A. Williams J.M. Hosoi H. Houghton P.J. Lawrence J.J. Abraham R.T. Science. 1997; 277: 99-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). To purify mTOR, GST-FKBP12 (100 μg) was incubated with 30 μl of Glutathione-Sepharose in buffer A containing 0.5% (w/v) BSA. After 90 min at 4 °C, the resin was washed three times with buffer A and incubated (final volume, 1 ml) for 90 min at 4 °C with cell homogenates from primary cultures of rat hepatocytes in presence of 10 μm rapamycin. Control incubations were conducted with FK-506. The beads were then washed three times with buffer A and resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer containing 3% (w/v) SDS and 1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar). mTOR Kinase Activity after Immunoprecipitation of mTOR—Recombinant histidine-tagged 4E-BP1 ([His6]4E-BP1) used as a substrate in mTOR kinase assay was purified from bacteria as described previously (24Haystead T.A.J. Haystead C.M.M. Hu C. Lin T.-A. Lawrence J.C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23185-23191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To immunopurify mTOR, 5 μg of mTab2 or anti-Ser(P)2448 antibodies bound to protein A-Sepharose were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with 1 ml of cell homogenates. The beads were then washed at 4 °C as follows: twice in buffer A, twice in buffer A plus 0.5 m NaCl, twice in buffer B (1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), and twice in buffer C (50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm Na-HEPES, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.4). The beads were resuspended in 20 μl of buffer C, and the kinase reaction was initiated by adding 30 μl of buffer C supplemented with 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol), 10 mm MnCl2, and 40 μg/ml of [His6]4E-BP1. After 1 h at room temperature, the reaction solution (containing 32P-[His6]4E-BP1) was separated from the beads (containing immunopurified mTOR) before adding Laemmli sample buffer. Electrophoretic Analyses and Western Blotting—The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE by using the method of Laemmli. For experiments in which mTOR was purified using GST-FKBP12, the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore), and Western blotting was performed using affinity purified anti-Ser(P)2448 antibodies (0.5 μg/ml). After an overnight incubation at 4 °C, the membranes were washed with wash buffer (140 mm NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Incubation with the secondary anti-rabbit antibody peroxidase-conjugated (from Jackson Laboratories, Inc., Copenhagen, Denmark) was then performed for 1 h at room temperature, and the membranes were washed again with wash buffer. Antibody binding was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. To assess total amount of affinity-purified mTOR, the membranes were stripped (for 30 min at 50 °C in buffer containing 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, and 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7) and reprobed with mTab2, the binding of which is not affected by phosphorylation of Ser2448. For mTOR kinase activity, 32P-labeled [His6]4E-BP1 was visualized by autoradiography of the dried gel. Immunopurified mTOR was identified by immunoblotting with mTab2 antibodies (0.5 μg/ml) as described above. Relative signal intensities of the bands corresponding to [His6]4E-BP1 and to mTOR were determined after scanning the autoradiographs or using a scanning laser densitometer (Molecular Dynamics), respectively. For some experiments, the protein concentration of cell homogenates was determined, and 50–75 μg of proteins were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, loaded on a 5 or 7.5% polyacrylamide gel, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. After transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, the proteins of interest were detected by immunoblotting with the following antibodies: anti-Ser(P)2448 followed by mTab2 (after stripping of the membranes), anti-phosphoS6K1 (Thr389) (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), followed by anti-S6K1 (p70S6 kinase) (Santa Cruz, CA), or anti-phosphoPKB (Ser473), followed by anti-PKB (Cell Signaling Technology), or anti p42/p44 MAP kinase (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). When necessary, quantification of the scanned bands from the immunoblots was performed using ImageQuant computer software. Measurement of System A Amino Acid Transport—The effect of rapamycin on hormone-stimulated system A amino acid transport was determined in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes using 2-amino-isobutyric acid (AIB), a nonmetabolizable analogue of alanine, as described previously (25Alengrin F. Grossi G. Canivet B. Dolais-Kitabgi J. Diabetes Metab. 1987; 13: 591-597PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were incubated for 16 h with 50 nm rapamycin or Me2SO (0.05%) (v/v) in Waymouth medium containing 0.2% (w/v) BSA. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, incubated in KRB buffer/0.2% BSA, and stimulated for 3 h with insulin (10–7m), glucagon (10–7m), or CPT-cAMP (10 μm), in the presence of freshly added rapamycin or Me2SO. Transport assays were performed at the end of the incubation period by adding [14C]AIB (0.1 mm, 57 mCi/mmol) for 30 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Medium containing nonincorporated radioactivity was removed, and the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were solubilized with 0.2 n NaOH and neutralized with 0.2 n HCl. Incorporated radioactivity was counted in the presence of 3 ml of scintillation liquid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The uptake data have been corrected for extracellular trapping (assessed by [3H]inulin) and expressed per mg of cell protein. Statistical Analysis—The differences between two conditions were determined by an unpaired Student's t test. A p value of <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. All of the values are expressed as the means ± S.E. Effects of Insulin and Amino Acids on Ser2448 Phosphorylation and on Kinase Activity of mTOR—To determine whether insulin and amino acids have any effect on the phosphorylation of Ser2448, primary cultures of rat hepatocytes were stimulated for 30 min in the presence of insulin or amino acids, or both. The cells were lysed, and incubation of cell lysates with GST-FKBP12 beads was performed in the presence of rapamycin to purify mTOR. As controls, incubations were also performed with Me2SO (solvent for rapamycin) or FK506 (26Abraham R.T. Wiederrecht G.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 483-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti-Ser(P)2448 antibodies followed by mTab2 (Fig 1A, upper and lower panels, respectively). The pull-down with FKBP12·rapamycin complex reveals one molecular species corresponding to mTOR. As expected, no mTOR protein was purified when FKBP12 alone or the FKBP12·FK506 complex was used for the pull-down assay (Fig. 1A). In the control cells, basal phosphorylation of Ser2448 was seen. Insulin treatment increased this phosphorylation as well as amino acids. Moreover, the combination of insulin and amino acids induced a greater phosphorylation of Ser2448 than insulin or amino acids alone. As shown on the immunoblot with mTab2, approximately the same amount of mTOR protein was purified in each condition of stimulation. Quantification of independent experiments revealed that amino acids and insulin induce Ser2448 phosphorylation by about 5- and 3-fold, respectively, and that their effects are significantly additive (almost 8-fold increase when both are present; Fig. 1B). Next, we measured in vitro kinase activity of mTOR after being phosphorylated by insulin and/or amino acids in primary cultures of hepatocytes. To this aim, mTOR was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using the anti-Ser(P)2448 antibodies, and an in vitro kinase assay was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 2A shows a representative autoradiogram of 32P-labeled [His6]4E-BP1, as well as the amount of phosphorylated substrate relative to that obtained in control cells. mTOR kinase activity is stimulated 3- and 5.6-fold in the presence of insulin or amino acids, respectively. The increase reaches 12-fold in the presence of both insulin and amino acids. Moreover, the activity is tightly correlated to the amount of immunoprecipitated phospho-mTOR (Fig. 2B). This result suggests that the increased activity observed when mTOR is phosphorylated corresponds to a greater amount of immunoprecipitated mTOR protein. Thus, we tried to determine mTOR kinase activity after immunoprecipitation of total mTOR protein. Hepatocytes were stimulated or not in the presence of insulin and amino acids for 30 min, mTOR was immunoprecipitated using mTab2, and the same experiment as the one described in Fig. 2A was performed. Compared with control cells, mTOR kinase activity was significantly increased by 2.2-fold after insulin and amino acid treatment (Fig. 2C). This effect was observed without any change in the amount of mTOR protein in mTab 2 immunoprecipitates (not shown). This result indicates that insulin and amino acids have a stimulatory effect on mTOR kinase activity. Effect of Rapamycin on Amino Acid Transport Stimulated by Insulin and Glucagon—Because amino acids are involved in the activation of the mTOR pathway to promote protein synthesis, notably in response to insulin, we investigated whether mTOR pathway could have any effect on the regulation of amino acid transport into the cell. We were interested in the system A amino acid transport because it is increased in response to insulin. Primary cultures of rat hepatocytes were treated with rapamycin for 16 h and then stimulated with insulin or glucagon for 3 h. Indeed, generally speaking, glucagon antagonizes insulin action, but both hormones are able to stimulate the system A amino acid transport in hepatocytes (21Fehlmann M. Le Cam A. Freychet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10431-10437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, insulin induces a 3-fold increase in AIB uptake, and rapamycin does not significantly modify this effect. Glucagon stimulates the amino acid transport to the same extent as does insulin, even in the presence of rapamycin. Because glucagon increases cAMP production in hepatocytes, we also looked at the effect of CPT-cAMP, a nonmetabolizable analogue of cAMP. AIB influx is increased by 4-fold in the presence of CPT-cAMP, and rapamycin has no further effect (Fig. 3A). Thus, system A amino acid transport does not seem to be regulated by the mTOR pathway in hepatocytes. We investigated in the same experiment the phosphorylation of mTOR on Ser2448 in the absence of rapamycin (Fig. 3B). After 3 h, insulin has little, if any, effect on mTOR phosphorylation on this site, compared with what was observed after 30 min (Fig. 1). Surprisingly, it seems that phosphorylation of Ser2448 occurs when cells are treated with glucagon or CPT-cAMP (Fig. 3B). Characterization of mTOR Phosphorylation on Ser2448 by Glucagon—We further investigated the effect of glucagon on Ser2448 phosphorylation. First, we incubated hepatocytes with glucagon for increased periods of time and analyzed Ser2448 phosphorylation after affinity purification of mTOR using FKBP12 and rapamycin (Fig. 4A). Phosphorylation of Ser2448 increases in the presence of glucagon after 10 min and reaches a maximum within 30 min (6-fold increase compared with the control condition). Phosphorylation persists until 1 h and then slowly decreases up to 3 h. Thus, like insulin and amino acids, glucagon increases mTOR phosphorylation on Ser2448 in primary cultures of hepatocytes. To compare the effect of glucagon on Ser2448 phosphorylation with that of insulin, we also monitored the phosphorylation of this site of mTOR after insulin stimulation between 10 min and 3 h. After cell lysis, mTOR was affinity-purified using GST-FKBP12 and rapamycin, and its phosphorylation was analyzed after SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using the anti-Ser(P)2448 antibodies (Fig. 4B). Insulin maximally stimulates phosphorylation of Ser2448 after 10 min, and its effect slowly decreases up to 60 min to reach a steady-state level just above the level of phosphorylation seen in the control condition. In conclusion, in primary cultures of hepatocytes insulin transiently increases mTOR phosphorylation on Ser2448, whereas glucagon has a more sustained effect. In our initial experiment, the effect on mTOR phosphorylation was studied using a high concentration of glucagon (10–7m). Thus, we determined the phosphorylation of Ser2448 within a range of glucagon concentrations, varying from 0.1 nm to 1 μm (Fig. 5). The length of stimulation was 30 min, because this length of incubation appears to lead to the maximal glucagon effect (Fig. 4A). mTOR Phosphorylation on Ser2448 was detectable with a concentration as low as 0.1 nm (1.7 -fold increase compared with the control condition). Then it gradually augments with increased doses of glucagon to reach a maximum at 100 nm (about 8-fold increase). The EC50 is around 1 nm, indicating that phosphorylation of Ser2448 by glucagon occurs at physiological hormone concentrations. Next, we investigated the effect of amino acids on glucagon-induced Ser2448 phosphorylation. To do so, hepatocytes were incubated for 10 min with glucagon or CPT-cAMP in the presence or in the absence of 1× amino acids. Fig. 6A shows representative immunoblots of anti-Ser(P)2448 antibodies (upper panel) and mTab2 (lower panel). Compared with control conditions, glucagon and CPT-cAMP stimulate Ser2448 phosphoryl-ation, and their effect is similar to the one obtained with amino acids. Moreover, the presence of amino acids in the incubation medium does not seem to modify the glucagon- or the CPT-cAMP-induced phosphorylation of Ser2448. Indeed, quantification of the phosphorylated mTOR in the different conditions (Fig. 6B) shows no additive effect of amino acids, contrary to what was observed in the case of insulin (Fig. 1). Effects of Insulin, Amino Acids, and Glucagon on PKB Activation and on Downstream Targets of mTOR—We were interested in studying the effects of amino acids and glucagon on proteins lying upstream (PKB) or downstream (S6K1 and 4E-BP1) of mTOR. To this aim, hepatocytes were incubated with glucagon in the presence or in the absence of amino acids and lysed, and immunoblots using different antibodies were performed (Fig. 7). Concerning PKB, we looked at th"
https://openalex.org/W1990395203,"A functional fluorescent neurokinin NK2 receptor, EGFP-NK2, was previously used to follow, by fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements in living cells, the binding of its fluorescently labeled agonist, bodipy-neurokinin A (NKA). Local agonist application suggested that the activation and desensitization of the NK2 receptors were compartmentalized at the level of the plasma membrane. In this study, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments are carried out at variable observation radius (vrFRAP) to probe EGFP-NK2 receptor mobility and confinement. Experiments are carried out at 20 °C to maintain the number of receptors constant at the cell surface during recordings. In the absence of agonist, 35% EGFP-NK2 receptors diffuse within domains of 420 ± 80 nm in radius with the remaining 65% of receptors able to diffuse with a long range lateral diffusion coefficient between the domains. When cells are incubated with a saturating concentration of NKA, 30% EGFP-NK2 receptors become immobilized in small domains characterized by a radius equal to 170 ± 50 nm. Biochemical experiments show that the confinement of EGFP-NK2 receptor is not due to its association with rafts at any given time. Colocalization of the receptor with β-arrestin and transferrin supports that the small domains, containing 30% of activated EGFP-NK2, correspond to clathrin-coated pre-pits. The similar amount of confined EGFP-NK2 receptors found before and after activation (30–35%) is discussed in term of putative transient interactions of the receptors with preexisting scaffolds of signaling molecules.

The prevailing view is that the intracellular signal results from a cascade of transient and sequential molecular interactions starting with the activation of the heterotrimeric G-protein upon ligand/receptor interaction. The biological effect then can be attenuated by three main mechanisms: (i) agonists removal; (ii) agonist-mediated desensitization of the receptor molecules by uncoupling of the activated receptors from heterotrimeric G-proteins; and (iii) agonist-stimulated receptor endocytosis followed by either recycling or degradation. The remaining key questions are to understand the architecture governing the molecular interactions of the signaling cascade and how these multiple interactions take place in space and time, notably starting with the lateral organization of the partners at the level of the plasma membrane (1Neubig R.R.

J. 2003; 84: 356-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Here we investigate these different aspects using the neurokinin NK2 receptor expressed in HEK293 cells as a model system. Neurokinins form a family of neuropeptides acting at three distinct GPCRs, namely NK1, NK2 and NK3. The NK2 receptor shows preferential binding for the endogenous neurokinin A (NKA) (5Severini C. Improta G. Falconieri-Erspamer G. Salvadori S. Erspamer V. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 285-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar) and is mostly found in peripheral nervous tissues where it participates mainly to smooth muscle contraction. In previous studies, a fluorescently modified receptor labeled with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) on the amino-terminal extracellular part (EGFP-NK2) was developed and expressed in a model cell system, the HEK293 cells. The binding properties of several fluorescent derivatives of NKA and their associated responses were studied using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (6Vollmer J.Y. Alix P. Chollet A. Takeda K.

Chem. 1999; 274: 37915-37922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the ligand binding to the receptor was measured on single cells after local application of fluorescent NKA. The observation, relevant to the present work, was that activation and desensitization of the response were compartmentalized at the level of the plasma membrane. We now investigate the possible dynamic confinement of the EGFP-NK2 receptors in the cell plasma membrane using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching at variable observation radius (vrFRAP). FRAP was used extensively in the 1980s and 1990s (9Tocanne J.F. Dupou-Cezanne L. Lopez A. Tournier J.F. Prog. Lipid Res. 1994; 33: 203-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 10Tocanne J.F. Dupou-Cezanne L. Lopez A. Tournier J.F. FEBS Lett. 1989; 257: 10-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 11Edidin M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 528-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) to measure lateral diffusion of molecules in biological and model membranes. FRAP gathers information on the collective behavior of molecule diffusion. Typically, around 25,000 fluorescently labeled proteins are observed over an area of 4–10 μm2/cell and the process is repeated at least 30–40 times on different cells. An improved version of this technique is FRAP at variable observation radius. This approach aiming to analyze dynamic confinements is based on the assumption that the mobile fraction of a fluorescent molecule will depend on the radius of the area bleached by illumination. In a previous study, we validated this assumption first numerically with Monte Carlo simulations of FRAP experiments at variable beam radius performed on 150 × 150 site triangular lattice (representing a membrane). These lattices were obstructed by fences delineating hexagonal closed areas of different sizes characterized by the radius of a circular disk of equivalent areas (12Salome L. Cazeils J.L. Lopez A. Tocanne J.F. Eur. Biophys. J. 1998; 27: 391-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Once the conceptual approach was validated, we set up vrFRAP in an experimental model of compartmentalized membranes consisting of a monolayer of apposed spherical silica bead-supported phospholipid bilayers of known radii (12Salome L. Cazeils J.L. Lopez A. Tocanne J.F. Eur. Biophys. J. 1998; 27: 391-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This technique has been successfully applied to biological specimens (12Salome L.

Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 755-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) indicating membrane organization in domains with a radius of ∼250 nm, consistent with data obtained by single particle tracking experiments (4Daumas F.

In this study, we used vrFRAP to investigate dynamic lateral confinement of the EGFP-NK2 receptor in the plasma membrane of stably transfected HEK293 cells. We then combined biochemical analysis and molecular co-localization approaches to get insight into the nature of the domains detected by vrFRAP. Chemicals—C6-NBD-PC (1-Acyl-2-[6-[(7-nitro-2–1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]caproyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) and DOPC (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). Texas Red-transferrin was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). NKA (His-Lys-Asp-Ser-Val-Phe-Gly-Leu-Met-NH2) was purchased from Bachem. The purity of the lipid compounds was checked by thin-layer chromatography. Salts and solvents were of analytical grade. Cell Culture and Transfection—Stable HEK293 cell lines overexpressing NK2 receptors or NK2 receptors fused at their amino-terminal part to the EGFP fluorescent protein were grown plated in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (Invitrogen). These transfected cells were selected with 100 μg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen) for 1 week/month (6Vollmer J.Y. Alix P. Chollet A. Takeda K. Galzi J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37915-37922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Stably transfected EYFP-GPI-anchored protein-expressing cells and EYFP-CD46-expressing cells were obtained upon transfection of HEK293 cells by calcium chloride methodology and 600 μg/ml G418 selection (Invitrogen) with a pEYFP-GPI-N1 construct (17Keller P. Toomre D. Diaz E. White J. Simons K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 140-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) or a pEYFP-CD46 construct (18Pralle A. Keller P. Florin E.L. Simons K. Horber J.K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 997-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar), respectively, both cordially given by Dr. Patrick Keller. Cell Membrane Labeling by C6-NBD-PC Probes—0.4 μmol of each of C6-NBD-PC and DOPC were taken from chloroform/methanol (9:1) solutions at 3 mm. Solvents were removed under vacuum. The lipid mixture was then dissolved in 100 μl of ethanol, and the solution was injected under vortexing with a 100-μl syringe (Hamilton, Switzerland) in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) Ca2+-Mg2+ (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5) (19Vergne I. Cezanne L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The final lipid concentration was 80 μm. HEK293 cells expressing or not expressing the non-fluorescent NK2 receptors were grown on a coverslip (22 × 22 mm). The coverslips were placed on ice (4 °C) for 10 min in culture medium and washed once with PBS Ca2+-Mg2+ before labeling for 10 min at 4 °C in PBS Ca2+-Mg2+ supplemented with the C6-NBD-PC and DOPC lipids (19Vergne I. Cezanne L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). They were then washed twice with PBS Ca2+-Mg2+ before carrying FRAP experiments. Inhibition of Protein Synthesis—Cells plated on a coverslip were washed twice with PBS Ca2+-Mg2+, incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 150 μl of 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) in PBS Ca2+-Mg2+ (20Kajino S. Suganuma M. Teranishi F. Takahashi N. Tetsuka T. Ohara H. Itoh M. Okamoto T. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2233-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and washed twice with PBS Ca2+-Mg2+. Experimental Conditions for FRAP Experiments on Living Cells—FRAP experimental conditions must be well established to avoid the generation of artifactual immobile fractions and erroneous mobile fractions. (i) The surface of the illuminated area has to be small with respect to the cell surface (condition of infinite probe reservoir, value of cell surface >5× the illuminated area) (21Lopez A. Dupou L. Altibelli A. Trotard J. Tocanne J.F. Biophys. J. 1988; 53: 963-970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells have a mean diameter of 15 μm. Therefore, the maximal observation radius for this study was 3.45 μm (21Lopez A. Dupou L. Altibelli A. Trotard J. Tocanne J.F. Biophys. J. 1988; 53: 963-970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). (ii) The recovery half-time (τ = R2/4D, where R is radius and D is the diffusion coefficient) of the experiments must be calculated for each probe and for each radius of the illuminated area. The duration of the photobleaching phase must be <5% the fluorescence recovery half-time (21Lopez A. Dupou L. Altibelli A. Trotard J. Tocanne J.F. Biophys. J. 1988; 53: 963-970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). FRAP Experiments and Analysis of Fluorescence Recovery Data—The coverslip on which the cells were plated was washed with PBS Ca2+-Mg2+ and covered with another coverslip (24 × 36 mm) on a homemade stainless steel slide. The FRAP experiments were achieved on the apical pole of the cell where ligands have ready access to apical NK2 receptors. Each preparation of cells was explored for 30 min only to circumvent potential problems due to changes in the viability and fluorescent labeling of cells. The temperature was systematically maintained at 20 °C. Experiments were carried out in “uniform disk illumination” conditions using an apparatus based on a Leitz Ortholux II fluorescence microscope (21Lopez A. Dupou L. Altibelli A. Trotard J. Tocanne J.F. Biophys. J. 1988; 53: 963-970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The expanded beam of the Argon laser (λex = 488 nm) was focused on a sample through a set of diaphragms (from 50 to 165 μm) and through a Leitz ×63/1.3 oil immersion objective, making it possible to vary the radius of the observation area from 1.05 to 3.45 μm. The bleaching rates of ∼40% were obtained for a bleaching time of 50–75 ms. Bleaching time was varied according to the probe studied to ensure consistency with the lipid or protein recovery half-time reported for the cellular plasma membrane (21Lopez A. Dupou L. Altibelli A. Trotard J. Tocanne J.F. Biophys. J. 1988; 53: 963-970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). >30 fluorescence recoveries were accumulated for each experimental condition tested on various cells. All of the experiments were carried out at least in triplicate. The diffusion coefficient (D) and the mobile fraction (M) were obtained by fitting diffusion equations to the experimental recovery curves as previously described (21Lopez A. Dupou L. Altibelli A. Trotard J. Tocanne J.F. Biophys. J. 1988; 53: 963-970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). A minimization algorithm coupled to statistical analysis of the data was used to provide from a set of accumulated recovery curves the solution values for D and M and their maximum (Dmax and Mmax) and minimum (Dmin and Mmin) values for a confidence level of 95% (21Lopez A. Dupou L. Altibelli A. Trotard J. Tocanne J.F. Biophys. J. 1988; 53: 963-970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In addition, the analysis of the recovery curves for one or two diffusive populations was achieved according to the best fit criteria. Analysis of vrFRAP Experiments—In our previous study, the mobile fractions (M) were observed to increase linearly with the increasing size radius (r) of the domain obstructed by hexagonal fences and corresponded to a unique master line leading to the relationship shown in Equation 1.M=A·r/R with A=0.634±0.004 (eq.1) For closed areas, this line intercepts the mobile fraction axis at a value M ≈ 0. D has to be recalculated according to Equation 2 (12Salome L. Cazeils J.L. Lopez A. Tocanne J.F. Eur. Biophys. J. 1998; 27: 391-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).Dreal=12Dapp(r/R)2 (eq.2) When hexagonal fences of the diffusion areas were slightly open, M was found to be the sum of two contributions: (i) one that is an M value dependent on R and related to the fluorescent tracer remaining confined in the domain during the observation time and (ii) another permanent one, Mp, that is independent of R. Mp increases with increasing permeability of the fences, which delineate the hexagonal “closed areas.” For the opening of 20.4, 10.2, 6.1, 4.1, and 0% of the diffusion area perimeter, the corresponding values of Mp are 0.75, 0.55, 0.45, 0.33, and 0 (12Salome L. Cazeils J.L. Lopez A. Tocanne J.F. Eur. Biophys. J. 1998; 27: 391-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, for membranes composed of slightly open domains, the fluorescence recovery curves can be fitted with two diffusion coefficients: (i) one that is independent of R and corresponding to particles that diffuse over long distances and (ii) another one that shows a quadratic dependence of Dapp on R and corresponding to the diffusion of particles inside the domains. The corresponding true diffusion coefficient value Dreal is calculated following Equation 2 (12Salome L. Cazeils J.L. Lopez A. Tocanne J.F. Eur. Biophys. J. 1998; 27: 391-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As a control, it is important to note that, in egg-PC multilayers labeled with 1% fluorescent probe, a model membrane known to be laterally homogeneous (21Lopez A. Dupou L. Altibelli A. Trotard J. Tocanne J.F. Biophys. J. 1988; 53: 963-970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), M and D are invariant with R (data not shown). Activation of NK2 Receptors with Neurokinin A—A stock solution of 10 mm NKA in dimethylformamide was diluted in PBS Ca2+-Mg2+ to give a final concentration of 1 μm. HEK293 cells expressing or not expressing the non-fluorescent NK2 receptors and labeled with C6-NBD-PC or HEK293 cells overexpressing fluorescent EGFP-NK2 receptor were incubated on a coverslip (22 × 22 mm) with 150 μl of 1 μm NKA. Cells were kept in contact with agonist solution at 20 °C for the 30 min required to carry out FRAP experiments on one preparation. It was calculated that, in these experimental conditions (Ki = 64 ± 25 nm) (6Vollmer J.Y. Alix P. Chollet A. Takeda K. Galzi J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37915-37922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), >95% receptor binding sites were occupied. Analysis of EGFP-NK2 Receptor Association with Lipid Microdomains Insoluble in Cold Triton X-100 —Three types of stable cell lines derived from HEK293 cells were tested: EGFP-NK2 receptors expressing cells; EYFP-GPI-anchored protein-expressing cells; and EYFP-CD46-expressing cells. 10 million cells for each sample were collected upon PBS, 5 mm EDTA treatment after 2 days of culture in 10-cm plates. EGFP-NK2 receptors expressing cells were incubated at 37 or 20 °C in Eppendorf tubes with 1 ml of HEPES-BSA buffer (137.5 mm NaCl, 1.25 mm MgCl2, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 6 mm KCl, 5.6 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, 0.4 mm NaH2PO4, 1% bovine serum albumin (w/v), pH 7.4) for 5, 15, or 30 min in the presence or in the absence of 1 or 10 μm NKA. The three types of cells were then evenly treated. Cells were briefly centrifuged at 4 °C and suspended in 400 μl of ice-cold TNE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 and one tablet of Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor (for 10 ml of buffer; Roche Applied Science). The samples were rotated in the cold room on a wheel for 1 h to allow detergent solubilization. The floatation of the lipid-enriched detergent-insoluble material was achieved in OptiPrep™ sucrose gradient (22Lecat S. Verkade P. Thiele C. Fiedler K. Simons K. Lafont F. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2607-2618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Seven fractions were collected from each gradient with fraction 1 having the lightest density. To analyze the content in fluorescently modified fusion proteins (either EGFP-NK2 receptors or EYFP-GPI or EYFP-CD46), each fraction of the density gradient was submitted to immunoprecipitation with polyclonal anti-GFP antibodies and the immunoprecipitated material was separated on polyacrylamide gels, blotted, and revealed with monoclonal anti-GFP antibodies (8Lecat S. Bucher B. Mely Y. Galzi J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42034-42048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To analyze the content of each fraction of the density gradient in endogenous caveolin-1, each supernatant of the anti-GFP immunoprecipitation was trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, separated on polyacrylamide gels, blotted, and revealed with polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (22Lecat S. Verkade P. Thiele C. Fiedler K. Simons K. Lafont F. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2607-2618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Texas Red-Transferrin Uptake of EGFP-NK2 Receptors Expressing Cells—EGFP-NK2 receptors expressing cells were split and grown for 2 days in 24-well plates on 12-mm glass coverslips coated with rat type I collagen. On the day of experiment, cells were starved by a 1-h incubation in serum-free medium. The cells were then incubated for periods ranging from 0 to 45 min in HEPES-BSA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors (40 μg/ml bestatin and bacitracin, 20 μg/ml phosphoramidon, 50 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) containing 20 μg/ml Texas Red-transferrin and 1 μm NKA at 37 or at 20 °C. Transferrin uptake was stopped by placing cells on ice and washing them immediately with ice-cold HEPES-BSA buffer. The cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at 4 °C and then incubated for 15 min in NH4Cl 50 mm. Coverslips were mounted onto microscope slides using an anti-fading agent, Mowiol (Calbiochem). Cloning of β-Arrestin2 and Insertion into pCEP4 Expression Vector 5′ to the EYFP Gene—β-Arrestin2 was cloned by PCR on a λ-phage cDNA library made from HEK293 cells RNA as described below. A fraction (30 μl) of the HEK293 cell cDNA library was denatured by boiling for 5 min and incorporated into a PCR reaction mixture using β-arrestin2 internal oligonucleotides to check for the presence of β-arrestin2. This finding was confirmed, and β-arrestin2-flanking oligonucleotides including a Kozak consensus sequence and sequences for flanking endonuclease sites (NotI and BamHI) for insertion into the pCEP4 expression vector were synthesized and included in a new PCR reaction on HEK293 cells cDNA. The resulting fragment was cloned into the pCEP4 vector and sequenced. From this construct, a β-arrestin2 NotI-NheI gene fragment was isolated and inserted into NotI-BamHI-digested pCEP4 5′ to a NheI-BamHI EYFP fragment in a double cloning experiment. Transient Transfection of Non-fluorescent NK2 Receptors Expressing Cells with β-Arrestin2-EYFP Construct—Non-fluorescent NK2 receptors expressing cells were transfected 2 days after plating on 10-cm plates by the calcium chloride technique with 0.8 μg of β-arrestin2-EYFP construct. Medium was replaced the following day. On the second day after transfection, cells were plated on 12-mm glass coverslips coated with rat type I collagen and grown for an additional 2 days. On the day of experiment, cells were incubated for periods ranging from 0 to 45 min in HEPES-BSA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors and with 1 μm Texas Red-NKA at 37 or at 20 °C. Fixation was followed as described for the transferrin uptake experiments with the exception that fixation was performed at 20 °C. Confocal Analysis—Cells were observed with a laser scanning microscope with upright stand SP1-UV type (Leica) using a PLApo 63 × 1.3 numeric aperture oil immersion objective (Leica) at the Centre d'Imagerie of the IGBMC Institute in Strasbourg. Between 7 and 13 stacks (depending on the cell depth) of two-dimensional images were acquired sequentially in the “green” or “red” channels. Micrograph images in figures are taken from the middle of the cells. Internalization of EGFP-NK2 Receptors Measured Using Anti-GFP Antibodies—Cells expressing EGFP-NK2 receptors were suspended in 12 ml of HEPES-BSA buffer at a concentration of 106 cells/ml. The cell suspension was separated into 2 × 50-ml Falcon tubes with a magnetic stirrer and incubated at 37 °C. At time point 0, 1 μm NKA was added to one of the tubes. At time points 0, 5, 15, 30, and 45 min, 1 ml of the cell suspensions were collected from both tubes and transferred to a tube containing 10 μl of sodium azide (10%) chilled in ice. At the end of the 45-min incubation, cells were pelleted by centrifugation (3 min, 2000 × g) at 4 °C and resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold PBS, 1% BSA on ice for 15 min. Immunolabeling of EGFP-NK2 receptors expressed at the cell surface was done using a monoclonal mouse anti-GFP (1/100 dilution, Roche Applied Science) for 30 min on ice. Cells were then washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS, 1% BSA, and secondary labeling was done using a R-phycoerythrin-conjugated AffiniPure F(ab′)2 fragment goat antimouse IgG (1/100 dilution, Immunotech, Marseille, France). Samples were washed twice in 1 ml of PBS, fixed for 5 min in ice-cold PBS, 4% paraformaldehyde, resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold PBS, and stored overnight. Phycoerythrin staining was quantified by flow-cytometric analysis (10,000 cells/sample) on a cytometer (FACStar, BD Biosciences). Mean phycoerythrin fluorescence intensity was calculated using FACStar data software after subtraction of nonspecific staining by the two antibodies measured on non-transfected cells. The ratio of NK2 receptors at the cell surface was directly correlated to the ratio of phycoerythrin fluorescence intensity for samples with NKA as compared with samples without NKA. vrFRAP were carried out on EGFP-NK2 receptors expressing cells before and after activation by the agonist NKA to investigate a possible confinement of the receptors in the plasma membrane and to characterize the lateral diffusion coefficient of this receptor. Before applying the FRAP technique to biological membranes, one essential point to check is the degree of intracellular labeling of cells by fluorescent probes (23Dupou L. Lopez A. Tocanne J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 669-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Indeed, the depth of focus when large areas are illuminated (r = 3.45 μm) was calculated to be ∼4 μm (23Dupou L. Lopez A. Tocanne J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 669-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For accurate determination of the fluorescence intensity of the plasma membrane, the fraction of the fluorescence intensity originating from the intracellular compartments must be <10% of the total fluorescence intensity. This is the case for EGFP-NK2 receptors expressing cells, which display intense fluorescence, originating almost exclusively from the plasma membrane (Fig. 1, A and B) (6Vollmer J.Y. Alix P. Chollet A. Takeda K. Galzi J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37915-37922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, we checked that the incubation of these cells with cycloheximide for 1 h at 37 °C, which is known to block protein synthesis (20Kajino S. Suganuma M. Teranishi F. Takahashi N. Tetsuka T. Ohara H. Itoh M. Okamoto T. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2233-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), has no effect on the repartition of the fluorescence over the cells nor on the recorded mobile fraction during FRAP experiments (data not shown). The temperature was maintained at 20 °C during FRAP experiments to minimize endocytosis (6Vollmer J.Y. Alix P. Chollet A. Takeda K. Galzi J.L. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1971436590,"The acidic ribosomal P proteins form a distinct protuberance on the 60 S subunit of eukaryotic ribosomes. In yeast this structure is composed of two heterodimers (P1α-P2β and P1β-P2α) attached to the ribosome via P0. Although for prokaryotic ribosomes the isolation of a pentameric stalk complex comprising the analogous proteins is well established, its observation has not been reported for eukaryotic ribosomes. We used mass spectrometry to examine the composition of the stalk proteins on ribosomes from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The resulting mass spectra reveal a noncovalent complex of mass 77,291 ± 7 Da assigned to the pentameric stalk. Tandem mass spectrometry confirms this assignment and is consistent with the location of the P2 proteins on the periphery of the stalk complex, shielding the P1 proteins, which in turn interact with P0. No other oligomers are observed, confirming the specificity of the pentameric complex. At lower m/z values the spectra are dominated by individual proteins, largely from the stalk complex, giving rise to many overlapping peaks. To define the composition of the stalk proteins in detail we compared spectra of ribosomes from strains in which genes encoding either or both of the interacting stalk proteins P1α or P2β are deleted. This enables us to define novel post-translational modifications at very low levels, including a population of P2α molecules with both phosphorylation and trimethylation. The deletion mutants also reveal interactions within the heterodimers, specifically that the absence of P1α or P2β destabilizes binding of the partner protein on the ribosome. This implies that assembly of the stalk complex is not governed solely by interactions with P0 but is a cooperative process involving binding to partner proteins for additional stability on the ribosome.

Ribosomes are the universal translators of messenger RNA into proteins. X-ray analysis of the 30 S subunit from Thermus thermophilus, the 50 S subunit from Haloarcula marismortui, and the intact 70 S particle from T. thermophilus have revealed fascinating insights into the structures of these macromolecular machines (1Wimberley B.T. Brodersen Jr., D.E. W. M. C. Morgan-Warren R.J. Carter A.P. Vonrhein C. Hartsch T. Ramamkrishnan V. Nature. 2000; 407: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar, 2Yusupov M. Yusupov G.

Science. 2000; 289: 905-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (2761) Google Scholar). There are currently, however, no high resolution structures of eukaryotic ribosomes. These 80 S particles consist of two subunits, the 60 and 40 S subunits. Low resolution structures obtained by electron microscopy indicate an overall topology similar to that of the Escherichia coli 70 S ribosome but indicate that the eukaryotic particle is larger and more complex. In general, the core of the ribosome is highly conserved, but in S. cerevisiae there are large differences in the periphery of the particle. This is attributed to the presence of additional ribosomal proteins and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) regions of variable size, interrupting the universal core secondary structure of eukaryotic rRNA (4Spahn C.M. Grassucci R.A. Penczek P. Frank J. Structure. 1999; 7: 1567-1573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The eukaryotic 60 S subunit is larger than the prokaryotic 50 S subunit, but the greatest differences are observed between the 30 S subunit and the eukaryotic 40 S subunit. A common feature of all ribosomes is a flexible protuberance on the side of the large subunit, known as the stalk complex. The presence of the stalk has been reported for all species examined to date but is often difficult to study by x-ray analysis because of its dynamic nature. The pentameric complex from bacterial sources however has been studied in some detail in complex with ribosomes by cryo-electron microscopy to determine conformational changes associated with ribosome function (5Agrawal R.K. Heagle A.B. Penczek P. Grassucci R.A. Frank J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 643-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The stoichiometry of the stalk complex in E. coli has been determined to be two copies of L12, with along its acetylated counterpart L7, and one copy of L10 at the base of the stalk. In higher organisms the stalk has evolved from two L7/L12 dimers to a tetramer of acidic “P proteins.” In ribosomes from S. cerevisiae there are five stalk proteins: P0, P1α, P1β, P2α, and P2β. Despite some similarities to L7/L12, sequence identity between prokaryotic and eukaryotic acidic ribosomal proteins is low and is restricted mainly to the hinge region between the N- and C-terminal domains. The P1 and P2 proteins vary in size between 10.6 and 11.1 kDa and are structurally and functionally distinct (6Remacha M. Jimenez-Diaz A. Santos C. Briones E. Zambrano R. Rodriguez Gabriel M. Guarinos E. Ballesta J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 959-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), although they share a highly conserved C terminus. The P1 proteins share a conserved N terminus, as do the P2 proteins. No post-translational modifications of the P proteins have been reported other than a single phosphorylation site located at serine 96 in P1α, P1β, and P2α and position 100 in P2β (7Zambrano R. Briones E. Remacha M. Ballesta J.P.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14439-14446Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation is not believed to be a requirement for their association with the ribosomal particle (7Zambrano R. Briones E. Remacha M. Ballesta J.P.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14439-14446Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It has also been proposed, however, that phosphorylation is involved in degradation of P1 proteins and that it may affect expression of certain proteins by altering the translation of specific mRNAs (8Rodriguez-Gabriel M.A. Remacha M. Ballesta J.P.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 1998: 16620-16626Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 9Nusspaumer G. Remacha M. Ballesta J.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6075-6084Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The stability in solution of the stalk complex from yeast is established as significantly lower than that of its bacterial counterparts (10Saenz-Robles M. Remacha M. Vilella M. Zinker S. Ballesta J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1050: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and consequently has not been isolated as an intact species. It is also established that the stalk proteins from yeast are capable of exchanging with free proteins in the cytoplasmic pool (11Ballesta J. Remacha M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 55: 157-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The stalk complex is associated with the S. cerevisiae ribosomes via interactions of P0 with L12. L12 is functionally equivalent to L11 from E. coli and binds to the same highly conserved rRNA region as L11 in E. coli, located immediately below the P0 binding site via a highly conserved rRNA binding domain. P0, the eukaryotic equivalent of bacterial L10, binds through its highly conserved C terminus to the stalk proteins (12Santos C. Ballesta J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20608-20614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), anchoring them to the ribosome. P0 has the same 11-amino acid C-terminal sequence as P1 and P2, and the phosphorylation site, Ser-302 in P0, is within this conserved C terminus. Examination of the stalk assembly both in vivo and in vitro has revealed that P2β is unable to bind to the ribosome in the absence of P1α; in contrast P1α is capable of binding to the particle in the absence of P2β (13Zurdo J. Parada P. van den Berg A. Nusspaumer G. Jimenez-Diaz A. Remacha M. Ballesta J.P.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8929-8934Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These results have been interpreted to suggest that assembly of the stalk complex is a coordinated process in which P1 proteins provide anchorage to the ribosome for the P2 proteins, whereas the P2 proteins confer functionality to the complex (13Zurdo J. Parada P. van den Berg A. Nusspaumer G. Jimenez-Diaz A. Remacha M. Ballesta J.P.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8929-8934Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Recent evidence has also shown that the heterodimer P1α-P2β is a stable entity in solution; this observation led to the proposal that the P proteins form dimers in the cytoplasm prior to assembly on the ribosome (14Tchorzewski M. Krokowski D. Boguszewska A. Liljas A. Grankowski N. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3399-3408Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, the precise order of events in the assembly of the stalk complex remains unclear. Previously we applied nanoflow electrospray ionization mass spectrometry to study intact E. coli ribosomes and showed that it is possible to maintain the noncovalent interactions between the three large RNA molecules and 54 proteins in the gas phase (15Benjamin D.R. Robinson C.V. Hendrick J.P. Hartl F.U. Dobson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7391-7395Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 16Rostom A.A. Fucini P. Benjamin D.R. Juenemann R.

Moreover, we established a correlation between the surface area of interaction of 50 S ribosomal proteins with ribosomal RNA and their propensity to dissociate in the gas phase of the mass spectrometer. Consistent with this finding, the most prominent peaks in the mass spectra of E. coli ribosomes are assigned to proteins from the stalk region, which do not interact directly with rRNA. Given this fact, the primary aim of the present study is to investigate the interactions in the stalk regions of ribosomes from wild type and variant strains of S. cerevisiae. We investigated the effect on the stalk complex of deletion of one or more P1/P2 proteins by introducing into the mass spectrometer ribosomes from three S. cerevisiae strains that do not have a full complement of P1 and P2 proteins: D5, in which P2β is absent; D7, in which P1α is absent; and D57, in which both P2β and P1α are absent. The results reveal post-translational modifications and have implications for assembly of the stalk complex. Preparation of Yeast Ribosomes—S. cerevisiae ribosomes were prepared according to the method described previously (17Zurdo J. Gonzalez C. Sanz J.M. Rico M. Remacha M. Ballesta J.P.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8935-8943Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, the S. cerevisiae strains used were wild type strain W303-1b and strains D5 (P2β absent), D7 (P1α absent), and D57 (P2β and P1α absent). D57 cells were produced by crossing D5 and D7 haploid strains followed by selection and isolation of colonies harboring two genetic markers (18Remacha M. Santos C. Bermejo B. Naranda T. Ballesta J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12061-12067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown to midlog phase in YEPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose). E. coli strain DH5α was grown in Luria Broth medium (1.0% bacto-tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl) and used for transformation and propagation of plasmids. The cells were broken with glass beads, and the extracts were centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 rpm. Ribosomes were prepared from high speed centrifugation of the pellet at 100,000 × g and were washed by centrifugation for 20 h at 45,000 rpm through a 20–40% sucrose gradient in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm MgCl2, 500 mm NH4Cl, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. 50 mm MgCl2 in the sucrose gradient was used to compensate for the high concentration of monovalent ions and was found to be optimal for removing nonribosomal proteins from the particles. The ribosomes were recovered in the pellet and were resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 80 mm KCl, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol (Buffer 1). Ioselectric Focusing—Ribosomes (500 μg) in ∼25 ml of Buffer 1 were treated with RNase (10 μg/μg of ribosomes) for about 1 h on ice. The sample was then lyophilized, dissolved in 20 ml of loading buffer (6% ampholytes, 8 m urea), and resolved by vertical 5% polyacrylamide isoelectric focusing in a 2.0–5.0 pH range as described previously (8Rodriguez-Gabriel M.A. Remacha M. Ballesta J.P.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 1998: 16620-16626Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Western Blotting—Western blotting was performed after proteins were separated on 15% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride 45 μm membranes (Immobilon, Millipore) as described previously (19Rodriguez-Gabriel M.A. Remacha M. Ballesta J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2130-2136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). P2α was detected using monoclonal antibody 1BE3 (20Vilella M.D. Remacha M. Ortiz B.L. Mendez E. Ballesta J.P.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Bound antibodies were located by detecting peroxidase activity using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences) and then exposed to film. Phosphatase Treatment—Ribosomes (500 μg) were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 10 units of alkaline phosphatase (Roche Applied Science) in 100 μl of SuRe/Cut buffer provided by the manufacturer. The sample was then supplemented with RNase A and processed as described previously for isoelectric focusing. Ribosomes treated similarly but in the absence of alkaline phosphatase were used as a control. Mass Spectrometry—For mass spectra 1 μm stock solutions (50 μl) were buffer-exchanged into 50 μl of 10 mm ammonium acetate using Bio-spin 6 chromatography columns (Bio-Rad) with a molecular mass cut-off at 6000 Da, equilibrated previously with 10 mm ammonium acetate at pH 7.0. Nanoflow capillaries were prepared as described previously (21Nettleton E.J. Sunde M. Lai V. Kelly J.W. Dobson C.M. Robinson C.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 553-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Spectra were recorded on modified Micromass LCT and QToF2 mass spectrometers (22Sobott F. Hernandez H. McCammon M.G. Tito M.A. Robinson C.V. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 1402-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) (Micromass UK Ltd., Manchester, UK). The capillary and cone voltages were maintained at 1800 and 80 volts, respectively, to observe in-source dissociation products from the ribosome. Pressure conditions were maintained in the LCT at 9 × 10–3 mbar in the analyzer, 3.2 × 10–7 mbar in the ToF, and 6 × 10–3 and 5 × 10–7 mbar in the QToF2. Tandem mass spectra were recorded on the QToF2 with a collision cell voltage of 150 V and a collision gas of argon at a pressure of 3.5 × 10–2 mbar. Analysis of mass spectra was performed with Masslynx, version 3.1 (Micromass UK Ltd.). The average masses of protein species were calculated from at least three charge states. All spectra were calibrated externally against spectra recorded for cesium iodide (100 mg/ml). The masses measured are centroided values. All mass spectra underwent minimal smoothing with no resolution enhancement and are the average of 5–20 2-s scans. Solutions of ribosomes from wild type S. cerevisiae at pH 7.0 in 10 mm ammonium acetate were introduced into the mass spectrometer, and spectra were recorded under conditions selected to induce in-source dissociation of proteins and complexes from the intact ribosome (see “Experimental Procedures”). A typical mass spectrum is shown in Fig. 1A. At high m/z values (above 4000 m/z), a series of broad peaks are observed corresponding to a species with a mass of 77,291 ± 7 Da. This mass is higher than that of any of the reported ribosomal proteins (23Lee S.-W. Berger S.J. Martinovic S. Pasa-Tolic L. Anderson G.A. Shen Y. Zhao R. Smith R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5942-5947Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), implying that it arises from association of proteins in a noncovalent complex. By analogy with our previous studies of bacterial ribosomes, the most likely origin of these peaks is from the dissociation of the intact stalk complex (15Benjamin D.R. Robinson C.V. Hendrick J.P. Hartl F.U. Dobson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7391-7395Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 16Rostom A.A. Fucini P. Benjamin D.R. Juenemann R. Nierhaus K.H. Hartl F.U. Dobson C.M. Robinson C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5185-5190Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). This mass is consistent with the overall stoichiometry P1α, P1β, P2α, P2β, and P0 (calculated mass of the unmodified pentamer, 77,154 Da). However it is not possible to confirm the precise composition of this complex from mass measurement alone because of extensive post-translational modifications of the P proteins (see below). To investigate the protein composition of the peaks assigned to the stalk complex, we therefore carried out a tandem mass spectrometry experiment to determine the dissociation products from a single charge state (19+). Activation of this complex yields the spectrum shown in Fig. 1B. For tandem mass spectrometry of multiprotein complexes, a universal mechanism for dissociation is emerging in which individual proteins or small molecules are released from the isolated complex to leave “stripped complexes” at higher m/z (24Aquilina J. Benesch J. Slingsby C. Robinson C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10611-10616Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). At the high m/z region of this spectrum, close to the peak that was isolated, a peak was assigned to a charge state of the pentameric complex (18+) arising from loss of positive charge (Fig. 1B) (presumably ammonium ions from the buffer employed in the introduction of the ribosome solution). A second series of ions can also be discerned, with the mass of the predominant peak consistent with the stalk complex with loss of P2β. The width of these high m/z peaks is also consistent with the loss of other P proteins, although the predominant series can be assigned to loss of P2β. At the low m/z region of the spectrum, Fig. 1C, the four individual P1 and P2 proteins are observed, consistent with their release from the intact stalk complex. Previous studies (25Ilag L.L. Westblade L.F. Deshayes C. Kolb A. Busby S.J.W. Robinson C.V. Structure. 2004; 12: 269-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that the extent to which individual proteins are released in tandem mass spectrometry is related to their location in the complex, such that those on the periphery of the complex are released prior to those located at the center. It is interesting to note that the intensity of the peaks assigned to the P2 proteins is greater than for the P1 proteins. It has been proposed that the P1 proteins interact strongly with P0 and that P2 proteins are associated with the stalk predominantly through interactions with P1 (see schematic representation of the interactions of the stalk proteins in Fig. 1) (17Zurdo J. Gonzalez C. Sanz J.M. Rico M. Remacha M. Ballesta J.P.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8935-8943Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Consequently, P2 proteins are released in preference to the P1 proteins, consistent with the location of P2 proteins on the periphery of the complex. Moreover, P0 is not observed in this spectrum in accord with its central position and number of interactions with the P1 proteins. These observations allow us to conclude that the charge state that was isolated from the 77-kDa complex contains all four of the P1 and P2 proteins. The difference in mass between the sum of the four P1/P2 proteins and the pentameric stalk is consistent with the presence of P0. Although it is not possible from these experiments to rule out the possibility of different combinations of P1/P2 proteins coexisting with the same stalk complex, recent data are consistent with homogeneous populations of ribosomes carrying a single copy of each of the P proteins (27Guarinos E. Santos C. Sanchez A. Qiu D.-Y. Remacha M. Ballesta J.P.G. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Taken together these results therefore establish that a population of ribosomes with the pentameric stalk complex is present in solution and demonstrate that the interactions between these proteins can be maintained in the mass spectrometer, despite their reduced stability when compared with their prokaryotic counterparts. At low m/z values the mass spectrum contains numerous peaks that can be assigned on the basis of mass to ribosomal proteins, with the most prominent in the spectra assigned to the acidic stalk proteins (Fig. 1A). In addition to these multiplet peaks, proteins P0 and L12 at the base of the stalk are readily observed. A minor series of peaks in the spectrum results from dissociation of the large subunit protein L1. Expansion of the low m/z region of the spectrum (Fig. 2) reveals in excess of 30 peaks over only ∼100 m/z units. The complexity in this spectrum derives from multiple metal ions binding to the proteins that in addition have a number of post-translational modifications. A common observation for many of the neighboring peaks is that they are separated by a mass of 22 Da. This could be due to either sodium adducts, often present in electrospray mass spectra, or to binding of divalent magnesium ions. Sodium and magnesium ions replace one and two protons, respectively, giving rise to identical unit mass differences of 22 Da in mass spectra. Since magnesium is present in the storage buffer to maintain associations between ribosomal subunits, and given that this is removed by the addition of chelating agents such as EDTA (data not shown), we conclude that the metal binding to the acidic proteins in S. cerevisiae ribosomes is magnesium. It is also important to note that the mass of two Mg2+ ions (44 Da) binding to the protein is not readily distinguished from the possibility of acetylation (42 Da) or trimethylation (42 Da), both established as post-translational modifications on other yeast ribosomal proteins (7Zambrano R. Briones E. Remacha M. Ballesta J.P.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14439-14446Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The distribution of adduct peaks assigned to the proteins, however, can enable the distinction to be made between potential post-translational modification and metal ion binding. For example in the case of the protein P2α, the peak 42 Da higher than the unmodified form could be assigned either to acetylation/trimethylation or to binding of two Mg2+ ions. However, this peak is significantly more intense than neighboring peaks assigned to binding of one and three Mg2+ ions. Such an increase in intensity of a single peak is indicative of a post-translational modification, in this case either acetylation or trimethylation. It is established from previous studies, however, that acetylation of the N terminus occurs only for P1 proteins (28Santos C. Ortiz-Reyes B. Naranda T. Remacha M. Ballesta J.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4231-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and has not been reported for P2 proteins. Based on all the above considerations the identity of the +42-Da peak of P2α is either the trimethylated form of the protein or, alternatively, contains an acetylation of an internal lysine residue. Similarly, L1 has only one additional peak (42 Da) and does not show other peaks that could be assigned to metal binding. This modification is therefore assigned to acetylation, consistent with previous studies (23Lee S.-W. Berger S.J. Martinovic S. Pasa-Tolic L. Anderson G.A. Shen Y. Zhao R. Smith R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5942-5947Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Precise definition of the post-translational modifications of the P proteins of ribosomes from wild type yeast is, however, extremely difficult because of the extensive overlap of the peaks and the overall complexity of the spectra. For example, the difference in mass between P1β and P2α is 78, such that P2α cannot be distinguished from P1β containing a phosphorylation or a combination of acetylation and magnesium ion binding. Similarly, modifications of P2α overlap with the peaks assigned to P1α. To overcome this problem and to examine the effects on the stability and interactions of the stalk proteins, we have recorded spectra for ribosomes deficient in specific P1 and P2 proteins. The mass spectrum recorded for yeast strain D57 (in which P1α and P2β are absent) is shown in Fig. 3B together with that of the wild type recorded under the same conditions for comparison (shown in Fig. 3A). It is apparent that by introducing ribosomes without the full complement of P proteins the complexity of the spectra is reduced. It is also apparent that compared with the spectra recorded for the stalk complex under tandem mass spectrometry conditions (Fig. 1C), many more proteins are released in accord with the high internal energy imparted to ribosomes under these in-source dissociation conditions. P2α and P1β proteins, P0 and L12, dissociate in the gas phase and form the predominant series in the spectra. An expansion of this spectrum (Fig. 4B) reveals an additional peak 80 Da higher than that assigned to P2α, consistent with phosphorylation. Also apparent is a peak assigned to trimethylation of phosphorylated P2α. This modified form of P2α-PO3 is the major species present; very little nonphosphorylated protein is observed. There is no evidence of phosphorylation of P1β.Fig. 4Expansion of the region from m/z 1750 to 1990 enabling comparison of the 6+-charge state of the P proteins, from ribosomes of the wild type strain (A) and strains D57 (B), D7 (C), and D5 (D). The spectra of the deletion mutants (B–D) are less complex than those of ribosomes from the wild type and contain significantly less overlapping peaks, such that post-translational modifications are more readily identified.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Mass spectra recorded for ribosomes from strains lacking P1α (D7) and P2β (D5) (Fig. 3, C and D) and in expanded form (Fig. 4, C and D), respectively, were also compared with spectra recorded for wild type (Figs. 3A and 4A). The same post-translational modifications identified in the spectra of D57 are observed, including the phosphorylation and trimethylation of P2α. Comparison of the ratio of the modified forms of the proteins between the various D strains reveals closely similar relative intensities. There is, however, some variation in intensity when comparing the spectra of ribosomes from the D strains with the wild type. It should be noted, however, that this variation cannot be interpreted in terms of absolute quantities of the various proteins but rather is attributed to the ease with which the proteins dissociate from the various ribosomes. Surprisingly, however, the proteins P1α and P2β are not observed in spectra recorded for ribosomes from any of the three D strains. This was unexpected since in strain D5 the gene expressing P1α has not been deleted and in D7 P2β is expressed. It is also noteworthy that the peaks assigned to the stalk complex, observed for ribosomes from the wild type strain, could not be observed for ribosome solutions from the various D stains under any mass spectrometry conditions, emphasizing the importance of the full complement of P proteins for the stability of the stalk pentamer. We investigated the apparent absence of P1α and P2β in strains D5 and D7, respectively, using isoelectric focusing (IEF) 1The abbreviation used is: IEF, isoelectric focusing. (Fig. 5A). We compared strain D7 with wild type and found the expected band for P2β and the absence of a band assigned to P1α. Similarly, IEF was used to confirm the presence of P1α but not P2β in strain D5 (data not shown). The question arises as to why these proteins are not detected in the mass spectra of the D strains. A possible explanation is"

An additional seven Fn-binding segments have been predicted in FnBPA in a region N-terminal of the D-repeats (Schwarz-Linek, U., Werner, J. M., Pickford, A. R., Gurusiddappa, S., Kim, J. H., Pilka, E. S., Briggs, J. A., Gough, T. S., Höök, M., Campbell, I. D., and Potts, J. R. (2003) Nature 423, 177–181). We have evaluated the requirements for high affinity binding of N29 to the D-repeat domain and determined the affinity and stoichiometry of N29 binding to segments that are N-terminal of the D-repeats in the related FnBPB adhesin. We confirmed that D1–3 has two equivalent high affinity sites (Kd, ∼1 nm) and provided evidence for one or more lower affinity sites (Kd, ∼0.5 μm). Bimodular D1–2 and D2–3 exhibit intermediate affinity sites with respective Kd values of 0.25 and 0.044 μm, as well as a low affinity site with a Kd value of 2.2–2.5 μm. We also identified two binding domains that are N-terminal of the D-repeats, designated DuB and DuA. Segments internal to these domains individually bound N29 with similar Kd values of ∼2 μm, whereas the DuBA polypeptide possessing both segments and other intervening sites bound four molecules of N29 with much higher affinity (Kd, ∼10 nm). DuBAD, a larger polypeptide harboring all of the known or predicted binding motifs in FnBPB, bound seven to eight molecules of N29, with a Kd of ∼7 nm. Because most of the isolated binding segments display low affinity for N29 and lack motifs for binding of one or both of the 1F1 and 5F1 modules in the N-terminal domain of Fn, we propose that high affinity is achieved in part as a consequence of self-interaction between bound molecules of N29.

Staphylococcus aureus is the leading overall cause of nosocomial infections and is able to infect virtually every tissue and organ system of the body (1Lowy F.D. N. Engl. J.

In this regard, members of the microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (MSCRAMM) 1The abbreviations used are: MSCRAMM, microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules; Fn, fibronectin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; ECM, extracellular matrix. 1The abbreviations used are: MSCRAMM, microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules; Fn, fibronectin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; ECM, extracellular matrix. family of adhesion proteins have come under intensive scrutiny due to their ability to promote adhesion to the extracellular matrix that surrounds and anchors cells in tissue (4Foster T.J.

The fibronectin-binding proteins FnBPA and FnBPB are archetypal members of the MSCRAMM family and are encoded by tandem genes fnbA and fnbB (6Jonsson K. Signas C. Muller H.P. Lindberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 7Signas C. Raucci G. Jonsson K. Lindgren P.E. Anantharamaiah G.M. Höök M. Lindberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). As exemplified by FnBPA, members of the MSCRAMM family display a modular architecture (Fig. 1A). Following the traditional domain nomenclature first used to describe FnBPA (7Signas C. Raucci G. Jonsson K. Lindgren P.E. Anantharamaiah G.M. Höök M. Lindberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), the N terminus is a region of ∼500 amino acids designated the A domain, which is followed by the B-region composed of two 30-amino acid repeats, a short spacer designated C, and then the D-repeat domain composed of three complete 37- or 38-amino acid repeats and part of a fourth repeat. The C terminus of FnBPA and other MSCRAMMs is dedicated to anchoring the proteins within the peptidoglycan layer of the Gram-positive cell wall. Initial studies established that the D-repeat domain of FnBPA engaged a 29-kDa N-terminal domain (N29) of Fn, with an affinity in the low nanomolar range (7Signas C. Raucci G. Jonsson K. Lindgren P.E. Anantharamaiah G.M. Höök M. Lindberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). We subsequently found that the individual D1 and D2 repeats each bound N29 with Kd values of ≈11–14 μm, compared with a Kd of ≈2 μm for the D3 repeat, and a recombinant polypeptide possessing the three D-repeats in tandem (D1–3) displayed a high affinity of 1.5 nm (8Huff S. Matsuka Y.V. McGavin M.J. Ingham K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15563-15570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas this suggested that the three tandem D-repeats were required to form a structure that is favorable for high affinity ligand binding, circular dichroism analyses indicated that the D1–3 domain was primarily unstructured in solution, acquiring extensive β structure only when bound to N29 (9House-Pompeo K. Xu Y. Joh D. Speziale P. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1379-1384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). MSCRAMMs from Groups A and C streptococci also possess repetitive motifs that bind N29 (10Lindmark H. Jacobsson K. Frykberg L. Guss B. Infect.

Gurusiddappa S. Lindgren P.E. Lindberg M. Raucci G. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23946-23953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The N29 fragment is itself composed of five tandem type I modules, 1F1-5F1. Each module is a β-sandwich composed of two antiparallel β-sheets, with β-strands A and B forming a two-stranded sheet, and β-strands C, D, and E comprising a three-stranded sheet (15Potts J.R. Bright J.R. Bolton D. Pickford A.R. Campbell I.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8304-8312Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This three-stranded β-sheet in each of the 1F1 and 2F1 modules of N29 is the ligand for a 25-mer synthetic peptide B3T derived from the Streptococcus dysgalactiae FnbB MSCRAMM, which bound the 1–2F1 module pair with a Kd of 1.0 μm (16Schwarz-Linek U. Werner J.M. Pickford A.R. Gurusiddappa S. Kim J.H. Pilka E.S. Briggs J.A. Gough T.S. Höök M. Campbell I.D. Potts J.R. Nature. 2003; 423: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The B3T peptide displayed an extended linear conformation containing two β-strands, each of which contributed a fourth strand to the triple-stranded β-sheets in 1F1 and 2F1, forming an antiparallel β-zipper. Within the B3T peptide, a cluster of alternating hydrophobic amino acids (LSIHFD-NEWP) formed contacts with tyrosine and leucine residues in 1F1, and this was preceded by an acidic motif, EDS, that engaged a basic patch in 2F1. Knowledge of these binding specificities, together with the previous identification of additional acidic and hydrophobic amino acids that are involved in ligand binding (14McGavin M.J. Gurusiddappa S. Lindgren P.E. Lindberg M. Raucci G. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23946-23953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also enabled the identification of putative 5F1- and 4F1-binding motifs in several different MSCRAMM-derived peptides. Based on these known and predicted interactions, the ability of a 50-mer synthetic peptide derived from the R-repeats of the Streptococcus pyogenes SfBI adhesin to bind N29 with high affinity was proposed to involve an extended antiparallel β-zipper spanning all five F1 modules (16Schwarz-Linek U. Werner J.M. Pickford A.R. Gurusiddappa S. Kim J.H. Pilka E.S. Briggs J.A. Gough T.S. Höök M. Campbell I.D. Potts J.R. Nature. 2003; 423: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). This was supported by showing that three consecutive overlapping synthetic peptides derived from the larger 50-mer could each bind the respective 1–2F1, 2–3F1, or 4–5F1 bimodular F1 constructs with low affinity (Kd, 0.4–113 μm), whereas the intact 50-mer bound N29 (1–5F1) with high affinity (Kd, 2 nm), and a peptide lacking only the C-terminal 1F1-binding motif was of intermediate affinity (Kd, 0.062 μm). These findings collectively suggested that (i) conserved motifs promote the binding of specific F1 modules, (ii) short peptide segments with putative motifs specific for only two F1 modules will display low affinity ligand binding, (iii) high affinity binding requires that all five F1 modules are engaged in a tandem β-zipper, and (iv) the absence of a single F1-binding motif causes a significant reduction in affinity for N29. Although this model is well suited to the S. pyogenes fibronectin-binding MSCRAMM, it leaves a number of issues unresolved for the FnBPA and FnBPB adhesins of S. aureus. Although FnBPA was predicted to possess 11 distinct Fn-binding segments based on the occurrence of appropriately spaced putative F1-binding motifs, the first 7 of these segments are N-terminal of the D-repeats and were either previously not known to bind Fn or not well characterized in terms of affinity and specificity. Additionally, although the recombinant D1–3 polypeptide binds N29 with high affinity, an obvious 1F1-binding motif does not occur anywhere in the FnBPA adhesin, and a putative 5F1-binding motif does not occur outside of the D-repeat domain (16Schwarz-Linek U. Werner J.M. Pickford A.R. Gurusiddappa S. Kim J.H. Pilka E.S. Briggs J.A. Gough T.S. Höök M. Campbell I.D. Potts J.R. Nature. 2003; 423: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Hence, the majority of the predicted binding segments lack putative motifs for binding of 5F1 and 1F1 and, according to the model that was proposed, should not support high affinity ligand binding. In this regard, the goal of our present study was to define the minimal requirement for high affinity ligand binding by the repetitive D-repeat domain and to determine whether binding segments that are N-terminal of the D-repeats are capable of high affinity ligand binding. Using bimodular D1–2 or D2–3 polypeptides, we show that the affinity is comparable with that observed for a previously described peptide derived from the SfbI adhesin of S. pyogenes that engages only four F1 modules (2–5F1) but is still an order of magnitude less than that of the D1–3 domain. Furthermore, using either soluble Fn or keratinocyte ECM as a selection method to screen a phage-display library of S. aureus genomic DNA, we isolated two distinct binding regions that are N-terminal of the D-repeats. These regions designated DuA and DuB harbored minimal binding segments DuARI and DuBRI that individually bind N29 with low affinity but, when combined as a recombinant DuBA polypeptide, display an affinity that is comparable with the D-repeats, despite their apparent lack of 1F1- and 5F1-binding motifs. Combining DuBA with D1–3 produced a polypeptide, DuBAD, that had seven or eight high affinity binding sites for N29, close to the number of predicted binding segments. Thus, our data are consistent with multiple functional ligand-binding segments in the FnBP adhesins, located in two separate high affinity domains. However, we cannot completely rationalize the observed high affinity ligand binding with the previously proposed model, and we suggest that interaction between bound molecules of N29 might contribute to high affinity binding. Bacterial Strains, Growth Conditions, and Keratinocyte Cell Culture—Multidrug-resistant S. aureus strain CMRSA-1B (isolate-317) has been described elsewhere (17Huesca M. Peralta R. Sauder D.N.

Stock cultures of S. aureus and E. coli were maintained at -70 °C in 15% glycerol and grown in brain-heart infusion (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI) or 2YT (Difco Laboratories) broth, respectively. 2YT was supplemented with 25 μg·ml-1 kanamycin (2YTK) when required for infection of E. coli TG1 with M13K07 helper phage and with 50 μg·ml-1 ampicillin (2YTA) for selection of plasmid vectors. Media were supplemented with 15 g of agar liter-1 for preparation of solid media. All cultures were grown at 37 °C, in a static incubator for agar cultures, and a shaker-incubator with agitation at 250 rpm for liquid cultures. When grown for specific assays, the optical density of overnight cultures was measured at 600 nm (S. aureus) or 540 nm (E. coli), followed by subculturing into appropriate pre-warmed medium to achieve an initial absorbance of 0.1. Normal human keratinocytes were obtained from neonatal foreskin and maintained in serum-free keratinocyte growth medium supplemented with bovine pituitary extract and recombinant epidermal growth factor (Invitrogen) (19Kondo S. Kono T. Sauder D.N. McKenzie R.C. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 690-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Trypsinized cells were adjusted to a density of 2 × 104 cells/ml-1, and 100-μl aliquots were transferred into wells of 96-well flat-bottom cell culture plates (Co-star Corning, Corning, NY). When the cells had achieved confluence, ECM was exposed by treating the monolayers with 0.5%Triton X-100 for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by 25 mm ammonium hydroxide for 10 min as described elsewhere (20Huesca M.

Microbiology. 1998; 144: 985-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Lars Frykberg and is designed such that blunt end ligation of randomly sonicated genomic DNA fragments into a unique SnaBI site of the vector will promote expression of cloned fragments as an N-terminal fusion to the M13 phage coat protein gpVIII. A library of ≈0.6–0.7-kb fragments of sonicated genomic DNA from S. aureus CMRSA-1B strain 317 was constructed in pG8SAET following established methods (22Jacobsson K. Frykberg L. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 878-885PubMed Google Scholar, 23Jacobsson K. Frykberg L. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 1070-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), producing ≈1 × 107 ampicillin-resistant transformants, which was then amplified in E. coli TG1 to yield a phage titer of 3.3 × 1011 ampicillin transducing units·ml-1. For binding of soluble Fn, an aliquot of phagemid library containing ≈1010 ampicillin transducing units was incubated for 1 h with 10 μg of biotinylated Fn in 500 μl of PBS. Phage particles containing bound Fn where then captured with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Magna Bindä Streptavidin; Pierce), and after extensive washing with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, bound phage were eluted in 0.1 m glycine-HCl (pH 2.3) and then neutralized with 2 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, and used to reinfect E. coli TG1 cells. Amplified phage were then subjected to a second round of selection using an identical protocol. For selection on keratinocyte ECM, ∼1010 ampicillin transducing units of phage diluted in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin were added to triplicate wells of a 96-well cell culture plate containing exposed keratinoctye ECM. After a 1-h incubation at room temperature with gentle agitation, the wells were washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, followed by elution of bound phage in low pH buffer and amplification in E. coli TG1 for a second round of screening. For both protocols, phage recovered from the second round of selection were used to infect E. coli TG1 cells, and cells were plated on 2YTA. Clones expressing functional fusion proteins were identified by colony blots using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated E-tag monoclonal antibody (Amersham Biosciences), specific for an epitope incorporated into pG8SAET immediately before the fusion site with the M13 phage gene VIII sequence. DNA Sequence Analyses—Sequencing of phagemid DNA was performed by the University of Toronto Hospital for Sick Children DNA sequencing facility. Nucleotide sequences were analyzed using the MacVector program (Oxford Molecular, Oxford, UK), and the translated protein sequences were subjected to BLAST homology searches using the search engine provided by the National Center for Biotechnology Information, including access to S. aureus genome sequences. 2www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/genom_table.cgi. Expression of Recombinant Fusion Proteins—Oligonucleotide primers PG8-F (5′-cccggatccAATGCTGCGCAACACGATGACC-3′) and PG8-R (5′-CTGAGGCTTGCAGGGAGTCAAAGG-3′), which flank the SnaBI cloning site of pG8SAET, were employed in PCR with phagemid DNA isolated from a clone designated DuB. The forward primer contains an added BamHI site (in lowercase bold letters) that is in-frame with the Protein A leader sequence of pG8SAET. A second BamHI site is provided by a small segment of amplified vector sequence, such that when cloned in the correct orientation in BamHI-digested pGEX2T (Amersham Biosciences), the amplicon is expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion protein GST-DuB, encoding the complete DuB domain as presented in Fig. 1. Primers PG8-F and DuBΔC-R (5′-ggggaattcAATAGAATCTTCTTCAGTTTC-3′) were employed to amplify a 3′-truncation of the original DuB clone. When cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX2T, the resulting plasmid pGEX2T-DuBΔC directs the expression of fusion protein GST-DuBΔC, containing a 26-amino acid C-terminal deletion of the DuB polypeptide. Similarly, primer DuBΔN-F (5′-cccggatccGGGGTTGCATTTTACTC-3′) was paired with PG8-R to produce an amplicon that was cloned into the BamHI site of pGEX2T, creating pGEX2T-DuBΔN and corresponding fusion protein GST-DuBΔN, lacking 26 N-terminal amino acids of DuB. An amplicon harboring both 5′- and 3′-deletions was prepared by inverse PCR of plasmid pGEX-DuBΔN, with forward primer 5′-GAATATGAAGAGGATACAAAC-3′ and reverse primer DuBΔC-R. After digestion with EcoRI and self-ligation, the resulting plasmid pGEX-DuBΔNC directs the expression of fusion protein GST-DuBΔNC containing 26-amino acid deletions at both the Nand C terminus of the original DuB clone. Plasmid pGEX-DuBR1 containing a single internal repeat motif of the DuB domain was constructed by inverse PCR of plasmid pGEX-DuBΔC with forward primer 5′-cccggatccGGTACAATCGAAGAAAGTAACG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CCTGAAAGATGTGTTGTACTGCC-3′. After digestion with BamHI and self-ligation, the resulting plasmid directs the expression of fusion protein GST-DuBRI harboring a 38-amino acid internal segment of the original DuB domain. DNA encoding the contiguous DuB, DuA, and D1–3 domains of the FnBPB adhesin of S. aureus 8325–4 was amplified by PCR of genomic DNA with primers FnbB-F1 (5′-cccggatccGGCGTTGCATTTTACTC-3′) and FnbB-R1 (5′-cccaagcttATTATGACCACTTACTTGTGG-3′), spanning nucleotides 1906–1922 and 2893–2913, respectively, of the fnbB gene (6Jonsson K. Signas C. Muller H.P. Lindberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The 1.09-kb amplicon was cloned initially into pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) and then excised with BamHI and EcoRI, employing restriction sites provided by the forward primer and pCR2.1, respectively, such that the EcoRI end at the 3′-end of the insert is preceded by the HindIII site incorporated by the FnbB-R1 primer. This fragment was cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX2T, creating plasmid pGEX-DuBAD and fusion protein GST-DuBAD. The D-repeats were deleted from pGEX-DuBAD by inverse PCR with a forward primer that is the reverse and complement of FnbB-R1 and reverse primer 5′-cccaagcttATGTTCTTCAGGTAGTTCATC-3′, spanning nucleotides 2400–2380 of the S. aureus fnbB gene (6Jonsson K. Signas C. Muller H.P. Lindberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). After digestion with HindIII and self-ligation, the resulting pGEX-DuBA plasmid directs the expression of fusion protein GST-DuBA. For plasmids constructed by inverse PCR, amplification was performed with the Expand Long-Template PCR reagent system following recommended protocols, whereas all other PCR reactions were performed with Ampli-Taq Gold DNA polymerase. Protein Purification—Fibronectin was purified from human plasma by affinity chromatography on gelatin-Sepharose as described previously (24Miekka S.I. Ingham K.C. Menache D. Thromb. Res. 1982; 27: 1-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) and, where indicated, digested with thermolysin for subsequent generation of fragments (25Borsi L. Castellani P. Balza E. Siri A. Pellecchia C. De Scalzi F. Zardi L. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), including the 29-kDa N-terminal fragment that was purified as described previously (8Huff S. Matsuka Y.V. McGavin M.J. Ingham K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15563-15570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression and purification of glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins, including the previously described GST-D1–2 and GST-D2–3 harboring the tandem D1 and D2 repeats or D2 and D3 repeats, respectively, of the FnBPA adhesin of S. aureus 8325–4, were conducted as described previously (20Huesca M. Sun Q. Peralta R. Shivji G.M. Sauder D.N. McGavin M.J. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). All fusion proteins were treated with thrombin to release the recombinant ligand binding domains and then further purified by anion exchange chromatography (20Huesca M. Sun Q. Peralta R. Shivji G.M. Sauder D.N. McGavin M.J. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Peptide Synthesis—Synthetic peptides DuARI (NPGGGQVTTESNLVEFDEESTKGIVTGAVSDHTTVEDTKE) and DuBRI (GTIEESNDSKPIDFEYHTAVEGSEGHVEGTIETEEDSI) were synthesized with C-terminal amides by the University of Toronto Health Sciences Centre peptide synthesis core facility. Reverse phase chromatography of each peptide indicated a major product with the expected molecular mass values of 4178.2 and 4151.1 Da, as determined by analysis on a Voyager mass spectrometer. Protein and Peptide Labeling—Purified human plasma Fn was labeled with biotinamidocaproate N-hydroxysuccinamide ester (Sigma) as described previously (26McGavin M.J. Zahradka C. Rice K. Scott J.E. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 2621-2628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FITC-D1–3 was prepared as described previously (8Huff S. Matsuka Y.V. McGavin M.J. Ingham K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15563-15570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other fluorescent recombinant or synthetic peptides were prepared by incubation with a 10-fold molar excess of FITC in 0.2 m NaHCO3, pH 8.5, for 3 h at 37 °C. Excess dye was removed by chromatography on small size-exclusion columns. The degree of labeling was determined optically as described previously (27Ingham K.C. Brew S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 670: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The concentrations of FITC-DuBA and DuBAD stock solutions were based on the amount of valine determined by amino acid analysis. Affinity Chromatography—Synthetic peptides DuAR1, DuBRI, and D3 were coupled to cross-linked bis-acrylamide/azlactone copolymer beads employing the protocols and reagents provided with the UltraLink Immobilization Kit (Pierce). Thermolysin-digested Fn was then applied to the affinity matrices, which were then washed extensively with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl and 10 mm EDTA and then eluted in wash buffer containing 6 m urea. Protein-containing fractions as determined by A280 were pooled and subjected to SDS-PAGE to visualize Fn fragments retained by the affinity matrices. Competitive Inhibition Assays—Competitive inhibition assays were performed in Corning 96-well microtiter plates with wash buffer consisting of PBS containing 0.05% (v/v-1) Tween 20, a blocking solution of 3% (w/v-1) bovine serum albumin in PBS, and dilution buffer consisting of PBS supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. To assay binding of biotinylated Fn to recombinant GST-DuB, triplicate wells of microtiter plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with 100 μl of 1.0 μg·ml-1 GST-DuB, diluted in carbonate-bicarbonate buffer. After washing and blocking, wells were incubated with the indicated concentrations of biotinylated Fn for 1 h at room temperature on an orbital shaker. For competitive inhibition assays, biotinylated Fn was preincubated with soluble GST-DuB and its derivatives before addition to microtiter plates. After a 60-min incubation on a rocking platform, the wells were washed extensively, followed by addition of 5,000-fold diluted alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin (Roche Applied Science). Wells were again incubated for 60 min, washed extensively, and developed with 1 mg·ml-1para-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate. Plates were read after 60 min on a Bio-Rad model 3550 microplate reader equipped with a 405 nm filter. Data are expressed as either the mean absorbance values (A405) of triplicate wells or a percentage of the A405 value determined in the absence of specific competitor. Fluorescent Titrations—All titrations were performed in TBS (0.02 m Tris and 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4), pH 7.4, at 25 °C. Stock solutions of the N-terminal 29-kDa Fn fragment (N29) were added continuously to a stirred cuvette containing the FITC-labeled peptide while monitoring the anisotropy at 524 nm with excitation at 493 nm as described previously (8Huff S. Matsuka Y.V. McGavin M.J. Ingham K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15563-15570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting concentration-dependent increases in anisotropy were fit to one of several equations. Data for the single motif peptides, DuAR1 and DuBR1, were fit to a simple binding isotherm, Equation 1 of Huff et al. (8Huff S. Matsuka Y.V. McGavin M.J. Ingham K.C."

The Elements of DNA Replication TimingJournal of Biological ChemistryVol. 279Issue 40PreviewBefore a cell can divide, it must duplicate its DNA. In eukaryotes, DNA replication origins fire at specific times throughout S phase, causing each segment of the genome to replicate at a precise time. Studies in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) have suggested that by default replication origins fire early in S phase, but they can be forced to fire later by flanking and internal cis-acting sequences. Now, Chulee Yompakdee and Joel A. Huberman have discovered a 200-bp cis-acting sequence that verifies this hypothesis. Full-Text PDF Open Access DNA replication origins in most eukaryotic cells fire at specific times during S phase, from early to late. Consequently, each segment of the genome replicates at a precise time during S phase. It is thought that this DNA replication timing program may be important for gene regulation, because changes in gene expression are in some cases associated with changes in replication timing (1Zhang J. Xu F. Hashimshony T. Keshet I. Cedar H. Nature. 2002; 420: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Maintenance of replication timing may also be important for preventing cancer, because disruptions of the replication timing program in human peripheral blood lymphocytes are tightly correlated with renal (2Dotan Z.A. Dotan A. Litmanovitch T. Ravia Y. Oniashvili N. Leibovitch I. Avivi J.R.L. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2000; 27: 270-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), prostate (3Dotan Z.A. Dotan A. Ramon J. Avivi L. Int. J. Cancer. 2004; 111: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and perhaps other cancers. For these reasons, it is important to understand the mechanisms that control origin firing times. Unfortunately, little is currently known about them. Studies in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) have suggested that the default firing time of most origins is early, and origins can be forced to fire later in S phase by flanking (4Friedman K.L. Diller J.D. Ferguson B.M. Nyland S.V.M. Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1595-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and internal (5Sharma K. Weinberger M. Huberman J.A. Genetics. 2001; 159: 35-45PubMed Google Scholar) cis-acting sequences or by chromosome ends (6Ferguson B.M. Fangman W.L. Cell. 1992; 68: 333-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which chromosome ends control replication timing has not yet been elucidated, and, with the exception of sequences that affect the affinity of origin recognition complex for its binding sites at origins (7Palacios DeBeer M.A. Muller U. Fox C.A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), other cis-acting sequences that can force origins far from telomeres to fire late have not yet been defined. Previous results suggest that chromatin structure plays a major, but apparently not a completely determining, role in regulating replication timing. Euchromatic regions frequently replicate early, while heterochromatic regions usually replicate late (8Lima-de-Faria A. Jaworska H. Nature. 1968; 217: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 9Gomez M. Brockdorff N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6923-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Because there are significant exceptions to this correlation (10Kim S.-M. Dubey D.D. Huberman J.A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), better evidence for the importance of chromatin structure for replication timing is provided by recent studies in budding yeast, which have shown that genetic alterations affecting chromatin structure can have dramatic effects on the replication times of many genomic regions (11Stevenson J.B. Gottschling D.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 146-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 12Vogelauer M. Rubbi L. Lucas I. Brewer B.J. Grunstein M. Mol.

Biol. 2002; 12: 869-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 14Aparicio J.G. Viggiani C.J. Gibson D.G. Aparicio O.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4769-4780Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Thus it is reasonable to suggest that the ill-defined cis-acting sequences that are capable of forcing origins to fire in late S phase (see above) may act by promoting the formation of chromatin structures that favor late replication. Determining whether this hypothesis is correct will require better definition of the cis-acting sequences that affect replication timing. To help identify and characterize such cis-acting sequences, we turned to the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe. DNA replication origins in fission yeast are larger (500–1500 bp) than those in budding yeast (100–250 bp) (15Masukata H. Huberman J.A. Frattini M.G. Kelly T.J. Egel R. The Molecular Biology of Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2004: 73-99Crossref Google Scholar). We suspected that cis-acting sequences controlling replication timing might be included in such larger fission yeast origins. Here we report that ars727, a fission yeast origin that normally replicates in late S phase, does indeed contain cis-acting sequences that are responsible for its late replication. Furthermore, when placed near ars3001, a fission yeast origin that normally replicates in early S phase, these sequences proved capable of forcing ars3001 to fire in late S phase. We localized the important cis-acting sequences in ars727, and we found that they are contained in a stretch of 200 bp. Within this stretch, we noticed that three matches to a 10-bp late consensus sequence (LCS) 1The abbreviations used are: LCS, late consensus sequence; ARS, autonomously replicating sequence (a replication origin); HU, hydroxyurea. are especially important determinants of replication timing. Strains and Media—We used the Escherichia coli strains DH5α (Invitrogen) for general subcloning, XL1-Blue (Stratagene) for construction of plasmid pLS1.2, and INVαF′ (Invitrogen) for propagating the pCRII vector. We used the S. pombe D18 strain (ura4-D18 leu1–32 end1 h-) (16Grimm C. Kohli J. Murray J. Maundrell K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1988; 215: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) grown in YES (complete) medium (17Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 194: 795-823Google Scholar). To select for cells transformed to ura+, we used EMMS-Ura medium (17Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 194: 795-823Google Scholar). Yeast Transformation—D18 cells were transformed as described (18Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Yeast. 1991; 7: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Construction of Mono- and Bi-autonomously Replicating Sequence (ARS) Plasmids—pARS3001 contains a 573-bp version of ars3001 cloned between the BamHI and ClaI sites of YIp5 (GenBank™ accession number L09157) and was previously constructed in our laboratory (19Kim S.-M. Huberman J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7294-7303Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To construct other mono- and bi-ARS plasmids, we used standard molecular techniques. The procedures and oligonucleotides employed for these constructions are described in detail in the Supplemental Procedures and in Supplemental Table I. Generation of Mutant Versions of Mono- and Bi-ARS Plasmids—Deletion, linker substitution, and other types of mutations were generated by standard molecular techniques and are described in detail in the Supplemental Procedures and in Supplemental Table I. Determination of Plasmid Structure in S. pombe—After transfection of mono- or bi-ARS plasmids into fission yeast cells, the Ura+ transformants were cultivated in 10 ml selective medium (EMMS-Ura) with shaking at 30 °C until saturation. The cells were pelleted, and DNA samples were prepared by the “Smash and Grab” method (20Hoffman C.S. Winston F. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 57: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2057) Google Scholar). The DNA pellets were resuspended in 40 μl of TE (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) containing 100 μg/ml RNase A. Half of the sample (20 μl) was digested with PstI. Undigested DNA (20 μl) and digested DNA were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 0.8% agarose gel in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) (65 volts, 3 h). The gel was then blotted to a nylon membrane, which was hybridized with a YIp5 probe to detect plasmid molecules. In all cases, only the predicted PstI fragments (3.1 and 2.4 kb) were detected, and these were detected in equimolar ratio, indicating that the only possible plasmid rearrangments were multimerizations. The sizes of the bands generated by mono-ARS plasmids indicated that multimerization had taken place, while the sizes of the bands generated by bi-ARS plasmids in most cases indicated that monomeric plasmids were retained. Cell Synchronization by Hydroxyurea Block and Release—The Ura+ plasmid-containing cells from freezer stocks were grown in EMMS-Ura with shaking at 30 °C. One liter of log phase culture (0.8–1.4 × 107 cells/ml) was prepared and harvested. The cell pellets were resuspended in 1 liter of prewarmed (30 °C) YES medium and incubated with shaking for 30 min. Then 500 μl of the cell suspension were collected and fixed in 1 ml of ethanol for flow cytometric DNA content analysis. The culture was treated with 25 mm hydroxyurea (United States Bio-chemical) for 3 h at 30 °C with shaking. Cells were harvested and washed twice with sterile prewarmed (30 °C) water. The cell pellets were resuspended in 1 liter each prewarmed (30 °C) YES medium, and five samples of 200 ml each were collected at either 10- or 15-min intervals. Each of the samples was immediately mixed with 20 ml of prechilled (0 °C) solution containing 1/3 (v/v) glycerol, 2/3 (v/v) 0.2 m EDTA, and 0.1% NaN3. Five-hundred μl of each chilled cell suspension were then fixed in 1 ml of ethanol for flow cytometric analysis. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation and washed once with cold sterile double-distilled water. The cell pellets were kept at -80 °C. Two-dimensional Gel Analyses—DNA preparation and neutral/neutral two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis were carried out as described previously (21Kim S.-M. Huberman J.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6115-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Five μg of each DNA sample were digested with a 5-fold excess of AlwNI and NcoI. Flow Cytometry—Evaluation of cell DNA content and cell cycle position by flow cytometry was carried out as described (21Kim S.-M. Huberman J.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6115-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Hybridization Probes—To determine the structures of plasmids inside transformed yeast cells, HindIII-digested YIp5 was used as probe. To detect plasmid replication intermediates, the 2.39-kb AlwNI-EcoRI fragment of YIp5 was used as probe. ARS Assays—ARS activity was measured as described previously (19Kim S.-M. Huberman J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7294-7303Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Two-hundred ng of each plasmid were used for each transformation. At least three independent repeats of each experiment were carried out. Computer Analysis of LCS Clusters—We used MacVector software to do subsequence searches for RKKGGGGGAW (where R = A or G, K = T or G, and W = A or T). We required perfect matches at all five central Gs (boldface), and we required perfect matches at three or more of the remaining five positions. Searches were run against regions of 20 kb or more centered on each of the origins indicated in Fig. 8 and Supplemental Table II. In the cases of extended origin-containing regions (such as the centromeres and the mating type region), we searched against the extended region plus an additional 10 kb at each end. LCS clusters were defined as three or more LCS matches (according to the above criteria) within an interval of 1,500 bp or less. Accession numbers for the searched sequences are provided in Supplemental Table II. Replication Timing of Mono-ARS Plasmids—Our first goal was to determine whether large fission yeast replication origin sequences can contain cis-acting sequences that affect their replication timing. For this purpose, we constructed two plasmids (Fig. 1A), each containing a single ARS element. ARS elements are stretches of chromosomal DNA that can serve as replication origins in plasmids. One of these mono-ARS plasmids (pARS3001) contained ars3001, which is the fission yeast rDNA replication origin. One copy of ars3001 is found in each of the 150–200 tandem ∼10-kb rDNA repeat units (19Kim S.-M. Huberman J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7294-7303Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 22Sanchez J.A. Kim S.-M. Huberman J.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), which are arranged in two clusters at the ends of chromosome III (Fig. 8). In its chromosomal location, ars3001 is replicated early in S phase by a combination of active origin firing and passive replication by forks coming from neighboring rDNA repeat units (21Kim S.-M. Huberman J.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6115-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The second mono-ARS plasmid (pARS727; Fig. 1A) contained ars727, which is a single-copy ARS element (see Fig. 2 for sequence) (23Maundrell K. Hutchison A. Shall S. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2203-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) located on chromosome II (Fig. 8). Replication timing measurements had shown that, in its normal chromosomal position, ars727 is passively replicated in mid to late S phase (21Kim S.-M. Huberman J.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6115-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The fact that ars727, a potential replication origin, is passively replicated in its normal chromosomal location led us to suspect that, like ARS301 and ARS302 in budding yeast (5Sharma K. Weinberger M. Huberman J.A. Genetics. 2001; 159: 35-45PubMed Google Scholar, 24Vujcic M. Miller C.A. Kowalski D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6098-6109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), ars727 might be programmed to fire so late in S phase that it would always be passively replicated by forks from neighboring earlier firing origins before it had a chance to fire on its own.Fig. 2The complete nucleotide sequence of ars727 (23Maundrell K. Hutchison A. Shall S. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2203-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This corresponds to nucleotides 3,338,897 to 3,339,716 on the complementary strand of S. pombe chromosome II (GenBank™ accession number NC_003423). The regions deleted in our consecutive deletion scan of ars727 are indicated. All of these regions contain 100 bp except for region 8, which contains 120 bp.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To test the firing times of ars3001 and ars727 in the plasmid context (Fig. 1A), we used a hydroxyurea block-and-release synchronization procedure (21Kim S.-M. Huberman J.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6115-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Hydroxyurea (HU) inhibits ribonucleotide reductase and prevents the synthesis of dNTPs. When cells enter S phase in the presence of HU, endogenous pools of dNTPs are rapidly exhausted. Only early origins fire, and replication forks move variable distances, usually no more than a few kb, away from the early origins (21Kim S.-M. Huberman J.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6115-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 25Santocanale C. Diffley J.F.X. Nature. 1998; 395: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). For the experiments reported here, we treated unsynchronized cells with HU for 3 h to permit them to accumulate in early S phase with early origins fired. Then, at 0 min, we removed the HU so that cells could continue through S phase. In the experiment in Fig. 1B, both cell lines completed S phase by 40 min after HU removal, as indicated by the flow cytometry profiles. Next, replication intermediates were separated from non-replicating DNA by two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis (26Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Cell. 1987; 51: 463-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Because both ars3001 and ars727 are weak, the plasmids containing them multimerized under selection pressure to increase the number of replication origins per plasmid. Under these conditions, only one origin fires per multimer; the other origins are replicated passively (27Schvartzman J.B. Adolph S. Martin-Parras L. Schildkraut C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3078-3086Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Consequently the major signal from replication intermediates has the form of a Y arc (as indicated in Fig. 1B). It is evident that the strongest Y arc signal from pARS3001 was detected in the 0-min sample (before release from the HU block) indicating that in the plasmid context, as in chromosome III, ars3001 fires in early S phase. In contrast, few or no replication intermediates were evident in the 0-min sample from pARS727. The maximum Y arc signal for pARS727 was detected in the 30-min time point, indicating that in the plasmid context ars727 fires in late S phase, even later than the time when it is passively replicated in chromosome II (21Kim S.-M. Huberman J.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6115-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Since pARS3001 and pARS727 differ only in their ARS elements, these results suggested that cis-acting sequences controlling replication timing must be present in one or both of the ARS elements. Replication Timing of Bi-ARS Plasmids—To learn more about these putative timing control sequences, we constructed four bi-ARS plasmids, representing the four possible relative orientations of the two ARS elements (ars3001 and ars727) side-by-side (Fig. 3A). Of these, one orientation (pBiARS#2; Fig. 3A) proved to replicate poorly in yeast cells due to diminished origin activity (data not shown). The other three orientations displayed enhanced origin activity, which permitted these plasmids to remain monomeric (as indicated by bubble arcs in two-dimensional gels, Fig. 3B, and by investigations of plasmid structure, data not shown). One of these orientations (pBiARS#1) replicated in early S phase but slightly later than pARS3001 (Fig. 3B). The other two orientations (pBiARS#3 and pBiARS#4) replicated in late S phase, similar to pARS727 (compare Fig. 1B with Fig. 3B). In pBiARS#3 and pBiARS#4 (but not in pBiARS#1), the cis-acting sequences within ars727 that enforce late replication timing appeared to be dominant over any cis-acting sequences within ars3001 that might encourage early replication. The robust bubble arcs generated in late S phase by pBi-ARS#3 and pBiARS#4 indicated that the late replication of these bi-ARS plasmids could not be due to repression of firing of ars3001. If ars3001 were not contributing to the replication of these bi-ARS plasmids, their replication efficiency would be determined solely by ars727, which on its own is a weak origin that cannot efficiently replicate monomeric plasmids. Plasmids dependent solely on ars727 for their replication tend to multimerize, leading to loss of bubble arc signal (as in Fig. 1B). Thus the late replication-determining sequences within ars727 must function at least in part by delaying the firing of ars3001 until late S phase rather than by inhibiting it. Effects of 100-bp Deletions on the Origin Activity of ars727—Our next goal, therefore, was to identify the late replication-determining sequences within ars727. The fact that pBiARS#3 contains two ARS elements permitted us to carry out saturation mutagenesis of ars727 and test the effect of each mutation on replication timing without losing the ability of the plasmid to replicate autonomously. In each case origin activity was supplied by the non-mutated ars3001. First we constructed a series of eight consecutive ∼100-bp deletions through the 820 bp of ars727 (Fig. 2). Before testing the effects of these deletions on replication timing in pBi-ARS#3, we used two assays to determine their effects on the ARS activity (activity as a plasmid replication origin) of ars727 in the mono-ARS plasmid, pARS727. Measurements of plasmid transformation frequency (Fig. 4A) and measurements of the growth rates of the transformed colonies as indicated by colony size (Fig. 4, A and B) indicated that deletion of region 1 (Δ1; the first 100 bp of ars727) slightly stimulated ARS activity; Δ2 and Δ8 had little effect; Δ3-Δ5 strongly inhibited ARS activity, and Δ6-Δ7 slightly inhibited ARS activity. Because regions 3–5 are particularly rich in asymmetric A+T-rich stretches (Fig. 2), which are known to form good binding sites for S. pombe origin recognition complex (28Chuang R.-Y. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2656-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 29Lee J.-K. Moon K.-Y. Jiang Y. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13589-13594Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 30Kong D. DePamphilis M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8095-8103Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), these experimental results are not surprising. Effects of 100-bp Deletions on the Replication Timing of pBi-ARS#3—Next we made the corresponding 100-bp deletions in the ars727 portion of pBiARS#3, and we measured their effects on replication timing. As illustrated in Fig. 5A, deletion of region 1 produced a complete shift from late replication to early replication. The early replication was efficient, because the plasmids remained monomeric (data not shown). However, during incubation in HU, most of the earliest (bubble-shaped) replication intermediates disappeared, because most of the forks moved far enough from the origin to convert the replication intermediates from bubble-shaped to late Y-shaped. In contrast to deletion of region 1, deletion of region 2 (Fig. 5A) produced only a partial shift; replication intermediates were most abundant in the 10-min time point rather than at 20–30 min as in non-mutated pBiARS#3 (Fig. 3B). Deletions of regions 3–8 had no detectable effect on replication timing (Fig. 5A and data not shown). Thus region 1 appeared to contain cis-acting sequences that were essential for late replication timing, while region 2 appeared to contain additional cis-acting sequences capable of stimulating late replication timing. Effects of Linker-Substitution Mutations on Replication Timing—To better localize these cis-acting sequences, we employed linker-substitution mutagenesis. Since deletion of region 1 had the most pronounced effect on replication timing, we constructed consecutive 10-bp XbaI linker-substitution mutations (GCTCTAGAGC) throughout region 1. Of these, pLS1.10, in which nucleotides 91–100 of ars727 (Fig. 2) were replaced by the XbaI linker, had the most pronounced effect on timing, but it was only a partial effect, similar to that of deleting region 2 (Fig. 5, A and B, and data not shown). We noticed that nucleotides 91–100 (GGTGGGGGAA), whose loss by linker substitution had the greatest effect on replication timing (Fig. 5B), resemble nucleotides 2–11 (GTGGGGGGAT in the bottom strand) and 112–121 (GGGGGGGGAA) of ars727 (Fig. 2). These three 10-bp sequences determine a consensus, GKKGGGGGAW, where K represents G or T, and W represents A or T. Because we found that the similar sequences in telomere-associated sequences, which replicate late (21Kim S.-M. Huberman J.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6115-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) (Fig. 8), frequently have A in the first position, we modified the consensus to RKKGGGGGAW, where R represents A or G. There are two exact matches to this consensus in region 1 of ars727 and one exact match in region 2. The fact that deletion of region 1 led to complete loss of late replication timing, while deletion of region 2 led to partial loss (Fig. 5A) suggested that three copies of the consensus might be required for maximal effect on replication timing, two copies might have a partial effect, and one copy might be insufficient for any detectable effect. To test this possibility, we constructed linker substitutions specifically targeted to the three consensus sequences. We named these three late consensus sequences LCS1, LCS2, and LCS3 according to their order in ars727. We found that individual linker substitutions of LCS1 and LCS3 (Supplemental Fig. 1) had effects no greater than the partial effect produced by linker substitution of LCS2 (Fig. 5B). However, double substitutions of LCS1 + LCS2, LCS1 + LCS3, and LCS2 + LCS3, and also triple substitution of LCS1 + LCS2 + LCS3, caused complete loss of late replication timing (Fig. 5C and data not shown). These results indicate that, as suspected, one copy of the LCS is insufficient to produce a detectable effect on replication timing, two copies are essential to produce a partial effect, and three copies are essential for a complete shift from early to late replication. Our linker substitution analyses also suggested that non-LCS sequences immediately adjacent to the LCS elements can enhance the contributions of LCS elements to enforcement of late replication. For example, the results in Supplemental Fig. 1 show that linker substitution of nucleotides 1–20 permits earlier replication than linker substitution of nucleotides 1–10, even though linker substitution of nucleotides 1–10 (which contain most of LCS1) should have inactivated LCS1 (nucleotides 2–11). Thus nucleotides 12–20 appear to have a small effect on replication timing in cooperation with LCS1. Similarly, Supplemental Fig. 1 shows that linker substitution of nucleotides 81–100 permits earlier replication timing than linker substitution of nucleotides 91–100 (LCS2), suggesting that nucleotides 81–90 have a small effect on replication timing in cooperation with LCS2. Note that linker substitution of nucleotides 11–20 or 81–90 alone has no detectable effect on replication timing (Supplemental Fig. 1 and data not shown). Regions 1 and 2 Are Sufficient to Enforce Late Replication—To test whether a cluster of three LCS elements plus flanking sequences is sufficient to change the replication timing of ars3001 from early to late, we constructed plasmids in which ars3001 (with orientation as in pBiARS#3) was flanked on its right side by region 1 alone, by region 2 alone, or by regions 1 + 2. We found that regions 1 + 2 (total of 200 bp), but not region 1 or region 2 alone, were sufficient to force ars3001 to replicate as late in S phase as it does in pBiARS#3 (Fig. 6A). Regions 1 + 2 have no ARS activity of their own (data not shown). Thus ars3001 is the only ARS element in the plasmids studied in Fig. 6A, making it clear that regions 1 + 2 together delay the firing of ars3001 until late S phase rather than inhibiting it. We also found that deletion of region 1 from ars727 in the mono-ARS plasmid, pARS727 (Fig. 1A), had little effect on ARS activity (Fig. 4) but led to complete loss of late replication timing (Fig. 6B). These findings indicate that a cluster of three LCS elements is essential, and may be sufficient, to force at least two different replication origins (ars727 and ars3001) to fire in late S phase in a plasmid context. Effects of Distance and Orientation—In pBiARS#3, the sequences in region 1 that contribute to forcing late replication on ars3001 are located adjacent to ars3001 (Fig. 3A). However, pBiARS#4, in which the orientation of ars727 with respect to ars3001 is reversed, replicates in late S phase like pBiARS#3 (Figs. 3 and 7). This raises a question. In pBiARS#4, are the ars727 sequences that are closest to ars3001 responsible for the late replication of ars3001, or does late replication require region 1, which is more than 700 bp from ars3001 and reversed compared with its orientation in pBiARS#3? To answer this question, we created pBiARS#4Δ1 and pBiARS#4Δ8, which are identical to pBiARS#4 except for deletion of region 1 or region 8 (Fig. 2), respectively. We found (Fig. 7) that pBiARS#4Δ8 (which lacks the 120 bp of ars727 closest to ars3001) replicates in late S phase like pBiARS#4. In contrast, pBiARS#4Δ1 (which lacks the 100 bp of ars727 furthest from ars3001) replicates in early S phase. This result indicates that region 1 is essential for the late replication of ars3001, even when it is more than 700 bp away from ars3001 and in reversed orientation. We conclude that the ability of a cluster of LCS elements to force late replication on a nearby ARS element can be independent of orientation of the LCS cluster (but not necessarily independent of orientation of the ARS element; Fig. 3) and can be independent of distance up to 700 bp or more. Several Very Late Replicating Chromosomal Origins Are Located Close to Clusters of LCS Elements—The preceding results demonstrate that LCS clusters can affect replication timing in plasmids. But do LCS clusters affect replication timing in chromosomes? Four observations suggest that LCS clusters may contribute to the lateness of many of the very late firing origins in the fission yeast genome. First, in its chromosomal context ars727 is passively replicated in mid to late S phase. The fact that it is passively replicated suggests that it may be programmed by its LCS cluster to replicate so late in S phase that it becomes passively replicated by forks from neighboring earlier firing origins before it has a chance to fire on its own. Second, there are clusters of sequences similar to the LCS at the telomeres of chromosomes I and II, which replicate in very late S phase (21Kim S.-M. Huberman J.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6115-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) (Fig. 8). Third, the only other very late firing origin discovered so far in fission yeast, ori1324 2D. L. Scott, C. Yompakdee, and J. A. Huberman, manuscript in preparation. (Fig. 8), is also associated with a cluster of LCS elements. Fourth, only two of the known early firing replication origins in fission yeast are close (<10 kb) to a cluster of LCS elements, and in both of these cases the cluster of LCS elements is separated from the early firing origin by a transcribed region, which is likely to act as a barrier (Fig. 8). Although these observations (Fig. 8) are based on study of only a small portion of the origins in the fission yeast genome, the correlation between clusters of LCS elements and very late firing of nearby origins is striking. The experiments presented here demonstrate that, in fission yeast, clusters of a 10-bp G-rich consensus sequence, the LCS, can enforce late firing on nearby origins that would otherwise fire in early S phase. This is the first high resolution localization, in any organism, of cis-acting sequences that affect replication timing. The next step will be to figure out how LCS elements function to control replication timing, whether in plasmids or in chromosomes. Do they bind a protein and if so which one? Or do they act as structural elements? Answering these questions will require further experiments. In vivo footprinting studies will provide information regarding interactions between LCS elements and proteins. Additional mutagenesis studies will help to identify the nucleotides within LCS elements that are most important for their function. Oligonucleotides containing clusters of functional (“wild-type”) or non-functional (mutant) LCS elements will provide important tools for purification of specific LCS-binding proteins. Studies comparing the chromatin structures of early firing origins (in the absence of LCS clusters) and the corresponding late firing origins (under the influence of LCS clusters) will assist in evaluating the potential role of chromatin structure in controlling replication timing. Even with the limited information that is currently available, however, it is possible to reach some preliminary conclusions regarding the possible roles of LCS elements and their mechanisms of action. First, although our initial hypothesis was that fission yeast ARS elements contain internal sequences that affect replication timing (note: that hypothesis appeared to be supported by our initial experiments; Fig. 1 and data not shown), our subsequent results suggested that, as in budding yeast (4Friedman K.L. Diller J.D. Ferguson B.M. Nyland S.V.M. Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1595-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), fission yeast sequences controlling replication timing can be located in regions near ARS elements as well as within them. As an example demonstrating that replication timing sequences can be external to origins, consider the results in Fig. 4. These results demonstrate that deletion of ars727 regions 1 and 2 (the regions containing the LCS cluster that enforces late replication of ars727) has no significant effect on the ability of ars727 to function as a replication origin. Thus the portion of what was previously defined as ars727 (23Maundrell K. Hutchison A. Shall S. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2203-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) that controls replication timing (regions 1 and 2) is in fact external to the portion of ars727 that (according to Fig. 4) is important for origin activity. We suggest that, based on Fig. 4, the boundaries of ars727 should be redefined to include regions 3–7 but exclude regions 1, 2, and 8 (Figs. 2 and 4). According to this new definition, the LCS cluster that controls its replication timing is adjacent to, not inside of, ars727. Additional examples of LCS clusters affecting replication timing from positions adjacent to or near (rather than within) ARS elements are provided in Figs. 3, 6, and 7. Second, the results in Fig. 3 show that pBiARS#1 replicates early, while pBiARS#3 replicates late. The only difference between these two plasmids is the orientation of ars3001 within the plasmid. In pBiARS#1, the “left” end of ars3001 is adjacent to the LCS cluster in regions 1 and 2 of ars727, but in pBi-ARS#3, the “right” end of ars3001 is adjacent to the LCS cluster. Thus the results in Fig. 3 show that the susceptibility of an ARS element to control by an LCS cluster can be affected by the orientation of the ARS element relative to the LCS cluster. A possible explanation of this phenomenon is that ars3001 may contain a barrier sequence near its left end, and this barrier may prevent the spread of the late timing effect of the LCS cluster to the active internal portion of ars3001. Further experiments are needed to test for this hypothetical barrier sequence and, if it exists, to characterize it. Third, although the orientation of an origin relative to an LCS cluster can be important, the results in Figs. 3 and 7 suggest that both the orientation and the distance of the LCS cluster relative to the origin can have no effect. In pBiARS#3, the LCS cluster is adjacent to ars3001, while in pBiARS#4, the LCS cluster is more than 700 bp away from ars3001 and in the opposite orientation. Nevertheless, in both cases ars3001 is forced to fire in late S phase (Fig. 3). Additional experiments are needed to determine precisely the distance over which an LCS cluster can control an origin. Finally, our observations suggest that LCS clusters are not the only type of sequence that can control replication timing in fission yeast. In addition to testing the replication timing of mono-ARS plasmids bearing ars3001 and ars727 (Fig. 1), we also tested a mono-ARS plasmid containing ars2-2, which replicates in mid to late S phase (21Kim S.-M. Huberman J.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6115-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) in its normal chromosomal location. We found that the plasmid with ars2-2 also replicated in mid to late S phase (data not shown), suggesting that ars2-2 contains internal sequences that determine its replication timing. However, ars2-2 does not contain a cluster of LCS elements (Fig. 8). It is interesting that ars2-2 replicates in mid to late S, while all of the origins known or suspected to be controlled by LCS clusters (ars3001 and ars727 in the plasmids described here and ori1324 and telomere-associated sequences in chromosomes) replicate in very late S phase (Fig. 8). It is possible that different sets of cis-acting sequences regulate the firing of origins at different times during S phase.

The molecular mechanisms underlying transcriptional up-regulation of drug transporter genes remains elusive. Employing Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model, we analyzed here transcriptional regulation of the drug transporter gene PDR5 in a drug-resistant pdr1-3 strain. This mutant bears a gain-of-function mutation in PDR1, which encodes a transcriptional activator for PDR5. Similar to the well studied model gene GAL1, we provide evidence showing that PDR5 belongs to a group of genes whose transcription requires the Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase (SAGA) complex. We also show that the drugindependent PDR5 transcription is associated with enhanced promoter occupancy of coactivator complexes, including SAGA, Mediator, chromatin remodeling SWI/SNF complex, and TATA-binding protein. Analyzed by chromatin immunoprecipitations, loss of contacts between histones and DNA occurs at both promoter and coding sequences of PDR5. Consistently, micrococcal nuclease susceptibility analysis revealed altered chromatin structure at the promoter and coding sequences of PDR5. Our data provide molecular description of the changes associated with constitutive PDR5 transcription, and reveal the molecular mechanism underlying drug-independent transcriptional up-regulation of PDR5.

Constitutive transcriptional up-regulation of drug transporter genes occurs in certain mutations involving various transcriptional activators. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this enhanced transcription is not fully understood. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the multiple/pleiotropic drug resistance (MDR/PDR) phenotype is primarily regulated via two transcriptional activators encoded by homologous PDR1 and PDR3 genes. These factors are responsible for activating the majority of drug transporter genes, including PDR5 (5Balzi E. Goffeau A. J. Bioenerg.

The Pdr5 transporter belongs to the ABC transporter superfamily. In the drug-resistant pdr1-3 and pdr3-7 strains, PDR5 transcription is the highest among target genes activated by Pdr1 and Pdr3 (10DeRisi J. van den Hazel B. Marc P. Balzi E. Brown P. Jacq C. Goffeau A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The pdr1-3 and pdr3-7 strains are analogous to other mutants bearing gain-of-function mutations in PDR1 (11Carvajal E. van den Hazel H.B. Cybularz-Kolaczkowska A. Balzi E. Goffeau A. Mol. Gen.

The pdr1-3 allele bears a F815S mutation located near the transcription activation domain at the COOH terminus of Pdr1, suggesting that the mutation may alter the function of the activation domain. Activation of transcription in eukaryotes is mainly controlled by activator-mediated recruitments of transcription factors (13Ptashne M. Gann A. Nature. 1997; 386: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar), facilitating the formation of pre-initiation complex. Recruitment of TBP is essential for pre-initiation complex formation (14Li X.Y. Virbasius A. Zhu X. Green M.R. Nature. 1999; 399: 605-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 15Kuras L. Struhl K. Nature. 1999; 399: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). TBP and TBP-associated factors (TAFs) are components of TFIID, which is recruited to the core promoter (16Naar A.M. Lemon B.D. Tjian R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 475-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Mediator, on the other hand, is recruited to the upstream activating sequence (UAS) promoter (17Kuras L. Borggrefe T. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13887-13891Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and associates with RNA polymerase II during initiation of transcription (18Kim Y.J. Bjorklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D.

Moreover, the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling SWI/SNF and the histone modification SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase) complexes are also recruited by activators to facilitate transcription (20Utley R.T.

Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Limited information is available on PDR5 transcription by Pdr1 and Pdr3 activators. It has been reported that Ada3, a component of the SAGA complex, interacts with the Pdr1 activation domain in two-hybrid analysis (23Martens J.A. Genereaux J. Saleh A. Brandl C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15884-15890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The transcription of a GAL10-LacZ reporter gene by a fusion activator (consisted of Gal4 DNA binding and Pdr1 activation domains) was enhanced in ada3Δ and ada2Δ strains, suggesting that the association of Ada3 with the Pdr1 activation domain may inhibit Pdr1-mediated transcription (23Martens J.A. Genereaux J. Saleh A. Brandl C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15884-15890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Whether the inhibitory effect of Ada3 also occurs on endogenous target genes of Pdr1 activator remains unclear. Furthermore, a transcriptional repressor of PDR5, termed Rdr1 (a zinc cluster protein), was suggested based on observations that deletion of RDR1 increased PDR5 transcription and augmented cycloheximide resistance in a PDRE sequence-specific manner (24Hellauer K. Akache B. MacPherson S. Sirard E. Turcotte B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17671-17676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, it remains unknown whether Rdr1 directly binds to the PDR5 promoter and interferes with Pdr1/Pdr3-mediated transcription. Through screening of a panel of strains carrying deletions of zinc cluster genes, Stb5 was identified as a transcriptional activator of multidrug resistance genes (25Akache B. Turcotte B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21254-21260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), although the interaction between Stb5 and Pdr1/Pdr3 remain to be explored. Finally, in genome wide microarray analyses, the transcription of PDR5 was not significantly affected by inactivating TAFs (26Shen W.C. Bhaumik S.R. Causton H.C. Simon I. Zhu X. Jennings E.G.

In this report, we show that PDR5 belongs to a group of highly regulated, stress-related and SAGA-dependent genes (27Huisinga K.L. Pugh B.F. Mol.

We investigated the intrinsic difference in transcription of PDR5 in a pair of isogenic drug-sensitive PDR1 and drug-resistant pdr1-3 strains. For the two strains, we compared the recruitment of Pdr1 activator and coactivators to the PDR5 promoter, the histone association with DNA, and the sensitivity to nuclease digestion on PDR5. Our data depict molecular events associated with drug-independent (constitutive) PDR5 transcription, and reveal distinctions between drug-dependent and drug-independent transcriptional up-regulation of PDR5. Yeast Strains and Growth Conditions—Growth of yeast cells in rich (YPD, yeast extract, peptone, dextrose) or synthetic media was performed according to standard procedures (31Sherman F.

To monitor drug-induced PDR5 transcription, cycloheximide treatment at a final concentration of 0.2 μg/ml (∼0.71 μm) for 45 min was used, which was far below the drug concentration required for translation inhibition (28.13 μg/ml or 100 μm). Introduction of Myc tags to the COOH terminus of various transcription factors (Pdr1, Taf1, Spt3, Gcn5, Spt20, Ada2, Srb4, and Snf2) was accomplished by PCR-mediated gene modification modules as described previously (36Longtine M.S.

The strains WCS463/WCS464 are a pair of pdr1-3/PDR1 strains whose endogenous histone H4 genes HHF1 and HHF2 were deleted and supplemented with a low copy plasmid-borne Myc-tagged HHF2 gene with the Myc sequence, SEQKLISEEDL, inserted between the first and second amino acids of histone H4 encoding sequences. We generated these strains by mating pdr1-3 (WCS261) with NOY847 (which contains Myc-tagged histone H4 as the sole source of histone H4 (37Keener J. Dodd J.A. Lalo D. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13458-13462Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar)). The resulting diploid cells were sporulated and dissected to recover haploid progeny with pdr1-3 and Myc-HHF2 alleles. The haploid strains harboring the desired pdr1-3 Myc-HHF2 genotype were mated back to NOY847 and the diploid dissected to isolate the isogenic haploid pair of pdr1-3/PDR1 strains. The WCS463/WCS464 strains are segregants from diploid cells obtained after three consecutive runs of mating and dissection.Table IList of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceWCS261 (YALF-A1)MATa ura3-52 leu2-3,112 his3-11,15 trp1-1 pdr1-3Wolfger et al.

Green M.R. Cell. 1997; 90: 615-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Typically, 20 μg of total RNA was separated by gel electrophoresis on 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels, blotted to GeneScreen membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and UV cross-linked. Membranes were hybridized in 6× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 50 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA at 65 °C for 12 to 16 h, followed by four 15-min washes with 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS. Probes for PDR5 and SCR1 transcripts were obtained by PCR amplification from genomic DNA. SCR1 was used as an equal loading control. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP) of Myc-tagged transcription factors was performed as described (26Shen W.C. Bhaumik S.R. Causton H.C. Simon I. Zhu X. Jennings E.G. Wang T.H. Young R.A. Green M.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3395-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), except the immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-Myc antibody. Specific polyclonal rabbit antibody against TBP has been described (26Shen W.C. Bhaumik S.R. Causton H.C. Simon I. Zhu X. Jennings E.G. Wang T.H. Young R.A. Green M.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3395-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The antibodies recognizing acetylated histone H3 and H4 were purchased from Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions. Antibodies recognizing acetylated histone H3 lysines 5, 8, 12, and 16 were used for detection of histone H3 acetylation levels, whereas antibodies recognizing acetylated histone H4 lysines 9 and 14 were used for detection of the histone H4 acetylation levels. Typically, DNA templates recovered from immunoprecipitation products were amplified by PCR for 20 cycles; this condition confers a linear reflection of relative quantity of the immunoprecipitation products. Each CHIP experiment was repeated independently at least twice to ensure the reproducibility of the results. We conducted a series of 2-fold dilutions of DNA recovered at the end of the CHIP procedure to ensure that the PCR reflected a linear correlation of CHIP products. Typically, input signals correspond to 1/200 of the total chromatin lysate used per immunoprecipitation (IP) reaction. Quantification of relative recruitment signals was performed by a Phosphor-Imager (Amersham Biosciences, model 425) and the relative ratio of IP to input signal was presented. The following sets of primer pairs were used for PCR analysis of CHIP products by various antibodies: PDR5 (PDRE1), 5′-CTTGCCGCCGAGAAAACGTC-3′ and 5′-ACCCGCGGGTGAGCCCACACT-3′; PDR5 (PDRE2 and -3), 5′-TCGTGATCACGATTCAGCACC-3′ and 5′-GGAGAGGCCTTGTTTGTATTGC-3′; PDR5 (TATA), 5′-CGCCGTGGTACGATATCTG-3′ and 5′-GTCGAGTGATAACTAACACAGTTG-3′; PDR5 (N-CDS), 5′-CCACAGAACCGTATCAAG-3′ and 5′-CCCCTTGTAGCATTATCCC-3′; PDR5 (M-CDS), 5′-GAAAGCTCTGAAGAGGAATCC-3′ and 5′-CCCTTTCGGCCAAACAATCCA-3′; PDR5 (C-CDS), 5′-GCAGGAACCTCGCTACAGG-3′ and 5′-GGGGCGTTCCCTGGCCTC-3′; PDR5 (3′-UTR), 5′-CCTAGGTTATCTCATCGGTAC-3′ and 5′-CCGTATATGAGAAGACGGTTC-3′; PDR12 (promoter), 5′-CACATTTTCTCGACGGTTC-3′ and 5′-GTAACTGGGAAAACAGAG-3′. Mapping PDR5 Chromatin Structure by Micrococcal Nucleases—The method employed for nuclease hypersensitivity analysis on the PDR5 chromatin structure was modified from previously described protocols (39Kent N.A. Bird L.E. Mellor J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4653-4654Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 40Jackson V. Methods. 1999; 17: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast cells were grown in YPD to A600 0.9, and immediately fixed by the addition of a final concentration of 1% formaldehyde and incubated for 10 min. The formaldehyde treatment was terminated by the addition of a final concentration of 125 mm glycine followed by a 5-min incubation. The fixed cells were washed with double distilled water and treated with 1 mg/ml Zymolase for 8 min. Spheroplasts were resuspended in cold-buffer A (1.0 m sorbitol, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5.0 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mm spermidine). For nuclease digestion, 100-μl aliquots of buffer B (buffer A plus 0.2% Nonidet P-40) containing 25–400 units/ml micrococcal nuclease (Worthington Biochemical Corp.) were pre-warmed at 37 °C in microcentrifuge tubes followed by the addition of 100 μl of spheroplasts to each tube followed by 5-min incubation at 37 °C. The reactions were terminated with 20 μl of stop buffer (250 mm EDTA, 5% SDS). Formaldehyde cross-linking was reversed by overnight incubation at 65 °C. Digested chromatin was then purified through RNase A treatment, phenol/chloroform extraction, and isopropyl alcohol precipitation. The recovered DNA was digested to completion with HindIII (for PDR5 promoter mapping) or PstI (for PDR5 3′-UTR mapping), and separated on 1 or 1.2% agarose gels and blotted for indirect end labeling analysis. 32P-Labeled probes for Southern blot analysis were generated from genomic PCR products of primers 5′CATAACCTTATGGCTGTTCGC-3′ and 5′-GGCCTCGGGCATTTTTGTC-3′ for PDR5 promoter mapping; and from genomic PCR products of primers 5′-CAACGCGTCTGCAGCTGGCC-3′ and 5′-CGTTAGCAACACCAACAGCC-3′ for PDR5 3′-UTR mapping. Conditions for hybridization were the same as described in Northern blot analysis. PDR5 Belongs to a Group of SAGA-dependent Genes—The transcription of PDR5 was found to be independent of TAFs (26Shen W.C. Bhaumik S.R. Causton H.C. Simon I. Zhu X. Jennings E.G. Wang T.H. Young R.A. Green M.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3395-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, TAFs are present in the transcription factor complexes SAGA and TFIID, and the functions of these two complexes are closely related (27Huisinga K.L. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 573-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 41Lee T.I. Causton H.C. Holstege F.C. Shen W.C. Hannett N. Jennings E.G. Winston F. Green M.R. Young R.A. Nature. 2000; 405: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). We first analyzed the role of SAGA components in the transcription of PDR5 in a wild-type PDR1 strain. Drastic reduction of PDR5 transcription was observed in spt7Δ, spt20Δ, spt3Δ, spt8Δ, ada2Δ, and ada3Δ strains (Fig. 1A). In contrast, no significant change in PDR5 transcription was detectable in cells with gcn5Δ, indicating that GCN5 is dispensable for PDR5 transcription (Fig. 1A, right panel). Ahc1 is a unique subunit of the ADA complex (42Eberharter A. Sterner D.E. Schieltz D. Hassan A. Yates 3rd, J.R. Berger S.L. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6621-6631Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), which can form a complex physically independent of SAGA (42Eberharter A. Sterner D.E. Schieltz D. Hassan A. Yates 3rd, J.R. Berger S.L. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6621-6631Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Rtg2 is present specifically in a SAGA-like (SLIK) complex (43Pray-Grant M.G. Schieltz D. McMahon S.J. Wood J.M. Kennedy E.L. Cook R.G. Workman J.L. Yates 3rd, J.R. Grant P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8774-8786Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). We included ahc1Δ and rtg2Δ strains in our Northern analysis of PDR5 transcription (Fig. 1A, right panel). Similar to the result with the gcn5Δ strain, no change in PDR5 transcription was noted in either the ahc1Δ or rtg2Δ strains. The dispensability of Ahc1 and Rtg2 for PDR5 transcription argues that the functions of SAGA complex, rather than its related complexes, are critical for PDR5 transcription. Consistent with this notion, an spt8Δ strain exhibits a dramatic loss of PDR5 transcription (Fig. 1A, left panel), and the Spt8 subunit is present in the SAGA complex but is missing in SAGA-related SLIK and SALSA complexes (43Pray-Grant M.G. Schieltz D. McMahon S.J. Wood J.M. Kennedy E.L. Cook R.G. Workman J.L. Yates 3rd, J.R. Grant P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8774-8786Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 44Sterner D.E. Belotserkovskaya R. Berger S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11622-11627Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Therefore, the transcriptional reduction of PDR5 in spt7Δ, spt20Δ, spt3Δ, spt8Δ, ada2Δ, and ada3Δ strains reflect genetic requirements for the SAGA complex, but not Gcn5-mediated chromatin modification. We also observed that deletion of GCN5 does not affect cycloheximide-induced PDR5 transcription (data not shown). However, Gcn5 is recruited to the PDR5 promoter in a comparable manner as SAGA components (Fig. 3B, discussed below). We concluded that Gcn5 is present on the PDR5 promoter, but its presence was not essential for PDR5 transcription. This finding is reminiscent of the dispensable role of Gcn5 in GAL1 activation, even though Gcn5 is recruited to the GAL1 promoter with other components of SAGA complex (29Bhaumik S.R. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1935-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). SAGA is an essential target of Gal4 at the GAL1,10 promoters (29Bhaumik S.R. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1935-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 30Larschan E. Winston F. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1946-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments demonstrated that the Gal4 activation domain targets the Tra1 subunit of SAGA, Gal4-Tra1 interaction is required for recruitment of SAGA to the UAS, and SAGA, in turn, recruits the Mediator complex to the UAS (22Bhaumik S.R. Raha T. Aiello D.P. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To address the role of Mediator in regulating PDR5 transcription, we analyzed the effect of inactivating Srb4 on PDR5 transcription. The Mediator subunit Srb4 is required for the integrity of the complex (45Koh S.S. Ansari A.Z. Ptashne M. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 895-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 46Kang J.S. Kim S.H. Hwang M.S. Han S.J. Lee Y.C. Kim Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42003-42010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Thermal inactivation of temperature-sensitive Srb4-2 caused a dramatic reduction of PDR5 transcription and, in fact, the effect of the srb4-2 mutation on PDR5 was noticeable even at 25 °C (Fig. 1B). These data indicated that PDR5, like GAL1, requires both SAGA and Mediator for its transcription. It was reported that the association of Ada3, a SAGA component, with the Pdr1 activator resulted in inhibition of the Pdr1 activation domain in two-hybrid assays (23Martens J.A. Genereaux J. Saleh A. Brandl C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15884-15890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In contrast, our studies on endogenous PDR5 transcription demonstrated that Ada2 and Ada3 subunits of SAGA were required for PDR5 transcription. Moreover, the enhanced recruitment of Ada2 to the PDR5 promoter (Fig. 3B) correlated with increased PDR5 transcription, supporting a positive role of Ada2 in Pdr1 activator-regulated PDR5 transcription. This apparent discrepancy could be because of the artificially created chromatin structure for the two-hybrid reporter genes (23Martens J.A. Genereaux J. Saleh A. Brandl C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15884-15890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) versus the endogenous PDR5 promoter. Constitutive Recruitment of Pdr1 to the PDR5 Promoter— The transcription of PDR5 in a pdr1-3 drug-resistant strain is dramatically higher than that in its corresponding PDR1 wild-type strain. PDR5 transcription in the pdr1-3 strain in the absence of cycloheximide was comparable with that in the PDR1 strain in the presence of cycloheximide (Fig. 2A). Because PDR5 transcription in the pdr1-3 strain remained inducible by cycloheximide (Fig. 2A), the underlying molecular events associated with drug-independent Pdr1-3-mediated transcription of PDR5 appeared distinct fro"
https://openalex.org/W2011570064,"An AU-rich element (ARE) in the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of bcl-2 mRNA has previously been shown to be responsible for destabilizing bcl-2 mRNA during apoptosis through increasing AUF1 binding. In the present study, we investigated the effect of the region upstream of the ARE on bcl-2 mRNA stability using serial deletion constructs of the 3′-UTR of bcl-2. Deletion of 30 nucleotides mostly consisting of the CA repeats, located upstream of the ARE, resulted in the stabilization of bcl-2 mRNA abundance, in the absence or presence of the ARE. The specificity of the CA repeats in terms of destabilizing bcl-2 mRNA was proven by the substituting the CA repeats with other alternative repeats of purine/pyriminine, but this had no effect on the stability of bcl-2 mRNA. CA repeats alone, however, failed to confer instability to bcl-2 or gfp reporter mRNAs, indicating a requirement for additional sequences in the upstream region of the 3′-UTR. Serial deletion and replacement of a part of the region upstream of the CA repeats revealed that the entire 131-nucleotide upstream region is an essential prerequisite for the CA repeat-dependent destabilization of bcl-2 mRNA. Unlike the ARE, CA repeat-mediated degradation of bcl-2 mRNA was not accelerated upon apoptotic stimulus. Moreover, the upstream sequences and CA repeats are conserved among mammals. Collectively, CA repeats contribute to the constitutive decay of bcl-2 mRNA in the steady states, thereby maintaining appropriate bcl-2 levels in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2061981757,"GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) down-regulate Ras-like proteins by stimulating their GTP hydrolysis, and a malfunction of this reaction leads to disease formation. In most cases, the molecular mechanism of activation involves stabilization of a catalytic Gln and insertion of a catalytic Arg into the active site by GAP. Rap1 neither possesses a Gln nor does its cognate Rap-GAP employ an Arg. Recently it was proposed that RapGAP provides a catalytic Asn, which substitutes for the Gln found in all other Ras-like proteins (Daumke, O., Weyand, M., Chakrabarti, P. P., Vetter, I. R., and Wittinghofer, A. (2004) Nature 429, 197–201). Here, RapGAP-mediated activation has been investigated by time-resolved Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Although the intrinsic hydrolysis reactions of Rap and Ras are very similar, the GAP-catalyzed reaction shows unique features. RapGAP binding induces a GTP* conformation in which the three phosphate groups are oriented such that they are vibrationally coupled to each other, in contrast to what was seen in the intrinsic and the Ras·RasGAP reactions. However, the charge shift toward β-phosphate observed with RasGAP was also observed for RapGAP. A GDP·Pi intermediate accumulates in the GAP-catalyzed reaction, because the release of Pi is eight times slower than the cleavage reaction, and significant GTP synthesis from GDP·Pi was observed. Partial steps of the cleavage reaction are correlated with structural changes of protein side groups and backbone. Thus, the Rap·RapGAP catalytic machinery compensates for the absence of a cis-Gln by a trans-Asn and for the catalytic Arg by inducing a different GTP conformation that is more prone to be attacked by a water molecule.

The cycling between the active and inactive form is regulated by specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). 1The abbreviations used are: GAP, GTPase-activating protein; IR, infrared; FTIR, Fourier transform IR. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors accelerate nucleotide dissociation by orders of magnitude and thereby induce activation, whereas GAPs accelerate the otherwise slow intrinsic hydrolysis of GTP by similar factors and thus terminate the signal. Rap1 is the closest relative of Ras and shares >50% sequence identity. It attracted much attention as an attenuator of Ras-mediated signaling, because Rap1 was originally found to antagonize K-Ras-mediated transformation and growth factor-induced, Ras-mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase activation (5Cook S.J. McCormick F. Science. 1993; 262: 1069-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 6Kitayama H. Sugimoto Y. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Cell. 1989; 56: 77-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). However, Rap1 is activated in parallel to Ras by receptor tyrosine kinase activators (reviewed in Ref. 7Bos J.L. de Rooij J. Reedquist K.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar) and is now generally believed to function independently of Ras. Rap1 is activated by a variety of extracellular signals via a diverse set of guanine nucleotide exchange factors. It is proposed to function in numerous biological processes such as modulation of growth and differentiation, integrin-mediated cell adhesion, and morphogenesis. In humans, four isoforms, Rap1A, Rap1B, Rap2A, and Rap2B, exist with Rap1A and Rap1B sharing >90% sequence identity. The hallmark of Rap is the absence of the catalytic glutamine residue (Gln-61 in Ras), which is conserved and crucial for the GTPase reaction in other Ras-like proteins, and its replacement by a threonine. The general mechanism of activation of the GTPase reaction as seen in Ras, Rho, and Rab GAP catalysis is based on positioning of the nucleophilic water molecule by the crucial glutamine and neutralization of the developing negative charge by an arginine (4Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. Science. 2001; 294: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Rap1GAP, the GTPase-activating protein for Rap1, has no sequence homology to RasGAP and does not employ an arginine for catalysis. This is again different from the Ran·RanGAP system, where Ran bears a Gln but RanGAP operates without an arginine finger (8Seewald M.J. Korner C. Wittinghofer A. Vetter I.R. Nature. 2002; 415: 662-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Rap1GAP can also down-regulate the G12V mutant of Rap1, which is not possible for Ras, Ran, or Rho (9Brinkmann T. Daumke O. Herbrand U. Kühlmann D. Stege P. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12525-12531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Although the intrinsic hydrolysis rate of Rap is ∼10-fold slower than that of Ras because of the Gln-61 → Thr substitution (10Frech M. John J. Pizon V. Chardin P. Tavitian A. Clark R. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1990; 249: 169-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), the rate of the GAP-catalyzed reaction is 5–10 s-1, very similar to what has been found for other GAP-catalyzed reactions (9Brinkmann T. Daumke O. Herbrand U. Kühlmann D. Stege P. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12525-12531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Presently, the structure of Rap2 is known along with several nucleotide analogues (11Cherfils J. Menetrey J. Le Bras G. Janoueix-Lerosey I. de Gunzburg J. Garel J.R. Auzat I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5582-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and that of Rap1 along with the Ras binding domain of the postulated effector Raf kinase (12Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Scherer A. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1995; 375: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar), all of which show a high degree of similarity with the corresponding structures of Ras, especially in the GTP-binding site (Fig. 1a). The three-dimensional structure of Rap1GAP itself and biochemical experiments suggested that the mechanism of the Rap1GAP-catalyzed GTPase reaction is completely different and employs a catalytic Asn inserted into the active site of Rap1 (1Daumke O. Weyand M. Chakrabarti P.P. Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 2004; 429: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This prompted us to investigate the reaction by FTIR and compare it to the Ras·RasGAP reaction. Time-resolved Fourier transform infrared (trFTIR) difference spectroscopy has been successfully applied to elucidate the molecular reaction mechanisms of proteins (13Gerwert K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 769-773Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). By performing differences between spectra taken at the educt state and during the reaction, the absorbance changes of a few residues involved in the reaction are selected from the quiescent background absorption of the whole protein. Spectra are taken with a millisecond time resolution in the rapid scan mode (14Gerwert K. Souvignier G. Hess B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9774-9778Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Earlier work on Ras emphasized several important aspects in the RasGAP-catalyzed GTPase reaction of Ras as follows. (i) Upon Ras binding, negative charge is drawn toward the non-bridging β-oxygen of GTP (15Cepus V. Scheidig A.J. Goody R.S. Gerwert K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10263-10271Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), which is increased by GAP (16Allin C. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Gerwert K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7754-7759Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). (ii) A GDP·Pi intermediate accumulates during the reaction, and Pi release becomes rate-limiting; and (iii) the GTPase reaction appears to be reversible (16Allin C. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Gerwert K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7754-7759Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Pi release or the release of NF1 from the Ras·GDP·Pi·NF1 intermediate is the rate-limiting step (16Allin C. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Gerwert K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7754-7759Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) in line with conclusions drawn from stopped-flow experiments (17Nixon A.E. Brune M. Lowe P.N. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15592-15598Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 18Kraemer A. Brinkmann T. Plettner I. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 763-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 19Phillips R.A. Hunter J.L. Eccleston J.F. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3956-3965Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The charge redistribution toward the β-phosphate of GTP is probably due to the positively charged Lys-16 and Mg2+, which are equidistant from the nonbridging β- and γ-oxygen (20Pai E.F. Krengel U. Petsko G.A. Goody R.S. Kabsch W. Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2351-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). This leads to a redistribution of excess negative charge from γ- to β-phosphate, as shown by QM/MM calculations. 2M. Klähn, J. Schlitter, and K. Gerwert, unpublished results. In addition, the P-loop backbone N-H groups point toward the nonbridging (Sp)-β-oxygen and might assist in this charge shift as proposed (15Cepus V. Scheidig A.J. Goody R.S. Gerwert K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10263-10271Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 16Allin C. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Gerwert K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7754-7759Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In the presence of GAP, there is an even larger charge shift toward the (Sp)-β-oxygen of GTP, and it was assumed that this is due to the presence of the additional positive charge of the arginine finger (16Allin C. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Gerwert K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7754-7759Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Because this is the only effect on the GTP and GDP vibrations due to GAP binding, it was proposed to be crucial for the catalysis. The question arises as to whether Rap1GAP without an arginine finger still shifts charge toward the β-phosphate and whether the features described for the Ras·RasGAP system are generally applicable to other GTP-binding proteins and their respective GAPs. Here, the Rap·RapGAP system appeared to be particularly interesting because of the absence of both a Gln in the GTPase and an Arg residue from the GAP that are considered to be crucial in the case of the Ras (21Ahmadian M.R. Stege P. Scheffzek K. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), Rho (22Leonard D.A. Lin R. Cerione R.A. Manor D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16210-16215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23Graham D.L. Eccleston J.F. Lowe P.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 985-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and Rab GTPases (24Albert S. Will E. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5216-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Materials—The truncated form (amino acids 1–167) of Rap1B (which will be called Rap from this point on) was prepared from Escherichia coli strain CK600K using the ptac-expression system through purification on a Q-Sepharose column and subsequent gel filtration as described (25Tucker J. Sczakiel G. Feuerstein J. John J. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1351-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Rap1GAPv, the catalytically active fragment (amino acids 75–416) of Rap1GAP (simply RapGAP hereafter) was purified from E. coli strain BL21-DE3 using the pGEX-expression system as described (9Brinkmann T. Daumke O. Herbrand U. Kühlmann D. Stege P. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12525-12531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A detailed description and more detailed literature for 18O labeling of GTP and GDP are given in Ref. 26Allin C. Gerwert K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3037-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar. For mass spectrometric experiments, trilithium salts of GTP (>97% purity; Sigma) and H218O (>95% enrichment; Isotech) were used. FTIR Spectroscopic Measurements—The sample solutions were prepared essentially as described (16Allin C. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Gerwert K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7754-7759Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 26Allin C. Gerwert K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3037-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) with a slight modification for the GAP-catalyzed case in that RapGAP was taken directly from a stock concentration of 25 mg/ml in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol without further desalting and rebufferring. This turned out to be crucial for the optimal reactivity of RapGAP. The exchange to caged-GTP (P3-1-(2-nitro) phenylethyl guanosine 5′-O-triphosphate) was ∼65% complete, with 35% of Rap remaining in the GDP-bound state. For the GAP-catalyzed reaction, RapGAP was used in 1.6 molar excess over the Rap·caged nucleotide. All of the 1% GAP-catalyzed (“intrinsic”) reactions were done at 283 K, and the GAP-catalyzed reactions were done at 258 K. Dithiothreitol was used to scavenge the reactive photolysis by-product 2-nitrosoacetophenone. For the measurements in H218O, the sample was treated with 10 μl of H218O and evaporated four times. The FTIR measurements were performed by using the fast scan technique (14Gerwert K. Souvignier G. Hess B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9774-9778Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) where the GTPase reaction was initiated by UV laser flashes as described (16Allin C. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Gerwert K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7754-7759Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 27Cepus V. Ulbrich C. Allin C. Troullier A. Gerwert K. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 291: 223-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This converted caged-GTP (P3-1-(2-nitro) phenylethyl GTP) to GTP and, subsequently, the IR absorbance changes were monitored. The very slow intrinsic reaction of Rap was difficult to monitor because of baseline drifts. Hence, a catalytic amount of GAP has been used to accelerate the reaction for the purpose of band assignment. This procedure does not change the band positions but significantly improves the baseline stability (26Allin C. Gerwert K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3037-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Difference spectra for the 1% GAP-catalyzed reaction (simply called “intrinsic reaction” hereafter) were made by using the software OPUS™ (Bruker). The data of the time-resolved fast scan measurements for the GAP-catalyzed reactions were analyzed between 1800 and 950 cm-1 with a global fit method (28Hessling B. Souvignier G. Gerwert K. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 1929-1941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In global fit analysis, as shown in Equation 1,ΔA(v,t)=∑l=1nral(v)⋅e−kl't+a0(v)(Eq. 1) the absorbance changes ΔA in the infrared spectrum are analyzed with sums of nr exponentials with apparent rate constants kl′ and amplitudes al. In the analysis, shown in Equation 2,f=∑i=1nw∑j=1nt(wij)2(ΔAmeasured(vi,tj)−∑l=1nral(vi)⋅e−kl'tj+a0(vj))2(Eq. 2) the weighted sum of squared differences (f) between the fit with nr rate constants (kl′) and data points at nw measured wavelengths (νi) and nt time points (tj) is minimized. Evaluation of Data Quality—Each spectrum presented in this manuscript corresponding to unlabeled as well as to different 18O-labeled nucleotides is the average of at least 3–5 reproducible measurements. The baseline stability of the 1% GAP-catalyzed reaction is discussed elsewhere (26Allin C. Gerwert K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3037-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 illustrates the reproducibility and baseline stability of the spectral data for the GAP-catalyzed reaction. Two representative amplitude spectra of the unlabeled GTP corresponding to the third rate (see “RapGAP-catalyzed Reaction” under “Results”) are superimposed in Fig. 2, trace A. Similarly, two amplitude spectra of the third rate with a [β,γ-18O/γ-18O3] label are superimposed in Fig. 2, trace B. One can clearly see that the spectral features are conserved. Fig. 2, trace C represents the double difference of the two individual spectra used in traces A (black line) and B (red line). This indicates the baseline stability and reproducibility of individual measurements. Individual double difference spectra (spectrum in trace B minus the spectrum in trace A) for two measurements are shown in Fig. 2D. This clearly shows that the peak positions and shifts are reproducible. Mass Spectrometry—To measure 18O incorporation into the product, the reaction product obtained with H218O was extracted after the FTIR measurement with 100 μl of 50% methanol-water and centrifuged with a 10-kDa Vivaspin™ (Vivascience, Hannover, Germany) to remove the protein. The low molecular weight flow-through was analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy between m/z 50 to 600 in a Bruker Esquire 3000 Plus™ instrument (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany) operating in negative ion mode with a spray voltage of 4 kV. Upon triggering the GTPase reaction by UV laser flashes, the resulting IR absorbance changes of the hydrolysis reaction were monitored simultaneously between 1800 and 950 cm-1 with 10-ms time resolution. The time-resolved absorbance changes were analyzed by a multi-exponential global fit analysis (see “Experimental Procedures”), which reveals the amplitude spectra and the corresponding apparent rate constants. The resulting spectral changes reflect vibrations of only those residues that are involved in the reaction. Negative bands represent the educt vibrations, whereas positive bands reflect product vibrations. Intrinsic Reaction—The difference spectrum of the intrinsic reaction of Rap (with 1% added RapGAP to obtain a significant rate of hydrolysis) is compared with that of Ras in Fig. 1b. The spectra agree nicely within the spectral region between 1350 and 950 cm-1, where phosphate vibrations are expected. An intensity change at the γ vibration is seen that might be due to different interactions of the γ-phosphate with Gln-61 or Thr-61 in Ras and Rap, respectively. The agreement shows that the protein-bound GTP structure and charge distribution as probed by FTIR are very similar for Ras and Rap. This is in good agreement with x-ray structural models showing a very similar GTP structure and binding niche (Fig. 1a). However, more deviations are seen for the protein part of the spectra between 1800 and 1350 cm-1. Fig. 1c is a representative example of band assignment for the intrinsic hydrolysis reaction of Rap through specific γ-18O-labeled GTP. This is further illustrated in Supplemental Fig. 1 (found in the on-line version of this article) where 4-fold γ-18O label shifts the γ-bands at 1157 (shoulder) and 1143 cm-1 to 1119 and 1106 cm-1. The frequency shifts are illustrated by means of double difference spectra (spectrum of labeled minus spectrum of unlabeled GTP) with shaded difference bands to enhance visualization. Ideally, in the double difference spectra only the vibrations of a labeled group should appear as a difference band. Other effects in the double difference spectra may appear because of baseline shifts and small variations between different sample preparations. The double difference spectrum shown in Fig. 1c (and Supplemental Fig. 1b, trace A) indicates the frequency shifts as difference bands at 1157/1117 and 1140/1103 cm-1. The product Pi is also labeled and shows frequency shifts at 1076/1054 cm-1 and a hardly resolved band at 992/973 cm-1. The γ-labeling clearly leaves the other bands unaltered, indicating isolated vibrations in Rap-bound GTP. In principle, if the GTP vibrations were coupled, labeling would shift the vibrations of all groups that are vibrationally coupled to the labeled group, as observed for unbound GTP in solution. As in the case of Ras (15Cepus V. Scheidig A.J. Goody R.S. Gerwert K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10263-10271Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 26Allin C. Gerwert K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3037-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), the uncoupling of GTP vibrations due to protein binding is also observed for Rap. GTP-β appears at 1215 cm-1 and is downshifted to 1207 cm-1 with a (Sp)-[β-18O] label (Supplemental Fig. 1a, trace C). The assignments of GTP-γ at 1143 cm-1 with a shoulder band of GTP-γ at 1157 cm-1, GTP-β at 1215 cm-1, GTP-α at 1260 cm-1, the GDP-β band at 1100 and 1136 cm-1, and GDP-α at 1236 cm-1 (Supplemental Fig. 2a, trace A) are in excellent agreement with previous assignments on Ras (26Allin C. Gerwert K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3037-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and are summarized in Fig. 3. The results show that the structural arrangement and charge distribution of GTP and GDP are very similar for Ras and Rap, and the intrinsic hydrolysis reaction agrees well for both proteins. RapGAP-catalyzed Reaction—While a single apparent rate constant can describe the intrinsic hydrolysis reaction, at least two are required to describe the GAP-catalyzed hydrolysis reaction. The IR absorbance changes for the GAP-catalyzed reaction of Rap are shown in Fig. 4 as a function of wave number and time (logarithmic), where the marker frequencies of GTP-β at 1128 cm-1, the intermediate at 1172 cm-1, GDP-β at 1104 cm-1, and the released Pi at 1075 cm-1 are highlighted. The absorbance changes relax to zero because the final spectrum is used as reference. After photolysis (described by k1′ = 5.7 ± 2 s-1), the GTPase reaction takes place in the two steps as shown in Scheme 1,A→k2'=0.6s−1B→k3'=0.07s−1C(RapGTP)(Intermediate)(RapGDP+Pi)Scheme 1 where the apparent rate constants k2′ and k3′ (at 258 K) describe the appearance of an intermediate (A → B) and the decay to GDP and Pi (B → C) by the slowest rate, respectively. A to B Transition—The amplitude spectrum of k2′, representing the transition of the GTP to the intermediate, is shown in Fig. 5a (black lines). The band assignments in the k2′ amplitude spectra of the RapGAP-catalyzed reaction are, in general, more complicated than either the intrinsic reactions of Ras and Rap or the Ras·RasGAP reaction, because the GTP vibrations now become highly coupled. This shows that Rap-GAP activates phosphoryl transfer by a different mechanism than RasGAP by inducing a different GTP conformation. Delocalized vibrations are observed for unbound GTP in solution. A different orientation of the three phosphate groups relative to each other can cause different coupling. It is not yet clear which relative orientations of GTP* cause such delocalization. Further studies are required to clarify this phenomenon. Nevertheless, the main contributing vibration to the normal mode can still be assigned as described in the following sections. As in the case of Ras (16Allin C. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Gerwert K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7754-7759Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), two intermediate bands are identified. These bands appear at 1170 and 1085 cm-1 for the Rap·RapGAP system. The band at 1170 cm-1 is shifted to 1158 cm-1 because of the γ-18O label [βγ-18O/γ-18O3] (Fig. 5a, trace A, red line), which is seen in the double difference spectra (Fig. 5b, trace A, red line) as a difference band at 1172/1159 cm-1. The second band of the intermediate shifts from 1090 to 1072 cm-1 because of [βγ-18O/γ-18O3] labeling. The shifts indicate that the bands at 1170 and 1090 cm-1 are either GTP-γ or cleaved Pi. To distinguish between the two possibilities, the reaction was performed in H218O, which can only lead to a shift if cleavage has taken place (29Feuerstein J. Goody R.S. Webb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6188-6190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As for the γ-label, the intermediate band at 1170 cm-1 (Fig. 5a, trace B) indeed loses intensity and another band appears at 1155 cm-1, creating the 1172/1156 cm-1 peaks in the double difference spectrum (Fig. 5b, trace B). Thus, we conclude that cleavage of the β-γ bond has already taken place in the intermediate B. A shift of the second intermediate band is not yet resolved with H218O, most likely because its shifts are not above the noise level. γ-Labeling not only affects the γ vibration but also several other band shifts because of coupling of the phosphate groups. The γ-18O labeling (Fig. 5, a, trace A and b, trace A) also affects the GTP-α vibrations, as seen from the downshift in the double difference spectra at 1262, 1256/1240, 1231 cm-1, which represents a GTP-α vibration. The same shift is seen in the H218O measurement at 1256/1231 cm-1 in the double difference spectra (Fig. 5b, trace B) with lower intensity. The effect of the γ-18O label on the GTP-α band at 1262, 1256/1240, 1231 cm-1 is attributed to the long-range coupled α-γ-vibration in GTP. The GTP-γ bands seen in the photolysis spectra at 1144 and 1156 cm-1 (similar to the intrinsic spectra in Fig. 1b; data not shown) are not observed as negative bands in the k2′ amplitude spectrum. GTP vibrations are uncoupled in the photolysis and become highly coupled in the GTP state reflected by the k2′ hydrolysis amplitude spectrum, which is thus denoted GTP*. Because the complete photolysis of the caged compound takes ∼100 ms, the reaction to GTP* is not time-resolved and must be faster than 100 ms. However, comparison of the photolysis and hydrolysis amplitude spectra resolves the different GTP conformations. Similarly to the RasGAP-catalyzed situation (16Allin C. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Gerwert K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7754-7759Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), the binding of RapGAP also induces a large downshift of a second β-vibration from 1140 to 1128 cm-1 (Fig. 3). The frequency downshift of the second β-vibration is even larger than for GAP·Ras (1140 cm-1; Fig. 3). The two stereo-specific β-labels, the (Sp)-[β-18O] (Fig. 5, a, trace C and b, trace C) and the (Rp)-[β-18O] (Fig. 5, a, trace D and b, trace D) show the same shifts. The GTP-β bands shift from 1210 to 1200 cm-1 and from 1130 to 1119 cm-1. Thus, the bands at 1210 and 1128 cm-1 (Fig. 5a, traces C and D) can be attributed primarily to a GTP-β vibration. The bands have higher intensity for (Sp)-[β-18O] than for (Rp)-[β-18O]. The difference between the (Rp) and (Sp) labels is much smaller as compared with Ras and is most likely due to scrambling of the isotope label due to rotation of GDP-β after cleavage and before reformation of GTP. The β-18O labels also shift the intermediate band from 1172 to 1154 cm-1, just as the γ-18O label does vice versa for the β vibration at 1130 cm-1. This is seen in the double difference spectra as a difference band at 1132/1120 cm-1 (Fig. 5b, trace A). In addition, the (Sp)-[β-18O] and (Rp)-[β-18O] labels shift the second intermediate band from 1100 to 1074 cm-1. It seems that the second intermediate band absorbs at 1100 cm-1. In the case of γ-labeling, because of an additional positive band it seems to be shifted from its original position at 1100 cm-1 down to 1090 cm-1 (Fig. 5b, traces A, C, and D, respectively). In the third rate, the intermediate band is seen at 1090 cm-1 for the γ-labeling (Fig. 7b, trace A). The α-18O label also affects both intermediate vibrations (data in Supplemental Fig. 2 in the on-line version of this article). Because α- and β-labeling shifts the intermediate bands, they should usually represent γ-phosphate vibrations coval"
https://openalex.org/W2090907966,"The vaccinia virus RNA polymerase is a multi-subunit enzyme that contains eight subunits in the postreplicative form. A prior study of a virus called IBTr90, which contains a mutation in the A24 gene encoding the RPO132 subunit of the RNA polymerase, demonstrated that the mutation results in resistance to the anti-poxvirus drug isatin-β-thiosemicarbazone (IBT). In this study, we utilized an in vitro transcription elongation assay to determine the effect of this mutation on transcription elongation. Both wild type and IBTr90 polymerase complexes were studied with regard to their ability to pause during elongation, their stability in a paused state, their ability to release transcripts, and their elongation rate. We have determined that the IBTr90 complex is specifically defective in elongation compared with the WT complex, pausing longer and more frequently than the WT complex. We have built a homology model of the RPO132 subunit with the yeast pol II rpb2 subunit to propose a structural mechanism for this elongation defect. The vaccinia virus RNA polymerase is a multi-subunit enzyme that contains eight subunits in the postreplicative form. A prior study of a virus called IBTr90, which contains a mutation in the A24 gene encoding the RPO132 subunit of the RNA polymerase, demonstrated that the mutation results in resistance to the anti-poxvirus drug isatin-β-thiosemicarbazone (IBT). In this study, we utilized an in vitro transcription elongation assay to determine the effect of this mutation on transcription elongation. Both wild type and IBTr90 polymerase complexes were studied with regard to their ability to pause during elongation, their stability in a paused state, their ability to release transcripts, and their elongation rate. We have determined that the IBTr90 complex is specifically defective in elongation compared with the WT complex, pausing longer and more frequently than the WT complex. We have built a homology model of the RPO132 subunit with the yeast pol II rpb2 subunit to propose a structural mechanism for this elongation defect. Vaccinia virus, the prototypic Orthopoxvirus, contains ∼200 kb of double-stranded linear DNA. Vaccinia virus replicates in the cytoplasm of host cells and encodes its own multi-subunit RNA polymerase and associated transcription machinery, making it a convenient model for transcriptional studies (1Moss B. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. 4th Ed. Field's Virology. 2. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 2849-2883Google Scholar). There are three temporal stages of transcription after a vaccinia virus infection: early; intermediate; and late. For the purposes of this study, the latter two stages are referred to collectively as postreplicative. Early viral transcription has been well characterized, whereas less is known regarding postreplicative transcription. Each stage of transcription is distinguished from the other stages by the recognition of different promoter classes and the utilization of distinct transcription factors. Both early and postreplicative transcription complexes have eight polymerase subunits in common. Of these, RPO147 and RPO132, the products of the J6R and A24R genes, respectively, have some sequence similarity to the two largest subunits of the yeast pol II RNA polymerase. Another subunit, RPO30, which is the product of the E4L gene, has some sequence similarity to the yeast-positive transcription elongation factor TFIIS (2Ahn B.Y. Gershon P.D. Jones E.V. Moss B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5433-5441Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 3Broyles S.S. Pennington M.J. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5376-5382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The early vaccinia RNA polymerase contains one additional subunit, the product of the H4L gene, Rap94, which is not present in postreplicative transcription complexes (4Baroudy B.M. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4372-4380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Spencer E. Shuman S. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5388-5395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ahn B.Y.

Rap94 appears to be involved in the recognition of promoter classes, because polymerase complexes that contain Rap94 transcribe only early and not late genes and complexes that do not contain Rap94 transcribe only late and not early genes (6Ahn B.Y. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3536-3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 7Deng L. Shuman S. J. Biol.

Coroneos A.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2602-2604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several factors distinguish early transcription elongation and termination from postreplicative transcription elongation and termination. The elongation complex of early genes is fairly stable in the presence of salt and sarkosyl, and one early transcription elongation factor, nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase I, has been identified (11Broyles S.S. Moss B. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 1738-1742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Rodriguez J.F. Kahn J.S. Esteban M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Early transcripts contain an intrinsic termination signal, U5NU, 30–50 nucleotides (nt) 1The abbreviations used are: nt, nucleotide; pol, polymerase; IBT, isatin-β-thiosemicarbazone; WT, wild type.1The abbreviations used are: nt, nucleotide; pol, polymerase; IBT, isatin-β-thiosemicarbazone; WT, wild type. upstream of the mRNA 3′ end (14Shuman S.

Nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase I and the virus-coded mRNA-capping enzyme are both required for early gene transcription termination, which results in the production of transcripts from any given early gene with 3′ ends that are uniform in length (15Yuen L. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6417-6421Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 16Hagler J. Luo Y. Shuman S. J. Biol.

Postreplicative genes do not respond to the early termination signal and lack any other known termination signal. Their transcripts from any given intermediate or late gene are heterogeneous in size at their 3′ ends (19Cooper J.A. Wittek R. Moss B. J. Virol. 1981; 39: 733-745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Mahr A. Roberts B.E. J. Virol. 1984; 49: 510-520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At least three vaccinia virus-encoded proteins are believed to be involved in the regulation of postreplicative transcription elongation and termination. A postreplicative transcript release factor, A18, has been identified in vivo and characterized in vitro (21Xiang Y. Simpson D.A. Spiegel J. Zhou A. Silverman R.H. Condit R.C. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7012-7023Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Lackner C.A. Condit R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1485-1494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and two putative postreplicative transcription elongation factors, G2 and J3, have been identified through in vivo experiments (23Latner D.R. Xiang Y. Lewis J.I. Condit J. Condit R.C. Virology. 2000; 269: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 24Black E.P. Condit R.C. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 47-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm the roles of G2 and J3 as elongation factors, an in vitro elongation assay is essential but first the assay must be utilized to evaluate the basic biochemistry of postreplicative transcription with regard to elongation rate and stability in the presence of salt, sarkosyl, and heparin. The anti-poxvirus drug isatin-β-thiosemicarbazone (IBT) has been useful in vivo for studying postinitiation events in postreplicative gene transcription. IBT has no effect on early transcription, but during postreplicative transcription, IBT causes read-through transcription resulting in the production of longer than wild type (WT) length transcripts, suggesting that the drug affects elongation or termination. Read-through transcription from converging promoters leads to the production of excess double-stranded RNA. This causes the activation of the cellular 2-5A pathway and induction of RNase L activity, which inhibits viral growth (25Cohrs R.J. Condit R.C. Pacha R.F. Thompson C.L. Sharma O.K. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 948-951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both IBT-dependent and IBT-resistant mutants can be isolated, and these mutants provide insight into genes that regulate postreplicative transcription (26Katz E. Margalith E. Winer B. Lazar A. J. Gen. Virol. 1973; 21: 469-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Mutants that are dependent on IBT map to genes that seem to encode elongation factors, specifically G2 and J3 (23Latner D.R. Xiang Y. Lewis J.I. Condit J. Condit R.C. Virology. 2000; 269: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). IBT-dependent null mutations in these genes have been shown in vivo to produce shorter than WT transcripts in the absence of IBT (23Latner D.R. Xiang Y. Lewis J.I. Condit J. Condit R.C. Virology. 2000; 269: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 24Black E.P. Condit R.C. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 47-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, in the absence of IBT, G2 and J3 mutants that are IBT-dependent make postreplicative transcripts that are too short to encode all of the proteins needed to maintain viability of the virus. The addition of IBT to these IBT-dependent viruses causes an increase in the length of postreplicative transcripts that restores viability of the virus. IBT resistance presents a more complicated scenario. The target and precise mechanism of action of IBT are unknown, but IBT resistance could theoretically result from a mutation in a gene needed to activate the drug, a mutation that abrogates the binding of the drug, or a mutation that compensates for the effect of the drug. It has been proposed previously that IBT resistance represents an intermediate phenotype between IBT sensitivity and IBT dependence (27Latner D.R. Thompson J.M. Gershon P.D. Storrs C. Condit R.C. Virology. 2002; 301: 64-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Specifically, IBT-resistant viruses may produce postreplicative transcripts that are shorter than those produced by an IBT-sensitive virus but not as short as those produced by an IBT-dependent virus. In the absence of IBT, the majority of transcripts would be long enough to encode functional proteins, and in the presence of IBT, the majority of transcripts would not be so long as to form a significant amount of double-stranded RNA. IBT-resistant mutants have been isolated that map to the J3R and A24R genes. The IBT-resistant virus with a mutation in the A24R gene has not been characterized with regard to transcript length in vivo or in vitro (28Condit R.C. Easterly R. Pacha R.F. Fathi Z. Meis R.J. Virology. 1991; 185: 857-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). IBT-resistant viruses with a J3 mutation have recently been studied in vivo with regard to transcript length, and these transcripts do not appear to be measurably different in size from those produced by WT or IBT-sensitive viruses in the absence of IBT or from transcripts produced by IBT-dependent viruses in the presence of IBT (23Latner D.R. Xiang Y. Lewis J.I. Condit J. Condit R.C. Virology. 2000; 269: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It is possible that subtle size differences in transcript length from IBT-resistant viruses in the presence and absence of IBT were difficult to detect in vivo because of the fact that postreplicative vaccinia virus transcripts are heterogeneous in size. To address the mechanism of IBT action, we have modified an in vitro transcript release assay utilized to identify the A18 protein as a transcript release factor and used it to examine postreplicative transcription elongation of the IBT-resistant virus, IBTr90. The IBTr90 virus containsaTtoC substitution at nt 1384 in the A24 gene, which encodes RPO132, the second largest subunit of the RNA polymerase. Both IBTr90 and WT vaccinia viruses were analyzed with regard to pausing, elongation, and stability of the polymerase complexes in postreplicative transcription. Results demonstrate that in vitro IBTr90 is defective in transcription elongation. Terminology—All of the vaccinia virus strain WR genes discussed in this paper are referred to by their location in a HindIII restriction digest. A new nomenclature based on sequential numbering of the genes has been implemented. These new names are mentioned in the text where appropriate. Cell Culture and Infected Cell Extracts for Transcription—A549 cells were propagated in 1× Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% bovine calf serum (Hyclone) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Confluent 100-mm dishes of A549 cells were infected with either WT vaccinia virus strain WR (29Condit R.C. Motyczka A. Virology. 1981; 113: 224-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) or IBTr90 virus (28Condit R.C. Easterly R. Pacha R.F. Fathi Z. Meis R.J. Virology. 1991; 185: 857-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) at a multiplicity of infection of 15 at 37 °C and then incubated in medium containing 10 mm hydroxyurea, an inhibitor of vaccinia viral DNA replication. The addition of hydroxyurea to infected cells results in extracts that contain only the products of early gene transcription, including factors specific for intermediate transcription. At 16–18 h postinfection, cell extracts were prepared as described previously (24Black E.P. Condit R.C. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 47-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequencing—The IBTr90 A24R gene (VACWR144) was PCR-amplified using primers upstream and downstream of the open reading frame. This PCR product was submitted to the University of Florida Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research for sequencing. Sequencing reads were assembled using the Wisconsin package, version 10.3 (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA). Templates—The pG8GU template is a derivative of the pG8G template, which contains the vaccinia virus intermediate G8 promoter upstream of a 375-nt G-less cassette and which was originally derived from the pC2AT19 plasmid (22Lackner C.A. Condit R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1485-1494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 30Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4394-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). To create pG8GU, the pG8G vector was digested with SacI and BamHI to produce a 328-bp fragment containing the vaccinia intermediate G8 promoter sequence and a 37-nt G-less cassette. This fragment was ligated with a 3188-bp SacI-BamHI fragment from the vector pGEM32F to create a 3526-bp intermediate clone called pG8GI. pG8GI was cleaved with SmaI and BamHI to yield a 3497-bp fragment. Two oligonucleotides (GSI44, 5′-GGGAACAGAGGACGAAAGACGACGCAGACAGGAGCAGCGCTTTTTTTTTCATATGG-3′, and GSI46, 5′-GATCCCATATGAAAAAAAAAGCGCTGCTCCTGTCTGCGTCGTCTTTCGTCCTCTGTTCCC-3′) were annealed to create a 40-bp cassette that was ligated with the 3497-bp SmaI-BamHI vector fragment of pG8GI. The resulting clone, pG8GU, is 3558 nt and contains downstream of the G-less cassette a 40-nt T-less cassette followed by a stretch of 9 Ts. The pfeU1 template is originally derived from the pG8GI template. pG8GI was digested with SmaI and PstI to create a 3483-bp vector fragment. The vaccinia virus F17R and E1L genes were amplified with oligonucleotides GSI9 (5′-CCGGTCCCGGGGATGAATTCTCATTTTGCATCTGC-3′), which anneals at the 5′ end of the F17 coding region and contains a 5′-SmaI site, and GSI27 (5′-CGCGCCTGCAGAGAATTCATATGAATAGGAATCCTGATCAG-3′), which anneals at the 5′ end of the E1L coding region and contains a 3′-PstI site. The resulting PCR product was cut with SmaI and PstI to yield a 1760-bp insert that was ligated with the 3483-bp pG8GI vector fragment. This created the clone pG8Gfe, which contains the vaccinia virus intermediate G8 promoter followed by a 37-nt G-less cassette and the F17R/E1L genes (VACWR056/VACWR057). To create pfeU1, pG8Gfe was digested with BamHI and AccI. This resulted in four fragments; an AccI-AccI fragment of 856 bp containing vector sequences, the G8 promoter, and 550 bp of the F17R/E1L genes; an AccI-BamHI fragment of 359 bp of the F17R/E1L genes; a BamHI-AccI fragment of 599 bp of the F17R/E1L genes; and an AccI-AccI fragment of 3420 bp containing the remaining 233 nt of the F17R/E1L genes and vector DNA. The two AccI-AccI fragments were isolated and ligated together to form the 4276-bp pfeU1. Bead-bound DNA Templates for Transcription—The pG8GU and pfeU1 transcription templates were bound to streptavidin-conjugated Dynabeads M280 (Dynal) as described previously for use in the in vitro transcription assay (22Lackner C.A. Condit R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1485-1494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To bind pG8GU, the plasmid DNA was digested with SacI and HindIII and the 395-bp fragment was isolated from an agarose gel and end-filled with biotin for binding to paramagnetic beads. To bind pfeU1, the plasmid DNA was linearized with SalI and end-filled with biotin for binding to streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads. In Vitro Transcription Elongation Assay—During the pulse phase of the elongation assay, transcription initiation complexes were formed at the viral G8 promoter by combining 15 μl of infected cell extracts with 5 μl of bead-bound DNA template and 5 μl of transcription buffer for a final volume of 25 μl containing 5 mm MgCl2,25mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1.6 mm dithiothreitol, 80 mm KOAc, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm UTP, 1 μm CTP, 200 μm 3′-O-methyl-GTP, and 6 μCi of [α-32P]CTP (3000 Ci/mmol stock, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Complexes were incubated at 30 °C for 20 min to allow elongation to proceed to the end of the 37-nt G-less cassette. Complexes were isolated by binding the paramagnetic bead-bound templates to a magnet and were then washed 3× in 1–1.5 reaction volumes of low salt wash buffer containing 5 mm MgCl2,25mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1.6 mm dithiothreitol, 80 mm KOAc, 200 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, and 7.5% glycerol. Complexes were resuspended in transcription buffer containing 5 mm MgCl2,25mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1.6 mm dithiothreitol, 80 mm (pG8GU) or 200 mm (PfeU1) KOAc, 20 units of RNasin (Promega) and were chased in the presence of 1 mm ATP, 1 mm CTP, and 1 mm GTP and varying levels of UTP at 30 °C for the times indicated. To investigate the release of transcripts after the chase reaction, the beads were bound to a magnet and 25 μl of supernatant was removed to a new tube. To each tube, 175 μl of proteinase K mixture (114 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 14 mm EDTA, 171 mm NaCl, 1.1% SDS, 230 μg/ml proteinase K, and 800 μg of glycogen) was added and reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Nucleic acids were extracted with 175 μl of phenol/chloroform and then precipitated by adding 290 μl of 10 m NH4OAc and 400 μl of isopropyl alcohol and incubating at room temperature for 30 min. Samples were centrifuged for 20 min, and the supernatant was removed. Pellets were washed in cold (-20 °C) 70% ethanol and resuspended in 10 μl of formamide loading buffer. Samples were denatured at 95 °C for 2 min and separated on a 10% 8 m urea-PAGE. Gels were fixed, dried, exposed to film, and, where applicable, exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (Amersham Biosciences) that was analyzed using a Storm PhosphorImager and the ImageQuant (Amersham Biosciences) program. Modeling—A homology model of the RPO132 protein was constructed using ClustalW, Swiss-PdbViewer, version 3.7, and the Swiss-Model homology modeling server (swissmodel.expasy.org/) (31Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9507) Google Scholar, 32Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55409) Google Scholar). An amino acid sequence alignment of RPO132 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae rpb2 (Protein Data Bank codes 1i6h and 1nik) was constructed using ClustalW and used by Swiss-PdbViewer to generate a structural alignment. The structural alignment was edited by hand and submitted to the SwissModel as an optimize request for construction of a homology model. The Swiss-PdbViewer was used to export views of the model as Mega-Pov scenes that were rendered using POV-Ray (www.pov-ray.org/), version 3.5, for linux. To investigate vaccinia virus postreplicative transcription elongation, we modified an in vitro release assay that had previously been used to investigate postreplicative termination (22Lackner C.A. Condit R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1485-1494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this system, a linear DNA template that is biotinylated at one or both ends is bound to streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads to form a transcription template (Fig. 1). The templates used in this study, pG8GU and pfeU1, are both under the control of the vaccinia virus intermediate G8 promoter followed by a 37-nt G-less cassette in the non-template strand. The DNA template is incubated with vaccinia virus-infected cytoplasmic extracts and with transcription buffer plus ATP, UTP, [32P]CTP, and 3′-O-methyl-GTP to initiate a pulse reaction. The incorporation of the 3′-O-methyl-GTP at the end of the 37-nt G-less cassette causes the polymerase complex to arrest at that point. The template is then isolated by binding the paramagnetic beads to a magnet, and the polymerase complex is washed in transcription buffer to remove any unassociated factors. The bead-bound complexes are resuspended in transcription buffer, and transcription elongation resumes in the chase reaction when NTPs are added and the intrinsic cleavage activity of the RNA polymerase cleaves the 3′-O-methyl-GTP residue from the arrested complex (33Hagler J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2166-2173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This cleavage activity was demonstrated for the early polymerase complex, and the ability of the postreplicative complex to recover from incorporation of a 3′-O-methyl-GTP residue indicates that this cleavage activity is also present at intermediate and late times. The two DNA templates used in this study were designed specifically to evaluate the pausing of the polymerase in the chase reaction. Following the 37-nt G-less cassette, the pG8GU template contains a 40-nt T-less cassette followed by a stretch of 9 T residues in the non-template strand, which is known to induce the pausing of the polymerase complex at limiting UTP chase concentrations (Fig. 1A). This pause site is followed by 41 nt of plasmid DNA. The pfeU1 template contains 603 nt of the vaccinia virus E1L and F17R coding regions downstream of the 37-nt G-less cassette (Fig. 1B). A portion of the E1L/F17R coding region was removed to shift a poly(T) site (15/17 nt are Ts) closer to the G8 promoter on this template. This 17-nt poly(T) site is followed by 233 nt of the remaining E1L/F17R genes and 3320 nt of plasmid DNA. To test the in vitro elongation system in a pausing assay, we initiated a pulse reaction on the pG8GU template using WT vaccinia virus extracts (Fig. 2A, lane 1). The pulse reaction yields heterogeneous transcripts ranging in size from ∼50 to 75 nt due to the presence of a 5′-poly(A) “head” averaging 30 nt in size that is added to postreplicative transcripts as a result of the RNA polymerase complex stuttering at the promoter (34Ahn B.Y. Moss B. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 226-232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Baldick Jr., C.J. Moss B. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3515-3527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Bertholet C. Van Meir E.

EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3787-3794Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 38Schwer B. Visca P. Vos J.C. Stunnenberg H.G. Cell. 1987; 50: 163-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Transcription complexes were chased in the presence of 1 mm ATP, CTP, and GTP and varying amounts of UTP for 2 or 20 min, and bead-bound transcripts (B) were separated from the released transcripts (R). The percentages of full-length and bound transcripts were calculated and graphed (Fig. 2, B and C). In the absence of UTP, the majority of the transcripts are paused at the poly(T) site in both the 2- and 20-min chase reactions (Fig. 2, A, lanes 2 and 20, and B). As increasing amounts of UTP are added, there is an increase in the amount of full-length products produced. At 1 mm UTP, little pausing seems to occur because the majority of transcripts reach full length only after a 2-min chase (Fig. 2, A, lane 18, and B). As noted previously, the amount of transcript release increases with longer chase times and there is a large increase in the percentage of released transcripts after the 20-min chase compared with the 2-min chase (Fig. 2C) (22Lackner C.A. Condit R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1485-1494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These data indicate that the poly(T) site on the pG8GU template does act as a major pause site for the polymerase complex when the complex is starved for UTP in the chase reaction. Therefore, this template serves as an excellent tool for evaluating the ability of the vaccinia virus RNA polymerase complex to elongate under various conditions. To evaluate transcription elongation on the pfeU1 template, a pulse reaction was initiated on pfeU1 with WT-infected cell extracts. The polymerase complex was washed and chased in the presence of 1 mm ATP, CTP, and GTP and either limiting (10 μm) or saturating (1 mm) amounts of UTP for various times (Fig. 3). An analysis of pause sites at saturating and limiting [UTP] demonstrates sites that are natural pauses on the template and those that are caused by reduced UTP levels, presumably at sites that contain stretches of Ts in the non-template strand of pfeU1. For example, at both UTP concentrations and all of the time points, pausing occurs at 325 and 450 nt, indicating that these are natural pause sites in the vaccinia E1L and F17R genes. Conversely, pausing occurs at 425, 475t, and 600 nt at 10 μm UTP but these pauses do not occur at 1 mm UTP. The 600-nt paused transcript is believed to correspond to the 15/17 poly(T) site in the non-template strand of pfeU1, but it is difficult to match the template sequence precisely to the transcript sizes due to the presence of the poly(A) heads on the vaccinia virus postreplicative transcripts. It is interesting to note that, at limiting amounts of UTP, it takes ∼30 min for the polymerase complex to transcribe to the end of the pfeU1 template (Fig. 3, lane 14) and that the amount of read-through does not appear to increase beyond that time (Fig. 3, compares lanes 14, 15, and 16), although at 60- and 90-min chase times, there is some degradation of larger transcripts (Fig. 3, lanes 15, 16, 31, and 32). The presence of both natural and T-rich pause sites on the pfeU1 template makes it an appropriate tool for investigating transcription of authentic vaccinia virus DNA. To determine the transcription elongation phenotype of an IBT-resistant mutant, we made transcription extracts from cells infected with a mutant vaccinia virus called IBTr90. In vivo, the IBTr90 mutant virus produces plaques of equal size whether grown in the presence or absence of IBT (28Condit R.C. Easterly R. Pacha R.F. Fathi Z. Meis R.J. Virology. 1991; 185: 857-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This mutant maps to the gene encoding the second largest subunit of the viral RNA polymerase, A24R. Sequencing the IBTr90 A24R gene revealed that it contains a Y462H mutation. We initiated a pulse reaction on the pG8GU template with WT or IBTr90 cytoplasmic extracts, washed, and chased the complexes with 1 mm ATP, CTP, GTP, and varying amounts of UTP for 5 or 30 min (Fig. 4). Overall, there is a decrease of ∼40% in the total amount of transcripts produced in a pulse reaction with the IBTr90 polymerase complex compared with the amount produced by the WT complex (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 1 and 18) (data not shown). There is also a decrease in the percentage of full-length transcripts produced by the IBTr90 polymerase compared with those produced by WT as is shown in the graphs of percentages of full-length transcripts versus chase time, which were calculated for two separate experiments (Fig. 4, A and B). For example, in the WT 5-min chase at 30 μm UTP, roughly half of the transcripts are paused and half of them are full length, whereas in the IBTr90 5-min chase at 30 μm UTP, only 18% transcripts are full length (Fig. 4, A, compare lanes 4 and 21, and B). However, the IBTr90 elongation defect only appears at limiting UTP concentrations (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 3–8 with lanes 20–25 and lanes 11–15 with lanes 28–32, B, and C). At 1 mm UTP in a 5-min chase and at 250 μm and 1 mm UTP in a 30"

During interphase, the single centrosome is duplicated and the progeny centrosomes then serve as the spindle poles during mitosis. Little is known about the signals that drive centrosome doubling. In these studies, various inhibitors and molecular approaches were used to demonstrate a role for the Stat pathway in regulating the events of centrosome doubling. Both piceatannol and a dominant negative behaving Stat3 adenovirus were able to disrupt centrosome duplication in hydroxyurea-arrested Chinese hamster ovary cells, demonstrating that Stat3 is a key signaling molecule in the events of centrosome duplication. Investigation into the role of Stat3 signaling during centrosome production demonstrated that Stat3 does not directly regulate the transcription of the centrosome genes encoding γ-tubulin and PCM-1. Instead, Stat3 apparently regulated γ-tubulin levels through post-transcriptional mechanisms whereas PCM-1 levels actually increased when Stat3 was inhibited, suggesting more complex mechanisms for regulating PCM-1 production. These studies demonstrate that Stat3 plays a vital role in centrosome duplication events, although the downstream targets of Stat3 activation leading to centrosome production remain to be established. The proposed signaling pathway utilizes Stat3 as a fundamental signaling molecule that directs the production of the various centrosome proteins indirectly.

The proposed signaling pathway utilizes Stat3 as a fundamental signaling molecule that directs the production of the various centrosome proteins indirectly. The centrosome, composed of a pair of centrioles plus pericentriolar material, is responsible for nucleating and organizing microtubules in animal cells. As the cell cycle proceeds, the centrosome is duplicated only once to allow formation of a bipolar spindle during mitosis. Improper doubling of the centrosome leads to either failed mitosis or to the formation of an aberrant multipolar spindle, which results in improper chromosome segregation. The net effect of these abnormal mitotic events is the formation of either polyploid or aneuploid cells, both of which can have deleterious effects on the cell and may have devastating consequences for a multicellular organism by contributing to the formation of cancers. The mechanisms that link centrosome doubling to other cell cycle progression events are beginning to be defined. Previous studies using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) 1The abbreviations used are: CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; Stat, signal transducer and activator of transcription; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGF-R, epidermal growth factor receptor; HU, hydroxyurea; RT, reverse transcriptase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride. cells demonstrated that activation of the EGF receptor (EGF-R) is critical for driving centrosome doubling (1Sherline P.

Ultimately, activation of the EGF-R sets in motion a series of events leading to phosphorylation of pRb and activation of E2F (4Meraldi P. Kukas J. Fry A.M. Bartek J. Nigg E.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), followed by synthesis of cyclins E and A, both of which are important for centrosome doubling through their interaction with Cdk2 (4Meraldi P.

Biol. 1999; 9: 429-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In addition, the activities of the tumor suppressor p53 and various kinases have also been shown to be critical for accurate centrosome doubling (8Fukasawa K. Choi T. Kuriyama R. Rulong S.

However, the signal transduction pathways linking EGF-R activation to the cell cycle regulators that control centrosome doubling have never been established. Studies have shown that ligand binding to EGF-R triggers a series of molecular events involving the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor (13Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4617) Google Scholar). Ligand activation induces receptor dimerization followed by tyrosine autophosphorylation, and the activated receptor then transduces the signal in the cytoplasmic compartment. Multiple EGF-R signaling relay intermediates have been identified, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (14Hsu C.Y. Mohammadi M. Nathan M. Honegger A. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Hurwitz D.R.

Ultimately, activation of these signaling intermediates results in a cellular response, which often includes regulated cell growth and proliferation. The present study investigated the mechanism of signal transduction used for controlling centrosome doubling in CHO cells. We report that Stat3 activity is necessary for centrosome doubling, whereas inhibition of either phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Ras/MAP kinase, or phospholipase Cγ had no effect on production of centrosomes. Moreover, it is demonstrated that Stat3 does not target centrosome genes directly. This suggests more complex mechanisms, which include transcriptional and translational processes, for regulating centrosome production. These studies are the first to demonstrate a role for signal transduction pathways in regulating centrosome doubling during the cell cycle. Cell Culture—CHO cells were maintained as detailed previously (3Balczon R. Bao L. Zimmer W.E. Brown K. Zinkowski R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). To induce overproduction of centrosomes, CHO cells were arrested for 40 h with 2 mm hydroxyurea (HU). To visualize centrosomes, HU-arrested CHO cells were either fixed and processed directly (see below) or were treated with 5 mm caffeine to induce mitosis (3Balczon R. Bao L. Zimmer W.E. Brown K. Zinkowski R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) because centrosomes were easier to count in mitotic cells. For some experiments, U0126 (1–25 μm), LY294002 (25–100 μm), SB202190 (1–25 μm), wortmannin (25–200 nm), U73122 (5–25 μm), or piceatannol (10–25 μm) was added to culture media at the time HU was added. Microscopy—Cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy using one of two methods. For some studies, cells on coverslips were fixed directly by immersion in –20 °C MeOH and then processed for immunofluorescence using previously reported procedures (3Balczon R. Bao L. Zimmer W.E. Brown K. Zinkowski R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). For other experiments, cells were driven into mitosis by addition of 5 mm caffeine, rounded cells were collected by mitotic shakeoff, and then the cells were centrifuged onto polylysine-coated coverslips. The coverslips were then fixed by immersion in –20 °C MeOH and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy. Antibodies used for immunofluorescence microscopy included a previously characterized anti-PCM-1 antiserum (3Balczon R. Bao L. Zimmer W.E. Brown K. Zinkowski R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), a previously described autoimmune anticentrosome antiserum (3Balczon R. Bao L. Zimmer W.E. Brown K. Zinkowski R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), and commercially available antibodies against α-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich), γ-tubulin (Covance, Princeton, NJ), and pericentrin (Covance). Electron microscopy was performed essentially as described previously (3Balczon R. Bao L. Zimmer W.E. Brown K. Zinkowski R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 27Balczon R. Chromosoma (Berl.). 2001; 110: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, CHO cells were treated with either HU alone or HU plus piceatannol, fixed, and then processed. Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoblot analysis was performed using previously reported methods (3Balczon R. Bao L. Zimmer W.E. Brown K. Zinkowski R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 27Balczon R. Chromosoma (Berl.). 2001; 110: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, extracts prepared from either randomly cycling, HU-arrested, or HU- and piceatannol-treated CHO cells were resolved by SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and then the blots were probed. The blots were developed using chemiluminescence procedures (27Balczon R. Chromosoma (Berl.). 2001; 110: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies used were a previously characterized rabbit antibody against PCM-1 (3Balczon R. Bao L. Zimmer W.E. Brown K. Zinkowski R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), anti-γ-tubulin (Covance), and antibodies against Stats 1, 3, and 5 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc). Blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-α-tubulin to verify equal loading per well. Stat3 phosphorylation status also was determined by immunoblot analysis using anti-phospho-Stat3 antibody that specifically recognized phosphotyrosine forms of Stat3 (Santa Cruz). For these studies, control CHO cells, HU-treated CHO cells, and CHO cells treated with both HU and piceatannol were collected and lysed in a buffer composed of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1mm okadaic acid, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 μg/ml each of chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin. After 20 min on ice, the preparations were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were retained, and protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). 150 μg of each extract was incubated twice for 60 min with 100 μl of Protein A-agarose beads, and then 10 μl of anti-Stat3 was added overnight at 4 °C. The following day, 50 μl of Protein A-agarose was added, and the incubation was continued at 4 °C for 90 min. The agarose beads were then pelleted and rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline followed by three rinses in phosphate-buffered saline + 0.5 m NaCl. The beads were then suspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and assayed for phospho-Stat3 by immunoblot analysis using anti-phospho-Stat3 antibody. Semiquantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from randomly cycling control CHO cells, HU-arrested CHO cells, and HU- and piceatannol-treated CHO cells using RNA Stat60 (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX) according to manufacturer recommendations. RNA samples were then amplified with the SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen) using the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. Samples were collected after varying numbers of PCR cycles, and the samples were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. For quantitation, [32P]dCTP was added to reaction mixtures. Primers used for amplification were as follows: γ-tubulin, forward, AAG CTC TAC AAC GAG AAC; reverse, GAG AAG GAT BGG TTC TGG ATG; PCM-1, forward, ATG GCY ACA GGA GGM GGT CC; reverse, GAN GAY TGN GGA GAW ATA KC; CEP135, forward, ATG ACA ACA GCT GCA GAG AG; reverse, GCT GGT TAC TCG ATT TGC ATC; and GAPDH (control), forward, CCA AAG GGT CAT CAT CTC TGC; reverse, ATT TGG CAG GTT TTT CTA GAC GG. Transfection—Although Stat3β has been shown to have functions distinct from Stat3α in cells (25Maritano D. Sugrue M.L. Tininini S. Dewilde S. Strobel B. Fu X.-P. Murray-Tait V. Chiarle R. Poli V. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), overexpression allows it to serve as a dominant negative factor by specific inhibition of Stat3 function. A dominant negative acting form of Stat3β in an adenoviral vector (Stat3-EVA) was obtained from Dr. Eric Haura (Moffitt Cancer Center, University of South Florida). The dominant negative behaving form of Stat3β (which is controlled by a cytomegalovirus promoter) and the adenoviral construct have been described previously (26Song L. Turkson J. Karras J.G. Jove R. Haura E.B. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4150-4165Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). CHO cells were infected in complete medium at a multiplicity of infection of 50–100, which resulted in >99% infection as judged by GFP expression (not shown). After 24 h, the media were replaced and HU was added. After 40 h, centrosome doubling was assayed by immunofluorescence microscopy using methods outlined earlier. Controls were infected with adenovirus containing a vector encoding GFP alone. Initial experiments were designed to ascertain which of the major cellular signaling mechanisms are involved in centrosome doubling. Broad spectrum inhibitors that disrupted the signal transduction of these various pathways were utilized. The inhibitors used were either wortmannin or LY294002. These inhibit phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, or U0126, U73122, or SB202190, which are known to inhibit extracellular regulated kinases, phospholipase Cγ, and MAP kinase pathways, respectively. Cells were also treated with piceatannol, an inhibitor of the Jak/Stat pathway. Using a centrosome replication assay that was previously developed by this laboratory, centrosome overproduction was induced by the addition of HU to the media. Cells were then either fixed directly after the appropriate incubation or treated with caffeine, which drives cells into mitosis and induces centrosome separation, allowing easier centrosome counting. To determine the effects of these various inhibitors, cells were incubated with an individual inhibitor while arrested with HU and then analyzed for centrosome synthesis by immunofluorescence microscopy using anticentrosome autoantiserum. As shown in Fig. 1A, HU-treated CHO cells synthesized multiple centrosomes with the average number of centrosomes being 4–5 per cell (Fig. 1). Also note that the HU-treated cells contained condensed and fragmented chromatin as reported previously (3Balczon R. Bao L. Zimmer W.E. Brown K. Zinkowski R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Cells treated with either LY294002 (similar results obtained using wortmannin (data not shown)), U0126, U73122, or SB202190 contained centrosome numbers close to those in cells treated with HU alone. Most of these cells also underwent nuclear envelope breakdown with fragmented chromatin. In contrast, cells treated with piceatannol and HU failed to synthesize centrosomes, and displayed only a single centrosome (Fig. 1). Moreover, few of the cells treated with piceatannol progressed to mitosis following caffeine addition, indicated by the presence of an intact nucleus. These findings suggest that the Stat pathway is a likely candidate for controlling centrosome doubling in HU-arrested CHO cells. Additional studies were performed to investigate a potential role for Stats in centrosome doubling in CHO cells. Initially, CHO cell extracts were analyzed by immunoblot analysis using antibodies against Stats 1, 3, and 5. Both Stat3 and Stat5 were shown to be present in CHO cells, but Stat1 was not identified (Fig. 2). To verify that piceatannol was inhibiting Stat activity, Stat3 was immunoprecipitated from treated cells, and the phospho-Stat3 level was measured by immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2, Stat3 phosphorylation was inhibited by >80% (n = 3) in piceatannol-treated cells. To determine whether the activity of Stats is important for centrosome doubling, a dominant negative behaving adenoviral construct of Stat3, called Stat3β, was utilized to disrupt the normal function of the Stat3 signaling pathway. Cells were infected with either a GFP control adenovirus or a GFP dominant negative Stat3, HU was added, and then infected cells were analyzed by immunofluorescence using anticentrosome autoantiserum. Cells that were treated with either HU alone or HU following infection with GFP control adenovirus overproduced centrosomes (Fig. 2). However, centrosome synthesis was blocked in cells treated with HU following infection with the dominant negative form of Stat3. To demonstrate clearly that centrosome doubling was arrested by inhibition of Stat signaling, electron microscopy was utilized. As shown in Fig. 3, cells treated with HU alone produced multiple centrosomes, in agreement with previous studies (3Balczon R. Bao L. Zimmer W.E. Brown K. Zinkowski R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 27Balczon R. Chromosoma (Berl.). 2001; 110: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In contrast, cells treated with HU and piceatannol contained only one centrosome, as indicated by the presence of only a single or double centriole cylinder. Collectively, these experiments established a role for Stat3 in centrosome doubling events, suggesting that Stat3 is pivotal for controlling this event in CHO cells. To understand further the molecular mechanisms controlled by Stat3 signaling during centrosome doubling, semiquantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis were used to measure the levels of centrosome mRNA and protein, respectively, in treated cells. Initially, RT-PCR determined that levels of γ-tubulin mRNA (Fig. 4) and CEP135 mRNA (not shown) were approximately equal in control, HU-treated, and HU- and piceatannol-treated CHO cells. Similar results were obtained when dominant negative Stat3 infected cells were analyzed (not shown). In contrast, levels of PCM-1 mRNA were increased in cells treated with HU and piceatannol (Fig. 5). As shown in Fig. 5, PCM-1 mRNA could be detected after only 20 PCR cycles in cells treated with HU and piceatannol, and quantitation of mRNA levels after 30 cycles determined that the mRNA levels in piceatannol-treated cells were 8–10-fold higher than the levels in HU-treated cells and 2–3-fold higher than in untreated control cells. Similar effects on PCM-1 mRNA levels were observed in Stat3 dominant negative expressing cells (not shown).Fig. 5Effects of Stat inhibition on PCM-1.a, semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed utilizing RNA isolated from control (C), HU-treated (HU), or HU- and piceatannol-treated (PIC) cells.

Bar, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Experiments were then performed to measure γ-tubulin and PCM-1 protein levels in control, HU-treated, and HU- and piceatannol-treated CHO cells. As shown in Fig. 4, γ-tubulin levels increased slightly in HU-treated cells relative to control cells, which was consistent with the increased numbers of centrosomes in HU-treated cells. In contrast, γ-tubulin could not be detected by immunoblot analysis in cells treated with HU and piceatannol. To verify the decrease in γ-tubulin levels, immunofluorescence microscopy of control and piceatannol-treated cells was performed using antibodies against γ-tubulin. As shown in Fig. 4, centrosomes were not observed in cells treated with HU and piceatannol, further demonstrating that γ-tubulin levels are greatly reduced following inhibition of Stat signaling. Using anti-PCM-1 antibodies, immunoblot analysis of control, HU-treated, and HU- and piceatannol-treated cells gave results very different from those obtained using γ-tubulin antiserum. As shown in Fig. 5, PCM-1 protein levels were increased in HU-treated cells relative to levels in untreated controls, which was expected because centrosome numbers were increased in HU-treated cells. However, in contrast to what was observed for γ-tubulin, levels of PCM-1 protein were higher in cells treated with HU and piceatannol relative to levels in either untreated controls or HU-arrested CHO cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy of HU- and piceatannol-treated cells showed that the overexpressed PCM-1 protein was localized in the perinuclear region, although it did not appear to be organized into the centrosome complex (Fig. 5). Because γ-tubulin is critical for proper microtubule nucleation and organization, immunofluorescence microscopy using antibodies against α-tubulin was performed on control, HU-treated, and HU- and piceatannol-treated CHO cells. As shown in Fig. 6, both control and HU-treated CHO cells contained elaborate and organized microtubule arrays. In contrast, cells treated with the combination of HU and piceatannol contained very few microtubules, and the present microtubules were poorly organized (Fig. 6). Centrosome doubling is a vital process that ensures that a functional bipolar spindle is formed during mitosis. The signaling pathways that are involved in controlling centrosome duplication remain to be elucidated. In this study, experiments were performed to identify which signal transduction pathways are involved in centrosome duplication during the cell cycle, and it was demonstrated that the Stat pathway plays a role in controlling centrosome doubling events. Broad spectrum inhibitor studies, plus more specific inhibition using a dominant negative acting Stat3β construct, revealed a role solely for the Stat pathway and failed to identify a role for any of the other main cellular signaling pathways in centrosome doubling. These results, verified using both immunofluorescence and electron microscopy, compellingly demonstrate a role for Stat3 in regulation of centrosome doubling in CHO cells. In this laboratory, previous studies using HU arrest of CHO cells demonstrated a role for EGF in triggering the events of centrosome duplication (3Balczon R. Bao L. Zimmer W.E. Brown K.

The proposed studies investigate which of these pathways was involved in signal relay from the EGF receptor to the actual events controlling centrosome doubling. The data shown in Figs. 1, 2, 3 clearly demonstrate a role for Stat3 in activating centrosome doubling in CHO cells. Whether Stat3 acts exclusively to control centrosome duplication or functions as a heterodimer with Stat5 remains to be established. However, the observation that Stat5 knock-out mice are viable (28Akira S. Stem Cells (Research Triangle Park, NC). 1999; 17: 138-146Google Scholar) argues against a role for Stat5 in a fundamental process such as centrosome doubling. Moreover, the observation that Stat3 regulates centrosome doubling events may be important for various reasons. For example, Stat3 has been implicated as an oncogene, and constitutive activation of Stat3 has been detected in various cancer cell types (26Song L. Turkson J. Karras J.G. Jove R. Haura E.B. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4150-4165Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 29Toyonaga T. Nakano K. Nagano M. Zhao G. Yamaguchi K. Kuroki S. Eguchi T. Chijiiwa K. Tsuneyoshi M. Tanaka M.

Physiol. 2003; 197: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Centrosome overproduction has also been detected in various cancers, and overproduction of centrosomes leading to the formation of multipolar spindles may contribute to the aneuploidy associated with various cancers (33Brinkley B.R. Goepfert T.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 41: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to investigate tumors with constitutively active Stat3 for centrosome overproduction. In addition, these results may help to explain why Stat3 knock-out mice die early during embryogenesis (28Akira S. Stem Cells (Research Triangle Park, NC). 1999; 17: 138-146Google Scholar). Although there are several possible causes for embryonic lethality when Stat3 is knocked out, clearly the inability to duplicate centrosomes would lead to a mitotic arrest phenotype. The potential mode of action for Stat3 to regulate synthesis of various centrosome components was also investigated. The results demonstrate that different centrosome genes and proteins are regulated differentially by Stat3. Specifically, γ-tubulin levels appear to be regulated post-transcriptionally by Stat3 whereas levels of PCM-1 mRNA and protein both increase during Stat3 inhibition. These data may indicate one of two possibilities. First, each centrosome component may exhibit a unique mechanism of gene regulation by Stat3. Alternatively, the different behavior of these two proteins may indicate differential regulation of separate classes of centrosome proteins. For example, γ-tubulin and various other proteins are involved in regulating microtubule nucleation directly (34Weise C. Zheng Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 358-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), whereas other proteins fulfill structural roles within the centrosome (35Dictenberg J.B. Zimmerman W. Spares C.A. Young A. Vidair C Zheng Y Carrington W. Fay F.S. Doxsey S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). PCM-1, in contrast, performs an unknown function related to cell cycle progression (36Balczon R. Simerly C. Takahashi D. Schatten G. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 2002; 52: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It is possible that different classes of centrosome genes will exhibit separate mechanisms of regulation related either to an essential function of the centrosome (i.e. microtubule nucleation) or to a proliferation-specific function of the centrosome (i.e. duplication). Additional studies investigating numerous centrosome components are needed to test these possibilities. The regulation of γ-tubulin and PCM-1 levels by Stat3 does not appear to be direct, and more complex mechanisms of regulation must be proposed. If Stat3 regulated these two genes directly, the levels of PCM-1 and γ-tubulin mRNAs would drop when Stat3 activity was blocked. However, the levels of PCM-1 mRNA and protein increased whereas the level of γ-tubulin mRNA was unchanged in either HU or piceatannol-treated cells relative to controls. Instead, γ-tubulin protein levels dropped when Stat3 activity was blocked. The results related to PCM-1 can be explained by one of two mechanisms. In one scheme, Stat3 controls the synthesis of a factor that regulates the synthesis of PCM-1 mRNA. When Stat3 is inhibited, this putative factor is lost and PCM-1 mRNA and protein are overproduced. Alternatively, Stat3 may control the synthesis of a factor that regulates PCM-1 mRNA degradation during the cell cycle. Failure to synthesize this putative molecule would lead to build-up of PCM-1 mRNA and protein. Because little is known about the regulation of PCM-1 synthesis, it is not possible to test these two hypotheses at present. The results concerning γ-tubulin are more difficult to explain. As shown in Fig. 4, γ-tubulin mRNA levels remain relatively unchanged during either HU treatment (when centrosomes are overproduced) or when Stat3 is inhibited (and centrosome production is blocked). Along with previous results, which demonstrate that γ-tubulin levels do not fluctuate during the cell cycle (37Dumontet C. Duran G.E. Steger K.A. Murphy G.L. Sussman H.H. Sikic B.I. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1996; 35: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the data indicate that γ-tubulin behaves more like a housekeeping gene, in that its mRNA production does not depend on growth factor activation or cell cycling. However, it is difficult to explain the precipitous drop in γ-tubulin protein levels when Stat3 activity is blocked. Perhaps Stat3 regulates the synthesis of a component that controls either the production or degradation of γ-tubulin. Like PCM-1, little is known about the regulation of γ-tubulin synthesis during the cell cycle, so these possibilities cannot be tested. Regardless, the data concerning PCM-1 and γ-tubulin synthesis in cells where Stat3 is inhibited indicate that production of centrosome subunits is a complex process with varied mechanisms of regulation. Cells in which Stat3 activity was inhibited contained few microtubules and perinuclear aggregates of PCM-1. The simplest interpretation for the decrease in microtubules is that in the absence of γ-tubulin (which is necessary for microtubule nucleation (38Shu H.B. Joshi H.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1137-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar)) microtubules cannot be nucleated or organized properly. Concerning the perinuclear aggregates of PCM-1 (Fig. 5), it was recently demonstrated that PCM-1 contains two domains that control self-association (39Kubo A. Tsukita S. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 919-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Moreover, when PCM-1 fragments containing these self-association domains were overexpressed, the PCM-1 fragments were able to assemble into aggregates similar to those observed in CHO cells following piceatannol treatment. In preliminary studies to test directly whether untreated CHO cells would assemble perinuclear aggregates of PCM-1, plasmids were transfected encoding full-length PCM-1 into CHO cells (data not shown). However, aggregation of PCM-1 in those cells was not achieved because obtained levels of PCM-1 overexpression were not equivalent to levels detected in piceatannol-treated cells in the PCM-1 transfection experiments. In summary, these studies demonstrate a role for Stat3 in the events leading to accurate centrosome doubling in CHO cells. Previous studies utilizing HU-arrested CHO cells for studying the regulation of centrosome doubling have contributed significantly to our understanding of how centrosome duplication is coordinated with other cell cycle progression events. Activation of the EGF receptor in CHO cells (3Balczon R. Bao L. Zimmer W.E. Brown K. Zinkowski R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) ultimately sets in motion a series of events leading to inhibition of Rb and activation of E2F (4Meraldi P. Kukas J. Fry A.M.

Biol. 1999; 9: 429-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), and assembly of centrosomes. The reported studies demonstrate that Stat3 acts in the signal transduction pathway in CHO cells leading from EGF receptor activation to the nucleus during centrosome doubling. However, these studies also demonstrate that Stat3 does not control the centrosome genes directly (at least γ-tubulin and PCM-1) and suggest that downstream targets between Stat3 and regulation of centrosome gene expression remain to be identified. Identifying these downstream targets will be critical to elucidating the mechanisms that control the regulation of the synthesis of centrosome subunits and assembly of those subunits into a functional centrosome during the cell cycle. Finally, the reported data demonstrate that expression of centrosome genes is controlled by multiple mechanisms (including translational and pre-translational processes) in mammalian cells, highlighting the complexity of the coordination of centrosome duplication and cell cycle progression."

Whereas the study of the in vitro enzymatic activity of NEP2 shows that it resembles that of NEP as it cleaves the same substrates often at the same amide bonds and binds the same inhibitory compounds albeit with different potencies, its physiological role remains elusive because of the lack of selective inhibitors. To aid in the design of these novel compounds and better understand the different inhibitory patterns of NEP and NEP2, the x-ray structure of NEP was used as a template to build a model of the NEP2 active site. The results of our modeling suggest that the overall structure of NEP2 closely resembles that of NEP. The model of the active site reveals a 97% sequence identity with that of NEP with differences located within the S′2 subsite of NEP2 where Ser133 and Leu739 replace two glycine residues in NEP. To validate the proposed model, site-directed mutagenesis was performed on a series of residues of NEP2, mutants expressed in AtT20 cells, and their ability to bind various substrates and inhibitory compounds was tested. The results confirm the involvement of the conserved Arg131 and Asn567 in substrate binding and catalytic activity of NEP2 and further show that the modifications in its S′2 pocket, particularly the presence therein of Leu739, account for a number of differences in inhibitor binding between NEP and NEP2.

Swerts J.P. Guyon A. Roques B.P. Schwartz J.C. Nature. 1978; 276: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Thereafter, it was shown to hydrolyze a number of biologically active peptides into inactive fragments in vitro, such as tachykinins (17Matsas R. Fulcher I.S. Kenny A.J. Turner A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The physiological implication of NEP in the inactivation of these messenger peptides was confirmed in vivo by the design and use of selective and potent inhibitors, e.g. thiorphan (21Patey G.

Nature. 1980; 288: 286-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). These functions of NEP and the design of specific inhibitors thereof are of considerable interest, because the inhibitors of NEP have recently been introduced in human gastroenterologic (25Baumer P. Danquechin-Dorval E. Bertrand J. Vetel J.M. Schwartz J.C. Lecomte J.M. Gut. 1992; 33: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and cardiovascular (26Bralet J. Schwartz J.C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 106-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) therapeutic fields. Whereas NEP is widely distributed in peripheral tissues, NEP2 displays a highly restricted localization expressed exclusively in the central nervous system and testis (1Ouimet T. Facchinetti P. Rose C. Bonhomme M.C. Gros C. Schwartz J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 27Facchinetti P. Rose C. Schwartz J.C. Ouimet T. Neuroscience. 2003; 118: 627-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). NEP2 also possesses the particularity of being coded for by a single gene with two major splice variants, one leading to a secreted protein by the insertion of a subtilisin-type cleavage site immediately after the transmembrane domain. This isoform (NEP2(s)) is expressed in round spermatids of the testis (1Ouimet T. Facchinetti P. Rose C. Bonhomme M.C. Gros C. Schwartz J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 3Ghaddar G. Ruchon A.F. Carpentier M. Marcinkiewicz M. Seidah N.G. Crine P. Desgroseillers L. Boileau G. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 419-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The second isoform, mainly expressed in CNS, does not include the subtilisin-type cleavage site and thus leads to a membrane-bound protein (1Ouimet T. Facchinetti P. Rose C. Bonhomme M.C. Gros C. Schwartz J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 28Rose C. Voisin S. Gros C. Schwartz J.C. Ouimet T. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Expression of these isoforms in the endocrine corticotrope cell line AtT20 shows that both secreted and membrane-bound isoforms have identical catalytic activities and that they resemble the catalytic activity of NEP insofar, as they have been shown to cleave many of the same substrates, such as tachykinins and enkephalins, at the same amide bonds and with comparable kinetic parameters (28Rose C. Voisin S. Gros C. Schwartz J.C. Ouimet T. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). All of the transition state inhibitors of NEP also inhibit NEP2 activity. Thus, whereas the generic compound phosphoramidon binds both proteases with comparably high affinity (nanomolar range), thiorphan, a specific inhibitor of NEP also inhibits NEP2 at nanomolar concentrations but with an affinity 30 times higher for NEP than for NEP2 (28Rose C. Voisin S. Gros C. Schwartz J.C. Ouimet T. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The detailed study of the localization of NEP2 in the nervous system shows that it is widely distributed therein with a generally complementary pattern to that of NEP, although both enzymes are co-expressed in some areas, particularly in the neocortex and red nucleus (1Ouimet T. Facchinetti P. Rose C. Bonhomme M.C. Gros C. Schwartz J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 27Facchinetti P. Rose C. Schwartz J.C. Ouimet T. Neuroscience. 2003; 118: 627-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The most striking complementarity of NEP and NEP2 expression no doubt lies in the basal ganglia where the highest expression of NEP can be observed in caudate putamen and nucleus accumbens, regions that are devoid of NEP2 expression. The high expression of NEP in these regions had already been observed by immunocytochemistry (30Pollard H. Llorens-Cortes C. Couraud J.Y. Ronco P. Verroust P. Schwartz J.C. Neurosci. Lett. 1987; 77: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) as well as by the quantification of NEP activity (31Llorens C. Schwartz J.C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1981; 69: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and is in accordance with its potential role in the inactivation of endogenous tachykinins (32Mauborgne A. Bourgoin S. Benoliel J.J. Hirsch M. Berthier J.L. Hamon M. Cesselin F. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1987; 243: 674-680PubMed Google Scholar) and enkephalins of the striatonigral pathway (21Patey G. De La Baume S. Schwartz J.C. Gros C. Roques B. Fournie-Zaluski M.C. Soroca-Lucas E. Science. 1981; 212: 1153-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, this may not exclude a functional role of NEP2 in the inactivation of these neuropeptides, which it efficiently cleaves in vitro, because neurons of the striatonigral pathway project upon the substantia nigra pars reticulata, a NEP2-expressing region, devoid of NEP. The identification of NEP2 and the realization that once thought NEP-specific compounds are not as specific as expected bring forward the necessity to reassess the respective functions of NEP and NEP2 in the inactivation of endogenous messenger peptides, particularly in the brain. The design and synthesis of new discriminatory inhibitory compounds will not only constitute useful tools in this endeavor but may be of considerable interest in clinical treatment. The three-dimensional structure of NEP has recently been elucidated by its co-crystallization with the inhibitory compound phosphoramidon (33Oefner C. D'Arcy A. Hennig M. Winkler F.K. Dale G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). This structure provides a new template to model the structure of metalloproteases of the M13 family clearly superior to the one available thus far, that of the bacterial enzyme thermolysin, which possesses little sequence identity with these mammalian metalloproteases, although it shares considerable similarities in its catalytic activity and inhibitory profile with NEP (34Hersh L.B. Morihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6433-6437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Pozgay M. Michaud C. Liebman M. Orlowski M.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 592-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Because of the high sequence identity between NEP and NEP2 and to better characterize the specific pharmacological profile of NEP2 as well as to aid in the design of potent and selective inhibitors of NEP2, we have used the three-dimensional structure of NEP to build and refine a model of the NEP2 active site. The obtained model was validated by site-directed mutagenesis of relevant residues in rNEP2(s), and the expression of these NEP2 mutants in AtT20 cells allowed us to study the impact of such substitutions on the kinetic parameters and affinities of the produced enzymes toward a series of substrates and inhibitory compounds. Materials—The synthetic fluorogenic substrate Suc-AAF-AMC, dipeptides and related amidated dipeptides, and biological peptides were purchased from Bachem (Voisins le Bretonneux, France). Phosphoramidon was from Sigma (Saint Quentin Fallavier, France), and thiorphan and synthetic compounds I to IV were generous gifts from Denis Danvy and Thierry Monteil (Bioprojet, Paris, France). Building and Refinement of a Three-dimensional Model of rNEP2— Amino acid sequences of hNEP (Swiss-Prot accession number P08473) and of rNEP2(s) were aligned using the ClustalW multiple alignment program (37Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56003) Google Scholar). A slow pairwise alignment using BLOSUM matrix series (38Henikoff S. Henikoff J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10915-10919Crossref PubMed Scopus (4363) Google Scholar) and a gap-opening penalty of 15.0 were chosen for aligning the primary sequences. The three-dimensional model of NEP2 in complex with phosphoramidon was constructed by mutating the side chains of the amino acids in the hNEP-phosphoramidon structure (Protein Data Bank code 1dmt) to the respective side chains in NEP2. Standard geometries for the mutated side chains were given by the BIOPOLYMER module of the Sybyl 6.8 package (TRIPOS Associates, Inc.). Whenever possible, the side chain torsional angles were kept to the values occurring in hNEP. Otherwise, a short scanning of side chain angles was performed to remove steric clashes between the mutated side chain and the other amino acids. Insertions/deletions occurred only in loops but not in secondary structure elements (α-helix, β-sheet). The insertions/deletions in the loops were achieved through a simple knowledge-based loop search procedure using the LOOPSEARCH module of the SYBYL package (TRIPOS Associates, Inc). In this procedure, a set of 1478 high resolution x-ray structures was searched for loops of similar length and similar distance between the Cα atoms of the residues delimiting the loop window. The loop showing the highest homology and the lowest root mean square deviations was then selected for insertion in the model. After the heavy atoms were modeled, all of the hydrogen atoms were added and the protein coordinates were then minimized with AMBER 6.0 (39Case D.A. Pearlman D.A. Caldwell J.W. Cheatham III, D.E. Ross W.S. Simmerling C.L. Darden T.A. Merz K.M. Stanton R.V. Cheng A.L. Vincent J.J. Crowley M. Tsui V. Radmer R.J. Duan Y. Pitera J. Massova I. Seibel G.L. Singh U.C. Weiner P.K. Kollman P.A.

Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5179-5197Crossref Scopus (11640) Google Scholar). The phosphoramidon molecule was parameterized for AMBER 6.0 using a previously described procedure (41Rognan D. Mukhija S. Folkers G. Zerbe O. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 2001; 15: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The minimizations were carried out by 2,000 steps of steepest descent followed by conjugate gradient minimization until the root mean square gradient of the potential energy was <0.05 kcal·mol-1·Å-2. A twin cut-off (10.0 and 15.0 Å) was used to calculate non-bonded electrostatic interactions at every minimization step, and the non-bonded pair list was updated every 25 steps. A distance-dependent (ϵ = 4r) dielectric function was used. Ligand Docking—The three-dimensional coordinates of compound II obtained as previously described (42Bissantz C. Folkers G. Rognan D. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 4759-4767Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar) were automatically docked into the above-described ligand-free coordinates of NEP2 as well as to those of NEP using 7–8 times speed-up parameters of the GOLD 2.0 docking tool (43Jones G. Wilett P. Glen R.C. Leach A.R. Taylor R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 727-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (5465) Google Scholar). To account for a proper coordination to the zinc ion, a distance constraint was defined between the zinc and the thiol sulfur atom of compound II assuming an intermolecular distance between 1.8 and 2.1 Å and a spring constant of 5 kcal·mol-1·Å-2. To further speed up the calculation, the genetic algorithm docking was stopped when the top three solutions were within a root mean square deviation of 1.5 Å. Site-directed Mutagenesis of rNEP2(s)—The rNEP2(s)-expressing plasmid, pcDNA-rNEP2(s), has been previously described (28Rose C. Voisin S. Gros C. Schwartz J.C. Ouimet T. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Double-stranded mutagenesis of rNEP2(s) was carried out using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech) following the manufacturer's instructions. All of the constructs were completely sequenced using an automated Licor sequencer to confirm the authenticity of the different mutations as well as the integrity of the NEP2 coding sequence. Expression of Wild-type and Mutated Forms of rNEP2(s) in AtT20 Cells—AtT20 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Transient transfections of wild-type and mutated rNEP2(s) constructs were performed using Superfect (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) according to the supplier's instructions. After 3 h at 37 °C, the transfection medium was replaced by a low protein, serum-free medium, CHO-S-SFM II (Invitrogen). Routinely, the conditioned media were collected 72 h post-transfection and concentrated 10-fold using the centrifugal filter device (Centriprep 30, Amicon). Cells from 140-mm plates were scraped, harvested in ice-cold Hepes buffer (100 mm, pH 7.2, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and disrupted with a Polytron (Kinematica, Lucerne, Switzerland). Membranes were obtained by centrifugation (30,000 × g for 1 h), resuspended in Hepes buffer, and sonicated (twice for 5 s). Antibody Production and Immunoblotting—The complete C-terminal region of NEP2 (from residue 83 to 769, see Fig. 1) was amplified using the following oligonucleotides: 5′-GCGAATTCGACATCTGTACTACCCC-3′ and 5′-GCCGCTCGAGTCGATTCATAGGGTGCAT-3′, where nucleotides in italics correspond to added EcoRI and XhoI cloning sites, respectively. After digestion with the appropriate restriction enzymes, the amplicon was subcloned into the pET24a vector (a kind gift from Dr. J. C. Barale, Pasteur Institute, Paris, France) and grown in BL21 cells and the corresponding 85-kDa protein was purified and sent to Eurogentech for an immunization protocol. For immunoblotting experiments, samples were diluted in loading buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 15% glycerol, 3% SDS, 3% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% bromphenol blue), subjected to SDS/PAGE on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad), and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences). After1hin Tris-buffered saline (0.1 m Tris-HCl, 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 0.2% Tween 20 and 5% bovine serum albumin, blots were incubated with the NEP2-specific polyclonal antibody (diluted 1/10,000) for 16 h at 4 °C. Immunoblots were revealed after a 1-h incubation with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-coupled IgG (diluted 1/3000) using Supersignal (Perbio Science France, Bezons, France). Enzyme Activity Assays and Inhibitory Potencies—Enzymatic activities of the wild-type and mutated forms of rNEP2(s) were assayed essentially as described in Rose et al. (28Rose C. Voisin S. Gros C. Schwartz J.C. Ouimet T. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For Km determinations, the incubation mixtures were comprised of 20–50 μg of the concentrated conditioned media and from 7.8 to 1000 μm Suc-AAF-AMC in 100 μl of 100 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.2, containing 0.15 m NaCl and 0.01% Triton X-100. Incubations were allowed to proceed for 60 min at 37 °C followed by a 60-min incubation with an excess of aminopeptidase M (Pierce) to release fluorescent AMC. The enzyme concentrations were quantified by densitometric analysis of immunoblots using the known amounts of purified NEP2 standards (28Rose C. Voisin S. Gros C. Schwartz J.C. Ouimet T. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Inhibitory potencies were determined as follows. After a 15-min preincubation with 20–50 μg of conditioned media and inhibitors or dipeptides in 100 μl of 100 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.2, containing 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01% Triton X-100, a 20 μm concentration of the model substrate, Suc-AAF-AMC, was added and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 60 min at 37 °C followed by a 60-min incubation with aminopeptidase M. For inhibitory potencies of compounds against NEP, a pure recombinant soluble form of human NEP was used as previously described by Rose et al. (28Rose C. Voisin S. Gros C. Schwartz J.C. Ouimet T. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Inhibitors were tested at concentrations ranging from 1 pm to 10 μm, and peptides from 1 μm to 1 mm. The Ki values were calculated from the IC50 values using the Cheng and Prussoff equation. Statistical Analysis—The Student's t tests were performed using the Instat program. The NEP2 isoforms, NEP2(m) and NEP2(s), are identical in their large C-terminal core, possess identical enzymatic properties, and are inhibited by the same compounds with comparable potencies (28Rose C. Voisin S. Gros C. Schwartz J.C. Ouimet T. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To ease the study and production of NEP, a secreted form of this enzyme was engineered (secNEP) (44Lemay G. Waksman G. Roques B.P. Crine P. Boileau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15620-15623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was found to have the same enzymatic properties as the natural enzyme. It is this type of construct that was used in the crystallographic study of NEP (33Oefner C. D'Arcy A. Hennig M. Winkler F.K. Dale G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The model of the active site of NEP2 being based on the alignment of the C-terminal domains of model and template thus applies to both isoforms of NEP2 on one hand as well as to rNEP2 and human NEP2 on the other hand, because both active sites align perfectly (100% sequence identity, data not shown). Coordinates used for NEP2 correspond to rNEP2(s), because this isoform was used in the site-directed mutagenesis studies. Description of the NEP2 Active Site Model: Comparison to the NEP Active Site Structure—The overall protein sequence similarity between rNEP2(s) and hNEP is of 67% with the highest degree of homology located in the distal C-terminal part of the protein, which contains the active-site consensus sequence HEXXH (75% over the last 250 amino acids). Because this high degree of sequence similarity between the two proteins strongly suggests that they have evolved from a common ancestor, we used the recently solved structure of hNEP as a template to build and refine a NEP2 active site model as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The three-dimensional structure of NEP2 closely resembles that of NEP, because it is constituted by two domains: the first (domain 1) containing the active site and a second (domain 2) presumably acting as a molecular sieve with both domains separated by interdomain linker fragments (data not shown). Coordinates of phosphoramidon were taken from the respective hNEP complex and merged into the NEP2 model. The active site of both enzymes was then designed as any amino acid included into a 6-Å radius sphere centered on the inhibitor. The NEP2 active site model thus obtained was highly similar to the hNEP structure, both active sites displaying 97 and 86% amino acid sequence similarity and identity, respectively (Fig. 1). The conserved zinc binding motif, HEITH, from template and model is well superimposed. The zinc ion is coordinated in an approximately tetrahedral geometry (Fig. 2A), and its binding involves a single oxygen atom of the tetrahedral N-phosphoryl moiety of the inhibitor and three ligands from the protein: His608; His612; and Glu671 for NEP2, respectively (His583, His587, and Glu646 for hNEP). The catalytically important residues involved in inhibitor binding from template and model are perfectly matched. For instance, Arg742 of NEP2 (Arg717 in hNEP) interacts with the inhibitor by forming a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen atom of the l-leucyl residue in the P′1 position, the carbonyl oxygen atom of Ala568 of NEP2 (Ala543 in hNEP) is hydrogen-bonded with the peptide amide group of the P′1 residue of phosphoramidon, and the side chain of Asn567 of NEP2 (Asn542 in hNEP) forms two hydrogen bonds with the amide and carboxyl groups of the P′2 residue of the inhibitor (Fig. 2A). Additionally, the side chain of Arg131 of NEP2 (Arg102 in hNEP) does not allow a direct hydrogen bond but may form a two water-mediated interaction with the terminal carbonyl group of the inhibitor as in hNEP. NEP and NEP2 cleave peptidic substrates at the N terminus of aromatic or large hydrophobic residues, which constitute the P′1 amino acid in the P2-P1-P′1-P′2 commonly accepted Schechter and Berger nomenclature. The specificity of these enzymes is therefore the result of specific interactions of the P′1 and P′2 side chains within the S′1 and S′2 subsites of the enzyme. The S′1 subsites of the NEP2 model and hNEP template are quasi-identical. They form a large hydrophobic pocket containing the side chains of Phe135, Ala568, Ile583, Phe588, Met604, Val605, His608, Val717, and Trp718 for NEP2 (Phe106, Ala543, Ile558, Phe563, Met579, Val580, His583, Val692, and Trp693 for hNEP, respectively) (Fig. 2B). There is a single amino acid difference between model and template in this subsite (Tyr714 for NEP2 (Phe689 in hNEP)), but this amino acid lies in the far end of the pocket and does not directly interact with the inhibitor. However, more important differences between model and template were observed in the region of the S′2 subsite. In the hNEP structure, the side chains of Arg102, Asp107, and Arg110 form this pocket but in the NEP2 model, even if the respective amino acid side chains of Arg131, Asp136, and Arg139 are equally present, the ones of Ser133 and Leu739 are found at positions filled by two glycine residues, Gly104 and Gly714, in hNEP (Fig. 2C). On one hand, the side chain of Ser133 and, more significantly, that of Leu739 should occupy more space than their corresponding Gly104 and Gly714 residues in hNEP and/or, on the other hand, change the binding of substrates or inhibitors. Another amino acid, Phe726 (Tyr702 in hNEP), differs between model and template i"

The connection between affinity and species specificity was studied by exploring the recognition properties of two structurally related cohesin species of divergent specificity. The cohesins were examined by progressive rounds of swapping, in which corresponding homologous stretches were interchanged. The specificity of binding of the resultant chimeric cohesins was determined by enzyme-linked affinity assay and complementary protein microarray. In succeeding rounds, swapped segments were systematically contracted, according to the binding behavior of previously generated chimeras. In the fourth and final round we discerned three residues, reputedly involved in interspecies binding specificity. By replacing only these three residues, we were able to convert the specificity of the resultant mutated cohesin, which bound preferentially to the rival dockerin with ∼20% capacity of the wild-type interaction. These residues represent but 3 of the 16 contact residues that participate in the cohesin-dockerin interaction. This approach allowed us to differentiate, in a structure-independent fashion, between residues critical for interspecies recognition and binding residues per se.

The incorporation of enzyme subunits into the cellulosome complex is mediated by a high affinity protein-protein interaction, in which cohesin modules, located on a cellulosomal scaffoldin subunit, bind tenaciously to complementary dockerin domains, borne by the enzyme subunits (1Bayer E.A.

The precise molecular basis for this interaction has been the subject of intensive investigation during the past several years. Within a given species, the cohesin-dockerin interaction generally appears to lack specificity in that the various cohesins of the primary scaffoldin tend to generally recognize the dockerins derived from the different enzyme subunits (4Yaron S.

The biological significance of the observed intraspecies fidelity versus cross-species variance remains to be elucidated. Crystal structures of cohesins from Clostridium thermocellum and from Clostridium cellulolyticum were first reported, from which the overall shape and topology were determined (8Shimon L.J.W.

On the basis of various analyses of the cohesin surface (comparative bioinformatics, homology modeling, electrostatic potential), the approximate location of the dockerin-binding surface was proposed (8Shimon L.J.W.

The corresponding face of the proposed binding surface comprised contiguous β-strands 8, 3, 6, and 5 of the all-β jelly-roll structure. The general fold is representative of an important type of stable protein fold that characterizes different families of protein modules, including carbohydrate-binding modules and certain carbohydrases (11Bayer E.A.

On the other hand, we reasoned that not all of the interactions would be necessary for interspecies specificity. We therefore embarked upon an alternative approach, designed to explicitly provide insight into the distinctive binding characteristics of the cohesin module, with the intention of identifying residues that confer species specificity. The approach used in this work involved progressive swapping of corresponding homologous stretches of the cohesin modules from C. thermocellum and C. cellulolyticum. The resultant chimeric cohesins were then screened using an enzyme-linked affinity assay and complementary protein microarray to provide insight into the residue(s) involved in the binding specificity as opposed to general binding. The progressive nature of this approach stems from the linkage between the experimentally determined specificity of the interaction and the identity of the homologous segments. With each successive generation of homologue swapping, the reactive segments were constricted until only three selected residues of the C. cellulolyticum cohesin were mutated, resulting in a viable cohesin mutant that preferentially recognized the rival dockerin. During the course of this study, a crystal structure for the cohesin-dockerin heterodimer was elucidated from the C. thermocellum cellulosome (24Carvalho A.L. Dias F.M. Prates J.A. Nagy T.

QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was used for small-scale plasmid isolation. The QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) was used for purification of PCR products and QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) for elution of DNA from agarose gels. All restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), T7 DNA polymerase (Takara, Otsu, Shiga, Japan)), alkaline phosphatase, and T4 DNA ligase (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) were used as recommended by the manufacturer. Transformation of Escherichia coli strains was performed as described previously (25Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, Cold Spring Harbor, New York2001: 1.116-1.118Google Scholar). Sequencing was performed using an ABI 3700 DNA sequencing apparatus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). Construction of Overexpression Plasmids—The dockerin modules of celA of C. cellulolyticum (DocC) and celS of C. thermocellum (DocT) were amplified using the primers DA-F/DA-R and DS-F/DS-R, respectively (the sequences of the primers are listed in Table SI, see Supplementary Material). Both PCR products were digested with KpnI and BamHI and cloned separately into the KpnI/BamHI-linearized plasmid pMalc2e (New England Biolabs), which resulted in the plasmids, pMalc2e-docC and pMalc2e-docT, respectively. In order to prepare an expression vector for production of CBM fusion proteins, the gene encoding for the C. thermocellum CBM3 module (4Yaron S. Morag E. Bayer E.A. Lamed R. Shoham Y. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) was first inserted upstream of the multiple cloning site of pET28a. The cbm3 gene was amplified using the primers CM-F/CM-R (Table SI, see Supplementary Material). The desired PCR fragment was cleaved using BspHI and NcoI and ligated into an NcoI-linearized pET28a plasmid (Novagen, Madison, WI). The clone with cbm3 in the correct orientation was identified by sequencing and named plasmid pET28a-cbm3. The genes encoding for the C. cellulolyticum and C. thermocellum cohesin modules were amplified using primers Fc/Rc and Ft/Rt, respectively (Table SI, see Supplementary Material). The PCR fragments were cut with NcoI and XhoI and ligated into a NcoI/XhoI-linearized pET28a-cbm3 plasmid, resulting in plasmids pSW-cohC and pSW-cohT, respectively. Swapping was performed using overlap-extension PCR. The genes coding for the resultant chimeric cohesins of the four consecutive rounds were prepared using appropriate primers as listed in Table SI (see Supplementary Material). For each chimera, two (and in some cases three) successive PCR reactions were required as described in Table SII (see Supplementary Material). The PCR fragments were cleaved and ligated, as described above, into a linearized pET28a-cbm3 plasmid. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—MBP-DocC and MBP-DocT were expressed and purified according to the pMAL™ Protein Fusion and Purification System: Instruction Manual of New England Biolabs. In this experiment, expression was induced using 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and the TBS column buffer consisted of 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. After elution, the proteins were divided into aliquots and stored at -20 °C. The expression and purification of CBM-cohesin fusion proteins was accomplished as described previously (4Yaron S. Morag E. Bayer E.A. Lamed R. Shoham Y. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Induction was initiated with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The harvested cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4). The fusion proteins, bound to the microcrystalline cellulose, were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 m NaCl and three times with phosphate-buffered saline in the absence of NaCl. Elution and neutralization were done accordingly, and the proteins were stored in 50% (v/v) glycerol at -20 °C. E. coli BL21 pLysS(λDE3) was used as a host for the expression of CBM-cohesin fusion proteins and the MBP-dockerin fusion proteins. ELISA—Nunc-Immuno™ 96 MicroWell™ plates (Nalge Nunc International, Roskilde, Denmark)) were coated by adding 5 μg/ml MBP-DocC and MBP-DocT in 0.1 m Na2CO3 (pH 9) and were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Subsequent steps were carried out at room temperature. Blocking was done by incubating the wells with TBSCB (TBS + 10 mm CaCl2 + 2% bovine serum albumin) for 1 h. CBM-cohesin was then added at different concentrations (1–100 ng) in TBSCB (100 μl/well) and incubated for 1 h. The wells were washed three times with TBSCT (TBS + 10 mm CaCl2 + 0.05% Tween 20). Monoclonal anti-His tag antibody (Serotec) was added (1:1000) in TBSCB (100 μl/well) and incubated for 1 h. The wells were washed again as above, and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) was added (1:5000) in TBSC (100 μl/well). The plates were incubated for 1 h and washed again. Detection was achieved by adding 100 μl/well of commercially prepared TMB reagent (3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). The reaction was terminated by adding 1 m H2SO4 (50 μl/well), and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a tunable VERSAmax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Protein Microarray—Protein microarray was performed according to Ofir et al. 2K. Ofir, Y. Berdichevsky, I. Benhar, R. Azriel-Rosenfeld, R. Lamed, Y. Barak, E. A. Bayer, and E. Morag, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, the CBM-cohesin chimeras were diluted in TBS to a final concentration of 50 and 100 μg/ml, arrayed into a 384 well plate (Genetix, New Milton, Hampshire, UK) and then printed onto a cellulose slide (Zephyr ProteomiX, Kiryat Shmonah, Israel) using a Biorobotics TAS arrayer (Genomic Solutions, Huntingdon, UK) equipped with 16 0.2-mm solid pins. MBP-DocC was labeled with Cy3 mono-reactive dye, and MBP-DocT and polyclonal rabbit anti-CBM were labeled with Cy5 mono-reactive dye (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany) as recommended by the manufacturer. Unconjugated dye was removed using a Slide-A-Lyzer Mini Dialysis Unit (Pierce). The slides were blocked in TBSCB for 1 h at room temperature. The following step was carried out in the dark at room temperature. The slides were incubated with both of the fluorescence-labeled probes, MBP-DocC (2.5 μg/ml) together with MBP-DocT (2.5 μg/ml), or the fluorescence-labeled rabbit α-CBM (1:400) in 4 ml of TBSCB for 1 h. The cells were then washed four times with TBSCT for 5 min. The slides were dried and scanned using a Scanarray 4000 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To determine the residue(s) of the cohesins responsible for biorecognition we combined homologous swapping with an ELISA-based assay. Chimeric cohesins were constructed by progressive generations of swapping, whereby corresponding homologous stretches of the C. thermocellum and C. cellulolyticum cohesins were interchanged and fused to a family-3 CBM from C. thermocellum. The resultant chimeras were tested for specificity of binding by employing an ELISA-based assay using plates coated with dockerins of both rival species fused to the maltose-binding protein (MBP). The corresponding wild-type cohesins were used as reference. First Generation Swapping—Six chimeric proteins were constructed using overlap-extension PCR. The conserved amino acid pairs highlighted in black in Fig. 1 were used as sites to divide the proteins into three. Four of the six chimeras (Sw1-1 to Sw1-4) bind selectively to the C. thermocellum dockerin with little or no cross-reactivity with the C. cellulolyticum dockerin (Fig. 2B). Sw1-5 is the only chimera of the first round that binds preferentially to the C. cellulolyticum dockerin. In contrast, Sw1-6 exhibits very little, if any, reactivity with either of the two dockerins.Fig. 2First generation swapping.A, schematic representation of the six chimeric cohesins resulting from swapping among thirds of the C. thermocellum (t, black) and C. cellulolyticum (c, white) cohesins. B, binding analysis of the first generation chimeras. The six chimeric cohesins were fused to the CBM3 module of C. thermocellum, the resultant fusion chimeras were purified and analyzed on ELISA plates for binding to MBP-fused dockerins of both species. Similarly fused, wild-type cohesins (wt-t and wt-c) were used as references.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The preference in favor of the C. thermocellum system can be explained by the superior affinity characteristics for the cohesin-dockerin interaction of the latter over those of C. cellulolyticum, as observed previously (5Jindou S.

In any case, Sw1-2, which contains both the first and last third of the C. thermocellum cohesin, binds strongest to the corresponding dockerin. In a similar manner, Sw1-5, which contains both the first and last third of the rival C. cellulolyticum cohesin, also binds to the corresponding dockerin. Based on these results, we concluded that critical amino acid residues, located in the first and last third of the molecule, are involved in the interspecies differential recognition properties. The nominal binding properties observed for Sw1-6 might reflect either the above-described preference (in which case the rival specificity segments would counteract each other) or improper folding in or near the binding face of the molecule. Second Generation Swapping—In this round, the first and last third of the cohesin molecule were each split into two parts, and the various combinations were prepared. As shown in Fig. 3A, two chimeric proteins were based on Sw1-1, eight chimeric proteins were based on Sw1-2 and another eight were based on Sw1-5. The amino acid pairs highlighted in gray in Fig. 1 were used to divide the first and last third into two. Chimera Sw2-1 contained only the first sixth of the C. thermocellum cohesin module and Sw2-2 contained only the second sixth of the C. thermocellum cohesin module, while the rest of the molecule was of C. cellulolyticum origin (Fig. 3A, a). Sw2-1 recognized the C. cellulolyticum dockerin alone (Fig. 3B, a), whereas Sw-2-2 exhibited very low affinity to either dockerin with a slight but measurable preference for that of C. thermocellum. These results intimate that some of the important specificity residues are located in the second sixth (as opposed to the first sixth) of the molecule. Sw1-2 was also used as a template to determine the role(s) of smaller portions of the identified specificity regions (Fig. 3A, b). Of the eight chimeric proteins based on this template, only the constructs containing both the second sixth and the last sixth (Sw2-4, Sw2-8, and Sw2-10) showed significant levels of binding to the C. thermocellum dockerin (Fig. 3B, b). The binding affinity of the eight chimeric proteins based on Sw1-5 (Fig. 3A, c) further strengthened the contention that the second and last sixth are involved in the affinity for the C. thermocellum dockerin. Only constructs containing one or both of these sixths (Sw2-12, Sw2-16, and 2-18) exhibit this preference (Fig. 3B, c). Interestingly, Sw2-15 and Sw2-17 contain one of the two sixths, but do not comply with this rule. Again, as described above for chimera Sw1-6, the presence of incompatible segments derived from the rival species may serve to prevent conversion of specificity. Sw2-11, Sw2-13, and Sw2-14 exhibit low levels of binding for the C. cellulolyticum dockerin (Fig. 3B, c). As above, these results can be explained on the basis of the inferior affinity characteristics for the cohesin-dockerin interaction of C. cellulolyticum versus those of C. thermocellum (21Fierobe H.-P.

Despite the relatively modest affinity observed for these chimeras, the findings also support the premise that in C. cellulolyticum, the relevant region resides within the second and last sixth of the protein. Third Generation Swapping—In the previous round, the replacement of complementary short stretches of the C. cellulolyticum cohesin on a background of C. thermocellum failed to generate significant affinity toward the C. cellulolyticum dockerin. On the basis of these results, we restricted our subsequent efforts toward unidirectional conversion of affinity from C. cellulolyticum to C. thermocellum. Toward this end, the second and last sixth of the two cohesins were split in three with overlapping regions as depicted in Fig. 4. Fig. 5A illustrates the combinations of cohesin segments used to uncover the successive trail of specificity between the two species; three chimeric proteins were based on Sw2-2, six others on Sw2-10, and another three were based on Sw2-4.Fig. 5Third generation swapping.A, schematic representation of the twelve chimeric cohesins resulting from swapping the short segments of the C. thermocellum (t, black) and C. cellulolyticum (c, white) cohesins, designated in the legend to Fig. 4. Three chimeric proteins were based on Sw2-2 (a), three chimeric proteins were based on Sw2-4 (c), and another six were based on Sw2-10 (b). B, binding analysis of the third generation chimeras, purified and analyzed for species-specific binding activity as described in the legend to Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) When identifying the part of the second sixth essential for recognition we found that Sw3-5 and Sw3-8 clearly exhibited the highest level of binding to the C. thermocellum dockerin compared with the chimeric proteins derived from the same precursor (Sw2-10). These results indicate that the central segment of the second sixth is involved in the specificity characteristics of the C. thermocellum cohesin (Fig. 5B). Conversely, Sw3-1 and Sw3-7 recognized the C. cellulolyticum dockerin, thus demonstrating that the first segment of the second sixth is not essential for recognition. When locating the part of the last sixth essential for recognition we found that Sw3-8 and Sw3-11 clearly exhibited the strongest binding to the C. thermocellum dockerin compared with their siblings. These results suggest that the central segment of the last sixth is involved in the specificity characteristics of the C. thermocellum cohesin. Based on the results of the third round of swapping, we concluded that selected residues that reside in both of the central segments (designated in Fig. 4) are involved in the specificity characteristics of the C. thermocellum cohesin. Fourth Generation Swapping—At this point in our studies, the structure of the cohesin-dockerin heterodimer from C. thermocellum was brought to our attention, 3H. J. Gilbert, personal communication. and we were able to benefit from the consequent knowledge of the overall complement of contact residues. Prior to this stage, the selection of segments was based solely on the aforementioned criteria and/or as a response to the experimental results. Examination of the crystal structure of the C. thermocellum cohesin-dockerin complex (24Carvalho A.L. Dias F.M. Prates J.A. Nagy T. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Ferreira L.M. Romao M.J. Fontes C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13809-13814Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) revealed only three dockerin-binding contact residues that were located within the central segments of the cohesin chimeras, as designated in the third generation of swapping. These include Ala-36, Asn-37 of the β3 strand and Glu-131 of the loop separating β-strands 8 and 9 (Fig. 4). In addition, a gap occurs relative to the cohesin of C. cellulolyticum (Fig. 4). The gap and the suspected recognition residues were thus swapped either alone or combined in the present round. The designated residues in C. cellulolyticum were modified by site-directed mutagenesis to the corresponding residues in C. thermocellum. As shown in Fig. 6A, four chimeric proteins were based on Sw3-5, one chimeric protein was based on Sw3-6, three chimeric proteins were based on Sw3-11 and another four were chimeric proteins distinguished by alterations in single residues. The four chimeric proteins based on Sw3-5 (Fig. 6A, a) exhibited very low levels of binding relative to that observed for the parent chimera, although a modest preference for C. thermocellum was maintained (Fig. 6B, a). The results of Sw4-5 relative to Sw3-6 indicated that deletion of Met-31 from the C. cellulolyticum cohesin has little or no effect on the specificity (Fig. 6B, b). In the three chimeric proteins based on Sw3-11, the first third of C. thermocellum was maintained to support the muta"
