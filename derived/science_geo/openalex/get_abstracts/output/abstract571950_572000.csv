https://openalex.org/W2534368935,"Observations of the triple protostar system L1448 IRS3B support the hypothesis that companion stars can form because of gravitational instability in a protostellar disk. Multiple stars that orbit each other, a common occurrence across the Universe, result from the early-stage fragmentation of molecular clouds. John Tobin et al. report observations of the triple protostar system L1448 IRS3B, which is in an early phase of the star formation process, making it an ideal candidate for the search for evidence of disk fragmentation. They find dust and molecular gas emissions that indicate a disk with a spiral structure surrounding the three protostars. They demonstrate that this disk is susceptible to fragmentation, supporting the hypothesis that companion stars can form as a result of gravitational instability in a protostellar disk. Binary and multiple star systems are a frequent outcome of the star formation process1,2 and as a result almost half of all stars with masses similar to that of the Sun have at least one companion star3. Theoretical studies indicate that there are two main pathways that can operate concurrently to form binary/multiple star systems: large-scale fragmentation of turbulent gas cores and filaments4,5 or smaller-scale fragmentation of a massive protostellar disk due to gravitational instability6,7. Observational evidence for turbulent fragmentation on scales of more than 1,000 astronomical units has recently emerged8,9. Previous evidence for disk fragmentation was limited to inferences based on the separations of more-evolved pre-main sequence and protostellar multiple systems10,11,12,13. The triple protostar system L1448 IRS3B is an ideal system with which to search for evidence of disk fragmentation as it is in an early phase of the star formation process, it is likely to be less than 150,000 years old14 and all of the protostars in the system are separated by less than 200 astronomical units. Here we report observations of dust and molecular gas emission that reveal a disk with a spiral structure surrounding the three protostars. Two protostars near the centre of the disk are separated by 61 astronomical units and a tertiary protostar is coincident with a spiral arm in the outer disk at a separation of 183 astronomical units13. The inferred mass of the central pair of protostellar objects is approximately one solar mass, while the disk surrounding the three protostars has a total mass of around 0.30 solar masses. The tertiary protostar itself has a minimum mass of about 0.085 solar masses. We demonstrate that the disk around L1448 IRS3B appears susceptible to disk fragmentation at radii between 150 and 320 astronomical units, overlapping with the location of the tertiary protostar. This is consistent with models for a protostellar disk that has recently undergone gravitational instability, spawning one or two companion stars."
https://openalex.org/W2510156102,"Energy dissipation is a fundamental process governing the dynamics of physical, chemical, and biological systems. It is also one of the main characteristics distinguishing quantum and classical phenomena. In condensed matter physics, in particular, scattering mechanisms, loss of quantum information, or breakdown of topological protection are deeply rooted in the intricate details of how and where the dissipation occurs. Despite its vital importance the microscopic behavior of a system is usually not formulated in terms of dissipation because the latter is not a readily measureable quantity on the microscale. Although nanoscale thermometry is gaining much recent interest, the existing thermal imaging methods lack the necessary sensitivity and are unsuitable for low temperature operation required for study of quantum systems. Here we report a superconducting quantum interference nano-thermometer device with sub 50 nm diameter that resides at the apex of a sharp pipette and provides scanning cryogenic thermal sensing with four orders of magnitude improved thermal sensitivity of below 1 {\mu}K/Hz1/2. The non-contact non-invasive thermometry allows thermal imaging of very low nanoscale energy dissipation down to the fundamental Landauer limit of 40 fW for continuous readout of a single qubit at 1 GHz at 4.2 K. These advances enable observation of dissipation due to single electron charging of individual quantum dots in carbon nanotubes and reveal a novel dissipation mechanism due to resonant localized states in hBN encapsulated graphene, opening the door to direct imaging of nanoscale dissipation processes in quantum matter."
https://openalex.org/W2541055764,"Do individuals intuitively favor certain moral actions over others? This study explores the role of intuitive thinking—induced by time pressure and cognitive load—in moral judgment and behavior. We conduct experiments in three different countries (Sweden, Austria, and the United States) involving over 1,400 subjects. All subjects responded to four trolley type dilemmas and four dictator games involving different charitable causes. Decisions were made under time pressure/time delay or while experiencing cognitive load or control. Overall we find converging evidence that intuitive states do not influence moral decisions. Neither time-pressure nor cognitive load had any effect on moral judgments or altruistic behavior. Thus we find no supporting evidence for the claim that intuitive moral judgments and dictator game giving differ from more reflectively taken decisions. Across all samples and decision tasks men were more likely to make utilitarian moral judgments and act selfishly compared to women, providing further evidence that there are robust gender differences in moral decision-making. However, there were no significant interactions between gender and the treatment manipulations of intuitive versus reflective decision-making."

https://openalex.org/W2540759433,"Background This population-based study aimed at investigating the prevalence and associated factors of prehypertension/hypertension in Iran. Methods and Findings The data (n = 2818) for this study were collected in 2015 as a part of the major Lifestyle Promotion Project (LPP) conducted in East Azerbaijan (urban and regional parts). The data for socio-demographic status, dietary information, and physical activity and anxiety levels were collected through validated questionnaires. Then, physical examination including systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), body mass index (BMI) and conicity index was performed. First-morning spot urine (SU) sample was collected to assume salt intake. The One-way ANOVA, logistic regression, chi-square test and independent t-test were used for statistical analysis. The prevalence of prehypertension, stage I and stage II hypertension, and overall hypertension was 47.3%, 13.6%, 5.45% and 22.6% respectively. The mean systolic (p = 0.004) and diastolic (p<0.001) blood pressure in men were significantly higher than women. Results of logistic regression analysis showed that in both sexes, family history of hypertension, obesity, abdominal obesity, anxiety and having high levels of sodium intake were associated with high blood pressure (p< 0.05). Additionally, 45.8% of the hypertensive patients were aware of their disease, 10.0% of the aware patients, and 44.5% of everyone with high blood pressure were receiving antihypertensive medication. Conclusions Our data showed that prehypertension/hypertension is a major health problem in Iran. Focusing on identifying risk factors to hypertension, regular drug intake, good nutrition, physical activity, and changing lifestyles of patients with hypertension are essential."
https://openalex.org/W2540781052,"Abstract Nrf2 is a master transcription factor that regulates a wide variety of cellular proteins by recognizing and binding to antioxidant response elements (AREs) in their gene promoter regions. In this study we show that increasing cellular Nrf2 results in transcriptional activation of the gene for mTOR, which is central to the PI3K signaling pathway. This is the case in cells with normal physiological PI3K. However, in cells with abnormally active PI3K increased cellular Nrf2 levels have no effect on mTOR. ChIP assays results show that increased Nrf2 binding is associated with decreased p65 binding and H3-K27me3 signal (marker of gene repression) as well as increased H3-K4me3 signal (marker of gene activation). However, in cells with PI3K activation, no effect of cellular Nrf2 increase on mTOR transcription was observed. In these cells, increasing Nrf2 levels increases Nrf2 promoter binding marginally, whereas p65 binding and H3-K27me3 mark were significantly increased, and H3-K4me3 signal is reduced. Together, these data show for the first time that Nrf2 directly regulates mTOR transcription when the PI3K pathway is intact, whereas this function is lost when PI3K is activated. We have identified a link between the Nrf2 system of sensing environmental stress and mTOR, which is a key cellular protein in metabolism. Studies in cells with activating mutations in the PI3K pathway suggest that Nrf2 transcriptional regulation of mTOR is related to promoter binding of p65 and of methylation of histone residues permissive of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2540273365,"Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is the major polyphenol in green tea. It has antimicrobial properties and disrupts the ordered structure of amyloid fibrils involved in human disease. The antimicrobial effect of EGCG against the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been shown to involve disruption of quorum sensing (QS). Functional amyloid fibrils in P. aeruginosa (Fap) are able to bind and retain quorum-sensing molecules, suggesting that EGCG interferes with QS through structural remodeling of amyloid fibrils. Here we show that EGCG inhibits the ability of Fap to form fibrils; instead, EGCG stabilizes protein oligomers. Existing fibrils are remodeled by EGCG into non-amyloid aggregates. This fibril remodeling increases the binding of pyocyanin, demonstrating a mechanism by which EGCG can affect the QS function of functional amyloid. EGCG reduced the amyloid-specific fluorescent thioflavin T signal in P. aeruginosa biofilms at concentrations known to exert an antimicrobial effect. Nanoindentation studies showed that EGCG reduced the stiffness of biofilm containing Fap fibrils but not in biofilm with little Fap. In a combination treatment with EGCG and tobramycin, EGCG had a moderate effect on the minimum bactericidal eradication concentration against wild-type P. aeruginosa biofilms, whereas EGCG had a more pronounced effect when Fap was overexpressed. Our results provide a direct molecular explanation for the ability of EGCG to disrupt P. aeruginosa QS and modify its biofilm and strengthens the case for EGCG as a candidate in multidrug treatment of persistent biofilm infections."
https://openalex.org/W2543845100,"Glucocorticoids (GCs) regulate energy supply in response to stress by increasing hepatic gluconeogenesis during fasting. Long-term GC treatment induces hepatic steatosis and weight gain. GC signaling is coordinated via the GC receptor (GR) GRα, as the GRβ isoform lacks a ligand-binding domain. The roles of the GR isoforms in the regulation of lipid accumulation is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine whether GRβ inhibits the actions of GCs in the liver, or enhances hepatic lipid accumulation. We show that GRβ expression is increased in adipose and liver tissues in obese high-fat fed mice. Adenovirus-mediated delivery of hepatic GRβ overexpression (GRβ-Ad) resulted in suppression of gluconeogenic genes and hyperglycemia in mice on a regular diet. Furthermore, GRβ-Ad mice had increased hepatic lipid accumulation and serum triglyceride levels possibly due to the activation of NF-κB signaling and increased tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and inducible nitric-oxide synthase expression, indicative of enhanced M1 macrophages and the development of steatosis. Consequently, GRβ-Ad mice had increased glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) activity and reduced hepatic PPARα and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) expression and lower serum FGF21 levels, which are two proteins known to increase during fasting to enhance the burning of fat by activating the β-oxidation pathway. In conclusion, GRβ antagonizes the GC-induced signaling during fasting via GRα and the PPARα-FGF21 axis that reduces fat burning. Furthermore, hepatic GRβ increases inflammation, which leads to hepatic lipid accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W2540647517,"Background In November 2013, Texas implemented three abortion restrictions included in House Bill 2 (HB 2). Within six months, the number of facilities providing abortion decreased by almost half, and the remaining facilities were concentrated in large urban centers. The number of medication abortions decreased by 70% compared to the same period one year prior due to restrictions on this method imposed by HB 2. The purpose of this study was to explore qualitatively the experiences of women who were most affected by the law: those who had to travel farther to reach a facility and those desiring medication abortion. Methods In August and September 2014, we conducted 20 in-depth interviews with women recruited from ten abortion clinics across Texas. The purposive sample included women who obtained or strongly preferred medication abortion or traveled ≥50 miles one way to the clinic. The interview guide focused on women’s experiences with obtaining services following implementation of HB 2, and a thematic analysis was performed. Results Women faced informational, cost and logistical barriers seeking abortion services, and these obstacles were often compounded by poverty. Two women found the process of finding or getting to a clinic so onerous that they considered not having the procedure, although they ultimately had an abortion; another woman decided to continue her pregnancy, in part because of challenges in getting to the clinic. For two women, arranging travel required disclosure to more people than desired. Women who strongly preferred medication abortion were frustrated by the difficulty or inability to obtain their desired method, especially among those who were near or just beyond the gestational age limit. The restricted eligibility criteria for medication abortion and difficulty finding clinics offering the method created substantial access barriers. Conclusions Medication abortion restrictions and clinic closures following HB 2 created substantial barriers for women seeking abortion in Texas."
https://openalex.org/W2543209401,"ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), which promotes cholesterol efflux from cells and inhibits inflammatory responses, is highly expressed in the kidney. Research has shown that exendin-4, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist, promotes ABCA1 expression in multiple tissues and organs; however, the mechanisms underlying exendin-4 induction of ABCA1 expression in glomerular endothelial cells are not fully understood. In this study we investigated the effect of exendin-4 on ABCA1 in glomerular endothelial cells of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and the possible mechanism. We observed a marked increase in glomerular lipid deposits in tissues of patients with DKD and diabetic apolipoprotein E knock-out (apoE−/−) mice by Oil Red O staining and biochemical analysis of cholesterol. We found significantly decreased ABCA1 expression in glomerular endothelial cells of diabetic apoE−/− mice and increased renal lipid, cholesterol, and inflammatory cytokine levels. Exendin-4 decreased renal cholesterol accumulation and inflammation and increased cholesterol efflux by up-regulating ABCA1. In human glomerular endothelial cells, GLP-1R-mediated signaling pathways (e.g. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, cAMP/PKA, PI3K/AKT, and ERK1/2) were involved in cholesterol efflux and inflammatory responses by regulating ABCA1 expression. We propose that exendin-4 increases ABCA1 expression in glomerular endothelial cells, which plays an important role in alleviating renal lipid accumulation, inflammation, and proteinuria in mice with type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2544041365,"Although vocal production in non-human primates is highly constrained, individuals appear to have some control over whether to call or remain silent. We investigated how contextual factors affect the production of grunts given by wild female chacma baboons, Papio ursinus, during social interactions. Females grunted as they approached other adult females 28% of the time. Supporting previous research, females were much more likely to grunt to mothers with young infants than to females without infants. Grunts also significantly increased the likelihood of affiliative interactions among all partners. Notably, however, grunts did not simply mirror existing social bonds. Instead, they appeared to perform a very different function: namely, to serve as signals of benign intent between partners whose relationship is not necessarily close or predictable. Females were less likely to grunt to their mothers or adult daughters—the individuals with whom they shared the closest and least aggressive bonds—than to other females. In contrast, patterns of grunting between sisters were similar to those between nonkin, perhaps reflecting sisters’ more ambivalent relationships. Females grunted at higher rates to lower-ranking, than to higher-ranking, females, supporting the hypothesis that grunts do not simply signal the signaler’s level of arousal or anxiety about receiving aggression, but instead function as signals of benign intent. Taken together, results suggest that the grunts given by female baboons serve to reduce uncertainty about the likely outcome of an interaction between partners whose relationship is not predictably affiliative. Despite their limited vocal repertoire, baboons appear to be skilled at modifying call production in different social contexts and for different audiences."
https://openalex.org/W2543646240,"Autotaxin (ATX) is a key enzyme that converts lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) into lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a lysophospholipid mediator that regulates cellular activities through its specific G protein-coupled receptors. The ATX-LPA axis plays an important role in various physiological and pathological processes, especially in inflammation and cancer development. Although the transcriptional regulation of ATX has been widely studied, the post-transcriptional regulation of ATX is largely unknown. In this study, we identified conserved adenylate-uridylate (AU)-rich elements in the ATX mRNA 3′-untranslated region (3′UTR). The RNA-binding proteins HuR and AUF1 directly bound to the ATX mRNA 3′UTR and had antagonistic functions in ATX expression. HuR enhanced ATX expression by increasing ATX mRNA stability, whereas AUF1 suppressed ATX expression by promoting ATX mRNA decay. HuR and AUF1 were involved in ATX regulation in Colo320 human colon cancer cells and the LPS-stimulated human monocytic THP-1 cells. HuR knockdown suppressed ATX expression in B16 mouse melanoma cells, leading to inhibition of cell migration. This effect was reversed by AUF1 knockdown to recover ATX expression or by the addition of LPA. These results suggest that the post-transcriptional regulation of ATX expression by HuR and AUF1 modulates cancer cell migration. In summary, we identified HuR and AUF1 as novel post-transcriptional regulators of ATX expression, thereby elucidating a novel mechanism regulating the ATX-LPA axis."
https://openalex.org/W2542000107,"Southern Africa's grassland biodiversity is threatened by habitat transformation such as commercial forestry. Ecological networks (ENs) have been instigated to alleviate the pressure of habitat transformation on local biodiversity. ENs are large scale webs of corridors and patches of natural vegetation criss-crossing production landscapes that can simulate conditions in protected areas (PAs). Many ENs have lost many native large mammal species, which have been replaced by domestic livestock to retain natural grazing dynamics, which could have an impact on the long-term value of ENs for insects. Here we compared dung beetle, butterfly and grasshopper diversity in ENs across a landscape mosaic of timber plantations, where 1) wild megaherbivores were maintained, 2) in ENs where these herbivores were replaced by livestock and, 3) in a nearby World Heritage PA which retained its natural complement of megaherbivores. Sites in the PA far from any plantation were similar in composition to those in the wild grazed EN. Presence of the wild grazers improved the alpha- and beta-diversity of all focal insect taxa when compared to domestic grazing. Furthermore, species composition shows significant differences between the two grazing systems indicating that an assemblage of native large mammals facilitates insect diversity conservation. We support the maintenance or introduction of large native mammals in ENs or similar conservation areas in production landscapes to simulate the ecological conditions and natural heterogeneity in nearby PAs."
https://openalex.org/W2539580035,"Humans and non-human primates are extremely sensitive to snakes as exemplified by their ability to detect pictures of snakes more quickly than those of other animals. These findings are consistent with the Snake Detection Theory, which hypothesizes that as predators, snakes were a major source of evolutionary selection that favored expansion of the visual system of primates for rapid snake detection. Many snakes use camouflage to conceal themselves from both prey and their own predators, making it very challenging to detect them. If snakes have acted as a selective pressure on primate visual systems, they should be more easily detected than other animals under difficult visual conditions. Here we tested whether humans discerned images of snakes more accurately than those of non-threatening animals (e.g., birds, cats, or fish) under conditions of less perceptual information by presenting a series of degraded images with the Random Image Structure Evolution technique (interpolation of random noise). We find that participants recognize mosaic images of snakes, which were regarded as functionally equivalent to camouflage, more accurately than those of other animals under dissolved conditions. The present study supports the Snake Detection Theory by showing that humans have a visual system that accurately recognizes snakes under less discernible visual conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2544597300,"Sialic acid bound to glycans in glycolipids and glycoproteins is essential for synaptic plasticity and memory. Sialidase (EC 3.2.1.18), which has 4 isozymes including Neu1, Neu2, Neu3 and Neu4, regulates the sialylation level of glycans by removing sialic acid from sialylglycoconjugate. In the present study, we investigated the distribution of sialidase activity in rat hippocampus and the role of sialidase in hippocampal memory processing. We previously developed a highly sensitive histochemical imaging probe for sialidase activity, BTP3-Neu5Ac. BTP3-Neu5Ac was cleaved efficiently by rat Neu2 and Neu4 at pH 7.3 and by Neu1 and Neu3 at pH 4.6. When a rat hippocampal acute slice was stained with BTP3-Neu5Ac at pH 7.3, mossy fiber terminal fields showed relatively intense sialidase activity. Thus, the role of sialidase in the synaptic plasticity was investigated at mossy fiber terminal fields. The long-term potentiation (LTP) at mossy fiber-CA3 pyramidal cell synapses was impaired by 2,3-dehydro-2-deoxy-N-acetylneuraminic acid (DANA), a sialidase inhibitor. DANA also failed to decrease paired-pulse facilitation after LTP induction. We also investigated the role of sialidase in hippocampus-dependent spatial memory by using the Morris water maze. The escape latency time to reach the platform was prolonged by DANA injection into the hippocampal CA3 region or by knockdown of Neu4 without affecting motility. The results show that the regulation of sialyl signaling by Neu4 is involved in hippocampal memory processing."
https://openalex.org/W2545130784,"The structure of dietary triacylglycerols is thought to influence fatty acid and calcium absorption, as well as intestinal microbiota population of the host. In the present study, we investigated the impact of palmitic acid (PA) esterified at the sn-2 position on absorption of fatty acid and calcium and composition of intestinal microorganisms in rats fed high-fat diets containing either low sn-2 PA (12.1%), medium sn-2 PA (40.4%) or high sn-2 PA (56.3%), respectively. Fecal fatty acid profiles in the soaps were measured by gas chromatography (GC), while fecal calcium concentration was detected by ICP-MS. The fecal microbial composition was assessed using a 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing technology and fecal short-chain fatty acids were detected by ion chromatograph. Dietary supplementation with a high sn-2 PA fat significantly reduced total fecal contents of fatty acids soap and calcium compared with the medium or low sn-2 PA fat groups. Diet supplementation with sn-2 PA fat did not change the entire profile of the gut microbiota community at phylum level and the difference at genera level also were minimal in the three treatment groups. However, high sn-2 PA fat diet could potentially improve total short-chain fatty acids content in the feces, suggesting that high dietary sn-2 PA fat might have a beneficial effect on host intestinal health."
https://openalex.org/W2558827889,"Hyperactive Wnt/β-catenin signaling is linked to cancer progression and developmental abnormalities, making identification of mechanisms controlling Wnt/β-catenin signaling vital. Transforming growth factor β type III receptor (TβRIII/betaglycan) is a transmembrane proteoglycan co-receptor that exists with or without heparan and/or chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan (GAG) modifications in cells and has established roles in development and cancer. Our studies here demonstrate that TβRIII, independent of its TGFβ co-receptor function, regulates canonical Wnt3a signaling by controlling Wnt3a availability through its sulfated GAG chains. Our findings revealed, for the first time, opposing functions for the different GAG modifications on TβRIII suggesting that Wnt interactions with the TβRIII heparan sulfate chains result in inhibition of Wnt signaling, likely via Wnt sequestration, whereas the chondroitin sulfate GAG chains on TβRIII promote Wnt3a signaling. These studies identify a novel, dual role for TβRIII/betaglycan and define a key requirement for the balance between chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate chains in dictating ligand responses with implications for both development and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2545846206,"Oxidative stress may play an important role in the pathogenesis of keratoconus (KC). Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is involved in mitochondrial function, and the mtDNA content, integrity, and transcript level may affect the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and be involved in the pathogenesis of KC. We designed a case-control study to research the relationship between KC and mtDNA integrity, content and transcription. One-hundred ninety-eight KC corneas and 106 normal corneas from Chinese patients were studied. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure the relative mtDNA content, transcript levels of mtDNA and related genes. Long-extension PCR was used to detect mtDNA damage. ROS, mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP were measured by respective assay kit, and Mito-Tracker Green was used to label the mitochondria. The relative mtDNA content of KC corneas was significantly lower than that of normal corneas (P = 9.19×10−24), possibly due to decreased expression of the mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) gene (P = 3.26×10−3). In contrast, the transcript levels of mtDNA genes were significantly increased in KC corneas compared with normal corneas (NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 [ND1]: P = 1.79×10−3; cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 [COX1]: P = 1.54×10−3; NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1, [ND6]: P = 4.62×10−3). The latter may be the result of increased expression levels of mtDNA transcription-related genes mitochondrial RNA polymerase (POLRMT) (P = 2.55×10−4) and transcription factor B2 mitochondrial (TFB2M) (P = 7.88×10−5). KC corneas also had increased mtDNA damage (P = 3.63×10−10), higher ROS levels, and lower mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP levels compared with normal corneas. Decreased integrity, content and increased transcript level of mtDNA are associated with KC. These changes may affect the generation of ROS and play a role in the pathogenesis of KC."

Serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2 (SRSF2 or SC35), which is a specific well known serine/arginine-rich (SR) protein family member, is well known as a mediator of genome stability, pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA nuclear export, and translational control (11.Xiao R.

SRSF2 contains an RNA recognition motif for RNA binding and a domain rich in arginine and serine residues (RS domain) that facilitates its interaction with other SR splicing factors (13.Cartegni L.

To date several studies have investigated the roles of SRSF2 in viral infection. In HIV-1 infection, SRSF2 was reported to modulate viral replication by negatively regulating the levels of genomic RNA and HIV-1 structural proteins (16.Jacquenet S. Decimo D. Muriaux D. Darlix J.L. Dual effect of the SR proteins ASF/SF2, SC35 and 9G8 on HIV-1 RNA splicing and virion production.Retrovirology. 2005; 2: 33Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Additionally, SRSF2 regulates the splicing of the viral factors Tat (17.Erkelenz S. Hillebrand F. Widera M. Theiss S. Fayyaz A. Degrandi D. Pfeffer K. Schaal H.

In human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16), SRSF2 positively regulated the expression and stability of E6E7 RNAs (22.McFarlane M. MacDonald A.I. Stevenson A. Graham S.V. Human papillomavirus 16 oncoprotein expression is controlled by the cellular splicing factor SRSF2 (SC35).J. Virol. 2015; 89: 5276-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this report we reveal that the host splicing factor SRSF2 facilitates HSV-1 replication by regulating HSV-1 ICP0, infected cell polypeptide 27 (ICP27), and thymidine kinase (TK) expression. At the transcriptional level, SRSF2 functions as a transcriptional activator by directly binding to the HSV-1 ICP0, ICP27, and TK promoters. At the post-transcriptional level, SRSF2 participates in ICP0 pre-mRNA splicing by co-localizing with ICP0 exon 3. These findings provide insight into the functions of SRSF2 in HSV-1 replication and gene expression and broaden our views concerning the mechanisms through which gene expression is regulated. HSV-1 infection has been reported to alter the localization of the SR domain splicing factor SRSF2, resulting in the inhibition of host cell pre-mRNA splicing (23.Sandri-Goldin R.M. Hibbard M.K. Hardwicke M.A. The C-terminal repressor region of herpes simplex virus type 1 ICP27 is required for the redistribution of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles and splicing factor SC35; however, these alterations are not sufficient to inhibit host cell splicing.J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6063-6076Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the effects of SRSF2 on the HSV-1 infection process have not been elucidated. To investigate the role of SRSF2 in HSV-1 replication, we first knocked down SRSF2 using SRSF2 siRNA and overexpressed SRSF2 with a pCMV-SRSF2-FLAG construct (Fig. 1, A and B). Then, we examined HSV-1 glycoprotein expression in HeLa cells using fluorescence microscopy. The HSV-1 glycoprotein density and intensity in the SRSF2 knockdown HeLa cells was much lower than that in the cells transfected with negative control siRNA (Fig. 1C). In contrast, increased SRSF2 expression resulted in a much higher density and intensity of the HSV-1 glycoproteins (Fig. 1D), suggesting that SRSF2 affected both HSV-1 replication and spread. Next, cells with down-regulated or up-regulated SRSF2 expression were infected with HSV-1 at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 1 for 12, 24, or 36 h. The viral supernatants were collected, and the viral titers were determined using plaque assays. The HSV-1 titers in the culture media from SRSF2-knocked down HeLa cells were markedly lower than the titers in HeLa cells transfected with the negative control siRNA (Fig. 1E). The opposite results were observed in the SRSF2-overexpressing cells (Fig. 1F). To investigate the effect of silencing and overexpression of SC5 on cell cytotoxicity in vitro, a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assay was performed in HeLa cells transfected with SRSF2 siRNA or SRSF2-FLAG. The results revealed no difference between the SRSF2 siRNA (Fig. 1G) or SRSF2-FLAG plasmid (Fig. 1H) and control groups 24, 36, and 48 h after the transfections, indicating no significant effect on cell viability or proliferative capacity. In HSV-1-infected host cells, the IE genes are first activated, promoting the expression of viral proteins to facilitate viral replication. To study the mechanism by which SRSF2 modulates HSV-1 replication, we measured the expression levels of genes required for the appropriate expression of viral early and late gene products, such as HSV-1 ICP0, ICP27, and TK, in HeLa cells transfected with the SRSF2 siRNA. In HSV-1-infected HeLa cells, SRSF2 depletion led to the inhibition of ICP0, ICP27, and TK expression at the mRNA (Fig. 2A) and protein levels (Fig. 2B). Conversely, up-regulation of SRSF2 by SRSF2-FLAG plasmid transfection enhanced ICP0, ICP27, and TK expression at the mRNA (Fig. 2C) and protein levels (Fig. 2D). Also, we measured the expression level of host cellular nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1), an unrelated non-coding gene, in HeLa cells transfected with the SRSF2 siRNA or SRSF2-FLAG plasmid. The qPCR results showed that SRSF2 had no significant effect on NEAT1 expression (Fig. 2, A and C). Although SRSF2 is well known as a nuclear speckle component that participates in the process of cellular RNA maturation by binding to RNA, recent reports have indicated that it seems to function as a chromatin regulator (24.Ji X. Zhou Y. Pandit S. Huang J. Li H. Lin C.Y. Xiao R. Burge C.B. Fu X.D. SR proteins collaborate with 7SK and promoter-associated nascent rna to release paused polymerase.Cell. 2013; 153: 855-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Therefore, we performed a luciferase assay to examine whether SRSF2 directly regulated viral gene transcription. We generated two luciferase reporter constructs by inserting the promoter fragments of ICP0 and ICP27 into pGL3-enhancer vectors. To study the effects of SRSF2 on the transcriptional activity of the HSV-1 TK promoter, we directly utilized a pRL-TK reporter vector because this vector contained the same HSV-1 TK gene promoter sequence. The results showed inhibited transcriptional activity of the ICP0, ICP27, and TK promoters in the SRSF2-depleted HeLa cells (Fig. 3A) and increased transcriptional activity in the SRSF2-overexpressing HeLa cells (Fig. 3B). Additionally, we measured the transcription of NEAT1 in HeLa cells transfected with the SRSF2 siRNA or SRSF2-FLAG plasmid as a negative control. To identify the SRSF2 binding sites in the ICP0, ICP27, and TK promoters, we designed sets of primer pairs that recognized the upstream and downstream transcriptional start sites (TSSs) of these genes (Table 1) and performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay with anti-SRSF2 antibody or anti-IgG antibody in HSV-1-infected HeLa cells. The NEAT1 promoter was used as a negative control. The results showed that SRSF2 was enriched near the TSSs of ICP0 gene, ICP27 gene, and TK gene (Fig. 3C). Next, we used DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunofluorescence microscopy experiments to validate the interaction between SRSF2 and the HSV-1 ICP0, ICP27, and TK promoters. First, we prepared probes by amplifying the P4 region of ICP0, the P2 region of ICP27, and the P3 region of TK; the probes were labeled with biotinylated cytidine bisphosphate at the 3′ end of the DNA. The results confirmed that SRSF2 was associated with the promoters of these genes (Fig. 3D). Additionally, pixel intensity plots were generated for each merged channel (Fig. 3D, right panels). To determine the specificity of this co-localization, we performed DNA-FISH and immunofluorescence microscopy experiments in mock-infected HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 3D, bottom panels, the probe recognizing the ICP0 promoter fragment detected no signal in mock-infected nuclei.TABLE 1Sequences of primers used in the ChIP assayNameForward primerReverse primerPrimer positionsICP0-P1TAGGGTCAGGGGGTTCCGGGGGACCCCCACTCATACA169/294ICP0-P2GTTCCAGTGTAAGGGTCGGGATACGACCCCCATGGAGCC−13/148ICP0-P3CCGACAGTCTGGTCGCATTTGGCTCCATGGGGGTCGTAT−158/7ICP0-P4CCATTGGGGGAATCGTCACCTTCTGTGGTGATGCGGAG−227/−65ICP0-P5GGGCATGCTAATGGGGTTCTGCAGTGACGATTCCCCCAAT−380/−206ICP0-P6CAATGAACCCGCATTGGTCCAGAACCCCATTAGCATGCCC−493/−361ICP0-P7CTTAATGGGCAACCCCGGTACGCCTTCCCGAAGAAACTCA−621/−432ICP0-P8CTTGTTCCGCTTCCCGGTATGAATACCGGGGTTGCCCATT−707/−599TK-P1GGGCGATTGGTCGTAATCCACCCAACGGCGACCTGTATAA196/297TK-P2CCGGTATTGTCTCCTTCCGTCTGCCGGGACGCCCT42/191TK-P3AAACGCGGGCGTATTGGTACAATACCGGAAGGAACCCG−107/50TK-P4GCAGGTAGGTCTTCGGGATGGGCATCTCTGCCCCTTCTTC−568/−453TK-P5AAAAGCCTAGCAGGTCGGAGCCTCTCTTCTGGCGCCTAAC−1459/−1354TK-P6AGAAACTCGGCATACAGGGCGAGATTCTGGAGCGCGAACA−1739/−1600TK-P7AAGTGGTCCGGAAGCCAAAAGAGCCTTCTGATAGCCTCGG−1982/−1860ICP27-P1CCCACAGTGTGTGGTCGCTCCGACAAACCATCGGCAG301/481ICP27-P2GACGAGGACATGGAAGACCCCTGGTTGAGGATCGTTGGGG138/297ICP27-P3CCAGAGGCCATATCCGACACCTGTCCGATTCCAGGTCGTC−51/115ICP27-P4CGTCCCGTTACCAAGACCAACGGCACAGACAAGGACCAAT−376/−240ICP27-P5CCATCATCCTCTCGGGCATCGCCCCAAGACAGGACAGTTT−654/−473ICP27-P6TCACCTTCTTGTACCACCGCAACACCAGGTGGTGATGGTC−942/−784ICP27-P7GCCGATGTATGTTTGGCGTCGCAGGCGGGTAATTTTCGTG−1131/−1000ICP27-P8TCCGCTGCACCGATGTATTTCCCGCGATAAGATTGGCGTA−1460/−1290NEAT1TGTCCCTCGGCTATGTCAGAGAGGGGACGTGTTTCCTGAG−920/−769 Open table in a new tab In addition, we tested the co-localization of SRSF2 with Ser-5(P)-RNAP II, ICP27, and infected cell protein 8 (ICP8) using the immunofluorescence assay and pixel intensity analysis (Fig. 4A). Of these proteins, RNAP II widely exists at gene promoters and catalyzes DNA transcription and RNA synthesis, and ICP27 has been shown to recruit RNAP II to viral transcription sites to initiate their transcription (25.Dai-Ju J.Q. Li L. Johnson L.A. Sandri-Goldin R.M. ICP27 Interacts with the C terminal domain of RNA polymerase II and facilitates its recruitment to herpes simplex Virus 1 transcription sites, where it undergoes proteasomal degradation during infection.J. Virol. 2006; 80: 3567-3581Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar); ICP8 was the first protein to be identified in HSV-1 replication compartments, which function as sites of viral DNA replication and late gene transcription (26.Quinlan M.P. Chen L.B. Knipe D.M. The intranuclear location of a herpes simplex virus DNA-binding protein is determined by the status of viral DNA replication.Cell. 1984; 36: 857-868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). We also conducted an immunoprecipitation assay to confirm this association. SRSF2 siRNA- or negative-control-transfected cells were infected with HSV-1 at an m.o.i. of 1 for 4 h. Cells lysates were harvested and subjected to the immunoprecipitation assay with the SRSF2 antibody followed by Western blotting using antibodies against RNAP II, ICP27, ICP8, and SRSF2. RNAP II, ICP27, and ICP8 were specifically pulled down in the negative-control-transfected cell lysates. SRSF2 depletion resulted in a significant reduction in the interaction of SRSF2 with RNAP II, ICP27, and ICP8 (Fig. 4B). To remove the influence of the RNA or DNA in these associations, the cell lysate was preincubated with RNase A and DNase I and then subjected to the immunoprecipitation assay with the SRSF2 antibody. The result demonstrated that DNase and RNase treatment significantly reduced the association of SRSF2 with RNAP II without alteration in the association of SRSF2 with ICP8 and ICP27 (Fig. 4C), as suggested earlier (24.Ji X. Zhou Y. Pandit S. Huang J. Li H. Lin C.Y. Xiao R. Burge C.B. Fu X.D. SR proteins collaborate with 7SK and promoter-associated nascent rna to release paused polymerase.Cell. 2013; 153: 855-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Together, these results suggested that SRSF2 activation enhanced the transcriptional activity of the ICP0, ICP27, and TK promoters through the co-localization of SRSF2 with viral gene promoters, RNAP II, ICP27, and ICP8. As a nuclear pre-mRNA splicing factor, SRSF2 completes exon inclusion and exclusion via binding to exon splicing enhancers located within pre-mRNA exons (12.Lin S. Fu X.D. SR proteins and related factors in alternative splicing.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2007; 623: 107-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In HSV-1, all viral gene transcripts are intronless with the exception of ICP0. Therefore, we analyzed the ICP0 pre-mRNA sequence to search for SRSF2 binding motifs and identified a general consensus SRSF2-binding motif (27.Burge C.B. Tuschl T. Sharp P.A. Splicing of Precursors to mRNAs by the Spliceosomes.in: Gesteland R.F. Cech T.R. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 525-560Google Scholar) located in exon 3 between 4735 bp and 4742 bp (Fig. 5A). To test whether SRSF2 binds to this site, we performed an RNA immunoprecipitation assay. SRSF2 siRNA- or negative-control-transfected cells were infected with HSV-1 at an m.o.i. of 1 for 4 h. The cell lysates were harvested and subjected to an immunoprecipitation assay with the SRSF2 antibody or IgG antibody followed by qRT-PCR using primers that recognized the ICP0 exon 1, exon 2, and exon 3 regions, including the potential SRSF2-binding site (Fig. 5A). An unrelated RNA (NEAT1) was used as a negative control. To avoid DNA contamination in the qRT-PCR, we eliminated the remaining genomic DNA and then reverse-transcribed cDNA with the kit. The results demonstrated that SRSF2 had the ability to pull down fragments of ICP0 pre-mRNA exon 1, exon 2, and exon 3, whereas SRSF2 knockdown markedly decreased the amount of these fragments retrieved by SRSF2 (Fig. 5B). Next, we prepared probes via transcribing ICP0 exon 3 containing the SRSF2 binding motif (WT) and ICP0 exon 3 with a deletion in the SRSF2 binding motif (Mut). The probes were labeled with digoxigenin (DIG) at the 3′ end of the RNA in vitro and used to perform RNA FISH and immunofluorescence assay experiments. As shown in Fig. 5C, SRSF2 largely colocalized with ICP0 exon 3 containing the SRSF2 binding motif. The intensity plot showed yellow fluorescence, indicating colocalization of SRSF2 and ICP0 exon 3 containing the SRSF2 binding motif (Fig. 5C, upper panels). Conversely, the ICP0 exon 3 with a deletion in the SRSF2 binding motif did not colocalize with SRSF2. The intensity plot showed red and green fluorescence, indicating no colocalization between SRSF2 and ICP0 exon 3 due to the deletion of the SRSF2-binding motif (Fig. 5C, lower panels). These data are the first to show that SRSF2 recognizes and colocalizes with HSV-1 transcripts. Finally, we tested whether the colocalization between SRSF2 and ICP0 exon 3 influenced ICP0 pre-mRNA splicing. Because SRSF2 regulates the transcriptional activity of the ICP0 promoter, the expression difference between the ICP0 intron and the exons regulated by SRSF2 cannot be used as a standard for its effects on ICP0 pre-mRNA splicing. Therefore, we utilized the ratio of the ICP0 mRNA expression level to the pre-mRNA expression level to characterize its splicing ability. As shown in Fig. 5D, the expression ratio of the ICP0 mRNA was 4-fold higher than that of the ICP0 pre-mRNA in HeLa cells transfected with the negative control. However, the ratio declined significantly when SRSF2 expression was decreased with the siRNA. Conversely, overexpression of SRSF2 increased the ratio (Fig. 5E). Taken together, these results prove that SRSF2 regulates ICP0 pre-mRNA splicing by recognizing ICP0 exon 3. SRSF2 is a well known SR protein that is involved in genome stability, alternative splicing, and mRNA export and translation control. In our present study we found that SRSF2 promoted HSV-1 replication by regulating viral gene expression at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. At the transcriptional level, SRSF2 was recruited to the promoters of ICP0, ICP27, and TK with RNAP II, ICP27, and ICP8 to initialize the transcription of these genes. At the post-transcriptional level, SRSF2 recognized the SRSF2 binding sites located in ICP0 pre-mRNA exon 3 to modulate its splicing. As an immediate early protein, ICP0 is synthesized and transported to the nucleus after the earliest stage of HSV-1 infection and plays vital roles in the promotion of viral gene expression (28.Everett R.D. ICP0, a regulator of herpes simplex virus during lytic and latent infection.Bioessays. 2000; 22: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), the distribution of host cellular nuclear bodies (29.Lee H.R.

Recently, Workenhe et al. (33.Workenhe S.T. Ketela T. Moffat J. Cuddington B.P. Mossman K.L. Genome wide lentiviral shRNA screen identifies serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2 as a determinant of oncolytic virus activity in breast cancer cells.Oncogene. 2016; 35: 2465-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) revealed that SRSF2 did not influence ICP0-null HSV-1 replication, suggesting that ICP0 plays key roles in SRSF2-mediated HSV-1 replication. In this study, SRSF2 was revealed to function as a transcriptional activator and splicing factor in ICP0 expression. As a multifunctional viral protein, the SRSF2-mediated induction of ICP0 expression may greatly influence the HSV-1 life cycle. In our work we demonstrated that SRSF2 could co-localize with the promoters of ICP0, ICP27, and TK to alter their transcriptional activity. First, SRSF2 positively regulated ICP0, ICP27, and TK expression; this regulation was associated with altered transcription. SRSF2 was originally recognized as a pre-mRNA-binding protein. However, Ji X et al. (24.Ji X. Zhou Y. Pandit S. Huang J. Li H. Lin C.Y. Xiao R. Burge C.B. Fu X.D. SR proteins collaborate with 7SK and promoter-associated nascent rna to release paused polymerase.Cell. 2013; 153: 855-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) demonstrated that SRSF2 appeared to associate with gene promoters instead of the RNA. Therefore, we hypothesized that SRSF2 might regulate the transcription of viral genes via interacting with their promoters. Based on the ChIP assay results, we concluded that SRSF2 binding sites were located in the TSSs of the ICP0, ICP27, and TK promoters. These results demonstrate for the first time that speckles component SRSF2 co-localizes with HSV-1 DNA, suggesting that the HSV-1 genome is recruited to the nuclear sub-structural speckles to regulate its replication and gene expression. Because HSV-1 genes are transcribed by RNAP II, we tested the relationship between SRSF2 and RNAP II. The immunofluorescence assay and immunoprecipitation assay results confirmed that SRSF2 physically interacts with RNAP II. Additionally, SRSF2 was shown to associate with ICP8, an HSV-1 single-stranded DNA-binding protein that functions as an activator of viral DNA replication and late gene transcription (34.Aslani A. Olsson M. Elias P. ATP-dependent unwinding of a minimal origin of DNA replication by the origin binding protein and the single strand DNA-binding protein ICP8 from herpes simplex virus type1.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41204-41212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These results revealed the potential ability of SRSF2 to regulate gene expression by affecting viral gene transcription in addition to its traditional roles in pre-mRNA splicing. Generally, SRSF2 participates in cellular pre-mRNA and alternative splicing by binding to its exon splicing enhancers (12.Lin S. Fu X.D. SR proteins and related factors in alternative splicing.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2007; 623: 107-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). To screen the ICP0 pre-mRNA sequence, we identified general consensus SRSF2 binding motifs located in exon 3. The RNA immunoprecipitation assay and immunofluorescence assay results confirmed that SRSF2 colocalized with ICP0 pre-mRNA exon 3. To better show its effect on pre-mRNA splicing, we utilized the ratio of the ICP0 mRNA expression level to the pre-mRNA expression level to characterize its splicing ability. As a traditional RNA-binding protein, SRSF2 bound to the HSV-1 ICP0, ICP27, and TK promoters to initiate their transcription in association with RNAP II and ICP27. Moreover, SRSF2 participated in ICP0 pre-mRNA splicing by recognizing SRSF2 binding motifs located in ICP0 exon 3. Taken together, our study provides useful insight into the functions of SRSF2 in viral infection. HeLa cells (epithelial, human cervix carcinoma cell line; ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Gibco/Invitrogen, 12800-017) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (PAA, A15-101) and 10 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco/Invitrogen, 15140-122) in a 5% CO2-humidified incubator at 37 °C. The HeLa cells were infected with the HSV-1 virus SM44 strain at a m.o.i. of 1 pfu per cell. For the plaque assay, Vero cells (Chinese Academy of Sciences) were inoculated with 100 μl of a series of diluted viral supernatants for 1 h. After virus adsorption, the HSV-1-infected cells were overlaid with medium containing 1% human serum for 48 h and stained with 1% crystal violet in 10% formaldehyde for 15 min to visualize the plaques. Recombinant vectors encoding humanSRSF2 (NM_003016.4) were constructed by PCR-based amplification from the cDNA of human HeLa cells. Then the amplicons were subcloned into the HindIII/XhoI sites of pCMV-N-FLAG (Beyotime, D2722). To generate luciferase reporters for the promoter assay, we cloned the ICP0, ICP27, and NEAT1 promoters into the KpnI/XhoI sites of the pGL3-enhancer reporter. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The primers for plasmid construction were as follows: SRSF2-FLAG, 5′-CCCAAGCTTATGGCCCAATGGAATCAGCTA-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCGCTCGAGCATGGGGGAGGTAGCGCA-3′ (antisense); ICP0 promoter, 5′-CGGGGTACCTCTAACGTTACACCCGAGGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTTCTGTGGTGATGCGGAGAG-3′ (antisense);ICP27 promoter, 5′-CGGGGTACCCCATCATCCTCTCGGGCATC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCGCTCGAGGTCTTCTGGACGAGACGGG-3′ (antisense); NEAT1 promoter, 5′-CGGGGTACCGGGCCCAGAAACAGCACTAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCGCTCGAGAGGACTTTGGACCGTGTAGC-3′ (antisense). All the synthetic siRNAs and the negative control (CTRL) were purchased from Shanghai GenePharma Co., Ltd.

All the siRNAs were transfected using LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen, 11668-019) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For plasmids, the cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine&TM 3000 (Invitrogen, 1656200). Total RNA was isolated using RNA iso Plus (Takara, D9108B) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Real-time qRT-PCR was performed using the ReverTra Ace® qPCR RT Master Mix with genomic DNA remover (TOYOBO, FSQ-301) and the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (TOYOBO, QPK-201). All mRNA levels were measured and normalized to β-actin mRNA.

Cells were lysed in ice-cold whole cell extract buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 4 m urea, and 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with a complete protease inhibitor mixture. The cell extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. The protein bands were visualized using the ECL blotting detection reagents. The antibodies used for Western blotting included an anti-SRSF2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-10252), an anti-HSV-1 ICP0 antibody (Abcam, ab6513), an anti-HSV-1 ICP27 antibody (Abcam, ab31631), an anti-HSV-1 TK antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-28037), an anti-RNAP II antibody (Abcam, ab5131), and an anti-β-actin antibody (Proteintech, 60008-1-Ig). To determine the cell viability and proliferative capacity, transfected HeLa cells were plated into 96-well plates at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well. After growth for 24, 36, and 48 h, 10 μl of CCK-8 (DoJinDo, CK04) was added to each well. The plates were incubated for an additional 2 h, and the absorbance was detected at a wavelength of 450 nm. Luciferase activities were assayed using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter System (Promega, E1960) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The ChIP assay was conducted using Dahl's protocol (35.Dahl J.A. Collas P. A rapid micro chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (microChIP).Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 1032-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde and sonicated to shear the DNA to an average fragment size of 200–1000 bp. After centrifugation, the supernatants were incubated with the SRSF2 antibody (Abcam, ab11826) and IgG antibody (Abcam, ab205719). Chromatin DNA was purified with the Dynabeads Protein G kit (Invitrogen, 10004D) and subjected to real-time PCR. The region-specific primers are listed in Table 1. The RNA immunoprecipitation assay was performed using the protocol of Peritz et al. (36.Peritz T. Zeng F. Kannanayakal T.J. Kilk K. Eiríksdóttir E. Langel U. Eberwine J. Immunoprecipitation of mRNA-protein complexes.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 577-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Briefly, HSV-1-infected HeLa cell lysates were incubated with the anti-SRSF2 antibody (Abcam, ab11826) and IgG antibody (Abcam, ab205719) at 4 °C overnight. RNA enriched from the immunoprecipitation was retro-transcribed for the real-time PCR. The primers for RT-PCR analysis were as follows: ICP0-exon 1, 5′-TCTCCGCATCACCACAGAAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GTTCCAGTGTAAGGGTCGGG-3′ (antisense); ICP0-exon 2-1, 5′-CGGATGTCTGGGTGTTTCCC-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCTCGAACAGTTCCGTGTCC-3′ (antisense); ICP0-exon2-2, 5′-TGCATCCCGTGCATGAAAAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCTGATTGCCCGTCCAGATA-3′ (antisense); ICP0-exon 3, 5′-GCCAGGAAAACCCCTCCC-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGGAGGAAGAGGCAGAGGAG-3′ (antisense); NEAT1, 5′-GAGAACCAAAGGGAGGGGTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGCTGCGTATGCAAGTCTGA-3′ (antisense). The immunoprecipitation assaywas performed using the immunoprecipitation protein G Dynabeads® kit (Invitrogen, 10007D) according to the manufacturer's protocol. To digest the RNA or DNA, the cell lysate was preincubated with either 250 μg/ml RNase A (Takara, 2158) or 50 units of DNase I (Takara, 2212) for 10 min. To evaluate the influence of SRSF2 on HSV-1 replication, HeLa cells were transfected with SRSF2 siRNA or SRSF2-FLAG plasmid for 36 h. After infection with HSV-1 for 12 h, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. After blocking, the cells were incubated with an anti-HSV-1 antibody (Abcam, ab9533). The cells were washed, counterstained with DAPI, and observed with an Olympus FV1000 confocal laser microscope. The fluorescence signal value was measured with Image J software and normalized to a single cell. To validate the interaction between SRSF2 and the ICP0, ICP27, and TK promoter fragments, DNA FISH was performed as previously described in Zhang et al. (37.Zhang L.F. Huynh K.D. Lee J.T. Perinucleolar targeting of the inactive X during S phase: evidence for a role in the maintenance of silencing.Cell. 2007; 129: 693-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Briefly, the P4 region of the ICP0 promoter (−380-(−206)), the P2 region of the ICP27 promoter (138–297), and P3 region of the TK gene (-227-(−65)) were amplified and labeled with biotin using the BioNick Labeling System (Invitrogen, 18247-015). HSV-1-infected HeLa cells were incubated with these biotin-labeled promoter regions (10 ng/μl) at 42 °C for 12–16 h. For the co-localization studies, the cells were fixed again and incubated with the anti-SRSF2 antibody (Abcam, ab11826) after DNA-FISH. The cells were washed, counterstained with DAPI, and observed with an Olympus FV1000 confocal laser microscope. The intensity plots for the red and green channels were analyzed with ImageJ software. DNA-FISH and immunofluorescence microscopy experiments in mock-infected nuclei were used as a negative control. To investigate the interaction between SRSF2 and RNAP II, ICP27, or ICP8, HSV-1-infected HeLa cells were fixed and incubated with the anti-SRSF2 antibody (Abcam, ab11826 or Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-10252), the anti-RNAP II antibody (Abcam, ab5131), the anti-ICP27 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-17544), or the anti-ICP8 antibody (Abcam, ab20194). The cells were washed, counterstained with DAPI, and observed with an Olympus FV1000 confocal laser microscope. The intensity plots for the red and green channels were analyzed with ImageJ software. To verify the interaction between SRSF2 and ICP0 exon 3, the ICP0 exon 3 region with or without the potential SRSF2-binding site was transcribed in vitro by T7 RNA polymerase and labeled with DIG) using the DIG Northern Starter Kit (Roche Applied Science, 12039672910). RNA-FISH and immunofluorescence microscopy were performed as previously described in (38.Wang P. Xue Y. Han Y. Lin L. Wu C. Xu S. Jiang Z. Xu J. Liu Q. Cao X. The STAT3-binding long noncoding RNA lnc-DC controls human dendritic cell differentiation.Science. 2014; 344: 310-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2540497705,"Transglutaminase 2 (TG2) is a Ca2+-dependent cross-linking enzyme involved in the pathogenesis of CD. We have previously characterized a panel of anti-TG2 mAbs generated from gut plasma cells of celiac patients and identified four epitopes (epitopes 1-4) located in the N-terminal part of TG2. Binding of the mAbs induced allosteric changes in TG2. Thus, we aimed to determine whether these mAbs could influence enzymatic activity through modulation of TG2 susceptibility to oxidative inactivation and Ca2+ affinity. All tested epitope 1 mAbs, as well as 679-14-D04, which recognizes a previously uncharacterized epitope, prevented oxidative inactivation and increased Ca2+ sensitivity of TG2. We have identified crucial residues for binding of 679-14-D04 located within a Ca2+ binding site. Epitope 1 mAbs and 679-14-D04, although recognizing separate epitopes, behaved similarly when assessing their effect on TG2 conformation, suggesting that the shared effects on TG2 function can be explained by induction of the same conformational changes. None of the mAbs targeting other epitopes showed these effects, but epitope 2 mAbs reduced the rate of TG2-catalyzed reactions. Collectively, these effects could be relevant to the pathogenesis of CD. In A20 B cells transduced with TG2-specific B-cell receptor, epitope 2-expressing cells had poorer uptake of TG2-gluten complexes and were less efficient in gluten epitope presentation to T cells than cells expressing an epitope 1 receptor. Thus, the ability of epitope 1-targeting B cells to keep TG2 active and protected from oxidation might explain why generation of epitope 1-targeting plasma cells seems to be favored in celiac patients."
https://openalex.org/W2542909904,"In the HIV-1 replication cycle, the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery promotes viral budding and release in the late stages. In this process, the ESCRT proteins, ALIX and TSG101, are recruited through interactions with HIV-1 Gag p6. ALG-2, also known as PDCD6, interacts with both ALIX and TSG101 and bridges ESCRT-III and ESCRT-I. In this study, we show that ALG-2 affects HIV-1 production negatively at both the exogenous and endogenous levels. Through a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified HEBP2 as the binding partner of ALG-2, and we solved the crystal structure of the ALG-2·HEBP2 complex. The function of ALG-2·HEBP2 complex in HIV-1 replication was further explored. ALG-2 inhibits HIV-1 production by affecting Gag expression and distribution, and HEBP2 might aid this process by tethering ALG-2 in the cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W2539575873,"The increased incidence of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in postmenopausal women has been proposed to be associated with a reduction in the level of 17-β estradiol (E2). E2 has also been shown to enhance the multi-differentiation ability of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) in vitro. However, studies on the potential value of E2 for tissue engineering in SUI treatment are rare. In the present study, we successfully fabricated myogenically differentiated ASCs (MD-ASCs), which were seeded onto a Poly(l-lactide)/Poly(e-caprolactone) electrospinning nano-scaffold, and incorporated E2 into the system, with the aim of improving the proliferation and myogenic differentiation of ASCs. ASCs were collected from the inguinal subcutaneous fat of rats. The proliferation and myogenic differentiation of ASCs, as well as the nano-scaffold biocompatibility of MD-ASCs, with or without E2 supplementation, were investigated. We demonstrated that E2 incorporation enhanced the proliferation of ASCs in vitro, and the most optimal concentration was 10-9 M. E2 also led to modulation of the MD-ASCs phenotype toward a concentrated type with smooth muscle-inductive medium. The expression of early (alpha-smooth muscle actin), mid (calponin), and late-stage (myosin heavy chain) contractile markers in MD-ASCs was enhanced by E2 during the different differentiation stages. Furthermore, the nano-scaffold was biocompatible with MD-ASCs, and cell proliferation was significantly enhanced by E2. Taken together, these results demonstrate that E2 can enhance the proliferation and myogenic differentiation of ASCs and can be used to construct a biocompatible cell/nano-scaffold. These scaffolds with desirable differentiation cells show promising applications for tissue engineering."
https://openalex.org/W2543999828,"The Hedgehog (HH) pathway is a mediator in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Surprisingly, previous studies suggested that primary cilia (PC), the essential organelles for HH signal transduction, were lost in PDAC. The aim of this study was to determine the presence of PC in human normal pancreas, chronic pancreatitis, and during carcinogenesis to PDAC with focus on both epithelia and stroma.PC were analyzed in paraffin sections from normal pancreas, chronic pancreatitis, intraductal papillary-mucinous neoplasia, and PDAC, as well as in primary human pancreatic stellate cells (PSC) and pancreatic cancer cell lines by double immunofluorescence staining for acetylated α-tubuline and γ-tubuline. Co-staining for the HH receptors PTCH1, PTCH2 and SMO was also performed.PC are gradually lost during pancreatic carcinogenesis in the epithelium: the fraction of cells with PC gradually and significantly decreased from 32% in ducts of normal pancreas, to 21% in ducts of chronic pancreatitis, to 18% in PanIN1a, 6% in PanIN2, 3% in PanIN3 and to 1.2% in invasive PDAC. However, this loss of PC in the neoplastic epithelium is accompanied by a gain of PC in the surrounding stroma. The fraction of stromal cells with PC significantly increased from 13% around normal ducts to about 30% around PanIN and PDAC. HH-receptors were detected in tumor stroma but not in epithelial cells. PC are also present in PSC and pancreatic cancer cell lines.PC are not lost during pancreatic carcinogenesis but re-distributed from the epithelium to the stroma. This redistribution may explain the re-direction of HH signaling towards the stroma during pancreatic carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2539714870,"DNA-protein loops can be essential for gene regulation. The Escherichia coli lactose (lac) operon is controlled by DNA-protein loops that have been studied for decades. Here we adapt this model to test the hypothesis that negative superhelical strain facilitates the formation of short-range (6–8 DNA turns) repression loops in E. coli. The natural negative superhelicity of E. coli DNA is regulated by the interplay of gyrase and topoisomerase enzymes, adding or removing negative supercoils, respectively. Here, we measured quantitatively DNA looping in three different E. coli strains characterized by different levels of global supercoiling: wild type, gyrase mutant (gyrB226), and topoisomerase mutant (ΔtopA10). DNA looping in each strain was measured by assaying repression of the endogenous lac operon, and repression of ten reporter constructs with DNA loop sizes between 70–85 base pairs. Our data are most simply interpreted as supporting the hypothesis that negative supercoiling facilitates gene repression by small DNA-protein loops in living bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2545013582,"Preservatives are added to cosmetics to protect the consumers from infections and prevent product spoilage. The concentration of preservatives should be kept as low as possible and this can be achieved by adding potentiating agents. The aim of the study was to investigate the mechanisms behind potentiation of the bactericidal effect of a commonly used preservative, 2-phenoxyethanol (PE), by the potentiating agent ethylhexylglycerin (EHG). Sub-lethal concentrations of EHG (0.075%) and PE (0.675%) in combination led to rapid killing of E. coli (> 5 log reduction of cfu after 30 min), leakage of cellular constituents, disruption of the energy metabolism, morphological deformities of cells and condensation of DNA. Used alone, EHG disrupted the membrane integrity even at low concentrations. In conclusion, sub-lethal concentrations of EHG potentiate the effect of PE through damage of the cell membrane integrity. Thus, adding EHG to PE in a 1:9 ratio has a similar effect on membrane damage and bacterial viability as doubling the concentration of PE. This study provides insight about the mechanism of action of a strong potentiating agent, EHG, which is commonly used in cosmetics together with PE."
https://openalex.org/W2539762920,"MicroRNAs are reported to have a crucial role in the regulation of self-renewal and differentiation of stem cells. Hypoxia has been identified as a key biophysical element of the stem cell culture milieu however, the link between hypoxia and miRNA expression in stem cells remains poorly understood. We therefore explored miRNA expression in hypoxic human embryonic and mesenchymal stem cells (hESCs and hMSCs). A total of 50 and 76 miRNAs were differentially regulated by hypoxia (2% O2) in hESCs and hMSCs, respectively, with a negligible overlap of only three miRNAs. We found coordinate regulation of precursor and mature miRNAs under hypoxia suggesting their regulation mainly at transcriptional level. Hypoxia response elements were located upstream of 97% of upregulated hypoxia regulated miRNAs (HRMs) suggesting hypoxia-inducible-factor (HIF) driven transcription. HIF binding to the candidate cis-elements of specific miRNAs under hypoxia was confirmed by Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with qPCR. Role analysis of a subset of upregulated HRMs identified linkage to reported inhibition of differentiation while a downregulated subset of HRMs had a putative role in the promotion of differentiation. MiRNA-target prediction correlation with published hypoxic hESC and hMSC gene expression profiles revealed HRM target genes enriched in the cytokine:cytokine receptor, HIF signalling and pathways in cancer. Overall, our study reveals, novel and distinct hypoxia-driven miRNA signatures in hESCs and hMSCs with the potential for application in optimised culture and differentiation models for both therapeutic application and improved understanding of stem cell biology."
https://openalex.org/W2540325197,"The literature on the impact of internal migration on under-five mortality in sub-Saharan Africa has been limited. This study examined the impact of internal migration on under-five mortality rate in 27 sub-Saharan African countries.The analysis used cross-sectional data from the most recent Demographic and Health Surveys of 27 sub-Saharan African countries. Information on the number of live births and the number of under-five deaths in the five years preceding the surveys in these countries was examined. Using variables from which migration data were generated, four migration statuses were computed, and the impact of each migration status on under-five mortality was analysed by using multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models.Of the 96333 live births, 7036 deaths were reported. In the unadjusted model, we found that, compared to urban non-migrant mothers, hazard of under-five mortality was 20% [HR: 1.20; 95% confidence interval (CI): (1.06–1.35)], 40% [HR: 1.40; 95% CI: (1.29–1.53)], and 43% [HR: 1.43; 95% CI: (1.30–1.58)] higher among urban-rural migrant, rural non-migrant, and rural-urban migrant mothers respectively. The likelihood of children dying did not change considerably when country and demographic variables were adjusted for. However, after controlling for health care service utilization factors, the results remained consistently significant for rurality. That is, mortality rates remained significantly higher among children of rural non-migrant [(HR: 1.20; 95% CI: (1.08–1.33), P-value (p) < 0.001] and rural-urban migrant [HR: 1.29; 95% CI: (1.15–1.45), p < 0.001] mothers than those of urban non-migrant mothers.Although under-five child mortality rate declined by 52% between 1990 and 2015 (from 179 to 86 per1000 live births) in sub-Saharan Africa, the continent still has the highest rate in the world. This finding highlights the need to consider providing education and health care services in rural areas, when implementing interventions meant to reduce under-five mortality rates among internal migrant mothers."
https://openalex.org/W2540977716,"Some level of uncertainty is unavoidable in acquiring the mass, geometry parameters and stability derivatives of an aerial vehicle. In certain instances tiny perturbations of these could potentially cause considerable variations in flight characteristics. This research considers the impact of varying these parameters altogether. This is a generalization of examining the effects of particular parameters on selected modes present in existing literature. Conventional autopilot designs commonly assume that each flight channel is independent and develop single-input single-output (SISO) controllers for every one, that are utilized in parallel for actual flight. It is demonstrated that an attitude controller built like this can function flawlessly on separate nominal cases, but can become unstable with a perturbation no more than 2%. Two robust multi-input multi-output (MIMO) design strategies, specifically loop-shaping and μ-synthesis are outlined as potential substitutes and are observed to handle large parametric changes of 30% while preserving decent performance. Duplicating the loop-shaping procedure for the outer loop, a complete flight control system is formed. It is confirmed through software-in-the-loop (SIL) verifications utilizing blade element theory (BET) that the autopilot is capable of navigation and landing exposed to high parametric variations and powerful winds."
https://openalex.org/W2543232489,"Habitat structure plays an important mediating role in predator-prey interactions. However the effects are strongly dependent on regional predator pools, which can drive predation risk in habitats with very similar structure in opposite directions. In the Mediterranean Sea predation on juvenile sea urchins is commonly known to be regulated by seagrass structure. In this study we test whether the possibility for juvenile Paracentrotus lividus to be predated changes in relation to the fragmentation of the seagrass Posidonia oceanica (four habitat classes: continuous, low-fragmentation, high-fragmentation and rocks), and to the spatial arrangement of such habitat classes at a landscape scale. Sea urchin predation risk was measured in a 20-day field experiment on tethered individuals placed in three square areas 35×35 m2 in size. Variability of both landscape and habitat structural attributes was assessed at the sampling grain 5×5 m2. Predation risk changed among landscapes, as it was lower where more 'rocks', and thus less seagrass, were present. The higher risk was found in the 'continuous' P. oceanica rather than in the low-fragmentation, high-fragmentation and rock habitats (p-values = 0.0149, 0.00008, and 0.0001, respectively). Therefore, the expectation that juvenile P. lividus survival would have been higher in the 'continuous' seagrass habitat, which would have served as shelter from high fish predation pressure, was not met. Predation risk changed across habitats due to different success between attack types: benthic attacks (mostly from whelks) were overall much more effective than those due to fish activity, the former type being associated with the 'continuous' seagrass habitat. Fish predation on juvenile sea urchins on rocks and 'high-fragmentation' habitat was less likely than benthic predation in the 'continuous' seagrass, with the low seagrass patch complexity increasing benthic activity. Future research should be aimed at investigating, derived from the complex indirect interactions among species, how top-down control in marine reserves can modify seagrass habitat effects."

Patients with decompensated cirrhosis, HIV/AIDS, or liver transplantation prior to dual diagnosis were excluded.Physician mix categories: patients were assigned to one of four physician mix categories: primary care physicians (PCP) with no gastroenterologists (GI) or endocrinologists (ENDO); GI/ENDO with no PCP; PCP and GI/ENDO; and neither PCP nor GI/ENDO. Health care utilization: annual physician visits and health care expenditures were assessed by four physician mix categories.Throughout the 14 years of study, 92% of patients visited PCPs (54% with GI/ENDO and 39% with no GI/ENDO). The percentage who visited PCPs without GI/ENDO decreased 22% (from 63% to 49%), while patients who also visited GI/ENDO increased 71% (from 25% to 42%).This is the first large nationally representative study to document the types of physicians seen by patients dually-diagnosed with diabetes and cirrhosis. A large proportion of these complex patients only visited PCPs, but there was a trend toward greater specialty care. The trend toward co-management by both PCPs and GI/ENDOs suggests that PCMH initiatives will be important for these complex patients. Documenting patterns of primary and specialty care is the first step toward improved care coordination."
https://openalex.org/W2546179230,"The dental pulp is a sterile highly vascularized tissue and has been commonly used as a biological material to detect the genome of infectious agents that reach the dental tissue. Indeed, the pulp is also used to reveal past and ancient infections in the field of paleomicrobiology. The present study aimed to detect the presence of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) in a small community (approximately 400 inhabitants) in the Amazon region of Brazil (Nossa Senhora do Perpetuo Socorro, Vizeu, Para, Brazil) and standardize a technique for the detection of the virus in the dental pulp. Serum samples were collected from 48 patients whose teeth were clinically recommended for surgical extraction. The group comprised an equal number of males and females, mostly agriculture workers and housewives, respectively. The majority (64.6%) received less than one minimum wage and were ill educated (less than four years of school years). An enzyme immune assay was used to detect antibodies to HCV and the 9 (18.8%) positive samples were submitted to nucleic acid extraction in the blood (using the EXTRAzol) and the pulp (QIAamp DNA Micro Kit e kit RNeasy Plus Micro). The pulp was removed using a modified protocol without the use of liquid nitrogen. Nucleic acid was found in 8 of the dental pulp, but in 7 of the blood samples. Sequencing of one of the samples showed the presence of genotype 1. Conclusions: A novel simplified methodology for the extraction and amplification of HCV nucleic acid was successful to detect the presence of persistent infections of the virus within the dental pulp tissue. The protocol may be helpful to detect past and ancient infections and to better understand the natural history of HCV."

We used archived tissue samples from golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos canadensis) in three geographic regions of western North America to conduct a preliminary study of the genetics of the North American subspecies, and to provide data for United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) decision-making for golden eagle management. We used a combination of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) D-loop sequences and 16 nuclear DNA (nDNA) microsatellite loci to investigate the extent of gene flow among our sampling areas in Idaho, California and Alaska and to determine if we could distinguish birds from the different geographic regions based on their genetic profiles. Our results indicate high genetic diversity, low genetic structure and high connectivity. Nuclear DNA Fst values between Idaho and California were low but significantly different from zero (0.026). Bayesian clustering methods indicated a single population, and we were unable to distinguish summer breeding residents from different regions. Results of the mtDNA AMOVA showed that most of the haplotype variation (97%) was within the geographic populations while 3% variation was partitioned among them. One haplotype was common to all three areas. One region-specific haplotype was detected in California and one in Idaho, but additional sampling is required to determine if these haplotypes are unique to those geographic areas or a sampling artifact. We discuss potential sources of the high gene flow for this species including natal and breeding dispersal, floaters, and changes in migratory behavior as a result of environmental factors such as climate change and habitat alteration. Our preliminary findings can help inform the USFWS in development of golden eagle management strategies and provide a basis for additional research into the complex dynamics of the North American subspecies."
https://openalex.org/W2544122369,"The stomach, which is characterized by acid peptic digestion in vertebrates, has been lost secondarily multiple times in the evolution of the teleost fishes. The Cypriniformes are largely seen as an agastric order; however, within the superfamily Cobitoidea, the closely related sister groups Nemacheilidae and Balitoridae have been identified as gastric families. The presence of these most recently diverged gastric families in an otherwise agastric clade indicates that either multiple (>2-3) loss events occurred with the Cyprinidae, Catostomidae and Cobitidae, or that gastric reinvention arose in a recent ancestor of the Nemacheilidae/Balitoridae sister clade. In the present study, the foregut regions of Cobitidae, Nemacheilidae/Balitoridae and the ancestral Botiidae family members were examined for the presence of gastric glands and gastric proton pump (Atp4a) α subunit expression by histology and immunohistochemistry respectively. Atp4a gene expression was assessed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Gastric glands expressing apical H+/K+-ATPase α subunit and isolated partial sequences of atp4a, identified using degenerate primers showing clear orthology to other vertebrate atp4a sequences, were detected in representative species from Nemacheilidae/ Balitoridae and Botiidae, but not Cobitidae (Misgurnus anguillicaudatus). In summary, we provide evidence for an uninterrupted gastric evolutionary lineage in the Cobitoidea, making it highly improbable that the stomach was reinvented in the Nemacheilidae/Balitoridae clade consistent with Dollo's principle. These results also indicate that the gastric trait may be present elsewhere in the Cobitoidea."
https://openalex.org/W2540351722,"Pharmacogenomics can explain the inter-individual differences in response to drugs, including methotrexate (MTX) used for acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) prophylaxis during hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In real-world practice, preplanned MTX dose is arbitrarily modified according to observed toxicity which can lead to unexpected and severe aGVHD development. We aimed to validate the influence of MTHFR C677T polymorphism on the outcomes of allogenic HSCT in a relatively under-represented homogenous Asian population. A total of 177 patients were divided into 677TT group versus 677C-carriers (677CT+677CC), and clinical outcomes along with baseline characteristics were analyzed and compared. Although there was a tendency towards increased peak liver function test results and accordingly greater delta values between the highest and the baseline in 677TT group, we found no associations between genotypes and hepatotoxicity. However, the incidence of acute liver GVHD (≥ grade 2) was significantly higher in the 677TT group than in the 677CC + 677CT group (P = 0.016). A total of 25 patients (14.1%) expired due to transplantation related mortality (TRM) during the first 180 days after HSCT. Patients carrying 677TT genotype were more likely to experience early TRM than 677C-carriers. The same pattern was observed in the cumulative TRM rate, and 677TT genotype patients were more prone to cumulative TRM (P = 0.010). This translated into shorter OS for patients with 677TT compared to 677C-carriers (P = 0.010). The 3-year survival after HSCT was 29.9% for 677TT cases and 47.1% for 677C-carriers. The multivariate analysis identified 677TT genotype (HR = 1.775. 95% CI 1.122–2.808, P = 0.014) and non-CR state (HR = 2.841. 95% CI 1.627–4.960, P<0.001) as predictors for survival. In conclusion, the MTHFR 677TT genotype appears to be associated with acute liver GVHD, and represent a risk factor for TRM and survival in patients undergoing HSCT with MTX as GVHD prophylaxis."
https://openalex.org/W2544549075,"Folding of proteins usually involves intermediates, of which an important type is the molten globule (MG). MGs are ensembles of interconverting conformers that contain (non-)native secondary structure and lack the tightly packed tertiary structure of natively folded globular proteins. Whereas MGs of various purified proteins have been probed to date, no data are available on their presence and/or effect during protein synthesis. To study whether MGs arise during translation, we use ribosome-nascent chain (RNC) complexes of the electron transfer protein flavodoxin. Full-length isolated flavodoxin, which contains a non-covalently bound flavin mononucleotide (FMN) as cofactor, acquires its native α/β parallel topology via a folding mechanism that contains an off-pathway intermediate with molten globular characteristics. Extensive population of this MG state occurs at physiological ionic strength for apoflavodoxin variant F44Y, in which a phenylalanine at position 44 is changed to a tyrosine. Here, we show for the first time that ascertaining the binding rate of FMN as a function of ionic strength can be used as a tool to determine the presence of the off-pathway MG on the ribosome. Application of this methodology to F44Y apoflavodoxin RNCs shows that at physiological ionic strength the ribosome influences formation of the off-pathway MG and forces the nascent chain toward the native state."
https://openalex.org/W2541365112,"Delays are ubiquitous in biological systems, ranging from genetic regulatory networks and synaptic conductances, to predator/pray population interactions. The evidence is mounting, not only to the presence of delays as physical constraints in signal propagation speed, but also to their functional role in providing dynamical diversity to the systems that comprise them. The latter observation in biological systems inspired the recent development of a computational architecture that harnesses this dynamical diversity, by delay-coupling a single nonlinear element to itself. This architecture is a particular realization of Reservoir Computing, where stimuli are injected into the system in time rather than in space as is the case with classical recurrent neural network realizations. This architecture also exhibits an internal memory which fades in time, an important prerequisite to the functioning of any reservoir computing device. However, fading memory is also a limitation to any computation that requires persistent storage. In order to overcome this limitation, the current work introduces an extended version to the single node Delay-Coupled Reservoir, that is based on trained linear feedback. We show by numerical simulations that adding task-specific linear feedback to the single node Delay-Coupled Reservoir extends the class of solvable tasks to those that require nonfading memory. We demonstrate, through several case studies, the ability of the extended system to carry out complex nonlinear computations that depend on past information, whereas the computational power of the system with fading memory alone quickly deteriorates. Our findings provide the theoretical basis for future physical realizations of a biologically-inspired ultrafast computing device with extended functionality."
https://openalex.org/W2545309142,"Introduction Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is a psychotherapeutic treatment resolving emotional distress caused by traumatic events. With EMDR, information processing is facilitated by eye movements (EM) during the recall of a traumatic memory (RECALL). The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of ocular movements of EMDR on the hemodynamics of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Material and Methods Two groups were recruited: a trial group (wEM) received a complete EMDR treatment, whereas a control group (woEM) received a therapy without EM. PFC hemodynamics was monitored by near-infrared spectroscopy during RECALL and during focusing on the worst image of the trauma (pre-RECALL). The parameters of oxy- (oxy-Hb), and deoxy-hemoglobin (deoxy-Hb) were acquired and analyzed in time domain, by calculating the slope within pre-RECALL and RECALL periods, and in the frequency domain, by calculating the mean power of oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb in the very-low frequency (VLF, 20–40 mHz) and low frequency (LF, 40–140 mHz) bandwidths. We compared pre-RECALL with RECALL periods within subjects, and pre-RECALL and RECALL parameters of wEM with the corresponding of woEM. Results An effect of group on mean slope of oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb in pre-RECALL and oxy-Hb in RECALL periods was observed. wEM showed a lower percentage of positive angular coefficients during pre-RECALL with respect to RECALL, on the opposite of woEM. In the frequency domain, wEM had significant difference in oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb LF of left hemisphere, whereas woEM showed no difference. Discussion and Conclusion We observed the effect of EM on PFC oxygenation during EMDR, since wEM subjects showed a mean increase of oxy-Hb during RECALL and a decrease during pre-RECALL, as opposed to woEM. Frequency analysis evidenced a reduction of activity of sympathetic nervous system in wEM group during pre-RECALL. Our outcomes revealed a different hemodynamics induced by eye movements in wEM with respect to woEM group."
