https://openalex.org/W2084493621,"Macromolecular modeling and design are increasingly useful in basic research, biotechnology, and teaching. However, the absence of a user-friendly modeling framework that provides access to a wide range of modeling capabilities is hampering the wider adoption of computational methods by non-experts. RosettaScripts is an XML-like language for specifying modeling tasks in the Rosetta framework. RosettaScripts provides access to protocol-level functionalities, such as rigid-body docking and sequence redesign, and allows fast testing and deployment of complex protocols without need for modifying or recompiling the underlying C++ code. We illustrate these capabilities with RosettaScripts protocols for the stabilization of proteins, the generation of computationally constrained libraries for experimental selection of higher-affinity binding proteins, loop remodeling, small-molecule ligand docking, design of ligand-binding proteins, and specificity redesign in DNA-binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2035832696,"G protein-coupled receptor hetero-oligomerization is emerging as an important regulator of ligand-dependent transmembrane signaling, but precisely how receptor heteromers affect receptor pharmacology remains largely unknown. In this study, we have attempted to identify the functional significance of the heteromeric complex between CXCR4 and CXCR7 chemokine receptors. We demonstrate that co-expression of CXCR7 with CXCR4 results in constitutive recruitment of β-arrestin to the CXCR4·CXCR7 complex and simultaneous impairment of Gi-mediated signaling. CXCR7/CXCR4 co-expression also results in potentiation of CXCL12 (SDF-1)-mediated downstream β-arrestin-dependent cell signaling pathways, including ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and SAPK as judged from the results of experiments using siRNA knockdown to deplete β-arrestin. Interestingly, CXCR7/CXCR4 co-expression enhances cell migration in response to CXCL12 stimulation. Again, inhibition of β-arrestin using either siRNA knockdown or a dominant negative mutant abrogates the enhanced CXCL12-dependent migration of CXCR4/CXCR7-expressing cells. These results show how CXCR7, which cannot signal directly through G protein-linked pathways, can nevertheless affect cellular signaling networks by forming a heteromeric complex with CXCR4. The CXCR4·CXCR7 heterodimer complex recruits β-arrestin, resulting in preferential activation of β-arrestin-linked signaling pathways over canonical G protein pathways. CXCL12-dependent signaling of CXCR4 and its role in cellular physiology, including cancer metastasis, should be evaluated in the context of potential functional hetero-oligomerization with CXCR7.

Among the 20 or so known chemokine receptors, CXCR4 and its cognate ligand, stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1) or CXCL12, have been studied extensively given their essential role in directing cell migration during numerous developmental processes, including organogenesis, hematopoiesis, vascularization, and immune responses (2Busillo J.M.

It serves as a secondary co-receptor for HIV-1 cellular entry and is involved in mediating the development and targeted metastasis of primary endothelial tumors, including breast, prostate, ovary, and lung (5Alkhatib G.

The CXCR7-SDF-1 complex did not, however, activate the canonical Gi-mediated signaling network leading to the conclusion that CXCR7 may be a nonsignaling chemokine receptor, possibly akin to the erythrocyte chemokine scavenger, Duffy (also called the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines) (11Balabanian K.

Although the exact molecular mechanisms responsible for the ability of CXCR7, a putative nonsignaling receptor, to promote tumor growth and survival remain unclear, recent studies have attempted to provide mechanistic insight. Heterodimerization between CXCR4 and CXCR7 has been postulated as one mechanism for modulating CXCR4 function (20Levoye A. Balabanian K. Baleux F. Bachelerie F. Lagane B. Blood. 2009; 113: 6085-6093Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 21Luker K.E. Gupta M. Luker G.D. FASEB J. 2009; 23: 823-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 22Sierro F. Biben C.

FASEB J. 2009; 23: 823-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) demonstrated that CXCR4 and CXCR7 can each form homo- and heterodimers. Furthermore, co-expression of CXCR7 with CXCR4 resulted in modulation of CXCR4-mediated Gi activation and signaling (20Levoye A. Balabanian K. Baleux F. Bachelerie F. Lagane B. Blood. 2009; 113: 6085-6093Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Additionally, even though CXCR7 does not signal through the canonical G protein pathways, it may signal in a biased fashion through the alternative β-arrestin-mediated signaling pathways (23Luker K.E. Gupta M. Steele J.M. Foerster B.R. Luker G.D. Neoplasia. 2009; 11: 1022-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 24Rajagopal S. Kim J. Ahn S. Craig S. Lam C.M. Gerard N.P. Gerard C.

Based on these observations, we decided to test whether CXCR7 heterodimerization with CXCR4 would serve to create a distinct signaling entity with unique properties and serve to alter chemokine receptor pharmacology. We report here that the association of CXCR4 and CXCR7 causes impaired CXCR4-promoted Gi activation and signaling and promotes activation of alternative downstream β-arrestin-dependent signal transduction pathways. We demonstrate that the CXCR4·CXCR7 complex constitutively recruits β-arrestin and potentiates cell proliferative kinase pathways, including p38 MAPK, SAPK, and ERK1/2 activation leading to increased cell migration of CXCR4-expressing breast cancer cells. HEK293, Neuro2A, and MDA-MB-231 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. U87 stable cell lines expressing CD4 or CD4 and CXCR4 were grown in DMEM under G418 (Invitrogen) selection. For all transfections, LipofectamineTM2000 (Invitrogen) was used on 60–80% confluent cells in a 6-well plate according to the manufacturer's protocol. For expression in HEK293 and Neuro2A cells, 3 μg of FLAG-tagged CXCR7 receptor cDNA was co-transfected with 1 μg of C9-tagged CXCR4 and/or 1 μg of eGFP-tagged β-arrestin1 (βarr-GFP) with pcDNA3.1 used to keep the total amount of transfected DNA constant in all cases. Similarly, 1 μg of HA-tagged CXCR4 was co-transfected with 1 μg of C9-tagged CCR5 or 3 μg of FLAG-tagged CXCR7. The FLAG epitope was introduced by PCR on the C-terminal tail of CXCR7 using the forward oligonucleotide ATTGGATCCCCATGGATCTGCATCTCTTCGACTAC and the reverse oligonucleotide TAACTCGAGTTAGTCATCATCGTCCTTGTAGTCTTTGGTGCTCTGCTCCAAGG. The amplified fragment was cloned into pcDNA3.1 using the introduced BamHI and XhoI sites. 5 × 104 cells/well were plated on a 96-well plate 24 h after transfection. The next day, the wells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with either 12G5, 2D7, or 11G8 monoclonal antibodies (BD Biosciences) in PBS, 0.5% BSA on ice for 2 h. ELISA was performed as described (26Décaillot F.M. Rozenfeld R. Gupta A. Devi L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 16045-16050Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). For immunostaining, cells were plated 24 h after transfection on glass coverslips coated with poly-d-lysine (Sigma). The next day, cells were fixed with methanol and incubated with polyclonal anti-FLAG and monoclonal 1D4 antibodies in PBS, 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) at room temperature for 1 h. Cells were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with secondary Alexa-594 anti-rabbit antibodies and Alexa-488 anti-mouse or Alexa-647 anti-mouse antibodies. Coverslips were mounted on Superfrost/Plus slides (ThermoFisher), and fluorescence was observed using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. HEK293T cells were transfected as above. 48 h after transfection, cells were washed three times and lysed in a buffer containing 1% CHAPSO (ThermoFisher), 10% glycerol, 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8), 0.5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) for 1 h. The supernatant fraction collected after 20 min of centrifugation was then incubated overnight at 4 °C with 10% (v/v) ImmunoPure immobilized protein A/G (Pierce) and 3–5 μg of anti-FLAG polyclonal or M2 monoclonal (Sigma) antibodies. For IP of cell surface receptors, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with 3–5 μg of 11G8 monoclonal antibodies for 2 h on ice before lysis step and supernatant fractions were incubated with the same amount of beads. The beads were washed three times in lysis buffer, and elution was performed in 100 μl of 1× Laemmli buffer at 37 °C for 2 h on shaker. Samples were separated using NuPAGE system (Invitrogen) and subjected to Western blotting using anti-FLAG, anti-GFP (Cell Signaling), anti-HA (Covance) polyclonal or 1D4 monoclonal antibodies. Detection was performed after incubation with peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) on an AlphaImager system (Alpha Innotech Corp.). For protein kinases studies, 24 h after transfection, cells were plated in a 24-well plate coated with poly-d-lysine and serum-starved overnight. Cells were then treated with 100 nm SDF-1α (PeproTech) for indicated times and lysed with 100 μl of 1× Laemmli buffer prewarmed at 65 °C. Samples were sonicated, and 30 μl was separated as above and subjected to Western blotting using anti-phospho or anti-total p38, SAPK, or ERK1/2 antibodies (Cell Signaling). In a 6-well plate, 0.8 μg of CXCR4 with or without 0.4 or 1.2 μg of CXCR7 or CCR5 cDNA were co-transfected with 4 μg of responsive element-secreted alkaline plasmid per well. 24 h after transfection, cells were plated onto a poly-d-lysine-coated 384-well plate and serum-starved overnight. The next day, cells were stimulated for 6 h in media without serum with 10 μm forskolin and prespecified concentrations of SDF-1α. For pretreatments, 500 nm ITAC (PeproTech) or 1 μm AMD3100 or 0.4 μg/well of 12G5 or 11G8 antibodies were incubated in media without serum for 1 h prior to SDF-1 stimulation. 1.5 μl of each well supernatant fraction was transferred into a second 384-well plate, and the levels of alkaline phosphatase activity were quantified as described using an EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (26Décaillot F.M. Rozenfeld R. Gupta A. Devi L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 16045-16050Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). β-Arrestin2 expression was silenced using prevalidated ON-TARGET plus SMART pool siRNA duplexes targeting human β-arrestin2 (catalogue no. L- 007292-00-0005, Thermo Scientific). ON-TARGET plus nontargeting pool (catalogue no. D-001810-10−05, Thermo Scientific) was used as control. The day before transfection, cells were seeded in 6-well plates in regular growth medium without antibiotics and grown overnight. The day of transfection, LipofectamineTM2000 (Invitrogen)·plasmid·siRNA complexes were prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were transfected with either 100 nm β-arrestin2 siRNA or control nontargeting siRNA complexes for 6 h followed by replacement with fresh growth medium, including antibiotics. Transfected cells were assayed 48 h post-transfection. Suppression of gene target was confirmed using quantitative PCR. Briefly, total RNA was generated from siRNA-transfected cells followed by first strand cDNA synthesis. cDNA template was used to determine gene expression levels using gene-specific primers against β-arrestin2 (forward primer CCAGGGTCTTCAAGAAGTC and reverse primer TTGCCCAAGTACACGGT and probe (6-FAM)CTAACTGCAAGCTCACCG(TAMRA-6-FAM)) and GAPDH (hsGAPDH-forward CGACATCAGCCGCATCT and hsGAPDH-reverse CTAGCCTCCCGGGTTTCTCT, and hsGAPDH probe (6-FAM)TCGCCAGGTGAAGACGGGCG(TAMRA-6-FAM)). Quantitative PCR was performed in 96-well plates on ABI 7900HT sequence detection system, and SDS 2.3 software was used for data analysis. β-Arrestin2 knockdown was calculated using ΔΔCT method normalized to GAPDH reference gene and nontargeting siRNA control treated cells. Cell migration was assayed using transwells (8 μm pore; Falcon). The lower chamber was filled with 0.5 ml of cell migration medium (DMEM with 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) in the presence or absence of ligand (SDF-1α, ITAC). U87-CXCR4 and MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with varying concentrations of CXCR7 expression vector were trypsinized and resuspended to 5 × 105 cells/ml. For β-arrestin inhibition experiment, β-arrestin2 targeting siRNA or β-arrestin dominant negative (βArr DN) mutants were used. βArr DN (V53D) (27Ferguson S.S. Downey 3rd, W.E. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S. Ménard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar) was generated using site-directed mutagenesis, and the mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cell suspension (200 μl) was added to the top chamber, and cells were allowed to migrate at 37 °C, 5% CO2, for 3–6 h. For U87-CXCR4 stable cell line (obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health; U87.CD4.CXCR4 was from Dr. HongKui Deng and Dr. Dan R. Littman) (28Björndal A. Deng H. Jansson M. Fiore J.R. Colognesi C. Karlsson A. Albert J. Scarlatti G. Littman D.R. Fenyö E.M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7478-7487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 12.5 nm SDF-1α in cell migration medium was added to the bottom chamber. For MDA-MB-231 cells, an SDF-1α dose-response curve was generated using 0–100 nm SDF-1α. The upper surface of the insert was wiped with a cotton tip to mechanically remove the nonmigratory cells. The migrated cells attached to the lower surface were imaged on an inverted Zeiss Axiovert followed by lysis in buffer containing CyQUANT® DNA-binding dye (Invitrogen). Each sample was measured in triplicate in a fluorescent plate reader (excitation 488 nm and emission 530 nm) 30–60 min after staining. Migration index was calculated as the fluorescent intensity measured from cells that migrated in response to chemokine divided by the fluorescent intensity measured from cells present in the lower chamber in the absence of chemokine. The data presented are an average of three different experiments. Each cell line was measured in triplicate wells in three different experiments. Based on the overlap in tissue expression profile of CXCR4 and CXCR7 and their ability to bind to the same chemokine ligand CXCL12/SDF-1 (henceforth referred to as SDF-1), we investigated the potential of these two chemokine receptors to form heterodimers or higher order oligomeric complexes at the cell surface. Co-expression of differentially C-terminally tagged CXCR4-C9 and CXCR7-FLAG in HEK293 cells resulted in co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) of CXCR4-C9 together with CXCR7-FLAG (Fig. 1A). Conversely, reciprocal co-IP of CXCR7 upon immunoprecipitation of CXCR4-C9 was also observed (data not shown). Similar results were obtained using HA-tagged CXCR4 (CXCR4-HA) (data not shown). Moreover, we found that immunoprecipitation of cell surface expressed CXCR7 from intact cells using 11G8, a conformation-specific CXCR7 antibody, led to the detection of co-immunoprecipitated CXCR4 (Fig. 1B). In contrast, co-expression of CXCR4 and CCR5 resulted in very little co-IP between CXCR4 and CCR5 (supplemental Fig. 1A). Immunofluorescence studies of CXCR4-C9 and CXCR7-FLAG performed in Neuro2A cells co-expressing both receptors revealed co-localization of the two receptors on the cell surface as well as distinct puncta within the cell (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these results strongly point toward the existence of a CXCR4·CXCR7 complex in cells expressing both receptors. We next examined the functional effects of the CXCR4· CXCR7 complex on SDF-1-mediated signaling. Active CXCR4 stimulates heterotrimeric inhibitory G protein (Gi), which inhibits cellular adenylyl cyclase activity and decreases cAMP levels. We used a cAMP reporter gene assay, based on SEAP to study the effects of SDF-1 on Gi-mediated inhibition of cAMP production (26Décaillot F.M. Rozenfeld R. Gupta A. Devi L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 16045-16050Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). SDF-1 stimulation leads to strong inhibition of forskolin (FK)-induced cAMP production in HEK293 cells expressing CXCR4 (Fig. 1D). In contrast, SDF-1 treatment of cells expressing CXCR7 failed to induce a similar effect (Fig. 1D). However, CXCR7 co-expression along with CXCR4 strongly attenuated SDF-1-induced inhibition of cellular cAMP production. The effect of CXCR7 on SDF-1-induced CXCR4 signaling was dose-dependent (Fig. 1D). The effect was also specific to CXCR7 because co-expression of the same amounts of CCR5, which is also Gi-coupled, did not induce a similar shift in EC50 (Fig. 1E). This shift is not due to altered cell surface expression of CXCR4 because we did not see any significant decrease in cell surface levels of CXCR4 in the presence of CXCR7 (supplemental Fig. 1B). These results indicate that CXCR7 plays a role in regulating the coupling of CXCR4 to Gi to affect G protein-mediated downstream signaling. Our findings are in general agreement with a recently published study wherein CXCR7 co-expression resulted in decreased coupling of G proteins and decreased mobilization of intracellular calcium levels, another signaling pathway activated by Gi downstream of CXCR4 stimulation (20Levoye A. Balabanian K. Baleux F. Bachelerie F. Lagane B. Blood. 2009; 113: 6085-6093Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). We next investigated the effect of CXCR7-specific ligand interferon-inducible T-cell α chemoattractant/CXCL11 on the CXCR4·CXCR7 complex. Similar to SDF-1, ITAC binds to CXCR7 but does not induce G protein signaling via CXCR7 (15Thelen M. Thelen S. J. Neuroimmunol. 2008; 198: 9-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Interestingly, preincubation of CXCR4/CXCR7 co-expressing cells with 500 nm ITAC relieves the negative effect of CXCR7 on SDF1-mediated CXCR4 signaling (Fig. 1F). ITAC restores SDF-1-dependent inhibition of cellular cAMP production downstream of CXCR4 activation (Fig. 1F). β-Arrestin plays a prominent role in both signaling and internalization events downstream of GPCRs. Given that recent studies have demonstrated the ability of CXCR7 to recruit β-arrestin in a ligand-dependent manner (23Luker K.E. Gupta M. Steele J.M. Foerster B.R. Luker G.D.

CXCR7-FLAG and βArr-GFP were co- transfected with or without CXCR4-C9 in HEK293 cells. We observed low levels of basal and ligand-dependent interaction between CXCR7 and β-arrestin (Fig. 2, A and B). Surprisingly, co-expression of CXCR4 and CXCR7 resulted in a dramatic increase in both basal and SDF-1-induced β-arrestin co-immunoprecipitation with CXCR7 (Fig. 2, A and B). The enhanced recruitment of β-arrestin is specific for the CXCR4·CXCR7 complex, because co-expression of CCR5 did not result in increased association of β-arrestin with CXCR7 (Fig. 2, A and B). Further studies are needed to delineate the structural and molecular determinants involved in β-arrestin recruitment that could presumably be located on either CXCR4 and CXCR7 or distributed on both receptors (see under “Discussion”). Interestingly, as opposed to the effect of treatment with SDF-1, treatment of CXCR4/CXCR7-co-expressing cells with ITAC did not result in a further increase in β-arrestin recruitment (Fig. 2C). In fact, there was a slight but reproducible decrease in β-arrestin recruitment to the CXCR4·CXCR7 complex upon treatment with ITAC (Fig. 2C). In addition to co-IP, we also observed co-localization of CXCR4 and CXCR7 with β-arrestin in Neuro-2A cells co-expressing all three components (Fig. 2D). Notably, we did not observe any co-localization between CXCR7 and β-arrestin in the absence of CXCR4 (data not shown), suggesting that CXCR4 is required for the enhanced interaction between CXCR7 and β-arrestin. Taken together, our data demonstrate that CXCR7 not only induces a shift in G protein coupling of CXCR4 but also constitutively interacts with β-arrestin in the presence of CXCR4. Additionally, CXCR7-specific ligand ITAC pretreatment restores SDF-1-mediated Gi signaling as well as leads to reduced association of β-arrestin to the CXCR4·CXCR7 complex. This suggests a potentially interesting role for ITAC in modulating the CXCR4·CXCR7 heteromeric complex and/or its signaling pathways. Both CXCR4 and CXCR7 have been shown independently to potentiate cell signaling pathways that are important for cell proliferation and tumor growth (9Müller A. Homey B. Soto H. Ge N. Catron D.

We examined the effects of CXCR4/CXCR7 co-expression on the SDF-1-mediated ERK1/2 signaling pathway.

This is in accordance with previous evidence showing that CXCR7 co-expression leads to sustained ERK1/2 activation (22Sierro F. Biben C. Martínez-Muñoz L. Mellado M. Ransohoff R.M. Li M. Woehl B.

However, the large size of such systems is challenging for traditional structure modeling methods. This paper describes the implementation of a general framework for modeling arbitrary symmetric systems in Rosetta3. We describe the various types of symmetries relevant to the study of protein structure that may be modeled using Rosetta's symmetric framework. We then describe how this symmetric framework is efficiently implemented within Rosetta, which restricts the conformational search space by sampling only symmetric degrees of freedom, and explicitly simulates only a subset of the interacting monomers. Finally, we describe structure prediction and design applications that utilize the Rosetta3 symmetric modeling capabilities, and provide a guide to running simulations on symmetric systems."
https://openalex.org/W1996001084,"Background The occurrence of diabetes has greatly increased in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in Asia, as has the prevalence of overweight and obesity; in European-derived populations, overweight and obesity are established causes of diabetes. The shape of the association of overweight and obesity with diabetes risk and its overall impact have not been adequately studied in Asia. Methods and Findings A pooled cross-sectional analysis was conducted to evaluate the association between baseline body mass index (BMI, measured as weight in kg divided by the square of height in m) and self-reported diabetes status in over 900,000 individuals recruited in 18 cohorts from Bangladesh, China, India, Japan, Korea, Singapore and Taiwan. Logistic regression models were fitted to calculate cohort-specific odds ratios (OR) of diabetes for categories of increasing BMI, after adjustment for potential confounding factors. OR were pooled across cohorts using a random-effects meta-analysis. The sex- and age-adjusted prevalence of diabetes was 4.3% in the overall population, ranging from 0.5% to 8.2% across participating cohorts. Using the category 22.5–24.9 Kg/m2 as reference, the OR for diabetes spanned from 0.58 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.31, 0.76) for BMI lower than 15.0 kg/m2 to 2.23 (95% CI 1.86, 2.67) for BMI higher than 34.9 kg/m2. The positive association between BMI and diabetes prevalence was present in all cohorts and in all subgroups of the study population, although the association was stronger in individuals below age 50 at baseline (p-value of interaction<0.001), in cohorts from India and Bangladesh (p<0.001), in individuals with low education (p-value 0.02), and in smokers (p-value 0.03); no differences were observed by gender, urban residence, or alcohol drinking. Conclusions This study estimated the shape and the strength of the association between BMI and prevalence of diabetes in Asian populations and identified patterns of the association by age, country, and other risk factors for diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2027515342,"Background Wolbachia are intriguing symbiotic endobacteria with a peculiar host range that includes arthropods and a single nematode family, the Onchocercidae encompassing agents of filariases. This raises the question of the origin of infection in filariae. Wolbachia infect the female germline and the hypodermis. Some evidences lead to the theory that Wolbachia act as mutualist and coevolved with filariae from one infection event: their removal sterilizes female filariae; all the specimens of a positive species are infected; Wolbachia are vertically inherited; a few species lost the symbiont. However, most data on Wolbachia and filaria relationships derive from studies on few species of Onchocercinae and Dirofilariinae, from mammals. Methodology/Principal Findings We investigated the Wolbachia distribution testing 35 filarial species, including 28 species and 7 genera and/or subgenera newly screened, using PCR, immunohistochemical staining, whole mount fluorescent analysis, and cocladogenesis analysis. (i) Among the newly screened Onchocercinae from mammals eight species harbour Wolbachia but for some of them, bacteria are absent in the hypodermis, or in variable density. (ii) Wolbachia are not detected in the pathological model Monanema martini and in 8, upon 9, species of Cercopithifilaria. (iii) Supergroup F Wolbachia is identified in two newly screened Mansonella species and in Cercopithifilaria japonica. (iv) Type F Wolbachia infect the intestinal cells and somatic female genital tract. (v) Among Oswaldofilariinae, Waltonellinae and Splendidofilariinae, from saurian, anuran and bird respectively, Wolbachia are not detected. Conclusions/Significance The absence of Wolbachia in 63% of onchocercids, notably in the ancestral Oswaldofilariinae estimated 140 mya old, the diverse tissues or specimens distribution, and a recent lateral transfer in supergroup F Wolbachia, modify the current view on the role and evolution of the endosymbiont and their hosts. Further genomic analyses on some of the newly sampled species are welcomed to decipher the open questions."
https://openalex.org/W2003635675,"When small molecules or proteins are injected into live animals, their physical and chemical properties will significantly affect pharmacokinetics, tissue penetration, and the ultimate routes of metabolism and clearance. Fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) offers the ability to non-invasively image and quantify temporal changes in fluorescence throughout the major organ systems of living animals, in a manner analogous to traditional approaches with radiolabeled agents. This approach is best used with biotherapeutics (therapeutic antibodies, or other large proteins) or large-scaffold drug-delivery vectors, that are minimally affected by low-level fluorophore conjugation. Application to small molecule drugs should take into account the significant impact of fluorophore labeling on size and physicochemical properties, however, the presents studies show that this technique is readily applied to small molecule agents developed for far-red (FR) or near infrared (NIR) imaging. Quantification by non-invasive FMT correlated well with both fluorescence from tissue homogenates as well as with planar (2D) fluorescence reflectance imaging of excised intact organs (r2 = 0.996 and 0.969, respectively). Dynamic FMT imaging (multiple times from 0 to 24 h) performed in live mice after the injection of four different FR/NIR-labeled agents, including immunoglobulin, 20–50 nm nanoparticles, a large vascular imaging agent, and a small molecule integrin antagonist, showed clear differences in the percentage of injected dose per gram of tissue (%ID/g) in liver, kidney, and bladder signal. Nanoparticles and IgG1 favored liver over kidney signal, the small molecule integrin-binding agent favored rapid kidney and bladder clearance, and the vascular agent, showed both liver and kidney clearance. Further assessment of the volume of distribution of these agents by fluorescent volume added information regarding their biodistribution and highlighted the relatively poor extravasation into tissue by IgG1. These studies demonstrate the ability of quantitative FMT imaging of FR/NIR agents to non-invasively visualize and quantify the biodistribution of different agents over time."

Here, we examined the effect of HMGB1 in chronically failing hearts.Adult C57 BL16 female mice underwent coronary artery ligation; three weeks later 200 ng HMGB1 or denatured HMGB1 (control) were injected in the peri-infarcted region of mouse failing hearts. Four weeks after treatment, both echocardiography and hemodynamics demonstrated a significant improvement in LV function in HMGB1-treated mice. Further, HMGB1-treated mice exhibited a ∼23% reduction in LV volume, a ∼48% increase in infarcted wall thickness and a ∼14% reduction in collagen deposition. HMGB1 induced cardiac regeneration and, within the infarcted region, it was found a ∼2-fold increase in c-kit⁺ cell number, a ∼13-fold increase in newly formed myocytes and a ∼2-fold increase in arteriole length density. HMGB1 also enhanced MMP2 and MMP9 activity and decreased TIMP-3 levels. Importantly, miR-206 expression 3 days after HMGB1 treatment was 4-5-fold higher than in control hearts and 20-25 fold higher that in sham operated hearts. HMGB1 ability to increase miR-206 was confirmed in vitro, in cardiac fibroblasts. TIMP3 was identified as a potential miR-206 target by TargetScan prediction analysis; further, in cultured cardiac fibroblasts, miR-206 gain- and loss-of-function studies and luciferase reporter assays showed that TIMP3 is a direct target of miR-206.HMGB1 injected into chronically failing hearts enhanced LV function and attenuated LV remodelling; these effects were associated with cardiac regeneration, increased collagenolytic activity, miR-206 overexpression and miR-206 -mediated inhibition of TIMP-3."
https://openalex.org/W2054708422,"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in verbal communication, social interactions, and the presence of repetitive, stereotyped and compulsive behaviors. Excessive early brain growth is found commonly in some patients and may contribute to disease phenotype. Reports of increased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and other neurotrophic-like factors in autistic neonates suggest that enhanced anabolic activity in CNS mediates this overgrowth effect. We have shown previously that in a subset of patients with severe autism and aggression, plasma levels of the secreted amyloid-β (Aβ) precursor protein-alpha form (sAPPα) were significantly elevated relative to controls and patients with mild-to-moderate autism. Here we further tested the hypothesis that levels of sAPPα and sAPPβ (proteolytic cleavage products of APP by α- and β-secretase, respectively) are deranged in autism and may contribute to an anabolic environment leading to brain overgrowth. We measured plasma levels of sAPPα, sAPPβ, Aβ peptides and BDNF by corresponding ELISA in a well characterized set of subjects. We included for analysis 18 control, 6 mild-to-moderate, and 15 severely autistic patient plasma samples. We have observed that sAPPα levels are increased and BDNF levels decreased in the plasma of patients with severe autism as compared to controls. Further, we show that Aβ1-40, Aβ1-42, and sAPPβ levels are significantly decreased in the plasma of patients with severe autism. These findings do not extend to patients with mild-to-moderate autism, providing a biochemical correlate of phenotypic severity. Taken together, this study provides evidence that sAPPα levels are generally elevated in severe autism and suggests that these patients may have aberrant non-amyloidogenic processing of APP."

We validated a multiplex RT-PCR assay for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae in Brazil. Risk factors for being culture-negative, RT-PCR positive were determined. The sensitivity of RT-PCR in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was 100% (95% confidence limits, 96.0%-100%) for N. meningitidis, 97.8% (85.5%-99.9%) for S. pneumoniae, and 66.7% (9.4%-99.2%) for H. influenzae. Specificity ranged from 98.9% to 100%. Addition of RT-PCR to routine microbiologic methods increased the yield for detection of S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis, and H. influenzae cases by 52%, 85%, and 20%, respectively. The main risk factor for being culture negative and RT-PCR positive was presence of antibiotic in CSF (odds ratio 12.2, 95% CI 5.9-25.0). RT-PCR using CSF was highly sensitive and specific and substantially added to measures of meningitis disease burden when incorporated into routine public health surveillance in Brazil."
https://openalex.org/W2022722296,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) regulates neuronal differentiation, synaptic plasticity, and morphology, and modest changes in BDNF levels results in complex behavioral phenotypes. BDNF levels and intracellular localization in neurons are regulated by multiple mechanisms, including use of distinct promoters, mRNA and protein transport, and regulated cleavage of proBDNF to mature BDNF. Sortilin is an intracellular chaperone that binds to the prodomain of BDNF to traffic it to the regulated secretory pathway. However, sortilin binds to numerous ligands and plays a major role in mannose 6-phosphate receptor-independent transport of lysosomal hydrolases utilizing motifs in the intracellular domain that mediate trafficking from the Golgi and late endosomes. Sortilin is modified by ectodomain shedding, although the biological implications of this are not known. Here we demonstrate that ADAM10 is the preferred protease to cleave sortilin in the extracellular stalk region, to release the ligand binding sortilin ectodomain from the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. We identify sortilin shedding at the cell surface and in an intracellular compartment. Both sortilin and BDNF are trafficked to and degraded by the lysosome in neurons, and this is dependent upon the sortilin cytoplasmic tail. Indeed, expression of the sortilin ectodomain, which corresponds to the domain released after shedding, impairs lysosomal targeting and degradation of BDNF. These findings characterize the regulation of sortilin shedding and identify a novel mechanism by which sortilin ectodomain shedding acts as a regulatory switch for delivery of BDNF to the secretory pathway or to the lysosome, thus modulating the bioavailability of endogenous BDNF."

We tested the hypothesis that rural-to-urban migrants have different macronutrient and food group intake to rural non-migrants, and that migrants have a diet more similar to urban non-migrants.The diets of migrants of rural origin, their rural dwelling sibs, and those of urban origin together with their urban dwelling sibs were assessed by an interviewer-administered semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. A total of 6,509 participants were included. Median energy intake in the rural, migrant and urban groups was 2731, 3078, and 3224 kcal respectively for men, and 2153, 2504, and 2644 kcal for women (p<0.001). A similar trend was seen for overall intake of fat, protein and carbohydrates (p<0.001), though differences in the proportion of energy from these nutrients were <2%. Migrant and urban participants reported up to 80% higher fruit and vegetable intake than rural participants (p<0.001), and up to 35% higher sugar intake (p<0.001). Meat and dairy intake were higher in migrant and urban participants than rural participants (p<0.001), but varied by region. Sibling-pair analyses confirmed these results. There was no evidence of associations with time in urban area.Rural to urban migration appears to be associated with both positive (higher fruit and vegetables intake) and negative (higher energy and fat intake) dietary changes. These changes may be of relevance to cardiovascular health and warrant public health interventions."
https://openalex.org/W1966925175,"Inferences about species loss following habitat conversion are typically drawn from short-term surveys, which cannot reconstruct long-term temporal dynamics of extinction and colonization. A long-term view can be critical, however, to determine the stability of communities within fragments. Likewise, landscape dynamics must be considered, as second growth structure and overall forest cover contribute to processes in fragments. Here we examine bird communities in 11 Amazonian rainforest fragments of 1–100 ha, beginning before the fragments were isolated in the 1980s, and continuing through 2007. Using a method that accounts for imperfect detection, we estimated extinction and colonization based on standardized mist-net surveys within discreet time intervals (1–2 preisolation samples and 4–5 post-isolation samples). Between preisolation and 2007, all fragments lost species in an area-dependent fashion, with loss of as few as <10% of preisolation species from 100-ha fragments, but up to 70% in 1-ha fragments. Analysis of individual time intervals revealed that the 2007 result was not due to gradual species loss beginning at isolation; both extinction and colonization occurred in every time interval. In the last two samples, 2000 and 2007, extinction and colonization were approximately balanced. Further, 97 of 101 species netted before isolation were detected in at least one fragment in 2007. Although a small subset of species is extremely vulnerable to fragmentation, and predictably goes extinct in fragments, developing second growth in the matrix around fragments encourages recolonization in our landscapes. Species richness in these fragments now reflects local turnover, not long-term attrition of species. We expect that similar processes could be operating in other fragmented systems that show unexpectedly low extinction."
https://openalex.org/W2046702878,"Confocal microscopy images revealed that the tetratricopeptide repeat motif (TPR) domain immunophilin FKBP51 shows colocalization with the specific mitochondrial marker MitoTracker. Signal specificity was tested with different antibodies and by FKBP51 knockdown. This unexpected subcellular localization of FKBP51 was confirmed by colocalization studies with other mitochondrial proteins, biochemical fractionation, and electron microscopy imaging. Interestingly, FKBP51 forms complexes in mitochondria with the glucocorticoid receptor and the Hsp90/Hsp70-based chaperone heterocomplex. Although Hsp90 inhibitors favor FKBP51 translocation from mitochondria to the nucleus in a reversible manner, TPR domain-deficient mutants of FKBP51 are constitutively nuclear and fully excluded from mitochondria, suggesting that a functional TPR domain is required for its mitochondrial localization. FKBP51 overexpression protects cells against oxidative stress, whereas FKBP51 knockdown makes them more sensitive to injury. In summary, this is the first demonstration that FKBP51 is a major mitochondrial factor that undergoes nuclear-mitochondrial shuttling, an observation that may be related to antiapoptotic mechanisms triggered during the stress response."
https://openalex.org/W2015317524,"Much is known about the role of STAT3 in regulating differentiation of interleukin-17-producing Th17 cells, but its function in other lymphocyte subsets is not well understood. In this report, we reveal wide-ranging functions of STAT3 in T-cells and provide evidence that STAT3 is convergence point for mechanisms that regulate lymphocyte quiescence and those controlling T-cell activation and survival. We show here that STAT3 inhibits T-lymphocyte proliferation by up-regulating the expression of Class-O Forkhead transcription factors, which play essential roles in maintaining T-cells in quiescent state. We further show that STAT3 binds directly to FoxO1 or FoxO3a promoter and that STAT3-deficiency resulted in down-regulation of the expression of FoxO1, FoxO3a and FoxO-target genes (IκB and p27Kip1). Compared with wild-type T-cells, STAT3-deficient T-cells produced more IL-2, due in part, to marked decrease in IκB-mediated sequestration of NF-κB in the cytoplasm and resultant enhancement of NF-κB activation. However, the high level of IL-2 production by STAT3-deficient T-cells was partially restored to normal levels by overexpressing FoxO1. It is notable that their exaggerated increase in IL-2 production rendered STAT3-deficient lymphocytes more susceptible to activation-induced cell death, suggesting that STAT3 might protect T-cells from apoptosis by limiting their production of IL-2 through up-regulation of FoxO1/FoxO3a expression. Moreover, we found that STAT3 enhanced survival of activated T-cells by up-regulating OX-40 and Bcl-2 while down-regulating FasL and Bad expression, suggesting that similar to role of FoxOs in regulating the lifespan of worms, STAT3 and FoxO pathways converge to regulate lifespan of T-lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2037299664,"Precipitous declines in Africa's native fauna and flora are recognized, but few comprehensive records of these changes have been compiled. Here, we present population trends for African elephants in the 6,213,000 km2 Sudano-Sahelian range of West and Central Africa assessed through the analysis of aerial and ground surveys conducted over the past 4 decades. These surveys are focused on the best protected areas in the region, and therefore represent the best case scenario for the northern savanna elephants. A minimum of 7,745 elephants currently inhabit the entire region, representing a minimum decline of 50% from estimates four decades ago for these protected areas. Most of the historic range is now devoid of elephants and, therefore, was not surveyed. Of the 23 surveyed elephant populations, half are estimated to number less than 200 individuals. Historically, most populations numbering less than 200 individuals in the region were extirpated within a few decades. Declines differed by region, with Central African populations experiencing much higher declines (−76%) than those in West Africa (−33%). As a result, elephants in West Africa now account for 86% of the total surveyed. Range wide, two refuge zones retain elephants, one in West and the other in Central Africa. These zones are separated by a large distance (∼900 km) of high density human land use, suggesting connectivity between the regions is permanently cut. Within each zone, however, sporadic contacts between populations remain. Retaining such connectivity should be a high priority for conservation of elephants in this region. Specific corridors designed to reduce the isolation of the surveyed populations are proposed. The strong commitment of governments, effective law enforcement to control the illegal ivory trade and the involvement of local communities and private partners are all critical to securing the future of elephants inhabiting Africa's northern savannas."
https://openalex.org/W2082066647,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play important roles in initiation of innate and adaptive immune responses. Emerging evidence suggests that TLR agonists can serve as potential adjuvant for vaccination. Heat shock proteins (HSPs), functionally serving as TLR4 agonists, have been proposed to act as Th1 adjuvant. We have identified a novel Hsp70 family member, termed Hsp70-like protein 1 (Hsp70L1), shown that Hsp70L1 is a potent T helper cell (Th1) polarizing adjuvant that contributes to antitumor immune responses. However, the underlying mechanism for how Hsp70L1 exerts its Th1 adjuvant activity remains to be elucidated. In this study, we found that Hsp70L1 binds directly to TLR4 on the surface of DCs, activates MAPK and NF-κB pathways, up-regulates I-a(b), CD40, CD80, and CD86 expression and promotes production of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-12p70. Hsp70L1 failed to induce such phenotypic maturation and cytokine production in TLR4-deficient DCs, indicating a role for TLR4 in mediating Hsp70L1-induced DC activation. Furthermore, more efficient induction of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-specific Th1 immune response was observed in mice immunized by wild-type DCs pulsed with Hsp70L1-CEA(576-669) fusion protein as compared with TLR4-deficient DCs pulsed with same fusion protein. In addition, TLR4 antagonist impaired induction of CEA-specific human Th1 immune response in a co-culture system of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) from HLA-A2.1(+) healthy donors and autologous DCs pulsed with Hsp70L1-CEA(576-669) in vitro. Taken together, these results demonstrate that TLR4 is a key receptor mediating the interaction of Hsp70L1 with DCs and subsequently enhancing the induction of Th1 immune response by Hsp70L1/antigen fusion protein."
https://openalex.org/W2081105526,"Background We previously demonstrated the small heat shock protein, HSPB1, to prevent tachycardia remodeling in in vitro and in vivo models for Atrial Fibrillation (AF). To gain insight into its mechanism of action, we examined the protective effect of all 10 members of the HSPB family on tachycardia remodeling. Furthermore, modulating effects of HSPB on RhoA GTPase activity and F-actin stress fiber formation were examined, as this pathway was found of prime importance in tachycardia remodeling events and the initiation of AF. Methods and Results Tachypacing (4 Hz) of HL-1 atrial myocytes significantly and progressively reduced the amplitude of Ca2+ transients (CaT). In addition to HSPB1, also overexpression of HSPB6, HSPB7 and HSPB8 protected against tachypacing-induced CaT reduction. The protective effect was independent of HSPB1. Moreover, tachypacing induced RhoA GTPase activity and caused F-actin stress fiber formation. The ROCK inhibitor Y27632 significantly prevented tachypacing-induced F-actin formation and CaT reductions, showing that RhoA activation is required for remodeling. Although all protective HSPB members prevented the formation of F-actin stress fibers, their mode of action differs. Whilst HSPB1, HSPB6 and HSPB7 acted via direct prevention of F-actin formation, HSPB8-protection was mediated via inhibition of RhoA GTPase activity. Conclusion Overexpression of HSPB1, as well as HSPB6, HSPB7 and HSPB8 independently protect against tachycardia remodeling by attenuation of the RhoA GTPase pathway at different levels. The cardioprotective role for multiple HSPB members indicate a possible therapeutic benefit of compounds able to boost the expression of single or multiple members of the HSPB family."
https://openalex.org/W2064387973,"Cigarette smoke is the major risk factor associated with the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and alters expression of proteolytic enzymes that contribute to disease pathology. Previously, we reported that smoke exposure leads to the induction of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) through the activation of ERK1/2, which is critical to the development of emphysema. To date, the upstream signaling pathway by which cigarette smoke induces MMP-1 expression has been undefined. This study demonstrates that cigarette smoke mediates MMP-1 expression via activation of the TLR4 signaling cascade. In vitro cell culture studies demonstrated that cigarette smoke-induced MMP-1 was regulated by TLR4 via MyD88/IRAK1. Blockade of TLR4 or inhibition of IRAK1 prevented cigarette smoke induction of MMP-1. Mice exposed to acute levels of cigarette smoke exhibited increased TLR4 expression. To further confirm the in vivo relevance of this signaling pathway, rabbits exposed to acute cigarette smoke were found to have elevated TLR4 signaling and subsequent MMP-1 expression. Additionally, lungs from smokers exhibited elevated TLR4 and MMP-1 levels. Therefore, our data indicate that TLR4 signaling, through MyD88 and IRAK1, plays a predominant role in MMP-1 induction by cigarette smoke. The identification of the TLR4 pathway as a regulator of smoke-induced protease production presents a series of novel targets for future therapy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."
https://openalex.org/W1998785319,"Among the eukaryotes only plants and a number of fungi are able to synthesize biotin. Although initial events leading to the biosynthesis of biotin remain largely unknown, the final steps are known to occur in the mitochondria. Here we deleted the Aopex5 and Aopex7 genes encoding the receptors for peroxisomal targeting signals PTS1 and PTS2, respectively, in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae. In addition to exhibiting defects in the peroxisomal targeting of either PTS1 or PTS2 proteins, the deletion strains also displayed growth defects on minimal medium containing oleic acid as the sole carbon source. Unexpectedly, these peroxisomal transport-deficient strains also exhibited growth defects on minimal medium containing glucose as the sole carbon source that were remediated by the addition of biotin and its precursors, including 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid (KAPA). Genome database searches in fungi and plants revealed that BioF protein/KAPA synthase, one of the biotin biosynthetic enzymes, has a PTS1 sequence at the C terminus. Fungal ΔbioF strains expressing the fungal and plant BioF proteins lacking PTS1 still exhibited growth defects in the absence of biotin, indicating that peroxisomal targeting of KAPA synthase is crucial for the biotin biosynthesis. Furthermore, in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, AtBioF localized to the peroxisomes through recognition of its PTS1 sequence, suggesting involvement of peroxisomes in biotin biosynthesis in plants. Taken together we demonstrate a novel role for peroxisomes in biotin biosynthesis and suggest the presence of as yet unidentified peroxisomal proteins that function in the earlier steps of biotin biosynthesis. Among the eukaryotes only plants and a number of fungi are able to synthesize biotin. Although initial events leading to the biosynthesis of biotin remain largely unknown, the final steps are known to occur in the mitochondria. Here we deleted the Aopex5 and Aopex7 genes encoding the receptors for peroxisomal targeting signals PTS1 and PTS2, respectively, in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae. In addition to exhibiting defects in the peroxisomal targeting of either PTS1 or PTS2 proteins, the deletion strains also displayed growth defects on minimal medium containing oleic acid as the sole carbon source. Unexpectedly, these peroxisomal transport-deficient strains also exhibited growth defects on minimal medium containing glucose as the sole carbon source that were remediated by the addition of biotin and its precursors, including 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid (KAPA). Genome database searches in fungi and plants revealed that BioF protein/KAPA synthase, one of the biotin biosynthetic enzymes, has a PTS1 sequence at the C terminus. Fungal ΔbioF strains expressing the fungal and plant BioF proteins lacking PTS1 still exhibited growth defects in the absence of biotin, indicating that peroxisomal targeting of KAPA synthase is crucial for the biotin biosynthesis. Furthermore, in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, AtBioF localized to the peroxisomes through recognition of its PTS1 sequence, suggesting involvement of peroxisomes in biotin biosynthesis in plants. Taken together we demonstrate a novel role for peroxisomes in biotin biosynthesis and suggest the presence of as yet unidentified peroxisomal proteins that function in the earlier steps of biotin biosynthesis. Peroxisomes are ubiquitous organelles in eukaryotic cells and typically contain enzymes involved in β-oxidation of fatty acids and detoxification of reactive oxygen species. In addition, as peroxisomal matrix enzymes vary depending on the cellular environment and tissue, these organelles display diverse functions in different eukaryotic groups. For example, mammalian peroxisomes participate in the biosynthesis of lipids, such as ether phospholipids and cholesterol, and in the oxidation of amino acids and polyamines (1Wanders R.J. Waterham H.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 295-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). In plants, peroxisomes are involved in the glyoxylate cycle (2Mano S. Nishimura M. Vitam. Horm. 2005; 72: 111-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), photorespiration (3Reumann S. Weber A.P. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochim. Biophys.

Peroxisomes are also required for the formation of the Woronin body, an organelle specific to filamentous ascomycetes and functions in wound healing (12Liu F. Ng S.K. Lu Y. Low W. Lai J. Jedd G. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 325-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 13Escaño C.S. Juvvadi P.R. Jin F.J. Takahashi T. Koyama Y. Yamashita S. Maruyama J. Kitamoto K. Eukaryot.

Peroxisomes are known to play important roles during growth of higher organisms, which is exemplified by the fact that peroxisomal deficiency causes lethal neurological disorder in humans (14Gould S.J. Valle D. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 340-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and embryonic defects in plants (15Hu J. Aguirre M. Peto C. Alonso J. Ecker J. Chory J.

Plant Physiol. 2005; 139: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Evidenced by delayed germination and abnormal nuclear and mitochondrial morphology, several reports on peroxisome-deficient mutants in filamentous fungi have confirmed fundamental roles for peroxisomes during growth (9Bonnet C. Espagne E. Zickler D. Boisnard S. Bourdais A. Berteaux-Lecellier V. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 62: 157-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 20Idnurm A. Giles S.S. Perfect J.R. Heitman J.

However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the severe effects of peroxisomal deficiency during growth remain unknown. Peroxins encoded by PEX genes are the proteins required for peroxisomal biogenesis (22Distel B. Erdmann R. Gould S.J. Blobel G. Crane D.I. Cregg J.M. Dodt G. Fujiki Y. Goodman J.M. Just W.W. Kiel J.A. Kunau W.H. Lazarow P.B. Mannaerts G.P. Moser H.W. Osumi T. Rachubinski R.A. Roscher A. Subramani S. Tabak H.F. Tsukamoto T. Valle D. van der Klei I. van Veldhoven P.P. Veenhuis M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Most peroxins are engaged in the import of peroxisomal matrix proteins from the cytosol into the peroxisome lumen. In general, peroxisomal matrix proteins have either the peroxisomal targeting signal PTS1 or PTS2 sequences, which are typically located at the C and N termini, respectively. PTS1 sequence is a tripeptide motif with the consensus sequence (S/A)(K/R)(L/M) (23Heiland I. Erdmann R. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2362-2372Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), whereas PTS2 is defined by the motif (R/K)(L/V/I)-X5-(H/Q)(L/A/F/I) (24Brocard C. Hartig A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 1565-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The receptors of PTS1 and PTS2 are Pex5 and Pex7, respectively, and serve to load their cargoes to a large multiprotein complex at the peroxisomal membrane, which finally translocates the peroxisomal matrix proteins into the lumen (25Girzalsky W. Platta H.W. Erdmann R. Biol. Chem. 2009; 390: 745-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Because Pex5 and Pex7 transport different subsets of enzymes into the peroxisomes to initiate a complex network of peroxisomal metabolic pathways, any defect in either of the PTS receptors is expected to result in different metabolic defects and phenotypes. Biotin is an essential cofactor involved in a number of carboxylation and decarboxylation reactions (26Knowles J.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 195-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Although numerous bacteria, plants and a number of fungi are capable of biotin biosynthesis, this process has mainly been analyzed in bacteria and plants. These studies have revealed that the last four reactions, which convert pimeloyl-CoA to biotin, are conserved between bacteria and plants (27Streit W.R. Entcheva P. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2003; 61: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1). In plants, AtBioF, Bio1, Bio3, and Bio2 represent the homologs of bacterial BioF, BioA, BioD, and BioB, respectively, and are involved in the last four steps of biotin biosynthesis. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the flanking BIO3 and BIO1 genes is aligned unidirectionally and expressed as a chimeric transcript; the resultant Bio3-Bio1 product acts as a bifunctional protein (28Muralla R. Chen E. Sweeney C. Gray J.A. Dickerman A. Nikolau B.J. Meinke D. Plant Physiol. 2008; 146: 60-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Pinon et al. (29Pinon V. Ravanel S. Douce R. Alban C. Plant Physiol. 2005; 139: 1666-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) reported that AtBioF, which is responsible for the first step of the conserved biotin biosynthesis reactions in plants, localized to the cytoplasm. The last three steps occur in mitochondria as Bio3-Bio1 is predicted to have a putative mitochondrial targeting signal at its N terminus (28Muralla R. Chen E. Sweeney C. Gray J.A. Dickerman A. Nikolau B.J. Meinke D. Plant Physiol. 2008; 146: 60-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and Bio2 requires mitochondrial targeting for activity (30Arnal N. Alban C. Quadrado M. Grandjean O. Mireau H. Plant Mol. Biol. 2006; 62: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It was therefore suggested that plant biotin biosynthesis occurs in the cytoplasm and mitochondria (31Rébeillé F. Alban C. Bourguignon J. Ravanel S. Douce R. Photosynth. Res. 2007; 92: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, the upstream reactions of the eukaryotic biotin biosynthesis have never been investigated. Here, in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae, we found that growth defects of the peroxisomal transport-deficient strains are a result of biotin auxotrophy. Among the biotin biosynthetic enzymes, BioF proteins from fungi and plants have peroxisomal targeting sequences. We demonstrate that BioF proteins localize to peroxisomes, and its peroxisomal targeting is required for the biotin biosynthesis. For the first time we provide evidence supporting peroxisomal function in biotin biosynthesis of eukaryotic organisms and suggest a role for peroxisomes early in its biosynthesis pathway. A. oryzae strains used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S1, and the methods for their construction are described in the supplemental Methods. The routine liquid cultivation and growth analyses of the A. oryzae strains were performed with DPY medium (2% dextrin, 1% polypeptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% KH2PO4, 0.05% MgSO4·7H2O, pH 5.5) at 30 °C.

Transformation of A. oryzae was carried out as previously described (32Kitamoto K. Adv. Appl. Microbiol. 2002; 51: 129-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli DH5α was used for DNA manipulation. Czapek Dox peroxisomal targeting signal 1 peroxisomal targeting signal 2 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid dethiobiotin. Dethiobiotin (DTB) and biotin were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Pimelic acid was purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). 7-Keto-8-aminopelargonic acid (KAPA) was kindly provided by Ajinomoto Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. Pimeloyl-CoA was chemically synthesized and purified as described by Ploux and Marquet (33Ploux O. Marquet A. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For the growth analyses, the concentrations of KAPA, DTB, and biotin were 8.2 nm, and those of pimelic acid and pimeloyl-CoA were 8.2 μm and 82 μm, respectively. One gram of oleic acid (Sigma) was mixed with 100 μl of IGEPAL CA-630 (ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA), added into 10 ml of autoclaved water, and then stored at 4 °C. Conidia (1 × 103) of the A. oryzae strains were inoculated into 100 μl of liquid minimal medium on a glass-bottom dish (Asahi Techno Glass, Chiba, Japan) and incubated at 30 °C for 18 h. Confocal microscopy was performed using an IX71 inverted microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a CSU22 confocal scanning system (Yokogawa Electronics, Tokyo, Japan), an iXon cooled digital charged-coupled device camera (Andor Technology PLC, Belfast, UK), semi-conductor lasers at 488 nm (Furukawa Electric, Tokyo, Japan) and 561 nm (Melles Griot, Carlsbad, CA), and GFP, DsRed, and DualView filters (Nippon Roper, Chiba, Japan). Images were analyzed with iQ software (Andor Technology PLC). Conidia were inoculated in 100 μl of liquid medium and incubated in glass-bottom dishes at 30 °C for 24 h. Mycelia were transferred into a medium containing 1 μm MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. The mycelia were then washed twice with medium and observed by fluorescence microscopy. AtbioF cDNA was amplified using A. thaliana cDNA as a template and the following primer pairs (supplemental Table S2): GFP-FL-F and GFP-FL-R for EGFP-AtBioF; GFP-ΔPKL-F and GFP-ΔPKL-R for EGFP-AtBioFΔPKL; and FL-GFP-F and FL-GFP-R for AtBioF-EGFP. The resulting PCR fragments were cloned into pK7WGF2 or pK7FWG2 (34Karimi M. De Meyer B. Hilson P. Trends Plant Sci. 2005; 10: 103-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) by Gateway recombination (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The resultant vectors were introduced into leaf epidermal cells of A. thaliana (background Columbia) using a Model PDS-1000/He Biolistic particle delivery system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Fluorescence was visualized 20–24 h later. EGFP fluorescence of the fusion proteins was excited at 488 nm with an argon laser, and the emitted light was collected through a 500 nm to 530 nm filter and acquired using a Nikon Digital Eclipse C1si confocal laser scanning microscope system with a 60× Plan Apo oil-immersion lens (numerical aperture = 1.4). Peroxisomes were visualized by introducing the PTS2-RFP vector (35Mano S. Nakamori C. Nito K. Kondo M. Nishimura M. Plant J. 2006; 47: 604-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) into Arabidopsis leaf epidermal cells as described above. The fluorescence of PTS2-mRFP1 was excited at 543 nm with an HeNe laser, and the emitted light was collected through a 565 nm to 615 nm filter. Images were processed using a Nikon EZ-C1 Gold version 3.60 and Adobe Photoshop CS4 version 11.0.1. Genome database searches (available online in the website of the National Research Institute of Brewing, Japan) revealed that A. oryzae AO080509000034 (Aopex5) and AO080511000135 (Aopex7) encode proteins homologous to Pex5 and Pex7, respectively. We therefore deleted the entire ORF regions of the Aopex5 and Aopex7 genes and confirmed that the ΔAopex5 and ΔAopex7 strains were impaired in PTS1 and PTS2 targeting, respectively, to peroxisomes (supplemental Fig. S2). To examine whether these strains exhibited peroxisomal deficiency, their growth was assayed on minimal medium containing either glucose or oleic acid or acetate as the sole carbon source (Fig. 1A). Growth of the ΔAopex5 and ΔAopex7 strains on oleic acid minimal medium was hardly detectable, as previously reported for other fungal phenotypes of peroxisomal deficiency (21Hynes M.J. Murray S.L. Khew G.S. Davis M.A. Genetics. 2008; 178: 1355-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 36Erdmann R. Veenhuis M. Mertens D. Kunau W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1989; 86: 5419-5423Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). However, their growth was significantly decreased on glucose minimal medium (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, although the ΔAopex7 strain grew normally on acetate minimal medium (Fig. 1A), growth of the ΔAopex5 strain was significantly impaired, a result that was consistent with the Aspergillus nidulans Δpex5 (pexE) strain (21Hynes M.J. Murray S.L. Khew G.S. Davis M.A. Genetics. 2008; 178: 1355-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The growth defects of the ΔAopex5 and ΔAopex7 strains on minimal media were restored by the introduction of the wild-type Aopex5 and Aopex7 genes, respectively. On nutrient-rich medium, the growth of the ΔAopex5 and ΔAopex7 strains was comparable with the wild-type strain (Fig. 1A). Hyphal morphology of the ΔAopex5 and ΔAopex7 strains during germination in glucose minimal medium was observed microscopically (Fig. 1B). In both mutants the germinated conidia exhibited a swollen morphology. Taken together, these results indicated that the loss of the two PTS receptors caused abnormal polarity. We next attempted to identify compounds that could restore the defective growth phenotypes of the peroxisome-deficient strains. A complete growth recovery of the mutants was observed in rich medium, leading to the assumption that the peroxisome-deficient strains may require vitamins present in the yeast extract for their growth. To verify this possibility, glucose minimal medium was supplemented with a mixture of vitamins, including biotin, pantothenate, folic acid, riboflavin, and thiamine, which revealed growth recovery of the ΔAopex5 and ΔAopex7 strains. After a combination of vitamin supplementation experiments we found that supplementation with biotin alone was sufficient to restore their growth defects on glucose minimal medium (Fig. 2). Moreover abnormal polarity of the ΔAopex5 and ΔAopex7 strains was also suppressed by the addition of biotin (supplemental Fig. S3). However, addition of biotin in the oleic acid minimal medium did not restore the growth defects of the ΔAopex5 and ΔAopex7 strains (data not shown). To determine the cause of biotin auxotrophy of the peroxisome-deficient strains, we also examined whether the growth defects were restored by the addition of biotin biosynthetic precursors (Fig. 2). Although biotin is commonly synthesized from pimeloyl-CoA in bacteria and plants, the biosynthetic pathway leading to this precursor has not been clearly elucidated in eukaryotes. In our growth assays, three common precursors, pimeloyl-CoA, KAPA, and DTB (supplemental Fig. S1), and pimelic acid, the precursor of pimeloyl-CoA in Gram-positive bacteria (37Bower S. Perkins J. Yocum R.R. Serror P. Sorokin A. Rahaim P. Howitt C.L. Prasad N. Ehrlich S.D. Pero J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2572-2575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were used. On glucose minimal medium supplemented with either KAPA or DTB, growth of both the mutants was nearly identical to the wild-type strain. The growth defect of the ΔAopex7 strain was also restored on the medium supplemented with pimelic acid or pimeloyl-CoA; however, these supplements only caused formation of small colonies by the ΔAopex5 strain (Fig. 2). These results suggested that loss of the PTS1 receptor limits the biotin biosynthetic pathway up to the KAPA synthase, whereas the PTS2 receptor contributes to earlier steps of the pathway before the conversion of pimelic acid to pimeloyl-CoA. To further investigate the cause of biotin auxotrophy in the peroxisome-deficient strains, we analyzed the biotin biosynthetic pathway in A. oryzae. Genome database searches revealed that A. oryzae has an identical gene cluster for the last four steps of biotin biosynthesis as described in A. nidulans (28Muralla R. Chen E. Sweeney C. Gray J.A. Dickerman A. Nikolau B.J. Meinke D. Plant Physiol. 2008; 146: 60-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The cluster consists of three genes: AO080518000021, AO080518000022, and AO080518000023, which were designated AobioF, AobioD/A, and AobioB, respectively (supplemental Fig. S1). Moreover, AoBioF shared 23.2% identity with A. thaliana AtBioF (KAPA synthase) and possessed a PTS1 motif (ARL) at its C terminus, which is consistent with the fact that addition of KAPA restored the growth defect caused by loss of the PTS1 receptor (Fig. 2). Genome database searches in other organisms revealed that BioF proteins from fungi and plants also have the PTS1 sequence at their C termini (supplemental Fig. S4). This raised the possibility that the BioF protein/KAPA synthase has a function in the peroxisomes. To examine the function of fungal BioF protein, the entire coding sequence of the AobioF gene was deleted in A. oryzae. Although the resulting ΔAobioF strain was unable to grow on glucose minimal medium, the growth defect was restored in the presence of biotin (Fig. 3A) and its biosynthetic precursors (KAPA and DTB) but not by the upstream precursors (pimelic acid and pimeloyl-CoA) (supplemental Fig. S5). To further evaluate biotin auxotrophy of the ΔAobioF strain, A. thaliana AtBioF, which has KAPA synthase activity (29Pinon V. Ravanel S. Douce R. Alban C. Plant Physiol. 2005; 139: 1666-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), was expressed in the A. oryzae ΔAobioF strain (supplemental Fig. S6). Expression of AtBioF fused with mDsRed immediately upstream of its PTS1 motif (PKL) partially restored biotin auxotrophy of the ΔAobioF strain. Furthermore, replacement of the AtBioF PTS1 with the AoBioF PTS1 motif (ARL) and expression of the resulting AtBioF-mDsRed fusion protein in the ΔAobioF strain resulted in full restoration of the biotin auxotrophy. These data suggest that AoBioF functions as a KAPA synthase in the biotin biosynthetic pathway of A. oryzae. Next, to investigate the role for peroxisomal targeting of BioF protein in biotin biosynthesis, we constructed an A. orzyae strain endogenously expressing AoBioFΔPTS1, in which the genomic DNA region encoding PTS1 in the AobioF gene was deleted. The AobioFΔPTS1 strain was unable to grow on glucose minimal medium, and the growth defects could be restored by the addition of biotin (Fig. 3A) and its precursors (KAPA and DTB) but not by pimelic acid and pimeloyl-CoA (supplemental Fig. S5). Similarly, expression of A. thaliana AtBioF lacking the PTS1 motif did not restore biotin auxotrophy of the ΔAobioF strain (supplemental Fig. S6). This result indicated that the PTS1 sequence is required for the BioF proteins to function during biotin biosynthesis in glucose minimal medium. Microscopic observation of the ΔAobioF and AobioFΔPTS1 strains during germination in glucose minimal medium revealed that these strains displayed a swollen morphology of germinated conidia (Fig. 3B) similar to the ΔAopex5 and ΔAopex7 strains (Fig. 1B). This indicated that biotin auxotrophy due to the loss of the BioF protein function resulted in abnormal polar growth as observed in the peroxisome-deficient strains. We also analyzed growth of the ΔAobioF and AobioFΔPTS1 strains on acetate minimal medium. Although growth of the ΔAobioF strain was severely impaired, the AobioFΔPTS1 strain grew normally (Fig. 3A). This indicated that peroxisomal targeting of AoBioF is not required for biotin biosynthesis in acetate minimal medium. To examine the localization of fungal BioF protein, AoBioF-mDsRed-PTS1 and AoBioF-mDsRed-ΔPTS1 fusion proteins were expressed in the ΔAobioF strain. Growth assay on glucose minimal medium indicated that, although the expression of AoBioF-mDsRed-PTS1 restored biotin auxotrophy of the ΔAobioF strain, AoBioF-mDsRed-ΔPTS1 did not rescue this defective phenotype (supplemental Fig. S7). These growth phenotypes were consistent with those of the wild-type and AobioFΔPTS1 strains expressing wild-type AoBioF and AoBioFΔPTS1, respectively (Fig. 3A). Fluorescence microscopic observation revealed that AoBioF-mDsRed-PTS1 localized to the peroxisomes, whereas AoBioF-mDsRed-ΔPTS1 localized throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 4A). These results indicated that AoBioF is transported to peroxisomes by recognition of its PTS1 sequence. We also investigated localization of the AoBioF-mDsRed fusion proteins expressed in the ΔAobioF strain when cultured in acetate minimal medium. In the growth assay, not only AoBioF-mDsRed-PTS1 but also AoBioF-mDsRed-ΔPTS1 restored the biotin auxotrophy of the ΔAobioF strain (supplemental Fig. S7). The complementation by AoBioF-mDsRed-ΔPTS1 in acetate minimal medium coincided with the result of the AobioFΔPTS1 strain (Fig. 3A). Fluorescence microscopic analysis revealed that the localizations of AoBioF-mDsRed-PTS1 and AoBioF-mDsRed-ΔPTS1 are peroxisomal and cytoplasmic, respectively (supplemental Fig. S8), which are similar to those when cultured in glucose minimal medium (Fig. 4A). AobioD and AobioA are predicted to encode a chimeric protein that functions downstream of AoBioF (supplemental Fig. S1) and is similar to the case for A. nidulans, Ustilago maydis, and Cryptococcus neoformans (28Muralla R. Chen E. Sweeney C. Gray J.A. Dickerman A. Nikolau B.J. Meinke D. Plant Physiol. 2008; 146: 60-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Because the AoBioD/A chimeric protein has a putative mitochondrial targeting signal at its N terminus, we investigated the localization of AoBioD/A by integrating the egfp gene at the 3′-end of the AobioD/A ORF. The strain expressing AoBioD/A-EGFP endogenously grew normally in the absence of biotin (data not shown), suggesting that the fusion protein was functional. Fluorescence microscopic observation revealed that AoBioD/A localized to mitochondria (Fig. 4B). Finally, we examined whether peroxisomal localization of BioF was also observed in plants. Although Pinon et al. (29Pinon V. Ravanel S. Douce R. Alban C. Plant Physiol. 2005; 139: 1666-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) reported that A. thaliana AtBioF localized to the cytoplasm, we thought that this result may have been due to impaired PTS1 recognition caused by the C-terminal GFP fusion. Therefore, we evaluated AtBioF localization by fusing EGFP to either its N (EGFP-AtBioF) or C termini (AtBioF-EGFP) (Fig. 5). EGFP-AtBioF localized to the peroxisomes, whereas localizations of both AtBioF-EGFP and EGFP-AtBioF lacking PTS1 were observed throughout the cytoplasm. This result confirmed that AtBioF localizes to the peroxisomes of A. thaliana and requires an accessible PTS1 motif at the C terminus for proper targeting. In this study, we discovered a novel peroxisomal function: its involvement in biotin biosynthesis. Previous studies on biotin biosynthesis in the yeasts have provided limited information, because the commonly used yeast isolates, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae laboratory strain S288c, are biotin auxotrophs (38Hall C. Dietrich F.S. Genetics. 2007; 177: 2293-2307Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In A. nidulans, a model filamentous fungus, the biA1 mutant allele causes biotin auxotrophy (39Roper J.A. Nature. 1950; 166: 956-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, most of the previous studies on A. nidulans have used strains containing this mutant allele in the presence of biotin, which may have impeded the analysis of biotin biosynthesis. Furthermore, another model filamentous fungus, Neurospora crassa, is auxotrophic for biotin (40Vogel H.J. Microb. Genet. Bull. 1956; 13: 42-43Google Scholar), and according to the genome database it does not possess any BioF homologs. Consequently, our investigation on the industrial fungus A. oryzae revealed the involvement of peroxisomes in biotin biosynthesis for the first time. Peroxisomal targeting of AoBioF is required for biotin biosynthesis in minimal medium containing glucose as the sole carbon source (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4). Our genome database searches revealed that the BioF proteins from fungi and plants have a PTS1 motif at the C terminus (supplemental Fig. S4). In the human-pathogenic basidiomycete C. neoformans, peroxisome-deficient mutants are defective for growth in medium containing glucose as a carbon source, but not in nutrient-rich medium (20Idnurm A. Giles S.S. Perfect J.R. Heitman J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2007; 6: 60-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). C. neoformans has a BioF homolog containing PTS1 (supplemental Fig. S4), which suggests that the reported growth defect of peroxisomal mutants may also be due to biotin auxotrophy. We demonstrated that, in A. thaliana, AtBioF localizes to the peroxisomes by the PTS1 motif at the C terminus (Fig. 5, EGFP-AtBioF). Deletion of the PTS1 motif eliminated the peroxisomal localization of AtBioF (Fig. 5, EGFP-AtBioFΔPKL). Pinon et al. (29Pinon V. Ravanel S. Douce R. Alban C. Plant Physiol. 2005; 139: 1666-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) reported that AtBioF localized to the cytoplasm, however, this was based on the observations using AtBioF fused to GFP at its C terminus, as we also showed in this study (Fig. 5, AtBioF-EGFP). Because PTS1 is a conserved signal motif found at the extreme C terminus of peroxisomal proteins (23Heiland I. Erdmann R. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2362-2372Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), such a GFP fusion may prevent proper recognition of PTS1 motif by its receptor Pex5, resulting in mislocalization of AtBioF to the cytoplasm. Furthermore, our study demonstrates the functional requirement of BioF peroxisomal targeting for the biotin biosynthesis. Taken together, these results suggest that the KAPA synthase in the biotin biosynthetic pathway is a peroxisomal enzyme in both fungi and plants. Our present study provides a new model of biotin biosynthesis in eukaryotes, indicating that a biotin precursor KAPA is synthesized in peroxisomes (Fig. 6). Following its synthesis, KAPA may then be transported from the peroxisomes to mitochondria, which are the location of AoBioD/A, the next enzyme in the pathway (Fig. 4B). Although the later steps of biotin biosynthesis are established, the earlier steps in the biosynthetic pathway have not been investigated in eukaryotes. In bacteria, two different pathways for the formation of pimeloyl-moiety have been reported; one utilizes pimelic acid as a precursor for pimeloyl-CoA synthesis (37Bower S. Perkins J. Yocum R.R. Serror P. Sorokin A. Rahaim P. Howitt C.L. Prasad N. Ehrlich S.D. Pero J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2572-2575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the other involves a modified fatty acid synthetic pathway for synthesis of the pimeloyl-acyl carrier protein as recently reported in E. coli (41Lin S. Hanson R.E. Cronan J.E. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). A previous study in yeasts demonstrated that pimelic acid could be synthesized from long chain fatty acids such as oleic acid (42Ohsugi M. Miyauchi K. Tachibana K. Nakao S. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. 1988; 34: 343-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Here, the growth defect of the ΔAopex7 strain but not the ΔAopex5 strain was restored by the addition of pimelic acid and pimeloyl-CoA to glucose minimal medium (Fig. 2). Based on this result, we propose a model that a PTS2-dependent protein participates in the supply of pimelic acid and a PTS1-dependent protein then synthesizes pimeloyl-CoA from pimelic acid in peroxisomes (Fig. 6). We also found that the AobioFΔPTS1 strain grew normally on acetate minimal medium (Fig. 3A), in which AoBioFΔPTS1 was cytoplasmic (supplemental Fig. S8). It is presumed that pimeloyl-CoA is supplied in the cytoplasm when A. oryzae is cultured in acetate minimal medium. A similar phenomenon was reported for a peroxisomal enzyme, malate synthase (Mls1p); a S. cerevisiae strain expressing a PTS1-less Mls1p in the cytoplasm grows normally with acetate as a sole carbon source but displays reduced growth with oleic acid that requires peroxisomal β-oxidation (43Kunze M. Kragler F. Binder M. Hartig A. Gurvitz A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 915-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). When yeast cells utilize acetate and oleic acid, acetyl-CoA is supplied in the cytoplasm and peroxisomes, respectively (44Kunze M. Pracharoenwattana I. Smith S.M. Hartig A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 1441-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). However, the abovementioned assumption appears contradictory to the fact that the wild-type AoBioF targeted to the peroxisomes is also able to function in biotin biosynthesis in acetate minimal medium (supplemental Figs. S7 and S8). This raises one possibility that the wild-type AoBioF might act on pimeloyl-CoA in the cytoplasm before its peroxisomal targeting when A. oryzae is cultured in acetate minimal medium. To address this issue, further stringent analyses of the enzyme localization are required. On the other hand, the ΔAopex7 strain grew normally on acetate minimal medium in contrast to its growth defect on glucose minimal medium (Fig. 2), which is consistent with the report of C. neoformans peroxisome-deficient mutants (20Idnurm A. Giles S.S. Perfect J.R. Heitman J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2007; 6: 60-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This suggests that PTS2-dependent proteins are dispensable for biotin biosynthesis in acetate minimal medium. The A. oryzae peroxisome-deficient strains showing biotin auxotrophy exhibited abnormal polar growth (Fig. 1B). In plant A. thaliana, mutants deficient in biotin biosynthesis have defective embryos (28Muralla R. Chen E. Sweeney C. Gray J.A. Dickerman A. Nikolau B.J. Meinke D. Plant Physiol. 2008; 146: 60-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and peroxisomes are essential for embryo development (15Hu J. Aguirre M. Peto C. Alonso J. Ecker J. Chory J. Science. 2002; 297: 405-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 16Schumann U. Wanner G. Veenhuis M. Schmid M. Gietl C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Plant Physiol. 2005; 139: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These similarities in the fungal and plant phenotypes indicate that plant embryo lethality due to peroxisomal deficiency may be partially or entirely attributed to biotin auxotrophy. Consistently, RT-PCR analysis revealed that the A. oryzae AobioF gene was up-regulated after germination compared with conidia (supplemental Fig. S9), and the expression level of A. thaliana AtbioF gene is significantly higher in embryo than in other tissues (supplemental Fig. S10). These data support the idea that the BioF protein is important for early developmental stages in filamentous fungi and plants. For example, biotin is incorporated into a number of biotin-dependent carboxylases, such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC1), which is essential for embryo development in plants (45Baud S. Guyon V. Kronenberger J. Wuillème S. Miquel M. Caboche M. Lepiniec L. Rochat C. Plant J. 2003; 33: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In fungi deletion of the ACC1 gene is lethal (46Hasslacher M. Ivessa A.S. Paltauf F. Kohlwein S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10946-10952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Bailey A. Keon J. Owen J. Hargreaves J. Mol. Gen.

Important roles for biotin have also been identified in mammals, including cell signaling, gene expression, and chromatin structure (51Zempleni J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2005; 25: 175-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Taken together, biotin auxotrophy resulting from peroxisomal deficiency likely causes pleiotropic effects on many cellular processes. Peroxisomes are a multipurpose organelle with diverse functions, but they play important roles in the growth as peroxisomal deficiency causes lethal phenotypes. Our present study demonstrates the peroxisomal function in biotin biosynthesis and, concurrently, provides new evidence for the biologically important role of this organelle in eukaryotic production of an essential vitamin. In the future, our findings will focus attention on unidentified peroxisomal proteins as candidate enzymes required for biotin biosynthesis, providing clues to unknown upstream reactions of the eukaryotic biotin biosynthetic pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2064785715,"A key hallmark of the vertebrate adaptive immune system is the generation of antigen-specific antibodies from B cells. Fish are the most primitive gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates) possessing an adaptive immune system. Vaccination of rainbow trout against enteric redmouth disease (ERM) by immersion in Yersinia ruckeri bacterin confers a high degree of protection to the fish. The immune mechanisms responsible for protection may comprise both cellular and humoral elements but the role of specific immunoglobulins in this system has been questioned and not previously described. The present study demonstrates significant increase in plasma antibody titers following immersion vaccination and significantly reduced mortality during Y. ruckeri challenge. Rainbow trout were immersion-vaccinated, using either a commercial ERM vaccine (AquaVac™ ERM vet) or an experimental Y. ruckeri bacterin. Half of the trout vaccinated with AquaVac™ ERM vet received an oral booster (AquaVac™ ERM Oral vet). Sub-groups of the fish from each group were subsequently exposed to 1x109 CFU Y. ruckeri/ml either eight or twenty-six weeks post vaccination (wpv). All vaccinated groups showed 0% mortality when challenged, which was highly significant compared to the non-vaccinated controls (40 and 28% mortality eight and twenty-six weeks post vaccination (wpv), respectively) (P<0.0001). Plasma samples from all groups of vaccinated fish were taken 0, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 26 wpv. and Y. ruckeri specific IgM antibody levels were measured with ELISA. A significant increase in titers was recorded in vaccinated fish, which also showed a reduced bacteremia during challenge. In vitro plasma studies showed a significantly increased bactericidal effect of fresh plasma from vaccinated fish indicating that plasma proteins may play a role in protection of vaccinated rainbow trout."
https://openalex.org/W1987283016,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a degenerative disorder affecting skeletal and cardiac muscle for which there is no effective therapy. Angiotension receptor blockade (ARB) has excellent therapeutic potential in DMD based on recent data demonstrating attenuation of skeletal muscle disease progression during 6–9 months of therapy in the mdx mouse model of DMD. Since cardiac-related death is major cause of mortality in DMD, it is important to evaluate the effect of any novel treatment on the heart. Therefore, we evaluated the long-term impact of ARB on both the skeletal muscle and cardiac phenotype of the mdx mouse. Mdx mice received either losartan (0.6 g/L) (n = 8) or standard drinking water (n = 9) for two years, after which echocardiography was performed to assess cardiac function. Skeletal muscle weight, morphology, and function were assessed. Fibrosis was evaluated in the diaphragm and heart by Trichrome stain and by determination of tissue hydroxyproline content. By the study endpoint, 88% of treated mice were alive compared to only 44% of untreated (p = 0.05). No difference in skeletal muscle morphology, function, or fibrosis was noted in losartan-treated animals. Cardiac function was significantly preserved with losartan treatment, with a trend towards reduction in cardiac fibrosis. We saw no impact on the skeletal muscle disease progression, suggesting that other pathways that trigger fibrosis dominate over angiotensin II in skeletal muscle long term, unlike the situation in the heart. Our study suggests that ARB may be an important prophylactic treatment for DMD-associated cardiomyopathy, but will not impact skeletal muscle disease."

However, the mechanism and reason underlying this up-regulation are still unknown. Recently, we reported that the H1R expression level is strongly correlated with the severity of allergic symptoms. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of this up-regulation will help to develop new anti-allergic drugs targeted for H1R gene expression. Here we studied the molecular mechanism of H1R up-regulation in HeLa cells that express H1R endogenously in response to histamine and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). In HeLa cells, histamine stimulation caused up-regulation of H1R gene expression. Rottlerin, a PKCδ-selective inhibitor, inhibited up-regulation of H1R gene expression, but Go6976, an inhibitor of Ca2+-dependent PKCs, did not. Histamine or PMA stimulation resulted in PKCδ phosphorylation at Tyr311 and Thr505. Activation of PKCδ by H2O2 resulted in H1R mRNA up-regulation. Overexpression of PKCδ enhanced up-regulation of H1R gene expression, and knockdown of the PKCδ gene suppressed this up-regulation. Histamine or PMA caused translocation PKCδ from the cytosol to the Golgi. U0126, an MEK inhibitor, and DPQ, a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 inhibitor, suppressed PMA-induced up-regulation of H1R gene expression. These results were confirmed by a luciferase assay using the H1R promoter. Phosphorylation of ERK and Raf-1 in response to PMA was also observed. However, real-time PCR analysis showed no inhibition of H1R mRNA up-regulation by a Raf-1 inhibitor.

https://openalex.org/W2022226947,"Autoimmune associated congenital heart block (CHB) may result from pathogenic cross-talk between inflammatory and profibrosing pathways. Incubation of macrophages with immune complexes (IC) composed of Ro60, a target of the pathologic maternal autoantibodies necessary for CHB, hY3 ssRNA, and affinity-purified anti-Ro60 antibody induces the Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7)-dependent generation of supernatants that provoke a fibrosing phenotype in human fetal cardiac fibroblasts. We show herein that these cells are a major source of TGFβ and that endothelin-1 (ET-1) is one of the key components responsible for the profibrosing effects generated by stimulated macrophages. Supernatants from macrophages incubated with IC induced the fibroblast secretion of TGFβ, which was inhibited by treating the macrophages with an antagonist of TLR7. Under the same conditions, the induced fibroblast secretion of TGFβ was decreased by inhibitors of the ET-1 receptors ETa or ETb or by an anti-ET-1 antibody but not by an isotype control. Exogenous ET-1 induced a profibrosing phenotype, whereas fibroblasts transfected with either ETa or ETb siRNA were unresponsive to the profibrosing effects of the IC-generated macrophage supernatants. Immunohistochemistry of the hearts from two fetuses dying with CHB revealed the presence of ET-1-producing mononuclear cells in the septal region in areas of calcification and fibrosis. In conclusion, these data support a novel role of ET-1 in linking TLR7 inflammatory signaling to subsequent fibrosis and provide new insight in considering therapeutics for CHB."
https://openalex.org/W2015876774,"We examined the effect of rate on finger kinematics in goal-directed actions of pianists. In addition, we evaluated whether movement kinematics can be treated as an indicator of personal identity. Pianists' finger movements were recorded with a motion capture system while they performed melodies from memory at different rates. Pianists' peak finger heights above the keys preceding keystrokes increased as tempo increased, and were attained about one tone before keypress. These rate effects were not simply due to a strategy to increase key velocity (associated with tone intensity) of the corresponding keystroke. Greater finger heights may compensate via greater tactile feedback for a speed-accuracy tradeoff that underlies the tendency toward larger temporal variability at faster tempi. This would allow pianists to maintain high temporal accuracy when playing at fast rates. In addition, finger velocity and accelerations as pianists' fingers approached keys were sufficiently unique to allow pianists' identification with a neural-network classifier. Classification success was higher in pianists with more extensive musical training. Pianists' movement “signatures” may reflect unique goal-directed movement kinematic patterns, leading to individualistic sound."

This comprises layers of two specialised cells, glomerular endothelial cells (GEnC) and podocytes, separated by a basement membrane. Glomerular filtration barrier function, and dysfunction in disease, remains incompletely understood, partly due to difficulties in studying the relevant cell types in vitro. We have addressed this by generation of unique conditionally immortalised human GEnC and podocytes. However, because the glomerular filtration barrier functions as a whole, it is necessary to develop three dimensional co-culture models to maximise the benefit of the availability of these cells. Here we have developed the first two tri-layer models of the glomerular capillary wall. The first is based on tissue culture inserts and provides evidence of cell-cell interaction via soluble mediators. In the second model the synthetic support of the tissue culture insert is replaced with a novel composite bioartificial membrane. This consists of a nanofibre membrane containing collagen I, electrospun directly onto a micro-photoelectroformed fine nickel supporting mesh. GEnC and podocytes grew in monolayers on either side of the insert support or the novel membrane to form a tri-layer model recapitulating the human glomerular capillary in vitro. These models will advance the study of both the physiology of normal glomerular filtration and of its disruption in glomerular disease."

https://openalex.org/W2009878798,"Syndecans are proteoglycans whose core proteins have a short cytoplasmic domain, a transmembrane domain and a large N-terminal extracellular domain possessing glycosaminoglycan chains. Syndecans are involved in many important cellular processes. Our recent publications have demonstrated that syndecan-1 translocates into the nucleus and hampers tumor cell proliferation. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the role of syndecan-1 in tumor cell adhesion and migration, with special focus on the importance of its distinct protein domains, to better understand the structure-function relationship of syndecan-1 in tumor progression.We utilized two mesenchymal tumor cell lines which were transfected to stably overexpress full-length syndecan-1 or truncated variants: the 78 which lacks the extracellular domain except the DRKE sequence proposed to be essential for oligomerization, the 77 which lacks the whole extracellular domain, and the RMKKK which serves as a nuclear localization signal. The deletion of the RMKKK motif from full-length syndecan-1 abolished the nuclear translocation of this proteoglycan. Various bioassays for cell adhesion, chemotaxis, random movement and wound healing were studied. Furthermore, we performed gene microarray to analyze the global gene expression pattern influenced by syndecan-1. Both full-length and truncated syndecan-1 constructs decrease tumor cell migration and motility, and affect cell adhesion. Distinct protein domains have differential effects, the extracellular domain is more important for promoting cell adhesion, while the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains are sufficient for inhibition of cell migration. Cell behavior seems to depend also on the nuclear translocation of syndecan-1. Many genes are differentially regulated by syndecan-1 and a number of genes are actually involved in cell adhesion and migration.Our results demonstrate that syndecan-1 regulates mesenchymal tumor cell adhesion and migration, and different domains have differential effects. Our study provides new insights into better understanding of the role of syndecans in tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2052224433,"IQGAP1 is a large modular protein that displays multiple partnership and is thought to act as a scaffold in coupling cell signaling to the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons in cell migration, adhesion, and cytokinesis. However the molecular mechanisms underlying the activities of IQGAP1 are poorly understood in part because of its large size, poor solubility and lack of functional assays to challenge biochemical properties in various contexts. We have purified bacterially expressed recombinant human IQGAP1. The protein binds Cdc42, Rac1, and the CRIB domain of N-WASP in a calmodulin-sensitive fashion. We further show that in addition to bundling of filaments via a single N-terminal calponin-homology domain, IQGAP1 actually regulates actin assembly. It caps barbed ends, with a higher affinity for ADP-bound terminal subunits (K(B) = 4 nM). The barbed end capping activity is inhibited by calmodulin, consistent with calmodulin binding to IQGAP1 with a K(C) of 40 nm, both in the absence and presence of Ca(2+) ions. The barbed end capping activity resides in the C-terminal half of IQGAP1. It is possible that the capping activity of IQGAP1 accounts for its stimulation of cell migration. We further find that bacterially expressed recombinant IQGAP1 fragments easily co-purify with nucleic acids that turn out to activate N-WASP protein to branch filaments with Arp2/3 complex. The present results open perspectives for tackling the function of IQGAP1 in more complex reconstituted systems."

Its advantage is that it is performed in a real-time PCR device, and the PCR amplification and HRM analysis are closed tube, and effectively single step. We have developed an HRM-based method for Staphylococcus aureus genotyping. Eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were derived from the S. aureus multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) database on the basis of maximized Simpson's Index of Diversity. Only G↔A, G↔T, C↔A, C↔T SNPs were considered for inclusion, to facilitate allele discrimination by HRM. In silico experiments revealed that DNA fragments incorporating the SNPs give much higher resolving power than randomly selected fragments. It was shown that the predicted optimum fragment size for HRM analysis was 200 bp, and that other SNPs within the fragments contribute to the resolving power. Six DNA fragments ranging from 83 bp to 219 bp, incorporating the resolution optimized SNPs were designed. HRM analysis of these fragments using 94 diverse S. aureus isolates of known sequence type or clonal complex (CC) revealed that sequence variants are resolved largely in accordance with G+C content. A combination of experimental results and in silico prediction indicates that HRM analysis resolves S. aureus into 268 “melt types” (MelTs), and provides a Simpson's Index of Diversity of 0.978 with respect to MLST. There is a high concordance between HRM analysis and the MLST defined CCs. We have generated a Microsoft Excel key which facilitates data interpretation and translation between MelT and MLST data. The potential of this approach for genotyping other bacterial pathogens was investigated using a computerized approach to estimate the densities of SNPs with unlinked allelic states. The MLST databases for all species tested contained abundant unlinked SNPs, thus suggesting that high resolving power is not dependent upon large numbers of SNPs."
https://openalex.org/W1974170967,"Background A great deal of experimental research supports strong associations between exercise, cognition, neurogenesis and neuroprotection in mammals. Much of this work has focused on neurogenesis in individual subjects in a limited number of species. However, no study to date has examined the relationship between exercise and neurobiology across a wide range of mammalian taxa. It is possible that exercise and neurobiology are related across evolutionary time. To test this hypothesis, this study examines the association between exercise and brain size across a wide range of mammals. Methodology/Principal Findings Controlling for associations with body size, we examined the correlation between brain size and a proxy for exercise frequency and capacity, maximum metabolic rate (MMR; ml O2 min−1). We collected brain sizes and MMRs from the literature and calculated residuals from the least-squares regression line describing the relationship between body mass and each variable of interest. We then analyzed the correlation between residual brain size and residual MMR both before and after controlling for phylogeny using phylogenetic independent contrasts. We found a significant positive correlation between maximum metabolic rate and brain size across a wide range of taxa. Conclusions These results suggest a novel hypothesis that links brain size to the evolution of locomotor behaviors in a wide variety of mammalian species. In the end, we suggest that some portion of brain size in nonhuman mammals may have evolved in conjunction with increases in exercise capacity rather than solely in response to selection related to cognitive abilities."
https://openalex.org/W2082661443,"Depolarization of nerve terminals stimulates rapid dephosphorylation of two isoforms of dynamin I (dynI), mediated by the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (CaN). Dephosphorylation at the major phosphorylation sites Ser-774/778 promotes a dynI-syndapin I interaction for a specific mode of synaptic vesicle endocytosis called activity-dependent bulk endocytosis (ADBE). DynI has two main splice variants at its extreme C terminus, long or short (dynIxa and dynIxb) varying only by 20 (xa) or 7 (xb) residues. Recombinant GST fusion proteins of dynIxa and dynIxb proline-rich domains (PRDs) were used to pull down interacting proteins from rat brain nerve terminals. Both bound equally to syndapin, but dynIxb PRD exclusively bound to the catalytic subunit of CaNA, which recruited CaNB. Binding of CaN was increased in the presence of calcium and was accompanied by further recruitment of calmodulin. Point mutations showed that the entire C terminus of dynIxb is a CaN docking site related to a conserved CaN docking motif (PXIXI(T/S)). This sequence is unique to dynIxb among all other dynamin variants or genes. Peptide mimetics of the dynIxb tail blocked CaN binding in vitro and selectively inhibited depolarization-evoked dynI dephosphorylation in nerve terminals but not of other dephosphins. Therefore, docking to dynIxb is required for the regulation of both dynI splice variants, yet it does not regulate the phosphorylation cycle of other dephosphins. The peptide blocked ADBE, but not clathrin-mediated endocytosis of synaptic vesicles. Our results indicate that Ca2+ influx regulates assembly of a fully active CaN-calmodulin complex selectively on the tail of dynIxb and that the complex is recruited to sites of ADBE in nerve terminals.

The dynamins are a superfamily of up to seven cellular GTPase enzymes, which each play a role in membrane fission or fusion (1Anggono V. Robinson P.J. Squire L.R. Encyclopedia of Neuroscience. Academic Press, Inc., Oxford2009Google Scholar). There are three “classical dynamins,” dynI, 2The abbreviations used are: dyndynaminSVsynaptic vesicleCaNcalcineurinCaMcalmodulinPRDproline-rich domainSH3Src homology 3ADBEactivity-dependent bulk endocytosisCMEclathrin-mediated endocytosisTESN-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acidBEbulk endosomeNFATnuclear factor of activated T cells. -II, and -III, which mediate the internal fission of vesicles from cell membranes. The neuronal isoform of dynamin, dynI, is essential for all forms of synaptic vesicle (SV) endocytosis in central nerve terminals (2Newton A.J. Kirchhausen T. Murthy V.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Neurosci. 2009; 29: 7706-7717Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). At least three different SV endocytosis modes are proposed to exist in nerve terminals. The kiss-and run mode has no defining biochemical or morphological markers, and thus its existence is still a matter of controversy (4Zhang Q. Li Y. Tsien R.W. Science. 2009; 323: 1448-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) retrieves single SVs from the plasma membrane and is the dominant endocytosis mode during mild stimulation (5Granseth B. Odermatt B. Royle S.J. Lagnado L. Neuron. 2006; 51: 773-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). In contrast, activity-dependent bulk endocytosis (ADBE) invaginates large areas of plasma membrane to form bulk endosomes (BEs) from which SVs can later bud and rejoin the recycling pool (6Clayton E.L.

ADBE is only triggered during high intensity stimulation and is the dominant SV endocytosis mode under these conditions (8Clayton E.L. Evans G.J. Cousin M.A. J.

Cousin M.A. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 7706-7717Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, ADBE is additionally reliant on the dephosphorylation and rephosphorylation of dynI (3Clayton E.L.

DynI is the founding member of a group of endocytic proteins called the dephosphins that are dephosphorylated by the Ca2+- and calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin (CaN, or protein phosphatase 2B) upon nerve terminal depolarization (14LaPointe M.C.

Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 659-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). CaN is the only protein phosphatase directly regulated by Ca2+ and calmodulin (18Klee C.B. Ren H. Wang X.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13367-13370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 19Rusnak F. Mertz P. Physiol.

It is a heterodimer of a 60-kDa catalytic subunit, CaNA, and a 19-kDa regulatory subunit, CaNB. DynI interacts directly with CaN in a strictly Ca2+-dependent manner via its PRD (21Lai M.M. Hong J.J.

Dwivedi M. Cho J.H. Park B.J. Ahnn J. Mol. Cells. 2010; 30: 255-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar); however, no functional role has been identified for this interaction. In contrast, the activity-dependent dephosphorylation of dynI by CaN is essential for the triggering of ADBE. DynI dephosphorylation permits its association with syndapin I, a protein that is essential for ADBE but not CME (3Clayton E.L. Anggono V. Smillie K.J. Chau N. Robinson P.J. Cousin M.A. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 7706-7717Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 23Anggono V. Smillie K.J. Graham M.E. Valova V.A. Cousin M.A. Robinson P.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 752-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Thus, CaN activity is required to trigger ADBE in central neurons to increase endocytic capacity under periods of unusually intense activity. DynI is a modular protein, containing an N-terminal GTPase, middle, GTPase effector, pleckstrin homology domain, and proline-rich domain (PRD). The dynI PRD is located at the C terminus, which is the main site of phosphorylation and an interaction platform for a variety of Src homology 3 (SH3) domains from other proteins. Rat dynI has three sites for alternative splicing that produce up to eight mRNAs (UniProtKB accession number P21575) (24Cao H. Garcia F. McNiven M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2595-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar); however, there is limited understanding of the functional roles of these splice variants in neurons (25Robinson P.J. Sontag J.M. Liu J.P. Fykse E.M. Slaughter C. McMahon H. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 365: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 26Ruiz-Velasco V. Zhong J. Hume J.R. Keef K.D. Circ.

The dynI third splice site produces three alternative C-terminal tails beginning at residue 845, dynIxa (long), dynIxb (short), or dynIxd (intermediate). The two major spliced tails (xa and xb) have an approximate ratio of 5:4 (xa/ (xb + xd)) in nerve terminals, with dynIxd expression being ∼10% of the others (27Chan L.S. Hansra G. Robinson P.J. Graham M.E. J. Proteome Res. 2010; 9: 4028-4037Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). DynIxa has a unique 20-residue tail after Pro-844, 844PSRSGQASPSRPESPRPPFDL864, which includes several potential additional binding sites for SH3 domain-containing proteins. In contrast, the unique 7-residue tail of dynIxb, 844PRITISDP851, does not. Both dynIxa and dynIxb are phosphorylated and dephosphorylated upon electrical or chemical depolarization to approximately equal extents using metabolic 32Pi labeling, suggesting that they are coordinately regulated (28Robinson P.J. Dunkley P.R. J. Neurochem. 1985; 44: 338-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, quantitative mass spectrometry (which also detects unlabeled phosphorylation sites) revealed major differences in the distribution of phosphate between these sites in the dynIxa and dynIxb (27Chan L.S. Hansra G. Robinson P.J. Graham M.E. J. Proteome Res. 2010; 9: 4028-4037Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of alternative binding platforms and differential phosphorylation of key sites supports the hypothesis that these dynI splice variants may have unique functional roles in nerve terminals. To date, the only reported differences between any of the endogenously expressed dynI isoforms is a differential phosphoregulation of dynIxa in synaptosomes (27Chan L.S. Hansra G. Robinson P.J. Graham M.E. J. Proteome Res. 2010; 9: 4028-4037Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 29Graham M.E. Anggono V. Bache N. Larsen M.R. Craft G.E. Robinson P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 14695-14707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). DynI is phosphorylated at seven sites in nerve terminals, with the majority (69%) of metabolic labeling with 32Pi occurring on Ser-774 and Ser-778 in a region of the PRD called the phospho-box (13Clayton E.L. Sue N. Smillie K.J. O'Leary T. Bache N. Cheung G. Cole A.R. Wyllie D.J. Sutherland C. Robinson P.J. Cousin M.A. Nat.

Chem. 2007; 282: 14695-14707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, two additional phosphosites in nerve terminals are unique for dynIxa, Ser-851 and Ser-857 (29Graham M.E. Anggono V. Bache N. Larsen M.R. Craft G.E. Robinson P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 14695-14707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Among these two sites, Ser-857 is phosphorylated by Dyrk 1A/minibrain kinase in vitro, and this appears to affect amphiphysin I binding to this isoform (30Chen-Hwang M.C. Chen H.R. Elzinga M.

In an attempt to uncover different roles for different dynI splice variants in nerve terminals, we searched for protein partners whose interaction may be specific for either dynIxa or dynIxb. We report here that CaN uniquely associates with the short (xb) tail and not with the long (xa) tail of dynI. We characterized the dynIxb-CaN interaction, mapped the binding site, and found that the interaction was associated with a specific endocytic mode, ADBE. Our results support the model whereby dynI dephosphorylation by CaN is the primary trigger for ADBE, leading to the formation of a dynI-syndapin I complex as the next step in the process. Leupeptin was from Merck. Tissue culture plastics were from Falcon (Franklin Lakes, NJ). Tetramethylrhodamine-dextran, penicillin/streptomycin, phosphate-buffered saline, minimal essential medium, and fetal calf serum were from Invitrogen. All other materials were from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Antibodies to PP2B-A (CaN-A), PP2B-B (CaN-B), amphiphysin I, and syndapin I were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); antibodies to dynI (hudy1) or calmodulin were from Millipore; and secondary antibodies were all from Dako. Three penetratin-based peptides, RRMKWKK-GVPRITISDP (short peptide), RRMKWKK-GVARATASDP (mutant short peptide), and RRMKWKK-GVPSRSGQASPSRPESPRPPFDL (long peptide), were synthesized by Auspep (Parkville, Australia). The pBJ5mCaNB (mouse, plasmid 17872), pBJ5-CaNA (mouse, plasmid 11785), and pGEX-CaNA(2–347) (human, plasmid 13251) plasmids were from Addgene Inc. GST-tagged dynIxa PRD plasmid (long tail, rat, amino acids 746–864) was constructed into pGEX-4T-1 by subcloning the coding region from GFP-tagged dynIaa (23Anggono V. Smillie K.J. Graham M.E. Valova V.A. Cousin M.A. Robinson P.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 752-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The sequence encoding the dynIxb PRD (short tail, rat sequence, amino acids 746–851) was amplified from dynIab in pCR3.1 expression vector (24Cao H. Garcia F. McNiven M.A. Mol. Biol.

Point mutants in dynIxb PRD were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The plasmid expressing GST-amphiphysin I SH3 domain (human, amino acids 545–695) was as previously reported (23Anggono V. Smillie K.J. Graham M.E. Valova V.A. Cousin M.A. Robinson P.J. Nat.

GST constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli JM109 by heat shock, and expressed recombinant proteins bound to glutathione (GSH)-Sepharose beads were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cloning and expression of His6-syndapin 1-FL was as described previously (33Rao Y. Ma Q. Vahedi-Faridi A. Sundborger A. Pechstein A. Puchkov D. Luo L. Shupliakov O. Saenger W. Haucke V. Proc. Natl.

The homogenate was centrifuged at 75,600 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The extract was precleared with GSH-Sepharose beads for 1 h and then incubated with the GSH-Sepharose beads coated with GST recombinant proteins at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were isolated and washed extensively with ice-cold lysis buffer and eluted in 2× concentrated SDS sample buffer. Bound proteins were separated by 7.5–15% gradient SDS-PAGE and stained with colloidal Coomassie Blue. Protein bands were then excised from gels and identified by LC-MS/MS (QSTAR XL mass spectrometer, AB SCIEX) and searched against protein databases as described (27Chan L.S. Hansra G. Robinson P.J. Graham M.E. J. Proteome Res. 2010; 9: 4028-4037Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). See supplemental Table 1 for more details. P2 synaptosomes were prepared from adult rat brains and labeled with 0.75 mCi/ml 32Pi for 1 h at 37 °C in a low calcium Krebs-like buffer (118.5 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.18 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm K2HPO4, 20 mm Hepes, 10 mm glucose, with 0.1 mm calcium, pH 7.4) and washed (25Robinson P.J. Sontag J.M. Liu J.P. Fykse E.M. Slaughter C. McMahon H. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 365: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In some experiments, the synaptosomes were depolarized by the addition of KCl to 41 mm for 10 s, were immediately lysed in ice cold lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm PMSF, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture), and were centrifuged at 20,442 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Pull-down experiments were performed sequentially. First, the GST-amphiphysin I-SH3 domain on GSH-Sepharose beads was used to pull down dynI and synaptojanin from the lysate. Then GST-α-adaptin ear domain on GSH-Sepharose beads was used in a subsequent pull-down from the same lysate to isolate AP180 and amphiphysin. The washed beads were heated in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and proteins were resolved on SDS gels and subjected to autoradiography. Densitometry was performed on storage phosphor screens scanned with a Typhoon TRIO imager, and phosphorylation was quantified with ImageQuant TL software (GE Healthcare). Primary cultures of cerebellar granule neurons were prepared from the cerebella of 7-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat pups as described previously (34Tan T.C. Valova V.A. Malladi C.S. Graham M.E. Berven L.A. Jupp O.J. Hansra G. McClure S.J. Sarcevic B. Boadle R.A. Larsen M.R. Cousin M.A. Robinson P.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Cultures were processed for electron microscopy as described previously (3Clayton E.L. Anggono V. Smillie K.J. Chau N. Robinson P.J. Cousin M.A. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 7706-7717Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cultures were removed into incubation medium (170 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm KCl, 0.4 mm KH2PO4, 20 mm TES, 5 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm glucose, 1.2 mm Na2SO4, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1.3 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) and after 10 min were incubated with short (xb) peptide (30 or 60 μm) for a further 15 min. Cultures were then stimulated with 800 action potentials (delivered at 80 Hz, 1-ms pulse width) in incubation medium supplemented with horseradish peroxidase (HRP; 10 mg/ml) and peptide where indicated. This stimulation protocol activates both CME and ADBE (8Clayton E.L. Evans G.J. Cousin M.A. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 6627-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Neurons were then immediately fixed in a 2% solution of glutaraldehyde in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, cultures were exposed to 0.1% diaminobenzidine and 0.2% H2O2 in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4. Upon development of color, cultures were washed with 100 mm Tris and then postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide for 30 min. After washing, cultures were poststained with 2% uranyl acetate for 15 min and then dehydrated using an ethanol series and polypropylene oxide and then embedded using Durcupan. Samples were sectioned, mounted on grids, and viewed using an FEI (Hillsboro, OR) Tecnai 12 transmission electron microscope. Intracellular structures that were <100 nm in diameter were arbitrarily designated to be SVs, whereas larger structures were designated to be endosomes. All experiments were performed on cultures between 8 and 10 days in vitro. For transfection of CaNA or CaNB into mammalian cells, COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and the transfection reagent was FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). The uptake of tetramethylrhodamine-dextran (40 kDa, 50 μm) was monitored as described previously (3Clayton E.L. Anggono V. Smillie K.J. Chau N. Robinson P.J. Cousin M.A. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 7706-7717Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) in cells stimulated with a train of 800 action potentials (80 Hz, 10 s). Where indicated, cultures were incubated with 60 μm xb peptide for 15 min before and during stimulation. Dextran loading was determined by the number of fluorescent puncta in a defined field of view (130 × 130 μm) using a ×20 air objective at 550-nm excitation and >575-nm emission. Thresholding analysis was performed to discount regions too large to represent individual nerve terminals (diameter greater than 2 μm). The average number of dextran puncta/field for each experiment (usually 10 fields of view/experiment) were averaged for the same conditions. Experiments were performed across multiple culture preparations; however, to ensure that the density of nerve terminals was consistent between fields and experimental conditions, for each set of cultures, every experimental condition was performed (between 8–10 days in vitro). DynIxa and dynIxb differ in the amino acid sequences of their alternatively spliced tails (Fig. 1A) (24Cao H. Garcia F. McNiven M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2595-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 25Robinson P.J. Sontag J.M. Liu J.P. Fykse E.M. Slaughter C. McMahon H. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 365: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). To search for potential isoform-selective binding partners for the two tails, both PRDs were expressed as GST fusion proteins bound to GSH-Sepharose beads and incubated with rat brain synaptosomal lysate for pull-down experiments. Proteins at about 58 and 19 kDa selectively associated with one form, dynIxb PRD (Fig. 1, B and C). The 58-kDa protein was unequivocally identified by LC-MS/MS sequencing as the catalytic subunit of the serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2B (CaN), also known as CaNA, and the 19-kDa protein was identified as the regulatory subunit of calcineurin, CaNB. The 58-kDa protein had 19 matching peptides with 38% sequence coverage of CaNA α isoform 1 and 10 matching peptides with 36% sequence coverage of CaNA α isoform 2 (supplemental Table 1). It also had eight matching peptides with 20% sequence coverage of CaNA β isoform, three peptides being unique to the β not α isoform (supplemental Table 1). Therefore, both CaNA α and β forms were unequivocally detected. The 19-kDa protein revealed seven matching peptides with 53% sequence coverage of CaNB, matching both known isoforms 1 and 2 (supplemental Table 2). The identity of these proteins as CaNA and CaNB was independently confirmed by Western blotting with specific antibodies (Fig. 1D). The blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-amphiphysin I antibodies, and amphiphysin I was found to bind to xa and xb to about the same extent (Fig. 1D). The results show that both CaNA and CaNB specifically interact with the short dynIxb splice variant but do not yet reveal which is the primary contact. We next explored the potential Ca2+ dependence of this interaction. In the presence of 200 μm Ca2+, both CaNA and CaNB increased binding to the dynIxb PRD (Fig. 1E and supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). Interestingly, an additional band at 21 kDa was also detected in the Coomassie-stained gel, binding specifically to dynIxb PRD (supplemental Fig. S1B). LC-MS/MS clearly identified six tryptic peptides with 50% sequence coverage of calmodulin (CaM) (supplemental Table 3). This was confirmed by immunoblot analysis with specific anti-CaM antibodies, which also revealed that CaM bound to the dynIxb-CaN complex only in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 1E, bottom). Because CaNA and CaNB are known to be a complex, we asked which is the primary contact with dynIxb. We transfected CaNA or CaNB, or we cotransfected both, into COS7 cells. The cell lysates were incubated with GST-dynIxb PRD on GSH-Sepharose beads. Western blots showed that CaNA directly associated with dynIxb PRD (Fig. 1F, top), whereas CaNB did not bind alone, but bound dynIxb through CaNA (Fig. 1F, bottom). The amount of CaNA bound to the dynIxb PRD in the presence of various concentrations of Ca2+ was further explored by Western blot, and the level of bound CaNA was quantified by densitometry. Maximal binding of CaNA to dynIxb PRD occurred at about 1 μm free Ca2+, with an estimated EC50 for Ca2+ of 0.1 μm (Fig. 1G). This result is consistent with the previously reported binding of dynI to CaN for calcium (EC50 in the range of 0.1–0.4 μm (21Lai M.M. Hong J.J. Ruggiero A.M. Burnett P.E. Slepnev V.I. De Camilli P. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25963-25966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar)). This affinity was similar to the in vitro affinity of CaN for calcium (Kd value is less than 1 μm (35Klee C.B. Crouch T.H. Krinks M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1979; 76: 6270-6273Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar)). The results show that it is the catalytic subunit that interacts with dynIxb and that it has a high degree of constitutive binding. To characterize dynIxb-CaNA binding, we used dynII PRD to pull down proteins from synaptosomal lysates. Note that there is only one known C-terminal tail for dynII, and its amino acid sequence is more similar to that of dynIxa. No CaNA was detected by immunoblot on dynII PRD (Fig. 2A). We also used GST-CaNA(2–347)-coated GSH-Sepharose beads to pull down its binding partners from synaptosomal lysate. The main Coomassie protein band found to bind GST-CaNA(2–347) comigrated on gels with the short form of dynI (dynIxb) (Fig. 2B, note the lower band of the doublet), whereas in contrast, GST-AmpI-SH3 is known to associate with dynI splice variants, including dynIxa, dynIxb, and dynIxd (27Chan L.S. Hansra G. Robinson P.J. Graham M.E. J. Proteome Res. 2010; 9: 4028-4037Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry analysis of the main band confirmed that CaNA binds dynIxb with considerable specificity (data not shown). Due to the sensitivity provided by mass spectrometry analysis, both dynIxa (in the upper band) and dynIxd (in both upper and lower bands) were detected, but not dynIxc. Considerably less Coomassie protein stain was detected for dynIxa (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2 versus lanes 3 and 4, upper band), despite the fact that dynamin family members are well known to dimerize with each other (36Okamoto P.M. Tripet B. Litowski J. Hodges R.S. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10277-10286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It was not possible to quantify changes in dynIxd binding, but like dynIxa, it has no specific sequence motif to indicate that it might interact with CaNA directly rather than indirectly via dynIxb. These results suggest that CaNA specifically interacts with the 7-amino acid tail that is unique to dynIxb. Our next aim was to identify the binding site for CaN in the short dynIxb variant. Inspection of the dynIxb tail sequence (PRITISDP) revealed a strong similarity to the conserved CaN docking motif PXIXI(T/S) (37Aramburu J. Garcia"
https://openalex.org/W2160995250,"The TNF family ligand ectodysplasin A (EDA) and its receptor EDAR are required for proper development of skin appendages such as hair, teeth, and eccrine sweat glands. Loss of function mutations in the Eda gene cause X-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (XLHED), a condition that can be ameliorated in mice and dogs by timely administration of recombinant EDA. In this study, several agonist anti-EDAR monoclonal antibodies were generated that cross-react with the extracellular domains of human, dog, rat, mouse, and chicken EDAR. Their half-life in adult mice was about 11 days. They induced tail hair and sweat gland formation when administered to newborn EDA-deficient Tabby mice, with an EC(50) of 0.1 to 0.7 mg/kg. Divalency was necessary and sufficient for this therapeutic activity. Only some antibodies were also agonists in an in vitro surrogate activity assay based on the activation of the apoptotic Fas pathway. Activity in this assay correlated with small dissociation constants. When administered in utero in mice or at birth in dogs, agonist antibodies reverted several ectodermal dysplasia features, including tooth morphology. These antibodies are therefore predicted to efficiently trigger EDAR signaling in many vertebrate species and will be particularly suited for long term treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2063038722,"Insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) is responsible for the metabolism of insulin and plays a role in clearance of the Aβ peptide associated with Alzheimer's disease. Unlike most proteolytic enzymes, IDE, which consists of four structurally related domains and exists primarily as a dimer, exhibits allosteric kinetics, being activated by both small substrate peptides and polyphosphates such as ATP.The crystal structure of a catalytically compromised mutant of IDE has electron density for peptide ligands bound at the active site in domain 1 and a distal site in domain 2. Mutating residues in the distal site eliminates allosteric kinetics and activation by a small peptide, as well as greatly reducing activation by ATP, demonstrating that this site plays a key role in allostery. Comparison of the peptide bound IDE structure (using a low activity E111F IDE mutant) with unliganded wild type IDE shows a change in the interface between two halves of the clamshell-like molecule, which may enhance enzyme activity by altering the equilibrium between closed and open conformations. In addition, changes in the dimer interface suggest a basis for communication between subunits.Our findings indicate that a region remote from the active site mediates allosteric activation of insulysin by peptides. Activation may involve a small conformational change that weakens the interface between two halves of the enzyme."

Through a combination of mutagenesis, chemical modification, substrate and charge flux measurements, and molecular modeling studies, we reveal an unexpected role for the highly conserved transmembrane segment 1 residue Asn-101 in coupling Cl− binding to concentrative neurotransmitter uptake. Na+- and Cl−-dependent uptake of neurotransmitters via transporters of the SLC6 family, including the human serotonin transporter (SLC6A4), is critical for efficient synaptic transmission.

Chemical signaling by neurotransmitters in the nervous system depends upon the opposing mechanisms of vesicular release and transporter-mediated neurotransmitter clearance (1Kanner B.I. Schuldiner S. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 22: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). In humans, two gene families, designated SLC1 and SLC6, compose the majority of transporters responsible for neurotransmitter inactivation (2Ramamoorthy S. Bauman A.L. Moore K.R. Han H. Yang-Feng T.

Whereas the SLC1 family encodes multiple transporters that inactivate the brain's predominant excitatory neurotransmitter, l-glutamate, the SLC6 gene family includes transporters that clear the brain's major inhibitory neurotransmitters, γ-aminobutyric acid and glycine, as well as transporters for the neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine (NE), 6The abbreviations used are: NEnorepinephrine5-HT5-hydroxytryptaminehSERThuman serotonin transporterrSERTrat serotonin transporterMTSmethanethiosulfonateMTSET2-(trimethylammonium) ethyl methanethiosulfonate bromideMTSEA2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate hydrobromideTMtransmembrane segmentELextracellular loopMDmolecular dynamics simulationsFEPfree energy perturbationANOVAanalysis of varianceTEVCtwo-electrode voltage clampNMDG-ClN-methyl-d-glucamine-HCl. and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT). The human 5-HT transporter (SLC6A4, hSERT) is of particular clinical significance, being a target for psychostimulants, including cocaine and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (“ecstasy”), as well as the site of action for widely prescribed 5-HT selective reuptake inhibitors (5Barker E.L.

Nature. 1961; 191: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (2924) Google Scholar), coupling the concentrative movement of neurotransmitter to the transmembrane gradients of Na+ and other ions (7Rudnick G. Quick M.W. Transmembrane Transporters. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York2002: 125-141Crossref Google Scholar). A distinguishing feature of neurotransmitter transport by the SLC6 family relative to the SLC1 family is a strong dependence on extracellular Cl− for transport (8Nelson M.T. Blaustein M.P. J. Membr. Biol. 1982; 69: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 9Lingjaerde Jr., O. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1971; 81: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). During a single cycle of substrate transport in hSERT, a stoichiometry of 1-5-HTin+:1-Nain+:1-Clin−:1-Kout+ has been advanced on the basis of ion dependence studies in cells and resealed membrane vesicles that predicts an overall electroneutral coupling mechanism. Such studies have led to the belief that the energy stored in the Cl− concentration gradient contributes directly to transmembrane 5-HT flux (7Rudnick G. Quick M.W. Transmembrane Transporters.

For the hSERT homolog dopamine transporter, Cl− has been implicated as a charge carrier in nonstoichiometric flux states, (14Carvelli L. McDonald P.W. Blakely R.D. Defelice L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Together these findings indicate that the contribution of Cl− to neurotransmitter transport deserves further investigation. Recently, high resolution structures of a Cl−-independent SLC6 family member, the leucine transporter from Aquifex aeolicus (LeuTAa) (22Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar), has afforded opportunities to elucidate details of neurotransmitter transporter ionic coupling. Although overall sequence identity between LeuTAa and neurotransmitter transporters is low, amino acid identity approaches 50% for residues surrounding the binding sites for leucine and Na+, propelling homology-guided structural studies. In addition, crystal structures of the transporters ApcT (23Shaffer P.L. Goehring A. Shankaranarayanan A. Gouaux E.

Wright E.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2009; 19: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Therefore, a model-guided study of SLC6 family members may identify important mechanisms that are likely difficult to derive from patterns of sequence conservation. In a prior study (28Henry L.K. Adkins E.M. Han Q. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37052-37063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that an asparagine (Asn-101) in hSERT transmembrane segment (TM) 1 tolerates substitution by cysteine and that cells transfected with N101C are sensitive to transport inactivation by positively charged cysteine-directed MTS reagents. Because this inactivation was largely eliminated by the presence of 5-HT, we proposed that Asn-101 might lie at or near the substrate-binding site. Here, we demonstrate that the Asn-101 residue, homologous to the sodium-coordinating residue Asn-27 in LeuTAa, contributes an important role in facilitating the coupling of Cl− to 5-HT transport. Rather than directly coordinating Cl− binding, our evidence indicates that Asn-101 translates Cl− binding to the stabilization of a TM1–TM6 interhelical network with the participation of TM6 residue Ser-336 to promote efficient coupling between 5-HT and Na+. Mutation of hSERT cDNA in pcDNA3.1 or pOTV to generate N101A, N101C, and S336C constructs in hSERT and hSERT C109A backgrounds was performed using the Stratagene QuikChange kit, as described previously (28Henry L.K. Adkins E.M. Han Q. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37052-37063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), with confirmation of all mutants by DNA sequencing (Center for Molecular Neuroscience Neurogenomics, Vanderbilt DNA Sequencing Core Facility or Northwoods DNA, Inc., Bemidji, MN). For cysteine modification studies to probe for Asn-101-sensitive conformational movements, rSERT Asn-101 mutants were generated in the background of Cys substitutions S277C and S404C using a Cys-reduced transporter (X5C; C15A/C21A/C109A/C357I/C622A). HeLa and HEK-293 cells, maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2-humidified incubator, were grown in complete medium (DMEM, 10% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). For initial evaluation of mutant transporter activity, cells were plated at a density of 50,000 cells/cm2 in 96- or 24-well culture plates. Cells were transfected with hSERT, rSERT, or hNE transporter constructs with TransIT transfection reagent (Mirus Inc., 6 μl per μg of DNA), also in OptiMEM medium as described previously (28Henry L.K. Adkins E.M. Han Q. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37052-37063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), or with Lipofectin followed by infection with vTF7-3 vaccinia virus as described (29Blakely R.D.

Following transfection (20–48 h), cells were washed with one of the following buffers: MKRHG assay buffer (120 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4); chloride-containing assay buffer (5.4 mm potassium gluconate, 1.2 mm calcium gluconate, 7.5 mm HEPES, and either NaCl or NMDG-Cl at 120 mm;) chloride-free assay buffer (same as chloride-containing buffer except 120 mm NaCl is replaced with 120 mm NaX (X = Br, I, NO2, NO3, thiocyanate, acetate, methanesulfonate, or gluconate) and assayed for [3H]5-HT (5-hydroxy[3H]tryptamine-trifluoroacetate, (121 Ci/mmol) Amersham Biosciences) transport as described previously (28Henry L.K. Adkins E.M. Han Q. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37052-37063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For Na+ replacements assays, NMDG-Cl was used in place of NaCl. Transport was linear with time under these conditions for up to 15 min. Saturation kinetic profiles for derivation of 5-HT Km and Vmax values were established in 24-well plates as described above except 2-fold serial dilutions were used maintaining 5-HT-specific activity, starting at 5 μm of a mixture of labeled and unlabeled 5-HT. Transport assays were terminated by three washes with ice-cold assay buffer, and cells were then dissolved in MicroScint 20 (Packard) scintillation fluid. Uptake from mock-transfected cells was subtracted from transporter-transfected cells to determine specific uptake. Nontransfected cells exhibited comparable uptake to assays performed in the presence of 1 μm paroxetine, 1 μm RTI-55, or 100 nm cocaine. Km and Vmax values were derived using a nonlinear curve fit as a function of 5-HT or NE concentration (40 nm to 5 μm) (Prism 4 for Mac, Graphpad software). All experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated in three or more separate assays. Cells were loaded as described above for transport studies with 40 nm [3H]5-HT. Loading was allowed to proceed for 30 or 90 min at 37 °C and was terminated by aspiration of assay buffer and a single wash with 0.5 ml of ice-cold MKRHG buffer. MKRHG buffer (0.5 ml) was added to one-half of the wells and returned to 37 °C for 30 min. The wells that did not receive buffer represent the total 5-HT taken up at T = 0. Buffer from the efflux wells (representing 5-HT efflux) was collected, transferred to scintillation vials with 5 ml of EcoScint H, and counted. 5-HT remaining in the cells at T = 30 or 90 min was assessed by scintillation spectrometry. Percent efflux was calculated as the ratio (×100) of 5-HT efflux divided by 5-HT accumulated in parallel plates, not subjected to efflux, at T = 0. No difference was observed in % efflux for plates pre-loaded for 30 or 90 min (data not shown). To determine total and surface expression of hSERT with wild type and/or mutant constructs, HeLa cells were plated in 24 or 12 well dishes at 100,000 or 500,000 cells per well, respectively, and transfected 18–24 h later as detailed above. Seventy two hours after transfection, cell surface proteins were biotinylated and analyzed via Western blotting as described previously (28Henry L.K. Adkins E.M. Han Q. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37052-37063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Oocyte biotinylation experiments to quantitate surface expression of hSERT and hSERT mutants were performed as described previously (12Ramsey I.S. DeFelice L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14475-14482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) using 1.5 ng of cRNA and substituting EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) with EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin. Blots of total and surface protein were probed with ST-01 from Mab Technologies., Inc. (Stone Mountain, GA), and developed using Western Lightening Chemiluminescent Plus reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To probe for ion-dependent hSERT conformational movements, HeLa cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated 24-well TopCount plates at a density of 50,000 cells/well and transfected as described above. Twenty four hours post-transfection, cells were washed one time with 2 ml, one time with 1 ml, and one time with 500 μl of MKRH (MKRHG without glucose) ± 120 mm Cl− and ± 50 μm 5-HT. Following a 5-min incubation, solutions were aspirated and replaced with 500 μl of 2 mm MTSET in MKRH. MKRH alone was added to one set of wells as a control. MTSET-treated wells were washed twice with 750 μl of MKRH followed by aspiration and addition of 225 μl of MKRHG. Cells were allowed to equilibrate to 37 °C for 10 min followed by addition of 25 μl of 200 nm [3H]5-HT containing 10× ascorbic acid/HCl and iproniazid phosphate. After 10 min at 37 °C, wells were washed three times with 500 μl of ice-cold MKRH. MicroScint 20 (0.5 ml) was added to each well, and the accumulated 5-HT was quantified. rSERT N101A/S404C accessibility was examined using MTSEA. HeLa cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 50,000 cells/well transfected and infected with vTF7-3 as described above. Twenty hours post-transfection, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline with magnesium and calcium (PBS: 137 mm NaCl or equimolar concentration of NMDG-Cl or sodium isethionate, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3) containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 (PBSCM). Following a 5-min incubation, solutions were aspirated and replaced with 50 μl of MTSEA in the indicated concentrations in 50 μl of PBSCM. After 10 min, the cells were washed five times with 100 μl of PBSCM followed by incubation with 20 nm [3H]5-HT for 10 min in 50 μl of PBSCM. After 10 min, wells were washed three times with 100 μl of PBSCM. Optifluor (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (150 μl) was added to each well, and accumulated 5-HT was measured in a Wallac MicroBeta plate counter. Cells transfected with S404C was used as the control. Oocytes were isolated, and cRNA was prepared as described previously (12Ramsey I.S. DeFelice L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14475-14482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 30Adams S.V. DeFelice L.J. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 1548-1559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). cRNA was injected on the day of oocyte harvest. hSERT, N101A, N101C, S336C, N101A/S336C, and N101C/S336C cRNA were transcribed from NotI-linearized constructs in pOTV vector (a gift of Dr. Mark Sonders, Columbia University) using Ambion mMessage Machine T7 kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Each oocyte was injected with 1.5 ng of cRNA and incubated at 18 °C for 4–6 days in Ringer's buffer (100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) supplemented with 550 μm/ml sodium pyruvate, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 50 μg/ml tetracycline, and 5% dialyzed horse serum. Whole-cell currents were measured by two-electrode voltage clamp techniques using a GeneClamp 500 (Molecular Devices, Palo Alto, CA). Microelectrodes were pulled using a programmable puller (Model P-87, Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA) and filled with 3 m KCl (0.5–3-megohm resistance). A 16-bit A/D converter (Digidata 1322A, Molecular Devices) interfaced to a PC computer running Clampex 9 software (Molecular Devices) was used to control membrane voltage and to acquire data. To induce hSERT-associated current, oocytes were perfused with 5-HT (typically 5 μm) in buffer (120 NaCl mm, 5.4 mm potassium gluconate, 1.2 mm calcium gluconate, 7.2 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm iproniazid, pH 7.4) using a gravity flow system (4–5 ml/min). Buffer pH was adjusted with KOH or KHPO4. The 5-HT-induced current was defined as current in the presence of 5-HT minus current in the absence of 5-HT. Substitution of Cl− was performed as with the tissue culture studies above and are indicated in the text and figures. To minimize liquid junction potentials, Cl− substitution experiments were performed using a 1 m KCl, 2% agar salt bridge to isolate the Ag-AgCl electrode from the bath. For constant voltage recordings, data were low pass filtered at 10 Hz and digitized at 20 Hz. For current-voltage (I-V) recordings, the voltage was changed stepwise every 500 ms. Currents were low pass filtered at 100 Hz and digitized at 200 Hz. All analyses were performed using Origin 7 (OriginLab, Northampton, MA) and GraphPad Prism (GraphPad software, San Diego). Simultaneous measurement of 5-HT uptake and 5-HT-induced current was performed under voltage clamp conditions, using techniques described previously (31Petersen C.I. DeFelice L.J. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 605-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Oocytes were perfused for 150 s under voltage clamp with 1 μm [3H]5-HT (specific activity = 3.12 Ci/mmol). To minimize loss of 5-HT, oocytes were perfused with ice-cold buffer for 250 s prior to removal from the chamber. The total charge movement was calculated by time integration of 5-HT-induced inward currents and related to the amount of 5-HT taken up in the same oocyte. Nonspecific 5-HT uptake was determined using water-injected control oocytes analyzed under the same conditions. Oocytes were solubilized with 200 μl of 0.1% SDS and 10 ml of EcoScint H (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA), and 5-HT accumulation was quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry (Packard Instrument Co.). Molecular models for hSERT were generated using the template structure of LeuTAa (PDB_ID 2A65) as detailed elsewhere (32Kaufmann K.W. Dawson E.S. Henry L.K. Field J.R. Blakely R.D. Meiler J. Proteins. 2009; 74: 630-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The binding mode for 5-HT identified as the one most consistent with available experimental data by Kaufmann et al. (32Kaufmann K.W. Dawson E.S. Henry L.K. Field J.R. Blakely R.D. Meiler J. Proteins. 2009; 74: 630-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) was taken as the starting point for model refinement using the AMBER forcefield. Briefly, ions were added to the energy-minimized model of 5-HT in complex with hSERT to generate refined models that either contained NaCl or omitted Cl− (Na+ only). Two Na+ ions were added to both the Na+ (without Cl−) and NaCl models by superimposing the hSERT model reported by Kaufmann et al. (32Kaufmann K.W. Dawson E.S. Henry L.K. Field J.R. Blakely R.D. Meiler J. Proteins. 2009; 74: 630-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) with the x-ray structure of LeuTAa and utilizing the coordinates of atom NA 752 (Na1-binding site) and NA 751 (Na2-binding site). For the NaCl model, a single Cl− ion was centered on the region of the hSERT model occupied by the side-chain carboxyl group of residue Glu-290 in LeuTAa, as recently validated in studies of SERT and GAT (33Zomot E. Bendahan A. Quick M. Zhao Y. Javitch J.A. Kanner B.I. Nature. 2007; 449: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 34Forrest L.R. Tavoulari S. Zhang Y.W. Rudnick G. Honig B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 12761-12766Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Models of the hSERT ion-binding sites were then refined with 50 steps of “steepest descents” and 450 steps of gradient-based minimization in AMBER9 (32Kaufmann K.W. Dawson E.S. Henry L.K. Field J.R. Blakely R.D. Meiler J. Proteins. 2009; 74: 630-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) followed by brief (1 ns) low temperature (50 K) molecular dynamics simulations in vacuo, using a distance-dependent dielectric constant and 12-Å cutoff for nonbonded interactions to energetically relax the system. The resulting structures were then subjected to an additional round of energy minimization as described above to generate the reported models. Partial charges for 5-HT were ascribed using the atom-centered point charge method of Bayly and Kollman (35Bayly C.I. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 697-703Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). All other molecular mechanics parameters for 5-HT and ions were taken from the standard AMBER force field with the exception of acetate. Acetate parameters were derived by analogy to the ionized form of the carboxylic acid side chain of aspartate from the standard AMBER9 database truncated at the CB atom with total partial charge equal to −1.0). Two-dimensional schematics of the refined hSERT ion-binding sites were generated with ChemDraw 10.0 (Cambridge Soft), and three-dimensional representations were rendered with PyMol (Schrödinger, LLC). Molecular models of a protonated 5-HT were developed where the geometry parameters (bond lengths and angles) were obtained by quantum mechanics minimization at the B3LYP/6–31G* level of theory using the restrained electrostatic potential fitting approach described by Anisimov et al. (36Anisimov V.M. Lamoureux G. Vorobyov I.V. Huang N. Roux B. MacKerell Jr., A.D. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2005; 1: 153-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The net charge of 5-HT molecule was set to +1 with the side-chain nitrogen protonated based on the reported pKa values. Parameters for deprotonated cysteine (thiolate ion) for pKa computations have been validated and published before by Foloppe and Nillson (37Foloppe N. Nilsson L. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 798-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For equilibrium MD simulations, the starting configuration for SERT complexed with the 5-HT, two sodium, and one chloride ion was taken from the minimized molecular model described above. The S352C, S336C, and N101A mutants were obtained with a side-chain rotamer library search using SCWRL3.0 software (38Canutescu A.A. Shelenkov A.A. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2001-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). The complexes were next embedded into a lipid membrane using a multiple step membrane building procedure used in previous studies (39Jo S. Lim J.B. Klauda J.B. Im W. Biophys. J. 2009; 97: 50-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). The simulation box contains the 5-HT transporter, bound sodium ions with (or without) chloride/acetate ions, one serotonin substrate, and 204 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine lipid molecules solvated in an explicit 150 mm NaCl aqueous solution. All computations were carried out by NAMD version 2.7b1 (40Phillips J.C. Braun R. Wang W. Gumbart J. Tajkhorshid E. Villa E. Chipot C. Skeel R.D. Kalé L. Schulten K. J. Comput. Chem. 2005; 26: 1781-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (13227) Google Scholar), and analysis was done with CHARMM version c36b2 with the CHARMM27 force fields for proteins and lipids (41Brooks B.R.

Chem. 2009; 30: 1545-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (5859) Google Scholar). MD simulation methods used here are similar to those used in previous studies of membrane systems (42Caplan D.A. Subbotina J.O. Noskov S.Y. Biophys. J. 2008; 95: 4613-4621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 43Noskov S.Y. Proteins. 2008; 73: 851-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, constant temperature/constant pressure algorithms were applied (with pressure at 1 atm and temperature at 315 K). Electrostatic interactions were treated with the Particle Mesh Ewald algorithm with a 104/104/96-Å grid for fast Fourier transform, κ = 0.34 Å−1, and a 6th order spline interpolation. The nonbonded interactions were smoothly switched off at 12–14 Å. All simulation systems were equilibrated for 5 ns each without any constraints, and the production was run for another 15 ns. Further details on protocols used for FEP and molecular mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area simulations can be found in the supplemental materials. To examine a role of hSERT Asn-101 in the Cl− dependence of 5-HT transport, we transfected HeLa cells with hSERT or hSERT N101A and N101C mutants and measured the effect of extracellular Cl− on 5-HT transport saturation kinetics (Fig. 1). As described previously (44Chang A.S. Lam D.M. J. Physiol. 1998; 510: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), removal of external Cl− from the medium of hSERT-transfected cells resulted in a significant (5-fold) decrease in 5-HT transport Vmax (NaCl, 0.068 ± 0.006 fmol/cell/min; sodium gluconate, 0.014 ± 0.002) and a significant (3.6-fold) increase in 5-HT Km (NaCl, 0.9 ± 0.2 μm; sodium gluconate, 3.2 ± 0.36 μm, one-way ANOVA, Dunnett's post hoc, p < 0.002). Remarkably, the hSERT N101A and N101C mutants were largely insensitive to Cl− substitution with gluconate (Fig. 1, b and c). Moreover, the 5-HT Km values of N101A and N101C were not influenced by the presence of Cl−, unlike hSERT, and were comparable with the 5-HT Km values obtained for hSERT in the presence of Cl− (N101A+Cl 1.45 ± 0.4 μm, N101A-Cl 1.66 ± 0.2 μm; N101C+Cl 1.20 ± 0.3 μm, N101C−Cl 1.4 ± 0.2 μm; hSERT+Cl 0.87 ± 0.2 μm, hSERT−Cl 3.2 ± 0.4 μm). The rate of 5-HT transport by hSERT was a monotonic fun"

Compartment-specific v-SNAREs on a transport vesicle pair with their cognate t-SNAREs on the target membrane and drive lipid bilayer fusion. In a reconstituted assay that dissects the sequential assembly of t-SNARE (syntaxin 1·SNAP-25) and v-/t-SNARE (VAMP2·syntaxin 1·SNAP-25) complexes, and finally measures lipid bilayer merger, we resolved the inhibitory and stimulatory functions of the Sec1p/Munc18 protein Munc18-1 at the molecular level. Inhibition of membrane fusion by Munc18-1 requires a closed conformation of syntaxin 1. Remarkably, the concurrent preincubation of Munc18-1-inhibited syntaxin 1 liposomes with both VAMP2 liposomes and SNAP-25 at low temperature releases the inhibition and effectively stimulates membrane fusion. VAMP8 liposomes can neither release the inhibition nor exert the stimulatory effect, demonstrating the need for a specific Munc18-1/VAMP2 interaction. In addition, Munc18-1 binds to the N-terminal peptide of syntaxin 1, which is obligatory for a robust stimulation of membrane fusion. In contrast, this interaction is neither required for the inhibitory function of Munc18-1 nor for the release of this block. These results indicate that Munc18-1 and the neuronal SNAREs already have the inherent capability to function as a basic stage-specific off/on switch to control membrane fusion.

Biol. 2008; 15: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). SNAREs are characterized by SNARE motifs, stretches of 60–70 amino acids, which contain heptad repeats with a central “0” layer and assemble into specific four-helix bundles (5Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). The formation of SNAREpins, trans v-/t-SNARE complexes bridging two membranes, occurs in a zipper-like manner that starts at the membrane distal (N-terminal) end of the SNAREpins and proceeds toward the (C-terminal) membrane-spanning anchors of the SNAREs (6Melia T.J. Weber T. McNew J.A. Fisher L.E. Johnston R.J. Parlati F. Mahal L.K. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 7Pobbati A.V. Stein A.

Thus, the energy required for membrane fusion is provided by the exergonic folding of the largely unstructured v- and t-SNARE proteins into stable four-helix bundles (2Weber T. Zemelman B.V.

Although SNAREs can be considered to be the minimal membrane fusion machinery, in the physiological cellular environment, an array of accessory proteins and lipids controls the spatial and temporal activity of SNARE proteins (10Malsam J.

At least two SNARE-binding modes have been described. In the first mode, the SM protein binds the t-SNARE component syntaxin in a “closed” conformation, in which the N-terminal three-helical Habc domain of syntaxin folds back on a part of the SNARE motif (23Fernandez I.

Therefore, SM proteins can function as catalysts of SNARE complex formation, and hence the combination of the SM and SNARE proteins has been designated to be the universal fusion machinery (44Südhof T.C. Rothman J.E. Science. 2009; 323: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar). This terminology expands the concept of the SNAREs, representing the minimal components of the fusion machinery. Consistent with this notion, reconstituted fusion assays have revealed that defined SM proteins increase selectively the fusion of distinct v- and t-SNARE partners (41Shen J. Tareste D.C. Paumet F.

One of the best studied model systems is neurotransmitter release, which employs the v-SNARE VAMP2/synaptobrevin 2 (on synaptic vesicles), the t-SNAREs syntaxin 1, SNAP-25 (on the plasma membrane), and the cognate SM protein Munc18-1 (19Rizo J.

Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 684-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Specific point mutations (L165A/E166A) in the linker of syntaxin 1 reduce the affinity for Munc18-1 by interfering with binding mode 1 and increase t-SNARE assembly (26Dulubova I. Sugita S. Hill S. Hosaka M. Fernandez I. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4372-4382Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). This result strongly suggests that this syntaxin 1 mutant mimics an “open” conformation. The transition from the syntaxin/SM conformation to the SNAREpin·SM complex apparently requires such an open syntaxin 1. Binding studies revealed the existence of an open syntaxin 1/Munc18-1 intermediate (29Rickman C. Medine C.N. Bergmann A. Duncan R.R. J. Biol.

In living cells, this transition is facilitated by regulatory components, such as Munc13 and lipids (54Richmond J.E. Davis W.S. Jorgensen E.M. Nat.

Together with recent studies, these results provide further in vivo support for the late acting (mode 2) function of Munc18 in SNAREpin formation/assembly (60de Wit H. Walter A.M. Milosevic I.

In a reconstituted liposome fusion assay containing preassembled t-SNARE complexes, the presence of the N-peptide favors membrane fusion (41Shen J. Tareste D.C. Paumet F. Rothman J.E. Melia T.J.

Cell Biol. 2010; 190: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In contrast, using the same components, but now in solution, the presence of the N-peptide inhibits the formation of a stable v-/t-SNARE complex in the presence of Munc18-1 (35Burkhardt P. Hattendorf D.A. Weis W.I. Fasshauer D. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). When UNC-18 mutants (F113R and L116K) that selectively abolish the N-peptide interaction were expressed in unc-18 null C. elegans, the defect in regulated exocytosis could not be rescued, supporting the functional importance of the Munc18-1/syntaxin 1 N-peptide interaction (31McEwen J.M. Kaplan J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 3836-3846Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 53Johnson J.R. Ferdek P. Lian L.Y. Barclay J.W. Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A. Biochem. J. 2009; 418: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the N-peptide inhibits neurotransmitter release in the calyx of Held synapses (37Khvotchev M. Dulubova I. Sun J. Dai H. Rizo J. Südhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 12147-12155Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, in secretion-deficient PC12 cells, which lack both Munc18-1 and Munc18-2, Munc18-1 mutants (F115E and E132A) that impair the binding to the syntaxin N-peptide Munc18-1 rescue exocytosis to a large degree (32Han L. Jiang T. Han G.A. Malintan N.T. Xie L. Wang L. Tse F.W. Gaisano H.Y. Collins B.M. Meunier F.A. Sugita S. Mol. Biol.

This result suggests a more subtle role of the syntaxin 1 N-peptide in dense core vesicle exocytosis.To obtain further insights into the different syntaxin 1/ Munc18-1 interaction modes and the role of the N-terminal syntaxin 1 peptide in this reaction cascade, we established a liposome fusion assay, which measures the assembly of the t-SNAREs on liposomes and the subsequent SNAREpin formation between the v- and t-SNARE liposomes. In such an assay, syntaxin 1 can adopt its stage-specific conformations, and the role of Munc18-1 can be studied at distinct steps of the fusion reaction using lipid mixing as the ultimate readout signal.DISCUSSIONHere, we have resolved the different functional properties of Munc18-1 and syntaxin 1 at distinct stages of SNARE complex assembly in a reconstituted fusion assay, which analyzes SNARE complex formation in a membrane environment and measures lipid mixing as the ultimate functional readout. Our experiments reveal that the inhibitory effect of Munc18-1 depends on a closed conformation of syntaxin 1 but does not require the N-peptide of syntaxin 1. The observation that Munc18-1 inhibits t-SNARE complex assembly in a lipid environment is consistent with previous experiments demonstrating the inhibitory mode in solution (71Yang B. Steegmaier M. Gonzalez Jr., L.C. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Because we used soluble SNAP-25, which lacks the post-translational palmitoyl modifications, we cannot exclude that t-SNARE complexes might form more efficiently on liposomes in the presence of palmitoylated SNAP-25. However, the presence of palmitoyl membrane anchors in SNAP-25 should not affect the inhibitory Munc18-1/syntaxin 1 interaction that is characterized by distinct binding revealed in the crystal structure of the Munc18-1·syntaxin 1 complex (24Misura K.M. Scheller R.H. Weis W.I. Nature. 2000; 404: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the simultaneous preincubation of the Munc18-1-inhibited syntaxin 1 liposomes with SNAP-25 and VAMP2 liposomes at low temperature (nonfusogenic conditions) releases the Munc18-1 inhibition, and Munc18-1 is converted into a stimulator. The inhibition release and the stimulation depend on the specific Munc18-1/VAMP2 interaction. Thus, at steady state an inhibitory Munc18-1·syntaxin 1 complex dominates in the presence of SNAP-25, and only a small fraction of t-SNARE complexes might form. In the presence of v-SNARE liposomes, this small fraction of t-SNARE complexes can bind the v-SNARE resulting in SNAREpins that still need to zipper up in the membrane proximal region. Because VAMP8 liposomes are not sufficient to efficiently relieve the inhibitory function of Munc18-1, it becomes apparent that the specific interaction of Munc18-1 with VAMP2 is required to further drive the reaction. In the simplest model, Munc18-1 binds VAMP2 in partially assembled SNAREpins, thereby enhancing SNAREpin stability/assembly and membrane fusion (41Shen J. Tareste D.C. Paumet F. Rothman J.E. Melia T.J. Cell. 2007; 128: 183-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Thus, the small fraction of SNAREpins, which forms at steady state, would be constantly consumed by the action of Munc18-1. Alternatively, VAMP2 might function at an earlier stage before it binds its cognate t-SNARE partners. In an initial step, VAMP2 could interact with the Munc18-1·syntaxin 1 complex, relieve the inhibitory conformation, and subsequently SNAP-25 binding would follow. The exact order in which VAMP2 interacts with Munc18-1 and its cognate t-SNAREs still remains open.A recent study showed that VAMP2 itself and VAMP2 as part of the SNARE four-helix bundle can compete with the syntaxin 1 Habc domain for binding to the central cavity of Munc18-1, thereby suggesting a potential molecular reaction mechanism (72Xu Y. Su L. Rizo J. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 1568-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A model emerges in which VAMP2 contributes to the displacement of the Habc domain from the central cavity of Munc18-1 or blocks the reassociation of Munc18-1 with the Habc domain. Mapping of the binding site revealed that Munc18-1 interacts with the membrane proximal region of VAMP2 (72Xu Y. Su L. Rizo J. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 1568-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Based on FRET experiments VAMP2 likely binds domain 3a of Munc18-1 (72Xu Y. Su L. Rizo J. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 1568-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In addition, structural analysis showed that domain 3a can adopt a helical structure, which is compatible with a direct interaction with the helical SNARE motif of syntaxin 1 (73Hu S.H. Christie M.P. Saez N.J. Latham C.F. Jarrott R. Lua L.H. Collins B.M. Martin J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 1040-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Thus, upon relief of the Habc domain inhibition, the central cavity of Munc18-1 and likely domain 3a will be available to bind the SNARE motifs within the SNAREpin. In this binding mode, Munc18-1 stimulates SNAREpin assembly and membrane fusion. Indeed, in vitro fusion experiments using preassembled t-SNAREs showed that the central cavity of Munc18-1 contains critical amino acids that are required to stimulate fusion (62Shen J. Rathore S.S. Khandan L. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2010; 190: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Point mutations within the Habc domain that impair the binding to the central cavity of Munc18-1 or removal of the entire Habc domain, excluding the N-peptide, do not abolish Munc18-1-dependent fusion stimulation in vitro (62Shen J. Rathore S.S. Khandan L. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2010; 190: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In contrast, the syntaxin 1 N-peptide/Munc18-1 interaction is required to stimulate membrane fusion (41Shen J. Tareste D.C. Paumet F. Rothman J.E. Melia T.J. Cell. 2007; 128: 183-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 62Shen J. Rathore S.S. Khandan L. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2010; 190: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Although the exact function of the syntaxin 1 N-peptide still remains unclear, recent structural analyses suggest that it can alter the conformation of Munc18-1 (73Hu S.H. Christie M.P. Saez N.J. Latham C.F. Jarrott R. Lua L.H. Collins B.M. Martin J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 1040-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Our functional studies show that the release of the Munc18-1 inhibition indeed requires VAMP2 but can occur independently of the syntaxin 1 N-peptide. Interestingly, the Munc18-1/syntaxin 1 N-peptide interaction is also controlled by phosphorylation, which inhibits regulated exocytosis (61Rickman C. Duncan R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 3965-3972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In general, dependent on the intracellular transport step, the physiological requirements for syntaxin N-peptides and the affinities of distinct Munc18 homologs for syntaxin N-peptides, Habc domains, and SNARE complexes can vary significantly (74Munson M. Bryant N.J. Biochem. J. 2009; 418: e1-e3Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).A previous study showed that the deletion of the syntaxin 1 N-peptide (first 24 amino acids) permits v-/t-SNARE complex formation in the presence of Munc18-1, suggesting an inhibitory role for the syntaxin 1 N-peptide/Munc18-1 interaction (35Burkhardt P. Hattendorf D.A. Weis W.I. Fasshauer D. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). This inhibitory role of the N-peptide in SNARE complex assembly seems to contradict the stimulatory role of the N-peptide in membrane fusion. However, the different experimental approaches provide an explanation. In one set of experiments, the assembly of cytoplasmic SNARE domains was measured (35Burkhardt P. Hattendorf D.A. Weis W.I. Fasshauer D. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). These experiments also show that the affinity of Munc18-1 for the cytoplasmic domain of syntaxin 1 (Kd 1.4 ± 0.3 nm) drops in the absence of the N-peptide (Kd 8.1 ± 1.0 nm). The binding of Munc18-1 to the N-terminal regulatory domain (amino acids 1–179) is significantly weaker (Kd 693.9 ± 84.2 nm). Thus, the absence of the N-peptide further reduces the affinity of Munc18-1 for the Habc domain ((35Burkhardt P. Hattendorf D.A. Weis W.I. Fasshauer D. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and data not shown). Because the Habc domain apparently functions as an inhibitor, a weaker Munc18-1 interaction (in the absence of the syntaxin 1 N-peptide) would reduce its inhibitory function, thus allowing cis SNARE complex formation as observed by Burkhardt et al. (35Burkhardt P. Hattendorf D.A. Weis W.I. Fasshauer D. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The other sets of experiments analyze full-length SNAREs in their cellular environment or reconstituted into liposomes, measure SNAREpin assembly, and use membrane fusion as a functional readout system. In such assays, other functions for the N-peptide become apparent. Already, the membrane environment adds different constraints. For example, in solution, Munc18-1 shows only a weak interaction with assembled v-/t-SNARE complexes that lack the syntaxin N-peptide (41She"

It suggests that the pH value plays a critical role in controlling the the morphology of the nanostructures and fast polymerization rate favors the anisotropic growth of PMPD under homogeneous nucleation condition. We further demonstrate that such PMPD nanostructures can be used as an effective fluorescent sensing platform for multiplex nucleic acid detection. A detection limit as low as 50 pM and a high selectivity down to single-base mismatch could be achieved. The fluorescence quenching is attributed to photoinduced electron transfer from nitrogen atom in PMPD to excited fluorophore. Most importantly, the successful use of this sensing platform in human blood serum system is also demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W1966559184,"Fork loop 2 is a small semiconservative segment of the larger fork domain in the second largest Rpb2 subunit of RNA polymerase II (Pol II). This flexible loop, juxtaposed at the leading edge of transcription bubble, has been proposed to participate in DNA strand separation, translocation along DNA, and NTP loading to Pol II during elongation. Here we show that the Rpb2 mutant carrying a deletion of the flexible part of the loop is not lethal in yeast. The mutation exhibits no defects in DNA melting and translocation in vitro but confers a moderate decrease of the catalytic activity of the enzyme caused by the impaired sequestration of the NTP substrate in the active center prior to catalysis. In the structural model of the Pol II elongation complex, fork loop 2 directly interacts with an unpaired DNA residue in the non-template DNA strand one nucleotide ahead from the active center (the i+2 position). We showed that elimination of this putative interaction by replacement of the i+2 residue with an abasic site inhibits Pol II activity to the same degree as the deletion of fork loop 2. This replacement has no detectable effect on the activity of the mutant enzyme. We provide direct evidence that interaction of fork loop 2 with the non-template DNA strand facilitates NTP sequestration through interaction with the adjacent segment of the fork domain involved in the active center of Pol II."
https://openalex.org/W2036741473,"Overconfidence has long been considered a cause of war. Like other decision-making biases, overconfidence seems detrimental because it increases the frequency and costs of fighting. However, evolutionary biologists have proposed that overconfidence may also confer adaptive advantages: increasing ambition, resolve, persistence, bluffing opponents, and winning net payoffs from risky opportunities despite occasional failures. We report the results of an agent-based model of inter-state conflict, which allows us to evaluate the performance of different strategies in competition with each other. Counter-intuitively, we find that overconfident states predominate in the population at the expense of unbiased or underconfident states. Overconfident states win because: (1) they are more likely to accumulate resources from frequent attempts at conquest; (2) they are more likely to gang up on weak states, forcing victims to split their defences; and (3) when the decision threshold for attacking requires an overwhelming asymmetry of power, unbiased and underconfident states shirk many conflicts they are actually likely to win. These ""adaptive advantages"" of overconfidence may, via selection effects, learning, or evolved psychology, have spread and become entrenched among modern states, organizations and decision-makers. This would help to explain the frequent association of overconfidence and war, even if it no longer brings benefits today."
https://openalex.org/W2075669278,"Withdrawal stress is a common occurrence in opioid users, yet very few studies have examined the effects of morphine withdrawal (MW) on immune functioning or the role of glucocorticoids in MW-induced immunomodulation. This study investigated for the first time the role of glucocorticoids in MW modulation of LPS-induced IL-12p40, a key cytokine playing a pivotal role in immunoprotection. Using WT and μ-opioid receptor knock-out mice, we show that MW in vivo significantly attenuated LPS-induced IL-12p40 mRNA and protein expression. The role of glucocorticoids in MW modulation of IL-12p40 was investigated using a murine macrophage cell line, CRL2019, in an in vitro MW model. Interestingly, MW alone in the absence of glucocorticoids resulted in a significant reduction in IL-12p40 promoter activity and mRNA and protein expression. EMSA revealed a concurrent decrease in consensus binding to transcription factors NFκB, Activator Protein-1, and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein and Western blot analysis demonstrated a significant activation of LPS-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Interestingly, although glucocorticoid treatment alone also modulated these transcription factors and ERK1/2 activation, the addition of glucocorticoids to MW samples resulted in a greater than additive reduction in the transcription factors and significant hyperactivation of LPS-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation. ERK inhibitors reversed MW and MW plus corticosterone inhibition of LPS-induced IL-12p40. The potentiating effects of glucocorticoids were non-genomic because nuclear translocation of glucocorticoid receptor was not significantly different between MW and corticosterone treatment. This study demonstrates for the first time that MW and glucocorticoids independently modulate IL-12p40 production through a mechanism involving ERK1/2 hyperactivation and that glucocorticoids can significantly augment MW-induced inhibition of IL-12p40."

More recent cell culture studies suggested a role for Dredd in the activation of dJNK (Drosophila JNK). However, there are no epistatic or mechanistic data on the involvement of Dredd in dJNK activation. More importantly, there is no in vivo evidence to demonstrate a physiological requirement for Dredd in the IMD/dJNK pathway. We performed a comprehensive analysis of the role of Dredd in the IMD/dJNK pathway, and we demonstrated that Dredd is essential for the activation of IMD/dJNK in cell culture. We positioned Dredd activity at an early point of the IMD/dJNK pathway and uncovered a series of interactions between Dredd and additional proximal IMD pathway molecules. Mechanistically, we showed that the caspase activity inhibitor p35 blocked dJNK activation and the induction of dJNK-dependent genes in cell culture and in vivo. Most importantly, we demonstrated that dredd mutant flies are completely inhibited in their ability to activate dJNK or express dJNK-responsive target genes after bacterial infection in vivo. In conclusion, we established Dredd as an essential component of the IMD pathway required for the full activation of IMD/dJNK in cell culture and in vivo. Our data enhance our appreciation of Dredd-dependent IMD signal transduction events."
https://openalex.org/W1998227490,"Background The preclinical stage of systolic heart failure (HF), known as asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction (ALVD), is diagnosed only by echocardiography, frequent in the general population and leads to a high risk of developing severe HF. Large scale screening for ALVD is a difficult task and represents a major unmet clinical challenge that requires the determination of ALVD biomarkers. Methodology/Principal Findings 294 individuals were screened by echocardiography. We identified 9 ALVD cases out of 128 subjects with cardiovascular risk factors. White blood cell gene expression profiling was performed using pangenomic microarrays. Data were analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA) and Significant Analysis of Microarrays (SAM). To build an ALVD classifier model, we used the nearest centroid classification method (NCCM) with the ClaNC software package. Classification performance was determined using the leave-one-out cross-validation method. Blood transcriptome analysis provided a specific molecular signature for ALVD which defined a model based on 7 genes capable of discriminating ALVD cases. Analysis of an ALVD patients validation group demonstrated that these genes are accurate diagnostic predictors for ALVD with 87% accuracy and 100% precision. Furthermore, Receiver Operating Characteristic curves of expression levels confirmed that 6 out of 7 genes discriminate for left ventricular dysfunction classification. Conclusions/Significance These targets could serve to enhance the ability to efficiently detect ALVD by general care practitioners to facilitate preemptive initiation of medical treatment preventing the development of HF."
https://openalex.org/W2081889143,"Intrinsic transcription termination signal in DNA consists of a short inverted repeat followed by a T-rich stretch. Transcription of this sequence by RNA polymerase (RNAP) results in formation of a ""termination hairpin"" (TH) in the nascent RNA and in rapid dissociation of the transcription elongation complex (EC) at termination points located 7-8 nt downstream of the base of TH stem. RNAP envelops 15 nt of the RNA following RNA growing 3'-end, suggesting that folding of the TH is impeded by a tight protein environment when RNAP reaches the termination points. To monitor TH folding under this constraint, we halted Escherichia coli ECs at various distances downstream from a TH and treated them with single-strand specific RNase T1. The EC interfered with TH formation when halted at 6, 7, and 8, but not 9, nt downstream from the base of the potential stem. Thus, immediately before termination, the downstream arm of the TH is protected from complementary interactions with the upstream arm. This protection makes TH folding extremely sensitive to the sequence context, because the upstream arm easily engages in competing interactions with the rest of the nascent RNA. We demonstrate that by de-synchronizing TH formation and transcription of the termination points, this subtle competition significantly affects the efficiency of transcription termination. This finding can explain previous puzzling observations that sequences far upstream of the TH or point mutations in the terminator that preserve TH stability affect termination. These results can help understand other time sensitive co-transcriptional processes in pro- and eukaryotes."

In this study, paired Cys replacement mutants in helices V and I were strategically constructed with tandem factor Xa protease cleavage sites in the loop between the two helices to test cross-linking. None of the mutants form disulfides spontaneously; however, three mutants (Pro28 → Cys/Cys154, Pro28 → Cys/Val158 → Cys, and Phe29 → Cys/Val158 → Cys) exhibit cross-linking after treatment with copper/1,10-phenanthroline (Cu/Ph) or 1,1-methanediyl bismethanethiosulfonate ((MTS)2-1), 3–4 Å), and cross-linking is quantitative in the presence of ligand. Remarkably, with one mutant, complete cross-linking with (MTS)2-1 has no effect on lactose transport, whereas quantitative disulfide cross-linking catalyzed by Cu/Ph markedly inhibits transport activity. The findings are consistant with a number of previous conclusions suggesting that sugar binding to LacY causes a localized scissors-like movement between helices V and I near the point where the two helices cross in the middle of the membrane.

Typical of many transport proteins from organisms as disparate as Archaea and Homo sapiens, the lactose permease of Escherichia coli (LacY), a member of the major facilitator superfamily (1Saier Jr., M.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 699-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), catalyzes the coupled, stoichiometric translocation of an H+ and a galactopyranoside (galactoside/H+ symport). Because transport is obligatorily coupled, active transport of sugar against a concentration gradient is achieved by transduction of free energy released from the downhill movement of H+ with the electrochemical H+ gradient (Δμ̃H+; interior negative and/or alkaline). Conversely, downhill sugar translocation by LacY drives uphill H+ translocation with the generation of Δμ̃H+, the polarity of which depends on the direction of the sugar concentration gradient (reviewed in Refs. 2Kaback H.R.

Guan L. Freites J.A. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 3774-3778Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). By this means, the cytoplasmic cavity closes with opening of a wide hydrophilic cavity on the periplasmic side of LacY, which allows exposure of sugar- and H+-binding sites to either side of the membrane (the alternating access mechanism) (reviewed in Ref. 33Kaback H.R. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Nie Y. Zhou Y. J. Membr. Biol. 2011; 239: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). LacY appears to be highly dynamic. As shown by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (34le Coutre J. Narasimhan L.R. Patel C.K. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 10167-10171Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the average helix tilt in LacY is ∼51° at a low lipid:protein ratio and decreases to ∼33° at high lipid:protein ratios. In addition, although ∼70% of the side chains in LacY are hydrophobic and buried (3Guan L. Kaback H.R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

Acta. 2009; 1788: 1108-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Early site-directed mutagenesis experiments on the native Cys residues in LacY led to the isolation and characterization of a mutant with Gly in place of native Cys154 (Helix V) (38van Iwaarden P.R.

Res. Commun. 1985; 132: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Remarkably, this single mutation completely changes the functional properties and physical characteristics of LacY (40Smirnova I.N. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3025-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). C154G LacY binds ligand as well or better than wild-type LacY, but catalyzes very little translocation across the membrane (7Mirza O. Guan L. Verner G. Iwata S. Kaback H.R. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1177-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Moreover, whereas sugar binding is mostly entropic with wild-type LacY, it is enthalpic with the C154G mutant (41Nie Y. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Kaback H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35779-35784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Indeed, the mutant does not exhibit the long-range conformational changes normally observed upon ligand binding, and it is also thermostable with respect to ligand binding and aggregation (40Smirnova I.N. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3025-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and is arrested in a partially open-outward conformation(s) (27Nie Y. Sabetfard F.E. Kaback H.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 379: 695-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, the x-ray structure of the mutant exhibits an open-inward conformation (6Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar, 7Mirza O. Guan L. Verner G. Iwata S. Kaback H.R. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1177-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), whereas it is clearly open on the periplasmic side in the membrane (27Nie Y. Sabetfard F.E. Kaback H.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 379: 695-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). X-ray crystal structures yield a clue as to why the C154G mutant is conformationally restricted. As shown (Fig. 1), helices V and I cross in the approximate middle of the membrane where Cys154 (helix V) and Gly24 (helix I) are in close proximity (6Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). Two Gly residues close to each other in adjacent helices can lead to significantly tighter helix packing (42Cosson P. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1992; 258: 659-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 43Lemmon M.A. Flanagan J.M. Treutlein H.R. Zhang J. Engelman D.M.

J. 1999; 77: 1609-1618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), which may partly explain the lack of conformational flexibility of the C154G mutant. Therefore, Gly24 (helix I) was replaced with Cys in the C154G mutant. The G24C/C154G double mutant exhibits a marked increase in transport activity with sugar binding and thermostability similar to wild-type LacY. Replacement of Gly24 with Val or Asp in mutant C154G yields a low degree of rescue, but surprisingly, replacement with Ala, Ile, Met, Thr, Ser, or Glu has no significant effect. Interestingly, replacement of Cys154 with Ser or Thr yields active mutants, whereas the same replacements for Gly24 in the C154G mutant yield little or no activity. Moreover, a mutant with Cys at both positions 24 and 154 transports like the wild type. Taken together, the results indicate that it is not merely the bulk of the side chains at positions 24 and 154 that accounts for the properties of the C154G mutant. The finding also supports the conclusion that mutations disrupting interactions between helix IV and loop 6–7 or between helices II and IV in the intracellular face of LacY also rescue mutant C154G activity (46Ermolova N.V. Smirnova I.N. Kasho V.N. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7669-7677Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All of these positions are located at a distance from positions 14 or 154. Thus, highly precise, dynamic interactions between helices V and I are likely required for proper structural rearrangements during turnover. Further evidence for this proposal is provided by the thiol cross-linking studies between helices V and I presented here.

RSO membrane vesicles were prepared in 0.4 to 1-liter cultures of E. coli T184 expressing a given mutant by lysozyme/EDTA and osmotic lysis (51Kaback H.R. Kaplan N.P. Jakoby W.B. Colowick N.P.

Cross-linking reactions were carried out with 1 ml of suspension of RSO vesicles (1 mg/ml of protein) containing a given paired Cys mutant on ice or at room temperature for 5 min, as indicated. Oxidative cross-linking was catalyzed by adding 0.5 mm (Cu/Ph) freshly prepared by mixing 0.4 ml of a stock solution of 1.25 m 1,10-phenanthroline in 50% ethanol and 0.6 ml of 250 mm CuSO4 (29Zhou Y.

Following 10-fold dilution with cold 100 mm KPi (pH 7.5) and immediate centrifugation (14,000 × g for 10 min) at 4 °C, the samples were washed 3 times with cold 100 mm KPi (pH 7.5) and resuspended in 100 mm KPi (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgSO4 at 3–5 mg of protein/ml. A portion of the preparation was used to assay lactose transport, and the remainder for analysis of cross-linking and protein determination. RSO membrane vesicles containing LacY mutants were adjusted to an A600 of 3.0 (3 mg of protein/ml). Transport was assayed by incubation of samples with 20 mm ascorbate, 0.2 mm phenazine methosulfate, and 0.4 mm [1-14C]lactose (10 mCi/mmol) under oxygen, followed by dilution and rapid filtration at the times given, as described (53Konings W.N. Barnes Jr., E.M. Kaback H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5857-5861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 54Kaback H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 698-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Cross-linking was analyzed as follows: aliquots (10 μg of protein) were digested overnight with fXa protease as described (48Wolin C.D. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6130-6135Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and samples (2 μg of protein) were subjected to SDS-12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting with site-directed polyclonal antibody against the C terminus of LacY followed by an horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit antibody (Amersham Biosciences, NA-934) as described (47Carrasco N. Herzlinger D. Mitchell R. DeChiara S. Danho W. Gabriel T.F. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1984; 81: 4672-4676Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Protein was assayed with the Micro-BCA protein determination kit (Pierce). To investigate dynamic interactions between the periplasmic halves of helices I and V, paired Cys mutants (F21C/C154, G24C/C154, A25C/C154, P28C/C154, F29C/C154, A25C/V158C, F27C/V158C, P28C/V158C, F29C/V158C, and P31C/F162C) at the interface between these helices (Fig. 1) were constructed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown, in addition to a given pair of Cys replacements, each construct contains two tandem fXa protease cleavage sites in the loop between helices IV and V (loop IV/V). Lactose accumulation by RSO vesicles containing given mutants was assayed at 5 min and normalized to Cys-less LacY (Fig. 2). Most double Cys mutants exhibit significant activity, except for mutants F21C/C154 and P28C/C154, which accumulate only about 40 and 20%, respectively, of the lactose accumulated by the Cys-less LacY. Mutant P31C/F162C accumulates less than 5% of the lactose transported by Cys-less LacY in 5 min and therefore was excluded from this study (data not shown). To investigate interactions between helices V and helix I, cross-linking of native Cys154 (helix V) or a mutant containing Cys in place of Val158 (helix V) with Cys replacements in helix I (Fig. 1) was tested in RSO membrane vesicles after incubation with either Cu/Ph as an oxidant or the homobifunctional cross-linking reagent (MTS)2-1 (3–4 Å). Cross-linking was also performed in the absence or presence of the lactose homologue β-d-galactopyranosyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (TDG), and the effect on transport activity was tested as well. Although Cys154 is in close proximity to Gly24 (Fig. 3C), mutant G24C/C154 untreated with cross-linking agent but digested with fXa protease exhibits a single band migrating at an molecular mass of ∼25 kDa after Western blotting with anti-C-terminal antibody (Fig. 3A, lane 1). This band corresponds to a fragment containing the C-terminal eight helices and the central loop (C8). Because digestion with the fXa protease is complete and no anti-C-reactive band was present at ∼35 kDa (the position of full-length LacY), it is apparent that this pair does not form a disulfide bond spontaneously. After incubation with Cu/Ph alone, no effect was observed (lane 2), but when TDG was also added, a small amount of protein migrating at about 35 kDa was observed (lane 3). With (MTS)2-1 alone, a small amount of the 35-kDa band was observed (lane 4), and a slight increase is seen when TDG was also present (lane 5). Finally, lactose transport is essentially unchanged after the treatments described (Fig. 3B). Mutant P28C/C154 (Fig. 4A) also exhibits no spontaneous cross-linking, as the only anti-C-reactive band observed migrates at 25 kDa (Fig. 4A, lane 1). However, about one-third to one-half of the protein is cross-linked in the presence of Cu/Ph without or with TDG, as evidenced by the presence of a relatively large amount of the 35-kDa band after incubation with oxidant in the absence or presence of ligand (lanes 2 and 3, respectively). A slightly greater amount of cross-linking was observed with (MTS)2-1 alone (lane 4), and remarkably, when TDG was added in addition, cross-linking goes to completion (lane 5). Because transport activity by this mutant is relatively low (Fig. 2), it appears that activity is almost abolished after cross-linking under each of the conditions tested (Fig. 4B). To explore the effect of temperature on movement between helices V and I, rates of Cu/Ph-induced cross-linking between P28C and Cys154 were studied at 0 or 23 °C (Fig. 5, A and B). At 0 °C, cross-linking by Cu/Ph reaches ∼23% after 5 min and stays relatively constant thereafter, whereas at room temperature more than 75% was cross-linked after 5 min, and cross-linking is virtually complete after 10 min (Fig. 5C). Mutant A25C/V158C (Fig. 6A) also does not undergo disulfide formation spontaneously (Fig. 6A, lane 1) nor is disulfide formation observed in the presence of Cu/Ph (lane 2), and addition of TDG has no effect (lane 3). Furthermore, no cross-linking was observed with (MTS)2-1 (lane 4); however, when TDG is added in the presence of (MTS)2-1, more than half of the anti-C-reactive protein migrates at 35 kDa, signifying relatively effective cross-linking (lane 5). However, no effect of cross-linking is observed on the transport activity of this paired mutant (Fig. 6B). With mutant P28C/V158C (Fig. 7A), spontaneous disulfide formation is not observed (Fig. 7A, lane 1). But strikingly, complete cross-linking is observed after treatment with either Cu/Ph or (MTS)2-1 (lanes 2 and 3). Furthermore, treatment with either reagent in the presence of TDG has no effect whatsoever (data not shown). Unremarkably, quantitative cross-linking with both reagents largely inhibits the already low level of lactose transport in the mutant (Fig. 6B). Oxidation with Cu/Ph for the times indicated yield little disulfide formation with this double Cys mutant (Fig. 8A, lane 2), but oxidation in the presence of TDG causes almost quantitative cross-linking (Fig. 8A, lane 3). Correspondingly, Cu/Ph treatment alone has little effect on lactose transport activity, but Cu/Ph treatment in the presence of TDG causes marked inhibition (Fig. 8B). Similarly, (MTS)2-1 treatment alone results in significantly less cross-linking than treatment with the reagent in the presence of TDG, which is quantitative (Fig. 8A, lanes 4 and 5). However, it is remarkable that (MTS)2-1 treatment without or with TDG has no significant effect on transport activity (Fig. 8C). Thus, it is apparent that the activity is critically dependent upon the distance and/or flexibility between helices V and I at this level. Site-directed thiol cross-linking in situ with mutants containing an engineered protease site is a powerful approach for estimating helix packing and probing ligand-induced conformational changes, as cross-linking reactions can be performed before and after interaction with substrate. Availability of a plethora of cross-linking reagents with different arm lengths can also provide valuable information about the distances between interacting residues (see Ref. 24Zhou Y. Guan L. Freites J.A. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 3774-3778Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Additionally, functional analyses can be performed after intra-molecular cross-linking. Here we describe the use of two reagents, the oxidizing agent Cu/Ph and the homo-bifunctional cross-linking agent (MTS)2-1 (3–4 Å) to detect dynamic movements in the periplasmic domains of helices V and I of LacY. In the x-ray crystal structures of LacY (5Guan L. Mirza O. Verner G. Iwata S. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 15294-15298Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 6Abramson J.

EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1177-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), helices V and I in the N-terminal helix bundle are in close contact with helices VII and VIII, respectively, in the C-terminal bundle and play an important role in sealing the inward-facing hydrophilic cavity from the outside (8Smirnova I.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 21561-21566Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). There are four Gly residues in helix V, as well as two Gly and two Pro residues in helix I, and both amino-acyl residues are often associated with conformational changes (55Consler T.G. Tsolas O. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1291-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 56Jung K. Jung H. Colacurcio P. Kaback H.R.

Chem. 2005; 280: 20316-20324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In addition, helix V contains Arg144 and Trp151, which are directly involved in sugar binding and Cys148, which either interacts directly with the galactopyranoside moiety of LacY ligands or is very close to the binding site (see Ref. 3Guan L. Kaback H.R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2006; 35: 67-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Finally, it has been shown that the C154G mutation, which is on the same face of helix V, results in a more compact structure with decreased conformational flexibility, an alteration that specifically blocks the structural changes necessary for substrate translocation with little or no effect on ligand binding (40Smirnova I.N. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3025-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Indeed, isothermal titration calorimetry shows that the C154G mutant binds ligand with slightly better affinity than wild-type LacY, but is restricted conformationally (41Nie Y. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Kaback H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35779-35784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The x-ray structures of C154G LacY demonstrate that helix V crosses helix I about halfway through the thickness of the membrane in such a manner that Cys154 lies close to Gly24 (helix I) (5Guan L. Mirza O. Verner G. Iwata S. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 15294-15298Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 6Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar, 7Mirza O. Guan L. Verner G. Iwata S. Kaback H.R. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1177-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Moreover, replacement of Gly24 with Cys with the C154G mutant results in rescue of ∼80% of wild-type transport activity (46Ermolova N.V. Smirnova I.N. Kasho V.N. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7669-7677Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). But cross-linking induced by Cu/Ph suggests that interaction between a Cys replacement at position 28 and native Cys154 (mutant P28C/C154) is minimal at 0 °C in the presence of TDG, but changing to room temperature increases cross-linking to ∼75% after 5 min and essentially 100% in 10 min (Fig. 5). Pro28, an absolutely conserved residue in the major facilitator superfamily, seems essential for activity because replacement with Ala, Gly, or Leu almost completely abolishes lactose transport (55Consler T.G. Tsolas O. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1291-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, because mutant P28S retains the ability to accumulate TDG to ∼50% of the wild-type level, it is unlikely that a Pro residue per se at this position is irreplaceable with respect to transport (59Overath P. Weigel U. Neuhaus J.M. Soppa J. Seckler R. Riede I. Bocklage H. Müller-Hill B. Aichele G. Wright J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1987; 84: 5535-5539Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Mutant P28C/V158C retains about 60% of Cys-less transport activity and is inactivated by quantitative cross-linking with either Cu/Ph or (MTS)2-1 (Fig. 7). The data are consistent with the interpretation that Val158 (helix V) is proximal to Pro28 (helix I). Although mutant F29C/V158C cross-links to completion with either Cu/Ph or (MTS)2-1 in the presence of TDG (Fig. 8A), significant inactivation of transport activity is observed only after disulfide formation between these Cys residues (Fig. 8B). This finding indicates that ligand binding induces movement between helices V and I so that positions 29 and 158 come into closer proximity. Furthermore, the dramatic difference between the effect of Cu/Ph-catalyzed disulfide formation (-S-S-) versus cross-linking with (MTS)2-1, which introduces a distance of 3–4 Å between the two S atoms of the cross-linked Cys residues (–S-S-CH2-S-S-), on transport activity suggests that a critical distance and/or flexibility is required. This interpretation is supported by the finding that mutant A25C/V158C is cross-linked significantly by (MTS)2-1 in the presence of TDG with no significant effect on activity (Fig. 6A). However, with this mutant, no cross-linking was observed in the presence of Cu/Ph. Site-directed cross-linking depends on the distance of the cross-linking sites, their geometry with respect to each other, and their accessibility to the cross-linking agents. As mentioned, it has been shown by multiple independent biochemical and biophysical methods that the opening probability of the periplasmic cavity depends on the presence of substrate sugar, if sugar is present, LacY preferably adopts an outward-facing conformation. Mapping the cross-linking sites on the solvent-accessible surface of LacY calculated from the inward-open x-ray structure (CAST-p web server, probe size 1.4 Å) in the inward-facing conformation reveals that only P28C/V158C is accessible to the solvent (Fig. 9A). However, in the outward-facing conformation, mutants A25C, P28C, F29C, and V158C are accessible to solvent (Fig. 9B) as calculated from the outward-open model of LacY (16Radestock S. Forrest L.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 407: 698-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). A similar TDG-dependent accessibility pattern for single Cys mutants A25C, P28C, and F29C were also observed with site-directed alkyation (60Ermolova N. Madhvani R.V. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 4182-4189Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The cross-linking data for mutants A25C/V158C, P28C/V158C, and F29C/V158C correlate very well with sugar-dependent opening of the periplasmic cavity. In the absence of TDG, only mutants P28C and V158C are cross-linked because these positions are the only sites in contact with the aqueous phase. Upon ligand binding, Cys replacements at positions 25, 28, and 29 become exposed to the solvent and can be cross-linked with a Cys at position 158. The level of cross-linking by Cu/Ph correlates reasonably well with transport activity. When residues are cross-linked by Cu/Ph, transport is inhibited, but this correlation is not observed with (MTS)2-1, except with mutants P28C/C154 and P28C/V158C. One disulfide bond (-S-S-) between double Cys pairs is formed when an oxidizing agent is present, as long as they are in close proximity. However, when (MTS)2-1 is present, two disulfide bonds are formed (–S-S-CH2-S-S-), and movement is consequently less restricted due to the parallel arrangement of the chemical bonds. Therefore, the functional effects of cross-linking by different reagents at the periplasmic ends of helices V and I argues against rigid-body movement of the two 6-helix bundles during turnover of LacY. It is likely that precise rearrangement between helices V and I within the N-terminal six-helix bundle is critical for completing the transport cycle. In the case of P28C/C154, the level of cross-linking by Cu/Ph is time- and temperature-dependent (Fig. 5). Comparison of cross-linking at 23 and 0 °C provides a qualitative indication of the contribution of backbone dynamics to the reactivity and accessibility of a given Cys residue. The α-C atom distance between Pro28 and Cys154 is ∼11 Å, whereas it is ∼9 Å between Pro28 and Val158. The shorter distance between Pro28 and Val158 results in increased rates of cross-linking induced by Cu/Ph with the P28C/V158C mutant relative to the P28C/C154 mutant (compare Fig. 4C with Fig. 7C). It is not surprising that higher temperatures increase protein backbone movement and the rate of cross-linking. However, it should be emphasized that cross-linking reflects dynamic collisions and chemical reactions between residues, not simply their proximities (61Chervitz S.A. Falke J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 2545-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). For example, Cys pairs that frequently undergo collisions and are highly reactive chemically could form cross-links at relatively rapid rates even though they may be distant in the average structure. However, a strong correlation is expected between collision rates and proximity (61Chervitz S.A. Falke J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 2545-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Cross-linking between paired Cys residues in helices V and I clearly reveals a ligand-induced conformational change at the interface between helices V and I, and a scissors-like movement (46Ermolova N.V. Smirnova I.N. Kasho V.N. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7669-7677Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) probably best explains the available data. Based on the structural observations, an ordered mechanism for the initial step in galactopyranoside/H+ symport has been postulated (7Mirza O. Guan L. Verner G. Iwata S. Kaback H.R. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1177-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In the ligand-free conformation, the irreplaceable residues for substrate binding ((Arg144 (helix V), Glu126 (helix IV), and Glu269 (helix VIII)) are not in the correct configuration to bind substrate. Sugar first recognizes Trp151 (helix V) through nonspecific hydrophobic stacking between the galactopyranosyl and indole rings (62Guan L. Hu Y. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1377-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 63Vázquez-Ibar J.L. Guan L. Svrakic M. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 12706-12711Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This interaction orients the galactopyranosyl moiety for recognition by Arg144, Glu126, and Glu269. Moreover, interaction of sugar with Trp151 is thought to disrupt the salt bridge between Arg144 and Glu126 when strong H-bonding occurs between Arg144 and OH groups on the galactopyranosyl ring (64Sahin-Tóth M. Lawrence M.C. Nishio T. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13015-13019Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The preponderance of the available findings (reviewed in Ref. 3Guan L. Kaback H.R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2006; 35: 67-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) indicates that sugar binding and/or dissociation is the primary driving force for the global conformational change that is central to the alternating access model (reviewed in Ref. 33Kaback H.R. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Nie Y. Zhou Y. J. Membr. Biol. 2011; 239: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems reasonable to suggest that an initiating event involves sugar-induced conformational change(s) in helix V that is transmitted to helix I and then propagated through the remaining helices in LacY in a cooperative manner. We are particularly indebted to Salete Newton for editorial help with the manuscript and Irina Smirnova and Vladimir Kasho for advice and discussions."
https://openalex.org/W1964275132,"NAD kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of NAD(+) to synthesize NADP(+), whereas NADH kinase catalyzes conversion of NADH to NADPH. The mitochondrial protein Pos5 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae shows much higher NADH kinase than NAD kinase activity and is therefore referred to as NADH kinase. To clarify the structural determinant underlying the high NADH kinase activity of Pos5 and its selectivity for NADH over NAD(+), we determined the tertiary structure of Pos5 complexed with NADH at a resolution of 2.0 Å. Detailed analysis, including a comparison of the tertiary structure of Pos5 with the structures of human and bacterial NAD kinases, revealed that Arg-293 of Pos5, corresponding to His-351 of human NAD kinase, confers a positive charge on the surface of NADH-binding site, whereas the corresponding His residue does not. Accordingly, conversion of the Arg-293 into a His residue reduced the ratio of NADH kinase activity to NAD kinase activity from 8.6 to 2.1. Conversely, simultaneous changes of Ala-330 and His-351 of human NAD kinase into Ser and Arg residues significantly increased the ratio of NADH kinase activity to NAD kinase activity from 0.043 to 1.39; human Ala-330 corresponds to Pos5 Ser-272, which interacts with the side chain of Arg-293. Arg-293 and Ser-272 were highly conserved in Pos5 homologs (putative NADH kinases), but not in putative NAD kinases. Thus, Arg-293 of Pos5 is a major determinant of NADH selectivity. Moreover, Ser-272 appears to assist Arg-293 in achieving the appropriate conformation."

Doi T. Spokes K. Beeler D.L. Shih S.C. Okada H. Danilov T.A. Maynard E. Minami T. Oettgen P. Aird W.C. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 1712-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition, a guanine and adenine-binding protein-binding element in the ROBO4 promoter is necessary for endothelial expression in vivo (6Okada Y. Jin E. Nikolova-Krstevski V. Yano K. Liu J.

However, to date little is known regarding transcription factors that are involved in regulating robo4 expression during embryonic vascular development. In this study, we provide evidence for Sox7 and Sox18 transcription factors as regulators of robo4 vascular expression during embryonic development in zebrafish. SoxF genes, namely Sox7, Sox17, and Sox18, play pivotal roles in cardiovascular development including the orchestration of endothelial cell fate and cell differentiation (7Francois M. Koopman P. Beltrame M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2010; 42: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). During embryonic mouse development, Sox7, Sox17, and Sox18 expression is evident in smaller branching vessels and ISVs (8Pennisi D. Bowles J. Nagy A. Muscat G. Koopman P. Mol. Cell.

HUVECs were purchased from Lonza and maintained in endothelial cell basal medium-2 (EBM-2; Lonza) supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS) (2%) and 2 units/ml gentamycin. All HUVEC experiments were performed with cells in passages 3–6. Mouse Robo4 cDNA (probe generation) and human ROBO4 promoter-luciferase construct were kindly provided by Drs. Dean Y. Li (University of Utah) and William Aird (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard). Dr. Monica Beltrame (Universita' degli Studi di Milano, Italy) provided the zebrafish sox7 and sox18 cDNAs. Zebrafish were grown and maintained at 28.5 °C in a 14-h day and 10-h night cycle. Mating was routinely carried out at 28.5 °C, and all embryos were staged according to established protocols. All zebrafish studies were performed under the Medical College of Wisconsin institutional guidelines (Animal Protocol 312-06-2). Zebrafish sox7 and sox18 RNA were transcribed by T7 polymerase from linearized vectors containing the respective inserts in pcDNA3.1. For gain-of-function (GOF) experiments, 50–75 pg of capped RNAs were injected into the embryonic cell (1-cell stage). Digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled antisense RNA probes for fli, and robo4 were generated using a DIG RNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). The MOs used for sox7 and sox18 were from a previous publication (11Cermenati S. Moleri S. Cimbro S. Corti P. Del Giacco L. Amodeo R. Dejana E. Koopman P. Cotelli F. Beltrame M. Blood. 2008; 111: 2657-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and were injected at a dose of 0.25 pmol/embryo. The specificity and efficacy of the MOs used in this study have been reported previously (11Cermenati S. Moleri S. Cimbro S. Corti P. Del Giacco L. Amodeo R. Dejana E. Koopman P. Cotelli F. Beltrame M. Blood. 2008; 111: 2657-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). For sox7 and sox18, chromogenic detection of single transcripts was carried out as described (14Oxtoby E. Jowett T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). For fluorogenic detection of two transcripts in co-expression studies, a DNP-labeled robo4 probe was used together with DIG-labeled sox7 and sox18 probes, respectively. Hybridized probes were visualized using peroxidase conjugated anti-DIG/DNP antibodies (1:1000; Roche Applied Science), FITC- and Cy3 tyramides (1:100) from the TSA system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Pictures were acquired using a Zeiss Observer Z1 inverted microscope (single staining) or a Zeiss LSM 501 confocal microscope. Confocal data were processed with AxioVision 6.8, and linear level adjustment was carried out with Adobe Photoshop CS. Details on double stainings are available upon request. The mouse probe for Robo4 was made as described previously (15Park K.W. Morrison C.M. Sorensen L.K. Jones C.A. Rao Y. Chien C.B. Wu J.Y. Urness L.D. Li D.Y. Dev. Biol. 2003; 261: 251-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Mouse section in situ hybridization was performed on 7-μm sections of paraformaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded embryos. Sections were de-waxed, rehydrated, and incubated in 5 mg/ml proteinase K for 20 min at room temperature. After washing in phosphate buffered saline, sections were refixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, acetylated, and prehybridized with hybridization solution (50% formamide, 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's, 250 mg/ml yeast RNA, 500 mg/ml herring sperm DNA) for 2 h at room temperature. Hybridization (hybridization solution + 0.5 μg/ml probe) was performed overnight at 60 °C. Slides were washed in 5× SSC for 5 min, 0.2× SSC for 1 h at 60 °C, 0.2× SSC for 5 min at room temperature and NT buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) for 5 min at room temperature, before incubating for 2 h with blocking solution (0.5% blocking powder (Roche Applied Science) in NT buffer) in a humidified chamber. Anti-DIG antibody (Roche Applied Science) at a 1:500 dilution in blocking solution was added to the slides and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Unbound antibodies were removed by washing three times in NT buffer supplemented with 0.05% Tween 40 (Sigma). Sections were equilibrated in detection buffer (0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 m NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2) for 15 min at room temperature and incubated with color solution (BM purple; Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Finally, sections were washed 2 × 5 min in phosphate buffered Tween and mounted in 80% glycerol in PBS. Stained sections were examined with an Olympus BX-51 microscope (DP-70 12Mp color camera). Oligonucleotides synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) were used for DNA binding assays. Sequence information is provided in the supplemental Methods. Double-stranded probes were generated by heating equal molar amounts of each of the 5′→3′ oligonucleotide with its respective complementary oligonucleotide at 95 °C for 10 min followed by cooling to room temperature for 1 h. Next, double-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled with DIG-11-ddUTP using recombinant terminal transferase (20 units/ml) in a final volume of 25 μl according to the DIG Gel Shift Kit, Second Generation instructions (Roche Applied Science). EMSA was performed as we have previously described in detail (16Tabatabai N.M. Blumenthal S.S. Petering D.H. Toxicology. 2005; 207: 369-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, DNA binding reactions were set up with 1 μg of nuclear or cytoplasmic proteins (HUVEC passage 3) and 0.08 pmol of the DIG-labeled wild-type or mutant SOX18 probe in our modified DNA binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 0.2% Tween 20, 30 mm KCl) (17Kothinti R.K. Blodgett A.B. Petering D.H. Tabatabai N.M. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2010; 244: 254-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) containing 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 0.1 μg of poly-l-lysine in a final reaction volume of 20 μl. For supershift assays, 2–3 μl of Sox18 antibody (4 μg, EMSA certified; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the nuclear or cytoplasmic proteins prior to addition of the probe. For competition experiments, unlabeled double-stranded SOX18 WT oligonucleotide at final concentrations of 0.08, 0.8, 4.0, 8.0, 16.0, and 32.0 pmol were added simultaneously with 0.08 pmol of DIG-labeled SOX18 WT probe to the binding reaction with 1 μg of nuclear protein. Control reactions were performed with the probe alone. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 15 min after which samples were subjected to electrophoresis on a 6% DNA Retardation Gel (Invitrogen). Blotting on to a positively charged nylon membrane was followed by UV cross-linking. Blots were then incubated with AP-conjugated to anti-DIG antibody followed by addition of substrate disodium 3-chloro-3-(methoxyspiro{1,2-dioxetane-3-2′-(5′-chloro)tricyclo[3.3.3.3]decan}-4-yl) phenyl phosphate, chemiluminescent alkaline phosphatase substrate (CSPD). Fluor Chem HD from Alpha Innotech was used for chemiluminescence detection and quantification of bands was done using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t test with Graph Pad Prism (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) and Microsoft Office Excel 2010 software package. All data are presented as mean ± S.E. (n and p value are provided in each figure or legend). In a microarray transcriptional profile study comparing lymphatic ECs isolated from ragged-opossum (RaOp) mutant mice (RaOp−/− mice) (18François M. Caprini A. Hosking B. Orsenigo F. Wilhelm D. Browne C. Paavonen K. Karnezis T. Shayan R. Downes M. Davidson T. Tutt D. Cheah K.S. Stacker S.A. Muscat G.E. Achen M.G. Dejana E. Koopman P. Nature. 2008; 456: 643-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 19James K. Hosking B. Gardner J. Muscat G.E. Koopman P. Genesis. 2003; 36: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), which carries a mutation in Sox18 to lymphatic ECs obtained from WT mice, we observed an 8.5-fold decrease in Robo4 transcript levels with no detectable change in Robo1 and Robo2 transcript levels detectable. To validate the microarray result, we performed robo4 ISH on embryonic day 10.5 sections of RaOp−/− mice and WT mice. RaOp−/− mice showed diminished robo4 expression in caudal vein ECs (Fig. 1B, white arrowhead) compared with WT mice (Fig. 1A). No change in Robo4 expression was observed in dorsal aorta (DA) EC (Fig. 1A, black arrowhead), suggesting preferential venous loss of Robo4 expression in Sox18 KO mice. These results led us to hypothesize that Sox18 transcription factor affects transcription of Robo4 gene during embryonic vascular development in vivo. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the Sox-mediated transcriptional regulation of robo4 gene in embryonic zebrafish development. In zebrafish, two Sox factors, namely Sox7 and Sox18, show redundant function during embryonic vascular development (11Cermenati S. Moleri S. Cimbro S. Corti P. Del Giacco L. Amodeo R. Dejana E.

Biol. 2008; 317: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We next performed whole mount ISH for sox7 (Fig. 2, A–F) and sox18 (Fig. 2, G–L) in zebrafish embryos ranging from 18 to 27 som compared with robo4 between 19 and 24 som (supplemental Fig. S1, A–C). At 18–19 som, both sox7 (Fig. 2A) and sox18 (Fig. 2G, asterisk) expression was observed in rostral ISV sprouts as they began to emerge and in axial vessel, DA. The robo4 expression at this time point was strong in notochord and was observed in angioblasts (supplemental Fig. S1A). As ISV development progresses, the expression of sox7 (Fig. 2, D–F) and sox18 (Fig. 2, I–L) followed a rostral-caudal temporal pattern resembling the pattern observed previously for robo4 (3Bedell V.M. Yeo S.Y. Park K.W. Chung J. Seth P. Shivalingappa V. Zhao J. Obara T. Sukhatme V.P. Drummond I.A. Li D.Y. Ramchandran R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 6373-6378Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) although the sox expression appears a somite or two early than robo4. We next investigated whether robo4, sox7, and sox18 transcripts were co-expressed in the vasculature during embryonic zebrafish development stages (19–24 som) where robo4 is expressed in ISVs (3Bedell V.M. Yeo S.Y. Park K.W. Chung J. Seth P. Shivalingappa V. Zhao J. Obara T. Sukhatme V.P. Drummond I.A. Li D.Y. Ramchandran R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 6373-6378Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Confocal analysis of two-color fluorescence ISH of the zebrafish trunk regions shows that both sox7 (Fig. 2P) and sox18 (Fig. 2Q) transcripts were co-localized with robo4 transcript in the developing zebrafish vasculature. At this time point (24 hpf), sox7 expression was noticed predominantly in the leading ISV cell (Fig. 2P′) whereas sox18 expression was predominant in the axial vessels and the cell immediately ventral to the ISV leading cell (Fig. 2Q′). Our double ISH analysis clearly shows that both robo4 and individual sox (sox7/sox18) transcripts are co-localized on ISVs. Additional inverted microscope images are provided in supplemental Fig. S2, A–F along with three-dimensional surface rendering of the confocal picture that capture the regions of co-localization (supplemental Fig. S2G). The ISV expression data together suggest that sox7 and sox18 are expressed in the rostral ISV sprouts prior to robo4 and could potentially influence the highly dynamic robo4 ISV expression observed in these stages. Because sox7 and sox18 were expressed prior to robo4 during ISV development, we investigated whether Sox TFs regulated robo4 ISVs expression level in zebrafish. To investigate this question, we utilized the 5′-flanking sequence element of the human ROBO4 promoter, which was already shown to direct EC-specific expression in vivo (5Okada Y. Yano K. Jin E. Funahashi N. Kitayama M. Doi T. Spokes K. Beeler D.L. Shih S.C. Okada H. Danilov T.A. Maynard E. Minami T. Oettgen P. Aird W.C. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 1712-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 6Okada Y. Jin E. Nikolova-Krstevski V. Yano K. Liu J. Beeler D. Spokes K. Kitayama M. Funahashi N. Doi T. Janes L. Minami T. Oettgen P. Aird W.C. Blood. 2008; 112: 2336-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Further, bioinformatic analysis of this promoter indicated the presence of putative Sox18 TF binding consensus sequences (A/TA/TCAAA/TG) between −1170 and −1176 bp, which is conserved in mouse Robo4 promoter between −1339 and −1405 bp as well (supplemental Fig. S1E). We injected the 3-kb human ROBO4 promoter-luciferase construct alone (50 pg) or in combination with sox18 mRNA (50 pg) at 1-cell stage into the embryonic cell and collected embryos at 18–21 som, 21–26 som, 26 som, and 24-prim6 stages for luciferase assays (Fig. 3A), developmental stages in which endogenous robo4 expression is highly dynamic. Embryos from each stage were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity. Remarkably, the exogenous human ROBO4 promoter activity drives luciferase in a pattern reminiscent of endogenous robo4 expression in ISVs. We observed a bell-shaped curve over the time course with maximal reporter activity at around 24–26 som stage and returning to base line at 25 hpf-prim6 stage (Fig. 3A, dotted line). Interestingly, in sox18 mRNA co-injected embryos (Fig. 3A, black line), we found that the ROBO4 promoter activity was increased at all time intervals compared with basal levels (Fig. 3A, diamond bars), in essence replicating the bell-shaped curve of promoter alone injected embryos but with higher luciferase values. Next, we generated four point mutants (SoxPM1, SoxPM2, SoxPM3, SoxPM4) (supplemental Fig. S1E) that had single nucleotide (SoxPM1–3) or multiple nucleotide (SoxPM4) substitutions at the putative Sox18 binding site in the ROBO4 promoter. These constructs were individually transfected in HUVECs (Fig. 3B), and their activity was compared with WT human ROBO4 promoter (supplemental Fig. S1D). All constructs were transfected via electroporation or Lipofectamine 2000 into HUVEC cells, and luciferase assays were performed from HUVEC lysates. Interestingly, two (SoxPM1 and SoxPM3) of the three point mutants in addition to SoxPM4 showed reduction in luciferase output (Fig. 3B), indicating that the putative Sox binding site on −1169 bp site is responsible in part for ROBO4 promoter activity in ECs. All groups except SoxPM2 were statistically significant (p < 0.05) compared with the WT human ROBO4 promoter group. To investigate whether the endogenous Sox7 or Sox18 proteins are responsible for the ROBO4 promoter activity observed in human ECs, we utilized sox7 or sox18 gene-specific efficacy-confirmed siRNAs (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (supplemental Fig. S2I) to knock down endogenous Sox proteins and measured luciferase activity output of the hROBO4 promoter. The luciferase activity is greatly reduced from the ROBO4 promoter co-transfected with Sox7/18 double siRNA sample compared with ROBO4 promoter-luciferase construct alone (Fig. 3C, p < 0.05). To determine conclusively whether Sox7/18 proteins bind to putative Sox binding site in ROBO4 promoter, we performed an EMSA (Fig. 3D) with nuclear extracts from ECs using a WT ROBO4 promoter oligonucleotide probe and Sox18 mutant ROBO4 promoter oligonucleotide probes (M1 and M2). As observed in the EMSA blot, the nuclear proteins from HUVECs in the WT probe lane clearly formed two complexes: complex 1 (slower migrating) and complex 2 (faster migrating) band (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, the M1 mutant ROBO4 promoter oligonucleotide probe also showed the presence of the two complexes albeit of lower intensity (Fig. 3D, M1 lane). Because the M1 mutant probe has additional Sox18 binding sites, which likely serves as alternate site for interaction, we generated a second mutant probe M2, where we mutated this site (for mutant probe sequences, see supplemental Methods). Clearly, the M2 probe shows lower intensities in complex 2 (Fig. 3D, M2 lane). When the complex intensities in M1 and M2 probe lanes for nuclear protein extracts (N) were compared across three independent experiments with WT probe bands, we noticed a 70 and 90% decrease in complex 1 (M1: *, p < 0.001; M2: **, p < 0.0005), and a 50 and 70% decrease in complex 2 (M1: #, p < 0.001; M2: ##, p < 0.005) for M1 and M2 probes (Fig. 3E). The M2 probe showed lower intensities for both complexes compared with the M1 probe. Both complexes also showed a dose-dependent reduction in intensity when unlabeled competitor probes was included in the EMSA reaction (supplemental Fig. S3B). To determine whether SOX18 protein was present in the shifted complexes, we performed supershift assays with SOX18 antibody (Fig. 3D, Ab lane). Supershift results indicated the presence of SOX18 in both complex 1 (black arrow), and 2 (gray arrow) (Fig. 3D, lanes N and Ab). In addition, when binding reactions with the mutant (M1, data not shown) and WT probes (Fig. 3D, lane +SOX18 Ab) were performed in the presence of SOX18 antibody, the complex 1 band completely disappeared in WT probe lane (data not shown for M1), and the intensity of the complex 2 band decreased by 49 and 65% in reactions with M1 and WT probes, respectively. Collectively, these data suggest that Sox18 is part of the complex that binds to ROBO4 promoter sequences and, in addition other co-factors may also be responsible in part for ROBO4 promoter activity in ECs. Taking the in vivo human ROBO4 promoter activity across ISV development, the ability of Sox18 to induce the ROBO4 promoter robustly in vivo, point mutation analysis and Sox siRNA experiments in vitro, and the EMSA analysis data together we conclude that Sox7/18 are responsible in part for inducing ROBO4 promoter activity in ECs in vivo and in vitro. To investigate whether endogenous robo4 expression is modulated by Sox transcription factors, we performed GOF and LOF for sox7 and sox18 in zebrafish embryos. For GOF experiments, we injected sox7 or sox18 mRNA alone or in combination into 1-cell embryo and checked robo4 expression by ISH at 26–28 hpf. The robo4 ISV expression is enhanced in sox7 + sox18 mRNA (Fig. 4E, white asterisk)-injected embryos compared with sox7 (Fig. 4B) or sox18 (Fig. 4C) or control mRNA (Fig. 4D) alone injected embryos at 24 hpf, which suggests co-operative interaction between the two factors in inducing robo4 ISV expression. Conversely, in LOF experiments, double knockdown of sox18/sox7 using MOs resulted in a diminished robo4 expression at 24 hpf (Fig. 4G) and 26 hpf (Fig. 4I) compared with control MO (Fig. 4, F and H) injected embryos. At 24 hpf, 40 of 42 (95%) sox18/sox7 double knockdown embryos show the phenotype depicted in Fig. 4G. At 26 hpf, 26 of 27 double morphants showed diminished robo4 expression (Fig. 4I). Interestingly, the diminished expression was selectively observed in the ISVs (Fig. 4G, black arrowhead) with little to no qualitative change detected in the neural tube (Fig. 4, G and F, NT, red arrowhead). We also checked fli1a expression in control MO (Fig. 4, J and L) and sox7/18 double MO injected (Fig. 4, K and M) 24 or 26 hpf embryos and observed no change (Figs. 4, J and K, black asterisk) in control (21 embryos) and double morphants (32 embryos), suggesting specificity of Sox regulation of robo4 ISV expression. Further, quantitative PCR for robo4 and robo1 transcripts in Sox knockdown embryos shows selective down-regulation of robo4 versus robo1 transcripts (supplemental Fig. S3C). This also suggests some level of Robo specificity for Sox-mediated transcriptional regulation during development. Because robo4 expression is also observed prior to 24 hpf in nonvascular tissues such as neural tube (NT) and notochord, we investigated the effect of sox7 or sox18 or double (sox7 + sox18) mRNA-injected embryos for robo4 transcript expression at 18 hpf (supplemental Fig. S4). At 18 hpf, little to no change was observed in robo4 expression in notochord. However, in NT (supplemental Fig. S4, B–D, black asterisk) and midbrain-hindbrain boundary (supplemental Fig. S4, B–D, red arrow), we observed an expansion in the robo4 expression domain in sox7 (supplemental Fig. S4B) or sox18 (supplemental Fig. S4C) or sox7 + sox18 (supplemental Fig. S4D) mRNA-injected embryos. Quantitation shows >60% of injected embryos show strong overall robo4 induction qualitatively in midbrain-hindbrain boundary and NT (supplemental Fig. S4E) at 18 hpf. This result is not totally unexpected because Sox proteins are well known to function in neural development (20Cheung M. Briscoe J. Development. 2003; 130: 5681-5693Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 21Honoré S.M. Aybar M.J. Mayor R. Dev. Biol. 2003; 260: 79-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). At 24 hpf, quantitation was performed for robo4 induction in ISVs (supplemental Fig. S4F). The Sox GOF and LOF results when taken together show complementary changes in robo4 ISV expression in vivo, which is in agreement with the redundant function of Sox7 and Sox18 function in zebrafish vascular development (11Cermenati S. Moleri S. Cimbro S. Corti P. Del Giacco L. Amodeo R. Dejana E. Koopman P. Cotelli F. Beltrame M. Blood. 2008; 111: 2657-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Taking the mouse data together from Fig. 1, these data also suggest that Sox-mediated transcriptional regulation of Robo4 is conserved across evolution. This study identifies members of the Sox protein transcription factor family as putative regulators of Robo4 gene expression in vivo. The primary findings of this study include the following: (i) early temporal expression of sox7 and sox18 transcripts in DA prior to robo4 expression; (ii) remarkably conserved human ROBO4 promoter activity in its behavior in zebrafish, correlating well with vascular robo4 expression pattern in vivo; (iii) polar regulation of robo4 expression via Sox in zebrafish and mice; (iv) Sox7 and Sox18 along with temporal and spatial specific co-factors in regulation of robo4 transcript expression in the vasculature. Whole mount ISH for sox7 and sox18 during zebrafish ISV development shows a preponderance of sox7 transcript in the tip of the leading sprout and sox18 transcript in the base of the sprout with prominent expression in axial vessels. Further, both sox7 and sox18 transcripts appear in the rostral sprouts earlier than robo4 expression, suggesting regulatory mechanisms of Sox and Robo in ISV sprouting process. In terms of robo4, ISV expression is tightly controlled across a short temporal window, and the expression is observed along the length of the entire sprout as well as the DA. These data argue that different Robo-Sox combinations are involved in ISV cell development in vivo. Perhaps Robo4 and Sox7 in the tip and Robo4 and Sox18 in the base of the sprout function together to direct and maintain ISV sprout formation. Whether the expression levels of sox transcripts correlate with protein expression and function is not known. Interestingly, the polar distribution of sox transcripts in zebrafish ISVs suggests polar regulation of robo4 transcript, which is curiously observed in mice. The Robo4 expression in RaOp mutant mice is selectively down-regulated in vein but not in artery, suggesting selective regulatory function of Sox-mediated Robo4 induction in vein. It is worthwhile to note that the site of Robo4 expression in vein is the area where emergence of Sox18-mediated lymphatic Prox1+ cells is noted (22Srinivasan R.S. Geng X. Yang Y. Wang Y. Mukatira S. Studer M. Porto M.P. Lagutin O. Oliver G. Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 696-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), postulating a role of Robo4 in lymphatic ECs cell directional sprouting. Because lymphatic ECs derive from venous ECs (23Srinivasan R.S. Dillard M.E. Lagutin O.V. Lin F.J. Tsai S. Tsai M.J. Samokhvalov I.M. Oliver G. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2422-2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) it is tempting to speculate that the selective regulation of Sox-mediated Robo4 induction in venous ECs is potentially the event that triggers the directional migration of Prox1 LECs from vein. In terms of evolution, both mouse and human ROBO4 promoter share a Sox18 binding site proximal to the start site (−1170 in human and −1339 in mouse). Because robo4 ISV expression is dynamically controlled across a short temporal window (18–29 hpf), this would suggest tight control of ROBO4 promoter activity during this time frame. In fact, a previously published 3-kb human ROBO4 promoter (5Okada Y. Yano K. Jin E. Funahashi N. Kitayama M. Doi T. Spokes K. Beeler D.L. Shih S.C. Okada H. Danilov T.A. Maynard E. Minami T.

Doi T. Janes L. Minami T. Oettgen P. Aird W.C. Blood. 2008; 112: 2336-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) that shows endothelial-restricted expression in mice behaves similarly in zebrafish across the short temporal window of robo4 ISV expression. This remarkable correlative behavior is enhanced when exogenous sox18 mRNA is provided and is diminished when the Sox18 binding site is mutated. Although the ROBO4 promoter activity is not lost completely in the absence of Sox18 binding site, which is expected because other sites on the promoter such as guanine and adenine-binding protein-binding element has also been shown previously to be necessary for endothelial expression in vivo (6Okada Y. Jin E. Nikolova-Krstevski V. Yano K. Liu J. Beeler D. Spokes K. Kitayama M. Funahashi N. Doi T. Janes L. Minami T. Oettgen P. Aird W.C. Blood. 2008; 112: 2336-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In fact, at least three pieces of distinct experimental evidence point to the role of co-factors that participate with Sox in regulating robo4 ISV expression. (i) Mutation of Sox binding site on ROBO4 promoter (Fig. 3B) does not result in complete loss of ROBO4 promoter activity in ECs. (ii) The EMSA study shows that Sox18 mutant probe (M1) clearly binds to non-Sox nuclear proteins, which is not blocked by Sox18 antibody (data not shown). (iii) Sox GOF single mRNA and double mRNA-injected embryos (Fig. 4, A–D) show differential robo4 transcript regulation at 18 hpf (individual Soxs and double Soxs) (supplemental Fig. S4) and 24 hpf (only double Soxs) (Fig. 4) presumably mediated by different sets of co-factors expressed at these time points during embryonic development. The 24 hpf double mRNA data are in agreement with redundant function of Soxs in vascular development in zebrafish (11Cermenati S. Moleri S. Cimbro S. Corti P. Del Giacco L. Amodeo R. Dejana E.

In this study, we provide convincing data in three species, each of which independently provides evidence that Sox transcription factors putatively regulate robo4 gene expression. In each of these systems there is ample published evidence of conservation of the molecular mechanisms of vascular development for Sox and Robo (3Bedell V.M. Yeo S.Y. Park K.W. Chung J. Seth P.

In addition, the genes investigated in our study are well conserved at the sequence level between the species. In sum, the presented zebrafish, mouse, and human EC data make a substantive body of evidence for conservation of this observation in development. This study for the first time provides a molecular link between Sox and Robo family in vascular development, a paradigm recently shared by another axon guidance gene of the ephrin-Eph family (25Parrinello S.

https://openalex.org/W2033066274,"Degeneration of corpus callosum appears in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) before clinical signs of upper motor neuron death. Considering the ALS-associated impairment of astrocytic glutamate uptake, we have characterized the expression and activity of the glutamate transporter isoforms GLT-1a and GLT-1b in the corpus callosum of transgenic rats expressing a mutated form of the human superoxide dismutase 1 (hSOD1(G93A)). We have also studied the effect of peptide histidine isoleucine (PHI), a vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)/pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) receptor 2 (VPAC(2)) agonist on glutamate transporters both in vivo and in callosal astrocytes. Before the onset of motor symptoms, the expression of both transporter isoforms was correlated with a constitutive activity of caspase-3. This enzyme participates in the down-regulation of GLT-1 in ALS, and here we demonstrated its involvement in the selective degradation of GLT-1a in the white matter. A single stereotactic injection of PHI into the corpus callosum of symptomatic rats decreased caspase-3 activity and promoted GLT-1a expression and uptake activity. Together, with evidence for a reduced expression of prepro-VIP/PHI mRNA in the corpus callosum of transgenic animals, these data shed light on the modulatory role of the VIP/PHI system on the glutamatergic transmission in ALS."

Caregivers of 1543 children who were 6-59 months of age at the time of the SIAN, 17 community-based volunteers and 45 health center staff members were interviewed.A total of 1278 children 6-59 months (83% of those studied) reportedly participated in SIAN. Of the participating children, 1258 received vitamin A (98% of SIAN participants; 82% of all eligible children), 945 received anti-helminth tablets (84% of participants; 71% of eligibles), and 669 were screened for acute malnutrition (52% of participants; 43% of eligibles). 186 of the children screened (27%) were reportedly identified as acutely malnourished. SIAN screening covered a significantly greater proportion of children than were examined in both community-based (22% of children) and health center-based screening activities (5% of children) combined during the 4-5 months after the SIAN (P<0.0001). In general, community volunteers and health personnel positively evaluated their experience adding MUAC screening to SIAN.Integrating MUAC screening for acute malnutrition in SIAN permits the assessment of a large number of children for acute malnutrition, and should be continued."
https://openalex.org/W2091551825,"Background Emerging evidence of histopathological analyses suggests that endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) play an important role in vascular diseases. Neointimal hyperplasia can be reduced by intravenous transfusion of EPCs after vascular injury in mice. Therefore, it would be advantageous to develop an in vivo technique that can explore the temporal and spatial migration of EPCs homing to the damaged endothelium noninvasively. Methodology/Principal Findings The left carotid common artery (LCCA) was injured by removal of endothelium with a flexible wire in Kunming mice. EPCs were collected by in vitro culture of spleen-derived mouse mononuclear cells (MNCs). EPCs labeling was carried out in vitro using Fe2O3-poly-L-lysine (Fe2O3-PLL). In vivo serial MR imaging was performed to follow-up the injured artery at different time points after intravenous transfusion of EPCs. Vessel wall areas of injured artery were computed on T2WI. Larger MR signal voids of vessel wall on T2WI was revealed in all 6 mice of the labeled EPC transfusion group 15 days after LCCA injury, and it was found only in 1 mouse in the unlabeled EPC transfusion group (p = 0.015). Quantitative analyses of vessel wall areas on T2WI showed that the vessel wall areas of labeled EPC transfusion group were less than those of unlabeled EPC transfusion group and control group fifteen days after artery injury (p<0.05). Histopathological analyses confirmed accumulation and distribution of transfused EPCs at the injury site of LCCA. Conclusions/Significance These data indicate that MR imaging might be used as an in vivo method for the tracking of EPCs homing to the endothelium injured artery."
