https://openalex.org/W2045048386,The efficiency of thermoelectric energy converters is limited by the material thermoelectric figure of merit ( zT ). The recent advances in zT based on nanostructures limiting the phonon heat conduction is nearing a fundamental limit: The thermal conductivity cannot be reduced below the amorphous limit. We explored enhancing the Seebeck coefficient through a distortion of the electronic density of states and report a successful implementation through the use of the thallium impurity levels in lead telluride (PbTe). Such band structure engineering results in a doubling of zT in p -type PbTe to above 1.5 at 773 kelvin. Use of this new physical principle in conjunction with nanostructuring to lower the thermal conductivity could further enhance zT and enable more widespread use of thermoelectric systems.

Of the 704 species that could be assigned conservation status, 32.8% are in categories with elevated risk of extinction. Declines in abundance are associated with bleaching and diseases driven by elevated sea surface temperatures, with extinction risk further exacerbated by local-scale anthropogenic disturbances. The proportion of corals threatened with extinction has increased dramatically in recent decades and exceeds that of most terrestrial groups. The Caribbean has the largest proportion of corals in high extinction risk categories, whereas the Coral Triangle (western Pacific) has the highest proportion of species in all categories of elevated extinction risk. Our results emphasize the widespread plight of coral reefs and the urgent need to enact conservation measures."

Stereotypes that girls and women lack mathematical ability persist and are widely held by parents and teachers.

Many components of the BR signaling pathway have been identified and studied in detail. However, the substrate of BRI1 kinase that transduces the signal to downstream components remains unknown. Proteomic studies of plasma membrane proteins lead to the identification of three homologous BR-signaling kinases (BSK1, BSK2, and BSK3). The BSKs are phosphorylated by BRI1 in vitro and interact with BRI1 in vivo. Genetic and transgenic studies demonstrate that the BSKs represent a small family of kinases that activate BR signaling downstream of BRI1. These results demonstrate that BSKs are the substrates of BRI1 kinase that activate downstream BR signal transduction."

We present a crystal structure of [Fe]-hydrogenase at 1.75 angstrom resolution, showing a mononuclear iron coordinated by the sulfur of cysteine 176, two carbon monoxide (CO) molecules, and the sp 2 -hybridized nitrogen of a 2-pyridinol compound with back-bonding properties similar to those of cyanide. The three-dimensional arrangement of the ligands is similar to that of thiolate, CO, and cyanide ligated to the low-spin iron in binuclear [NiFe]- and [FeFe]-hydrogenases, although the enzymes have evolved independently and the CO and cyanide ligands are not found in any other metalloenzyme. The related iron ligation pattern of hydrogenases exemplifies convergent evolution and presumably plays an essential role in H 2 activation. This finding may stimulate the ongoing synthesis of catalysts that could substitute for platinum in applications such as fuel cells."
https://openalex.org/W2136908857,"Magnetospheric substorms explosively release solar wind energy previously stored in Earth's magnetotail, encompassing the entire magnetosphere and producing spectacular auroral displays. It has been unclear whether a substorm is triggered by a disruption of the electrical current flowing across the near-Earth magnetotail, at â¼10 R E ( R E : Earth radius, or 6374 kilometers), or by the process of magnetic reconnection typically seen farther out in the magnetotail, at â¼20 to 30 R E . We report on simultaneous measurements in the magnetotail at multiple distances, at the time of substorm onset. Reconnection was observed at 20 R E , at least 1.5 minutes before auroral intensification, at least 2 minutes before substorm expansion, and about 3 minutes before near-Earth current disruption. These results demonstrate that substorms are likely initiated by tail reconnection."
https://openalex.org/W2028823240,"The Ordovician Period, long considered a supergreenhouse state, saw one of the greatest radiations of life in Earth's history. Previous temperature estimates of up to approximately 70 degrees C have spawned controversial speculation that the oxygen isotopic composition of seawater must have evolved over geological time. We present a very different global climate record determined by ion microprobe oxygen isotope analyses of Early Ordovician-Silurian conodonts. This record shows a steady cooling trend through the Early Ordovician reaching modern equatorial temperatures that were sustained throughout the Middle and Late Ordovician. This favorable climate regime implies not only that the oxygen isotopic composition of Ordovician seawater was similar to that of today, but also that climate played an overarching role in promoting the unprecedented increases in biodiversity that characterized this period."
https://openalex.org/W1979298341,"Replicated chromosomes are held together by the chromosomal cohesin complex from the time of their synthesis in S phase onward. This requires the replication fork–associated acetyl transferase Eco1, but Eco1's mechanism of action is not known. We identified spontaneous suppressors of the thermosensitive eco1-1 allele in budding yeast. An acetylation-mimicking mutation of a conserved lysine in cohesin's Smc3 subunit makes Eco1 dispensable for cell growth, and we show that Smc3 is acetylated in an Eco1-dependent manner during DNA replication to promote sister chromatid cohesion. A second set of eco1-1 suppressors inactivate the budding yeast ortholog of the cohesin destabilizer Wapl. Our results indicate that Eco1 modifies cohesin to stabilize sister chromatid cohesion in parallel with a cohesion establishment reaction that is in principle Eco1-independent."
https://openalex.org/W2021859989,"Chromosome segregation, transcriptional regulation, and repair of DNA double-strand breaks require the cohesin protein complex. Cohesin holds the replicated chromosomes (sister chromatids) together to mediate sister chromatid cohesion. The mechanism of how cohesion is established is unknown. We found that in budding yeast, the head domain of the Smc3p subunit of cohesin is acetylated by the Eco1p acetyltransferase at two evolutionarily conserved residues, promoting the chromatin-bound cohesin to tether sister chromatids. Smc3p acetylation is induced in S phase after the chromatin loading of cohesin and is suppressed in G 1 and G 2 /M. Smc3 head acetylation and its cell cycle regulation provide important insights into the biology and mechanism of cohesion establishment."
https://openalex.org/W2065278356,"Membrane and secretory proteins cotranslationally enter and are folded in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Misfolded or unassembled proteins are discarded by a process known as ER-associated degradation (ERAD), which involves their retrotranslocation into the cytosol. ERAD substrates frequently contain disulfide bonds that must be cleaved before their retrotranslocation. Here, we found that an ER-resident protein ERdj5 had a reductase activity, cleaved the disulfide bonds of misfolded proteins, and accelerated ERAD through its physical and functional associations with EDEM (ER degradation–enhancing α-mannosidase–like protein) and an ER-resident chaperone BiP. Thus, ERdj5 is a member of a supramolecular ERAD complex that recognizes and unfolds misfolded proteins for their efficient retrotranslocation."
https://openalex.org/W2027891004,"Ribonucleoprotein complexes consisting of Argonaute-like proteins and small regulatory RNAs function in a wide range of biological processes. Many of these small regulatory RNAs are predicted to act, at least in part, within the nucleus. We conducted a genetic screen to identify factors essential for RNA interference (RNAi) in nuclei of Caenorhabditis elegans and identified the Argonaute protein NRDE-3. In the absence of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), NRDE-3 resides in the cytoplasm. NRDE-3 binds siRNAs generated by RNA-dependent RNA polymerases acting on messenger RNA templates in the cytoplasm and redistributes to the nucleus. Nuclear redistribution of NRDE-3 requires a functional nuclear localization signal, is required for nuclear RNAi, and results in NRDE-3 association with nuclear-localized nascent transcripts. Thus, specific Argonaute proteins can transport specific classes of small regulatory RNAs to distinct cellular compartments to regulate gene expression."

https://openalex.org/W2053193410,"Seventy-five years after its invention, transmission electron microscopy has taken a great step forward with the introduction of aberration-corrected electron optics. An entirely new generation of instruments enables studies in condensed-matter physics and materials science to be performed at atomic-scale resolution. These new possibilities are meeting the growing demand of nanosciences and nanotechnology for the atomic-scale characterization of materials, nanosynthesized products and devices, and the validation of expected functions. Equipped with electron-energy filters and electron-energy-loss spectrometers, the new instruments allow studies not only of structure but also of elemental composition and chemical bonding. The energy resolution is about 100 milli-electron volts, and the accuracy of spatial measurements has reached a few picometers. However, understanding the results is generally not straightforward and only possible with extensive quantum-mechanical computer calculations."
https://openalex.org/W2147461641,"The visual (retinoid) cycle is a fundamental metabolic process in vertebrate retina responsible for production of 11-cis-retinal, the chromophore of rhodopsin and cone pigments. 11-cis-Retinal is bound to opsins, forming visual pigments, and when the resulting visual chromophore 11-cis-retinylidene is photoisomerized to all-trans-retinylidene, all-trans-retinal is released from these receptors. Toxic byproducts of the visual cycle formed from all-trans-retinal often are associated with lipofuscin deposits in the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), but it is not clear whether aberrant reactions of the visual cycle participate in RPE atrophy, leading to a rapid onset of retinopathy. Here we report that mice lacking both the ATP-binding cassette transporter 4 (Abca4) and enzyme retinol dehydrogenase 8 (Rdh8), proteins critical for all-trans-retinal clearance from photoreceptors, developed severe RPE/photoreceptor dystrophy at an early age. This phenotype includes lipofuscin, drusen, and basal laminar deposits, Bruch's membrane thickening, and choroidal neovascularization. Importantly, the severity of visual dysfunction and retinopathy was exacerbated by light but attenuated by treatment with retinylamine, a visual cycle inhibitor that slows the flow of all-trans-retinal through the visual cycle. These findings provide direct evidence that aberrant production of toxic condensation byproducts of the visual cycle in mice can lead to rapid, progressive retinal degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2064422480,"The need to broaden research directed at answering fundamental questions in HIV vaccine discovery through laboratory, nonhuman primate (NHP), and clinical research has recently been emphasized. In addition, the importance of attracting and retaining young researchers, developing better NHP models, and more closely linking NHP and clinical research is being stressed. In an era of a level budget for biomedical research at the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), HIV/AIDS vaccine research efforts will need to be carefully prioritized such that resources to energize HIV vaccine discovery can be identified. This article summarizes progress and challenges in HIV vaccine research, the priorities arising from a recent summit at NIAID, and the actions needed, some already under way, to address those priorities."

https://openalex.org/W2163458101,"The only supernovae (SNe) to show gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) or early x-ray emission thus far are overenergetic, broad-lined type Ic SNe (hypernovae, HNe). Recently, SN 2008D has shown several unusual features: (i) weak x-ray flash (XRF), (ii) an early, narrow optical peak, (iii) disappearance of the broad lines typical of SN Ic HNe, and (iv) development of helium lines as in SNe Ib. Detailed analysis shows that SN 2008D was not a normal supernova: Its explosion energy (E approximately 6x10(51) erg) and ejected mass [ approximately 7 times the mass of the Sun (M(middle dot in circle))] are intermediate between normal SNe Ibc and HNe. We conclude that SN 2008D was originally a approximately 30 M(middle dot in circle) star. When it collapsed, a black hole formed and a weak, mildly relativistic jet was produced, which caused the XRF. SN 2008D is probably among the weakest explosions that produce relativistic jets. Inner engine activity appears to be present whenever massive stars collapse to black holes."

Fungal cutinases have been extensively studied, however, reports on bacterial cutinases have been limited due to the lack of knowledge concerning the identity of their open reading frames. In the present study, the cutinase from Thermobifida fusca was induced by cutin and purified to homogeneity by following p-nitrophenyl butyrate hydrolyzing activity. Peptide mass fingerprinting analysis of the wild-type enzyme matched two proteins, Tfu_0883 and Tfu_0882, which are 93% identical in sequence. Both proteins were cloned and overexpressed in their mature form. Recombinant Tfu_0883 and Tfu_0882 display very similar enzymatic properties and were confirmed to be cutinases by their capability to hydrolyze the ester bonds of cutin. Comparative characterization of Fusarium solani pisi and T. fusca cutinases indicated that they have similar substrate specificity and catalytic properties except that the T. fusca enzymes are thermally more stable. Homology modeling revealed that T. fusca cutinases adopt an α/β-hydrolase fold that exhibits both similarities and variations from the fungal cutinase structure. A serine hydrolase catalytic mechanism involving a Ser170-His248-Asp216 (Tfu_0883 numbering) catalytic triad was supported by active site-directed inhibition studies and mutational analyses.

This is the first report of cutinase encoding genes from bacterial sources. Cutin is a major component of the plant cuticle. It is an insoluble lipid-polyester formed primarily from C16 and C18 hydroxy and epoxy fatty acids (Fig. 1) (1Fett W.F. Gerard H.C. Moreau R.A. Osman S.F. Jones L.E. Appl. Environ.

They catalyze the cleavage of ester bonds of cutin, resulting in the release of cutin monomers (5Ferreira B.S. Calado C.R. van Keulen F. Fonseca L.P. Cabral J.M. da Fonseca M.M. Appl. Microbiol.

Cutinase from F. solani pisi, for example, has been extensively investigated by biochemical and structural approaches (13Cunha M.T. Costa M.J. Calado C.R. Fonseca L.P. Aires-Barros M.R. Cabral J.M.

Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 1015-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).

There are a few reports of bacterial cutinases from Streptomyces scabies (19Lin T.S. Kolattukudy P.E. Plant Pathol. 1980; 17: 1-15Google Scholar), Thermobifida fusca (20Fett W.F. Wijey C. Moreau R.A.

Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 131-136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, these studies were limited to screening of enzyme-producing strains and initial characterization on crude enzyme preparations. Most critically, no cutinase open reading frame has been identified in bacteria, thus it is impossible to obtain sufficient amounts of pure recombinant enzymes for in depth studies. In the present study, for the first time, the gene responsible for the expression of bacterial cutinase was identified. Two cutin-induced wild-type pNPB hydrolases were isolated from T. fusca. Peptide mass fingerprinting and data base search of these hydrolases revealed that they are encoded by open reading frames, Tfu_0882 and Tfu_0883, respectively. The two enzymes are 93% identical in amino acid sequence. The mature forms of both enzymes were cloned, expressed, and purified to homogeneity, and were confirmed to function as cutinase. The biochemical properties of T. fusca cutinases were investigated and compared with their F. solani pisi counterpart. Molecular modeling, inhibition studies, and mutational analysis shed light on the mechanism and key residues in catalysis. Materials—A Bacillus subtilis strain harboring the plasmid pBSMuL3 containing the F. solani pisi cutinase was kindly provided by Dr. Thorsten Eggert. The EZ-10 Spin Column Plasmid Mini-Preps kit, agarose gel DNA purification kit, restriction enzymes, and T4 DNA ligase were obtained from TakaRa Biotechnology Co. Ltd. The plasmids pMD18T-simple and pET20b(+) were obtained from Novagen. Sodium taurodeoxycholate, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), bis-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide, pNPB, and Pseudomonas sp. MIS38 lipase (PsL) were obtained from Sigma. Other chemicals were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. Phenyl-Sepharose FF and DEAE-Sepharose FF resins were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Cellulase and pectinase were obtained from Wuxi Boli Biotechnologies Co. Ltd. DNA primers were synthesized by Shanghai Sangon Biological Engineering Technology & Services Co. Ltd. DNA sequencing was performed by Shanghai Generay Biotechnology Co. Ltd. Culture of T. fusca—The T. fusca strain is from laboratory stock. The cells were grown at 50 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. The seed medium (pH 8.0) contained 20 g/liter soluble starch, 10 g/liter beef extract, 5 g/liter yeast extract, 2 g/liter K2HPO4, and 5 g/liter NaCl. The fermentation medium (pH 8.0) contained 7.5 g/liter sodium acetate, 5 g/liter peptone, 7.5 g/liter yeast extract, 2 g/liter K2HPO4, 5 g/liter NaCl, and 1 g/liter cutin. Isolation and Purification of a Cutin-induced pNPB Hydrolase from T. fusca—Cells were removed from the cutin-induced culture by centrifugation (40,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C). Solid (NH4)2SO4 was slowly added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 70% (w/v). The precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation (40,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C), immediately dissolved in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and dialyzed against 2 liters of buffer A at 4 °C overnight. Solid (NH4)2SO4 was added to the dialyzed sample to a final concentration of 20% (w/v). The sample was filtered (0.22 μm) and loaded onto a phenyl HP-Sepharose FF column pre-equilibrated with 20% (NH4)2SO4 in buffer A. A reverse gradient from 20 to 0% (NH4)2SO4 in buffer A was applied at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min over a 60-min period. The fractions containing pNPB hydrolase activity, which was assayed as described below, were pooled and dialyzed against 1 liter of buffer A overnight. The dialyzed sample was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose FF column pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The column was eluted at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min using a linear gradient of 0 to 1 m NaCl in buffer A over 100 min. The fractions containing pNPB hydrolase activity were pooled and dialyzed against 1 liter of buffer A overnight. The final preparation was concentrated by ultrafiltration (Centriprep YM-10 concentrator) to 1 mg/ml, and stored at –80 °C. Peptide Mass Fingerprinting Analysis and N-terminal Amino Acid Sequencing—The protein band corresponding to the cutin-induced pNPB hydrolase was excised from the SDS-PAGE gel and subjected to peptide mass fingerprinting analysis and N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Peptide mass finger-printing analysis was performed by the Proteomics solution I system and the N-terminal residues were sequenced with Edman method by Applied Biosystems model 492cLC protein sequencer. Both analyses were performed by Shanghai Gene Core BioTechnologies Co. Ltd. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Tfu_0882 and Tfu_0883—The genes encoding the mature forms of Tfu_0882 (NCBI accession number YP_288943) and Tfu_0883 (NCBI accession number YP_288944) were amplified from T. fusca genomic DNA by standard polymerase chain reaction methodologies using Taq DNA polymerase. Because the N- and C-terminal nucleotide sequences of the two genes are identical, the same primers were utilized. The forward primer was GGAATACCATATGTCCATGGCCAACCCCTACGAGCGCGG (NcoI underlined), and the reverse primer was CATCTCGAGAGAATTCGGGAACGGGCAGGTGGAGCG (EcoRI underlined). The amplification product was isolated and ligated into the vector pMD18T-simple. The ligation mixture was used to transform chemically competent Escherichia coli JM109 cells. The plasmid isolated from these transformants was verified by restriction analysis and the gene sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmids with the correct sequences of Tfu_0882 and Tfu_0883 were named Tfu_0882-pMD18T and Tfu_0883-pMD18T, respectively. Because both genes contain one internal NcoI site, site-directed mutagenesis was performed to eliminate these sites while keeping the encoded amino acid unchanged. The resulting plasmids were digested with NcoI and EcoRI and ligated into the similarly restriction-digested expression vector pET20b(+). The ligation mixture was used to transform chemically competent E. coli JM109 cells. The plasmid isolated from these transformants was verified by restriction analysis and the gene sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmid with the correct sequence, pET20b-Tfu_0882 or pET20b-Tfu_0883, was used to transform chemically competent E. coli BL21 Rossetta (DE3) PlysS cells. The E. coli Rossetta (DE3) pLysS cells harboring pET20b-Tfu_0883 were grown in TB medium containing ampicillin (100 mg/liter) and chloramphenicol (50 mg/liter) at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside was added to a final concentration of 0.4 mm when the culture reached an A600 of 1.5. The culture supernatant was collected by centrifugation (40,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C) 16 h after induction. The culture supernatant was concentrated and dialyzed against 2 liters of buffer B (20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.4) overnight and applied to a nickel affinity column pre-equilibrated with buffer B. The column was eluted at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min using a linear gradient from 0 to 480 mm imidazole in buffer B over 100 min. The fractions containing pNPB hydrolase activity were pooled and dialyzed against 2 liters of buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) at 4 °C overnight. The purified enzyme was aliquoted, and stored at –80 °C. The expression and purification of recombinant Tfu_0882 were performed using the same procedures as described above for Tfu_0883. Purification of Recombinant F. solani pisi Cutinase—The B. subtilis harboring the plasmid pBSMuL3 expressing F. solani pisi cutinase was grown in TB medium containing kanamycin (50 mg/liter) at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm overnight. The culture supernatant was collected by centrifugation (40,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C). Solid (NH4)2SO4 was added to the culture supernatant to a final concentration of 70% (w/v). The precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation (40,000 × g,30 min, 4 °C), dissolved in buffer D (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), and dialyzed against 2 liters of buffer D at 4 °C overnight. Solid (NH4)2SO4 was added to the dialyzed sample to a final concentration of 20% (w/v). The sample was filtered (0.22 μm) and loaded onto a phenyl HP-Sepharose FF column pre-equilibrated with 20% (NH4)2SO4 in buffer D. A reverse gradient from 20 to 0% (NH4)2SO4 in buffer D was applied at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min over a 60-min period. The fractions containing pNPB hydrolase activity, which was assayed as described below, were pooled, dialyzed against 1 liter of buffer E (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0) overnight, and loaded onto a CM-Sepharose column pre-equilibrated with buffer E. The column was eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min using a linear gradient of 0 to 1 m NaCl in buffer E over 30 min. The fractions containing pNPB hydrolase activity were pooled and dialyzed against 500 ml of buffer E at 4 °C overnight. The purified enzyme was aliquoted, flash frozen, and stored at –80 °C. Enzyme Assays—Esterase activity was determined by a continuous spectrophotometric assay using pNPB as the substrate (22Fett W.F. Gerard H.C. Moreau R.A. Osman S.F. Jones L.E. Curr. Microbiol. 1992; 25: 165-171Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the production of 1 μmol of p-nitrophenol per minute. The standard assay was measured in a final volume of 1 ml containing pNPB (1 mm), the enzyme, and the assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm NaCl, and 50 mm sodium taurodeoxycholate, pH 8.0) at 20 °C. The reaction was initiated by the addition of pNPB. The hydrolysis of pNPB was spectrophotometrically monitored for the formation of the p-nitrophenol at 405 nm. Cutinase activity was determined as previously reported with the following modification (20Fett W.F. Wijey C. Moreau R.A. Osman S.F. J. Appl. Microbiol. 1999; 86: 561-568Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Apple cutin, prepared from mature apples as described previously (2Walton T.J. Kolattukudy P.E. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 1885-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), served as the substrate. For a typical assay, a certain amount of enzyme and 100 mg of apple cutin were added into a 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) in a final volume of 10 ml. The tube was shaken (125 rpm) for 18 h in a water bath preset at the desired temperatures. At the end of reaction, the remaining cutin was removed by centrifugation. The resulting supernatant was acidified with acetic acid and the released cutin monomers were extracted with chloroform. The organic soluble material was collected and dried under a stream of nitrogen. The dried cutin monomers were converted to their corresponding methyl esters and then silylated with bis-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (23Osman S.F. Irwin P. Fett W.F. Connor J.V. Parris N. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1999; 47: 799-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The silylated methyl esters were dissolved in hexane and analyzed by Finnigan GC/MS 4610B on a 122-7032 DBWAX 30M capillary column with temperature programmed as following: 125 °C for 5 min, 4 °C/min to 250 °C, and 250 °C for 15 min. Lipase activity was measured as previously reported (24Jaeger K.E. Ransac S. Dijkstra B.W. Colson C. van Heuvel M. Misset O. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 15: 29-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modification. Triolein served as the substrate. The reaction solution contained 2.5 ml of 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8) and 2 ml of emulsified triolein (3% PVA:triolein = 3:1). The reaction was initiated by adding the enzyme to the reaction solution and quenched by adding 7.5 ml of ethanol. The released fatty acids were quantified via titration by 0.05 n NaOH. One unit of lipase activity was defined as the release of 1 μmol of fatty acid per min. Temperature and pH Dependence of Cutinase—The temperature dependence of enzyme activity was determined between 20 and 70 °C. For esterase activity, the reaction was performed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm NaCl, and 50 mm sodium taurodeoxycholate at pH 8.0 using pNPB as the substrate. Because the pH of Tris buffer is temperature dependent, the buffers were adjusted to pH 8.0 at the desired temperatures. The enzyme activity was measured by preincubating the buffer at a desired temperature for 2 min to allow it to reach the final pH of 8.0. For lipase activity, the reaction was performed in 25 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8.0) using triolein as the substrate. The pH dependence of enzyme activity was determined between pH 6.0 and 9.0 using either 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0–7.0) or 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0–9.0). Thermostability of Cutinase—The thermostability of the enzyme was determined by incubating the enzyme in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) at 40 or 60 °C. At various times, aliquots of enzymes were removed and assayed for residual activity using pNPB as the substrate. Evaluation of Potential Synergistic Effect between Tfu_0882 and Tfu_0883—To evaluate the possibility of a synergism between the two T. fusca cutinases in cutin degradation, Tfu_0882 (0.08 μmol) and Tfu_0883 (0.08 μmol) were incubated, either individually or as a 1:1 mixture, with 1% (w/v) apple cutin in 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) at 60 °C. At various times, aliquots were removed and assayed for fatty acids by titration with 0.02 n NaOH. The fatty acid monomers released after 18 h of incubation were identified by GC/MS as described above. Inactivation of Cutinase—Inactivation of the enzyme was performed by incubating the enzyme (2 μm) with 1 mm PMSF in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) at 37 °C for varying amounts of time. The inactivation reactions were stopped by 200-fold dilution into ice-cold standard esterase assay buffer as described above. The residual enzyme activity was determined immediately by standard esterase assay using pNPB as the substrate. Inactivation was shown not to proceed during the assay under these conditions in control experiments (data not shown). The concentration dependence of PMSF inhibition was performed similarly utilizing an inactivation time of 10 min. Generation of Cutinase Mutants—Cutinase mutations were generated by the standard QuikChange mutagenesis methodology using complementary primers. The S188A mutant of Tfu_0882 was generated using pET20b-Tfu_0882 as template; S170A mutant of Tfu_0883 was generated using pET20b-Tfu_0883 as template. Mutated sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. The mutants were expressed and purified using the same procedures as described for the original recombinant T. fusca cutinases. The esterase activity of the purified mutants was assayed using pNPB as substrate. Miscellaneous Methods—Optical spectroscopy was performed using the UV-2450 ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer from Shimadzu. SDS-PAGE was performed under reducing conditions on a 12% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was visualized with 0.25% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 stain. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method. Purification of a Cutin-induced pNPB Hydrolase from T. fusca—A major hurdle to the isolation of wild-type bacterial cutinase has been the difficulty in monitoring cutin hydrolysis. We set out to isolate this enzyme using pNPB as the substrate based on the following rationale: cutinase is inducible by cutin (1Fett W.F. Gerard H.C. Moreau R.A. Osman S.F. Jones L.E. Appl. Environ. Microb. 1992; 58: 2123-2130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is excreted to the culture media, and can efficiently hydrolyze pNPB (14Longhi S. Cambillau C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1441: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found that pNPB hydrolase activity in T. fusca culture supernatant reached about 19 units/ml in the presence of cutin, whereas no pNPB hydrolase activity was detectable in the absence of cutin. Notably, analysis of proteins in the culture supernatant clearly indicated that a polypeptide of 29 kDa was the major protein induced by cutin (supplemental Fig. S1), suggesting that it might be a candidate for cutinase protein. Subsequently, by monitoring the hydrolysis of pNPB, a pNPB hydrolase was purified from cutin-induced culture supernatant of T. fusca through ammonium sulfate precipitation, hydrophobic interaction (phenyl Sepharose), and anion exchange (DEAE-Sepharose) chromatography. The purified enzyme exhibited a high specific activity of 398.6 units/mg for pNPB (supplemental Table S1). As expected, SDS-PAGE analysis demonstrated that this pNPB hydrolase corresponded to the 29-kDa protein induced by cutin (supplemental Fig. S1). Cutin-induced pNPB Hydrolase Displays Cutin-hydrolyzing Activity—To determine whether this T. fusca pNPB hydrolase also displayed cutinase activity, the protein was assayed for its ability of degrade cutin. For comparison, recombinant cutinase from F. solani pisi was purified and assayed under the same condition. As shown in supplemental Table S1, both enzymes exhibited activity for cutin hydrolysis, yielding comparable fatty acid monomers. For example, the proportion of C16 and C18 family fatty acids monomers released after enzymatic reaction were 48.85% for T. fusca pNPB hydrolase and 53.13% for F. solani pisi cutinase. Additionally, the proportion of hydroxy fatty acid is 16.66% for T. fusca pNPB hydrolase and 15.27% for F. solani pisi cutinase (supplemental Table S1). These results indicated that the cutin-induced pNPB hydrolase from T. fusca functions as a cutinase. Identification of T. fusca Cutinase Encoding Gene—To identify the gene encoding T. fusca cutinase, the 29-kDa band corresponding to cutin-induced pNPB hydrolase was excised from the SDS-PAGE gel (supplemental Fig. S1) and subjected to trypsin digestion. The resulting degradation peptides were analyzed by mass spectrometry. The peptide mass data were used to query the Mascot proteomics data base (www.matrixscience.com), resulting in two significant matches, Tfu_0883 and Tfu_0882 (Table 1). Of the matched peptides, 9 peptides were shared by both proteins, 4 were unique for Tfu_0883, and 1 was unique for Tfu_0882 (Table 2). Furthermore, N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the 29-kDa protein band resulted only a single sequence of ANPYERGPN, which corresponded to residues 59–67 of Tfu_0882 and residues 41–49 of Tfu_0883. These results strongly suggested that residues 1–58 of Tfu_0882 and residues 1–40 of Tfu_0883 are signal peptides. With their signal peptides excluded, both Tfu_0882 and Tfu_0883 are 269 amino acids in length and share a high sequence identity of 93%. It is to be noted that both proteins were annotated as triacylglycerol lipase in the genomic data base and contain the consensus sequence GXSXG, a characteristic of the α/β-hydrolase fold superfamily (25Nardini M. Dijkstra B.W. Curr. Opin. Struct.

The vector pET-20b(+), chosen for expression, contains a C-terminal His6 tag and signal peptide PelB, which allows the heterologously expressed proteins to be secreted. The pNPB hydrolyzing activity in the culture supernatant of transformed E. coli cells harboring plasmid pET20b-Tfu_0883 was 180 units/ml, which was 782-fold higher than that of un-transformed E. coli cells and 9.5-fold higher than that of cutin-induced T. fusca cells. The pNPB hydrolyzing activity in the culture supernatant of transformed E. coli cells harboring pET20b-Tfu_0882 plasmid was 69 units/ml, which was 300-fold higher than that of un-transformed E. coli cells and 3.6-fold higher than that of cutin-induced T. fusca cells. The recombinant enzymes were purified to homogeneity in a single step by nickel affinity chromatography (supplemental Fig. S2) and exhibited a specific activity of 458 units/mg for Tfu_0883 and 223 units/mg for Tfu_0882. Catalytic Properties of Recombinant Tfu_0882 and Tfu_0883—Because the fungal cutinase from F. solani pisi can hydrolyze both insoluble triglycerides and soluble esters (3Purdy R.E. Kolattukudy P.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1973; 159: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), Tfu_0882 and Tfu_0883 were first characterized for the hydrolysis of triolein and pNPB, and compared with their fungal counterpart. As shown in Fig. 2, all three enzymes effectively hydrolyzed triolein and pNPB. Tfu_0882 and Tfu_0883 exhibited an optimal temperature at 60 °C for both triolein an"
https://openalex.org/W2073177086,"The Dirac Hamiltonian, which successfully describes relativistic fermions, applies equally well to electrons in solids with linear energy dispersion, for example, in bismuth and graphene. A characteristic of these materials is that a magnetic field less than 10 tesla suffices to force the Dirac electrons into the lowest Landau level, with resultant strong enhancement of the Coulomb interaction energy. Moreover, the Dirac electrons usually come with multiple flavors or valley degeneracy. These ingredients favor transitions to a collective state with novel quantum properties in large field. By using torque magnetometry, we have investigated the magnetization of bismuth to fields of 31 tesla. We report the observation of sharp field-induced phase transitions into a state with striking magnetic anisotropy, consistent with the breaking of the threefold valley degeneracy."
https://openalex.org/W2114545918,"Duane's retraction syndrome (DRS) is a complex congenital eye movement disorder caused by aberrant innervation of the extraocular muscles by axons of brainstem motor neurons. Studying families with a variant form of the disorder (DURS2-DRS), we have identified causative heterozygous missense mutations in CHN1 , a gene on chromosome 2q31 that encodes α2-chimaerin, a Rac guanosine triphosphatase–activating protein (RacGAP) signaling protein previously implicated in the pathfinding of corticospinal axons in mice. We found that these are gain-of-function mutations that increase α2-chimaerin RacGAP activity in vitro. Several of the mutations appeared to enhance α2-chimaerin translocation to the cell membrane or enhance its ability to self-associate. Expression of mutant α2-chimaerin constructs in chick embryos resulted in failure of oculomotor axons to innervate their target extraocular muscles. We conclude that α2-chimaerin has a critical developmental function in ocular motor axon pathfinding."
https://openalex.org/W1990626167,"Two groups of tau, 3R- and 4R-tau, are generated by alternative splicing of tau exon 10. Normal adult human brain expresses equal levels of them. Disruption of the physiological balance is a common feature of several tauopathies. Very early in their life, individuals with Down syndrome (DS) develop Alzheimer-type tau pathology, the molecular basis for which is not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that Dyrk1A, a kinase encoded by a gene in the DS critical region, phosphorylates alternative splicing factor (ASF) at Ser-227, Ser-234, and Ser-238, driving it into nuclear speckles and preventing it from facilitating tau exon 10 inclusion. The increased dosage of Dyrk1A in DS brain due to trisomy of chromosome 21 correlates to an increase in 3R-tau level, which on abnormal hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of tau results in neurofibrillary degeneration. Imbalance of 3R- and 4R-tau in DS brain by Dyrk1A-induced dysregulation of alternative splicing factor-mediated alternative splicing of tau exon 10 represents a novel mechanism of neurofibrillary degeneration and may help explain early onset tauopathy in individuals with DS.

The microtubule-associated protein tau plays an important role in the polymerization and stabilization of neuronal microtubules.

Inclusion or exclusion of exon 10 (E10), which codes for the second microtubule-binding repeat, divides tau isoforms into two main groups, three (3R)- or four (4R)-microtubule-binding repeat tau. They show key differences in their interactions with tau kinases as well as their biological function in the polymerization and stabilization of neuronal microtubules. In the adult human brain, 3R-tau and 4R-tau are expressed at similar levels (5Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Jakes R. Rutherford D. Crowther R.A.

Several specific mutations in the tau gene associated with frontotemporal dementias with Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) cause dysregulation of tau E10 splicing, leading to a selective increase in either 3R-tau or 4R-tau. It has therefore been suggested that equal levels of 3R-tau and 4R-tau may be critical for maintaining optimal neuronal physiology (8Goedert M. Jakes R. Biochem. Biophy. Acta. 2005; 1739: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Down syndrome (DS), caused by partial or complete trisomy of chromosome 21, is the most common chromosomal disorder and one of the leading causes of mental retardation in humans. Individuals with DS develop Alzheimer-type neurofibrillary degeneration as early as the fourth decade of life (9Wisniewski K.E. Wisniewski H.M. Wen G.Y. Ann. Neurol. 1985; 17: 278-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). The presence of Alzheimer-type amyloid pathology in DS is attributed to an extra copy of APP gene. However, the molecular basis of neurofibrillary pathology remains elusive. Alternative splicing of tau E10 is tightly regulated by complex interactions of splicing factors with cis-elements located mainly at E10 and intron 10. Serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins are a superfamily of conserved splicing factors in metazoans and play very important roles in alternative splicing (10D'Souza I. Schellenberg G.D. Regulation of tau isoform expression and dementia.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1739: 104-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). One such protein, splicing factor 2, also called alternative splicing factor (ASF), plays essential and regulatory roles in alternative splicing of E10 by binding to a polypurine enhancer of exonic splicing enhancer located at tau E10 (11Kondo S.

Multiple biological functions of Dyrk1A are suggested by its interaction with a myriad of cellular proteins including transcription and splicing factors (19Galceran J. de Graaf K. Tejedor F.J. Becker W. J. Neural Transm. Suppl. 2003; 67: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It is distributed throughout the nucleoplasm with a predominant accumulation in nuclear speckles (20Alvarez M. Estivill X. de la Luna S. J.

BMC Biochem. 2006; 7: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the storage site of inactivated SR proteins, including ASF. Because of its overexpression in DS brain and its predominant localization in nuclear speckles, we hypothesized that Dyrk1A could affect phosphorylation of ASF, and in doing so, disturb ASF-regulated alternative splicing of tau E10, leading to the apparent dysregulation of the balance of 3R-tau and 4R-tau. In the present study, we provide direct evidence that Dyrk1A can phosphorylate ASF at Ser-227, Ser-234, and Ser-238, driving it into nuclear speckles. By preventing its association with nascent transcripts, phosphorylation of ASF by Dyrk1A causes exclusion of tau E10, leading to an increase in 3R-tau level and an imbalance of 3R-tau and 4R-tau in DS brain. Dysregulation of alternative splicing of tau E10 represents a novel mechanism of neurofibrillary degeneration in DS and offers a unique therapeutic target.

Guo J. Zhou J. J. Neurochem. 2004; 90: 164-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody 8D9 was raised against a histidine-tagged protein containing the first 160 residues of rat Dyrk1A (24Wegiel J. Kuchna I. Nowicki K. Frackowiak J. Dowjat K. Silverman W.P.

The monoclonal anti-HA, anti-α-tubulin, and anti-β-actin were bought from Sigma. Monoclonal anti-3R-tau and anti-4R-tau were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Monoclonal anti-tau (tau-5) was from Chemicon International, Inc. (Pittsburgh, PA). Monoclonal anti-human tau (43D) and polyclonal anti-tau (R134d) were described previously (25Liu F. Iqbal K. Grundke-Iqbal I. Hart G.W. Gong C.-X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10804-10809Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA); monoclonal anti-SR protein (1H4) and anti-ASF antibodies, tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The ECL kit was from Amersham Biosciences, and [γ-32P]ATP and [32P]orthophosphate were from MP Biomedicals (Irvine, CA). Plasmid Construction and DNA Mutagenesis—pGEX-2T-ASF was constructed by PCR amplification from pCEP4-ASF and subcloning into pGEX-2T to express GST-ASF fusion protein. Mutation of Ser-227 to Ala of ASF was achieved by using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with primers (forward, 5′-caggagtcgcagttacgccccaaggagaagcagag-3′, and reverse, 5′-ctctgcttctccttggggcgtaactgcgactcctg-3′). The mutation of Ser-234 or Ser-238 to Ala was generated by using PCR from vector pGEX-2T-ASF with the same forward primer as described above and different reverse primers (5′-cggaattcttatgtacgagagcgagatctgctatgacggggagaatagcgtggtgctcctctgc-3′ for Ser-234 to Ala and 5′-cggaattcttatgtacgagagcgagatctgctatgacggggagcatagc-3′ for Ser-238 to Ala). The mutations at Ser-227, Ser-234, and Ser-238 to three Ala (ASFS3A) were produced by using PCR to pGEX-2T-ASFS227A with reverse primer (5′-cggaattcttatgtacgagagcgagatctgctatgacggggagcatagcgtggtgctcctctgc-3′). All the PCR products were digested and inserted into pGEX-2T. The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing analysis. For mammalian vectors, ASF mutants were constructed by digestion of those ASF mutants in pGEX-2T vector and inserting them into pCEP4 to generate pCEP4-ASFS3A. By using a similar strategy, we also mutated these three Ser residues, 227, 234, and 238, to aspartic acid to generate plasmid pCEP4-ASFS3D. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7, HEK-293T, SH-SY5Y, and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C. Normal human neuronal progenitor cells (Lonza, Walkersville, MD) were maintained in Neurobasal supplemented with 2% B27 (Invitrogen), 20 ng/ml fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, and 10 ng/ml leukemia inhibitory factor and differentiated with 10 μm retinoid acid in the maintenance medium for 6 days. All transfections were performed in triplicate with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in 12-well plates. The cells were transfected with 2.4 μg of plasmid DNA and 5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 in 1 ml Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) for 5 h at 37 °C (5% CO2), after which 1 ml Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum was added. For co-expression experiments, 2.4 μg of total plasmid was used containing 0.8 μg of E10 splicing vector, 0.8 μg of ASF vectors, and 0.8 μg of Dyrk1A vector or their control vectors. In Vitro Phosphorylation of ASF by Dyrk1A—For in vitro ASF phosphorylation by Dyrk1A, GST-ASF or GST (0.2 mg/ml) was incubated with various concentrations of Dyrk1A in a reaction buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm [γ-32P]ATP (500 cpm/pmol). After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, the reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer and boiling. The reaction products were separated by SDS-PAGE. Incorporation of 32P was detected by exposure of the dried gel to phosphorimaging system (BAS-1500, Fujifilm). GST Pull Down—GST or GST-ASF was purified by affinity purification with glutathione-Sepharose as described above but without elution from the beads. These beads coupled GST or GST-ASF were incubated with crude extract from rat brain homogenate in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 8.5% sucrose, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin). After a 4-h incubation at 4 °C, the beads were washed with washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) six times, the bound proteins were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer, and the samples were subjected to Western blot analysis. Co-immunoprecipitation—HEK-293T cells were co-transfected with pCEP4-ASF-HA and pcDNA3-Dyrk1A for 48 h as described above. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed by sonication in lysate buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin). Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation; the supernatants were preabsorbed with protein G-conjugated agarose beads and incubated with anti-HA or anti-Dyrk1A antibody 8D9 overnight at 4 °C, and then protein G beads were added. After a 4-h incubation at 4 °C, the beads were washed with lysate buffer twice and with Tris-buffered saline twice, and bound proteins were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were subjected to Western blot analysis with the indicated primary antibodies. Co-localization Study—HeLa cells were plated in 12-well plates onto coverslips 1 day prior to transfection at 50-60% confluence. HA-tagged ASF constructs were singly transfected or co-transfected with Dyrk1A or Dyrk1Ak188R constructs as described above. Two days after transfection, the cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS, the cells were blocked with 10% goat serum in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 2 h at 37 °C and incubated with rabbit anti-HA antibody (1:200) and mouse anti-Dyrk1A (8D9, 1:10,000) overnight at 4 °C. After washing and incubation with secondary antibodies (TRITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, 1:200), the cells were washed extensively with PBS and incubated with 5 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were washed with PBS, mounted with Fluoromount-G, and revealed with a Leica TCS-SP2 laser-scanning confocal microscope. RNA Interference—For inhibition of ASF and Dyrk1A expression, HEK-293T cells cultured in 12-well plates were transfected with various amounts of short interfering RNA (siRNA) using Lipofectamine 2000. After a 48-h transfection, cells were lysed, and protein and RNA were extracted as described above. siRNA target sequences to ASF were 5′-GTAGAACCCATGTTGTATA-3′, 5′-GTTCCAATGTATTGGTGTA-3′, and 5′-GGAGCTGGATCATTGGATT-3′ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Dyrk1A SMARTpool target sequences to Dyrk1A were 5′-TAAGGATGCTTGATTATGA-3′, 5′-GCTAATACCTTGGACTTTG-3′, 5′-GAAAACAGCTGATGAAGGT-3′, and 5′-AAACTCGAATTCAACCTTA-3 (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO). Both strands of siRNAs had two uridines at 3′. The same amount of scramble siRNA was used for controls. Quantitation of Tau E10 Splicing by Reverse Transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)—Total cellular RNA was isolated from cultured cells by using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen GmbH). One microgram of total RNA was used for first-strand cDNA synthesis with oligo(dT)15-18 by using an Omniscript reverse transcription kit (Qiagen GmbH). PCR was performed by using Prime-STAR™ HS DNA Polymerase (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Shiga, Japan) with primers (forward 5′-GGTGTCCACTCCCAGTTCAA-3′ and reverse 5′-CCCTGGTTTATGATGGATGTTGCCTAATGAG-3′) to measure alternative splicing of tau E10 under conditions: at 98 °C for 3 min, at 98 °C for 10 s, and at 68 °C for 40 s for 30 cycles and then at 68 °C for 10 min for extension. The PCR products were resolved on 1.5% agarose gels and quantitated using the Molecular Imager system (Bio-Rad). Immunohistochemical Staining—The serial sections from the temporal inferior gyrus of six cases of DS and six control cases (see Table 1) were examined. For comparison, brain sections from the same region of three AD cases with a moderately severe stage of the disease (global deterioration scale, stage 6) and three cases with a severe stage of the disease (global deterioration scale, stage 7) were examined by immunohistochemical staining. One brain hemisphere was fixed in 10% buffered formalin, dehydrated in ethanol, and infiltrated and embedded in polyethylene glycol. The tissue blocks were cut serially into 50-μm-thick sections. Monoclonal antibody RD3 (diluted 1:500) was used for detection of 3R-tau, and RD4 (diluted 1:200) was used to detect 4R-tau. The endogenous peroxidase in the sections was blocked with 0.2% hydrogen peroxide in methanol. The sections were then treated with 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS for 30 min to block nonspecific binding. The antibodies were diluted in 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS and were incubated with sections overnight at 4 °C. The sections were washed and treated for 30 min with biotinylated sheep anti-mouse IgG antibody diluted 1:200. The sections were treated with an extravidin peroxidase conjugate (1:200) for 1 h, and the product of reaction was visualized with diaminobenzidine (0.5 mg/ml with 1.5% hydrogen peroxide in PBS). After immunostaining, the sections were lightly counterstained with hematoxylin. Sarkosyl-insoluble Tau Preparation—Homogenates of control and DS brains prepared in 10 volumes of buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 8.5% sucrose, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 nm okadaic acid, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin) were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was adjusted to 1% N-lauroylsarcosine and 1% β-mercaptoethanol and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After the incubation, supernatant was spun at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 25 °C. The resulting pellet was dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to Western blot analysis. Phosphorylation of ASF in Cultured Cells—COS7 cells were transfected with pCEP4-ASF-HA and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. After a 45-h transfection, the medium was replaced with [32P]orthophosphate (10 mCi) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (-phosphate) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum plus 10 μm Tg003 and/or 50 μm EGCG. After a 3-h incubation, the cells were harvested in lysate buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 50 NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm okadaic acid, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxychalate, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin). Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation as described above. Immunoprecipitated ASF-HA by anti-HA was analyzed by immunoblotting and autoradiography. Mass Spectrometry—GST-ASF fusion protein was phosphorylated by Dyrk1A as described above. To maximize the yield of the phosphorylated protein, the reaction was carried out for 1 h with high amounts of the kinase (1:6 molar ratio of GST-ASF and GST-Dyrk1A). The phosphorylated products were separated in SDS-PAGE and stained by Coomassie Blue. The gel piece was in-gel tryptic-digested. Proteolytic peptides were extracted from the gel followed by TiO2-based immobilized metal affinity chelate enrichment for the phosphopeptide. The resulting fraction was concentrated and reconstituted in 10 μl of 5% formic acid for liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis separately. Statistical Analysis—Where appropriate, the data are presented as the means ± S.D. Data points were compared by the unpaired two-tailed Student's t test, and the calculated p values are indicated in Figs. 4, 5 and 6. For the analysis of the correlation between Dyrk1A level and 3R-tau or 4R-tau levels in human brain homogenates, the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient r was calculated.FIGURE 5Mutations of ASF affect its subcellular location and role in tau exon 10 inclusion. a, subcellular location of ASF mutants.

Sarcosyl-insoluble tau was collected from the pellet of 100,000 × g centrifugation at 25 °C and dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer. The brain extracts and the sarcosyl-insoluble protein were analyzed proportionally for the levels of 3R-tau and 4R-tau by Western blots. The levels of 3R-tau and 4R-tau in the sarkosyl-insoluble fraction were normalized with taus in the brain extracts, and the level of 4R-tau was designated as 100%.

To compare the E10 splicing efficiency of these SR proteins, we co-transfected mini-tau gene pCI-I9/LI10, consisting of tau exons 9-11, part of intron 9 (SI9), and the full length of intron 10 (LI10) (23Yu Q. Guo J. Zhou J. J. Neurochem. 2004; 90: 164-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), together with each of the four known E10 splicing factors, into HEK-293T cells and detected E10 splicing by RT-PCR. We found that of the four SR proteins, ASF promoted E10 inclusion most effectively (Fig. 1a). This effect was not cell type-specific, as overexpression of ASF in cells including HEK-293T, COS7, HeLa, and SH-SY5Y, also up-regulated 4R-tau production (Fig. 1b). To establish the requirement of ASF in E10 inclusion in vivo, we next knocked down endogenous ASF by transfecting HEK-293T cells with ASF-specific siRNA (Fig. 1c). Decreased ASF expression by siRNA significantly decreased 4R-tau production (Fig. 1c), further supporting an essential role of ASF in tau E10 inclusion.

Poor coordination among interested parties and the choice of nonvalidated scientific targets for phase III studies have hampered progress and created mistrust about the use of microbicides as a method to prevent HIV-1 sexual transmission.

While many ABC proteins are multisubunit proteins composed of two identical NBDs and MSDs, CFTR is a single polypeptide containing two distinct NBDs and MSDs. The proper folding of the individual domains and the interactions between these domains during or after protein synthesis are essential for CFTR assembly, a process that is inefficient with the majority of CFTR being degraded at the endoplasmic reticulum by the proteasome (5Cheng S.H.

However, the crystal structures of several bacterial ABC transporter proteins have been recently solved (14Dawson R.J. Locher K.P.

Of particular interest is the structure of the bacterial exporter Sav1866, which shows its NBDs in close contact with both MSDs, a configuration that is unlike those of the importers (BtuCD, ModBC, HI1470/71 and the Escherichia coli maltose transporter), which show each of their MSD in contact solely with one NBD. Although CFTR functions as a channel, it belongs to the exporter subclass of the ABC family. In our recent work, a molecular model of CFTR was constructed based on its homology to Sav1866. From the model, we predicted and confirmed experimentally the interdomain interactions between CL2 (MSD1) and NBD2 and between CL4 (MSD2) and NBD1 (19Serohijos A.W. Hegedus T. Aleksandrov A.A. He L. Cui L. Dokholyan N.V. Riordan J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 3256-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The later interaction between NBD1 and CL4 is most crucial to CFTR biogenesis and assembly because of the known sensitivity of CFTR conformational maturation to many disease-associated mutations in CL4 as well as NBD1 (20Seibert F.S.

Single channel activity measurements also show that both interfaces are important for the regulation of channel gating as cross-linking of Cys on either side of these interfaces arrests channel gating. This observation, corroborated by rate equilibrium-free energy relationship (REFER) analysis of the single channel kinetics, suggest that these interfaces act as connecting joints between MSDs and NBDs, thus coordinating movement on either side of the contact (19Serohijos A.W. Hegedus T. Aleksandrov A.A. He L. Cui L. Dokholyan N.V. Riordan J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 3256-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar).Many disease-causing mutations also occur in other cytoplasmic loops such as CL1 and CL3, compromising CFTR maturation and channel function (21Seibert F.S.

Further identification and analysis of the CL/NBD interfaces should help understanding of how these mutations disrupt interdomain interactions during CFTR biosynthesis and how the signals of ATP binding and hydrolysis at NBDs are transmitted to MSDs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies—Mouse monoclonal CFTR antibodies to an N-terminal fragment (mAb 13-4, IgG1κ), NBD2 (mAb 596, IgG2b), and R domain (mAb 450, IgG1κ) were generated as described (9Cui L.

A stop codon (TAA) was introduced at residue Glu-1172 to produce the ΔNBD2 construct, 1172X (9Cui L. Aleksandrov L. Chang X.B. Hou Y.X. He L. Hegedus T. Gentzsch M. Aleksandrov A. Balch W.E.

Point mutations and PCR-generated DNA fragments were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing (UNC-CH Genome Analysis Facility).Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK) cells were transiently transfected using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To promote maturation of Cys-less CFTR variants, 24 h after transfection, HEK cells were incubated at 27 °C for 48 h before the cross-linking experiment. For stable expression, constructs were cotransfected with pNUT plasmid into baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells, which were selected and maintained in methotrexate-containing medium (23Chang X.-B. Tabcharani J.A. Hou Y.-X. Jensen T.J. Kartner N. Alon N. Hanrahan J.W. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11304-11311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To phosphorylate CFTR, cells were incubated for 10 min with 10 μm forskolin, 100 μm DiBu-cAMP, and 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine before harvesting. This stimulation mixture was also present during the cross-linking reaction.Isolation of Membrane Vesicles and Single-Channel Measurements—Membrane vesicles were isolated from BHK or HEK cells expressing variants of Cys-less CFTR as described previously (19Serohijos A.W. Hegedus T. Aleksandrov A.A. He L. Cui L. Dokholyan N.V. Riordan J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 3256-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). To phosphorylate CFTR, membranes were treated with 100 units/ml PKA (Promega) in the presence of 2 mm ATP and 2 mm MgCl2 for 15 min at room temperature, sonicated briefly, and incubated for another 15 min to achieve complete phosphorylation. Phosphorylation was confirmed by the diminution of the signal detected by the phosphorylation-sensitive mAb 450. Single-channel recordings were collected as previously described (19Serohijos A.W. Hegedus T. Aleksandrov A.A. He L. Cui L. Dokholyan N.V. Riordan J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 3256-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 24Cui L. Aleksandrov L. Hou Y.X.

To cross-link CFTR in vesicles, membranes (1 mg/ml total proteins) were incubated with 20 μm MTS reagent for 15 min at room temperature. The cross-linking reaction was stopped with Laemmli sample buffers with or without DTT. Proteins were resolved with 7.5% SDS-PAGE and CFTR detected with mAb 596 and secondary goat anti-mouse IgG-IR800 using the Odyssey infrared scanner (LiCor Corp.). For dual antibody labeling, isotype-specific secondary antibodies labeled with different infrared (IR) dyes were used. Specifically, goat-anti-mouse IgG1-IR800 and IgG2b-IR680 were used to detect mAb 450 and mAb 596, respectively.Limited Trypsin Digestion—For limited trypsin digestion, BHK membranes were resuspended at 1 mg of protein/ml in a buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm EGTA. Membrane proteins were first treated with 20 μm M8M cross-linker for 15 min at room temperature and centrifuged to remove cross-linker before trypsin digestion. Membranes were incubated on ice with 240 and 480 μg/ml of TPCK-treated trypsin for 15 min, and digestion was stopped with excess soybean trypsin inhibitor. CFTR tryptic fragments separated on 4–20% gradient gels (Bio-Rad) were detected by Western blots probed with mAb 13-4.RESULTSAromatic Clusters Mediate Domain-swapping Interactions—Many disease-associated CFTR mutations occur in cytoplasmic loops, compromising CFTR maturation and channel activity (20Seibert F.S.

Determination of how these loops interact with other domains may help the understanding of how these mutations disrupt CFTR biosynthesis and channel activity. We have constructed a three-dimensional model of CFTR based on Sav1866 and shown that there are close contacts between CL2 and NBD2, and between CL4 and NBD1 (19Serohijos A.W. Hegedus T. Aleksandrov A.A. He L. Cui L. Dokholyan N.V. Riordan J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 3256-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). This configuration supported the so-called “domain-swapping” where each MSD interacts with the NBD in the opposite half of the molecule as was earlier observed in Sav1866 (14Dawson R.J. Locher K.P. Nature. 2006; 443: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar) and also in MsbA (25Ward A. Reyes C.L. Yu J. Roth C.B. Chang G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 19005-19010Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar).A striking feature of the CL4/NBD1 interface is the interaction of Phe-508 with a cluster of aromatic residues (Phe-1068, Tyr-1073, and Phe-1074) in CL4, which may serve to stabilize this crucial interface (19Serohijos A.W. Hegedus T. Aleksandrov A.A. He L. Cui L. Dokholyan N.V. Riordan J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 3256-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The structural model predicts an analogous aromatic cluster in the interface between CL2 (Tyr-275) and NBD2 (Phe-1294, Phe-1296, and Tyr-1307). To verify these specific interactions, we performed cross-linking experiments in HEK cells expressing a Cys-less CFTR construct containing the Cys pair 276C and Y1307C (Fig. 2A). The 276 and 1307 sites could be cross-linked using the MTS reagents M3M and M8M, but to a lesser extent with M1M and M17M, suggesting that the two residues are in relatively close contact. These cross-linking results confirm the existence of an analogous aromatic cluster between CL2 and NBD2.FIGURE 2Contact interfaces of CLs with opposite NBDs. HEK 293 cells transiently transfected with Cys-less CFTR containing Cys pairs introduced at different interfaces between cytoplasmic loops and NBDs were incubated with 200 μm MTS reagents of different spacer arm lengths. Cell lysates in SDS-PAGE sample buffer with or without DTT were subjected to Western blot analysis using CFTR antibody mAb 596. Cross-linked proteins migrate above 250 kDa.

The three bands, X, C, and B, represent the cross-linked, the mature complex glycosylated, and the immature core glycosylated CFTR, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Q- and X-Loops of Both NBDs Also Participate in CL2/NBD2 and CL4/NBD1 Interactions—Conformational changes due to ATP binding and hydrolysis at the NBD1/NBD2 interface may be transmitted to the MSDs through the CL/NBD interface contacts. Thus it is important to determine whether or not these interfaces are spatially proximal to the ATP binding sites. In agreement with what is predicted by our model, we were able to cross-link residue pairs W496C/T1064C, M498C/L1065C (19Serohijos A.W. Hegedus T. Aleksandrov A.A. He L. Cui L. Dokholyan N.V. Riordan J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 3256-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), which proves that indeed CL4 also interacts with NBD1 through the so called Q-loop (Q493). The Q-loop connects the canonical α-helical subdomain containing the ABC signature with the core subdomain containing Walker A and Walker B motifs (26Lewis H.A. Buchanan S.G. Burley S.K. Conners K.

Nature. 1998; 396: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). In the histidine permease structure, the side chain of the Q-loop glutamine (Q100) contacts the γ-phosphate of ATP via a water molecule (28Hung L.W. Wang I.X. Nikaido K. Liu P.Q. Ames G.F. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 396: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Analogous to the interaction of CL4 with the Q-loop of NBD1, our model also predicts a close contact between CL2 and the Q-loop (Q1291) of NBD2. The successful cross-linking of the residue pairs N268C (CL2) and F1294C (NBD2) by the MTS reagents of various spacer arm lengths confirmed this contact (Fig. 2A). The interaction of the Q-loops with the CLs observed in the Sav1866 crystal structure and identified by cross-linking in CFTR is also observed in ABC importers such as BtuCD, ModBC, HI1470/1, and the maltose transporter (15Hollenstein K. Frei D.C. Locher K.P. Nature. 2007; 446: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 16Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C.

Nature. 2007; 450: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). However, one feature that is unique to the Sav1866 structure is that its so-called X-loop (469TEVGERG) in the NBD interacts with both CL1 and CL2. The X-loop sequence is conserved in exporters but not in importers (14Dawson R.J. Locher K.P. Nature. 2006; 443: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). Moreover, X-loops are in close proximity to the ABC signature motifs, making them also good candidates for the transmission of signals of ATP binding/hydrolysis at the NBDs to the MSDs. Sequence alignment of CFTR with Sav1866 indicates that in CFTR, Glu-543 (NBD1), and Asp-1341 (NBD2) correspond to Glu-473 of the Sav1866 X-loop. Cys pair cross-linking experiments showed that indeed E543C could be cross-linked with both T966C (CL3) and T1057C (CL4, Fig. 2B), while D1341C was in close contact with both L172C (CL1) and N268C (CL2, Fig. 2C).CL/NBD Interfaces within Each Half of CFTR—So far, we have only confirmed the cross-linking between MSDs with their opposite NBDs through CLs, i.e. CL1 and CL2 with NBD2, and CL3 and CL4 with NBD1. However, contact interfaces of the N-terminal cytoplasmic loops in each MSD (CL1 and CL3) with NBDs of the same half of the molecule have not been established in any eukaryotic ABC proteins. According to our Sav1866-based CFTR model, CL1 and CL3 should contact both NBDs, as shown in the scheme in Fig. 1. To confirm these contacts in the case of CL3 and NBD2, we designed several Cys pairs from CL3 (M961C and S962C) and NBD2 (L1260C and L1261C) (Fig. 3A). Cross-linking experiments were carried out in HEK cells overexpressing Cys-less CFTR with these Cys pairs. In constructs containing the Cys pairs M961C/L1261C (Fig. 3A), M961C/L1260C, and S962C/L1261C (supplemental Fig. S1A), MTS reagent treatment produced a slightly, albeit distinguishably, faster moving band, which could be reversed by DTT. We hypothesized that this different mobility shift pattern may be due to the smaller number of amino acids between these cross-linked Cys pairs (∼300 amino acids) than those between CLs and opposite NBDs (∼400 to ∼1200 amino acids), which produce a clear cross-linked band that migrates much slower (for example Fig. 2). A faster moving band after cross-linking was also observed when cross-linking T123C (CL1) with S428C (NBD) of the multidrug ABC transporter BmrA (29Dalmas O. Orelle C. Foucher A.E. Geourjon C.

Cross-linking of Cys pairs between CL3 and NBD2 was also confirmed with co-expression of constructs of Cys-less ΔNBD2 CFTR containing M961C together with the Cys-less NBD2 fragment containing L1261C in HEK cells (supplemental Fig. S1, B and C).FIGURE 3Contact interfaces of CLs with NBDs within each half of CFTR.

We developed an efficient selection for heritable mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) mutations in Drosophila, thereby enhancing a metazoan model for study of mitochondrial genetics and mutations causing human mitochondrial disease. Targeting a restriction enzyme to mitochondria in the germline compromised fertility, but escaper progeny carried homoplasmic mtDNA mutations lacking the cleavage site. Among mutations eliminating a site in the cytochrome c oxidase gene, mt:CoI(A302T) was healthy, mt:CoI(R301L) was male sterile but otherwise healthy, and mt:CoI(R301S) exhibited a wide range of defects, including growth retardation, neurodegeneration, muscular atrophy, male sterility, and reduced life span.

We showed previously that extracellular matrix proteolysis is triggered by the apoptosis of endothelial cells (EC), resulting in the release of an anti-apoptotic C-terminal fragment of endorepellin (LG3). Here, we characterize the endorepellin-cleaving proteases released by apoptotic EC using a multifaceted proteomics strategy. Cathepsin L (CathL), a cysteine protease known to be associated with cardiovascular disease progression in animal models and humans, was isolated from medium conditioned by apoptotic EC. CathL cleaved recombinant endorepellin in vitro, leading to LG3 release. Inhibition of CathL activity in EC exposed to pro-apoptotic stimuli prevented LG3 release without modulating the development of apoptosis in EC. Inhibition of caspase-3 activation in EC with the biochemical inhibitor DEVD-fluoromethyl ketone or small interfering RNAs concomitantly prevented CathL release by EC, LG3 production, and the development of paracrine anti-apoptotic activity. These data demonstrate that caspase-3 activation is a novel pathway of importance for triggering extracellular CathL release and the cleavage of extracellular matrix components. Proteolysis of extracellular matrix components and the production of cryptic bioactive factors play key roles in vascular remodeling. We showed previously that extracellular matrix proteolysis is triggered by the apoptosis of endothelial cells (EC), resulting in the release of an anti-apoptotic C-terminal fragment of endorepellin (LG3). Here, we characterize the endorepellin-cleaving proteases released by apoptotic EC using a multifaceted proteomics strategy. Cathepsin L (CathL), a cysteine protease known to be associated with cardiovascular disease progression in animal models and humans, was isolated from medium conditioned by apoptotic EC. CathL cleaved recombinant endorepellin in vitro, leading to LG3 release. Inhibition of CathL activity in EC exposed to pro-apoptotic stimuli prevented LG3 release without modulating the development of apoptosis in EC. Inhibition of caspase-3 activation in EC with the biochemical inhibitor DEVD-fluoromethyl ketone or small interfering RNAs concomitantly prevented CathL release by EC, LG3 production, and the development of paracrine anti-apoptotic activity. These data demonstrate that caspase-3 activation is a novel pathway of importance for triggering extracellular CathL release and the cleavage of extracellular matrix components.

During vascular remodeling, EC injury and apoptosis are followed by migration of α-smooth muscle actin-positive cells (smooth muscle cells (SMC) and myofibroblasts) that accumulate within the intima through a state of resistance to apoptosis largely dependent on Bcl-xl overexpression (14.Pollman M.

The production of biologically active mediators by apoptotic EC is at least partially dependent on pericellular proteolysis, leading to basement membrane and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation with the release of cryptic anti-apoptotic factors (18.Raymond M.A. Desormeaux A.

Perlecan is a basement membrane modular proteoglycan composed of five structural domains (21.Iozzo R.V. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 646-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain, also called endorepellin, comprises three laminin-like globular (LG1-LG3) modules interspaced by four epidermal growth factor-like repeats. The C-terminal LG3 motif mediates most of the anti-apoptotic and fibrogenic activity of endorepellin (18.Raymond M.A. Desormeaux A. Laplante P. Vigneault N. Filep J.G. Landry K. Pshezhetsky A.V.

LG3 levels were recently observed to be increased in patients with chronic renal allograft rejection (23.Goligorsky M.S. Addabbo F. O'Riordan E. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2007; 18: 2233-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), further supporting the contention that EC apoptosis and ECM proteolysis play key roles in vascular remodeling. In the last two decades a convincing body of evidence has demonstrated that the ECM is an extremely dynamic structure of crucial importance for the regulation of cell adhesion, migration, survival, and differentiation. Proteolysis of basement membrane and/or ECM components (such as collagen IV, XV, XVIII, and perlecan) and liberation of split products with new functions (such as tumstatin, arrestin, endostatin, and endorepellin LG3 motif) have central roles in angiogenesis, wound-healing, tissue-remodeling, and atherosclerosis (24.Lutgens S.P. Cleutjens K.B. Daemen M.J. Heeneman S. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 3029-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). We reported previously that LG3 production by apoptotic EC occurs downstream of caspase activation (18.Raymond M.A. Desormeaux A. Laplante P. Vigneault N. Filep J.G. Landry K. Pshezhetsky A.V. Hebert M.J. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 705-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 20.Laplante P. Raymond M.A. Labelle A. Abe J. Iozzo R.V. Hebert M.J. J. Biol.

Zhang Y. Gopalakrishnan B. Greenspan D.S. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7080-7087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This suggested that caspase activation leads to the release/activation of an as yet uncharacterized protease(s) which could then cleave endorepellin and release LG3. Hence, we used a multifaceted proteomics strategy to characterize the endorepellin-cleaving proteases released by apoptotic EC. Here, we describe the importance of cathepsin L (CathL), a lysosomal endoprotease associated with the development of atherosclerotic diseases in animal models and humans, as a key enzyme responsible for LG3 production by apoptotic EC. Cell Culture and Reagents—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC, Clonetics), WI-38 human fibroblasts (ATCC), and A7R5 vascular SMC (ATCC) were cultured as described elsewhere (18.Raymond M.A. Desormeaux A. Laplante P. Vigneault N. Filep J.G. Landry K. Pshezhetsky A.V. Hebert M.J. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 705-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 20.Laplante P. Raymond M.A. Labelle A. Abe J.

Caspase inhibitors (ZVAD-FMK, DEVD-FMK, and LEHD-FMK) were purchased from R&D Systems. The CathL inhibitors ZFF-FMK and ZFA-FMK were from Calbiochem and MP Biomedicals, respectively. t-PA-STOP was obtained from American Diagnostica, Inc. Human recombinant endorepellin was purified as documented previously (22.Mongiat M. Sweeney S.M. San Antonio J.D. Fu J. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4238-4249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) protein levels were measured with commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (MedSystems) according to the supplier's protocol. Human CathL, recombinant t-PA, and human α2-macroglobulin, a bone morphogenetic protein-1 (BMP-1) inhibitor, were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, Roche, and R&D Systems, respectively. Conditioned Media—Serum-free media conditioned by apoptotic or non-apoptotic EC were generated as described previously (18.Raymond M.A. Desormeaux A. Laplante P. Vigneault N. Filep J.G. Landry K. Pshezhetsky A.V. Hebert M.J. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 705-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 19.Laplante P. Raymond M.A. Gagnon G. Vigneault N. Sasseville A.M. Langelier Y. Bernard M.

In brief, to generate medium conditioned by non-apoptotic EC (SSC-no-apo), confluent HUVEC were exposed to the pan-caspase inhibitor ZVAD-FMK (100 μm) for 2 h, washed, and then serum-starved for 4 h in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen), whereas in medium conditioned by apoptotic EC (SSC-apo), HUVEC were instead exposed to DMSO for 2 h, washed, and then serum-starved for 4 h. For CathL inhibition, HUVEC were pretreated with ZFF-FMK (15 μm), ZFA-FMK (100 μm) or DMSO (control), washed, and serum-starved for 4 h. To inhibit t-PA proteolytic activity, HUVEC were exposed to t-PA-STOP (1.23 nmol/ml) or vehicle for 4 h during serum starvation. Conditioned media were collected and stored at -20 °C. Mitomycin C (MMC, Sigma-Aldrich) served as another pro-apoptotic stimulus (26.Raymond M.A. Mollica L. Vigneault N. Desormeaux A. Chan J.S. Filep J.G. Hebert M.J. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 515-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In brief, confluent HUVEC were grown to confluence in endothelial cell basal medium (Clonetics) and exposed to MMC at 0.01 mg/ml or vehicle for 24 h, and the conditioned media were harvested. To generate medium conditioned by autophagic EC, HUVEC grown to confluence in endothelial cell basal medium were exposed to rapamycin (Wyeth) (1 μg/ml) or vehicle for 4 h, and the conditioned media were harvested. For BMP-1/Tolloid-like metalloprotease inhibition, HUVEC were incubated with α2-macroglobulin (27 nm) or vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline/glycerol) during serum starvation for 4 h. Characterization of the Proteases Produced by Apoptotic and Non-apoptotic EC—To characterize the complete set of proteases secreted by apoptotic EC downstream of caspase activation, we tested two comparative proteomic approaches: SDS-PAGE-LC-MS/MS and two-dimensional LC-MS/MS (27.Pshezhetsky A.V. Fedjaev M. Ashmarina L. Mazur A. Budman L. Sinnett D. Labuda D. Beaulieu J.F. Menard D. Nifant'ev I. Levy E. Proteomics. 2007; 7: 2201-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). SSC-apo and SSC-no-apo were centrifuged to eliminate cell debris and apoptotic bodies (28.Hristov M. Erl W. Linder S. Weber P.C. Blood. 2004; 104: 2761-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Proteins in supernatants were concentrated, denatured, and digested with trypsin. Tryptic peptides were fractionated by weak anion exchange high performance liquid chromatography and analyzed by LC-MS/MS or resolved by SDS-PAGE, digested “in gel,” and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. In addition, to specifically characterize proteins with anti-apoptotic activity released during EC apoptosis, we conducted a functional analysis of SSC-apo, where the medium was fractionated with fast protein liquid chromatography and tested for anti-apoptotic activity on SMC. The biologically active fraction was resolved by SDS-PAGE, and bands present only in the bioactive fraction were sequenced with LC-MS/MS. Immunoblotting and in Vitro Digestion Assay—For all experiments, equal volumes of all conditioned media were concentrated by centrifugation through a 10-kDa Vivaspin concentrator according to the manufacturer's specifications (Vivascience). For in vitro digestion assays, recombinant endorepellin (148.5 ng) (22.Mongiat M. Sweeney S.M. San Antonio J.D. Fu J. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4238-4249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) was incubated with t-PA (51 ng) or CathL (37.8 ng) at 37 °C for 48 h in RPMI 1640 (total volume of 40 μl). A fixed volume for all conditions was loaded onto the gel. Proteins were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Western blotting was performed as described elsewhere (17.Raymond M.A. Vigneault N. Luyckx V. Hebert M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 20.Laplante P. Raymond M.A. Labelle A. Abe J. Iozzo R.V. Hebert M.J. J. Biol.

As a loading control, proteins from the same digestion sample were loaded on a gel and stained with Coomassie Blue. Detection of Intracellular CathL Activity—CathL activity in EC was measured with the CathL detect kits (Calbiochem) as specified by the supplier. The subcellular localization of active CathL, defined by the presence of the fluorescent product, was evaluated by confocal microscopy (Leica SP5 confocal microscope). Fluorescence Microscopy for the Assessment of Apoptosis and Necrosis—Fluorescence microscopy of unfixed/unpermeabilized adherent cells stained with Hoechst 33342 (1 μg/ml) and propidium iodide (5 μg/ml) was undertaken as described in our previous work (18.Raymond M.A. Desormeaux A.

Subcellular Localization of Proteases during Apoptosis—HUVEC were grown on glass-bottom Petri dishes (Mat-Tek Corp.) coated with 1% gelatin and serum-starved for 4 h. The cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. They were then blocked and stained with anti-t-PA antibody (American Diagnostica Inc.) and a biotinylated anti-mouse antibody (Dako) followed by a streptavidin-Alexa-488 antibody (Invitrogen). Nuclei were stained with To-Pro3/DNA (Molecular Probes) for confocal microscopy. Evaluation of Lysosomal Destabilization—Lysosomal permeabilization was assessed by fluorescence microscopy with acridine orange (Calbiochem) staining (5 μg/ml for 15 min at 37 °C) 26). Caspase-3 Silencing—HUVEC were grown on gelatin 1% until 50% confluence. The cells were then transfected with Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) employing ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool caspase-3 small interfering (si)RNA (Dharmacon RNAi Technologies, Thermo Scientific) or control siRNAs at a final concentration of 100 nm annealed oligo. After 72 h the cells were serum-starved for 4 h. To assess caspase-3 silencing, protein extracts from HUVEC were harvested and immunoblotted for caspase-3 (Abcam). Statistical Analysis—The results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. The data were analyzed by Student's t test (with Bonferroni corrections when appropriate) or analysis of variance. p < 0.05 was deemed significant for all tests. Characterization of Proteases Released during Apoptosis of EC—Using a multifaceted proteomic strategy, five proteases were identified in SSC-apo and were not found in SSC-no-apo (Table 1). CathL and t-PA were observed to have putative cleaving activity for endorepellin of potential relevance to LG3 production, according to computer simulation (ACD Protein Manager software) (Fig. 1A). To confirm this activity, human recombinant endorepellin was incubated in the presence of CathL or t-PA, and fragmentation was evaluated by immunoblotting with an antibody specific for the C-terminal LG3 motif of endorepellin. Base-line degradation of endorepellin in vitro was evident, as reported previously (25.Gonzalez E.M. Reed C.C. Bix G. Fu J. Zhang Y. Gopalakrishnan B. Greenspan D.S. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7080-7087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), yet the production of a C-terminal ∼23-kDa fragment characteristic of LG3 was enhanced in the presence of CathL or t-PA (Fig. 1B) (18.Raymond M.A. Desormeaux A.

Chem. 2005; 280: 7080-7087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), we also tested the possibility that BMP-1 could participate in apoptosis-induced LG3 production. α2-Macroglobulin, a BMP-1 inhibitor (29.Zhang Y. Ge G. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39096-39104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), did not modulate LG3 release, suggesting that BMP-1 is not involved in our system (Fig. 1C). CathL Plays a Central Role in the Generation of LG3 by Apoptotic EC—Having confirmed that CathL and t-PA cleave recombinant endorepellin, we then investigated whether inhibiting their activity during the development of EC apoptosis decreases production of the anti-apoptotic LG3 fragment. HUVEC were exposed to ZFF-FMK (15 μm) and ZFA-FMK (100 μm), two irreversible and cell-permeable CathL inhibitors, or to vehicle for 2 h and serum-starved for 4 h. 5 ml of media conditioned by HUVEC in the presence of ZFF-FMK, ZFA-FMK, or vehicle were concentrated, the same volumes were loaded, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and membranes probed for LG3. The amount of proteins released by HUVEC during serum starvation was not altered by CathL inhibition, as evaluated by Ponceau red staining (Fig. 2A). Yet both inhibitors significantly reduced LG3 release (Fig. 2A). Also, to evaluate whether inhibition of CathL activity during conditioning altered the anti-apoptotic activity of conditioned medium, the development of apoptosis was estimated in SMC and fibroblasts exposed to these conditioned media. Consistent with our previous results, serum starvation of SMC and fibroblasts for 24 h induced a significant apoptotic response (18.Raymond M.A. Desormeaux A. Laplante P. Vigneault N. Filep J.G. Landry K. Pshezhetsky A.V. Hebert M.J. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 705-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 19.Laplante P. Raymond M.A. Gagnon G. Vigneault N. Sasseville A.M. Langelier Y. Bernard M.

Chem. 2006; 281: 30383-30392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Apoptosis of SMC and fibroblasts was inhibited by medium conditioned by apoptotic HUVEC (SSC Control) (Fig. 2, B and C). Inhibition of CathL activity in HUVEC during conditioning significantly decreased the anti-apoptotic activity of conditioned medium on SMC and fibroblasts (Fig. 2, B and C). We then evaluated whether inhibiting CathL activity in HUVEC during serum starvation could reduce LG3 release through an indirect inhibitory effect on EC apoptosis. CathL inhibition in HUVEC during serum starvation did not inhibit EC apoptosis nor did it modulate necrosis, whereas the pancaspase inhibitor, ZVAD-FMK, significantly reduced apoptosis compared with the control (Fig. 2D). Increased levels of the active form of CathL (25 kDa) were found in 5 ml of SSC control compared with an equal volume of SSC produced by HUVEC in which development of apoptosis was blocked by pan-caspase inhibition (ZVAD-FMK) (Fig. 3A). Collectively, these results indicate that EC apoptosis leads to increased LG3 production at least in part through CathL-dependent proteolysis. Increased CathL levels were also found in medium conditioned by apoptotic HUVEC exposed to the DNA-damaging agent MMC compared with an equal volume of medium conditioned by non-apoptotic HUVEC (Fig. 3A) (18.Raymond M.A. Desormeaux A. Laplante P. Vigneault N. Filep J.G. Landry K. Pshezhetsky A.V. Hebert M.J. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 705-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Because serum starvation may also activate autophagy, a non-apoptotic form of programmed cell death, we tested the possibility that autophagy induction per se could activate CathL release. HUVEC were exposed to rapamycin (1 μg/ml for 4 h), a pharmacological inducer of autophagy acting through inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (30.Levine B. Kroemer G. Cell. 2008; 132: 27-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5647) Google Scholar). HUVEC exposed to rapamycin developed an autophagic response, as assessed by acridine orange staining (data not shown) in the absence of apoptosis. However, CathL levels were not increased in medium conditioned by autophagic EC (Fig. 3A). Because necrosis can result in the release of proteases (31.Zong W.X. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar), we questioned whether EC necrosis also enhanced CathL release. HUVEC were heated for 30 min at 65 °C, a method that induced primary EC necrosis in previous work (26.Raymond M.A. Mollica L. Vigneault N. Desormeaux A. Chan J.S. Filep J.G. Hebert M.J. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 515-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Active CathL levels were not increased in medium conditioned by necrotic HUVEC compared with an equal volume of medium conditioned by normal HUVEC (data not shown). These results indicate that CathL is translocated extracellularly during EC apoptosis and plays a key role in pericellular proteolysis and LG3 release but not in the regulation of EC apoptosis per se. Because proteases may directly activate receptors and signaling pathways of importance for inhibition of apoptosis, we evaluated whether CathL released by apoptotic EC exerted direct anti-apoptotic activity on target cells (32.Isermann B. Vinnikov I.A. Madhusudhan T. Herzog S. Kashif M. Blautzik J. Corat M.A. Zeier M. Blessing E. Oh J. Gerlitz B. Berg D.T. Grinnell B.W. Chavakis T. Esmon C.T. Weiler H. Bierhaus A. Nawroth P.P. Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 1349-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). SMC were exposed to SSC-apo concomitantly with ZFF-FMK or vehicle. Inhibition of CathL proteolytic activity in SMC exposed to SSC failed to blunt the anti-apoptotic response of SMC (Fig. 3B). Of note, ZFF-FMK concentrations used on SMC proved to be effective in inhibiting endorepellin cleavage during apoptosis of EC and in suppressing the anti-apoptotic activity of SSC. These results suggest that the proteolytic activity of CathL is required for the production of anti-apoptotic ECM fragments during EC apoptosis but not for the direct activation of anti-apoptotic pathways in SMC. Inhibition of t-PA activity in serum-starved EC did not prevent the development of apoptosis but attenuated LG3 production (data not shown and Fig. 4A). However, no differences were apparent in the levels of t-PA present in medium conditioned by apoptotic HUVEC (SSC control) compared with medium conditioned by non-apoptotic HUVEC (SSC ZVAD-FMK), as evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Fig. 4B), indicating that t-PA in soluble form is not incr"

Putrescine transport was increased in inverted plasma membrane vesicles prepared from cells resistant to growth inhibition by putrescine compared with transport in inverted vesicles prepared from non-selected cells. Knockdown of SLC3A2 in human cells, using short hairpin RNA, caused an increase in putrescine uptake and a decrease in arginine uptake activity. SLC3A2 knockdown cells accumulated higher polyamine levels and grew faster than control cells. The growth of SLC3A2 knockdown cells was inhibited by high concentrations of putrescine. Knockdown of SLC3A2 reduced export of polyamines from cells. Expression of SLC3A2 was suppressed in human HCT116 colon cancer cells, which have an activated K-RAS, compared with their isogenic clone, Hkh2 cells, which lack an activated K-RAS allele. Spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SAT1) was co-immunoprecipitated by an anti-SLC3A2 antibody as was SLC3A2 with an anti-SAT1 antibody. SLC3A2 and SAT1 colocalized on the plasma membrane. These data provide the first molecular characterization of a polyamine exporter in animal cells and indicate that the diamine putrescine is exported by an arginine transporter containing SLC3A2, whose expression is negatively regulated by K-RAS. The interaction between SLC3A2 and SAT1 suggests that these proteins may facilitate excretion of acetylated polyamines.

CHO-T cells were isolated previously (30Pastorian K.E. Byus C.V. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 284-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The Hkh2 cell line, an isogenic clone of HCT116 that lacks the activated K-RAS allele, was kindly provided by Dr. Shirasawa, Research Institute, International Medical Center of Japan (33Shirasawa S. Furuse M. Yokoyama N. Sasazuki T. Science. 1993; 260: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Dulbecco's modified essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin was used for culturing HCT116 and Hkh2 cells. G418 (0.6 mg/ml) was supplemented for Hkh2 cells. Modified essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin was used for growth of CHO cells. CHO-T cells were grown in medium supplemented with 15 mm putrescine. Cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Preparation of Membrane Vesicles—Inside-out membrane vesicles were prepared by the method of Schaub et al. (34Schaub T. Ishikawa T. Keppler D. FEBS Lett. 1991; 279: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and Saxena and Henderson (35Saxena M. Henderson G.B. J. Biol.

One to 2 g of cells were suspended in hypotonic buffer (0.5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and stirred slowly at 4 °C for 16 h. Unbroken cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 3500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. White fluffy material was collected and homogenized in hypotonic buffer with a 15-ml Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. The homogenate was layered onto 14 ml of a 38% sucrose solution and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The turbid layer at the interface was collected into 25 ml of TS buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, and 50 mm NaCl) and pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. After suspending in 5 ml of TS buffer, vesicles were formed by passing the suspension through a 27-gauge needle with a syringe. Inside-out vesicles were enriched by applying to a column of wheat germ agglutinin-linked CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B equilibrated with TS buffer. Unbound inside-out vesicles were resuspended in TS buffer and stored at –70 °C. Putrescine Uptake by Inside-out Membrane Vesicles—Assays were performed as described by Xie et al. (29Xie X. Gillies R.J. Gerner E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20484-20489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture containing 100 mg of protein of membrane vesicles, 10 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 100 μg/ml creatine kinase, 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 μm [3H]putrescine (37 MBq/mmol; GE Healthcare) was prepared on ice. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C, and putrescine uptake was terminated by placing the reaction mixture on ice and diluting with 1 ml of ice-cold stop buffer (250 mm sucrose, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MES, pH 5.5). The vesicles were collected by rapid filtration onto premoistened Millipore HAWP 0.45-μm filters and washed four times with stop buffer. Radioactivity on the filters was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. Liquid Chromatography Coupled to Tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS/MS) Analysis—CHO-T and CHO-S membrane proteins (100 μg) were run on an 11-cm immobilized pH gradient strip, pH 5–8, then resolved on a 8.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and stained using silver solution (2.5% silver nitrate and 37% formaldehyde). Bands highly expressed in CHO-T membrane were excised and digested with trypsin for 16 h (36Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7807) Google Scholar). The peptides extracted from the gel following digestion were analyzed by a ThermoFinnigan (San Jose, CA) LCQ DECA XP PLUS ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with a Michrom (Auburn, CA) Paradigm MS4 high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) instrument and a nanoelectrospray source. Peptides were eluted from a 15-cm pulled tip capillary column (100-μm inner diameter × 360-μm outer diameter; 3–5-μm tip opening) packed with 7 cm of Vydac (Hesperia, CA) C18 material (5 μm, 300-Å pore size) using a gradient of 0–65% solvent B (98% methanol, 2% water, 0.5% formic acid, and 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid) over a 60-min period at a flow rate of 350 nl/min. The LCQ electrospray positive mode spray voltage was set at 1.6 kV, and the capillary temperature was set at 180 °C. Dependent data scanning was performed by Xcalibur software (37Andon N.L. Hollingworth S. Koller A. Greenland A.J. Yates III, J.R. Haynes P.A. Proteomics. 2002; 2: 1156-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) with a default charge of 2, an isolation width of 1.5 atomic mass units, an activation amplitude of 35%, an activation time of 30 ms, and a minimal signal of 1000 ion counts (arbitrary units based on the mass spectrometer used). Global dependent data settings were as follows: reject mass width of 1.5 atomic mass units, dynamic exclusion enabled, exclusion mass width of 1.5 atomic mass units, repeat count of 1, repeat duration of 1 min, and exclusion duration of 5 min. Scan event series included one full scan with mass range 350–2000 Da followed by three dependent MS/MS scans of the most intense ion. Tandem MS spectra of peptides were analyzed with TurboSEQUEST™, a program that allows the correlation of experimental tandem MS data with theoretical spectra generated from known protein sequences (38Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Yates III, J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5420) Google Scholar). Parent peptide mass error tolerance was set at 1.5 atomic mass units, and fragment ion mass tolerance was set at 0.5 atomic mass unit during the search. The criteria that were used for a preliminary positive peptide identification are the same as described previously (39Cooper B. Eckert D. Andon N.L. Yates J.R. Haynes P.A. J. Am. Soc. Mass. Spectrom. 2003; 14: 736-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), namely peptide precursor ions with a +1 charge having an Xcorr >1.8, +2 charge having an Xcorr >2.5, and +3 charge having an Xcorr >3.5. A ΔCn score >0.08 and a fragment ion ratio of experimental/theoretical >50% were also used as filtering criteria for reliable matched peptide identification (39Cooper B. Eckert D. Andon N.L. Yates J.R. Haynes P.A. J. Am. Soc. Mass. Spectrom. 2003; 14: 736-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). All spectra were searched against the latest version of the non-redundant protein data base downloaded July 7, 2006 from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Transfection—SureSilencing shRNA plasmid for human SLC3A2 (Bioscience Corp.) was transfected to Hkh2 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfected cells were selected by the resistance to 2 μg/ml puromycin. Knockdown of SLC3A2 was confirmed by semiquantitative PCR. Semiquantitative PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. One microgram of total RNA was treated with RNase-free deoxyribonuclease I (Fermentas Life Science) and reverse transcribed into cDNA using the Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Fermentas Life Science). The DNA fragments of SLC3A2, SAT1, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were amplified using primer sets of SLC3A2_F (5′-TTTTCAGCTACGGGGATGAGAT-3′) and SLC3A2_R (5′-GCAGAAAACACCCTATTTGG-3′) for SLC3A2, SAT1_F (5′-TTTTACCACTGCCTGGTTGC-3′) and SAT1_R (5′-AACAGAAACTCTAAGTACCAGTGTG-3′) for SAT1, and GAPDH_F (5′-TGGTATCGTGGAAGGACTCGTGGAAGGACTCATGAC-3′) and GAPDH_R (5′-AGAGTCCAGTGAGCTTCCCGTTCAGC-3′) for GAPDH. Western Blotting—Cells were washed with buffered saline and lysed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 500 μm sodium orthovanadate, and 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Forty micrograms of protein were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred electrophoretically to a Hybond-C nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 30 min at room temperature. SLC3A2, SAT1, and β-tubulin were detected by the ECL Western blotting detection system (GE Healthcare) using anti-SLC3A2 (1:1000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-SAT1 (1:1000 dilution; Sigma), and anti-β-tubulin (1:10,000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as primary antibodies. Transport Assay in Cells—Assays were performed as described by Tahara et al. (40Tahara H. Kusuhara H. Maeda K. Koepsell H. Fuse E. Sugiyama Y. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2006; 34: 743-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) with modification. One million cells were plated in a 6-well plate and cultured for 2 days. After the medium was aspirated, cells were washed twice with assay buffer containing 5 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 145 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm glucose and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C in the same buffer. Uptake was started by the addition of 2 mm [3H]putrescine (37 MBq/mmol; GE Healthcare), 2 mm [14C]arginine (37 MBq/mmol; GE Healthcare), or 2 mm [14C]ornithine (37 MBq/mmol; GE Healthcare). After incubation for varying times, cells were washed twice with ice-cold assay buffer containing 20 mm putrescine, arginine, or ornithine. Cells were lysed in 0.5 n NaOH, and radioactivity was counted using a Beckman LS 5000TD scintillation counter. Total cellular protein content was determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay solution (Pierce). Measurement of Polyamine Content in Cells—Three million cells were homogenized in 0.2 n HClO4. An acid-soluble fraction was separated by reverse-phase ion pair HPLC, and polyamines were detected as described elsewhere (41Seiler N. Knodgen B. J. Chromatogr. 1980; 221: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). An acid-insoluble fraction was used for determination of protein amount by the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Diamine Export Assay in Cells—One million cells were plated in a 6-well plate and cultured for 1 day. Cells were washed three times and incubated in 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified essential medium without FBS at 37 °C. After 8 h, the medium was removed, and diamines exported into the medium were measured by HPLC. Cells were washed with buffered saline and counted. Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation was performed using the method of Torrents et al. (42Torrents D. Estevez R. Pineda M. Fernandez E. Lloberas J. Shi Y.B. Zorzano A. Palacin M. J. Biol.

Hkh2 cells were detached from culture flasks mechanically and washed with buffered saline. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and proteinase inhibitor mixture. One hundred micrograms of cell lysate were incubated with anti-SLC3A2, anti-SAT1, or anti-ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) at 4 °C for 16 h. Lysates were incubated with protein G-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 16 h at 4 °C and washed five times with lysis buffer. Beads were suspended with 40 μl of SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-acrylamide gel, transferred to a Hybond-C nitrocellulose membrane, and detected as described above. Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Hkh2 cells were cultured on coverslips, washed with buffered saline, and fixed in 5% formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then treated with methanol for 6 min at –20 °C and acetone for 30 s at –20 °C. Cells were treated with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with primary antibody (1:100 dilution of goat anti-SLC3A2 and rabbit anti-SAT1) for 16 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed five times with the same buffer and incubated with fluorophore-labeled secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution of Alexa 633-conjugated anti-goat IgG and Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (both from Molecular probes)) for 16 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed five times and mounted in Prolong Gold Mounting Solution (Clontech). Fluorescence was visualized using a Nikon confocal microscope. Identification of Proteins Highly Expressed in CHO-T Cells—To identify and characterize the polyamine exporter, we isolated CHO-T cells (30Pastorian K.E. Byus C.V. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 284-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These cells showed resistance to the high exogenous concentrations of putrescine, whereas the growth of non-selected CHO-S cells was inhibited by more than 10 mm putrescine (Fig. 1A). Putrescine uptake by inside-out membrane vesicles prepared from CHO-T cells was significantly higher than the same vesicles prepared from CHO-S cells (Fig. 1B). This result indicates that the resistance of CHO-T cells to the high concentrations of putrescine was associated with elevated putrescine export. We looked for proteins highly expressed in CHO-T cells, compared with CHO-S cells, by proteomics analysis. Membrane proteins of CHO-T and CHO-S cells were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and bands highly expressed in the plasma membrane of CHO-T were subjected to peptide sequencing by liquid chromatography followed by tandem mass spectrometry. Data base searching revealed the sequence of several proteins that were highly expressed in the plasma membrane of CHO-T cells (supplemental information). Among these, there were two transport proteins, SLC3A2, a glycosylated heavy chain of a cationic amino acid transporter, and SLC6A19, a Na+-dependent neutral amino acid transporter. Because polyamines and diamines are positively charged in physiological conditions, we examined whether the SLC3A2-containing transporter was involved in the export of diamines. SLC3A2-dependent Putrescine, Arginine, and Ornithine Transport—We tested putrescine transport activity of the SLC3A2-containing transporter in colon cancer cells because polyamine transport plays an important role in colon carcinogenesis (43Gerner E.W. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2007; 35: 322-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We used the Hkh2 cell line, which is an isogenic clone of HCT116 colon carcinoma cells lacking its activated K-RAS allele. Stable transfection of a plasmid encoding shRNA for SLC3A2 reduced both mRNA and protein levels of SLC3A2 to 50% (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2B shows putrescine, arginine, and ornithine uptake by SLC3A2 knockdown cells and control plasmid-transfected cells. Putrescine uptake was higher in SLC3A2 knockdown cells than control cells, whereas arginine uptake was lower. Ornithine uptake was not changed. Effect of SLC3A2 on Cell Growth—The growth rate of SLC3A2 knockdown cells was determined. SLC3A2 knockdown cells grew faster than control cells (Fig. 3A). The sensitivity of these cells to exogenous putrescine was examined. SLC3A2 knockdown cells were more sensitive to high concentrations of putrescine than control cells (Fig. 3B). The polyamine contents of these cells cultured in the presence or absence of 20 mm putrescine were determined (Fig. 3C). Putrescine and N1-acetylspermidine contents were elevated in SLC3A2 knockdown cells grown in medium lacking supplemented putrescine. N8-Acetylspermidine was not detected. Intracellular levels of putrescine were further increased when these cells were cultured in the presence of 20 mm putrescine, whereas spermidine and spermine levels were decreased. SLC3A2-dependent Polyamine Export—To confirm that SLC3A2 was involved in export of polyamines, the effect of SLC3A2 knockdown on polyamine export from cells was examined. SLC3A2 knockdown and control cells were incubated in medium without FBS for 8 h, and polyamines exported into the medium were measured. As shown in Fig. 4, putrescine, spermidine, spermine, and acetylated spermidine were exported at lower levels into the medium of SLC3A2 knockdown cells compared with control cells. Regulation of SLC3A2 by K-RAS—Uptake of polyamines is mediated by caveolae-dependent endocytosis in colon epithelial cells, and K-RAS positively regulates polyamine uptake through phosphorylation of caveolin-1 protein (24Roy U.K. Rial N.S. Kachel K.L. Gerner E.W. Mol. Carcinog. 2008; 47: 538-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). K-RAS also contributes to the regulation of intracellular polyamine content by up-regulating ODC (44Ignatenko N.A. Zhang H. Watts G.S. Skovan B.A. Stringer D.E. Gerner E.W. Mol. Carcinog. 2004; 39: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether SLC3A2 was regulated by K-RAS. The polyamine content in HCT116, a colon cancer cell line expressing a mutant K-RAS, and its isogenic clone, Hkh2, which lacks the activated K-RAS allele, was determined (Fig. 5). Putrescine, spermidine, and N1-acetylspermidine were significantly decreased in Hkh2 cells. Spermine and cadaverine showed similar levels in the two cell line clones. HCT116 cells grew faster than Hkh2 cells (data not shown). The protein and mRNA levels of SLC3A2 were determined (Fig. 6). Both the protein level (Fig. 6A) and mRNA level (Fig. 6B) were also higher in Hkh2 compared with the isogenic HCT116 cells. These results indicate that the expression of SLC3A2 was negatively regulated by K-RAS. SAT1, the polyamine-catabolizing enzyme that catalyzes spermine and spermidine acetylation, is also regulated by K-RAS. The protein levels of SAT1 were higher in Hkh2 cells, whereas the mRNA levels were not changed (Fig. 6). This result indicates that SAT1 expression is regulated by K-RAS at the post-transcriptional level in these cells.FIGURE 6The expression of SLC3A2 was negatively regulated by K-RAS. The protein and mRNA levels of SLC3A2 and SAT1 in HCT116 and Hkh2 cells were determined by Western blotting (A) and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR (B) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” β-Tubulin and GAPDH levels are shown as loading control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) SLC3A2 Interaction with SAT1—It has been reported that SLC3A2 interacts with and mediates integrin signaling (45Feral C.C. Zijlstra A. Tkachenko E. Prager G. Gardel M.L. Slepak M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 701-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and that SAT1 interacts with a cytoplasmic domain of specific integrins (46Chen C. Young B.A. Coleman C.S. Pegg A.E. Sheppard D. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These reports led us to hypothesize that SLC3A2 and SAT1 may form a complex at the plasma membrane. To test this possibility, the interaction of SLC3A2 and SAT1 was assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoprecipitation (Fig. 7). SLC3A2 and SAT1 were colocalized on the plasma membrane (Fig. 7A). SAT1 was co-immunoprecipitated by anti-SLC3A2 antibody as was SLC3A2 with anti-SAT1 antibody. A low amount of SAT1 was co-immunoprecipitated by anti-ODC1 antibody (Fig. 7B). These results indicate that SLC3A2 and SAT1 form a complex on the plasma membrane and suggest a functional consequence for this complex. In this study, we identified and characterized SLC3A2 as a part of DAX. SLC3A2 was one of the proteins that were highly expressed in CHO-T cells compared with CHO-S cells. Knockdown of SLC3A2 using shRNA increased putrescine uptake and decreased arginine uptake in colon cancer cells. Polyamine contents in SLC3A2 knockdown cells were increased, and cell growth was stimulated. High concentrations of exogenous putrescine inhibited cell growth of SLC3A2 knockdown cells more than in control cells. Supplementation of culture medium with putrescine caused an increase in both putrescine and monoacetylspermidine in the cells, both substrates for export by DAX (29Xie X. Gillies R.J. Gerner E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20484-20489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Knockdown of SLC3A2 reduced polyamine export from cells. These results indicate that SLC3A2 is involved in the export of the diamine putrescine and monoacetylated spermidine. Immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation studies indicated that SLC3A2 and SAT1 form a protein complex on the plasma membrane. The proximity between SLC3A2 and SAT1 may facilitate the export of acetylated polyamines, the products of SAT1 activity, by the adjacent exporter containing SLC3A2 when cellular polyamine levels reached high levels. Our result also suggests that ODC may interact with SAT1 (Fig. 7B). ODC has been reported to translocate to the plasma membrane (47Heiskala M. Zhang J. Hayashi S. Holtta E. Andersson L.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1214-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The interaction of SAT1 and ODC support the association of ODC to the plasma membrane and may suggest a mechanism for metabolic channeling of biosynthesis and acetylation of polyamines. Experiments in Hkh2 cells (Fig. 2) showed that the exporter that contains the SLC3A2 catalyzes putrescine export and arginine uptake, suggesting a putrescine/arginine exchange reaction. Arginine is metabolized to ornithine, a precursor of putrescine biosynthesis. Arginine also is a substrate for nitricoxide (NO) synthase in the production of NO. NO is required for polyamine uptake (23Belting M. Mani K. Jonsson M. Cheng F. Sandgren S. Jonsson S. Ding K. Delcros J.G. Fransson L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47181-47189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). DAX containing SLC3A2 may play an important role in regulation of cellular polyamine level not only by export of polyamines but also by modulating cellular arginine and the NO level to enhance polyamine uptake. This hypothesis is currently under examination. Putrescine accumulated in cells when they were cultured in the presence of 20 mm putrescine. Spermidine and spermine were decreased in these cells (Fig. 3C). This result indicated that biosynthesis of spermidine and spermine was down-regulated by high levels of intracellular putrescine. Biosynthesis of spermidine and spermine requires supplementation of a methyl group from decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine. Putrescine accumulation can deplete S-adenosylmethionine due to the excess usage for biosynthesis of spermidine and spermine (48Tome M.E. Fiser S.M. Gerner E.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 158: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and this depletion might be the mechanism for reduced spermidine and spermine pools seen in these experiments. Knockdown of SLC3A2 decreased the export of putrescine and monoacetylated spermidine as well as spermidine and spermine (Fig. 4). Because spermidine and spermine are not substrates for DAX (29Xie X. Gillies R.J. Gerner E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20484-20489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), SLC3A2 may influence other exporters associated with spermidine and spermine export. The detection of relatively high levels of N8-acetylspermidine in Fig. 4 could be due to the growth of cultures in serum-free medium. We used medium without FBS for the export assay because FBS contains amine oxidase (49Bachrach U. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1970; 171: 939-956Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The SLC3A2-dependent putrescine export rate (0.02 nmol/h/mg of protein) was comparable with the difference in putrescine accumulation in SLC3A2 knockdown and control cells (1 nmol/48 h/mg of protein) cultured with 20 mm putrescine (Fig. 2). FBS did not appear to influence the activity of DAX. We found that K-RAS negatively regulated SLC3A2 and SAT1 expression. K-RAS acts to elevate intracellular polyamine contents by increasing polyamine uptake (24Roy U.K. Rial N.S. Kachel K.L. Gerner E.W. Mol. Carcinog. 2008; 47: 538-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and biosynthesis (44Ignatenko N.A. Zhang H. Watts G.S. Skovan B.A. Stringer D.E. Gerner E.W. Mol. Carcinog. 2004; 39: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 50Linsalata M. Notarnicola M. Caruso M.G. Di Leo A. Guerra V. Russo F. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 2004; 39: 470-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and suppressing degradation (51Ignatenko N.A. Babbar N. Mehta D. Casero Jr., R.A. Gerner E.W. Mol. Carcinog. 2004; 39: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Our results show that K-RAS also can down-regulate polyamine export to increase cellular polyamine content. Polyamine uptake and export have significant roles in colon carcinogenesis as dietary and intestinal luminal polyamines influence this process (52Hessels J. Kingma A.W. Ferwerda H. Keij J. van den Berg G.A. Muskiet F.A. Int. J. Cancer. 1989; 43: 1155-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 53Loser C. Eisel A. Harms D. Folsch U.R. Gut. 1999; 44: 12-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The tumor suppression effect of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug sulindac is reduced by dietary polyamines (54Ignatenko N.A. Besselsen D.G. Roy U.K. Stringer D.E. Blohm-Mangone K.A. Padilla-Torres J.L. Guillen-R J.M. Gerner E.W. Nutr. Cancer. 2006; 56: 172-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Understanding polyamine transport mechanisms may be important for the development of new strategies for cancer treatment and chemoprevention. Our results provide the first evidence of molecular characterization of polyamine export in colon epithelial cells. A model depicting DAX is summarized in Fig. 8. DAX is a heterodimer composed of SLC3A2 and a y+ LAT light chain. The SLC3A2-containing transporter catalyzes export of putrescine and acetylpolyamines via arginine exchange activity. SAT1 may interact with SLC3A2 to couple acetylation and export of the longer chain polyamines, spermidine and spermine. K-RAS negatively regulates SLC3A2 and SAT1 expression.

https://openalex.org/W2010940056,"Class three semaphorins (SEMAs) were originally shown to be mediators of axon guidance that repelled axons and collapsed growth cones, but it is now evident that SEMA3F, for example, has similar effects on tumor cells and endothelial cells (EC). In both human U87MG glioma cells and human umbilical vein EC, SEMA3F induced rapid cytoskeletal collapse, suppressed cell contractility, decreased phosphorylation of cofilin, and inhibited cell migration in culture. Analysis of the signaling pathways showed that SEMA3F formed a complex with NRP2 (neuropilin-2) and plexin A1. These interactions eventually led to inactivation of the small GTPase, RhoA, which is necessary for stress fiber formation and cytoskeleton integrity. A novel upstream RhoA mediator was shown to be ABL2, also known as ARG, a membrane-anchored nonreceptor tyrosine kinase. Within minutes after the addition of SEMA3F, ABL2 directly bound plexin A1 but not to a plexin A1 mutant lacking the cytoplasmic domain. In addition, ABL2 phosphorylated and thereby activated p190RhoGAP, which inactivated RhoA (GTP to GDP), resulting in cytoskeleton collapse and inhibition of cell migration. On the other hand, cells overexpressing an ABL2 inactive kinase mutant or treated with ABL2 small interfering RNA did not inactivate RhoA. Cells treated with p190RhoGAP small interfering RNA also did not inactivate RhoA.

There are at least nine plexins: A1-A4, B1-B3, C1, and D1 (8.Takahashi T. Fournier A. Nakamura F. Wang L.H. Murakami Y. Kalb R.G. Fujisawa H. Strittmatter S.M.

Plexins A1 and A2 form a complex with NRP2 when it binds SEMA3F (12.Takahashi T. Strittmatter S.M. Neuron. 2001; 29: 429-439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). NRP2 signaling is also mediated by plexin A3 in the mouse embryonic nervous system (13.Yaron A. Huang P.H. Cheng H.J. Tessier-Lavigne M. Neuron. 2005; 45: 513-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). An exception appears to be SEMA3E, which is not dependent on NRPs but acts directly via plexin D1 to repel blood vessels (14.Gu C. Yoshida Y. Livet J. Reimert D.V. Mann F. Merte J. Henderson C.E. Jessell T.M. Kolodkin A.L. Ginty D.D. Science. 2005; 307: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar).Most of the SEMA3 mechanistic studies have been carried out in neurons. Early studies showed that SEMA3A repelled axons and collapsed axonal growth cones by depolymerizing F-actin and inducing lamellipodia retraction in dorsal root ganglia (15.Fan J. Mansfield S.G. Redmond T. Gordon-Weeks P.R. Raper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 867-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 16.Raper J.A. Kapfhammer J.P. Neuron. 1990; 4: 21-29Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). We had demonstrated that SEMA3A (originally known as collapsin-1) was an inhibitor of endothelial cell (EC) motility, possibly the first study showing that a semaphorin could affect nonneuronal cell types (5.Miao H.Q. Soker S. Feiner L. Alonso J.L. Raper J.A. Klagsbrun M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SEMA3A depolymerized EC F-actin and retracted lamellipodia in a manner similar to what occurs in neurons. Our subsequent studies in EC and tumor cells showed that SEMA3F, in an NRP2-dependent manner, inhibited cell adhesion, cell migration in vitro, and tumor angiogenesis and metastasis in vivo (6.Bielenberg D.R. Hida Y. Shimizu A. Kaipainen A. Kreuter M. Kim C.C. Klagsbrun M. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 1260-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). This activity is dependent on plexins.We have found that SEMA3F had a striking effect on tumor cell and EC morphology, causing cytoskeleton collapse, loss of stress fibers, loss of adhesion, and depolymerization of F-actin, rapidly within minutes. Cell migration was also inhibited. The loss of stress fibers suggested an inactivation of RhoA. RhoA is a small GTPase that plays a central role in the control of cell shape, cytoskeletal organization, and cell motility by regulating actomyosin-based tension generation and actin polymerization that, in turn, govern formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions (17.Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3796) Google Scholar). Activated RhoA stimulated Rho kinase and thereby enhanced myosin light chain phosphorylation. Contractility of the actomyosin network promoted actin filament alignment and stress fiber formation. Rho kinase also activated LIM kinase, which phosphorylated cofilin, inhibiting its ability to bind and depolymerize actin (18.Amano M. Ito M. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Chihara K. Nakano T. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20246-20249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar, 19.Huang T.Y. DerMardirossian C. Bokoch G.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 26-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that SEMA3F inactivated RhoA and activated cofilin in tumor and endothelial cells, consistent with similar effects of semaphorins on neurons. However, little is known about the mechanisms by which SEMA3F inactivates RhoA. Accordingly, we have analyzed the upstream signaling pathway that ends up inactivating RhoA and causing cytoskeleton collapse of human U87MG glioma cells and HUVEC. This pathway includes physical interactions between SEMA3F, NRP2, plexin A1, p190RhoGAP, and, importantly, ABL2.The Abelson (ABL2) tyrosine kinase (v-Abl Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2), which is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, is a novel mediator of RhoA inactivation. Drosophila Abl and the mammalian homologues Abl1 and Abl2, also known as ARG (Abelson-related gene), have a role in axonogenesis and cancer (20.Gertler F.B. Bennett R.L. Clark M.J. Hoffmann F.M. Cell. 1989; 58: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 21.Koleske A.J. Gifford A.M. Scott M.L. Nee M. Bronson R.T. Miczek K.A. Baltimore D. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1259-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The domain structure of Abl has been analyzed and consists of an N terminus region that is a myristylation site, Src homology 3, Src homology 2, and tyrosine kinase domains, and a large C-terminal region (22.Hernandez S.E. Krishnaswami M. Miller A.L. Koleske A.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 36-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The Src homology 3 domain inhibits tyrosine kinase activity, and deletion of the Src homology 3 domain activates tyrosine kinase activity (22.Hernandez S.E. Krishnaswami M. Miller A.L. Koleske A.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 36-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar).In this report, we show that ABL2 and RhoA play key roles in mediating SEMA3F-induced collapsing activity in tumor cells and EC. ABL2 bound to plexin A1, on one hand, and to p190RhoGAP on the other. Upon binding, ABL2 phosphorylated p190RhoGAP and activated it, leading to the inactivation of RhoA. Inactivation of RhoA affected several downstream kinase events (e.g. dephosphorylation of cofilin), resulting in depolymerization and severing of F-actin, thereby collapsing the cytoskeleton and inhibiting cell migration. We conclude that ABL2/ARG is a novel mediator of SEMA3F-induced RhoA inactivation and collapsing activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsAntibodies—Anti-NRP1, -NRP2, -VEGFR1, -VEGFR2, -cofilin, -ABL2, and -RhoA were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.

PAE/NRP1 and PAE/NRP2 were described previously (23.Geretti E. Shimizu A. Kurschat P. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25698-25707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). HUVEC purchased from Lonza Inc. (Allendale, NJ) were cultured in EBM-2 (Lonza), supplemented with EGM-2 Single Quote.Mutagenesis and ConstructA site-directed mutagenesis kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was used to mutate cofilin and ABL2. The plexin A1 cytoplasmic domain-deleted mutant was generated by using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The sequences of primers are described above. The amplified cDNA was inserted to pcDNA3.1 TOPO vector (Invitrogen).Purification of Human Recombinant SEMA3FThe SEMA3F construct was transfected into HEK293 cells to express SEMA3F protein. After 16 h, the culture medium, including 10% fetal bovine serum, was changed to CD293 serum-free medium (Invitrogen) for a further 48-h incubation. The conditioned medium was collected and applied to a HiTrap HP Chelating column (GE Healthcare) with nickel divalent cation. Proteins were eluted with 500 mm imidazole. The eluate was desalted by a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare). The protein concentration was measured by a DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Approximately 3 mg of SEMA3F protein was purified from 15 tissue culture dishes (15 cm).VideographyCells were pipetted into chambers formed by mounting a glass coverslip onto a 35-mm glass bottom dish. Preparations were maintained at 37 °C with constant 5% carbon dioxide gas infusion using an Incubator XL-3 incubation chamber (Carl Zeiss) and examined on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope equipped with a ×63 objective (numerical aperture 1.4) and ×1.6 optivar. Images were acquired with an Orca IIER cooled charged-coupled device camera (Hamamatsu). Electronic shutters and image acquisition were under the control of Metamorph software (Universal Imaging of Molecular Devices, Downington, PA). Images were acquired every 1-5 min with an image capture time of 50-100 ms. Movies were generated using the Metamorph image analysis program.Confocal MicroscopySEMA3F (0-640 ng/ml) was added to HUVEC and U87MG cells, which were cultured on coverglasses with a density of 1-2 × 104 cells/well in a 6-well plate. After 30 min, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, followed by permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. F-actin and nuclei were stained with Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin (Invitrogen) and bis-benzimide (Hoescht 33258; Sigma), respectively. The mounted samples on slide glasses were imaged on a Leica TCS SP2 confocal laser-scanning microscope equipped with a ×63 objective (numerical aperture 1.4), 488-nm argon ion laser (F-actins), and 405-nm diode (nuclei). Leica Confocal Software and NIH Image software (ImageJ) were used to scale recorded images.siRNA KnockdownTransient transfection of siRNAs was performed using SILENTFECT reagent (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's directions. After 48-70 h, cells were analyzed for effects of the knockdown. Silencing efficiency was confirmed by Western blotting and reverse transcription-PCR.Inhibition of NRP2siRNA for NRP2 and an irrelevant sequence were transfected into U87MG cells. After a 48-h incubation, SEMA3F (80 ng/ml) was added. Anti-NRP2 antibody (20 μg/ml) and normal goat immunoglobulin as a control were added to U87MG cells. After a 30-min incubation, SEMA3F was added to the cells, which were then analyzed by confocal microscopy.MigrationMigration assays were performed in Transwells® (Corning Glass) with an 8.0-μm pore size. The polycarbonate membrane of the upper wells was coated with a 0.5% gelatin solution. Cells (2.5 × 104) in serum-free minimum essential medium were added to upper wells. Increasing concentrations of SEMA3F, including 1% fetal bovine serum, were added to the lower wells. Cells that had migrated through the filter after 14 h at 37 °C were stained with Difquick (Dade Behring Inc., Newark, DE) and counted by phase microscopy.Cell ContractilityCell contractility was measured by the traction force microscopy method using fluorescent beads. The bead displacements that accounted for contractility were visualized and quantitated as previously described (25.Dembo M. Wang Y.L. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2307-2316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 26.Pelham Jr., R.J. Wang Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13661-13665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2426) Google Scholar). Briefly, U87MG cells (1 × 105 cells) were plated on a flexible polyacrylamide gel (0.25% bis and 2% acrylamide; <70 mm thick) coated with fibronectin (0.1 mg/ml) that contained red fluorescent nanobeads (200-nm diameter; Invitrogen) as markers. After the addition of SEMA3F (320 ng/ml), fluorescent microscope images were recorded at 0-30 min. The traction field was calculated from the displacement field using Mat-Lab software.RhoA ActivityRhoA activity assays were performed and quantified using the RhoA activation assay kit based on rhotekin pull-down according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cytoskeleton). U87MG cells (1.5 × 106 cells) were incubated with SEMA3F (320 ng/ml) for 0-30 min. The cells were washed with PBS and extracted in 600 μl of cell lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100). Samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 8000 rpm, and the supernatant was incubated with rhotekin beads for 1.5 h at 4 °C. After washing the beads with buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 40 mm NaCl, 15 mm MgCl2), proteins were removed from the beads in Laemmli buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. Similarly, Rac1 and Cdc42 levels were examined using a Rac activation kit (Cytoskeleton).RhoA LentivirusThe HA-tagged wild type and constitutively active (G14V) forms of RhoA were constructed and subcloned into the pHAGE lentiviral backbone vector as described (27.Mostoslavsky G. Kotton D.N. Fabian A.J. Gray J.T. Lee J.S. Mulligan R.C. Mol. Ther. 2005; 11: 932-940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 28.Mammoto T. Parikh S.M. Mammoto A.

U87MG cells were incubated with wild type or constitutively active (G14V) RhoA lentiviruses in the presence of 5 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). About 90-100% infection efficiency was achieved by 3 days.ImmunoprecipitationOne mg of U87MG cell lysates lysed in 20 mm HEPES, 1% Triton X-100, and 150 mm sodium chloride was incubated with either anti-HA (plexin A1), anti-p190A, or anti-ABL2 antibody for 16 h. Alternatively, ice-cold radioimmune precipitation buffer (Boston Bioproducts, Worcester, MA) supplemented with complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) was incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10). Protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) was used to pull down antibodies. After washing the beads with the lysis buffer, proteins were removed from the beads in Laemmli buffer and analyzed by Western blotting.ImmunoblotU87MG cells and HUVEC were lysed with ice-cold radioimmune precipitation buffer (Boston Bioproducts) supplemented with complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitor mixture I and II (Sigma). Proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes and immunoblotted with antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) and chemiluminescent substrates (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were used to detect primary antibodies.ApoptosisSEMA3F (640 ng/ml) was added to U87MG cells. After 24 h, caspase activity was measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (29.Amstad P.A. Yu G. Johnson G.L. Lee B.W. Dhawan S. Phelps D.J. BioTechniques. 2001; 31 (612, 614, passim): 608-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) using the Vybrant FAM polycaspases kit (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. As a positive control, the U87MG cells were irradiated with UV (100 mJ).RESULTSSEMA3F Induces Cytoskeletal Collapse in HUVEC and U87MG Cells—HUVEC and U87MG glioma cells were stimulated with SEMA3F and analyzed by time lapse videomicroscopy. The complete videos are shown in the supplemental data (Movies S1 and S2). Analysis of selected frames showed that within 30 min after the addition of SEMA3F, the cells rounded up, were less spread and less adherent (Fig. 1A, a and b for HUVEC; e and f for U87MG cells). Both cell types decreased dramatically in size, up to 30-40% in total area by 25 min. There were retraction fibers remaining on the extracellular matrix. Confocal microscopy showed that HUVEC (Fig. 1A, c) and U87MG glioma cells (Fig. 1A, g) were adherent and well spread and displayed abundant actin stress fibers, indicative of an intact F-actin cytoskeleton. However, in the presence of SEMA3F, HUVEC (Fig. 1A, d) and U87MG cells (Fig. 1A, h) were less adherent and had lost their stress fibers, indicative of F-actin cytoskeleton collapse (Fig. 1A, f and h). Thus, the time lapse videography and confocal microscopy were consistent. After overnight incubation with no further SEMA3F treatment, the cells recovered their stress fibers and were able to proliferate, which suggests that SEMA3F treatment did not appear to be toxic for the cells. In addition, lack of caspase activity indicated that these cells were not undergoing apoptosis (Fig. S4).The Cytoskeleton-collapsing Effects of SEMA3F Are Mediated by NRP2—Immunoblot analysis showed that U87MG cells and HUVEC expressed NRP2, the functional receptor for SEMA3F (Fig. 1B). HUVEC and U87MG cells also expressed NRP1, the functional receptor for SEMA3A. HUVEC, but not U87MG cells, expressed both VEGF receptor tyrosine kinases, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2. Thus, in HUVEC, VEGF165 could bind to NRPs and VEGF RTKs, whereas in U87MG cells, VEGF165 could bind NRPs only (not shown). U87MG cells expressed plexins A1, A2, A3, and A4 (not shown). Plexin A1 is required for SEMA3F signaling (12.Takahashi T. Strittmatter S.M. Neuron. 2001; 29: 429-439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The addition of SEMA3F induced the interaction of NRP2 and plexin A1 within 5 min (Fig. 1C). The SEMA3F induction of cytoskeleton collapse was NRP2-dependent, as shown by loss of collapsing activity in the presence of siRNA (not shown) or in the presence of anti-NRP2 antibody (Fig. 1D).SEMA3F Inhibits U87MG Cell Contractility and Migration—To explore the consequence of SEMA3F-induced F-actin cytoskeleton collapse on U87MG cell behavior, the effects on cell motility and contractility were measured (Fig. 2, A and B). SEMA3F suppressed U87MG migration in a Transwell® assay by up to 75% in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). Cells need to exert traction forces on their extracellular matrix adhesions in order to migrate (30.Chen W.T. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 90: 187-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 31.Butler J.P. Tolic-Norrelykke I.M. Fabry B. Fredberg J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C595-C605Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Accordingly, U87MG cell contractility in control and SEMA3F-treated cells using traction force microscopy was measured (Fig. 2B). SEMA3F significantly decreased cell traction force (total strain energy) in U87MG cells within 5 min after treatment relative to controls. The rapid kinetics of contractility loss was consistent with that of rapid cytoskeleton collapse shown in Fig. 1.FIGURE 2SEMA3F inhibits U87MG cell migration and contractility.A, Transwell® cell migration assay. SEMA3F inhibits U87MG cell migration in a dose-dependent manner. The experiment was repeated three times. B, traction force analysis. The effects of SEMA3F on U87MG glioma cell contractility were quantified. The data points represent averages of total strain energy (pJ) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The experiment was repeated three times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)SEMA3F Inactivates RhoA and Activates Cofilin—The small GTPase RhoA stimulates cell contractility, actin polymerization, and stress fiber formation that are required for cell movement (32.Burridge K.

Trans. 2005; 33: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). SEMA3F effects on RhoA activity were analyzed using a rhotekin pull-down assay, which measures levels of active RhoA. SEMA3F decreased GTP-RhoA levels by 90% within 5 min after the addition (Fig. 3A), consistent with the rapid cytoskeleton collapse and loss of contractility. Constitutively active RhoA administered by lentivirus rescued the cytoskeletal collapse by SEMA3F (Fig. 3B, d), whereas the Rho kinase inhibitor, Y27632, mimicked SEMA3F-induced collapse (Fig. 3B, f). SEMA3F also inactivated Rac1 activity (Fig. S1), consistent with retraction of lamellipodia observed in the video (Movies S1 and S2). On the other hand, Cdc42 activity was not changed (Fig. S1).FIGURE 3SEMA3F inhibits U87MG cell RhoA activity and induces cofilin-depolymerizing activity.A, down-regulation of Rho activity in response to SEMA3F. U87MG cells were treated with SEMA3F (640 ng/ml) for 0-30 min. RhoA activity was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Expression levels of total RhoA in lysates are shown at the bottom. The experiment was repeated three times. B, constitutive RhoA and Rho kinase inhibitor. U87MG cells were treated without (a) or with 640 ng/ml SEMA3F (c). Constitutively active RhoA was infected into U87MG cells using lentivirus, and cells were treated without (b) or with 640 ng/ml SEMA3F (d). SEMA3F was added 2 days after infection. Within 30 min, severe cytoskeleton collapse was observed by confocal microscopy. Constitutively active RhoA diminished the collapsing effect of SEMA3F (d) compared with the collapse seen in wild type (WT) cells (c). In the absence of SEMA3F, a ROCK inhibitor, Y27632, at 10 μm for 30 min collapsed the cytoskeleton, mimicking the effect of SEMA3F (f). C, SEMA3F induces dephosphorylation of cofilin. U87MG cells (top) and HUVEC (bottom) were incubated with 640 ng/ml SEMA3F at the indicated times, 0-180 min. Phosphocofilin was dephosphorylated in both U87MG and EC within 15 min in the presence of SEMA3F. D, overexpression of dominant negative cofilin. A mutagenic change of wild type Ser3 to Glu3 functioned as a dominant negative of endogenous cofilin and abrogated SEMA3F-induced inhibition of U87MG cell migration (*, p < 0.05; Student's t test).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Active RhoA promotes formation of actin bundles by activating multiple downstream effectors. In addition to stimulating tension generation through Rho kinase, RhoA also activated LIM kinase (34.Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Boku S. Watanabe N. Fujita A. Iwamatsu A. Obinata T. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Narumiya S. Science. 1999; 285: 895-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar), which in turn phosphorylated cofilin, also known as actin depolymerizing factor. Phosphorylated cofilin was inactive, whereas dephosphorylated cofilin was active. Active cofilin monomerizes F-actin and severed F-actin chains, leading to cytoskeleton collapse (35.Bamburg J.R.

https://openalex.org/W2047594758,"Position and momentum were the first pair of conjugate observables explicitly used to illustrate the intricacy of quantum mechanics. We have extended position and momentum entanglement to bright optical beams. Applications in optical metrology and interferometry require the continuous measurement of laser beams, with the accuracy fundamentally limited by the uncertainty principle. Techniques based on spatial entanglement of the beams could overcome this limit, and high-quality entanglement is required. We report a value of 0.51 for inseparability and 0.62 for the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen criterion, both normalized to a classical limit of 1. These results are a conclusive optical demonstration of macroscopic position and momentum quantum entanglement and also confirm that the resources for spatial multimode protocols are available."
https://openalex.org/W2000730671,"Human pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) is down-regulated by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) isoforms 1-4. PDK4 is overexpressed in skeletal muscle in type 2 diabetes, resulting in impaired glucose utilization. Here we show that human PDK4 has robust core-free basal activity, which is considerably higher than activity levels of other PDK isoforms stimulated by the PDC core. PDK4 binds the L3 lipoyl domain, but its activity is not significantly stimulated by any individual lipoyl domains or the core of PDC. The 2.0-A crystal structures of the PDK4 dimer with bound ADP reveal an open conformation with a wider active-site cleft, compared with that in the closed conformation epitomized by the PDK2-ADP structure. The open conformation in PDK4 shows partially ordered C-terminal cross-tails, in which the conserved DW (Asp(394)-Trp(395)) motif from one subunit anchors to the N-terminal domain of the other subunit. The open conformation fosters a reduced binding affinity for ADP, facilitating the efficient removal of product inhibition by this nucleotide. Alteration or deletion of the DW-motif disrupts the C-terminal cross-tail anchor, resulting in the closed conformation and the nearly complete inactivation of PDK4. Fluorescence quenching and enzyme activity data suggest that compounds AZD7545 and dichloroacetate lock PDK4 in the open and the closed conformational states, respectively. We propose that PDK4 with bound ADP exists in equilibrium between the open and the closed conformations. The favored metastable open conformation is responsible for the robust basal activity of PDK4 in the absence of the PDC core."

https://openalex.org/W2029716532,"The electrogenic sodium bicarbonate cotransporter NBCe1-A mediates the basolateral absorption of sodium and bicarbonate in the proximal tubule. In this study the oligomeric state and minimal functional unit of NBCe1-A were investigated. Wild-type (wt) NBCe1-A isolated from mouse kidney or heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells was predominantly in a dimeric state as was shown using fluorescence energy transfer, pulldown, immunoprecipitation, cross-linking experiments, and nondenaturing perfluorooctanoate-PAGE. NBCe1-A monomers were found to be covalently linked by S-S bonds. When each of the 15 native cysteine residues were individually removed on a wt-NBCe1-A backbone, dimerization of the cotransporter was not affected. In experiments involving multiple native cysteine residue removal, both Cys(630) and Cys(642) in extracellular loop 3 were shown to mediate S-S bond formation between NBCe1-A monomers. When native NBCe1-A cysteine residues were individually reintroduced into a cysteineless NBCe1-A mutant backbone, the finding that a Cys(992) construct that lacked S-S bonds functioned normally indicated that stable covalent linkage of NBCe1-A monomers was not a necessary requirement for functional activity of the cotransporter. Studies using concatameric constructs of wt-NBCe1-A, whose activity is resistant to methanesulfonate reagents, and an NBCe1-A(T442C) mutant, whose activity is completely inhibited by methanesulfonate reagents, confirmed that NBCe1-A monomers are functional. Our results demonstrate that wt-NBCe1-A is predominantly a homodimer, dependent on S-S bond formation that is composed of functionally active monomers."
https://openalex.org/W2048589630,"The Ras-like small GTPase Rheb is an upstream activator of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). It has recently been shown that Rheb activates mTOR by binding to its endogenous inhibitor FKBP38 and preventing it from association with mTOR.

How Rheb activates mTOR has been a key focus of current studies in mTOR signaling. mTOR elicits its rapamycin-sensitive function in the context of a multiple protein complex termed the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). Upon activation, mTORC1 promotes protein synthesis by phosphorylating S6 kinase (S6K) at position Thr389 and 4E-BP1 at positions Thr37/Thr46, two factors involved in translation initiation (11Martin D.E. Hall M.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). It has been recently shown that Rheb activates mTORC1 by antagonizing its endogenous inhibitor, FKBP38 (12Bai X. Ma D. Liu A. Shen X. Wang Q.J. Liu Y. Jiang Y. Science. 2007; 318: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 13Proud C.G. Science. 2007; 318: 926-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Under growth factor deprivation or amino acid starvation condition, FKBP38 binds directly to mTOR and down-regulates mTORC1 activity. When amino acids and growth factors are present, Rheb interacts with FKBP38 and releases mTORC1 for activation. The interaction of Rheb with FKBP38 is guanine nucleotide-dependent. It binds strongly to FKBP38 in GTP-bound form and weakly in GDP bound form. This GTP-dependent binding suggests that FKBP38 is an effector of Rheb in the mTOR pathway, which represents the first known effector of Rheb that is regulated by guanine nucleotide (12Bai X. Ma D. Liu A. Shen X. Wang Q.J. Liu Y. Jiang Y. Science. 2007; 318: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). FKBP38, also known as FKBP8, belongs to the peptidyl prolyl cis/trans-isomerase family of FK506-binding protein (FKBP) (14Harrar Y. Bellini C. Faure J.D. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 426-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It contains a domain, referred to as FKBP-C, that is highly similar to FKBP12, the receptor for the immunosuppressive drug rapamycin (15Fischer G. Tradler T. Zarnt T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It has been shown previously that the FKBP-C domain in FKBP38 is sufficient for its interaction with mTOR. Although the binding of FKBP12 to mTOR requires rapamycin, the binding of the FKBP-C domain of FKBP38 with mTOR is independent of the drug (12Bai X. Ma D. Liu A. Shen X. Wang Q.J. Liu Y. Jiang Y. Science. 2007; 318: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In addition to the FKBP-C domain, FKBP38 also contains several other distinct domains, including a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, a Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM) binding domain, and a transmembrane domain (TM) (16Maestre-Martinez M. Edlich F. Jarczowski F. Weiwad M. Fischer G. Lucke C. J. Biomol. NMR. 2006; 34: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 17Nielsen J.V. Mitchelmore C. Pedersen K.M. Kjaerulff K.M. Finsen B.

Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 1889-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The TM domain of FKBP38 is unique among all of the members of the FKBP protein family and is essential for targeting this protein to mitochondria, where it functions (20Shirane M. Nakayama K.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The identification of FKBP38 as a target of Rheb allows us to examine how Rheb, a unique member of the Ras superfamily, relays its signaling activity downstream. It is well established that Ras, in GTP-bound form, interacts with its effectors through a section located in the switch I region of the protein. This section, commonly referred to as the effector domain, is critical for the signaling activity of Ras (21Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 22Wittinghofer A. Nassar N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 488-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Since the switch I region in Rheb is highly similar to that in Ras, it is possible that Rheb signals to its effector in the mTOR pathway through a mechanism similar to that of Ras. In this study, we investigated the role of the switch I region in Rheb for its interaction with FKBP38 and its ability to activate mTORC1. Reagents and Plasmids—Antibodies against Rheb, S6K, phospho-S6K (Thr389), 4E-BP1, and phospho-4E-BP1 (Thr37/Thr46) were purchased from Cell Signaling Inc. Anti-HA (12CA5) and c-Myc (9E10) antibodies were purchased from Roche Applied Science, and anti-FLAG M2 antibody was from Sigma. The pCMV-Myc-FKBP38 vector was constructed by PCR amplifying FKBP38 from pcDNA3–2×HA-FKBP38 (14Harrar Y. Bellini C. Faure J.D. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 426-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and cloning into pCMV-tag3 vector. The sources for pRK7-HA-S6K1 and Rheb constructs were described before (12Bai X. Ma D. Liu A. Shen X. Wang Q.J. Liu Y. Jiang Y. Science. 2007; 318: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The FKBP52 gene was amplified by PCR from the FKBP52 cDNA clone (ID 3542330) obtained from OpenBiosystems and cloned into pcDNA3.1-Myc vector to create pcDNA3.1-Myc-FKBP52. pcDNA3.1-Myc-FKBP52TM was created by inserting the sequence for the transmembrane domain of FKBP38 at the 3′-end of FKBP52. Generation of Rheb and FKBP38 Mutants—Plasmids encoding all mutant versions of Rheb were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using QuikChange kit from Stratagene. The wild type Rheb in pcDNA-FLAG-Rheb vector was used as the template (6Saucedo L.J. Gao X. Chiarelli D.A. Li L. Pan D. Edgar B.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 566-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Primers were designed to contain the desired mutations, and the mutagenesis was performed following the manufacturer's instruction. Deletion mutants of FKBP38 were generated by PCR from wild type FKBP38 construct with suitable primers and cloned into pcDNA3.1-Myc vector to create Myc-tagged truncated FKBP38 expression vectors. All mutations were verified by sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum from PAA Laboratories (Ontario, Canada). For amino acid starvation and repletion, HEK293 cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium free of amino acids for 1 h, amino acid stock mixture (50× the standard concentration) from Sigma was added to the culture to a final concentration of 1×. Cells were harvested and lysed after a 30-min incubation. For serum deprivation and restimulation, cells were shifted to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2% of fetal bovine serum for 16 h. Fetal bovine serum was then added back to the medium to a final concentration of 20%. Cells were harvested and lysed upon incubation for another 30 min. DNA transfection was performed using Lipofectamine™ 2000 following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Coimmunoprecipitation—HEK293 cells were co-transfected with vectors expressing FKBP38 and Rheb. After incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 30 h, transfected cells were washed with cold PBS on ice and lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Lysates (0.5 mg) were incubated with anti-Myc antibody (9E10)-linked Protein A-agarose beads for 3 h at 4 °C with agitation. Beads were washed four times with lysis buffer and once with 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4. Washed beads were resuspended in 60 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. Immunofluorescence—HeLa cells grown on glass coverslips were stained with 200 nm Mitotracker Red (Molecular Probes) for 20 min and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. Fixed cells were permeabilized by incubating with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min. Cells were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-Rheb antibody (1:100 dilution), followed by staining with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) (1:1000). Cells were washed and mounted with ProLong® Gold antifade reagent (Molecular Probes) and visualized by confocal microscopy. All of the experiments in this study were repeated independently no fewer than three times. Representative data are shown in the figures. We have previously shown that Rheb physically interacts with FKBP38, which suggests a co-localization of both proteins. Since FKBP38 is found mainly on mitochondria (20Shirane M. Nakayama K.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), it is likely that Rheb resides on the same organelle. To test this notion, we examined intracellular localization of the endogenous Rheb using immunofluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig. 1A, Rheb appeared to localize to some punctate structures, which were mostly overlapped with mitochondria that was marked by mitotracker. This observation indicates that Rheb is mainly localized to mitochondria. To further confirm the mitochondrial association of Rheb, we isolated the mitochondrion-enriched fraction from HEK293 cells by differential fractionation and analyzed the amount of Rheb associated with the fraction. As shown in Fig. 1B, we found that the majority of Rheb existed in the mitochondrial fraction that was marked by the presence of cytochrome c. Consistent with previous findings (20Shirane M. Nakayama K.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), FKBP38 was mostly found in the mitochondrion-enriched fraction. A small portion of Rheb and FKBP38 existed in the vesicular membrane fraction that was enriched in the endoplasmic reticulum and endosomal membranes. In addition, mTOR was also found to concentrate in the mitochondrial fraction, which is in accordance with previous observations that mTOR associates with mitochondria (23Desai B.N. Myers B.R. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4319-4324Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 24Schieke S.M. Phillips D. McCoy Jr., J.P. Aponte A.M. Shen R.F. Balaban R.S. Finkel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27643-27652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Altogether, these findings indicate that Rheb, FKBP38, and mTOR coexist on mitochondria. As an attempt to understand how Rheb affects the binding of FKBP38 with mTOR, we determined the regions in FKBP38 that mediate its interaction with Rheb. Since FKBP38 contains several distinct domains (Fig. 2A), we constructed GST-fused mutant proteins lacking each of the domains and expressed them in bacterial cells. To ensure their solubility, none of the mutant proteins contained the transmembrane domain. The interaction of the expressed mutant proteins with Rheb was examined using an in vitro binding assay. As shown in Fig. 2B, we found that a mutant FKBP38 protein lacking the FKBP-C domain was unable to interact with Rheb (lane 4), whereas those deleted for the CaM domain (lane 3), the tetratricopeptide repeat domain (lane 5), or the first 108 amino acids (lane 7) were. Furthermore, deletion mutants containing the first 207 amino acids (lane 6) or the FKBP-C domain alone (lane 8) were able to interact with Rheb. These findings suggest that Rheb interacts with FKBP38 by binding to its FKBP-C domain, the region that is highly similar to FKBP12. Similar results were obtained by co-immunoprecipitation using FKBP38 mutants expressed in cultured mammalian cells (Fig. S1). We next investigated the role for each of the unique domains in the function of FKBP38 as an mTORC1 inhibitor. Accordingly, we examined the serum-stimulated phosphorylation of S6K at Thr389, an mTORC1-dependent phosphorylation site, in cells that expressed the deletion mutants of FKBP38. In accordance with the previous finding (12Bai X. Ma D. Liu A. Shen X. Wang Q.J. Liu Y. Jiang Y. Science. 2007; 318: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), overexpression of wild type FKBP38 inhibited the serum-stimulated phosphorylation on S6K (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 1 and 2). In comparison, a mutant FKBP38 protein lacking the FKBP-C domain was largely ineffective in inhibition of the phosphorylation (lane 5), consistent with the fact that this domain is required for interaction with mTOR (6Saucedo L.J. Gao X. Chiarelli D.A. Li L. Pan D. Edgar B.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 566-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Mutants without the transmembrane domain, including the regions of amino acids 1–387 (ΔTM; lane 3), amino acids 1–207 (lane 7), and amino acids 108–207 (FKBP-C; lane 9), also lost the inhibitory ability. Because these mutants were unable to associate with mitochondria (Fig. S3), this finding suggests that the mitochondrial localization is essential for the inhibitory activity of FKBP38. In addition, the region containing the N-terminal 108 amino acids appeared to be important for FKBP38 function, since a mutant protein lacking the region was incapable of inhibiting S6K phosphorylation (lane 8), despite being able to associate with mitochondria (Fig. S3). In contrast, mutants lacking the TPR domain retained some of the inhibitory activity (lane 6), suggesting that this domain is not essential for the inhibitory activity of FKBP38. Although a mutant deleted for the CaM domain exhibited a certain degree of inhibition, the activity is not statistically significant in comparison with that of the mutant lacking the transmembrane domain (lanes 3 and 4). Similar effects were observed for these mutant FKBP38 proteins in the amino acid-stimulated S6K phosphorylation at Thr389 (Fig. S2). These findings indicate three regions in FKBP38 are critical for its inhibitory activity toward mTORC1. These regions are the N-terminal 108 amino acids, the FKBP-C domain, and the transmembrane domain. In the family of FK506-binding proteins, another member, FKBP52, shares similar structural features with FKBP38, including the FKBP-C domain, the TPR domain, and the CaM binding site (25Davies T.H. Sanchez E.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 37: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We thus tested whether FKBP52 possessed a similar inhibitory activity toward mTORC1. As shown in Fig. 4, although overexpression of FKBP38 prevented amino acid- or serum-stimulated phosphorylation of S6K at Thr389, that of FKBP52 failed to do so. The lack of inhibitory effect on mTORC1 does not appear to be caused by its inability to attach to membrane, since a hybrid version of the protein containing the transmembrane domain from FKBP38 remained incapable of mTORC1 inhibition. These data indicate that the FKBP38 is a unique member in the family of the FK506-binding proteins that possesses the ability to inhibit mTORC1 in the absence of rapamycin. The finding that Rheb interacts with FKBP38 and regulates its activity in a GTP-dependent manner suggests that FKBP38 is an effector of Rheb. As a small GTPase that is closely related to Ras, Rheb is expected to employ a similar mechanism to interact and activate its effectors. We thus determined whether the switch I region in Rheb is required for its interaction with FKBP38 and whether the ability to interact with FKBP38 is essential for Rheb signaling to mTORC1. Previous studies have identified a few mutations within the switch I region of Rheb that impair its ability to activate mTORC1 but not that for nucleotide binding, including T38M, I39K, and N41A (26Long X. Lin Y. Ortiz-Vega S. Yonezawa K. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 702-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar, 27Tee A.R. Blenis J. Proud C.G. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4763-4768Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We first examined whether these mutations affect the binding of Rheb with FKBP38. Accordingly, we expressed Myc-tagged FKBP38 together with different FLAG-tagged Rheb mutants in HEK293 cells and examined their interaction by co-immunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig. 5A, we found that the interaction of Rheb with FKBP38 was partially disrupted by T38M and N41A mutations (lanes 4 and 6) and largely abolished by the I39K mutation (lane 5). A T38M/I39K combined mutation or alanine substitution of residues from position 38 to 43 (38–43A) completely abolished the binding (lanes 9 and 10). We next determined the ability of these Rheb mutants to antagonize the inhibitory effect of FKBP38 on mTORC1 signaling activity. Consistent with our previous findings, we found that overexpression of FKBP38 blocked amino acid-stimulated phosphorylation of S6K at Thr389 and of 4E-BP1 at Thr37/Thr46. However, a simultaneous expression of wild type Rheb abolished the inhibitory effect of FKBP38 (Fig. 5B, compare lanes 1 and 2). Although T38M and N41A mutants retained some residual activity for stimulating the S6K phosphorylation in the presence of FKBP38 (lanes 4 and 6), the T38M/I39K and 38–43A mutants were devoid of any activity (lanes 9 and 10). Thus, the ability of Rheb to bind with FKBP38 correlates with its ability to stimulate mTORC1 signaling. One exception was D60K, a dominant negative allele, which bound strongly to FKBP38 yet failed to stimulate the S6K phosphorylation (Fig. 5, A and B, lane 7). Despite this, a triple mutation, containing T38M, I39K, and D60K substitutions, was unable to interact with FKBP38, suggesting that the binding of D60K with FKBP38 still requires the switch I region (Fig. 5A, lane 11). D60K was originally identified as a dominant negative allele, whose overproduction in cells blocks mTORC1-dependent S6K phosphorylation and renders it largely unresponsive to amino acids or growth factor stimulation (28Tabancay Jr., A.P. Gau C.L. Machado I.M. Uhlmann E.J. Gutmann D.H. Guo L. Tamanoi F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39921-39930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that D60K binds to and sequesters FKBP38 on mTOR in such a way that the binding between FKBP38 and mTOR is no longer sensitive to amino acids availability or growth factor stimulation (12Bai X. Ma D. Liu A. Shen X. Wang Q.J. Liu Y. Jiang Y. Science. 2007; 318: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). This observation raised a possibility that the dominance of D60K over the endogenous Rheb originated from its binding and sequestering FKBP38. To test this notion, we examined whether nullifying the ability of D60K to bind with FKBP38 eliminates its dominance. As shown in Fig. 6, we found that whereas the S6K phosphorylation at Thr389 was insensitive to amino acid availability in cells overexpressing D60K (lanes 3 and 4), it became responsive in cells overexpressing the triple T38M/I39K/D60K mutant (lanes 7 and 8), which was incapable of FKBP38 binding (Fig. 5A, lane 11). This finding suggests that the dominance of D60K is caused by sequestering its effector, FKBP38. The region in Rheb that corresponds to the effector domain of Ras contains 9 residues, including amino acids 35–43. We examined the role for each of these residues in mediating its interaction with FKBP38 by substituting them individually with alanine. As shown in Fig. 7, we found that the substitutions at position 35, 40, or 43 partially impair the ability of the mutant Rheb to interact with FKBP38; that at position 38 modestly affected the interaction, whereas those at position 36, 39, or 42 largely abolished the interaction. We next determined the ability of the alanine substitution mutants to activate mTORC1 signaling in the absence of amino acids. We found that the mutants with largely impaired FKBP38 binding ability, including those with alanine substitution at positions 36, 38, 39, and 42, were ineffective in stimulating the mTORC1-dependent phosphorylation of S6K and 4E-BP1 (Fig. 7B). This finding suggests that the interaction with FKBP38 is important for Rheb to activate mTORC1. To further confirm the notion, we examined the ability of these mutants in antagonizing FKBP38 activity. We found that these mutants were incapable of reversing the inhibitory effect of FKBP38 on mTORC1 (Fig. 7C). Thus, the ability of Rheb to interact with FKBP38 correlates with its activity for mTORC1 stimulation. Previous studies have shown that Rheb is localized in cells on some punctate particles that resemble endosomal compartments. These observations have led to the suggestion that Rheb associates with endosomal compartments (29Buerger C. DeVries B. Stambolic V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 344: 869-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 30Takahashi K. Nakagawa M. Young S.G. Yamanaka S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32768-32774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, our analysis of Rheb localization revealed that the majority of Rheb is co-localized with mitotracker (Fig. 1), suggesting that the protein is associated with mitochondria. Because the endosomal compartments and mitochondria are morphologically indistinguishable under a light microscope, it is possible that some of the Rheb-containing punctate particles observed earlier were actually mitochondria. The mitochondrial association of Rheb is also consistent with the fact that Rheb directly interacts with FKBP38, which has been shown previously to be a mitochondrial protein (20Shirane M. Nakayama K.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 31Portier B.P. Taglialatela G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 40493-40502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The target of FKBP38, mTOR, has been shown to localize to various compartments, including endosomal membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, nucleus, and mitochondria (23Desai B.N. Myers B.R. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4319-4324Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 24Schieke S.M. Phillips D. McCoy Jr., J.P. Aponte A.M. Shen R.F. Balaban R.S. Finkel T.

Chem. 2004; 279: 772-778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 35Kim J.E. Chen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14340-14345Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Our fractionation analysis indicates that at least a portion of mTOR is localized to mitochondria, where Rheb and FKBP38 reside. This result is supported by previous findings showing that mTOR associated with outer membrane of mitochondria (23Desai B.N. Myers B.R. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4319-4324Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Given that mitochondria are the major metabolic organelle, co-localization of mTOR, Rheb, and FKBP38 on mitochondria is consistent with the role of mTORC1 in nutrient, energy, and oxygen sensing. The FKBP-C domain of FKBP38 shares 53% sequence similarity with FKBP12 (16Maestre-Martinez M. Edlich F. Jarczowski F. Weiwad M. Fischer G. Lucke C. J. Biomol. NMR. 2006; 34: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the FKBP-C domain in FKBP38 but not FKBP12 is able to interact with mTOR in the absence of rapamycin (12Bai X. Ma D. Liu A. Shen X. Wang Q.J. Liu Y. Jiang Y. Science. 2007; 318: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Consistent with this result, we show in this study that the FKBP-C domain of FKBP38 is essential for its inhibitory activity toward mTORC1 signaling activity. However, the FKBP-C domain alone does not appear to be sufficient for mTORC1 inhibition. Deletion mutants of FKBP38 lacking the transmembrane domain or the N-terminal 108 amino acids are largely defective in mTORC1 inhibition, suggesting that these domains are also important for FKBP38 function. Since the transmembrane domain is needed for targeting FKBP38 to mitochondria (20Shirane M. Nakayama K.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), the requirement of this domain for FKBP38 function indicates that mitochondrial association is important for FKBP38 function. On the other hand, the region containing the N-terminal 108 amino acids of FKBP38 is not required for its association with mitochondria (Fig. S3) or for its interaction with Rheb (Fig. 2) and mTOR (12Bai X. Ma D. Liu A. Shen X. Wang Q.J. Liu Y. Jiang Y. Science. 2007; 318: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Its role in FKBP38 function requires further study. Interestingly, the FKBP-C domain of FKBP38 also mediates its binding with Rheb (Fig. 2), raising the possibility that Rheb may compete with mTOR for FKBP38 binding. However, the fact that the D60K mutant of Rheb is able to bind with FKBP38 without displacing mTOR from it suggests that the bindings of FKBP38 with Rheb and mTOR are not mutually exclusive (12Bai X. Ma D. Liu A. Shen X. Wang Q.J. Liu Y. Jiang Y. Science. 2007; 318: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). It is likely that Rheb and mTOR bind to different sides of the FKBP-C domain in such a way that Rheb is able to modulate FKBP38 allosterically and consequently affects its association with mTOR. Further analysis of the three-dimensional structure of the Rheb-FKBP38 and FKBP38-mTOR complexes will shed light on the structural bases for the interactions. Upon GTP binding, small GTPases of Ras family interact with their effectors through the effector domain within the switch I region of the proteins. As such, the effector domain of a small GTPase plays a critical role in relaying its activity to downstream effectors (36Bos J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: M19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Previous studies have identified a few mutations within the switch I region, including T38M, I39K, and N41A, that affect the ability of Rheb to stimulate mTORC1 activity (26Long X. Lin Y. Ortiz-Vega S. Yonezawa K. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 702-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). In the present study, we find that these mutations in Rheb disrupt its interaction with FKBP38. These observations demonstrate a correlation between the ability to interact with FKBP38 and the ability to stimulate mTORC1 activity, which is consistent with the notion that Rheb activates mTORC1 by removing FKBP38 from mTOR (12Bai X. Ma D. Liu A. Shen X. Wang Q.J. Liu Y. Jiang Y. Science. 2007; 318: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Our mutational analysis also identifies two other residues in the effector domain that are important for the interaction of Rheb with FKBP38, including Asp36 and Thr42. Alanine substitutions at these positions drastically reduce the ability of Rheb to interact with FKBP38 and to stimulate mTORC1. These results suggest that the interaction with FKBP38 is critical for Rheb to activate mTORC1, thus supporting a view that FKBP38 is a key factor that links Rheb activity to mTORC1. Importantly, the finding that Rheb interacts with FKBP38 through its effector domain in a GTP-dependent manner suggests that the signaling mechanism of Rheb is similar to that of other members of the Ras superfamily.

https://openalex.org/W2102419220,"In order to better understand the molecular and cellular determinants of tumor cell intravasation, our laboratory has generated a pair of congenic human HT-1080 fibrosarcoma variants (i.e. HT-hi/diss and HT-lo/diss) differing 50-100-fold in their ability to intravasate and disseminate. To investigate the molecular differences underlying the distinct dissemination capacities of these HT-1080 variants, we performed a comparative analysis of the cell surface proteomes of HT-hi/diss and HT-lo/diss. Cell membrane proteins were enriched by biotinylation and avidin precipitation and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry employing multidimensional protein identification technology. By this approach, 47 cell surface-associated molecules were identified as differentially expressed between the HT-1080 intravasation variants. From these candidates, four targets (i.e. TIMP-2, NCAM-1, JAM-C, and tissue factor (TF)) were selected for further biochemical validation and in vivo functional verification. Western blot analysis of the cell surface enriched fractions confirmed the proteomic array data, demonstrating that, in vitro, TIMP-2 protein was increased in the HT-lo/diss variant, whereas NCAM-1, JAM-C, and TF levels were increased in the HT-hi/diss variant. Corresponding in vivo differences in levels of TIMP-2, JAM-C, and TF were demonstrated in primary tumors grown in the chick embryo. Finally, functional inhibition of one selected protein (i.e. TF) by small interfering RNA silencing or ligation with a function-blocking antibody significantly reduced HT-hi/diss intravasation, thus clearly implicating TF in the early steps of tumor cell dissemination. Overall, our cell surface proteomic analysis provides a powerful tool for identification of specific cell membrane molecules that contribute functionally to intravasation and metastasis in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1982418026,"BmrR is a member of the MerR family and a multidrug binding transcription factor that up-regulates the expression of the bmr multidrug efflux transporter gene in response to myriad lipophilic cationic compounds. The structural mechanism by which BmrR binds these chemically and structurally different drugs and subsequently activates transcription is poorly understood. Here, we describe the crystal structures of BmrR bound to rhodamine 6G (R6G) or berberine (Ber) and cognate DNA. These structures reveal each drug stacks against multiple aromatic residues with their positive charges most proximal to the carboxylate group of Glu-253 and that, unlike other multidrug binding pockets, that of BmrR is rigid. Substitution of Glu-253 with either alanine (E253A) or glutamine (E253Q) results in unpredictable binding affinities for R6G, Ber, and tetraphenylphosphonium. Moreover, these drug binding studies reveal that the negative charge of Glu-253 is not important for high affinity binding to Ber and tetraphenylphosphonium but plays a more significant, but unpredictable, role in R6G binding. In vitro transcription data show that E253A and E253Q are constitutively active, and structures of the drug-free E253A-DNA and E253Q-DNA complexes support a transcription activation mechanism requiring the expulsion of Tyr-152 from the multidrug binding pocket. In sum, these data delineate the mechanism by which BmrR binds lipophilic, monovalent cationic compounds and suggest the importance of the redundant negative electrostatic nature of this rigid drug binding pocket that can be used to discriminate against molecules that are not substrates of the Bmr multidrug efflux pump.

Multidrug-resistant bacteria have become an extreme threat to human and animal health (1Alekshun M.N. Levy S.B. Cell. 2007; 128: 1037-1050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). One mechanism of multidrug resistance is the active extrusion of chemically and structurally dissimilar drugs by multidrug efflux transporters (2Piddock L.J. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 4: 629-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar, 3Poole K. Ann. Med. 2007; 39: 162-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). These pumps are often regulated by transcription factors that respond to the same toxins and biocides that serve as substrates for the transporters (2Piddock L.J. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 4: 629-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar, 3Poole K. Ann. Med. 2007; 39: 162-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 4Grkovic S. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A.

Thus, these transcription regulators are also multidrug-binding proteins, and the delineation of their multidrug binding mechanisms provides high resolution insight into those of the efflux pumps. To date, structures of multidrug binding transcription factors in complex with multiple drugs has been limited to QacR and TtgR, both of which belong to the TetR family (6Alguel Y. Meng C. Teran W. Krell T. Ramos J.L. Gallegos M.T. Zhang X. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 369: 829-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 7Schumacher M.A. Miller M.C. Brennan R.G.

Science. 2001; 294: 2158-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The multidrug binding pocket of QacR is formed after the expulsion of two tyrosine residues from the protein core to expose a voluminous binding site that is composed of aromatic and negatively charged residues and overlapping “minipockets,” which are utilized selectively by monovalent and bivalent cationic drugs (8Schumacher M.A. Miller M.C. Grkovic S. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Brennan R.G. Science. 2001; 294: 2158-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The multidrug binding pocket of TtgR, which binds neutral and negatively charged toxins, has two overlapping sites, a general site, which is highly hydrophobic, and a second, more polar site, which includes a basic residue that is key to the high affinity binding of the plant antimicrobial phloretin (6Alguel Y. Meng C. Teran W. Krell T. Ramos J.L. Gallegos M.T. Zhang X. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 369: 829-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, a serious limitation to our understanding of multidrug binding and its resulting gene regulation is the dearth of structural and biochemical data on multidrug binding transcription regulators from other families. BmrR, the bacterial multidrug resistance regulator from Bacillus subtilis, activates transcription of the bmr multidrug transporter gene by binding to a plethora of structurally dissimilar lipophilic, monovalent cationic compounds, which are also the substrates of Bmr (9Ahmed M.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16925-16931Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). BmrR belongs to the MerR family, which activates transcription from noncanonical σ70 and σA-regulated promoters in response to a variety of stresses (11Summers A.O. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3097-3101Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 12Brown N.L. Stoyanov J.V. Kidd S.P. Hobman J.L. FEMS Microbiol.

Cell. 1989; 56: 119-129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). These promoters typically contain 19- or 20-bp spacers between the -10 and -35 promoter elements in contrast to the canonical 17-bp spacing found in most σ70 or σA responsive promoters (13O'Halloran T.V. Frantz B. Shin M.K. Ralston D.M. Wright J.G. Cell. 1989; 56: 119-129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 14Parkhill J. Brown N.L.

The 19-bp spacer places these promoter hexamers ∼72° out of phase on the DNA helical axis, thereby preventing productive open complex formation by RNA polymerase (16Hidalgo E. Leautaud V. Demple B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2629-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 17Ansari A.Z. Bradner J.E. O'Halloran T.V. Nature. 1995; 374: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 18Ansari A.Z.

Chem. 1999; 274: 37517-37524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In the absence of the appropriate signal, nearly all MerR family members bind their promoters with high affinity but do not activate. Drug binding to the BmrR-promoter complex enables productive interaction of RNA polymerase with the promoter (9Ahmed M. Borsch C.M. Taylor S.S. Vazquez-Laslop N. Neyfakh A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28506-28513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of BmrR in complex with a 22-bp oligodeoxynucleotide, encompassing most of the bmr promoter, and the “drug” tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP+) 2The abbreviations used are: TPP+tetraphenylphosphoniumBRCBmrR C-terminal drug binding domainR6Grhodamine 6GBerberberinewtBmrRBmrR or R275EITCisothermal titration calorimetryr.m.s.d.root mean square deviationwtwild type. 2The abbreviations used are: TPP+tetraphenylphosphoniumBRCBmrR C-terminal drug binding domainR6Grhodamine 6GBerberberinewtBmrRBmrR or R275EITCisothermal titration calorimetryr.m.s.d.root mean square deviationwtwild type. has been solved (20Heldwein E.E. Brennan R.G. Nature. 2001; 409: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The structure revealed an N-terminal winged helix DNA binding domain and a C-terminal drug binding domain that are linked by a long antiparallel coiled-coil. The structure also revealed kinking and under-twisting of the DNA, which shrinks the helix by ∼5 Å and reconfigures the -10 and -35 elements to resemble their positions in canonical σ70/σA responsive promoters. The universality of DNA under-twisting, shrinking, and bending as the transcription activation mechanism by MerR family members is supported by the structures of MtaN and SoxR-DNA complexes (21Newberry K.J.

Despite our knowledge of the structure of BmrR in its transcription activated conformation, the molecular mechanisms by which this protein binds drugs and activates transcription of the bmr gene remain unclear. Crystal structures of the C-terminal drug binding domain of BmrR (BRC) both with and without TPP+ provided some initial insight and implicated glutamate residue Glu-253 at the base of the multidrug binding pocket in the neutralization of cationic drugs (23Zheleznova E.E. Markham P.N. Neyfakh A.A. Brennan R.G. Cell. 1999; 96: 353-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In the absence of drug the carboxylate side chain of Glu-253 interacts with three tyrosine residues, Tyr-152, Tyr-187, and Tyr-229, which “neutralize” this buried negative charge. Tyr-152 resides at the N terminus of a small α helix that covers the drug binding pocket, which upon drug binding moves away from the pocket to accommodate drug. Mutational studies on the BRC support the functional importance of Glu-253, as its substitution with alanine or glutamine had a noticeable effect on ligand binding affinity (10Vazquez-Laslop N. Markham P.N. Neyfakh A.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16925-16931Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Charge neutralization of drugs by oppositely charged residues in the drug binding pockets of TetR family members QacR, TtgR, and AcrR has been postulated or shown to be important for drug binding and induction (6Alguel Y.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1210-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Regardless, the role of Glu-253 in drug binding and transcription activation in the context of full-length BmrR is unknown, as an additional acidic residue, Asp-47′, from the DNA binding domain of the other subunit, was absent in the studies on the BRC yet found proximal to TPP+ in the BmrR-TPP+-DNA complex (20Heldwein E.E. Brennan R.G. Nature. 2001; 409: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 23Zheleznova E.E. Markham P.N. Neyfakh A.A. Brennan R.G. Cell. 1999; 96: 353-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Given the dearth of structural knowledge of the mechanisms of multidrug binding by transcription factors outside the TetR family, structural studies on BmrR bound to either rhodamine 6G (R6G) or berberine (Ber), and site-directed mutants in which Glu-253 was replaced by either alanine (E253A) or glutamine (E253Q) were undertaken. In parallel the effects of these mutations on drug binding affinity and transcription activation were determined. These studies define the structural mechanism of multidrug binding, which parallels other multidrug binding transcription regulators yet differs significantly in key aspects. In Vivo and in Vitro Transcription Activation—The E253A and E253Q mutations were introduced into the bmrR gene of wild type B. subtilis strain BD170 by transformation with a PCR product containing each mutation. The PCR product, which was generated by hybrid PCR, included flanking sequences of 1.0 and 1.4 kilobases upstream and downstream of the mutation, respectively. To allow quick selection of the transformants, DNA from a B. subtilis strain containing the chloramphenicol resistance gene CmR inserted downstream of bmrR was used as a template such that the downstream primer incorporated this resistance marker into the PCR product. BD170 cells were transformed with the purified hybrid PCR product containing either the E253A or the E253Q mutation and selected for chloramphenicol resistance at 4 μg/ml. Transformants containing the E253A or E253Q mutation were identified by direct sequencing and compared with the transformants with wild type bmrR for their sensitivity to ethidium bromide by a broth microdilution assay in 96-well plates (9Ahmed M. Borsch C.M. Taylor S.S. Vazquez-Laslop N. Neyfakh A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28506-28513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cloning, expression, and purification of mutant BmrR-His6 proteins were performed as described previously for wild type BmrR (10Vazquez-Laslop N. Markham P.N. Neyfakh A.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16925-16931Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Purification of B. subtilis RNA polymerase and in vitro transcription assays were also performed as described previously (9Ahmed M. Borsch C.M. Taylor S.S. Vazquez-Laslop N. Neyfakh A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28506-28513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Vazquez-Laslop N. Markham P.N. Neyfakh A.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16925-16931Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 221-bp PCR fragment containing the bmr promoter was used as a template to generate a 98-nucleotide run off mRNA transcript. Transcription reactions (25-μl reaction volume) contained 0.3 pmol of bmr template DNA, 0.3 pmol of rpsD promoter DNA, and 1.2 pmol of wild type, E253A, or E253Q BmrR-His6 protein. 50 pmol of R6G, 100 pmol of Ber, or 1 nmol of TPP+ was added during the preincubation reaction where indicated. The run off transcripts labeled with [α-32P]UTP were separated by electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea and visualized by phosphorimaging (GE Healthcare), and bands were quantitated using the ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). Drug Binding Assays Using Fluorescence Polarization—Fluorescence polarization-based BmrR-drug binding experiments were done with a PanVera Beacon fluorescence polarization system (Invitrogen) utilizing the intrinsic fluorescence of R6G and the increase in polarization that is observed upon the binding of this small compound (molecular weight = 479 Da) to the ∼65-kDa protein dimer. Binding was assayed in a 1-ml volume at 25 °C. Each binding experiment contained 1 nm R6G in binding buffer (25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol). In one set of control experiments, DNA corresponding to the bmr promoter in the absence of any protein was titrated with R6G. After each addition of protein-DNA complex or protein alone, the samples were incubated for 30 s before a measurement was taken. The millipolarization (P·10-3, where P is polarization) at each titration point represents the average of eight measurements integrated over 6 s. Samples were excited at 490 nm, and emission was measured at 560 nm. Each binding isotherm was analyzed by curve fitting with Kaleidograph using the equation P = {(Pbound - Pfree) [protein-R6G]/(Kd + [protein-R6G])} + Pfree, where P is the polarization measured at a given concentration of protein, Pfree is the initial polarization of the free R6G, and Pbound is the maximum polarization of specifically bound R6G (26Schumacher M.A. Miller M.C. Grkovic S. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Brennan R.G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1210-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Nonlinear least squares analysis was used to determine Pbound and Kd. Drug Binding Assays Using Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements were made using a VP-Microcalorimeter (MicroCal, Northampton, MA) at 35 °C. After our standard purification procedure (20Heldwein E.E. Brennan R.G. Nature. 2001; 409: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), the protein was further purified by gel filtration to remove aggregates and contaminating DNA. The protein was eluted in 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol. Stock solutions of berberine and R6G were prepared as saturated solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) then diluted with the gel filtration buffer to a final concentration of between 0.5 and 1 mm, which corresponded to a final concentration of DMSO of 1-2%. An equivalent amount of DMSO was added to the protein sample. TPP+ was prepared at a concentration of 5 mm in the gel filtration buffer. Heats of dilution were measured by injecting ligands into the buffer and were subtracted from the raw data. All binding isotherms were fit to a one-site model using the ORIGIN software provided by MicroCal. Crystallization, Structure Determination, and Refinement of the E253A-DNA and E253Q-DNA Complexes—The mutant BmrR proteins were purified and resolubilized with DNA as described previously (20Heldwein E.E. Brennan R.G. Nature. 2001; 409: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). As with wild type BmrR, the same 22-base pair duplex oligodeoxynucleotide containing the bmr promoter sequence 5′-AGACTCTCCCCTAGGAGGAGGTC-3′ and a 5′ overhanging adenosine was used for crystallization with the exception that the mutant proteins were crystallized under different conditions. The E253A-DNA and E253Q-DNA crystals were grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method with a reservoir solution containing 0.85 m trisodium citrate and 0.1 m imidazole, pH 8.0. Four μl of the protein-DNA complex (8 mg/ml) was mixed with 5 μl of the reservoir solution and 1 μl of 40% trifluoroethanol. Long tetragonal rods grew in 1-2 days to maximum dimensions of 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.5 mm. Crystals were cryoprotected in a solution containing 1 m trisodium citrate, 0.1 m imidazole, pH 8.0, and 30% glycerol and flash-frozen in a cryocooled nitrogen stream at 100 K. X-ray intensity data were collected at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory beamline 9-1 for both the E253Q-DNA and E253A-DNA complexes. Both mutant crystals were isomorphous to the wild type BmrR-DNA structure and took the tetragonal space group P4322. The intensity data were processed with MOSFLM (27Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 + ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1992; Google Scholar) and scaled with SCALA as implemented in the CCP4 software suite (28Collaborative Computational Project Number 4. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19733) Google Scholar). The wild type BmrR-DNA complex (PDB code 1R8E) was used as a starting model for refinement using CNS (29Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S.

Markham P.N. Neyfakh A.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16925-16931Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) using primers incorporating the mutation via the QuikChange method (Invitrogen). The R275E BmrR protein was expressed and purified as previously described for wild type BmrR (20Heldwein E.E. Brennan R.G. Nature. 2001; 409: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The R275E protein was mixed with equimolar amounts of a 23-base pair duplex oligodeoxynucleotide containing the bmr promoter sequence (5′-ATGACTCTCCCCTAGGAGGAGGTC-3′) dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA. The R275E-DNA crystals were grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Four μl of protein-DNA complex was mixed with 4 μl of reservoir buffer containing 1.0-1.3 m sodium malonate, pH 7.0, 0.05% Jeffamine M600. Crystals grew within 1-2 days to maximum dimensions of 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.2 mm. To obtain the BmrR-R6G-DNA complex structures, BmrR-DNA crystals were soaked for 18 h in 1.3 m sodium malonate, pH 7.0, with a saturating amount of drug (∼2 mm). Crystals were cryoprotected in 1.3 m sodium malonate, pH 7.0, 30% glycerol, and flash-frozen in a liquid nitrogen stream at 100 K. X-ray intensity data were collected at the Advanced Light Source, beamline 8.2.1, Berkeley, CA. The R275E-R6G-DNA and R275E-Ber-DNA crystals were isomorphous to wtBmrR-DNA crystals (20Heldwein E.E.

Selective Importance of Glu-253 in Drug Binding by BmrR—Previous studies on the BRC indicated that the buried residue Glu-253 was important for binding drugs; mutation of Glu-253 to alanine decreased the binding affinity by more than 10-fold for all but one of the six drugs tested (10Vazquez-Laslop N.

Cell. 1999; 96: 353-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Subsequent structural studies revealed that the BRC does not recapitulate the complete drug binding pocket of the full-length BmrR dimer (supplemental Fig. S1) (20Heldwein E.E. Brennan R.G. Nature. 2001; 409: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined the drug binding affinities of BmrR and the E253A and E253Q mutants. To do so, the intrinsic insolubility of BmrR, which precluded ITC experiments, was alleviated by creating the BmrR R275E mutant. This protein retains wild type drug binding affinity and in vitro transcription activation (Fig. 1A and supplemental S2). Therefore, all Glu-253 mutations also contained the R275E change, and we will refer to the R275E protein as wtBmrR. Thermodynamic parameters and binding affinities were determined for R6G, Ber, and TPP+ by ITC, and all drugs bound with a stoichiometry of 1 drug per BmrR dimer (Fig. 1B, Table 1). Because of unmeasurable binding heats, R6G binding affinity for the E253Q mutant was determined by a fluorescence polarization-based assay that utilized the intrinsic fluorescence of R6G (supplemental Fig. S2). The binding affinities of wtBmrR for R6G measured by fluorescence polarization were within 2-fold that of those measured by ITC (Kd ∼ 0.75 μm) confirming the utility of both methods for determining binding constants (Table 1, supplemental Fig. S2). Different from the BRC, mutation of Glu-253 to either glutamine or alanine had little effect on the binding affinity for either Ber or TPP+ but clearly had a larger, more complex effect on R6G binding (Table 1). The dissociation constant (Kd) for R6G binding to the E253A mutant was ∼8-fold higher than that of wtBmrR. Strikingly, the Kd for E253Q binding to R6G was 34.1 μm, an ∼87-fold reduction in binding affinity (Table 1). Thus, in the context of the full-length protein, a negative charge on residue 253 is unimportant for binding TPP+ or Ber but contributes significantly to R6G binding.TABLE 1Thermodynamic parameters derived from isothermal titration calorimetry binding experiments of selected BmrR mutants and drug moleculesMutantDrugKaaS.D. are calculated from the results of three separate experiments.KdΔHTΔSΔGm−1μmkcal/molkcal/molkcal/molR275EBerberine(1.08 ± 0.4) × 10510.3 ± 4.3−4.7 ± 0.42.3 ± 0.7−7.1 ± 0.2E253ABerberine(6.36 ± 0.8) × 10415.9 ± 2.0−2.1 ± 1.14.7 ± 1.0−6.8 ± 0.1E253QBerberine(7.86 ± 2.5) × 10413.6 ± 4.0−0.85 ± 0.26.0 ± 0.03−6.9 ± 0.2R275ER6G(1.07 ± 0.19) × 1060.96 ± 0.2−1.5 ± 0.037.0 ± 0.1−8.5 ± 0.1E253QR6G34.1bKd Derived from fluorescence polarization measurements.E253AR6G(1.32 ± 0.1) × 1057.6 ± 0.6−3.5 ± 0.63.7 ± 0.7−7.2 ± 0.05R275ETPP+(1.43 ± 0.4) × 10474.0 ± 20.5−1.4 ± 0.34.4 ± 0.1−5.8 ± 0.2E253ATPP+(1.38 ± 0.3) × 10475.2 ± 18.5−0.60 ± 0.085.2 ± 0.2−5.8 ± 0.1E253QTPP+(1.31 ± 0.5) × 10462.6 ± 3.3−0.31 ± 0.055.6 ± 0.02−5.9 ± 0.03a S.D. are calculated from the results of three separate experiments.b Kd Derived from fluorescence polarization measurements. Open table in a new tab Structures of BmrR-R6G-DNA and BmrR-Ber-DNA Ternary Complexes—To understand the unexpected results of the drug binding experiments as well as to delineate the atomic details of BmrR-R6G and BmrR-Ber binding, we determined their crystal structures in complex with cognate DNA (Fig. 2). To do so, a suitable cryoprotectant was developed for crystals of the previously described BmrR-TPP+-DNA complex (20Heldwein E.E. Brennan R.G. Nature. 2001; 409: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and resulted in an increased resolution from ∼3.0 to 2.4 Å (21Newberry K.J. Brennan R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20356-20362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, in lieu of TPP+, the multidrug binding pocket contained four imidazole molecules, three of which form the corners of an isosceles triangle with the fourth sitting in the triangle toward the bottom (Fig. 2A). On hindsight, imidazole binding is not surprising, as this molecule is aromatic and partially positive at pH ≤ 6.5 and at a concentration of ∼1 m, used for crystallization, should compete well against all BmrR ligands. Indeed, imidazole decreases BmrR binding to R6G by 22-fold at concentrations as low as 125 mm (data not shown). Thus, TPP+ with a Kd ∼ 74 μm was out-competed by ∼1 m imidazole. To avoid this complication, crystals of all other wtBmrR-drug-DNA complexes were grown without imidazole followed by soaking in saturating amounts of drugs. The resulting structures of the ternary complexes of wtBmrR-R6G-DNA and wtBmrR-Ber-DNA were solved to 2.6 and 2.7 Å resolution, respectively (Table 2).TABLE 2Selected crystallographic data and refinement statisticsE253Q-DNAE253A-DNAR275E-R6G-DNAR275E-Ber-DNAData collectionWavelength (Å)1.00030.98400.97890.9790Resolution (Å)47.2-2.860.4-2.852.4-2.686.1-2.7Observed reflections (#)455,058455,932317,101219,227Unique reflections (#)20,90020,87026,42923,429Completeness (%) (last shell)99.3 (99.9)98.5 (99.0)99.7 (99.6)98.9 (98.6)I/σI (last shell)10.0 (1.6)12.2 (1.7)13.2 (1.8)7.3 (1.4)Rsym (%)aRsym = ∑∑Ihkl - Ihkl(j)/∑Ihkl, where Ihkl(j) is the observed intensity, and Ihkl is the final average value of intensity"
https://openalex.org/W1969875733,"The gluconeogenic enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) is degraded in the vacuole when glucose is added to glucose-starved cells. Before it is delivered to the vacuole, however, FBPase is imported into intermediate carriers called Vid (vacuole import and degradation) vesicles. Here, using biochemical and genetic approaches, we identified a requirement for SEC28 in FBPase degradation. SEC28 encodes the epsilon-COP subunit of COPI (coat protein complex I) coatomer proteins. When SEC28 and other coatomer genes were mutated, FBPase degradation was defective and FBPase association with Vid vesicles was impaired. Coatomer proteins were identified as components of Vid vesicles, and they formed a protein complex with a Vid vesicle-specific protein, Vid24p. Furthermore, Vid24p association with Vid vesicles was impaired when coatomer genes were mutated. Kinetic studies indicated that Sec28p traffics to multiple locations. Sec28p was in Vid vesicles, endocytic compartments, and the vacuolar membrane in various mutants that block the FBPase degradation pathway. Sec28p was also found in vesicles adjacent to the vacuolar membrane in the ret2-1 coatomer mutant. We propose that Sec28p resides in Vid vesicles, and these vesicles converge with the endocytic pathway. After fusion, Sec28p is distributed on the vacuolar membrane, where it concentrates on vesicles that pinch off from this organelle. FBPase also utilizes the endocytic pathway for transport to the vacuole, as demonstrated by its presence in endocytic compartments in the Deltavph1 mutant. Taken together, our results indicate a strong connection between the Vid trafficking pathway and the endocytic pathway."

The type 2 (InsP3R2) and type 3 (InsP3R3) InsP3R are the predominant isoforms expressed in acinar cells and are required for proper exocrine gland function.

Acinar cell Ca2+ signals result from the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores followed closely by Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane. Ca2+ release is initiated by the binding of InsP3 to InsP3 receptors (InsP3R) localized primarily to the apical “trigger zone” of the acinar cell (7Lee M.G. Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Wojcikiewicz R.J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The importance of these particular isoforms to exocrine gland function was recently demonstrated using knock-out mice. Genetic ablation of both InsP3R2 and InsP3R3 resulted in severely attenuated exocrine gland function and death soon after weaning (12Futatsugi A. Nakamura T. Yamada M.K. Ebisui E. Nakamura K. Uchida K. Kitaguchi T. Takahashi-Iwanaga H. Noda T. Aruga J. Mikoshiba K. Science. 2005; 309: 2232-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The observed phenotypes were linked to a dramatic reduction in secretagogue-induced Ca2+ signals in acinar cells of the pancreas and salivary glands (12Futatsugi A. Nakamura T. Yamada M.K. Ebisui E. Nakamura K. Uchida K. Kitaguchi T. Takahashi-Iwanaga H. Noda T. Aruga J. Mikoshiba K. Science. 2005; 309: 2232-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Given that these isoforms are central to stimulus-secretion coupling, modulation of Ca2+ release from InsP3R2 and InsP3R3 by cellular factors likely impacts exocrine gland physiology and/or pathophysiology.InsP3R can be modulated by multiple mechanisms in addition to InsP3 binding. Modulatory factors include cytosolic Ca2+ levels, the phosphorylation state of the receptors, ATP binding, and protein-protein interactions (14Patel S. Joseph S.K. Thomas A.P. Cell Calcium. 1999; 25: 247-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 15Patterson R.L. Boehning D. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev.

Furthermore, because of primary sequence variability, the three InsP3R isoforms are differentially susceptible to many of these regulatory inputs. For example, InsP3R2 has a higher affinity for InsP3, and cells predominantly expressing this isoform exhibit a higher functional sensitivity for InsP3 (18Wojcikiewicz R.J. Luo S.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 656-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). InsP3R1 is more susceptible than the other isoforms to phosphorylation by protein kinase A (19Wojcikiewicz R.J. Luo S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5670-5677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In addition, proteins such as ERp44 (20Higo T. Hattori M. Nakamura T. Natsume T. Michikawa T.

The three isoforms are also differentially modulated by ATP binding, with InsP3R1 and InsP3R2 regulated by lower ATP concentrations than InsP3R3 (22Miyakawa T. Maeda A. Yamazawa T. Hirose K.

Even though isoform-specific regulation of InsP3R has been well documented, the physiological consequences of this differential modulation are poorly defined.Recently, we reported that ATP modulates InsP3R2 and InsP3R3 with dramatically different sensitivities and modes of action (24Betzenhauser M.J. Wagner II, L.E. Iwai M. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21579-21587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Specifically, when expressed in isolation in DT40-3KO cells, ATP enhanced InsP3R2 activity with an EC50 for ATP of 40 μm, whereas ATP increased InsP3R3 activity with a 10-fold lower sensitivity (24Betzenhauser M.J.

Another important difference between the two receptors was that InsP3R2 attained maximal IICR in the absence of ATP, whereas InsP3R3 was unable to maximally release Ca2+ unless ATP was present. In addition, the molecular determinants responsible for regulation by ATP differed in InsP3R2 and InsP3R3 such that mutation of a conserved nucleotide-binding motif abrogated modulation only in InsP3R2 (24Betzenhauser M.J. Wagner II, L.E. Iwai M. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21579-21587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These experiments documented the effects of ATP on heterologously expressed InsP3R expressed in isolation in a model cell. However, all three InsP3R are expressed to a varying degree in most cell types outside of the cerebellum (13Wojcikiewicz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The consequences of InsP3R modulation may therefore result from the effects on a dominant isoform or, alternatively, from the combined effects on multiple isoforms.Pancreatic acinar cells provide an ideal system to test this idea because they natively express all three InsP3R isoforms (13Wojcikiewicz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Also, in contrast to a heterologous expression system, InsP3R expression levels are controlled by endogenous factors, and the receptors are properly localized. As evidenced by knock-out mice, there are clear physiological roles for InsP3R2 and InsP3R3 in these cells (12Futatsugi A. Nakamura T. Yamada M.K. Ebisui E. Nakamura K. Uchida K. Kitaguchi T. Takahashi-Iwanaga H. Noda T. Aruga J. Mikoshiba K. Science. 2005; 309: 2232-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Given that InsP3R2 is more sensitive to ATP modulation than InsP3R3, we hypothesized that this isoform would determine the sensitivity to ATP of IICR in pancreatic acinar cells and other cells expressing mixed populations of InsP3R. We tested this idea by examining the effects of ATP on IICR in pancreatic acinar cells and other cell lines of pancreatic origin expressing mixed InsP3R populations.Pancreatic acinar cells and AR4-2J cells both exhibited a high sensitivity to ATP modulation, similar to cells expressing InsP3R2 in isolation. The sensitivity to ATP was significantly reduced in pancreatic acinar cells from InsP3R2 knock-out (KO) mice, indicating a role for InsP3R2 in setting the sensitivity of IICR to ATP modulation. Additionally, the ATP sensitivity of rat insulinoma RinM5F cells, which in the main express InsP3R3, was increased by ectopic expression of InsP3R2. ATP depletion, which attenuates Ca2+ signals in pancreatic acinar cells, was more effective in inhibiting Ca2+ signals in cells from InsP3R2-deficient mice. These results indicate that InsP3R2 determines the sensitivity of IICR to ATP. Because of the high sensitivity of InsP3R2 to ATP modulation, this isoform may protect cellular Ca2+ signaling from the inhibitory effects of ATP depletion in cells expressing this isoform, thus preserving IICR during times of metabolic stress.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIsolation of Mouse Pancreatic Acinar Cells—Pancreatic acinar cells were obtained from freely fed NIH Black Swiss mice or InsP3R2-KO mice (30Li X.

Pancreases were enzymatically digested with type II collagenase (Sigma) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor for 30 min, followed by gentle trituration. Acini were then filtered through 100-μm nylon mesh, centrifuged at 75 × g through 1% bovine serum albumin in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and resuspended in 1% bovine serum albumin in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium.Culture of AR4-2J and RinM5F Cells—AR4-2J and RinM5F cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. AR4-2J cells were maintained in F12K medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum. RinM5F cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were dispersed by trypsin digestion, washed in trypsin-free medium, and seeded on glass coverslips 24–48 h before experimentation.Western Blots—Lysates were prepared from pancreatic acinar cells isolated from wild-type (WT) or InsP3R2-KO mice by boiling in SDS loading buffer. Protein concentrations were determined using Amido Black. 75 μg of each lysate were separated by PAGE on a 5% gel. After transfer to nitrocellulose, blots were probed with antibodies against InsP3R1 (a kind gift from Dr. Suresh Joseph), InsP3R2, or InsP3R3 (BD Biosciences). Membranes were then incubated with either goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to IRDye 800CW (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). Membranes were scanned for fluorescence emission at 800 nm using an Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences).Transfection of RinM5F Cells—Cells were seeded on glass coverslips 24–48 h prior to transfection at ∼80% confluence. Cells were transfected with 2 μg of pHcRed1-Nuc (Clontech) alone or in combination with 10 μg of pcDNA3-C2 (InsP3R2 cDNA in pcDNA3.1) (26Iwai M. Tateishi Y. Hattori M. Mizutani A. Nakamura T.

DNA was introduced into cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Permeabilized Cell Ca2+ Measurements—Cells were loaded with 10 μm furaptra/AM (TefLabs, Austin, TX) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then allowed to adhere to Cell-Tak (BD Biosciences)-coated coverslips at the bottom of a small volume perfusion chamber (Warner). Cells were permeabilized by superfusion for 1–2 min with 40 μm β-escin in intracellular medium containing 125 mm KCl, 19 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, and 1 mm EGTA (pH 7.3). Permeabilized cells were washed in intracellular medium without β-escin for 15 min to facilitate removal of cytosolic dye. Cells were superfused in intracellular medium containing 0.650 μm CaCl2 (free [Ca2+] = 200 nm), 1.4 mm MgCl2, and 3 mm Na2ATP to activate sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) and to load the intracellular Ca2+ stores. The free [Ca2+] was maintained at a constant 200 nm throughout all experimental maneuvers. Free [Ca2+] was verified by fluorometric fura-2 measurements using buffer solutions with or without 5 mm ATP. The emission of the dye above 505 nm following excitation at 340 and 380 nm (exposure for 15 ms, once every 3 s) was recorded using a TILL Photonics imaging system. Rates of Ca2+ release were estimated from these responses by fitting period of decreasing fluorescence to a single exponential function (GraphPad Prism).Intact Cell Ca2+ Measurements—Pancreatic acinar cells were loaded with the Ca2+-sensitive dye fura-2/AM (2 μm; TefLabs) at room temperature for 30 min. Fura-2-loaded cells were allowed to adhere to a glass coverslip at the bottom of a perfusion chamber. Cells were perfused in HEPES-buffered physiological saline containing 137 mm NaCl, 0.56 mm MgCl2, 4.7 mm KCl, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 10 mm HEPES, 5.5 mm glucose, and 1.26 mm CaCl2 (pH 7.4). Imaging was performed using an inverted Nikon microscope through a 40× oil immersion objective lens (numerical aperture, 1.3). Fura-2-loaded cells were excited alternately with light at 340 and 380 nm using a monochromator-based illumination system (TILL Photonics), and the emission at 510 nm was captured using a digital frame transfer CCD camera.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONATP Enhances IICR in Pancreatic Acinar Cells—ATP levels can impact Ca2+ signals in pancreatic acinar cells by multiple mechanisms. For example, plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase and SERCA require ATP to move Ca2+ across lipid bilayers. Consistent with this idea, both Ca2+ extrusion and Ca2+ entry were recently shown to be altered by declining ATP levels (31Barrow S.L. Voronina S.G. da Silva Xavier G. Chvanov M.A. Longbottom R.E. Gerasimenko O.V. Petersen O.H. Rutter G.A. Tepikin A.V. Pflügers Arch. 2008; 455: 1025-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Ca2+ release from intracellular stores could also be affected by falling ATP levels because ATP positively regulates InsP3R activity. This effect would be predicted to be dependent on the sensitivity of IICR to ATP, which, in turn, would be dependent on the relative expression levels of InsP3R isoforms present in the cells.Mouse pancreatic exocrine cells express InsP3R2 and InsP3R3 at nearly equal proportions. These two isoforms together constitute ∼97% of the total InsP3R population (13Wojcikiewicz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). However, InsP3R2 and InsP3R3 exhibit dramatically different sensitivities to ATP (24Betzenhauser M.J. Wagner II, L.E. Iwai M. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21579-21587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Given the equal expression levels of these two isoforms in pancreatic acinar cells, either subtype could determine the overall sensitivity of IICR to ATP. Alternatively, the sensitivity to ATP could reflect a mixed contribution from each isoform.We used unidirectional fluorescent endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ measurements in permeabilized cells to test the effects of ATP on IICR (22Miyakawa T.

Chem. 2006; 281: 17410-17419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Pancreatic acinar cells were loaded with the low affinity Ca2+-sensitive dye furaptra and subsequently permeabilized with β-escin to release the cytosolic dye. As shown in Fig. 1A, perfusion with buffer containing CaCl2, MgCl2, and ATP caused an increase in the fluorescence ratio, indicating Ca2+ entering ER stores. After loading the stores, MgCl2 was washed off for 1 min to prevent SERCA activation and to allow unidirectional measurements of IICR. Application of 10 μm InsP3 caused a decrease in the fluorescence ratio, indicating Ca2+ leaving the ER. The rate of the decrease in the fluorescence ratio increased with stronger stimulation (Fig. 1B). Fitting the results of these experiments to single exponential functions allowed comparison of InsP3R activity under the various experimental conditions.We found that the ability of ATP to enhance IICR was strongly dependent on [InsP3]. For example, 5 mm ATP enhanced the rate of release initiated by 0.3 μm InsP3 (Fig. 1C, red versus black trace). However, ATP had no effect on the rate of IICR stimulated by 10 μm InsP3 (Fig. 1C, red versus black trace). As shown in Fig. 1D, pancreatic acinar cells exhibited an EC50 for InsP3 of 1.4 μm in the absence of ATP and an EC50 of 0.8 μm in the presence of 5 mm ATP. This indicates that ATP increases the sensitivity of IICR in pancreatic acinar cells. In a similar fashion to cells expressing InsP3R2 in isolation, the effects of ATP were only evident at submaximal InsP3 levels. Calcium signaling in pancreatic acinar cells would therefore be predicted to be dependent on ATP levels exclusively at low physiological levels of secretagogue stimulation and may contribute to the stereotypical spatial and temporal characteristics of Ca2+ signals under these conditions.InsP3R2 Determines the Sensitivity of IICR to ATP—ATP enhanced IICR in pancreatic acinar cells in a similar manner to cells expressing InsP3R2 in isolation. However, InsP3R1 is expressed to some extent in pancreatic acinar cells and could contribute to the effects of ATP on IICR observed above. To define the role of InsP3R2 in setting the sensitivity of IICR to ATP, we next tested ATP modulation of IICR in pancreatic acinar cells isolated from InsP3R2-KO mice.InsP3R2 was not detected by Western blotting in lysates prepared from InsP3R2-KO mice (Fig. 2A). InsP3R1 and InsP3R3 were, however, both detected in these same lysates (Fig. 2A). A reduction in the amplitude of agonist-induced Ca2+ signals was observed in pancreatic and submandibular salivary gland acinar cells isolated from InsP3R2-KO mice (12Futatsugi A. Nakamura T. Yamada M.K. Ebisui E. Nakamura K. Uchida K. Kitaguchi T. Takahashi-Iwanaga H. Noda T. Aruga J. Mikoshiba K. Science. 2005; 309: 2232-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Because the mice used in the present study (30Li X. Zima A.V. Sheikh F. Blatter L.A. Chen J. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 1274-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) were from a different genetic background compared with the mice used by Futatsugi et al. (12Futatsugi A. Nakamura T. Yamada M.K. Ebisui E. Nakamura K. Uchida K. Kitaguchi T. Takahashi-Iwanaga H. Noda T. Aruga J. Mikoshiba K. Science. 2005; 309: 2232-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), we confirmed the effects of InsP3R2-KO on agonist-induced Ca2+ signals in our mice. Consistent with the data of Futatsugi et al., the removal of InsP3R2 had no effect on the apical-to-basal propagation of the carbachol (CCh)-induced Ca2+ signal (data not shown). Also consistent with the earlier study, the amplitudes of CCh-induced Ca2+ signals were reduced in pancreatic acinar cells from InsP3R2-KO mice (Fig. 2). Ca2+ transient amplitudes were reduced over a range of CCh concentrations, and a shift in the EC50 for CCh was also apparent. Half-maximal stimulation occurred at 120 nm CCh for WT cells and at 520 nm CCh for InsP3R2-KO cells (Fig. 2B). The changes in CCh-induced Ca2+ signals are unlikely to be the result of a reduction in ER store content because the level of Ca2+ in ER stores is unaffected in InsP3R2/3-double KO mice (12Futatsugi A. Nakamura T. Yamada M.K. Ebisui E. Nakamura K. Uchida K. Kitaguchi T. Takahashi-Iwanaga H. Noda T. Aruga J. Mikoshiba K.

Each point is the average of at least three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next, we tested the effects of ablating InsP3R2 on IICR in pancreatic acinar cells. As shown in Fig. 3, a striking property of IICR from InsP3R2-KO cells was the requirement of ATP for maximal Ca2+ release (Fig. 3, A and B). Whereas cells isolated from WT mice exhibited maximal release in the absence of ATP (shown in Fig. 1, C and D), cells from InsP3R2-KO mice failed to maximally release Ca2+ unless ATP was present. The dramatic difference in the behavior of the two cell types can be appreciated by comparing the concentration-response curves for InsP3 in the presence and absence of ATP (Fig. 1D versus Fig. 3C). Whereas the effects of ATP were evident only with submaximal stimulation in WT cells, the effects of ATP were pronounced at maximal [InsP3] in InsP3R2-KO cells.FIGURE 3ATP enhances IICR at maximal [InsP3] in pancreatic acinar cells from InsP3R2-KO mice. A and B, representative furaptra recordings from individual permeabilized pancreatic acinar cells from InsP3R2-KO mice. In A, 5 mm ATP enhanced IICR when 10 μm InsP3 was used for stimulation compared with 10 μm InsP3 in the absence of ATP. In B, 30 μm InsP3 was added initially in the absence of ATP, and 5 mm ATP was added at the time point indicated. C, concentration-response relationship for InsP3 in the absence (black squares) versus presence (red triangles) of 5 mm ATP. Each point is the average of at least five separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The maximal release rates in the presence of 5 mm ATP were significantly reduced in cells isolated from InsP3R2-KO mice (WT = 0.20 ± 0.02 s-1 and KO = 0.05 ± 0.01 s-1; p < 0.05). The EC50 of IICR in the presence of 5 mm ATP was also shifted from 0.8 μm InsP3 in cells from WT mice to 2.2 μm InsP3 in cells from InsP3R2-KO mice (Figs. 1D and 3C). This suggests that removal of InsP3R2 dramatically reduces the sensitivity of the internal stores to InsP3. InsP3R2 has been shown to exhibit a higher affinity for InsP3 than the other two isoforms (18Wojci"

Recently, we used recombinant human (rhu)Hsp70 to define in more detail the critical parameters for the induction of immune effector responses (17Bendz H. Ruhland S.C. Pandya M.J. Hainzl O.

Highly purified and endotoxin-depleted rhuHsp70 was found to efficiently deliver exogenous peptides to DCs resulting in T cell activation, provided that peptide and Hsp70 had formed stable complexes before exposure to DCs. Phenotypic maturation or cytokine secretion of DCs was not observed and not required for the rhuHsp70-mediated enhancement of cross-presentation and T cell stimulation. Here we used highly purified rhuHsp70 and mycHsp70 proteins and examined whether mycHsp70 also enhances cross-presentation of exogenous antigenic protein sequences and tested whether calcium signaling or CCR5 were required for Hsp70-assisted antigen presentation and T cell stimulation. Reagents and Peptides—ADP, ionomycin, suramin, Escherichia coli-derived LPS (strain 0111:B4), and reagents for calcium signaling (Indo-I AM, Pluronic F-127, DMSO) were purchased from Sigma.

The peptides were synthesized as hybrids of the nonameric HLA-A2 binding motif with the N-terminal octameric sequence HWDFAWPW (here named pep70) (pep70-MART-1: GSGHWDFAWPWGSGLAGIGILTV).

After ADP affinity chromatography, buffer was exchanged using PD10 columns followed by extensive dialysis (48 h, 5000× buffer volume) and diafiltration (Vivaspin 20, 30,000 MWCO PES, Sartorius Stedim Biotech).

Briefly, in parallel wells of a 96-well cell culture plate identical amounts of pep70-MART-peptide (70 nm) alone or together with rhuHsp70 (1 μm) or mycHsp70-(359–625) (1 μm) were incubated in HKM buffer (total volume of 30 μl) for 4 h at room temperature for complex formation.

Ionomycin (250 ng/ml), ADP solutions, mycHsp70-(359–625) (1 μm), rhuHsp70 (300 nm), mycHsp70 Lionex (1 μm), or the corresponding protein-depleted solutions (volumes corresponding to the 300 nm rhuHsp70 or 1 μm mycHsp70 protein solutions, respectively) were added 1 min after the cells were measured without stimulation for background establishment. The protein-depleted solutions were obtained by removing protein through filtration of the stock preparation through a PES membrane with 30-kDa molecular weight cutoff (Vivaspin 20, 30.000 MWCO PES). For inhibition, DCs were preincubated with 250 μm suramin for 5 min. As control, the buffers without stimulating agents were measured and did not result in a calcium signal.

Our previous results using highly purified rhuHsp70 had shown that rhuHsp70 enhances cross-presentation and T cell stimulation without changing the DC phenotype (17Bendz H. Ruhland S.C. Pandya M.J. Hainzl O. Riegelsberger S. Brauchle C. Mayer M.P. Buchner J. Issels R.D. Noessner E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 31688-31702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We therefore compared and contrasted our rhuHsp70 to the same mycHsp70 preparation used in the published studies (12Floto R.A. MacAry P.A. Boname J.M. Mien T.S. Kampmann B. Hair J.R. Huey O.S.

Hsp70 proteins, mycobacterial, and human, recombinantly expressed in E. coli, are generally purified using ATP affinity chromatography, ATP elution, and buffer exchange (20Buchberger A. Schroder H. Buttner M. Valencia A. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Nucleotides are documented inducers of calcium signals in immune cells (21la Sala A. Ferrari D. Corinti S. Cavani A. Di Virgilio F. Girolomoni G. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1611-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 22Marteau F. Communi D. Boeynaems J.M. Suarez Gonzalez N. J.

Blood. 2005; 105: 1582-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Therefore, we suspected that residual ATP or ADP could have caused the reported calcium effect. To control for possible artifacts evoked by contaminants in the protein solution, we prepared a protein-depleted solution by separating the mycHsp70 protein from the protein solution by centrifugation through a membrane with a 30-kDa cutoff. SDS-PAGE and silver staining confirmed that the protein-depleted solution had no detectable Hsp70 protein or protein fragments. (Fig. 1A shows the result for mycHsp70; similar results were seen for rhuHsp70; not shown.) Testing for calcium signaling we observed that the mycHsp70 protein-depleted solution induced a calcium signal in DCs that was essentially equivalent to that seen with the complete commercial mycHsp70 protein preparation (Fig. 1A). We then used an in-house rhu-Hsp70 preparation, which had undergone a less rigorous dialysis after ATP affinity chromatography, as well a commercially available human Hsp70 (Stressgen (ESP-555). Our less dialyzed rhuHsp70(nc+) preparation induced a calcium flux comparable in magnitude to the commercial mycHsp70 (Fig. 1B), the commercial rhuHsp70 (Stressgen) induced a lower signal. We then depleted the rhuHsp70 protein from the less dialyzed protein solution as performed for mycHsp70 and tested the resultant protein-free solution for its ability to induce a calcium flux in DCs. As was found for the mycHsp70 preparation, the protein-depleted solution of rhuHsp70 triggered identical calcium responses as seen with the protein-containing solution (Fig. 1C, upper panel: red line versus dotted black line). Next, we tested titered solutions of commercial ADP and observed dose-dependent calcium signals (Fig. 1C, lower panel). A 370 nm ADP solution, which corresponded to the calculated amount of residual free nucleotide in our less dialyzed rhu-Hsp70, gave an identical signal (Fig. 1C, lower panel: black line versus red line). At 370 nm ADP, the calcium response of DCs was not in saturation (Fig. 1C, lower panel: 370 nm versus 1 μm ADP), yet the magnitude of the response to 300 nm rhuHsp70 was not higher than that achieved with the protein-free solution (Fig. 1C, upper panel) suggesting that ADP/ATP nucleotides within that Hsp70 preparation were responsible for the calcium influx with no or minimal contribution of the rhuHsp70 protein itself. Consistent with this interpretation, we found that the response induced by this less dialyzed (nucleotide-containing) rhuHsp70 protein preparation was completely blocked by the purinoreceptor antagonist, suramin, as was the response to the ADP solution (Fig. 1C, upper panel). To confirm the conclusion that the mycHsp70 and rhuHsp70 proteins themselves do not cause calcium signals in DCs, we used an extensively dialyzed preparation of rhuHsp70, and the C-terminal substrate binding domain of mycHsp70, mycHsp70-(359–625) previously described as conferring biologic activity with regards to calcium signaling, antigen binding, and T cell activation (19MacAry P.A. Javid B. Floto R.A. Smith K.G. Oehlmann W. Singh M. Lehner P.J. Immunity. 2004; 20: 95-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Importantly, this protein lacks the ATP binding domain and is therefore not purified via ATP-agarose. Neither the rhuHsp70 nor the mycHsp70-(359–625) induced a calcium signal in DCs (Fig. 2A). Because mycHsp70-associated calcium signals have been reported to be mediated through CCR5 binding, we also measured the level of surface CCR5 expression of our DCs by fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. As shown in Fig. 2B, the DCs used in these experiments were CCR5-positive excluding the possibility that an absence of CCR5 could have caused the failure to induce a calcium signal. Additionally, we analyzed surface marker expression and cytokine secretion of DCs before and after incubation with rhuHsp70. Two rhuHsp70 preparations were compared: one was strongly dialyzed and therefore depleted of nucleotides (no calcium signaling activity), the other was less dialyzed and contained nucleotides (calcium signaling activity). All Hsp70 preparations were carefully endotoxin-depleted and induced no changes in DC phenotype or cytokine secretion (see Ref. 17Bendz H. Ruhland S.C. Pandya M.J. Hainzl O. Riegelsberger S. Brauchle C. Mayer M.P. Buchner J. Issels R.D. Noessner E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 31688-31702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). LPS was used as a control. As shown in Fig. 3A, the rhuHsp70 preparations did not change surface markers CD86, CD80, CD40, or CD83, regardless whether they contained nucleotides and had calcium signaling activity or were highly purified and did not cause calcium signals. LPS up-regulated these markers. Similarly, neither the nucleotide-containing nor the nucleotide-depleted rhuHsp70 preparation in its endotoxin-depleted form modulated the cytokine or chemokine profile of DCs, while LPS induced the secretion these factors (Fig. 3B; IL-10, IL-12p70, and TNF-α are shown as representative examples. IL-6, GM-CSF, CCL5/RANTES were also unchanged; not shown). These results indicate that low concentrations of nucleotides, as present in less dialyzed rhuHsp70 preparations, which cause calcium signals in DCs, do not change phenotypic markers or cytokine secretion, while surface markers and cytokine/chemokine secretion can be induced by LPS consistent with its TLR signaling activity (see references in Ref. 17Bendz H. Ruhland S.C. Pandya M.J. Hainzl O. Riegelsberger S. Brauchle C. Mayer M.P. Buchner J. Issels R.D. Noessner E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 31688-31702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We did not perform these analyses with mycHsp70, because the available commercial source of mycHsp70 is reported to be contaminated by flagellin (24Ye Z. Gan Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4479-4484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), which is known to up-regulate phenotypic markers and induce cytokine and chemokine secretion through TLR5 (25Means T.K. Hayashi F. Smith K.D. Aderem A. Luster A.D. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 5165-5175Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Because we lacked the tools to measure or remove flagellin from protein preparations it would have been beyond our scope to distinguish mcyHsp70 effects from those of potential flagellin contamination. Human and Mycobacterial Hsp70 Enhance Cross-presentation without Involving Calcium Signals or CCR5—CCR5 binding and calcium signaling were reported to be closely linked to the T cell stimulatory activity of mycHsp70 (12Floto R.A. MacAry P.A. Boname J.M. Mien T.S. Kampmann B. Hair J.R. Huey O.S. Houben E.N. Pieters J. Day C. Oehlmann W. Singh M. Smith K.G. Lehner P.J.

Immunol. 2006; 36: 2304-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Given that the calcium signals of mycHsp70 or huHsp70 were caused by nucleotide contamination of the protein preparations, we then asked whether in the absence of calcium signals, it was possible to observe mycHsp70-mediated antigen cross-presentation and T-cell activation. To address this question we tested the non-signaling preparation of mycHsp70-(325–625) in our cross-presentation system (17Bendz H. Ruhland S.C. Pandya M.J. Hainzl O. Riegelsberger S. Brauchle C. Mayer M.P. Buchner J. Issels R.D. Noessner E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 31688-31702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and compared its ability to activate T cells to the dialyzed non-signaling rhuHsp70. The key elements of the system are highly purified Hsp70 proteins, the antigenic peptide pep70-MART-1 and the respective antigen-specific CTL. APCs were incubated in parallel settings with identical concentrations of peptide either with or without the addition of Hsp70. Peptide and Hsp70 are incubated to allow complex formation. The efficacy of peptide cross-presentation was quantified by the ability of APCs to induce an IFN-γ response in antigen-specific CTL as described (17Bendz H. Ruhland S.C. Pandya M.J. Hainzl O. Riegelsberger S. Brauchle C. Mayer M.P. Buchner J. Issels R.D. Noessner E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 31688-31702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). As APCs we selected the CCR5-negative B cell line LCL721.45 to evaluate in parallel the importance of CCR5 expression. As shown in Fig. 4, a 2-fold higher IFN-γ response was obtained when peptide was delivered to the APCs as a complex with either mycHsp70-(325–625) or rhuHsp70. These results demonstrate that mycHsp70 enhances antigen cross-presentation similar to rhuHsp70, and neither rhuHsp70 nor mycHsp70 requires CCR5 or calcium for this process. Here we demonstrate that highly purified rhuHsp70 protein and the C-terminal mycHsp70 fragment, mycHsp70-(325–625) do not induce calcium signals in APCs nor do they require CCR5 or calcium signals to enhance exogenous antigen cross-presentation for T cell stimulation. Importantly, we found that nucleotides and possibly other, yet to be identified, contaminants within recombinant human and mycobacterial Hsp70 preparations (including those of commercial suppliers) cause calcium signals in myeloid DCs. As reported previously (17Bendz H. Ruhland S.C. Pandya M.J. Hainzl O. Riegelsberger S. Brauchle C. Mayer M.P. Buchner J. Issels R.D. Noessner E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 31688-31702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), the Hsp70-mediated activity to stimulate antigen-specific T cell responses is strictly dependent on the ability of Hsp70 to form complexes with the exogenous peptide without requiring Hsp70-induced DC phenotypic or secretory changes. The now observed independency of calcium signaling further strengthens the conclusion that the ability of Hsp70s (human and bacterial alike) to activate adaptive immune responses may simply be an extension of their biochemical activity as molecular chaperones and there is no need to assign new activities to Hsp70 proteins to explain this immunological activity. A similar conclusion was reached by others (26Bausinger H. Lipsker D. Hanau D. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 342-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 27Tobian A.A.

Immunol. 2005; 174: 5209-5214Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Endotoxins were the first identified contaminants of Hsp70 and other HSP preparations (29Bausinger H. Lipsker D. Ziylan U. Manie S. Briand J.P. Cazenave J.P. Muller S. Haeuw J.F. Ravanat C. de la Salle H. Hanau D. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 3708-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 30Wallin R.P. Lundqvist A.

Leukoc Biol. 2004; 76: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Unnoticed as contaminants, their stimulatory effects on DCs had led to the wrong conclusion that HSP proteins themselves have DC stimulatory capacity. Today HSP protein preparations are generally controlled for endotoxin contamination. Nevertheless, these early reports obtained with uncontrolled HSP preparations are still being used to support the postulate that HSPs have innate immune stimulatory capacity (for examples, see references 22, 43, 44 in Ref. 32Pockley A.G.

New contaminants with bioactivity on DCs and other APCs have recently emerged. Nucleotides, as detailed in this report, can now be added to the list. Nucleotides have been shown to cause calcium signals in DCs (17Bendz H. Ruhland S.C. Pandya M.J. Hainzl O. Riegelsberger S. Brauchle C. Mayer M.P. Buchner J. Issels R.D. Noessner E. J. Biol.

An additional example is flagellin, which was recently shown to “contaminate” microbial Hsp70, but less so Hsp70 from eukaryotic sources (24Ye Z. Gan Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4479-4484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Flagellin is a TLR5 agonist and can efficiently stimulate DCs to up-regulate phenotypic markers, to secrete chemokines and cytokines (25Means T.K. Hayashi F. Smith K.D. Aderem A. Luster A.D. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 5165-5175Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Importantly, microbial Hsp70 proteins are considered to be better immune adjuvants than eukaryotic Hsp70 given that microbial Hsp70 were found to “stimulate” DC maturation and chemokine secretion even after endotoxin depletion (36Javid B. MacAry P.A. Lehner P.J. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 2035-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). While this was thought to be related to their pathogen-derived nature, the recent discovery of flagellin in mycHsp70 preparations suggests that this interpretation may need to be reconsidered. As chaperones, HSPs have a high intrinsic binding capacity for hydrophobic protein sequences, nucleotides and endotoxins (37Mayer M.P. Bukau B. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 670-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (2091) Google Scholar, 38Habich C. Kempe K. van der Zee R. Rumenapf R. Akiyama H. Kolb H. Burkart V. J.

Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 301-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Thus, HSP protein preparations are prone to “contaminations” with proteins and non-proteinous substances, some of which may be difficult to remove. High standards of purification, stringent analyses of all recombinant HSP protein products for by-products and carefully controlled experimentation are indispensable to allow a precise attribution of biological function to HSP proteins and to pave the way for the utilization of their immunologic activity.

Tenascin-R (TN-R) is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein, mainly expressed in the central nervous system and predominantly by differentiating oligodendrocytes as well as some interneurons in the spinal cord, retina, cerebellum, and hippocampus (5Pesheva P.

TN-R contains a cysteine-rich amino-terminal region, epidermal growth factor-like repeats (EGFL), a region consisting of fibronectin type III (FN) homologous repeats, and a fibrinogen-like domain at the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 1) (8Fuss B.

TN-R is a multifunctional molecule with multiple domains that confer different effects on neuronal cell functions, such as neuronal cell adhesion, neurite outgrowth, modulation of sodium channels, and synaptic plasticity. The EGFL domain is anti-adhesive for microglia and hippocampal neurons, whereas the FN6-8 domain promotes adhesion of microglia or hippocampal neurons (10Lochter A. Schachner M. J.

In vivo experiments have shown that in TN-R-deficient mice functional recovery after spinal cord injury was better than in wild type control littermates, and cortical and hippocampal neuronal excitability were enhanced (13Saghatelyan A.K.

We have further shown that TN-R is responsible for radial migration of NSCs of the rostral migratory stream by attracting NSCs to the olfactory bulb or, when TN-R secreting fibroblasts are transplanted into the striatum, NSCs are attracted to the source of TN-R expression and deviate from tangential migration by attraction to the TN-R source. The role of TN-R in NSC proliferation and differentiation has, however, not been explored. NSCs are mainly found in the subgranular layer of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles in the adult mammalian central nervous system, where they have the capacity for self-renewal and differentiation into major classes of central nervous system cell types, such as neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes (17Gage F.H. Science. 2000; 287: 1433-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (4114) Google Scholar, 19Lois C. Alvarez-Buylla A. Science. 1994; 264: 1145-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1977) Google Scholar). The most active neurogenic region and the richest source of NSCs is the SVZ of the forebrain, and from the SVZ, newly generated NSCs migrate long distances to reach their final position in the olfactory bulb according to a well defined path called the rostral migratory stream. Cells then shift their migration pattern from the tangential to the radial orientation and finally differentiate into neurons (18Luskin M.B. Neuron. 1993; 11: 173-189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar, 20Alvarez-Buylla A. Garcia-Verdugo J.M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 629-634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Pencea V.

Nature. 2000; 405: 951-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). Much evidence has demonstrated the existence of a “niche,” a specialized microenvironment where stem cells are located in vivo and that contributes to NSC migration, proliferation, and differentiation as an extrinsic factor. Niches are composed of cells that affect NSC behavior by producing soluble factors (growth factors, chemokines, and neurotrophins), membrane-bound molecules, and ECM molecules. The developmental program of NSCs is regulated by these extrinsic factors (23Li L. Xie T. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 605-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar, 24Moore K.A. Lemischka I.R. Science. 2006; 311: 1880-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). ECM molecules in the SVZ are likely to control, at least in part, NSC behavior by instructive cues. For instance, TN-R mediates activity-dependent recruitment of neuroblasts in the adult mouse forebrain (25Saghatelyan A. Chevigny A. Schachner M. Lledo P.M. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In tenascin-C (TN-C)-deficient mice the rate of oligodendrocyte precursor cell migration increased and the rate of cell proliferation decreased (25Saghatelyan A. Chevigny A. Schachner M. Lledo P.M. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 26Garcion E. Faissner A. Ffrench-Constant C. Development. 2001; 128: 2485-2496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TN-C contributes to the generation of a stem cell niche within the SVZ, acting to orchestrate growth factor signaling so as to accelerate neural stem cell development (27Garcion E. Halilagic A. Faissner A. Ffrench-Constant C. Development. 2004; 131: 3423-3432Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). However, the functions of distinct domains of TN-C or TN-R acting as extrinsic factors on NSC behavior have remained unclear. In particular, the molecular mechanisms of distinct TN-R domains have not been investigated with regard to their migration and differentiation into different neural cell types, such as neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Thus, we investigated the consequences of proliferation and differentiation of NSCs exposed to TN-R. For this study, we chose to investigate the EGFL and FN6-8 domains, because these domains have emerged as the most effective in modulation of functional properties of target cell types, such as neurons, in their capacity to generate neurites on a uniform substrate or being repelled at a boundary (11Xiao Z.C. Taylor J. Montag D. Rougon G. Schachner M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 766-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 12Xiao Z.C. Hillenbrand R. Schachenr M. Thermes S. Rougon G. Gomez S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 698-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 28Lochter A. Vaughan L. Kaplony A. Prochiantz A. Schachner M. Faissner A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1159-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 30Husmann K. Faissner A. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1475-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the EGFL domain is anti-adhesive for microglia, whereas the FN6-8 domain promotes adhesion of microglia, whereas domains FN1-2 and FN3-5 do not affect microglial adhesion (23Li L. Xie T. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 605-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). Our results show that both domains modulate NSC proliferation and differentiation via the cell surface receptor β 1 integrin. Preparation of Recombinant EGFL and FN6-8 Domains—Generation and purification of the recombinant EGFL and FN6-8 domains of mouse TN-R as fusion proteins with GST were performed as described (11Xiao Z.C. Taylor J. Montag D. Rougon G. Schachner M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 766-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and the plasmids of pGEXEGFL and pGEX-FN6-8 were a kind gift of Dr. Zhi-Cheng Xiao (Singapore General Hospital, Singapore). The fusion proteins were analyzed for purity by SDS-PAGE (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and shown to have a purity of at least 90%. Neural Stem Cell Culture—Sprague-Dawley rat embryos (E13-14 days) were stripped of meninges, and coronal sections (2 mm thick) of tissue containing the SVZ of the lateral ventricles were removed under a dissection microscope and mechanically dissociated into single cells. Cells were seeded into a 6-well plate (Costar), and maintained in DMEM/F-12 medium containing B27, bFGF (20 ng/ml), EGF (20 ng/ml) (all from Invitrogen), at 37 °C in an incubator with 5% CO2. Neurospheres formed within 3-5 days were dissociated mechanically into single cells and seeded into a new 6-well plate. Neurospheres from 3 to 5 passages were used for all experiments. Cells in the neurospheres were all positive for nestin, a marker for NSCs. Proliferation of Neural Stem Cells—Dissociated NSCs from neurospheres were cultured in DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with B27, bFGF (20 ng/ml), and EGF (20 ng/ml) in the presence of GST fusion proteins (GST, EGFL, and FN6-8, 100 μg/ml, respectively) or seeded onto glass coverslips precoated with 0.1% poly-l-lysine and GST fusion proteins (GST, EGFL, and FN6-8, 100 μg/ml, respectively). After culturing for 12 and 24 h, BrdUrd (5-bromodeoxyuridine, 10 μg/ml) was added into the culture medium and cells were continuously maintained at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator up to 36 and 48 h, respectively. Then, cell proliferation on coverslips was analyzed for BrdUrd incorporation by immunocytochemistry. For the β 1 integrin blocking assay, after pre-blocking of cells with 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, NSCs seeded onto coverslips were incubated with a function-blocking β 1 integrin antibody (50 μg/ml, Pharmingen) or rabbit IgG (50 μg/ml, Pierce) for 1 h at 37 °C before adding GST fusion proteins into the culture medium. Three independent experiments were performed. Differentiation of Neural Stem Cells—Neurospheres were dissociated mechanically into single cells and maintained in the DMEM/F-12 medium with B27 and 1% fetal calf serum (FCS) at 37 °C in the CO2 incubator for 7 days in the presence of GST fusion proteins (GST, EGFL, and FN6-8, 100 μg/ml, respectively), or GST fusion proteins (GST, EGFL, and FN6-8, 100 μg/ml, respectively) were precoated onto glass coverslips. Then, cells were identified for marker protein expression to identify neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes by immunocytochemistry. For the β 1 integrin blocking assay, after preblocking of cells with 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, NSCs seeded onto coverslips incubated with a function-blocking β 1 integrin antibody (50 μg/ml, Pharmingen) or rabbit IgG (50 μg/ml, Pierce) for 2 h at 37°C before adding GST fusion proteins into the culture medium. Three independent experiments were carried out. Immunocytochemistry—Cells on coverslips were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, blocked with 10% normal goat serum in PBS, and incubated with primary antibody in 10% normal goat serum at 4 °C overnight followed with Cy2- or Cy3-labeled secondary antibody (1:1000, Beyotime, China). As primary antibodies, anti-β-tubulin III (1:1000, StemCell), anti-GFAP (1:500, DAKO), anti-NG2 (1:200, Chemicon), anti-nestin (1:300, Chemicon), anti-BrdUrd (1:200, Santa Cruz), and anti-β 1 integrin (1:200, Chemicon) were used. Nuclei were labeled with Hoechst 33342 (10 μg/ml, Molecular Probes). For the BrdUrd assay, cells were incubated in 2 m HCl for 30 min at room temperature before blocking in 10% normal goat serum. After mounting in fluorescent mounting medium (Beyotime, China), cells were visualized with an Olympus fluorescence microscope. At least 1000 cells from 10 to 15 viewing fields per group were used to calculate percentages of cells. Oligodendrocyte Differentiation Assay—The oligodendroglioma cell line OLN-93 (32Richter-Landsberg C. Heinrich M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 45: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) was used to measure the effect of EGFL on oligodendrocyte differentiation (provided kindly by Dr. Zhi-Cheng Xiao, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore). Cells were cultured in DMEM with high glucose and supplemented with 10% FCS for 6 h at 37 °C in an incubator with 5% CO2. The culture medium was then replaced with fresh DMEM containing 0.5% FCS, and cells were maintained in the presence of EGFL and GST proteins (100 μg/ml). After 5 days, cells were lysed using 1% Nonidet P-40 and analyzed for CNPase, a marker of oligodendrocytes, by immunoblotting. Co-immunoprecipitation, GST Pull-down, and Immunoblot Analysis—Rat brain Nonidet P-40 lysates (∼200 μg) and rabbit IgG (10 μg) were first incubated with 50 μl of protein A-agarose at 4 °C for 1 h to reduce nonspecific binding to the beads. Cleared lysates were then incubated with the specific anti-β 1 integrin antibody (Chemicon) for 1 h at 4 °C and then with 50 μl of protein A-agarose beads overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed, bound proteins were eluted in 50 μl of gel loading buffer, separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted with anti-TN-R antibody (1:1000, Santa Cruz). The immunoprecipitated β 1 integrin was checked as loading control by anti-β 1 integrin antibody (1:1000, Chemicon). For pull-down analysis, GST fusion proteins (15 μg/ml) immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) were incubated with NSC lysates (200 μg of protein) at 4 °C for 16 h. Bound proteins were eluted, resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE, and processed for immunoblotting with anti-β 1 integrin antibody. GST antibody (1:200, Dragonfly Science) was used to investigate the GST fusion proteins as loading control. Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance and are expressed as mean ± S.D. Significance was set as p < 0.05. FN6-8 Domain of TN-R Inhibits the Proliferation of NSCs—Because NSCs are capable of self-renewal, we first assessed the influence of TN-R EGFL and FN6-8 domains on NSC proliferation by measuring the extent of BrdUrd incorporation into NSCs obtained by dissociation of neurospheres. After maintenance of NSCs in culture for 36 or 48 h the percentage of proliferating cells as measured by incorporation of BrdUrd was decreased by FN6-8, when compared with cells treated with culture medium on GST or PBS (Fig. 2, A and B). EGFL did not show a significant difference in the percentage of the BrdUrd positive cells when compared with the culture medium and GST controls (Fig. 2, A and B). The effects of GST fusion proteins on NSCs proliferation in solution were the same as precoated on coverslips (data not shown, see supplemental Fig. S1). These results indicate that the FN6-8 domain of TN-R inhibits the proliferation of NSCs. TN-R Domains EGFL and FN6-8 Regulate NSC Differentiation—We next tested whether EGFL and FN6-8 influence the differentiation of NSCs. Single cell suspensions of NSCs were plated onto coverslips precoated with poly-l-lysine and maintained in DMEM/F-12 culture medium supplemented with B27 and 1% fetal calf serum for 7 days in the presence of soluble proteins, with PBS as a control (Fig. 3A). Cells were then fixed and subjected to immunocytochemistry using antibodies to β-tubulin III and GFAP, to label neurons and astrocytes, respectively. In the presence of EGFL the percentage of β-tubulin III-positive cells was increased by a factor of 2, from ∼8 to ∼16%, when compared with controls (PBS and GST) (Fig. 3B). FN6-8 decreased the percentage of β-tubulin III-positive cells from ∼8 to ∼6%, when compared with the controls (Fig. 3B). Differentiation of NSCs into GFAP+ cells was slightly decreased from ∼80 to 70% of all cells (Fig. 3C). In the presence of FN6-8 differentiation into GFAP positive cells was slightly increased (from ∼80 to 90% of all cells) (Fig. 3C). These observations indicate that EGFL enhances NSCs differentiation into neurons at the expense of astrocytes, whereas FN6-8 enhances NSC differentiation into astrocytes at the expense of neurons. We next tested whether EGFL and FN6-8 would influence the differentiation of NSCs into oligodendrocytes. Single cell suspensions of NSCs were plated onto coverslips precoated with poly-l-lysine and cultured in DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with B27 and 1% fetal calf serum in the presence of PBS vehicle control and GST, EGFL, and FN6-8 for 7 days, when cells were fixed and subjected to immunocytochemistry using antibodies to chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan NG2 and CNPase to mark oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and more mature oligodendrocytes, respectively (Fig. 4). EGFL increased the percentage of NG2 positive cells from 5 to 6% in the control to ∼11% (Fig. 4B), whereas it decreased the percentage of CNPase positive cells from 5 to 6% to about 2% (Fig. 4C). FN6-8 slightly decreased the percentage of NG positive cells versus the controls (from 5-6% to ∼3%) and reduced the percentage of CNPase-positive cells to approximately the same level as achieved by EGFL (Fig. 4C). These observations suggest that EGFL favors the existence of NSCs in the oligodendrocyte progenitor stage rather than the more differentiated state. The results also show a tendency for FN6-8 to reduce a percentage of cells in the oligodendrocyte progenitor state, but less so at the expense of the more mature state than seen with EGFL. We suggest that FN6-8 reduces the differentiation of NSCs into the oligodendrocyte lineage (Fig. 4D). The effects of GST fusion proteins on NSCs differentiation were the same with that of GST fusion proteins precoated on coverslips (data not shown, see supplemental Figs. S2 and S3). To further elucidate the effect of EGFL on the differentiation of oligodendrocytes, we took advantage of the oligodendroglioma cell line OLN-93, which proliferates when cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum (Fig. 5A, panel a), but when maintained in DMEM culture medium with 0.5% fetal calf serum, cells are induced to differentiate morphologically (Fig. 5A, panel b) as previously observed (33van Meeteren M.E. Koetsier M.A. Dijkstra C.D. van Tol E.A. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 2005; 21: 78-86Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To test whether EGFL inhibits differentiation of these cells into mature oligodendrocytes, EGFL was added to the culture medium when it was changed from the 10% fetal calf serum supplement to the 0.5% fetal serum supplement. After 5 days in the presence of soluble EGFL the expression level of CNPase was tested by immunoblotting (Fig. 5B). In the presence of EGFL, CNPase expression was indeed reduced when compared with the PBS vehicle control and GST. The level CNPase expression in the presence of EGFL in 0.5% fetal calf serum was similar to the level of CNPase expression in 10% fetal calf serum (Fig. 5B). These observations support the interpretation that EGFL inhibits differentiation of progenitor cells into oligodendrocytes. β 1 Integrin Associates with EGFL and FN6-8—To investigate whether the effects seen with EGFL and FN6-8 on proliferation and differentiation were mediated by β 1 integrin, the cognate receptor for TN-R (34Probstmeier R. Michels M. Franz T. Chan B.M. Pesheva P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 2474-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 35Pesheva P. Probstmeier R. Skubitz A.P. McCarthy J.B. Furcht L.T. Schachner M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2323-2333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we first studied the expression of β 1 integrin by NSCs using immunocytochemistry. Neurospheres labeled with nestin and β 1 integrin antibody showed expression of β 1 integrin (Fig. 6A). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments using β 1 integrin antibodies on detergent lysates of adult rat brain showed association of β 1 integrin with TN-R (Fig. 6B). Pull-down experiments using Sepharose beads coated with GST-EGFL, GST-FN6-8, or GST showed that both EGFL and FN6-8 interact with β 1 integrin (Fig. 6C). FN6-8 Inhibits Proliferation of NSCs via β 1 Integrin—We then studied whether β 1 integrin mediates the inhibition of NSC proliferation by FN6-8. Single cell suspensions of NSCs were seeded onto glass coverslips precoated with poly-l-lysine and maintained in DMEM/F-12 culture medium supplemented with B27, FGF2, and EGF in the presence of FN6-8 (Fig. 7A) under the same conditions as shown for Fig. 2. In the absence of FN6-8 neither antibodies to β 1 integrin nor irrelevant rabbit IgG affected NSC proliferation when compared with the PBS vehicle control (Fig. 7B). In the presence of antibodies to β 1 integrin, the inhibition of proliferation of NSCs induced by FN6-8 was neutralized to control levels (Fig. 7B). These observations suggest that FN6-8 inhibits the proliferation of NSCs via β 1 integrin. EGFL and FN6-8 Influence NSC Differentiation via β 1 Integrin—We investigated whetherβ 1 integrin also mediates the effects of EGFL and FN6-8 on NSC differentiation using β 1 integrin blocking antibodies (Fig. 8). β 1 Integrin antibodies were added to the cultures of NSC monolayers as described in the legend to Fig. 3. Neurons were immunolabeled with antibodies to β-tubulin III and astrocytes with antibodies to GFAP (Fig. 8A). The percentage of neurons that was increased by EGFL in the absence of antibodies to β 1 integrin was reduced when β 1 integrin antibodies were applied in the presence of EGFL (Fig. 8B). Similarly, the reduction of differentiation of NSCs into β-tubulin III-positive cells in the presence of FN6-8 was neutralized to control levels in the presence of antibodies to β 1 integrin (Fig. 8B). Also, the reduction of differentiation into GFAP-positive cells by EGFL and enhancement of differentiation into astrocytes by FN6-8 was neutralized in the presence of antibodies to β 1 integrin (Fig. 8C). The effects of EGFL and FN6-8 on the differentiation of NSCs into oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and oligodendrocytes were also neutralized by antibodies to β 1 integrin (Fig. 9, A-C). These observations suggest that all effects induced by EGFL and FN6-8 with regard to differentiation into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes are mediated by β 1 integrin.FIGURE 9TN-R domains EGFL and FN6-8 affect differentiation of NSCs into oligodendrocytes viaβ1 integrin.

TN-R has been implicated in multiple cellular processes in the central nervous system. It already acts early in neural development in guidance of neural precursor cells of the subventricular zone and rostral migratory stream to engage in radial migration to the olfactory bulb, by its capacity as chemoattractant (7Jones F.S. Jones P.L. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 235-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 25Saghatelyan A. Chevigny A. Schachner M. Lledo P.M. Nat.

Development. 2004; 131: 3423-3432Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). TN-R is present in perineuronal nets, a feature that may be related to its capacity to bind to voltage-dependent Na+ channels and, by homology, also to voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (36Srinivasan J. Schachner M. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15753-15757Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 37Dityatev A. Brückner G. Dityateva G. Grosche J. Kleene R. Schachner M. Dev. Neurobiol. 2007; 67: 570-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). TN-R affects neurite outgrowth in a positive manner in vitro, when coated as a uniform substrate (10Lochter A. Schachner M. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3986-4000Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Xiao Z.C. Taylor J. Montag D. Rougon G. Schachner M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 766-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), but repels growth cones in boundary with a conductive substrate, such as laminin (29Schachner M. Taylor J. Bartsch U. Pesheva P. Perspect. Dev. Neurobiol. 1994; 2: 33-41PubMed Google Scholar, 38Taylor J. Pesheva P. Schachner M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 347-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). TN-R also influences oligodendrocyte and microglial adhesion and repulsion (14Liao H. Bu W.Y. Wang T.H. Ahmed S. Xiao Z.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8316-8323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 39Morganti M.C. Taylor J. Pesheva P. Schachner M. Exp. Neurol. 1990; 109: 98-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). TN-R acts as an intrinsic autocrine factor for oligodendrocyte differentiation and promotes cell adhesion by a sulfatide-mediated mechanism (40Pesheva P. Gloor S. Schachner M. Probstmeier R. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4642-4651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an observation that appears relevant with regard to the localization of TN-R at nodes of Ranvier where it accumulates after termination of the myelination process (6Bartsch U. Pesheva P. Raff M. Schachner M. Glia. 1993; 9: 957-969Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 41Wintergerst E.S. Fuss B. Bartsch U. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1993; 5: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The immunoglobulin superfamily and L1 family member contactin/F3, mainly expressed by neurons, has been described as a receptor for TN-R on neurons (11Xiao Z.C. Taylor J. Montag D. Rougon G. Schachner M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 766-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 12Xiao Z.C. Hillenbrand R. Schachenr M. Thermes S. Rougon G. Gomez S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 698-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 42Pesheva P. Gennarini G. Goridis C. Schachner M. Neuron. 1993; 10: 69-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). TN-R also interacts with chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans that are enriched in perineuronal nets surrounding subpopulations of inhibitory interneurons (43Brückner G. Grosche J. Schmidt S. Härtig W. Margolis R.U. Delpech B. Seidenbecher C.I. Czaniera R. Schachner M. J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 428: 616-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The involvement of these different receptors and binding partners for TN-R in mediating its functional properties has, however, remained largely unexplored. Furthermore, the question as to which domains of this multifunctional molecule are involved in distinct functions and which are the receptors for these domains are not known. We have investigated one aspect of TN-R function with regard to the differentiation of NSCs in vitro by focusing on the differential functions of the two major domains of this molecule, namely EGFL and FN6-8, which have previously been shown to be functionally predominant and diversely acting domains (11Xiao Z.C. Taylor J. Montag D. Rougon G. Schachner M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 766-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 12Xiao Z.C. Hillenbrand R. Schachenr M. Thermes S. Rougon G. Gomez S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 698-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 14Liao H. Bu W.Y. Wang T.H. Ahmed S. Xiao Z.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8316-8323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 28Lochter A. Vaughan L. Kaplony A. Prochiantz A. Schachner M. Faissner A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1159-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The two domains affect the functional status of NSCs in distinct ways: proliferation is reduced by FN6-8, whereas differentiation into neurons is enhanced and reduced by FN6-8 at the expense of differentiation into astrocytes in a complementary manner; and the enhancement of differentiation into neurons leads to a reduction in differentiation into astrocytes. Vice versa, FN6-8 reduces differentiation into neurons, but enhances differentiation into astrocytes. Similar effects of EGFL and FN6-8 were observed in maintenance of progenitor cells at the expense of differentiated cells in the presence of EGFL, being counteracted by FN6-8. Interestingly, embryonic stem cells transfected to overexpress TN-R as a full-length molecule enhance differentiation of precursor cells into neurons as measured in a quinolinic acid excitotoxic lesion paradigm in the adult mouse (44Hargus G. Cui Y. Schmid J.S. Xu J. Glatzel M. Schachner M. Bernreuther C. Stem Cells. 2008; 26: 1973-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). All these functions appear to be mediated by β 1 integrin, which is well expressed by NSCs. Both EGFL and FN6-8 interact with β 1 integrin on all three cell types, namely neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, proliferation of NSCs influenced by FN6-8 is mediated by β 1 integrin. The question now arises how β 1 integrin can mediate such diverse effects on NSCs. We can speculate that different α-subunits associating with β 1 integrins could be one possibility. Another possibility is that the same α/β integrin pair interacts with distinct cell surface receptors in the plasma membrane of one cell. Candidates for such interactions are the immunoglobulin superfamily adhesion molecule L1, the close homolog of L1 (CHL1), CD9, sulfatide, and others. The combinational variations in such receptor agglomerations may thus determine signal transduction mechanisms, alternately influencing the proliferative state and differentiation of NSCs. The question remains how such differences arise in a progenitor population that is homogeneous in its expression pattern. Whether this homogeneity is indeed high is questionable, and we thus assume that small, yet decisive heterogeneity in cell populations exist in the progenitor pool that influences the susceptibility to different ligands, such as EGFL and FN6-8 on the basis of the receptor combination at the cell surface of the progenitor populations. The investigation of this question and a better understanding of the signal transduction mechanisms of a possibly heterogeneous progenitor population should prove useful in controlling stem cell behavior in specific areas of the central nervous system and should offer further hopes for manipulating progenitor cells for transplantation in the treatment of central nervous system disorders.

https://openalex.org/W2003631389,"To explore rearrangements of the reentrant loop HP2 relative to transmembrane domains (TMs) 7 and 8 during transport by the glial glutamate transporter GLT-1/EAAT2, cysteine pairs were introduced at the extracellular ends of these structural elements. The pairs were introduced around 10–15Å “above” the residues, which make contact with substrate in the related archaeal homologue GltPh. Transport by the double mutants M449C/L466C (HP2/TM 8), L453C/I463C (HP2/TM 8), and I411C/I463C (TM 7/TM 8) was inhibited by copper(II)(1,10-phenanthroline)3 (CuPh) and by Cd2+. Inhibition was only observed when the two cysteines were present in the same construct, but not with the respective single cysteine mutants or when only one cysteine was paired with a mutation to another residue. Glutamate and potassium, both expected to increase the proportion of inward-facing transporters, significantly protected against the inhibition of transport activity of M449C/L466C by CuPh. The non-transportable analogues kainate and d, l-threo-β-benzyloxyaspartate are expected to stabilize an outward-facing conformation, but only the latter potentiated the effect of CuPh on M449C/L466C. However, both analogues increased the aqueous accessibility of the cysteines introduced at positions 449 and 466 to a membrane-impermeant sulfhydryl reagent. Inhibition of L453C/I463C by CuPh was protected not only by glutamate but also by the two analogues. In contrast, these ligands had very little effect on the inhibition of I411C/I463C by CuPh. Our results are consistent with the proposal that HP2 serves as the extracellular gate of the transporter and indicate that glutamate and the two analogues induce distinct conformations of HP2.

Many neurotransmitters are removed from the synaptic cleft by transporters, which thereby enable efficient synaptic transmission. Many of these transporters belong to the neurotransmitter:sodium:symporter (NSS) family and are sodium- and chloride-dependent. The notable exception is the small family of transporters of glutamate, the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. Glutamate transporters are essential in preventing hyperexcitability and neurotoxicity. Glutamate transport is an electrogenic process (1Kanner B.I. Sharon I.

The mechanism, involving two half-cycles (Fig. 1A), is supported by the fact that mutants impaired in potassium interaction are locked in an obligatory exchange mode (8Kavanaugh M.P. Bendahan A.

Under physiological conditions, the transporter accumulates the transmitter into the cell against its concentration gradient (1Kanner B.I. Sharon I.

Thus, an increase in the proportion of transporters in the inward facing conformation, where the binding site is exposed to the cytoplasm, is expected in the presence of either high extracellular potassium or l-glutamate (Fig. 1A). On the other hand, addition of non-transportable glutamate analogues (Fig. 1B) is expected to stabilize an outward-facing conformation (where the binding site is exposed to the extracellular medium) of the transporter (Fig. 1A). A crystal structure of the archaeal glutamate transporter homologue GltPh has been published (11Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). It forms a trimer with a permeation pathway through each of the monomers, indicating that the monomer is the functional unit. This is also the case for the eukaryotic glutamate transporters (12Koch H.P. Larsson H.P. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1730-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 13Grewer C. Balani P.

The membrane topology of the monomer is quite unusual (11Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E.

TMs 1–6 form the outer shell of the transporter monomer, whereas TMs 7 and 8 and the reentrant loops form the binding pocket of GltPh (11Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E.

Satisfactorily, the side-chains of most of the counterparts of the eukaryotic transporter residues, inferred to be important for the interaction of sodium (19Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Physiol. 2007; 129: 527-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), are facing toward the binding pocket of GltPh (11Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that reentrant loop HP2 may form the external gate of the transporter (11Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar), and recent support for this idea has been obtained when the crystal structure of GltPh in complex with the non-transportable analogue d,l-threo-β-benzoylaspartate (TBOA) was solved (23Boudker O. Ryan R.M. Yernool D. Shimamoto K. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 445: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). In the presence of sodium, the overall structure of GltPh was found to be similar in the aspartate-bound, TBOA-bound, and substrate-depleted structures, except that in the latter two, HP2 adopts an “open” conformation (23Boudker O. Ryan R.M. Yernool D. Shimamoto K. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 445: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). transmembrane domain dithiothreitol copper(II)(1,10-phenanthroline)3 (2-trimethylammonium) methanethiosulfonate wild type hairpin loop d,l-threo-β-benzoylaspartate. transmembrane domain dithiothreitol copper(II)(1,10-phenanthroline)3 (2-trimethylammonium) methanethiosulfonate wild type hairpin loop d,l-threo-β-benzoylaspartate. Here we use oxidative cross-linking of engineered cysteine pairs to explore the idea that HP2 moves relative to TMs 7 and 8 during transport in the eukaryotic transporters. Such cross-linking often results in the inhibition of transport (24Brocke L. Bendahan A. Grunewald M. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3985-3992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 25Zomot E. Zhou Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol.

Chem. 2006; 281: 29788-29796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The inhibition may be due to restrictions imposed by the disulfide cross-link on the conformational changes, which the transporter undergoes during a transport cycle or may be the result of a steric barrier or another distortion introduced by the cross-link. We have introduced cysteine pairs at the extracellular ends of these structural elements of the glial glutamate transporter GLT-1 (27Pines G. Danbolt N.C. Bjoras M. Zhang Y. Bendahan A. Eide L. Koepsell H. Storm-Mathisen J. Seeberg E. Kanner B.I. Nature. 1992; 360: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar), also known as EAAT2 (28Arriza J.L. Fairman W.A. Wadiche J.I. Murdoch G.H. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5559-5569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), at positions located around 10–15 Å “above” (closer to the extracellular medium; as opposed to “below”, closer to the cytoplasm) the residues that make contact with aspartate and TBOA in GltPh (23Boudker O. Ryan R.M. Yernool D. Shimamoto K. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 445: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D). The double mutants were subjected to conditions of oxidative cross-linking in the presence and absence of transporter ligands. In parallel we have examined the effects of these ligands on the reactivity/accessibility of the individual cysteines to the membrane-impermeant sulfhydryl reagent MTSET. Generation and Subcloning of Mutants—Mutations were made by site-directed mutagenesis of wild-type (WT) GLT-1 or its cysteine-less version (16Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) in the vector pBluescript SK(–) (Stratagene) using single-stranded uracil-containing DNA as described previously (29Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4557) Google Scholar, 30Kleinberger-Doron N. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3063-3067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the GLT-1-containing plasmid was used to transform Escherichia coli CJ236 (dut–, ung–). From one of the transformants, single-stranded uracil-containing DNA was isolated upon growth in uridine-containing medium, according to the standard protocol from Stratagene, using helper phage R408. This yields the sense strand, and consequently mutagenic primers were designed to be antisense. The mutants were subcloned into constructs containing either WT or cysteine-less GLT-1 in the vector pBluescript SK(–), using the unique restriction enzymes BsrGI or BsgI and XbaI. The coding and non-coding strands were sequenced between the above restriction sites. Cell Growth and Expression—HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 200 units/ml penicillin, 200 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Infection with recombinant vaccinia/T7 virus vTF7-3 (31Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1871) Google Scholar) and subsequent transfection with plasmid DNA, as well as d-[3H]aspartate transport, was done as published previously (32Pines G. Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17093-17097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In all the experiments described, the expression vector was pBluescript SK(–). Inhibition Studies with the Impermeant Sulfhydryl Reagent MTSET—Before transport measurements, cells adhering to 24-well plates were washed two times with 1 ml of the transport medium containing 150 mm choline chloride instead of NaCl. Each well was then incubated at room temperature with 200 μl of the preincubation medium (the different compositions are indicated in the figure legends) with the indicated concentrations of MTSET (Anathrace, Inc). After 5 min, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed twice with 1 ml of the transport solution, followed by d-[3H]aspartate transport. The concentration of MTSET chosen in the different experiments was determined after preliminary titration experiments, optimized not only according to the experimental conditions but also to the mutants used. This was necessary because some mutants are more sensitive than others. The MTSET concentrations used are given in the figure legends. Statistical evaluation of the inhibition of the different mutants by MTSET (or either CuPh or Cd2+) utilized a one-way analysis of variance with a post-hoc Dunnett multiple comparison test, where p < 0.05 or smaller was taken as significant. Results were plotted using normalized data for each mutant, where the untreated activity levels are normalized to 100%. Inhibition by Copper(II)(1,10-Phenanthroline)3—This was basically done as described (24Brocke L. Bendahan A. Grunewald M. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3985-3992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 25Zomot E. Zhou Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25512-25516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). HeLa cells transfected with the indicated construct were washed once with choline solution (150 mm choline chloride, 5 mm KPi, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm MgSO4, and 0.3 mm CaCl2) and preincubated with the solutions of different compositions containing the indicated concentrations of CuPh. Again, the optimal concentration of CuPh for each double mutant was determined by preliminary titration experiments. The CuPh stock solution was prepared for each experiment by mixing 0.4 ml of 1.25 m 1,10-phenanthroline in water: ethanol (1:1) and 0.6 ml of 250 mm CuSO4. Inhibition by Cd2+—HeLa cells transfected with the indicated construct were washed once with choline solution, and the cells were assayed for transport with the indicated concentrations of cadmium chloride in sodium solution (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KPi, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm MgSO4, and 0.3 mm CaCl2) for 10 min at room temperature (24Brocke L. Bendahan A. Grunewald M. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3985-3992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Effects of Thiol Cross-linking and Cd2+ on M449C/L466C-GLT-1—To identify positions in HP2 and TM8, which are potentially close to each other, we used the GltPh structure (11Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar) and a model where the GltPh residues were replaced by their GLT-1 counterparts (using the SPDB Viewer). We identified several pairs of HP2 and TM8 residues that are close in space. Cysteine residues were introduced at these paired positions not only in the Cys-less GLT-1 construct, but also in WT-GLT-1. The latter was done because with the two cysteine pairs, identified by us prior to the publication of the GltPh structure (11Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 23Boudker O. Ryan R.M. Yernool D. Shimamoto K. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 445: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), transport activity was only observed when these pairs were introduced in WT (24Brocke L. Bendahan A. Grunewald M. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3985-3992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The same situation was observed with the M449C/L466C double mutant, which was devoid of activity in the Cys-less GLT-1 background, but exhibited measurable activity in the background of the WT transporter; 14.4 ± 0.6% of that of WT (n = 3). Surface biotinylation experiments showed that the lack of activity of M449C/L466C in the Cys-less GLT-1 background was due to defective maturation and a defective targeting of the double mutant transporter to the plasma membrane (data not shown). According to the model based on the GltPh structure (11Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar), the distance between the sulfhydryl groups introduced at these positions is 6.6 Å. When HeLa cells, expressing M449C/L466C, were preincubated with the oxidizing agent CuPh (10 μm), a significant inhibition of transport was observed (Fig. 2A). This inhibition was not seen with cells expressing either WT or the single cysteine mutants M449C and L466C (Fig. 2A), indicating that the inhibition of transport by oxidative cross-linking required a cysteine at both positions. No inhibition of transport by 10 μm CuPh was observed when only one cysteine was paired with a mutation to another residue, namely M449C/L466A and M449A/L466C (Fig. 2A). Therefore, it is unlikely that mutation of Met-449 or Leu-466 to a smaller residue has caused the cysteine introduced at either position to become closer to one of the endogenous cysteines of GLT-1. The inhibition by CuPh was only observed when the cysteines at positions 449 and 466 were present on the same polypeptide, but not when the two cysteines resided on two different polypeptides. This was demonstrated by the lack of inhibition by CuPh of transport in cells cotransfected with M449C and L466C (Fig. 2A). This suggests that the cysteines at positions 449 and 466 come into close proximity within the transporter monomer, but not at the interface of two transporter monomers. In contrast to previously characterized double cysteine mutants A412C/V427C (Fig. 1D) and A364C/S440C (tips of HP1 and HP2, respectively) (24Brocke L. Bendahan A. Grunewald M. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3985-3992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the inhibition of M449C/L466C by CuPh could not be reversed by subsequent incubation of the cells with 20 mm DTT (data not shown). This suggests that the disulfide bond gets occluded upon oxidation of the transporter by compensatory shifting of other parts of the protein. At present, it is not clear what the nature of the underlying conformational change is. Independent evidence for proximity of the two cysteines comes from their ability to form a Cd2+ binding site. This divalent cation interacts with cysteinyl side chains (33Perez-Garcia M.T. Chiamvimonvat N. Marban E. Tomaselli G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 34Glusker J.P. Adv Protein Chem. 1991; 42: 1-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the affinity of the interaction is dramatically increased when the Cd2+ can be coordinated by two cysteines (35Benitah J.P. Tomaselli G.F. Marban E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7392-7396Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Inhibition of transport by 500 μm Cd2+ was observed with M449C/L466C, but not with WT, the single cysteine mutants or with the M449C/L466A and M449A/L466C double mutants (Fig. 2B). No inhibition of transport by Cd2+ was observed in HeLa cells cotransfected with M449C and L466C (Fig. 2B). In contrast to treatment with Cd2+, the reaction with CuPh results in the formation of a covalent bond. Therefore it is possible to determine the effect of the external medium on the cross-linking during the pretreatment of the cells with CuPh. When during pretreatment of cells expressing M449C/L466C sodium was replaced by lithium or choline, there was not much change in the extent of inhibition by CuPh (Fig. 3A). However, when sodium was replaced by potassium, a condition expected to increase the proportion of inward-facing transporters (Fig. 1A), a marked reduction in the degree of inhibition by CuPh was observed (Fig. 3A). A similar protection was also observed with l-glutamate (1 mm) (Fig. 3A), another condition expected to increase the proportion of inward-facing transporters (Fig. 1A). The protection by l-glutamate was not seen in the absence of sodium (choline replacement; data not shown) and was not observed with GABA or glycine, which are not substrates of GLT-1 (data not shown). The non-transportable substrate analogues kainate and d,l-TBOA are both expected to increase the proportion of outward-facing transporters (Fig. 1A). Remarkably, these blockers had different effects on the inhibition of transport of M449C/L466C by CuPh; d,l-TBOA caused a clear potentiation of this inhibition, but kainate had no significant effect (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, not only d,l-TBOA, but also kainate, potentiated the inhibition of the M449C and of the L466C mutants by the membrane-impermeable sulfhydryl reagent MTSET, whereas l-glutamate had the opposite effect (Fig. 3, B and C). In these experiments the cysteine mutations were present in the background of Cys-less GLT-1, but similar results were also obtained when the mutations were present in the background of WT-GLT-1 (data not shown). No inhibition by MTSET was observed with the M449A or L466A mutants (data not shown). As compared with lithium and choline, sodium had a protective effect on the inhibition of M449C by MTSET, whereas potassium did not have much of an effect (Fig. 3B). The inhibition of L466C by MTSET was more pronounced in the presence of either sodium or lithium than in the presence of choline (Fig. 3C). Altogether the results presented in this section indicate that kainate does not simply change the accessibility of positions 449 and 466, but also induces a repositioning between them. Effects of Thiol Cross-linking and Cd2+ on L453C/I463C—CuPh (10 μm) also inhibited transport of the paired mutant L453C/I463C (HP2/TM 8) (background of WT), and this inhibition was not seen with the individual cysteine mutants. However, significant inhibition was observed with the L453C/I463S and L453S/I463C mutants: 48.2 ± 2.1% and 41.8 ± 5.6% activity remained after treatment with 10 μm CuPh, respectively, compared with 15.1 ± 2.3% for L453C/I463C (n = 3). This suggests that the introduction of a smaller residue at position 453 or 463 may allosterically promote the cross-linking of the cysteine introduced at the other position with one or more of the cysteines endogenous to WT-GLT-1. However, in contrast to M449C/L466C, low but significant transport activity was observed with the L453C/I463C mutant in the Cys-less background, 13.2 ± 1.2% of that of Cys-less GLT-1 (n = 3). CuPh (10 μm) inhibited transport by the double mutant but not that of Cys-less GLT-1 (Fig. 4A). Two additional double mutants were made in the background of Cys-less GLT-1, L453S/I463C, and L453C/I463S. The activity of the former was only around 1% of that of Cys-less GLT-1 and could not be studied further. The activity of L453C/I463S was 4.4 ± 0.3% of that of Cys-less GLT-1 (n = 3), and this activity was almost insensitive to treatment with 10 μm CuPh with 91.6 ± 2.4% of the activity remaining (n = 3). In contrast to M449C/L466C, the inhibition of transport of L453C/I463C by CuPh could be reversed by a subsequent incubation with 20 mm DTT (data not shown). Again, inhibition was not observed with the single cysteine mutants whether expressed individually or together (Fig. 4A). Similarly, inhibition of transport by Cd2+ was observed only with the double cysteine mutant and only when the two cysteines were introduced in the same construct (Fig. 4B). The effects of transporter ligands on the inhibition of L453C/I463C by CuPh (Fig. 5A) were different than those on M449C/L466C (Fig. 3A). Although potassium also protected against inhibition of transport of L453C/I463C by CuPh, a significant protection was also seen when sodium was replaced by choline and to some extent also by lithium (Fig. 5A). Therefore the effect of potassium on L453C/I463C does not seem to be related with the ability of this ion to increase the proportion of inward-facing transporters (Fig. 1A). In further contrast with M449C/L466C (Fig. 3A), not only l-glutamate but also d,l-TBOA and kainate protected against the inhibition of L453C/I463C by CuPh (Fig. 5A), but GABA and glycine had no effect (data not shown). Except for the effect of lithium, the effects of other ligands on the accessibility of L453C to MTSET, were similar to those observed on the inhibition of transport by L453C/I463C by CuPh, regardless if the cysteine mutation was introduced in Cys-less GLT-1 (Fig. 5B) or in WT-GLT-1 (data not shown). The reactivity to MTSET of the cysteine introduced at position 463, was only modestly affected by transporter ligands and only glutamate, d,l-TBOA and kainate afforded some protection (Fig. 5C). Previously, l-glutamate and kainate were also shown to protect against the inhibition of transport of A412C/V427C (TM 7/HP2) by CuPh (24Brocke L. Bendahan A. Grunewald M. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3985-3992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A similar protective effect was also observed with d,l-TBOA (Fig. 6). Thus, in contrast to M449C/L466C, TBOA and kainate have similar effects on oxidative cross-linking in L453C/I463C and in A412C/V427C. Effects of Thiol Cross-linking and Cd2+ on I411C/I463C—To explore the possibility of movement of TM7 relative to TM8, we used the model to find residues at the extracellular ends of these domains, predicted to be in close proximity to each other. We identified one active double cysteine mutant that was inhibited by CuPh, namely I411C/I463C. The activity of seven other TM7/TM8 double mutants, with cysteines inserted at positions predicted to be close in space, was not inhibited by CuPh (see legend to Fig. 7). Except for I411C/D462C and I411C/S464C, the activity of the five other pairs was sensitive to MTSET. However, preincubation of these five double mutants with CuPh did not protect against MTSET, rendering unlikely the possibility that in these cases CuPh mediated cross-linking without inactivation. I411C/I463C was active only in the background of WT-GLT-1, but not in that of Cys-less GLT-1 (data not shown). Just as was the case with M449C/L466C, the lack of activity of I411C/I463C in the Cys-less"
https://openalex.org/W1976485291,"In the medullary thick ascending limb, inhibiting the basolateral NHE1 Na(+)/H(+) exchanger with nerve growth factor (NGF) induces actin cytoskeleton remodeling that secondarily inhibits apical NHE3 and transepithelial HCO(3)(-) absorption. The inhibition by NGF is mediated 50% through activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Here we examined the signaling pathway responsible for the remainder of the NGF-induced inhibition. Inhibition of HCO(3)(-) absorption was reduced 45% by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors wortmannin or LY294002 and 50% by rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a downstream effector of PI3K. The combination of a PI3K inhibitor plus rapamycin did not cause a further reduction in the inhibition by NGF. In contrast, the combination of a PI3K inhibitor plus the MEK/ERK inhibitor U0126 completely eliminated inhibition by NGF. Rapamycin decreased NGF-induced inhibition of basolateral NHE1 by 45%. NGF induced a 2-fold increase in phosphorylation of Akt, a PI3K target linked to mTOR activation, and a 2.2-fold increase in the activity of p70 S6 kinase, a downstream effector of mTOR. p70 S6 kinase activation was blocked by wortmannin and rapamycin, consistent with PI3K, mTOR, and p70 S6 kinase in a linear pathway. Rapamycin-sensitive inhibition of NHE1 by NGF was associated with an increased level of phosphorylated mTOR in the basolateral membrane domain. These findings indicate that NGF inhibits HCO(3)(-) absorption in the medullary thick ascending limb through the parallel activation of PI3K-mTOR and ERK signaling pathways, which converge to inhibit NHE1. The results identify a role for mTOR in the regulation of Na(+)/H(+) exchange activity and implicate NHE1 as a possible downstream effector contributing to mTOR's effects on cell growth, proliferation, survival, and tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2084874982,"Vitronectin and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) are proteins that interact in the circulatory system and pericellular region to regulate fibrinolysis, cell adhesion, and migration. The interactions between the two proteins have been attributed primarily to binding of the somatomedin B (SMB) domain, which comprises the N-terminal 44 residues of vitronectin, to the flexible joint region of PAI-1, including residues Arg-103, Met-112, and Gln-125 of PAI-1. A strategy for deletion mutagenesis that removes the SMB domain demonstrates that this mutant form of vitronectin retains PAI-1 binding (Schar, C. R., Blouse, G. E., Minor, K. M., and Peterson, C. B. (2008) J. Biol. Chem. 283, 10297–10309). In the current study, the complementary binding site on PAI-1 was mapped by testing for the ability of a battery of PAI-1 mutants to bind to the engineered vitronectin lacking the SMB domain. This approach identified a second, separate site for interaction between vitronectin and PAI-1. The binding of PAI-1 to this site was defined by a set of mutations in PAI-1 distinct from the mutations that disrupt binding to the SMB domain. Using the mutations in PAI-1 to map the second site suggested interactions between α-helices D and E in PAI-1 and a site in vitronectin outside of the SMB domain. The affinity of this second interaction exhibited a KD value ∼100-fold higher than that of the PAI-1-somatomedin B interaction. In contrast to the PAI-1-somatomedin B binding, the second interaction had almost the same affinity for active and latent PAI-1. We hypothesize that, together, the two sites form an extended binding area that may promote assembly of higher order vitronectin-PAI-1 complexes.

Vitronectin is a circulatory protein that interacts with several other plasma components that regulate coagulation and fibrinolysis, cell lysis via the complement cascade, and cell binding and migration in an integrin-dependent and urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor-dependent fashion (1Ekmekci O.B.

An interaction with vitronectin that has been widely studied occurs with the serine protease inhibitor (or serpin), PAI-1, 2The abbreviations used are: PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1; RCL, reactive center loop; rΔsBVN, recombinant vitronectin lacking the SMB domain due to a deletion of residues 1–40; SMB, somatomedin B; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; tPA, tissue-type plasminogen activator; mAb, monoclonal antibody; RU, response unit(s). the primary inhibitor of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA). Most circulating PAI-1 is found in a complex with vitronectin (3Declerck P.J. De Mol M. Alessi M.C. Baudner S. Paques E.P. Preissner K.T. Muller-Berghaus G. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15454-15461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of the complex between vitronectin and PAI-1 is presumed to be physiologically significant in several respects. Binding of vitronectin to PAI-1 stabilizes the active conformation of the serpin, increasing the half-life for its conversion to the inactive, so-called latent state, and maintains its protease inhibitory properties for a prolonged period (4Lindahl T.L. Sigurdardottir O. Wiman B. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1989; 62: 748-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 5Wun T.C. Palmier M.O. Siegel N.R. Smith C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7862-7868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PAI-1 binds to the N-terminal ∼50-amino acid somatomedin B (SMB) domain of vitronectin. The binding of PAI-1 competes with the binding of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor to this domain and with the binding of integrins to the adjacent RGD sequence (for a review, see Ref. 6Durand M.K.

The conversion of PAI-1 to its inactive, latent form results from repositioning of the RCL, whereby it becomes incorporated as a sixth strand in the central β-sheet, and the overall fold of the protein adopts a structure that is more thermodynamically favored (17Baker D. Agard D.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7505-7509Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The identification of the primary binding site for vitronectin on PAI-1 as the flexible joint region, localized in an area defined by s2A, hE, and hF and comprising, among others, residues Arg-103, Met-112, and Gln-125 (18Jensen J.K.

By binding to this flexible joint region at the “base” of central β-sheet A, vitronectin opposes expansion of the β-sheet, which is required to accommodate the RCL as a sixth strand. In this way, the active conformation of PAI-1 is stabilized by vitronectin. Besides this purely steric effect, other evidence suggests that the SMB domain induces extensive conformational changes in PAI-1 (24Gibson A. Baburaj K. Day D.E. Verhamme I. Shore J.D. Peterson C.B.

A co-crystal of a recombinant SMB domain and PAI-1 has provided useful information about the intermolecular contacts made in this complex (15Zhou A. Huntington J.A. Pannu N.S. Carrell R.W. Read R.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The PAI-1-binding site within the SMB domain is mostly limited to a single-turn α-helix, the only recognizable secondary structural element in this small disulfide-rich domain (15Zhou A.

Chem. 2008; 283: 10297-10309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that a deletion mutant of vitronectin lacking the SMB domain retains PAI-1 binding activity, although with a reduced affinity. These data suggest that PAI-1 should contain a second vitronectin-binding site to provide the needed complementary interactions required for binding to vitronectin outside of the SMB domain. To test this idea, the deletion mutant of vitronectin lacking the SMB domain (rΔsBVN (32Schar C.R. Blouse G.E. Minor K.H. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10297-10309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar)) was used to screen for binding to a battery of PAI-1 mutants. The results define a second vitronectin-binding site on PAI-1 that is distinct from the SMB-binding site, both in location and binding properties, although it is localized close to the SMB-binding site. Key questions to be addressed regarding the significance of this other binding site include the following. Where is the second site located relative to the flexible joint region of PAI-1? Does binding of vitronectin to this site stabilize the active conformation of PAI-1? How do the kinetics of binding to the second site compare with the binding to the SMB domain? Materials—Native vitronectin was purified from human plasma using a modified protocol of the method developed by Dahlbäck and Podack (33Bittorf S.V. Williams E.C. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24838-24846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Dahlbäck B. Podack E.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2368-2374Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). A recombinant form of vitronectin lacking the somatomedin B domain (rΔsBVN) was expressed in the baculovirus FastBac system and purified as described (32Schar C.R. Blouse G.E. Minor K.H. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10297-10309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). PAI-1 was produced according to the method outlined by Jensen et al. (21Jensen J.K. Wind T. Andreasen P.A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 521: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The numbering used to denote the amino acid positions in PAI-1 throughout the present work is Ser-1—Ala-2—Val-3—His-4—His-5, according to Andreasen et al. (35Andreasen P.A. Riccio A. Welinder K.G. Douglas R. Sartorio R. Nielsen L.S. Oppenheimer C. Blasi F. Dano K. FEBS Lett. 1986; 209: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Latent PAI-1 was generated by incubating PAI-1 in running buffer for 7 days at 25 °C at a concentration of 5 μm. Incubation with uPA followed by SDS-PAGE to test for covalent, inactive serpin-uPA complexes was used to assay for PAI-1 activity and conversion to the latent form over time. Two versions of the SMB domain were used. One form (residues 1–51) was purified from a cyanogen bromide digest of human vitronectin as described (26Mayasundari A. Whittemore N.A. Serpersu E.H. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29359-29366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Another form (residues 1–47) was produced as a recombinant protein in Pichia pastoris and was a kind gift from Michael Ploug (Finsen Laboratory, Copenhagen, Denmark). The two forms are functionally and structurally indistinguishable (29Kjaergaard M. Gardsvoll H. Hirschberg D. Nielbo S. Mayasundari A. Peterson C.B. Jansson A. Jørgensen T.J. Poulsen F. Ploug M. Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 1934-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). All other reagents were of analytical reagent grade or better. Assay for Rate of Conversion of PAI-1 to a Latent Form—The assay for measuring the rate at which PAI-1 converts to the latent form was performed as described (18Jensen J.K. Durand M.K. Skeldal S. Dupont D.M. Bodker J.S. Wind T. Andreasen P.A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 556: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). PAI-1 (10 μg/ml final concentration) and vitronectin (2-fold molar excess over PAI-1) were incubated at 37 °C in HEPES-buffered saline with 0.25% gelatin. At various time points over a period of 2.5 h, samples were withdrawn for determination of the specific inhibitory activity of PAI-1 by titration against a fixed concentration of uPA. The PAI-1 activity was plotted as a function of incubation time, and the functional half-life of PAI-1 was calculated by fitting the data to a simple exponential decay. Analysis of PAI-1 Binding to rΔsBVN and Full-length Vitronectin by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)—For matters of convenience with multiple instruments in the various laboratories, SPR experiments for analysis of binding of PAI-1 variants to rΔsBVN or full-length vitronectin were performed on a Biacore X™, Biacore 3000™, or Biacore T100™ instrument equipped with CM5™ chips. There were no discernable differences between the results obtained by the three instruments. The running buffer used contained 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% Tween-20, and 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000. All solutions were filtered and degassed prior to use in the SPR experiments. Full-length vitronectin or rΔsBVN was coupled directly to the surface of a CM5™ chip with the standard amine coupling protocol. A solution of 30 μg/ml rΔsBVN or vitronectin in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, was injected for coupling until the desired density was achieved. (Note that higher or lower densities of protein were coupled strategically to measure equilibrium saturation binding or determine kinetics for on- and off-rates.) Ethanolamine-blocked empty flow cells were used as reference. When necessary, regeneration of the flow cells between runs was achieved by injecting pulses of 10 mm glycine/HCl, pH 2.0, and/or 0.05% SDS in running buffer until base-line levels were acquired. To determine the affinity of PAI-1 binding to full-length vitronectin or rΔsBVN, samples of PAI-1 diluted in running buffer were injected into an array of concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 1500 nm at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. After discontinuation of injection, the dissociation reaction was followed for a period of time. Rate constants for association (kon) and dissociation (koff) and equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) were determined in one of three ways. In most cases, the constants were determined by fitting the data to a 1:1 binding model using of the Biacore software. In other cases, koff values were first determined manually from the time courses of dissociation using the Biacore software. The calculated koff values, evaluated over a concentration range of 10 to 250 nm PAI-1, were shown to be concentration-independent, as expected for dissociation of the complex. The kon values were determined by following the association phase at different PAI-1 concentrations. In either case, the apparent association rate constants (kon,app) were determined by a fit (global with the Biacore software package or individual curve first for the manual data treatment) to Equation 1, [bound PAI−1]=A×(1−exp((−kon,app)×t))(Eq. 1) where A is the steady state level. The true kon values were then determined from Equation 2. kon=(kon,app−koff)/[PAI−1](Eq. 2) The equilibrium dissociation constant, KD, was then calculated as koff/kon. Finally, in some cases the association and dissociation rates were too fast to be determined. In these cases, the KD values were calculated according to the method outlined by Rich and Myszka (36Rich R.L. Myszka D.G. J. Mol. Recognit. 2001; 14: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) for use of SPR in an equilibrium binding approach. The steady state binding values were plotted against the PAI-1 concentration and fit by nonlinear least squares to the equation, R=Rmax(CKD)1+CKD(Eq. 3) where R is the observed response, Rmax is the maximal response, C is the analyte concentration, and KD is the equilibrium dissociation constant. To form the SMB domain-PAI-1 complexes, varying molar ratios of native SMB to a fixed concentration of active or latent PAI-1 (0.7 μm) were incubated for 30 min at room temperature before injection at a flow rate of 20 μl/min over either monomeric vitronectin or rΔsBVN. For the monoclonal antibody blocking experiments, the antibodies were incubated with PAI-1 at 1:1 and 1:3 (PAI-1:antibody) molar ratios for 10 min at room temperature in running buffer. After this incubation period, the sample was injected at a flow rate of 20 μl/min over immobilized rΔsBVN. The Deletion Mutant of Vitronectin Lacking the SMB Domain Does Not Stabilize the Active Conformation of PAI-1—One of the key consequences of vitronectin binding to PAI-1 is stabilization of the active serpin, with its RCL exposed and poised to act as bait for target proteases. The structural details of this stabilizing interaction have been attributed to binding of PAI-1 to the SMB domain of vitronectin (15Zhou A. Huntington J.A. Pannu N.S. Carrell R.W. Read R.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 37Seiffert D. Ciambrone G. Wagner N.V. Binder B.R. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol.

The intrinsic rate of conversion of wild-type PAI-1 in the absence and presence of added full-length vitronectin or rΔsBVN was measured by monitoring inhibition of uPA over time. In isolation, PAI-1 exhibits a half-life of 67 ± 3 min (n = 15) for conversion to the latent, inactive form. Full-length vitronectin stabilizes the serpin, increasing the half-life of the active form to 121 ± 17 min (n = 12, p = 0.0001), whereas the deletion mutant appears to have no effect on PAI-1, which exhibits a half-life of 75 ± 30 min (n = 8) in the presence of added rΔsBVN (p = 0.013). Comparison of Binding of PAI-1 to rΔsBVN and Full-length Vitronectin—The binding of PAI-1 to either full-length vitronectin or rΔsBVN was followed using SPR. Initial experiments designed to detect weaker PAI-1-vitronectin interactions were performed with high PAI-1 concentrations (400 nm) and a high density of vitronectin or the rΔsBVN variant on the chip. The sensorgrams of active and latent PAI-1 binding to either vitronectin or rΔsBVN are shown in Fig. 1. The data in Fig. 1, top panel, with immobilized full-length vitronectin confirm the substantially weaker binding that latent PAI-1 exhibits for full-length vitronectin and clarify kinetic contributions to the overall low affinity of the interaction. Although the association phase with latent PAI-1 shows interaction with vitronectin, dissociation occurs at a high rate (t½ ∼ 10 s), yielding an overall weak affinity (Fig. 1, top panel, dashed line). The binding behavior is clearly different with active PAI-1, which exhibits a slow off-rate in the dissociation phase of the sensorgram (Fig. 1, top panel, solid line). SPR experiments with active and latent PAI-1 confirmed that both forms of PAI-1 bind to rΔsBVN (Fig. 1, bottom panel); latent wild-type PAI-1 binds rΔsBVN slightly more weakly, with an approximate 20% reduction in the steady state level compared with active PAI-1. Nevertheless, the differences between association and dissociation kinetics with rΔsBVN immobilized on the chip are not nearly as marked as those observed in the case of full-length vitronectin. Notably, the dissociation phases are quite rapid for both active and latent forms of PAI-1, with half-lives around 5 s, akin to the dissociation kinetics observed with latent PAI-1 binding to full-length vitronectin and clearly different from the very slow dissociation of active PAI-1 from full-length vitronectin. Analysis of the Binding of Active and Latent PAI-1 to rΔsBVN—To compare the binding of active and latent PAI-1 to the two different forms of vitronectin in detail, we performed a series of experiments that would accomplish a more quantitative characterization of binding by SPR. The association and dissociation time courses and steady state binding were followed at different PAI-1 concentrations ranging from 0.4 to 1000 nm, using a chip with ∼600 RU of rΔsBVN. Binding isotherms were generated by measuring the level of steady state binding at varying concentrations of active and latent PAI-1 to rΔsBVN on the chip, as described previously (32Schar C.R. Blouse G.E. Minor K.H. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10297-10309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Consistent with our previous report, the equilibrium binding experiments with active PAI-1 gave a KD value of 29 ± 3 nm. Evaluation of the rates of association and dissociation under these conditions gave koff = 0.049 ± 0.010 s-1 and kon = 1.17 ± 0.17 × 106 m-1s-1 (n = 7). KD calculated from the kinetics in SPR is 42 nm. Latent PAI-1 binds to rΔsBVN with a KD value of ∼120 nm (Fig. 2). Thus, latent PAI-1 binds only somewhat more weakly to the second site on vitronectin, which lies external to the SMB domain. Mapping the Binding Site in PAI-1 That Recognizes Residues Outside of the SMB Domain in rΔsBVN—To probe for an additional vitronectin-binding site within PAI-1 that is complementary to the site on vitronectin that lies external to the SMB domain (32Schar C.R.

Chem. 2008; 283: 10297-10309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), monoclonal antibodies specific for regions of PAI-1 were tested for their ability to block binding to rΔsBVN. The monoclonal antibodies were preincubated with both active and latent PAI-1 before being injected over an rΔsBVN chip. The monoclonal antibodies mAb-1 (39Bodker J.S. Wind T. Jensen J.K. Hansen M. Pedersen K.E. Andreasen P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1672-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and mAb-6 (40Wind T. Jensen M.A. Andreasen P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1095-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), with respective binding epitopes localized to α-helix C and α-helix F, did not inhibit the binding of PAI-1 to rΔsBVN. However, two monoclonal antibodies, 33B8 (41Gorlatova N.V. Elokdah H. Fan K. Crandall D.L. Lawrence D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16329-16335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and mAb-7 (42Mathiasen L. Dupont D.M. Chrsitsensen A. Blouse G.E. Jensen J.K. Gils A. Declerck P.J. Wind T. Andreasen P.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 74: 641-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), blocked binding of PAI-1 to rΔsBVN, with 33B8 and mAb-7 reducing the binding of latent PAI-1 to 37 or 22% of its original value, respectively, and reducing the binding of active PAI-1 to less than 50% of its original value. The epitopes for these antibodies are composed of residues from the loop connecting α-helix D and β-strand 2A, from β-strand 3A, and from β-strand 2B; the epitope for mAb-7 was mapped to Trp-88, Lys-90, Asp-91, Lys-178, and His-231 (42Mathiasen L.

The general localization of the binding site, apparent from the experiments using monoclonal antibodies, was refined by testing a battery of PAI-1 mutants for binding to rΔsBVN. To screen a larger number of mutants, we measured the steady state level of their binding to rΔsBVN immobilized on a Biacore chip, passing latent PAI-1 over the chip in concentrations ranging from 1 to 2000 nm. The data are summarized in Table 1, reporting the steady state binding of the mutants relative to that of wild-type PAI-1 at a concentration of 400 nm, a value slightly above the KD value described above for binding of latent PAI-1 to rΔsBVN. Under these conditions, binding is subsaturating, and the KD is a major determinant of the total binding. We found that mutant forms of PAI-1 with a number of charge reversal mutations or multiple alanine substitutions reduced the binding substantially. The implicated residues are localized in α-helix E (Arg-117 and Arg-120), α-helix F (Lys-71, Arg-78, Tyr-81, Lys-82) or β-strand 3A (Trp-177). It appears that multiple mutations or charge reversal mutations are needed to observe a significant reduction in binding, as single alanine substitutions had less effect (Table 1). Remarkably, we also found a significant reduction in the binding of a PAI-1 variant with mutations in the flexible hinge region (R103A/M112A/Q125A), which we reported previously as having a strongly reduced binding via the SMB domain (18Jensen J.K.

https://openalex.org/W2068329651,"Phytochromobilin (PΦB) is an open chain tetrapyrrole molecule that functions as the chromophore of light-sensing phytochromes in plants. Derived from heme, PΦB is synthesized through an open chain tetrapyrrole intermediate, biliverdin IXα (BV), in the biosynthesis pathway. BV is subsequently reduced by the PΦB synthase HY2 in plants. HY2 is a ferredoxin-dependent bilin reductase that catalyzes the reduction of the A-ring 2,3,31,32-diene system to produce an ethylidene group for assembly with apophytochromes.

Detailed analysis of these site-directed mutants highlighted a pair of aspartate residues central to proton donation and substrate positioning. A mechanistic prediction for the HY2 reaction is proposed. These results support the hypothesis that ferredoxin-dependent bilin reductases reduce BV through a radical mechanism, but their double bond specificity is decided by strategic placement of different proton-donating residues surrounding the bilin substrate in the active sites.

The phytochrome-bound PΦB absorbs light energy and proceeds with reversible structural rearrangement to alter the biochemical activities of phytochrome. PΦB is covalently linked to apophytochrome through a thioether bond between a conserved cysteine residue on the apoprotein and the ethylidene group on the A-ring of PΦB (1Lagarias J.C. Rapoport H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 4821-4828Crossref Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of PΦB has been shown to reside in the plastids, where heme is first linearized by a heme oxygenase into the reaction intermediate biliverdin IXα (BV) and then subsequently reduced by a PΦB synthase (2Kohchi T. Mukougawa K. Frankenberg N. Masuda M. Yokota A. Lagarias J.C. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 425-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 3Muramoto T. Kohchi T. Yokota A. Hwang I.H. Goodman H.M.

In Arabidopsis, the HY2 (LONG HYPOCOTYL 2) gene encodes the PΦB synthase (EC 1.3.7.4), which catalyzes the ferredoxin-dependent reaction of double bond reduction at the A-ring 2,3,31,32-diene system of BV to yield 3Z/3E-PΦB (Fig. 1A) (2Kohchi T. Mukougawa K. Frankenberg N. Masuda M. Yokota A. Lagarias J.C. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 425-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Mutations in HY2 have been shown to severely affect photomorphogenetic processes due to the loss of all functional phytochromes (6Chory J. Peto C. Ashbaugh M. Saganich R. Pratt L. Ausubel F. Plant Cell. 1989; 1: 867-880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Parks B.M. Quail P.H. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 1177-1186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many HY2-related proteins have been identified from various oxygenic photosynthetic organisms and collectively named ferredoxin-dependent bilin reductases (FDBRs) (8Frankenberg N. Mukougawa K. Kohchi T. Lagarias J.C. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 965-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). FDBRs utilize reduced ferredoxin as the electron donor to reduce BV into different biliprotein chromophores with different double bond specificities. Phycocyanobilin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PcyA; EC 1.3.7.5) catalyzes two double bond reductions of BV on A- and D-rings to yield phycocyanobilin. 15,16-Dihydrobiliverdin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PebA; EC 1.3.7.2) and phycoerythrobilin (PEB):ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PebB; EC 1.3.7.3) work together to reduce the C-15–C-16 and A-ring double bond to produce PEB (8Frankenberg N. Mukougawa K. Kohchi T. Lagarias J.C. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 965-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). A recently identified PEB synthase (PebS) can itself catalyze the two double bond reductions to yield PEB (9Dammeyer T. Bagby S.C. Sullivan M.B. Chisholm S.W. Frankenberg-Dinkel N. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 442-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). PcyA is the most extensively studied FDBR enzyme. Previous biochemical analysis has identified a two-electron reduced intermediate, 181,182-dihydrobiliverdin IXα, present in the PcyA reaction, indicating that D-ring reduction precedes A-ring reduction (Fig. 1B) (10Frankenberg N. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9219-9226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Two organic radical intermediates have also been detected in the two double bond reduction steps, strongly supporting the proposed mechanism for sequential electron-coupled proton transfer in the PcyA-catalyzed BV reduction (11Tu S.-L. Gunn A. Toney M.D. Britt R.D. Lagarias J.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 8682-8693Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies have shown a histidine/aspartate ion pair playing the essential role in the active site, which is further confirmed by the crystal structure of PcyA (12Tu S.-L. Rockwell N.C. Lagarias J.C. Fisher A.J. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1484-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 13Tu S.-L. Sughrue W. Britt R.D. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol.

A. 2006; 103: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Combining the structural information and biochemical data, a more detailed mechanism for PcyA reaction has been proposed (12Tu S.-L. Rockwell N.C. Lagarias J.C. Fisher A.J. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1484-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The histidine/aspartate ion pair functions as the central proton provider, which first works together with a glutamate residue to donate two protons to the D-ring exo-vinyl group and then with water molecules to mediate proton transfers from two possible proton relays to the A-ring 2,3,31,32-diene system. In contrast to the understanding of PcyA, the catalytic mechanism of other FDBRs is still not well elucidated. With the activity that is common in most FDBRs, HY2 is the ideal candidate to investigate A-ring 2,3,31,32-diene reduction (ethylidene group formation), as well as the global mechanism for FDBR catalysis. Here, we report that an organic radical species can be detected in HY2-catalyzed A-ring 2,3,31,32-diene reduction, suggesting that BV reduction catalyzed by HY2 proceeds as a series of electron transfers from ferredoxin accompanied by proton donations from the enzyme. The results also reveal that the radical mechanism is universal to FDBRs. Mutagenesis identified the conserved Asp256 residue as being critical for protonation. Another aspartate residue, Asp116, is important for substrate positioning in the active site. Based on the biochemical information, a catalytic mechanism for HY2-catalyzed BV reduction is proposed.

Protein Expression, Purification, and Site-directed Mutagenesis—For expressing HY2 protein, the Arabidopsis mHY2 coding region without the predicted N-terminal transit peptide was subcloned into the Escherichia coli expression vector pTYB12 (New England Biolabs) to construct pTYB12-mHY2 (2Kohchi T. Mukougawa K. Frankenberg N. Masuda M. Yokota A. Lagarias J.C. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 425-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). E. coli strain BL21 containing pTYB12-mHY2 was generated to express chitin-binding domain-mHY2. The bacterial cells were grown at 37 °C in 500-ml batches of Luria-Bertani medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) to A600 = 0.6–1.0. Cultures were induced by the addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, incubated overnight at 16 °C, and harvested subsequently by centrifugation. Tag-free mHY2 was purified according to instructions supplied by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). Tag-free mHY2 protein was further purified with a Superdex 200 size exclusion column pre-equilibrated with 25 mm TES-KOH (pH 8.5), 100 mm KCl, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. All site-directed mutants were generated in pTYB12-mHY2 using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutant mHY2 proteins were expressed and purified following a method similar to that used for the wild-type protein. Expression and purification of recombinant Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 PcyA were performed as described previously (10Frankenberg N. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9219-9226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Recombinant Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 ferredoxin (Fd) was purified as described previously (16Schluchter, W. M.

HY2, PcyA, and Fd preparations were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C prior to use. Enzyme Assay and Spectroscopic Analysis—Steady-state bilin reductase assays were performed similarly to those described previously (10Frankenberg N. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9219-9226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Steady-state assay conditions consisted of 25 mm TES-KOH (pH 8.5), 100 mm KCl, 0.025 units/ml FNR, 5 μm Fd, 100 μm bovine serum albumin, 10 μm BV, 0.1 μm purified wild-type or mutant mHY2, 25 units/ml glucose oxidase, 100 mm glucose, and 25 units/ml catalase. Excess NADPH (i.e. 30 μm) was added to initiate catalysis. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min (determined to be within the linear range for mHY2 activity). Crude bilins were extracted with a Sep-Pak Light C18 cartridge and subsequently evaporated to dryness using a SpeedVac concentrator. HPLC analysis and anaerobic single turnover mHY2 assays were performed as described previously (11Tu S.-L. Gunn A. Toney M.D. Britt R.D. Lagarias J.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 8682-8693Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. For single turnover assay, the concentration of FNR was increased from 0.0025 to 0.00625 units/ml. UV-visible absorption and freeze-quench EPR spectroscopic measurements were performed as described previously (11Tu S.-L. Gunn A. Toney M.D. Britt R.D. Lagarias J.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 8682-8693Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For measuring the UV-visible spectra of BV complexes of wild-type HY2, PcyA, and site-directed mutants, 10 μm BV and enzymes were mixed and incubated at 25 °C for 5 min prior to measurement. To compare the efficiency of BV binding between wild-type HY2 and site-directed mutants, the long-to-short wavelength absorption ratios (A650/A380) of enzyme-BV complexes were measured. Ratios for free and wild-type HY2-bound BV were set as 0 and 100%, respectively. For EPR measurements, the single turnover assay was used with the exception that the concentrations of mHY2, BV, Fd, and FNR were all increased 4-fold (to 40 μm, 40 μm, 40 μm, and 0.025 units/ml, respectively), and 10% spectroanalytical grade glycerol was included in the reaction mixtures. At various time points after the addition of NADPH, 200-μl aliquots were withdrawn from reaction mixtures, transferred to 4-mm quartz EPR tubes, and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Continuous wave EPR studies of mHY2 were performed using a Bruker E580 spectrometer. EPR spectra at 70 K were acquired using an X-band microwave frequency of 9.50 GHz with a modulation amplitude of 4 G. CD analysis was performed on a Jasco J-715 CD spectrophotometer. CD spectra were recorded at room temperature under constant nitrogen gas flow with a 0.1-cm sample light pass. Structure Simulation and Modeling—The structure of PebS with bound BV (Protein Data Bank code 2VCK) (see accompanying article (26Dammeyer T. Hofmann E. Frankenberg-Dinkel N. J. Biol.

The resulting binary model for HY2 was manually edited in coot to lessen steric clashes and then subjected to energy minimization in Discovery Studio 2.0 (17Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr.

Absorption Spectrum of HY2-bound BV Implies That the Conformation Is Different Compared with PcyA-bound BV Molecule—Absorption of bilins is easily affected by their conformation, protonation state, and chemical environment (18Falk H. The Chemistry of Linear Oligopyrroles and Bile Pigments. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1989Crossref Google Scholar). In the case of BV and as shown in Fig. 2, free BV gives a low long-to-short wavelength absorption ratio of 0.27 in solution. PcyA-bound BV has been predicted to adopt a cyclic porphyrin-like configuration based on the observation of an absorption increase at a long wavelength (ratio of 0.48) and a blue shift in the absorption maximum to 650 nm (10Frankenberg N. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9219-9226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This is confirmed by the crystal structure of the PcyA-BV binary structure (14Hagiwara Y. Sugishima M. Takahashi Y. Fukuyama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The absorption change in the long wavelength band could be primarily from the change in both the conformation and protonation state of bound BV. So far, many ionizable residues in the active site of PcyA have been selected to investigate their functions in binding and catalysis. Critical residues have been identified (12Tu S.-L. Rockwell N.C. Lagarias J.C. Fisher A.J. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1484-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 13Tu S.-L. Sughrue W. Britt R.D. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3127-3136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). None of the mutations of these critical residues give a significant loss of the 650 nm band. We therefore believe that the long wavelength absorption is due mainly to the conformational change upon binding. In contrast to PcyA, HY2-bound BV showed a similar blue shift at a long wavelength but with a larger absorption, giving a long-to-short absorption ratio of 0.73. The results indicate that HY2-bound BV is cyclic but with a slightly extended conformation compared with PcyA-bound BV. The 740 nm near-infrared absorption observed in the spectrum of PcyA-bound BV has been shown to be an indication of the primary protonation of the BV substrate, which is the determinant for subsequent proton transfer steps (11Tu S.-L. Gunn A. Toney M.D. Britt R.D. Lagarias J.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 8682-8693Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 13Tu S.-L. Sughrue W. Britt R.D. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3127-3136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, the 740 nm absorption was not detected in the absorption spectrum of HY2-bound BV. This suggests that the initial protonation step in the catalytic reaction of HY2 may be different from that in PcyA. Spectral Change upon the Addition of Electrons to the HY2-BV Complex Indicates the Formation of a Transient Radical Intermediate—We then monitored the HY2 catalytic reaction by UV-visible spectroscopy with anaerobic bilin reductase assay by sequentially adding 1 eq of electron (i.e. 5 μm NADPH) to 10 μm HY2-BV complex (Fig. 3A). After adding the first equivalent of electrons (1 eq of e–), a significant spectral change was observed mainly at the long wavelength absorption. Absorption at 650 nm started to decrease accompanied by the shifting of the long wavelength absorption maximum to 615 nm, indicating the formation of PΦB following time. This result was confirmed by the HPLC analysis of reaction products 10 min after adding NADPH (Fig. 3B, 1 eq. e– trace). Notable absorption increased at 740 nm, followed by a slow decay, indicating that a new species of pigment was produced. A similar phenomenon has been detected in the PcyA reaction, representing the formation of transient radical species during double bond reductions (11Tu S.-L. Gunn A. Toney M.D. Britt R.D. Lagarias J.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 8682-8693Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The results suggest that HY2-catalyzed A-ring diene reduction also possibly proceeds with a radical intermediate. Sequential additions of 2 and 3 electron eq showed similar results but with less absorption change at 740 nm and more decrease at 650 nm, giving more PΦB production (Fig. 3B, 2 and 3 eq. e– traces). To detect the radical species, the single turnover anaerobic assay for binary BV complexes with HY2 proteins was performed and monitored by both UV-visible and EPR spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 4A, wild-type HY2 rapidly converted BV into PΦB in 5 min with an excess equivalent of electrons added. Compared with 1 eq of electron reduction (Fig. 3A), the absorption change at 740 nm was more significant, and a slight change at 470 nm was observed. Aliquots were taken from the reaction mixture at different time points after adding NADPH, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and measured by EPR spectroscopy. An isotropic EPR signal at G ≈ 2 with a peak-to-trough width of 15 G was detected (Fig. 4B). The radical signal appeared rapidly and slowly decayed with similar kinetics as the absorbance change at 740 nm (Fig. 4C). These spectral properties are similar to those of the PcyA reaction but with the difference that the HY2 radical can be detected at higher temperature (70 K), suggesting that the HY2-BV radical is more stable and well protected by the enzyme during reaction (11Tu S.-L. Gunn A. Toney M.D. Britt R.D. Lagarias J.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 8682-8693Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These results confirm that a transient radical intermediate is produced in the HY2-catalyzed BV reduction. Mutagenesis Study Identifies Asp116, Asp256, and Lys255 in the Reduction of the A-ring Double Bond—The double bond reduction requires proton donations from enzymes. We then envisaged identifying the proton-donating residues on HY2 that are critical for the catalytic steps. Several possible catalytic residues, including Asp116, Cys131, and Lys255, have been proposed based on the homology model of the HY2 active site constructed from the holo-PcyA structure (12Tu S.-L. Rockwell N.C. Lagarias J.C. Fisher A.J. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1484-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These residues are all present in two conserved regions of the multiple sequence alignment of FDBRs (supplemental Fig. S1A). The two conserved regions represent the main part of the central β-sheet and C-terminal α-helices in the PcyA structure (supplemental Fig. S1B) (12Tu S.-L. Rockwell N.C. Lagarias J.C. Fisher A.J. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1484-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 14Hagiwara Y. Sugishima M. Takahashi Y. Fukuyama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Combining the information from the homology model and sequence alignment, we selected several conserved ionizable residues within the two conserved regions for mutagenesis. All of the mutant proteins were expressed, purified to homogeneity, and measured for steady-state bilin reductase activity (Table 1). The long-to-short wavelength ratios in the absorption spectra of the enzyme-BV complexes were measured to compare the relative ability of BV to bind to wild-type and mutant HY2 proteins.TABLE 1Relative activities of wild-type HY2 and site-directed mutantsProteinActivityBV binding% of wild-type% of wild-typeWild-type100.0100D116N1.591D116H2.530D116E113.952D256N<191D256H463D256E2875D146N<1<1C131A85.053N133A38.584R252Q2.33K255Q21.5105 Open table in a new tab An aspartate residue (Asp102 in Nostoc PcyA) has been shown to function as the proton donor in PcyA-catalyzed BV reduction (13Tu S.-L. Sughrue W. Britt R.D. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3127-3136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). There are three conserved aspartate residues in the two conserved regions of HY2, Asp116, Asp146, and Asp256. To test their functional roles, aspartate-to-asparagine substitutions were first made to determine whether the ionization ability of these aspartate residues is essential for HY2 activity. The D116N mutant still retained the ability to bind substrate but with only 1.5% relative activity of the wild-type protein, suggesting that Asp116 is important for BV reduction. The D146N mutant completely lost catalytic activity but also the ability to bind BV, indicating that this mutation affects mainly substrate binding. A similar result was obtained from a mutagenesis study of the same conserved aspartate residue of PcyA, which was also found from the crystal structure to hydrogen bond to another serine residue to stabilize the overall fold (12Tu S.-L. Rockwell N.C. Lagarias J.C. Fisher A.J. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1484-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 13Tu S.-L. Sughrue W. Britt R.D. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol.

This shows that the HY2 protein may have a similar fold to that of PcyA. To our surprise, the mutation of Asp256 to asparagine abolished HY2 activity without affecting substrate binding. Although Asp256 is universally conserved in the FDBR family, mutation of the corresponding aspartic acid residue of PcyA (Asp217) has been shown to have no effect on activity (13Tu S.-L. Sughrue W. Britt R.D. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3127-3136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Structural data for PcyA also indicate that the carboxylic side chain of this residue initially points into the binding pocket in the apo structure but becomes solvent-exposed upon substrate binding (12Tu S.-L. Rockwell N.C. Lagarias J.C. Fisher A.J. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1484-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 14Hagiwara Y. Sugishima M. Takahashi Y. Fukuyama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In HY2, this residue apparently plays an important role in BV reduction. This result is further supported by data from a new member of the FDBR family, PebS, which catalyzes the reduction of BV into PEB with the C-15–C-16 double bond and A-ring diene reduction activities (9Dammeyer T. Bagby S.C. Sullivan M.B. Chisholm S.W. Frankenberg-Dinkel N. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 442-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 26Dammeyer T. Hofmann E. Frankenberg-Dinkel N. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27547-27554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To address the importance of Asp116 and Asp256, additional amino acid substitutions were generated. Replacement of both residues with histidine also completely abolished HY2 activity, indicating the requirement of their acidic side chains for HY2 reaction. However, the D256E mutant retained only partial activity, showing the importance of the configuration or length of the Asp256 carboxylic side chain. In addition to the aspartate mutations, we also selected several residues, including Cys131, Asn133, Arg252, and Lys255, for mutagenesis. Based on previous homology modeling results, these residues were predicted to reside in the active site of HY2, being close to bound BV. HY2 with a mutation of Cys131 to alanine retained almost full activity, indicating that this residue is not the proton donor. Although asparagine is not ionizable, the N133A mutant produced only partial activity, indicating that this residue may play other roles in the active site, such as stabilizing BV conformation through hydrogen bonding. The R252Q mutant lost catalytic activity and the ability to bind substrate, indicating that this mutation affects substrate binding. Mutation of Lys255 showed a severe effect on catalytic activity, suggesting that this residue may be important for PΦB production. Because of the high pKa for lysine, the catalytic role of Lys255 needs to be further investigated. Taken together with the steady-state activity of HY2 mutants, we found several residues in HY2, including Asp116, Asp256, and Lys255, that may be involved in the process of BV A-ring 2,3,31,32-diene reduction. Anaerobic Assay Reveals That Asp256 Is the Important Proton Donor—Because our steady-state assay cannot produce quantitative kinetic data, a more detailed analysis of the pre-steady-state catalysis reaction for these mutants was performed. To examine whether mutant enzymes can support proton transfer for BV reduction, single turnover anaerobic assays for the binary BV complexes with mutant HY2 proteins were monitored by UV-visible spectroscopy with an excess equivalent of electrons added. Compared with the wild-type reaction (Fig. 5, upper left panel), BV was also fully converted into PΦB but with slower kinetics than in the D116N-BV reaction (lower left panel). This was also confirmed by HPLC analysis (data not shown). A dramatic change in absorption at 470, 670, and 730 nm was observed, showing a rapid increase and slow decay following time. This result suggests that the BV molecule in the binding pocket of the D116N mutant protein undergoes a significant change in conformation and/or protonation state during reduction. Although the D116N mutant showed abolished activity in the steady-state assay, the protein-bound BV could still be reduced into PΦB, indicating that Asp116 is not directly involved in the proton donation steps. The reaction with the K255Q mutant also yielded PΦBinthe single turnover assay but with much slower kinetics compared with the wild-type reaction (Fig. 5, upper right panel). This result suggests that the lysine mutant can support proton transfers to the BV substrate. Because K255Q is affected only in the steady-state reaction, it is possible that Lys255 is inv"

We report here the crystal structure of the catalytically active full-length botulinum serotype E catalytic domain (BoNT E) in complex with SNAP-25 (a SNARE protein) substrate peptide Arg(180)-Ile(181)-Met(182)-Glu(183) (P1-P3'). It is remarkable that the peptide spanning the scissile bond binds to but bypasses cleavage by the enzyme and inhibits the catalysis fairly with K(i) approximately 69 microm. The inhibitory peptide occupies the active site of BoNT E and shows well defined electron density. The catalytic zinc and the conserved key residue Tyr(350) of the enzyme facilitate the docking of Arg(180) (P1) by interacting with its carbonyl oxygen that displaces the nucleophilic water. The general base Glu(212) side chain interacts with the main chain amino group of P1 and P1'. Conserved Arg(347) of BoNT E stabilizes the proper docking of the Ile(181) (P1') main chain, whereas the hydrophobic pockets stabilize the side chains of Ile(181) (P1') and Met(182) (P2'), and the 250 loop stabilizes Glu(183) (P3'). Structural and functional analysis revealed an important role for the P1' residue and S1' pocket in driving substrate recognition and docking at the active site. This study is the first of its kind and rationalizes the substrate cleavage strategy of BoNT E. Also, our complex structure opens up an excellent opportunity of structure-based drug design for this fast acting and extremely toxic high priority BoNT E."
https://openalex.org/W2095298191,"Mechanisms regulating the activation and delivery of function of Lck and Fyn are central to the generation of the most proximal signaling events emanating from the T cell antigen receptor (TcR) complex. Recent results demonstrate that lipid rafts (LR) segregate Lck and Fyn and play a fundamental role in the temporal and spatial coordination of their activation. Specifically, TcR-CD4 co-aggregation-induced Lck activation outside LR results in Lck translocation to LR where the activation of LR-resident Fyn ensues. Here we report a structure-function analysis toward characterizing the mechanism supporting Lck partitioning to LR and its capacity to activate co-localized Fyn. Using NIH 3T3 cells ectopically expressing FynT, we demonstrate that only LR-associated, kinase-active (Y505F)Lck reciprocally co-immunoprecipitates with and activates Fyn. Mutational analyses revealed a profound reduction in the formation of Lck-Fyn complexes and Fyn activation, using kinase domain mutants K273R and Y394F of (Y505F)Lck, both of which have profoundly compromised kinase activity. The only kinase-active Lck mutants tested that revealed impaired physical and enzymatic engagement with Fyn were those involving truncation of the C-terminal sequence YQPQP. Remarkably, sequential truncation of YQPQP resulted in an increasing reduction of kinase-active Lck partitioning to LR, in both fibroblasts and T cells. This in turn correlated with an ablation of the capacity of these truncates to enhance TcR-mediated interleukin-2 production. Thus, Lck-dependent Fyn activation is predicated by proximity-mediated transphosphorylation of the Fyn kinase domain, and targeting kinase-active Lck to LR is dependent on the C-terminal sequence QPQP."
https://openalex.org/W1985326569,"The present study tested the hypothesis that several residues in Loop 2 of alpha1 glycine receptors (GlyRs) play important roles in mediating the transduction of agonist activation to channel gating. This was accomplished by investigating the effect of cysteine point mutations at positions 50-60 on glycine responses in alpha1GlyRs using two-electrode voltage clamp of Xenopus oocytes. Cysteine substitutions produced position-specific changes in glycine sensitivity that were consistent with a beta-turn structure of Loop 2, with odd-numbered residues in the beta-turn interacting with other agonist-activation elements at the interface between extracellular and transmembrane domains. We also tested the hypothesis that the charge at position 53 is important for agonist activation by measuring the glycine response of wild type (WT) and E53C GlyRs exposed to methanethiosulfonate reagents. As earlier, E53C GlyRs have a significantly higher EC(50) than WT GlyRs. Exposing E53C GlyRs to the negatively charged 2-sulfonatoethyl methanethiosulfonate, but not neutral 2-hydroxyethyl methanethiosulfonate, positively charged 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate, or 2-trimethylammonioethyl methanethiosulfonate, decreased the glycine EC(50) to resemble WT GlyR responses. Exposure to these reagents did not significantly alter the glycine EC(50) for WT GlyRs. The latter findings suggest that the negative charge at position 53 is important for activation of GlyRs through its interaction with positive charge(s) in other neighboring agonist activation elements. Collectively, the findings provide the basis for a refined molecular model of alpha1GlyRs based on the recent x-ray structure of a prokaryotic pentameric ligand-gated ion channel and offer insight into the structure-function relationships in GlyRs and possibly other ligand-gated ion channels."

Three factors that mediate this mechanism have been identified: 1) the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex RdRC, 2) the Argonaute-containing RITS (RNA-induced initiation of transcriptional silencing) complex, and 3) the endoribonuclease Dicer ortholog Dcr1. S. pombe mutants lacking a new factor described here, Ers1, are completely defective in RNAi-dependent silencing of centromeric regions but, importantly, not in RNAi-independent silencing at the mat3M or tel2R loci. ers1Delta cells likewise fail to convert centromeric pre-small interfering RNA transcripts into small interfering RNAs, are defective in histone H3 Lys(9) methylation, and are unable to recruit the RITS complex to centromeric sequences. Surprisingly, Ers1 lacks obvious orthologs outside of the genus Schizosaccharomyces. Within this group, it is diverging rapidly, raising the possibility that it is coevolving with target RNA elements."
https://openalex.org/W2075899553,"To ensure inheritance by daughter cells, many low-copy number bacterial plasmids, including the R1 drug-resistance plasmid, encode their own DNA segregation systems. The par operon of plasmid R1 directs construction of a simple spindle structure that converts free energy of polymerization of an actin-like protein, ParM, into work required to move sister plasmids to opposite poles of rod-shaped cells. The structures of individual components have been solved, but little is known about the ultrastructure of the R1 spindle. To determine the number of ParM filaments in a minimal R1 spindle, we used DNA-gold nanocrystal conjugates as mimics of the R1 plasmid. We found that each end of a single polar ParM filament binds to a single ParR/parC-gold complex, consistent with the idea that ParM filaments bind in the hollow core of the ParR/parC ring complex.

Our results further suggest that multifilament spindles observed in vivo are associated with clusters of plasmids segregating as a unit. In eubacteria and archaea, many biologically important processes are carried out by genes encoded on large, low-copy number plasmids. These include genes conferring resistance to antibiotic and heavy metal toxicity, as well as genes involved in host cell invasion and pathogenicity. These large plasmids face a difficult challenge. To reduce the metabolic load they impose on the host cell, their copy numbers must be kept to a minimum (one to two per chromosome equivalent) (1Nordström K. Ingram L.C. Lundbäck A. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 110: 562-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At such low-copy numbers, they can no longer rely on chance for their maintenance in the bacterial population. To be stably maintained, these low-copy number plasmids must, like chromosomes, be actively segregated to daughter cells before division. Two classes of plasmid segregation systems (Types I and II) have been known and studied for years (2Gerdes K. Møller-Jensen J. Bugge Jensen R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 455-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), and recent work has uncovered several more (3Larsen R.A. Cusumano C. Fujioka A. Lim-Fong G. Patterson P. Pogliano J. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1340-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 4Becker E. Herrera N.C. Gunderson F.Q. Derman A.I. Dance A.L. Sims J. Larsen R.A. Pogliano J. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5919-5931Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Each system appears to be encoded on a single operon and to be composed of three pieces: 1) a centromeric DNA sequence, 2) a DNA-binding protein, and 3) a polymer-forming protein. The most well understood of these systems is the Type II segregation machinery encoded by the R1 drug-resistance plasmid. Segregation of R1 is driven by the par operon, which consists of a 150-bp centromeric sequence (parC), a repressor protein (ParR) that binds to the centromeric sequence, and a divergent actin-like protein (ParM) that polymerizes into dynamically unstable filaments in the presence of ATP (5Møller-Jensen J. Jensen R.B. Löwe J. Gerdes K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3119-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Binding of the ParR/parC complex to ParM filaments stabilizes them against catastrophic disassembly and promotes their elongation via insertional polymerization at the interface with the ParR/parC complex. When both ends of a ParM filament are bound to ParR/parC complexes, elongation of the filament pushes the attached plasmids in opposite directions. High-resolution structures of components of the R1 spindle are available (6Møller-Jensen J. Ringgaard S. Mercogliano C.P. Gerdes K. Lowe J. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4413-4422Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 7Schumacher M.A. Glover T.C. Brzoska A.J. Jensen S.O. Dunham T.D. Skurray R.A. Firth N.A. Nature. 2007; 450: 1268-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), but provide little information about the ultrastructure of the R1 spindle itself. The atomic structure of ParM monomers reveals a basic similarity to conventional actin, whereas electron microscopy reveals that ParM and actin filaments differ significantly (8Orlova A. Garner E.C. Galkin V.E. Heuser J. Mullins R.D. Egelman E.H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Like actin, ParM filaments are structurally polarized, with distinct ends corresponding to the barbed and pointed ends of a conventional actin filament. Unlike actin, the long-pitch, two-start helix of ParM filaments is left-handed rather than right-handed, and the orientation of the ParM monomer with respect to the filament axis is significantly different from that of actin. Both free and ParR/parC-bound filaments elongate at equal rates from each end. This fact and the polar nature of ParM filaments place constraints on the mechanism of the interaction with the ParR/parC complex as follows. (a) ParR/parC contains two distinct ParM-binding sites, one for “pointed” ends and one for “barbed” ends; (b) spindles are composed of bundles of antiparallel filaments, and the complex recognizes an identical surface at each end of the bundle; or (c) ParR/parC interacts with a surface present at or near both filament ends. X-ray crystallography of the ParR/parC complex reveals that multiple ParR dimers assemble into a helical ring with parC DNA running around the outside edge. This “segrosome” ring is hollow, with a 6-nm hole through the center. The size of the hole suggests that a single ParM filament (also 6 nm in diameter) might bind the inside of the ParR/parC ring complex (6Møller-Jensen J. Ringgaard S. Mercogliano C.P. Gerdes K. Lowe J. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4413-4422Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 7Schumacher M.A. Glover T.C. Brzoska A.J. Jensen S.O. Dunham T.D. Skurray R.A. Firth N.A. Nature. 2007; 450: 1268-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). By forming a collar around the end of a filament, the ParR/parC complex would pose no barrier to elongation, and if the affinity of the complex for ParM depends on the nucleotide bound to the filament, hydrolysis of ATP within the filament could promote tracking of the complex with the elongating filament end. This is similar to the way in which the Dam1 complex is thought to interact with the dynamic ends of microtubules (9Westermann S. Wang H.W. Avila-Sakar A. Drubin D.G. Nogales E. Barnes G. Nature. 2006; 440: 565-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In addition, a collar encircling a ParM filament might prevent monomer dissociation, providing an attractive explanation for how the ParR/parC complex stabilizes filaments against catastrophic disassembly. This model appears to be at odds with in vivo studies of R1 spindles that suggest plasmids are segregated by spindles composed of multiple filaments (10Campbell C.S. Mullins R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, R1 plasmids are also observed to cluster in vivo, and it is unclear whether multifilament spindles observed in vivo are assembled by pairs of individual plasmids or by pairs of plasmid clusters. To better understand the coupling of the ParR/parC complex to ParM filaments, we determined the maximum number of filaments that can simultaneously associate with an individual ParR/parC complex. To do this, we attached defined numbers of parC-containing DNA molecules to gold nanoparticles and counted the number of filaments associated with each particle. Preparation of such discrete DNA-Au particles is well established (11Zanchet D. Micheel C.M. Parak W.J. Gerion D. Alivisatos A.P. Nano Lett. 2001; 1: 32-35Crossref Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 12Claridge S.A. Liang H.W. Basu S.R. Frechet J.M.J. Alivisatos A.P. Nano Lett. 2008; 8: 1202-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We initiated ParM filament formation in vitro in the presence of DNA-Au nanoparticle conjugates and visualized associated ParM filaments by transmission electron microscopy. The high contrast of gold nanoparticles enabled us to identify the location of ParR/parC complexes relative to ParM filaments. Preparation of Gold Colloid—Samples of 5- and 10-nm gold colloid were prepared according to a literature procedure (13Loweth C.J. Caldwell W.B. Peng X.G. Alivisatos A.P. Schultz P.G. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1999; 38: 1808-1812Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), described in detail by Claridge et al. (14Claridge S.A. Goh S.L. Frechet J.M.J. Williams S.C. Micheel C.M. Alivisatos A.P. Chem. Mater. 2005; 17: 1628-1635Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The gold particles were used as an electron-dense tag for parC strands. Hybridization of Thiolated Double-stranded parC DNA—The 150-bp parC was composed of four oligonucleotides (synthesized and purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) as shown in Fig. 1A. The following oligonucleotide sequences were used (cpc1 denotes the strand containing the cp and c1 regions; p2 denotes the strand containing the p and 2 regions): c2, 5′-(thiol)-TTT TTG GTG TTT TTT TGG TGT GTG TTT GGG TAT GTT TTG GGT TTT AAA TGG GTT TGT TTG-3′; cpc1, 5′-TCA AGT TTA CCC CAT TTC AAC CAT CAA TCA ATG ATT ATT TGT CTT GTT TTG GTG TTT TAT TGG GTT GGG TAT GGG TTG TTT TTG GGT TTT GTT TAA AAA-3′; 1, 5′-TTT TTA AAC AAA ACC CAA AAA CAA CCC ATA CCC AAC CCA ATA AAA CAC CAA AAC AAG ACA-3′; and p2, 5′-AAT AAT CAT TGA TTG ATG GTT GAA ATG GGG TAA ACT TGA CAA ACA AAC CCA CTT AAA ACC CAA AAC ATA CCC AAA CAC ACA CCA AAA AAA CAC C-3′.A solution with 6 μm of each of the four oligonucleotides in 100 mm NaCl was heated at 80 °C for 2 min and then cooled to room temperature over 1 h to allow the strands to hybridize. Synthesis of parC-Au Conjugates—DNA-Au conjugates were prepared and isolated according to Zanchet et al. (11Zanchet D. Micheel C.M. Parak W.J. Gerion D. Alivisatos A.P. Nano Lett. 2001; 1: 32-35Crossref Scopus (421) Google Scholar) and Loweth et al. (13Loweth C.J. Caldwell W.B. Peng X.G. Alivisatos A.P. Schultz P.G. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1999; 38: 1808-1812Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 3% agarose gel was used to separate different types of conjugates. Protein Purification—Untagged ParM and ParR were purified following procedures described by Garner et al. (15Garner E.C. Campbell C.S. Weibel D.B. Mullins R.D. Science. 2007; 315: 1270-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Mixing of parC-Au Conjugates with Other Par Components and ATP—ParM and ParR were diluted to 23 and 2 μm, respectively, in Buffer F (100 mm KCl, 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine). A 20-μl solution of 15–30 nm parC-Au, 350–700 nm ParR, and 2.3 μm ParM in Buffer F/FA (1% (w/v) 400-centipoise methylcellulose, 100 mm KCl, 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm MgCl2, and 500 μm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine HCl) (15Garner E.C. Campbell C.S. Weibel D.B. Mullins R.D. Science. 2007; 315: 1270-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) was mixed and incubated on ice for 10–20 min while transmission electron microscopy grids were plasma-ionized. The sample was pipetted onto a strip of Parafilm, and 1.5 μl of ATP (100 mm) was added for a total of 15–60 s to initiate ParM polymerization. Experiments without ParR were performed similarly, but with Buffer F in place of ParR to maintain similar sample volume and salt concentration. Control experiments of parC-Au particles alone, all components without ParM, and all components without ATP were performed, with no filaments observed in any of these cases (supplemental Fig. 1). Occasionally gray wisps of ∼50 nm in length attached to the gold particles were observed, all in control experiments, leading us to hypothesize that the wisps are parC-Au strands. These occasional observations were not surprising; uranyl acetate is a known stain for large DNA sequences, but DNA on the order of hundreds of base pairs (such as parC) is more difficult to visualize. Preparation and Visualization of Samples by Transmission Electron Microscopy—Carbon-coated copper transmission electron microscopy grids (Ted Pella) were ionized for 30 s in a Harrick Plasma PDC-32G oxygen plasma cleaner to increase surface hydrophilicity; the grids were then floated carbon-side down for 1–10 s on the 15-μl sample + 1.5 μl of ATP (10 mm) reaction. The sample was wicked off and allowed to partially air-dry. Once grids were nearly dry, 10 μl of 2% uranyl acetate was added to each grid and incubated for 1 min. The uranyl acetate stain was wicked off, and the grids were then immersed sequentially in two 50-ml tubes of deionized water for a total of 50 s. The water was wicked off, and grids were allowed to air-dry prior to analysis. Transmission electron microscopy was performed using a Phillips Tecnai G2 20. Determination of Normalized Structure Occurrence—Wide-field images (magnification × 19,500–38,000) for experiments with and without ParR were analyzed, and the observed structures on each image (ParM structures capped on both ends with a gold particle (Au-M-Au), gold particles associated with one end of a ParM filament structure (Au-M), ParM with gold close to end, ParM with gold close to side, ParM filaments alone) were counted manually. The normalized structure occurrence was obtained by dividing the number of that structure type by the total number of structures observed; normalized occurrences for experiments with and without ParR were tabulated separately. Measurement of ParM Filament Width in Au-M and Au-M-Au Structures—Images (magnification × 38,000–97,000) of Au-M structures (53 total) and Au-M-Au structures (27 total) were analyzed using NIH ImageJ image analysis software (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). A line scan perpendicular to the length of each ParM filament yielded a plot of pixel intensity versus distance; the distance between the darkest points of the scan was taken to be the filament width. Five line scans for each filament were taken at different points along the filament, and the mean of the resulting widths was taken to be the average width of the filament. The histograms for each type of structure were obtained by binning the widths: widths of 4.5 < x ≤ 5.5 nm were binned as 5 nm, and so on, up to 8 nm. Garner et al. (15Garner E.C. Campbell C.S. Weibel D.B. Mullins R.D. Science. 2007; 315: 1270-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) found that, in the presence of ParR, polystyrene particles conjugated to hundreds of copies of parC DNA-stabilized bundles of up to 100 ParM filaments. To determine the number of ParM filaments that interact with a single ParR/parC complex, we prepared gold particles conjugated to single copies of parC-containing DNA, an established and well characterized procedure (11Zanchet D. Micheel C.M. Parak W.J. Gerion D. Alivisatos A.P. Nano Lett. 2001; 1: 32-35Crossref Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 12Claridge S.A. Liang H.W. Basu S.R. Frechet J.M.J. Alivisatos A.P. Nano Lett. 2008; 8: 1202-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Briefly, we incubated gold particles with thiolated parC-containing DNA to obtain particles conjugated to zero, one, two, or three parC sequences. We separated different sized conjugates by gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1B), excised bands containing individual, conjugated species from the gel, and extracted and purified the monoconjugated particles. We mixed monoconjugated parC-Au (Fig. 2A) with purified ParR and ParM, added ATP to induce filament formation, and observed the resulting structures by transmission electron microscopy. We then quantitated the specific association between ParM filaments and parC-Au monoconjugates by comparing and counting the types of structures observed in the absence and presence of the DNA-binding protein ParR (Fig. 2I). In the absence of ParR, we rarely observed gold particles associated with ParM filaments (Fig. 2H), whereas in the presence of ParR, we often observed gold particles closely associated with one or both ends of a ParM structure, with no observable gap between the filament and the gold particle. Addition of ParR increased the frequency of Au-M (Fig. 2, D and E) by >5-fold (Fig. 2I). Likewise, in the presence of ParR, we observed Au-M-Au (Fig. 2, B and C), but never observed such Au-M-Au structures in the absence of ParR (Fig. 2I). These data indicate that the majority of the Au-M and all of the Au-M-Au structures seen in the presence of ParR represent parC-Au nanoparticles bound specifically to ParM filaments via ParR. We also observed gold particles in proximity to the end or side of ParM filaments but separated by an observable gap (Fig. 2, F and G). We scored all such cases in which gold particles were within 15 nm of a ParM filament and found that they occurred with equal frequency in the absence and presence of ParR, suggesting that they represent chance proximity between filaments and particles (Fig. 2I). The majority of ParM filaments in the absence and presence of ParR were not colocalized with gold particles (Fig. 2H). This is reasonable because we used 2.3 μm ParM, a concentration at which filaments can form spontaneously (15Garner E.C. Campbell C.S. Weibel D.B. Mullins R.D. Science. 2007; 315: 1270-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). To determine the number of filaments bound to an individual ParR/parC complex, we measured the width of the ParM filaments in Au-M and Au-M-Au structures. In both cases, we measured an average width of 6.0 ± 0.6 nm (Fig. 3), in good agreement with the width of single ParM filaments (16Garner E.C. Campbell C.S. Mullins R.D. Science. 2004; 306: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 17van den Ent F. Møller-Jensen J. Amos L.A. Gerdes K. Löwe J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6935-6943Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). We never observed ParM structures >8 nm in width, indicating that none of the observed structures (n = 80) contained two filaments. We observed singly capped filaments more frequently than doubly capped, consistent with a lower probability that a ParM filament will encounter two ParR/parC-Au complexes compared with one. The optimal ParM concentration for electron microscopy was ∼2.5 μm. At higher concentrations (7–15 μm, near the ParM concentration estimated inside R1-containing bacterial cells), the filament density was too high to accurately distinguish capped from uncapped filaments. We also tried assembling spindles at high concentration and diluting them immediately prior to visualization, but found that the filaments were sheared and broken by pipetting. At lower concentrations (approaching 0.6 μm, the critical concentration for ATP ParM filaments (15Garner E.C. Campbell C.S. Weibel D.B. Mullins R.D. Science. 2007; 315: 1270-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar)), we observed capped filaments but with significantly reduced frequency. Attempts to increase the encounter frequency by increasing the concentration of ParR/parC-Au particles in solution resulted in a density of gold particles too high to distinguish individual Au-M and Au-M-Au structures. To determine whether our failure to observe more than one ParM filament per gold particle reflects the binding capacity of the ParR/parC complex or an experimental artifact, we mixed ParM with gold nanoparticles conjugated to four or more parC sequences (Fig. 4A). In the presence of ParR and ATP, the multiconjugated gold particles associated with the ends of bundles composed of up to six ParM filaments (Fig. 4, B–E). These data argue strongly that our results with monoconjugated gold particles reflect the binding capacity of the ParR/parC complex. The occurrence of multifilament spindles under these conditions is consistent with our previous observation of multifilament spindles formed by multiconjugated particles (15Garner E.C. Campbell C.S. Weibel D.B. Mullins R.D. Science. 2007; 315: 1270-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and suggests that, once a single filament spindle is formed, the probability of the tethered particles capturing additional filaments is relatively high. DNA-Au nanoparticle conjugates have been used for a variety of purposes, including nanoparticle self-assembly (14Claridge S.A. Goh S.L. Frechet J.M.J. Williams S.C. Micheel C.M. Alivisatos A.P. Chem. Mater. 2005; 17: 1628-1635Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and as probes of biomolecular dynamics (18Sönnichsen C. Reinhard B.M. Liphardt J. Alivisatos A.P. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar). For small gold nanoparticles (<15 nm in diameter) and DNA oligonucleotides longer than 100 bp, it is straightforward to tune the number of DNA molecules attached to each particle (11Zanchet D. Micheel C.M. Parak W.J. Gerion D. Alivisatos A.P. Nano Lett. 2001; 1: 32-35Crossref Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 12Claridge S.A. Liang H.W. Basu S.R. Frechet J.M.J. Alivisatos A.P. Nano Lett. 2008; 8: 1202-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Our in vitro results using DNA-Au monoconjugates to mimic the R1 plasmid demonstrate that a single ParR/parC complex binds either end of a single ParM filament. This implies that, in vivo, pairs of plasmids are segregated by polymerization of single ParM filaments. This is consistent with what is known about the physical properties of ParM filaments. Theoretical considerations and measurements of force produced by polymerizing actin filaments suggest that, in vivo, a growing ParM filament can generate forces on the order of 1 piconewton (19Dye N.A. Shapiro L. Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 239-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Stiffness measurements 2C. L. Choi, S. A. Claridge, E. C. Garner, A. P. Alivisatos, and R. D. Mullins, unpublished data. indicate that ParM filaments have a persistence length (∼10 μm) several times longer than the length of a bacterial cell (1–3 μm) and that, at bacterial length scales, ParM filaments require piconewton forces to buckle. These forces are several orders of magnitude greater than those required to push plasmids through bacterial cytoplasm (20Giardini P.A. Fletcher D.A. Theriot J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6493-6498Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Taken together with recent structural studies of the ParR/parC complex (6Møller-Jensen J. Ringgaard S. Mercogliano C.P. Gerdes K. Lowe J. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4413-4422Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 7Schumacher M.A. Glover T.C. Brzoska A.J. Jensen S.O. Dunham T.D. Skurray R.A. Firth N.A. Nature. 2007; 450: 1268-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), our results suggest that a single 6-nm diameter ParM filament might fit within the ParR segrosome ring. This arrangement would explain three important experimental observations regarding ParM polymer dynamics. By forming a collar around the ParM filament rather than binding the end of the filament “face on,” the ParR/parC ring 1) could interact with identical surfaces at either end of a ParM filament, 2) would not be expected to affect the elongation rate of bound ParM filaments, and 3) could interact with no more than one filament at a time. One hypothesis for how the ParR/parC rings surf on the growing ends of ParM filaments would thus be that the ring has high affinity for ATP-bound portions of the filament and lower affinity for portions of the filament that have hydrolyzed bound ATP (15Garner E.C. Campbell C.S. Weibel D.B. Mullins R.D. Science. 2007; 315: 1270-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). An appealing analogy for this situation is the way in which Dam1 complexes are thought to encircle microtubules. Dam1 rings appear to prefer the plus-end of a microtubule, but by applying force to the complex, it can be moved away from the tip and slide along the entire length of the microtubule (21Ashbury C.L. Gestaut D.R. Powers A.F. Franck A.D. Davis T.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 9873-9878Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Additional single molecule experiments will be required to determine whether this is also true for ParR/parC rings. Finally, we previously found that, in vivo, R1 spindles are occasionally composed of at least two ParM filaments (10Campbell C.S. Mullins R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Our results using monoconjugated gold particles suggest that these multifilament spindles contain at least two ParR/parC complexes at each end. This implies that clusters composed of multiple plasmids (22Pogliano J. Ho T.Q. Zhong Z. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4486-4491Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) can segregate together as a single unit in vivo. This is also consistent with our previous observations of plasmid dynamics in vivo. Using plasmids labeled with fluorescently tagged DNA-binding proteins, we often observed segregation of plasmid foci with dramatically different fluorescence intensities (10Campbell C.S. Mullins R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), suggesting that the two foci contained different numbers of plasmids. Plasmid clustering is not well understood, but we suggest that it may play a previously unsuspected role in replication and segregation in vivo. We thank C. S.

SK binding to the catalytic domain of Pm, with a dissociation constant of 12 pm, is assisted by SK Lys414 binding to a Pm kringle, which accounts for a 11-20-fold affinity decrease when Pm lysine binding sites are blocked by 6-aminohexanoic acid (6-AHA) or benzamidine. The pathway of SK·Pm catalytic complex formation was characterized by stopped-flow kinetics of SK and the Lys414 deletion mutant (SKΔK414) binding to Pm labeled at the active site with 5-fluorescein ([5F]FFR-Pm) and the reverse reactions by competitive displacement of [5F]FFR-Pm with active site-blocked Pm. The rate constants for the biexponential fluorescence quenching caused by SK and SKΔK414 binding to [5F]FFR-Pm were saturable as a function of SK concentration, reporting encounter complex affinities of 62-110 nm in the absence of lysine analogs and 4900-6500 and 1430-2200 nm in the presence of 6-AHA and benzamidine, respectively. The encounter complex with SKΔK414 was ∼10-fold weaker in the absence of lysine analogs but indistinguishable from that of native SK in the presence of 6-AHA and benzamidine. The studies delineate for the first time the sequence of molecular events in the formation of the SK·Pm catalytic complex and its regulation by kringle ligands.

Our equilibrium binding and steady-state kinetic studies describe a unified model for SK-Pg activation in which the conformationally activated SK·Pg* complex initially binds Pg as a specific substrate and cleaves it to Pm in a self-limiting, triggering mechanism (1Boxrud P.D.

Upon formation of slightly more than 1 SK eq of Pm, Pg is displaced from the SK·Pg* complex, and the much tighter SK·Pm catalytic complex is formed which propagates Pg activation through expression of a Pg binding exosite, converting the remaining free Pg to Pm in a second catalytic cycle (2Boxrud P.D. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36642-36649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Previous biophysical studies have shown that SK in solution behaves as independently folded domains linked by flexible segments, resulting in a highly mobile structure (14Damaschun G. Damaschun H. Gast K. Gerlach D. Misselwitz R. Welfle H. Zirwer D. Eur. Biophys. J. 1992; 20: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). When bound to micro-Pm (μPm), the isolated catalytic domain of Pm, however, the three SK β-grasp domains rearrange into a well defined crater-like structure surrounding the Pm active site (15Wang X. Lin X. Loy J.A. Tang J. Zhang X.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). This large change in SK structure is accompanied by expression of the Pg substrate binding exosite (12Boxrud P.D. Fay W.P. Bock P.E. J. Biol.

The circulating form of the Pg zymogen, [Glu]Pg, consists of a 77-residue NH2-terminal peptide, five kringle domains (K1-K5), some of which contain lysine binding sites (LBS), and a COOH-terminal serine proteinase catalytic domain (16Henkin J.

The affinity of SK for native and fluorescently labeled [Glu]Pg in the compact conformation is relatively low and is unaffected by 6-AHA, whereas expression of LBS in the β-conformation of [Lys]Pg and [Lys]Pm increases affinity for SK, which is weakened ∼13-20-fold by 6-AHA in interactions mediated by the COOH-terminal Lys414 residue of SK (1Boxrud P.D.

Pm retains significant affinity for SK when LBS interactions are blocked (KD 200-300 pm) through its interactions with the catalytic domain of Pm. LBS interactions, thus, play a critical role in formation and stabilization of the SK·Pm catalytic complex. The present study describes the first rapid-reaction kinetics investigation of active site fluorescently labeled Pm binding to SK, characterizes the binding and conformational intermediates on the pathway, and identifies LBS-dependent steps. Stopped-flow fluorescence kinetics of SK binding to fluoresce-in-labeled [Lys]Pm identified the forward reactions of complex stabilization, whereas the reverse reactions were examined by competitive displacement of fluorescently labeled Pm from SK by unlabeled, active site-blocked Pm. Combined analysis of forward and reverse reactions allowed the sequence of elementary reaction steps of the mechanism to be delineated for the first time. Our results support the hypothesis that LBS-dependent near-diffusion-limited SK binding to form an SK·Pm encounter complex is followed by two consecutive, favorable conformational changes. The much slower competitive displacement presents as an apparent first-order process but is governed by an off-rate that is a function of the forward and reverse rate constants for the second and third steps. The conformational changes are hypothesized to reflect in part, changes in SK from its flexible conformation in solution to its ordered structure when it binds to Pm and/or a conformational change affecting the Pm catalytic site in processes that involve specific LBS interactions that are differentially affected by benzamidine and 6-AHA. Interaction of SK Lys414 with a Pm kringle contributes primarily to stabilizing the SK·Pm encounter complex in the first step of the pathway. Protein Purification and Characterization—Human [Glu]Pg carbohydrate form 2 ([Glu]Pg2) was purified from plasma by published procedures (38Deutsch D.G. Mertz E.T.

Protein concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm using the following absorption coefficients ((mg/ml)-1cm-1) and molecular weights: Pm, 1.9 and 84,000 (39Castellino F.J. Powell J.R.

The thiol group on the incorporated inhibitor generated by treatment of ATA-FFR-Pm with NH2OH was labeled with 5-(iodoacetamido)fluorescein to yield [5F]FFR-Pm as described (12Boxrud P.D. Fay W.P.

[5F]FFR-Pm concentration and probe incorporation (87%) were determined from the probe and protein absorbance in 6 m guanidine as described (44Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14963-14973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were homogeneous by SDS gel electrophoresis. Stopped-flow Kinetics of SK and SKΔK414 Binding to [5F]FFR-Pm—Time traces of SK and SKΔK414 binding to [5F]FFR-Pm were acquired with an Applied Photophysics SX-18MV stopped-flow spectrofluorometer in single mixing mode. Fluorescence was measured with excitation at 500 nm and an emission cut-on filter (Melles-Griot) with 50% transmission at 515 nm. The reaction volume was 200 μl, path length was 2 mm, and experiments were performed at 25 °C. SK or SKΔK414 (0.025-15 μm) and [5F]FFR-Pm (5-20 nm) were reacted under pseudo-first order conditions (SK ≥ 5-fold over labeled Pm at the lowest concentration) in 50 mm Hepes, 0.125 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml PEG, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 μm FFR-CH2Cl, pH 7.4, in the absence and presence of 50 mm 6-AHA or in 50 mm Hepes, 0.075 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml PEG, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 μm FFR-CH2Cl, pH 7.4, containing 50 mm benzamidine to maintain constant ionic strength. Time traces (1000 data points) of near-complete (>95%) exponential fluorescence decreases ranged from 0.5 to 30 s, depending on the SK concentration and the presence of effector. Typically, 10 time traces were averaged for each SK concentration. Control reactions containing buffer and SK only, and buffer and [5F]FFR-Pm only, were performed to quantitate background and initial probe fluorescence, respectively, and to permit transformation of raw data into the fractional change in initial fluorescence ((Fobs - Fo)/Fo = ΔF/Fo). Averaged time traces were analyzed using Equation 1, ΔF/Fo=(Fo-FM)(A1e(-kobs1t)+(1-A1)e(-kobs2t))+FM(Eq. 1) where Fo is the starting fluorescence, FM is the final fluorescence, A1 is the fractional amplitude of the first exponential, (1 - A1) is the fractional amplitude of the second exponential, and kobs 1 and kobs 2 are the observed first-order rate constants. The observed pseudo-first order rate constants for each process were analyzed as a function of the total SK concentration ([SK]o) using Equation 2, kobs=klim[SK]oK1app+[SK]o+koff(Eq. 2) where klim is the maximal value for the rate constant, K1 app is the apparent dissociation constant for the SK·Pm encounter complex, and koff is the overall reverse rate constant for binding. In addition, arrays of time traces at varying SK concentrations were analyzed simultaneously using the numerical integration programs Dynafit (47Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar) and KinTek Explorer (KinTek Corp.), combining numerical solution of the differential equations generated from the mechanism with nonlinear least-squares analysis. Competitive Dissociation of [5F]FFR-Pm from Its Complex with SK or SKΔK414 by FFR-Pm—Measurements were performed with an SLM 8100 spectrofluorometer or a Photon Technology International QuantaMaster 6000 fluorometer using acrylic cuvettes coated with polyethylene glycol 20,000. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 500 and 516 nm, respectively, with 4/8 nm and 2/8 nm excitation/emission band passes on the SLM and the Photon Technology International instruments, respectively. [5F]FFR-Pm (10-22 nm) was incubated with excess SK or SKΔK414 (15-100 nm) at 25 °C in the absence and presence of 50 mm 6-AHA or in buffer containing 0.075 m NaCl and 50 mm benzamidine until the fluorescence was stable (∼15 min). The reverse reaction was initiated by the addition of 100-1000 nm FFR-Pm, such that any remaining free SK was saturated with FFR-Pm, and the dissociation of SK from the SK·[5F]FFR-Pm complex by the remaining FFR-Pm was apparently first order in SK·[5F]FFR-Pm complex concentration. The increase in fluorescence was monitored until it was >90% complete, typically 4 h. Corrections were made for background scattering by subtraction of blanks containing all reactants except [5F]FFR-Pm. Corrections for instrument drift and probe photobleaching were done using cuvettes containing [5F]FFR-Pm and SK to form the complex, with the addition of buffer instead of FFR-Pm. Results expressed as ΔF/Fo versus time were fit by a single exponential to obtain estimates of koff. Least-squares fitting was performed with SCIENTIST Software (MicroMath), and the progress curves were also analyzed by numerical integration with Dynafit and Kintek Explorer. The latter program allowed simultaneous analysis of the competitive dissociation experiments and the array of forward reaction time traces at varying SK concentrations. All reported estimates of error represent ± 2 S.D. Equation 3 shows the analytical expression for koff in a 3-step binding reaction (48Tsodikov O.V. Record Jr., M.T. Biophys.

Fluorescence titrations were performed with the Photon Technology International fluorometer at excitation and emission wavelengths of 500 and 516 nm, respectively, with 2/8-nm excitation/emission band passes. Fluorescence changes were measured after equilibration for 5-10 min. In the competitive binding experiments, SK or SKΔK414 was titrated into a mixture of labeled Pm and FFR-Pm. Concentrations of FFR-Pm were 5 and 15 nm in the titrations with SK and 10 nm in the titrations with SKΔK414. Measurements were corrected for background (≤10%) by subtraction of blanks lacking [5F]FFR-Pm. Simultaneous nonlinear least-squares fitting with SCIENTIST software was performed of the [5F]FFR-Pm titrations with SK or SKΔK414 in the absence and presence of fixed FFR-Pm concentrations by the cubic equation for tight competitive binding of a single ligand (SK or SKΔK414) to labeled ([5F]FFR-Pm) and non-labeled acceptor (FFR-Pm) (49Bock P.E.

However, single exponential analysis of the time traces in the presence of 6-AHA and benzamidine consistently gave poorer fits with non-random residuals; hence, all time traces were analyzed with the biexponential Equation 1.

The LRET distances also provide insight into the apo state structure, for which there is currently no crystal structure available. The distance change between the glutamate-bound state and the apo state is similar to that observed between the glutamate-bound and antagonist UBP-310-bound form of the GluR5 ligand binding domain, indicating that the cleft for the apo state of the GluR6 ligand binding domain should be similar to the UBP-310-bound form of GluR5.

Ionotropic glutamate receptors are the main excitatory neurotransmitter receptors in the mammalian central nervous system. Glutamate binds to an extracellular domain in these receptors and mediates a series of conformational changes that ultimately result in the formation of a cation-selective channel (activation), which then subsequently closes in the continued presence of the agonist (desensitization) (1.Dingledine R.

The kainate subtype, on the other hand, is the least studied of the three ionotropic glutamate receptor subtypes. The few structures of the agonist- and antagonist-bound states of the ligand binding domains of the GluR6 and GluR5 subunits of kainate receptors suggest that this subtype of receptors most likely exhibits a similar mechanism as that of the closely related AMPA subtype (13.Mayer M.L.

However, the structures of the agonist-bound forms of kainate receptors cover a limited range of activations; the only partial agonist structures available are those of the kainate- and domoate-bound states, which exhibit 50% of the efficacy as the full agonist glutamate (13.Mayer M.L. Neuron. 2005; 45: 539-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 14.Nanao M.H. Green T. Stern-Bach Y. Heinemann S.F. Choe S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Additionally, there are no structures of the apo state for any subunit of the kainate receptors. Typically, the antagonist-bound structures are thought to closely resemble the apo state of the protein because they hold the binding domain in an open cleft conformation. In the case of kainate receptors, there are three antagonist-bound states of the GluR5 ligand binding domain. These three structures, however, show a range of cleft closures. Additionally, because of a shift in the orientation of domain 2, the axis of rotation between the antagonist- and glutamate-bound forms are different for the 2-amino-3-[5-tert-butyl-3-(phosphonomethoxy)-4-isoxazolyl]propionic acid (ATPO)-bound state and the 2-amino-2-carboxyethyl-3-(2-carboxythiophene-3-yl-methyl)-5-methylpyrimidine-2,4-dione (UBP-310)- and (S)-1-(2-amino-2-carboxyethyl)-3-(2-carboxybenzyl) pyrimidine-2,4-dione (UBP-302)-bound states (18.Mayer M.L.

It is therefore still unknown which of these structures most closely represents the apo state of the protein. To study the conformational changes in the isolated ligand binding domain of the kainate receptor, we have used a luminescence resonance energy (LRET)-based method to determine distances between sites on domain 1 and domain 2 of the bilobed structure of the GluR6 subunit of the kainate receptor (Fig. 1) in scenarios with a wide range of activations. The distance between the two domains provides a readout of the extent of cleft closure in the apo state and the various agonist-bound states. A wide range of activations was achieved by investigating a number of agonists with the wild type receptor and the T661E mutant. The T661E GluR6 receptors exhibit 20% of the maximum whole cell current by kainate relative to glutamate in the absence of desensitization (34.Fleck M.W. Cornell E. Mah S.J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1219-1227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These LRET-based distances obtained for the wild type and T661E mutant provide a comprehensive analysis of the changes in cleft closure over the entire spectrum of activations and conclusively show that kainate receptors exhibit a graded cleft closure conformational change and hence exhibit a similar mechanism of activation as AMPA receptors. Chemicals—Domoic acid and (2S,4R)-4-methyl glutamate were purchased from Tocris Bioscience (Ellisville, MO). Glutamate and kainate were obtained from Sigma. [3H]Kainate was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Purification of GluR6 Ligand Binding Domain—The GluR6-flip plasmid was provided by Dr. Kathryn Partin (Colorado State University), and the GluR6 ligand binding domain plasmid was constructed as in previously described work (13.Mayer M.L. Neuron. 2005; 45: 539-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The mutations were introduced by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All constructs and mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Proteins were expressed, purified, and characterized as detailed previously (13.Mayer M.L. Neuron. 2005; 45: 539-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Briefly, the protein was expressed in Escherichia coli Origami-B (DE3) cells, and first purified by a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid HiTrap affinity column (GE Healthcare) followed by thrombin digestion overnight to remove the histidine tag. Anion exchange chromatography (Q-Sepharose Fast Flow from GE Healthcare) was then performed to remove the thrombin. The functionality of all purified proteins was established by saturation binding of [3H]kainate to the proteins (supplemental Fig. 1). Labeling and LRET Measurements— 0.5 μm protein in phosphate-buffered saline with 1 mm glutamate was labeled with a 1:1 ratio of the maleimide derivatives of fluorescein (Biotium, Hayward, CA) and triethylenetetraaminehexaacetic acid chelate of terbium (TTHA-Tb) (Invitrogen) or with terbium chelate alone for donor:acceptor and donor-only proteins, respectively. The labeled protein was dialyzed extensively against phosphate-buffered saline and used for the LRET measurements. Fluorescence measurements were obtained using a Time-Master™ model TM-3/2003 (Photon Technology International, Inc., Birmingham, NJ) lifetime spectrometer. The fluorescence data were obtained with at least two different protein samples, and for each sample the data were an average of five shots (hence the data shown is an average of 10 data points). The data from each independent sample were also fit to ensure no significant differences between samples of the same protein. The distances were calculated from the donor-only and donor: acceptor lifetimes using Förster's theory for energy transfer, and the R0 values were determined for each of the constructs by obtaining the fluorescence and absorption spectrum of donor and acceptor, respectively, tagged to the proteins (16.Ramanoudjame G. Du M. Mankiewicz K.A. Jayaraman V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 10473-10478Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The error reported for the distances has been determined using error propagation due to the error in the lifetimes. Electrophysiological Measurements—For the whole cell current recordings, human embryonic kidney 293 cells were transfected with wild type or T661E mutant GluR6-flip receptors. The transfected cells were voltage-clamped at a holding potential of -60 mV, and solutions were applied using a homemade U-tube mixing device that had a 100-μm aperture. The electrode solution, for the electrophysiological measurements, contained 140 mm CsCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm Na2ATP, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4); the extracellular bath solution contained 145 mm NaCl, 1.8 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 3 mm KCl, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Currents were amplified with an Axon 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), low pass filtered at 1 kHz. The filtered signal was digitized using a Labmaster DMA digitizing board controlled by Axon PClamp software. All the experiments were performed at room temperature. Conformational Changes Induced upon Ligand Binding— The LRET lifetimes as measured by the sensitized emission of the acceptor fluorescein due to luminescence transfer from the donor terbium chelate for the wild type and T661E mutant proteins are shown in Fig. 2 and listed in Table 1. There are currently two structures, the kainate-bound and glutamate-bound forms, available for the GluR6 ligand binding domain (13.Mayer M.L. Neuron. 2005; 45: 539-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The changes in distance calculated from the LRET life-times between the kainate- and glutamate-bound states for residues 398–666 and 398–689 are 1 and 1.5 Å, respectively, for both sets of residues, similar to the changes of 0.9 and 1.2 Å observed between the kainate and glutamate crystal structures (13.Mayer M.L. Neuron. 2005; 45: 539-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). This agreement in distance changes establishes that these two x-ray structures are a good representation of the average dynamic structure of the protein in buffer.TABLE 1Lifetimes for donor-only (D) and donor:acceptor (DA)-tagged GluR6 ligand binding domain constructs and distances determined based on these lifetimesProteinLigated stateτDτDADistanceμsμsÅS398C-S666CApo1699 ± 27192 ± 242.5 ± 0.7Glutamate1745 ± 32130 ± 339.4 ± 0.9Kainate1753 ± 34149 ± 440.3 ± 1Domoate1712 ± 30144 ± 340.3 ± 1Methyl glutamate1675 ± 27129 ± 339.6 ± 0.9S398C-S689CApo1745 ± 24185 ± 242.0 ± 0.6Glutamate1774 ± 1284 ± 236.3 ± 0.9Kainate1718 ± 2397 ± 237.5 ± 0.8Domoate1684 ± 2496 ± 237.5 ± 0.8Methyl glutamate1721 ± 2275 ± 235.8 ± 1S398C-S666C-T661EApo1786 ± 24212 ± 342.9 ± 0.6Glutamate1733 ± 32135 ± 339.7 ± 0.9Kainate1777 ± 25174 ± 341.4 ± 0.6S398C-S689C-T661EApo1711 ± 30176 ± 241.8 ± 0.7Glutamate1698 ± 3466 ± 135.1 ± 0.7Kainate1690 ± 3198 ± 237.7 ± 0.8 Open table in a new tab To obtain a comprehensive correlation between the extent of cleft closure and activation, a wide range of activations was investigated using the wild type and T661E mutant and agonists kainate, domoate, methyl glutamate, and glutamate (supplemental Fig. 2). The extent of activation was determined from the maximal whole cell currents mediated by saturating concentrations of the various agonists normalized to the currents mediated by saturating concentrations of glutamate. It should be noted that the normalized activation does not represent the channel open probability. Hence although the normalized activation is 1 for glutamate, the normalized open probability for glutamate activating the GluR6(Q)-flip receptors has been previously reported to be 0.96 (35.Li G. Oswald R.E. Niu L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12367-12375Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The correlation between the changes in the LRET-based distances between residue 398, in domain 1, and residues 666 and 689, in domain 2, for the different ligands bound to the wild type and T661E mutant and activation is shown in Fig. 3. These results show that the distances between residue 398 and residues 666 and 689 exhibit a negative correlation to the extent of activation over the full range, i.e. the full agonists exhibit shorter distances and partial agonists exhibit longer distances between the sets of residues. Because residue 398 is in domain 1 and residues 666 and 689 are in domain 2 of the isolated ligand binding domain, the decrease in distance between the two domains is consistent with a cleft closure conformational change. Thus, it can be concluded that agonists with greater activations induce larger cleft closure, and cleft closure could be the coupling mechanism by which the agonist mediates channel opening over the full range of activations. Apo State of the Protein—The LRET-based distances indicate that the apo state is more open relative to the agonist-bound states, with a 3.1- and 5.7-Å increase in distance between residue 398 and residues 666 and 689, respectively, upon going from the glutamate-bound form to the apo state. This result is consistent with a cleft closure conformational change induced by agonist binding. Because there are no apo state or antagonist-bound structures available for the GluR6 ligand binding domain, the distance change between the apo state and glutamate-bound state for GluR6 is compared with the changes between the three antagonist-bound structures and the glutamate-bound structure for the closely related ligand binding domain of the GluR5 subunit (18.Mayer M.L. Ghosal A. Dolman N.P. Jane D.E. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2852-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 33.Hald H. Naur P. Pickering D.S. Sprogoe D. Madsen U. Timmermann D.B. Ahring P.K.

It should be noted that the glutamate-bound forms of the GluR6 and GluR5 ligand binding domains exhibit similar distances between residue 398 and residues 666 and 689, thus allowing for such a comparison (18.Mayer M.L. Ghosal A. Dolman N.P. Jane D.E. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2852-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 33.Hald H. Naur P. Pickering D.S. Sprogoe D. Madsen U. Timmermann D.B. Ahring P.K.

The three antagonist-bound structures of GluR5 have slightly varying degrees of open clefts relative to the full agonist glutamate-bound state, with the cleft being 28–30° more open in the ATPO, UBP-310, and UBP-302 antagonist-bound states (18.Mayer M.L. Ghosal A. Dolman N.P. Jane D.E. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2852-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 33.Hald H. Naur P. Pickering D.S. Sprogoe D. Madsen U. Timmermann D.B. Ahring P.K. Liljefors T. Schousboe A. Egebjerg J. Gajhede M. Kastrup J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25726-25736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Apart from the small changes in the extent of cleft opening, the axis of rotation in the ATPO structure is also different from that in the UBP-310- and UBP-302-bound states (Fig. 4). This difference in the axis of rotation is evident in the distances between 398 and 666 and 398 and 689 in the GluR5 crystal structures; in the ATPO-bound state, these differences in distances between the antagonist-bound and glutamate-bound states are not significantly different between the two sets of residues, 5.3 and 6.7 Å, whereas in the UBP-310- and UBP-302-bound states the differences in distances are significantly different, 3.8 and 6.7 Å and 3.9 and 7.1 Å, respectively. The 3.1- and 5.7-Å distance changes between the apo and glutamate-bound states for the two sets of residues from the GluR6 LRET measurements are similar to the 3.8- and 6.7-Å distance changes observed in the GluR5 crystal structures for the UBP-310-bound state and are also not significantly different from the 3.9- and 7.1-Å distance changes observed in the UBP-302-bound state. The 3.1-Å distance change from residue 398–666 determined from the GluR6 LRET measurements of the apo state to the glutamate-bound state, however, is significantly different from the 5.3-Å distance change in the ATPO-bound state to the glutamate-bound state observed in the GluR5 crystal structures. These results suggest that the axis for rotation in the apo state of the GluR6 ligand binding domain should be similar to that observed in the UBP-310- and UBP-302-bound forms and not similar to that observed for the ATPO-bound state of GluR5 ligand binding domain, and therefore the apo state of the GluR6 ligand binding domain should be similar in structure to the UBP-310- and UBP-302-bound structures of the GluR5 ligand binding domain. The similarity of the distances in the apo state with UBP-310- and UBP-302-bound structures also implies that the cleft is as open as in the UBP-310- and UBP-302-bound structures and that the change in cleft closure upon binding agonists in GluR6 would be ∼29–30°, which is one of the largest observed in this class of proteins. Although the LRET investigations presented here probe a large range of activations, they are still not as comprehensive as that for the AMPA subtype. A detailed study such as the one performed for the GluR2 subunit (16.Ramanoudjame G. Du M. Mankiewicz K.A. Jayaraman V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 10473-10478Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) might reveal mutants and ligands that may not follow the general correlations between the extent of cleft closure and the extent of activation. Hence, although the cleft closure correlation holds for a number of cases, it should be noted that this may not be the only means by which the agonist controls receptor activation. A more detailed study of the dynamics of the GluR6 subunit by other spectroscopic investigations such as NMR and vibrational spectroscopy would provide more detailed insight into the various different mechanisms by which the agonists mediate receptor activation and provide insight into further similarities or differences between AMPA and kainate receptors. Conclusions—The LRET investigations of the kainate subtype show that, as with AMPA receptors, the extent of cleft closure is graded and correlates to the extent of activation and suggest that the mechanism of activation of kainate receptors is similar to AMPA receptors. However, the LRET investigations in conjunction with the crystal structure studies (18.Mayer M.L. Ghosal A. Dolman N.P. Jane D.E. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2852-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 33.Hald H. Naur P. Pickering D.S. Sprogoe D. Madsen U. Timmermann D.B. Ahring P.K. Liljefors T. Schousboe A. Egebjerg J. Gajhede M. Kastrup J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25726-25736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) suggest that the change in degree of cleft closure in kainate receptors from the apo state to the full agonist glutamate-bound states is much greater than in AMPA receptors, suggesting that although the overall mechanism of activation (cleft closure of the ligand binding domain) may be the same, the subtleties in mechanism between the two subtypes of receptors may be different.
